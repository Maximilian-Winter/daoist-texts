## Preface to the Supreme Cavernous Mysterious Numinous Treasure Five Talismans, Volume One

In the profound antiquity of pure harmony, yin and yang were unbound, the wind stirred not the branches, and clouds and rain came in their appointed time. All things followed their own hearts freely; sentient beings walked the dao at will. Above, they aligned with Heaven’s heart; Heaven and humanity shared breath. Good and ill had no omen; no killing or harm was heard. Fear of misfortune was absent; delight in fortune was not sought. No words of approval or disapproval arose; no teachings of right or wrong were born. Pure and unblemished, steadfast and undiminished, they yielded to Heaven and entrusted their nature, committed to Earth and surrendered their fate. Countless beings obtained what they sought, none harmed the harmony. Where harmony is unharmed, Heaven and Earth have no master; masterless, they transform themselves. This great teaching without instruction preserves life itself.

At that time, people lived ninety thousand years. Then they began to learn the dao of immortality and ascend to Heaven. This could be called the ultimate transformation, following their hearts; it could be called the supreme teaching. Transformation has no fixed form; teaching leaves no trace. Though traces are unseen,功 (achievement) remains; instructions endure while virtue vanishes. This is the image of Heavenly Harmony, where the Three Powers correspond alike.

By the era of the Three Sovereigns, pure harmony began to wane; subtle gains and losses appeared. Laughter and anger showed on faces. Laws were made to govern the people. Spirits and numinous beings worked on the body to preserve all living things. This was the contest of beginnings and the struggle of emergence. Groups spoke of gains and losses, natural omens arose. Hexagrams and images corresponded to all things; the mysterious void was calculated in Heaven and Earth. The rise of affairs was foretold in these omens.

By the time of Xuanyuan, the era of Shennong declined. Lords invaded one another, each with the spirit of attack and conquest. The enlightened ruler could not set things right. Then the Yellow Emperor learned to wield weapons, to punish the unruly. Lords all came to pay homage, but Chiyou was most violent and none could defeat him. The Flame Emperor wished to oppress the lords, but they all turned to Xuanyuan. Xuanyuan cultivated virtue and rallied troops, mastered the five arts, saved and comforted the people, measured the four directions, and taught bears, leopards, wolves, tigers, and other beasts to fight the Flame Emperor on the plains of Banquan. After three battles, his will prevailed.

Chiyou rebelled, disobeying the emperor’s command. Thus the Yellow Emperor led his army to battle Chiyou on the plains of Zhuolu and finally overcame him. The lords then honored Xuanyuan as Son of Heaven, replacing the Shennong clan. He appointed Cloud Commanders, set left and right supervisors to oversee the myriad nations’ ghosts and spirits, sealed mountains and rivers, and performed many rites.

He obtained the precious cauldron, welcomed the sun, pushed the clouds, and raised the wind-lord, the shepherd of strength, the eternal first, and the great swan to govern the people. He followed the order of Heaven and Earth, the reasons of light and dark, the teachings of death and life, the difficulties of survival and extinction. He sowed the hundred grains and grasses in time, nurtured birds, beasts, silkworms, and mulberries, and wove the sun, moon, stars, water, mud, soil, stone, metal, and jade. He labored with heart, strength, ears, and eyes, regulated water, fire, and all things, and bore the auspicious virtue of earth. Hence he was called the Yellow Emperor.

The Yellow Emperor had twenty-five sons; fourteen received surnames. He dwelt on Xuanyuan Hill and married the daughter of Xiling, called Leizu. Leizu was the Yellow Emperor’s chief consort and bore two sons, whose descendants all ruled the world.

One was Xuanyao, called Qingyang, who descended to dwell by the River Jiang. The other was Changyi, who settled by the Weak Water. Changyi married a woman of Shu Mountain named Changpu, who bore Gaoyang. Gaoyang had sage virtue and was called Zhuanxu, grandson of the Yellow Emperor and son of Changyi.

He was deep and pure with good counsel, clear and wise, nurturing wealth to serve the land, carrying time to symbolize Heaven, relying on spirits to uphold faith and righteousness, governing breath to teach the people, pure and sincere in sacrifice and worship. His domain extended north to the dark tombs, south to the cinnabar caverns, west to the drifting sands, east to the coiling trees. All moving and still beings, great and small spirits, all under sun and moon’s light, none failed to submit.

He bore a son named Qiongchan, and Xuanyao’s grandson Gaoxin ascended, called Emperor Yu. Emperor Yu was the Yellow Emperor’s great-grandson. Gaoxin’s father was Qiaoji; Qiaoji’s father was Xuanyao; Xuanyao’s father was the Yellow Emperor. From Xuanyao to Qiaoji, neither held the throne, until Gaoxin took the imperial seat. Gaoxin was a clan cousin to Emperor Zhuanxu.

Gaoxin was born numinous and spiritual. He called himself Pushili, not for himself. Sharp of hearing and far-seeing, bright in subtle discernment, he followed Heaven’s righteousness, knew the people’s urgency, was benevolent yet awe-inspiring, kind and trustworthy, cultivated himself and the world obeyed. He took from the earth’s bounty and used it sparingly, cared for and taught the people, welcomed and sent off the sun and moon, honored ghosts and spirits with reverence. His countenance was vast and his virtue lofty; his movements timely, his attire skillful.

Emperor Yu held the center and ruled the world. Wherever sun and moon shone, wherever wind and rain came, none failed to follow and assist him. He gathered the officials of Heaven, Earth, and the numinous, riding a treasure canopy and a mysterious chariot, driving nine dragons, guiding cloud horses, opening Heaven’s windows. He called himself the True King of the Nine Heavens, the True Emperor of the Three Heavens, bearing the Eight Light Festival and wearing the talisman of the Radiant Clouds. He arrived at the Terrace of Shepherded Virtue and bestowed upon Emperor Yu the Scripture of the True Numinous of the Nine Heavens and the Precious Talismans of the Three True Heavens.

The Nine Heavens’ true golden script opens the supreme passage of the Dao above, spreading the measure of primordial birth and divine spirits below, marking the limit of the ultimate chaos, ending in the dark earth to give birth to the beginning. Only the Heavenly True creates its boundary; the worthy cannot reach its extent.

The nine breaths nurture, spirits align with sun and moon. Thus plants, wood, names, and grasses, myriad kinds are distinguished, sweet and bitter have flavor, metals and stones differ in kind. Above, Heaven is arranged so that the two instruments (yin and yang) are without omission; below, humans are arranged so that years and lives do not fail.

Few who reach this understanding grasp its meaning; those who enter its mystery admire its flavor. Yet its text is vast and flourishing; the Heavenly Scripture is difficult to complete. The words of true beings cannot be understood; the heart of the Supreme One is beyond measure. Without the enlightenment of the highest spirits, none can see or reveal it.

Thus Emperor Ku lamented his low talent, prized the book but did not know its direction. Emperor Ku then sacrificed at the altar of the Heavenly Emperor of the Northern River, hid it in the peak of Bell Mountain, sealed it in a casket of blue jade, hoping that later sages with功德 (merit) would reveal it.

Bell Mountain lies nineteen thousand li north of the Weak Water, twelve thousand li high, seven thousand li square on top, circling thirty thousand li. It grows a thousand kinds of divine herbs and a thousand and forty varieties of spiritual grass. People who merely walk upon it become immortals after three steps.

Above is the Golden Terrace with seven treasures and purple palaces, the dwelling of primordial breath, the seat of the Heavenly Emperor. Sun and moon cannot shine upon it. Bell Mountain’s radiance glows day and night, illuminating ten thousand li beyond, surpassing even the Milky Way.

The sages say Heaven lacks northwest; thus Bell Mountain shines beneath the nine yin.

In Emperor Yao’s time, floods surged to the sky, mountains collapsed and tombs crumbled, and the common people were distressed. Yao ordered a search for one who could control the waters. The four mountains all said: Gun is capable. Yao said: Gun is a man who failed his mission and destroyed his clan; his heart is flawed and damaged; I fear he cannot be used. The four mountains said: We have not seen anyone better than Gun; may the emperor try him.

Thus Yao heeded the four mountains and used Gun to control the waters. For nine years the waters did not cease, but the功 (achievement) was incomplete. Then Emperor Yao sought another and found Shun.

Shun ascended to take over the emperor’s governance, patrolled and inspected. Gun’s efforts to control the waters failed, so Shun executed Gun on Feather Mountain. All the world agreed with Shun’s judgment.

Shun then recommended Gun’s son Yu as capable and sent him to continue Gun’s work. After Yao’s passing, Emperor Shun asked the four mountains: Is there anyone who can complete Yao’s work and hold office? They said: Bo Yu is Minister of Works and can complete the task, surpassing Yao’s功 (achievement).

Shun said: Indeed, command Yu to finish taming the waters. Yu bowed and deferred to Qi, Hou Ji, and Gao Yao. Shun said: You should go serve your affairs.

Yu was quick and resourceful, his virtue unbroken, benevolent and approachable, trustworthy in speech. His voice was the law, his body the measure. He leveled the earth, repaired ditches and canals, and was solemn and majestic, the guiding principle and the pattern.

Yu then, together with Yi and Hou Ji, under imperial command, mobilized lords and commoners, raised workers to cultivate the land, cut down trees along mountains, and fixed the great rivers and mountains.

Yu labored despite his father Gun’s failure and execution, enduring hardship and deep thought, living outside for thirteen years, passing his own gate without entering, wearing thin clothes and eating sparingly to honor ghosts and spirits, humbling his dwelling and exerting effort on ditches and canals.

He traveled by land and carriage, by water and boat, by mud and sled, by mountain and marker, measuring with compass and square, wearing the four seasons to open the nine provinces, connecting the nine roads, leveling the nine marshes, crossing the nine mountains.

He ordered Yi and the masses to plant rice in low wetlands. He ordered Hou Ji and the masses to eat hard and fresh food, little at a time, adjusting surplus and deficit to balance the lords.

Yu then traveled from Jizhou, cut the Hu Pass and the Qishan bridge, repaired the road from Taiyuan to Yueyang, extended his care to Heng, Zhang, Heng, and Wei, crossed the continent, made islands and barbarian skins and clothes, passed between the right Jieshi into the river, crossing the river to Gunzhou.

The nine rivers were guided, thunder and summer rains moistened the land, Nong and Ju converged, mulberry soil was for silkworms, and the people found low hills to dwell.

The earth was leveled and waters subsided; then Yu toured Bell Mountain, sacrificed to the Supreme Emperor at the Jade Palace, returned his great功 (merit) to the Queen of Heaven, and completed his great achievement among myriad spirits.

Then he ascended the mysterious peak, to the embroidered ridge’s recess, the jade realm’s summit, and suddenly found this book.

Yu then respectfully fasted, cleared the forest and deep grotto, and requested to wear and carry it. The true being told Yu: Your功德 (merit) moves the spirits, Heaven and humans both assist, but your life is near its end, alas!

He then gave the secret formula for the dao of longevity, showed the true treasure methods of wearing and protection, divided and distinguished them.

He then reckoned功劳 (merit) in the fields of Kuaiji, summoned the assembly of gods on the mountains of Eastern Yue.

At that time, the four energies were warm and abundant, the clear wind blew, mysterious功 (achievement) flowed smoothly, with an empty heart and inner governance.

He thought to withdraw the body and erase traces, only hiding the radiance in the deep threads, glimpsing the numinous mysteries of the Nine Heavens, observing the treasured enclosures of the Three Heavens, moving to preserve life in great harmony, resting to abandon essence for longevity.

Above he viewed the heavenly scriptures, profound and hard to unravel; below he pitied all living beings, unaware of their measure.

He then returned to Phoenix Soaring South Mountain, Dragon Standing Sea Island, again composing the true numinous essentials, gathering the heavenly palace’s treasured books, arranging them in grades, distinguishing what to cultivate, practicing five colors to fix their directions, naming their imperial titles.

The Supreme One’s original name was the Numinous Treasure Five Talismans Heavenly Text, stored within the Mysterious Terrace, the ancient red stone cliff, hidden in the grotto of Miao Mountain, emerging once every ten thousand years to show immortality.

One complete scripture was wrapped in southern harmonious cinnabar silk, hidden in the secluded hill of Menglong, sealed in a golden casket, stamped with the seal of the Mysterious Capital, entrusted to the water spirits of rivers and lakes, assigned to the lord of the Zhen Water cavern, requiring three thousand assemblies before passing to the water master tutor.

The stone cliff’s script awaits the great kalpa’s arrival to reveal it.

Yu thus wore the numinous formula to conceal his radiance, buried this mountain to manifest his end. Immortals understood its secret; fools said it was lost.

Great indeed is divine transformation, entrusting the body to return to origin. Oh great lord! The mysterious traces are high and thorough; through myriad kalpas, the scripture is tested; the dao chant requires its formula; the yang nine sees the supreme heavenly book; the hundred and six announce the功 (merit) of the transmission clan; the great song lasts a thousand generations, the orchid fragrance leaves a lingering scent.

## Later, in the twelfth year of King Hao Helü, early spring, first month, he ordered to patrol the rivers and lakes, display banners of dragons and serpents, review troops at the enemy state, and loosen his belt at Baoshan.

Baoshan recluse served as envoy, called Dragon Might Elder, commanding the utmost cavernous place, deeply treading the source of the great abyss.

Baoshan recluse was one who attained the dao. Dwelling on Hao Mountain, his name unknown. Proud and aloof, far from worldly glory, people called him the Sun Baoshan Recluse.

Helü often personally drove to pay respects, asking about safety and danger.

At that time, they often discussed the origin and path of this source, so he was temporarily made envoy.

The recluse carried torches and fire, traveling day and night for one hundred seventy-four days before returning.

Upon return, he fully reported: I do not know where it ends. The recluse walked about seven thousand li on foot, suddenly encountering tangled grass holes, a thousand paths and a hundred roads, sandy trails in disorder, all gathering in one place, forms similar, gates alike.

At the mouth of the clustered paths was a golden city and jade houses, circling five hundred li, in the midst of many roads, bright moon shining brilliantly, splendid radiance illuminating.

Inside were curtains, beds, weaving looms, windows and dense chambers, adorned with purple jade, decorated with gold. The cloud mansion soared to Heaven, its shape unknown.

Looking around, no one was seen. Gazing at the city’s side, he saw inscriptions above the gate: “Queen of Heaven’s Separate Palace,” and above the door: “Hall of the Great Yin.”

The recluse knew this was a divine pavilion and dared not enter rashly. He fasted and purified for three days, bound himself and entered.

Inside the jade chamber, on the northern loom, lay a scroll of red silk with characters incomprehensible.

The recluse bowed twice and took the book, saying: “Lowly subject of the Lower Earth, envoy of the King of Wu, I request this divine text as proof of true qi’s efficacy.”

Upon leaving, the door closed by itself. Inside, he heard flutes and drums, sounds of horses and men.

The recluse was shaken and dared not linger, nor advance further, fearing confusion and losing his way.

He turned back, bringing the book to present to Helü.

He said: At first entry it was dim, requiring fire to proceed, yet still indistinct. The path’s four directions up and down were all blue stones, square about five or six zhang, roughly level.

There were wide and narrow places; the ground was wet in spots, sometimes one or two li apart.

The recluse walked about one thousand li without dimness; natural light shone like midday. The great path was high, dry, and dusty, with yin-yang ditches on both sides. Every thirty li was a stone well with sweet water, drinking it filled without hunger.

He saw traces of men and horses, entering other paths nearby.

The path and walls seemed like white stone, shining with light, eighty zhang wide, two hundred zhang high.

Approaching Dongting, he no longer saw the end above, looking up like Heaven, with sunlight growing brighter, as bright as midday sun.

Neither warm nor cold, the air was harmonious and pure, fragrant qi abundant and unceasing.

Along the path were houses, pavilions, and towers, exquisite and carved, beyond naming.

At the crossroads, wide and narrow, the recluse circled about fifty li apart.

On all sides were jade pillars inscribed: “Ruins of the Nine Springs Dongting.”

Between them, trees grew in rows, green leaves purple and flourishing, mysterious grasses white and blooming, all nameless.

Five colors grew spontaneously, seven treasures shone dazzlingly, flying phoenixes soared above, dragons and qilin played below.

This was truly the numinous mansion of Heaven and Earth, the splendid hall of the True One.

The recluse fully recorded his journey to show the king, who was solemn and amazed, then purified himself on a quiet terrace, sacrificed to Heaven, and received the book.

That year, the great Hao’s wind and rain came in season, the five grains were abundant, the people joyous in their work, and the realm peaceful and harmonious.

Helü treasured the heavenly text but did not understand its words, so he sent envoys with the book, sealed in a golden case, stamped with the Jade Emperor’s seal, and sent the text to the great master Kong Qiu of Lu.

The envoy arrived at Lu, knelt before Qiu, and said: “The King of Wu once ordered a journey, gazed upon the sea crossing, rested and died at the hill of the Eastern Forest, and feasted at the Northern Bao Mountain.

Then the horses were fed and the carriage halted. Suddenly a red crow flew about, carrying this plain scroll, dropping it before the king’s carriage.

Great fortune and auspiciousness come from Heaven, blessing the nation for ten thousand generations, as enduring as metal and stone.

The envoy left the country bearing the heavenly text, wishing to explain the cause of auspicious signs and blessings.”

Qiu, calm and leisurely, did not open the case, but replied: “I once traveled above the Western River and heard children’s songs:

‘The King of Wu went to see Zhen Lake, Dragon Might Elder named Recluse, journeyed north to Bao Mountain to enter the numinous ruins, and stole the Dongting Yu’s book. The great text of the Heavenly Emperor cannot be spread. This is the first tutor of a hundred and six; now taken out, it causes the loss of the state.’

I consider the children’s words: In ancient times, Yu tamed the waters, leveled mountains and rivers,功 (achievement) complete, patrolled Bell Mountain’s recess, obtained the supreme scriptures received by the Yellow Emperor, Emperor Yu, and others.

Later he traveled to Kuaiji, further explained the numinous treasure’s mysterious text, compiled it as the Numinous Treasure Text, hid one copy in famous mountains and great stones, entrusted another to the water spirits, to be obtained by a daoist who attains the dao and offers it to the king.

I fear this text is surely the Numinous Treasure talisman’s supreme true text. Whether taken by the red crow or dropped, I do not yet know.”

The envoy knelt and thanked: “I humbly confirm the master’s words.”

Zi Lu, standing nearby, said: “To serve the lord’s envoy but disobey the lord’s command is not loyalty. Entering the country and waiting for officials, yet falsifying the message is not a good envoy. Such are crafty men; I ask permission to investigate.”

Confucius said: “To shake one’s skirt to darken the sun, to raise one’s hand to block the bright day—can sunlight be concealed? Can sun and moon be obscured? These two images, is it strange to block and cover? If their light reaches, no harm is done; you need not boast.”

Confucius then told the envoy: “This is the numinous essence of the Heavenly Official, composed by the great sage. It recounts the supreme harmony of yin and yang qi above, and the dao of transformation and nourishment below. Only immortals can use its text; kings cannot master its art.

If one withdraws the body to the mysterious and remote, seeks nature afar, avoids entanglements in non-action, escapes competition in deep mountains and secluded dwellings, then one may ask the master and possibly reveal the dao’s wondrous subtlety, the Supreme One’s secret words.”

Thus the book was returned to the envoy unopened.

The envoy returned and fully reported the master’s words.

Helü lamented his own shallowness, sighed and despaired, and ceased to seek further explanation.

He then hid it in divine knots, treasured the numinous text. Later, casually, he personally took it to view, but the seal was not removed and the book’s location was lost.

Fuchai obtained it at Laoshan but was eventually destroyed. Helü searched for it at Dongting but was conquered by Goujian.

Thus the children’s song foretold the loss of the state and capital.

Divine texts not granted but seized often bring disaster. Heavenly books not transmitted by the same dao are always punished in the Mysterious Capital.

## Hua Ziqi

Hua Ziqi was a man of Nine Rivers. In youth, he loved the dao of immortality, entered the mountains to hide, gathered and took herbs, dwelling in forests and hills for over twenty years.

Suddenly he met Master Luli, who taught him the secret of immortal concealment and numinous treasure formulas:

One called the Hidden Talisman of the River Map,

Two called the Flying Tortoise of Yiluo,

Three called Balance.

Taking them together, day by day he grew younger, his complexion like a young maiden’s. One day he traveled five hundred li, could lift a thousand jin, and changed his skin ten times in a year.

Then he entered the hidden mountain and suddenly ascended to Heaven in broad daylight.

---

## Essential Formulas of the Numinous Treasure

Huo Lin Immortal taught Lezi Chang, hidden in the shade of Laoshan.

Daoists entering the mountains gather herbs, collect eight stones of lingzhi to combine with elixir liquid, and conceal themselves in forest grottos to repel all evil spirits.

Those without the Numinous Treasure Five Talismans, the divine herbs sink and hide, the eight stones conceal their form, the lingzhi hides its light. Those who study but fail, evil qi tries to invade, ghosts and monsters shake and frighten.

Those who see the monsters and demons, pointing with the numinous talisman, they vanish by themselves.

If mountain spirits threaten, they are also broken and crushed, changing in myriad ways as they please.

Daoists must not recklessly practice non-dao methods; non-dao methods should be avoided. Your caution is utmost.

Those who follow the great法 (method) immediately gather and confront the gods, summon myriad spirits, cut off evil demons, wear the five talismans on the elbow, invite immortals of the nine skies, keep secret the numinous treasure of the five directions, never sharing the secret and remaining forever hidden.

This is the mysterious teaching of the Supreme Sovereign, the text and command hidden in the eastern Miao, sworn for myriad kalpas to be revealed once, then the heavenly book will not fade.

Closing the mouth brings slight blessing; leaking it brings heavy disaster. Thus Emperor Ku’s closest kin did not share it with Xuazi at Tang Yao.

## The Dao of Consuming the Essence of Sun and Moon

Consuming the sun’s essence can extend life.

Always on the first, third, fifth, seventh, ninth, and fifteenth days of the month, at sunrise, loosen hair and face the sun, close eyes and think of a small boy in the heart, wearing crimson robes with patterns, five colors shining bright red.

Rub hands over the face down to the heart, twelve times back and forth.

The sun’s essence is pure red yellow qi, coming before the eyes, entering the mouth, swallowing for eighteen breaths, rubbed by hand and sent down.

Incantation:

“Sun Lord, primordial yang, unite virtue with me, nurture together the small boy in the crimson palace. In a moment, descend to the cinnabar field and stop, granting long life.”

Consuming the moon’s essence nourishes the kidney root, turning white hair black again.

Always at midnight, think of white qi between the kidneys, circulating through the body, reaching the brain’s door, descending to the soles.

The dao of nature is easy to cause but hard to practice.

Always on the fifteenth day of the month, face the moon and chant:

“Moon Lord, primordial yin, unite virtue with me, nurture together the small boy in the cinnabar field.”

Then close eyes and think of the moon’s white yellow essence coming before the eyes, entering the mouth, swallowing for twenty-one breaths, rubbed by hand and sent down, stopping at the cinnabar field.

The Central Yellow Dao Lord said: Heaven gives birth to myriad things; humans are precious.

The human body contains Heaven and Earth, sun and moon, the Northern Dipper, the Jade Balance, the Five Mountains and Four Rivers, mountains, rivers, seas, wind lords, rain masters, numinous stars and altars, qilin, phoenix, dragon, tiger, tortoise, five grains, mulberries, six domestic animals, birds, beasts, fish, turtles, crocodiles, bamboo, wood, and hundreds of grasses—all are governed by laws.

He establishes the Son of Heaven, sets the Three Lords and Nine Ministers, twenty-seven great officers, eighty-one primordial officials.

He divides the nine provinces, one hundred twenty commanderies, one thousand two hundred counties, eighteen thousand villages, thirty-six thousand pavilions, one hundred eighty thousand fortresses.

He has palaces, homes, gates, wells, stoves, cauldrons, grains, millet, and rice.

The gods can eat and drink; humans knowing this can live long.

The human head is round like Heaven; feet square like Earth; hair are stars; eyes are sun and moon; eyebrows are the Northern Dipper; ears are altars; nose is hill and mountain; mouth is rivers; teeth are jade and stone; limbs are the four seasons.

The five viscera correspond to the Five Phases and Five Emperors and Five Officers.

Above are five stars; below five mountains; inside five kings; outside five virtues; ascending five clouds; transforming five dragons.

The five viscera are lung, heart, liver, spleen, and kidney.

The six bowels: gallbladder for liver, stomach for spleen, large intestine for lung, small intestine for heart, bladder for kidney, navel for the capital bowel.

Gallbladder is the Son of Heaven, the Great Dao Lord; spleen is the empress noble lady; heart is the Grand Marshal; left kidney is Minister of Education; right kidney is Minister of Works.

The eight trigram gods, with the navel’s Taiyi, are the nine ministers.

The twelve ring tower gods are twelve; the spleen’s remonstrance ministers twelve; the three viscera gods three; totaling twenty-seven great officers.

The limb gods are eighty-one primordial officials.

The upper primordial qi is the crown envoy; the lower primordial qi is the great herald.

Upper part nine transformations, middle part nine orifices, lower part nine names, corresponding to the nine provinces.

The Three Lords’ mansion, Nine Ministers’ mansion, Twenty-seven Great Officers’ mansion, Eighty-one Primordial Officials’ mansion total one hundred twenty mansions.

Inside the mansions are five officers; outside five officials; combined ten officials make one thousand two hundred counties.

The central gods number eighteen thousand; upper gods thirty-six thousand; pavilions thirty-six thousand; each pavilion has five fortresses, totaling one hundred eighty thousand fortresses.

Also, the lung is the Jade Hall Palace’s Secretariat; heart is the Crimson Palace’s Primordial Yang Mansion; liver is the Blue Yang Palace’s Orchid Terrace Mansion; gallbladder is the Purple Tenuity Palace’s Limitless Mansion; spleen is the Central Palace’s Great Simplicity Mansion; kidney is the Hidden Prosperity Palace’s Great Harmony Mansion.

The true being said: If you wish to ascend as an immortal, you must summon the body and spirit.

---

## The Central Yellow Lord Lao said:

Since you know the names of the spirits hidden in the body, you should also know the Heavenly and Earthly parents and the child’s home, the five cities and twelve towers of true beings, secreted in the Supreme Clarity Mysterious Harmony Mansion, the cluster of heavens’ observatory.

Without the record of immortals, none see its chapters.

Master Luli orally transmitted the secret to Hua Ziqi.

If you wish to know the Heavenly and Earthly parents and child, it is the Three Ones.

Heaven One is beneath the Floral Canopy; Human One is at the Dipper’s door; Earth One is where the sun and moon roam.

The Three Ones shine like bright pearls; if you do not guard them, what do you seek in life?

Also, Earth One is where the sun and moon roam; Human One at the Dipper’s door; Heaven One beneath the Floral Canopy; primordial qi flutters and draws them together.

The divine turtle dwells in the center, poised and still.

If you wish to obtain it, ask me.

Where the One resides is not only guarding the male but also the female.

The One is formless and hard to know; if you do not know it, ten thousand things are lost.

As large as a chicken’s yolk, its color like sweet orange, half emerges, half returns.

If you can guard it, ten thousand things are complete.

The Three Ones are the three palaces on the body: head, heart, and navel.

Having known the Heavenly and Earthly parents and child’s home, the five cities and twelve towers of true beings, you must know to take the spirit elixir, golden liquid, sun-flowing pearl, and Taiyi, to surely become a person of the Three Heavens’ palaces.

If you do not take these Three Primes, you only suffer in vain.

---

## First, preserve the Five Beasts: Azure Dragon, White Tiger, Vermilion Bird, Mysterious Tortoise, and the Central Yellow Qilin.

These five beasts suddenly transform into mountains and forests.

Outside the four directions’ forests are immortal Tiger Guards and Feathered Forest Officers, each with eight faces.

Preserving them widely or narrowly as you wish, they can hide ten thousand people.

Second, summon the body’s spirits from head to foot, preserve their spirits, nourish their roots, circulate their qi, call their names, and you will surely obtain long life and immortality.

Third, guard Earth One, called the cinnabar field, bright white like clouds, where the Dao Mother dwells, in the water womb.

Fourth, guard Human One, called the Crimson Palace, Southern Pole Taiyi, the crimson child boy, right moon left sun, soul and spirit united.

Fifth, guard Heaven One, called the Purple Palace, as large as a chaotic chicken’s yolk, nine colors of mysterious yellow, intertwined with star charts, the body’s order and pattern.

Sixth, consume the spirit elixir, the sun’s essence.

Always on the first, third, fifth, seventh, ninth, and the half of the ninth month, the day of Jiazi and Bingwu.

Enter the chamber, close eyes, preserve the sun’s essence red qi, enter the mouth, swallow eighty-one breaths.

The true being said: Consuming the sun’s essence aligns with Heaven and Earth.

Seventh, consume the golden liquid, the mysterious water’s essence.

Always on the fifteenth day at midnight, enter the chamber, close eyes, preserve the moon’s essence pure white, enter the mouth, swallow forty-nine breaths.

The true being said: Consuming the moon’s essence thus leads to longevity.

Eighth, consume the star’s mysterious qi descending, blue, white, cinnabar, yellow.

Always use starry evenings and early nights, enter the chamber, close eyes.

In spring, preserve Jupiter’s essence blue qi, enter the mouth, swallow ninety breaths.

In summer, preserve Mars’ essence red qi, enter the mouth, swallow thirty breaths.

In autumn, preserve Venus’ essence white qi, enter the mouth, swallow seventy breaths.

In winter, preserve the Dragon Star’s essence black qi, enter the mouth, swallow fifty breaths.

On the second day of the four seasons’ months, preserve the town star’s essence yellow qi, enter the mouth, swallow twelve breaths.

The four seasonal months are the twelfth, third, sixth, and ninth months.

Use the second day of the month for this, looking inward to the essence heart, seeing your qi.

The true being said: Consuming star qi aligns with Heaven.

Ninth, perform the Supreme Ultimate purple cloud filling Heaven, ascending and descending, mixing chaos naturally.

This is called the eight festival days.

Enter the chamber, close eyes, look inward, preserve the purple qi in the mud pellet, which rises to Heaven; the red qi in the crimson palace, which rises to Heaven; the yellow qi in the cinnabar field, which rises to Heaven.

Suddenly, three boys descend from Heaven.

One boy wears purple robes, called the Guardian Brain True Being, descending from the purple qi directly into the mud pellet palace; the purple qi follows back to the brain’s gate.

One boy wears red robes, called the Guardian Heart Child, descending from the red qi directly into the crimson palace; the red qi follows back to the heart.

One boy wears yellow robes, called the Guardian Hidden Spirit, descending from the yellow qi directly into the cinnabar field; the yellow qi follows back to the navel gate.

These three boys supplement qi, remove evil, refine and rub blood and qi, command the soul to rest and the spirit to be steady, settle the heart and fill the vessels, make light flow and circulate, fill the pools of nectar.

After a long while, the body rests and receives, nourishes and replenishes; this is the power of the three boys guarding the body.

If you focus intensely, think to preserve the three palaces, heart full and gates open, the three boys suddenly fly back to Heaven, and the gates close.

The true being said: If you wish not to forget, carefully summon the heavenly boys.

The heavenly boys descend, riding the void as horses, guarding your body and spirit, thus becoming immortal.

If you do not preserve the spirit, the corpse and soul will rise and speak.

There are nine daos; those who practice live long.

The Bell Mountain true being transmitted this to Yu, to protect with Heaven, ascend to the mysterious mansion.

## Xia Yu’s Transmission to Bell Mountain True Being of Consuming Sun, Moon, and Stars

Hidden in the ruins of Dongting.

Consuming the sun’s essence grants long life, relying on ascending to Heaven to meet the Primordial.

Always on the first, third, fifth, seventh, ninth, and fifteenth days of the month, from sunrise to noon, consume first.

Think of the sun in your heart, with a mysterious canopy above, beneath which is a small boy pure red, red qi pervading inside and outside the body in nine layers.

Think of qi filling the head, exiting the crown, ascending to Heaven, circling the sun nine times.

Incantation:

“Sun Lord, primordial yang, return to the crimson palace, unite virtue with me, nurture the small boy.”

Think of the sun’s essence descending, entering the nostrils and mouth, swallowing for twenty-seven breaths, filling the heart.

In the heart are three persons: left is Taiyi Father, right is Mysterious Light Mother, center is the crimson child boy.

They sit on a golden forest jade couch, holding jade staff and cup, the cup filled with divine spirit wine and heavenly lingzhi grass.

Eating and drinking thus, hunger and thirst vanish, and you live long.

Consuming the moon’s essence can grant long life, relying on ascending to Heaven.

Always on the fifteenth day at midnight, bow twice facing the moon, chant:

“Moon Lord, primordial yin, return to the cinnabar field, unite virtue with me, nurture the small boy.”

Think of the moon’s white yellow essence descending, entering nostrils and mouth, swallowing for twenty-one breaths, stopping.

Moon essence rests at the kidney root, granting longevity.

Consuming the star’s essence ascends to Supreme Clarity.

Always at sunrise, feeding time, noon, and midnight, think of the North Pole Supreme Emperor star.

Incantation:

“Supreme Heaven, Supreme Emperor, Supreme Dao Lord, descendant of the small omen Jiahao who loves the dao, wishes to live long.”

Think of the star’s essence descending between the eyebrows, flowing into nostrils and mouth, swallowing for fifteen breaths, filling heart, gall, and spleen.

In the spleen is the Dao Mother, nurturing the red child, thus no hunger, long life.

## Numinous Treasure Consumption of the Five Lingzhi Essences

Lord Lao said: Pine grows a thousand years, its resin condenses to connect with spirit, descending into the earth, hiding names and changing surnames, abandoning origin to become great, rooting and forming shape, called Wei Xi, one character Fu Ling.

It repels soldiers and land sinking, entering deep darkness, neither hungry nor thirsty, sun and moon combined.

If you can consume it, you will gain long life.

Lord Lao said: Gou Shi nourishes the body, dwelling in form to restore youth, one character Hu Ma.

Born in Great Yuen, coming east across the pass, staying in the central land, cutting off barbarians.

Containing water’s essence, repelling wind and cold, named Ju Sheng, driving away evil and treachery.

Consuming it endlessly, living long with the world.

Ju Sheng and Wei Xi are kin, born in barbarian lands, able to harmonize spirit.

If you can consume it, you will gain long life.

Lord Lao said: Pepper grows in Shu Han, containing the qi of the Great Yin, born with Heaven and Earth, transforming and sinking into the land.

Thus it repels dampness, evil dares not invade, eats ghost gu poison, nothing is forbidden.

If you consume it regularly, desires are free, the world’s secret mysteries, its dao is profound, hidden and not disclosed, not worth ten thousand gold.

Lord Lao said: Ginger grows in the sun, same hometown as pepper, both from good soil, deep mountain valleys, firm and unmoving, relying on springs and containing the qi of Mars, guarding the soil’s root, facing yang and turning away from yin, enduring with the world.

Thus it repels dampness, cold turns warm, removes evil and cuts disease, closes ghost gates.

If you consume it regularly, lifespan is like Heaven and Earth.

Lord Lao said: Calamus grows in marshes, nearby deep pools, damp places, riverbanks, grows on high mountains, roots on stones, nine sections in one inch, called the spiritual body.

If obtained firmly, containing qi of ten thousand, it can generate people, preserve spirit, repel water and dampness, dislike ghosts and eliminate calamities.

Ghosts, demons, and monsters flee darkness; strong auspicious beings dare not approach.

Consuming it endlessly, lifespan reaches thousands of thousands.

Lezi Chang said: These five substances can be taken singly, enhancing qi and preserving years, extending essence and fixing the spirit.

Consuming them endlessly, living with the world.

Thus the *Classic of Filial Piety’s Divine Contract* says: Ginger and pepper enhance qi, calamus enhances wisdom, Ju Sheng extends years, Wei Xi repels soldiers.

This is Confucius’ secret words, the sage’s bright meaning.

Lord Lao observes Heaven and combines the five lingzhi herbs into elixir pills, preserving spirit and years, living long.

---

## Numinous Practical Formula of the Three Heavens

Lezi Chang’s writing.

Ju Sheng five parts, Wei Xi four parts, Shu Pepper one part, Dry Ginger three parts, Calamus three parts.

All taken fresh and good, refined and purified.

For the five substances, on auspicious days, a boy grinds the medicine, no substitution allowed.

Each treated differently, sifted finely, five thousand pestle strokes each.

Placed separately in red cups, five cups arranged on a red table, left overnight.

At dawn, the divine scales divide and combine according to law.

Mixed with white honey like white maltose, then pounded thirty thousand strokes more, formed into pills the size of a parasol seed.

At dawn, facing the sun, kneel long and swallow three pills, saying “long life, wish fulfilled.”

At dusk, enter and kneel facing west, swallow three pills again, as in the morning, as a regular practice.

Avoid raw fish, pork, and leeks; avoid seeing corpses, dogs, pigs, or childbirth.

Be cautious.

This is one dose.

If finished, combine again, adjusting dosage as desired, continuing for a whole year is best.

As for pestle count, all together about ten thousand strokes.

Mixing again is forty thousand strokes.

## Discerning Chrysanthemum and Yi

Chrysanthemum flowers and Yi flowers look alike; distinguish by sweetness and bitterness.

Chrysanthemum is sweet; Yi is bitter.

Now chrysanthemums exist but are few, mostly growing by water, most in Gou County and Li County.

True being said: Sun essence, rebirth, fullness, spirit essence, longevity—all are chrysanthemum, but root, stem, flower, and fruit have different names.

The explanation is beautiful, but recent consumption is mostly ineffective due to lack of true chrysanthemum.
