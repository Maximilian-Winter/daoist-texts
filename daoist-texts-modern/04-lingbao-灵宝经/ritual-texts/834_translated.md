## The Supreme Clarity Great Ultimate Hidden Commentary Jade Scripture Precious Secret

The Most High is profoundly subtle, the Three Caverns’ primal origin. Its words are deep and difficult to hear, lofty and mysterious like a dark crown, encompassing all myriad beings. The distant utmost virtue, majestic and exalted, fully providing a dwelling place—this is the gate of all wonders, the ancestral root of gods and immortals, gathered and formed into writing. Chanting ascends to the void, guiding dragons to ride the clouds; only with faith and utmost devotion can one master feelings and focus the mind.

Thus, those with aspiration journey afar to seek this scripture, reverently honoring the master, bowing before the hall of virtue, sincerely asking and consulting to receive the precious scripture. Do not violate or doubt; with true faith and correct dao, immortals can be expected. Spitting out the old and taking in the new, drawing from the essence of the heroic mushroom, the void calls and summons; flying immortals have their appointed time. The dharma wheel surely awakens, penetrating the nine cosmic layers—how remote and wondrous the secret! How could the middle immortals know?

Then the child of true learning, if able to meditate alone facing the scene, aligning with the elixir of feelings, refining and testing color and thought, enduring hunger and cold, bitter yet tireless—at midday taking nourishment, untroubled by slander, unjoyful at praise, possessing virtue within, outwardly indifferent to many faces—bathed in blue calamus, with fetal breath intact, ascending the fast and entering the chamber, burning incense of true sandalwood.

Then donning the cloak, cap, and kerchief, arranging the solemn ritual robes, setting the rites facing the south, submitting to the Most True, thrice bowing before the scripture. Opening the eight-colored aggregates, displaying the unsurpassed treasure trove, holding and reading the Great Cavern Profound Mystery, the revered scripture of Dao and Virtue, the eight simple hidden chapters, golden truth and jade light, dispelling demons and scattering spirits, summoning immortals to step into the void, flying along feathered scriptures, pure sounds soaring to the firmament, myriad true beings descending to the courtyard.

The Most High commands the carriage, riding together in the cloud chariot, lush and flourishing, merging with the distant obscurity. The three simples shine together, bearing the full radiance; the body wears silk robes, jade pendants, and fire bells. Solemn and lofty are the true ones, drifting afar on a distant expedition, jade blossoms supporting the wings, all ascending to Supreme Clarity. No question of noble or lowly, all depends on utmost sincerity. The Three Realms offer tribute; the demon kings respectfully receive. Long years without limit—who can know the kalpa’s length? Here, carefree and free, forever benefiting the upright.

## The Most High Jade Scripture Hidden Commentary Says:

**On bestowing the Dao and Virtue Scripture Method:**  
The master faces north, the scripture laid on the table. The disciple bows left; the master holds the scripture, the disciple upholds the dharma token. The master clicks the teeth thirty-six times, heart abiding in the three palaces: the Mud Pellet, the Elixir Field, the Crimson Palace—three united as one. A thousand chariots and ten thousand riders, the scripture master’s guards, then utters the blessing:

“Drifting in the great void ridge, flowing radiance above the profound mystery. The scripture begins without end kalpa, long preserving Heaven, Earth, and Man. The world’s sovereign learns to emulate Yao; the daoist chants to attain immortality. The worthy now receive and uphold the dharma, passing it on according to the method. When no child of utmost virtue appears, keep the secret and do not rashly proclaim. The lineage ascends to Supreme Clarity; to abandon it is to fall to the nine springs. I speak of the non-action dao, pure and tranquil virtue as nature. Finished.”  

The disciple thrice bows to receive the scripture. Female disciples bow right. All scriptures follow this.

## The Most High Jade Scripture Hidden Commentary Says:

**On bestowing the Great Cavern True Scripture Method:**  
The master faces north, scripture on the table, master holds scripture, disciple upholds dharma token. The master clicks teeth thirty-six times, heart abiding in the Most High Jade Emperor, commanding the sun and moon’s light to illuminate master and disciple, then utters:

“How vast and distant is the Great Subtlety! The true person forms the void and gives birth. The empty ford is the natural dao, gathered into the Great Cavern Scripture. The true and worthy uphold the dharma token, riding fate through the Yellow Court. The Most High erases the death register, managing the life book of immortals. Keeping secret through years and kalpas, releasing slackness in hellish infants. Calamities test the seven ancestors, wind blades dissolve your form. Finished.”  

The disciple thrice bows to receive the scripture.

## The Most High Jade Scripture Hidden Commentary Says:

**On bestowing the Most High Spiritual Treasure Profound Mystery Scripture Method:**  
The master faces north, scripture on the table, master holds scripture, disciple upholds dharma token. The master clicks teeth thirty-six times, heart abiding in the five viscera’s colors, commanding completeness, forming the treasure canopy cloud, covering master and disciple, then utters:

“Heaven’s book is simple, no vexation; dao and virtue are self-sufficient. Cultivating it surely leads to immortals—what more could one desire? The text shines beyond the utmost void, radiant and profound. Transmission follows the law; slackness leads to hell’s fall. Finished.”  

The disciple thrice bows, receiving the scripture. Then bows once to the Ten Directions, starting from north, turning east and circling. Imagining the Most High’s true form in all directions, now appearing.

---

## The Most High Jade Scripture Hidden Commentary Says:

**On bestowing the Most High Three Sovereigns Heavenly Writings:**  
The master faces north, scripture on the table, master holds scripture, disciple upholds dharma token. The master clicks teeth twenty-four times, heart abiding in the three palaces, each with a true person like a baby, unclothed, mouth exhaling purple qi, perfuming master and disciple, then utters:

“The Most High’s heavenly writings recount the beginning of Heaven and Earth. The august ones proclaim the profound decree—this is the supreme true book. The worthy are ordered to receive it, aspiring to ascend the Great Void.”  

Finished, disciple bows twice to receive the scripture.

---

## The Most High Jade Scripture Hidden Commentary Says:

**On transmitting the Supreme Clarity Pin Scripture Talismans, all facing north.**  
For the middle grade scriptures, there are external texts; the master faces east. The immortal saint descendants’ register, scripture transmitters face south; male disciples bow left, female disciples bow right. Dharma tokens bless and swear as the master’s method.

---

## The Most High Jade Scripture Hidden Commentary Says:

**When opening the Dao and Virtue Scripture aggregate, first burn incense, arrange ritual robes, bow as in the initial method, then utter:**

“Profound, profound, the ultimate dao’s root, supreme virtue embodies the vast primal. Heaven’s truth, though distant and wondrous, is near in the Mud Pellet Lord. Palaces all of seven treasures, windows naturally divided. Pure and tranquil, always attaining truth, riding radiance, mounting purple clouds. Sun and moon shine on left and right, ascending immortals long live complete. The seven ancestors ascend to Heaven, the world is the gate of dao and virtue. Thus one may read the scripture.”

---

## The Most High Jade Scripture Hidden Commentary Says:

**When opening the Great Cavern True Scripture aggregate, first burn incense, arrange ritual robes, bow as prescribed, then utter:**

“Subtle and profound is the mysterious gate, bright and penetrating the empty cavern. The ultimate dao arises from stillness and silence, revealing the three simple palaces. The great dao is formed here, harnessing radiance, riding cloud dragons. Left and right attend the scripture immortals, jade maidens and jade youths. The body crosses the undying ford, unbinds nets, follows the spiritual wind. The seven ancestors return to fetal birth, the world is the immortal sect.”

---

## The Most High Jade Scripture Hidden Commentary Says:

**When opening the Profound Mystery Scripture aggregate, first burn incense, arrange ritual robes, bow as prescribed, then utter:**

“Silent and utmost is the no-root sect, void stands a kalpa-high cliff. The profound mysterious text unfolds—who can fathom this distant mystery? Entering the great vehicle path, who counts the kalpas? Neither born nor dead, desire to live arises from the lotus. Transcending the Three Realms’ paths, compassionate heart unties worldly nets. True persons hold supreme virtue, generations become immortal families.”

---

## The Most High Jade Scripture Hidden Commentary Says:

**When opening the Three Sovereigns Heavenly Writings aggregate, first burn incense, arrange ritual robes, bow as above, then utter:**

“The Most High’s fixed spirit talisman commands fate, Heaven and Earth’s wisdom. Hearing the name, no need to wait for carriage; myriad immortals swiftly gather. Summoning spirits, no distinction of great or small—how could this be sullied? Pure fast, sever worldly affairs, silently facing the gods. Ascending to the Jade Clarity Palace, roaming feasts beyond the nine distant realms.”

---

## The Most High Jade Scripture Hidden Commentary Says:

**When reading the Dao and Virtue Scripture, click teeth thirty-six times, swallow saliva thirty-six times, first holding in mind the left Azure Dragon, right White Tiger, front Vermilion Bird, rear Black Tortoise, beneath the feet the eight trigrams, thirty-six divine turtles, lions crouching before, head kerchief with seven stars, five viscera generating five qi, net pattern covering the body, the three united attending the scripture, each with a thousand chariots and ten thousand riders, Heaven and Earth each guarded by eighteen thousand jade maidens and jade youths.**

---

## The Most High Jade Scripture Hidden Commentary Says:

**When reading the Great Cavern True Scripture, click teeth thirty-six times fully, swallow saliva thirty-six times, first holding in mind the returning wind mixed with the emperor of one hundred gods and ten thousand true beings, then chant the Cavern Scripture.**

---

## The Most High Jade Scripture Hidden Commentary Says:

**When reading the Profound Mystery Scripture, click teeth thirty-six times in a single burst, swallow saliva thirty-six times, hold in mind the five viscera’s five colors of qi, upper focusing on the five stars’ essence, then read the scripture.**

---

## The Most High Jade Scripture Hidden Commentary Says:

**When chanting the Most High Profound Mystery Stepping Void Scripture, first click teeth three times, swallow saliva three times, hold in mind the sun and moon upon one’s face, entering through the nostrils into the inner chamber of the Golden Flower Palace, light emerging from behind the nape, suddenly forming a nine-colored round image, thinly entering the jade pillow, illuminating the Ten Directions, following me far and wide, revolving and moving. The sun enters the left nostril, the moon the right nostril. Finished, click teeth again as at first.**

---

## The Most High Jade Scripture Hidden Commentary Says:

**When reading the Ascending Immortal Scripture, first click teeth twelve times, swallow saliva twelve times, chant one chapter, three times click teeth fully. Each scroll has its own method; if not recorded, one may follow this secret.**

---

## The Most High Jade Scripture Hidden Commentary Says:

The Dao scripture, if not received from a master, the spirit will not function. If the world lacks masters and registers, one should cast the dharma token into the place of tranquility, perhaps secretly opening to the mysterious master Laozi, bowing thrice facing north, then offering alms to the hungry and poor with equal heart, and thus use the scripture. If there is a master in the world, this method is not needed.

---

## The Most High Jade Scripture Hidden Commentary Says:

**Turning the scripture:** Sit on a small bed five feet high, equal in breadth and length, wearing only kerchief and cloak, no need for coarse garments. The Most High True Person reads the scripture in ritual robes, wearing a nine-light brocade cloak of silk, a cinnabar silk radiant kerchief, and lion-patterned shoes. Nowadays daoists read scriptures, diligent in ritual affairs, but their robes are coarse. On the day of attaining the dao, the Heavenly Emperor grants the child the nine-light silk cloak and heavenly treasure tassels flying immortal robes, rewarding past virtue. Do not envy worldly crowns and robes, abandon the daoist’s humble garments. Worldly dress, though honored now, cannot escape death; the daoist’s coarse robe and ritual dress ascend immortally, wearing heavenly garments. Heavenly garments on the body enable one to fly and ride the void.

---

## The Most High Jade Scripture Hidden Commentary Says:

The method of reading scripture uses the Central Xia sound—this is the correct sound of the Nine Heavens. The sixty-four Great Brahma Praise Scriptures chant and regulate tone, also the correct sound. When reading scripture, one should follow this correct sound. The Immortal Elder said: Laozi’s western transformation to the Hu lands taught foreigners to read scripture mostly in Great Brahma heavenly sounds, which suit daoists’ preferences.

---

## The Most High Jade Scripture Hidden Commentary Says:

After reading five hundred words of scripture, click teeth three full times, lick upper and lower lips with the tongue, swallow saliva three times, making one not exhausted; over time the voice becomes clear. Not knowing this method wastes qi and wears out the spirit. The True Person said: boil bamboo leaves into a drink, use it while reading scripture to preserve thought, enhancing essence, spirit, and harmonious qi flow.

---

## The Most High Jade Scripture Hidden Commentary Says:

The Most High Great Hidden Talismans number nine; at midday take them with water at once. After a thousand days, one enters and exits without interruption, invisibly present in the mind, becoming an immortal. Wearing the five spiritual treasure talismans on the body, one rides dragons and commands qi, passing through water and fire, aided by the Five Emperors’ wings, roaming afar and soaring high, also becoming immortal. Wearing the true forms of the Five Sacred Mountains and the great talismans of the Three Caverns, one must not approach chambers or engage in unclean unions; death is certain without doubt, and immortality is forever lost—how can one not be cautious?

---

## The Most High Jade Scripture Hidden Commentary Says:

Daoists entering chambers and fasting, reading the Most High Stepping Void Jade Chapter and the Flying Feathered Scripture, can gallop the Nine Dragons and be welcomed by cloud carriages. These two matters should be kept secret.

---

## The Most High Jade Scripture Hidden Commentary Says:

Constantly reading five thousand words ten thousand times, the Most High Cloud Dragon descends to welcome. After ten thousand times, if not yet departed, read thrice a month only; when the cloud carriage arrives, one ascends immortal.

---

## The Most High Jade Scripture Hidden Commentary Says:

Constantly reading the Yellow Court Inner Scene Scripture is to be undying. Constantly nourishing primordial qi is also the way of undying.

---

## The Most High Jade Scripture Hidden Commentary Says:

Always keep the head upright, blue as jade, hands like cinnabar, feet like snow. With this essence and thought read the scripture, perform wondrous deeds, and approach immortality. Always click teeth twelve times, day and night twelve hours, one click each hour, also undying in body, spirit always guarding.

---

## The Most High Jade Scripture Hidden Commentary Says:

Clicking teeth is called the Heavenly Drum, summoning body and spirit, calling heavenly truth, gathering myriad immortals. Left teeth knocking is called sounding the Heavenly Bell; right teeth knocking is called striking the Heavenly Chime. Daoists fearing ghosts and thieves sound bell and chime each twenty-four times; then evil spirits dare not approach, heavenly demons protect the body, and a hundred blessings arrive.

---

## The Most High Jade Scripture Hidden Commentary Says:

Laozi’s *Dao and Virtue Scripture* says: “Seen but unseen, heard but unheard, grasped but unattainable”—these are the titles of the Three Primal Elder Lords. It also says: these three cannot be questioned, thus mixed as one. The three simples unite as the Primal One Lord, the mysterious father and mother of the fetal honored. Reading this scripture, the Three Elder Lords see the child, the child sees them, and the immortal dao is fulfilled. The dao ends here; the scripture does not fully speak, words do not fully express meaning. The subtle principle is unsurpassed in this writing; to say one sees it is not to truly know it.

---

## The Most High Jade Scripture Hidden Commentary Says:

Kunlun, Penglai, Zhong Mountain, Songgao, Wangwu—Supreme Clarity scriptures also have these.

---

## The Most High Jade Scripture Hidden Commentary Says:

In the land of Narawei, the Kunlun people’s Bird Mountain, ruled separately by the Primordial Heavenly King, with seven treasure palaces and high terraces reaching the sky. The Queen Mother of the West first studied the dao here, also ascending this mountain. The Three Caverns scriptures are all complete here, written as scriptures in the void, one character one zhang square in size. The true form map of this mountain is most precious; wearing it grants the Three Caverns’ profound truth. The mountain’s beasts all can fly and live forever—how much more humans? All marvelous things emerge here. The mountain’s many saints chant scriptures in Great Brahma heavenly sounds, neither sorrowful nor mournful, neither slow nor fast, grand and elegant, heard by all melting into one. On Kunlun Mountain, many immortals chant Central Xia and Nine Heavens, desolate and far-reaching, pure and clear sounds, listeners transcend emotion. When the immortals gather, singing the Profound Mystery, reading in unison, new voices striking and resonant, deep and distant, raising brilliance in the void, strings sounding and plucking, and Jade Clarity is moved with joy. Reading scriptures is what the Most True greatly values. *The High Terrace Inscription* says: “If you wish to ride the void and soar the empty, chant my Stepping Profound Feathered Scripture.” Immortals do not understand these words. The Stepping Profound and Feathered Scriptures are these two books; the Most High Profound Scripture is not passed to middle immortals.

---

## The Great Ultimate True Person Says:

The Stepping Void Scripture is the Lingbao fasting stepping profound chant. The Feathered Scripture is the Great Cavern’s chant.

---

## The Most High Jade Scripture Hidden Commentary Says:

At home studying the dao, one should receive five thousand words. On the new moon and full moon, on one’s birth day, on the eight seasonal festivals, at midday and midnight, recite once each time. If one cannot read, ask a master to read; the disciple should personally attend incense and offerings, wholeheartedly listening and receiving the scripture’s meaning, intending to practice the scripture’s wondrous matters. Entrusting form to the Moon of the Great Yin, the Heavenly Emperor’s cloud carriage welcomes the body and spirit, bypassing Mount Tai’s Three Officials’ hellish punishments. Born above in Heaven’s Emperor’s presence, born below in a noble family. Appearance complete, spirit radiant, observers’ hearts rejoice; just by seeing and hearing, even a woman turns to a man, forming bonds with Supreme Clarity; the immortal dao naturally succeeds. This scripture passes through all ranks, no great or small, whatever one seeks, no hindrance. Sending off death and nurturing life, nothing is unsuitable. It can also pacify nations and calm peoples, subdue border barbarians, all following the dao. This scripture is wondrous indeed, none surpass it.

---

## The Most High Jade Scripture Hidden Commentary Says:

Though scholars cultivate good deeds, sometimes afflicted by past life’s troubles, illness and calamity, often weary and troubled, daoist masters should hold fast, recite five thousand words, and dispel demons with wisdom from the Jade Clarity Golden Truth Profound Mystery Scripture, middle grade mighty spirits, guarding and aiding the sick—this is called rescuing the distressed and obtaining aid. No method surpasses this dharma wheel.

---

## The Most High Jade Scripture Hidden Commentary Says:

Receiving the Three Caverns Scriptures, one must sever worldly affairs and practice accordingly. The Three Caverns altogether are called the Most High Great Cavern One, the highest scripture. If three people share these words, none may ascend immortal. Be cautious, very cautious.

---

## The Most High Jade Scripture Hidden Commentary Says:

Receiving scriptures, all words are checked thrice; one mistaken character shortens lifespan by one year; beyond this, add or subtract one character, also losing one year. If one rashly breaks scripture books, future lives face the wind blade’s form-dissolving test. Receiving scripture without reverence for the master, cultivation brings no blessing; future lives suffer illness and become among the six beasts. The world’s greatest evil is the yin thief; if one cooperates with this dao, surely one faces worldly tests: deafness, blindness, heart and nose blocked, stomach fluids obstructed, body infested with worms, death falling into hell, enduring all suffering—mountain of knives, sword trees, boiling, swallowing fire, orifices rotting, seeking death but unable, finally born as swine or dog, then slaughtered—these are the three great evils.

---

## The Most High Jade Scripture Hidden Commentary Says:

From the middle grade scriptures downward, face east, click teeth twelve full times, blessing thus:

“Solemn and pure is the Most True virtue, erasing traces, halting idle leisure. Radiant brightness ascends the Great Simple, coming and going without crossing the ford. With heart, it naturally responds; without exclusive dao, it is continuous. Passing and transmitting to bind fate in darkness. Masters and disciples, no garments but become kin. Upholding scripture and practicing good, always as if facing a deep abyss. Outwardly saving disasters and illness, inwardly protecting and ferrying the body. Finished, bow to receive scripture transmission. Immortals’ original work also uses this spell method.”

---

## The Most High Jade Scripture Hidden Commentary Says:

The Great Cavern True Scripture is also called the Most True Dao Scripture, or the Supreme Clarity Highest Daoist Heaven Internal Scripture, highest grade, ten scrolls. Supreme Clarity Golden Elixir Scriptures number seven scrolls. The highest, most wondrous, great elixir dispelling demons and wisdom Great Cavern True Scripture has thirty-nine chapters.

---

## The Most High Jade Scripture Hidden Commentary Says:

Supreme Clarity’s highest purpose, the utmost subtle words, the wondrous scripture of flying immortals. The Lingbao Scripture, also called Profound Mystery, or the Most High Ascending Profound Scripture, all are highest grade of high immortals, utmost truth of emptiness, the hidden treasure of the great dao. The Three Sovereigns Heavenly Writings, also called Profound Spirit, or Profound Immortal, or Most High Jade Strategy. These Three Caverns Scriptures and Talismans are the dao’s framework, the Great Void’s mysterious lineage, the Most True’s foremost scripture. How could middle immortals hear of this?

---

## The Most High Jade Scripture Hidden Commentary Says:

The precious secret is the ancestor of all scriptures. The Most High commands transmission to the Great Ultimate Immortal Lords, Immortal Kings, Immortal Elders, Immortal Ministers. Without receiving this charge, it is not transmitted. Daoists who see this book must be destined to be Immortal Lords; the mysterious register and ancestral names will be fixed. Transmit with dharma token, gold five taels, white silk ninety feet, scripture paper length three hundred sheets, presented to the Dao master lord; then one knows the essence of seeking dao with utmost sincerity, and may be told this precious secret. The master and disciple first fast in pure fasting nine days, or seven, five, three days; at midday receive the scripture. When transmitting scripture, master faces north in a quiet chamber, left hand requests scripture, holding it; disciple’s right hand upholds the dao oath token, pledging not to rashly leak to the mundane. Written oath: with the seven ancestors as witnesses, will uphold benevolence, filial piety, and great compassion, only wishing to fly immortal and ascend the void, the seven ancestors freed from suffering and poison, all born in Heaven. After the master finishes reading, utters blessing to disciple:

“Great simplicity originally without substance, sages call it profound. The two forces from beginning to end, the ultimate abyss of all things. Dao’s transformation spans countless kalpas, cycling round like a circle. Subtle principle returns without forgetfulness, dark meditation responds to past fate. Great awakening and supreme wisdom, none surpass this dharma wheel. Aspiring to dao, following dharma token, sincerely obeying master’s proclamation. When no worthy and accomplished person appears, seal it on a famous mountain, conform and transmit by chance, hold the stone to cross the nine springs. The child is the Great Ultimate Lord, highest honored commands me to transmit. The Three Realms report and open, the mysterious capital is heard at once.”  

Finished, six bows, taking the dharma objects in pairs. The master then arranges scripture ritual fasting and vows, giving alms to the world’s poor with a first-class heart, no partiality. This scripture always has thirty jade maidens and thirty jade youths attending, also inspecting the daoist’s virtue, reporting to the Most High. One must be cautious, very cautious. When crossing scripture, hold in mind the Three Primal Lords in the Mud Pellet Palace. The master clicks teeth thirty-six times, then blesses.

---

Hidden Commentary on the Dao Scripture ends here.

---

## The Great Ultimate True Person Says:

All true persons have long followed their own cultivation, separately receiving their secret formulas, not all at once. Thus immortals each have their own transmission of this matter. Partial transmissions use dharma tokens with one tael of gold, one hundred sheets of paper, no plain silk needed, keeping blessings as above.

---

## The Great Ultimate True Person Says:

The immortals’ original work transmission is called the Dao Trace Scripture. The dharma must be received from the master, facing west, using blessings from many scriptures, with cinnabar silk ten feet, exemplifying utmost sincerity. The upper immortals’ dao scripture holds ten jade maidens and jade youths, middle immortals five, lower immortals three, always attending and transmitting, burning incense and protecting the disciple’s body and family. Always be loyal and filial, revering the master, practicing the four levels of heart, enduring insult and striving, giving and accepting faults, not contending or boasting, guarding intention and will, remembering dao and constant aspiration, soaring on great clarity wings, flying to the upper mystery, supporting high immortals—this is the key passage of learning dao. If able to receive the Most High hidden commentary secret words and practice the Great Cavern scriptures, one is called the Most High Great Dharma Master. Those who have received the Three Caverns Scriptures are called the Most High Profound Scripture Great Dharma Masters; the master naturally receives and transmits the Immortal Dao Trace Scripture. Without receiving this Dao Trace Scripture from a master, jade maidens will not protect one; practicing dao is of no benefit to the body. When afflicted by illness or evil spirits, one may fast and chant the Dao Trace Scripture in quiet places; all ghosts and evil spirits and calamities respond and disperse. Jade maidens and jade youths sing praises, their voices heard in the Nine Mysteries; these immortals rejoice and save the disciple.

---

## The Great Ultimate True Person Says:

Since the kalpa’s beginning, Chisongzi, Wang Qiao, Xianmen, Xuanyuan, Yinzi have all received five thousand words hidden commentary secrets, diligently practicing the great dao. Among the true persons’ elders, this is the essential secret. By the time of Emperor Xiaowen of Han, who loved the *Dao and Virtue Scripture*, with utmost sincerity and emptiness, the Most High True Person descended at the river to transform Emperor Wen. The True Person recited scriptures; the emperor had not yet widely promulgated the subtle dao principles. Thirsting in heart, hearing of a strange man leaping forth, he personally drove to bow and ask about movement and stillness, consulting the true dao. The True Person explained some verses, clarifying what was stuck. This scripture’s subtlety is difficult to fathom, thus said to be beyond thought and discussion. Yet it was enough for Emperor Wen to entrust publication to the heavens and underworld, riding radiance on clouds, loosening reins to flying dragons, directly ascending the Golden Flower Palace of Heaven, and various celestial beings lecturing and chanting—also a secondary immortal dao. How joyful! Emperor Wen practiced the *Dao and Virtue Scripture*, achieving greatness. Emperor Wu only labored in immortality but had a stern nature, also obtaining a secondary celestial rank. Learning dao is based on gentleness and faith. Reading a chapter of the River True Person thus penetrates the Most High Jade Capital; celestial immortals cross hands praising; voices transmit through the Three Realms; demon kings respectfully bow in the hall; Fengdu reverently salutes the master. The River True Person is the *Dao and Virtue Scripture*’s dharma master, thus revering his verses. The secret dao of body cultivation cannot be shown to the mundane; mundane people often mock this scripture as empty and absurd, saying it cannot ascend immortals or save the world. This is due to past fate, not to be forced. Teaching without practice brings mutual blame; thus it should be kept deep and secret.

---

## The Great Ultimate True Person Says:

When venerating this scripture, mind the Most High Laozi, bow thrice; next recall Master Yin and River True Person as mysterious dharma masters, also bow thrice, facing the scripture. Always thirty-six thousand immortal youths and jade maidens attend the scripture, burning incense and scattering flowers, communicating to all immortals, petitioning for the disciple’s undying fate, seeking the way to ascend to heaven in broad daylight.

---

## The Great Ultimate True Person Says:

When a daoist is creating the Golden Elixir, recite it day and night; the Great One rejoices, coming to the child’s chamber. Repelling ghosts and testing inauspicious changes, what is made surely succeeds.

---

## The Great Ultimate True Person Says:

Learning dao is founded on fasting and purification. Reciting scripture must be done fasting; checking scripture must be fasting; writing scripture must be fasting; writing talismans must be fasting; compounding medicines must be fasting; making the Golden Elixir must be fasting; focusing thought must be fasting; visiting masters to ask must be fasting; bowing must be fasting; receiving scripture must be fasting; healing illness and dispelling calamity must be fasting; summoning true persons must be fasting. Fasting is what the Most High reveres, Laozi protects, and all saints rely on. The fasting methods are many, practiced by the disciple receiving this.

---

## The Great Ultimate True Person Says:

I once learned dao, hearing this teaching from the Most High True Person, faithfully practicing it, now passing it on. You keep it secret and cultivate it; secretly teach future generations with past fate who respond to the upper immortals—may it be so.

---

## The Great Ultimate True Person Says:

Those born into the gate of immortals and saints, who love dao and delight in scripture, gentle in nature and compassionate in heart, all have past fate wishing to meet today. Approaching immortality, they should diligently attend ritual affairs, surely becoming upper immortals.

---

## The Great Ultimate True Person Says:

Those with immortal true appearance and good nature must have compassion touching all things, to assist the appearance; then one attains immortality. Unable to endure nature and tolerate faults, the immortal appearance is ruined. Believe these words. You must be cautious, think on this, and uphold it; these words are utmost.

---

## The Great Ultimate True Person Says:

I have the Nine Heavens Yellow Simple Hidden Secrets, transmitted to people. Sometimes called Great Cavern True Demeanor, or Dharma Wheel Original Framework Scripture Most High Hidden Secret, or Most High Jade Clarity Inner Teaching, or Most High Three Caverns Demeanor Scripture, or Most High Jade Scripture Great Ultimate Hidden Commentary Secret. Transmitted to those with past fate responding to the Most High Jade Capital Mysterious Capital Great Void Great Ultimate Immortal Lords, Immortal Kings, Immortal Elders, Immortal Ministers. Not told to beginners. If one meets a scripture master in the world, the Mysterious Capital already has a golden name tablet.

---

## The Great Ultimate True Person Says:

Upholding the upper scripture, daoists must have heart and mouth in accord; see others as oneself, revere masters as father, think of scripture as thirst, remember to aid the distressed, admonish and encourage good, be gentle and tolerant of faults, love those with dao, avoid fondness for mountains and waters, always practice compassion, benevolence, and care. Daoists living in honor do not pride themselves; amid illness and hardship, hold firm resolve. Such one may speak of dao. Tell them the hidden commentary. If adorned with fine appearance but heart and mouth differ, keep secret in the precious secret, forever hidden. After three years receiving scripture, conduct can be observed and known. Therefore this scripture is secret to upper immortals; middle immortals rarely see it. Those who have not cultivated merit in past lives cannot widely spread the great law; the Most High Mysterious Capital Jade Capital has no named record, and will never meet this scripture master. If one rashly reveals the secret to one person, one cannot ascend immortal, dies as a low ghost, suffers in the Three Officials’ hells, future lives with six illnesses, revolving and facing tests; the sin is grave. Thus it is secret and called hidden commentary.

---

## The Great Ultimate True Person Says:

Those who fast long and quietly, focusing thought and indulging in mystery, reciting scripture to repent sins, burning incense and bowing, will see flying celestial beings. Immortal youths and jade maidens descend to the disciple’s chamber. Sometimes hearing praise in the chamber, or light shining on the body, or sounds of gold and jade, eight-tone music—all signs the disciple’s dao is about to succeed. Diligently, diligently; the Most High will not fail you. The trouble is your instability, not fully mastering the scripture; thus immortal dao is difficult. Always remember these words.

---

## The Great Ultimate True Person Says:

When I first attained immortality, I received the Most High Great Dao Lord Great Wisdom Scripture, reciting it seven times, clicking teeth three times, swallowing saliva three times, holding the three simples primal lords in the Golden Flower Palace, like a baby, and chanting this text. The Wisdom Scripture has thirty-one thousand one hundred words; the supreme sage compiled this chapter, meant for the Most High Jade Capital Great Ultimate Immortal Lords and daoists. Now I tell you—do you not wish to hear it?

---

## The Most High Wisdom Scripture Praise

The Most High Profound Void Sect, spreading dao and honoring its scripture. Looking up and down, already attaining immortality, enduring countless kalpas. Majestic Most True virtue, silent arising from non-being. Sky radiance forms empty structure, riding the void naturally proceeding. Sun and moon blaze bright, peaceful joy unending.

Learning immortality, abandoning worldly thoughts, thought upon thought accumulates. Coming and going disturb my spirit, restless spirit endures all. Extinguish thought, halt idle leisure, desolate entering empty silence. Request scripture as if hungry and thirsty, holding resolve like metal and stone. Protect the child’s flying mysterious path, five spirits crossing talisman registers.

Aid my six perfections’ practice, thus able to untie the three nets. Pure fasting honors the Great Simple, breathing out and in nourishes cloud teeth. Carefree within the Golden Pavilion, Jade Capital is my home. Naturally producing seven treasures, everyone sits on lotus flowers.
