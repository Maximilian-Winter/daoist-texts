## Supreme Profound Cavern Numinous Treasure True Text Essential Explanation, Upper Scripture

**Received by the Great Master of High Mystery**

At the Supreme Numinous Treasure’s governance of the Profound Capital, Jade Capital Mountain, the Seven Treasures Profound Terrace, the Most True Ones of the Ten Directions, spontaneously and marvelously moving, the Perfected Persons, the Great Saints of the Flying Immortals—all float in the air, burning incense and scattering blossoms, circling one day thrice around, hands grasping the Ten Ultimate Floral Banners, mouths chanting the Profound Chapters.

As sun and moon revolve and intertwine, the Seven Stars operate their gates; in three hundred and thirty days, the Heavenly Gate returns the mountain by one degree; in three hundred and thirty degrees, the Nine Heavens’ energies mingle; in three thousand three hundred degrees, Heaven and Earth’s energies merge. This merging of Heaven and Earth’s energies marks the minor kalpa’s convergence; at nine thousand nine hundred degrees, the great kalpa completes its cycle. At this moment, Heaven sinks and Earth is submerged; the Nine Seas become one vast abyss; gold and jade dissolve and vanish; the proud and the humble alike are no more.

Yet Heaven and Earth endure unshaken because the Primordial Origin commanded the Five Elders, the Supreme True Ones, to seal the Numinous Treasure True Texts within the caverns of the Five Sacred Mountains. This was to pacify spirits, stabilize numinous powers, govern the river of fate, and prevent the great springs from flooding forth, halting great calamities. This is the text of nature itself; hence it is called the Numinous Treasure Nine Heavens Upper Scripture, unknown to ghosts and gods.

Those who possess this text will protect their country and bring peace to their homes; ten thousand disasters shall not strike. Those who master its methods, at the great kalpa’s turning, will soar like swans on high wings, tread the flying firmament, and float in empty space. The ancient tradition, issued once in forty thousand kalpas, grants names inscribed on golden tablets to those destined to be Perfected Persons in future lives.

The Supreme Primordial Numinous Treasure Five Scrolls of True Texts were formerly stored in the Supreme Profound Terrace’s Seven Treasures Upper Palace. The Heavenly Scriptures are profound and mysterious, impossible to fully seek or explain; their words shine brilliantly, illuminating the Supreme Clarity. The Five Elders stand guard, the Supreme Emperor attends the Perfected Ones, Jade Maidens hold their scarves, Golden Boys raise incense smoke, burning the hundred blended fragrant offerings, their aroma flowing through the Purple Court.

They exhale the sun’s essence to dispel filth, scatter the moon’s brilliance to brush away dust. Divine lamps shine brightly, candles blaze in unison, golden winds blow from eight directions, auspicious clouds array in four formations. Phoenixes and dragons wail mournfully, their howls resound harmoniously; flying dragons and venomous beasts fully guard the Jade Palace. Ten thousand emperors bow their heads, circling the Upper Palace, flying through empty space, chanting the Profound Chapters.

They praise the numinous mysteries of the Nine Heavens, rejoice in the treasures of the Three Heavens, truly the wondrous weight of the Profound Texts, their merit and virtue towering in the vastness of the cosmos.

Therefore, the Primordial Origin’s recorded chapters list twelve virtues to exalt the treasure in the Heavenly Truth and mark the inexhaustible profundity of the numinous texts:

1. Its virtue is like emptiness and non-being, pure, profound, silent, serene, detached, natural—root of Heaven and Earth.  
2. Its virtue is like the great dao, vast and formless, the source of divine illumination; all things universally receive its accomplishment.  
3. Its virtue is like Heaven, clear and vast, covering all, floating high in the Supreme Clarity; all things universally receive its generation.  
4. Its virtue is like Earth, expansive and nurturing life, embracing without detail; all things receive its heavy bearing.  
5. Its virtue is like sun and moon, bright and illuminating, penetrating all darkness; all things receive its gentle favor.  
6. Its virtue is like the myriad stars, shining over the heavens, brightening the obscure; all things universally receive its light.  
7. Its virtue is like clouds and rain, harmonizing Heaven and moistening Earth, widely bestowing flow and grace; all things universally receive its beneficent spray.  
8. Its virtue is like the four seasons, turning the yin and yang wheels, regulating the solar terms peacefully; all things universally receive its nurturing life.  
9. Its virtue is like Mount Tai, embracing, obstructing, awe-inspiring and potent; the Five Emperors peacefully govern, and immortals dwell there.  
10. Its virtue is like the great rivers, soft and flowing, beneficent to all directions, not discriminating against the impure or lowly, embracing all without exception.  
11. Its virtue is like the True Teaching, guiding the Three Vehicles, enduring long, opening the Dharma gates, universally aiding all beings.  
12. Its virtue is like the divine person, saving the dying and protecting life, causing cold ashes to smoke, revealing the profound teaching, universally ferrying the heavenly folk.

The numinous texts’ wondrous weight arises from nature itself; thus their supreme virtue is marked to honor their truth. The five numinous texts are the roots of Heaven and Earth, transforming and generating the Five Elders, overseeing the Five Stars above, guarding the Five Sacred Mountains below, directing the Five Phases, connecting to the five viscera of humans, stabilizing qi and nurturing spirits, protecting the country and calming the home, enabling the sovereign’s flourishing, preventing ten thousand disasters, and halting the flood’s surge.

Once the numinous texts appear, Heaven’s longevity is assured. The Primordial Origin’s intention is subtle and profound. Now, therefore, I inform you secretly: diligently cultivate and recite, and the dao will naturally respond.

The Supreme Great Dao Lord said: To bind fate with the dao, unbroken through generations, bringing good fortune and blessings in future lives, one must fulfill the twelve supreme vows, universally ferry all beings, bring peace to the nation, prosperity to the household, flourishing descendants, and wise sages to arise; seven ancestors ascend to Heaven, turning the wheel of the blessed hall. This merit is lofty and weighty; diligently practice it.

1. Wish the great dao to be serene, empty, and void, peaceful and quiet, clear and self-possessed; widely open the Dharma gates, teaching the stubborn so all may be blessed with understanding; diligently cultivate with earnestness, preparing to ascend together, universally attaining the void, preserving Heaven and enduring without worry; all beings live in harmony and peace.  
2. Wish the heavens’ energies to be clear and pure, vast and covering, preserving truth and stabilizing numinous power; regulating climate and seasons harmoniously; the nation peaceful and the people prosperous; all under Heaven at ease; widely aiding all beings, bestowing blessings to all life; preserving the kalpa’s longevity, unshaken for billions of eons.  
3. Wish the Earth’s soil to bear endlessly, stable and unyielding, seas not collapsing, preserving peace and national stability; people flourishing, nurturing life and peaceful death; blessings spreading to the Ten Directions; crops planted and abundant; nurturing life and full harvests; embracing virtue and bearing deeply; all wishes fulfilled.  
4. Wish the sun and moon’s two lights to shine brightly, without eclipse or waning, peacefully illuminating the heavens; dispelling darkness and gloom; preserving the kalpa’s cycle; the world’s reign peaceful; universally bestowing grace and moisture to all beings.  
5. Wish the stars to shine with the sun and moon, revolving and illuminating, brightening the Ten Directions; each in its place, orderly and straight; preserving peace and national stability; no disasters; the four seas united; all under Heaven flourishing.  
6. Wish the four seasons to follow their cycles, climate harmonious and regulated; no disasters; epidemics eliminated; all under Heaven peaceful; grains abundant; the nation wealthy and people joyful.  
7. Wish the floating clouds to gather energies and smoke, soaring high and clear, shading the profound; hidden, they are non-action; scattered, they fill the heavens; immortals ride together, gathering the many true ones; blessings flow to all; the nation prospering and loving its people; universally ferrying all beings; all sharing the kalpa’s years.  
8. Wish the wind and rain to pour endlessly, widely bestowing and flowing; receiving their growth and spread; all things nurtured; the nation’s granaries full and people prosperous.  
9. Wish the Five Sacred Mountains to each rest in their places, towering and embracing; forever immortal palaces; stabilizing the nation’s fate; preserving Heaven without end; protecting and ferrying all; none failing to revere the ancestral lineage.  
10. Wish the rivers and seas to flow boundlessly, embracing and vast; no detail left unfilled; deep, soft, and beneficent; moistening all movement and breath; Heaven and humans rejoicing; years matching the kalpa’s stone.  
11. Wish the sovereigns’ lands to prosper daily; the four quarters peaceful and secure; no warfare; the heavenly folk singing; auspicious signs arriving; teachings widely spread and aiding; mighty transformations vast; the people praising and celebrating; long-lasting joy without end.  
12. Wish all creeping and flying creatures, born and unborn, to be fully perfected; universally generated; all filled with primordial qi; receiving the form of yang; grasses, trees, and fruits; enduring winter without withering; all aided and ferried; none not flourishing.

These twelve great vows were formerly issued in the Primordial Origin’s Five Scrolls of Wisdom Scripture. The great compassion of the Numinous Treasure’s dao bestows blessings and plants seeds of merit, binding causes for humanity; its merit is vast and its reward beyond measure. This supreme blessing’s highest work merits the heavens’ response. Those who see this method should immediately follow nature, diligently cultivating and practicing, to gain immortality beyond birth and death.

---

The Supreme Great Dao Lord said: I once received this from the Primordial Heavenly King, who commanded me to teach the Immortal Lords, Immortal Kings, and Immortal Ministers, the Supreme Clarity Perfected Ones, but not to pass it to the middle immortals. Without the Profound Diagram Imperial Tablet, jade-named Supreme Clarity, one cannot see or hear it. Those entangled in defilement and arrogance, even if they see it, do not diligently practice it. The Nine Heavens’ forbidden scriptures are transmitted once every forty thousand kalpas.

Those who cultivate and study but do not practice this method will not build merit; their thoughts lack thorough response; true numinous spirits do not descend; good affinities are severed; the path of blessings is lost; how can immortality ever be attained? The true learner must regularly fast, burn incense, perform morning rites, then face east and make vows, heart and mouth in accord, with no divergent thoughts. This will summon the Profound Truths from the void, sit to seek numinous blessings from nature, rescue the seven ancestors from dark prisons, raise the impoverished souls to the southern palace, protect the family and nation from calamity, and avert heavenly disasters in peaceful years. This blessing is lofty and vast, difficult to fully declare.

Thus, the Numinous Treasure’s natural Five Scrolls of Spirit-Guarding Incantations are spoken:

---

### East

Nine energies of the azure heavens, bright star great deity. Radiantly illuminating the eastern lands, revealing the nine gates. Revolving torches raise light, sweeping away filth and dust. The Enlightened Child opens the way, fully guarding my pavilion. Capturing demons and restraining heretics, facing the imperial lords above. Upholding the true dao, red script jade text. Nine Heavens’ talismanic decree, commanding dragon messengers. Universal peace and stability; I attain flying immortality.

---

### South

Southern cinnabar heavens, three energies flowing light. The glowing star revolves its torch, illuminating the sun. Above is the red essence, the Enlightened Spirit Child. Commanding fire soldiers, guarding the three palaces. Cutting off evil and restraining heretics, intercepting demons and misfortune ahead. The Northern Emperor’s mandate, wind and fire in eight assaults. Flowing bells intertwine radiance; dare none disobey. The true dao circulates; I enjoy supreme merit. Protect Heaven’s enduring existence; endless kalpas without end.

---

### West

Seven energies of the heavens, Venus flowing essence. Bright shining golden gate, illuminating the great darkness. Within is the White Emperor, called the Spirit of the Emperor. Protecting spirits and stabilizing, guarding my form. Severing and cutting off evil sources, jade dao’s true clarity. Palaces orderly and solemn, the three lights aligned. Dao harmonizes with nature, ascending to the Purple Court. Numinous Treasure talismanic decree, universally benefiting all beings. Merit adds to all; Heaven and Earth are peaceful.

---

### North

Northern Profound Heaven, five energies wandering. The star of the time shines brilliantly, illuminating the Great Subtle. Black Spirit honored deity, flying in mysterious feathered robes. Fully guarding the five gates, inspecting essence and capturing falsehood. Dare any interfere or test? They shall be struck down and shattered. Jade talisman commands, divine truths with eight powers. Evil gates closed, the true dao clearly opened. Illuminating my form, the three lights shine together. Riding the void, driving the floating, raising form to immortal flight.

---

### Center

Yellow center regulating qi, commanding the profound truth. Stabilizing stars and emitting radiance, flowing brilliance through the Nine Heavens. Enlightening children, twelve in number. Primordial qi and yang essence, burning red smoke above. Illuminating all under Heaven and my ministers’ forms. Crushing hundreds of evils, slaying ten thousand ghosts. Central Mountain divine incantation, universally effective. Five spirits stabilize and guard; body flies to ascend immortality.

---

The Supreme Great Dao Lord said: These natural Five Scrolls of Spirit-Guarding Incantations were formerly issued in the upper scroll of the Numinous Treasure Five Texts. They restrain demons, summon spirits, command myriad gods, stabilize the Five Sacred Mountains, protect Heaven’s enduring existence, clarify the principles of the three lights, bring peace to the nation, bless the people, and ferry all beings.

I once received them from the Primordial Heavenly King, commanded to transmit according to the Profound Method once every forty thousand kalpas. The son’s position ascends to high immortality, commanding the Three Realms, governing myriad spirits. Now I inform you: choose those worthy, who must accord with the Profound Diagram, transmit according to the method. Whoever wishes to cultivate the dao, seek immortality and truth, secure the nation and home, and cut off all misfortune, must reverently practice the natural Spirit-Guarding Incantations.

Always on your fate day, the Tai Sui day, the Jiazi and Gengshen days, and fasting days, face east and recite them once; then the spirits will be bright and qi correct, the palace and residence purified, evil demons destroyed, the Five Elders descending truly, myriad trials subdued, evil disasters destroyed. With long fasting and recitation, one can become a Perfected Person.

---

The Supreme Great Dao Lord told the Great Master of High Mystery: Those who enter my dao gate aspire first to the immortals, soaring through the azure heavens. Next, they wish for family and nation’s peace, to cross over ten thousand sufferings, dispel disasters and eliminate calamities, seek blessings and grace. First, cultivate the Numinous Treasure’s natural Five Scrolls, fast eight times to repent sins, confess to the Ten Directions.

Above, resolve heavy karmic faults from past lives; below, resolve the accumulated offenses of this body. Diligently practice fasting and uprightness, widely build fields of merit, save all beings, cherish the dying and protect life. When merit is complete and virtue universal, then the dao heart is united; evil will self-extinguish, good affinities arise in future lives. The household is orderly; all wishes fulfilled. Divine truths descend mysteriously; sitting, one attains flying immortality. This is the foundation of governance and the source of seeking the dao.

Without this method, study is vain and spirit wasted; old roots remain unresolved; hope for the dao is faint; until old age no gain is had; disasters do not cease. The great dao is vast and compassionate; pity is in my heart. Now therefore I inform you: diligently cultivate and practice. I once received this from the Primordial Heavenly King, who commanded me to keep it secret in the Supreme Numinous Capital’s Upper Hall, to be issued once every forty thousand kalpas. You now must follow the old method of the former masters; if there are true learners, record their names on golden tablets; if their conduct accords with the immortals, you shall transmit it to them.

---

The dao says: On fasting days, burn incense and face east to pray:

I now burn incense, returning body, spirit, and fate to the Eastern Limitless Supreme Numinous Treasure Heavenly Venerable. I now respectfully thank the Eastern Nine Energies Azure Heaven, the Great Star God, the Supreme Clarity Profound Origin Upper Three Heavens Limitless Great Dao, the Supreme Elder Lord, the Supreme Patriarch, the Heavenly Emperor Lord, the Heavenly Emperor Patriarch, the Supreme Emperor Lord, the Thirty-Nine Perfected Ones, the Seventy-Two Sages, the Great Mystery True Lord, the Nine Elder Immortal Capital Lords, the Nine Energy Patriarchs, the Primordial Birth Azure True Eastern Flower Jade Treasure Great Morning Grand Marshal, the Prime Minister Azure Youth Lord, the Primordial Elder Nine Profound Lord Immortal Perfected One, countless countless layers of dao qi, the Twelve Hundred Official Lords, the Supreme Clarity Jade Majesty, the Azure Emperor Nine Energy Jade Gate Immortal, the Four Directors Perfected Ones, the Highest Saints and Great Gods of the Heavens, the Eastern Land Limitless World Immortal True Ones.

I beg forgiveness for my ancestors from seven generations past, down to myself, for accumulated offenses: killing the virtuous, rebellion and ugliness, unhuman deeds, lust, theft, ruining others’ success, severing kinship, usurping reverence, filial impiety, disloyalty, rebellion against superiors, attacking teachers and ancestors, disrespecting Heaven and Earth, fearing not ghosts and spirits, slandering the great dao, leaking numinous texts, speaking with a false heart, self-aggrandizing and envying the capable, despising the four great elements, polluting the three lights, evil speech and double tongues, slandering good people. Such sins have lingered through generations, binding firmly, accumulating like mountains.

I now burn incense and walk the dao, repent to the Profound Truth, release old bonds, rejoice with the seven ancestors, depart from the Five Paths, rescue from the Eight Difficulties, liberate the impoverished souls, ascend to the hall of blessings. The whole family has no other wish; the world receives grace; the land is peaceful; the four seas flourish; emperors rejoice; the nation is rich and the people abundant; blessings extend to all beings; all receive the dao’s favor.

Having completed these ten-directional repentances and confessions, then proceed according to the ancient rites and ceremonies. This is the foundation of learning the dao; above it can resolve the seven ancestors’ karmic bonds; below it can remove the body’s evil sins. When all offenses are scattered, divine protection naturally follows. When divine protection descends, the heavenly folk return their hearts. Merits and virtues widely accumulate; blessings and shade are endless; universally ferrying all; protecting and saving all beings. This method is wondrous and weighty, difficult to fully recount.

The dao says: Those who wish to cultivate goodness and build merit, widely sow fields of blessing, should fast and repent for the heavenly folk, release life and light lamps, rescue past karmic debts, and liberate worldly nets; thus the heavenly folk receive grace.

The Numinous Treasure True Texts now conclude. Then the Eastern Flower Upper Chamber Azure Youth Lord sings the harmonious soul-summoning and spirit-inviting melody. Those who gain recitation of it find heavenly spirits descend to guard, myriad heretics perish nearby, spirits are intelligent and clear, remembrance is easily moved.

Those with the scripture should treasure and keep it secret; do not recklessly transmit it.

---

### Song of the Eastern Flower Upper Chamber Spirit Consort

Purple cassia planted in the jade garden, vermilion blossoms chirp softly. The moon palace births the medicinal abyss; at midday lies the jade pool. To the left, the round numinous radiance is drawn; to the right, the cinnabar glow is pulled. Flowing gold illuminates the crimson court; the eight scenes surpass smoke and clouds. Green canopies float in the bright sky; feathered joints command the Supreme Subtle. Phoenix essence and youthful radiant faces, rich and plump, satisfy long hunger. Controlling the morning, drawing from the Supreme Element, suddenly riding the jade steps. Breathing in and out the six numinous embryos, the jade concubine holds her scarf and follows. Strumming the southern cloud fan, fragrant winds beat brocade robes. Knocking on the Shang tone, the hundred beasts dance; the six heavens gather divine might. Suddenly, countless springs pass; lifespan is supreme and lofty. The little fresh ones not yet cooked in the cauldron, speak of my sorrow beneath the rock.

---

The Azure Youth Great Lord, with the Supreme Void Perfected One, Western City Perfected One, and Lesser True King, gather at the Jade Terrace, gazing over the Ten Directions, mourning myriad lives, longing for the worldly path, unaware of the Jade Morning assembly, sighing and chanting, each composing a poem. On fasting days, they read it to summon the four true ones’ protection.

---

### Azure Youth Great Lord’s Chant

To nurture the roots of extinction and liberation, one must uproot birth and death. Pondering deeply, falling to the Nine Springs, sitting and lamenting the body’s decay.

---

### Supreme Void Perfected One’s Chant

Observing spirit carrying form, it is like a cart drawn by horses. When the cart breaks, the horses flee; the connection is but temporary. Alas, the world does not understand this; it merely borrows wind and fire. Sowing sins on Heaven’s net, receiving poison beneath Hell.

---

### Western City Perfected One Lord’s Chant

Spirit is the ferrying boat for form; arriving at shore, one must part. Form is not spirit’s constant home; spirit is not form’s constant carrier. Wandering the wheel of birth and death, only suffering from hesitation.

---

### Lesser True King Lord’s Chant

Losing the dao, crossing the death ford; three souls lost, confused in the path of life. Life after life grows distant; death after death comes too soon. Alas, bitter pain and sorrow; roots and flowers are reversed. Rising to the seat of decay, how to know return from withered old age?

---

The Eastern Sea Azure Youth Lord often ascends the Eastern Flower Terrace on the Ding day of the month, gazing in all directions. On this day, you may twice bow facing the sun. Going forth at sunrise fulfills your wishes; thus, wearing the sun’s essence is best.

---

The Supreme Clarity Great Dao Jade Morning Lord often ascends the Jade Misty Jade Chamber on the fourth day of the first month, the eighth day of the second month, the fifteenth day of the third month, the eighth day of the fourth month, the ninth day of the fifth month, the sixth day of the sixth month, the seventh day of the seventh month, the eighth day of the eighth month, the ninth day of the ninth month, the fifth day of the tenth month, the third day of the eleventh month, and the twelfth day of the twelfth month.

On these days, he gazes over the world and Ten Directions. Those with resolve and distant discipline, circling and dwelling in reverence, devoted and attentive in heart, beginning to cultivate and study, though not yet able to reach the peak by thought alone, wishing to refine past faults, on these days fast and at dawn face north and bow twice to pray, fully presenting your case. Also, with ritual instruction, step by step the blessings increase. After bowing and praying, take the Jade Pool’s thirty-six passages; subtle and profound indeed, diligently persevere.
