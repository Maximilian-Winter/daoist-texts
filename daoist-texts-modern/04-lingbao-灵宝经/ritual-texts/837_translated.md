## The True Person of the Supreme Ultimate Unfolds the Essential Instructions on the Numinous Treasure Fasting, Precepts, and Dignified Conduct

The True Person of the Supreme Ultimate said:  
To learn the path of true immortals who ascend to the heavens by day, all begin with fasting and precepts as the foundation of virtue. The *Numinous Treasure Scripture* contains the Great Method: the first, third, fifth, seventh, ninth, and eleventh months of the year are the six fasting months. On the first, eighth, fourteenth, fifteenth, eighteenth, twenty-third, twenty-fourth, twenty-eighth, twenty-ninth, and thirtieth days of the month, these are called the ten fasts of the month. Lengthy fasting and deep contemplation aim to ascend the path of the void. Therefore, the supreme fasting of the Numinous Treasure is upheld tirelessly by the august sovereigns of the Imperial Old Heaven, the Great Saints. How much more then should Daoist practitioners and immortals yearn for it! Since ancient times, the pinnacle of the immortal path requires the invitation and reverence of the Most High, who unfolds the codes of fasting, precepts, dignity, and regulation. This scripture is profound and subtle; children, quiet your hearts and listen attentively.

The True Person of the Supreme Ultimate said:  
When entering the fasting hall, face east. Facing the incense burner, recite the invocation:

*"Most High Numinous Treasure Lord Lao, summon the true officials, the merit officers, the envoys, and the left and right dragons and tigers bearing the talismanic incense. Open the supreme Three Heavens of Mysterious Origin and the Great Dao. We, your humble servants, now enter stillness, burn incense to greet the truth, and wish to receive the Most High’s vital energy from the Ten Directions into our bodies. When opened, may it be heard and swiftly conveyed before the Jade Emperor’s throne of True Unity."*

Next, kneel long and sound the Heavenly Drum twenty-four times.

Carefully summon forth from within our bodies the five true officials of the merit officers; the supreme Three Heavens’ enforcers of law who open and transform yin and yang; the merit officers who guide the Dao, dispel calamities, scatter misfortunes, and resolve hardships—twelve each. Summon forth the officials who govern our bodies, the lord of duties, the great general overseeing the establishment of regulations; the front and rear departments of merit and execution; the courier court magistrates and deputies; the four departments of merit and their attendants. From within our bodies also emerge the immortal spirits, direct envoys, officials of True Unity, healers, left and right officials, yin-yang spirit decision officers, talismanic red talisman officers, wind riders, courier riders, flying dragon riders—two each. Those who emerge are arrayed in solemn attire, crowned with ribbons, their dignity arranged. The direct envoys wear the crown of the Heaven-Penetrating, dressed in black gauze single robes. The True Unity officers wear the vermilion sun headdress and crimson robes. The envoys wear the crown of Nine Virtues, five-colored longevity robes, tiger talisman belts, each holding jade tablets. The direct envoys stand facing the four directions; the True Unity officers stand in the center; the healers guard our bodies. The left envoys hold the banner in front; the right envoys hold the standard behind; the yang spirit decision officers stand on the left; the yin spirit decision officers stand on the right. The upper department merit officers gaze toward the heavens; the middle department merit officers watch the eight directions; the urging merit officers hasten the envoys of all officials from the Ten Directions, circling around our bodies. The attendants, tiger guards, inspectors of treachery, mounted officials, heavenly armored soldiers, heavenly laborers, officers who gather qi and feed qi, officers who gather spirits and feed spirits, officers who gather ghosts and feed ghosts, officers who gather evil and feed evil, officers who gather essence and feed essence, officers who gather poison and feed poison, officers who destroy talismans and break temples, talismanic red talisman officers, wind riders, courier riders, flying dragon riders, all encamp before and behind, to the left and right of us. After the merit officers and envoys are arrayed in full regalia, the registers are opened, the Numinous Treasure officials are summoned, and the immortal overseers of the fasting and all commanders assembled. The Heavenly Master’s twenty-four regulations are set forth, the thirty-six peaceful huts, seventy-two blessed lands, three hundred and sixty-five famous mountains of Kunlun, the thirty-six thousand gods of the upper palace, the sun, moon, stars, the celestial pivots and jade scales, the five emperors of Heaven and Earth, the officials and commanders of the Three Realms, and the Ten Directions—all assembled. Also present are the Eastern Nine Barbarians’ Old Lords, Southern Eight Man and Yue Old Lords, Western Six Rong Clan Old Lords, Northern Five Di and Qiang Old Lords, Central Three Qin and Cang Old Lords, the lords of the Five Sacred Mountains and Four Rivers, the marsh and hill spirits, the twelve river daughters of Mengchang, the primordial roots and origins, the lords of land and soil, the state altars and commanders—all arrayed solemnly together with the merit officers and flying dragon riders within us. They open the Most High’s Limitless Dao, the Most High Dao Lords, the Most High Old Lords, the Most High Patriarchs, the Supreme Mysterious Elders, the Limitless Dao of the Ten Directions, the Dao and Virtue assembly of all sacred celestial lords, the Most True Great Emperors, Heavenly Emperors, Heavenly Masters, Numinous Treasure fasting grand masters, and all officials and lords. We, born and raised amid demons and the mundane, sinking in the late age, indulging in pleasure and glory, bound by karmic fate, suddenly see the opening and elevation, and receive the Great Dao. Not to forsake the foolish who love pleasure and the path of true immortal ascent, yet whose past sins are deeply accumulated, their bonds unresolved. Now we all together cultivate the supreme Numinous Treasure fasting, request to burn incense and turn the scripture, to seek our wishes. Merit officers and flying dragon riders separately report and close the gates, timely ascending above. When the gates are closed, all return within us and resume their palace chambers. When summoned again, they arrive as before. Then sound the Heavenly Drum three times to conclude.

The Immortal Elder said:  
This is called the initial fasting opening ceremony. On that day, at the six times of the day and night, burn incense facing only the incense burner and recite the invocation.

The wondrous incense burner invocation is:  
*"Incense officials, envoys, left and right dragon and tiger lords, incense bearers, let the fasting hall and the place of stillness naturally produce golden liquid, cinnabar, azure mushrooms, and the essence of spirits, all converging before this incense burner. May we attain the Dao, thus become divine immortals, our whole families blessed, the world receiving favor. The ten directions’ immortal children and jade maidens attend the incense smoke, transmitting our words directly to the Most High before the Golden Pavilion and Jade Emperor’s throne."*

Next, the fasting master kneels long, declaring:  
"I, so-and-so, officiate the sacrificial wine; I, so-and-so, now burn incense."  
Then, holding the incense, they burn it and make their wishes. Each burns incense three times, making three wishes.

The first incense wish is:  
"We burn incense, returning body, spirit, and life to the Great Dao. We prostrate our heads and bodies, submitting to the Most High Three Honored Ones. May the merit of this offering flow to our seven generations of parents, to free them from the ten sufferings and eight hardships, ascending to Heaven’s realm, where clothing and food come naturally, dwelling always in non-action. Now we burn incense and rely on the virtue of the honored masters, great saints, and the assembly of the Most True. After attaining the Dao, we ascend into the formless, merging with the Dao in truth."*

The Three Honored Ones are the Honored Dao, the Honored Scripture, and the Honored True Person. These three unified honors permeate the human body.

The second incense wish is:  
"We burn incense, returning body, spirit, and life to the Great Dao. We prostrate our heads and bodies, submitting to the Most High Three Honored Ones. May the merit of this offering flow to the emperors, kings, lords, ministers, and subjects. We receive the Daoist teachings, our parents and peers, all Daoist sages and worthy ones. May they be freed from the ten sufferings and eight hardships, each preserving blessings and fortune, ultimately entering non-action. Now we burn incense and rely on the virtue of the honored masters, great saints, and the assembly of the Most True. After attaining the Dao, we ascend into the formless, merging with the Dao in truth."*

The third incense wish is:  
"We burn incense, returning body, spirit, and life to the Great Dao. We prostrate our heads and bodies, submitting to the Most High Three Honored Ones. May the merit of this offering flow to our own bodies, enabling us to attain immortal salvation, ascending into non-action, harmonizing with the Four Great Elements. May all the people of the world, the crawling and writhing, all living beings, be freed from the ten sufferings and eight hardships, the five poisons, water and fire, thieves, plagues, ghosts, and calamities. May all preserve blessings and fortune, living in peace and non-action. Now we burn incense and rely on the virtue of the honored masters, great saints, and the assembly of the Most True. After attaining the Dao, we ascend into the formless, merging with the Dao in truth."*

At this time of incense burning, each person takes turns offering incense; one person of high virtue is chosen as the fasting master, called the Dharma Master. Not everyone needs to make wishes.

When incense burning and wishes are complete, after the incense is fully consumed, the fasting assembly bows eastward once and declares:  
"We now submit to the Eastern Limitless Most High Numinous Treasure Heavenly Lord, granting our wishes as we desire, seeking to achieve them."

Next, face south, then west, then north, then east again, then southeast, southwest, northwest, upward, and downward. These are the ten directions of wishful contemplation. Following the prior method, bow three times to each direction; one bow is also acceptable. When finished,

Facing due west, bow twice again and say:  
"We now submit to the Western realm’s already attained Dao Great Saints, the assembly of the Most True Lords and Elders, granting all our wishes."

Next face north, then east, then south. Facing the scripture, repeat the three wishes as before. This completes the ritual. All bow toward the incense burner, taking its proper orientation. This is the Numinous Treasure fasting ritual of the Ten Directions, the wondrous and profound Great Method of the Most High. All should walk calmly and gracefully, arranging the order carefully. Men and women must not mix, so that dignity accords with the celestial statutes. Thus the ghosts and spirits gaze in awe, the flying immortals sigh in admiration, and the Three Realms follow the pattern. Immortals who cultivate this fasting have no end time; how much more so the worthy and virtuous! After bows conclude, the fasting assembly walks leftward in turn, circling the incense burner three times. At this time, they chant the *Stepping into the Void, Treading the Empty Cavern* chapter aloud. The reason for circling the incense burner is to follow the celestial root of the supreme jade cavern of heaven, the Great Luo Heaven’s Most High Dao Lord’s natural seven-treasure platform, upheld by the supreme True Persons who fast and recite, circling the Most High’s seven-treasure platform—this is the present method.

Also, disciples of the Three Caverns who cultivate fasting methods all burn incense and chant, symbolizing the assembly of True Persons and Great Saints circling the Most High Dao Lord’s platform. Therefore, those who seek the supreme, correct, and true Great Dao may also circle the high seat of the *Supreme Clarity Numinous Treasure Scripture*. The reason for circling the incense burner is that many present-day learners are shallow and cannot receive the supreme scripture. Thus the fasting method is shown, entrusting the heart to incense smoke alone. When the heart of the Way is utmost, the wishes follow the incense smoke and already reach the Most High. The Most High’s Dao Eye constantly observes all people’s good and evil, leaving nothing omitted. How can one not tremble and be cautious?

The Immortal Elder said:  
Always imagine seeing the Most High True Person seated on the high throne, turning the scripture and expounding the Way.

## The Method of Turning the Scripture

Set up a small bed facing east for turning the scripture, following the Numinous Treasure method. The bed is five feet high, five feet wide, and five feet long. Another method says: the bed is four feet five inches high, five feet wide and long. The quiet chamber should be neat and suitable for a refined room. This is called the temporary practice of the Way on fasting days. If one wishes to fast long and contemplate the immortal path, one must establish a separate fasting hall, ensuring it is pure, solemn, and arranged with scripture tables and incense burners, placing a high seat within. Next, face the high seat and bow thrice to the scripture, saying:

*"We now submit to the Most High Limitless Great Dao, the Most True, the supreme thirty-six departments of honored scriptures and treasure talismans, the Most High Three Honored Ones. Now we burn incense and turn the scripture, hoping to behold the Most High’s grace of salvation, begging for our seven generations of parents, emperors, kings, and all people, ourselves and our households, to be pardoned of the heavy sins and offenses of past and present lives. Whether for regicide or patricide, unfilial to parents, betraying teachers and deceiving friends, forsaking truth for falsehood, being robbers and thieves, attacking and plundering states, killing living beings for pleasure, committing adultery with others’ wives, severing kinship, seizing what others love, killing sages and Daoists, being unrighteous rulers or disloyal ministers, oppressing the high and low, cruelly tormenting the people for fame and gain, relatives destroying each other, defiling sacred altars, stealing or burning scriptures, polluting holy texts, mocking those who do good, boasting of oneself, envying the worthy and able, disrespecting the Dao, dishonoring elders, ignoring the six illnesses, cursing the wind and rain, and the heavens, earth, sun, moon, stars, emperors, kings, teachers, and Daoists, scorning the Four Great Elements, insulting ghosts and spirits, calling them ignorant, speaking one thing and meaning another, deceiving oneself and one’s shadow—such are the great sins beyond reckoning, accumulated through ages, entangled and unresolved, with endless grievances. Now we burn incense and practice the Way to save ourselves, repent, submit to precepts, and dare not offend again. Whatever we wish, we humbly offer, all at once with head bowed to the ground, hearts joyful. Thus the sages surely attain liberation from all suffering and hardship, all entering the non-action Dao field."*

The True Person of the Supreme Ultimate said:  
The Numinous Treasure fasting method requires ten lamps lit according to the ten directions. Ten is the utmost number, for humans are born after ten months. Lamps are lit at the gate. Seven generations of parents have seven lamps lit before the hall. The fasting chamber always has one lamp lit; two lamps are lit at the gate. For talismans affixed to doors, ghosts and spirits strike people—should they not enter through the gate? The heavens always dispatch six departments of envoys to patrol the world, observing people’s good and evil. When ghosts and spirits see talisman lamps, they say, “This is the gate of a good person; we must not act wrongly.” This brings distinction, life and death, and blessings. The sun, moon, and stars, the sick person’s birth year and fate, each have a lamp lit. During fasting, incense is burned three times morning and evening, repenting faults, with a single heart listening to receive the scripture’s wondrous and profound meaning. Thus turning the scripture and expounding the Way symbolizes the ancient True Persons’ teaching and transformation. The sages transmitted scriptures and teachings to later generations, so the unheard may hear, the unknown may know. They wished to use this method as a bridge to universally save all people. Therefore, when practicing the Way, one must not speak disorderly or discuss worldly affairs. One should only ask the Dharma Master about scripture meaning and precepts; the master should explain the true essentials. If one can keep inner and outer calm and respectfully receive a single line of scripture, the Director of Destinies adds ten counts. If inner and outer are restless and one destroys a single line of scripture, the Director of Destinies subtracts ten counts. Thus the True Person does not speak lightly; every word has meaning. Words are made into methods; words enable people to magnify the Dao, not the Dao magnify people—this is the meaning.

The Immortal Elder said:  
By uniting with the Great Fasting Method, one attains the Cave Truth; thus the Seven Patriarchs escaped hell and ascended to Heaven, their bodies first receiving the Five Mushrooms like lotuses. The Five Mushrooms also arise naturally.

The True Person of the Supreme Ultimate said:  
Princes and lords all receive blessings from past lives, attaining wealth and rank, intelligence and brilliance, and sufficient merit. They then naturally return to love the Dao. This means their past sins are exhausted. When past sins are exhausted, such a person surely devoutly loves fasting and precepts, studies great scriptures and great methods, and thus nears immortality. If one studies precepts without negligence, one attains the upper immortals. Daoists who delight in fasting have all exhausted past sins. Those whose past sins are not exhausted never truly love it; their ascent to immortality remains distant. Those who learn the immortal path seek longevity and endless years, establishing ancestral temples, flourishing their clans, saving seven generations of parents from suffering, ascending to Heaven. Future generations of worthy and wise descendants will receive the true Numinous Treasure texts. Practicing this fasting, one attains great blessings. Great blessings prioritize saving others, thus putting others before oneself, relying on and forgetting, forgetting what is forgotten, with a will united with the mysterious. The superior person who hears the Dao diligently practices it; the middling person is half-hearted; the inferior person laughs at the Dao.

The True Person of the Supreme Ultimate said:  
To move Heaven and Earth, summon all spirits, penetrate the immortal path, understand the Most True, resolve accumulated sins of ages, extinguish misfortune, repel enemies, cultivate great virtue, cure illness, and aid all beings, nothing approaches fasting, stillness, and scripture turning. Anciently, these words were heard; today we hope to see such people.

The True Person of the Supreme Ultimate said:  
The worthy who wish to cultivate the great method of non-action may turn this scripture and the scriptures of various True Persons. Only the Five Thousand Character Scripture of Dao and Virtue is supreme, Most High, Limitless, and True. It is all-encompassing and penetrates all details—the great ancestor of Dao and Virtue. Observing those who have attained the Dao, none do not study the Five Thousand Characters—such as Yin Xi and the Pine Hermit’s disciples. This is called the Great Vehicle Scripture. Also, the Great Cave Truth Scripture of thirty-nine chapters is not to be recited by mortals. For this reason, it is the scripture of the true Dao’s subtle ascent. The celestial emperors and kings descend to welcome, scattering incense and flowers. The six heavens’ great demon kings and their attendants celebrate and kowtow, all coming to receive orders. Mountain and sea spirits all obey their commands. Chanting a single phrase, the heavens set up rites; how much more so the ghosts and spirits? Therefore, it must not be carelessly practiced by mortals. The Numinous Treasure Scripture is the supreme scripture of the Daoists, the profound ancestor of the Great Vehicle, with grades of rank. The True Persons who have attained the Dao in the Ten Directions constantly perform rites, burn incense, scatter flowers—it is the root of all Dao. Daoists revere the Numinous Treasure, bow in fasting and precepts, cultivate according to the method, and all attain the Dao. How could it be otherwise? If this scripture cannot lead one to attain longevity, ascend immortality, and save the world, then there are no immortals in Heaven and Earth. The key lies in extinguishing external thoughts and focusing inward on the mysterious truth; then the brilliant Han era may be surpassed, and longevity secured. The Five Thousand Characters move and gather all wonders, returning to the One, surpassing worldly practice. All fasting methods derive from the supreme original Numinous Treasure fasting.

The Immortal Elder said:  
This great fasting is the path of upper immortals; thus the Seven Patriarchs escaped the net of hell, ascended the Supreme Mysterious Palace, and their bodies first received the Five Mushrooms like lotuses. The Five Mushrooms also arise naturally.

The True Person of the Supreme Ultimate said:  
The Five Thousand Characters are the immortal’s transmission, originally paired with the Numinous Treasure. Talented and superior scholars who delight in chanting and seek the natural path of flying immortality receive the method, talismanic pattern, and silk banner of five thousand feet, simultaneously with the Numinous Treasure, on famous mountains and peaks. The master faces south; disciples face north, bowing thrice. The golden rings are divided in half and worn on the body. After receiving the scripture, disciples bow once each, starting from the north, circling the Ten Directions. Reading scriptures also begins with bowing to the Ten Directions, following this method. This is the old canon of the Supreme Mystery Capital. Now you clearly understand it; your descendants should transmit it to future worthy ones according to the method. The Most High’s secret instructions should be kept hidden. You should always think of the Void True Person, the Most High Great Dharma King, the myriad chariots of the worthy, and the world-renowned Laozi. Laozi is the great master of the profound center. With the Dao Eye, he observes all heavens and people’s good and evil. You propagate this Dao and surely fly as an immortal. When you attain the wondrous day, know that this scripture is no falsehood. The radiant and silent text contains the great Dao’s intent—all is here.

The Immortal Elder said:  
In the world, there are virtuous people who wish to chant and ascend immortality; they should receive it simultaneously with the Numinous Treasure. The talismanic banner is the alliance of scripture reverence. Therefore it is said: “Without leaving the door or window, one may know the Dao of Heaven.” Such people will be rare. If one wishes to discuss the void and hold oneself above the times, one need not rely on this method to receive it. True persons teach immortality directly. Daoists who learn it seek immortality; without a master’s reception, the Dao will not proceed.

The True Person of the Supreme Ultimate said:  
True persons embody the Dao of void and nothingness, fearing nothing. Among the mundane, there are impurities; the sages worry for the souls and spirits of the world. When people’s scriptures are impure and not cleansed with incense and bathing, illness and harm arise, showing the people the difference between purity and impurity. The Dao of ghosts and spirits is even more impure; impurity causes obstruction. Even gold cannot be sullied or wasted; how much more the supreme Dao! The great method and true Dao are without impurity and clear.

The True Person of the Supreme Ultimate said:  
When people’s scriptures are impure, regardless of magnitude, they should be immediately purified. After purification, incense is burned and the Way practiced, with no fixed time limit.

The True Person of the Supreme Ultimate said:  
For the worthy, blessed food has its number. Visiting guests also partake first. The True Unity True Person and the Three Heavens Masters, upon ascending to Heaven, for the poor commoners’ sake, made blessings of ten-person meals. Suddenly more than ten guests arrive, with insufficient offerings; if not fully distributed, one person misses out, and it is not universal. Therefore, after all matters are completed, the leftover kitchen food is offered to all people and all beings, praying blessings for the host. Later generations unaware of this are hereby shown. Wine should not be entirely forbidden but given in measure, according to people’s numbers, without strict limit. Hence the worldly teaching says: “Only wine without measure leads to disorder.” Wine in excess muddles the correct qi, causing the Three True Ones to lose their palaces; thus it must not be overused. Inspectors and officials should be cautious.

The True Person of the Supreme Ultimate said:  
Some who do not learn the Dao hear Daoists discussing the profound and wondrous meaning of the supreme scriptures and do not believe, slandering the holy texts as vain and false, unworthy of study. Since they do not believe, they envy others’ scripture study and cultivation methods, saying otherwise. Such people’s past lives did not form bonds with immortals and saints; the worthy did not create causes with them. In this life, they lack great wisdom and cannot grasp the essence of the worthy and saints. They do not believe the supreme Dao scriptures and prefer to study sorcery, miscellaneous books, and untrue matters. On the day of their gathering, wine and meat come first; their mouths say one thing, hearts another; they cunningly attack each other, indulge in lust, act recklessly, and crave endlessly. Some even become masters without a heart to teach good, oppressing the weak, always desiring to unleash cruelty, harboring greed, envy, slander, lust, theft, deceit, rebellion, and violence. Such a person always has ten evils. How can one know such conduct and not be caught in the net of punishment, yet appear safe in the world? Some have never violated the law, always following scriptures and teachings, yet suffer even more woes. When people die, their bodies decay, but their souls and spirits do not perish. According to their deeds in life, they face judgment. Thus, worldly people do evil and are confused, committing regicide and patricide, unparalleled cruelty, yet are not immediately judged because they receive blessings from past lives. When blessings end and sins arrive, they may be judged by Yang officials in life or enter hell after death, suffering indescribable torment. If the good do not practice now, their past evil sins are not yet exhausted; when exhausted, blessings come. Some appear noble in the world, or die into royal families, or are born in heaven, or become ghosts and spirits. Evil begets evil; good begets good—this is called the root of fate. Those who learn the Dao should also know this. Those who study the Dao but do not attain it by death lack merit and have no strong karmic bond; their cause is weak. Later generations all rely on this merit to attain immortal salvation. If one studies the Dao for several years, hopes to ascend immortality, but fails and suddenly grows lax, or falls into desires and returns to the mundane, their body perishes and name is lost, revolving through death and suffering. Or they lose the human body and suddenly leave the human path, with no return. Some are sharp and clever but do not teach others, becoming ignorant in later generations. Servants and slaves have no seed either, all due to past lives’ deceit and theft, now repaid by force. Six domestic animals are fed as meat offerings. People do not believe Dao scriptures, doubt the orthodox teaching, and thus suffer this harsh fate. Is it not sad? Daoists who meet kindness and endure evil, who can bear hardship and keep these precepts, will surely preserve their present merit. To be poor but not abandon the Dao is the Daoist; in death and life, they belong to royal families. You, in this, attain the Dao. To attain the Dao is to see the root of past fate, from great generosity in past lives, studying the Dao tirelessly, thus becoming immortal.

The Left Immortal Elder said:  
You should strive diligently. Throughout the ages, none have attained immortality without study. The key to learning immortality lies in the complete heart-mind. If the heart-mind is incomplete, one studies but does not attain. The sages do not mislead people.

The True Person of the Supreme Ultimate said:  
The officiant of sacrificial wine must uphold Laozi’s one hundred and eighty precepts; this defines the officiant. Therefore, those who do not receive the great precepts may not properly receive the respect of the common people and disciples. Those who receive these precepts have the mind to uphold and practice them; now they are the officiants. The officiant must abandon thoughts, forsake many evils, and implement the precepts accordingly. The Yellow Old Dao is subtle, examining the methods of people; not all are true, but among ten thousand, many are.

The True Person of the Supreme Ultimate said:  
Scholars who can abandon worldly burdens, have the ambition to travel mountains and waters afar, and master the ultimate Dharma Wheel are called teachers. They often sit on high seats reading scriptures, teaching the foolish and wise, opening and saving all learners. If one’s birth sign is Tiger or Rabbit, belonging to the Eastern two branches, they are called Eastern Mountain Teachers. The four directions follow this. Those born in Dragon, Dog, Ox, or Sheep months are called Central Mountain Teachers. If one is pure and virtuous, able to understand profound mysteries, disciples and fellow students accompany and call them so-and-so Teacher. One who probes deeply and aims far, with profound learning and aspiration for the Great Vehicle, is called Profound Teacher, or Wandering Profound Teacher, or Far-Traveling Teacher, or Dao Proclaiming Teacher, or Profound Expounding Teacher. These are roughly comparable and not to be reversed. There must be such people in the world, and learners call them thus. Generally, the method is like this. The title *Supreme Clarity* and fasting for seven days is heavy in rank and must not be claimed lightly; ghosts and spirits do not accept it, as Heaven tests people. The teacher is a Daoist. In this, learning the immortal Dao and becoming a True Person, embodying the Dao and great method, is called True Person.

The True Person of the Supreme Ultimate said:  
Observing the world as Dao, rare are those who desire fasting, precepts, and scripture turning, seek clear masters, receive teachings, ask about meaning, and faithfully practice. Many are shallow and frivolous, with lustful hearts, lacking great elegance, fond of minor teachings. Some wish to fast and learn the Dao but have no clear master to encourage them. Their aspiration is the immortal Dao, wishing to save all people, but people ridicule them, saying: “That is unnecessary; I have not seen many learn its method; the scriptures are full of falsehoods.” Thus, the deaf do not hear the music of Shao and Wu; the blind do not see black and white—how can they say they are already ill? So the Great Dao does not proceed; the correct teaching does not flourish; the true scriptures lie dormant; spirits and demons grow daily; each claims to be a palace maiden of the Three Palaces; demons and chaos arise; the people abandon truth and pursue falsehood. All because masters do not diligently study to encourage disciples to learn the correct scriptures and teachings. If the true is in the heart, demons and spirits stay far away. Without understanding the great meaning of the scriptures, one cannot examine one’s heart. Evil spirits and demonic qi enter the heart and act; their intent knows no bounds. It is like clutching a stone to cross a great river; is it not so?

The True Person of the Supreme Ultimate said:  
Zhuang Zhou is the Most High Southern Flower Immortal. In his past life learning the Dao, he wished: “When I attain the Dao and become immortal, with penetrating wisdom, I shall emerge from the world to transform and give birth among people, expounding the *Dao and Virtue Scripture* of five thousand characters, spreading the Dao’s meaning.” Hui Zi was his disciple, who said: “If the master attains the Dao, able to come and go freely, I wish to attend, chant praises of subtle words, understand profound meaning, and observe the Dao’s source to resolve the world’s nets.” He examined the worldly people’s hearts of vanity and competition, guiding them with the natural method. Thus it is profound beyond profound, the gate of all wonders. Later, both attained their wishes and wrote books all conveying the Dao’s meaning. People today do not know this immortal True Person, thinking Zhuangzi’s works are mostly allegory. The great roc, the great pillar, the dark spirit—all are recorded words, not false utterances. Great places give birth to great beings; now in the Jade Garden, Kunlun, Penglai, and the Northern Sea, such divine beings exist. Small places give birth to small beings. If one insists only what the eye sees is real and what is unseen is not, then much in the world would not exist. Daoist scriptures use metaphorical methods, speaking of kalpas so long that a stone the size of Kunlun Mountain is but a mustard seed. Within forty li, celestial beings spread their robes once every hundred years, brushing off the stone to take one mustard seed, symbolizing the end of a kalpa. Such is the vastness; who would believe this?

The True Person of the Supreme Ultimate said:  
The *Numinous Treasure Scripture* is the ancestor of all scriptures, hard to speak or explain. The Five Thousand Characters are subtle; all scriptures’ great meaning returns to one. The Cave Truth’s thirty-nine chapters, spoken by thirty-nine True Persons, are the scripture of non-birth. This is the transmission of True Persons. Their Dao, virtue, and true qi blend naturally to form True Persons, peers of Laozi. They have passed through endless kalpas; they are not ordinary cultivators. Ordinary people without past blessings and sufficient merit cannot understand this meaning. What is spoken is the supreme Three Heavens’ natural palaces, the myriad things and mountains and rivers. Their mountains and rivers share names with worldly ones but are not the worldly mountains and rivers; all are natural things, hard to hear and debate. The Cave Truth and Jade Clarity Scriptures roughly explain their meaning but cannot grasp the details; how could they be conceived? Revering them brings great blessings, longevity, ancestral peace, and reciting them makes one the king of True Persons; their Dao is supreme. Those who attained upper immortals and the Most True Dao all revered the *Numinous Treasure Scripture*.

The Three Heavens call them immortals; Brahma calls them Dao. Heaven and Earth have beginnings and ends; thus there are great and small kalpas, and all scriptures perish accordingly. Later sages produced new methods; only the Five Thousand Character Scripture, the Great Cave Truth Scripture, and the Numinous Treasure Scripture are imperishable and inexhaustible, passed on endlessly. Therefore, it is called the scripture of non-birth, the king of all scriptures. Thus, generation after generation, teaching and transforming to form the immortal path, the world knows not its source. Lofty and supreme, unseen by ghosts and spirits, only the six heavens’ great demon kings come to serve the scripture masters. The upper three heavens’ officials supervise the immortal officers. It is not heard by lower immortals; only True Persons can learn it. People do not know these are immortals and say immortals are not Dao; all are because their past karmic debts are not exhausted. When debts are exhausted, one naturally attains profound understanding and great wisdom, clearly knowing and attaining the Dao. The Five Thousand Characters are extremely difficult to understand; those who know it all know it. Therefore, it is said one must understand the supreme great wisdom.

The True Person of the Supreme Ultimate said:  
In establishing the Numinous Treasure fasting method, those of high virtue and profound understanding of scripture meaning serve as Dharma Masters. Next are those talented and intelligent, able to comprehend subtle principles and familiar with laws, serving as chief lecturers. Next are fasting supervisors who punish violations. Next are scripture attendants, incense attendants, lamp attendants, and orderly seating. Those who receive this scripture first are superior; those who receive it later are inferior. One person per household receives the scripture; others who wish to fast may listen. If there are Yellow or Red Taiyi officiants at the time who wish to observe the fasting method, they may listen and observe the great method’s transformation but must not sit on the same bed. Even those of highest virtue and worldly reputation must come later, following the order of the registers. This is because such people have subtle karmic ties and thus now receive precedence.

The True Person of the Supreme Ultimate said:  
During fasting, all hearts focus on the mysterious truth, never distracted. Thoughts dwell on the scripture master, first imagining the Three Ones in the palace chamber, settled and clear, possessing three souls and seven spirits, the Taiyi guarding the Mud Pellet within, like the method of returning wind and emperor. Then, together with the soul, fast and listen to scriptures, receiving with mouth and storing in heart. Thus the three corpses flee and evil qi is extinguished; inside and outside receive the truth. So one nears immortality. Alongside breathing exercises and guiding fluids, practicing the supreme wondrous ways, the heavenly truth surely descends upon you. The superior person attains the Dao within the chamber. Even if dwelling in caves, if external thoughts are not cut off, it is but wasted effort and loss of strength. Learning the Dao is only the exhaustion of the heart. When the heart is exhausted, immortals immediately observe and test it. You should carefully examine this.

The True Person of the Supreme Ultimate said:  
Daoists who keep far from human traces, dwelling quietly on famous mountains, cultivating long fasts, living alone in secluded valleys, need not select Dharma Masters but only speak heart to mouth. Daoists living in the world cultivate fasting and eat five grains; if no food is taken, so be it. If taking medicine, take it properly. Drink moderately, clear drinks and abstain from food; at dawn drink porridge, at midday eat vegetables. When fasting ends, break the fast as if setting a grand kitchen, only requiring cleanliness. Fruits and seasonal delicacies are eaten first, with incense and wishes offered, praying the fasting master ascends immortality and saves the world.

The True Person of the Supreme Ultimate said:  
The way of cultivating fasting always practices ten good thoughts:

First, think of the Dao and the Four Great Elements, enabling seven generations of parents to be freed from suffering and ascend to Heaven, where clothing and food come naturally.

Second, think of the emperors and kings, the flourishing Dao, orderly schools, grand imperial teachings, majestic dignity, universally admired, peaceful people, the six barbarians subdued, evil daily destroyed, sages and saints born daily.

Third, think of the Dharma Masters’ great merit, clear teachings, all attaining flying immortality.

Fourth, think of fellow learners, quickly attaining the immortal Dao, mutually opening salvation.

Fifth, think of harmonious kinship, valuing benevolence and righteousness, esteeming Dao and despising wealth, acting as models.

Sixth, think of sacrificing oneself to support Daoists and the hungry and cold; all people find their place.

Seventh, think of the crawling and writhing, all living beings, all attaining accomplishment.

Eighth, first thank the sins and offenses of past and present lives, establish merit to make amends.

Ninth, think of flourishing family and clan, ancestral temples with people, and worthy talents born.

Tenth, respect and receive the master and scriptures, never negligent, equal-hearted, broadly saving all. May my body ascend immortality, rise by day to Heaven, bow before the Most High, forever become a True Person, wear the five-colored numinous elixir, and unite with the Dao.

Master Zheng said:  
When receiving scriptures on the mountain, no need to bow to the chapter, only open the mouth and recite.

## Hymn

The Dao begins with fasting, diligently ascending the Golden Pavilion.  
Thus the Great Method’s bridge is set, universally saving all beings.  
Repaying past lives’ grace, the Dao heart transcends and arises.  
The body flies to the Mysterious Capital; the Seven Patriarchs all attain liberation.

After completion, one must recite this text.

Master Zheng of the Southern Mountain said:  
My former master, the Immortal Elder, always kept this book secret; it is not passed without utmost truth, worth more than ten thousand gold pieces. Immortals transmitted it orally; now it is written. The Immortal Elder said: One copy is sealed and returned to the famous mountain; one copy is passed to disciples; one copy is entrusted to family descendants, recorded and transmitted generation after generation, those who know the Dao. It is given along with the original Numinous Treasure Scripture; it is the Daoist essential subtlety.

Bao Puzi said:  
Hong Yi said those who fast many days are either nobles or Daoists, naturally weak and frail, burning incense and bowing six times daily. I wish to burn incense and bow three times by day; at night it may be omitted. It is for explaining the Dharma meaning only. Those who can burn incense six times daily surely fulfill the full method. I fear some have not attained the Dao, their qi and strength exhausted, only wishing to fast one day and night; they may practice the Way six times. Learners should carefully and properly use this.

To build fasting to the extreme, one may eat dried dates, deer jerky, and preserved meats—these are living fresh things, none other to be enjoyed.

If not mountain Daoists or household scripture cultivators, how can one fast long and contemplate? One should fast accordingly, at least ten, nine, seven, three, or one day to practice the Way. This merit is vast and universal, the highest method of learning the Dao. The Seven Patriarchs escape suffering and poison, ascend the blessed hall—this may be called the ultimate filial path. The utmost filial piety and brotherly love connect to spirits and brightness, extending far to the seven mysteries; how could it be only for ancestors? Thus upper immortals keep it secret.
