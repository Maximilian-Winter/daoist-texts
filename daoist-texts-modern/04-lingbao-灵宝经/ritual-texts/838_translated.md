## The Supreme Scripture of the Profound Cavern, Numinous Treasure, Wisdom, Original Vow, and Great Precepts

### The Supreme Immortal Elder Inquires of the Supreme Master of the Great Ultimate

The Immortal Elder, while in quiet retreat on Mount Tiantai, reverently bowed and worshipped, then asked the Numinous Treasure Profound Master, the Supreme True Man of the Great Ultimate and Great Void: “This disciple has the fortune to serve before the Heavenly Venerable, yet my humble words span countless kalpas, weaving through the source of the dao. Beyond the joy of the Great Ultimate, none have explained it fully. But the Profound Master, young and fond of the path of immortals soaring by day, contemplates the supreme sages and often feels as if grasping at shadows. The great scriptures are subtle and distant, their wondrous mysteries hard to penetrate. I wish to receive the secret formulas to illuminate my dark ford, to open wide the vast void where being and non-being alike come to an end. Yet I have not fully fathomed the causes and origins of life and past lives. Now I beseech the Heavenly Venerable to awaken what I have yet to understand.”

At that moment, the Supreme Profound True Man of the Great Ultimate breathed out a chant as he paced the empty space, his countenance joyful and serene, his golden visage radiant with a smile. He said: “This child has cultivated the dao through countless kalpas, earning the jade name of the Great Ultimate, entrusted among the wise. He will walk alone in the Jade Capital, transcending the Three Realms—truly the charge of the Supreme Immortal Elder. Thus, with compassion for Heaven and humanity, he thinks to save later disciples. Often he aids beings with his outer form, virtuous yet without fame, appointed by the Profound Capital—surely not in vain. To the Supreme True Man he said: ‘You have received the mandate of the Most High Patriarch of the Dao, the Great Void Sovereign, to be his master’s guardian. Surely you must teach fully the profound depths of the Great Cavern. Why wait to speak at length? I have been entrusted only as a master of the capital’s teachings; the scroll is yours to hold.’”

The Supreme True Man replied: “This child is pure and genuine, his name carved on golden slips, his talent clear and far-reaching, his brilliance like the Great Ultimate, subtle and profound in the cavernous void. He is fit to be the Immortal Elder’s charge, to spread the dao with great generosity. I humbly accept this teaching, though I feel unworthy to be his master craftsman. The Most High has commanded it; how dare I withhold? The unity of all wonders depends upon the master’s teaching.”

The Supreme True Man said: “The dao is non-being. It weaves endlessly without end. If you seek it, it is near within yourself, yet again it is not. Through existence one enters non-existence; through accumulated thought one attains the subtle. All things flourish like illusions; all must return to emptiness. So it is with the human body: when the body dies, the spirit departs. Imagine it like a house—when the house collapses, no one can stand; when the body breaks down, the spirit cannot dwell. One must control thought to fix the will, still the body to calm the spirit, preserve the precious qi to maintain essence, let thought and care both vanish, deeply contemplate and look inward—then body and spirit unite. When body and spirit unite, one approaches the true body. This is truly due to the foundation laid in past lives, the accumulated thoughts and feelings, the merit that aids all, the virtue that shelters myriad beings. Cause and effect revolve; sin and blessing oppose; life and death extinguish; nobility and baseness serve; wisdom and folly overturn; poverty and wealth deceive; good and evil manifest. Their suffering is boundless, all born from human deeds and vows. It is neither dao nor Heaven, neither Earth nor man, nor the doing of all things—it is precisely the heart. Once fixed on this, it is hard to escape. The weak and lost believe in the dao only rarely; most are bound by past fate. Without accumulating good and fixing thought, cultivating virtue in the body, yet wishing to ignore virtue and forget the body, forcibly seeking external things—how can they obtain it? Having failed, none escape harm to the body. Therefore, those with the dao take it from within themselves, seeking nothing from others. The scripture says: ‘Cultivate the body, and its virtue is true’—this is what it means. To learn the dao without receiving the great wisdom, the path, the original vow, and the highest grade great precepts, one has no connection to the highest immortals. You have past fate, so you see this scripture. Its text is secret and hidden; establish faith and effect in your heart before transmitting it. Do not recklessly show it to the unbelieving. If disbelief arises, strange thoughts will come; once strange thoughts arise, both sides incur guilt. Therefore it is hidden in non-being, waiting for one who responds to become an immortal king before revealing it.”

At that moment, clouds and dragons leapt in joy, the heavens scattered blossoms, flying incense and smoke played music, mountains and seas stilled their waves, creatures quieted and fled, ghosts and demons vanished, spirits and monsters were subdued, the five sufferings all resolved, long freed from hell, evildoers turned good, believers obeyed and received blessings. Then the Supreme True Man was commanded to attend the scripture; the immortal Liu Wenjing unfolded the clouds and reported, then bestowed the scripture.

## The Wisdom, Original Vow, and Great Precepts of the Highest Grade

The Supreme True Man said: “In past lives, one reverently served scripture masters, reciting with mouth and acting with body, giving alms to the distressed, wishing joy to the Three Treasures, honoring sovereigns and parents with loyalty and filial piety, longing for mountains and waters, dwelling among sages and scholars, humble and possessing the dao, burning incense and scattering blossoms, protecting and ferrying all beings, cultivating virtue and repairing faults, believing and obeying past fate, meditating quietly and enduring emotions. Such conduct enables one to ascend to immortality above and save the world below, to cycle through wealth and honor, born as a respected human with noble appearance and talent clear and far-reaching, possessing the way of humanity in full. Those who live in wealth and honor laugh at poverty and baseness; now they repay with poverty and baseness. Those who love killing now repay with early death. Those who disdain ugliness repay with ugliness. Those who are clever but do not teach repay with stubborn dullness. Those who are healthy and laugh at sickness repay with lingering disease. Those who disbelieve the dao and mock scriptures repay with deep ignorance, long separated from the dao. Those who steal others’ husbands repay with few spouses. Those who seduce women repay with widowhood. Those who vow as husband and wife but cannot both be born human, dying as lower ghosts, now repay with their original thoughts, becoming afflicted with evil sickness. Without the great law, none can untie these past entanglements or dispel this evil sickness. Parents, brothers, sisters, spouses, sovereigns, ministers, teachers, friends—all are past life thoughts and wishes, causes and conditions, endlessly generating each other. None lack their counterpart. Thus it is said: the interplay of cause and effect is hard to exhaust. Only those who learn the path of immortals can forget cause and condition, extinguish birth and death, return together to the profound, and enter the wondrous gate. Only such can be spoken of as true students of the dao.”

“If you see your household and children, wish that all may soon escape the prison of love, focusing their minds on observing the precepts. If you see those who drink wine, wish that all may be restrained at the life gate, keeping calamities and disorder afar. If you see courtesans, wish that all guard chastity and patience, longing for the virtuous and pure. If you see licentious people, wish that all abandon evil thoughts, raise their hearts to forbid transgressions. If you see women, wish that all endure cutting off superficial desires, delighting in the dao for their own amusement. If you see true persons, wish that all walk in faith and right transformation, entering the dharma gate day by day. If you see the crowd, wish that all promote benevolence without contention, holding the dao to calm the world. If you see good people, wish that all constantly keep their thoughts, looking up to follow their path. If you see evil people, wish that all abandon cruelty and turn to good, not violating royal law. If you see the poor, wish that all reduce themselves and give blessings, later receiving great fortune. If you see the rich, wish that all aid myriad beings, receiving rewards generation after generation. If you see nobles, wish that all accept their teachings and fully conform to the regulations. If you see the lowly, wish that all diligently cultivate without slackening, each attaining their due. If you see emperors, wish that all revere and follow royal dao, filial as to parents.

If you see soldiers and armor, wish that all bear benevolent hearts, yielding the world to the worthy. If you see princes, wish that all sing of peace daily, binding the country and inheriting the family. If you see the virtuous, wish that all practice their virtue, the dao becoming the clan of the world. If you see dharma masters, wish that all clearly understand the dharma and attain the dao of non-action. If you see hermits dwelling on mountains, wish that all perceive the dharma gates and swiftly ascend to immortality. If you see teachings and transformations, wish that all personally receive the holy teachings, becoming profound and broad. If you see sages, wish that all respectfully honor and meet them, all nations gazing upon them. If you see immortals, wish that all truly realize the dao, flying up to the heavens. If you see cities and walls, wish that all be strictly maintained and adorned, using the dao as foundation. If you see great nations, wish that all return to revering virtue, like water flowing into the sea. If you see small nations, wish that all know their limits and emptiness, peacefully abiding where they dwell. If you see markets and towns, wish that all gather worthy men and women, fully promoting the right dao. If you see quiet retreats, wish that all merits be lofty, Heaven and humanity attaining their will. If you see fasting and incense offerings, wish that all dao and virtue renew daily, schools orderly and elegant. If you see scripture recitations, wish that all enter the dharma gate fully, hearing all wondrous meanings. If you see scriptures and teachings, wish that all receive, read, and practice them, universally spreading transformation. If you see towers and temples, wish that all open the caverns of the Ten Directions, hiding nothing. If you see high mountains, wish that all establish virtue like them, never turning back. If you see great seas, wish that all have boundless wisdom and thought, assisting in building family and nation. If you see lush forests for dwelling, wish that all live peacefully and freely, sheltering sentient beings. If you see those who love learning, wish that all become masters and teachers, nurturing disciples and spreading teachings. If you see clean hands, wish that all constantly hold scriptures, never pausing. If you see good speech, wish that all delight in chanting the profound scriptures, daily renewing without weariness. If you see movement of feet, wish that all transcend the Three Realms, flying and walking in the Supreme Clarity. If you see stillness, wish that all extinguish appearances and stabilize truth, resting in leisure and emptiness. If you see eating and drinking, wish that all abandon burdens and enter purity, preserving the taste of the dao. If you see great repositories, wish that all remove disasters and bestow blessings. If you see sickness, wish that all calm themselves with the dao, escaping suffering and hardship. If you see death and funerals, wish that all learn the dao and constantly persist, ferrying beings through the Three Paths. If you see hunting, wish that all do not begin or end it, avoiding uninterrupted sin. If you see barbarians and tribes, wish that all be born in Central China, not at the borders. If you see youth, wish that all timely learn and complete their studies, achieving scholarly fame. If you see old age and sickness, wish that all preserve life with the dao, not further declining or withering. If you see the Three Luminaries, wish that all universally shine with numinous radiance, dark shadows instantly vanish. If you see clouds and rain, wish that all blessings overflow, fitting all needs. If you see pure snow, wish that all dwell always in cleanliness and whiteness, carefree and free. If you see numinous winds, wish that all harbor and spread virtue, flowing far and wide. If you see pure water, wish that all wash away filth and clear emptiness, equalizing their hearts. If you see fragrant incense, wish that all receive this pure fragrance, all filth dissipated. If you see beautiful flowers, wish that all delight in revering the saints, their appearances complete. If you see carriages and horses, wish that all attain the dao of non-action, riding phoenixes and driving dragons. If you see strings and songs, wish that all chant scriptures and praise dharma, entertaining with the dao. If you see blessed food, wish that all be fully satisfied, enjoying heavenly cuisine, virtue flowing to living beings like water to the sea, ancestral temples flourishing, always noble and prosperous, generations living in royal houses. If you see scattered alms, wish that all calamities vanish into the nine yin, blessings arise in the Ten Directions, virtue like mountains and seas, all prospering, the Seven Ancestors born in Heaven, descendants wise and loyal, wealth and honor towering, all desires fulfilled, learning the dao and flying as immortals, riding clouds and dragons. Daoists sitting or lying always wish for us to unite the Four Great Virtues, embody the true dao, long dwell in the Profound Capital, with teachers and friends naturally aiding, ferrying beings in the Ten Directions, the world receiving grace, carefree and non-action, penetrating the wondrous gate.”

## Three Prayers for Scripture Ritual

The True Man’s secret formula says: “When attending the scripture, immortal children and jade maidens hearing these prayers all rejoice and bless the body. This great scripture uses these prayers wholly for ritual and worship. Those who meditate deeply and worship the scripture also pray its text in their hearts; these are the secret prayers of the highest immortals.”

*Joyfully wed to the method as wife, loving the scripture like pearls and jade.  
Holding precepts to govern the six passions, thinking of the dao to send away desires.  
Indifferent and pure, right qi stills, serene and silent the spirit rests.  
Heavenly demons both respect and protect, generation after generation receiving great blessings.*

*Flourishing is the family and nation, thriving are scripture and dao.  
Heaven and humanity share the same vow, drifting into the great vehicle.  
From the heart establish the field of blessings, the dharma wheel rises unceasing.  
The Seven Ancestors born in Heaven, my body soaring in broad daylight.*

*The great dao is profound, cavernous, and void; all thoughts perfectly accord.  
Refining the substance to enter immortality’s truth, thus forming the adamantine body.  
Transcending the Three Realms is difficult; hell’s five sufferings are resolved.  
All return to the Supreme Scripture, quietly contemplate and reverently bow.*

This precept is named the Wisdom Hidden Scripture, the Path of Dao Practice, Original Vow, Highest Grade Precept Treasure True Product. The Most High Void Sovereign transmitted it to the Most High Great Dao Sovereign; the Sovereign transmitted it to the Supreme Subtle Emperor; the Emperor transmitted it to the Nine Subtle Supreme True; the Supreme True transmitted it to the Great Ultimate Master; and then to the Great Supreme Immortal King. It was not revealed to lesser immortals. For a thousand years, passed three times, if one lacks the Most High Golden Slip Immortal Name, one will never meet this scripture’s precepts. Daoists who gather and obtain it must keep it secret and reverently uphold it. Ten immortal children of the Most High attend to the precepts, guarding the disciples’ bodies. At times, there are wise scholars and believers, whose signs cannot be closed to the holy text. On one’s birth fate, the Jiazi, Gengshen, and eight seasonal festivals, one fasts and recites once through.

The Supreme True Man said: “To learn the path of ascending immortality, one must establish one thousand two hundred good merits, never receiving reward; establish three thousand merits, and by broad daylight ascend to Heaven. All aid those who face death’s difficulty, giving kindness to those most worthy. Learning the dao requires that all act according to the law, widely build fields of blessing, awaken great compassion, always stirring dao intent in movement and stillness. Those who can do this, breathing in and out, taking medicines, wearing talismans, reading scriptures, concentrating deeply, tireless for life—how could they not attain immortality? Those without such virtue, taking medicines, wearing talismans, reading scriptures and fasting, end their lives without effect. Scholars, understand these essential words.”

The Supreme True Man said: “Establish three hundred good merits and you may long remain as an earth immortal. If even one merit is incomplete, you must begin anew, losing all former merits. Those who constantly keep it in heart and body are such. You who guide others to do good, that itself is merit.”

The Supreme True Man said: “Constantly think on chanting and breathing, practicing great compassion, placing ancestors before oneself, promoting good and transforming evil, severing all ties, extinguishing thought and guarding emptiness, heart like the Great Profound, seeking only the dao—only then can one be said to speak the path of immortals.”

The Supreme True Man said: “In the past I received the Great Ultimate Wisdom’s ten good encouragements and merit precepts from the Most High Great Dao Void Sovereign, worshipped generation after generation, cultivating the great method, saving beings with ease. This is the natural field of blessings. The Most High universally teaches Heaven and humanity; now each attains their original vow, entering the dharma gate, abiding in non-action, no longer facing ten sufferings and eight hardships, sin ceases and disperses, hell rests, the Three Officials are at peace, generations flourish and rejoice, all escape the net, future lives are safe and peaceful, nature serene, wishes fulfilled. The precepts are as above, to be transmitted to the worthy and faithful.”

## The Ten Good Encouragement Precepts

*Encourage reverent worship of the Three Treasures, nurture dharma masters, make people in the world gentlemen, wise, filial, and talented, noble and towering, born respected, families flourishing.*

The Three Treasures mean the Dao, Scriptures, and Masters. They nurture life and teach goodness, acting as models for humanity—this is called the dharma master.

*Precept: Encourage supporting the copying of scriptures, so that people are wise generation after generation, broadly knowledgeable of wondrous deeds, always living in holy times, seeing scriptures and teachings, able to recite chapters and verses.*

*Precept: Encourage building fasting retreats and quiet places, so that people’s families are noble generation after generation, bodies ascend to Heaven, eating and drinking naturally, always abiding in non-action.*

*Precept: Encourage offerings of incense and oil to aid the needy, so that people’s generations are fragrant and flourishing, incense pure and bright, faces exceptionally noble, heavenly appearance lofty.*

*Precept: Encourage supporting dharma masters’ robes, so that people’s generations are elegant long-lasting, roaming freely in China, not falling to border tribes, men and women proper, crowned with jade pendants.*

*Precept: Encourage kings, parents, and subjects to be loyal and filial, so that people’s generations have many descendants, men and women wise and scholarly, no longer suffering hardships.*

*Precept: Encourage fasting and quiet scripture reading, so that people’s generations do not fall into hell, but ascend to Heaven, respectfully meeting all saints, swiftly regaining form, transforming into royal houses, fulfilling desires, enjoying all delights, the Seven Ancestors rejoicing together, all good karmic conditions complete, beginning and end flourishing, the dharma wheel turning, destined to attain the immortal path.*

*Precept: Encourage all people to study scriptures, so that people’s generations have penetrating wisdom and intelligence, movement and stillness dignified, always teachers of others.*

*Precept: Encourage all almsgiving and admonishment, so that people’s generations have long life, wealth, and happiness, always without resentment.*

*Precept: Encourage all people to remove jealousy and desires, practice all good deeds, so that people’s generations are peaceful and happy, calamities do not arise, the sick heal themselves, officials rise high, respected by all, families noble, Heaven and humanity love and nurture, spirits and demons respect and protect, always born in blessed lands.*

This precept is named the Supreme Wisdom Encouragement Essential Precept of the Highest Grade, all spoken of in the upper scroll of the Great Wisdom Scripture. The dharma was transmitted by the Supreme True Man to govern the path. Those with past blessings who encounter this text must keep it secret and uphold it. Reckless showing to unbelievers brings calamity to the viewer, death as a lower ghost, closure in hell, cycling through five sufferings, future lives losing human path. Those who destroy scriptures and precepts likewise.

The Supreme True Man said: “The greatest evils in human conduct are jealousy, killing, greed, luxury, arrogance, and lust. If these dwell in the heart, they surely cut short your years. To clutch these while learning immortality—is this not sorrowful?”

The Supreme True Man said: “Five thousand characters of dao and virtue—this is the great scripture. The dao thus connects Heaven, Earth, and humanity; all things follow it to their beginning and end. The highest students reciting it become Supreme Immortal Kings; the middle students become flying immortals; the lower students become turning wheel holy kings, never entering hell, always born in blessed lands. When their time ends, the Heavenly Emperor’s cloud chariot welcomes their soul and spirit, placing them in blessed halls. This saves countless beings beyond measure, impossible to fully describe.”

Once there was a woman who received and recited this scripture. Her husband was always angry and resentful, but did not stop her. The woman then ascended to Heaven by broad daylight; the husband died and entered hell, suffering trials for many years. The woman flew and watched over him, ordering him to read the *Dao and Virtue Scripture*; now he is to be saved. At that time, heavenly beings descended; the Sovereign Lord of Mount Tai called and questioned him. He fully answered: “I was always taught by the woman, revering this scripture. The woman ascended to immortality; I sought rescue because of past kindness.” The Sovereign Lord said: “Though you did not study, you often revered the Great Dao, respected and believed in scriptures and dharma; you may be sent to the blessed hall and given heavenly food. In a thousand years you will be born human and may receive and recite this scripture.” The man said: “If I gain human birth, I will surely study this scripture to seek salvation for the world.” After a thousand years, born human, at age thirteen he began to love the five thousand characters, studied under a master, received secret formulas, was talented and wise, refused royal invitations, and ascended to immortality by broad daylight. His ancestors respected scriptures; his virtuous wife aided his salvation, all due to past kindness.

Once there was a wise and enlightened Daoist who fasted in a quiet chamber but could not obtain midday meal. At that time, common men and women revered and delighted in the great method. They were moved by this Daoist’s endurance of hunger while reciting scriptures, daily preparing midday meals, coming to listen to the scriptures. The Daoist grieved their faith, transmitted scriptures to men and women, taught secret formulas, each reciting ten thousand times. The Most High Dragon Chariot descended to welcome them; they ascended to Heaven by broad daylight. Such examples are many and cannot all be recorded. Even if ordinary people cannot learn the immortal path, all who receive the five thousand characters and reverently respect them attain the path of non-action, preserving life in the world, bringing peace and joy to their families, and upon death entering Heaven, not the prisons of the Three Officials or hell. The secret lies in faith and love; then this great blessing can be seated. The great true scripture of the great cavern, the Supreme Profound Hidden Treasure Scripture, must not be passed to ordinary people; all must be those who can learn immortality, who should cultivate and recite it. If lightly transmitted to commoners, they will share the same hell as the Seven Ancestors and grandparents, undergoing the trials of the five poisons. Be cautious, be cautious.

The Supreme True Man said: “The confusion of the world is that people distance themselves from their ancestors, competing instead to serve ghosts and spirits, killing life to seek life—how far from life indeed! In life they do not cultivate goodness or govern the body, endure cutting off desires; at death they lavishly bury their bones, unaware that soul and spirit have already undergone the five poisons, imprisoned in hell, suffering in the Three Paths, cycling through the Five Paths. Life is short, yet they hoard wealth without limit, never satisfied, burdening themselves. Blessings end, sin arrives; body dies, name vanishes, wealth scatters like dust in a fierce wind. Daoists hold fast to fasting, incense, and scripture reading—these are the world’s great affairs—but they do not wish to see, and seeing is like not seeing. Hearing shamans’ ghostly words, they lavish gifts and offerings. Fasting and quiet bring blessings; shamans’ singing and dancing invite disaster. The disaster reaches both; their souls and spirits suffer punishment, calamities endless, going back and forth in the three evil paths, their suffering hard to escape. Sin continues into future lives; some fall to six beasts, losing human path; if reborn human, they are lowly, with incomplete senses, ugly form, foul qi, stubborn and hateful, abandoned by all, wandering the world, starving and cold until death. Such people bear the sins of their ancestors and come from six beasts to return to human path. If in this life one endures hardship and poverty, repents past and cultivates the future, seeks and serves the dharma to free oneself, one’s retribution will gradually lessen, and in the next life one will receive great blessings, born in wealthy noble families, appearance complete, countenance dignified, radiant and bright, beloved by all, compassionate, faithful, talented, with grand plans, male or female as per original vow. Seek good friends as causes and conditions; all will meet in the dark assembly as brothers, disciples, and descendants, thus generations are wise and filial, endlessly generating each other. Therefore it is said: cause and effect are intertwined; who knows their limit? Also it is said that descendants never cease ancestral offerings—this is what it means.”

The Supreme True Man said: “The path of mystery and purity is what the ancients cultivated to prolong life and extend destiny, achieving longevity. Now people do the opposite, consuming years and shortening life, inviting early death. Can they still blame sorcery and evil? The fault lies with themselves; is this not sorrowful?”

The Supreme True Man said: “Those who learn the dao must first be filial to parents, loyal to sovereigns, compassionate to those they serve, trustworthy to friends; their words must be reliable, admonishing evil and promoting good, without this or that selfishness, not violating external teachings, able to serve humanity. Next, abstain from alcohol, lust, jealousy, killing, luxury, greed, arrogance, and laziness. Next, avoid five pungent spices, fatty foods, and rich flavors. Next, let thoughts combine with deep meditation, the heart close to purity and emptiness. Next, take medicines to rest the root, uphold great precepts, strengthen the body, diligently focus the will, guide and draw breath, harmonize fluids, build merits, endure what others cannot endure, cut off what others cannot cut, walk paths others cannot walk, dwell where others cannot dwell, wear clothes others cannot wear, eat food others cannot eat, guard what others cannot guard, learn what others cannot learn. Only with such dao practice can one be stabilized by numinous medicines, fed on cloud sprouts, with corpse worms sinking and falling, filth and leaks eliminated, the three palaces cleansed, the five organs peaceful and at rest. One will fast long and think deeply, quietly chant the profound scriptures, savor all wonders, combined with elixir fluids. Those who can do this, how could they not attain the path of ascending immortality?”

The Heavenly Venerable said to the Supreme True Man: “If one does not cultivate humanity, is not loyal to parents and sovereigns, indulges in wine and lust, kills and covets, is arrogant and luxurious, deceives the worthy, borrows and does not repay—if one has even a little of such conduct, and cannot change, but wishes to hold it while fasting and learning the dao, hoping for the flesh to fly—how pitiful, how pitiful! Such a person will long dwell in hell, tread the five poisons, the mountain of knives and sword trees, boiling fire and scorching flames, cooking and stewing the five bodies, seeking death but unable, hungry eating iron, thirsty drinking fire, exposed to cold ice, skin torn to the bone, then handed to the Three Officials, exiled to mountains and seas, bearing earth and stone, whipped and punished, enduring the Three Followers and Five Paths, going back and forth through ten sufferings and eight hardships, their pain boundless, impossible to fully tell.”

The Supreme True Man said: “Such a person is worse than an outer learner among ordinary people, who reverently cultivates benevolence and righteousness, respects and believes in dao and virtue, follows only goodness. They let transformations come and go with the times, roam freely within the domain, pure and at ease. When their time ends, they enter blessed abodes, not prisons. They may become ghosts or spirits, but in future lives regain human path, not losing their original vow, turning to faith roots, connecting with sages and saints, their filth daily exhausted, ultimately entering the immortal dao.”

The Supreme True Man said: “The trouble is that people obtain the full human path but do not cultivate virtue and nurture nature to perfect their destiny. The trouble is hearing scriptures but not believing. The trouble is believing scriptures but coveting wealth and not receiving. The trouble is receiving scriptures but not reciting. The trouble is reciting but not cultivating deeds. The trouble is cultivating deeds but not maintaining the path. The trouble is serving masters but not enduring to the end. The trouble is taking medicines but not harmonizing breath. The trouble is incomplete dao practice yet boasting of ascending. The trouble is fasting and reading scriptures, dwelling in quiet mountains but unable to bear their worries. These ten troubles dwell in the human body; if not guarded against, the body cannot be saved. Therefore it is said: ‘There is a great trouble—having a body.’ This is what it means. Can one not think on this? Can one not think on this?”

The Supreme True Man finished transmitting the scripture, explaining the precepts, singing of the pain of the Three Followers and Five Paths, lamenting in words:

*The Three Powers and myriad things, each with their lifespan.  
Beginnings and ends await kalpas; blessings end, Heaven and Earth collapse.  
Going back and forth in the Five Paths, how bitter the cycle of death and life!  
Turning in the Three Followers, departure and calamity together.*

*Great sages heed these precepts, endure nature, cut off passions.  
Fools disbelieve the law, sin and pain always embrace them.  
My thoughts for the world never cease, so I again solemnly warn.  
If you wish to cross these troubles, return to the Most High Scripture.*

*Sin and blessing come not from others, surely arise from yourself.  
Great sages close their mouths, wishing to sever all evil ties.  
Extinguish thought, return to forgetfulness, cause and effect await long extinction.  
Spread the dao to calm the world; in the end, see the true reality.*

*Lust and jealousy are the chief calamities, the utmost harm to the body.  
Nurturing such beings surely brings early death and mutilation.  
Knowing evil yet not changing—is this what the dao allows?  
Harboring poison while fasting straightens my heart, causing long sighs.*

*Past fate is true, the weak and lost say it is not.  
All want to see before their eyes, then say it is far away.  
Great sages illuminate dao teachings, pitying the stubborn fools.  
Lingering thoughts of your suffering, diligently cause me worry.*

*Life is already exhausted, like fire in grease.  
The Four Greats temporarily meet, the Five Substances temporarily borrowed.  
In prime years one must diligently learn, hasten to preserve self.  
Blessings end, body and spirit scatter, darkly descending to hell.  
The supreme sages fear this, seeking the dao to cross these woes.*

*To learn the immortal path is urgent, uphold precepts to govern heart and passions.  
Void and pure, right qi abides, immortals and saints seek each other.  
If you do not believe the law and words, why dwell in mountain forests?*

*Great sages delight in scriptures and precepts, receiving them as body treasures.  
Studying always, regretting the late start, governing the body, regretting not earlier.  
Soon opening the hidden mysteries, suddenly years grow old.  
Holding the scroll, absorbing your utmost, death’s pain and trouble will return.  
Therefore I, in my youth, abandoned the world to learn the dao.*

The Supreme True Man said: “When I first learned the dao, I received it from the Most High Void Sovereign, upheld and cultivated it, thus becoming a True Man. Daoists who wish to receive my great precept text must first read it through to show their heart. Those who are truly students of immortality must bring faith and come to the master’s gate, then fast three days, contemplate the dao and precepts. Only then is the great transmission. These precepts are weighty; each has powerful divine departments guarding the person. Be cautious, be cautious.”

The Immortal Elder said: “These great precepts are bestowed upon those learning the immortal path. They seek the extraordinary beyond the world; all things must return to emptiness. All are methods to cross the sufferings of the Three Followers and attain the dao. Those who encounter it fulfill their past vows. Those who receive it should follow it diligently and cultivate without slackening.” The Immortal Elder received the precepts on the day of the Primordial Correctness and composed this ode:

*Silent in the dark famous mountain,  
Gazing at towering cliffs.  
Pure snow veils the front courtyard,  
Strong winds sweep the eastern woods.  
Facing the Heavenly Venerable’s countenance,  
Delighting in mysteries and scattering thoughts.  
Pitying the world’s fallen sins,  
Sorrowing that thoughts do not depart.  
Turning away from precepts to believe evil spirits,  
Abandoning fasting and quiet for fine wine and music.  
Wheeling through the Five Paths and Three Followers,  
Entering hell’s deep gloom.  
Such suffering is beyond words,  
Hard to bear life and death again.  
Only dao and virtue save beings,  
How could one wait in hardship and not seek?*

The Immortal Elder told his disciple Zheng Siyuan: “In my youth I traveled to famous mountains, treading cliffs and ravines among beasts, enduring hardship to the utmost, restraining emotions and thoughts, giving mouth and hand in kindness. Later, I became human, embraced the dao, calmed the world, constantly cultivated compassion and love, kept the dao and preserved truth, never daring to substitute it. I fasted and purified for a year without end. On the winter solstice, a heavenly spirit descended, granting me the great scripture and the path of the highest immortals. The spirit commanded me to fast long and quietly, recite according to the scripture, then learn it, thus becoming a True Man. The scriptures and dao I received are most precious to the Most High, not learned by lesser immortals. Through kalpas, always transmitted by highest immortals, Immortal Elder, Immortal King, Immortal Minister—not only me. My ancestors and you made this vow together, performing good merits diligently without slack, attaining immortal names in the Profound Capital. Now we are teachers and friends, thus we transmit to each other. When I depart this world, there will be compassionate lay practitioners who come to my gate in future lives. You must entrust this present dao work to them, all matters fully communicated, the dharma recorded generation after generation. This is due to past kindness and cause and condition. You must pass it on according to proper method to worthy disciples. If none appear, seal it in the Five Great Mountains. This is the Supreme True Man’s secret formula; keep it secret, be cautious, always think on it.”
