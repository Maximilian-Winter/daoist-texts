## Scroll One of the Scripture of the Left Immortal Lord of the Supreme Ultimate’s Inquiry

The Immortal Lord bowed deeply and respectfully saluted the Most High Supreme Ultimate, the Lofty Elder Laozi, the Peerless Dharma Master, and said:  
“Concerning the methods of good merit and virtue, cultivation and practice, I wish to hear your essential teachings.”  

The Dharma Master replied:  
“What you ask is of utmost importance. To learn the dao and cultivate virtue, the highest is to perfect good merit. Only then should one observe fasting and purification, breathe in the primal harmony, and draw forth the essence of flowing rosy clouds and the fivefold brilliance.  
To learn the dao without moving to cultivate good merit and fasting is but idle labor in mountain forests.  
Therefore, the *Scripture of Supreme Ultimate Wisdom*, upper chapter, says: ‘Cure illness and heal disease, serve the master’s treasure, establish quietude and build dwellings, collate and verify scriptures, cultivate fasting and recall the dao, burn incense and light lamps, recite to aid all beings, spread transformation among the ignorant, admonish to calm and dispel evil, bestow kindness on the destitute, rescue from calamity, protect the living after the master’s passing, dig wells along the borders, plant orchards and groves, teach the unawakened, encourage good deeds, possess virtue toward family and nation, observe movement and stillness, deeds worthy to emulate, teachings and regulations to follow.’  
This is the conduct of the daoist.  
When speaking to a ruler, be benevolent to the state; to a father, be loving to children; to a teacher, be affectionate to the multitude; to an elder brother, be respectful in conduct; to a minister, be loyal to superiors; to a son, be filial to parents; to friends, be trustworthy in friendship; to a wife, be chaste to her husband; to a husband, be harmonious in the household; to disciples, be reverent in rites; to common folk, be diligent in farming; to fellow daoists, abide in the dao; to foreigners, each guards their domain; to servants and slaves, be careful in affairs.  
Let heart and mouth accord, the heart as master of the mouth, the mouth as guest of the heart, and the heart’s thought be immediate.  
Hence it is said: ‘When merit fills three thousand, one ascends to Heaven by day; when good merit overflows, one descends in a cloud chariot; to spread the dao endlessly, thus one attains undying life.’  
Those of good virtue are esteemed by the Most High, revered by the great saints of the heavens. This is called adapting to worldly transformation, the great vehicle’s enterprise, not to be undertaken by the superior person lightly.”

The Most High Elder Laozi said:  
“In ancient times, people were simple and pure, each harboring dao and virtue, empty-hearted and mysteriously tranquil, acting by non-action.  
When this spirit dispersed, a hundred contests arose, myriad streams divided, cunning attacked cunning, foolishness and wisdom clashed, ghosts and spirits seized power, many saints emerged, creating teachings to transform, only to urge people to cultivate goodness and self-guard.  
Thus arose the five scriptures of Confucian and commoner works, daoist and immortal teachings, all ultimately returning to goodness.  
The words of immortals are like the great Brahma’s speech to heavenly beings; immortals speak the supreme celestial language of Myriad Radiance.  
The profound origin is no different, thus dividing transformation between heaven and beings, widely opening dharma gates, all entering the hall of non-action together.”

The Most High Elder Laozi said:  
“Among the daoist methods, none is closer than fasting. There are many fasting methods, mostly similar in essence.  
The most potent merit is the Most High Numinous Treasure Fast, yet few in the world can learn it.  
Those who do are all great vehicle practitioners, blessed by past lives, close to immortality.  
There is also the Three Heavens Fast, similar to the Numinous Treasure.  
The Immortal Lord said: ‘The Three Heavens Fast is the dharma received from the Three Heavens Dharma Masters, called the Scripture of Essential Teachings. It is secondary to the above.’  
This method is fully contained in the Five Titles texts, nothing omitted.  
But the heavenly scripture is profound and wondrous, beyond worldly sages’ comprehension.  
Those who penetrate it are all supreme immortals and true ones, mysteriously united with the Most High.  
Therefore, middle and lower immortals cannot fathom its meaning, merely seeing but not knowing—what is there to say?  
Hence all sages have a final song of reflection.”  

The Most High Elder Laozi said:  
“Pure fasting, reciting scriptures, cultivating virtue and establishing conduct, the immortal dao naturally forms; why must one hide in mountains and forests?  
Simply avoid desire and impurity; mountains and forests are not the sole abode of the dao.  
The greatest daoist scripture is no more than five thousand characters, the great chant of the Grand Profound True.  
This scripture is ethereal and remote; reciting it summons great saints descending in cloud chariots and treasure canopies, galloping dragon steeds, ascending to Heaven by day.  
The five thousand characters are the ancestors of dao and virtue, the truest of the true, not for the base or impure, to be read from beginning to end.  
Expounding its wondrous meaning, kings and nobles attain governance; fasting and reciting it, the body gains flight as an immortal, the seven ancestors receive blessings, returning to the fetal form and taking shape, born above in Heaven, below among kings and nobles on earth.  
All require secret formulas of the True Cavern; the dao must be fulfilled, recited to summon clouds and dragons.  
It must not be chanted in the human realm; if so chanted, the great demon king will destroy it.  
The Profound Cavern Chant is the supreme high teaching of the Upper Clarity, pure and refreshing, the utmost subtle text, also to be recited with beginning and end, with fasting and purification.  
The True Cavern can be completed but not begun; those who begin it have attained the dao.  
Other scriptures have their own order and rank, not to be surpassed.  
Surpassing them requires courage and vigorous progress, establishing great merit; the weak and lost dare not hear it.”

The Most High Elder Laozi said:  
“When people cultivate good and advance diligently, with compassion touching all things, receiving the great scriptures at home, worshipping with focused heart without slackening, they will surely attain extinction and liberation, gain the way of non-action, ascend as immortals, be born generation after generation in noble families of kings and lords.  
This is called the turning wheel of the holy king’s family, ultimately entering the true immortal dao.”

The Most High Elder Laozi said:  
“People’s roots each have causes and conditions, variously arising, all coming from their vows; without a vow, nothing is accomplished.  
The lesser vehicle’s study conflicts with the great vehicle, not because causes and conditions are subtle and profound.  

The Most High Dharma Master’s song says:  
‘Seeing a daoist brave and diligent, sitting upright at home’s gate, composing heart to receive scriptures, reciting morning and night, thinking of the immortal dao;  
Seeing a daoist brave and diligent, serving a bright master, requesting scriptures, reciting morning and night, thinking of the immortal dao;  
Seeing a daoist brave and diligent, not valuing jewels, admiring scriptures and dharma, reciting morning and night, thinking of the immortal dao;  
Seeing a sage brave and diligent, secluded in mountains and forests, reciting scriptures, thinking of the immortal dao;  
Seeing a sage brave and diligent, receiving scriptures from master, worshipping at home, morning and night without slackening, thinking of the immortal dao;  
Seeing a sage brave and diligent, abandoning desire and leaving the room, sitting upright in a cavern, thinking of the immortal dao;  
Seeing a sage brave and diligent, following master respectfully, entering mountains and marshes, thinking of the immortal dao;  
Seeing a sage brave and diligent, casting off glory and wealth, wandering afar seeking scriptures, requesting to receive and recite, thinking of the immortal dao;  
Seeing a sage brave and diligent, loyal and filial to superiors, seated in high halls, splendid and noble, holding heart unmoved, as if a mountain forest, reciting scriptures, thinking of the immortal dao;  
Seeing a sage brave and diligent, hungry and cold to the bone, requesting scriptures without ceasing, intent on the great vehicle, thinking of the immortal dao;  
Seeing a sage born in noble gate, austere and talented, brave and diligent, single-hearted reciting scriptures, thinking of the immortal dao;  
Seeing a sage often ill, brave and diligent, reciting scriptures day and night, thinking of the immortal dao;  

Seeing a sage brave and diligent, repeatedly afflicted by illness, requesting supreme scriptures, thinking of the immortal dao;  
Seeing a woman brave and diligent, seeking to transform body to male, reciting scriptures, thinking of the immortal dao;  
Seeing a woman brave and diligent, sitting upright in a secluded chamber, reciting supreme scriptures, thinking of the immortal dao;  
Seeing a woman brave and diligent, pressed but unyielding, heart steadfast, thinking of the immortal dao;  
Seeing a sage brave and diligent, parents differing, fond of scriptures, thinking of the immortal dao;  
Seeing a sage brave and diligent, without cause to see scriptures, thinking of the immortal dao;  
Seeing a sage brave and diligent, imprisoned, holding heart day and night, thinking of the immortal dao;  
Seeing a sage encountering hardship and evil, diligent without cease, thinking of the immortal dao;  
Seeing a sage brave and diligent, family all deceased, sorrowful parting, seven days after death, fasting and repenting, day and night unremitting, thinking of the immortal dao;  
Seeing a sage brave and diligent, master and friends deceased, establishing fasts for them, thinking of the immortal dao;  
Seeing a sage brave and diligent, noble and true, uplifting seven generations of parents, thinking of the immortal dao;  
Seeing a sage brave and diligent, seeking peace in the world, thinking of the immortal dao.’  

People have such causes and conditions; the Most High Dao Eye has long seen them, thus sings their virtues to encourage their resolve.”  

The Immortal Lord bowed and said:  
“I now take my leave of these words.”  

At that time, all heavenly beings arose together to salute, then each departed.

## Scroll Two of the Scripture of the Left Immortal Lord of the Supreme Ultimate’s Inquiry  

**The Scripture of the Original Conduct and Past Causes of the Most High Profound Numinous Treasure**

The Immortal Lord inquired of the Supreme Ultimate True Person, the Most High Dharma Master:  
“What root conduct must a person cultivate to be seen in the world enjoying blessings, with a proper family gate, flourishing descendants, good causes and conditions, uninterrupted generation after generation, upon death ascending to Heaven above, born below among kings and nobles, intelligent and benevolent scholars, reverent and faithful to scriptures and teachings, loving mountains and forests, often reciting subtle words, ultimately attaining the immortal dao?”

The Dharma Master answered:  
“Well asked. Each person’s life has its root conduct, past causes, and fate roots, variously linked, wish following wish, kind following kind, turning and arising, fortune and misfortune drawing each other.  
Therefore, generation after generation is unbroken, tastes differ, intentions vary, all due to prior vows.  
Those who wish to cultivate the dao and form ties with sages and saints must observe great precepts, widely build fields of blessing, and broadly bestow merit and virtue.  
Some attain flying immortals; some attain heavenly immortals; some attain earthly immortals; some, upon death, are born in Heaven; some become ghosts and spirits; some become officials under the Six Heavens’ Great Demon Kings; some, upon death, are born among kings and nobles, the honored among men; some are relied upon by all, wealthy over the world; some attain talent and intelligence; some attain noble and dignified appearance, radiant qi and pure fragrance; some attain benevolence, loyalty, filial piety, chastity, and simplicity; some attain literary talents, conduct worthy of emulation in movement and stillness; some attain awe-inspiring majesty, admired by all; some are devoted to the Three Treasures, offering diligently; some love mountains and waters, quiet and fond of scriptures, burning incense and observing fasts; some worship the Profound Origin; some transform female to male, radiant and elegant; some have pure and orderly family gates, generation after generation, following their original vows; good and wise ones become my descendants, peaceful and noble without limit; some are seen in the world enjoying blessings, at death receiving retribution; some descendants receive blessings, gaining my past merits.  

What is the dao? It is to respond with no mind.  
Sentient beings of the four classes cultivate blessings and virtue, but must have original vows.  
The retribution of blessings all depends on the time of vow establishment.  
Once merit and virtue are set, and vows fixed, the retribution is vast, like waiting from dusk to dawn.  
Worldly people are shallow and untrusting of dharma words, each claiming cunning, relying on their own ideas, lightly dismissing past fate, thinking it false creation.  
They mock the supreme scriptures as fantastic, piling up greed and desire, sitting and waiting for retribution, hoping for swift response but it is slow.  
Thus the mysterious teaching is delayed and dim, the world’s dao lost, Heaven and beings suffering—this all caused by their own conduct, which pains the Most High deeply.”

The Immortal Lord said:  
“I have heard of past fate, causes and conditions, birth and death retribution. What then is the root conduct and highest precept?”

The Master said:  
“The Most High Wisdom’s highest precepts, one hundred and eighty in number, are all supreme precepts and laws.  
Those who observe the Most High Ten Precepts also gain this blessing.  
Now I shall explain them to you; do you not wish to observe them?”  

The Immortal Lord respectfully withdrew and bowed, saying:  
“Yes, yes. The Heavenly Venerable, please teach them; I will observe them.”  

The Dharma Master said:  
“The Ten Precepts are:  
One, do not envy those superior, nor suppress the wise and bright.  
Two, do not drink wine or eat meat, defiling the three palaces.  
Three, do not commit lewd acts with others’ wives or daughters, nor crave fine and slippery things.  
Four, do not abandon the poor, old, sick, or lowly.  
Five, do not slander good people or attack fellow students.  
Six, do not greedily hoard wealth, unwilling to give.  
Seven, do not kill life, nor worship the Six Heavens’ ghosts and spirits.  
Eight, do not arbitrarily interpret scriptures as falsehood.  
Nine, do not betray master’s love, nor deceive new teachings.  
Ten, be equal-hearted, with benevolence and filial piety toward all.  

Those who observe these Ten Precepts, clearly establish vows, will surely receive retribution.  
If one sees evil deeds unpunished in the world, it is because the past life’s remaining blessings are not yet exhausted; when blessings end, misfortune comes.  
If one sees good deeds unrewarded, it is because past life’s remaining calamities are not yet exhausted; when calamities end, blessings come—sometimes in future lives, not necessarily this one.  
If one greatly builds good merit in this life, balancing merit and demerit, one can avoid past calamities.  
Giving kindness expecting reward will not be rewarded; yin and yang are certain.  
Those who wish to enter the immortal dao must have merit as numerous as dust and sand to be suitable.  

The Ten Evils must not be committed:  
One, drinking, lust, insatiable greed.  
Two, secretly harming the world, slandering daoists.  
Three, slighting masters, despising dharma, arrogantly ignoring the Three Treasures.  
Four, stealing scriptures, falsely declaring dao essentials.  
Five, borrowing and not returning, deceiving all people.  
Six, killing life for taste, saying one thing but meaning another.  
Seven, betraying kindness, violating prohibitions.  
Eight, neglecting scripture recitation, criticizing others.  
Nine, blaming and resenting others, angry at the four classes.  
Ten, arbitrarily judging scripture meaning, damaging sacred texts, disbelieving fate, acting on impulse, defiling and disrespecting the four elements, forgetting the path of birth.  

These are the Ten Evil Precepts.  
Those who violate them may be unjustly killed by ghosts and spirits, judged by officials of the yang realm, safe places become dangerous, good deeds meet evil, affairs go awry.  
Or they die and enter hell, locked in heavy bars, unseen by the three lights, tortured day and night, hugging bronze pillars, treading knife mountains, climbing sword trees, entering carved boiling pots, swallowing fire and smoke, facing cold ice, enduring all five sufferings as scripture describes.  
After hell, they serve the Three Officials as laborers, exiled to mountains and seas, whipped countless times.  
After that, they are reborn in the world, often as lowly people.  
Or as servants, with human form but no human feelings.  
Or born among border barbarians and foreign lands.  
Or born with ailments.  
Good and evil conditions arise accordingly; their sin and blessing are hard to explain.  
The retribution of sin and blessing is like the moon’s reflected light, like the ocean’s tide to the shore, an inevitable time, never mistaken.  
Sin and blessing never perish, like shadow following form, like wheels turning on an axle.”

The Supreme Ultimate True Person then composed the *Song of Observing Precepts*:  

“The dao’s root is no-mind, all acts become fields of blessing.  
Establishing merit has no fixed master; original vows depend on the person.  
Empty oneself to respond to all beings, focus the heart evenly without bias.  
Great saints expand the supreme teaching, like rain nourishing the heavens.  
High hills are all encompassed, always humble to form deep pools.  
The sea is king of a hundred rivers, able to cast off dragon scales.  
Through myriad kalpas, preserving order and use, not just in one’s years.  
Observing precepts without pause, generation after generation forming good ties.  
Diligently thinking of the great vehicle, one will surely embody the true dao.”

The Supreme Ultimate True Person then composed the *Song of Violating Precepts*:  

“People’s roots come from original vows; vows determine overcoming great calamities.  
Pure thought observing the Ten Precepts can transcend the eight hardships.  
Those who violated the profound teaching in past lives, how can they find peace now?  
Foolish and blind, neglecting life, sin deepens and they sigh long.  
Facing the future like a shadow’s reflection, it chills the heart.  
Born in lowly places, sorrowful with no moment of joy.”

The Immortal Lord dared to ask:  
“Regarding the depth of fasting, the height and low of merit, the cycle of ten evil and ten good, turning without pause, when virtue deepens and merit is complete, entering stillness and emptiness—how are the ranks and grades arranged?”

The Dharma Master answered:  
“All such matters are to be emptied, the interplay of being and non-being.  
Cultivate virtue and nourish spirit, accumulate merit and condense truth.  
The true body is emptiness, passing in and out of being, hidden and tranquil, supremely wondrous, preserving light and subtlety, saving and ferrying all, serving as the bridge of all dharmas.  
In the cycle of learning the dao, nothing precedes fasting.  
Fasting surpasses all but the Numinous Treasure Fast.  
Its method is profound and wondrous, not to be proclaimed to worldly commoners, only passed to those with past merits.  
Those without heavy past ties should not see it; if they do, they should not like it—this is due to original vows, thus it cannot be forced.  
Since countless kalpas, immortal saints have passed down secret formulas, hidden and unwritten.  
I was commanded by the Most High to teach the Immortal Lord’s son, who wrote it well.  
This method benefits all seekers of the dao.  
Though kalpas turn and worlds change, this scripture does not alter.  
The dao rises with the world, virtue follows transformation.  
Sages are hard to meet, the dao hard to see, scriptures hard to hear, holy eras rare, sages hard to encounter.  
Therefore, only those with good merit may attend this assembly.  
In former times, when the Zhengyi True Person studied the dao, he received the Numinous Treasure Fast.  
After attaining the dao, he said this fast is venerable, thus composed the *Five Titles Text of the Numinous Treasure*, which contains fasting methods, called the *Scripture of Essential Teachings*, mostly similar, also following this scripture’s fasting method.  
The Taiyi fasting method is the profoundest of the profound, teaching beginners of the lesser vehicle.  
The Three Caverns Profound Scripture calls it the great vehicle’s practitioners, first saving others, then themselves.  
Sitting, rising, lying, breathing, always with compassion for all, all thoughts without weariness, virtue equal to the Most High, dao transcending the Void Sovereign, grace filling the Ten Directions, perfectly matching the profound true, leading the heavens, aspiring to the original dao.”

“To learn the dao, always keep clothes pure and clean, prepare incense and light high incense lamps, place scriptures on the seat.  
Worship with focused thought, preserve truth, breathe out and in to guide nourishment, repent and thank seven generations of parents and present and past heavy sins and evil ties.  
Give alms and establish merit, long fasts in quietude, fix original vows.  
Make heart empty and intention profound, then the true dao can be accomplished.  
Prepare headscarves, coarse garments, simple skirts, read scriptures wearing the regulated dharma clothing, do not borrow from others or wear unclean places.  
Called dharma clothing, it is always attended by three divine youths.  
Once a sage welcomed a daoist; the daoist could not go immediately, so wore coarse garments to meet him.  
Arriving at the house, the person revered incense, worshipping as if seeing a daoist.  
The divine youths appeared and said: ‘The daoist sent me.’  
The host did not know they were divine youths.  
The sick person soon recovered, the household safe.  
The divine youths told the host: ‘The sick is healed, the daoist need not return, the sage may send back the dharma clothing to the daoist.’  
The host did so.  
The daoist inquired, and was told: ‘One day of suffering, invited the master to fast, the master was busy, sent divine youths, did not come to attend the fast. The sick is now healed, sending back the dharma clothing.’  
The daoist was amazed and frightened, saying: ‘I was arranging dharma affairs all day, almost went, the host let the sage leave, and did not come again. I did not go not from breaking faith, but no one to send. I did not know your household was healed; this is due to the host’s heart fully causing it.’  
Asked what the divine youths looked like, the host said: ‘About fifteen or sixteen years old, dignified appearance, like a scholar.’  
The daoist thought: ‘None of my disciples look like this; perhaps a divine being descended.’  
Therefore, dharma clothing must be pure and properly made; otherwise, ghosts harm people, and punishments are as clear as the law.  
If decayed or ruined, one must wear it oneself, not use it otherwise.”

The Immortal Lord said:  
“This is the first I hear of the dharma clothing’s power and spirit. May I now observe the Ten Precepts?”

The True Person answered:  
“I once received them from the Most High Great Dao Lord, and I observe them, generation after generation forming good ties, dwelling in blessings, attaining the immortal dao.  
Now I pass them to you, remember them well.  
Once a mortal observed these precepts, thought of the dao without loss, extended life and prosperity, family gate flourishing.  
May future generations be learned, intelligent in scriptures, ultimately entering the immortal dao, on the day of extinction directly ascending the blessed hall, food and clothing natural, joyful and at ease.  
Later reborn in the world, studying the great dao scriptures, intelligent and penetrating, becoming worldly masters, all understanding.  
Also mortals who greatly build merit, fasting, offering lamps to the Three Treasures, diligently without slack, wishing to be born among kings and nobles, becoming noble persons, dignified in appearance.  
At death, flying immortals welcome them, directly ascending Heaven, food and clothing natural, joy without effort.  
Later born in noble families governing by the dao, good at merit and virtue, fasting and precepts, bestowing kindness, lamps and repentance, resolving seven generations of parents’ karmic knots, offering to the Three Treasures.  
Wishing my descendants to be noble, turning fortune and ties, beautiful in appearance, wise and penetrating, always meeting the wise, offering to the Three Treasures.  
At death, flying immortals welcome them, directly ascending the blessed hall, joy indescribable.  
Later born in royal families, wealth multiplied, intelligent and outstanding, pure and lofty, people prosperous and homes peaceful.  
Also nobles practicing these merits, wishing descendants to ultimately enter immortal dao.  
Later generations fond of dao and scriptures, reading all texts, immediately ascending as immortals, flying by day.  
Also mortals practicing these merits, wishing descendants always see the Three Caverns great scriptures.  
Descendants see the great scriptures, receive and recite them, respected throughout the Three Realms.  
Also mortals practicing these merits, wishing to be superior daoists, broadly mastering supreme scriptures.  
Descendants become daoists, mastering supreme scriptures, becoming masters of all dharmas.  
Also mortals practicing these merits, wishing descendants to enter mountains to learn dao.  
Descendants dwell in mountains and rocks, diligently thinking of the dao.  
Also women practicing these merits, wishing to transform body to male; descendants become males.  
Also sages practicing these merits, assisting masters in managing scriptures, wishing descendants to encounter scriptures and dao, fulfilling wishes.  
Also sages practicing these merits, reciting scriptures and precepts, offering to the Three Treasures, single-heartedly thinking of the dao, wishing to repay seven generations of parents’ karmic kindness, born above in Heaven, returning to fetal form among kings and nobles, my body ascending immortal, eternally still and non-action.  

I have observed those who bestow kindness and cultivate the dao; none fail in their seeking, provided they have original vows.  
Vows fixed, retribution surely comes, like shadow responding to form, like the seasons’ cycles.  
But sin and blessing are not both repaid together; their differences vary, merit and demerit shift, sometimes in future lives, sometimes in this one.  
Sin and blessing arise from one’s root conduct, not idle tales of dao and virtue.  
Yet people desire immediate repayment as proof, postponing to future lives, calling it no spirit.  
Fools thus indulge desire, lightly ignoring Heaven’s net, encountering the eight hardships, treading the ten sufferings.  
At such times, none know the cause. Is it not sorrowful? Is it not sorrowful?  

The human body is but a borrowed vessel, arising from darkness.  
When qi disperses at death, spirit and truth depart separately, the body divides and transforms into worms that eat the ashes, becoming all ghosts, suffering poison, unlike life before.  
Is it not pitiful? Is it not pitiful?  
Only by attaining the dao body, the true body remains safe.  
The way to attain the dao is to accumulate virtue and do good, rotate the body and refine the spirit, thus forming the true body.  

Also, mortals seeing daoists fasting quietly, lighting lamps, burning incense, worshipping, moving in procession, then awakening dao hearts, wishing to offer to the Three Treasures, but their family is poor with no rare delicacies, offering only a few stalks of vegetables to assist midday meals.  
At that time their heart thought: ‘May my descendants be wealthy, greatly offering to the Three Treasures, broadly bestowing fields of blessing.’  
Once seeing worldly peace and longevity to the limit of Heaven’s mandate, at death entering hell for retribution, the Most High commanded: though the person had some minor sins, diligent and earnest merit compensates for demerit.  
They are then allowed to ascend the blessed hall, born later in noble families, generation after generation as sons of lords, with natural fortune and rank, fond of dao and virtue, offering to the Three Treasures, deep in talent and wisdom.  

Also one person saw a true daoist fasting quietly reading scriptures and laughed, saying: ‘He chants empty scriptures to empty air, what does he hope for? One meal a day with empty belly, this is a sinful man.’  
The daoist compassionately explained, but the man held to his opinion.  
After death, he entered hell, tortured with five sufferings complete, prison guards accused him: ‘In life you mocked daoists and defamed the Three Treasures; now you suffer this retribution; your descendants will be lowly and poor.’  

Also one person, dignified in appearance, studied worldly scriptures and dao books, understanding scripture meaning profoundly, said: ‘This seems like ancient nonsense; I seek to understand daoists and nobles, playing all day, what do they seek?’  
That person was killed by evil ghosts in this life, prematurely ending his mandate.  
He died in hell, enduring all sufferings, reborn foolish and ignorant, not among humans.  

Also daoists who lightly treat dharma, falsely declare and leak precious scriptures, are killed by examining ghosts, sunk in hell, born with ailments, suffering indescribable.  
Therefore scriptures must not be unguarded, fearing misuse and mutual offense.  
Also for teachers, it is not easy; if they teach disciples poorly, sins extend mutually.  
Human hearts are hard to fathom, all are stingy and greedy.  
Thus sages left dharma to be trusted by efficacy, passed from saint to saint, not by words alone.  
Fools pass it among fools, so trust is incomplete.  
Are you not to be cautious?”

“To learn the dao, first be loyal and filial, act well and observe precepts, have compassion for all, serve masters respectfully, breathe and nurture spirit, reverently receive great scriptures, worship and honor masters as if venerating saints, fast quietly reciting scriptures, bestow kindness on the poor and distressed, encourage others to good.  
Then take medicine to benefit, breathe and harmonize spirit, fasting and precepts respond, scripture recitation truly descends, demons and hosts submit, dare not harm.  
Thus one surely attains the dao.  

The scriptures of dao and virtue, upper and lower, and the Profound True and Profound Origin scriptures, the Three Sovereigns’ celestial writings, the Upper Clarity’s many chants, all are the Most High Void Sovereign’s myriad true ones, the Ten Directions’ natural true immortals, and hidden seats of imperial lords, as well as great saints of the heavens, their palaces and city towers, mountains, seas, lakes, and pools.  
Some are the Most High’s numinous temples, natural treasure palaces, and the sun, moon, and stars of the heavens, city walls and gates’ inscriptions.  
Some are secret names of great demon king officials, palace chambers and locations.  
The Most High thus composed these writings.  
Therefore, they must not be slandered or falsely proclaimed.  
If one fasts quietly, worships, focuses on the profound, meditates on the true dao, and recites a few verses, the words are splendid and resonate in response.”

At that time, the Most High Jade Capital Profound Metropolis, the eight directions’ heavens, the three thousand great thousand worlds, and all holy true persons also came.  
The holy ones of the Jade Capital Mountain’s east are the Infinite Heavens’ Peaceful Great Halls, the great thousand worlds of Universal Goodness;  
To the southeast, the Infinite Heavens’ Original Blessing Fields, the great thousand worlds of Worthy Use;  
To the south, the Infinite Heavens’ Wanli City Realm, the great vehicle’s abandoned worthies;  
To the southwest, the Infinite Heavens’ Extended Blessing Village, the great thousand worlds of Benevolent Tranquility;  
To the west, the Infinite Heavens’ Blessed Hall Prefecture, the great thousand worlds of Quiet Conduct;  
To the northwest, the Infinite Heavens’ Blessed Virtue Wilds, the great thousand worlds of Extended Worthies;  
To the north, the Infinite Heavens’ Yudan Wilds, the great thousand worlds of Pure Tranquility;  
To the northeast, the Infinite Heavens’ Blessed Gathering Capital, the great thousand worlds of Chang’an.  

Thus the Most High Jade Capital Mountain’s Void and Profound Metropolis, the Infinite Eight Directions’ Heavens and Earthly Worlds, the great saints and true persons’ titles and ranks are all contained therein.

The scripture’s words resemble worldly writings, but these are not common worldly phrases.  
All expound the profound true, tranquil and natural, revealing the Most High Majestic Heavenly Venerable’s principle, subtle and rare, cleansing stagnation and purifying spirit, abiding through years and kalpas, thus forming ascension and eternal existence without limit, the seven ancestors born in Heaven.  
This scripture is wondrous, hence called profound beyond profound.  
Pay heed, for the dao’s deep abyss, the dao’s body is emptiness, spread by human beings.

The Three Treasures are the Dao Treasure Most High, Scripture Treasure, and Master Treasure—these are the Three Treasures.  
The Three Honored Ones are the Dao Honored Most High, Scripture Honored, Master Honored—these are the Three Honored Ones.  
Within the human body are called the Three Honored Ones, with three palaces inside.  
The Supreme One Emperor Lord, the Prince, and the Nameless are the Three-in-One Honored.  
The scriptures speak of the seven ancestors and parents, born above in Heaven, resolving knots and dispersing stagnation, or returning to fetal form among kings and nobles on earth, my body ascending immortal, always preserving the root of blessing—this is the retribution of seven generations of parents’ causes and conditions.  
My body severs attachment, cuts off the original embryo, revering vows thus.  
The seven generations of parents, born above in Heaven, born below among kings and nobles, this is the great way of filial piety, the essence of the Profound Scripture.  
The perfected person’s refining of form surpasses the moon’s ten-month governance, yet also requires but a moment of hidden stillness in the embryo.  
Even in the womb, it is not yet base.  
People in the womb all recall past fate matters, but upon birth immediately forget.  
Only those attaining the dao and true cavern naturally know.  
Thus the words to the world’s people are to urge them to cultivate good conduct, making a bridge for future lives.”

“To speak of immortals is to migrate, from the mundane to the sacred gradually.  
The true is firmness, without decay or ruin.  
From immortals one cultivates to become true persons.  
Therefore immortals have ranks, true persons have grades.  
The Six Heavens are the Three Realms; the Great Demon King leads the Six Heavens’ ghosts and spirits, serving the Most High myriad true heavenly venerables and exalted ones.  
When a daoist’s功 is complete, the demon king immediately recommends him.  
When completion nears, the demon tests him, distinguishing right from wrong.  
The daoist’s demon king superior’s respect is the Most High scripture, thus the demon king’s position governs ghosts and spirits, all due to past lives’ accumulated blessings.  
The myriad saints are likewise so.”

“To learn the dao one should know the former masters.  
My master is the Most High Jade Morning Great Dao Void Sovereign, the supreme of the dao.  
I am the sixth disciple; all great saints are disciples of the master.  
Disciples are countless.  
My master’s name is Boyue Zong, styled Weinahe.  
Now I tell you, keep it secret.  
The true persons’ names are also hard to fathom, mostly hidden words.  
My name is Xu Laile, styled Hongyuanfu.  
To learn the dao without a master, fasting and reciting have no response.  
If one falsely proclaims and disbelieves, one offends the Three Officials.  
The hells, Three Realms, Six Heavens, Northern Emperor, Great Demon King’s jurisdiction lie in the Great Northern Sea, north of Heaven and Earth, Luo Wild Mountain, two thousand six hundred li high, thirty thousand li around, inside and outside all seven-treasure palaces, a flourishing capital, the place where all ghosts and spirits gather.  
Now I show these heavenly palace names; those who can chant them, evil ghosts dare not approach, demons and spirits submit and vanish, disasters and harms do not invade, soul and spirit clear and correct, spirit bridge always preserved.  

My master said: ‘I learn dao, cultivate fasting and scripture recitation, establish功 and aid beings, serve master respectfully and diligently, enduring kalpas and years.  
Sometimes born in royal families, sometimes in noble gates, sometimes lowly, sometimes among heavens, sometimes demon kings, sometimes falling to hell, enduring the Three Officials’ record, the ten sufferings and eight hardships, holding firm without loss, turning the wheel seeking dao, often laughed at by the world, not speaking to them.  
Silently encouraging myself, holding to principles daily, work ever renewed, all according to scriptures.  
At first not daring to doubt, truly encountering holy texts, thus attaining upper immortality, body like adamant, true body entering wonder, subtle and profound, forever enjoying immeasurable life.  
This is due to my dedication, gentle compassion and love, receiving scriptures tirelessly, not by natural attainment.’”

“To perform dao divination at home, one should build a refined quiet fast, and a place for giving talks, with scriptures to read and recite.  
The meditation bed should be five chi square, and equally high.  
Always burn incense, lamps never cease.  
Non-students are not allowed in.  
Dharma clothing must not be lent to others.  
Scriptures must be received from masters, texts verified, affairs solemnly arranged, always like facing the Most High.  
Do not be arrogant or laugh, nor discuss worldly fame and profit.  
Those who violate this, the scripture-attending divine youths immediately report to the Three Heavens’ supervisors.  
The Three Heavens’ supervisors report to the Most High.  
After three reports to the Most High, you will surely lose the scriptures.  
Ghosts and spirits will disorder the examination; fearing no longevity or peaceful death, what immortality can there be?  
If scriptures are not received from masters, no divine protection, cultivation fails.  
The scripture-attending divine youths constantly examine people, harming seven generations of parents.  
Receiving the dao without respect to masters, the Three Officials record it, ghosts will harm violently.  
If one receives scriptures with impurity and arrogance, not pure and quiet, one will be slandered, after death enter hell, and eventually be born among the six beasts.  
If scriptures are not washed with incense water, soul and spirit scatter and fall, captured by other ghosts.  
If one receives scriptures but should not publicize them, yet rashly proclaims, the seven ancestors are imprisoned in hell, the body endures three evil examinations.  
Even if transmission is proper, if not the right person, the sin is the same.  

Daoists wishing to dwell in mountains and seclusion should first receive scriptures, serve masters reverently, cultivate good功, to pacify mountain spirits.  
Mountains, large or small, all have spirits.  
Large mountains have great spirits, small mountains smaller spirits.  
Mountain spirits harming people are not established.  
If one does not understand supreme dharma, nor know to cultivate good and establish功, how can one long dwell in mountains?  
Water also has spirits; the Eight Seas have spirit kings residing.  
Rivers, lakes, and waterways all have spirits.  
Also dragon kings and ghosts govern their clear pools.  
River Lords and Water Officials each have palaces and temples, all seven-treasure bronze towers, like those in Dengdu’s realm, all under immortals’ palaces.  
Also by one’s life and learning, work depth, merit size, one receives retribution now.  
In future lives, one will be reborn among humans, retribution following conduct, no mistake.  
Heaven, Earth, Water, and the Three Officials record all功 and faults, good and evil, nothing missing.”

“Once a noble person, good at trusting dao teachings, offered to the Three Treasures, wrote and copied scriptures, built quiet dwellings.  
When completion neared, the noble was gravely ill; disciples personally welcomed him; medicine was to be harshly applied.  
The noble said: ‘I have long respected and obeyed precepts, dare not forget them, also gave alms to the poor, offered to the Three Treasures, built quiet dwellings.  
Does the Most High not know this?  
Life has death, death is not to be feared.  
What I regret is not personally holding fast to fasting, precepts, and scripture reading, lighting lamps and practicing the dao, repenting seven generations’ faults.  
This is to make a bridge for my next life.  
I am ill and near death’s end.  
Medicine can cure madness, but what of my fate?’”

At that time, the Most High remotely observed the ten directions’ good and evil people, and commanded the Life Officer to extend this person’s life by thirty years.  
Suddenly he was healed, body restored as if never ill.  
He then diligently cultivated, daily renewed, observed fasts and precepts, practiced all good, offered to the Three Treasures, attained generation after generation of wealth and honor, good people born in his family, turning the wheel to attain dao.  
This person is now the Most High East Flower Immortal King.  
Teaching people to accumulate goodness, is it not so? Is it not so?”
