In the year of [redacted], in the gengshen year, on the first day of the first month, at the hour of renzi, [redacted], in quiet fasting, reciting the Dao.

At midday on that day, thirty-three earthbound immortals and Daoist adepts came to sit, burning incense, reverently saluting the scripture, then circumambulating. When all was complete, each returned to their original place and settled in stillness. The Immortal then withdrew from his seat and humbly inquired:

“Your humble servants have studied the dao for many ages, accumulating nine hundred years until now. Yet as earth immortals, we have no official post or office, scattered among the mountains and forests. When the Heavenly Venerable first raised the dao, and formerly bestowed upon me the title of Left Immortal Duke of the Supreme Ultimate, I should have ascended to the Supreme Jade Capital, entered the Golden Palace, and paid homage to the Most High Void Sovereign. Yet I do not understand what merits and virtues from past lives we have, nor which scriptures we have followed, that have brought us to this lofty Three Realms, the northern Feng to which we look up. I earnestly wish you would explain the origins of our past destinies, the fundamental causes and conditions.”

The Immortal Duke promptly replied: “What you ask is distant yet essential. Sit again; I shall tell you all. When the Two Instruments (yin and yang) separated, there arose the refined and the coarse, sin and blessing, longevity and Heaven, wealth and poverty, honor and disgrace, the rise and fall of myriad affairs and omens. Among people, there are the three materials of the human body, the wise and the foolish, the talented and the dull. All this depends on the original conduct of the person, their aspirations and established virtue.

“You fellows in your past lives studied the dao and received scriptures, but your early achievements were slight, your aspirations narrow. You sought only to save yourselves, not others; you studied without teaching; sought the dao without caring if others attained it. You did not believe in the grand and far-reaching words of the great scriptures; you neglected fasting and precepts; you did not follow the Three Caverns’ masters; you preferred the lesser teachings of the Small Vehicle. Thus you attained the earth immortal’s method of corpse liberation. Yet even so, your coming and going is at will; you live and die freely; you enjoy long life without death—but you have not transcended the Three Realms, nor roamed the Ten Directions; you only gaze upward at the Supreme Jade Capital and Golden Palace.

“If you desire swift ascent, to fly and roam the heavens of Upper Clarity, you must establish greater merit: rescue kings, nations, and people from disasters, calamities, and suffering. When your great virtue is full, the Most High will surely bestow upon you the invitation. Hence Pengzu lived eight hundred years, Anqi Sheng a thousand, Baishi Sheng three thousand—wandering among the common folk—all because their past lives’ study of the dao yielded only small merit. Some remain in mountain caves for more than ten thousand years and still have not ascended Heaven. You, with only a few hundred years, how can that be long?

“Immortals who keep to the mountains and forests cultivate hidden virtue and ascend; those who liberate their corpses and entrust their forms to reduction often manifest in the world, praised by the people, but few are recorded in books or scriptures.”

At that moment, an Immortal surnamed Ji, styled Facheng, appeared. The Immortal Duke pointed to him and said: “He was my disciple in a past life, yet he has not seen the root of his past destiny. I can make you understand the affairs of your former lives.” Facheng replied: “Yes, yes, Heavenly Venerable.” Suddenly enlightened, he clasped hands in salute: “Your disciple is blocked, not recognizing his fundamental conduct, and begs for your compassion.”

The Immortal Duke said: “In the time of Emperor Yao, you followed me into Mount Song to study the dao. Your ambition was small and your hope for speed great. You often mocked my words as empty and absurd, my goals distant and my path difficult. You sighed over Xu You and Chao Fu, who abandoned Ji Mountain, declined Yao’s abdication, and regretted their extravagance—yet you were unsettled by their example. I often urged you to study the dao of Upper Clarity, but you did not follow. Though you drank the sea, your belly was never full; you knocked on stone but found no jade. Xu and Chao ascended early to the Supreme Ultimate Palace; now I am appointed Left Immortal Duke, while you remain an earth immortal, merely undying. How many steps separate your virtue from mine? Are you not saddened? Now you understand my words have foundation, and you believe without doubt.”

Facheng, ashamed, recalled this not long ago and his heart was clear. “I did not follow the teaching then; how deep is my regret! I wish to be elevated, to serve the cloud chariot and hold the reins, to face the heavenly countenance in person. This is the meeting of my past destiny.”

The Immortal Duke said: “You are outstanding and raised high; you are fit to ascend Heaven. But how can you follow me to the Supreme Ultimate Palace and pay court at the Supreme Jade Capital and Golden Palace? I have no regrets.”

The Immortal then asked the Immortal Duke: “Is our past conduct complete? If not, please explain what remains unfinished.”

The Immortal Duke said: “My ancestors experienced and enacted sin and blessing, revolving and transforming forms. To speak of it fully would be endless. If you wish to know, I can briefly relate a corner of it.

“In former lives, I was born noble yet oppressed the poor and lowly, wielding strength to suppress the weak. I died and entered Hell. Later I was reborn a petty person, poor, sickly, and lonely. Then I reflected: ‘What conduct from my past life brought me this suffering? What virtue from their past life brings others wealth and honor?’ I resolved to do good, yet my heart was not free; anguish was hard to express.

“After death, I ascended to the Hall of Blessing. Later I was born into a wealthy family, with treasures enough and to spare, yet cruel to slaves and servants. I died and entered Hell to be tested. After the Three Officials’ judgment, I was reborn a lowly servant, watching people’s breath, serving and toiling, whipped and tormented without respite. Then I reflected: ‘What crime of my past life made me a lowly servant?’ I gave my private wealth to the poor, revered Daoists, burned incense, offered oil, only wishing to be born into a noble family and after death ascend to the Hall of Blessing, with food and clothing provided naturally.

“Later born noble, I again harmed living beings, killing fish and birds. I died and entered Hell, enduring the mountains of knives and trees of swords, boiling and fire swallowing, suffering the five torments. After my sins ended, I was reborn a pig or sheep to repay old grudges. Later I took the form of a lowly person, foul and detestable, cheating others of their wealth without return, dying to Hell. Later I was born a cow, repaying others with strength and offering my flesh as food. Then I took middle rank, treasures near at hand. At that time, I resolved to do merit, often supporting Daoists, receiving scriptures and precepts, humble and courteous, giving alms to the needy, following the dao in all things, hearing good and desiring to follow it. At eighty years old, I died and directly ascended to the Hall of Blessing, with heavenly food and clothing.

“Later born noble, I favored martial valor and killing, yet still respected and obeyed Daoists, believed in the highest dharma. I died and entered Hell, to be tested and tormented. Then the Most High taught: ‘Though this person committed killing and violence, since they entered Hell but believed in the dharma and respected the dao while alive, giving alms to the needy, we may now forgive their punishment and allow them to ascend the Hall of Blessing, providing heavenly food.’

“Later born noble, facing enemies, I resolved to seek the dao, respectfully receiving scriptures and teachings, practicing hidden virtue, rescuing the suffering, governing by dao, showing compassion to all beings, supporting Daoists, serving my lord with loyalty, my ministers with propriety, always thinking to renounce honor and wealth. Thus I escaped enemies, died peacefully, and ascended to the Heavenly Hall.

“Later born noble again, deeply faithful and respectful, but lacking talent, I resolved to burn incense, wishing that my descendants would be wise, clear, and understand profound meanings, to become Daoists and after death ascend the Hall of Blessing.

“Later born in the central lands, I became a master and Daoist, wearing robes and holding precepts, practicing the dao. At that time, I was intelligent in scripture recitation, respected by many masters. Then I resolved: ‘If I cannot attain the dao in this life, better to be a woman, quiet and without affairs, enjoying leisure.’ At death, I was born a woman, graceful and bright, with profound talent and eloquence. I prepared fasting and scripture reading, then resolved to be born a man, broad in talent, open to mystery and void, understanding subtle secrets, wishing to serve the king and associate with Daoists. In my thoughts and wishes, I roamed mountains and waters, with ample pleasure and music, often hearing scripture lectures. At death, I ascended to Heaven, with food and clothing provided naturally.

“Soon born in a royal family, I became a crown prince, indulging in the palace, inheriting the kingly estate. I invited Daoists, virtuous scholars, to perform rites and lectures, cultivating solemn stillness, freely pursuing my wishes. The kingdom was peaceful, the people prosperous, and all was orderly. At that time, the three attendant ministers all resolved: ‘When reborn, I will be a Daoist; I will be a recluse.’ The Daoist Wei, Zhu Fa, Zheng Siyuan, and Zhang Tai all wished to be Daoists, aspiring to ascend immortality and save the world, abandoning royal duties, dying and directly ascending Heaven, with heavenly food and clothing. I was reborn a recluse; Wei, Zhu, and Zheng also became Daoists, entering the mountains to study the dao and seek immortality. I became their master, aspiring to the great vehicle path, always fasting, reading scriptures, bearing treasures to great masters, receiving the Three Caverns’ great scriptures, offering support and vows, fasting and practicing the dao, taking medicine and breathing exercises. Because my causes were not yet complete, after death I was born under the Moon, then again to a virtuous family, becoming a Daoist master, studying with peers, becoming master and disciple again, receiving the great scriptures, fasting and practicing the dao.

“Therefore, the highest sages have looked upon me with hope, and the True One descended to teach me. At that time, Wei, Zhang, and Zheng all attended the assembly, following me today. This is the fundamental vow of our past lives’ cause and condition. All the immortals understood and were at ease; the assembly sighed and said: ‘Heavenly Venerable Most High, you have sought the dao for long, enduring kalpas and many years, thus you have attained the position of Immortal Duke. Surely there is reason for this. We now fully see that our past conduct was slight, our reception of scriptures little; how can we blame ourselves for seeking high immortality? Hereafter, we must receive the great caverns’ scriptures, diligently practice compassion, and save those in distress, hoping thereby to ascend Heaven.’

The Immortal Duke said: “If you do not follow the supreme caverns’ scriptures, the myriad wonders will not be achieved. Each must diligently strive, create great merit, and rescue all suffering. With such resolve, why fear not swift ascent to Heaven? But if you desire to enter the Supreme Golden Palace, still no day has come.”

The Immortal Duke said: “I have trod everywhere, beyond what pen and brush can record; the toil is hard to tell. Only now do I receive reward.”

The Immortal asked: “In the past, when we entered Dongting and saw the Heavenly King’s separate palace, at first ascending Maoshan, we saw a group of immortals seeking to follow you to watch a play. What kind of immortals were they, and why were there so many?”

The answer came: “Those immortals are all from famous mountains and grottoes, but their numbers are few. Have you not seen Kunlun, Penglai, Zhongshan, Songgao, Huayue, Lingniao, and other great mountains and grottoes? There are countless immortals.”

The Immortal said: “I do not know where Dongting connects.”

The answer: “It connects to all the great mountains above, the vast seas, northern Feng, Mount Tai, and the Five Great Mountains; there is no place it does not reach.”

Five immortals said they were returning to Jvqu Mountain. “Is that the homeland of the Immortal Duke?”

The answer: “Jvqu Mountain is what I see with my eyes; it is also a fine mountain of Jiangzuo. It is the western side gate of the Nine Springs Dongting, with a cave platform about thirty li square, palaces shining like the sun, numbering thirty-six small heavens. It does not receive filthy qi; Daoists who walk the path rightly may dwell there. There are always people. Long ago, Master Mao attained the dao and now dwells in that mountain cave palace on the mountain’s summit, named the Empty Cave, where the Mysterious Palace Temple was established, the abode of immortals.”

The Immortal asked: “Recently, ascending Kunlun’s Mysterious Orchard Palace, I served at the seat and saw the Zhengyi True Man, the Three Heavens Master Zhang Daoling, descending to his seat, the Fengdu officials receiving him, the Three Realms bowing, the heavens paying homage. His dragon chariot shone in the void, his neck bore a perfect brightness, his body emitted heavenly light, his words were brilliant. What merits and virtues from past lives caused him alone to attain the dao thus? I wish to hear of it.”

The answer: “The Heavenly Master’s past conduct was also through many kalpas of toil, fasting, reading scriptures, spreading the dao with great generosity, exemplifying the profound and true, savoring the subtle, turning the wheel to seek the dao, surpassing even me. It cannot be fully told. His aspiration was the great scriptures, his practice the great dao; thus he received the title of Three Heavens Master and the name Zhengyi True Man of the Most High. Is that not great?”

At that time, Donghua Qingtong and many immortals all gathered in the Songgao grotto, quietly fasting and chanting scriptures. Those beginning to study, hearing the Immortal Duke speak of the fundamental causes, none did not long for the great dao to strengthen themselves.

Qingtong said: “The Immortal Duke’s wondrous words, distant yet essential, are trustworthy and worthy of respect.” The assembly of immortals saluted and said: “We submit to these words.”

Qingtong said: “In the past, I and you received reward and care, never forgetting. You have received the Most High’s bestowal; I should first cultivate respect and affection, not immediately reveal the duke’s secrets, often turning over in thought, wishing not to be alone in this heart.”

The Immortal Duke said: “Your past offenses are all forgiven; I am deeply ashamed and more patient. How can my feelings cease? I do not disdain my shortcomings before the highest sage, nor the clear edicts and commands. Ashamed beyond bearing, we share the dao and virtue, roaming the Three Realms, always thinking of freedom, wandering the mysterious void. This is the respect of the duke’s household. Why speak further? Soon I shall ascend to my post; though the day is far, the distance near, there is still attachment and regret. What to do?”

Qingtong replied: “Your care and wishes are deeply comforting.”

The Immortal Duke said: “The Heavenly Master says on the fifteenth day of each month, one should fast in quiet chambers, reading the received Dao scriptures and the deeds of immortals, all for the later sages and people born in this age. Is that not joyful? On the dingmao day, I paid respects to Donghua Qingtong in the quiet center, bowing thrice northward, seeking the affairs of wished-for gods and immortals. Also on one’s birth day, reading scriptures without mingling in worldly affairs—all are essential words for seeking immortality. The Daoist tradition has many such practices, fitting to those who serve. The great secret lies in the emotional elixir; practice must accord with the profound teaching. If one has a wish yet cannot fulfill it, so be it.”
