# Preface by Xu

The *Transmission of the Eight Immortals’ Attainment of the Dao* was composed by the Daoist Master Wugou of Mount Emei. Wugou hailed from a certain county by the riverside in Sichuan; his ancestors once served in official posts under the Manchu Qing dynasty. By the time Wugou was born, his family was impoverished. His father Qi passed away, and his mother remarried twice before departing; thus, Wugou drifted into the city of Chengdu. By what fate or karmic link, he came to know the venerable Daoist Master Zhiyuan of Qingyun Temple. Zhiyuan was a man of the Dao, versed also in physiognomy; he discerned that Wugou’s nature and conduct were of a rare and singular kind, a man suited to conceal himself beyond the world, not to contend amidst the clamorous dust of the mundane. Therefore, he took Wugou under his wing, personally imparting to him the essence of the Daoist scriptures.

Wugou’s nature was originally keen and bright, and under Zhiyuan’s strict guidance and teaching, he applied himself with utmost diligence and heart. Thus, by middle age, Wugou had fully absorbed Zhiyuan’s learning. Moreover, he deeply mastered the profound arts, able to know matters of future and past. Often, for many months he would abstain from smoke and food, yet his complexion remained full and vibrant as ever. When dwelling among the marketplace throng, his eating, resting, and daily habits showed no difference from ordinary people. In speech, he rarely touched upon Daoist principles or reasonings. This was because he wished not to dazzle the world with strange conduct, thus he veiled himself in such quiet obscurity. Yet over time, those who knew Wugou gradually increased. Wherever he went, there were those who sought his guidance on the Dao, and some who wished to follow him beyond the world. Wugou found this troublesome; hence, wherever he traveled, he never revealed his true name.

The time was at the transition between the Xianfeng and Tongzhi reigns of the Qing dynasty. Wugou foresaw the coming chaos and could not bear to witness the slaughter and calamity in the southern rivers. So he journeyed northward to the imperial capital, lodging in various Daoist temples for a total of ten years. At that time, the magistrate Lu Jingfu was serving as an inspector, traveling through the capital’s political scene, and he and Wugou became close friends. By chance, the magistrate was implicated in a legal case, nearly bringing death upon himself. Fortunately, a high official who admired Wugou intervened; Wugou explained the matter in a single word, clearing the injustice as if snow melting in spring. The official then recommended the magistrate as a man of integrity to his followers. Later, this man was appointed to posts in outlying counties, all due to the influence of that official—and in truth, it was Wugou’s one word that set this in motion. From then on, the magistrate’s friendship with Wugou deepened. Wugou remarked that among the vast sea of humanity, men like the magistrate—pure, upright, indifferent to worldly dust despite holding office—were indeed rare to encounter. From that time forward, the magistrate began to glimpse Wugou’s true nature and recognized him as a man beyond the world, revering him with the respect due a master. The health-preserving secrets Wugou taught were mostly unknown to the world. The magistrate followed his instructions and was free from illness throughout his life, living to the age of ninety-eight.

Wugou stayed long in the capital. One day, he suddenly told the magistrate that he was summoned to journey overseas. At parting, he entrusted to him the scriptures he had composed and the manuscript of the *Transmission of the Eight Immortals’ Attainment of the Dao*, saying, “If you find the right person, then entrust it to their careful carving and engraving.” The magistrate took the writings back to Zhejiang, always lamenting that he had not found the proper successor. Later, with the upheaval of the Taiping Rebellion, the magistrate fled far from home. On the way, he was robbed and lost all his possessions. The thieves seized Wugou’s manuscripts and wantonly destroyed them. Only the *Transmission of the Eight Immortals* survived with less damage, though its pages were scattered and confused, tangled as a skein of broken threads. When the turmoil settled, the magistrate gave the scriptures to the Daoist Master Di’an in Chongqing. Though called a Daoist, Di’an was not truly of the Daoist tradition; he had turned his heart away from Daoist learning and often wore the yellow cap of a Daoist priest while dressing as a wandering ascetic. His acquaintances were mostly those beyond the orthodox paths. Throughout his life, he was devoted to Daoism, reading all its texts—from the *Dao De Jing* and *Zhuangzi* to the writings of recent masters—without exception. The magistrate admired his noble character and again presented to him the profound secrets Wugou had shared, to test and compare. Di’an found much agreement and exclaimed with feeling, “The one Wugou spoke of as the transmitter of his teachings can be none other than this man!” Thus, he returned all the scriptures to the magistrate but kept the *Transmission of the Eight Immortals* for himself, considering it a work of lighter style and simpler meaning, intending to personally edit and publish it. Yet, due to circumstances, he never completed this task.

After the magistrate’s passing, his descendants took up commerce and set up shops in Lanxi. Though aware of the existence of the *Transmission of the Eight Immortals*, none could bear the responsibility of its proper arrangement. This supreme, unparalleled Daoist masterpiece was nearly consumed by bookworms. By chance, I journeyed to Lanxi and lodged at the magistrate’s young heir’s shop. From dawn till dusk we talked, and the matter came up. I eagerly requested to see the manuscript and found its style ancient and elegant, its diction profound yet clear, truly free from worldly dust and flowing like clouds and water. Though the works of famous novelists of old and new might imitate its style, none could capture the charm beyond the words. As for the other scriptures, I had never seen them, and even if I had, I would not understand them. My humble judgment of this book, based on its preface alone, was that it was so wondrous—immortal indeed! Immortal indeed!—that it must be counted among the rare and transcendent masterpieces of all ages. After much study and reading, I could not bear to part with it. Without presuming to surpass Wugou’s own chosen successor, I followed the example of Master Mao in volunteering to take on the task of arranging it. I supplemented what was lacking, enhanced what was diminished, and reordered and corrected what was confused and mixed. When finished, I sent it to the press and entrusted my old friend Zhen Ya with the responsibility of proofreading, as a mark of carefulness and to avoid errors that might dishonor Wugou’s painstaking efforts. Yet the scriptures were scattered and disordered; editing and proofreading could not be completed in a short time. Both Zhen Ya and I were burdened by the necessities of life and had no leisure to devote ourselves fully to the task, so some oversights are inevitable. I hope that readers, in their study, will share their knowledge and insights. If not for the good fortune of myself and Zhen Ya, the numinous spirit of Wugou will surely bless all who engage with this work.
