# Chapter One: Borrowing the Dragon Elixir Immortal to Aid the Filial Son — The Greedy Official Demands the Spirit Pearl

The venerable master, when listening, often said: “The immortals were originally mortals; only it is feared that mortal hearts lack steadfastness.” Thus it is clear that the paths of immortals and mortals share a common origin. Since mortals exist, how can it be said that none among them have cultivated themselves into immortals? The venerable master was skeptical and bade the author to present some evidence for all to study and consider. Immortals have always been many, but among them, the ones most widely known and revered by the world are none other than the Eight Cavern Immortals. Nowadays, people commonly call them simply the Eight Immortals.

The author, devoted to the dao from youth, has read many rare celestial secrets seldom seen in the world, including nameless tales from the sea’s edge. Within his belly he truly treasures many immortal stories. Yet human affairs are so unfamiliar that when spoken aloud, they may fail to move or inspire belief. Therefore, he will select and recount the origins and attainments of the Eight Cavern Immortals, along with various true events and manifest signs. Such deeds may be well known to women and children or supported by ancient traces.

Clearly, the author is not fabricating tales to deceive!

Now, to speak of the cultivation and attainment of the Eight Cavern Immortals—when it began, how many ages it spanned, and what circumstances it involved—is like narrating a volume of the Twenty-Four Histories, uncertain where to start. The author labored greatly to find a small clue. Have you venerable masters ever heard the ancient and modern legend of the Two Dragons Governing the Waters? This story seems plain and unremarkable, yet upon careful investigation, it is found to bear a slight relation to the history of the Eight Immortals. Following the principle of tracing events from their roots, to speak of the Eight Immortals, one cannot but rely on these two Dragon Lords as an opening prelude.

It turns out these two dragons dwell—one in the western heavens, the other in the southern sea. In the primordial age, the western region of the Jambudvīpa continent was a vast marshland. This place was called Guankou, the domain bestowed upon Erlang Shen, the Jade Emperor’s nephew, hence known as Guankou Erlang. In present-day Sichuan, there remains a county named Guanxian, derived from this source. At that time, Erlang Shen guarded Guankou and often manifested wondrous signs. The nearby water and land inhabitants all revered and worshipped him devoutly; incense burned ceaselessly in his shrines, flourishing beyond measure. Yet within that watery realm there dwelt an ancient dragon who, fearing Erlang Shen’s might, dared not show himself and spent his years submerged in the sea, cultivating for thousands of years until he attained an imperishable body. Erlang Shen’s divine power was vast; with but a glance of his wise eyes and the silent turning of his divine mechanism, no matter what happened beneath or upon the sea, nothing escaped his notice. Thus, the dragon, having labored long, dared not emerge to harm others and feigned indifference, choosing not to provoke Erlang Shen.

One day, as fate would have it, on the shore lived a filial son named Ping He. From childhood he had lost his father, leaving only his widowed mother, Lady Wang, who kept her chastity and raised him into a robust young man. Yet Lady Wang, from overwork, had lost her sight. Ping He tried every means—praying to gods and buddhas—to cure his mother’s eyes, but all to no avail. He grew angry and exclaimed, “My mother is such a good woman; why must she suffer this cruel fate? Clearly, the way of Heaven is unreliable! The gods and buddhas have no efficacy!” Thus, this once dutiful son was stirred into a fiery and restless temper. But Lady Wang’s illness was hard to cure; no matter how anxious her son became, it availed nothing. After long frustration and no solution, he resolved to work diligently, earning money to support his dear mother. Though blind, Lady Wang was comforted by her son’s filial devotion. Often hearing his complaints against Heaven’s injustice, she earnestly admonished him. Ping He thus learned to restrain himself somewhat. Every day, besides working to support his mother, he dared not stray or speak beyond measure. This pleased Lady Wang greatly, who said to him, “My son, though I have lost my sight, having you is enough. I need not go out to earn; even without eyes, what harm can befall me?” Ping He replied, “Mother, do not say so. Filial sons owe their parents their duty. You have been loyal and virtuous all your life; to suffer such affliction is undeserved! If I could traverse Heaven and Earth, no matter what, I must find the cause and obtain some immortal medicine to cure your eyes before I rest!” Lady Wang took this as mere childish talk and smiled it away. Yet Ping He, while working hard, still sought far and wide for any cure for blindness.

One morning, having run out of firewood, he entered the mountain early, cut some dry branches, and slowly descended with them on his shoulder. Halfway down, he suddenly saw a Daoist, whose appearance was extraordinary, demeanor ethereal, moving with a radiant auspicious aura enveloping his body. Ping He sensed the man’s significance, hastily dropped his firewood, bowed deeply, and asked, “Immortal sir, whence do you come?” The Daoist smiled and said, “I am no immortal, only a wandering doctor who treats ailments.” Hearing this, Ping He’s heart stirred, and he asked eagerly, “May I ask if the immortal master can cure blindness of many years?” The Daoist replied, “I cure all diseases except blindness!” Ping He spat in disdain, picked up his firewood, and prepared to leave.

The Daoist laughed, “Child, why such haste?” Ping He said, “My mother is my only parent. Her body is well except for her eyes. You say you cure all diseases but not blindness—it seems you mean to oppose me! Why should I speak further with you?” The Daoist laughed again, “Though I do not cure blindness, I know of a master who specializes in it. If I do not recommend him to you, where else will you find him?”

Hearing of such a doctor, Ping He again dropped his firewood and bowed, saying, “I have been away long, fearing my mother’s longing, hence my haste. Forgive my rude words just now! As a Daoist, compassion is your root. Since you know this doctor, I earnestly beg you to tell me where to find him. If he can cure my mother, it will be your merit and I will be forever grateful!” The Daoist nodded with a smile, “You are a poor man who toils day and night to support your mother; how can you be wealthy enough to repay me? Yet it is true that compassion is the root of the Dao. Very well! Our meeting here is no mere chance; I respect your filial piety and will show you the way. Thirty-five li from this mountain, in the great waters, dwells a wicked dragon who has cultivated for many years. Every day at the hours of the rat and horse, he surely raises his head above the water to absorb the essence of sun and moon, spitting forth a red pearl that shines upon the water’s surface, sparkling and crystal-clear—this is the elixir he has refined. You must go there and lie in wait by the water’s edge. When he spits the pearl, silently recite the incantation ‘An li hong li hong’ and beckon with your hand; the pearl will surely fly into your palm. Quickly hide it and hang it before your home. Whatever you desire, simply silently pray to the pearl, and it will respond. As for your mother’s eye disease, merely touch the pearl’s radiance, and her sight will be restored forever, never to fail again.” Knowing this Daoist must be an immortal, Ping He bowed deeply. The Daoist smiled, helped him up, and said, “No need for ceremony; remember the spell, and you will surely succeed! When the old dragon sees the pearl taken, he will come to reclaim it. At that time, I will secretly aid you so no mishap occurs. Be bold and go forth!”

With that, a gust of wind rose, and the Daoist transformed into a burst of golden light, vanishing in an instant. Ping He was greatly amazed and bowed in thanks to the empty sky. Shouldering his firewood, he returned home, fearing his mother’s timidity, and told her nothing. At the third watch of the night, alone, he slipped out the back door and hurried to the place the Daoist had indicated. Finding a clump of reeds, he curled up and held his breath, staring silently at the water until the hour of the rat. Suddenly a red light burst from beneath the water, startling fish and shrimp to scatter. The red light rose above the surface, more than ten feet high, rising and falling in rhythm with the moonlight. Around the red light was a mist white as silver, faint as smoke. Ping He had no time to look for the dragon’s body beneath the water; seeing the red pearl, he nearly leapt with joy. Hastily calming himself, he silently recited, “An li hong li hong,” and beckoned with his hand. In an instant, the red light flew toward him, so bright he could scarcely open his eyes. Regardless of life or death, he stretched out both hands to grasp the light, trying to seize the pearl. The red light grew dimmer and thinner, but in his hands he seemed to hold something. Looking closely, it was not the crystal-clear, radiant red pearl. This joy was extraordinary. As he prepared to rise, a sudden fierce wind swept through the reeds.

In a moment, sky darkened and earth dimmed; the moonlight vanished. Thunder roared overhead like a tempest, circling down upon Ping He’s crown, who, clutching the pearl, fell to the ground crying, “Immortal master, save me! Immortal master, save me!” Suddenly a voice thundered from the air: “Wicked dragon, cease your insolence! Hear my decree: I am the Celestial Perfected of the Nine Heavens. You have cultivated many years without true fruit, yet considering Ping He’s filial heart that moves Heaven, I borrow your elixir to save his mother and establish merit to aid all beings. Having lost the elixir, your body is lost, but your soul may remain here. Do not stray. In three years you will face calamity; then your soul shall merge with Ping He’s body, and together you shall achieve merit. Both you and Ping He shall find your place—this is a double gain. Now, there is no need for enmity!” With these words, the wind ceased, the thunder stopped, and the bright moon hung in the sky, illuminating the vast smoky waves with pure light. At the pearl’s place on the water appeared an old dragon’s head, nodding thrice to the sky, then diving beneath the waves, vanishing without a trace. Ping He hurriedly bowed respectfully, crawled from the reeds, and clasped the pearl, returning home.

At dawn, the eastern sky pale and the red sun rising high, his mother was fumbling to dress on her bed. Ping He dared not disturb her, entering quietly and calling softly. Suddenly, Lady Wang opened her eyes and said, “Child, what do you hold in your hand? So red and beautiful!” Seeing his mother could now see, Ping He’s joy was boundless. Without explaining, he showed the red pearl before her. She sprang up, exclaiming, “My son, where did you get this treasure? At the sight of it, my eyes are bright again, clearer and sharper than when young!” She reached for the pearl, but Ping He said, “Mother, do not be hasty. This treasure is not to be handled carelessly. Let me find a way to hang it, so you may see it always. I promise your eyes will remain clear and never fall ill again.” She agreed and followed him to the main hall, where he tied the pearl with a cord and hung it in the center. A red light shone through inside and out. From then on, not only did Lady Wang’s eye disease vanish, but both mother and son felt vigorous and joyful. Moreover, this pearl was truly a wish-fulfilling jewel: whatever was needed, silently praying to it would cause the thing to appear in the house, inexhaustible and without fail. With such powerful aid, mother and son no longer worried about food or clothing. Yet Ping He’s nature was strange; though possessing this treasure, he refused to idle, continuing his daily hard labor through wind, rain, cold, and heat without rest.

One day, Lady Wang said, “Son, now that Heaven has blessed us with sufficient food and clothing, and your years are not few, you should seek a talented and beautiful maiden to marry early, so I may fulfill a great wish.” Ping He replied, “Mother’s kind wish, I will obey. Yet since receiving the immortal’s pearl and curing your eyes, I vowed to establish five hundred merits before speaking of marriage. Now over a month has passed, and though I have searched diligently, there is nothing for me to accomplish. What then?” Lady Wang suddenly realized, “Son, that is not difficult. The immortal treasure is meant to aid the world. Since you have it, you should share it, not only to accumulate virtue for yourself but also for the immortal master and the old dragon.” Before she finished, Ping He leapt with joy, saying, “Indeed, mother, your insight is profound! I had not thought of that! I will become a wandering doctor. When mortals suffer incurable diseases, I will shine the red pearl on them to dispel illness and prolong life. For the poor who lack food and clothing, I will silently pray to the pearl to send silver and rice. Within a year, I will surely have done a thousand good deeds.” Lady Wang said, “Very good! My son, be courageous and do not delay! Since you have resolved it, begin at once and see if it succeeds!” Ping He laughed, “The treasure does not obey humans. Since it cured my mother, it will surely cure others. It can care for my mother and save others’ suffering.” Lady Wang smiled, “That is excellent!” So Ping He ceased working and every day carried the red pearl, traveling about. Wherever there were sick people, shining the pearl’s light upon them, they all recovered.

At first, he treated only nearby villagers, but word spread far and wide, and people came from distant lands seeking cure. Ping He’s heart was to aid all; he took no money, and gifts he could not refuse he distributed to the poor in the village. Some honest and upright folk, struck by misfortune and hardship, sought silver and rice from the pearl through him. Thus, in less than three years, Ping He’s fame as a great benefactor was known near and far. Moreover, Ping He was straightforward and never lied. When asked how he gained such skill, he said it was all the pearl’s power; he himself knew nothing. When asked where he got the pearl, he never hid it, honestly telling all. This drew the attention of one man—the local official of Guankou, surnamed Mao, named Hu. Hearing of this strange matter in his jurisdiction, he wished to question Ping He and, if the treasure were real, use his official power to seize the pearl. Deciding on this, he consulted his wife, Lady Hu. She said, “If this treasure exists, first have him cure our daughter’s illness. Even if it costs much silver, buy it from him. If you use force alone, the people will gossip.” Mao Hu agreed and sent two messengers to summon Ping He. When Ping He asked the reason, the messengers said, “Our official’s daughter suffers from a confused mind. Hearing of the divine pearl that cures disease, we specially invite you to cure her, and you will be richly rewarded.” Ping He bade farewell to his mother and prepared to go. Lady Wang frowned, saying, “Son, official matters are not easy. Be careful!” Ping He replied, “I understand!” and followed the messengers to the yamen.

Mao Hu was delighted to hear the divine pearl doctor had come and personally received him with courtesy. He asked about the pearl’s origin and power. Ping He told the truth. Mao Hu was half-believing and invited him to treat his daughter. Ping He accompanied him inside. The girl’s face was pale as paper, eyes vacant and confused—clearly possessed by a demon. Ping He took out the red pearl and flashed it before her. The pearl was a spiritual object; how could mountain spirits or wild ghosts resist such numinous light?

With a cry, the girl fell backward. Ping He withdrew the pearl, and the girl suddenly sat up, seeing her parents, and wept aloud, “Father, mother, I have suffered so!” Mao Hu and his wife were overjoyed and speechless, bowing to Ping He, saying, “Our daughter has suffered this illness for half a year, unconscious, even to family strangers. Now, by your divine treasure’s light, she is instantly clear-headed. You are truly our benefactor.” Ping He humbly accepted praise. The girl said, “In spring, while playing in the back garden, a sudden stench wind struck my nose and I fainted. Since then, my actions have been without reason or understanding.” Ping He said, “That is no surprise. A demon spirit possessed the young lady to enjoy the blessings of the human world.” Mao Hu invited Ping He to the outer hall for a feast, asking if he would sell the pearl. Ping He smiled, “Though I have the pearl, it is not truly mine. When the time comes, the immortal master will reclaim it and return it to the old dragon. I dare not sell it. Even if you want it, you cannot keep it long. Why bother?” Mao Hu took this as refusal and begged repeatedly.

Ping He, being young and spirited, grew angry and said, “I received this divine pearl first to cure my mother’s eyes. Later, I helped others, merely to accumulate merit, never taking any reward. If placed in your mansion, you would have no time to treat others, wasting the pearl’s power. You are a great noble, with all comforts. Keeping this treasure only to collect it would be useless and would hinder my merit. Such harm to others and no benefit to yourself, I advise you not to do it!” Mao Hu’s anger flared. He ordered his men to seize Ping He and confiscate the pearl, to prevent his heresy and disorder. Seeing the men advance, Ping He’s anger rose. He sprang up, kicking one man and punching another to the ground. The men shouted and drew weapons, rushing him.

Fearing disaster, Ping He grasped the pearl and shouted, “My lord, no need for anger! Brothers, no need to fight! Hear me out.” Mao Hu thought he wished to surrender the pearl and ordered the men to hold back. Ping He calmly said, “My lord is my superior; I dare not disobey. Yet this pearl is not mine to keep. If I give it to you, the immortal master will rebuke me, the old dragon will claim it, and I cannot escape death, also bearing the guilt of negligence. If I obey your wish, I cannot leave the yamen alive. I would rather die here, so that after death I may seek forgiveness from the immortal master. If you doubt, watch me swallow the pearl now. Though I cannot survive, even if you cut me down, I will not complain.” Saying this, he opened his mouth and swallowed the red pearl, as large as a plum and red as rosy clouds. Mao Hu ordered his men to seize him, but it was too late. Ping He’s face changed, pale as gold paper, eyes like copper bells, and he walked straight out. Mao Hu dared not stop him.

Ping He hurried home, saw his mother, and wept, “My poor mother, I can no longer serve you!” Lady Wang was shocked and asked why. Ping He said only, “The red pearl is inside me!” Lady Wang, before he could say more, turned pale as earth. In haste, she said, “How can this be? The pearl is the dragon elixir. If it enters you, you will become a dragon!” Before she finished, a fierce wind rose, dark clouds gathered.

Lady Wang saw ten thousand rays of golden light, her mind dazzled and eyes confused. In midair sounded a dragon’s cry. Gazing fixedly, she saw a golden dragon winding up and down. Looking again for Ping He, he was nowhere to be found.

What strange events befell Ping He after his transformation into a dragon? We shall see in the next chapter.
