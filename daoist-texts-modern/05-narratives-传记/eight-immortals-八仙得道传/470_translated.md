# Chapter Two: Two Drops of Dragon’s Tears Spill to Form Wangniang Beach — A Celestial Sword Pierces the Blind Dragon’s Eyes

Now it happened that the God Erlang’s heart surged with restless blood. He had already come to understand the matter of Pinghe’s transformation into a dragon. Yet he also perceived a wave of grievance, spreading through the vast Heaven, sensing that Pinghe, having suffered wrong at the hands of officials, would surely seek revenge and redress his wrongs. Should the dragon’s body twist but once, the entire region within two thousand li of Guankou could be submerged beneath a great sea.

Hurriedly, he commanded the Yellow-Turbaned Strength Spirits, the guardian divine soldiers, to swiftly drive the wicked dragon into the deep pool, taking care not to harm its life. The strength spirits obeyed the imperial decree and rose into the air. Just then, they saw the dragon glaring fiercely, its brows knit in anger, still perched atop the Ping family’s rooftop, gazing down repeatedly, as if reluctant to part with the scene below.

Just as they prepared to unleash their power, suddenly the Mysterious Realman appeared, riding on clouds. Smiling, he addressed the strength spirits: “Gentlemen, no need to trouble yourselves. I have a certain karmic bond with this creature. Please entrust this matter to me. You may return and report the decree.” Seeing it was a true Realman, the strength spirits dared not disobey, bowing respectfully as they withdrew.

The Mysterious Realman brought the dragon to the water’s surface, murmuring incantations. Then, with a shout, he commanded: “Old dragon of the deep, your incarnation has arrived—why do you not emerge? What are you waiting for?” No sooner had he spoken than a great wind rose from the sea. From the depths, another dragon appeared, a shadowy form with shape but no substance.

The two dragons met as old acquaintances. The Realman seized the shadowy dragon and struck the dragon’s head in midair three times. In an instant, the dragon’s form vanished completely, and the two dragons merged into one. The Realman then instructed: “Henceforth, you shall cultivate in concealment for fifty years, after which you may ascend to the Heavenly Court and receive your official commission. Should you commit any violent acts, I will sever you with my flying sword.”

The dragon respectfully accepted the decree and nodded in thanks. Just as it was about to dive back into the water, it could not bear to part from its mother and looked back three times, shedding two drops of dragon’s tears. Where these tears fell, the shore immediately transformed into a beach. To this day, at Guankou, the remnants of this beach remain, passed down through the ages as Wangniang Beach. This is the origin of that tale.

Setting aside idle words, let us return to the Mysterious Realman, who having settled this case, mounted his cloud and prepared to return to his grotto. Just as he rose on the clouds, a colorful cloud drifted gently toward him. Looking closely, it was none other than his senior brother, the Fire Dragon Realman. The two immortals paused midair to greet one another.

The Fire Dragon asked, “Junior brother, what brings you here?” The Mysterious Realman smiled: “It was for that wicked dragon’s matter that I resolved the case. I was about to return to my Hengshan grotto to await you, so we might submit the decree together. How goes your own affair?” The Fire Dragon laughed: “You handled the dragon’s transformation, which is a matter of spiritual penetration and thus easily dispatched. I, however, deal with the rope dragon—same sound, different character. That slight difference demands many more tricks and efforts. I am now bound for the Eastern Sea to attend to this case!”

The Mysterious Realman chuckled: “You should hurry! Soon the lower realms will suffer a great water calamity, and the Sage of Water Control will emerge. Then the water and land realms will be clearly divided, marking the day these two wicked dragons rise. If delayed, their merit will be lost. Would that not be our fault? How could we face the Patriarch?”

The Fire Dragon laughed heartily: “You wild Daoist, when did you learn such cool words? You finish the easy task and then lecture me! Truly absurd!” The Mysterious Realman laughed along. The two immortals raised their hands in farewell. The Fire Dragon Realman then headed southeast, all the way to the Eastern Sea shore, to handle his official business.

As for the origin of this case, it began around the same time as the wicked dragon just described. The author, lamenting his own two hands’ inability to write two stories simultaneously, had to tell one and then the other—an unavoidable matter indeed.

Originally, the rope dragon spoken of by the Fire Dragon Realman dwelled west of the Eastern Sea, within the Qiantang River. Today, in central Zhejiang Province, there lies a shallow water shoal spanning the upper and lower reaches of the Qiantang River, known now as Qililong Water. The water is shallow and the shoal swift, making navigation difficult. Sometimes, when the wind blows, sailing becomes easier, hence the old saying: “With wind, seven li; without wind, seventy li.” Every boatman and resident along the Qiantang River knows this well—though this is a later saying.

In ancient times, this place was not called Qililong but Fulong Pool. The meaning is clear: it was named for the rope dragon that once lurked here. The term “rope dragon” was a jest by the Fire Dragon Realman. The character for rope (繩) is somewhat ambiguous. In truth, it was a huge, thick rattan rope cable.

At that time, the name Fulong Pool had not been recorded, and the author had not traced its earliest name. In any case, this spot is the deepest part of the Qiantang River, thus called a pool. In ancient times, tools were crude, and boats and rafts were imperfect. Encountering this deep pool was perilous. With no other means, people tied many large boats together, moving as one. This increased the strength of the hulls, preventing them from being swept away by great winds, and with many hands aboard, care was easier.

This method, though clumsy, was effective. Even in enlightened times, local raft operators still follow this rule. Today, iron chains have replaced rattan cables, but back then, rattan was universal.

Since the invention of linked boats, safety greatly improved. Shipwrecks became rare, though danger never vanished entirely. One day, that very dragon’s rattan cable, tied to several large boats, encountered a great wind and sank to the pool’s bottom. All aboard perished utterly in a moment.

Even the strongest bamboo and wooden vessels, after a few years, succumbed to rot and decay, blending with mud at the pool’s bottom. Yet, unexpectedly, after all else had dissolved, that rattan cable alone remained, suddenly free and unfettered. Sometimes it floated to the surface, drifting ten or eight li; sometimes it sank deep, hiding three or five years.

After more than three hundred years, it neither decayed nor faded but shimmered with a faint glow, showing hints of color. Because rattan is tougher than bamboo or wood and lighter in weight, it could float easily. Bathed alternately by sunlight’s forging and moonlight’s immersion, over the years it became a kind of reincarnated living being, an organic spiritual entity.

Though the sun and moon had no intent in nurturing it, it gained the natural artistry of Heaven and Earth, becoming a dragon body. Its scales, mouth, nose, whiskers—all were complete, save that it had not cultivated eyes. Thus, though it rose and sank, alive and vivid as a true dragon, it suffered the misery of blindness, unable to see the colorful world or the myriad beings, blindly bumping about daily, seeking water creatures to fill its belly.

Because of its enormous size and cultivation, ordinary fish and shrimp could not contend with it. Whenever the blind dragon opened its mouth, many creatures were inevitably swallowed whole. Year after year, the number of beings it slaughtered was countless. Fortunately, it had already attained spiritual understanding and a good root of virtue. Aside from devouring fish and shrimp, it never sank boats or harmed humans.

Yet its vast bulk, when it turned, inevitably stirred waves and wind. Sometimes, because of its blindness, it could not see people or boats passing by. When it briefly revealed itself, it was enough to terrify human souls. This was unavoidable. Though the blind dragon meant no harm, many suffered from its inadvertent mischief.

No one knows in which era or year, but the Fire Dragon Realman once traveled by boat with two upright officials of the court. They encountered this dragon’s appearance. In an instant, Heaven and Earth darkened, sun and moon lost their light, and the Realman’s boat rocked violently.

The Realman angrily exclaimed, “What wicked beast dares to cause havoc here?” Calling upon the local land deities, he questioned them. The land gods revealed the true situation and the dragon’s origin and nature.

The Realman laughed: “A mere rope dares to be so insolent!” The two officials asked, “Is there a method to subdue it?” The Realman nodded: “Such a small beast is no match for my sword! It is a pity it has cultivated many years and done no harm, so I cannot bear to destroy it.”

The officials said, “Such a beast has no good heart. It has no eyes yet and cannot do evil now. When it develops eyes, it will be like a tiger with wings—how can mortals resist? Even if a master tries to deal with it then, it won’t be so easy.”

The Realman sighed: “The crime is not yet manifest, the evil fruit not yet ripe—how can I rashly slay it?” The official most concerned for the people said, “Since the Immortal will not kill it, we, as high officials, must remove the harm for the people. Please lend us your precious sword. If there is any offense against Heaven, we will bear it together, not implicating you. What say you?”

The Realman smiled: “You serve the nation and people—no offense there. Since you say so, I will lend you my sword.” He then produced a sword about an inch long. Waving it in the wind, it split into two, pointing to each, he said: “This is the female sword, this the male sword. The land gods say this dragon has a female form and must be cut with the female sword. Do not mistake them.”

The officials took both swords, examining them carefully. Though only an inch long, they gleamed with flashing light and chilling cold. Shining them close to the face caused a chill. One official laughed: “The dragon is large, the sword small—can it work?”

The Realman laughed heartily: “Do not underestimate this sword. I learned the Heavenly Escape Sword Technique from the Primordial Lady. This sword has been tempered for three thousand years. It can be small or large, hidden or manifest, as you wish. When unused, it can shrink to the smallest size or grow as large as you like. Throw it like an arrow; its speed rivals the wind. Wherever its tip strikes, no distance is too far, no range too close. It is a rare treasure of true immortals, not to be compared with mere mortal iron forged by fire!”

The officials rejoiced and sought the blind dragon’s location. Suddenly, the dragon twisted again, and the boat rocked violently. The Realman sat calmly at the stern, pointing and indicating the dragon’s head.

The sword-bearing official, flustered and confused, forgot the Realman’s instructions entirely. He threw the male sword. A streak of blue light shot toward the dragon’s head.

The Realman cried out in alarm, “Wrong! You used the male sword!” Before he finished, the sword returned to the official’s hand. Instantly, the waves grew fiercer. From the misty water emerged a huge dragon’s head, which nodded repeatedly to the Realman and others more than a dozen times. Then it gently turned and sank into the distance, never to be seen again.

This terrified the two officials into confusion, leaving them speechless. The Realman sighed: “Fate is fixed; human effort cannot alter it. This beast has concealed itself underwater, cultivating many years, reaching such a state through a mere rope cable. Yet it has a good root and dares not commit evil. This is rare and worthy of Heaven’s favor. Though it has minor faults of appetite, these are forgivable. I refused to slay it out of compassion and respect for the Dao, not the petty kindness of ordinary men.

“But you two would not relent, insisting on removing the harm for the people. In haste, you reversed male and female swords, harming the very one you love, killing to preserve. Originally, this creature had all limbs complete except eyes. To develop two eyes would require at least five hundred years of cultivation. Now, with this sword’s single thrust, two holes were pierced, forming a pair of eyes. Have you not, in effect, fulfilled its five hundred years of hard work?”

The officials stared blankly at each other, speechless. The Realman took back the swords and merged them into one. At that moment, the waves calmed, the wind ceased, and the sun stood at its zenith—brightest and hottest of the day.

The Realman held the sword to the sunlight and laughed: “This beast is truly detestable. I helped it, and it defiled my treasure!” Then, blowing toward the sun, the sword emitted ten thousand feet of golden light, dazzling the eyes. A closer look revealed only his empty hands—the sword had vanished.

The officials regained composure and asked, “Master, how do you know the sword pierced two eyes? And with one strike, surely only one hole was made?”

The Realman smiled: “Yin and yang resonate to produce all things. When two yins or two yangs of the same nature meet, harm often results. This creature, having formed a female body, was struck with the male sword. Where the male energy reached, resonance was born. Your sword just struck its forehead, effectively creating the two eyes it had yet to cultivate. Moreover, a sword piercing often enters one side and exits the other, forming two holes. All this is predestined, a fortunate coincidence. This creature’s fate is not to perish but to enjoy future blessings. Even our meeting today seems arranged for this eye-opening. Is it not wondrous?”

The officials said, “If so, should it harm the world in future, it will be our fault! Master, please use your divine arts to cut it down early, preventing harm and avoiding further guilt.”

The Realman laughed: “No need. Did you not see the dragon nod repeatedly as it sank? That is deep gratitude and sincere respect. Having received its reverence, how can we be enemies? Besides, this creature’s lowly origin yet fierce nature and good fortune show it is not evil. The future need not be feared.

“To speak boldly, if it ever does commit violence after full cultivation, we will surely be held accountable. Fate is fixed; escape is impossible. When that time comes, we will deal with it. But now, while it is devoted to the Dao, we must neither aid nor harm it capriciously. Such reversals are unworthy of immortals. Know that opposing Heaven brings misfortune; defying principle invites disaster. I do not fear this mere beast, nor will I quarrel with it.”

The two officials fell silent. The Realman added: “Though so, to prevent evil and encourage progress, I will apply a minor spell to warn and awaken it. This will benefit the dragon itself.”

He reached toward the water, beckoning. The giant dragon slowly rose, cautious and reserved, yet the water’s surface trembled like waves. It raised its head and nodded respectfully to the Realman.

The Realman’s tone grew serious: “You are a rattan cable who has formed a dragon body. With my sword granting you eyes, you have saved much cultivation. Your fortune is great. From now on, you must redouble your efforts, neither slackening nor harming living beings or travelers. Your eyes will fully shine in three months. Since opened by my celestial sword, your radiance will surpass all others. Up close, you can discern the smallest detail; afar, you can see a thousand li. This is a once-in-a-thousand-years opportunity, rare and precious. If you grow complacent and fail to advance, what a pity! Not only will your true fruit be delayed, but you risk offending Heaven and betraying your years of effort.

“If you rely on petty skills to do evil, your life will not be preserved, and after death you will be condemned to the Nine Nether Hells, unable to ascend. To encourage your progress and help you attain the Dao, within one hundred li of here I have set a sharp gate. Not only you, but all beings cultivating the Dao in this river must pass through it to leave the mortal world and ascend to the immortal realm.

“The gate’s bottom cover leaves only a slit as narrow as a rope. Without transforming your dharma body finer than a silk thread, you cannot pass. Touching the gate causes it to snap shut, instantly severing head from body. This is the most dangerous and terrifying checkpoint.

“Do not think I mean to trouble you. First, it shows how difficult attaining the Dao is, making success all the more precious. Second, it warns those not yet accomplished to avoid complacency and cultivate respect. Third, with this power, you become no different from immortals, ensuring you will not be scorned after true attainment. What do you think of this method?”

The dragon knelt repeatedly, showing utmost submission. The Realman shouted, “Go!” The dragon nodded several times and vanished like a breeze.

Having done this, the Realman bade farewell to the two officials and returned to his grotto.

The immortal sun and moon differ from mortal ones. In the blink of an eye, seventy or eighty years passed—just the time when the Mysterious Realman transformed Pinghe at Guankou and perfected the old dragon.

The Mysterious Realman and Fire Dragon Realman both hailed from the Patriarch Laozi’s lineage. Their success with the two dragons was unintentional but foreseen by Laozi. He had calculated that the east and west dragons would attain the Dao under these two Realmen. After their ascension, great fortunes awaited them.

Thus, he instructed them to swiftly reap the fruits of the causes they had sown. All beings becoming immortals must first transform into human form. The Mysterious Realman used the method of merging two souls to perfect the Guankou old dragon. The Fire Dragon Realman also sought to have the rattan dragon pass through a human body.

So, parting from the Mysterious Realman, the Fire Dragon hurried on clouds to Qililong. Knowing the rattan dragon had opened its eyes, it cultivated diligently for seventy or eighty years. At first, it still ate some creatures for sustenance, but later mastered the Dao’s energy to repel hunger, feeding only on water reeds and the like, becoming unaware of hunger.

It cultivated its body to grow large or small, thick or thin, truly becoming a dragon who had attained the Dao and penetrated the mysterious.

How could the Fire Dragon Realman not rejoice? He cast a summoning spell to call the dragon to the surface. The dragon, upon seeing the Realman, seemed filled with both sorrow and joy. It coiled its body into a great circle, embracing the Realman, repeatedly nodding its dragon head before him.

The Realman praised it and led it through the dragon gate. The dragon transformed into a body as fine as hair and as short as an earthworm, trembling as it slipped through the gate’s narrowest part.

The gate was a mechanism set by immortals; if a living being passed, the upper and lower blades would snap shut fiercely. A dragon’s roar echoed through the water, shaking the valleys on both banks.

Whether the dragon’s life endured or not remains unknown—this will be revealed in the next chapter.
