# Chapter Three: Testing the Daoist Heart—The Specially Set Welcoming Dragon Gate; The Mortal Body Surrenders into the Embrace of a Filial Maiden

Now, it is told that the Venerable Fire Dragon, having taken the divine dragon formed from that woven bamboo cable, commanded it to follow the earlier decree: it must transform its dharma body until it became exceedingly fine and subtle, so as to pass through the gate specially set in advance. Only if it could penetrate this gate would its cultivation be deemed successful; if it failed, not only would all its功 (merit) be lost, but it would also unjustly forfeit its life beneath the sharp edge. This was a matter of utmost peril. Some say this was merely the Fire Dragon Venerable’s way to test the courage of those who cultivate the dao, always encouraging them to apply themselves diligently.

In truth, for those sincere in their cultivation, this gate has never harmed their lives. Rather, it serves as a barrier for the batch of water-dwelling demons who, having mastered wicked arts, seek to come ashore to harm humans. Once the gate’s blades close, their lives are forfeit. Since the gate’s establishment, many evil spirits have been eliminated. Later, those demons, knowing the gate’s sharpness and that they cannot leave the water without passing through it, ceased their wicked thoughts and quietly cultivated the correct fruition. This is all the功 (merit) wrought by the Fire Dragon Venerable’s gate.

As for the dragon formed from the woven cable, its dao attainment was complete. At that moment, it passed through the gate in a single dive, without the slightest injury. Truly, its divine power was vast, and its heart was bold and steadfast. Even if its skill were not fully formed, how could the Venerable bear to place it in mortal peril? Though this may sound idealistic, it seems reasonable. Hence, another saying arose: this gate is not merely a tool to slay dragons, but rather a ladder welcoming dragons to ascend to Heaven. Thus, all call this gate the Welcoming Dragon Gate. The opening of the Welcoming Dragon Gate is simply called the gate’s mouth. Originally, this gate and its mouth were located within the Seven-Li Rapids; later generations, through error and rumor, claimed it was at the Qiantang River’s mouth. How this confusion arose is lost to history. 

Now, the tale continues: the Fire Dragon Venerable stood amidst the clouds, watching the woven dragon pass through the gate, his heart greatly pleased. He hastily stretched out his hand in invitation, and the dragon leapt upward. The Venerable commanded, “You have labored for hundreds of years, your功 (achievement) reaching about eighty or ninety percent. Now you must take human form for a while before ascending to Heaven to receive the imperial edict and take your place among the immortals.” The dragon repeatedly kowtowed in gratitude. The Venerable clasped the dragon’s head with both hands, pressed it to his forehead, and, holding the dragon pearl in hand, swept his robe’s sleeve wide, pushing the dragon’s clumsy corporeal form straight into his old lair—the Hidden Dragon Pool. He chanted the spell of mountain-moving, summoning a great mountain to press the dragon’s body into mud and powder. From then on, this pool, plunging down ten thousand zhang, transformed into a towering mountain. Over the years, the mountain’s slope stretched out into the river. Sand and stones from the mountain flew into the river, forming a shoal near the mountain. This is what is now called the Seven-Li Rapids. Even today, the local folk can recount the rise and fall of this valley’s tale. But the ages are long, and the legends differ—each telling varies from the next.

Meanwhile, though the dragon’s body was pressed beneath the mountain, its numinous soul still opened wide its great mouth, circling the Venerable’s body toward the dragon pearl held in his hand. The Venerable, holding the dragon pearl and bound to the great dragon, was like the dragon’s soul-banner. Seeing the dragon’s body pressed beneath the mountain, he unexpectedly clapped his hands and laughed, then suddenly bowed his head to see the dragon soul continuously looking back toward the deep pool. The Venerable immediately reached out and struck the mud pellet on his forehead, sharply commanding, “Do you still cling to that ugly, moldy woven cable?” Hearing this, the dragon soul hastily calmed itself, holding the precious pearl in its mouth upon the Venerable’s palm, winding and unwinding, faintly traveling over three hundred li until dawn broke. The country folk rose early. 

The Venerable descended from the clouds and pointed to a girl washing clothes by the riverbank, saying, “Wretched beast, do you not see that river maiden? She is of marriageable age, a filial daughter of this place. I now send you into her womb, so that she may conceive by your influence, just as the Patriarch reincarnated as the Jade Maiden. First, this does not defile your dharma body; second, it reveals your origin as unlike others. Consider it a rare opportunity from your long labor. I shall guide you again in due time. Go well!” Having said this, he raised the dragon pearl and cast it toward the girl. Suddenly, a thunderclap burst in midair, a flash of golden light striking straight into her mouth. The girl was greatly startled, uttering a cry before fainting by the riverbank. The Venerable approached and whispered in her ear, “Hu Xiuchun, listen well. Because of your pure filial piety, I send this divine dragon to you as a daughter. Nurture it well; in time, you will reap great benefit.” Though fainted, Xiuchun heard the command and nodded before awakening. 

As she came to, the sun shone brightly before her. Many villagers gathered by the riverbank, discussing the sudden thunderclap. Seeing Xiugu holding her clothes, sitting dazed, they hurried to ask, “Did you hear the thunder?” Xiuchun, heart full of confusion, could not answer. Seeing her strange demeanor, all said, “Unbelievable! She must have been stunned by the great thunder! Quickly take her home!” Several women helped Xiuchun up, supporting and pulling her along to her home. Her father, Old Hu, and mother, Madam Shen, had been worried, for Xiuchun had not returned from washing clothes and the sudden thunder frightened them. Seeing the crowd bringing her back, they were both alarmed and puzzled. 

Upon reaching home, Xiuchun’s mind cleared. Fearing to alarm her parents, she feigned normalcy and thanked the crowd. She told her parents, “Just now, when the thunder roared, it seemed as if ten thousand golden lights rushed into my belly. I was so frightened I fainted! Thanks to my sisters who brought me back, I am calmer now. Father, mother, please do not worry.” Seeing her able to speak and behave as usual, the Hu couple felt a stone fall from their hearts. They invited the villagers inside, offering seats and tea. The talk turned to strange omens accompanying sudden thunder, then all dispersed.

Yet Xiuchun dared not reveal the Venerable’s instructions to her parents. From that day forth, she often felt a trembling within her belly, as if something lay inside, causing her heart to flutter. She pondered the Venerable’s words and felt they could not be wrong. Her parents longed for a child, so she vowed never to marry, taking the daughter’s place to comfort the family. Yet how could a girl carry on the ancestral line? If she lived out her days thus, her parents’ bloodline would end with her—a matter not quite proper. According to the Venerable’s words, though she would not wed, she could still conceive. Though the time was not ideal, and though the child would be a girl, when she grew and married a fine son-in-law, the family line would continue—thus fulfilling both ends. But no one else knew the truth, and she could not explain it. When the child was born, neighbors would surely gossip, and no argument would clear her name. This thought almost crushed her tender heart.

Five or six months passed, and her belly steadily swelled. Xiuchun grew desperate, trapped with no way out, caught between two difficulties. She soon fell ill from worry, eating little, her face yellow and thin, limbs weak—symptoms much like a pregnant woman’s. The Hu couple began to notice, but since Xiuchun worked at home by day and slept with her mother at night, there was no suspicion of illicit affairs. They suspected some swelling illness, and Madam Shen often questioned her privately. Xiuchun only said it began after the thunder, still afraid to speak of the Venerable’s words. When the tenth month arrived and her belly was full and round, all agreed it was a sign of joy. Except for her parents, who firmly believed in her innocence, neighbors’ words were harsh. Xiuchun heard the gossip and was so ashamed she dared not step outside her door.

As her delivery approached, Xiuchun knew she could no longer hide the truth. She told Madam Shen everything the Venerable had instructed. Shen was both shocked and joyous, hastening to inform Old Hu. Being a scholar, Old Hu knew of the Patriarch’s reincarnation as the Jade Maiden and nodded, saying, “Strange things abound in this world. If what Xiuchun says is true, this child surely has great roots. The Jade Maiden was born from the side; if our child is the same, where would we find such a midwife?” Shen also rejoiced, “If the child is born of an immortal, surely an immortal will watch over her. What is there to fear? But our daughter is young and shy, pregnant without a husband—such a rare thing in the world. No matter how you explain, who will believe us? How will Xiuchun face the world?” Old Hu replied, “There is nothing to be done. For now, we must tell only those we trust. Our family has never offended anyone. Without proof, no one can slander our Xiuchun’s name.” Shen agreed. Thus the old couple confided in a few trusted people. Within days, the whole village knew. Some believed, some did not. Since it was none of their business, few cared to verify truth or falsehood. Those who doubted Xiuchun, unable to name any man, dared not speak openly. Yet suspicion lingered in many hearts.

The day of delivery arrived. Usually, a woman in labor feels something descending with pain. Xiuchun’s pain pressed upward, as if something inside pushed from her belly to her chest. The Hu couple summoned an experienced midwife from the village and asked about this upward pressure. The midwife could offer no explanation, only saying, “Miss has an immortal’s child; perhaps it is different from ordinary births.” Old Hu, more sensible, thought the midwife ignorant and unfit to deliver such a strange birth. If the child truly came from the side, where would they find such a great opening?

He told Shen, who grew more anxious. Xiuchun’s pains grew stronger from morning till noon, the pressure rising past her chest, pressing ever upward. She bit her teeth and clenched her fists, eyes spinning, nearly fainting. The Hu couple prayed fervently, setting up an incense altar to Heaven, sincerely beseeching the immortal who sent the child to save her life. Amid the turmoil, a sudden knocking outside startled them, with a loud call: “Specialist in difficult births, expert in strange children!” Old Hu rejoiced, “My daughter suffers a strange birth; now someone claims to specialize in such—how miraculous! Surely Heaven sent this immortal to save her!” Shen hurried outside to see, finding an old Daoist nun, both lame and dark-skinned, knocking and calling from some distance. Shen ran after her, begging, “Immortal nun, please save my daughter’s life!” The nun asked, “Is it a difficult birth or a strange child? If a normal birth, such as breech or lotus birth, unclean, I outsiders will not take it. But if a strange child, I can help!” Shen replied, “It is a strange child, most strange and rare! Master, please hurry! If delayed, she will die!” The nun laughed, “Boys and girls come as fruit ripens; why such haste? Well, I just came from downriver and have yet to take a case. Fate has brought me to you and this strange child. We are bound by destiny; I shall go with you.” Limping, she turned and walked back. Shen feared she could not keep up and tried to support her, but the nun moved steadily ahead, and Shen could only follow a few steps behind. At the house, without guidance, the nun boldly entered. Shen followed, realizing this nun was no ordinary person. 

Just as Shen was about to explain Xiuchun’s long suffering, the nun interrupted, eager to meet the young lady. At the door, Xiuchun suddenly cried out, “The pain will kill me!” Shen’s heart shattered; she rushed in, holding Xiuchun, who had eyes rolled back, legs stiff, and a faint spirit already leaving her body. Shen wailed, “Xiuchun, my child, why have you left us? Ah, my heart! You suffered so much!” As she cried, relatives and neighbors crowded in, pushing the nun to the back. Old Hu, grief-stricken, saw the nun coldly smile at Xiuchun’s lifeless form.

Old Hu angrily said, “You nun have no heart! Someone has died, and we grieve, yet you smile? Have you no compassion?” The nun sneered, “You invited me but never consulted me, leaving me aside while you weep over your dead. Is this not laughable?” Old Hu said nothing. Shen suddenly understood, dropped Xiuchun, parted the crowd, and knelt before the nun, bowing and weeping without words. Old Hu joined in pleading. The nun laughed, “Rise, rise, no need for such ceremony! I came here with fate, and just now said we are bound. Now her life hangs by a thread; how could I stand by and do nothing?” She took a bowl of pure water, sprinkled it over Xiuchun’s body, and shouted, “You stubborn dragon, why not come forth? What are you waiting for?” Before finishing, Xiuchun’s eyes moved, mouth opened, limbs stirred. Old Hu and Shen rejoiced, “Our daughter is saved!” The crowd marveled. 

Xiuchun sat up, suddenly nauseous, and spat out a flesh ball onto the floor. Its sound was crisp and clear, like gold. At first the ball was the size of a pellet. The nun sprinkled it with water again, swelling it tenfold. As all marveled, a thunderous crash like Heaven and Earth breaking sounded. The ball split in two, revealing a rosy-lipped, white-toothed, exquisite girl holding a tiny, shining pearl no larger than a mustard seed. The nun quickly took the pearl, placed it in her mouth, tilted her head back, and swallowed it. The Hu couple and all present were stunned. Amid the commotion, Xiuchun suddenly cried, “I’m hungry! Bring me food!” 

Shen, delighted, nearly forgot Xiuchun herself. She hurried to ask, “Do you feel any pain?” Xiuchun shook her head, “Not at all, only terribly hungry. Mother, please bring me food.” Shen said, “You are weak after birth; how can you eat?” Xiuchun did not reply. The nun said, “No matter! No matter! Hunger must be satisfied. Not only the young lady, but this poor nun also needs a drink of wine.” Shen, hearing this, was reassured. She sent someone to cook and prepared to care for the flesh ball. The nun stopped her, “Do not touch this thing. I will find a place to keep it.” She looked at a wooden rice bucket by the bed, ordered the rice poured out, then lifted the two halves of the flesh ball, pressed them together until it was whole again. The seam was flawless, like a seamless celestial garment. From her mouth, she spat a golden needle three inches long, pierced the ball seven times, making seven holes, then placed it in the bucket. Laughing, she said, “This thing will be very useful. Whatever is needed, the child can take it and have it immediately. It must be well preserved.” 

She watched Shen wrap the child and place her by Xiuchun’s pillow, then all sat down outside. Old Hu asked, “Where is your temple, nun? What is your dharma name?” The nun laughed, “Monastics call this and that; I answer to whatever name you give me. Fate brings us together; without it, we cannot meet. As for where I live, there is no fixed place. If I had one, I would be like you, staying home to receive blessings. Why wander East and West?” Old Hu, hearing her words full of mystery, bowed in respect and asked, “My daughter conceived without a husband, born by mouth, oviparous—what fortune or misfortune is this? Please enlighten us.” The nun laughed, “I am no immortal; how would I know? But if your heart is pure and your daughter truly filial, how could Heaven be so cruel as to send a bad spirit to ruin your family?” Old Hu thanked her.

Soon Shen arranged a table of vegetarian wine and food, inviting the nun to partake freely. The nun ate and drank heartily, then thanked all and hurried away. The Hu couple escorted her outside, but she vanished without a trace. Shen chided her husband, “That nun must be an immortal. Why did you not keep her longer, so I could ask more?” Old Hu smiled, “Immortals cannot linger in our home. See how she disappeared as soon as she stepped outside. She must be in a hurry. Our child, though a girl, surely has true destiny, stronger than many boys. Hence this strange origin and the immortal’s aid at birth. We must heed the immortal’s instructions and raise her well. Great blessings will follow. No need to pester immortals.” Shen said no more.

The old couple and Xiuchun cherished the child like a bright jewel in the palm. The child was strange indeed: after one month, she could speak. Old Hu named her “Flying Dragon” and personally taught her to read and write. By age ten, she had filled her mind with knowledge. As Old Hu aged, he sent her to study under a private tutor in the village. Her classmates, seven or eight in number, boys and girls about her age, were far inferior in talent and character. The teacher praised Flying Dragon’s conduct and learning as unmatched, which bred jealousy. The classmates often conspired to bully her. Flying Dragon, steadfast in her mother’s teachings, focused on her studies and bore all other matters with patience. For years, peace was maintained.

One day, as if fate decreed, Flying Dragon finished her lessons early and sat quietly at her desk, waiting for the teacher to dismiss class. Suddenly, a classmate, unable to understand the lesson, asked her to do some lines for him. Fearful the teacher would find out, Flying Dragon refused. The student, seeing her silence, began to insult her personally, then, seeing no reply, slandered her mother Xiuchun, saying Flying Dragon was born of a mother without a father, conceived before marriage, clearly an illegitimate child unfit to study. Flying Dragon, a deeply filial and respectful person, could not bear her mother’s name to be sullied because of her. Though she said nothing then, after school she wept and told the teacher she could no longer attend. The teacher was shocked and asked why, but Flying Dragon remained silent.

At home, she said nothing to her grandparents or mother, only wept bitterly. The Hu couple, alarmed and confused, asked, “Child, who has bullied you? Tell us! We will make them pay.” Flying Dragon shook her head, “No need to doubt. This is a matter I cannot speak of. Even if I died, I would not say. From now on, I will not return to that school.” Old Hu, unable to get more, was troubled. Just then the teacher came and asked about the matter. All were lost in a fog. Since Flying Dragon resolved not to return, they could only let it be.

Months later, the classmates’ gossip emerged: the slanderous student claimed Flying Dragon’s mother had an affair, naming random men as her lover, and that Flying Dragon was their illegitimate child. Because of this scandal, mother and daughter could not face anyone and stopped attending school. Such idle talk found believers. Soon the rumor reached the Hu couple. Shen told Xiuchun, who silently wept, tears flowing unceasingly.

What happened next remains untold, to be revealed in the next chapter.
