# Chapter Four: Bearing False Accusations of Conception Without a Husband — Illuminating Heart and Trace, the Maiden Casts Herself into the River

Now, it happened that Xiuchun, upon hearing her mother speak thus, could not help but be overcome with sorrow, tears falling like rain. From that day forth, she neither spoke nor smiled, eating but little. Each day she knit her brows tightly, and upon her forehead appeared lines of deep furrows. Observing her, one could plainly see that some great burden weighed upon her heart, a secret grief she could not voice. Months passed, and her body grew ever thinner, her spirit utterly extinguished. Though she lived among the living, no different from others in form, she was lost in soul and spirit, wan and joyless, so much so that even strangers who saw her could not help but grieve for her plight.

At this time, her parents also perceived that something was amiss in her condition. The husband and wife could only laboriously counsel and persuade her. Yet, Xiuchun neither revealed the cause of her sorrow nor the origin of her illness. No matter how much they urged or reasoned, she would only respond with words of obedience, outwardly compliant, but inwardly her heart remained unchanged, and her ailment persisted as before.

But misfortunes never come singly. Because of Xiuchun’s illness, the household lost all joy. That very year, a plague swept through the village, leaving death strewn like pillows. Her parents, too, passed away in succession during this calamity. Xiuchun and her child could not but weep their fill and arrange the funerary rites. When the mourning was complete, Xiuchun suddenly summoned Feilong and said to him: “My son, do you know that your mother was never wed? Do you know whence your body came?” Then she pursued, “Why did your mother not marry? If she did not marry, why then was it that she bore you? And why did she raise you to this age?”

Feilong, hearing the taunts of classmates who mocked her mother, was eager indeed to uncover the truth of his own origin and the story of his mother’s conception without a husband. Yet the villagers, fond of curiosity and fond of spinning odd tales, took what was plain and made it strange. What was truly without marvel, in their mouths became a thousand wonders. If there was any marvel, they would surely add branches and leaves, piling on many details, so that the truth was often confused and distorted beyond recognition, wandering far from the reality. Zhang Jia said this, Li Yi said that; their words conflicted so that Feilong was left bewildered, much like the saying in the plays: “Better not to ask; once you ask, you become even more confused.” She dared not question her birth mother or the two grand ancestors, so she kept her thoughts locked in her heart, waiting for a chance to ask. If her mother was truly innocent and conceived without a husband, she resolved to find the classmate who had slandered her, to confront him sternly, to restore her mother’s chastity and reclaim the dignity she had lost. These thoughts she kept hidden; none could see them.

Now, when her mother suddenly raised this question, Feilong hastened to kneel, bowing her head and shedding tears, saying, “Mother, why do you ask this today? Had I understood the cause earlier, I would have found a way to prevent you from living in such sorrow and tears.”

These words of Feilong were well chosen. They neither diminished her mother’s honor nor concealed the long-held grievance she had never dared to voice. Upon hearing them, her mother burst into loud lamentation, allowing her beloved daughter to kneel before her without pulling her up, only sorrowfully saying, “Ignorant creature, you yourself do not know whence your body came! How then could I, your mother, possibly know?” After speaking, she choked back her sobs but still let Feilong kneel on the ground. Seeing this, Feilong dared not rise nor interrupt. After a long while, her mother reached into a pouch and threw a piece of paper before her, crying out, “If you want to know the story of your birth, it is all on this paper. If not for you, this wretched woman would not have had to endure so much idle gossip and endless injustice in this world! Now that my parents have passed on, my responsibility to them is fulfilled; my responsibility to you must also be eased. From now on, you may live as a pure and chaste person, and I, as your mother, may finally end my karmic debts and avoid further suffering in this life.”

Having said this, she turned without looking back, covering her sleeves and returning to her chamber. Feilong, holding the paper carefully, knelt and read it thoroughly. Only then did she understand her own origin, the reason her mother conceived without a husband, and the bitter years of hardship and slander she had endured. At the end were a few farewell words, and from her mother’s tone, it was clear she intended to die to make her resolve known. At first, Feilong was so absorbed that she did not notice her mother’s movements. When she finished reading, her heart was heavy with sorrow and pain; tears fell like rain upon the paper. Only when she lifted her eyes did she find her mother no longer present, having quietly left. Feilong’s anxiety grew grave; even the tears she had shed seemed to dry up. She was certain her mother’s departure foretold no good. Hastily, she rushed about the house searching for her. No trace was found anywhere. She thought, in the blink of an eye, her mother could not have gone far. Perhaps she had cast herself into the river. Surely, if so, she would not sink immediately. With urgency, Feilong hurried to the riverbank and found a letter lying there, addressed: “To my son Feilong, personally.”

Feilong, reckless of life or death, tore it open and read:

“If I die early, you shall not be born; if I do not die, you cannot be a man. Years ago, I conceived you here at this very bank; today I part from you here as well. If we cannot part, summon my soul here first. After one or two days, my body will rise; you may bury me atop a high mountain. Our family is poor, nothing to exchange. I recall the immortal’s earnest words: if in urgent need, you may seek from your stubborn shell. For years I labored in service to my parents and to nurture you, enduring hardship and bitterness, but that is past. Since there is no urgent need, I have not asked before. Now knowing the difficulty, I tell you thus: your stubborn shell lies behind my bed, in the rice bin. You have the root of immortality and will surely become great. I, a woman of little insight, am unfit to teach you; you must strive on your own. — Your mother, Chun, last words.”

Feilong gazed upon the great waters, the waves still, the world silent. Only the curious crowd had gathered, filling the riverbank. After reading the will, she wailed and fainted, but neighbors helped her back into the house. Upon awakening, she sought her mother’s body, and neighbors armed themselves to aid her at the river’s edge. Some measured depth with ropes; others probed with poles; skilled swimmers scoured the water’s surface for a corpse. Yet all efforts were in vain.

Feilong wept and suddenly plunged into the water herself to search. The crowd shouted, “Lady Long, do not go! You cannot swim; are you not afraid of drowning?” But Feilong was truly a dragon incarnate; though human in form, her nature remained unchanged. Entering the water, she felt no suffocation, only ease and delight, more joyful than on land. Her eyes were clear; even in the deepest depths, she could see every blade of grass and insect. Watching her dive and search below, the onlookers shook their heads in sorrow, saying, “Such a devoted child, now risking her life so!”

As they stood amazed and helpless, suddenly the water’s surface stirred with waves, white foam swirling. Countless fish, shrimp, turtles, and tortoises fled like arrows downstream. As ruler of the aquatic realm, the dragon’s presence disturbed these creatures, who fled in terror. While the crowd marveled, Feilong emerged from the water, cradling a corpse, swimming toward the shore. Seeing this, all rejoiced, saying, “The devoted daughter surely has divine protection. Though she never learned to swim, she has found her mother’s body beneath the waves — truly a miracle!”

As they spoke, they helped her lift the body ashore. Feilong herself leapt out, collapsing over the corpse, weeping without end. They urged her to rest and helped raise the body. Unexpectedly, beneath the corpse’s belly was tied a large stone. Upon closer inspection, it was clear her mother had resolved to die but feared the body might float, so she used the stone’s weight to sink easily. The crowd sighed, “Who would have thought this sister so fierce in spirit?” They hurriedly untied the stone. Feilong, with seven or eight helpers, carried the body home, preparing to buy a coffin and perform the burial rites.

Feilong showed the will to the neighbors and led them to the rice bin behind her mother’s bed. There lay a shining orb, cracked with seven holes. Some neighbors knew of it, some had seen it before, and all said, “Indeed! When the immortal departed, there was such a command. Now with your mother’s last words, Lady Long, you may secretly recite and sincerely seek the immortal’s aid — surely it will be granted.” As they spoke eagerly, they turned to see Feilong staring at the orb as if entranced, lost in thought. They nudged her, bringing her back to herself, and she laughed, “This is my own thing; no need to seek aid.”

Saying this, she reached a finger into one of the orb’s cracks. The hole immediately widened enough for a hand to enter. Feilong plunged her hand inside and pulled out a silver ingot. Another reach yielded plain mourning clothes, incense, candles, shoes, and hats — all the items needed for funeral rites. Aside from the coffin, which required silver to purchase, everything else was there. The neighbors marveled, saying, “From now on, Lady Long need not fear poverty. With such a rare treasure, building a royal palace will be easy.”

At this moment, Feilong had begun to awaken to the dao. Hearing such words, she felt no joy. She simply asked for help to quickly buy a coffin and bury her mother. The coffin was placed in the main hall, where she kept vigil day and night, offering meals and tears. After seven days, Feilong knelt before the spirit tablet and prayed: “Child will avenge mother, seeking the enemy. Mother’s shade is near; watch over your child.” Having prayed, she reached into the orb and drew forth a sharp blade. She left the house and hastened to the home of the classmate who had slandered her mother, declaring vengeance.

But that household was wealthy and, hearing of Xiuchun’s river casting and Feilong’s threats, had prepared in advance. They hired two brave warriors to follow Feilong closely, never leaving her side. When Feilong arrived, the warriors were instructed to confront her. Though Feilong had the root of immortality, she had never trained in martial arts; only her filial heart drove her forward. Against two warriors, she was no match. In brief combat, she was wounded twice. Fortunately, one warrior had a conscience and refused to strike with deadly force. Seeing her injured, he stopped his companion and said, “We are paid to ensure she is not harmed unfairly. This young lady is truly a wronged daughter; we must not injure her. To harm her would bring heavenly punishment.” He then gently persuaded Feilong, concealed the matter from his master, and sent her home with a package of medicine.

When the master learned of this, he scolded the warriors and dismissed them, hiring others to guard the house. Feilong returned home and fell upon the coffin, weeping a full day and night. Exhausted and faint, she collapsed beside the coffin as if entering a dream. Suddenly, a voice called in the room: “Hu Feilong, your master has arrived; rise to receive the dharma carriage.” Feilong, thinking of seeking a famed teacher to learn martial arts for her next attempt, opened her eyes in haste. The room was filled with incense smoke, and four boys, eight attendants in blue, and sixteen yellow-turbaned warriors stood about. Heavenly music played, melodious and stirring. A crowd surrounded an immortal, who held a precious sword, standing upon a lotus, radiating solemn majesty.

Feilong suddenly recalled she had seen this immortal before but could not remember where. Regardless, she prostrated herself, crawling to the immortal’s feet, bowing until blood flowed, weeping aloud: “Immortal Master, save me! Master, save me!” The immortal bade her rise with a smile and asked, “Where have you seen me? Can you recall?” Feilong pondered long but could not answer.

The immortal sighed softly: “So soon parted, and yet such demonic obstruction.” Then he commanded a boy to bring a small round mirror and told Feilong to look into it herself. Feilong bowed low, trembling, and took the mirror. As she gazed, scenes unfolded: the shipwreck at Qili Pond, people, animals, and goods sinking, only a bamboo rope remaining; the cultivation to become a dragon; the fire dragon immortal sending her to be reborn; transforming into a daoist maiden midwife; the removal of the small pearl from her mouth — all appeared clearly.

After viewing the mirror, Feilong was enlightened and bowed repeatedly. The immortal spat out an object, commanding, “Still coveting this trifle? Take it back.” Feilong saw a bright, round pearl, as large as a green bean, a most excellent spirit pearl. Understanding it was the elixir she had cultivated in a past life, she hastily took it in her hand and swallowed it with a “wah” sound.

The immortal instructed, “Go see if your stubborn shell is still there.” Feilong entered and found, strangely, the large orb was gone. She came out and reported this, still lost in thought. The immortal scolded, “Now that you have the real, why cling to the false?” Feilong’s heart cleared completely. The immortal rejoiced and said, “From now on, your work is complete. Between the human and immortal realms, roam freely. Soon, the Jade Emperor will decree your marriage to the old dragon of the West, and together you will bear children, ruling the four seas. I fear your magical arts are too few, and you may invite ridicule from other immortals. Therefore, I now teach you the Five Phases escape method, the thirty-six transformations, and the arts of summoning spirits, dispatching generals, and commanding ghosts and demons. You will enter the underworld and return, ascend heaven and earth, travel the four great continents, visit the three mountains and five peaks, roaming at will without hindrance. When you receive the decree, I will lead you to pay respects to the Jade Emperor, the Primordial Lord, the great Jin Immortals, and your master’s uncle, the Mysterious Immortal — the old dragon’s teacher. He now teaches the old dragon many arts. In the future, you two will be spouses. If your skills are lacking, you will not be worthy of him, and I will lose face before your uncle. You must practice diligently, with heart, so as not to disappoint my efforts and hopes.”

Feilong bowed again, saying, “Disciple receives the grace of master and Heaven and Earth, the virtue of rebirth. How dare I not practice with heart and repay master’s kindness!” The Fire Dragon Immortal laughed, “Now you understand, that is well. Our meeting is fate, not about gratitude or repayment. In sum, if you can love yourself, you love me. The greatest way to love me is to love yourself, to respect yourself. If you grasp this, I have no worries.” Feilong kowtowed and accepted the teaching. The immortal sat, closed his eyes, and fell silent; the attendants were likewise still.

That night, within a hundred li, every household saw five-colored clouds descending from the sky into the Hu family home, accompanied by a strange fragrance that filled the nostrils, refreshing the spirit and invigorating the mind.

Nearby villagers already knew the Hu child was an immortal descended to earth, and many marvelous tales circulated, causing little surprise. Only distant households, unrelated, were amazed and whispered among themselves. Some enthusiasts traveled far to witness the scene. Devotees of immortals and seekers of the dao believed that such auspicious clouds and light could only come from a divine presence and came to seek salvation. Overnight, hundreds gathered from all directions, making a ruckus until nearly the fifth watch, each witnessing the colored clouds and fragrance issuing from the Hu residence, peering through door cracks, even climbing high branches to glimpse inside.

Most curious was that each person saw something different. Some claimed to see the immortal master lecturing, disciples seated listening to scripture; others said the room was silent, but the courtyard patrolled by lions, elephants, tigers, and leopards; others still saw a great dragon crouching at the immortal’s feet, receiving teachings. All these accounts were true, but each person’s root and fate differed, so their visions varied in proximity and detail.

To learn what magic the immortal worked that night, and how Feilong was instructed, we shall await the next chapter’s unfolding.
