# Chapter Five: The Dragon of Qiantang River Roams Ancient Sites — A Disciple from the Eastern Coast Seeks the Master

Now it happened that the True Man Fire Dragon was the eldest disciple of the Patriarch Laozi, a foremost among the great Luo Golden Immortals of the upper realms. This time, he had come specifically to teach and redeem the dragon, to settle an old karmic bond. Thus, unlike the previous times he descended to the mortal world, when he appeared alone and solitary—sometimes revealing his true form, sometimes taking human shape—coming and going at ease without leaving a trace, this time he brought along attendant celestial officers. He summoned lions, elephants, tigers, and leopards, and called upon the local mountain gods and earth officials to serve as guardians. The Kitchen God and Door Gods of his own household were set to run errands. Truly, the scene was majestic, the divine presence solemn and dignified.

First, he revealed the origins of the flying dragon. At the midnight hour, he began imparting to the flying dragon many daoist arts, instructing her to seek vengeance, but only to harm the body, never to kill the person.

When the matter was done, he departed to the Eastern Sea to practice immortal arts, awaiting the arrival of the Old Dragon from the West, so they might together respond to the summons of Heaven. The True Man remained until the fifth watch was nearly over, then stepped lightly upon a lotus, rising gently amid colorful clouds and melodious immortal music, surrounded by celestial officers and officials, all ascending together into the midair. Behind them followed a great dragon, baring fangs and brandishing claws, swaying its tail and shaking its head, closely trailing as if to escort him respectfully. Only when the True Man’s divine carriage vanished into the distance and the clouds dispersed did that dragon fly back to the Hu household. This was the original form of Hu Feilong.

Since the flying dragon had swallowed the elixir of her own body, she was not only immensely strong but could transform at will between dragon and human forms, becoming immortal and divine. From that time on, beginning with this respectful escort of the True Man, she had appeared in her original form several times, so the local people were familiar with her and knew she was originally the Hu family girl. Thus, the place where the Hu family lived was named Longyou—Dragon’s Roam. Even today it is called Longyou County, all tracing back to this origin.

After receiving the immortal teachings from the True Man, the flying dragon, who was originally endowed with an excellent innate root and extraordinary intelligence, quickly mastered all the formulas and incantations, remembering them clearly and completely. When the True Man departed, fearing forgetfulness over time, she quietly recited the teachings at home for several days. Confident she would not forget, she then prepared to settle unfinished worldly affairs.

The first was her birth mother, who, due to the insult of a frivolous schoolmate, had taken her own life to express her resolve. This grudge must be avenged. Since the immortal had permitted injury to the body, this matter could be addressed first. At this time, the flying dragon was no longer the weak and helpless child of three days past. Never mind that the household had only a few martial men guarding the gates; even if they summoned tens of thousands of troops, they were nothing in her eyes. Yet she did not wish to cause a scandal in the world. Still appearing as a child, she went to that household to demand justice. Two armed men were struck down by her three punches and two kicks, noses broken, mouths distorted, unable to rise. As she prepared to storm inside, many family members appeared, each holding sticks, knives, and spears, surrounding the flying dragon tightly.

The flying dragon laughed aloud. Suddenly she saw that schoolmate timidly following a Daoist, shrinking back as they came out. It turned out they had recently learned of the Hu family’s descent of an immortal and feared that the flying dragon, having learned daoist arts, might come after them again—something no mere brute force could resist. So they had hired a Daoist in the city through a friend. This Daoist was said to be a carefree wandering immortal, calling himself the Unfoolish Daoist. Many commoners, seeing his strange manifestations, revered him as a Great Immortal. The Great Immortal accepted their invitation, thinking the Hu family were ordinary folk, unworthy of summoning a celestial immortal. He did not believe the Hu family girl was truly a dragon incarnate, suspecting some demon in disguise to fool the rural simpletons. So he came without concern to exorcise the demon.

When the flying dragon felled the two guards, the Daoist arrived. The whole family was delighted and urged him to come see if this flying dragon was truly a dragon incarnate. The Daoist gladly agreed, pulling the schoolmate out to the front hall. There they saw a delicate, refined young girl swaggering and showing off her might, striking down the family with empty fists and bare hands, driving them into desperation, crying out in pain and to Heaven.

The Daoist frowned, sizing up the flying dragon’s skill. He decided to strike first. Muttering incantations, he shouted sharply, and suddenly a thunderbolt flashed in midair. Seven or eight small dragons darted straight at the flying dragon. The flying dragon had never fought before, nor used any daoist magic. Caught unprepared, she could not even use the escape arts taught by her master and was knocked to the ground by the seven or eight small dragons.

The Daoist rejoiced, then raised a pellet in his hand, shouting, “Treasure, strike her head swiftly!” No sooner had he spoken than a black light shot toward the flying dragon’s head. Though she fell, her mind was clear. Seeing the black light coming, she panicked and suddenly the mud pellet leapt from her mouth, and the dragon elixir surged forth, soaring straight into the sky.

Instantly, Heaven darkened and Earth blackened, thunder roared and winds howled. In the darkness, ten thousand beams of golden light dazzled the eyes. It was the dragon elixir drawing out her true form. The storm of wind and thunder arrived, the world dimmed. Those dazzling golden lights were the scales on her body. Her true form appeared—not as a small black mist dissolving into a wisp of blue smoke, but even the seven or eight small dragons were frightened and revealed their true nature: mere rotten grass ropes.

At this moment, the flying dragon’s mind was fully clear, her expression calm. Seeing those grass ropes, she laughed until her dragon body trembled, thinking, “The Daoist has a leader, and the dragon has a patriarch, yet he does not know that even rotten grass ropes have disciples and descendants. He brought these things to scare me, a mere dragon made of woven strips—truly, he is too arrogant!” Little did she know that this laughter and trembling would bring great calamity.

Her true form was originally immense. Though her divine power could enlarge or shrink it at will, she was unaccustomed to the arts and in haste failed to be cautious, unknowingly revealing her entire dragon body. Even if the house were larger, it would not suffice for a single movement or flick. Luckily, she was in the courtyard and could leap most of her body upwards, causing little harm at first. But when she laughed and her whole body trembled and danced, disaster struck.

With a crash and rumble, dozens of houses were smashed flat. She quickly retracted her tail, and with another roar, a hundred or so houses of her enemy’s family were reduced to rubble. Trees before and behind the houses, inside and outside the village, were toppled in great numbers. As for the people crushed beneath the ruins, one can imagine—they were pressed like meat paste, beyond recognition.

Only then did the flying dragon realize the great calamity she had wrought. She hurriedly withdrew the dragon elixir, returning to her child form. Looking back at the ground, she saw it was wet and glistening. Unbeknownst to her, it had become a vast pool of water, flowing gently eastward.

The flying dragon leapt into the air and cast her divine gaze all around, discovering that the water had connected to the Qiantang River, forming a small river bay. Later, the local people called this place Naolong Harbor—“Roaring Dragon Port”—and that was the origin of the name.

At that time, the flying dragon had no leisure to consider these matters further. She hurried away from the water, returning home, her spirit unsettled and heart trembling. Reflecting, she suddenly knelt before her mother’s coffin and wept bitterly. She thought, having met the immortal master, she could finally see a way out. Yet, a small negligence had caused such a great calamity, harming many innocent people. Her master was a great Luo Golden Immortal, able to foresee all things. When the time came to mete out punishment, how could she bear it?

After crying, she suddenly changed her mind: the grudge was avenged, the calamity caused, the guilt fixed. Regret and tears were useless. Her second great matter was her mother’s burial. This calamity had arisen because of her mother. Could she bear to let her mother’s coffin remain here forever, causing future disaster to herself? Who would then bury her mother?

Thinking thus, she sighed, “The unfortunate are always doomed to mishandle things. Since it is so, I will not meddle with other matters. I must first bury my mother properly, then obey my master’s orders and go to the Eastern Sea to await judgment.”

So she knelt again before the coffin, weeping and bowing. She did not trouble others, but recited the summoning formula, calling many heavenly soldiers and strongmen to carry the coffin to a high mountain. Since she was to go to the Eastern Sea, she placed the coffin facing east. She also asked the local mountain gods and earth officials for help. Within less than an hour, they had built a very tall tomb. They brought a hundred or so pine and cypress branches from elsewhere, surrounding the tomb densely and firmly, the terrain flourishing and grand. To this day, in the northwest of Longyou, there is a steep ridge called Feilong Mountain, named after this burial site of Xiuchun.

Now, the flying dragon, her mind filled with wild thoughts, seeing the great matters before her, resolved to obey her master’s command and go to the Eastern Sea. Yet, recalling the great calamity she had caused, though unintentional, she had never before in two lifetimes of cultivation from a mere woven strip to a dragon caused such havoc, with so many deaths and injuries. The fate of disaster or blessing, life or death, was uncertain. She could not help but feel sorrowful to part from her mother’s tomb.

Suddenly she thought: the Eastern Sea was only a few hundred li away, and she had been taught the earth-traveling arts by her master. After transforming into dragon form, she could no longer roam freely in the air. To avoid harming fields and houses and incurring Heaven’s punishment again, it would be better to travel underground to the sea. Wherever she passed, she could open a channel in the earth. Later, when visiting the tomb, she could come and go through the earth, unnoticed by people or ghosts, causing no scandal or harm. Was this not a marvelous plan?

Pleased with this thought, she tried to burrow underground. Then she reconsidered: she was familiar with the water, but the earth was governed by special local deities. To avoid offending their domain and causing trouble, she must first inform the various earth gods and seek their consent.

So she formed hand seals and recited incantations, summoning the mountain earth gods to explain her intent. The earth gods looked at each other with troubled expressions.

The flying dragon angrily said, “I only want to make one path. It does no harm. Why are you so heartless?”

The earth gods, seeing her anger, hastened to say, “Great Spirit, do not misunderstand us. It is because each place and land has thick or thin qi, strong or weak flavor, fertile or barren soil, loose or dense texture—all decreed by Heaven. The fortunate receive blessed land; the unfortunate must accept poorer soil. How could your piercing through the earth not blend good and bad land into one continuous vein? Then there would be no way to distinguish high from low. Worse still, it would upset the balance of good and evil, fortune and misfortune, disaster and blessing, all turned topsy-turvy, violating Heaven’s just reward and retribution. When the time comes for reckoning, we lowly spirits would be unable to bear the responsibility.”

The flying dragon heard reason in their words, every sentence true. Yet, eager to bury her mother, having devised this plan as perfect and flawless, she hesitated but then said, “What you say is not wrong. But I think good people receive blessings and evil people meet calamity—that is the law of retribution. How could my one passage cause such chaos? Even if the earth veins connect, my divine form passing through will surely leave hidden springs, making water easier for people to draw. Is that not a way to earn merit and offset guilt? My mind is set. If you can help, let us all contribute. If not, I will do it alone. I expect that in less than a day, the path will reach the great Eastern Sea.”

The earth gods pleaded again, but the flying dragon would not yield. She waved them off and began burrowing with all her might. Indeed, the arts of immortals are no ordinary skill. She transformed into a medium-sized divine form, entering the earth from the ridge above her mother’s tomb, proceeding with hand seals. First descending from high to low, then from west to east, in less than a day she had opened a channel in the earth, connecting straight to the Eastern Ocean.

The flying dragon was overjoyed. From then on, she submerged herself in the Eastern Sea, cultivating talismanic arts. Whenever she thought of her deceased mother, she would enter from the sea’s mouth, travel along the secret earth passage, and in no time reach the tomb. Later generations called this earth vein the Dragon Vein, opened by the flying dragon. Though it was sealed by the True Man Xu, the story passed down and became a classic. Today, those who study feng shui often speak of dragon veins and dragon heads, all stemming from this tale. In truth, the facts do not fully align, and it is but a fanciful explanation.

Returning to the flying dragon submerged in the Eastern Sea, cultivating and awaiting judgment, more than ten years passed without her master’s arrival or any news of punishment. Her heart was half anxious, half hopeful. Since entering the sea, she had faithfully followed the True Man Fire Dragon’s teachings, concentrating on her practice and never meddling in worldly affairs.

In the sea dwelled many sentient creatures. Some envied her and plotted to harm her, but lacking skill, several were overturned by her. Others sincerely admired her and wished to become her disciples to learn daoist virtues. The flying dragon always said her arts were not yet refined, and without her master’s permission, she dared not accept disciples. Eventually, people knew she was not easy to approach and did not pester her. The flying dragon lived in peace and quiet, focusing on her profound cultivation.

Because of her steadfast dedication, her progress was swift. In just over ten years, having practiced the great path and various arts given by the True Man Fire Dragon, she reached flawless mastery. Now her skill was such that only the Golden Immortals of Heaven might rival her. As for the earth immortals, wandering immortals, and demons and spirits of various mountains and caves, the highest among them could only keep pace with her.

She forged two long dragon whiskers into treasured swords, usually hidden inside her nostrils. When needed, they could extend or shorten at will, able to take the lives of humans or demons from a thousand li away. She also tempered the dragon elixir with the Samadhi True Fire, enabling her to emit fire, absorb water, swallow mist and raise clouds, and seize others’ magical treasures. Crystals and wondrous treasures were drawn to her like iron to a magnet.

Proud of these two treasures, she recalled her master’s words that her master uncle, the Mysterious True Man, also taught the Old Dragon in the West. That dragon was a male body. According to her master, she and that dragon might even be husband and wife. When they met, who would be superior? Having now cultivated daoist arts and forged powerful treasures, she trusted she would not disgrace her master. Yet she wondered why her master had not come. Had he learned of her disobedience and calamity? Did he reject her as a disciple? If so, even if she labored for hundreds of years, she could never join the ranks of immortals and receive imperial decree. To see that Western Old Dragon proudly looking down from the heavens, enjoying his moment of glory, would be shameful and infuriating—she might even die of anger.

After much thought, she grew anxious again. She planned to take human form and visit her master’s cave to inquire directly. But since her master had not summoned her before leaving, if she went and he arrived, would he not be angry at her for coming unbidden?

The flying dragon tossed and turned, unable to find a solution. One gloomy day, she suddenly thought: why not transform into a Daoist nun and stroll on shore? Perhaps she might hear news of her master and the Western Old Dragon. Better than brooding in the sea with no sign of release.

Having made up her mind, she leapt ashore and became a young Daoist nun, carrying a dust whisk and a treasured sword on her back, swaying as she walked into a bustling market. She saw the crowd pressing in, mostly merchants and country farmers buying goods. Having seen such scenes in Longyou, she paid little attention.

Following her feet, she soon reached the outskirts. It was late spring, and mountain flowers blazed red like fire, set against soft green grass and lush pines and cypresses. The scenery was truly delightful.

The flying dragon climbed a mountain and sat on a large rock, admiring the natural beauty. Suddenly, she saw two travelers below, one old and one young, walking one after the other. Their attire seemed otherworldly. The flying dragon could not help but focus. Her ears and eyes, already refined to the utmost, soon discerned that the old and young Daoists radiated divine light and moved with grace, clearly not ordinary worldly Daoists. Her heart filled with wonder.

Soon she heard the old Daoist instruct, “Disciple, you have reached Huaicheng. Wait there for me. I will meet with your master uncle and then come find you. Your temper is poor; you must endure in all things. Do not show your rough and wild nature. If you cause another great calamity, I will have no face to plead for you. The more calamities you cause, the deeper the tribulations. In future kalpas, you will suffer again and again. It is your own suffering, no one can bear it for you. Do you understand?”

The young one showed great respect, saying, “Master, please go assured. I will no longer cause trouble.”

The old Daoist smiled broadly. The flying dragon wished to see where he would go, but in the blink of an eye, only the young Daoist remained; the old Daoist’s form had vanished.

The flying dragon was startled. “This old Daoist’s skill and magic are no less than my master’s. Since fate has brought me to meet them, I must go up and make acquaintance. Perhaps they know news of my master.”

Hastily, she used the earth-shrinking art, arriving before the young Daoist in three steps. The young Daoist, seeing her sudden appearance, was not surprised and asked, “Where do you come from? How is it I have not seen you before?”

The flying dragon smiled, “What is there to wonder? Just now I saw your master, a truly high Daoist. I admire him greatly and came specially to ask after him, and to inquire your honorable surname and hometown.”

Having asked politely, she thought the young Daoist would surely befriend her. Yet he did not answer, only gazing her up and down so intently that she laughed and blurted, “Young sir, perhaps you do not often make friends, so you do not understand the ways of social intercourse.”

This remark made the young Daoist angry. He shouted, “You little demon! Have you no respect? I am ten, even a hundred times older than your great-grandmother and ancestors. How dare you call me ‘young sir’? I have restrained myself out of respect for my master’s precepts, but you are reckless and insolent, insulting me to my face! Let us see who is right and who is wrong!”

The flying dragon laughed so heartily she nearly fell.

What caused such laughter? That will be revealed in the next chapter.
