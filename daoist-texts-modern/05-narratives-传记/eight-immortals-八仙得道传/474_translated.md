# Chapter Six: The Two Dragons Contend for the Pearl, Stirring the Upper Realm; The Jade Emperor Seeks Worthy Aid

Now it happened that the flying dragon, upon seeing the Daoist youth no more than a dozen years old, called out to him, “Young brother,” believing himself exceedingly courteous. Yet, this only roused the Daoist youth’s anger, who retorted that the dragon’s claim to be his ancestral forebear was utterly absurd. This caught the flying dragon off guard for a moment, then he burst into laughter and said, “Young brother, you speak as if on my behalf—that is indeed true! Look at me; am I not worthy to be your great ancestral elder? Ha ha, this is truly laughable beyond measure!” The flying dragon’s words meant that he had cultivated from mere rush ropes into human form, then transformed into dragon body over at least two thousand years—indeed, compared to ordinary humans, that was easily seventeen or eighteen generations longer. Yet the Daoist youth was far from convinced and, like the dragon, could not help but roar with laughter. He said, “In all the world, there truly are such arrogant maidens who know neither age nor propriety! Stay where you are—take this spear and test your ancestral treasure!” Before he finished speaking, he had already drawn his spear and thrust it straight at the flying dragon’s face. Seeing the youth attack, the flying dragon could not yield and drew his sword to meet the assault.

By the foot of the mountain, beside the main road, the two engaged in fierce combat. At the very first clash, each sensed the weight behind the other’s weapon and were greatly startled, no longer daring to underestimate their opponent. Both exerted their full strength, stabbing and striking with all their might. Blow met counterblow, and after more than twenty exchanges, the Daoist youth’s spirit flared. With a leap, he soared into midair and shouted, “Behold, young demon, witness your ancestor’s treasure!” The flying dragon looked up to see a red pearl rolling swiftly in the air.

In an instant, myriad beams of red light surged forth, enveloping the flying dragon’s entire body within a glowing crimson sphere. The dragon felt as though his whole being was ablaze with fire. The heat intensified beyond endurance, and in anger he roared, “You brat, how dare you vex your ancestral elder! You have a treasure—do others not have treasures as well?” As he shouted, he spat forth a pearl from his mouth, instantly filling the sky with golden light. The golden and red lights clashed fiercely, weaving and flashing across the heavens in a dazzling dance.

Though it was midday, the fierce sunlight was completely obscured by the two battling lights. Many common folk, frightened and suspicious, shuttered their doors and hid indoors, afraid to show their faces. The flying dragon and Daoist youth struggled for nearly an hour without yielding. Neither knew what the red pearl truly was, yet it possessed the same power as the dragon’s own elixir. The flying dragon thought, “Perhaps I should use a spell to seize that pearl. If I can remove the Daoist youth, and gain a matching pearl for my own dragon elixir, that would be quite amusing.” With this in mind, he silently recited a true incantation and beckoned the red pearl with his hand. As if responding to the spell, the pearl flew into his grasp, and the red glow gradually faded. The flying dragon rejoiced, only to suddenly realize that the golden light he had emitted had also dwindled to a faint wisp, nearly vanishing. Alarmed, he looked up and saw that his own dragon elixir had fallen into the Daoist youth’s hand. It was as if the two had exchanged pearls. Though no victor emerged, each’s treasure now belonged to the other, and neither could wield the other’s power. These treasures were forged from their very essence—spirit, vitality, and soul—so that man and elixir were one, capable of changing size and obeying command. Transferred to another, such efficacy was impossible. Both were filled with regret.

The Daoist youth was the first to lose his temper again. He transformed his form, becoming a great dragon whose head and tail stretched over thirty li. His two black eyes fixed fiercely on the flying dragon as he opened a blood-red maw and lunged forward. The flying dragon then saw that the Daoist youth was truly a fellow cultivator. Twisting his body, he slipped from beside the Daoist youth and burrowed underground—he too was a vast true dragon. The two dragons met and circled each other, blotting out great swaths of the blue sky, causing it to flicker between light and shadow, as mists scattered and clouds fled. Terrified, the beings of the lower realms shuttered their doors, burned incense, and bowed their heads in worship. This fierce battle between the two dragons cost each their carefully cultivated great elixir. The world would later tell this tale as the “Two Dragons Contend for the Pearl.”

The two dragons fought bitterly for an entire day, neither willing to yield. Their battle rose ever higher, passing through the middle realm and nearing the heavens. At that moment, the Jade Emperor ascended his throne in the Lingxiao Palace, discussing celestial affairs with many immortal officials. Suddenly, he noticed the golden and red lights shooting straight into the sky and found it strange. Then the lights faded, replaced by a foul stench that offended the nose. Growing suspicious, he asked the assembled immortals, “What omen is this? Why is there such a foul smell? I am the lord of Heaven, ruler over the Three Realms and all true immortals—how can such demonic qi rise to the precious palace? You must swiftly investigate and report, so I may dispatch generals to punish this rebellion.” The Great White Metal Star, Li Chang Geng, stepped forward, bowed, and volunteered to investigate. The Jade Emperor consented.

Li Chang Geng, bearing the imperial decree, passed through the Southern Heavenly Gate and pushed aside the clouds to look down. He saw the two wicked dragons fiercely locked in combat, scales flying, armor shattered, heads bleeding. They seemed dazed and did not descend, but instead rose higher and higher, causing a ruckus all the way outside the Southern Heavenly Gate. Li Chang Geng drew his sword and shouted, “Wicked beasts, show some respect! Look where you are! How dare you rampage so! Withdraw at once!” The two dragons were startled and paused, seeing an old Daoist standing on the clouds, loudly scolding them. Having never been to the heavenly court before, though they glimpsed jade towers and palaces through the mists, they thought these were the abodes of some kings and were not greatly afraid. Hearing Li Chang Geng’s rude words, they grew angry and said, “Old servant, how dare you insult us? We fight among ourselves—what concern is it of yours? If you meddle, we will first deal with your donkey’s head, then settle our score!” Without waiting for Li Chang Geng’s reply, the two dragons flew toward the Southern Heavenly Gate. Li Chang Geng was frightened and fled back to the palace, reporting, “Two demon dragons from the lower realm are rebelling and have come to the palace! Your Majesty, please dispatch troops to defend!” The Jade Emperor was alarmed and said, “What demon dragons? I have never heard of such before. Who shall I send to quell this demon?” Before he finished speaking, a gust of wind blew through the hall as the two reckless dragons stormed in, shouting in unison, “Bring out the old man and spare your nation’s lives! If not, we will cast spells to drown your entire realm in moments!” The Jade Emperor panicked and said, “The demon dragons have arrived! Quickly summon the generals guarding the heavenly gates to block the entrance, and call my nephew Erlang to lead the heavenly soldiers to subdue them!” Li Chang Geng hurried to summon Erlang at Guankou. There, Generals Deng, Xin, Zhang, and Tao took up arms to confront the dragons. Enraged, the dragons unleashed their full power—headbutting the palace courtyard, tail striking the heavenly gate, twisting their bodies and flinging the four generals thousands of li away. The Jade Emperor and many officials hastily retreated to the rear hall. Suddenly, with a crash like heaven and earth collapsing, the dragons smashed a palace corner, causing it to collapse. Many precious artifacts from the Nine Continents and Four Seas were smashed to pieces. The two dragons shouted again, demanding the old man be brought forth to meet his death.

The Jade Emperor’s face darkened with fury. He declared, “I am the lord of Heaven, commander of the Three Realms and myriad immortals. Now these demon dragons rebel, daring to assault the precious palace and destroy its halls. Yet not one person shares my burden or aids me—how shameful and disgraceful!” His words left the attendant immortals flushed and speechless. Outside, the dragons raged ever more fiercely, attempting to enter the rear hall. Eight great immortals standing beside the Jade Emperor stepped forward into the front hall and called out, “You two dragons, where do you come from? How did you attain the dao? For what cause do you rebel against the heavenly court? Explain yourselves! Know that this is the Tongming Hall, the Jade Emperor’s seat—how dare you act so recklessly? The Jade Emperor decrees that if you repent and submit, your offenses may be forgiven. But if you persist in arrogance and delusion, when the heavenly soldiers arrive, your bones will be ashes—wasting your cultivation of a thousand years!”

Hearing this, the two dragons realized they had caused great trouble in the heavenly court. Helpless, they spoke human words and recounted how the quarrel began and their fierce battle. They bore resentment toward the old brother who had insulted them without cause, and so united their strength to capture him and sink him in the Eastern Sea to feed the fish and shrimp. They did not know that the old Daoist had entered this place and never emerged, which angered them and caused the uproar. Now aware of their guilt, they dared not act rashly again and begged the great immortals to intercede with the Jade Emperor for pardon of their ignorance. Yet they refused to reveal their origins, cultivation years, or place of secret practice. The immortals, hearing this, relaxed and reported back to the Jade Emperor. The Jade Emperor said, “All who cultivate the dao have masters. Who are these two beasts’ masters? Go ask and find out! I shall summon their masters to punish them accordingly.” When the eight immortals returned with this message, the two dragons, knowing they had offended Heaven, fled to the lower realm.

The Jade Emperor again left the hall and summoned officials to discuss aftermath and pursuit. Li Chang Geng arrived with Guankou Erlang, leading all the troops to obey orders. He reported, “Under my jurisdiction, there is an old dragon turned demon. Recently it used sorcery to move a mountain of earth, pressing down the sea at Guankou, turning water to land and seizing the power of creation. We planned to send troops to capture it, but it escaped. Now we have a clear edict to arrest the demon dragon—perhaps this is the same demon at Guankou!” The Jade Emperor was comforted by this news and ordered his heavenly soldiers to descend and suppress the rebellion. Erlang set off at once. Seeing the collapsed palace corner, crooked pillars, and many treasures of the Nine Continents and Four Seas ruined by the dragons, the Jade Emperor was displeased. He asked Li Chang Geng, “I am lord of the myriad heavens and leader of all immortals. The heavenly court is filled with talents skilled in magic—how could these two demons run rampant as if no one was here? Are all the celestial officials unable to catch two small demons? If this continues, any creature in the lower realm with some skill will run wild, lawless. What if one day even my Tongming Hall is destroyed by demons and devils, leaving not a tile standing? What use would I be as the famed Jade Emperor? Tell me, what can be done to keep the celestial palace pure and the heavenly court peaceful? Speak freely and openly.”

Li Chang Geng stepped forward and said, “Long rule breeds chaos; chaos births calamity. Order, disorder, safety, and danger all follow fixed patterns. Previously, at the Eight Scenic Palace, I heard the Old Lord and Primordial Lord discuss kalpas. They said that this year, at Tongming Hall, a minor disaster would occur. I thought the Jade Emperor, leader of all immortals and master of fate, would be beyond such troubles, and so I laughed at the words of those two immortals, doubting their truth. Yet now this demon dragon disaster has come to pass, confirming their prophecy. This shows that even the great saints and immortals, knowing the cause, cannot avoid fate. I also heard the Old Lord foretell a great flood in the lower realm, drowning billions of beings. Fortunately, a destined sage has already been born among mortals and will soon assume the role of holy ruler, acting as prime minister to manage the waters. Then the boundaries between water and land will be redrawn. Land will be governed by human rulers, while the waters require two dragon gods skilled and talented enough to control them. I have already sent his great disciples, Fire Dragon and Mysterious True Immortal, to subdue these two true dragons, hiding beneath the waters awaiting summons.” He continued, “The two dragons are male and female, destined as mates who will bear dragon offspring, becoming lords of the seas east, south, west, and north, great and small, inside and out, assisting human rulers and answering Heaven’s command to keep the four seas peaceful. Demons will hide, and fish and insects will thrive. This is a matter of great importance. Could it be that these two strange beasts possess such power for this very reason? If ordinary dragons had no cultivation, none could reach the middle or upper realms. I think to understand this matter fully, one must consult the Old Lord Patriarch, who surely knows the truth.” The Jade Emperor said, “Though this is so, these two dragons, having been subdued by the Old Lord’s disciples and appointed to govern the waters, should be cautious and ready to answer summons. How dare they act so recklessly? Even if fate is fixed, these two dragons bear great guilt—how can they be retained? Would this not make the immortals laugh at my lack of justice?” Li Chang Geng replied, “The Old Lord is the ancestor of all immortals, and Fire Dragon and Mysterious True Immortal are golden immortals of the upper realm. They surely understand the cause and effect here. I shall go ask and report back.” The Jade Emperor approved and ordered him to go quickly.

He added, “Order and disorder, safety and danger, though tied to fate, ultimately depend on appointing worthy talents—this is the emperor’s responsibility. I see that my ministers lack adaptability. From now on, I plan to cultivate talents and appoint the worthy. You shall ask the Old Lord if there are immortals of such virtue and talent to recommend, so that when the time comes and no suitable person is found, we may know how to nurture and train them. Please have him instruct carefully.” Li Chang Geng took his orders and left the palace, riding the clouds to the Eight Scenic Palace. Descending through the cloud tops, he saw a palace unlike Tongming Hall—quiet and solemn beyond measure. Strange flowers and exotic birds abounded outside, a wondrous sight. Yet Li Chang Geng, bearing the imperial decree, dared not linger, hastening step by step to the palace gate.

There, a white crane youth greeted him with a smile: “The Patriarch knew you would come, old Daoist!” Li Chang Geng scolded, “You brat, show some respect! Go quickly and announce that I request an audience with the Patriarch!” The youth, hearing the insult, turned and laughed, “You shameless old thing! You insulted me first, and now you suffer for it. You run east and west, nearly causing trouble for the Jade Emperor, who just found some peace. Now you dare come here and insult me! Fine! If you have the face, go in yourself and see the Patriarch—you don’t need me to announce you!” Saying this, he sat cross-legged on a rock, whistled, and a hundred birds of every color—red, green, black, white, great and small, male and female—flew down in a great flock, surrounding him in a wide circle. When the youth moved, the birds followed him in flight. The youth amused himself and ignored Li Chang Geng.

Li Chang Geng watched for a while and laughed, “See how unreasonable this child is! Now when I need him most, I must pay him a courtesy. When I return to see the Patriarch, I will speak with him again.” He stepped forward, smiling apologetically, “Brother, joking aside, I came for a serious matter. Do you know I come by imperial order? If I fail, I suffer, and the Patriarch’s face will be lost. Good brother, please announce my visit—stop teasing me.” The youth spat and said, “Don’t scare me with your Jade Emperor. I only know the Patriarch here. No matter how big your face is, to see the Patriarch you must owe me a favor! If I don’t announce you, even if the Jade Emperor came himself, you wouldn’t see the Patriarch, let alone you old man.” Li Chang Geng laughed, “You child, nonsense! If you delay, the Patriarch will scold you. But since I come seeking your help, I won’t waste time arguing. How about I apologize to you?” He bowed deeply. The youth laughed heartily, “I never saw someone so useless—scared so easily. Seeing you’re pitiful, I’ll announce you this once!” He stood, waved his hand, and the birds scattered. Then he leapt and bounded inside.

After a while, he came out and beckoned Li Chang Geng, “Old man, the Patriarch bids you enter!” Li Chang Geng straightened his robes and respectfully followed the youth inside. Meeting the Old Lord, he bowed deeply. The Old Lord bade him rise and smiled, “You came to inquire about the two demon dragons?” Li Chang Geng bowed and conveyed the Jade Emperor’s decree. The Old Lord smiled again, “Those two demon dragons were sent by me to be subdued. They first gained human form and were enrolled among the immortals by my special favor. Yet their wild natures were untamed, their manners unlearned, and having not entered the heavenly court, they did not know what the Lingxiao Palace was. By chance, your words provoked their anger, causing this great calamity. Still, it was predestined. The Jade Emperor must endure some vexation and false alarm at this time—a minor kalpa. The matter is past and need not be dwelled upon. Now is the time to use their talents for merit. For now, let them be. As for their sins, they will face retribution in due course. It is not the time to speak of it now. You may return and report to the Jade Emperor.”

Li Chang Geng further asked why, when the two dragons caused such trouble, no immortals in the heavenly court subdued them, causing the Jade Emperor displeasure and plans to request assistance from the Patriarch’s virtuous immortals. The Old Lord laughed, “My disciples each have their duties and are unrelated to the Jade Emperor’s administration. Yet the Jade Emperor’s court lacks men of virtue and talent. I have already calculated that within three thousand years, eight great golden immortals will be gathered, some already born but not yet fully human. Over time, I will send people to subdue and perfect them. You must obey my commands at all times, whether in the heavenly court or the mortal realm, assisting them to attain the dao. This will be your great merit.” Li Chang Geng bowed in thanks, took leave of the Old Lord, and returned to the heavenly palace to report.

What happened next remains to be told—see the next chapter for the unfolding tale.
