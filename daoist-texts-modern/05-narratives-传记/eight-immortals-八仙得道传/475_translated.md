# Chapter Seven: On the Matter of a Renowned Master Saving a Worthy Disciple — Recounting the Past When a Mouse Transformed into a Bat

Now it happened that the Erlang God led forth many heavenly soldiers and generals, pursuing two dragons. Passing through the Upper and Middle Realms, they pressed on all the way to the Lower Realm. Fixing his gaze upon the clouds, he opened his discerning eye and glanced downward, only to see the two dragons already entering the Eastern Sea, just about to hide beneath the water’s surface. Erlang God hastily cast a Water-Settling Spell, pointing downward; the sea’s waters congealed like bronze cast in iron. The two dragons could not dive beneath the waves. Raising their heads, they recognized the divine power wielded by this godly general.

Furious, the two dragons simultaneously revealed their human forms, brandishing treasured swords, soaring into the air to strike at Erlang. Erlang, unhurried and composed, unfolded his painted halberd, matching their strength. After twenty rounds of fierce combat, the two dragons gradually faltered. The flying dragon first revealed its original form and fled eastward, the other dragon following close behind.

Erlang was not willing to let them go. Leading his troops, he bitterly pursued. Seeing they were not far ahead, Erlang drew two divine bullets from his sleeve, holding one in each hand, and flung them at the two dragons. Calling out “Hit!” two golden beams struck the dragons’ heads. With a thunderous boom, both dragon heads were struck hard. Sparks flew, their heads throbbed with pain, and they nearly fell from the clouds.

Erlang marveled, “My divine bullets, whether striking demons or men, never fail to kill upon impact. How can these two dragons endure my shot? It must be that their cultivation is deep, their dao advanced. So now I shall simply use my flying sword to sever them and see how they can withstand that!” With this thought, he opened his mouth wide, and suddenly a white light shot forth toward the dragons’ heads, chilling winds howling fiercely. The light’s arrival made the dragons shiver, and it seemed they could hardly endure this blow.

But before the sword light reached them, there came a great roar. Suddenly, the sky was filled with a layer of red radiance, forcing Erlang’s sword light back more than twenty li. From within the red glow came a voice shouting, “Erlang, hold back! These two beasts have violated Heaven’s laws and will surely face retribution in time. Yet now they have their uses. Erlang, please do not trouble yourself.” Before the words finished, two immortals stood firmly before Erlang.

Erlang hastily withdrew his sword light, raising his hands in salute: “Immortals Fire Dragon and Piaomiao, whence do you come? How is it that these two beasts should not perish today?”

Fire Dragon Immortal laughed: “Those who speak of right and wrong are themselves the arbiters of right and wrong. Erlang, do you not know that we have great ties with these two beasts? Brother Piaomiao has already traveled back and forth several times to Guankou on your behalf because of those wicked creatures.”

Erlang suddenly understood: “Oh! These beasts are the demon dragons from Guankou, are they not? I heard some immortal once saved one of them from death — could it be Brother Piaomiao? You two are meddlesome indeed. Do you know of their mountain-moving and sea-filling deeds in our domain? Do you know how they caused havoc in the Heavenly Palace, stirring the Jade Emperor’s wrath? Now that the Jade Emperor is furious and has sent me to capture and punish them, how can you plead for them?”

Piaomiao and Fire Dragon both laughed: “Though these two beasts are bold, they have never ascended to the heavenly court and know not the path of enlightenment. We know well it was Li Chang Geng who caused this disaster! The sanctity of the spiritual realm cannot tolerate such insolent beasts. Yet, first, it is fate ordained; second, retribution will come in time. There is no need for more words now. In any case, all matters are decided by our venerable Patriarch. Even the Jade Emperor must yield to his explanations and will not cause trouble for the honored gods.”

Erlang said again, “Moreover, they have filled in much of our sea, which concerns the people’s food supply and is vital for regulation. Losing so much water has harmed many people.”

Piaomiao Immortal smiled: “That is easier to remedy. Soon there will be a great flood in the Lower Realm. The Water Regulation Sage will appear, and I shall surely invite him to deepen the remaining sea, doubling its depth to compensate for the shallows. The land filled in can become farmland, which is not without benefit.”

Erlang laughed: “If so, I will withdraw my troops and return to Heaven to report. Brothers, you and the Patriarch must keep your word, lest I suffer unjustly!”

The two immortals laughed: “What nonsense! Does the Patriarch think we disciples so unreliable?”

Erlang laughed heartily and withdrew his troops.

The two immortals descended from the clouds and exchanged smiles: “With these two monsters, our responsibility has doubled.”

Fire Dragon Immortal said: “My disciple is not so bad; her temper is not too violent. After all, females are better than males. But I ask you, since you brought the disciple to the Eastern Sea, why did you not wait quietly for me to come, to join their yin and yang and send them into the sea? Why did you leave her by the shore, causing the two beasts not to recognize each other and stirring up such trouble? Brother, this is your responsibility!”

Piaomiao Immortal laughed: “Brother, you are heartless! I went to see you out of kindness and also to inform you of your disciple’s misbehavior in the Qiantang River, violating the master’s instructions. And yet you blame me!”

Fire Dragon Immortal laughed again: “Well said! You cannot even manage your own disciple, causing such a commotion in Guantian, and yet you have time to watch over my affairs!”

Piaomiao sighed: “Speaking of this matter, it is truly pitiable. My disciple is a mixture of human spirit and dragon essence, with a straightforward nature and deep filial piety. Once we met in the western clouds, and I had already confined her beneath the sea to cultivate her practice. Yet her filial heart remained strong. Every year on her mother’s birthday, she would transform into a human and go to offer birthday respects. After her mother’s death, she went to mourn and buried her mother’s body at the southwestern foot of Guankou Mountain, visiting the grave regularly during festivals. This was her filial devotion. I knew she left the sea bottom but could not bear to scold her. Yet soon she caused a great calamity. Brother, since you say my disciple caused trouble in Guankou, you must know the details?”

Fire Dragon Immortal shook his head, smiling: “I have only heard vague reports and do not know the full story. Why not tell me about it?”

Piaomiao sighed again: “By fate, the troubles at Guankou and those in Qiantang River are predestined. Since fate is fixed, even the Jade Emperor cannot control these two beasts’ unruliness! How much less can we, or others? Brother, have you not heard the Patriarch say that within three thousand years, eight great Golden Immortals will successively appear and attain the Dao, serving as ministers to the Jade Emperor? Among them is one who has already been born but not yet fully grown — a mouse unlike any ordinary mouse. Since its birth, it has never damaged human property, instead worshipping the stars and diligently cultivating. Though a small creature, it has attained an imperishable body, living four or five thousand years. During the reign of the Three Sovereigns, when floods devastated the land and countless people and animals were lost, this mouse was swept from the Central Plains to the Western lands, now the harbor region. Because of its long cultivation and firm dharma body, it survived the raging waves over thousands of li, preserving its life.”

“Guankou was once low-lying land. After the flood, waters gathered to form an inland sea stretching a thousand li. When the flood first arrived, a village of over two thousand souls, old and young, fled to higher ground. They came upon a place where two banks rose high, with a river over three zhang wide between. Normally deep, now it was impassable. Luckily, a single-log bridge spanned the river, allowing passage. But the crowd was large, and the bridge rotten. As they struggled to cross, the bridge snapped with a ‘crack!’ Many fell into the water and were swept away. The flood surged stronger, the danger grew, and cries of despair shook heaven and earth.”

“At that moment, the mouse was among the people, hoping to escape with them. Seeing the broken bridge and the cries, it was deeply moved and forgot its own peril, thinking only how to save many lives. After pondering, it devised a plan. Flying to the broken bridge, it found the bridge still partially intact, though submerged and impassable. The mouse, strong and careful, swam courageously, climbing the half-bridge, and reached the far shore. Turning back, it chirped comfortingly to the crowd, urging them not to despair, promising rescue.”

“The people were amazed to see such a large mouse cross the broken bridge. But desperate to survive, they paid it no mind. Hearing its calls, some wise elders shouted back, ‘Brother Mouse, congratulations on your escape! We are many, unable to cross. You have reached the far shore first; can you find a way to save us? If we live, we will build you a shrine and worship you with sincere thanks!’ Though they spoke half in jest, the mouse nodded repeatedly, fully understanding. The crowd grew more amazed, thinking, ‘This mouse surely has some dao. Since we are doomed anyway, let us watch what it does.’ The mouse nodded and flew off.”

“After a while, it returned dragging a long tree trunk in its teeth, laying it along the broken bridge. The crowd realized it truly came to rescue them and cheered, their voices echoing through the valley. But one log was not enough. The mouse nodded again, swam back, and fetched another log of similar length. The people worked together, securing the two logs to the old bridge pillars. The mouse used its mouth to bore two large holes on the far shore, inserting the logs firmly. Thus, a bridge of two logs was formed. One by one, the people crossed, taking several hours to complete.”

“Just then, the floodwaters surged again, with several great waves tossing the mouse about. It was swept hundreds of li away, struggling for breath. Being a small creature, exhausted and weak, it could barely hold on. Clutching a large branch, it climbed a tree top but soon grew dizzy, lost footing, and tumbled into a hundred-zhang deep pool. The mouse lost consciousness, seeming dead.”

“How long passed, no one knew. Suddenly, it found itself lying on a great rock, beside which stood a Daoist boy, smiling gently: ‘Beast, you have awakened! Have you not yet thanked your master?’ The mouse knew at once it had been saved by an immortal, brought from the deep waters to the high mountain. Hearing the boy’s words, it understood more and quickly bowed repeatedly. The boy beckoned, smiling: ‘Come with me to see your master!’ The mouse followed him along a path of several arrow shots to a mountain cavern, where an old immortal cultivated the Dao.”

“Entering, the mouse respectfully greeted the old immortal, feeling deeply grateful. Tears welled from its two mouse eyes. The immortal comforted it: ‘Though you are an unusual creature, you are specially endowed by Heaven with good roots and have cultivated great功. Therefore, I sent my servant to rescue you to the mountain. It has been one hundred and twenty-five days since you nearly drowned.’ Hearing this, the mouse stuck out its tongue.”

“The old immortal continued: ‘I pity you, having cultivated for thousands of years without attaining true fruition, unable even to transform your human form. This is because of your lowly origin and lack of affinity to see true immortals. Now you need not continue your life burrowing in the earth. Stay here in my cave as a guardian boy. Slowly you will receive true instructions and learn some法術, allowing you to transform your body and first become human. In one or two thousand years, you may change into an immortal body.’ The mouse accepted the charge, bowing a thousand times.”

“The old immortal laughed: ‘Since you serve here, you must also change your original form so your brothers will not look down on you. You have been in the water long and must be hungry. Boy, take him to the peach tree behind the mountain to pick two ripe peaches to satisfy his hunger. Then bring him back to me.’ The boy obeyed, leading him to many fruit trees, among which stood a large peach tree heavy with fruit. The boy smiled: ‘You are light; climb up and pick two bright red peaches to eat. Don’t be greedy or you’ll upset your stomach tomorrow, and I won’t be responsible.’”

“The mouse obeyed, climbing nimbly to the treetop, selecting two red, plump peaches and eating them. As it prepared to descend, it suddenly felt an itch along its ribs. Scratching left and right, the itch worsened unbearably. It felt as if something inside was trying to break out. Alarmed, the mouse hurried down to ask the boy. Suddenly, from the itchy spot sprouted two wings, flapping swiftly and lightly. Its whole strength seemed gathered in these wings. Clever as it was, the mouse realized the master was transforming its form and rejoiced. Testing the wings, it caught the air and floated lightly down, startling the boy.”

“The boy laughed: ‘You mouse, how have you changed into this form?’ Then he led the mouse back to the cave. The old immortal laughed heartily upon seeing the mouse transformed into a flying insect and renamed it ‘Bat.’”

Piaomiao Immortal finished the story, and Fire Dragon Immortal nodded, smiling: “I know something of this. Even now, among the mouse clan, those who have transformed into bats belong to that lineage.”

Piaomiao smiled: “So you know something after all. Since then, the bat has forever followed that old immortal, listening to the Dao and studying diligently. After six or seven hundred years, it could speak human words and transform into various flying insects and beasts, though it could not yet become human. Brother, do you know who that immortal is?”

Fire Dragon nodded: “I heard that Immortal Wenmei took a certain mouse as disciple. It must be him.”

Piaomiao laughed: “Who else? He is the foremost disciple of the Primordial One, fond of taking unusual creatures as disciples. He once caused many troubles for this reason, and our Patriarch had to admonish him several times. He has since been more cautious.”

Fire Dragon laughed: “We were just talking about your disciple causing trouble, and now you bring up some mouse and bat. Do these things have any connection to your disciple?”

Piaomiao said: “Of course they are connected. How could I be involved without cause? This is what the saying means by ‘things arise from following the footprints.’”

Fire Dragon said again: “You mentioned this little bat will have a great future. What exactly is that about? I do not know.”

Piaomiao replied: “Though we can know past and future, our sight rarely extends beyond one hundred years. Beyond that, predictions are uncertain. Only the Patriarch and the Primordial Heavenly Venerable can perceive the unpredictable future and the infinite past. He said that eight great immortals will assist the Jade Emperor, and we among them only help bring them forth and guide their cultivation. None of us will ascend to heavenly office. The earliest born is a little mouse whose lifespan surpasses ours, but it will take three to five thousand years to become a true immortal. By this, do you not see it must be that bat? This has long been known among the immortals, yet you alone do not know it — truly a great wonder.”

What Fire Dragon Immortal might have said next is unknown, as the story awaits unfolding in the next chapter.
