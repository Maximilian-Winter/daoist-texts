# Chapter Eight: The Old Flood Dragon Ascends the Shore and Destroys the Virtue; The Old Moon Descends to the Sea to Act as Dragon Matchmaker

Now it happened that the Fire Dragon Perfected One, upon hearing that the Bat was destined to become one of the Eight Immortals assisting the Jade Emperor, could not help but nod and say, “So that is the case—I truly did not know.” The Ethereal One smiled and said, “Now I shall tell you again about the old dragon’s mischief.”

It was said that the Bat, having received the teachings of Perfected Wenmei, was told that by his merits among the people of Guankou, he would receive their incense offerings for one thousand years. In time, he would be able to transform early into a human form, with a bright future ahead. Wenmei also summoned the local earth deities of Guankou, instructing them to proclaim to the people there that they should build a temple to honor and worship the Bat, thereby expressing their reverence and repaying his merit, while also fulfilling a good cause and effect.

The people of Guankou, upon receiving the earth deities’ instructions, indeed responded with enthusiasm. Every household eagerly helped erect a temple for the Bat. Though the site was small, its structure was solemn and dignified. Moreover, since the temple was built by the command of the earth deities, the people held the Bat in exceptional respect, calling him the “Righteous God of Virtue and Blessing.” This was because the words for “blessing” and “bat” sounded alike, allowing them both to show reverence and to hope for continual blessings. Later, throughout the thousand-li expanse around Guankou, whenever there was a joyous occasion or a festival, every household would hang a scroll depicting five or nine bats, symbolizing the wish to receive abundant blessings.

It was said that although this creature was small, it was quite numinous and efficacious. Those who sincerely worshipped it could witness some form of retribution or reward. Thus, the incense offerings in the temple grew prosperous. The Bat, having long received the earthly incense smoke, even learned to transform into human form and appeared in the countryside, though only for brief periods—sometimes seven days, sometimes ten—before reverting to his original shape. He was a cautious and diligent being, usually not daring to leave the temple lightly, fearing to stir trouble and incur the wrath of the heavenly gods.

Yet fate was fixed; those destined for calamity could not escape. The Bat, unaware of how, suddenly became acquainted with this humble disciple—myself. We were all men of principle and virtue, naturally becoming very close and intimate. Every time the old dragon came ashore to pay respects at his mother’s grave, he would visit the Bat’s temple to converse. Though the Bat could not venture into the water, he sometimes took human form and went alone to the seashore, calling out the name “Pinghe” (Peaceful Harmony). The old dragon would then come out and play with him. Their friendship was exceedingly intimate.

This was ordinarily a trivial matter, nothing of great consequence. But unknown to them, another flood dragon in the sea, though having cultivated fewer years than the old dragon, had mastered sorcery no less formidable. Hearing that his junior brother had gone to convert the old dragon and soon succeeded, he was filled with resentment.

One day, having transformed into human form, he passed by the Bat’s temple and entered to take a look. Inside, he saw only a great soaring bird statue. Not knowing its origin, he mistakenly thought it was the peacock atop the Western Buddha’s head and hurriedly bowed. Upon asking the locals, he learned it was a bat transformed from a mouse. Hearing the reason for the temple’s establishment, he was nearly enraged to death. Immediately, he formed hand seals and summoned many local earth deities, calling them together to question:

“Why do you make such a tiny insect into such a grand figure, receiving incense offerings from the people? Today I mistook it for the peacock on the Buddha’s head and even bowed deeply to it. How intolerable that beast dares to sit so high and grandly, without even a word of courtesy! This is utterly detestable. I, the old flood dragon, share longevity with Heaven and Earth, having cultivated the supreme dao. Except for my Erlang God and the few immortals and Buddhas I revere, when have I ever spoken soft words to those lowly gods? Yet today I suffer loss before this little beast. This will not do! To make a long story short, I order you all to tear down this temple within three days, drive this little beast beyond the borders, and end all matters. Should you dare disobey, I will first break your legs, then set fire to burn down that mouse’s nest!”

The earth deities, seeing the old flood dragon so enraged and knowing the Bat’s backing was not insignificant, found themselves caught between two fires. They exchanged glances and could not respond. The old dragon roared, “You say nothing? Do you think my dao power is less than a tiny mouse? Are you afraid of a mouse but not of me? Fine! Since you so lightly esteem me, I have no choice but to disregard you.”

As he spoke, he drew a three-pointed, double-edged blade forged from his own beard hairs. The moment it left its sheath, ten thousand rays of cold light shot forth, piercing faces. The old flood dragon brandished the blade with a fierce frown, clearly ready for battle. The earth deities trembled and shrank into a heap. They pleaded, “Great Lord, please calm your anger and allow us to explain.” The old dragon growled, “Speak quickly! Speak!”

Seeing the old dragon unreasonable, the earth deities conferred briefly. One, more clever than the rest, recalled that the dragon was king of the waters, commanding all water creatures. Hearing that the Bat and the Guankou old dragon were close friends, he suggested borrowing the old dragon’s prestige to intimidate him and see how he would respond. Smiling, he said:

“Great Lord, no need to show force. Surely the Bat is no match for you. The earth deities are also discontent under his command. But his master, Perfected Wenmei, is a powerful high immortal. Recently, he has been very close with the Guankou Dragon King, coming and going as intimate friends. The earth deities intended to obey orders to dismantle the temple and drive him back to the mountains. If Wenmei learns of this, and you stand as our protector, the earth deities will not speak of fear. However, the Guankou Dragon God is near at hand. Hearing that his friend suffers loss, he will surely come to help. As king of the water tribe, his power is greatest. If he grows angry and moves his dharma body, he can overturn seas and move mountains, making the yin and yang realms unsafe. Then the earth deities would indeed perish, and even you and the local people would suffer. What then?”

These words, meant to be smooth on the earth deities’ part, only stoked the old dragon’s fury. After hearing them, he shouted fiercely.

His roar was no small matter; even the high mountain of Guankou trembled. Terrified, the earth deities fled into the earth, not daring to show their heads. The old flood dragon no longer sought them out but, filled with rage, went straight to the temple and smashed the Bat’s statue into a shattered ruin. Then he tore the temple itself into rubble.

As fate would have it, at that moment the Bat had gone to the sea mouth to visit his good friend. Both had taken on Daoist forms, strolling leisurely amid flowers and trees on the shore, enjoying a carefree moment. Suddenly, the Bat shivered out of nowhere, then looked dizzy and faint. His body and mind shook uncomfortably. He said to the old dragon, “Senior Brother, I feel very unwell just now, as if my heart has leapt out of its cage. I am deeply uneasy. Could it be that something has happened in my little temple?”

The old dragon laughed and said, “Senior Brother, you are truly suspicious and timid. Not to mention your kind heart and great virtue, who among the local people does not sincerely worship you? Surely there are demons and ghosts jealous of you; who does not know our close friendship? In this region, who does not know my reputation? To offend you is to offend me; do you think I would let it pass? Perhaps the weather is unsettled, and you have caught some ill qi. We cultivators cannot even fully govern life and death, much less minor ailments. Wait a moment; surely it will pass. Senior Brother, do not be so anxious; it does not suit our Daoist spirit.”

The Bat replied, “I will not hide it from you, Dao Brother. I came to receive the incense offerings under my master’s name. My master personally instructed that the term would be no more than one thousand years. Now that time is nearly up, my heart has been restless these days, fearing some accident. I am not like worldly men who crave rank and wealth. Though the incense is abundant, I long to return to the mountain to follow my master and apply myself to life’s cultivation, hoping soon to transform into human form and attain the great Dao. These worldly vanities are of no concern. I only fear that after one thousand years of carefulness, a single moment of carelessness might cause some disaster among my temple attendants, bringing guilt upon me—that would be the greatest calamity. Also, I must soon part from you, Dao Brother, and though we love each other dearly, the separation weighs on my heart. Just now, while walking peacefully, my body suddenly shivered without cause—something never before experienced. Even when I fled the floods from the Central Plains thousands of li away, I never felt such a thing. If this is illness, it is not something we cultivators would have. There must be some reason, but our dao power is too shallow to foresee it. I think it is late; I must leave you now and see what has happened. If all is well, I will return tomorrow to report to you.”

The old dragon nodded, still smiling at his timidity. As he pondered, several earth deities hurried over, all bowing to the two and asking the Bat, “Does the honored god know what has happened in the temple?”

Before a word was spoken, the Bat was stunned, and even the old dragon was greatly surprised. He asked quickly, “What do you mean? Has some demon come to the temple? Or have his attendants caused trouble outside?” The earth deities then recounted the whole story.

The old dragon roared, “Detestable demon beast! Does he not know how fierce I am? Very well! Senior Brother, step aside and watch me deal with this demon. First, to avenge you; second, to prevent him from troubling the neighborhood; third, to let him recognize the old dragon’s power and never dare speak arrogantly again!”

The Bat was originally a very dutiful being, knowing well that his incense term was ending and that he would soon return to the mountain. With this opportunity, it was just right to bring matters to a close and report to his master. There was no need to quarrel. But the old dragon was not of such a mind. He was a fiery and impetuous fellow. After giving the Bat a few words, he did not wait for a reply but immediately revealed his true form, soaring into the sky. With a swift turn, he was already at the Virtue and Blessing Temple.

By chance, the old flood dragon, having just smashed the statue, was still raging, pointing to the sky and cursing loudly. Every word carried the old dragon’s name. The old dragon, unable to restrain his anger, shouted from midair, “You demon, show some respect! Your grandfather is here!”

The flood dragon did not expect the old dragon to arrive so quickly. Startled, he revealed his true form, rising on a cloud, brandishing his three-pointed, double-edged blade, and charged at the old dragon. Their dragon bodies were immense. The old dragon’s head butted like the weight of Mount Tai; his tail swept like a storm uprooting trees. The flood dragon was agile, leaping and twisting with furious wrath, making gods and ghosts tremble, circling left and right as Heaven and Earth mourned.

The two were evenly matched, battling long without a victor. The old dragon’s temper flared; suddenly he spat out a numinous pill that transformed into ten thousand fireballs surrounding the flood dragon. The flood dragon, a fierce beast of the deep, was most accustomed to water. Seeing the fire, he tried to use water to counter it, unaware that the old dragon’s pill was formed from the essence of sun and moon, spewing his own Samadhi True Fire—not ordinary water power could quench. The flood dragon summoned half the sea’s water to extinguish the divine pill, but this only poured oil on the fire, intensifying its fury and harming countless people and many homes. Realizing he could not win, the flood dragon transformed into a small loach and hid beneath the waves in a deep pool.

The old dragon searched long but could not find him. His anger flared. Without thinking, he used a reckless method, summoning several great mountains from afar and dumping them into the sea, hoping to fill the waters and crush the flood dragon. He cared not if the flood dragon was crushed.

The Ethereal One said here, “So you see, your disciple is truly a rough and bold fool. Did he not think: if he really filled Guankou with land and crushed the flood dragon, what about his own lair? Did he count on you, his teacher, to come to the Eastern Sea and lead him there, so he could just abandon his own nest?”

The Fire Dragon Perfected One laughed and said, “That’s why we call it a reckless and foolish method! He did indeed trap the flood dragon beneath the sea, but nearly lost his own life. Originally, this place was under Erlang’s jurisdiction, governing the upper, middle, and lower Three Realms alone. Hearing of the flood dragon’s strife and the flooding of homes, he hurried with his troops to suppress it. But he arrived too late; most of the sea had already been filled by the old dragon. Erlang was furious: ‘The poisonous flood dragon deserved to be crushed, but the old dragon’s crime is no less! If this is not strictly investigated, with the seas changing and lands shifting, even I will lose sovereignty.’ He ordered a search for the old dragon and brought him to me. It was the old dragon’s fate not to die. Hearing Erlang’s troops were coming, he had already fled the realm, leaving me to handle it. Who knew that in a moment, such a great calamity would arise? Where to begin telling it?”

The Fire Dragon Perfected One laughed, “So we two are truly comrades in suffering. Our master gave us this hard task, yet these two scoundrels are so unruly. They bring trouble upon themselves, and their future retribution is their own to bear. But we, as their teachers, cannot even control two disciples. If the other brothers knew, it would be shameful!”

The Ethereal One laughed, “Indeed!” Then he asked again about the flood dragon’s mischief. The Fire Dragon Perfected One recounted it all. Then he laughed and said, “Originally, since they disobeyed master’s orders, they should be severely punished to show our school’s strict discipline. But now, since we need them, we can only scare them a bit and have them assist the world ruler to earn merit and reduce guilt.”

The Ethereal One laughed, “Nowadays, earthly kings often talk of power politics or not. We immortals should treat others with propriety and sincerity in investigating things. Why resort to such trickery?”

The Fire Dragon Perfected One laughed, “That is a kind of pragmatic method. Without it, how could we make those two beasts bow their heads and serve with careful hearts?”

The Ethereal One laughed heartily, “Pragmatic or not, I only know that sincerity cannot investigate things; we have no choice but to use some illusions and lies to deceive people.”

The Fire Dragon Perfected One laughed, “Even so, as teachers, when there is no other way, we must resort to expediency once.”

The two immortals laughed together.

Soon they reached the sea surface. The Fire Dragon Perfected One formed a dragon-summoning seal, and the Flying Hu Dragon, transformed into a young woman, responded and emerged from the sea. Upon seeing his master, she was overwhelmed with remorse, prostrating herself with tears like rain. The Ethereal One also summoned Peaceful Harmony. The two masters sat cross-legged on the water’s surface, and as the waves rose, golden lotuses bloomed around them, surrounding the two immortals in solemn majesty. The two dragons bowed low to the sea, knowing their guilt, not daring to raise their heads.

The two masters commanded, “Do you acknowledge your guilt?” The Flying Dragon continued to weep, unable to speak. Peaceful Harmony, more stubborn, raised her head and recounted the flood dragon’s rampage. The Ethereal One waved his hand, “I fear you do not understand; why must you speak?” Frightened, Peaceful Harmony lowered her head and said no more. Then she sighed to the Fire Dragon Perfected One:

“As for their intentions, they cannot be called truly evil. But their deeds have gone too far, and that is their great sin. Moreover, there was the havoc in the Heavenly Palace. Had we not arrived, your lives would have been lost! They rely on petty magic, thinking no one in the world is stronger. But how many talented and virtuous men are there in the nine continents, myriad nations, and the Three Realms’ islands? Which one is not stronger than they? Those who arrogantly rely on their magic and look down on others will eventually perish by their own arts. Magic is meant for self-defense or to aid the world, not to bully others or rebel against order. When we first converted you, how did we warn you? How could you so soon bring such great calamities? According to immortal law, you bear the guilt of disrespecting elders, disobeying masters, and reckless behavior. Now that you see us, what punishment do you accept?”

The Flying Dragon, loyal and honest, bowed and begged forgiveness without another word. The Fire Dragon Perfected One smiled and asked Peaceful Harmony, “What say you?”

Peaceful Harmony replied solemnly, “Master Uncle, Master, if you did not love us, you would not have come to save us today. Since you have saved us, it means we are not yet guilty of death. Whatever punishment you decide, we trust your wisdom. Even if we must die, we are grateful to our masters. That is all.”

These words were very fitting, causing the merciful Fire Dragon Perfected One to laugh. The Ethereal One smiled and said, “Since you both know your guilt, will you henceforth be careful, diligent, and respectful, no longer reckless?”

Both dragons bowed, “We accept the heavens and earth’s great grace from our masters! If we ever dare to rely on magic arrogantly again, we would rather die beneath your flying swords!”

The two masters then rose together and recited their origins before the dragons. Each dragon stood beside their respective master, obediently listening. The two masters taught them the ritual of senior brother and junior sister meeting. Just as they were about to discuss future matters, a colorful cloud appeared in the northeast, drifting slowly toward them. The two immortals looked up and smiled, “That is the Old Moon arriving—what business does he have here?” Before the words finished, the Old Moon’s cloud descended upon the sea, and he met with the two immortals.

What this elder’s arrival portends remains to be revealed in the next chapter.
