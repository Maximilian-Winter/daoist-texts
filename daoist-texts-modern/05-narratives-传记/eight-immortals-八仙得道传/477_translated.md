# Chapter Nine: Inviting Heaven’s Favor to Truly Confer the Dragon Kingship; Bo Ting’s Festive Banquet and the Artifice of Snail Meat

Now it happened that the Old Moon descended to the clouds’ summit, where he met with the two immortals, Piaomiao and Fire Dragon. The two immortals inquired eagerly, “Fellow Daoist, what brings you here?” The Old Moon smiled and said, “This humble Daoist concerns himself with no mundane affairs, but solely manages the marriages of the upper, middle, and lower Heavens, throughout all continents within and beyond the seas. Now, your two esteemed disciples are bound by fate to wed—why have you not invited me to share a cup of joyous wine?” Only then did the two immortals understand his purpose. They both laughed and said, “So it is indeed! We are honored by your presence! But our young disciples are all of dragon stock—could their marriages also fall under your management?” The Old Moon chuckled, “Naturally! I govern all marriages, regardless of whether one is immortal, Buddha, or mortal.”

With that, he drew from his sleeve a register, unfolding it before the two immortals and saying, “Please take a look—are these not the names of your disciples?” The two immortals examined it closely and indeed saw recorded therein that Pinghe and Hu Feilong were originally of dragon lineage, later transformed into human form, and on a certain year, month, and day, became husband and wife.

Having read the register, the Old Moon folded it away. The two immortals then summoned their disciples to pay respects to the Old Moon, instructing them to perform a grand bow. The Old Moon’s face beamed with warmth as he modestly replied, “I dare not accept such ceremony!” He continued, “In the future, you two shall serve as kings of the water clans, overseeing the affairs of the four seas and nurturing the dragon stock, each governing their own ocean. Your futures are vast and magnificent. Moreover, since you do not command each other but are comrades in the people’s reckoning, how could I accept such grand ceremony?” The two immortals laughed, “Future matters can wait; for now, you are the great matchmaker—how can you not receive thanks?” The Old Moon, resigned, accepted their bow.

The Old Moon then instructed the two to pay respects to Heaven and Earth as well as to their two masters, after which they exchanged mutual bows, thus completing a fine marriage. Fire Dragon Immortal laughed and said, “Our young disciples have secured a good match, all thanks to your noble efforts, Daoist friend. A cup of wine is the humblest token of respect. Yet since they will soon receive their appointments and have not yet paid court to the immortal and mortal emperors, nor prepared a palace, even this smallest courtesy cannot be properly offered. Truly, this is most embarrassing!” The Old Moon smiled, “Such matters should rightly be arranged by the masters on their behalf. But since you say so, let us record this banquet for now, and when your disciples receive their imperial edicts and take up their new palaces, we shall visit again to celebrate their honors and offer a double feast!” The two immortals laughed heartily. The Old Moon said, “I am busy and cannot linger longer; I must take my leave.”

The two immortals smiled at each other. “That old fellow is quite witty. Since we are their masters, we should bestow something upon them.” Pinghe laughed, “What the masters grant us must surely be precious. Though the disciples are now married, they have no household yet. Better to keep them here for now and when they have advanced and established a home, then we shall bestow all the rewards at once!” The two masters agreed, “That makes sense. Once the imperial decree arrives, we will arrange a palace for you!” Pinghe and the others hastened to bow in thanks. The two masters instructed, “At present, the northern regions have been flooded. The mortal emperor there is called Yu Shun, a sage ruler of great benevolence. Because of the flood disaster, he toils day and night and has appointed his loyal ministers, Xia Yu and Boyi, to manage the waters. You two should go to assist them, sharing the responsibilities of governing the seas. When we came, the Patriarch had already petitioned Heaven to issue the imperial decree, which will soon arrive. After you have expressed your gratitude, you may take up your posts, and then we will bring you to meet with Xia Yu and the others. Only then may you divide your duties between water and land.”

As the two immortals spoke, suddenly music sounded from midair. Everyone looked up and beheld countless celestial officials riding clouds and mist, descending from the heavens. The two immortals hurriedly led their disciples to prostrate themselves upon the sea’s surface. The celestial officials halted some ten paces above the water and read aloud the imperial decree. The gist was:

“The paths of immortals and mortals are divided; water and land follow different courses. Now the lower realm suffers from flood disaster and rampant beasts and demons. The mortal emperor has appointed worthy ministers to oversee these affairs. All matters of the water clans shall be entrusted to talents dispatched by Me, to assist mortal lords and ministers, advancing hand in hand, so that floods may cease, demons hide, and millions of people may live in peace and prosperity. Now, the two immortal ancestors Yuanshi and Laozi recommend Pinghe and Hu Feilong as fit for this duty. Though the two ministers have past faults, these shall be temporarily overlooked. Pinghe is hereby appointed Dragon King of the Four Seas, Hu Feilong as Queen Consort, with imperial grace bestowed. Your descendants shall govern the great and small seas as Dragon Kings forever, never to be changed. You must reform your faces and cleanse your hearts to repay Heaven’s grace. Once you have achieved merit and covered past faults, great hopes lie ahead.” 

The two masters accepted the decree and led their disciples to bow toward the sky, then saw off the celestial officials. The disciples then came forward to thank their masters. The two masters admonished, “Though we have cultivated the Dao until now and hold the rank of Golden Immortals, we have never received such honor as you two now enjoy. Remember your humble origins and your level of attainment; what Daoist skill have you to invite such distinction? Henceforth, always strive and be vigilant, lest momentary loyalty mislead the myriad beings. Do not rely on high rank to scorn others. Keep a heart of benevolence and guard against arrogance. Cultivate virtue and merit; past faults may be covered, and future blessings boundless. Take this warning to heart and never forget it.” The disciples bowed deeply in acceptance. The two masters continued, “Now is the time for you to pay court to the Jade Emperor. We can accompany you to Heaven but cannot speak for you. Since you have transgressed before, when you present yourselves, you must be magnanimous and observe all proprieties. Do not feel shame or fear on account of past deeds, nor show arrogance from favor. Know that Heaven’s might is near at hand; honor and loss are deeply consequential. You must be most careful!” The disciples again responded with humble assent.

The two masters led them first to the Crane-Singing Cavern of Fire Dragon Immortal in the region of Yanzhou, where they changed into court robes and held jade tablets, their appearance radiant and spirits soaring. The two masters smiled at each other, “Look at these two fellows—they have some bearing, though we do not yet know if their inside and outside will match.” Piaomiao Immortal then conducted a session of court rituals to train them.

Both had deep roots and complete cultivation; naturally, they understood at once. The two immortals were greatly pleased and then took them to Heaven. At the Southern Heavenly Gate, four heavenly generals led celestial troops guarding the entrance. The two masters explained their purpose. The four generals bowed and admitted them. Then Li Changgen came forward to welcome them. Meeting Fire Dragon and Piaomiao, they greeted each other warmly and exchanged news.

Fire Dragon Immortal apologized on behalf of the disciples for past offenses. Piaomiao Immortal laughed and urged them to apologize in person. Li Changgen, startled, steadied one of them with a hand and laughed heartily, “You two Dao brothers are so formal! Why dwell on past matters? Moreover, ignorance is no crime. The Jade Emperor has pardoned past faults and bestowed new kingships. How could this humble Daoist harbor grudges?” After some modest exchanges, the masters and disciples followed Changgen straight to the Golden Palace. Changgen entered to report and received orders for the masters and disciples to pay court. Fire Dragon and Piaomiao gave the disciples final instructions. Everyone adjusted their robes and hats, held jade tablets before their chests, and proceeded with utmost reverence into the audience hall.

The Jade Emperor sat high upon the throne, flanked by great and lesser immortals standing in two ranks. The masters and disciples together proclaimed, “May Your Sacred Longevity be Boundless!” and knelt before the throne. The Jade Emperor issued commands, warmly comforting Fire Dragon and Piaomiao, and encouraging the couple Pinghe and Hu Feilong. All bowed in thanks as ritual demanded.

After the audience, many celestial officials came to renew old acquaintances with the two immortals. The two masters ordered their disciples to pay respects one by one. Lingering a while, they prepared to visit Yuanshi Laozi and other imperial lords and Golden Immortals, unwilling to tarry long, and took their leave. They exited the Southern Heavenly Gate, first visiting Yuanshi Tianzun of Kunlun Mountain, then Laozi Patriarch at the Eight Scenic Palace. Laozi bestowed upon Pinghe and Hu Feilong each a set of dragon robes embroidered with imperial dragons, a treasured sword for Pinghe, and a divine needle for Feilong, all capable of slaying demons from hundreds of miles away, wielded at will with unpredictable transformations. The disciples rejoiced and bowed in thanks.

Laozi spoke to Piaomiao, “The region of Guankou, from land to sea and sea to land, has its cycles of change predestined. To move mountains or overturn seas rashly is not Pinghe’s fault. Yet this land has more earth than water and lies far from the sea, making salinity difficult. You should go to the mortal realm and, with the world’s lord, use the Dao to create a monitoring well there, beside which a volcano should be set for the people’s use. Also, someone destined to be saved will appear there in due time and will know what to do. Soon I too shall descend to the mortal realm to resolve a worldly bond. Moreover, your elder brother Donghua will likely descend as well, but only after the central plains are pacified. That time is not yet.” He then spoke to Fire Dragon Immortal, “You have set a sluice on the Qiantang River to keep many demons at bay, which is excellent. Yet in the future a mighty flood dragon will pass through the gate. When that demon appears, great harm will ensue. You must always be vigilant and find a way to subdue him, sparing living beings from devastation. This too will be a great merit.” The two immortals accepted their orders and, seeing Laozi had no more to say, did not dare to linger and departed with their disciples. They toured various places before arriving at the Eastern Sea to the Emperor Hua.

The Emperor Hua was closest in friendship to the two immortals and arranged a grand banquet to celebrate with masters and disciples. During the feast, the emperor inquired about affairs in the mortal realm. The two immortals briefly discussed the situation. The emperor sighed, “I attained the Dao overseas and ascended to the immortal realm, yet I always regret never having seen the flourishing culture of China. When opportunity arises, I wish to descend and tour the mortal world. What do you two Dao brothers think?” Hearing this, the two immortals were struck with surprise and alarm. They quickly asked, “The Heavenly Palace is the highest and most noble place of all realms. Now that Your Majesty holds your heavenly office, how could you entertain thoughts of mortal wanderings? The sages never speak lightly, and their words are never idle. We beg Your Majesty to consider carefully!” The emperor still did not understand and blurted, “What difficulty is there? Many immortals and Buddhas have played in the red dust. Why may I not go?” Seeing his stubbornness, the two immortals dared not press further or speak more, fearing he might say something ominous. They exchanged glances, drained their cups, and took their leave. On the way, they discussed how the emperor’s mortal desires had suddenly stirred. No wonder the Patriarch had said Donghua would descend—if even one who cultivates the Dao so far is not free from greed and confusion, how much more others? This is truly a matter of great concern. They sighed together.

The flying dragon interjected, “May I ask, Master, since the Patriarch said ‘soon to descend,’ it seems that traveling between the Three Realms is common for immortals. Why then do you worry so about Elder Brother Donghua?” The two masters replied, “You do not understand. The Patriarch is ancestor to myriad nations, nine continents, five sacred mountains, three peaks, and countless immortals. No matter what kalpa or calamity, his Dharma body cannot be harmed, nor his Dao heart confused. When he descends, it is for unfinished karmic reasons; he will go and return. There is no need for others to worry. As for Elder Brother Donghua, though his virtue is deep, how can he compare to the Patriarch? Long ago, the Jade Emperor saw seven treasure trees shining in the Nine Heavens and was stirred by greed. He cast down one soul to mortal trials. That soul’s heart was confused and nearly failed to return to Heaven. Thanks to many assisting immortals who protected and guided him, he completed his kalpa and returned to truth. Today’s Great Emperor Perfected Martial is that very soul of the Jade Emperor incarnate. Even the Jade Emperor himself, with such foundation, cannot be moved by greed or anger, nor utter idle words. How much less Elder Brother Donghua, and still less others?”

The disciples listened in awe and said, “I, a disciple of humble birth and shallow cultivation, have always looked down on all else, ignorant of Heaven’s height and Earth’s depth. Now, hearing the master’s teachings, I feel as if utterly talentless. From now on, I must restrain myself ever more, lest I fall into the kalpa of reincarnation.” The two masters rejoiced, “If you can thus control yourselves, your future is truly boundless. Though kalpa and suffering are fated, why not cultivate virtue and merit to reverse your fortunes?” The disciples responded with humble assent. After paying respects to the lords and immortals of the upper realms, the four returned to the lower world.

At that time, Yu Shun had established his capital in what is now Shanxi. The so-called China then consisted only of the northern and southern banks of the Yellow River. The upper and lower reaches of the Yangtze were considered southern barbarians, outside the realm. The Yellow River basin was all lowlands, and due to the river’s overflow in all directions, along with smaller waters like the Ji and Huai Rivers, the volume of water increased drastically and could not be contained. It all surged forth, turning the entire Central Plains into a vast marshland. The people could not settle and fled to higher ground. Yet those places were full of fierce beasts—lions, tigers, leopards, wolves—that attacked humans. Those who did not perish by water were devoured by beasts.

The people then knew not what grievous sin they had committed to deserve such a rare and ancient kalpa. Fortunately, Emperor Shun was wise in appointing capable men. He entrusted the water management to Xia Yu and Boyi. They accepted the imperial command but found the flood too great to tackle at once. They deliberated and issued a proclamation seeking ideas for flood control. Fire Dragon Immortal and Piaomiao Immortal happened to be passing with Pinghe and Hu Feilong and first went to meet Yu and Boyi. They presented plans for dredging and flood control, and informed them of the imperial decree appointing Pinghe and Hu Feilong as Dragon King and Queen Consort of the Great Sea to assist in water affairs and govern the water clans. Yu and Boyi were greatly pleased and took them to pay court to Emperor Shun, explaining their purpose. Emperor Shun praised them and, like the Jade Emperor, conferred the queen’s title. Then the two immortals sent Pinghe and Hu Feilong into the great sea.

Fire Dragon Immortal personally journeyed to the Southern Sea and gathered vast quantities of crystal. Using wondrous methods, he constructed for them a palace upon the water, where not a ripple stirred and all was clear inside and out. This became the famed Crystal Palace of legend. Piaomiao Immortal brought various furnishings and vessels, arranging everything perfectly. In no time, a splendid dragon palace was completed. The Dragon King and Queen were deeply moved, offering only bows of thanks, speechless. The two masters smiled, “Though you come from humble origins, you have attained this high station. This is partly due to your accumulated merit and partly due to fortunate timing—this flood disaster. Even the Patriarch and Jade Emperor value you greatly, so we have done our utmost to instruct and nurture you and to create such a fine abode. Know that all this is the grace of the imperial teachers. It is hoped you will not fail this grace but devote yourselves fully to assisting the mortal lords in resolving this kalpa. From now on, the boundaries between water and land realms will be clear and no longer chaotic and disaster-prone as before. All matters of the sea are entrusted to you, so be cautious and diligent. Decades hence, when your descendants grow and mature, they may be assigned to govern distant and strategic rivers and lakes under your supervision. Should any errors occur, you yourselves will be held accountable.”

The Dragon King and Queen listened respectfully and accepted their orders. Seeing all was settled, the two masters returned to the Eight Scenic Palace to report. From then on, the Dragon King couple carefully and tirelessly assisted Yu and Boyi, guiding floodwaters into the sea. Whenever sea dragons, turtles, or giant turtles entered the Central Plains and harmed living beings, the Dragon King dispatched trained troops to subdue and drive them back to the sea. Yu and Boyi were loyal and diligent, following the two immortals’ strategies—dredging, diverting, opening channels. For beast troubles, Boyi led able-bodied men with fire weapons to burn mountains and hunt, killing countless beasts, all within human power. But the sea works would not have succeeded without the Dragon King couple’s cooperation. The people resumed peaceful lives, new borders and provinces were delineated, and a simple local system established. These matters are recorded in the Book of Yu’s Tribute and are beyond the scope of this text, so are omitted.

Now this book speaks of a small matter, somewhat related to the flood disaster. At that time, beneath Mount Song in Henan, there lived a poor family of three—mother, son, and wife—who farmed for a living. Their surname was Sun, the son named Jie, the mother Wang, and the wife Liu. Wang had lost her husband in middle age and raised her orphaned son alone. From the day she became widowed, she abstained from meat and fish, observing vegetarianism to clarify her resolve. When the flood disaster struck, the whole family fled to the mountains. Wang, aged and weak, could not endure the hardship and sorrow, and contracted a damp illness, attacked both inside and out, becoming gravely ill. After the waters receded, they returned home only to find all their belongings swept away, leaving Wang deeply distressed and her illness worsening.

In the countryside, doctors were scarce, and after the flood, the family’s finances were strained, making medicine impossible to afford. She grew worse each day, nearing death. Sun Jie and his wife Liu never left her side, day and night, but there was little else they could do. One day, as Wang’s end approached, she suddenly became lucid and requested something to eat. The couple rejoiced, thinking she might recover, and asked what she desired. Wang refused this and that, but insisted only on eating field snails. This was because after the flood, a large snail had somehow come into the house. Liu, amazed by its size, had kept it alive in clean water. Wang had seen it and now wished to taste this new delicacy. Sun Jie thought, “If mother desires it, what does it matter if it is meat or vegetable? Let her eat.” But Liu knew this was an ill omen. Having eaten vegetarian for decades, opening her diet to meat might cause new illness or remorse, and for a vegetarian, breaking the vow was a grave offense. So she devised a plan: she found several empty snail shells, boiled them clean to remove all scent, then mashed gluten and dried fermented bean curd into a paste shaped like snail meat, filling the shells to trick Wang. They ceremoniously “cooked” the snail and served it to her. Wang happily ate several shells, unaware it was a counterfeit. After a day, her life ended.

Sun Jie and his wife grieved deeply, wasting away. They quickly arranged the funeral. Because Wang had loved snails at the end, Liu was heartbroken seeing the large snail and so Sun Jie released it into the water. Later Liu also fell ill and died. On her deathbed, she tearfully told her husband, “I have followed you for twenty years, cared for your parents and household, and believe I have not failed in virtue. Yet I bore you no sons or daughters. Our poverty is such that after I die, you will have no money to remarry. The Sun family bloodline will be cut off through you. This is what I cannot rest in peace over.” Having spoken, she passed away.

From then on, only Sun Jie remained. He could no longer farm and worked as a hired laborer for wealthy villagers, barely sustaining himself. In that region, hired workers were generally given only a midday meal; breakfast and dinner were to be eaten at home. Sun Jie had to both work and cook for himself, often struggling to manage both. With no one to tend the household, everything was inconvenient. He wished to remarry but lacked the strength. Often recalling his wife’s last words, his heart felt as if cut by knives. Thus passed half a year.

One day, it was his wife’s birthday, and he went to the grave to mourn. Returning home, he saw smoke rising from his kitchen and grew suspicious. Rushing back, he found the rice cooked and dishes boiling, all ready for him. Searching for whoever had cooked, he found no trace, deepening his wonder. Hungry, he ate the meal without hesitation. Each day he went to work as usual, returning to find meals prepared, yet no cook appeared. Doors and windows were securely locked, untouched. This bewildered and delighted Sun Jie beyond measure. At first, he dared not tell anyone, but every day he tried to return home a bit earlier to catch the mystery. Yet the unseen cook always left before he arrived. Sun Jie chased empty shadows many times.

One evening, taking leave from work, he left early and at night borrowed a ladder from a neighbor to climb the wall and peer into his kitchen. What he saw nearly made his three souls and seven spirits flee his body. The cook was a peerless beauty! Such a marvel was exceedingly rare.

If you ask who she was, even Sun Jie himself did not fully understand. The author can only say: this will be revealed next time.
