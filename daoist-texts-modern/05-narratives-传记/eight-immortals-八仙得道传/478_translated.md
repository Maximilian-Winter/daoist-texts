# Chapter Ten: The Widower’s Astonishing Encounter — The Field Snail’s Gratitude

Now it happened that Sun Jie, beholding such a beauty, found himself utterly amazed. Without rhyme or reason, day after day, she cooked his meals and brewed his tea. Standing atop the ladder, he could not help but utter a startled “Eh!” That single sound, though slight, was enough to alert the lady within. She was seized by sudden panic and vanished as if into thin air.

Sun Jie descended the ladder and entered the room. There lay a pot of rice, half-cooked and raw. The day before, he had seen that the household’s rice supply would last three or four days at most. Yet now, the rice bin was suddenly filled to the brim with gleaming white grains. Alongside it, there appeared salt-cured meat, chicken, fish, and other delicacies, all neatly stored in the cabinet. Sun Jie had no choice but to finish cooking the rice and eat his fill.

With provisions abundant, he asked his landlord for leave of two days, vowing not to step outside, patiently awaiting the lady’s arrival.

Yet the lady, knowing he no longer went to work, ceased preparing his evening meals. Instead, she only brought him a morning meal while he slept deeply at dawn, accompanied by many fresh side dishes, all cooked with exquisite flavor. Sun Jie often rose early, hoping to see her, but these days she remained unseen.

Still, one thing brought him great joy: the lady, fearing he might lack money without work, had procured a great store of silver for him—enough to last several years.

Overjoyed, Sun Jie resolved to open a small shop, freeing himself from a lifetime of servitude. Having made up his mind, he went to resign from the landlord. The landlord, a man over sixty with a kindly heart, asked why he wished to quit. Sun Jie, honest and simple, told the truth.

The landlord smiled and said, “The one you met may be some immortal. Surely you must have done some good deed, saved her life perhaps, and she has come to repay you.”

Sun Jie replied, “I am but a poor man, utterly destitute. How could I have done any good deed?”

“Good deeds need not require wealth,” the landlord chuckled. “If you cannot recall, do not trouble yourself. But the gods of Heaven may not be the ones benefiting you. Perhaps it is the spirit of some flower, tree, bird, or beast you once saved, now come to repay your kindness. If so, prepare a piece of burnt dough, roll it into a small ball, and when she comes, suddenly seize her and force the burnt dough into her mouth. Once she swallows it, she will be as mortal as any human. Then you may question her and marry her, and the blessings to come will be boundless!”

Sun Jie took this advice to heart. He waited the whole night, feigning sleep until dawn. At daybreak, he quietly slipped into the kitchen. There he saw the lady, her back turned, cutting vegetables. Following the landlord’s instructions, Sun Jie suddenly stepped forward, embracing her tightly while thrusting the prepared burnt dough into her mouth. As she swallowed with a gulp, he was about to release her when she spoke:

“Husband, please let go. I have already accepted mortal life and cannot flee. Allow me to slowly explain myself.”

Sun Jie knew she spoke truthfully and released his hold. The lady turned her face, cheeks tinged with shame, and bowed deeply to Sun Jie. Sun Jie, too, bowed in return, feeling somewhat embarrassed. He began to speak:

“Madam, we are strangers, and I but a poor man with no good to offer you. Why then this mistaken affection? My heart is troubled! Now that I behold your noble presence, I beg you to explain plainly.”

The lady smiled gently and said, “I have my reasons and would rather not have you know. I do not know who whispered such cruel counsel to you, but what you wish to know, I dare not reveal. I fear that if you knew, you would doubt me and avoid me like a scorpion, unwilling to meet. Then my great debt of gratitude would remain unpaid, or worse, your suspicion would turn kindness to harm. What then shall I do?”

Sun Jie sighed and said, “Madam, you speak too harshly. Though I am but a poor countryman, I pride myself on some measure of courage and loyalty. If you treat me thus, it must be because I once did you some small service. I truly cannot recall! If you will not tell me, I must begin to doubt you. I would hate to waste effort on one who is not my benefactor. My fate is poor enough as it is; I should not accept gifts without merit. Not only would I gain no benefit, but surely my lifespan would be shortened. If I am fated to live sixty years, I fear I shall not reach fifty. Madam, consider this—how could I accept your grace again?”

The lady laughed softly and said, “You are truly honest and simple, Master Sun. Hearing your words, I see you are also a mischievous friend. I will not hide it from you: I have long wished to explain, but the paths between the seen and unseen are mysterious. I feared gossip and that you would not understand my plight, and so I concealed myself, hoping to serve you for several years until you trusted me and saw I meant no harm. Only then would I reveal all and you would understand. Yet before a full moon passed, you caught me. Could it be that we are truly fated?”

At these words, her face flushed faintly. Sun Jie’s heart blossomed with joy, his mouth wide open in astonishment. Then he spoke seriously:

“Madam, do not overthink. I have said it before: though poor, I have courage and loyalty. Speak plainly—if you are truly some demon or spirit, and yet claim I once did you a kindness, and have come to repay it, though I cannot claim such merit, I can be sure you mean no harm. I am no wooden doll or clay figure; surely I can tell good will from ill.”

The lady lowered her delicate neck, hesitated, then raised her head with a radiant smile:

“Tell me, husband, do you see me as human or ghost, demon or spirit, mountain sprite or tree essence?”

Without hesitation, Sun Jie laughed and replied, “Madam, you are heavenly and human, neither immortal nor mere mortal, but surely beyond ordinary folk. If such ghosts and spirits truly exist, none could match your kindness or talent.”

She smiled and said, “You speak well. Others say you are not good with words—how strange!”

Sun Jie laughed, “Perhaps it is what they call ‘fortune bringing quick wit.’”

She laughed again and said, “To tell you truly, I am not human. Immortals are too lofty for me to impersonate; demons and spirits too fierce for me to meddle with. Husband, recall the honored lady in your household—did you ever save a life for her? When she was dying, did she express any regrets? Think carefully and guess; if you guess wrong, I will tell you.”

Sun Jie pondered and only remembered that Lady Liu lamented never bearing children. As for saving a life, he could not recall.

The lady nodded and sighed, “That is why I see your household as virtuous and kind, true gentlemen who do good without hope of reward. My surname is Luo, my given name Yuan. I come from the banks of the Huai River. When the great flood came, a mighty wave swept me into your household. When the waters receded, I had no chance to leave. Your honored lady raised me with care as if I were her own flesh and blood. Later, when your mother fell ill and faced death, I too nearly lost my life. Yet your honored lady devised a plan and found a substitute, preserving my fragile life. Later, your wise couple sent me out of the household so I might live freely. Such grace and kindness I can never repay. When I heard your lady was so virtuous, yet did not live long, I resolved to repay this debt. Being not human, I was ashamed to reveal myself and so took on the role of a servant, waiting years to gain your trust before revealing myself. Yet before a full month passed, we met. Is this not great fortune? Now that things have come to this, I hope you will not despise me as other than human, but allow me to serve you faithfully, tending your household duties. Though I am unworthy, I will not burden your life nor bring you harm. You, a man of honor, surely can see my humble heart and trust I mean no ill.”

Sun Jie, hearing all, finally realized this was the very field snail he had released. Though startled at first, her clear speech and tender affection, and her devoted care these past days, filled his heart with gratitude and no doubt. Rising, he bowed deeply and said, “Madam, you are heavenly indeed. There was no intent before, and it was nothing to speak of. Now that you mean well, I cannot say more. Only I fear my lowly status and rough ways make me unworthy of your natural beauty. Though you refuse my help, I feel ever more ashamed.”

Luo Yuan smiled, “Since you accept me without suspicion, we are kin. No need for ceremony. But there is one matter I must ask you to agree to.”

Sun Jie hastened, “As husband and wife, one body and one heart, what could I refuse?”

Luo Yuan blushed and said, “It is nothing great. Because my cultivation is shallow, though I can take human form, I cannot yet shed my shell. Only after twenty years, having absorbed much mortal life and nourished by your essence and blood, can I gradually discard this stubborn husk and become fully human. Husband, at midnight tomorrow night, come to the western riverbank. Bring my shell and place it in a large jar filled with clear water, changing the water once a month. Keep it hidden so no one else knows. This is most important. Will you promise?”

Sun Jie laughed heartily, “What great matter is this? So it is as you say. Surely nothing to be so secretive about.” Luo Yuan laughed too.

That day, after completing all tasks for Sun Jie, Luo Yuan returned home. At night, fearing mishap, Sun Jie waited until midnight and hurried to the western riverbank. There he found the large field snail he and Lady Liu had released, still by the shore. Joyfully, he brought it home and arranged everything as instructed before going to sleep.

At dawn, he heard voices in the kitchen and rose suspiciously. There was Luo Yuan, accompanied by two young maids, directing them in making tea, fetching water, cooking rice, and preparing dishes. Seeing Sun Jie, Luo Yuan first thanked him for his care and then introduced the two maids, saying, “These two children are young but very capable.” The two maids bowed to Sun Jie, who was filled with joy.

From then on, Luo Yuan dwelled permanently in Sun Jie’s home, becoming his wife. Though Sun Jie once had nothing, his household gradually prospered. Not only were rice, firewood, and clothing no longer a worry, but all daily comforts surpassed those of wealthy families. Sun Jie ceased working as a servant and opened a rice and flour shop in the market. Business and trade were managed entirely by Luo Yuan’s counsel. Often, ventures that others deemed failures turned to success under her hand. Within two years, they became a family of wealth.

Sun Jie was naturally kind and generous, always ready to help those in urgent need, whether known or unknown. Fortunately, Luo Yuan’s vast spiritual power continually brought silver to sustain his charity. Without her, their fortune would have long since been spent.

Nearby towns and villages all knew of the couple. People called Sun Jie “Sun the Good Man” and Luo Yuan “Living Guanyin.” The couple lived in great harmony and joy, save for one matter that troubled their hearts.

Lady Liu, before dying, had worried about the family line. Luo Yuan, in repaying her debt, had taken on the role of Sun Jie’s wife, intending to bear sons and continue the family line. Yet despite all, this crucial matter remained unresolved.

More than ten years passed with no news. Sun Jie grew desperate, often frowning and sighing sadly. He said to Luo Yuan, “I have done no wrong, helped those in need, and though I do not boast, I have a clear conscience. Why then does Heaven deny me even one son? What sin of mine has damaged my virtue to bring this fate?”

Luo Yuan comforted him again and again, saying, “You are still young, your vigor undiminished. The time to have children will come. Your good heart will surely bring Heaven’s blessing. How can you be sure you will have no offspring?”

Sun Jie could only hope year after year, waiting in vain.

Yet the way of Heaven never errs in its rewards. For one as kind as Sun Jie, how could he be left without heirs? The Old Lord of Fate had long since prepared a fine son for him, awaiting the proper time, to be escorted by celestial officials.

Dear readers, if you wish to know which noble child Heaven has prepared for him, and what moment awaits, the author, reluctant to reveal all at once, will unfold the tale in the next chapter.
