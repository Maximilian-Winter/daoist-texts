# Chapter Eleven: Misplaced Wrath Bewilders the Human; the Flood Dragon Vents Its Grievance — The Dharma Master’s Exorcism Ends in Humiliation

Now, as the previous chapters recounted, the Sublime Immortal Piaomiao once told the Fire Dragon Immortal of a certain mouse who transformed into a bat and guarded the cave abode on Mount Xiqi for the Venerable Immortal Wenmei. Later, because of his merits among the people of Guankou, he was assigned to receive incense offerings there. The Immortal had originally calculated that this incense service would last about one thousand years. Yet, before the thousand years had passed, a flood dragon stirred up trouble and ruined the bat’s temple.

The bat, originally loyal and content, knowing the incense period was nearly over, no longer harbored vain hopes. He returned to the mountain to pay respects to his master, Immortal Wenmei, and recounted the whole affair.

The Immortal, silently turning the divine mechanism of his mind, pondered long and deep. At last, he sighed and said: “Though you come from a strange origin, and are among the lowest of creatures, you have nonetheless achieved such attainment. People might think you have cultivated for countless ages. This degree of accomplishment is not extraordinarily rare, but since the beginning of the Way, it is exceedingly rare for such a lowly creature to cultivate into a human and attain the dao. In the future, you will have an immense destiny; few besides you can claim such a fate. It seems Heaven has not treated you unfairly.

“Why do I speak these words to you? Because your origin is so humble, yet your future so vast — this is truly rare. Whenever one gains beyond their due, many unexpected trials arise. The deeper the trials, the greater the success, and the more precious the accomplishment. If anyone could simply read a few dao texts and refine a few years of sitting meditation to become an immortal, then all beings would rush to learn the ways of immortals, and immortality would be commonplace! What then would distinguish immortal from mortal? If immortality were not precious, and immortals no longer remarkable, why would we endure such arduous cultivation?”

The bat bowed deeply and said, “Disciple understands. Though born of strange kind, among the most base and humble of beasts, I was taken in by the master and have received incense offerings for a thousand years. While I dare not claim great attainment, I have gained some measure of humanity. From now on, I shall likely cross from the beastly path into the human path. Others are born human with excellent roots and nature, making cultivation easier; I dare not arrogate myself among humans. No matter what hardships and trials life may bring, I am willing to endure. If I endure, it will be the master’s grace in fulfilling me, and my own unmerited honor! If I cannot endure, then I shall only blame my fate and lament the wasted cultivation of ten thousand years — but that too is beyond remedy! I will never harbor resentment or regret. Though foolish and simple, I only know to obey Heaven and respect the master, to cultivate contentedly. Beyond that, I ask nothing more. I hope the master will pity and teach me.”

The Immortal smiled, his brows lifting in joy: “I did not expect such resolve and perseverance in you. Truly you are an outstanding talent among creatures — a rare anomaly. Anomalies either perish or rise to great honor. For one like you, ruin is certain; success is truly immeasurable! This is the crucial moment at the boundary of beast and human. I shall now prepare a writ to send you to the Underworld’s Reincarnation Hall, requesting they send you back into the mortal world, to be reborn in a good and virtuous family. You must set your purpose firmly, clarify your mind and see your true nature. Do not be seduced by profit or desire, nor blinded by wealth and beauty. Uphold righteousness, regard evil as an enemy, diligently practice all good, and shun all evil. If you persevere without slackening, when the time comes, another will come to guide you out of the world. Even if worldly entanglements and setbacks arise, these are fated trials of your life palace. Do not lose heart or abandon your prior efforts. Know that the trials of cultivation are not true suffering, but necessary stages on the path. The more trials endured, the greater the future success. None of this effort will be in vain. Remember my words well — forget not, forget not! Among all my disciples, I hope only you have such destiny.”

The bat, moved to tears, said, “Disciple understands fully. I have said before, I cultivate in accord with fate, caring not for success or failure. Moreover, the master has clearly instructed me, so what destiny could there be beyond that?” The Immortal was greatly pleased and immediately prepared the writ to send him to the Underworld.

But the bat knelt again and said, “One more thing, master. You said just now, ‘When the time comes, another will come to liberate you.’ Does this mean you yourself may not come to save me? I have received your instruction and guidance, your grace is as vast as the earth. Must I then seek another master? This confounds me greatly!”

Immortal Wenmei, hearing this, sighed deeply: “Fellow disciple, all meetings are due to fate; when the fate ends, we part. This is natural and need not be minded. Moreover, our relationship will not end here. But the one who will liberate you is indeed not me, though he is no different from me — for we are brothers, from the same lineage. I gain nothing, but you gain a master of great virtue. Know that this too is a blessing beyond the ordinary!”

The bat was filled with mixed joy and sorrow. The Immortal completed the writ and sent a powerful spirit to the Underworld. There, the King of the Underworld examined the records and said, “Sun Jie of Henan has accumulated virtue and merit, saving countless lives. He has no children yet. Let the bat be sent to be reborn there.” The judge prepared the reply and sent it back with the envoy. The Immortal sent the bat to the appointed place, where the Underworld’s Reincarnation Department personally sent him back to the mortal realm.

By chance, Sun Jie’s wife, Lady Luo, was ten months pregnant. One night she dreamed of an official who brought a black flying bird, saying, “You and your husband have done good deeds for many years, moving the heart of Heaven. The King of the Underworld has sent this celestial bird as your son. This creature is of immortal stock, with a vast and limitless future. You should cherish him well and not look down upon him.” After speaking, the bird flew into her arms. Startled, she awoke. Soon she felt labor pains; within half an hour, a baby was born, fair-faced, red-lipped, with clear brows and bright eyes. The couple’s joy was extraordinary, and knowing the dream’s portent, they understood their son was no ordinary child but one of rare root and destiny, filling their hearts with comfort. Since he was a gift from the immortals, they named him Xianci — “Immortal’s Gift.”

Time passed swiftly. By the age of ten, Sun Jie and his wife hired a renowned teacher to instruct Xianci. Gifted by Heaven, he read swiftly, understanding deeply. By fourteen, he had filled his mind with histories ancient and modern, and many classics of famous sages. Word spread, and nearby regions knew the child of the Sun family was born of immortal seed, a prodigy. The local magistrate Feng heard of him and came to invite him. Sun Jie, reluctant to let his son go while still a child, pleaded repeatedly. Yet the magistrate, after speaking with Xianci, recognized his true talent and insisted, smiling at Sun Jie, “Sir, do you still think your son a mere child? Though young, his learning is profound, unmatched by many adults. If he assists me in managing affairs, he will surely benefit the region and protect the people. In a year or two, I will recommend him to the court, where his talents can be fully displayed!” Sun Jie, having no choice, consulted his wife and agreed to let Xianci serve the magistrate.

The magistrate rejoiced and returned to office with Xianci. All important local affairs were consulted with him before implementation. Xianci, grateful for the trust, worked wholeheartedly, speaking frankly. Within a year, the administration was renewed, and the people praised them all. The magistrate was delighted and soon promoted Xianci to the post of junior official. Still under twenty, handsome and mature beyond his years, Xianci became renowned at court. Many noble families with daughters sought marriage alliances. Xianci, devoted to state affairs and youthfully indifferent, deferred all such matters to his parents.

Later, a senior official named Bo Gao, deeply fond of Xianci, resolved to marry his second daughter, Hui’er, to him. Xianci again deferred to his parents. Bo Gao came personally to the Sun household to request the marriage. The Suns, having long heard of the daughters’ talents and virtues, consented readily. The match was set for the third month of the coming year.

That winter, Hui’er was in the garden watching servants pick wintersweet blossoms. Suddenly, she saw a young man beyond the fence peering in. Feeling displeased, she turned to leave, but a sudden blue light dazzled her eyes, clouding her mind. She collapsed. Fortunately, a maid nearby supported her, calling out loudly. Hui’er seemed mad, crying out to run beyond the garden, her strength inexplicable. Three or four women struggled to restrain her but failed. The commotion alarmed those inside. Bo Gao had just returned from court and, hearing the disturbance, hurried with his wife Lady Gu and eldest daughter Jugu, bringing all servants to the garden.

They found Hui’er glaring fiercely, struggling wildly, her clothes torn, hair disheveled, a wild and unseemly sight. Her eyes stared blankly, spittle flying, shouting nonsense. Even seeing her parents, she showed no shame, still striving to escape.

Lady Gu, heartbroken, embraced Hui’er, weeping and calling out, “My child, what has happened? Are you forsaking your mother’s life?” Bo Gao, knowing this was evil possession, did not ask questions but approached and slapped her several times, shouting, “What demon dares cause mischief here? Know that my family has been loyal and blameless for generations, never defying Heaven. The celestial immortals have never slighted me. How dare a petty demon be so rude! Leave at once, or I will petition the sovereigns of both immortal and mortal realms to punish you severely! Then you will regret it too late!” At these words, Hui’er ceased her madness, silent and walking away.

The crowd followed her as she returned indoors, going straight to her chamber, sitting stiffly on the bed, still possessed by evil spirit. Bo Gao and Lady Gu were helpless and summoned many famous doctors. Some diagnosed evil invading the heart-mind, fearing madness; others said phlegm clouded the mind, curable by clearing the phlegm. Opinions varied widely. Bo Gao had each prepare prescriptions, with some overlap and some differences. Hui’er only sneered coldly and refused to speak.

Lady Gu proposed praying to Heaven and Earth, laying all prescriptions before the altar, asking Bo Gao to sincerely pray. After the prayer, she randomly drew a prescription as a sign from Heaven. Bo Gao, out of options, followed her advice, bought the herbs, brewed the medicine, and gave it to Hui’er.

Hui’er took the medicine, laughed loudly, and suddenly spoke in a man’s voice: “You are truly fools! The prescriptions of these quack doctors, no matter how many doses, cannot cure my illness! Besides, I am perfectly healthy, no ailment at all. If you doubt, bring a doctor skilled in pulse diagnosis to examine me carefully. Does my pulse show any sign of illness? Ridiculous — all those you hired are drunkards and gluttons, skilled only in cheating and killing!”

She poured the steaming medicine into a basin beside her. Strange indeed, though a small cupful, when poured it filled the basin to the brim, forming a towering spire, sharp at the peak, widening downward to the rim like a pagoda. The crowd was horrified.

Bo Gao, furious, said, “Though I have no ill will toward others, I ask: why do such demons find me? I consider myself blameless. Why should such evil afflict my family?” Tears fell unbidden.

Lady Gu wept bitterly, choking with grief. Hui’er, still in the male voice, laughed: “Dear elders, no need to grieve. I do not wish to speak further with Bo Gao’s wild words. But since you speak so pitifully, I must tell you the truth. I am the Dragon God of the Western Sea. Once, in Guankou, where the disciple of Immortal Wenmei — a bat insect — received incense offerings, I grew jealous because he befriended the old dragon there and ignored me, a true dragon. In anger, I destroyed his temple. But he should not have dragged the old dragon into conflict with me, trapping me beneath the sea, unable to rise. Later, the old dragon impersonated me, accepted the Jade Emperor’s decree, and was made Dragon King of the Four Seas. I was trapped beneath the sea, powerless to oppose him. Fortunately, my master Piaomiao Immortal, under the command of the Primordial Lord, came to Guankou with the Erlang God of Guankou to handle the old dragon’s mountain-moving and sea-filling case, transforming the sea into a vast salt well. Beside the salt well, they set a fire well for all beings to boil salt. Beneath that fire well is where I was imprisoned. During their work, a slight oversight allowed me to escape. Hearing that the bat was now reborn as Sun Jie’s son and married into your family, an official of junior rank, I sought him for revenge. Passing by your garden, I met your daughter. Knowing she was Sun Jie’s wife, and seeing her beauty, I was angered that my enemy should enjoy such fortune. Thus, I played a trick on your daughter. If you are wise, break off this marriage quickly. I will then focus on that youth, my sworn enemy, who will surely die by my hand. Your daughter, if married to him, will be a widow. Better to part early. My actions are half revenge, half for your benefit. Do you understand?”

Bo Gao, enraged, said, “Nonsense! You harassed the bat and destroyed his temple, yet he did not blame you! Your suffering is due to the old dragon’s fault, not the bat’s, and what have we to do with it? Though you are a strange being and can take human form, you must know that even with dao power, reason and propriety matter. Consider this: bullying the weak to vent your grudge — what honor is there in that?”

Hui’er slammed the cabinet, furious: “You brat! I meant well to warn you, and you mock me for bullying the weak! The old dragon and bat will have their day of reckoning. If you live a hundred years, you will see it with your own eyes. But now is not the time. As for your daughter, if you insist on marrying her to Sun’s son, better she marry me, the old dragon. By status, he is a low official; I am a divine dragon. By power and dao, he is but a mortal child, no match for my ten-thousand-year cultivated form. By future benefit, if she marries me, I will help her become immortal. Even your in-laws will benefit! Not to mention the reliable pills of immortality I can provide. What can that boy offer? You and your wife are wise people — reconsider, lest you ruin your daughter’s life and your own fate!”

Bo Gao shouted, “If you claim to be a divine dragon, is such lawless behavior fitting? Can you force yourself upon a married woman? I suspect you are some sea creature — fish, shrimp, turtle, or tortoise — who has cultivated sorcery to deceive and harm the world. Such lawlessness surely Heaven will not permit! Though I cannot restrain your magic in the mortal realm, do the many gods above allow your reckless harm to innocent people?”

The demon, exposed, grew ever more furious and ashamed. He pounded tables and stools, brandished knives and staves, causing a greater uproar. The entire Bo household was terrified and uneasy. Lady Gu first pleaded, but when he would not relent, she summoned a Dharma Master named Ding Dequan to exorcise the demon.

Master Ding held the Seven Stars Sword, wore the Eight Trigrams robe, his face radiating immortal aura. Ascending the altar, he issued talismans, gesturing east and west, making a great commotion. Suddenly, he struck the command tablet thrice and intoned, “Most High Primordial Lord, urgent as the law’s decree!” Before the words ended, a black mist surged toward him. Ding, panicked, dropped the tablet and wildly brandished his sword as if mad. The crowd below thought him bravely battling the demon and admired his skill. Yet after a while, the black mist did not disperse, and Ding’s immortal visage was stained pitch black, looking ghastly like a ghost.

The crowd laughed nervously and cried out, “Why has Master Ding turned into a black man?” Ding heard nothing, still dancing wildly, sweat pouring like rain. His frenzy gave way to struggle, then exhaustion. He could no longer speak a word, not even the secret incantation “urgent as the law’s decree.” Only then did the crowd realize he was not exorcising the demon, but had been thoroughly bested.

Bo Gao, a man of virtue, was deeply distressed. He and Lady Gu pleaded repeatedly. The demon, still possessing Hui’er, forced the couple to address him as “High Immortal” and promised never to offend them again nor allow another exorcist. The Suns agreed. Then Ding shouted, “High Immortal, spare me! I know my guilt!”

No sooner had he spoken than he collapsed on the altar. The crowd hurried to him, finding him stiff and near death, with only a faint breath. Bo Gao was filled with indescribable regret. They dismantled the altar and carried Ding outside, giving him hot water to drink. Ding was not ill, only exhausted from his wild dance and having expended his immortal power, his vitality drained. After rest, he could sit up. Seeing Bo Gao nearby, he suddenly wept: “Sir, I tried my utmost to exorcise the demon for you, but the demon’s strength was immense. Fortunately, my dao power is not shallow, and by your great fortune, I severed his legs. I intended to kill him, but out of respect for the virtue of Heaven and Earth, and following my master’s orders, I refrained from killing. I released him but forbade his return. Now you may rest assured. Alas, I have suffered greatly and will be unable to perform rites for months!”

As he spoke, his blackened face twitched, revealing two half-red, half-white shining pupils, terrifying to behold. Bo Gao, kind-hearted, could not bear to expose his master’s bluff further. Yet the servants, hearing this and seeing his appearance, burst into laughter. Ding, realizing this, felt a faint blush amid the blackness. One servant brought a small round mirror, smiling, “Master Ding, first see your own face before claiming credit.” Ding, unaware of his changed complexion, looked in the mirror and was shocked. He jumped from bed, shouting, “Everyone come quick! The demon is hiding inside the mirror!”

This caused Bo Gao to laugh so heartily he bent double, pointing at the servant, speechless for a long while.

What Ding shouted next remains to be told in the next chapter.
