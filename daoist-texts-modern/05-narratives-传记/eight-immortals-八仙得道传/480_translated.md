# Chapter Twelve: Master Wenmei’s Incarnation Drives Away the Demonic Fiend; Immortal Bestows Capture into the Imperial Garden

Now it happened that Master Ding took up a mirror to behold his own reflection. Within the glass appeared a creature with a blackened face and fiery red eyes—a sight he never imagined was but his own illusory form. Startled, he blurted out, “Ah! This demon still lurks within the mirror!” His words sparked a burst of laughter among the gathered crowd. 

Elder Bo’gao, ever a man of honest heart and kindness, feared the Master would lose face. Hastily, he ordered his servants to fetch water to wash the Master’s face. Yet, to their surprise, the blackness clung like fresh lacquer, stuck fast upon the skin, refusing to peel away. A sharp-tongued servant standing nearby sneered coldly, “This is the demon’s true reflection upon Master Ding! If not, how could such pale, tender flesh hide a redness beneath?” 

Bo’gao quickly rebuked him, “No nonsense! Go at once to the Lady’s quarters, bring ten taels of silver, and send this Master on his way!” Master Ding, truly vexed by this blackened visage, resigned himself to endure the shame. Only when the silver arrived did he stagger forward, bow in hand, and take his leave.

But let us pause here. Elder Bo’gao, seeing that the Master could not subdue the demon, grew ever more vexed and fearful that outsiders might learn of this and the matter reach the ears of Sun Jie and his son—an embarrassment he could ill afford. Deeply troubled, he wandered in thought. One day, returning from court, he passed through a bustling market street where a crowd had gathered around a certain Daoist. Voices clamored in many directions. 

Bo’gao’s heart stirred; he ordered his carriage halted and pressed on foot into the throng. Watching closely, he soon understood that this Daoist was skilled in wondrous transformations, reversing the seasons themselves. He planted a great peach seed into the earth, and in but a moment, it took root, sprouted branches, blossomed, and bore fruit—many peaches! Though it was early winter, these peaches appeared as if from nowhere. The Daoist plucked them one by one, handing them out to the onlookers, who all declared their flavor exquisite. 

Next, he took a bundle of straw and planted it, which bloomed into an orchid, fragrant and elegant. Then, with a single cabbage leaf, he grew a peony flower, rich and radiant. All these were genuine flowers and fruits, not mere illusions to deceive the eye. Bo’gao watched, entranced. 

When the Daoist finished his marvels, dusk was near. The crowd tossed silver coins to him freely. Smiling, the Daoist waved his hand, and the coins rose from the ground, settling into his palm. Addressing the crowd, he said, “I am grateful for your generosity, but as a monk I have long severed worldly ties, and these coins are of no use to me. Let me do a good deed by taking them to distribute among the poor.”

He looked up and saw many ragged, haggard figures, and said, “You all seem to be the needy; I will give each of you a share.” The crowd eagerly awaited to see how he would divide the silver. But after speaking, he prepared to leave without handing out a single coin, prompting laughter and accusations of falsehood.

The Daoist chuckled, “Please, everyone, check your own pockets.” The poor folk hurriedly searched their purses and, sure enough, each produced a silver coin—the very same they had just given the Daoist. None knew by what means he had returned the money to them.

Only then did the crowd realize this man was truly an immortal descended to the mortal realm. Among them, Bo’gao paid him special heed. After the Daoist departed, Bo’gao followed closely for three or four miles. When they reached a sparsely inhabited wilderness, the Daoist suddenly turned, smiling, and said, “Noble sir, it is no small effort to follow me so far. I am sorry. The sky darkens, and your attendants still wait—should you not return?”

Bo’gao bowed hastily and said, “Great Immortal, how do you recognize your humble disciple? I have some small matters I dared not speak of openly. That is why I followed your divine carriage, hoping to learn the location of your immortal abode, to pay my sincere respects in due time. Yet you have already seen through my actions and concealments. How dare I hide further? I beg you to pause your journey and hear my humble account.”

The Daoist laughed and waved his hand, “No need to explain. I know all. Your household has recently been troubled by a demon who plagues your daughter, yes?” 

Bo’gao, astonished, bowed deeply. “Great Immortal, you possess the wisdom of foresight. I have never done evil or deceived Heaven and Earth, nor offended the gods. How then has this demon come upon us? What manner of creature is it? Is there a method to subdue it? I earnestly beg you to enlighten me.”

The Daoist smiled, “The demon has already confessed everything to you—his true story, no lies. He is originally a flood dragon spirit, a jiao demon, yet he masquerades as a divine dragon. Moreover, the Transcendent Piao, under the Old Lord’s command, and with Erlang Shen, has overseen the case of mountain-moving and sea-filling. With his virtue, how could he not know where the old dragon is imprisoned? How could such a creature escape lightly? It is only because this beast’s time has not yet come, and he is not to be suppressed by the old dragon, that he was released. This is the truth. His claim of escaping by catching others unawares is all nonsense.”

Bo’gao, hearing this as if the Immortal had witnessed it firsthand, was filled with admiration. He knelt and kowtowed, “Master Immortal, your vision spans ten thousand miles! This demon has thrown my household into chaos. Since you know so well, surely we share fate. I beg you to act on my behalf and remove this fiend. My family is forever grateful, and I humbly ask you to grant me a daoist name, Xianxiang.”

The Daoist laughed, “You are honest and simple, yet you speak with mischief. How do you know we share fate? Very well, those who speak of right and wrong are themselves right and wrong. Since I have told you this, perhaps that is the fate you speak of. I cannot help but look into this for you.”

Bo’gao rejoiced and again asked the Immortal’s surname and dwelling. The Daoist smiled, “This demon is so powerful, he knows whether I can defeat him or not. If I could not, why would I give you my name and lose face?” 

Bo’gao laughed, “Master Immortal is too modest. Though I am lowly, I can distinguish right from wrong.” Since the Immortal would not say more, Bo’gao let the matter rest.

The Daoist turned back, and together they returned to their starting point. Remarkably, though Bo’gao had followed for three or four miles before, now the journey back took but a blink of an eye. Knowing this was the Immortal’s art of shrinking space, he dared not question further. The Daoist declined any escort, watching Bo’gao send his carriage away, then took the elder’s arm and strode swiftly forward. In a moment, they were at Bo’gao’s home.

Bo’gao respectfully invited the Daoist to rest briefly in his study, then hurried inside to inform his wife. She fretted, “Master, be careful this time. Don’t cause a scene like with Master Ding and offend him again!” 

Bo’gao replied simply, “This one is truly a genuine immortal from Heaven. There will be no mistake.”

Before he finished, suddenly Huigu burst in fiercely, pointing at Bo’gao and his wife, scolding, “Fine, fine! You are quite the troublemakers. Just now you brought a Master here who upset me greatly! I only spared you because you begged pitifully. How dare you be so rude again and bring out an Immortal? I want to see what sort of creature this Immortal is! How much does he sell for? Is his skill better than that Master Ding’s? Now, let me test my own hand!”

With that, she blew a sharp breath, and instantly the room filled with swirling smoke so thick no one could see across. Bo’gao and his wife heard her say, “You wretched scoundrels deserve to drown in the great flood.” Before they could answer, water rose from the floor—first a few inches, then a foot, two feet, three feet—within a blink it was knee-deep. In the water lurked many fish demons and shrimp monsters, hideous and fierce, clawing to seize them. The house and yard filled with uproar, chickens and dogs in chaos. Bo’gao and his wife sat on their bed, helpless, awaiting doom.

At the direst moment, a thunderous crack split the air like a bolt from nowhere. Where the thunder passed, smoke vanished, and light doubled. Bo’gao opened his eyes and rejoiced, “The Immortal has come to save us! Our lives are spared!” His wife saw a Daoist standing upon the water’s surface, holding a whisk, untouched by the flood, his garments dry as if on solid ground. The Daoist chanted softly, waved his hand, and the waters receded swiftly, faster than they had risen. The ugly demons vanished without a trace.

The Daoist smiled at Bo’gao and said, “The demon has fled; the young lady need not fear. The demon’s grudge lies with your son-in-law. He will surely wreak havoc at the Sun household. I cannot linger but must hasten to aid him.” Bo’gao and his wife knelt in deep thanks. Suddenly, a golden light flashed before their eyes, and the Daoist’s form vanished. The couple was left amazed beyond words.

The Daoist departed, riding clouds straight to Sun Jie’s home. As he prepared to descend, he sensed no demonic aura—surely the demon had not yet arrived. Thinking, “If I come down now, might I arouse suspicion?” he hesitated. Then, looking eastward, he saw a great garden where a swirl of black mist hovered. Hastening forward, he found a woman and an official seated in an empty courtyard at the garden’s eastern end, deep in conversation.

With his enlightened vision, the Daoist knew the woman was the jiao demon, and the official was Sun Xianci, the bat spirit’s reincarnation. Yet he did not know the place nor why Xianci was there. How could the demon know of Xianci’s presence and arrive before him to confront him?

The Daoist transformed into a tiny ant and slipped into the house’s center. There he saw Sun Xianci, seemingly bewitched, held in the demon’s embrace, exchanging kisses and lewd gestures. The demon said, “Dear brother, come with me to cultivate immortality! Soon your foe will come seeking you!” Xianci said nothing, only smiled vacantly.

The demon glanced about, seeing no others, and tried to carry Xianci out. But though no humans were present, the ant suddenly leapt up, instantly becoming a Daoist figure. Grinning, he blocked the doorway and said, “Hold on! Hold on! If you’re going, we go together. Such a fine place—why not bring me along for some fun?” 

The demon, startled, dropped Xianci and fled through the gate. The Daoist did not pursue but called after him loudly, “You jiao demon, you are a spirit of some root and foundation. Turn back now; the great path still awaits. If you persist in error, though I do not break my precepts to kill, others will deal with you. When thunder and lightning fall, regret will be too late!” 

With that, he saw the demon mount a black cloud and escape toward the Eastern Sea. Inside, Sun Xianci regained his senses, standing dumbfounded, recalling the strange events as if in a dream, uncertain what had truly occurred.

Lost in thought, he suddenly saw the Daoist enter. Bowing deeply, he said, “I was bewitched by a demon, made helpless and confused. Perhaps the Immortal foresaw my plight and came to save me? Please grant me a daoist name and explain what has just transpired. I am deeply grateful.” 

The Daoist sat and sighed. “You parted not long ago, yet now you do not recognize your own master. Lost in the red dust, your nature is clouded—how sad and lamentable! Listen well: I am your former master, Wenmei Zhenren. You were once a little bat spirit, now newly incarnated as a human. Your root capacity is unlike ordinary folk. Alas, your birth is humble, and though you will attain the dao, you will face trials and dangers at every turn. Today’s encounter is the grudge from your past life, a matter of fate. This demon should not die by my hand, for his evil is not yet full, and Heaven’s law has not been met. Thus, he was released. In the future, you will likely oppose him again. You must resolve yourself early, see your nature clearly, and not be bound by worldly feelings or enticed by external things. Should urgent troubles arise, I will send aid. You need not worry beforehand, lest it hinder your cultivation. My words are done; now I must leave you.”

Sun Xianci, moved by this teaching, understood his past life and recognized the one who awakened and saved him as his former master. He knelt, tears flowing, and said, “I am deeply grateful for your vast grace. How dare I neglect your teachings? From now on, I will leave my master, bid farewell to kin, abandon office, and retreat to remote mountains and valleys to cultivate. I beg you first teach me the initial steps and secret formulas, so I may steadily progress and not stray from the path.” 

Wenmei Zhenren nodded, “You still have worldly ties unresolved. To renounce all at once may not be possible. When the time comes, fate will compel you. Do not rush now. When you resolve firmly and advance bravely, that is commendable. I will now impart some methods and formulas. Practice diligently, and in three years you will sever worldly smoke, strengthen your sinews and bones, and be well prepared for future cultivation.” 

Sun Xianci bowed again and rose. The master transmitted the methods and formulas, saying, “Until we meet again, strive upward!” Then he transformed into golden light and vanished in an instant. Sun Xianci knelt, seeing the light fade before rising. He did not know where he was, nor why no one had entered for so long. The room was finely adorned, richly furnished, unlike any ordinary home.

As he prepared to leave, he saw outside a vast garden. Deep within the woods, red walls and yellow tiles gleamed, majestic and solemn palaces. Only then did Xianci realize he had been taken by the demon into the imperial garden of the capital. Fear rooted him speechless.

In those days, Yu Shun had long retired, yielding the throne to Xia Yu. Though Xia Yu was also of humble birth and bore no desire to establish a hereditary dynasty, for an official to wander into the imperial garden without cause was a scandalous matter. If questioned, Xianci, as a doctor, could not easily explain how the demon had brought him there unseen. 

He was at his wit’s end, wondering why his master had saved him from the demon’s grasp but not brought him out of the garden. After much thought, he knew lingering was no solution. Better to find a way out and slip away. If no one caught him, the matter would end; if confronted, he would deal with it then. Resolving this, he set off without hesitation.

Alas, though the garden was not vast, it spanned several dozen miles, its paths unfamiliar and direction unclear. After wandering long, he found himself deep within the garden. As dusk fell, the guards returned to their quarters, entering the garden one by one. Xianci grew more anxious.

Suddenly ahead, a woman beckoned from behind a rockery, calling, “Doctor Sun, have you lost your way?” 

Xianci, surprised she knew his name and rank, and that he was within the imperial garden, wondered who she was—friend or foe? He hesitated, unable to answer, his anxiety mounting.

Who this woman might be remains to be revealed in the next chapter.
