# Chapter Thirteen: Testing the Heart—The Young Scholar’s Resolve; The Virtuous Third Sister of Filial Piety’s Wise Words

Now, it happened that the young scholar, upon meeting the immortal Hu Sanjie, felt somewhat timid and hesitant, unwilling to step forward. Yet the maiden smiled lightly, advancing a few steps herself, saying, “Young sir, you are truly so timid! Could it be that you take me, a frail woman, for some fierce beast or demon?” The immortal, seeing her gentle bearing and fair countenance, guessed she was no villain. He returned her smile and spoke of his troubles, beseeching her to point out a way forward. The maiden laughed and said, “I am not from this place either, but the old man who tends the flowers and trees is my grandfather. He often brings me here to wander, so I know well the paths that weave through this garden. Seeing you pacing at the crossroads, your spirit unsettled, I know you must be lost, unable to find your way out. I once lived near you, and every day when you came and went from your mansion’s gate, I always saw you, so I know you well. Since we meet as old acquaintances, how could I not guide you? Yet, to my surprise, you do not recognize me, but suspect me of ill intent. Is that not laughable?”

Hearing her words, the immortal suddenly realized, “So you, lady, are my esteemed neighbor! Forgive my poor eyesight and dull perception for not recognizing your face—how shameful and laughable! Now I beg you, lady, to point me a path so I may leave this garden and return home early. I am deeply grateful!” The maiden smiled, “You are a good man indeed. Hearing you say you are an old neighbor, you know how to ask for guidance. But you have not asked my surname—are you a noble official of the Zhang or Li clans? Your bearing is no small matter.” The immortal was truly abashed, hastening to smile and say, “Indeed, I have yet to inquire your honorable name. In my haste, I neglected to ask—please forgive me.” The maiden nodded with a smile, “That’s more like it. My surname is Hu, and everyone calls me Third Sister Hu. I have no grand title. If you wish, just call me Third Sister.”

The immortal repeated the name Hu Sanjie quietly in his heart, puzzled and suspicious. He thought, “A fine family’s maiden would hardly be so shameless and unrestrained.” He resolved, “No matter! I only seek her to point me a clear path; once I pass through the garden gate, I care not for any other schemes.”

Just as he was about to speak, the maiden laughed again, “Young sir, why such thoughts? I see through your mind—you think me blunt and straightforward, lacking the refinement of an official’s daughter. But truly, sir, you are a man unversed in the world. How many in this world are officials? Aside from those who serve in office, most are farmers, laborers, or merchants, who do not fuss over such formalities! Honestly, I am no official’s daughter, but if I were as bound by rules and etiquette as your household, you wouldn’t leave this garden gate today, nor would you have a chance to meet your old neighbor. It is precisely because I come from humble origins and speak plainly, caring not for empty words, that I recognized your noble bearing before, and now, by chance, can show you the way.”

The immortal, being a man who could not tell falsehoods, could only agree earnestly. By now, the maiden had guided him along a long mountain path. The immortal stopped to take leave, saying, “As I said before, I only seek your guidance in a word or two. I will find my own way out and will not trouble you to escort me further.”

Hu Sanjie laughed heartily, “You officials are always so proud; I cannot abide it. But I will see you a few steps on your way! Many are polite with words, but let me tell you honestly: the paths in this garden are not very twisted, but for a stranger, a few directions will never suffice to find a smooth way out. You see ahead two forks, each leading outside. But the distances and difficulties differ greatly, with bends within bends, forks beyond forks. Without step-by-step guidance, it is impossible to explain clearly. Some places even I cannot describe! Only when you reach a certain point will you understand. Shall I not see you off?”

The immortal hesitated. It was late, and a lone woman and man walking together in this lonely place might be seen as improper. If palace folk spied them, it would bring unjust suspicion upon the maiden. Thinking this over, he grew fearful. Yet the maiden strode ahead, head held high, chest proud, her gait bold and masculine, unlike a refined lady of the inner chambers. He felt a certain awe and fear of her, and so followed with bowed head, hastening along, speaking no more to avoid raising suspicion. But Hu Sanjie paid no heed to his silent worries. After some distance, she turned to speak again. The immortal was helpless, forced to answer briefly and no more.

At last, they emerged from the garden gate. Along the way, they met no one. The immortal’s heart finally settled, and he felt immense gratitude toward the maiden. Just as he was about to thank her, Hu Sanjie anticipated his thought and laughed, “Young sir, now that you have passed the gate, you no longer need me. Will you not invite me to your mansion for tea and snacks? Such a small expense would show that your family is truly one of refined manners and virtue!”

The immortal did not expect such words. In truth, he wished to invite her to express his thanks. But the road ahead passed through a busy street, where many eyes would see a man and woman walking together. What would people say? Yet he was an honest man who would not slight her with falsehoods. To invent a lie would trouble his conscience and tongue. Seeing the maiden confidently lead ahead, he felt some relief that she no longer spoke, so passersby would not suspect their companionship.

Before long, they reached the mansion gate. The immortal’s parents, anxious from his overnight absence, were beside themselves with worry. Seeing their beloved son return, accompanied by a strange woman, they were both joyful and astonished, suspicious and curious. The immortal briefly recounted the events and pointed to Third Sister, saying, “Thanks to Third Sister’s rescue, I could not have escaped the garden today without her help. Who knows what trouble I might have stumbled into!” Sun Jie and his wife understood then and invited Third Sister in, thanking her warmly. Only then did she pay respects to the elders. The household rejoiced, laughter filling the air.

From that day forth, the immortal regarded fame, wealth, and family ties as fleeting smoke, devoting himself wholly to escaping the mundane world and ascending to the immortal realm. Sometimes he shared these thoughts with his parents. Luo Yuan, a person of good root and vessel, knowing the immortal’s divine gifts, naturally wished him to leave the mortal world soon, for the benefit of his parents.

Thus, they did not strongly oppose him. But Sun Jie thought differently. Having longed for a son and prayed to Heaven and Buddha, he was fortunate to have this fine child. From a worldly view, he hoped his son would continue the family line and bring honor. Who expected he would suddenly entertain thoughts of transcendence before marriage? Thus, the couple’s near twenty years of fervent hopes and joy seemed all lost. Sun Jie could not accept his son’s resolve. Father and son grew estranged over this matter. The immortal’s determination was firm; no pressure from his father could change his mind. Sun Jie resolved that unless death parted them, he would control the household affairs and forbid his son from such transgressions. The greatest conflict between them was over marriage. One side refused to wed; the other urged swift union. The hardest was the lady Luo Yuan. From this issue arose a curious little tale:

Since rescuing the immortal, Hu Sanjie, favored by his parents, was invited often to visit. She came daily, growing close to the immortal. With her beauty and wit, she anticipated his needs, managing all his affairs flawlessly, without waiting for him to speak. The immortal, straightforward and sincere, treated her well out of gratitude. But Sun Jie and his wife each had their views. Sun Jie saw his son’s reluctance to marry and his fondness for Third Sister and assumed he wished to wed her instead of Luo’s daughter, hoping that by encouraging the dao, he might halt his son’s monastic ambitions. Though silent to the Luo family, this was a great relief.

Holding this hope, Sun Jie did not resent Third Sister’s forwardness but sought to foster their closeness, often teasing her with double meanings. Third Sister played coy, neither fully understanding nor rejecting him, merely humoring him. But Luo Yuan saw through her son’s nature, knowing he was not lustful. She judged Third Sister as greedy for wealth and status, despising her, mocking and scolding her to drive her away. Yet Third Sister, thick-skinned, came daily, entangling herself with the immortal. He remained aloof, neither close nor distant. This confused Sun Jie greatly.

One day, unable to bear it, Sun Jie secretly invited Third Sister and asked if she would marry him. She agreed at once. Sun Jie was delighted. The immortal, repeatedly requesting to leave home, had lately shut himself indoors practicing qi refinement. As the only son, Sun Jie did not want him to abandon wealth and status for the dao. He entrusted Third Sister to counsel him well. Seeing their affection and knowing Third Sister would marry into the family, he thought this the best solution. He planned to negotiate with the Luo family to break the engagement, promising not to wrong Third Sister.

Third Sister listened calmly, “I admire your talent, sir, and am grateful for your favor. I am willing to serve you and counsel you. But since the betrothal to Lady Luo was first, how can it be broken? Let me persuade you to change your heart; then marriage will not be too late.” Sun Jie rejoiced and watched their interactions closely.

Day after day, seeing no change, the immortal continued his qi refinement. Puzzled, Sun Jie thought to urge Third Sister, pondering how to phrase it. One evening, pacing in the corridor, he saw Third Sister enter the immortal’s room. He did not question how she came in, thinking tonight might be the night. He crept near the window to eavesdrop.

After a while, no sound came. He wet his tongue and peeked through the paper window, laughing and fuming. The immortal sat on a mat, eyes closed, calmly practicing. Third Sister stood nearby, playing mischievous tricks—sometimes bending low, sometimes leaping about, never leaving his side. Amusingly, the immortal seemed oblivious, focused on his practice. When he finished and opened his eyes, Third Sister mimicked a child worshipping Guanyin, crouching before him and smiling up with a most enchanting, bewitching expression.

Outside, Sun Jie nodded, murmuring, “Now this is interesting,” watching intently how the immortal would respond. The immortal opened his eyes wide but showed no alarm, asking slowly, “Why have you come again, Third Sister?” She shifted closer, her face almost touching his waist, smiling sweetly, “So you mean I should not come?” He shook his head seriously, “You should come, but not at this hour. You are clever and prudent; do you not know to avoid suspicion between man and woman?” She twisted her body softly, voice seductive, “Why such foolish talk, sir? Life is but to seek joy. A hundred years pass in a flash. If not to enjoy youth, then when? When old, the vigor fades, and one rots with grass and trees. Who says you must be so proper? Good sir, do not be so obsessed. A fine night and good fortune are rare! We met by chance and became close not by accident. Surely fate binds us. Your strictness wastes my goodwill.”

The immortal neither grew angry nor alarmed, sitting calmly on his mat, shaking his head, “Third Sister, I appreciate your kindness. The more I accept it, the more I dare not let you become a fallen woman. Each has their own resolve; one cannot force another. It grows late; your lingering is of no benefit. If others inside learn of this, your reputation will suffer.”

He lowered his head, silent. Outside, Sun Jie was desperate, wishing to burst in and command his son, “This is what I want; you must not disobey me!” He pondered, then grew angry again. Looking inside, he saw Third Sister sigh, then suddenly display a woman’s secret art. Tears flowed freely as she sobbed, “I am no lowly woman. Today’s matters were not meant to be licentious. You threaten me with others’ knowledge, but I come on orders, to see the master, with no fault. Do not speak of that. Tell me, sir, how do you interpret ‘each has their own resolve’?”

The immortal smiled, “Third Sister, do not argue. You are clever; do you not know I have rejected even my betrothed wife? For what reason? Could I have any improper dealings with you?”

Third Sister laughed heartily, “So you mean your quest for immortality? How ridiculous! Even if true immortals exist, how could a delicate body like yours endure the hardships of cultivation? And what of your parents, who have cared for you so long, hoping you would marry and bear heirs to continue the family line? Such sincere affection! If you truly seek the dao, you must wait until your parents have passed, your children grown, so you may ascend with a clear conscience, roaming the eight directions and four seas freely. Then, you may choose your own path, and I would not dare say a word against you. But now, your heart and your father’s are opposed. I hear if you resolve to leave, your father would fight you to the death. Can you bear to commit such a crime against your father?” She paused, glancing at the immortal, whose expression flickered with unease.

Outside, Sun Jie was delighted, almost shouting. Third Sister pressed on, “Why do you not speak? Do you not believe my clear words?” The immortal’s face returned to calm; he laughed aloud, “That is what it means to each have their own resolve!” Third Sister was stunned, then said, “You say this, so I see you have no change of heart. Let me tell you: if you truly have great root and vessel, you know my dao power now could make me your master! Ha! There is an immortal before you, yet you refuse to bow, insisting on entering the mountains and forests, abandoning parents to seek uncertain immortals. That is foolish beyond measure.” The immortal was startled, looking up to gaze at her.

Third Sister laughed, “I know you do not believe I have dao power, but this is no idle talk. You may test me as you wish. Once you recognize me as an immortal, you should bow to me as master and obey my instructions. Can you do this?” The immortal replied seriously, “Third Sister, do not jest. If you are truly an immortal, you would have your famous mountains and caverns, with many things to do. Why then do you spend every day with a mortal like me?”

Third Sister laughed joyfully, “You, sir, are truly the cleverest fool. Honestly, I come for your future! Immortals prize childlike bodies, but some marry and bear children without harming their cultivation. Those who forget their parents’ deep grace are most hated by immortals; even with ten lifetimes as children and a thousand years of practice, they never reach true attainment. You are wise and learned; have you ever heard of an immortal unfilial to their parents?”

Sun Jie’s legs ached from standing outside, but hearing this, he felt enlightened and joyful, forgetting his fatigue, watching intently again. Inside, the immortal opened his eyes and studied Third Sister long, then closed them again in silence. Seeing his resolve, Third Sister nodded unconsciously, then suddenly grew angry, ignoring all else. She seized him like an eagle clutching a chick, lifting him from the mat. The immortal offered no resistance. Surprised that the usually gentle Third Sister was a warrior woman, he said, “Third Sister, do not be rough. I am not one to be seduced or coerced into betrayal! Even if you kill me, I will not regret.”

Third Sister called out, producing a small sword that suddenly lengthened tenfold, its cold gleam chilling the marrow. Holding the hilt, she pointed at the immortal, “No soft words! It must be force. I give you one moment to answer. If wise, marry me at once, and I will teach you all my immortal arts so you may become immortal. If not, this sword will not recognize you as noble sir!”

Seeing her skill, the immortal knew she was a master swordswoman. Yet how could such a swordsman be so humble? His heart was torn. Outside, Sun Jie trembled with fear. At first, he wanted to burst in and defend his son, but seeing Third Sister’s ultimatum, he waited for the final answer, knowing she cherished the immortal and would not harm him lightly. He grew bold again.

The immortal said resolutely, “So you are truly a sword immortal. I have been remiss! But I swore before my master never to touch woman’s allure. If I break that vow, my master’s sword light would be fiercer than yours. Even from a thousand miles away, one flash would end me. Better to keep this precious body and, if struck down by you, meet my master in the netherworld, who may pity my steadfast heart and find a way to save me. Then I would not blame you, Third Sister.”

Third Sister, seeing his resolve, turned anger to joy. She stepped back three paces, sheathing her sword, smiling softly, “You truly are extraordinary. To be frank, all this was to test your resolve. You are young and your dao power shallow, yet you have such courage and determination. Your future is boundless. I have been remiss.” The immortal felt a great weight lift and smiled, bowing in thanks, “Third Sister is indeed a superior immortal. I am unworthy and ignorant, and my earlier words were rude. Please forgive me.” She laughed, “Though so, your fate with Lady Luo is heaven’s decree; it cannot be avoided. If you trust me, the sooner this worldly bond ends, the better.” The immortal said nothing. Outside, Sun Jie was bewildered as if lost in a thick fog.

What Third Sister’s final thoughts were remains to be told in the next chapter.
