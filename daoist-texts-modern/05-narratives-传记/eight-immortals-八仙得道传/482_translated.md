# Chapter Fourteen: Husband and Wife Cultivate the Dao Together, Flesh and Blood Breed Strange Hearts

Now it happened that Sister Hu San did not know by what means she persuaded Immortal Sun Ci once again, and miraculously, she spoke so well that Immortal Ci himself agreed to take a wife. Sun Jie and his wife knew well this was Sister San’s doing, and naturally they were grateful to her. Sun Jie had long worried about succession, unwilling to have his son leave the family to become a recluse. Now that Immortal Ci consented to delay his monastic path, who could have foreseen that Lady Luo Yuan, like an old clam birthing a pearl, suddenly bore another son? On the eve of her labor, she dreamed of a creature neither dragon nor dragon, neither flood dragon nor flood dragon, rushing into her womb; upon waking, she cried out in labor pains. Sun Jie had already hired a midwife to reside in the household, ready for the birth. The midwife, sensing the moment was near, applied a slight procedure, and in an instant, the fruit ripened and fell—indeed, another son, a strong male. The couple rejoiced beyond words, especially Immortal Sun Ci, who, having vowed to become a recluse, now found a successor to carry on the incense, and was even happier than his parents. That night, Sister San came again, and Immortal Ci gladly told her of the new brother. Sister San smiled and said, “This is indeed cause for joy, yet you should not rejoice too quickly. Do you know your brother will be as filial, loyal, and true as you?” Immortal Ci replied, “Sister San, you jest too cleverly! How can you be sure my brother is not a good person?” Sister San only smiled and said no more.

The following year, Immortal Ci married Miss Bo. On their wedding night, the young couple sat and talked the entire night through. Afterwards, they treated each other with respect and love, clinging closely as if siblings born of the same womb, never showing any improper behavior. Sun Jie and his wife could not help but watch them carefully. Since Sister San had revealed her otherworldly nature that day, Luo Yuan knew she was no ordinary woman and entrusted her once more to urge Immortal Ci to enjoy the joys of marital harmony early, to embrace the happiness of offspring. Sister San laughed, “At first, you only wished your eldest son not to leave the family for the cloister. Now that you have a second son, you want the eldest to bear noble children soon. Is this not a matter of uneven conscience?” The couple laughed, “The younger son is still too young; who knows when he will marry? Now that the eldest has a wife, how could we not hope he will blossom and bear fruit!” Sister San smiled, “This is your private matter; no one else dares speak. Since you entrust me, I shall come again when the time is right to say a few more words. If the eldest son listens, that is best. If not, do not blame me, you two elders.” With that, she smiled and left.

At the hall’s gate, Immortal Ci came proudly, and upon seeing Sister San, stretched out his hand to stop her, inviting her to sit in his chamber. Sister San, seeing Miss Bo absent, asked, “Where is your new lady?” Immortal Ci replied, “Probably upstairs. Sister San, where are you rushing off to?” Sister San smiled, “I came specially to pay respects to you two!” Then she relayed the words entrusted by Luo Yuan and her husband, laughing, “I advise you, young master, to settle for a little, be a happy person in the mortal world, and that’s enough. Why must you leave your homeland, endure hardship and suffering, chasing after a godhood that is not necessary? Besides, you have married this young lady, she is in the bloom of youth—would you have her endure this lonely, desolate life alone with you? You are too hard-hearted.” Immortal Ci laughed heartily, “Sister San, you come to test me again! If I sought worldly riches, why would I quarrel with my father so? Even the matter of marriage was because you repeatedly persuaded me, saying Miss Bo was no common woman, not one given to lust or desire! Now that she is my wife, she can become your dao partner in the future. Because I believed your words, knowing you are a true immortal who would not deceive, I dared boldly to marry her.”

Before Sister San could finish, she laughed again, “So you married her, and then what? Does the young lady force you to do anything? Has she asked you to perform those husband and wife affairs?” Upon hearing this, Immortal Ci’s face reddened slightly, and he smiled, “I said Sister San would not deceive me, so I dared to entrust everything to you!” Sister San laughed, “If so, you should obey my instructions in every word. Now I want you to quickly have a little baby with your new lady, so I can go see the two elders and report the good news. Can you promise me?” Immortal Ci laughed, “Sister San, you are truly amusing, always trying to make me laugh. Now you say this—don’t say your disciple would never dare obey, but my wife certainly would not agree. If you don’t believe me, you women should ask her and see how she answers. Shall we?” Sister San smiled, “You are quite the trickster, knowing you and the new lady have agreed to be heavenly immortals, not earthly lovers. Even if I speak plainly, your lips will outmatch my tongue. You ask me to hit this nail on the head. You are really something.” Immortal Ci nodded, “You speak truly. Miss Bo is indeed a woman of great root and foundation. Since hearing my disciple’s persuasion, her heart has become transparent. Lately, she follows me diligently day and night in practice. Sister San, what you just said was but a joke; even if you wanted to plead for my parents, you would only meet a brick wall. I can say for certain, it would be of no effect.” Sister San laughed, “That’s right. I have reckoned that this brother you have is a great demonic kalpa in your life palace. But without this kalpa, you would never have trusted the dao so deeply, and it would be hard to break free from the family circle. Your father will never allow you to leave the family for the cloister. If you disobey him, it will truly bring life-threatening trouble. You would become an immortal, but bear the guilt of unfilialness—can you bear that? Moreover, from ancient times to now, there has never been an immortal who was unfilial! In this, your younger brother must create an opportunity for you, so you can fulfill filial duty above and be true to yourself below. He has no good intentions, but you truly benefit from him. This is a heavenly secret, not to be spoken lightly. I tell you this roughly now; keep it in your heart and you will see it come true. Normally, I would not tell even you or myself, but knowing you will not change your heart, I casually say these few words. You need not tell your wife.” Immortal Ci nodded in agreement.

Several days later, Sun Jie met Sister San and again mentioned this matter. Sister San casually brushed it off, and that was that. From then on, Immortal Ci continued his official duties, returning home to care for his parents and wife, embracing his younger brother, and enjoying the full happiness of family life. Yet his brother, the flood dragon boy, was different in temperament and disposition. In a blink, the flood dragon boy was already twelve years old, remarkably clever. If called dull, he was cunning in all things, always able to pick faults before his parents, leaving his brother and sister-in-law utterly dispirited, and every word and action appeared sincere. One could not help but believe he was a loyal and honest person. If called smart, he did not understand right from wrong. Though his brother and sister-in-law treated him with great kindness, he persistently opposed them.

By this time, Sister Hu San rarely visited the Sun household, coming at most three or five times a year to teach some secret formulas to Immortal Ci and his wife, testing their progress. Immortal Ci was a loyal, filial gentleman; Miss Bo was a broad-minded, virtuous, and filial woman. Though clearly suffering great losses from the brother, and receiving no kind words from their parents-in-law, even with the obvious difference in treatment between brothers, they bore no resentment. Only Master Wenmei had promised to send someone to guide their cultivation path at any time, but no news had come. Immortal Ci repeatedly asked Sister San. Sister San only said, “Immortals never lie. You must work diligently and wait quietly. No need to be so impatient.” Immortal Ci had no choice but to give up.

One day, it was Luo Yuan’s birthday. Immortal Ci, knowing his mother’s origins, specially bought many field snails to release. Unexpectedly, the flood dragon boy saw this and also bought some snails, had them cooked, and presented them to Luo Yuan, saying, “Big brother made this bowl of snails especially for mother’s birthday.” This sentence struck Luo Yuan’s sore spot, making her so angry she could hardly speak. The flood dragon boy feared that if Luo Yuan saw Immortal Ci, she would scold him outright and the matter would be exposed, so he said, “Mother, please hold back your anger. I heard sister-in-law has a wicked plan to make you lose face. Now I am investigating how she intends to arrange this; I already have some clues. Let me find proof, then accuse her of disobedience, and she won’t be able to deny it.”

Luo Yuan and her husband had long fallen into the flood dragon boy’s scheme and now deeply hated Immortal Ci and his wife. So they believed every word he said. Seeing him speak thus, they readily agreed. Poor Immortal Ci and his wife never dreamed their own parents and in-laws would suspect them so. Moreover, the flood dragon boy’s heart was too sinister—while stirring strife, he also silenced the parents from speaking out, leaving Immortal Ci and his wife unable to defend themselves even with a single word. The couple could only sigh sorrowfully to each other.

Though young, the flood dragon boy had made many friends among practitioners of the outer arts and learned several methods of nightmare demons. At this time, Uncle Bo was ill. Immortal Ci and his wife went to visit, staying three days. Uncle Bo’s illness worsened, so they stayed a few more days. Taking advantage of this, the flood dragon boy prepared many nightmare spells, inscribed with his parents’ birth dates, pierced with silver needles, and slipped under his sister-in-law’s bed, beneath mats, and in various filthy places. Then he performed his rituals. Sun Jie and Luo Yuan suffered heartache and headaches, vomiting blood. The flood dragon boy said, “Someone must be using illusion magic to harm my parents.” Sun Jie did not believe at first and invited a Daoist to examine, who said it was indeed an evil spell. Sun Jie angrily said, “My wife and I have always been kind and never harmed others. Who would be so cruel?” The flood dragon boy feigned doubt, “Exactly. Our family is loyal and kind. If there is an enemy, it must be one of our own. Only brother and sister-in-law often harbor resentment because parents do not favor them, but why would they resort to such poison? Using nightmare magic requires the person’s birth date and time. How could outsiders know? Even the servants would not understand.”

This struck Luo Yuan deeply. Women of the household believe such things most of all. Taking advantage of Immortal Ci and his wife’s absence, she took the flood dragon boy to search their rooms and indeed found much evidence of evil magic. Luo Yuan’s anger this time was fiercer than before. Sun Jie, seeing the evidence was conclusive, also believed it must be the doing of Immortal Ci and his wife, and immediately burned the items. Their ailments then improved.

In great anger, Sun Jie ordered the flood dragon boy to go to Uncle Bo’s house and summon Immortal Ci to punish him for disobedience and unfilialness. The flood dragon boy hastily stopped him, “Father, if you want to accuse him of disobedience, you must not destroy the evidence. Without proof, mere words mean nothing. Besides, he is now an official, protected by officials. This lawsuit is sure to fail. Better to pretend ignorance and keep them at home. If they know the plot is exposed, they will plot anew, which we cannot guard against. It is better to send something to big brother, saying it was sent by someone else, and mother remembers big brother and specially sent it for him to eat, but it contains poison to kill him first. Sister-in-law is only a woman; how much power can she have? When she returns home, we can find ways to deal with her. Wouldn’t that be perfect?”

Sun Jie and Luo Yuan, furious and unthinking, agreed and sent a package of snacks to Immortal Ci. Immortal Ci planned to share some with his parents and cousins. The flood dragon boy said, “Mother only gives these to big brother. Sharing with others means not enough. If big brother does not eat them himself, it would betray mother’s loving heart.” Immortal Ci thought this reasonable and ate some carelessly, leaving the rest for the flood dragon boy to take back.

That night, Immortal Ci suddenly felt his heart break, vomited torrents of blood, writhed and cried out wildly, turning and tossing in agony. Uncle Bo and the family were desperate. Uncle Bo’s illness was grave; after this shock, he bade farewell and passed beyond, his feet stretching out as he returned to Heaven. Miss Bo had just seen off her father’s end and, seeing Immortal Ci’s face change, his life hanging by a thread, had to leave her dead father behind and rush her dying husband home. The two households were over ten li apart; halfway there, suddenly Immortal Ci shouted once, and his soul followed his father-in-law’s spirit, racing toward the gates of the underworld. Miss Bo, grieving her father’s death and now her husband’s loss, was overwhelmed with sorrow, vomited blood, and her spirit left her body, faint and unconscious. Pitifully, the couple, who had not yet attained the Great Dao, together journeyed to the realm of shades.

What wonders befell them after death, we shall see in the next chapter.
