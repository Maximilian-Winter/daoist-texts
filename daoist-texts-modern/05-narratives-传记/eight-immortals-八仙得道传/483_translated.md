# Chapter Fifteen: The Thousand-Year-Old Fox Reveals Cause and Effect; The Young Noble Severes Worldly Ties

Now, it happened that the immortal couple, Xian Ci, were traveling halfway along their journey when both suddenly met their deaths. The escorting laborers, one and all, were struck with helpless anxiety. Suddenly, a fierce wind arose, swirling about in every direction. In an instant, Heaven darkened and Earth dimmed; the sunlight lost its glow. Sand and gravel flew wildly through the streets; smoke and mist enshrouded all. Travelers on the road could not see one another across the way. The escorting men of the Bo household had no choice but to find a place to take temporary shelter, leaving the two dead bodies inside the carriage.

After the passing of about an hour, the wind died down and the clouds dispersed, revealing clear skies. The group hurried back to the carriage to look for the two corpses. Strange indeed, only an empty carriage remained—no trace of the bodies anywhere.

This fright struck the group even more fiercely than before. With no other recourse, they seized some local people as witnesses and scattered to report to the Bo and Sun households. Lady Bo, having lost her beloved son-in-law and daughter, was overwhelmed with grief, needless to say. Even Sun Jie and his wife, though they had long harbored hatred for the immortal couple due to the intrigues of Jiao’er, upon hearing of their deaths and the disappearance of their bodies, could not help but weep for a time. Luo Yuan also sobbed bitterly. Only Jiao’er was quite pleased, saying, “Mother need not grieve. Their manner of death shows that the Dao of Heaven is unerring, revealing all the more their cruel hearts! Otherwise, why should one die and the other perish alongside? After death, not even their bones return home! Such unfilial people deserve their fate! If their parents mourn, that is truly foolish!” The old couple, hearing this, found much truth in the words and after shedding a few tears, ceased their lament.

Leaving that matter aside, let us first speak of Sun Xian Ci, who died poisoned. His wandering soul, confused and drifting, was carried by the wind through countless places. Suddenly, a voice called out sharply, “Sun Xian Ci, where is your roaming soul?” Startled, Xian Ci’s spirit steadied. Though he knew himself dead, he hastily opened his eyes and saw before him a woman dressed as a Daoist maiden, holding a jade tablet, smiling warmly as she tapped him on the shoulder: “Old friend, long time no see. Do you still remember Sister Hu San?”

Xian Ci’s wandering soul was delighted and did not treat her lightly. He hurriedly asked, “Sister San, whence do you come? Why have you not visited my home for so long? Now your disciple has been wronged and slain by brothers’ treachery, fulfilling your former words. Since you have met me here, I beg your great mercy—please lend your aid!” Sister San smiled, saying, “If not to save you, why else would I be here? No need for many words—come quickly with me. I will take you to a good place and slowly explain the cause and effect of all this.”

Xian Ci felt both joy and sorrow, unknowingly following Sister San. His body was like a leaf blown by the wind, light and helpless, unable to control itself. Fortunately, he never left her side, never drifting elsewhere. Soon they arrived atop a mountain peak where three stone chambers stood. Sister San entered, and Xian Ci followed. Bowing to her, he said, “Your disciple has long been ignorant, daily facing great teachers yet never knowing how to show reverence or take refuge. Now, as a wandering soul with no home in the Ten Directions, I earnestly beg Sister San to remember our years of companionship and kindly accept me into your fold. I would be most honored!”

Sister San smiled quickly, “Nonsense! You need not be so humble, noble sir. Please sit, and I will relate the full story of cause and effect. Do you know who I am?”

Xian Ci sat, puzzled and deep in thought, unsure how to answer. Sister San sighed, “You truly are a man of great intelligence, though momentarily befuddled. You and I are neither kin nor acquaintances, yet I have taken great pains to manage your many trivial affairs. Recall the words your honored master Wenmei Zhenren spoke in the Imperial Garden—then you will know our connection. It is not a direct friendship but a mission entrusted to me, with all matters reported accordingly.” Xian Ci suddenly understood, “So then, Sister San is indeed sent by my master to watch over me? Is that so?” Sister San laughed, “Only now do you realize? I am the Old Fox of the Western Mountain. Long ago, I strayed into evil paths, committing many misdeeds, twice suffering the calamity of thunder and fire. Later, by the grace of Master Zhenren, I was spared a terrible fate. Before him, I swore a solemn oath to reform, to cleanse my heart, and to devote myself sincerely to the Great Dao, begging to be accepted as his disciple. Yet the Master hesitated, fearing my evil nature would not change, that old habits might return and bring harm. Thus, he delayed acceptance. Only after my persistent entreaties did he permit me, for a hundred years, to serve as his emissary, running errands and carrying out orders. If I prove sincere and faultless, then he might accept me fully. My first mission was to come to you, to guide you at all times. It was partly a test—should you waver or transgress, I would report back, and the Master would strike you down with a flying sword or punish you with thunder and fire!”

Hearing this, Xian Ci shivered and composed himself gravely, “Fortunately, I have not wavered. Had I fallen into Sister San’s trap back then, I would not only be unworthy to face my Master now, but perhaps never see Sister San again!” Sister San laughed heartily, “After repeated tests and trials, the Master is convinced you are sincere and single-hearted, a true gentleman without distraction. Therefore, I have taught you many vital formulas and even revealed some of your fate in advance. This is to encourage you to strive with utmost effort, undaunted by peril, unyielding through all setbacks.” Hearing this, Xian Ci rose and bowed eight times, deeply thanking his Master, then again expressed gratitude to Sister San. She smiled and stepped aside, saying, “No need for such formality! Though you have my guidance and care, I also rely on you to achieve some small merit, so I may report to the Master. If you are so courteous, then I must thank you for your kindness in return.”

Having finished speaking, Sister San and Xian Ci sat facing each other. She then asked, “Do you know why your younger brother opposes you so fiercely?” Xian Ci looked puzzled, “Indeed, I have not been distant from my brother. I do not understand why he harbors such jealousy.” Sister San sighed, “This is the principle of cause and effect. Do you know what your brother is a reincarnation of?”

Xian Ci pondered long and hard, then suddenly stamped his foot, “Ah! I understand now. No wonder my mother dreamed at childbirth of a great beast, neither dragon nor not-dragon, neither flood dragon nor not-flood dragon, who leapt into her arms to bear my brother. My father said, judging by the dream’s form, if not a flood dragon, then surely a sea dragon—hence the name Jiao’er! Alas, we were all too foolish. Though we heard the strange dream and my father unwittingly chose that name, clearly pointing to the cause and effect, I could not piece it together. Is that not strange?”

Sister San laughed, “If human wisdom could grasp it, it would no longer be the Dao of Heaven.” Xian Ci was silent a long while, then said, “So then, my brother was not truly born to the Sun family, but came solely for revenge! Yet I wonder, after revenge, can he abandon evil and honor my parents?” At these words, tears welled and fell.

Sister San smiled coldly, “Such good fortune is rare! You are a man of benevolence and filial piety, suffering such injustice yet still mindful of your parents. This alone surpasses many merits. But your father and mother are truly foolish by nature. Now, having believed your brother’s words and lost you, soon they themselves will suffer at his hands. No good end awaits! The time is not far—just wait and see!” Xian Ci wept, “So my parents’ lifelong toil is wasted; their descendants are lost and ruined by their own son. How tragic! Sister San, since you come by Master’s command to save your disciple, might you also save my parents? I would be forever grateful!”

Sister San spat and laughed, “You speak nonsense again. Fate is fixed; human power cannot reverse it. Your parents have such a fine son as you—how could their descendants be light and empty? Do you think that by leaving home and ceasing to bear children, the line ends? The purpose of having offspring is to ensure the bloodline continues after death. But if one can live forever, sharing Heaven and Earth’s longevity, why need descendants? The preciousness of life lies in becoming an immortal and realizing the Dao for this very reason!”

Xian Ci said, “My father is a renowned good man, and though my mother comes from a different kind, she has never done evil, only supporting my father in good deeds. Why then this calamity?”

Sister San replied, “That is hard to say. According to cause and effect, often the events of many lives determine one lifetime’s outcome. People judge the present by one’s current deeds, missing the mark by a hair or a thousand miles. Though your parents are good people now, they do not know what they were in past lives. Take your mother alone: I know well that when she was a field snail spirit, she killed countless creatures and lured young men to harvest their primal yang and replenish her essence. Fortunately, she cultivated some magic to transform humans and things, great and small, so such harvesting was not rare. Yet such selfish harm is not permitted by Heaven’s Dao. If such deeds could lead to immortality, then the heavens would be a den of evil. Though I cultivated a human body and behaved similarly, I suffered two thunder calamities—proof of Heaven’s punishment. Law is law, Dao is Dao. Though the law may be fulfilled, if the Dao is not followed, the result is harm to others and self. My evil was slight; by Master’s mercy I escaped death and reformed. But your mother, having cultivated magic and shape-changing, how could she fall to an ordinary man and nearly lose her life? This is Heaven’s way of punishing through others—using people as instruments of divine justice. Luckily, your father and grandmother were benevolent and filial, like my meeting with the Master, escaping eternal calamity. Then your mother should have awakened quickly, cultivating Dao and merit to atone. But for decades she has done nothing remarkable, no good deeds to show, never once observing a day of Dao or fasting. Recently, she trusted a worthless son and poisoned a fine child. Though you bear no grudge, the Heavenly Lord of Justice has judged this a great crime, and she will surely be punished. This is the law of cause and effect—deep and obscure, beyond human knowing; subtle and unexpected, beyond human thought. Judging by appearances alone, how can one be accurate?”

Xian Ci, hearing that his mother suffered partly for his sake, felt ashamed and grieved, crying out in despair. Sister San sighed, “You are truly a filial son and a good man. No wonder the Master values you so. The Master, knowing present and future, said your mother will still rely on you for deliverance, and you will have the chance to repay her. But now you must apply yourself diligently, cultivating the Dao. Do not worry about other matters. Even your parents’ fate, though born of your filial heart, is already explained. You must let go and focus on your proper work. If you cling as before, constantly worrying and attending them daily, why become a Daoist at all? The Master also said your hopes are great, but so are the demonic calamities. Your cultivation now differs from your past life: then you rose from the animal path to the human path; now you move from human to immortal form. The higher the status, the harder the cultivation, and the greater the future achievement. Understand this well, advance diligently, and do not be burdened by worldly dust. Only then will you not fail the Master’s expectations.”

Xian Ci bowed deeply in acceptance. Suddenly he remembered his wife and smiled at Sister San, saying, “I am not attached to conjugal love, but this virtuous woman was once praised by Sister San as a promising talent. Now, I wonder if she has returned home? Might I beg Sister San to guide her in cultivation so she may also achieve some small success? That would not be ungrateful to your kindness.”

Sister San laughed loudly, “Just now I praised you, and now you make trouble! You clearly cannot let go of your wife, yet you place the burden on me. I refuse to meddle or seek to accomplish anything! If you love Yu Cheng, wait until you become immortal and realize the Dao, then go save her yourself!”

Xian Ci knew Sister San’s playful nature and quickly smiled, pleading, “Sister San, do not be so stubborn! You are so compassionate—surely you would not leave good deeds unfinished? My request is but a needless worry. No wonder you are displeased. Now I dare not ask more! But please, just tell me how she fares now.” Sister San smiled and told him that Huigu had already died. Hearing this, Xian Ci burst into tears again, sobbing aloud, crying, “I have harmed her! I have harmed her!”

Sister San stood silently, watching him weep. Then suddenly she laughed wildly, wagging a finger at Xian Ci: “Truly a man of feeling and loyalty! Seeing you so pitiful, I cannot help but take some responsibility. I will send you back to heal her and bring her here, so you may be husband and wife once more. How about that?”

Xian Ci, caught by this teasing, blushed deeply, swallowing his tears and snot, too embarrassed to speak, staring blankly at Sister San. Seeing his sincerity, she relented and said, “Miss Bo’s character and temperament are rare even among immortals, a top-tier talent. Her success will surpass yours. Now another junior sister of yours has taken her as disciple. Her former life was as a flower attendant fairy in the Jade Emperor’s palace. During the Jade Emperor’s longevity celebration, all immortals rejoiced. For some unknown reason, she quarreled with an incense attendant fairy and offended the imperial will, resulting in a ten-life banishment. She must undergo ten reincarnations, not losing her true nature, before returning to the celestial bureaucracy with added promotion. As for her relation to you, when she descended to the mortal realm, you were also on your way from the underworld. At the same time, your adversary, the old flood dragon, knowing of your imminent descent, rushed ahead to spy on you. The fairy, being beautiful, was mocked by the old flood dragon. In her distress, you arrived just in time, roused righteous anger, and with the aid of escorting underworld soldiers, drove off the flood dragon and saved the fairy. She was deeply grateful and vowed to repay you, thus forming this karmic bond. This was no coincidence. Now that she has repaid her debt and you have fulfilled your part, this old grievance is settled. You need not entangle with her further, lest you invite your own demonic obstacles. If the Master learns of this, he will scold you again. Remember this well.” Xian Ci listened and gratefully bowed.

Sister San then tidied the three stone chambers for Xian Ci, instructing him to cultivate there. She herself returned to Western Qi to report to Wenmei Zhenren.

Time among immortals passes swiftly. In the blink of an eye, four or five years passed. Xian Ci’s Dao heart grew firm and his foundation deepened. His cultivation advanced more easily than others. By now, he could sever worldly ties and thoroughly comprehend his nature. Each year, Wenmei Zhenren sent Sister San to teach him various methods for summoning spirits, dispatching generals, and protecting the body. Xian Ci mastered them all.

One day, while sitting in meditation to nourish his qi, he suddenly heard a voice beside his ear: “The field snail spirit is in danger. Will you not quickly repay your debt?” Startled awake, Xian Ci opened his eyes to find none other than Hu Sanjie once more.

What danger the field snail spirit faces will be revealed in the next chapter.
