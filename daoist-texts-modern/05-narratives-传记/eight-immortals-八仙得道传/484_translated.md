# Chapter Sixteen: The Filial Son Descends to the Sea to Seek the Snail Spirit; The Fox Immortal Enters the Palace to Pay Homage to the Dragon King

Now it came to pass that Immortal Cisi saw Hu Sanjie arrive and hastened to rise and greet her. Sanjie smiled and said, “You always speak of repaying parental kindness, yet now your mother has been drowned by your younger brother in the Huai River, and your father died last year from anger at that same brother. Do you not wish to return and see them?”

Immortal Cisi replied, tears streaming down his face, “Your disciple has long received the Master’s precepts: the six senses are pure, untouched by myriad dusts. At times in stillness, a fleeting thought arises only of those two dear parents at home. Yet I steadfastly guard Sanjie’s injunctions and follow the Master’s teachings. Beyond single-mindedly refining qi and purifying the heart, I entertain no other thoughts. Nor do I dare to leave the place of cultivation on my own, lest I invite external demons and troubles. The circumstances and the feelings in my heart are surely clear to both Master and Sanjie. Now, at Sanjie’s direction, I know my family has suffered this grievous calamity; both parents have met with misfortune. I do not cling to the red dust of the world, nor harbor any thought that would cause me to abandon my path. Only in the plight of my parents do I feel the bitter wish that I might sprout wings and fly swiftly to see them once more—only then could my heart find peace!”

Sanjie smiled and said, “That flood dragon, reborn as a mortal, has taken special delight in opposing you. Since you left, he has joined a heretical sect and learned demonic arts, often able to transform his original form and stir up mischief. Your mother was no one without cultivation, yet she could not withstand his single curse: ‘From whence you came, return thither!’ Poor woman, after decades as a mortal, she remains but a single field snail, cursed and bound, unable to come and go freely. Though you have studied the dao for many years and know some techniques, to resist him is like striking a stone with an egg—sure defeat. Even if you go, you must first have a method to subdue the flood dragon spirit.”

Immortal Cisi did not answer this but first sought to know how his parents were harmed. Sanjie said, “Between Heaven and Earth, the forces of righteousness and evil each hold their own strength—righteousness has its proper sects, evil its own factions. Ordinarily, evil cannot overcome righteousness. Yet when the kalpa of tribulation arrives, even the superior person cannot always protect themselves; evil seizes the opportunity and may overthrow the good. This flood dragon, though unrighteous in conduct, having joined a certain sect, has his own band of followers—turtles and tortoises, soft-shelled turtles and terrapins—who guide and protect him, ensuring he does not lose his demonic nature and remains on the path of demons. Moreover, their aim is to refine methods, not the great Dao. The method is easy, the Dao difficult; Dao is the root, method the branch. Cultivators need not speak of method, yet method encompasses all. But great achievement is rare and cultivation arduous. Those who practice method may succeed in that, yet remain far from Dao; when encountering one who has Dao, all methods are broken. Yet in cultivation, compared to method practitioners, one is often constrained by method, not that Dao is weaker than method. Because method can be learned piecemeal, Dao requires entire devotion. Until Dao is attained, it is as if not learned; how can the unlearned resist demonic arts? What we study is the true Golden Elixir Dao of the immortals, whose profound secrets no reckless little demon could even dream of. Yet before Dao is achieved, one cannot but fear somewhat the power of demonic arts!”

Immortal Cisi suddenly understood: “Your disciple sees now—the flood dragon must have received guidance from those comrades and learned to use demonic arts, so my mother could not counter the spells and was instead cursed and bound. As for my father, utterly without cultivation, naturally he was no match.”

Sanjie nodded: “Your father, because the flood dragon delighted in associating with rogues and doing all manner of evil, when he reproved him a few times, was pushed down. The aged man could not bear the injury and died within a day. This happened last winter. After your father’s death, your mother, having a body suited to the arts and still as graceful as in youth, drew the covetous gaze of the demon, who sought to commit unnatural acts. Your mother bit his finger, and their bond was broken. The flood dragon, having learned some spell from somewhere, took out your mother’s stubborn shell and displayed it in the main hall, waiting for her to come out. Then he chanted a curse: ‘Tap tap tap, old mother snail shell, enter enter enter, old mother snail spirit. Old snail, old snail, quickly reveal your true form. If you do not reveal your form, under the sword return to the netherworld.’ Upon finishing these words, marvelously, your mother suddenly vanished—she had been drawn into the snail shell and returned to being a snail. What a cruel demon, keeping the snail in the pond, intending to cook and eat it. But Heaven truly has its grace: a sudden great rain washed the snail from the pond into the Huai River. This startled the flood dragon, who dared no longer entertain thoughts of cooking her. Using talismans and spells, he sank her into the Huai River, forbidding her to emerge for one thousand years. Now your mother suffers greatly!”

Immortal Cisi wept bitterly: “What sins did my parents commit to deserve such cruel fate? May I ask, Sanjie, can your humble disciple still meet with my parents?”

Sanjie’s face grew serious: “How could it be otherwise? To be frank, it is by the Master’s decree that I bring you to enter the Huai River to see your mother. Otherwise, why would I come to tell you this long tale?”

Immortal Cisi asked again, “After seeing my mother, relying on the Master’s divine power and your magic, surely we can save her from danger?”

Sanjie shook her head: “It is not so easy. The Master said your mother’s past misdeeds were not few, and this is her due retribution. Yet fortunately, she has you, her son, to help her greatly. The Master instructed me to pass on to your mother a cultivation method: she must refine that stubborn body until it can expand and contract at will—large enough to transform the snail shell into a cavernous sea palace, housing a thousand-person Daoist assembly, befriending the Dragon King of the sea. Only then will her Dao be complete, and she escape the path of beasts. This is the blessing hidden in her calamity. But the Master said she has no connection to the snail spirit, so this aid is all for you. After you attain the Dao, you must travel the world, achieve three thousand merits, and repay Heaven’s grace on her behalf! But you must delay ascending to the heavens for one thousand years and reenter the cycle of reincarnation as a mortal. The deeper the root, the easier the immortalization! Can you agree? Only then can the Master entrust you with the great method for your mother. Otherwise, the Master would not trouble himself for a demon with no affinity. What say you?”

Immortal Cisi wept and bowed: “If only to save my mother, your disciple is willing to remain a wandering immortal who saves and delivers others forever. To forgo ascending to Heaven is no complaint! Moreover, only one thousand years! But there is one more question: my father is now in the netherworld—may I, with your help, visit him?”

Sanjie nodded: “Your father was kind-hearted and did no evil in this life. His untimely death was due to karmic debts from a past life. Once those debts are cleared, he will be reborn in a fortunate place and enjoy great blessings. You need not worry about him further.”

Immortal Cisi said, “Though you say so, my heart still longs to see my deceased father’s face once more, to find some peace.”

Sanjie pondered: “Very well! The Master only sent me to bring you to see your mother, not to guide you through the netherworld. But I have a splendid plan. I heard the Master say your father, though a good man, has no immortal fate and must be reborn fifteen times in wealthy, kind families. When your thousand years are fulfilled, I will petition the Master to allow you to be reborn as his son, so that after a thousand years you may be father and son again—a tale for the ages! This will also ease your heart. How does that sound?” Immortal Cisi rejoiced and thanked her deeply.

He asked about the flood dragon’s fate. Sanjie shook her head: “That one is a demon by birth, already in a heretical sect, destined for great evil. Others will deal with him in due time. No need for us to trouble ourselves.”

Immortal Cisi said, “One who kills brothers and fathers, who curses and imprisons his own mother—does that not count as great evil? Should such a one not be punished, lest he harm others still? Is Heaven’s way too lenient?”

Sanjie replied, “That is a great Daoist topic. Let me briefly explain. As I said, when the kalpa is set, not even Heaven can alter it. Like the four seasons, day and night, cold and heat, wind and rain—humans wish for endless sunshine, warmth, and long days without night. Yet birth and death, growth and decline, all have their fixed measure. Even the Jade Emperor, the Primordial Heavenly Worthy, the Venerable Lord Lao, and the Buddha of the Western Paradise cannot force change. How much less can mortal beings meddle with yin and yang! The kalpa is just such a principle. In worldly terms, governance and chaos alternate; the world cannot be orderly without disorder. So too Heaven’s way cannot have only good without evil. The flood dragon you see is fierce and cruel, seemingly unforgivable, yet countless evil demons arise from the kalpa. Their lives have cause and effect. Your mother’s case is not pure righteousness on either side—each side strikes and falls, like beasts fighting for territory, with no justice or reason. Because of you, the Master must labor so much. Otherwise, who would have such leisure to care for these matters?”

Immortal Cisi felt both ashamed and moved. He followed Sanjie out the cavern gate. Sanjie pointed with her hand, and two white clouds drifted down before them. Smiling, she indicated one: “You may mount this one.” She herself stepped onto the other. Turning, she saw Immortal Cisi standing on the cloud, seeming somewhat timid and trembling. She laughed: “You always long to ascend to Heaven, but can Heaven be reached without riding clouds? Why, now that you are on the cloud, you feel uneasy?” Immortal Cisi smiled: “Sister Sanjie, your dao is profound; seeing clouds come and go is but a trifle. For one like me who has long sought this, once attained, I feel overwhelmed with favor.” Sanjie laughed heartily, and together they soared upward. She urged him to be bold and not afraid, for she would accompany him side by side.

Along the way, Immortal Cisi asked her to teach him the art of cloud-riding. Sanjie laughed: “Your learning is in the Dao; when Dao is attained, all methods succeed. These are mere minor skills. We, who have mountains of evil and no merits, though now abandoning evil for righteousness, can only learn small defensive tricks akin to illusions. When you succeed, you will surpass us. This is no empty praise; the Master has said so. Among our sect, none can match you!”

Hearing this, Immortal Cisi felt uneasy: “Why do you praise me so? It makes me feel embarrassed.” Sanjie smiled without replying and said, “This cloud-riding seems simple but has great subtleties. As your skill grows, you will face demonic invasions. Such ordinary arts must be learned first. But until the Great Dao is achieved and the body transformed, how can a coarse mortal frame ride clouds? This requires a spell. When you succeed, your heart will be beyond the clouds, your person among them; wherever you wish to go, auspicious clouds will rise beneath your feet. You will no longer need to beckon as I did, nor utter spells.” Immortal Cisi understood and nodded. Sanjie taught him the secrets of cloud ascent and descent on the cloud, which he comprehended fully. He then asked, “Can anyone use this spell to soar to Heaven?”

Sanjie laughed: “Nonsense! The path of immortals is separate from mortals. True immortals would never casually share such secrets with common folk. There is one heretical sect whose disciples are few but unruly, all demons and ghosts, without proper discipline. They have their own cloud-riding spells, but different from ours. Before I joined the Master, I met many of them, all of this sort. They also learned cloud-riding and other transformation and escape arts. Whatever the orthodox Dao has, the heretics often have a version too. But their methods differ entirely. This shows that even heretics have their origins and foundations. We must not underestimate them!”

Immortal Cisi nodded in respect and asked, “Is there anything swifter in the world than cloud-riding?”

Sanjie said, “Cloud-riding has speeds and slownesses. Today, we travel slowly so you will not be dizzy and so we may talk. Still, it is millions of times faster than mortal walking. Yet cloud-riding is not the fastest. The fastest can circle the four seas and nine continents daily. Long ago, Lady Xuannü refined the five-colored treasure sword, uniting sword and spirit. Wherever the spirit goes, the sword follows. The sword is not like mortal iron, mere weapon of killing, but refined to emit light, even to the point of having light without sword. Where the light reaches, so does the sword, able in a moment to fly from the southernmost to the northernmost place. Its use is to slay tyrants and demons, and to transmit messages. When heart and sword unite, the sword’s light can display thoughts or writings, sending them thousands of miles away. This is the sword’s great accomplishment. Those who wield it become immortals; the sword endures kalpas unbroken, and the wielder lives through generations. Today, four schools remain—Red, White, Blue, and Black—each with founders and disciples, their fame rivaling our immortals. Sadly, the Blue and Black schools have fallen into the hands of beasts. It is said two ape-like leaders trouble the Red and White schools, but the Red and White sword arts are deeper, so no great harm comes. This is like the balance of orthodox and heretical sects, like yin and yang coexisting without one prevailing. Such is the way of things!”

Immortal Cisi was amazed and said, “I always thought cloud-riding the swiftest, not knowing there is something swifter still. Tell me, Sister Sanjie, with such sword immortals, can our teachings contend with them?”

Sanjie laughed: “How could it be! Our Daoist arts are orthodox, with founders profound as Heaven and Earth, all-encompassing and invincible. For worldly matters yet unseen, they have known for centuries past. Even by speed, across the nine provinces, the Five Sacred Mountains, and the deep four seas, the founders’ minds encompass all; why need the sword’s light? That is the use of the Great Dao, incomparable by other powers. Yet by power alone, the sword light is fastest. I heard the Master say that in five thousand years, human progress will bring many immortal arts to the world. Then the founders will ask Lady Xuannü to transform sword light into electric power, enabling instant communication and letter transmission across thousands of miles. This the founders told the Masters. If we have fortune, we may achieve an imperishable body. Five thousand years will pass in a blink, and we will see it yet!” Immortal Cisi nodded in understanding.

Just as they were enjoying the discourse, Sanjie suddenly tapped his shoulder: “We have reached the Huai River. We flew from the southern sea, traveling over a thousand li. Try now to recite the cloud descent spell and see what happens.” Immortal Cisi silently recited it once, and sure enough, the cloud lowered and settled on the riverbank.

Joyful but mindful of his mother’s suffering, tears again fell. Sanjie paid no heed and pointed to the water, where amidst surging waves appeared a smooth, flat path. Sanjie led Immortal Cisi along it.

After half an hour’s walk, Sanjie said, “Ahead stands a palace glittering with gold and jade—that is the crystal palace where your old friend dwells. We must first pay him a visit to entrust him with all matters.” Immortal Cisi knew she spoke of past lives; the old friend was the Dragon King Pinghe, as the Master had said. He smiled: “If an old friend, we should visit, especially to ask for help!” Sanjie led the way to the crystal palace. At the gate, sea patrol yakshas barred their path. Sanjie explained their purpose and pointed to Immortal Cisi: “This is the great king’s old friend.” Hearing this, the yakshas dared not delay and bowed, then struck the great announcement bell thrice. From within came many aquatic officials—Minister Gui, Strategist Li, and others—who verified their names and invited them inside. Soon a message came: “The great king requests to see two old friends!” Sanjie and Immortal Cisi, accompanied by water officials, respectfully ascended.

Dragon King Pinghe already knew Immortal Cisi was the bat reborn as mortal, and rose to greet him. Sanjie and Immortal Cisi prepared to bow deeply, but the Dragon King laughed: “We were old friends once; now we are no longer affiliated. No need for such formalities! Your politeness only makes us strangers.” They all bowed lightly. The Dragon King retired to the rear palace, ordering a feast prepared for honored guests. Truly, the Dragon Palace was rich beyond mortal comparison. In moments, dishes and delicacies were arrayed. The Dragon King sat beside them, inquiring into Immortal Cisi’s affairs since parting. Immortal Cisi recounted the bat’s humiliation by the old flood dragon, the virtuous immortal’s help in reincarnation, and the old flood dragon’s renewed persecution, telling all. The valiant Dragon King’s beard bristled, his crown shook, he slammed the table and roared fiercely. Immediately he ordered ten thousand aquatic soldiers to scour all water palaces for the old flood dragon, to punish him severely and avenge his old friend.

Hu Sanjie quickly rose, smiling to restrain him: “Great King, do not be hasty. This little demon is hardly worth your divine troops. When his sins fill the world, Heaven’s punishments will come. Now is not the time; stirring the troops may be futile. Please, Great King, temper your thunderous wrath.” The Dragon King growled: “If what you say is true, do demons have no fixed lifespan?” Sanjie’s face grew serious: “Though demons may lack fixed fate, Heaven has set measure and destiny. Tyrants and demons arise according to the kalpa; while the kalpa lasts, mortal power cannot restrain them. When the kalpa ends, they perish without battle. Why should the Great King trouble himself?”

The Dragon King was displeased. Immortal Cisi pleaded earnestly. The Dragon King stroked his long beard and chuckled: “Very well! Since you both say so, I need not trouble him. Yet as an old friend of Sun Jun, I feel uneasy seeing him wronged and unable to help.” They spoke kindly to soothe the Dragon King’s anger, and all drank heartily. Sanjie then told of Immortal Cisi’s quest to find his mother.

The Dragon King said quickly, “That is easy. No need for you to go personally; I will send men to find her and rescue her. Mother and son will meet here—would that not be splendid?” Sanjie smiled: “Great King’s kindness is deeply felt, but the snail spirit is bound by the flood dragon’s spells and cannot move freely. Moreover, her calamities are great and must be endured. The Master said she must complete a thousand years of cultivation within her stubborn shell, with a great Daoist assembly held by masters for seven days and nights, before she can escape disaster. Though suffering now, it is her chance to cultivate. With the Master’s immortal formula, her future is limitless. To rescue her now would hinder her cultivation—love would harm her. Yet under the Great King’s rule, the long thousand years may be free of demonic invasion, allowing her to focus on cultivation. Thus I bring Sun Gongzi to pay respects and ask the Great King to instruct the Huai River deity to protect her at all times. Sun Gongzi is most grateful!”

The Dragon King agreed wholeheartedly: “Such small matters need no special orders.” He summoned his two chancellors to meet them and personally ordered the matter handled. He appointed Minister Gui to lead eight patrol yakshas to escort them. Both were deeply moved and thanked him. The Dragon King laughed, “You two are too polite! I grew up in the wilds, rough and straightforward—no need for such ceremony!” All laughed. After the feast, the two took their leave and, accompanied by Minister Gui and four yakshas, departed the Dragon Palace, heading toward the Huai River’s mouth.

How the mother and son’s reunion fared remains to be told in the next chapter.
