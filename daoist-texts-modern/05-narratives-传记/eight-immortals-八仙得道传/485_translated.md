# Chapter Seventeen: Immortal Sun Bestows a Meeting with His Mother Beneath the Sea; Zhang Guolao Reincarnates to Become an Alchemist

Now it happened that Sister Hu Sanjie, accompanied by Immortal Sun, together with the great official Gui dispatched by the Dragon King and the patrolling sea yakshas, arrived at the border where the Huai River meets the sea. The yakshas reported, “This domain of waters is called Huaihai Village. To the east, it falls under the governance of the Huai Deity; to the west, all is vast ocean, now under the jurisdiction of the sea gods newly appointed by our great lord. May we ask, Great Immortal, where does the friend you wish to visit reside?”

Upon hearing this, Sister Sanjie quickly gave Immortal Sun a knowing glance, then said to the yakshas, “We are most grateful for the great lord’s graciousness in entrusting you to escort us here. Now that we have reached the place itself, it is a small locale and it would be improper to disturb you further. Please return to report the mission’s completion; we shall find our own way henceforth.” The yakshas, eager for the reprieve, all turned to the great official Gui, asking, “How shall we proceed?” But Gui was unwilling to continue as well, so after some polite hesitation and half-hearted excuses, they took their leave.

At this, Sister Sanjie smiled and said to Immortal Sun, “Those brats think we have come to pay homage to some exalted guest, not realizing we are but a locked-up field snail! Such creatures are all petty and self-important—no need to invite their ridicule!” Immortal Sun agreed.

The two then employed the Water Dividing Secret to find the bottom of the Huai River. There, they beheld a great field snail buried in the earth, with only its opening barely protruding, just enough to stretch out its head a little, to breathe faintly, and to wait for passing little insects to catch and eat. Immortal Sun immediately knew this was his birth mother, and his heart ached so deeply that he could not help but weep bitterly. Sister Sanjie hurriedly said, “Do not weep! Do not weep! I will announce your arrival for you, and help your mother recognize you, her son.”

Following her words, Immortal Sun bent down and lifted the snail shell floating on the mud’s surface. Sister Sanjie called out loudly, “Luo Yuan! Luo Yuan! Your banished rebellious son, Immortal Sun, has come to find you!” The snail stretched its neck out a great length, gazing toward the surface. From its expression, it seemed to understand the matter. After a while, the snail’s neck touched Immortal Sun’s head, as if clinging, remaining still for a long time and unwilling to leave. Such a scene naturally signified deep affection. Immortal Sun pressed his face against the snail’s flesh and wept aloud.

After a long while, Sister Sanjie explained the past events to him and conveyed their master’s intentions, urging the snail to endure this thousand-year grievous tribulation, which could serve to cultivate body and establish destiny, forging an imperishable body. She continued, “All this is because in your previous life you committed too many sins, and now you must suffer severe retribution. Yet, because of your son, you have the chance to walk the proper path—a misfortune that is also a blessing. Now I shall teach you the cultivation formula. You seem naturally gifted; if you apply yourself day and night, in no more than three hundred years you will be able to leave your stubborn shell behind. The power of talismans and incantations will no longer bind you. But you still cannot leave the water’s depths; you must endure another five hundred years. When your功行 is eight or nine parts complete, no demons or heretics will be able to harm you. You may dwell beneath the sea, using your stubborn shell as your grotto. After a thousand years, when功行 is perfected, then you may reunite with your son. You will also invite enlightened and virtuous adepts to hold a grand daoist ritual, to liberate the many resentful ghosts harmed by your poison. Then your karmic debts will be cleared, your future smooth, and no more accidents will occur.”

The snail spirit listened attentively and nodded vigorously to express thanks. Sister Sanjie then transmitted the incantations to her. When all was complete, Sister Sanjie said, “This place is not suitable for lingering; let us return!” Immortal Sun had no choice but to comply. After another affectionate farewell to the snail and many words of encouragement, they turned back, emerged from the water’s surface. Sister Sanjie said, “Your great matter is done; hasten back to Tiantai to attend to your own功課.” Immortal Sun agreed. Sister Sanjie instructed him to recite the Cloud-Riding Spell himself, and together they rose into the air, hastening southward. In but a moment’s time, they arrived at Tiantai, returning to their cave abode. Sister Sanjie took her leave.

At parting, she solemnly admonished, “Young master, your responsibility grows ever greater. Since you have resolved to save your mother, you must rescue her from the sea to complete your great task. Yet all this depends on your功行. Though this life will be arduous, your next life will still hold considerable blessings. For five hundred years, focus solely on your cultivation. After five hundred years, though you may not become an immortal, you will have considerable法力. Then you should go forth to roam the lands, relieving suffering and aiding those in distress. Fulfill your allotted功行, and your master will send you to reincarnate among mortals. After that rebirth, as long as your original heart remains unclouded, in a few decades you will ascend to immortality and the Dao.”

Immortal Sun promised each point, then asked, “When功行 is fulfilled, will I no longer fall into the mundane?” Sister Sanjie replied, “Even if you cannot! Have you not heard that once the Heavenly Emperor, for a single moment of greed, sent a soul to descend and undergo kalpas? When功行 was nearly complete, he could have ascended immediately, but out of a single thought of compassion, unwilling to abandon his son, he reincarnated once more. In subsequent lives, due to the impurity of the six senses,功行 failed at the last moment, until the final time when a hundred thoughts turned to ashes, his nature and spirit became perfectly clear, with no lingering attachments, and only then did he ascend again, becoming the Great Emperor Perfected Martial. Even with the Jade Emperor’s exalted favor and such profound roots, he could not harbor a single worldly thought. How much less ordinary people, much less you and I, born from the animal path, just newly entering the human realm! By ordinary rules, at the first glimpse of the mundane, you would immediately turn back. At that time, your Dao heart is unsettled, your道行 shallow; after one more life, you still cannot escape the mortal net. Even after ten lives, you cannot guarantee a good ending. Though success will come eventually, human desires are easily stirred, the danger too great. It is better to endure some hardship first, and when功行 is perfected, undergo one more reincarnation. Then nothing can easily invade you, and many dangers are avoided. Is this not a once-and-for-all labor? You must understand this is no accident; it is your master’s deep thought and far-sighted care, arranging everything so thoroughly and flexibly!”

Hearing this, Immortal Sun was even more grateful, utterly devoted until death, weeping aloud, “My master cares so deeply for this disciple; I do not know how I shall repay such kindness in the future!” Sister Sanjie comforted him, “Since you understand your master’s painstaking care, you should know your master’s highest hopes. We disciples, so long as we do not disappoint our master’s expectations, have repaid our master. Does the master truly need our repayment?” Immortal Sun tearfully agreed, then asked, “Where shall I go now?” Sister Sanjie smiled, “Go first to Mount Xiqi to see Master Wenmei, receive further instructions, and await later orders. Likely your affairs are not yet finished; I may still be needed.” Immortal Sun said, “That is natural. I am the one Sister Sanjie has personally nurtured and cared for. As long as my功行 is incomplete, Sister Sanjie’s concerns will not end. That is certain.” Sister Sanjie laughed, “It is not so simple. I know nothing of other matters, but I do know that after a thousand years, I will find a daoist friend to serve as the ritual master for your mother’s daoist altar. That has long been settled.” Immortal Sun asked no more, seeing her out the cave’s gate. Because she represented their master in instructing him, she was not treated as an ordinary fellow disciple, but with the reverence due a teacher, kneeling to see her vanish before returning to his cave.

Sister Sanjie arrived at Xiqi and presented herself to the Perfected Wenmei. The Perfected was pleased with her careful work and from that day forth accepted her as a disciple, giving her the dharma name “Tonghui” (Penetrating Wisdom). Tonghui thanked him and remained by his side to serve. The Perfected instructed her to visit Tiantai every few decades to check on Immortal Sun’s功行.

Five hundred years later, the Perfected personally descended to Tiantai, teaching Immortal Sun the Great Way of Qi Refining and Elixir Burning. He also bestowed two celestial scrolls containing the Five Phases concealment methods and all transformations and applications, summoning generals and dispatching spirits, subduing demons and monsters. After a hundred years of practice, the Perfected ordered him to roam the lands widely to establish功行, laying the foundation for this life and creating good karmic ties for the next. After several more centuries, when his道行 was complete, the Perfected’s wise heart silently moved, already knowing that Sun Jie had reincarnated more than ten times. After over a thousand years, through the Xia and Shang dynasties, he had now descended into a wealthy family surnamed Zhang in Luoyang, aged about forty, yet without offspring. The Perfected then commanded Immortal Sun to descend as his son to fulfill a long-standing vow from a thousand years before.

This Zhang man was named Tiancheng, and his only son was simply called Guo. That Zhang Guo was none other than Immortal Sun in a previous life. Because of deep karmic roots, he was born able to speak and unusually intelligent. At about ten years old, Perfected Wenmei dispatched the female daoist Tonghui to instruct him. Zhang Guo immediately awakened. Tiancheng was a lifelong philanthropist, enjoying blessings for over ten generations. Having Zhang Guo as his son filled him with joy. Tonghui feared that he might obstruct Zhang Guo’s cultivation in the future, and also worried that his功行, having eaten its karmic roots for a thousand years without turning back, might grow ever more base, eventually falling into the sea of suffering. So when instructing Zhang Guo, she brought a few words of warning.

Zhang Tiancheng understood the cause and effect of past lives, and seeing Tonghui gliding like clouds and mist, with boundless法力, deeply believed that true immortals existed in the world. Immortals were also made by mortals. He not only rejoiced that his son was born with immortal roots, but also thought of himself, fearing that when his blessings were full, he would reincarnate to suffer again. Thus he resolved to cultivate the Dao, often speaking of this intention to Tonghui. Tonghui rejoiced, “A layman who gains an immortal son had original immortal affinity in a past life. If you yourself believe in the Dao, your accomplishment will surely be remarkable.” She also taught him some cultivation formulas. Father and son united in spirit and purpose, jointly fostering the Daoist aspiration. Tiancheng distributed part of his family wealth to the poor. After his wife—Zhang Guo’s birth mother—passed away, Zhang Guo, under Tonghui’s guidance, was instructed to join Tiancheng to go to the Huai River to resolve the great case of the field snail spirit.

Though Zhang Guo was still young, the功夫 he had established in his past life was like a book read in childhood; growing up, a little review sufficed to apply it. Unlike his father, who was a novice in immortal formulas with no功夫, relying entirely on guidance. The father and son agreed to meet Tonghui in Huaihai Village. Tonghui also went to thank the Dragon King for his thousand years of care. Because in the latter five hundred years, Luo Yuan’s power had grown greatly, often venturing out to the sea. When seeing aquatic creatures in danger, she did her utmost to assist. Once, a group of merchants sailing out of the Huai River mouth encountered a sudden great wind; the twenty or so aboard nearly capsized. Luo Yuan happened to be traveling nearby, and seeing this, quickly used her shell to support the boat’s bottom, carrying the great vessel to safety, saving over twenty lives. Yet this exposure drew the attention of an old flood dragon’s fellow demon. One wielded a steel whip and gave chase. Luo Yuan, seeing the pursuer close, was struck on the head by the whip. The blow was slow in coming but swift when it arrived. At that moment, sea gods who had heard the alarm rushed to aid Luo Yuan, raising a golden cudgel to block the attack. A fierce battle ensued, driving off the demon, allowing Luo Yuan to return safely to the sea bottom.

Later, Luo Yuan’s cultivation neared completion, and she fashioned her stubborn shell into an underwater grotto. Within several hundred li nearby, a brilliant, colorful radiance shone forth. Many demons believed a rare treasure had appeared in the sea and came to attack. Fortunately, the Dragon King had forewarned her and dispatched three thousand divine soldiers to guard the entrance to Huaihai Village, ensuring safety. Such old friendships are indeed rare and precious.

At this time, Tonghui arrived at the Crystal Palace to see the Dragon King. The Dragon King, already aware of her purpose, first expressed thanks for her efforts. Tonghui smiled, “I am but a humble Daoist sent specially to thank the great lord’s old friend. Why does the great lord thank me first?” The Dragon King laughed heartily, “We each assist old friends; no thanks are needed. I have heard that Luo Yuan, following the master’s instructions, is building a daoist altar in her newly made grotto. I wonder which dharma master presides?” Tonghui replied, “That matter was settled by our master five hundred years ago. The altar will be overseen by a crippled Daoist surnamed Li. This person has some direct and indirect karmic ties with your noble old friend. That crippled immortal’s previous life was an incense officer in the Jade Emperor’s palace. Due to careless words, at the Longevity Banquet he joked with a flower attendant. Both were punished to descend through ten kalpas. The flower attendant’s first incarnation was as the wife of your noble old friend Immortal Sun, now Luo Yuan’s daughter-in-law, who is building the altar. These two exiled immortals have undergone ten kalpas of reincarnation. Now that their term is complete, if they remain true to their nature and cultivate proper fruit, they may return to the heavenly bureau with honor, not merely resuming their original posts. The heavenly heart is most compassionate; the previous punishment was decreed by heavenly law, unavoidable. Having seen their ten kalpas as mortals, all loyal, kind, and filial, the sages’ hearts greatly pity them. Thus it is certain they will succeed. The current flower attendant was born in Jiangnan with the surname He, a recent birth. The present incense officer was born in Henan with the surname Li, said to be a descendant of the Lord Laozi Patriarch’s clan. Since Pangu, the Patriarch has often reincarnated as a mortal. In the past hundred years, he was reborn in Ku County and took the disciple Perfected Wenshi. Just as the incense officer’s tenth incarnation was born, the Patriarch dispatched Wenshi to instruct and care for him. Thus this Li immortal’s swift attainment is an unprecedented marvel among cultivators. The Patriarch has personally accepted him as a disciple, keeping him within his own school. This man’s future is truly boundless! The Zhang Guo I mentioned, and Immortal Sun, share some indirect immortal affinity through Immortal Sun’s wife, the flower attendant.”

The Dragon King nodded and smiled, “Indeed! I know all about the nine incarnations of the flower attendant and have even rendered some minor service to her!” Tonghui had no time to ask further, continuing, “Though this is no great matter, in immortal rules, any small connection between two parties is called affinity. Thus this crippled immortal and the present Zhang Guo may be said to have slight prior affinity.” The Dragon King laughed in agreement and added, “A daoist altar inside a snail shell is truly an unprecedented marvel. After all, the immortal family’s wondrous uses differ from all others. Such a grand occasion surely calls for Master Wenmei and many celestial officials to attend. I myself will also personally come to partake in this rare and once-in-a-lifetime grand ceremony! But I wonder, has the date been fixed?” Tonghui said, “The date is not yet set. Probably after their own meeting settles it, I will be sent to invite the ritual masters to begin. Even if the great lord is busy, we will surely come to extend a strong invitation.” With that, all laughed together.

Having finished speaking, Tonghui bade farewell to the Dragon King and hurried to Huaihai Village. There she saw the village had changed greatly. Once a desolate place where fish and shrimp would not come, now because the snail shell shone forth, aquatic beings with some minor daoist功夫 from far and wide traveled thousands of li to witness this marvel. At the same time, water-dwelling merchants, skilled in commerce, seized the opportunity to open a marketplace. In less than ten years, the once barren Huaihai Village had become a bustling sea market. Tonghui saw this scene and could not help but nod in approval.

Soon she arrived at the grotto formed by Luo Yuan’s stubborn shell. The cave dwelling was still shaped like the original snail shell. Its entrance was a great round door, bending and twisting inward, winding and spiraling until finally reaching a small back door. The doors were also round. Inside, the space was vast enough to accommodate several thousand people comfortably. Luo Yuan had fully become human and lived in the central chamber. The dwelling was divided into three rooms, with corridors on either side connecting front and back. As for the furnishings and utensils inside, though not overly splendid, they felt elegant and refined. Tonghui thought, “By this arrangement, it is quite suitable to welcome many immortals.”

While she was inspecting here and there, the attendants inside had already spotted her and swiftly reported it. Luo Yuan herself came forward first, followed by Tiancheng and his son, to greet her together.

Dear reader, if you wish to know how a daoist altar was made inside a snail shell, who this crippled immortal really is, and what his connection is to the Lord Laozi Patriarch, the matter is so extraordinary and the story so long that it cannot be told in a single moment. We must wipe the table and begin anew, writing from the start to bring order and clarity. Please be patient and do not scold the writer for leaving you in suspense!
