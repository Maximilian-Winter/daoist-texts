# Chapter Eighteen: The Golden Mountain Becomes an Ancient Relic — Repaying Virtue in the Next Life

Last time, the tale spoke of the wondrous and solemn Daoist altar fashioned inside a conch shell, a curious and exquisite story. The nun Hui Tong once said that the chief master of that altar was a lame immortal surnamed Li. Now, it is time to unfold the history of this lame immortal—his origins, his successful attainment of the Dao, and his deeds of rescuing the suffering world. Alongside him, the fairy He, bound to him by fate, must also be recounted.

Do the gentlemen and ladies know that in Chinese geography there is a famous mountain suspended alone in the river? That mountain is called the Golden Mountain, yet it is not a naturally formed peak. Thousands of years ago, it was not even a hill rising above the plain; it was not even ordinary land. It was merely a vast expanse of water flowing in the middle of the Yangtze River. Until the middle of the Zhou dynasty, on the riverbank stood a large village. In that village lived a gentleman named Ma Shangyuan, who half-read, half-farmed, living a semi-reclusive life without official post. He had a daughter, graced with both virtue and beauty, whom everyone called Miss Ma.

When the young lady turned eighteen, she married a scholar surnamed Gu from the same village. He was a poor and destitute man of letters, and he had a fierce and unbearable stepmother, Madam Yu. At first, the relationship between the daughter-in-law and the stepmother was not so bad. But later, Madam Yu saw that the neighbors and relatives treated the eldest daughter-in-law with warmth and closeness, while she herself was left cold and distant. She did not realize that this estrangement was due to her own harsh temper, unlike the gentle nature of the eldest daughter-in-law. Instead, she suspected that the eldest daughter-in-law was speaking ill of her behind her back. From then on, the bond between them cracked and broke.

Madam Yu was born with a heart full of prejudice, a prejudice so fixed that no matter what, it could not be undone. Though the eldest daughter-in-law diligently cultivated filial piety, hoping to soften the stepmother’s resentment, Madam Yu said, “She deliberately hides her treachery, putting on this act for outsiders. But in her heart, she holds a sharp dagger, wishing to stab me to death!”

The eldest daughter-in-law, wronged so grievously, dared not speak to her husband. The scholar Gu was a dutiful son, knowing well of the discord between mother and wife, yet he dared not criticize his mother’s faults, nor even offer a word of comfort to his wife. When he saw his wife’s sorrowful face, he reproached her for showing such distress and losing the favor of the household elders. Thus, the days grew harder and harder to endure. With the enmity between stepmother and daughter-in-law, the son caught in the middle was naturally in an even more difficult position. A once harmonious family was filled with clouds of sorrow and gloom.

Year after year passed unknowingly—six or seven years in all. Madam Yu’s treatment of the eldest daughter-in-law grew ever crueler, her methods ever more strange and vicious. To recount all her countless wicked deeds would be no great task for a writer, but this book is not about household affairs; the story of the Gu family is but an incidental record, so it is best kept simple and free of offense. Enough has been said in a word.

The scholar Gu, saddened by his own helplessness in managing the household, and knowing that his wife was a woman of virtue, reasoned that since she suffered daily from the stepmother’s unreasonable beatings and insults, how could he bear to fan the flames and oppress her further? Yet Madam Yu, besides personally tormenting the eldest daughter-in-law, would scold her son day and night, accusing him of failing to help his mother chastise his wife, branding him a rebellious son who favored his wife over his mother, a grave offense indeed. The poor young couple was thus driven into a corner, with no way forward or back.

At first, the scholar Gu had indeed sided with his mother against his wife. But as his mother’s cruelty worsened and his wife’s body was bruised and battered, his heart ached. Who would not feel pity for the one with whom they shared bed and pillow? Yet his mother still branded him disobedient. How could he endure such days?

Heaven does not utterly forsake people, however, and left him a path of survival. Though the household provided the stepmother’s commands and three meals a day, the young couple often went without a full meal—sometimes no supper after lunch. In winter, the stepmother would not allow even a trace of cold to touch her, while the couple shivered in rags, barely clothed, huddling together in misery. Hunger and cold, the hardship of cooking, and the threat of beatings left the couple gaunt and hollow-faced, like restless spirits from the hungry ghost realm.

The scholar Gu knew these hard days could not last forever. He and his wife were still young; some suffering was tolerable. But if the stepmother’s cruelty continued until they had no rice or clothes, how could they endure? So he early sought help from friends and relatives outside, hoping to find work. One, to earn wages to support his parents; two, to avoid many troubles. He told his wife of this plan. The eldest daughter-in-law, pitying her husband’s burden, wished him well in leaving the village.

The scholar Gu resolved to seek his fortune elsewhere. At that time, a friend recommended him to a merchant to assist with trade and logistics. Merchants then were not highly regarded; from the scholar-farmer class to merchants was a drop of two or three ranks in social esteem.

But the scholar Gu no longer cared for such distinctions. As long as it was honest work, able to support his family and parents, with nothing shameful, he cared not for rank or status. So he bade farewell to his mother and wife and set off cheerfully.

The night before his departure, the couple sat silently facing each other, a whole night spent in wordless sorrow. They felt a thousand words pressing on their tongues, yet none could be spoken. Sitting thus until dawn, both felt their hearts break, tears falling like rain. The scholar Gu said only: “I understand everything. You must fulfill your rites and filial duties; no need to say more, nor are you permitted to speak. I believe you would not want to speak anyway. Since it is so, we part here. When I have some success, I will come to see you again.” The eldest daughter-in-law could say nothing, only nodded in obedience. The two parted with tears filling their eyes, swallowing their grief.

The scholar Gu was a man of great talent and noble character. Though he abandoned scholarship for commerce, it was a waste of his gifts; yet he handled it with ease. After six months, he gained his employer’s trust and sent his earnings home. After his departure, the household’s hardships worsened.

Rarely did the eldest daughter-in-law truly fulfill both mother and son’s roles, especially in her devoted filial care. Yet, despite her efforts to earn money to support Madam Yu, the stepmother accused her of having an affair. “Otherwise, how could a woman manage to earn money outside the home?”

These words struck the eldest daughter-in-law’s ears harder than all the insults she had suffered over six or seven years. Overcome with rage and sorrow, she fainted for a long time. Madam Yu paid no mind, saying she was only feigning death to scare them. Yet the eldest daughter-in-law revived once more. Madam Yu felt her suspicions confirmed and declared, “Even if this wretched woman truly dies, I will no longer care for her.” Filled with resentment, the eldest daughter-in-law once resolved to die to prove her resolve. But then she thought: even if she lacked kindness, she could not be unfilial. Besides, her husband’s parting words urged her to care for the aged stepmother. To die lightly would leave no one to support the old woman. So she swallowed her bitter grievances and endured. The two sides maintained this uneasy truce for a time.

When the money sent by the scholar Gu arrived, Madam Yu took it for herself, enjoying her ease and no longer caring for the eldest daughter-in-law’s fate. With sufficient funds, she no longer needed the detested daughter-in-law and sought to drive her out. She spread word to sell her off, whether as concubine or servant, caring not for price, only that she leave quickly. Poor eldest daughter-in-law, confined to her chamber, knew nothing of such cruelty.

At this time, a local bully known as the Living Tiger, notorious for his lust and cruelty, heard of the eldest daughter-in-law’s talents and beauty. He longed to seize her but was thwarted by her chastity and self-restraint. Hearing this news, he rejoiced and hastened to arrange her capture, agreeing on price and promising to take her in two days.

The next day, Madam Yu suddenly called the eldest daughter-in-law and spoke kindly and gently. The eldest daughter-in-law was surprised. Madam Yu said, “Years ago, your father-in-law was ill, and I made a vow at the River God’s temple. After his passing, I forgot to fulfill the vow. Last night, I dreamed the River God sent someone to rebuke me for breaking my promise. I said, ‘How dare I forget a vow? It is only because I am old and weak that I delayed.’ The messenger said, ‘If so, your daughter-in-law may go in your place; that will suffice.’ Upon waking, the dream remained vivid, unmistakably true. Good daughter-in-law, I know you rarely go out, but for the family’s sake, you must go this once. When your husband returns, he will surely be grateful.”

Since marriage, the eldest daughter-in-law had never received such favor. Moreover, she never once disobeyed her respected stepmother’s orders. Today, for such a small matter, Madam Yu humbled herself so—was this not strange? She thought thus in her heart but outwardly only obeyed. Returning to her room, she pondered long and found no reason to refuse. The next morning, she dressed hastily. Madam Yu said, “The carriage is here; daughter-in-law, quickly get in and go!” The eldest daughter-in-law grew more alarmed and asked, “Mother-in-law, why hire a carriage? Though frail, this seven or eight li journey should be walkable. Why waste your money on a carriage?” Madam Yu smiled, “Not so. Your trip will take half a day. If you leave me alone at home, it will be lonely and sad. With the carriage, you’ll be faster. Luckily, your husband sent money recently; the cost is no burden. Daughter-in-law, don’t argue; go quickly and return soon. So I won’t wait long.”

The eldest daughter-in-law knew this journey hid some scheme, likely ill fortune, but could not guess what trick or plan. Having resolved to risk death, she thought nothing worse could come. So she put on a joyful face, bade Madam Yu farewell, and left the gate. Seeing the carriage and many men outside, she understood more and guessed the plot. With fate sealed, she boarded.

After three or four li, the carriage turned—not toward the River God’s temple. The eldest daughter-in-law then realized the truth. She lifted the curtain and said to the men, “Stop the carriage; I have a word to ask!” They obeyed. The driver pulled the reins, and the carriage halted. Calmly, she smiled and asked, “Are you sent by my mother-in-law to escort me to the River God’s temple?” The men looked puzzled and said, “We come from the household of Lord Liu in the Western Market town to fetch you. Don’t you know?” The leader nodded, “I understand. Probably you do not wish to marry Lord Liu, but your mother-in-law forces you, yes?” The eldest daughter-in-law said nothing.

They asked the leader, “How do you know this?” He laughed, “It’s easy. If the stepmother truly arranged the marriage openly, why such secrecy? Besides, the River God’s temple is close; no need for such fuss. This is a slip your stepmother could not help but make. When you asked, she told me, ‘If the young lady questions you, just answer briefly; don’t say more.’ She foresaw a leak. But you boarded calmly, said nothing, and so fell into their trap.”

The eldest daughter-in-law had no time to argue. Her heart raced wildly like a herd of young deer, unsure if the taste was bitter, sour, sweet, or spicy. For a long while, she fixed her clear, watery eyes, sitting dumbfounded in the carriage, unsure what to do. The drivers saw no instructions, shouted a command, and the carriage resumed its swift course.

She thought long. Seeing no way to make them turn back, she considered returning home, but knew her stepmother would never accept her. Returning to her natal home was no refuge—her parents were long dead, and she had no siblings but a cousin who was no better. Perhaps her stepmother had colluded with that cousin in this plot.

So retreat was impossible, and no place to turn back. To marry another would ruin her chastity and her husband’s honor—unthinkable for Ma’s eldest daughter. If she reached Lord Liu’s house, he, known as the Living Tiger, would never spare her. With no way forward or back, death seemed the only relief. She clenched her teeth until they clicked sharply, steeling her heart to seek death. She searched for a quick way to end her life, to avoid further entanglements.

While she pondered, the carriage stopped again—to transfer to a boat crossing the river. The bridal boat from Lord Liu’s home awaited on the shore. Hearing this, the eldest daughter-in-law’s joy was boundless. Two bridal attendants boarded, lifted the curtain, and beckoned her down. Resolute, she stepped down, grasped their shoulders, and walked to the riverbank. Each attendant took one arm to help her aboard.

Just as she stepped onto the boat’s edge, she suddenly pushed both attendants into the water and leapt after them. A splash! Waves surged around a chaste woman swept into the clear current! The crowd saw the bride leap into the river and rushed to rescue her. But the river was vast and wild; rescue was impossible. Their efforts were in vain, and they returned disappointed to report to the Living Tiger.

The Living Tiger, mouth wide open ready for a feast, suddenly lost his prize. Furious, he vented his rage on his men, cursing their failure and his own ill luck.

Meanwhile, the eldest daughter-in-law’s spirit was carried by the waves downstream. At that moment, a Daoist, over one hundred years old, white-bearded but vigorous, was crossing the river, steering his boat slowly. He glimpsed the drifting woman but did not know if she lived or died. Moved by compassion, he sought to save her. Yet, having never touched a woman in his life, from youth to old age, he was reluctant to break his lifelong vow. To save her without touching her was nearly impossible amid the swift currents; the chance was fleeting.

After brief thought, he resolved, “Better to lose my precepts than to see death unaverted.” He moved the boat close, thrust a pole to support her body, then crouched and pulled her aboard. But the eldest daughter-in-law had been submerged too long; her soul had departed. The Daoist thought: since she could not be revived, the body should be taken ashore and properly buried. Using all his strength, he dragged the corpse onto the boat. But the swollen belly and bloated limbs made it heavy. Halfway, a sharp crack sounded—the leg bone broke. Then great waves capsized the boat. The Daoist struggled and, knowing some swimming, escaped with his life. The corpse drifted away, lost.

The Daoist, ashore, lamented that in trying to save a life, he had maimed a body, violating his century-old vows. He had never done such a grievous deed before. Now, near death, he had wrought a great calamity. His conscience tormented him day and night; he grew mad and died within months.

The eldest daughter-in-law’s spirit was taken by the River God to the Crystal Palace. The Dragon King honored her chastity and filial devotion with great respect and explained her past life. The eldest daughter-in-law’s heart was suddenly enlightened. The Dragon King smiled, “You have a fellow traveler, sharing your exile and punishment. After this life, you will both be exiled again together, cultivating the Dao and returning to the truth. This person is now a Daoist, devout and strict in precepts, over one hundred years old. Because of saving you, he harmed your body. He grieves deeply and will soon pass away.”

The eldest daughter-in-law was moved and said, “Because of my own suffering, another was harmed. To cause harm after death is unbearable!” The Dragon King said, “That is his fate. Though he died from illness caused by you, it is not your fault. Yet, having unwittingly committed the crime of damaging your body, he may be born with some disability next life. Fortunately, it will not affect his life or merit.” Hearing this, she felt even more compassion. The Dragon King comforted her further, then ceased.

Some time later, the scholar Gu, having prospered in business, returned laden with wealth. Coincidentally, his stepmother Madam Yu had died days before. Grieving, he inquired among relatives and learned of his wife’s martyrdom. Overcome with sorrow, he cast all his gold and treasures into the river—at the very spot where his wife had drowned. The scholar then abandoned worldly learning to cultivate the Dao, vanishing without trace.

News of this reached the Crystal Palace. The Dragon King summoned the eldest daughter-in-law and explained, “The virtuous couple, faithful and filial, are revered by gods and spirits alike. Your husband has become a monk; his future is boundless. You will soon be sent by me to the underworld and then reincarnate. After a thousand years of merit, your journey will be complete. Out of respect for your virtues and hardships, I have ordered the River God to raise from the water’s surface a solitary island in the river—an isolated mountain for future generations to visit and honor. This has long been decreed and will soon come to pass.” The eldest daughter-in-law gratefully bowed.

Indeed, a mountain rose from the river, known to all as the Golden Mountain. Over centuries, it grew taller and broader, remaining a famous scenic spot in China. But that is another story, no need to recount here.

The eldest daughter-in-law’s spirit, sent by the Dragon King, reincarnated as a human in a family surnamed He at the foot of the Golden Mountain. From birth, she spoke with clarity and spiritual insight, shunning meat and fish. As she grew, she vowed to cultivate the Dao. Her parents, He Jie and Madam Liu, were honest and kind, devout believers in immortals and Buddhas. Seeing their daughter’s sincere heart, they did not hinder her aspirations.

In a flash, more than ten years passed. The girl, nicknamed Lanxian, made little progress at home and sought to leave to travel far, seeking immortals to teach her the great Dao. Her parents, now over forty and having only this daughter, hesitated. Letting her go far away left them uneasy and lonely. They proposed she wait until they had more children before leaving. Lanxian had not yet agreed.

While this was undecided, a young Daoist surnamed Li came to visit. He Jie was surprised and asked how his daughter knew this Daoist. Lanxian was equally puzzled. Father and daughter went out to meet him. The Daoist was handsome and elegant, with a rare and ethereal bearing, seeming a true immortal. Lanxian felt she had seen him before. The Daoist, seeing Lanxian, showed a strange expression. He stepped forward and bowed to them. They hurriedly returned the greeting and asked his Daoist name and place.

The Daoist smiled and said, “My surname is Li, name Xuan. I come from Henan. I have a predestined bond with the young lady. When I reincarnated, I recalled your past life and came to fulfill that fate.” He then recounted the whole story and departed.

Thus, the eldest daughter-in-law’s spirit, unable to forget the Golden Mountain and the Daoist who suffered for her, was reborn at the mountain’s foot in the He family as a girl. From birth, she spoke with spiritual clarity, abstained from flesh and fish, wore no fine clothes, and vowed never to marry. At seven, the Mysterious Lady of the Nine Heavens appeared as a Daoist woman, descending to instruct her. The girl, born with innate wisdom, recognized the Mysterious Lady as a true immortal and earnestly sought her guidance.

Yet she never forgot her past life and vowed to find the Daoist’s reincarnation, waiting for him to become an immortal before she would transcend. The Mysterious Lady praised her resolve, saying, “This is fate and cannot be forced. The old Daoist you seek has been reborn in a Li family in Henan. When he attains the Dao, I will send him to meet you.” She then imparted many formulas for refining qi, nourishing the heart, guiding breath, and fasting, along with several protective spells like invisibility and flying swords. The girl received them all and devoted herself to cultivation, awaiting the arrival of the Li immortal to transcend together.

Dear reader, remember this is He Xiangu, one of the Eight Immortals. Because of her connection with the lame immortal Li Xuan, his story must be told first.

Now, to the story of the lame immortal himself. In Luoyang, there was an official family surnamed Li. The lady was Madam You, who bore a single son named Li Xuan. At his birth, Madam You dreamed a Daoist embraced her. Upon waking, the room was filled with a strange fragrance, and the infant had arrived.

The couple knew the child was special and doted on him. Li Xuan was peculiar by nature, unwilling to seek office, desiring only to cultivate the Dao. He often spoke to his parents of his past life, saying, “I was once an old Daoist, always kind and never committing evil. But at the end of that life, I harmed a woman’s body while trying to save her. This is my greatest sorrow, and I carry it in my heart. After attaining the Dao, I must find that woman and repent before her to truly become enlightened.”

Hearing this, Li Qi thought him mad and scolded him, forbidding such nonsense. Madam You believed in immortals and comforted him gently. Li Xuan paid no heed.

More than ten years passed when suddenly Venus, the Great White Metal Star, came by command of the Old Lord Laozi, descending on the Li household. Li Qi and his family knelt, burned incense, and kowtowed in awe. Venus smiled and said, “Sir and madam, please no formalities. I come because of a bond with your son. Please allow me to speak with him.” Li Qi feared Venus would take his son away and hesitated. Madam You, straightforward, sent for Li Xuan. Upon seeing Venus, Li Xuan recognized him and bowed eight times. Venus took his hand and smiled, “A thousand years have passed; do you still remember me?” He patted Li Xuan’s neck thrice. Li Xuan suddenly recalled events from nine lifetimes ago and knelt, crying, “Master, please save me from the sea of suffering.” Venus laughed coldly, “There are no such easy immortals in the world. If immortals were so easy, they would be no different from mortals.” Li Xuan understood and said, “Master, lead me. I will endure calamities and forsake the world. I will never regret it.” Li Qi was terrified and tried to stop him, but Venus raised his sleeve, and golden light filled the room. Li Xuan and Venus vanished.

Where Li Xuan went is unknown; we shall see in the next chapter.
