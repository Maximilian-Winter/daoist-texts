# Chapter Nineteen: Undeterred by Perils in Pursuit of Immortality, Yet Encountering Demons While Seeking the Dao

Now it happened that Li Xuan was carried beyond the city walls by Venus, the Great White Metal Star, wrapped in a radiant golden light. When his feet finally touched the ground, he opened his eyes and exclaimed, “Ah! This is a place I have never before set foot.” But the Great White Metal Star had vanished without a trace, leaving Li Xuan standing alone amidst a bustling market street thronged with people. Composing himself, he understood that Venus had brought him here for a purpose. Though the path ahead seemed uncertain and without refuge, surely there would be a place to rest in time. So he summoned his courage, strode forward with confidence, and inquired about his whereabouts. He soon learned that he stood on the southern slope of Mount Hua, some hundreds of li from his home in Luoyang. Li Xuan marveled at the wondrous skill of the immortals—how they could shrink distances and transport him thus. 

He was pleased, for since childhood he had heard of the venerable Immortal Patriarch Li, the Lord of Mount Hua, who also had a grotto abode here. Now that the immortal had brought him to this place, surely it was to guide him along the path to transcendence, sparing him from wandering blindly. Reflecting on this, he raised his gaze to the heavens and pressed his palms to his brow in heartfelt thanks.

After a while, a sudden heat surged through his whole body, sweat soaking his skin. He found this most strange. Could the weather here be hotter than in the Central Plains? He had just left Luoyang, where even cotton garments were not warm enough, and Hua Yin was not far away. How could the climate have changed so drastically? While pondering this, an old man appeared before him, eyeing him up and down with a smile, and said cheerfully, “Young sir, in this blazing summer you still wear such cotton clothes? Is your body not quite comfortable yet? Look at me—I am many times your age, yet wear only a single thin garment. Compared to you, that is quite the difference.”

Only then did Li Xuan realize it was the season of Great Heat. Needless to say, the Great White Metal Star was not only skilled in shrinking space but also in altering time itself—a marvel of the immortal dao, capable of seizing the creative power of Heaven and Earth. He sighed in awe. Then he reflected further: though the seasons change gradually by month and by quarter, dividing cold and heat, winter and summer, in truth it is but a fleeting instant. A human life spans at most a hundred years; recalling one’s childhood from that vantage is but a blink. Deep in thought, he could not help but sigh. Not wishing to trouble the old man with such musings, he replied vaguely and hastened to take his leave. Fearing his cotton clothes ill-suited to the season might draw attention, and feeling the heat unbearable, he avoided the crowded market and sought quieter, cooler places to walk. His foremost concern now was to prepare a set of summer clothes to move about unencumbered. Fortunately, he did not feel hunger, so he set off toward the wilderness.

After walking some distance, far from the city, he removed his outer cotton robe and carried it in his hand, feeling lighter and freer with each step. As dusk fell and evening mists rose, he longed to find a place to stay for the night and inquire about the path to Mount Hua, but no dwellings appeared.

Just as he was at a loss, he saw a young boy herding cattle, riding atop an ox, playing a short flute and singing as he walked toward the deep mountain woods. Li Xuan rejoiced, “Where there is a herdsman, there must be a village. Let me ask.” He approached politely and greeted, “Brother Herdsman.” The boy did not dismount but smiled and asked, “Where are you going, sir? From where have you come? What do you wish to ask me?” Li Xuan explained his situation and asked where he might lodge. The boy laughed and said, “Look around—mountains and wilds all around, no village in sight. But my home lies just beyond the mountain. I watch over the forest for someone there. My father keeps this ox, and every day he sends me out to feed it some grass. If you have nowhere to go, come with me for the night. We’ll set out again at dawn—it will be no trouble.” Li Xuan was delighted, “I would not have guessed, Brother Herdsman, that you are so kind.” The boy leapt down and took the reins in both hands, saying, “Come along, young sir!” Li Xuan thanked him repeatedly and followed, winding through the mountains and woods. Along the way, he asked the boy’s surname. “Wang,” he replied. “Everyone calls me Wang Xiao’er. My father is Wang Daguan’er. He is old now and seldom comes out, but he is always glad when travelers come to stay.” Li Xuan’s joy grew.

Before long, they reached the back of the mountain. There stood a small thatched hut by a stream, and leaning in the doorway was a middle-aged man. The boy said, “That is my father.” Li Xuan hurried forward and greeted with a respectful bow. The boy explained the reason for his visit. Wang Daguan’er welcomed him warmly: “You are a young gentleman, rare to find here—a true honored guest!” He ordered the boy to tie up the ox and took Li Xuan’s clothes, then took his hand and led him inside the humble cottage, instructing his son to brew tea.

Wang Xiao’er smiled as he held the clothes, “No wonder Father said he was a gentleman. Look at these fine garments. Do the wealthiest families in our village dress so well?” Li Xuan understood why they called him “gentleman” and laughed, “Many thanks, sir, and Brother Herdsman for your kindness! If you like these clothes, I shall gift them to you.” Wang Daguan’er quickly shook his head, “That cannot be. It is not fitting to accept gifts without merit. I have lived here for decades and never used such fine things. Small households living too comfortably not only lose blessings but invite calamity. Xiao’er, quickly put away the gentleman’s clothes and keep them clean. Go brew tea and cook food—no more dawdling here!” Xiao’er was pleased but, hearing his father’s words, puckered his lips and smiled softly, “I knew your temper, Father—you would never accept gifts.” Then he laughed and left.

Li Xuan smiled and was surprised: surprised that such a mountain elder held such views, and amused by Xiao’er’s innocent frankness. While he pondered, Wang Daguan’er asked about his journey. Seeing the man sincere, Li Xuan told him honestly and asked about the path to Mount Hua.

Wang Daguan’er showed no surprise but nodded with a smile: “That is good. Young sir, so young yet with such great resolve—were it not for some foundation from a past life, how could you have come so far? Mount Hua stretches over three thousand li, with eighty-one peaks and thirty-six grottoes, each said to house immortals. The highest peak in the north is the Sun Viewing Peak; in the south lies the Purple Mist Grotto, where the Lord Li once refined his elixir. Even now, the Lord Li often visits. We woodcutters in the mountain sometimes meet an old Daoist who talks with us about ancient and modern times. He speaks of past and future dynasties, and asks about current affairs. Sometimes, after long talks, he shares pears, dates, peaches, and apricots. Those who eat them find their steps lighter by tenfold when descending the mountain, never suffer illness, and live longer than usual. So the people say, ‘He is an immortal.’ Others say, ‘He is the Patriarch of the Immortals—Lord Li.’ This has been said for over a hundred years. Later, those who believe in immortality and seek the dao come from afar to find him. Some go and never return; some return. Those who do not return are said to have been taken by Lord Li to transcend the world. Some disbelieve and say they were devoured by tigers, wolves, or poisonous beasts. These are baseless rumors. As for those who return, they have simply reached impassable heights or turned back in fear of dangers. That is not surprising. Here in this remote mountain where I live, few travelers come, but in twenty years I have met two or three seeking immortality—some returned, some did not. Because my place lies on the main route up Mount Hua, travelers must pass here, so such people are often seen. Now, young sir, having left home and been guided by a true immortal, you surely have fate with the immortals. You will meet the Patriarch. When I was young, I met a stranger who gave me ten golden pills said to resist hunger and cold, and protect against poison and evil spirits. I have never encountered evil in the mountains, thanks to these pills. I have given most away and only two remain. Since you are going up the mountain, you must guard against harm. Take these two pills with you.”

Li Xuan was overjoyed and bowed deeply. “This immortal elixir is so efficacious. If I take one pill, it will suffice for protection. I should leave one for you, sir, to aid others. That is proper.” Wang Daguan’er smiled, “Those who receive pills usually ask for more, as if they could fill their hunger and cold. Though a small matter, it shows selfishness and greed. Such people have no immortal fate. Hearing your words, I see a man of virtue. Surely you will succeed. I will await good news from the mountain.”

He handed Li Xuan a pill. Li Xuan took it carefully and saw it was golden, lustrous as vermilion, as small as a mustard seed, hard as steel—a rare treasure indeed. His face brightened with joy as he thanked them again and again, promising to treasure it. Xiao’er brought tea, which Li Xuan sipped before asking again about the mountain path. Wang Daguan’er said, “The climb is easy; the immortal path hard to find. But one with your fate will find the way—no need to worry.” Li Xuan bowed again in gratitude. Wang Daguan’er laughed, “You are too polite! I am but a mountain man—no need for thanks.” Li Xuan said earnestly, “Though penniless, I prize reason above all. Your words are law to me, and I will remember them all my life. A mere thanks cannot suffice!” Wang Daguan’er was pleased.

Li Xuan stayed the night. The next morning, he changed his clothes for money and bought a single-layer robe and much dried food. When all was ready near evening, he prepared to depart. The father and son urged him to stay another night, saying the mountain road was easier with a rest. Li Xuan smiled, “The true immortals above call me onward. The journey will take days, and I will surely need to sleep outdoors. What use is this one night?” Seeing his resolve, they relented and Xiao’er escorted him partway, pointing out the mountain path before returning.

Li Xuan’s heart was steadfast as he followed the route. The road was first level, then steep and rugged. Each day he traveled by dawn and rested by night. When he found mountain caves, he lodged there, eating dried food when hungry and drinking from streams when thirsty. He avoided mountain spirits and wild beasts. At times he reached towering peaks and sheer cliffs, yet he climbed on. The journey lasted more than one day; the deeper into the mountains, the higher the peaks. Looking back, nothing could be seen below; looking up, the peaks pierced the clouds, their heights unknown. His provisions lasted only a few days, but he pressed on undeterred.

At dusk one day, he reached a tangled ridge where paths overlapped and hills interwove. Lost and unsure which way to turn, he hesitated. Suddenly a foul stench struck his nostrils, making him want to vomit. A breeze passed, and from behind the trees emerged a Daoist priest, white-haired and bearded, solemn in demeanor. Li Xuan was startled. “I have traveled many days without seeing a soul—how comes this Daoist here? I heard from Wang Daguan’er that the Patriarch Li often disguises himself as a commoner, chatting with woodcutters. Now this man floats with the aura of an immortal. Here in the deep mountains, no mortal could come—surely he is a true immortal.”

He straightened his clothes and stepped forward with measured grace, bowing deeply. With tears, he said, “Disciple Li Xuan, from Luoyang, guided by an immortal master, has journeyed northward, braving wind and dust, enduring hardship to seek the master. Now, fortunate to meet the immortal master, my humble heart is not in vain. I earnestly beg the immortal master’s compassion to accept me, that I may realize the true fruit of the dao and swiftly escape the mortal net. I am filled with awe and gratitude.” The Daoist smiled and laughed heartily, “Are you Li Xuan? I have waited long for you! Since you have such sincerity and dare face perils to seek the dao, you must be a person of great destiny. I will accept you as disciple and teach you the great way of the Golden Elixir.” Li Xuan was overjoyed and bowed repeatedly. The Daoist said, “Come with me to my grotto! I will teach you the methods of cultivation.”

Li Xuan eagerly answered “Yes” several times and respectfully followed the Daoist. They passed around a ridge, crossed a mountain slope, and came to a forest blocking the way. The Daoist pointed, “Beyond this forest is a flat clearing, below which lie three grotto chambers—my place of cultivation.” Li Xuan looked up and saw the forest’s edge. The Daoist walked a few steps, emerged from the woods, crossed the clearing, then turned down the slope into a scene of rare beauty. Pine and bamboo intertwined, strange flowers bloomed everywhere, and a faint fragrance filled the air, intoxicating the senses.

The Daoist led Li Xuan into the grotto and sat in the center. Li Xuan entered and bowed eight times. The Daoist called out, “Little demons, where are you?” Immediately, many creatures appeared—covered in hair, half human, half not, numbering seventy or eighty—who entered and bowed. Li Xuan watched in astonishment.

The Daoist smiled broadly and said, “Since you seek the dao, you must ascend to Heaven. Though you have fate, your mortal body is still defiled. With such a dusty vessel, not to mention meeting the Emperor, even soaring on clouds and mist is nearly impossible.” Li Xuan wept and bowed, “I know my roots and practice are shallow. That is why I brave dangers, endure cold and hunger, to seek the master, hoping to transform and transcend. Fortunate to meet you, master, I am not unworthy of my sincerity. Please guide me from my confusion—I would be most grateful.” The Daoist laughed, “Transforming and transcending is no easy matter. If you meet a useless immortal who teaches you for thousands of years, you remain Li Xuan. Luckily, you have found me—your fortune. I have a clever and simple method: in half a day, I can cleanse your mortal flesh and bones. Are you willing?”

Li Xuan was both surprised and delighted, quickly bowing, “I came for this. To seek and attain the dao is great fortune. How could I refuse?” The Daoist said, “Then it is well. Little demons, prepare the cauldron quickly. Wash and cleanse this new brother, steam him in the pot with scallions, garlic, and spices. When I have eaten him and he passes his waste, that is his soul. With further cultivation, he will become the great dao.”

The little demons hurried to seize Li Xuan. At once, he was terrified beyond measure. “Master, what do you mean?” he cried. The Daoist scolded, “If you want to transform, how else can it be done?” Li Xuan tried to protest, but the demons would not let him speak. They dragged him out of the grotto and carried him like a pig to the back, where a vast kitchen stood, with many human legs and heads, beast tails, and bird bodies hanging above. A great stove blazed. The demons stripped Li Xuan naked; some fetched water, others kindled fire, while a few guarded him to prevent escape.

At this, Li Xuan bitterly regretted his folly. How could an immortal’s grotto be so lowly, filled with such strange and unseemly creatures? Even the Daoist’s speech and manner were coarse and base, hardly the way of a true master. He recalled the foul stench before meeting the Daoist—it surely came from him! He had been careless to mistake such a one for an immortal master, walking into a trap of his own making. His sincere heart had led him through dangers only to become a demon’s feast. Tears welled as he thought on this. The demons, seeing his tears, gathered around clapping hands and stamping feet in delight.

Li Xuan’s heart sank, but suddenly he thought: those who begin the path to immortality must undergo trials to test their worthiness. Now that he was in Mount Hua, the immortal master was near, the immortal realm close at hand. How could demons dare reveal themselves to cause mischief? Perhaps this was a test set by some divine teacher to measure his courage and resolve. If so, he would not show weakness or fear over such trifling dangers. Besides, now that the matter had come to this, could his tears change the cruel hearts of demons? No. With this thought, he clenched his teeth, closed his eyes, smiled faintly, and stood firm, ready to enter the pot.

Soon the demons shouted, “The water boils! Quickly put this thing in the pot!” Seven or eight demons hoisted Li Xuan, shouting and cheering. Li Xuan resolved to give his life to show his sincerity. Not only did he feel no fear, but he welcomed the plunge, hoping to escape the mortal world. If the immortals cared for him, they would surely protect this body. If he were reborn, cultivation would be easier. Seeing the danger before him, he thought it might even aid his next life’s path. Smiling, he let them carry him.

At the cauldron’s edge, the demons were short of stature and struggled to lower him in. Li Xuan laughed, “You fools! Can you not think of a simple trick? Have you wasted many human bodies and beast forms in vain?” The demons were amazed. “Strange! This man was terrified before, now he speaks so boldly. His courage has grown in an instant—truly rare.” One demon said, “You cannot escape our king’s jaws. Since you say so, you must have a clever method to save us some trouble. Why not lend us a hand and spare us the difficulty? You may pass early and avoid more fright—would that not be two gains at once?” Li Xuan laughed, “Little demons, you are mischievous. Very well, I do wish to pass early and save you effort.” Turning to them, he said, “Put me down and I will climb the pot’s edge and jump in myself.” The demons thought he could not escape and smiled, “This gentleman is both clever and brave—a fine fellow indeed.” Li Xuan paid them no mind, stripped off his clothes, leapt onto the pot’s rim, and jumped down.

A sudden roar sounded, boiling water splashed—his fate unknown. To be continued in the next chapter.
