# Chapter Twenty: The Venerable Patriarch Descends to Save the World — Li Xuan Escapes Peril and Becomes an Immortal

Now it happened that the Most High Patriarch of the Dao, the Venerable Old Lord, was the essence of Heaven and the spirit of Earth, the ancestor of all mountains. The worldly called him Laozi. Since the primal opening of chaos, he had cultivated an indestructible body. To perfect his merit and virtue and to save those with affinity, he repeatedly descended to the human realm. At the turning of the Xia and Shang dynasties, after dispatching his two great disciples, Piaomiao and Fire Dragon, to resolve the matter of the Dragon King of the Sea, he then entrusted his immortal spirit to the mysterious Jade Maiden, who bore him down to the village of Qu Ren in Lai Township, Ku County of Chu. Born from his mother’s left armpit, he came into the world beneath the great Li Forest, with white hair at birth, his face tinged pale yellow and white, a pattern like the stars of the sky upon his forehead, and able to speak from birth. Pointing to the Li Forest with his finger, he said to the Jade Maiden, “Mother, I am born here; let this be my surname.” The Jade Maiden joyfully consented. She then named him Er, styled Boyang, also called Lao Dan. The Old Lord’s numinous spirit never dimmed; his dao cultivation deepened ever more. He often descended to exorcise demons and monsters, to relieve suffering and aid the needy.

By the dawn of the Zhou dynasty, he served as the Guardian of the Pillars. When King Wu unified the realm, he was appointed Pillar Official. In King Cheng’s reign, he retained his post and roamed the western lands of Tianzhu and others. In King Kang’s time, he returned to Zhou. Toward the end of King Kang’s reign, he suddenly told his household, “Since Pangu’s time, at the beginning of chaos, I combined Heaven’s essence and Earth’s spirit to become human. Since then, I have repeatedly incarnated solely to save and deliver those with affinity. In recent centuries, due to the misrule of Shang’s Zhou and the rise of the Zhou house, immortals and spirits have all faced tribulation. I have secluded myself in the mountains, not meddling in human affairs. Now, counting the mortal world’s span, it has been nearly five hundred years. Someone in the West awaits my deliverance. I shall soon emerge from seclusion, save this person, and then ascend to Heaven.” Having spoken, he closed his eyes and sat in silent meditation. His family approached to comfort him, but his breath had ceased, his body cold as ice. They had no choice but to bury him.

Yet Laozi had not truly died. On the day his family interred him, Laozi rode his ox out from seclusion. Arriving at Hangu Pass, he encountered an official with more than ten attendants, bowing toward the left of the road. The man introduced himself as Guan Yinxi, respectfully awaiting the sacred carriage. Laozi dismounted his ox and smiled, asking, “Sir, what matter brings you such reverence?” Yinxi replied, “Long have I heard that Master is a sage born of Heaven. I, Guan Yinxi, though unworthy, am versed in the art of divining qi. Recently, I divined the weather and knew that your honored carriage would pass this gate today at this hour. I have come to greet you with utmost respect, hoping you will not abandon your journey and enroll me among your disciples. I would be overjoyed.” Laozi laughed, “You are truly a person of affinity. Rise, and I shall follow you. I will teach you the secret of longevity and the gate of cultivation.”

Yinxi was greatly pleased. With deep reverence, he welcomed Laozi inside the pass. Sitting in the center, he renewed his homage. Laozi sighed, “In my five hundred years among men, I have never seen such earnestness toward the dao as yours. Now I entrust you with the great way; cultivate it well, for your future is immeasurable!” Then from his sleeve he produced the *Dao De Jing*, five thousand words, handing it to Yinxi with instructions: “Refine the elixir and temper your qi; there are methods for this. But the root of all learning lies in clearly seeing the heart and nature, in screening out desire and severing attachments. This is the source of life for immortals and spirits. All who become true immortals see this scripture. Do not lightly neglect it, lest you incur fault.” Yinxi kowtowed nine times in acceptance. Laozi added, “I cannot remain long here. Soon I shall ascend Kunlun Mountain to cultivate and observe the caverns.” Yinxi wept, “Just now I saw your compassionate face; how can I bear to bid farewell?” Laozi said, “The foremost precept for cultivators is to guard against attachment. If you can truly cultivate, it is as if you are always by my side; why must you see me at every moment?” Yinxi said, “I am willing to abandon home and follow you, braving fire and water without fear!” Laozi replied, “I roam the boundaries of Heaven and Earth, without a fixed place like ordinary men. To dwell in the vast unknown is not like the common man’s resting place. I come and go through the four dimensions, travel the eight extremes, in boundless, limitless darkness. Your days of receiving the dao are few; you have not yet penetrated the spirit. How could your mortal flesh and blood keep pace with me?” Yinxi asked, “When shall we meet again after this parting?” Laozi said, “I will first go to Kunlun, then to the sea. I have one more worldly bond to resolve in the Western Regions. There is a Green Ram shop in Shu. Years ago, when I was there, I saw the owner was very benevolent but childless. I could not bear it and jokingly promised that if he accumulated five hundred merits, I would send him a son. Now the couple are over one hundred and twenty years old, their spirits undiminished; they have accumulated four hundred and eighty merits. I shall personally incarnate as their son. In about twenty years, this elderly couple should have a child. Five years later, you may personally visit me in Shu.”

Having spoken, he pointed outward, and a cloud of five colors slowly descended, attaching beneath Laozi’s feet. Laozi mounted it; the blue ox stood on the cloud’s edge. His face shone with the Five Luminaries; his body gleamed with golden light, illuminating the Ten Directions. Slowly ascending into the red void, five-colored auspicious light shone far and wide. Yinxi kowtowed and bade farewell, watching until the clouds vanished, tears streaming. From then on, he devoutly recited the *Dao De Jing*, pondering its meaning. He also mastered the art of governing the state: to keep the people tranquil and undisturbed, so they would not know good or evil, desire no rise or fall, and naturally follow non-action, achieving supreme governance. After several years, the effect was great. Based on what he had seen and heard, he compiled the *Record of the Western Ascension* in thirty-six chapters. Within three years, he refined the Golden Elixir and composed the book *Master Guan Yin*. When the book was complete and the elixir perfected, exactly twenty-five years had passed.

Yinxi faithfully remembered Laozi’s instructions, abandoning office and home, and personally journeyed to Western Shu to seek the Green Ram shop. No one knew of this. Days passed with no news. Yinxi was certain Laozi had not spoken in jest and patiently awaited.

One day, wandering in the countryside, he suddenly saw a small boy leading a green ram approaching. Yinxi rejoiced, saying, “The immortal master’s words always contain hidden meaning. Since there is a green ram, it must be an omen.” He stepped forward and bowed, “May I ask, young sir, where does this ram come from? Where are you taking it?” The boy laughed, “It is quite amusing. My master and mistress, both over one hundred and twenty years old, have just had a son, now five years old. He loves this green ram dearly. A few days ago, the ram disappeared, and the young master was very upset. So the master sent people far and wide to search, and now it has been found and brought home, so the young master will not be distressed.” Hearing this, Yinxi’s heart leapt with joy, for it matched Laozi’s parting words exactly. He hurriedly said, “Would you please send a letter to the young master, saying that an old friend, Guan Yinxi, wishes to meet him?” The boy looked Yinxi over and smiled, “My young master is only five years old this year. How could he have such an old friend?” Yinxi smiled, “Not only an old friend, but also his disciple!” The boy laughed again, “The young master has never been to school, nor has your teacher come knocking on the door!” Yinxi said, “It is not so. Your young master is my master; I am his student. If you do not believe me, go tell the young master ‘Guan Yinxi requests an audience’ and see what he says. Then come back and tell me.” The boy, half believing, half doubting, led Yinxi home. He handed the green ram to the young master, who was delighted. The boy then told the household about meeting Yinxi, claiming he was the young master’s student come to visit. This caused the family to laugh.

Yet when the young master heard this, he immediately straightened his clothes and said to the servants, “No mistake, this person exists. Quickly summon him to come see me!” The family was greatly puzzled by this. The young master urged the boy repeatedly to hurry. The boy came out and told Yinxi, “The young master bids you enter! His temper is strange. Do not provoke him, or we will suffer!” Yinxi laughed, “I understand.” He entered with one step and one kowtow until he reached the inner courtyard. The young master immediately manifested lotus feet, wrapped in colorful clouds, transforming into a golden figure ten zhang tall, shining like the sun, fragrant in all directions. The whole family was greatly astonished. Yinxi prostrated before him, saying, “Your disciple Guan Yinxi pays homage to the honored master!” The young master smiled kindly and bade him rise. Seeing the astonished faces of his parents and family, he laughed, “I am the Old Lord. Taiwei is the dwelling; True Unity is the body. Because fifty years ago I promised to incarnate, I have come to fulfill this ancient cause. Now that worldly bonds are ended, my parents, siblings, and all family may ascend with me, never to perish through kalpas!”

Hearing this, the family prostrated themselves at the steps. Laozi commanded Yinxi to support his parents to sit. After all the rites were completed, he said to Yinxi, “Last time you wished to roam the world with me. Because your cultivation was not yet firm, your worldly bonds not severed, and you had just received the scripture and formula, unable to succeed, if you had hurried to follow, your mortal body could not have borne it, and I feared your body and mind would be divided, hindering your studies. Now I see you refining qi and preserving form, having attained true subtlety, your face radiant with divine light, your heart knot bound in purple threads, your name inscribed in golden script on the mysterious chart, your jade talisman fixed in the firewood room, your qi joining Taiwei, your form united with truth—this proves your diligence and earnestness in cultivation. You have also spread my *Dao De Jing* and your own two books among men, which is meritorious. Today, meeting here, I shall petition the Jade Emperor to decree your title and appoint your heavenly office.” Yinxi kowtowed with resounding reverence.

Laozi commanded him to rise and stand aside. Then with a secret formula he summoned all the True Ones of the Three Realms, the various heavenly sovereigns, gods of the Ten Directions, and all the immortals and scattered spirits of the caverns and mountains to gather in the courtyard. In a moment, the immortals arrived on colorful clouds and divine beasts, each bearing incense and flowers, bowing and paying homage. Incense smoke curled, flower petals rained down, as if opening a grand celestial assembly. Laozi sat on a lotus throne, facing the Five Elders and the Four Extremes Supervisors, and bestowed upon Yinxi a jade register inscribed in golden script, granting him the title “Master Wenshi,” the supreme Perfected One, residing above the Twenty-Four Heavens, commanding eighty thousand true immortals, soaring through the void, transmitting the dragon chariot. Master Guan Yin joyfully knelt to accept the commission. Laozi warmly thanked him, and the immortals gradually dispersed. Laozi, accompanied by Yinxi and his entire family, ascended by daylight, all becoming immortal bodies. Laozi and Yinxi then returned to Kunlun Mountain’s Eight Scenic Palaces. Laozi took Master Wenshi as his disciple, as if gaining an extra arm in human form. All matters of immortals and mortals were entrusted to his agency.

One day, while playing a game of weiqi with Master Wenshi in the palace, Laozi suddenly paused, his gaze fixed in thought. Wenshi asked the reason. Laozi smiled, “Do you know where my mount has gone?” Wenshi laughed, “Indeed, it has not been seen for several days.” Laozi sighed, “Fate’s tribulation is such that even immortal power cannot reverse it. That wicked beast has been on the mortal plane many years now. At Mount Hua, it preys on beasts and men, wounding countless. Soon, one of our Daoist disciples will suffer this calamity. This person will achieve great success under my tutelage, rivaling you. Tomorrow at noon, you must descend to rescue him and bring him to the palace.” Wenshi asked, “What is his name?” Laozi said, “His surname is Li, given name Xuan. He is an official in charge of incense for the Heavenly Official. Having offended, he was banished to the mortal realm for ten lifetimes. Now his term is fulfilled. Fortunately, his spirit remains bright. The Great White Star guides him out of the household, sending him to Mount Hua to endure hardship and danger. You will know when you arrive.” Wenshi prepared to depart. Laozi instructed, “Take the ox-herding boy with you; he can assist. Once you have him, let him ride back first.”

Wenshi went to call the ox-herding boy, who was none other than the child Yinxi had met in Shu, now tending Laozi’s beast. Laozi scolded the boy, “What are you managing? So careless, letting the beast escape and harm men and beasts! Now another destined to become immortal suffers from its poison. If it falls into his hands, can you bear the guilt?” The boy dared not reply, prostrating to beg forgiveness. Wenshi pleaded on his behalf, and Laozi ordered, “Rise. You may accompany the Perfected One to descend and capture this wicked beast, redeeming your fault through merit!” The boy thanked Wenshi and followed him, mounting a cloud to descend to Mount Hua.

Wenshi looked out and saw the southwest shrouded in mist, with a thread of red dust piercing the sky. He said to the boy, “Follow me to exorcise demons; be careful, do not be careless!” The boy answered repeatedly. They rode the clouds to the cave where Li Xuan suffered. Just as they prepared to land, Wenshi used his wisdom eye and saw many small demons crowding around Li Xuan, who leapt onto a pot’s edge. Li Xuan jumped into the pot. At this critical moment, Wenshi quickly waved his hand, bringing a large ice block from the Northern Sea and pushing it into the pot. The boiling water met the ice; the ice melted and cooled the water. Li Xuan, immersed in the pot, found the temperature neither hot nor cold, just right for bathing. Though puzzled, he increasingly believed this was a test from an immortal. Accepting his fate, he hid in the pot, planning his escape.

Meanwhile, Wenshi and the boy entered the cave. The demon Taoist was waiting to cook Li Xuan, preparing wine. Seeing Wenshi and the boy enter, he panicked and tried to flee. Wenshi drew from his sleeve Laozi’s ox-whip and struck him, shouting, “Wicked beast! Why do you not reveal your true form? What are you waiting for?” The demon rolled on the ground and transformed back into a blue ox, raising its horns to charge Wenshi. Wenshi pointed his hand, pressing down like Mount Tai, so the ox could neither breathe nor move, forced to lie weeping. Wenshi laughed, “This wicked beast dares be so bold! Do you know your master is angry on your behalf? Boy, take him back. His body cannot endure such force; if injured, he will never see his master again!”

The boy was scolded and furious, kicking the ox several times, cursing, “You reckless beast! You made me suffer punishment.” Wenshi laughed and advised, “Enough, he has been subdued well enough. Spare him now.” The boy put a ring through the ox’s nose and took the reins. With a shout, they rose on the clouds. Wenshi sheathed his sword and inspected the cave, driving away the small demons. He then entered the great kitchen and expelled the demons managing fire and water, finally rescuing Li Xuan.

Emerging from the pot, Li Xuan saw Wenshi’s auspicious countenance, like a golden immortal of Heaven, vastly different from the demon Taoist. Knowing him to be a true immortal testing him, he prostrated repeatedly. Wenshi smiled, “You are my junior brother; no need for such ceremony! Quickly put on your clothes and come with me to Kunlun.” Li Xuan obeyed, leaving the deadly kitchen, donning garments, and again kowtowing to thank Wenshi. “May I ask your immortal title?” he inquired. Wenshi revealed his rank and the story of his mission. Li Xuan then knew the demon Taoist was Laozi’s blue ox in mischief. Joyful that his Dao heart moved the Patriarch to accept him as disciple, he bowed again with deep gratitude. He asked, “How far is Kunlun?” Wenshi laughed, “If a mortal walked, it would take fifty or sixty years of running!” Li Xuan stuck out his tongue, speechless.

Wenshi said, “Let us go!” and beckoned. Two red clouds flew in the air. Taking Li Xuan by the hand, they mounted. Li Xuan, first time riding clouds, trembled with fear. Wenshi laughed, “You have traveled far to Mount Hua, even tasted the demon’s cooking pot. Why fear this journey?” Li Xuan smiled. Riding the cloud, the wind howled. Looking down, the world below seemed to rush backward like flight: countless towering mountains, great rivers like the Yangtze, hundreds of bustling cities, and thousands of deep forests. While admiring the view, Wenshi warned, “Do not look down too much. Your mortal body cannot bear dizziness. If you faint, you will not be able to pay respects to the Patriarch!” Li Xuan, terrified, closed his eyes and let the cloud speed on.

In no time, he heard Wenshi shout “Stop!” and opened his eyes. They had landed on a high mountain, a serene and splendid scene. Wenshi smiled, “Junior brother, this is Kunlun’s highest peak. The Patriarch’s cavern is just ahead. See those two boys coming toward us? Surely the Patriarch sent them to welcome us.” Li Xuan followed Wenshi’s gaze, straightened his robes, and walked with measured steps. Indeed, two boys came hand in hand, smiling, “Eldest senior brother has returned! The Patriarch told us to wait here.” Wenshi smiled, “Please go inside and inform him I have brought Li Xuan to wait.” The boys soon returned, beckoning, “The Patriarch commands you enter.” Wenshi led Li Xuan, who entered with reverence.

Li Xuan, filled with utmost sincerity, did not look around. He did not know how many jade towers, golden halls, and silver steps he passed before reaching the Patriarch’s great hall. Wenshi told Li Xuan to wait at the door and went inside to report the capture of the blue ox spirit and the bringing of Li Xuan. Laozi smiled warmly and ordered Li Xuan to be admitted. Wenshi returned and led Li Xuan inside. Li Xuan prostrated at the hall’s steps, saying, “Disciple Li Xuan greets the honored Patriarch, wishing him boundless sacred longevity!” Laozi bade him sit. After bowing, Li Xuan hesitated to take a seat. Wenshi laughed, “The Patriarch commands you to sit; junior brother should not be overly modest!” Li Xuan sat. Laozi looked upon Li Xuan with joy.

What caused this joy remains to be revealed in the next chapter.
