# Chapter Twenty-One: At Sun-Viewing Peak, Capturing Demons as Servants — The Calamity of the Purple Mist Cave’s Female Monster

Now, it happened that the Old Master beheld Li Xuan, whose spirit was elegant and refined, his brows arched with clarity and grace. In his heart, he felt pleased. He bade him sit down and asked, “Li Xuan, though you know matters of your former life, you may not recall them all with perfect clarity.” Li Xuan replied, “Your disciple is ignorant, unable to fathom this life itself; how could I know the past? I earnestly beseech the Patriarch to enlighten me!” The Old Master nodded, then commanded a boy to bring a bowl of pure water. With his own hand, the Old Master drew a talisman and instructed Li Xuan to hold it and observe.

Li Xuan cradled the bowl, gazing intently. Suddenly, he saw the celestial palace above Heaven’s realm, where the assembly of immortals gathered in revelry. The incense officers and flower maidens, caught in laughter and mischief, incurred the Jade Emperor’s punishment. Ten times they descended to the mortal world—this vision cleared Li Xuan’s heart instantly. Returning the pure water, he bowed and thanked the Old Master.

The Old Master smiled gently and said, “Now you understand that in your former life you possessed this root of destiny; in this life, your enlightenment has come early, guided by the Wood Star’s leading. In a flash, you have arrived at my gate. Those who attain the Dao have never done so so swiftly. First, it is your deep fortune; second, you once served as a celestial officer—though humble in rank, your innate capacity surpasses others, and having lived ten human lives without fault, you have earned Heaven’s pity; third, though fallen into the dust-net of the world, you remain unstained by a single speck—truly, you possess a predestined root, not by chance. Yet the work of cultivating the Dao is as vast as the smoky sea, boundless and unknowable. Today you have only taken the first step into the gate, entered the hall and chamber—much remains to be said, far is the journey ahead. Your future merit and practice depend entirely on yourself. Though blessed, you cannot leap to the end in one bound.”

Li Xuan bowed again to receive instruction and said, “I am but a rustic man of the mountains and streams, the lowest of the low. Having erred in my past life, how dare I neglect self-discipline in this one? Moreover, I am grateful to the Patriarch who opened Heaven and Earth’s grace, pointing out the way through confusion to awakening—truly beyond my expectations. With such fortune, I must strive diligently and hold fast; how could I again act frivolously, wasting my future and betraying Master Yin’s nurturing and the Wood Star’s guidance?” The Old Master nodded in approval, then imparted teachings: “The essence of the Supreme Dao is vast and obscure; the ultimate Dao is dim and silent. Without Dao, there is nothing; embrace the spirit in stillness. The form will correct itself, becoming pure and clear. Do not exhaust your form, do not scatter your essence, do not indulge your nature; quiet your thoughts and cease restless striving—only then can longevity be attained.” Li Xuan knelt to receive this law, his heart blossoming like a flower, worldly dust melting away.

The Old Master continued, “Those who cultivate the Dao should often wander among mountains and waters to cleanse the heart and chest; frequently perform meritorious deeds to strengthen good fruit. Now I first teach you the secret of breathing and guiding energy, the methods of Daoist exercise, along with three volumes of the Daoist scriptures: the upper and middle volumes can summon wind and rain, ride clouds and mist, call forth divine soldiers, and command thunder and lightning; the lower volume exhausts the marvels of transformation and reveals future events. From this moment, you may journey alone to Mount Hua. There lies my cultivation grotto on Sun-Viewing Peak, called Purple Mist Cave. Yet many demons and monsters dwell there; I entrust you with a treasured sword. When wielded, it grows long; when coiled, it is as fine as a thread; when released, it reaches ten thousand miles; when withdrawn, it rests before your eyes. Except for true immortals of the upper realms, none can withstand this sword’s edge. With it, you may dispel demons, protect yourself, and avoid calamity.” He then handed Li Xuan the sword’s incantation and the three volumes of scripture.

Li Xuan knelt, committing all to memory. The Old Master instructed the boy to fetch a Daoist robe, a Daoist crown, and silk ribbons, shoes, and socks—everything complete—and had Li Xuan change at once. When dressed, Li Xuan’s bearing grew ever more ethereal. The Old Master laughed, “You now truly resemble a wandering immortal. Go forth! I will have your senior brother Wenshi escort you back to the grotto. After three years, when your practice is complete, you may return to see me.” Li Xuan bowed deeply in obedience. Wenshi led him out of the cave and rode the clouds to Purple Mist Cave on Mount Hua.

At parting, Li Xuan respectfully sought guidance. Wenshi said, “The essentials of the Dao have been fully revealed by the Patriarch; you, my junior brother, are intelligent and have already grasped them. Other immortal arts lie within the classics—seek them diligently and you will attain them. I can only offer some small trinkets to celebrate your entering the grotto.” He then produced a small mirror, saying, “Hang this upon the gate; it will shine clear as crystal, making no difference between dark night and bright day, and demons, ghosts, and monsters will find it hard to approach.” He also taught the method of stilling the body: if demons attack and one’s Dao power is insufficient, one may apply this method to freeze in place, becoming motionless. Li Xuan gratefully accepted.

Wenshi added, “Since this is your first time entering the mountain, you will still rely on human help. I will send two servants to assist you.” Li Xuan was puzzled, “Where in this wild mountain shall we find people?” Wenshi laughed, “Look around you—can ordinary mortals even ascend here? Your root is different; you possess immortal bones. Also, when you ascended, Lord Wang gave you a golden pill, enabling you to endure hunger and cold, feeling no hardship. This pill was made by immortals, aided by Lord Wang to support the Daoist path; it is no common medicine. You will see, after days in the mountain and travels to Kunlun, years have passed in the mortal world, yet you felt no hunger or cold—this is the pill’s power! But its effect is limited and will soon fade. You cannot yet fully leave the mortal world. I have summoned two among the mountain demons who have some immortal affinity to serve you and obey your commands. If you need anything within a thousand li of Mount Hua, they can fetch it for you.” Li Xuan, fearing hunger and hardship in the ancient cave, was unexpectedly delighted.

Wenshi led Li Xuan outside the cave and summoned the local earth god with a hand seal, asking, “Are there any demons nearby?” An old earth god bowed and answered, “Since the Patriarch Laozi departed, this mountain and its surroundings have been troubled by a band of demons. The fiercest are a rabbit spirit and a pheasant monster. The rabbit often transforms into a man, descending the mountain to bewitch women and drain their vitality. The pheasant often becomes a woman, luring men to steal their primal yang. In recent years, many have suffered.” Wenshi growled, “This is my Patriarch’s cultivation ground—how can such beasts run wild here?” The earth god wept, “Not only the mortals below, even the earth gods here are tormented by them!” Wenshi soothed, “I will capture these pheasant and rabbit demons to serve my junior brother. All other demons will also be gradually eliminated by him. Since he has just arrived, determined to cultivate, if any mishap occurs, you must all assist and protect him. When his merit is complete, you too shall share in the reward.” The earth gods bowed and departed.

Li Xuan looked on with great admiration. Wenshi smiled, “Cultivators act on Heaven’s behalf. The gods and immortals of the Three Realms all have duties to save and aid the world. If one’s heart is upright and actions pure, truly beneficial and harmless, they will obey commands gladly; when a talisman is sent, they come at once—this is no marvel. But if one harbors selfish thoughts or improper deeds, it becomes difficult to summon them. Even if they come by law, if their hearts are unwilling, a powerful sword may repel them. Even if spared, future evil deeds will bring Heaven’s punishment.” Li Xuan accepted this teaching with awe. Wenshi chuckled, “All these secret methods are in the Patriarch’s scriptures. You are extraordinarily clever; within a month you will master several. Since you admire them, I will first teach you the method to summon spirits, useful for defense and protection.” Li Xuan joyfully accepted, committing it to heart.

Wenshi cautioned, “Summoning spirits and generals is no trivial matter; do not use it lightly except in utmost emergency. When spirits arrive, be especially humble and solemn; any disrespect brings Heaven’s fault. Know that we and the gods alike act for Heaven, saving the world. They come by summons not because we outrank them, but because each fulfills their role and duty. If you treat them lightly, Heaven’s favor will be withdrawn, and you will not summon them again.” Li Xuan solemnly replied, “Your golden words are engraved in my heart.” Wenshi laughed, “Good! Let us go now to subdue demons!” Li Xuan asked, “Alas, I did not ask the earth god where those demons dwell?” Wenshi laughed, “What matter? Why cultivate the eye of wisdom if not to see? Last time in the old ox’s cauldron, who led me there?” As they left the cave, Wenshi pointed to scattered bamboo and fallen leaves on the ground, saying, “It would be good to tidy up these two fellows! Then this would truly be a grotto of immortal cultivation. Now it is all messy and unclean—what kind of place is that?” Li Xuan felt deeply moved.

Wenshi and Li Xuan climbed the mountain peak. Wenshi used his eye of wisdom to survey all around, pointing northeast, “Junior brother, do you see? There is a half-black, half-blue aura—that must be where the demons hide.” Li Xuan could not see clearly, but after Wenshi’s explanation, he discerned the difference in atmosphere. Wenshi instructed, “Take your treasured sword and follow me closely!” They rose on clouds and in a moment arrived at the demonic aura. Landing on the cloud’s edge, they found a large mountain hollow. Behind it was a great cave, outside which many small demons tumbled and played. Seeing the two, they were startled; some stared blankly, others flew into the cave to report. Wenshi pointed and said, “Soon the demons will come out!”

Before he finished, indeed a man and woman appeared, leading many small demons, shouting and calling as they emerged. Seeing Wenshi and Li Xuan, the male demon said, “Sister, congratulations—here is your food!” The female demon smiled happily, raising her hand in salute, “Where do you two Daoists come from?” Wenshi laughed, “We have come specially to save you!” The two demons laughed aloud, “This Daoist speaks arrogantly. They cannot even save themselves—how can they save us?”

The male demon suddenly looked up, catching sight of Li Xuan’s sword flashing, and shivered. He whispered to the female demon, who nodded. At their command, hundreds of small demons swarmed, encircling the two. Wenshi laughed and drew his sword; Li Xuan did the same. With a wave of their hands, sword light flashed, and the hundreds of small demons fell with broken heads and fractured bones, one by one collapsing. Furious, the two demons drew weapons and attacked. Wenshi bade Li Xuan step back and himself advanced, battling the two alone. The demons could not withstand him and fled westward. Wenshi pursued on clouds. The demons each spat a mouthful of blue smoke, obscuring vision and emitting a foul stench that caused Li Xuan to faint.

Wenshi roared, “How dare demons show such disrespect!” He shouted and the blue smoke dispersed, the stench vanished. Chanting incantations, he called out sharply, and suddenly a thunderclap split the sky. Lord Thunder and Mother Lightning appeared, bowing and awaiting orders. Wenshi raised his hand, “Here are the rabbit and pheasant demons causing trouble. I humbly ask the honored gods to exert power and force them to reveal their true forms, but please do not harm their lives—I have use for them yet.” Thunder and Lightning replied, “By the law’s decree!” A great thunderbolt struck the demons’ heads. They felt the roaring thunder swirling above, unable to descend, and were terrified, their souls fleeing as they prostrated, crying, “Great Immortal, spare us!” Wenshi commanded, “Wretched beasts, reveal yourselves and obey my law!” The demons rolled on the ground, one transforming into a white rabbit, the other into a pheasant. Wenshi asked, “Do you demons accept my command?” They wept and pleaded, “We beg for mercy and are willing to follow the Great Immortal, holding whip and stirrup. If we betray this, may Earth and Heaven destroy us!”

Wenshi withdrew thunder and lightning and ordered, “Now you shall serve my junior brother in Purple Mist Cave on Sun-Viewing Peak. Be cautious and respectful, obey commands. My junior brother is a celestial descended to the mortal world, now receiving Patriarch’s instruction and cultivating here. Soon he will achieve true fruition, and you shall share in the blessings and merit.” The demons joyfully bowed. Wenshi instructed them to resume human form and come to check on Li Xuan. Li Xuan, poisoned deeply, remained unconscious. Wenshi blew on him and shouted, “Junior brother, rise! Your foolish elder has captured two captains for you.” Li Xuan rejoiced and bowed in thanks. Wenshi said, “You may name them as you wish.” Li Xuan replied, “Please, senior brother, bestow names.” Wenshi pondered, “The pheasant can fly midair and soar over the sea—call it ‘Fei Fei’er.’ The rabbit can climb slopes and trees—call it ‘Dian Dian’er.’” Li Xuan and the demons thanked Wenshi. Wenshi escorted them back to the cave and ordered, “Serve well. If you change your hearts, I will know immediately from Kunlun and strike you down with palm thunder, turning your bones to ash.” The demons shuddered and obeyed.

Wenshi exhorted Li Xuan a few more words, then said, “See you at Kunlun in three years!” With a kick, he vanished in a golden light, soaring to Heaven, leaving the demons prostrate, saying, “Today we are fortunate to meet a golden immortal!” Li Xuan said, “From now on, you two must cleanse your hearts and follow my cultivation. I will also teach you Dao methods from the secret scriptures granted by the Patriarch. When I succeed, I will not forget your kindness!” Fei Fei’er and Dian Dian’er rejoiced all the more.

From then on, Li Xuan practiced diligently day and night in the cave. The two demons fetched supplies from the mountain, cooked meals, swept the grotto, and obeyed orders without neglect. Yet the scriptures Li Xuan recited emitted strange light at night, illuminating far and wide, attracting many demons who suspected a great treasure and contemplated attack.

One day, while Li Xuan was practicing, a woman entered the cave, dressed in plain clothes, tears streaming down her face, crying out, “Master of the Dao, save me!” Li Xuan steadied himself and looked closely, but could not discern her path or origin. He thought, “Ordinary people cannot reach this deep mountain; perhaps a demon in disguise.” Yet he also thought, “Demons must have special circumstances. This woman is gentle and beautiful; I cannot rashly suspect her.” He asked, “Young lady, where do you come from? What grievance do you bear? Why not report to officials or seek the government, but come to this wild mountain to find me? What good will it do?” The woman wept, “I am from the Wang family in the eastern village behind the mountain. My husband died over a hundred days ago, and I cannot bear to remarry. Because my parents-in-law are poor, they sold me to a wealthy family. On the wedding night, I refused to comply. The master of that house threatened to kill me, so I fled at night. Alas, the area behind the mountain is all under the rich family’s power; I dared not escape there and fled up the mountain instead. Unaware, I climbed higher and higher until I reached this place. Now I am trapped, fearing the tiger and wolf’s belly, utterly helpless. Luckily, I met the Master cultivating here. If you do not abandon me and take me in as a servant, it would be my greatest fortune.”

Li Xuan was greatly shocked, “Young lady, how can you say such things! I, a poor Daoist, endure the bitter days of the mortal world, living in a place hard for mortals to dwell. Though I still eat, soon I must sever mortal ties. How could I support you? Moreover, this place has little trouble; small matters are handled by my two disciples. There is no need for a mortal servant. Please descend the mountain quickly and stop lingering here!” The woman wailed, “Cultivators value benevolence and righteousness most. I cherish my reputation and suffer this calamity. If you do not save me, I have no choice but death. Better to die before you than at the hands of evildoers.” Hearing this, Li Xuan’s heart softened. He thought: This woman’s sorrow is sincere; she truly guards chastity. If I do not save her, can I really watch her die? To save her, I must consult Fei Fei’er and Dian Dian’er and send her far beyond her home, hundreds of li away, so the evil cannot find her.

With this in mind, he said, “Young lady, rise. I cultivate here to establish body and life, barely keeping pace; how can I meddle further in mortal affairs? Yet you are truly virtuous and pitiful; my heart cannot abandon you. I have no choice but to make an exception. I will have my disciples escort you down the mountain to find a good family to serve as a maid, to sustain yourself. What do you think?” The woman gratefully replied, “If so, Master, you are truly my lifesaver!” She bowed to thank him, but Li Xuan hastily avoided her and said, “Please, no ceremony; it makes me uneasy. I will arrange your escort at once.” The woman hesitated, “Tonight is late; the mountain path is rugged, with tigers, leopards, and venomous insects. If misfortune befalls me, it would be worse than your saving me!” Li Xuan shook his head, “What do you propose?” She said, “I have no other wish but to stay one night and leave early tomorrow morning. I would be deeply grateful.” Li Xuan said firmly, “That cannot be! There are no female guests here, and an isolated woman and man in a wild cave invite suspicion. This is also to protect your reputation and prevent calamity. One night’s stay could harm your name, which would be unwise.”

The woman said, “No matter. You said you have two disciples; just clear their room for me to stay one night, separated by doors and walls. With Heaven as witness, what is there to fear?” Hearing this, Li Xuan grew more troubled, “Indeed! I have another worry. My disciples are not human but the rabbit and pheasant spirits who have cultivated human form. The pheasant is female, the rabbit male. I rely on the Patriarch’s power and newly accepted disciples, but I cannot be sure if their wild natures can be tamed. If they see your youthful beauty, they might act improperly. I cannot bear that! Young lady, do not doubt me. I will immediately order the pheasant disciple to escort you down. Though a strange being, the little disciple has some magic; no ordinary beast can approach you. With her protection, what do you fear?”

The woman saw Li Xuan resolute and would not relent. She stood still and then used seductive arts to entice him, smiling sweetly, revealing coquettish mien, and pressing close, saying, “Master, are you truly so cruel to let me risk the long mountain road alone at night?” This frightened Li Xuan with no place to hide; he shouted, “Fei Fei, Dian Dian, come quickly to save me!”

No sooner had he spoken than the woman’s face darkened with anger, “Fine! Li Xuan, you are truly an ungrateful fool. I showed you kindness, and you call for help to seize me! Very well! I will not trouble you further. I will snatch your so-called scriptures. If you change your mind, I will be your eternal spouse; if not, I will burn your scriptures first. I dwell in the White Jade Cave behind the mountain. I am the Lady of White Jade. If you seek me, come there!” Saying this, she seized the Daoist scriptures from the stone table, pushed Li Xuan down, and with a gust of demonic wind vanished from the cave.

By the time Fei Fei’er and Dian Dian’er arrived and joined Li Xuan in pursuit, she had vanished without a trace.

Whether the scriptures will be recovered remains to be revealed in the next chapter.
