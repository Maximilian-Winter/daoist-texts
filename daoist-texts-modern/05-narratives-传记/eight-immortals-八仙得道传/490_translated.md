# Chapter Twenty-Two: Achieving Success, Consulting the Venerable Patriarch, and Returning to See One’s Parents

Now it happened that Li Xuan was quietly cultivating his primordial功 within his chamber, when suddenly a woman, by cunning stratagem, seized his sacred scriptures. Startled beyond measure, his eyes wide and mouth agape, he rushed forth with Fei Fei and Dian Dian to the cavern’s mouth to look about—but not a trace of her could be found.

Li Xuan stamped his foot and sighed deeply, tears falling like rain. Dian Dian anxiously urged, “The demon has fled; there is no use in haste now. Best to devise a way to recover the scriptures—that is the proper course.” This reminded Li Xuan, who quickly said, “Indeed! Before she left, she said she dwells in the White Jade Cavern behind the mountain. She calls herself the Lady of White Jade. You two have been here many years—have you ever heard of such a demon’s lair? Such a spirit?” Fei Fei shook his head, “This mountain is riddled with countless caves, large and small. Though we have dwelt here long, we know little of most!”

Suddenly Li Xuan recalled, “My senior brother once taught me the method to summon spirits. Why not call upon the local earth deity to inquire? Then we shall know for certain.” Fei Fei and Dian Dian urged him on eagerly. Li Xuan complied, forming the hand seals. Before long, the venerable earth deity appeared, smiling broadly as he first thanked Li Xuan for the功 earned by capturing two demons. Fei Fei and Dian Dian stood nearby, their faces flushed with embarrassment. The earth deity glanced up and saw them, growing somewhat uneasy.

Li Xuan said, “That was then, this is now. Let bygones be bygones! We are all of one family now. Let us first discuss the urgent matter of reclaiming the scriptures.” He then asked the earth deity, “Do you know of a White Jade Cavern in these mountains?” The earth deity replied, “The White Jade Cavern lies close by, but it is not under my jurisdiction, so I know no details. I have heard that a demon dwells there, troubling travelers and devouring the unwary. It is said to be of the same ilk as these two.” Fei Fei, hearing this, poked the bald head of the earth deity twice and joked, “You old fellow, you are too sly! Here our master stands before you, yet you dare to mock us? Tomorrow, if I become a demon myself, I’ll give you a good beating—only then will you be a true hero!” The earth deity was frightened and stammered, “I was only jesting, never would I offend you two!” Li Xuan scolded, “Having entered the path of righteousness, how can you harbor such wicked thoughts? Are you not afraid to break your oath? See how my senior brother’s palm thunderclap will strike you!” Fei Fei laughed, “We’re only having a bit of fun with this old companion. No harm meant!” Li Xuan said, “Even jokes must have limits. Such transgressions are not to be spoken.” Fei Fei had no choice but to comply.

Li Xuan thanked the earth deity and sent him off. Then, taking the two along, he summoned the earth deity of the rear mountain to inquire. That earth deity appeared, his face withered and his spirit haggard, much like the first. Li Xuan asked about the demon of the White Jade Cavern. The earth deity reported, “About thirty li from here lies a mountain cave, behind which white jade is mined, hence the name. Within dwells a demon who insults the gods and devours travelers, committing many evil deeds. It is said to be born of the union between the Green Ox of the Venerable Lord Lao and a wild ox of this mountain. Born with nothing to eat, it sought out a tender white jade behind the cave as its food. Eating so much jade, it gained spiritual potency and could transform into human form. Its color is pure white, its skin delicate and tender, entirely jade-hued from head to toe, even its garments are pure white without a speck of other color. It calls itself the Lady of White Jade. She often descends the mountain to ensnare beautiful youths, bringing them back to the cave to harvest their primordial essence. When their essence is exhausted and their bodies weakened, she devours them. This has made travelers scarce and residents avoid the area; even the local earth deity’s incense offerings have ceased, leaving great hardship. Now, by imperial decree, surely a heavenly master has been sent to subdue this demon. Not only is this a blessing to the people, but also a great protection for us earth spirits!”

Dian Dian whispered to Fei Fei, “Who would have thought this demon is one of our own kind? No wonder the earth deity teased us so.” Fei Fei retorted, “If that’s so, then you should go and claim kinship with her.” Li Xuan, troubled in heart, hearing their jests, sharply rebuked, “Enough nonsense! This demon has stolen our scriptures; the three of us share the guilt. Should we not hasten to recover them? Instead, you mock each other here, lacking the bearing of immortals and the discipline of the Dao!” The two fell silent.

Li Xuan asked the earth deity further, “What powers does this demon possess?” The earth deity answered, “Her powers are not especially formidable, but she can ride clouds and summon rain, capture people at will, and wields a triple-pointed, double-edged blade with great skill. Ordinary men cannot hope to defeat her. Beyond that, nothing else is notable.” Li Xuan thanked the earth deity and sent him away. Turning to the two, he said, “This demon is indeed a bull spirit. You both have battle formations skills; go meet her in combat first. I will watch from this high peak. If you cannot prevail, I will aid you with my flying sword.” Fei Fei said, “If so, Master, just give her one sword strike! Why waste the effort of your disciples?” Li Xuan replied, “I know well that this creature has cultivated for many years to attain such skill. My treasured sword was personally bestowed by the Patriarch. One flying strike from it is hard for even immortals and spirits to withstand. How could this demon resist? If I wound her fatally, it would waste her millennia of功. I prefer to recover the scriptures and then use kind words to guide her, sparing her life and allowing her to attain her Dao fruit. That would be best. If she stubbornly refuses and we must struggle bitterly, then she seeks death herself, and I shall have no choice but to open the killing blade and rid this mountain of a great harm. Heaven’s virtue is to cherish life; immortal arts and weapons must be used only when unavoidable. If preservation is possible, why resort to cruelty? You two are naturally fierce and have committed many misdeeds; having entered my門, you should always keep this heart to atone for past faults and achieve immeasurable success in the future.” The two were deeply moved and gladly obeyed.

Arriving before the White Jade Cavern, they called out loudly, “Lady of White Jade, come forth and meet us!” The Lady, rejoicing over her newly acquired treasure, was told by her minions that a man and a woman outside were shouting, demanding to see her. She smiled, “It must be Li Xuan’s two disciples. I shall go out and meet them.” She finished her preparations, grasped her triple-pointed, double-edged blade, and stepped outside, shouting, “Are you the disciples of that poor Daoist?” The two answered, “Indeed! Since you know us, kindly return the scriptures and all will be well; but if you utter a single word of evasion, do not blame us for being ruthless.” The Lady laughed heartily, “Just a rabbit and a pheasant—what great skill have you to speak so boldly?” The two grew angry, “Don’t mock us! Look in a mirror yourself—aren’t you just a bull in disguise?” Hearing this, the Lady’s fury blazed. Brandishing her blade, she charged at them. The two drew their weapons to meet her, and they fought fifty rounds. Yet the two were no match. As they began to fall back, Li Xuan, standing atop the mountain, had already seen the battle. Hastily drawing his sword and chanting incantations, a flash of golden light shot forth.

Li Xuan still wished to spare her life, thinking, “Best to strike her a non-fatal blow.” Yet this sword was sentient; it followed the will of his heart. Before his thought was complete, the sword circled the demon’s feet and severed a bull’s leg, revealing her true form—a flawless pure white ox lying on the ground, wailing in sorrow. Li Xuan first entered the cave to retrieve the scriptures, then returned and asked the white ox, “Do you understand that I do not wish to kill you?” The ox kowtowed repeatedly. Li Xuan’s heart softened and he said, “By your deeds, you deserve death many times over! But I consider your thousand years of cultivation not easy to come by. My treasured sword would surely have slain you outright, but I have purposely only maimed a leg to spare your life. If you repent, you may come with me to the cave and work with my two disciples, chopping wood and fetching water—small tasks. Since you love my scriptures, you are fated with us. I will treat you as one of my own and teach you when I can. But if you persist in folly, see my immortal sword in hand—your life will be taken as easily as turning over one’s palm.” The white ox wailed and obeyed, rolling on the ground before transforming into a beautiful woman with a lame leg. She followed Li Xuan back, joining Fei Fei and Dian Dian at the Purple Mist Cavern.

From then on, Li Xuan’s cultivation grew more diligent and his vigilance more careful. He ordered the three to stand guard day and night at the cavern’s entrance. No matter human or demon, none were allowed entry without imperial decree. After several months, all smoke and fire were cut off. Each day, the three gathered fruits in the mountains for sustenance; their forms and spirits grew lean and clear. Within a year, having read two volumes, they could summon wind and rain, ride clouds and call forth mist—all with perfect ease. At this time, more demons came to the mountain, but all were subdued or exterminated, greatly clearing the mountain of great harms. By the time they finished the next volume, they could enter the netherworld and the abyss, transform endlessly, and know past and future affairs. Their功 had reached the stage of transcending the ordinary and entering the sacred; even the Great Golden Immortals of Heaven were not their match.

When three years had passed, Li Xuan ordered Fei Fei and the others to remain guarding the cavern. He himself rode clouds to the Eight Scenic Palaces of Kunlun Mountain to pay homage to the Venerable Lord Lao. Lao had long known of this and, with Master Wenshi leading ten generations of disciples, awaited his arrival. Li Xuan stepped forward to pay respects. The assembly of immortals all congratulated him on his success. Li Xuan humbly declined their praise. The immortals then led him to see Lao, who bestowed great honor upon him. Li Xuan asked for further instruction. Lao said, “To cultivate the Dao is to diminish daily—diminish again and again until reaching non-action. Let the heart wander lightly, the vast breath incline toward goodness, and be without selfishness toward things.” Li Xuan kowtowed and accepted the teaching. Laozi further commanded, “All immortals focus on nourishing the nature and guarding the heart, supplemented by methods and techniques. Guarding heart and nature perfects an indestructible self; cultivating techniques serves to aid and save others. Though you have attained much, your功 and conduct are still insufficient. Three years ago, I ordered you to roam the mountains and waters; now you may undertake this work, and along the way perform merit. Should you meet those fated, do not hesitate to accept them as disciples—they will all benefit you. In ten years’ time, return here to see me again.”

Li Xuan received the decree and withdrew, chatting heartily with fellow senior brothers such as Master Wenshi, Guangchengzi, Chijingzi, and the Daoist of the Burning Lamp. The immortals held a banquet on the rear mountain to celebrate. The feast overflowed with immortal wine and delicacies, endless in variety and flavor. As the honored guest having just completed his cultivation, Li Xuan was treated with utmost joy. Wenshi first laughed and said, “Virtuous younger brother, your cultivation is truly the easiest since the time of the immortals! Consider how few days have passed since you left the world, yet you have attained such achievement! Compared to us, it is hard to judge speed or difficulty.” Burning Lamp Daoist and Guangchengzi agreed, “This is due to individual fate and blessings; it cannot be forced.” Chijingzi smiled, “In truth, we few who have cultivated to immortality are already considered fast. We did not expect young brother Li Xuan to surpass us tenfold—truly admirable.” Li Xuan, modest by nature, felt uneasy at such praise and repeatedly thanked them, “It is all due to the Patriarch’s grace and the teachings of my elder brothers.” Wenshi then said, “The Patriarch once said you were originally an immortal maiden in a past life, with a firm resolve to ascend, moving the Jade Emperor to grant your current life. You have not obscured your nature and entered the Dao from youth, thus your blessings are abundant and success not difficult. In these three years, your effort has been great and diligent, hence this unexpected success. What merit do we have?” Li Xuan hastened to say, “Without the two attendants granted by senior brother, I would long ago have starved and suffered beyond imagining. How could I have today’s standing?” The immortals all laughed.

After three days, Li Xuan took leave of Laozi and the senior brothers, returning to the Purple Mist Cavern. He ordered the three youths to guard the cavern carefully and cultivate diligently. The three bowed and accepted the command. Only then did Li Xuan feel at ease and descend again to the mortal realm. This time was unlike before; he was now a realized one, everything went smoothly. He recalled that before leaving home, he had promised his parents that once he attained success, he would return to visit. Now was the perfect opportunity—both to fulfill filial duty and to see how his homeland fared.

Riding clouds, in less than half a day he arrived within Luoyang city and walked home. His father Li Qi and mother You were aged and frail, bedridden and seldom venturing out. Suddenly, the household reported that a Daoist sought an audience. Li Qi, having lost his son for many years, could hardly believe his eyes. Though he dared not lightly trust outsiders, he always treated visiting Daoists with respect. Though ill, he maintained reverence and ordered the visitor admitted. Li Xuan, seeing his father so aged, was filled with sorrow. He hurried forward, grasped his father’s legs, knelt, and bowed, saying, “Unfilial son Li Xuan pays respects to father.” Li Qi, taken by surprise, was greatly astonished. Hastily helping him up, he asked, “Are you truly my son Li Xuan? How have you returned?” Looking closely, he saw Li Xuan’s radiant spirit and handsome bearing, far improved from before, and recognized his beloved son. His joy was immense, and he had no time to ask more, only calling out, “Quick, bring out the lady! Our son who left to become a Daoist has returned!”

Inside, the lady heard this and was so overjoyed that tears and snot streamed as she hurried out. Though usually slow in movement, she now came swiftly without aid, reaching the main hall in a few steps. Li Xuan rushed forward, calling, “Mother, your unfilial son pays respects.” She said nothing, but first surveyed Li Xuan, then Li Qi, asking, “Sir, what is this talk? Are we all dreaming?” Li Qi laughed, “Nonsense. Broad daylight, no dreams here.” Li Xuan smiled, “Mother, do not doubt; it is your son who has returned!” The lady wept again. Soon many household members came to bow to the young master and congratulate the lord and lady.

The lady and Li Qi vied to ask about Li Xuan’s past affairs. Li Xuan briefly recounted the main events. The elderly couple rejoiced, “So our son’s resolve was fulfilled, he has become an immortal! We have longed for you since you left, nearly falling ill. Now, though our years grow, our bodies weaken, and we thought never to see you again. Today’s reunion is a joy beyond measure and a blessing to our family.” Li Xuan replied, “Since parting, my heart often yearned for you. But my resolve to cultivate the Dao was firm; I dared not waver nor disobey my master’s orders to visit privately. Now, having attained swift success, I am glad to see your kind faces and soothe my private heart.” Seeing his parents so feeble, he quickly took from his side two elixirs and said, “These pills were made by me on Mount Hua according to the Patriarch’s scriptures. They have the power to revive the dead and restore youth.” He ordered clean water brought in a basin and bade the two elders each take a pill. Li Qi and his wife were delighted and swallowed the pills with water. Truly, the immortal medicine’s effect was extraordinary; their eyes cleared, bodies lightened, and in an instant their gray hair turned black and all ailments vanished. Both rejoiced, “Thanks to your resolve to become a Daoist, you have truly attained the great Dao, benefiting even us old ones.” Li Xuan said, “This is nothing. When the Patriarch ascended to heaven and transformed his home into immortality, I have only now begun to understand the immortal Dao. My功 is but a fraction of his. Now I have been sent down to establish great功 and merit; I hope soon to achieve the true fruit and be appointed a Golden Immortal. Then I shall surely escort my parents to ascend the heavens with me.”

The two elders grew even happier. Yet the lady, as a woman, wished to keep her son at home for at least a year or half a year before he left again. Li Xuan pleaded repeatedly, explaining that the Patriarch’s orders could not be disobeyed. Fortunately, now that he had mastered immortal methods, he could return often, so his mother need not insist. The lady would not relent. The next morning, she ordered the young master to breakfast. But upon reaching the study, Li Xuan was nowhere to be seen. Only a letter lay on the desk, ink thick and flowing, golden light shimmering. Li Qi opened it and read Li Xuan’s explanation of his unavoidable departure and the time of their next reunion. Fearing his mother’s reluctance, he had already used earth escape術 to leave the mansion, and asked his parents to eat well and wait. Li Qi conveyed this to the lady, who then gave up.

Li Xuan left the mansion. Hearing that the southern Jiangnan’s Lushan Mountain was serene and the Qiantang West Lake’s scenery splendid, he wished to tour them. First, he rode clouds to Lushan. It was the era of the late Zhou and Warring States, and Jiangnan was considered a barbarous land. Upon arrival, Li Xuan saw the wondrous landscape, unlike the north’s mountains, and nodded with a sigh, “In the future, the earth’s energy will surely shift greatly. Though the north has many heroes and hardships, the people’s wisdom is surely less than the south’s.” After many days of wandering, he reached West Lake, its mountains and waters more beautiful than Kuanglu. Lingering many days, he suddenly met a child by the lake, weeping as if about to drown himself. Li Xuan watched carefully. The child cried once more, then cried out, “Heaven, Heaven! I, Yang Rensheng, a son, cannot save my aged mother. It is better to end my life than live in vain beneath heaven and earth!” With that, he leapt into the lake.

Li Xuan knew then that this was a filial son. Seeing him jump, Li Xuan was already prepared; he pointed his hand toward the lake, and the clear waters instantly changed. How the lake transformed and whether the child survived—this shall be revealed in the next chapter.
