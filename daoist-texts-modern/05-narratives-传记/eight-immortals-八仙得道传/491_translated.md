# Chapter Twenty-Three: The Filial Son Casts Himself into the Clear Stream to Accompany His Loving Mother; The Great Immortal Li Performs the Grand Method to Rescue Them from Peril

Now it happened that Li Xuan, upon hearing the child call himself Yang Ren, and learning that he could not save his mother, saw that the boy had thrown himself into the clear stream. Hastily, Li Xuan pointed with his finger, and the waters of the lake all congealed. Yang Ren leapt into the lake, yet it was as if he trod upon solid ground; not only was he not submerged, but his clothes, shoes, and socks remained utterly dry.

Yang Ren was greatly astonished. Looking around in all directions, he saw a figure standing before him, smiling gently. Yang Ren’s heart knew this must be no ordinary man, but since his resolve was fixed on death, he had no time for formalities. He shouted loudly, “Is it you, Daoist, who conjures this mystery? How hateful! I never wished to live in this world, and now that I have come to this desperate end, what business have I with you, a man of the Way? You toy with my stubborn will, making sport of a poor soul’s suffering!” Having spoken, he wailed aloud, lamenting to Heaven and Earth without cease.

Li Xuan, smiling cheerfully, stepped forward and tugged at Yang Ren’s clothes. Yang Ren was startled and exclaimed, “Why do you pull me so?” Before he could finish, Li Xuan laughed and said, “Open your eyes again and see where you are.”

At these words, Yang Ren opened his eyes wide and looked about. How strange it was! Just moments ago he had been at the lakeside seeking death, but in the blink of an eye, he found himself in a place he had never seen before: vermilion gates, jade-green tiles, bright windows, and spotless tables—truly the residence of a king. Looking around, there was no one else but him and Li Xuan. Li Xuan continued to grin at him with a foolish delight. Only then did Yang Ren know that Li Xuan was indeed a true immortal. Hastily, he bowed down and cried out, “Master, save my life! Master, save my life!”

Li Xuan laughed and said, “You are quite the fool. In this life, one must have a plan. Just now you threw yourself into the lake with all your might. I, a humble Daoist, out of a single thought of mercy, saved your life, and yet you blame me for meddling. Now suddenly you beg me to save you? Isn’t that a contradiction?”

Yang Ren prostrated himself on the ground, weeping bitterly, “Earlier, because I could not save my mother, I was overwhelmed and saw no way but to end my own life. Though I was taught by the immortal master, I still could not understand. Now that I see you truly are a celestial immortal from the upper realms, surely you can save my mother. If my mother is saved, I need not die, and so my heart has changed. I earnestly beseech you, Master, to show compassion!”

Li Xuan laughed, “You are truly persistent. You want to save your own life and your mother’s too. How could I, a humble Daoist, concern myself with so many debts?”

Yang Ren wept loudly, “If you do not save my mother, then what good is saving me? Better to let me die in the lake, clean and done with!”

Li Xuan laughed heartily, “If you die, how could you save your mother?” This question struck Yang Ren silent, and he could not reply at once.

After a moment’s thought, he bowed again and said, “I know the immortal master must have the power to save my mother. I only beg your great mercy to quickly lend aid. I care not for life or death, only that my aged mother escape peril. Even if my body is torn to pieces and scattered as ashes, I am willing.”

Li Xuan was pleased, “Are you sincere?”

Yang Ren swore, “If there is the slightest falsehood, may Heaven and Earth punish me, and may I never be human again through countless kalpas!”

Li Xuan laughed, “That’s the spirit! To save your mother, we need one special medicine as a guide.”

Yang Ren asked, “Master, my mother is not ill, so why must we use medicine? If a guide is needed, where shall we find it?”

Li Xuan smiled, “Whether sick or not, since you want me to save her, this medicine guide is indispensable. If you were to buy it in the market, it would cost a thousand taels of gold, and no one would be willing to sell it. But with your single-hearted sincerity, you will get it without spending a penny!”

Yang Ren, clever as he was, thought for a moment and said, “I will give you a riddle to guess, Master.”

Li Xuan said, “Excellent! Speak it.”

Yang Ren said, “Master, this medicine guide cannot be sought outside; it is far away a thousand miles, yet near at hand!”

Li Xuan laughed heartily, “What a clever boy! You’ve surely guessed it right. Come, let us set out to save your mother!”

Yang Ren was amazed, “Master, do you already know my family’s home?”

Li Xuan laughed, “Look again—where are we now?”

Yang Ren raised his head and was so frightened that his eyes widened and he fell to the ground, saying, “Master, you truly are a heavenly deity!”

Li Xuan smiled and helped him up, saying, “No need for ceremony! Since you know I am no ordinary man, why do you not ask my surname or name? Where in the world is there a rustic like you? You ask for help but do not know who I am!”

Yang Ren, hearing this, raised his small fists and struck his own forehead twice, saying, “Master, see how foolish I am! Several times I tried to ask your Daoist name or Dharma title, but never got an answer. Truly, I have become the rustic you speak of!”

Li Xuan laughed, “No need to regret. There is still time. I will tell you. My surname is Li, and my common name is Xuan. The Most High Patriarch of the Dao, Li Er, is my ancestor. Seeing your filial heart and your resolve to save yourself, I have come to aid you. After rescuing you from danger, I will also lead you out of the mundane world. Are you willing?”

As Li Xuan spoke, he studied Yang Ren’s face. At first joy, then gradually worry appeared. Li Xuan scolded, “I have done so much for you, and you are still not satisfied? Would you rather be a drowned ghost in the lake, unknown to gods or men?”

Yang Ren tearfully explained, “Master, I do not hide anything from you. You surely know my family’s affairs. I studied the classics in my youth and understand rites and righteousness, knowing that among all human virtues, filial piety comes first. Just now, because my mother was taken by force and we were powerless, I saw no other way but to end my life. But if my mother is saved and I follow you to become a disciple, for my own sake, I do not know what blessings I have earned in past lives! Yet to leave my aged mother behind in the countryside is dangerous and lacking in nourishing care; she would become either a starving ghost or a frozen spirit. This is why I dared not save myself, feeling my heart incomplete. If I offend you, Master, I deserve a thousand deaths. I beg you to open the great path of mercy, so I may fulfill both duties. That would be my greatest fortune.”

Li Xuan laughed, “They say ‘the human heart is never satisfied’—truly, truly! But I ask you: if you had died in the lake as you vowed, and could not save your mother except by being ground to dust and ashes, then once she is saved, who will care for her?”

Yang Ren, hearing this, was dumbfounded, tears flowing, speechless for a long while. Li Xuan spat and laughed, “No more girl’s talk! Come with me to see your mother!”

Yang Ren then realized all the previous words were tests by Li Xuan. Rising with a bow, he asked, “Master, where are we going now? I just saw the plaque above; this is the Mansion of the Prince of Zhongshan, the very place where my mother was taken! The steward Niu Jing lives behind the mansion; he is the one who forcibly took my mother! Strange—how could you bring me inside? Now that we are here, what will you do, and where will you lead me?”

Li Xuan commanded, “No need to ask. Close your eyes; I have a wondrous method.”

Yang Ren obeyed and closed his eyes. Soon, Li Xuan shouted, “Open!” Yang Ren opened his eyes wide and looked around. They had already changed places. Before him lay a middle-aged woman bound on the ground, crying hoarsely, “My Yang Ren, how do you know your mother suffers here?”

Hearing this, Yang Ren’s heart burned as if aflame. Forgetting Li Xuan’s orders, he wept and shouted, embracing his mother. The mother and son seemed to meet in a dream. Composing himself, Yang Ren saw Li Xuan was gone and grew anxious, “Where has Master gone?”

His mother asked, “My son, how did you come in? When did you get a Master?”

Yang Ren recounted all that had happened.

His mother rejoiced, “Immortals do not deceive. Since he promised to save us, he surely will not fail. No wonder the guards just now looked as if they had seen ghosts and fled. It was all the immortal master’s magic!” She raised her hands to the sky, “I bow and beseech the immortal master’s grace!”

Yang Ren knelt and kowtowed repeatedly, crying out, “Master, come quickly! Master, come quickly!” No sooner had he spoken than Li Xuan appeared before them, smiling, “Why such haste? I have promised to rescue you, but that Niu Jing is truly vile. I will give him a lesson. Your ladyship, it is not proper for a woman to suffer here long; please leave first. You, boy, must act as the medicine guide. Whatever I command, you must obey without defying my law. Can you do this?”

Yang Ren did not answer. His mother knelt first, “Immortal master, your mercy in saving us is a kindness beyond rebirth. My son, you must agree to the master’s commands. To disobey is to disobey your mother’s will, and you would not be a filial son!”

Yang Ren, with a troubled face, said, “How dare I disobey! But I wonder, after you save my mother, where will you place her?”

Li Xuan waved his hand, “No need for more words. Would it not be better for you to be reunited at once?”

With that, he flicked his hand over the woman’s body; the ropes binding her snapped apart. Another flick healed all her whip wounds completely, leaving no scars. Li Xuan summoned the Yellow Turban warriors, “Quickly take this lady to a Daoist temple deep within West Lake and settle her there without error!”

The Yellow Turban warriors bowed and obeyed, lifting the woman. In a gust of wind, they vanished without a trace. Li Xuan instructed Yang Ren, “In times of danger, I will invisibly guard by your side and will not let you suffer harm!”

Seeing his mother safe, Yang Ren’s courage grew. He promised one by one. Li Xuan raised his hand and pointed, transforming Yang Ren into a figure like his mother, bound on the ground. Soon the guards returned, each amazed and bewildered, as if dreaming.

One said, “Just now, some strange evil wind blew, making us dizzy and dazed.” Another said, “So many dead here, surely vengeful ghosts at work. Tomorrow we must report to the steward and ask a talisman master to cleanse this place.” Voices rose in confusion.

Yang Ren listened and smiled inwardly. After a while, someone said, “The lady has come again, to persuade this beauty?”

Soon a middle-aged woman staggered in and asked, “Where is the new beauty? The steward is very passionate and loves her deeply. Though he punished her just now, he regrets it terribly! Look, he sent me with pain-relieving pills to care for her.” She came to Yang Ren’s side.

Yang Ren pretended to moan and groan. The woman scolded the others, “How can you be so unreasonable, tying up the lady like a shuttle? If the steward finds out tomorrow, who will bear the blame?” The others hurriedly untied Yang Ren.

The woman put on a coquettish air and served Yang Ren the pills herself. Then she spoke eloquently of how the steward loved and cared for him. Yang Ren said nothing at first, then replied, “If I am to obey, it must be with good counsel. Why was I beaten so badly at the slightest disagreement? Since you say the steward has repented, I accept his sincerity and will comply. But he must understand that though I am a widow from the common folk, I come from a respectable family. If he wishes to marry me, he must hold a ceremony to honor Heaven and Earth and ask the Prince to officiate. If he abandons me later, I will seek the Prince’s protection.” The woman agreed eagerly, “That can be arranged. Though the Prince and steward differ in rank, they are as close as brothers. The Prince never contradicts the steward’s words, much less on such a small matter. Lady, rest assured; I will handle everything.” Saying this, she left happily.

Turning back, she loudly warned the others, “Take good care of the lady. Tomorrow she will become our mistress. If anyone dares disrespect her, beware the steward’s wrath. No one has a second head to bear the punishment!” With that, she strode away with exaggerated steps.

After the meal, the woman returned with news, “The Prince himself, moved by the steward’s plea, will come to witness the ceremony. Today is an auspicious day; the wedding will be tonight.” Yang Ren remained silent.

Then the woman took charge, leading a group of women to dress Yang Ren in bridal clothes and a coronet. Everyone smiled, waiting for the auspicious hour to escort Yang Ren out to wed the steward. Yang Ren was confident and carefree, letting them carry him as if his feet never touched the ground, swept like a whirlwind to the great hall.

Peeking, he saw twin phoenix candles glowing, lamps red and green, the hall filled with bustling guests, all joyous and ready to feast on the steward’s wedding wine. At that moment, the steward appeared, accompanied by the Prince of Zhongshan and a crowd of friends, standing beside Yang Ren on the red carpet as if playing some game.

The master of ceremonies sang out, “The auspicious hour has come. We invite the new lord and bride to bow to Heaven and Earth!”

At that call, Li Xuan, hidden beside Yang Ren, slapped his head and shouted, “The time has come! Do not bear an evil name for your mother! Act now!”

Yang Ren felt his courage surge tenfold. Stretching out his hands to block left and right, he sent the guests and family stumbling backward. One by one they lost their footing and retreated. The poor steward, pale from wine and lust, stood beside Yang Ren and bore the brunt of the push. When Yang Ren’s hand touched him, it felt like Mount Tai pressing down. The steward fell backward, landing face down, spitting blood, unable to move.

The family shouted, “Don’t let the demon woman escape!” and rushed forward, brandishing sticks to surround the steward. Yang Ren roared and revealed his true form: a boy of more than ten years, barehanded, fighting off the crowd. No weapon could harm him; every blow left his body unscathed. His fists struck others, who could not withstand the force—either wounded or falling down.

Yang Ren’s eyes caught the Prince of Zhongshan standing at the head, shouting, “Strange! Strange! Rebellion! Rebellion!”

Li Xuan secretly gave instructions to drive off the attackers. Yang Ren leapt forward, seized the Prince like a chick, and slammed him to the ground, knocking him unconscious a hundred and twenty times. The Prince cried out, “It’s not my doing! Not my doing!”

Yang Ren lifted him up and counted off, “You are the ruler of a state, yet you condone your servants in forcibly seizing a chaste widow from the people and even officiate at the wedding. Is this not a great crime?”

The Prince hurriedly said, “I did not know the full story. I only knew he took a woman as a concubine, not that he committed such crimes. Now please release me, and I will personally investigate and punish him severely.”

Yang Ren laughed, “If that is so, you need not trouble yourself.”

Li Xuan revealed himself, waving his sleeve. A golden light filled the hall, blinding all eyes. He and Yang Ren mounted a cloud, shouting, “Prince of Zhongshan, hear this! I am a true immortal from the upper realms, sent to observe good and evil among mortals. Since you admit your fault, you are pardoned. But that villain Niu Jing shall not be spared! Punish him severely! Investigate his wealth and compensate the families he harmed. This will be your merit. If you dare conceal the truth, do not blame me for being ruthless. I await your reply in the heavens within three days.”

Having spoken, they ascended on clouds. The Prince hurriedly led the crowd to bow and send them off, saying, “A true immortal has descended to punish Niu Jing. He cannot be forgiven. If he is, even I shall suffer Heaven’s wrath.”

At once, the Prince summoned the captain of the guards, had Niu Jing imprisoned, his crimes made clear, and beheaded in the market square. A proclamation was issued inviting victims to come forward. Niu Jing’s ill-gotten wealth was distributed to those he had harmed, thus settling this grave case.

Meanwhile, Li Xuan led Yang Ren to the Daoist temple where his mother was. The mother and son met as if reunited after death, tears falling like rain. Yang Ren, still a child at heart, recalled the punishment of Niu Jing and could not help but clap his hands and laugh aloud.

His mother scolded, “How rude you are, like a beast! We owe our lives to the immortal’s power, having escaped the tiger’s jaws. Now, while I am still grieving and weeping here, you laugh so wildly! What kind of manners are these? And with the master here, you do not even bow to thank him, but make a fool of yourself. You should be beaten to death!”

Yang Ren, chastened, hurriedly prostrated and apologized, “How dare I be rude! I was only amused recalling the immortal’s punishment of those villains. It seemed so curious that it made me laugh.”

His mother scolded, “What is there to laugh at? Hurry and bow to thank the immortal master!”

Yang Ren scrambled up and followed his mother to kneel together before Li Xuan. Li Xuan quickly turned aside to avoid them.

His mother wept, “If not for the immortal master’s rescue, we would now be at the gates of the underworld! How could we still be alive? One bow cannot repay even a fraction of your kindness. When we return, we will set up a shrine to the immortal master and worship morning and evening, to show our filial sincerity.”

Li Xuan blushed and stammered, “Madam, please do not be so formal. Those who leave the world to become Daoists save those in peril and bestow kindness where there is good. This matter was all due to your son’s filial heart. I, a humble Daoist, dare not claim credit. Only one thing I must say: I told your son that because he is young and filial, his roots are not bad. Seeing his immortal bones, free of dust and defilement, such a person is ill-suited to be an official or clerk. It is best for him to become my disciple. In less than twenty years, his achievements will be remarkable. Then, whether you see him or not, you will benefit. Though your son agreed with you, his heart still thinks of you. But the Daoist path honors loyalty and filial piety above all and would never sever mother and son. Even in your daily life, I have methods to support you so you will suffer no hardship. Madam, this is my humble concern. I wonder if you will consent to part from your son for now?”

His mother pondered long and spoke words yet to be told. How she replied will be revealed in the next chapter.
