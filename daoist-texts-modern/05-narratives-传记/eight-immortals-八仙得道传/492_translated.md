# Chapter Twenty-Four: Immortal Li Wields Magic to Caution the Licentious; Filial Son Yang Moved by Virtue Enters the Profound Dao

Meanwhile, Yang’s mother spoke to Li Xuan, saying, “Revered Immortal Master, your kindness in nurturing my son—how could we, mother and child, not feel deeply grateful? Even if my late husband were aware in the netherworld, he would surely look up in gratitude. Yet there is one difficulty I dare not withhold from your honor. Consider that Niu Jing is the chief steward of the Zhongshan Prince’s mansion, enjoying the prince’s utmost trust; thus he dares act so recklessly. Though this time the great Master’s power saved us from peril, I fear that once you depart, that scoundrel will surely seek revenge. Though my son may not be able to protect me, having him by my side seems to embolden my courage somewhat.”

At this, Li Xuan laughed heartily and said, “Madam, please lay aside one hundred and twenty-eight worries. That villain Niu has already been turned upside down by me and your son. Before long, the Zhongshan Prince will sentence him to death, and the millions he seized and extorted will be returned to the many families he harmed. Even if you, madam, are not greedy for these unexpected riches, nor wish to reclaim your losses, you will certainly no longer suffer his machinations. This I, a humble Daoist, can guarantee. If madam doubts, please ask your son carefully. The reason for his joyful laughter just now lies in these matters, does it not?”

Yang’s mother, hearing this, found no cause for disbelief but wished to understand the truth fully. She promptly rebuked Yang Ren, saying, “It is your turn to speak; why do you fall silent again?” Yang Ren hurriedly replied, “It is not that I will not speak, but since the Immortal Master is speaking with mother, how could I interrupt? Now I am about to report to mother.”

Li Xuan, seeing their propriety, nodded inwardly with approval and thought: In this perilous time, the mother and son do not neglect the rites of seniority and respect—truly admirable. Smiling gently, he said, “Young master, quickly tell your mother what we have done. Once we finish speaking, we shall settle a plan for advance and retreat. This humble Daoist roams the misty mountains and waters, claiming no fixed home, and cannot stay here long.” Yang Ren then recounted the above events in full.

When he finished, Yang’s mother smiled faintly and said, “The wondrous workings of the Immortal Way are indeed different. Such licentious villains deserve severe punishment; otherwise, if there were no royal law nor Heaven’s justice, the world would truly fall into chaos. May I ask, Immortal Master, if my son must follow you, it would be a great blessing indeed. Yet as a widow, though he is my only child, I cannot bear to show the slightest indulgence that might delay his studies or bury his innate nature. But the love of a mother for her child is hard to escape. If my son must go, when might he return again?”

Li Xuan replied, “Madam, your insight is profound. You must know that all gatherings and separations are allotted by fate. For example, I myself cultivated the Dao in the far north; how did I come to this place but by Heaven’s decree, where I met your son? Even if we had arranged beforehand, such a meeting could hardly be so timely. If your son had a thousand lives, they would have long since ended. By the reckoning of fate, your son was destined for this calamity, and I was destined to save him. Thus, despite the thousand li and mountains and waters between us, strangers meeting on the road, this bond was formed. Is this mere chance? Surely there is a principle within. This principle is what the Daoists call ‘predetermined fate,’ and what the Confucians call ‘Heaven that acts without intention yet accomplishes.’ Such is the teaching.”

Hearing this, Yang’s mother felt a sudden clarity but also a pang of sorrow. She said, “According to the Immortal Master’s meaning, it seems the widow and my son may never meet again?” Before Li Xuan could answer, Yang Ren suddenly wept bitterly and said, “If that is so, I would rather serve my mother faithfully, accompanying her at her knees all my life. If there is truly an immortal fate, I will await it after mother’s hundred years have passed. For now, I beg the Immortal Master’s pardon to grant me a leave of several decades.” Yang’s mother, seeing her son’s grief, wept silently but said nothing, waiting quietly for Li Xuan’s guidance.

Li Xuan sighed and said, “Madam, your words show a certain misunderstanding. Life is but a dream. We cannot even know our own birth and death; how much less the meetings and partings of mother and child or husband and wife—there is no fixed rule. For example, the three of us here met today without cause. Before this meeting, madam, did you ever imagine that on this year, this month, this day, this hour, a certain Li Xuan would come to meet you? I, Li Xuan, having cultivated the Dao, can foresee the future, yet I would never have thought without cause that on this very day I would meet you and your son. Meetings have no fixed time; separations are no more certain; dispersals are unpredictable; gatherings even harder to foresee. Thus, madam, you and your son, relying on each other in hardship, at this moment of parting, naturally feel many attachments. Though you know the future is uncertain, your feelings cannot be helped—such is human nature, and even one like this humble Daoist, whose heart dwells in emptiness and who lives in the misty realm, cannot escape it. I myself do not even know if I truly exist, much less an outsider. I advise you, virtuous madam, your son’s heavenly talent must not be wasted; life’s fleeting time must not be squandered. Since he has now glimpsed the great Dao and immortals are not mere fables, you should seize the moment, decisively cut your attachments, and let him go. Though I dare not recklessly reveal Heaven’s secrets, I promise your son will return home after twenty years of cultivation, when you may meet again. By then, your son will have accomplished great things, and your reunion will be long and enduring, never to part again. Is that not far better than these few decades of clinging dependence? I, a Daoist monk, dare not meddle or force anyone. My earnest counsel comes only from pity and respect for your filial devotion, and to fulfill a great vow. I hope that by your noble example, Heaven’s way will repay kindness and serve as a model for all people, so that even after hundreds or thousands of years, all may heed this teaching. This too will be your merit and virtue. I merely fulfill my duty as a cultivator of the Dao. I have said all I must. Whether you agree or not, the decision is yours. Should you choose not to part, that too is human nature and no fault; I will take my leave at once. But when you seek me again in the future, you may only sigh in vain regret, lamenting that you waited too long.”

Yang’s mother, resolute, rose and folded her robes to bow deeply, saying, “The Immortal Master’s words are like gold and stone. Your heart is Heaven’s heart. This widow’s shallow view nearly caused offense and delayed my son. Now, having received your enlightenment, my heart is clear. Even now, I will send my son to follow you. Surely he will be better by your side than under this widow’s care? I am at peace. Once spoken, my heart will not waver. Do not speak of twenty years—even fifty or sixty or seventy or eighty years—if my son fails to cultivate diligently and attain the Dao, he will be a most unfilial rebel. Even if he returns, I vow not to see him.” Li Xuan heard this and was greatly impressed. Yang’s mother bade her son bow to the teacher. Though still reluctant, Yang Ren was sternly admonished by his mother and dared not disobey. He bowed eight times to Li Xuan. Li Xuan personally escorted Yang’s mother home, transforming stones into gold to provide for her expenses. He drew a boundary on the ground to form a city wall, guarding against night thieves. Then, taking a worn brush, he painted dozens of fierce ghosts. Should danger arise, they could be hung in the room, and by invoking Master Li’s command to protect the household, these ghosts would manifest to repel invaders. Yang’s mother gratefully accepted and obeyed.

Later, some local ruffians, seeing Yang’s mother well supplied, suspected she had hidden wealth and gathered a gang to rob her. They burst into the gate, shouting and howling. Yang’s mother quickly hung the painting, and by the prescribed method, the bandits saw countless fierce ghosts wielding knives and spears come forth to resist them. Terrified, the thieves fled for their lives. Unknown to them, Li Xuan’s city-drawing could be entered but not escaped. Yang’s mother roused the neighbors, who captured all the villains. Not wishing to cause trouble, she spoke kindly and sent them away. From then on, no villain dared to harass her again.

Ten years later, Li Xuan saw that Yang Ren’s heart was sincere in cultivation, and that the lady was aged and longed for her son day and night. By Li Xuan’s grace and command, Yang Ren was ordered to descend the mountain and bring his mother northward, allowing them to meet once a year to fulfill their filial love. But that is a later tale.

Li Xuan took Yang Ren north from Qiantang, crossing the river to the land between Qi and Lu. There he found a grotto abode at the foot of Mount Tai, named the Boundless Grotto, where breathing and energy exchange methods were taught. He ordered Yang Ren first to practice the work of nourishing the heart and circulating qi. Since this was his first cultivation, and as Wen Shi had once protected Li Xuan himself, besides magical protection, Li Xuan summoned from Mount Hua the Lady of White Jade to serve him. Because her name was too presumptuous, she was renamed Jade Maiden. Every three years she would come to Mount Tai to test Yang Ren’s skill and give timely instruction. Though Yang Ren had good nature, he could not compare to Li Xuan, who was born with an immortal root and after ten years of cultivation severed all mortal ties and mastered cloud-riding and spirit-summoning arts. According to Li Xuan, Yang Ren’s progress was already remarkably swift compared to ordinary cultivators.

Now, leaving Yang Ren’s affairs aside, let us speak of Li Xuan himself. After gaining Yang Ren, he continued roaming the south and north lands and islands at sea. Within ten years, he performed many deeds to aid people, benefit the world, eliminate evil, and restore peace. When the twenty-year term was nearly complete, recalling the ancestral master’s promise, he first returned to the Purple Mist Grotto on Mount Hua for a visit. Originally, Li Xuan had descended to the mortal realm alone to roam, but left Fei Fei and Dian Dian behind in the grotto to cultivate. Grateful for Li Xuan’s teachings, they dared not neglect themselves. Over several years, their progress was remarkable; they could shed their skins and bones, forever leaving behind their beastly forms to become earth immortals of eternal youth. In leisure, they also sympathized with Li Xuan’s heart. Whenever demons and monsters disturbed the human realm around the mountain, they would exert effort to subdue and eliminate them, earning many merits. The grotto and its surroundings were arranged with elegance and serenity, planted with many immortal flowers and fruits, and home to numerous immortal birds and beasts. Compared to Li Xuan’s days, it was even more orderly and tranquil, truly a celestial immortal village, a golden immortal’s abode. Li Xuan, arriving at the grotto, was pleased in his heart. He examined their merits and studies, noting their progress in every respect, and could not hide his joy. Seeing the two prostrate before him, he beckoned them to rise. They stepped aside.

Li Xuan said, “Since I descended the mountain that year, following the ancestral master’s law, I have roamed the mortal world. Though I have not achieved great deeds, I have taken one disciple with root and capacity, and established some merit in aiding the world. I feel ashamed that my accomplishments are still too few to face the ancestral master. Now that you have my orders, you can accomplish many good deeds. Your wisdom and good conduct surpass mine. Upon entering the grotto, I saw how you arranged all before and behind the mountain, inside and outside the cave, with great elegance and cleanliness. I knew you had great potential. It is not that I love these external things, but this shows your diligence and dedication. If small matters are so, great ones can be imagined. Upon further examination, it was as expected—this is my greatest joy. You advance so earnestly; whether you have original roots or are just beginning, you will surely soon attain enlightenment.”

Fei Fei and Dian Dian knelt hurriedly and said, “All thanks to the master’s guidance and support. We, born as beasts, could hardly have hoped for such skill. Your praise makes us feel ever more ashamed.” Li Xuan nodded and said, “You have entered the human path and do not hide your origins; this shows your self-restraint and effort. Rise! Rise! I will now teach you the essential secret of cultivating and nourishing the heart and nature. This secret is unlike ordinary methods or common magic; it is the supreme work of immortals to cultivate body and life. Once successfully practiced, you may truly live as long as Heaven and Earth. Moreover, by accumulating merit, in several hundred years you may run alongside the immortals of Heaven, freely visiting the Precious Palace of the Numinous Void and the Three Isles of Penglai.”

The two wept with joy and bowed again. Li Xuan continued, “I cannot stay long here this time. Tomorrow I must go to the Eight Scenic Palace on Mount Kunlun to pay respects to the ancestral master, following the ancient law. You must be very good to each other and need no further admonition; just work diligently here. I have a new disciple named Yang Ren, and have sent Jade Maiden to Mount Tai to serve him. But his skill is shallow; you two should visit him twice within three years to test whether he is steadfast and diligent. Report back to me, and I will decide. Yang Ren has excellent root capacity and filial devotion that moves Heaven; his success will be swift. I am eager to promote him. After paying respects to the ancestral master, I plan to personally instruct him.” They answered obediently.

The next day, Li Xuan sat upright in the grotto. At midday, suddenly celestial music sounded brightly in the air. He rose and said, “This must be the ancestral master sending for me.” Straightening his robes, he stepped outside. Sure enough, clusters of colorful clouds descended from Heaven. Within them was a youth in blue robes, holding a whisk and controlling a crane, awaiting him. Li Xuan hastened to bow thrice, saying, “What merit have I, Li Xuan, to deserve such honor from the ancestral master?” The youth replied, “The ancestral master and many senior brothers await your arrival! Please ascend quickly!” Li Xuan kowtowed and mounted the crane’s back, soaring into the sky. The celestial clouds and music faded into the distance. Fei Fei and Dian Dian admired in awe, exchanging words: “To cultivate immortality to such a degree—only then is the hardship worthwhile.”

Setting aside their private talk, let us say Li Xuan arrived outside the Eight Scenic Palace, alighting on a cloud and dismounting the crane to await the ancestral master’s summons. Two youths smiled and said, “Brother, you are too courteous. The ancestral master has sent us to welcome you. Just enter to pay respects; no need for formal announcement.” Li Xuan whispered, “I am not like you juniors; it is rare for me to come here. How dare I be careless?” The youths smiled and left. Soon they returned, saying, “The ancestral master invites you in.” Li Xuan adjusted his robes and hat, and with slow, bent steps followed the wall into the hall. There he saw the Old Lord seated in the great hall upon a lotus throne, surrounded by generations of immortals standing nearby. Seeing Li Xuan arrive, they all bowed deeply. Li Xuan first performed eight great bows to the Old Lord before daring to meet the immortals.

The Old Lord smiled and said, “You have done some real work in these ten years. Now you may complete your tasks. There are debts from past lives and bonds in this life; debts must be repaid, and bonds quickly resolved.” Saying this, he looked up to Heaven, smiled faintly, and closed his eyes. Li Xuan, puzzled, was about to inquire when the Lord suddenly opened his eyes and said, “Your parents wish for your transcendence. If you do not seize this chance to act swiftly, you will only cause them to endure more suffering in the mortal world, which is also your fault.” Li Xuan kowtowed and said, “Yes, master.” The Lord said, “Go now! When you have transcended your parents, come see me again!” Li Xuan obeyed and withdrew.

How Li Xuan will enlighten his parents remains to be told in the next chapter.
