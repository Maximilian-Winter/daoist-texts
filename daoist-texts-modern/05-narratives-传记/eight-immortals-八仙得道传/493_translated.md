# Chapter Twenty-Five: The Old Lord Reveals Cause and Effect Through Verse — Li Xuan Loses His Dharma Body Amidst the Fire Tribulation

Now, it happened that Li Xuan, having received the Old Lord’s sacred instructions, returned home to enlighten his parents, guiding them to ascend the immortal realm together. Li Qi and his wife were both originally endowed with good roots; Li Qi himself was a loyal and upright minister in the court. Generally, loyal ministers and filial sons possess the purest hearts and are closest to immortality. Moreover, having received the elixir from Li Xuan, they had already shed most of the dust and turbidity of the mortal realm. At this moment, their spirits were clear and their aspirations lofty. Awakened by Li Xuan’s single word, the couple instantly attained great enlightenment. They cast away all worldly attachments completely and entered the mountains to cultivate the dao. After another fifty years, Li Xuan would lead them to transcend as Earth Immortals. This was the final fate of Li Qi and his wife; the story will not dwell further on them.

Having settled his parents’ affairs, Li Xuan then recalled his second matter of concern. He returned to petition the Patriarch. The Old Lord, before Li Xuan could speak, laughed and said, “Your parents have already been enlightened by you, returning to the correct path of cultivation — truly a joyous matter. Now you may repay the vow you made at birth. There will be someone who invites you to oversee a dao gathering. Though the host of that gathering is not from my lineage, they are still disciples of the dao. In time, you two will have the opportunity to work together again. You must watch carefully and be prepared.” Li Xuan kowtowed and asked, “May I ask, Patriarch, where must I repay this ancient vow?” The Old Lord thundered, “I have a verse for you; remember it well:  
‘Fasting alone cannot suffice,  
Though the cart is light, the road is familiar.  
To regain the old form and body,  
One must meet the new visage.’”  
He added, “You come from the field of right and wrong, and you will go to the place of right and wrong. The one you seek still steadfastly guards their home for you. Only after you have seen them can they leave to cultivate the dao.”

Hearing this, Li Xuan suddenly understood. He bade farewell to the Old Lord and, riding the clouds, first arrived at the Bixia Cavern. Yang Ren knelt to welcome him inside. Li Xuan examined Yang Ren’s recent cultivation progress and found it swift and pleasing. He praised him with a few words and then instructed, “I have newly received from the Patriarch the technique of soul wandering. After seven days, the stubborn shell may be discarded. You must then burn my physical form without hesitation. Because the soul clings to the shell, when it returns it must reunite with the stubborn body. When ascending to Heaven, this causes extra trouble. It is better to burn it early. But do not burn it before seven days have passed, lest the soul and body fail to separate fully, leaving the soul homeless and doomed to wander as a lost spirit.” Yang Ren obediently complied. Li Xuan lay stiff on the bed, silently chanting incantations. His soul had already left the body, journeying directly southward.

From atop Mount Jin, he gazed upon the river realm, his heart and mind greatly expanded. Traveling along, he reached the foot of Mount Jin, where he inquired about a certain Miss He, known for many extraordinary deeds in immortal cultivation. Joyfully, he thought, “Here is where I may fulfill my ancient vow.” Thus, he sought an audience.

Miss He Lanxian had been cultivating at home for over twenty years. One night, she dreamed that the Mysterious Lady appeared and instructed, “The one you must wait for is surnamed Li, named Xuan, a disciple of the Old Lord. He has already attained the dao ahead of you. He has vowed to witness your leaving the home to seek the dao before he will realize his own true fruition. This man will arrive tomorrow at noon. Wait well for him; I have gone.” Having spoken, the vision vanished. Lanxian was startled but enlightened, recalling the dream as vividly as reality. Early the next morning, she told her parents, who said, “An immortal’s dream is never mistaken. Our daughter must sincerely await this immortal’s arrival.” Lanxian agreed.

At noon, Li Xuan indeed arrived. Lanxian was both astonished and joyful. She changed into a new dao robe, holding a dust whisk, and gracefully stepped out to greet Li Xuan with a respectful bow. Smiling, she said, “Last night, the Mysterious Lady revealed in a dream that the Immortal Lord would surely arrive this noon. I have waited respectfully for a long time.” Li Xuan laughed and replied, “I dare not accept such praise. The Immortal Maiden and I were banished together for ten lifetimes — truly, we are friends beyond the mundane world. Past lives weigh heavily on my heart. Now, fortunately, the Immortal Maiden has reincarnated and returned to the true path without obscuring her numinous spirit. The future holds hope for her to become a Golden Immortal, and her true fruition is imminent. I cannot help but admire her deeply.” Lanxian smiled, “Immortal Lord, you flatter me too much. I was born fond of the dao and received instruction from the Mysterious Lady, gaining some understanding of the path. But my vow is strong: I desire to see the day you attain the dao and ascend to Heaven before I myself commit to true cultivation and surrender my life. Now, seeing your radiant presence and hearing from the Mysterious Lady that you have already bowed to the Patriarch, your future is vast and immeasurable. Truly, you fill me with joy beyond expectation.” Hearing this, Li Xuan rose solemnly and thanked her repeatedly. The two conversed for several days on cultivation skills and the secrets of initiation, advancing even deeper than the teachings previously bestowed by the Mysterious Lady. Lanxian expressed her gratitude.

Unnoticed, six days passed. Li Xuan urged Lanxian to seize this opportunity to leave home, travel famous mountains and rivers, seek renowned masters and worthy friends, strengthen her sinews and bones, and sever worldly ties — all the foundation for accomplishing the dao and establishing merit. Lanxian kowtowed and accepted his teaching. At dusk that day, she bowed to her parents, expressing gratitude for their nurturing and her intention to leave home. Just as her parents tried to detain her, Li Xuan raised his sleeve, revealing a great round portal before her. Inside were palaces, flowers, trees, spacious and resplendent — sights unseen in the mortal world. Lanxian’s heart brightened and she leapt through the gate.

Her parents saw before them a city wall suddenly appear, identical in color to Li Xuan’s robe, but Lanxian was trapped outside the wall. They clearly heard her call out, “Father, Mother, take care! Your daughter is leaving,” yet could not see where she was. After a while, the wall vanished, and all returned to normal at home. Neither Li Xuan nor Lanxian knew where she had gone. Her parents, knowing Li Xuan had come to enlighten their daughter, could do nothing. Fortunately, they had borne several more children in recent years and no longer dwelt much on Lanxian, allowing her to pursue the dao freely. This, however, is not the place to elaborate.

As for Li Xuan, after escorting Lanxian outside the gate, he never met her again. A cloud bore her to a natural stone cavern atop Mount Heng in Jiangnan. Lanxian hid in his sleeve for a time, when suddenly a voice called near her ear: “Miss He, Miss He, this is your place of cultivation. Work diligently for ten years. A master will come to promote you. Be mindful, and never begin with zeal only to slacken later, lest you invite heavenly punishment and calamity. Take heed, take heed. I depart now.”

Lanxian opened her eyes and saw she was atop a great mountain. The mountain’s scenery resembled the view inside Li Xuan’s sleeve so closely that she sighed at the wondrous workings of the immortals, overwhelmed with admiration. From then on, Miss He cultivated alone in this stone chamber on Mount Heng. Within five years, she could dispel all mortal smoke and fire, subsisting daily on wild fruits found in the mountains. Sometimes she could go ten days or half a month without eating or drinking, feeling no hunger or thirst. Later still, the Mysterious Lady herself descended to the mortal realm, took her as a disciple, and taught her a secret manual of the Jade Void. Miss He’s progress then accelerated remarkably. But that is a tale for another time.

Now, it is urgent to return to Li Xuan’s story. After sending Miss He back to Mount Tai, only six days had passed since his departure and return. On the journey, Li Xuan felt a tremor in his heartstrings, as if some matter weighed heavily on his mind. Immortals fear emotional disturbance above all; once the heart stirs, great events inevitably follow. Even a faint thought can brew disaster and invite heavenly punishment. Though Li Xuan could foresee some things, without calculation he could not discern clearly. He halted mid-air, gathered his spirit, and silently calculated. Usually, all matters, great or small, were clear at a glance. Now, however, things appeared vague and uncertain — as if he faced a calamity, yet also as if nothing obstructed him. As the common saying goes, “Matters unrelated to the heart confuse those who care.” Since this was a personal matter, his mind was already restless, and naturally his spirit could not unify. This is a fixed principle; only a few heavenly immortals can transcend this circle. The Buddhists call “no-self, no-I” the highest achievement, precisely for this reason. Though Li Xuan could not clearly calculate, he suddenly recalled the Patriarch’s parting words and the four lines of verse. Though still puzzled, the Patriarch’s tone was calm, suggesting no great calamity. So he calmed his spirit and hurriedly rode the clouds home. Yet upon entering his cave, he sensed something amiss — not only was Yang Ren missing, but his stubborn body was nowhere to be found. Sitting down, he recalculated and finally understood.

After Li Xuan departed, Yang Ren had indeed guarded his physical form with trembling care, not daring to move a step. Six days and half a day had passed — the appointed time to burn the body was near. While doubling his vigilance, suddenly a countryman burst into the cave. Yang Ren recognized him as his neighbor, Zhou Xiaoguan, a childhood playmate with whom he had not met for a long time. Yang Ren was greatly surprised but remained at his post, not moving or standing, and urgently asked why he had come and if there was an emergency. After catching his breath, Zhou Xiaoguan explained that Yang Ren’s mother was gravely ill and wished to see him once more. Zhou had come on her behalf.

Readers may recall that when Yang Ren arrived at Mount Tai, he was ordered by Li Xuan to relocate his mother to Tai’an, just over one hundred li from Bixia Cavern. Zhou Xiaoguan, a merchant traveling north and south, always visited Yang’s mother to pay respects and had once been to Bixia Cavern. Now, by chance, he was at Yang’s home and, seeing her grave illness and longing for her son, had come without hesitation to summon Yang Ren. Hearing this, Yang Ren was both shocked and pained, torn between urgency and duty. If he returned, he feared neglecting his master’s instructions and delaying his cultivation. If he stayed, he feared arriving too late to bid farewell to his mother. He was caught in a dilemma, staring blankly at Zhou Xiaoguan, speechless. Zhou urged him, “Brother Yang, what’s the matter? Your mother is holding on with her last breath, waiting for you to say farewell. Why do you guard a corpse like a fool? If you delay and she passes before you arrive, never able to say goodbye, would that not be a lifelong regret?” Only then did Yang Ren tearfully say, “To tell you the truth, this lying here is my master. He is not dead but in a strange state. Only one day remains for me to fulfill my duty. How can I leave now?”

Zhou Xiaoguan laughed heartily, “No wonder your mother said you’ve become a little daft from all this dao learning. No one has ever heard of a person returning after six days dead. Even if your master is accomplished, he gave you seven days. You have guarded him for six and a half. Another half day is seven. Do you think it’s so coincidental that he would return in that brief moment? Surely, he’s teasing you. In my opinion, you have done ninety-nine percent of your master’s task. Missing the last bit won’t bring blame. But your mother’s time is now — this is your last chance to see her. Weighing the matter, you must decide what comes first.”

Yang Ren hesitated, “If I follow your advice, what should I do with my master’s physical form?” Zhou smiled, “Is that not easy? Just do as your master instructed.” Yang Ren replied, “What if my master returns early or late, and I destroy his body? I have received his great kindness and have never repaid it. If I burn his body and leave his soul homeless, even if I die a thousand deaths, it won’t suffice. What then?” Having spoken, Yang Ren bowed over Li Xuan’s body and wept bitterly. Touching the form, he felt the dharma body cold as ice, utterly devoid of warmth. Startled, he told Zhou Xiaoguan. Zhou then exclaimed, “Wake up, brother! After six days, the body is rotting. Do you still expect him to return? If your master is truly a godly immortal, immortals do not die so easily. They prize the body’s ascension; the shell is meant to be discarded. Burning it will do no harm. If your master cannot part with this stubborn shell, he is hardly a true immortal. Hurry, brother, your mother is about to pass. She has summoned all her strength to wait for you. How can you care only for your master and not for your mother who gave you life?”

Hearing this, Yang Ren’s grief overwhelmed him. Without a moment’s thought, he rose, knelt before his master’s body, bowed countless times, and wept inconsolably. Until midnight passed and dawn neared, Zhou Xiaoguan arrived to help summon laborers and arrange the funeral.

Alas, neither Yang Ren nor the self-proclaimed worldly funeral master truly understood the rites. Moreover, times had changed; today’s funerary customs did not necessarily accord with ancient rules. Rather than feigning expertise and inviting ridicule, it was better to keep things simple. Besides, the reader is surely eager to know how Li Xuan regained his soul after losing his dharma body. There is no need to linger on these minor funeral details. We pass them by swiftly.

To learn how Li Xuan restored his soul, we await the next chapter’s unfolding.
