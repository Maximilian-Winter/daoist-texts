# Chapter Twenty-Six: Borrowing a Body to Attach the Soul, Transforming into Iron Crutch; Forsaking the Master, Mourning the Mother, an Immortal Disciple Collapses

Now it happened that Li Xuan returned to Mount Tai, only to find the cavern gate wide open, no figures in sight, and even his own stubborn body nowhere to be found. Counting on his fingers, he knew the truth with certainty. It turned out that Li Xuan already understood that his physical shell must have been prematurely cremated by Yang Ren. His heart held no doubt, and knowing that his mind and spirit had wandered halfway along the path, he recalled the old Lord’s verse. Suddenly, his mind cleared, his expression calmed, and his calculations of the matter proved quite accurate. Yet he had not yet grasped the line about the new visage—could it be that he still had hope to reclaim his body? He stood there for a while, still puzzled.

At first, he resented that Yang Ren, though anxious to see his mother, should have violated the master’s instructions, causing a master’s soul to wander adrift, without refuge or support. Later, he reckoned that Yang Ren’s mother had already died; though Yang Ren hurried back, he could not utter a single word or receive any dying instructions. Immortals’ hearts differ from ordinary men’s, after all. As Li Xuan pondered this, he forgot his own pain and danger, suddenly feeling infinite sympathy for Yang Ren’s grievances. Then he turned his thoughts again: “This is all my fault. Had I not played this spirit-wandering game, he would not need to guard my body, saving much trouble and effort. The mother and son might have had their chance to speak. Now, all this comes from my little whim—how great a sin is that?”

Recalling the Daoist scriptures he had studied, he remembered there was a method to revive the dead: “If I could enter at once, as long as her corpse has not decayed, I could restore her life for ten or eight years, thus fulfilling my fault and guilt—would that not be wondrous? What I regret is that my own功 (merit) has not reached the stage of corpse liberation, nor can my flesh ascend to immortality. Without a stubborn shell to anchor the soul, over time the soul will gradually dissipate. When that time comes, life cannot be preserved—how then can I cultivate the dao?” Thinking thus, he hesitated.

After a moment, he resolutely said, “This is my destined fortune and fate; life and death are Heaven’s decree. Why worry so far ahead? That is not the way of an immortal cultivator. What matters now is to rescue Yang’s mother without delay. If she can be saved but I do not act, would that not add a heavy sin to me?” Having made up his mind, he rose abruptly, stepped outside the cavern, mounted a cloud, and prepared to journey southward.

Suddenly, from the northeast corner, a stream of auspicious clouds shot like a swift arrow and caught Li Xuan’s cloud. Li Xuan opened his eyes and saw, to his great joy, Master Wenshi. “Senior Brother Wenshi, whence do you come? Do you know of my affairs?” he asked.

Wenshi Zhenren smiled, “Were it not for your karmic debts from past lives, I would have no time to look after you.”

Li Xuan was greatly startled. “Pray, Senior Brother, in my former life I only held one grievance about the Golden Mountain matter. Now, having followed the Master’s decree to deliver Miss He to Mount Heng, how can there still be karmic debts?”

Wenshi sighed and said, “In this world, only those who cultivate the dao achieve the greatest success, their character the highest, living as long as Heaven and Earth, enduring with sun and moon, enjoying endless bliss. Yet precisely because of this, their responsibility is heavier, their dealings more difficult than any other. You say you have delivered Miss He, believing your karmic debts are finished, but you do not know that this only settles one responsibility of conscience. There remains a karmic debt born unwittingly—how could you forget it?”

Li Xuan listened, still confused. Wenshi sighed again: “Do not blame yourself for not recalling it, for it arose from unawareness. You have two matters from your previous life that turned good intentions into evil, unnoticed even by yourself, or if noticed, thought irrelevant. First, you vowed from childhood never to approach women, and for over a hundred years never touched a hair of any woman—yet after a century, you inexplicably became close to a woman already dead. Second, you failed to save that woman; instead, you broke her leg bones. Fortunately, her foundation was deep, and the Dragon King granted her a pill, so she was not maimed this life. Had it been an ordinary person, with some illness causing death in a former life, the next reincarnation would carry the same affliction. Though she died with a broken leg, it would be as if she died from it. If so, would that not be your fault? Brother, do not say immortals act with mercy everywhere; a slight unintentional fault may not always bring Heaven’s punishment. Yet the more one is immortal, the less one can owe debts. Your present misfortune arises precisely from repaying debts. The Patriarch long ago calculated this calamity for you. Though called a calamity, it is truly a debt repaid. Without repaying this debt, your attainment of the dao is hopeless. Therefore, this calamity is not misfortune but a matter for joy and congratulations.”

Li Xuan heard this and felt as if intoxicated and entranced, trembling with awe. Wenshi smiled to comfort him. Li Xuan then asked, “Since matters stand thus, surely you have a method to save me?”

Wenshi laughed heartily, “How could there be no method? If your compassionate fault led to no return to life, would Heaven be so cruel? But you, once a handsome youth, must now inevitably become a wretched, filthy figure, with one leg crippled. This is one way you repay your debt. Look at what I hold in my hand—is it not a crutch given to you? This is prepared for your lame leg to aid your strength. Brother, do not think this gift worthless; it has quite a history.”

Li Xuan listened, somewhat dazed, and took the staff without a word. Wenshi laughed again: “This staff was made at the very first Peach Banquet in the Queen Mother’s orchard. A peach-picker carelessly broke off a branch. The Queen Mother gave this broken branch to the Patriarch. Though a withered stick, it can discern clear skies and rain, know cold and heat, and serve as a weapon. Ordinary demons and ghosts cannot withstand this crutch. When I first joined the school, unaware of its use, I asked the Patriarch, who explained its origin and gave it to your humble brother. Now it just so happens to be your personal treasure. Things have their affinities; this gift to you is most fitting.”

Li Xuan then understood and hurriedly bowed in thanks.

Wenshi smiled, helped Li Xuan up, and said, “Brother, no need for ceremony. Come with me to find your transformed body.” Li Xuan followed, staff in hand, descending from the cloud to stand on a patch of wild grass. Wenshi pointed to a dark object beneath a tree: “Brother, that is your substitute body.”

The two immortals walked hand in hand forward. Li Xuan, anxious, reached the tree first and looked closely. It was a dead beggar, black and ugly, one leg longer than the other. Li Xuan was startled, bent down to press on the body, but it was as cold as ice, clearly dead for a long time. Seeing his substitute so filthy and ugly, his heart was displeased. Wenshi soon arrived, saw him dazed and silent, and unexpectedly laughed heartily: “As an immortal, do you still fuss over good looks?”

Li Xuan pondered, “Senior Brother, it is not as you say. Immortals take the dao and magic as their essence, traveling beyond Heaven and Earth, naturally caring little for beauty or refinement. But this dead beggar’s appearance is so frightfully ugly. When my功 (merit) is complete, I will surely meet with the celestial immortals and true gods of the Three Realms, all shining and splendid. Yet here I am, in such a wretched state. Not only would others disdain my filthiness, but I myself would feel ashamed! Good Senior Brother, might you find a way to discard this dead beggar and let me find a somewhat more handsome corpse as a substitute? Would that be possible?”

Wenshi laughed: “Brother, I would not say you lack understanding, but I fear that even as a cultivated immortal, your words sound unprofessional. Do you not know that immortals value the word ‘affinity’ above all? Where affinity is bound, no one can separate it. Just as today you and I speak together, it is because of affinity that we unknowingly came together. Otherwise, you could not have summoned me.”

Before Wenshi finished, Li Xuan forced a bitter smile: “Senior Brother’s profound words, how could I not understand? But what affinity could there be between this beggar and me?”

Wenshi nodded: “That is certainly no accident. In your former life, this beggar once saved your life. You should have repaid his great kindness before leaving the world to cultivate the dao. Because your root nature differs from ordinary people, your exile term is fulfilled, and soon you will ascend to the heavenly register, no longer returning to the mortal world to repay debts. Therefore, after his death, you were made to attach your soul to his body. Though his soul fades, his body does not die, thus repaying the kindness of saving your life. This is truly killing two birds with one stone. Moreover, Heaven’s decree destined it so. How can you despise his filth and seek another? There is yet another point: what is precious about immortals is that if they can shed the mortal form and transform at will, not only can the ugly become handsome, the bad become good, but also change from male to female, old to young—nothing is impossible. Since you have not yet reached corpse liberation, you must temporarily borrow this beggar’s corpse to travel the mortal world. When功 (merit) is complete and the time comes, you will have a form a hundred times more handsome. Will you still need him then?”

Li Xuan heard this and understood thoroughly, nodding repeatedly. He asked, “After corpse liberation, I suppose I can discard this ugly form?”

Wenshi said, “Not so. Since you borrow his corpse to be human, before and after attaining the dao, you must use his form as your main body. Only you can change it anytime, anywhere.”

Having heard this, Li Xuan bowed deeply to Wenshi and thanked him. Saying “I go now,” his soul entered the corpse. The body suddenly rose, grasping the crutch Wenshi had given—just the right length. Li Xuan steadied himself on the crutch and bowed again to Wenshi. Wenshi hurriedly pulled him along, saying, “Walk a few steps and see.”

Li Xuan obeyed, limping along a few paces. Wenshi saw this pitiful gait and could not help laughing. Li Xuan came to a riverbank, looked at his reflection in the water, and felt somewhat unhappy. Wenshi comforted him: “True immortals never reveal their true form. The Patriarch often descends in a hideous guise to test mortals’ sincerity and respect. Now you are but a phantom shape—what harm is there? You must hurry to save Yang’s mother. But her lifespan is short; even if you restore her life by your magic, it will only extend her years by one decade. You must instruct Yang Ren to do many good deeds to compensate; otherwise, not only will Yang Ren’s future be harmed, but you too will suffer some heavenly punishment!”

Li Xuan accepted the teaching, parted from Wenshi, mounted a cloud, and looked over himself again. He saw he was black as forged iron, not a spot of white flesh anywhere. Li Xuan laughed to himself: “This dead beggar must have come from a black-skinned land. Now that I am a black man, I might as well take a new name, even adopting his surname—Iron Crutch Li.” He looked at the peachwood staff Wenshi had given him, its color fresh yellow like a new stick, and laughed: “My body is so pitch black, how could this crutch look good in such brightness?” Then he blew on the staff, and it turned jet black, matching his skin. He nodded and smiled: “Now the name Iron Crutch truly fits.”

Swiftly he descended to the region of Tai’an and went straight to Yang Ren’s home. Unknown to him, Yang Ren and Zhou Xiaoguan were locked in a fierce struggle, unwilling to part. Yang’s mother’s corpse lay on the coffin board; the house was cold and silent. Except for the two of them, only some villagers brought by Xiaoguan were present. The Iron Crutch Master did not know why they fought and watched for a while. He learned they were not quarreling out of anger but because Yang Ren could not send off his mother’s final rites, had not heard a single dying word, and had broken faith with his master Li Xuan by prematurely cremating his法身 (dharma body). This was disloyal to the master and unfilial to his mother. He felt unworthy to stand under Heaven and Earth. Waiting for the coffin to be bought and all matters settled, he intended to draw his sword and slit his throat before the coffin, to repay his master in Heaven and his deceased mother in the underworld. Xiaoguan naturally could not allow him to die. Seeing him draw his sword, Xiaoguan rushed forward, risking life and limb, grasping his shoulders to prevent the sword from falling. Yang Ren wailed loudly, repeatedly blaming himself for disloyalty and unfilialness, ashamed to live. Xiaoguan struggled to hold him back but could not stop him.

The Iron Crutch Master saw this and nodded repeatedly, comforting himself: “Though his intent to die is foolish, it reveals his heart and aspirations. The more he claims disloyalty and unfilialness, the more it shows his exceeding loyalty and filial piety. Truly worthy to be my disciple, Iron Crutch Master. It was no vain effort to save him.” Limping and leaning, he stepped inside and raised a hand to ask, “Why do you two quarrel thus?”

Xiaoguan told the whole story. Yang Ren still wished to die, but the Iron Crutch Master laughed: “Yang Jun, this is your great fault. Have you not heard that life and death are decreed and cannot be forced? A son serves his parents, fulfilling filial duty in life and rites in death—that is great filial piety. What more filial duty is there? As for your master’s matter, though blame cannot be pursued, it arose from a dilemma. Your master would never fault your breach of faith; this is reasonable in the way of loyalty. Being both loyal and filial suffices for a man. If you insist on suicide to atone, you may fail to atone and cause your master grief in Heaven and your mother pain in the underworld. That would be a grave crime. How do you explain yourself, Yang Jun?”

Xiaoguan, hearing such great principles from a black, lame beggar, was both amazed and delighted, agreeing repeatedly. Yang Ren, silenced and bowed, sighed quietly, losing heart to inquire about the visitor’s origin.

After a pause, he suddenly knelt beside the coffin and burst into loud sobs. Xiaoguan no longer urged him, but hurriedly beckoned to Li Xuan, asking his honored name. Li Xuan smiled faintly and spoke, finally bringing joy to Yang Ren’s face and banishing his sorrow.

How Li Xuan spoke remains to be told; see the next chapter for the unfolding.
