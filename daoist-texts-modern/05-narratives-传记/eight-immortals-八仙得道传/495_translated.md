# Chapter Twenty-Seven: The Immortal Method Applied—Madam Yang’s Resurrection and the Summons to Immortal Li to Venture to the Sea

Yet it was said that when Master Iron Crutch saw the young official stir and inquire his name, he no longer concealed himself. Straightaway he approached Madam Yang’s coffin and cried out, “Yang Ren, child of mine, why do you not recognize your master?” Yang Ren, who had been weeping until his senses blurred, at these words was so startled that tears and snot alike rolled down his throat. He opened his eyes and looked Li Xuan up and down. Even Zhou the young official was greatly astonished and stepped forward a few paces to ask, “What is this? Brother, are you truly the master of my friend Yang? My friend from childhood entered the monastic path under a certain Master Li, with the single name Xuan, and never had another teacher. Pray, tell me how you claim to be his master?”

Yang Ren paused his grief, tears still flowing, and nodded toward Li Xuan, saying, “Indeed, little brother has but one Master Li in life. I truly do not know what master-disciple bond there could be between you and me. There must be some reason—may I humbly ask you to explain?”

Master Iron Crutch, hearing this, could not help but laugh and sigh. Then he barked, “I am your master Li Xuan. You say you do not know me—no wonder. Who told you to burn my body first, leaving my wandering soul bereft, lost at the crossroads? Were it not for my own dao skill, I could not even have borrowed this strange, ugly form.” 

Yang Ren, hearing these words in the very voice of Li Xuan, and with such precise details, finally believed that his master had truly come. He hastily knelt down with a clatter, bowing his head as if pounding mortar, calling himself accursed and begging his master to punish him. Zhou the young official also quickly knelt alongside.

Master Iron Crutch hurriedly stretched out both hands to raise them up, saying, “I have already said, your fault arose from filial piety and can be forgiven. Besides, there is some destined measure in this. Even if you had not burned my body first, this stubborn shell of mine could not have been preserved. Let me slowly explain this principle to you. As for you delaying your mother’s proper funeral to guard my body, that is my fault upon you.”

Yang Ren’s heart was filled with unease. Master Iron Crutch continued, “Your mother’s lifespan was originally only this much. When you followed me into the monastic path, did I not give you some words of guidance? You may vaguely recall them. Now I pity your pure filial heart, and since my affairs have prevented your mother’s proper send-off, I feel deeply sorry. I can now use some immortal methods to bring your mother back from death, to live another twelve years before returning to Heaven. But in these twelve years, you must do many good deeds and widely establish merit for the shades, so that your own fortune and life will not be cut short, and I will not violate the course of Heaven’s workings. What do you say?”

Hearing that his mother could be revived, Yang Ren’s joy was beyond measure. He hurriedly prostrated himself on the ground, kowtowing countless times, nearly bruising his forehead, crying out, “Master, with such grace, your disciple will gladly break bones and shatter flesh to do good deeds and repay the profound favor of Heaven and Earth!”

Master Iron Crutch required no medicine, no incantation. He stepped forward, blew upon the corpse, and shouted, “Rise now!” Strange as it was, the corpse suddenly sat up, crying out, “I’m suffocating to death!” Yang Ren joyfully stepped forward to embrace her, and the tears and snot he had swallowed now all burst into laughter. Madam Yang opened her eyes and saw her son and a black beggar standing beside her. Overcome with surprise and joy, tears streaming down her face, she said, “My son, why have you come only now? I thought I had already reached the Underworld, when suddenly a clear breeze blew me back. Could it be you who saved me?”

Yang Ren hurriedly said, “Mother, my master is here. It was he who used immortal methods to save you from death.” Hearing this, Madam Yang wished to step down from the coffin to bow. Yang Ren quickly said, “Mother, you have just been revived; do not tire yourself. Let your son pay respects on your behalf.” But now Madam Yang’s spirit was tenfold stronger, more vigorous than before her illness. She needed no support, stepping down from the coffin herself. Mother and son together bowed deeply to Master Iron Crutch.

The master laughed heartily, saying, “Wise mother and son, no need for such ceremony. As monastics, saving people and aiding the world is our duty; we should not accept so many thanks.” Then he ordered Yang Ren, “Quickly help your honored mother inside to rest and recuperate. I have done this defiance of Heaven’s order only by your own abundant good deeds. For these twelve years, you need not return to the mountain. Use your skill to travel outside often. After twelve years, I will come again to guide you.”

With that, he transformed into a clear breeze and ascended halfway to the heavens. Below, Madam Yang, Yang Ren, and Zhou the young official had their own round of farewells, which need not be detailed here.

Master Iron Crutch returned to the Eight Scenes Palace. The assembled immortals, seeing his strange, grotesque transformation, could not help but laugh. They teased him for a while, making Master Iron Crutch even more embarrassed. Soon, the Venerable Lord Lao ascended his seat. Master Iron Crutch kowtowed before him. Lao smiled and said, “Such an appearance suits you well. Mortals are filthy in heart; you alone are ugly in form. When you travel the Four Great Continents, the Three Realms, and the Five Hells, ordinary people will hardly recognize you as a Great Luo Golden Immortal in this grotesque guise. You can thus test the sincerity and truth of those seeking the dao. Is that not wondrous?”

Master Iron Crutch laughed joyfully and reported, “I had thought so myself. Moreover, Brother Wenshi gave me a staff, which I transformed to iron color and named Iron Crutch Li. I wonder if that is acceptable?”

Lao nodded, “Very good, very good. You can also hang a gourd on the crutch’s head.” Turning, he ordered a boy, “Go to the back and pick a gourd.” The boy obeyed and soon returned with a large gourd. Lao took it in his hands and bestowed it upon Master Iron Crutch.

Master Iron Crutch respectfully held it and asked, “Master, what wondrous power does this gourd hold?”

Lao said, “This gourd was plucked from the forest and is not rare in itself. But after my refining, its nature has changed. Ordinary gourds hold seeds and pulp; this one is filled with the highest treasures of the immortals. When you exorcise demons and banish monsters, it can produce blazing fire or great waters. When the fire blazes, it can rival a Mountain of Flames; when the water swells, it can match the entire Eastern Ocean. Except for the celestial immortals of the upper realms, who can withstand it? When you use it to save the suffering and aid the needy, open the lid and there will be medicines, money, and at times, even a temporary inn to shelter many guests.”

At this, the immortals could not help but chuckle. Lao said, “Do you think this gourd can hold only one person? Truly, this is like a frog in a well gazing at the sky.” Then he ordered Li Xuan to place the gourd down, mouth facing outward, and instructed him to close his eyes and stride boldly toward the mouth. After three steps, he was to open his eyes.

Master Iron Crutch obediently closed both eyes tightly, took three bold steps, then opened them to find his body already inside the gourd. Outside, many fellow cultivators and masters had vanished. Taking more steps, the inside grew ever brighter. Looking closely, it was a large round house. Inside were cabinets, beds, furnishings, and all manner of utensils complete.

Going deeper, another larger round chamber appeared, containing almost everything a person might need in life—clothing, food, entertainment, and more. Master Iron Crutch thought that such a vast multi-layered house must have servants for cleaning, cooking, and tending the hearth. No sooner had he thought this than many attendants dressed in blue appeared, standing respectfully. Two exquisite maidservants approached, one bearing tea, the other a towel, smiling and saying, “Master, your tea.” Master Iron Crutch laughed heartily to himself, thinking, “My master is quite the trickster. But as a cultivator, I need no such luxury. A humble window and rope bed, a simple door, suffice for comfort. Now that I am a black beggar, I need no fine clothes, and eating is even more optional. Yet I would not wish to waste my master’s deep kindness.”

Just then, the grand mansion, the precious furnishings, and all the servants vanished. The two round chambers peeled away, becoming dilapidated and shabby. The utensils in the room were exceedingly simple and crude, the exact opposite of the previous splendor. Master Iron Crutch nodded and sighed inwardly, “A monastic must be thus; only then can the heart be at ease. Truly, my master is an immortal ancestor who understands my inclinations.” He thought further, “My junior brothers seemed doubtful upon hearing the master’s decree. I should invite them in to enjoy this marvel, so all may increase their insight, and together with the immortals, hold a gourd banquet. Would that not be wonderful?”

While pondering, he continued walking deeper. Another layer revealed a house larger than the previous two. At last, a great round wall blocked the way—likely the gourd’s boundary separating inside from outside. Because his heart was detached, the room’s furnishings were very simple and plain. After a time, Master Iron Crutch retraced his steps to the middle chamber.

Unbeknownst to him, the courtyard was already crowded with many senior brothers. Upon seeing Iron Crutch, they all rose to congratulate him. The immortals said among themselves, “We saw you enter the gourd mouth and vanish. We were discussing this when the master suddenly said, ‘Your junior brother Iron Crutch is inside thinking of you all. You may enter and see what fine things he has to entertain you.’ So we came in one after another, searching for you, and then you emerged from the back. No wonder the master said we were frogs in a well; this little gourd truly holds thousands!”

Master Iron Crutch greeted the immortals and rejoiced as the room restored its former rich and exquisite appearance. He busied himself entertaining the immortals, who were served tea and snacks by the blue-clad attendants in endless streams, with great attentiveness. Remarkably, no instruction was needed; a mere thought and all was perfectly arranged. What worldly servant could be so clever?

The immortals admired and congratulated Iron Crutch on this supreme treasure. At this moment, Master Wenshi was also present and laughed, “Though we have followed the master for so long, we never knew he could craft such a thing. Junior brother has not been here long, yet strange events unfold—clearly the master favors him. Without past affinity, how could this be?”

Master Iron Crutch smiled and replied, “Though it is my master’s great favor, it is thanks also to Brother Wenshi’s guidance and all the senior brothers’ support. I, Li Xuan, only offer a single petal of incense, humbly wishing all brothers long life and happiness.”

The immortals laughed, “This is truly a destined affinity. What merit have we? Yet on our first visit to your gourd immortal abode, we brought no gifts. We feel quite remiss.”

Master Iron Crutch laughed and said, “Far from it. When I find a place to cultivate, if I need anything, I will surely ask you all. For now, I entrust it to you.”

They all laughed together.

Master Wenshi wished to tour the entire gourd immortal abode. Master Iron Crutch led them to the back, but there was no door to pass through. They circled back to the small front mouth and emerged together. Looking back, the gourd was still but a few inches long and wide—a mere trifle.

The immortals followed Master Iron Crutch, delighted and praising without end. Lao smiled, “This is but a plaything, not the great dao. You are too amazed—consider it a minor glimpse.”

The immortals fell silent.

Lao commanded Master Iron Crutch to tie the gourd to the staff’s end. Master Wenshi hurriedly said, “Allow me to add a strand.” Lao smiled and nodded. Wenshi removed his immortal crown, plucked a hair about an inch long, stretched it to a yard, then released it to shrink back. He tied the gourd to the staff’s tip, which gleamed and shimmered like gold, soft as cotton, fine as silk, tough as ox sinew, unbreakable by pulling.

Master Iron Crutch quickly bowed in thanks.

Lao instructed, “Last time I told you to go down to the sea. When the critical moment comes, even I and your various brothers must go. Though this matter is not great, a demon cult leader seeks to use it to trouble our sect, so caution is required. The origin of this matter lies with Master Yuanshi’s disciple, Master Wenmei. When you return, wait in the cave where your disciple dwells on Mount Tai. Within one or two days, someone will come to invite you. That person is Wenmei’s disciple. He will tell you the inner details.”

Master Iron Crutch answered one by one.

Lao continued, “Actually, this matter is the recent responsibility of the newly enlightened He Lan Immortal. The matter’s principal and she have some past affinity, so by custom she should preside. But since she is still diligently cultivating, she cannot be distracted by such trifles. So this matter falls to you. Consider it a merit you make on her behalf.”

Master Iron Crutch hastened, “Miss He’s matter I should handle. Any small merit belongs to her. I dare not arrogantly claim another’s功.”

Lao smiled and nodded, “Monastics seek only to benefit others. The current principal will soon attain the dao and eventually be your colleague and fellow disciple, mutually assisting. This is natural and need not be divided strictly.”

Iron Crutch kowtowed and accepted the command.

Returning to the Jade Cliff Cave on Mount Tai, he summoned Fei Fei and Dian Dian by law edict to await orders. Before dusk, the two arrived to pay respects. Master Iron Crutch told them all that had happened since parting. Both rejoiced and praised. He also told them of Yu’er’s escape down the mountain. Both were furious and said, “Master, please point out where she is. We will go capture her and punish her.”

Master Iron Crutch smiled and said, “This one is wild and unruly, impossible to enlighten. That was my overzealous mistake. Now that she has fled, I expect she will not harm the people for the time being. When she commits a crime, it will not be too late to deal with her.”

They agreed.

Master Iron Crutch said, “Tomorrow someone will come to invite me down the mountain to handle a great matter at sea. You two should guard the cave entrance and welcome the visitor.”

The two obeyed, standing far outside the cave door to watch.

Just past noon, suddenly a great sound like a large bird flying through the sky was heard. The two were startled. Looking up, they saw a female Taoist nun descending from the air, standing before them. They knew she must be the one sent to fetch their master. They quickly raised hands in salute and asked, “Immortal maiden, are you from the sea? Please grant your dharma name so we may report properly.”

The nun smiled, “Respected master is truly a genuine immortal of the dao. I knew you would invite me. I am called Hui Tong, disciple of Master Wenmei, your master’s senior brother. We are fellow disciples with you two. Since you and Master Wenmei both emerged from the gates of Venerable Lord Lao and Master Yuanshi, we are classmates—all one family.”

Fei Fei smiled and greeted her warmly. Dian Dian hurried inside to report.

Master Iron Crutch, newly enlightened and relying on the kindness of fellow disciples, was humble and never overproud. He personally went out with Fei Fei to receive her.

Hui Tong, seeing Iron Crutch, knew him as the lame immortal spoken of by her master. She hurried forward and prostrated herself, saying, “Junior disciple Hui Tong pays respects to Master Uncle.”

Master Iron Crutch returned a half bow, smiling, and invited her inside to sit.

Hui Tong first reported that Lady Luo Yuan had succeeded in cultivation and, by the master’s order, was establishing a daoist altar. She specially invited Master Uncle to preside over the rites. Master Iron Crutch naturally agreed and asked Hui Tong to briefly recount Luo Yuan’s prior affairs.

Hui Tong explained everything, and Master Iron Crutch then understood the cause and effect. He also learned that the master had said the future colleague and fellow disciple would be Zhang Guo, and he immediately felt a warm kinship.

Hui Tong added, “Lady Luo Yuan has been renamed Jue Xian by the master’s order and is now awaiting the dharma carriage. She will invite daoist friends from various mountains, great immortals from all realms, and the Dragon King and his consort of the sea to join the grand assembly. She also earnestly requests Master Uncle to set out soon.”

Master Iron Crutch said, “Monastics have no other task than to save and aid people. Since I have been honored with the summons, I shall accompany my senior sister at once.”

Hui Tong was overjoyed. She and Iron Crutch rose, taking Fei Fei and Dian Dian with them, ascending into the clouds. Huaihai Village lay south of Mount Tai, and the four headed southward.

Midway, a sudden black wind blew from behind. Iron Crutch and Hui Tong sensed something amiss and looked back to see several Taoists laughing as they approached through dark clouds.

Hui Tong whispered to Iron Crutch, “Master Uncle, these must be demons. I heard from Master Chang that with Jue Xian’s enlightenment and altar establishment, enemies will come to sabotage. We must be cautious. These four wear demonic airs and travel our way; surely they head for Huaihai Village. Let us proceed slowly and wait for them to arrive, then inquire and decide how to deal with them. What do you think?”

Master Iron Crutch nodded, “That is just right.” They slowed their cloud steps, waiting for the four to catch up.

Whether the four were demon or not remains to be told in the next chapter.
