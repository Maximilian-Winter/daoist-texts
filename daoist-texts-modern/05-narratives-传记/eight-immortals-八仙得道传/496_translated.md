# Chapter Twenty-Eight: The Snail Immortal Receives the Mandate to Establish the Daoist Altar; The Clam Spirit Opens Its Shell to Feast the Multitude of Demons

Now it happened that Master Iron Crutch, together with Hui Tong, Dian, and Fei—four companions in all—waited until four more figures arrived from behind. They halted their cloud steps, and behold, these four wore garments of varied colors and lengths, their visages fierce and their bodies immense; at a glance, it was clear they were no true Daoist immortals. Master Iron Crutch raised his hand in salute to them. The four returned the gesture with faint smiles and inquired the Daoist name of Master Iron Crutch’s immortal homeland.

Master Iron Crutch spoke his name, then in turn asked theirs. The one in the midst, clad in a red Dao robe and bearing the air of a leader, replied, “We poor Daoists are all overseas qi-refiners. Since the days of Yao and Shun, we have attained the dao, yet out of fondness for leisure, have not ascended to the celestial courts. I am ‘Lingxuzi.’” He pointed to the green-robed figure on the right, “That is ‘Tongxuanzi,’” and then to those in purple and blue robes behind, “They are ‘Mingmingzi’ and ‘Kongkongzi.’” He continued, “We have heard that under the tutelage of the Venerable Wenmei of Huaihai Village, a Snail Spirit has cultivated a dharma body and intends to open a daoist altar within his snail shell. This is a grand gathering of the sea, rare in all the ages, so we have specially arranged to accompany each other and witness it.” Hearing this, Hui Tong silently signaled Master Iron Crutch with her eyes. Iron Crutch feigned ignorance and introduced the matter to Hui Tong and the others, but did not mention Hui Tong’s discipleship under Wenmei. Instead, he said they had also heard the fame of the daoist altar within the snail shell and came to participate. The eight then gathered together, parted the cloud path, and hastened onward. In no time at all, they arrived at the banks of the Huai River.

Master Iron Crutch, uncertain of the four’s magical prowess, invited them to proceed first. Lingxuzi, seeing Iron Crutch’s repulsive appearance, had intended to look down on him, but instead nodded arrogantly and said to the other three, “We shall go ahead first.” With that, he formed the Water-Repelling Hand Seal and cleaved a broad road through the vast waves.

The four made no reply to Iron Crutch and his party, striding forward without looking back. Hui Tong and Fei Fei were enraged, saying, “These Daoists are rude indeed. We have been so humble, yet they dare to look down on us with such arrogance. Moreover, since they are heretical cultists, surely no good will come of this. Rather than wait to be harmed by them later, would it not be simpler to catch them unawares and use our Master’s flying sword to slay them outright?”

Master Iron Crutch laughed heartily and said, “My worthy brothers, though you have studied the dao for many years, you remain so impatient. This is no different from their arrogance and rudeness. I am here by the mandate of our Patriarch to preside over the daoist altar; the responsibility is great. We must devise means to guard against these heretics and demons. Even in the direst emergency, our Patriarch and many elder brothers will come to aid us. Why stoop to such base preemptive strikes? Even if victorious, it would bring no honor; if defeated, how could we face the Patriarch and our friends beyond the world? Even if the battle is evenly matched, it wastes time and invites the Patriarch’s rebuke. The ancients said: ‘Failing to endure small matters leads to great harm.’ Remember well my words today: whenever you face adversity, never act rashly. Carefully assess the situation—if you can fight, then fight; if not, withdraw three leagues. Better to endure temporary hardship and act with wise prudence, seeking only to preserve life. Who can say that after a hundred years, the shame cannot be washed away? If you throw away your life in a moment of anger, you become but a reckless warrior, not a true cultivator of the dao.” Hui Tong was greatly moved and thanked him repeatedly. Dian and Fei, however, still felt their Master was too lenient, and their anger lingered. Hui Tong smiled and comforted them on Iron Crutch’s behalf.

Master Iron Crutch chuckled, “Those two have strong natures and a sense of justice; truly, Heaven has granted them chivalrous hearts. This is why I favor them—they are the easiest to bring close to the dao. But those who are too rigid will surely break. If they do not apply effort in such matters, all the years spent nurturing qi will be in vain. Sister, do not try to persuade them; their cultivation is not yet ripe, and words will be useless. In a few years, they will surely temper their fiery spirits. Then, without my saying a word, they will understand the joy found in patience.” Fei Fei and Dian both calmed and laughed, “Our Master is always so forbearing, yet we often feel a bit rebellious on his behalf. Now that he has spoken clearly, we must return and work harder, perhaps then we can calm our tempers and avoid many troubles.” Master Iron Crutch was greatly pleased, “If you can say this and hold such intentions, it shows your learning is no longer as before. What I just said now seems but shallow talk.” The three all laughed heartily.

Master Iron Crutch uttered no incantations nor formed hand seals; he simply pointed his iron staff, and immediately a crystal-clear, smooth, and level road appeared before their eyes, stretching from the riverbank straight to the main gate of the Juexian Cavern Abode in Huaihai Village. Iron Crutch led the way, the three following behind. Most marvelous was that the road seemed endless; though they traveled the time it takes to finish a meal, they had already reached the cavern entrance. Looking back, the road had vanished without a trace. Hui Tong was deeply impressed; Dian and Fei danced with delight. Iron Crutch then said to Hui Tong, “Sister, do you know how arrogant those four Daoist friends are? They are probably still halfway here and will take some time yet to arrive.” Hui Tong nodded, “Naturally. The Water-Dividing Hand Seal travels the waterways, which is not an evil art, but how can it compare to your great dao?” Iron Crutch smiled, “There is a water-escape method even swifter than this, but Dian and Fei cannot follow along.” Hui Tong agreed and, being familiar with the way, took the lead. She guided the three disciples inside to the second level, where Zhang Guo, his son, and Juexian himself all came out to greet them. Upon seeing Iron Crutch, all bowed respectfully. Iron Crutch bowed in return.

Then Hui Tong arranged for everyone to meet Fei Fei and Dian Dian, and all courteously took their seats. Juexian deeply thanked Master Iron Crutch for his arduous journey. The Master smiled, “We are all destined by fate, and moreover fellow disciples on the same path. Such small matters are not worth mentioning.” Zhang Guo, seeing Iron Crutch’s immortal bearing and spirit—though his skin was dark and rough, a pure qi shone forth more brightly—felt great admiration. Sitting beside Iron Crutch, he asked about the great dao of cultivation and heart-nurturing. Iron Crutch knew this man was the one the Patriarch had foretold would work with him in the future and held him in special respect. He shared all he knew and heard, imparting everything that might enrich Zhang Guo’s knowledge. Zhang Guo, seeing Iron Crutch and his own master Wenmei as peers, addressed him as “Master Uncle,” and the two felt a special warmth. After some conversation, the host Juexian ordered the serving of rare fruits and delicacies from the mountains and seas, along with self-brewed honeyed wine, to honor Iron Crutch, seating him in the place of highest respect. Iron Crutch politely accepted without declining further. Hui Tong, Zhang Guo, and others took their places accordingly, with Fei and Dian seated at Iron Crutch’s left and right shoulders.

During the feast, Fei Fei spoke of the four figures seen on the cloud road, insisting they were not upright and would surely cause trouble sooner or later, so they must be guarded against. Juexian replied, “I have heard that the old flood dragon cast himself into the South Sea and recently joined the Jie Sect. He has taken many disciples. Knowing that Zhang Guo and I are here, he has resolved to come stir up trouble. But I have many powerful friends here as well—the Dragon King and Queen of the Crystal Palace, and their sons Ao Guang and Ao Shun—all possess the valor of ten thousand men and astonishing skills. If they know of the evil flood dragon’s mischief, they will surely raise troops to assist. With so many gods and immortals, could a mere band of beastly demons prevail?” Saying this, he laughed heartily. Iron Crutch replied solemnly, “Brother Daoist, you should not be so confident. Throughout the four seas and five lakes, where is there not a capable person? We have only recently begun our cultivation and have limited skills. How dare we belittle the worth of all under Heaven? Even our Patriarch, lord of the Dao and leader of the gods of the upper, middle, and lower realms, does not speak boastfully. How much less should we, with our scant accomplishments, utter arrogant words? As fellow travelers on the path, I humbly offer these words and hope you will accept them.”

Hui Tong and Zhang Guo quickly said, “Master Uncle’s words are as firm as metal and stone. Only those with profound dao and vast learning would neither speak nor dare speak boastfully. We have received a valuable lesson.” Juexian, realizing his mistake, was deeply ashamed and rose to thank them. Master Iron Crutch, seeing their sincere acceptance, was greatly pleased and raised his cup in congratulation, saying, “Our sect’s aim is to benefit the world, not self-interest; to seek truth, not boastful words. Since ancient times, no great immortal has deceived the world with grandiose speech; true immortals never flaunt their magic or disdain fellow practitioners. My own learning is shallow and my merits few; what I have spoken is only mutual encouragement and admonition. I am humbled by your praise.” All replied, “Master Uncle is too modest; with juniors like us, such humility is unnecessary.” Iron Crutch demurred a few more times, then turned to Fei Fei, “You spoke of those four? I have already seen clearly that they are beast demons. I do not know their intentions, their skills, or where they dwell. When you have the chance, go and investigate, then report back to me. If they harbor hostile designs, it is best to prepare early.” Fei and Dian bowed and promised. The feast then dispersed.

Juexian prepared a finely adorned cloud chamber for Iron Crutch and his disciples, located in the innermost chamber. Hui Tong guided them inside. Iron Crutch, seeing the exquisite furnishings, felt uneasy and said, “A recluse, living in mountains, forests, caves, and ancient temples, should find home everywhere. How can one live in such comfort? It is too much trouble for the host.” Hui Tong smiled, “Master Uncle is always so self-restrained. You have attained the dao and are different from us. Nowadays, how many immortals in Heaven do not dwell in splendid abodes? Yet you still live so austerely.” Iron Crutch hurriedly said, “I only know a little of the magic arts; true understanding of the great dao is but a surface glimpse. How can I compare to the Golden Immortals of the upper realms? Please, Daoist friend, do not say such things and increase my shame.” Hui Tong said no more. After some talk, they took their leave. Master Iron Crutch sat alone, cultivating profound power. Fei Fei and the others went out on their mission to investigate the four demon Daoists.

Master Iron Crutch sat until dawn, but they had not returned. Suddenly he felt a slight surge in his heart-blood and sharply realized, “Unthinkable! Fei Fei and the others have been captured by demons.” He said nothing, paced slowly a few steps, settled on a plan, and pointed behind him. There, a great wall of blue-gray stone marked the last layer of the snail shell. At his finger’s touch, a large gate appeared. Iron Crutch took his staff and gourd and stepped through. With a clang, the double doors shut behind him without a trace. He followed the water’s flow downstream of Huaihai Village and came upon a vast, round-backed house. Its two great doors were a pair of clam shells, half open, half closed. This was the abode of a great clam spirit of the Jie Sect, whose powers rivaled Juexian’s. He had fashioned his tough shell into a palace. Inside was a great courtyard, behind which lay hundreds of aligned buildings.

This time, the demons, having heard of the grand daoist altar within the snail shell, and stirred by the old flood dragon’s words—that many disciples of the Laozi Sect arrogantly claimed human bodies as their cultivation and scorned the Jie Sect—were enraged. What made it worse was that Juexian was clearly a snail spirit, and Zhang Guo a bat, yet they sided with the Laozi Sect and mocked the Jie Sect as mere beasts. This provoked public outrage, and countless demons and monsters gathered at Huaihai, preparing to confront the gathered immortals and settle supremacy. The clam spirit, originally from the sea, volunteered his shell as a dwelling place and proposed setting up an arena within it, awaiting the immortals from Juexian’s side to compete in daoist arts.

On this day, Hui Tong invited Master Iron Crutch and his disciples to the snail shell. Meanwhile, Lingxuzi and the other three demons, at the old flood dragon’s behest, arrived at the clam’s belly. The old flood dragon had come earlier. The clam spirit, as host, held a grand welcome feast, featuring delicacies from the nearby sea. Lingxuzi laughed mid-drink, “The host invites us with creatures from his own home; today’s feast may well be called a sea banquet.” The assembly applauded. Tongxuanzi also laughed, “Master Clam, as host, fulfills his duties fully, using only kin from his own family. Truly, this is the great righteousness of extinguishing kinship. We are deeply grateful, but fear that if trouble arises in the mountains, and we invite the clam lord to visit, there will be no kin to admire. That would be a shame indeed.”

The old flood dragon brought many demons: Houkong the Recluse, Dujiao the Master, Niumo the Honored, and Shishi the Great King—beasts of the mountains such as tigers, leopards, bulls, and eagles. Like Lingxuzi and Tongxuanzi, a bear and a tiger among beasts, their natures were wild and cruel. Now having learned some magic, they committed ever more evil deeds. The lion and bull laughed and said, “Ling and Tong, how modest you are! Our mountains produce the most, rivaling the sea clans. Are we not as respectable as the clam lord?” Tongxuanzi smiled, “It is not as you say. Though many kin dwell in the mountains, have you not heard ‘the death of the rabbit grieves the fox’? Creatures mourn their own kind. Our mountain leaders coming to the sea to accept the clam lord’s feast feel uneasy. How much more so to harm kin to satisfy outsiders? Even the lowest beasts in our mountains know this is utterly forbidden, much less us.” The demons applauded even more, but the clam general bowed his head in silence, a sorrowful expression upon him.

The old flood dragon feared the clam’s resentment would harm his plans and hastily changed the subject. Tongxuanzi, feeling remorse for his rash words, quickly apologized to the clam general, who silently harbored anger.

As they struggled with this awkwardness, a small demon suddenly reported, “Two strangers, a man and a woman, are spying outside the gate. When they saw us, they fled, but soon returned. We fear they are spies and dare not ignore.” Before the words ended, the old flood dragon sprang up, shouting, “Bring my spear!” Lingxuzi and Tongxuanzi, bored and wishing to avoid trouble, quickly restrained the old flood dragon and laughed, “We are but humble travelers with no merits. Such minor demons surely have little skill. Brother, no need for you to act personally. Let us claim the first merit.” The old flood dragon obeyed.

The two demons seized weapons and rushed outside. The assembled demons, anxious, also armed themselves and went to reinforce. Lingxuzi and Tongxuanzi emerged at the gate and saw the two spying figures peering about—none other than Fei Fei and Dian Dian, whom they had met on the cloud road.

The two demons sneered, “So it is you two dog-headed fools come to die. No wonder you looked so desperate in the clouds, eager to find a path to the underworld. Very well, brave ones, come on up! If you do not, we will take you as a gift.” One wielded a spear, the other a sword, and they charged at Fei and Dian. The two, seeing the demons pressing close, were furious and met them with weapons drawn. The battle raged for over a hundred exchanges without a victor.

Meanwhile, the old flood dragon and clam general stood at the front lines. Seeing Ling and Tong unable to overcome Fei and Dian, Tongxuanzi said, “Allow me to offer a treasure.” He took a small bottle from his bosom, pointed its mouth at the enemy, and chanted, “Molei Huluche.” Fei and Dian suddenly shivered; their souls and spirits flew out of their bodies and into Tongxuanzi’s bottle. Their empty bodies were then carried inside by small demons and thrown into a small chamber. All the demons congratulated the three, who laughed, “Today the crippled one was lucky. Had he been here, he too would have been trapped in the soul-capturing bottle.”

The old flood dragon suddenly realized, “That crippled one has some background. His secular name is Li Xuan. He truly has some skill. Laozi is pleased with him and recently accepted him as a disciple. If he comes, we must be cautious.” The two demons, Dujiao and Niumo, angrily said, “Why are you so fearful? You have not even met the great enemy and already show cowardice. Does this not encourage others and diminish your own prestige?” The old flood dragon blushed and said, “I only say this to warn you to be vigilant against ambushes, not out of fear. If I were truly timid, I would have stayed in the South Sea to cultivate quietly instead of traveling thousands of miles to stir up trouble.”

As the demons prepared to argue, Tongxuanzi smiled and said, “Everyone, quiet. This treasure bottle traps souls. Once inside, they grow faint as if dead. After an hour, the soul dissipates and cannot reunite with the body, not even becoming a ghost. Yet today, after capturing two demons and closing the bottle for some time, I hear them still talking inside. Could their souls be different, unusually strong and durable?” The demons marveled. Tongxuanzi pressed the bottle to his ear and listened quietly for a while, then laughed heartily, “Strange, strange! These two demons have some skill indeed. Though they are dying, they are still singing mountain songs inside.” The demons burst into laughter and asked what songs they sang. Tongxuanzi smiled a while longer before revealing the songs.

Whether Fei Fei and the others survive or perish remains to be told in the next chapter.
