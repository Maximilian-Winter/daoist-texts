# Chapter Twenty-Nine: The Soul-Capturing Bottle Fails to Conceal the Immortal Form — The Gourd Cavern’s Habit of Toying with Demons

Now it happened that Fei Fei and Dian Dian were both ensnared by the Soul-Capturing Bottle of Tong Xuanzi, their soul and spirit imprisoned within. Tong Xuanzi himself was none other than the short-lived insect of autumn woods—the cold cicada, commonly known as the “zhi liao.” Ordinarily, the cicada’s life is brief, but this particular cicada, by some mysterious fate, had lived through a full two years. Generally, the nature of beings is never satisfied; the cicada’s usual lifespan is but a few months, and none would dare hope for more. Yet this cicada, endowed with exceptional virtue, had broken through the barrier of short life and survived two full years without death. Thus, it concluded that the cicada was indeed capable of longevity, that having lived two years, it might live twenty, two hundred, even two thousand or twenty thousand years, and thus attain eternal life. Such a thing was not absolutely impossible; the difficulty lay in its limited knowledge and humble status. Unable to seek immortals or follow the dao, with no one to teach or guide it, it thought, “Having lived this year, at most I might live another; could it really be three or five years more?” Since death was inevitable within a year or two, it was not much different from the cicadas that died young. Saddened to the heart, it crouched daily atop a branch, weeping day and night.

Cicadas are ordinarily the cheapest of creatures, nourished by wind and dew. This cicada, feeling the hardship of longevity and the bitterness of short life, gave up even the hope of three or five more years. It wept so bitterly that it could no longer draw in wind or dew; after many days of crying, it seemed near death. Yet such was the fate of its long life: on the day it mourned its impending end, an immortal happened to pass beneath. Hearing its lament, the immortal’s heart was moved with compassion and called it down. The cicada, now at death’s door, could not speak. The immortal, greatly pitying it, immediately spat forth a stream of dharma water into the cicada’s belly. Receiving this immortal water, the cicada instantly felt a surge of spirit and vigor throughout its being. Opening its eyes, it saw an old immortal smiling gently, holding it in the palm of his hand and speaking softly. Its nature was naturally different from others; having lived so long, its worldly knowledge was tenfold that of ordinary autumn cicadas. Knowing the old immortal had saved its life, how could it not feel gratitude? It jumped about in the palm, bowing its head to meet the immortal’s palm several times in succession.

I am no mere creature, and though I cannot say whether these actions were like the kowtows of men, the situation clearly showed that the cicada was expressing thanks to the immortal. The immortal smiled and nodded, saying, “It is rare for a small creature like you to have such knowledge, and I pity your resolve to rise higher, yet no way to seek instruction. So I teach you a method to absorb the sun’s essence and gather the moon’s radiance, along with several transformation arts, all imparted to you. If you truly have will and blessed fate, apply yourself diligently and cultivate earnestly. I guarantee that from twenty years to a hundred, to ten thousand years, you will live as long as Heaven and Earth and the mountains and rivers. But I fear that once you gain a human form, if you make even a little progress and then meddle foolishly, striving for face and losing your cheap nature, your abilities will become the cause of your ruin, the means of your downfall. Even if you live three or five hundred years, you will still return to death, and after death perhaps suffer in the underworld. This is certain. Success or failure depends entirely on your cultivation; I cannot protect you forever.” The cicada nodded its head again, accepting the immortal’s great dharma.

From then on, the cicada truly improved. Just as the immortal said, it practiced diligently and refined itself. After more than one hundred years, it no longer knew of the short-lived cicadas of the world. It could transform into birds and beasts, soar beyond the heavens, and speed through the mountains and forests. After one hundred and fifty years, the immortal returned and said that after another one hundred and fifty years, it could transform into human form, and only then could it truly cultivate the great dao. By this time, the cicada could already speak human language and advanced even faster. Indeed, after three hundred years, it transformed once into a human body.

When the time came for Juexian to hold a daoist assembly, the cicada was led by the old flood dragon into the Jie Sect, joining many demons who came to Huaihai Village. It believed that defeating the snail spirit was a great merit in cultivating immortality and was full of pride. In its first battle, it used the Soul-Capturing Bottle it had forged to capture the souls of Fei Fei and Dian Dian. This bottle was originally made when it was still a cicada, fashioned from a small gourd gathered in the countryside and refined with its own essence. It was only about the size of a middle finger. According to the cicada, it could capture millions of souls, a truly formidable device. The gourd’s material was extremely thin, so it could even hear the voices inside.

At that moment, Tong Xuanzi listened once more and heard Fei Fei and Dian Dian inside saying, “We do not know what strange thing this is that has hidden us away. Nothing else matters, but we fear suffocation.” After a while, the two discussed, “What is there to fear? Our master is clairvoyant; seeing we do not return in time, he must know we have been attacked. Now that he has come, do those demons still have life?” Hearing this, the two cheered up, singing a few mountain songs to pass the time, unaware that Tong Xuanzi heard every word.

Tong Xuanzi relayed their words to the demons, who all burst into loud laughter. Just as they were enjoying themselves, Tong Xuanzi’s face suddenly felt a slap—*smack!*—everyone heard it clearly. Tong Xuanzi’s face reddened halfway and throbbed painfully. He scrambled to his feet, looking around in all directions. The demons hastily gathered in a heap, unsure where the slap had come from. Suddenly, in the confusion, Tong Xuanzi found his precious bottle missing. He hurriedly checked on Fei Fei and Dian Dian, but they had vanished without a trace. Tong Xuanzi was dumbfounded, and the old flood dragon was furious, eyes wide and red.

Ming Mingzi laughed and said, “It was no one else but that lame-footed thief who came invisibly, delivering a slap to Tong Xuanzi, and while we were distracted, stole the bottle and those two things away.” The old flood dragon sighed, “That lame ghost does have some skill; we cannot underestimate him.” He ordered his underling, the Empty Dweller Layman, “You must beware of that fellow’s many transformations and invisible forms. We cannot afford to get slapped again while we linger here.” The demons all shuddered at this. The old flood dragon angrily declared, “If he can become invisible, why can’t I transform? Tomorrow I’ll go stir up trouble in that snail shell of his, to vent my anger.” The demons encouraged him, “Great King, with your power to be insulted by a lame-footed daoist is a disgrace to our sect. Tomorrow’s mission must not be delayed.” The old flood dragon gladly agreed.

Tong Xuanzi pondered deeply, “Forget everything else, the worst is that fellow stole my magic treasure. How can I get it back?” Ming Mingzi and Ling Xuzi laughed, “We hear that only you yourself can open that bottle with your secret incantation. The lame one cannot open it, so even if he takes it to the snail shell, there will be ways to retrieve it later. No need to rush.” Tong Xuanzi stamped his foot, “You only know that I alone can open the bottle, but you don’t realize that the lame demon, having rescued the two captured demons, must have released their souls from the bottle so they could return to their bodies and escape. Otherwise, how could the two demons disappear together? Since he can release the souls inside, he must know how to open the bottle. Even if he cannot open it, he might shatter it, destroying my treasured magic after years of cultivation. How painful and regrettable that would be!” With that, he burst into loud wails. The demons hurried to comfort him.

Ling Xu and Kong Kong, enraged, said, “That lame thief resorts to theft at his first battle; clearly he is not of the orthodox path. Since he is unkind, we need not be righteous. Rest assured, tonight the two of us will each bring our magic treasures to the snail shell to observe the lame thief’s movements and see if the two demons have returned to their souls. If we can strike, we will avenge you and spoil their grand gathering and daoist assembly. Then our sect’s powers will be displayed, not something those young upstarts can resist.” Hearing this, the demons grew even more joyful. The old flood dragon quickly poured two cups of wine to toast the two demons, wishing them swift victory and success. The two demons drank down the wine and cheerfully rose, bidding farewell to the demons. They left the clam shell and headed straight for the snail shell.

The two demons could also transform. Ling Xu became a mosquito, Tong Xuanzi a ant, sneaking quietly into Juexian’s cave. They reached the innermost chamber and saw Iron Crutch Master seated on a large reed cushion, but Fei Fei and Dian Dian were nowhere to be seen. Ling Xu consulted Kong Kong in a whisper, “It seems the two demons have not yet returned to their souls. Though the lame thief has the bottle and the two bodies, he cannot rescue them.” Kong Kong smiled, “Tong Xuanzi can breathe easy; the lame thief only harms others without benefit to himself.” Ling Xu laughed, “What time is this for you to sulk? How is this different from the two demons singing mountain songs inside the bottle?” Kong Kong laughed, “How can you compare? They are captured prisoners; we are free. Why bring it up? No need to be so sensitive.” Ling Xu said, “Enough, stop quarreling. Look, a red light appears on the lame thief’s head. He is surely a person of great virtue. If we fight him openly, none of us would be his match. Better to catch him unaware and stab him with your plum blossom poison needle, saving much trouble.” Tong Xuanzi nodded, “That’s what I was thinking. Look, here comes my treasure!”

Before he finished, a voice whispered in his ear, “So you demons have treasures too? Why not show them so we may all enjoy?” The two demons opened their eyes in alarm, looking around wildly, but saw no one.

Ling Xu panicked, “This is bad. That fellow is truly skilled. I fear we cannot handle him. Let’s retreat.” No sooner had he spoken than laughter sounded, “Too polite. If you want to return to the clam shell, you must leave your treasures here to accompany the Soul-Capturing Bottle, is that not better?” The two demons grew more terrified. Looking again at Iron Crutch Master, he still sat unmoving. Ling Xu said, “Brother Daoist, we came in error. That fellow must be hiding nearby, following us with an external body technique. We don’t know if he is on you or under my belly. If he acts, we cannot see him but he sees us. That’s a sure loss.” Kong Kong said, “I am slow as an ant and walk on the ground; he may not be able to attach to me. Probably he’s on your mosquito body.” Ling Xu said, “No, I fly up and down, restless; he may not be able to possess me either.”

As the two demons debated, another voice said, “Foolish bugs, though you have shrunk small, do you not know there are things smaller still? How could you not be attached?” The two demons grew even more panicked. Ling Xu asked Kong Kong, “What have you transformed into? Where are you now?” Kong Kong answered, “I dare not say. I have become two midges, one on you and one beneath Tong Xuanzi’s belly.” Hearing this, the two demons were terrified beyond measure, took human form, and fled at full speed. After a few steps, they looked back at Iron Crutch Master, who still sat unmoved.

The two demons ran for a long time, thinking they had escaped the snail shell and congratulated each other. One said, “Brother Daoist, today we were lucky; almost didn’t get out of that blasted snail shell.” Another said, “This place is an empty field; I don’t know where it is. When we came, there was no such large place.” Another said, “Never mind. We’ll find a way. Let’s hurry back.” Just then, a voice called, “You two truly don’t understand. Running here and there, you have never left my gourd gate. You’ve given me quite a headache.” Hearing this, the two demons panicked and begged, “Great Immortal, you have teased us enough. Please show mercy and let us go.” The voice said, “That’s not hard. Just leave your treasures here, and I will let you out.” The two demons begged repeatedly, which only angered the voice more. It said sternly, “I am kind enough to release you, yet you are greedy, treasuring even your little toys. Now I will execute you and see if you still have the power to cherish your treasures.”

The two demons had no choice but to kneel and kowtow, begging bitterly. After a long while, suddenly their eyes brightened. Looking up, they saw a monument emerge before them, inscribed with large characters: “The Tomb of Ling Xuzi and Kong Kongzi, Disciples of the Jie Sect.” Terrified, the two demons could not speak. Behind the monument was indeed a large grave, its door open, with two yakshas each holding weapons, beckoning the demons. The two demons were utterly terrified and embraced, weeping.

Luckily, Ling Xuzi was clever and first pleaded to Heaven, willing to leave behind his soul-summoning banner, five-colored stones, and a sword forged from refined steel to slay immortals, begging only for his life. Tong Xuanzi also willingly offered his plum blossom needles and lotus leaf handkerchief. After their prayers, the two demons sorrowfully presented all their treasures to the yakshas. The yakshas then demanded explanations of their use and insisted on testing them before releasing the demons. The two demons explained each item clearly and tested them one by one. Suddenly, a great thunderclap sounded in midair, frightening the demons into embracing and wailing, “Great Immortal has promised mercy, so why strike us with thunder and fire?”

Yet the thunder was loud but distant. In an instant, the monument, grave, and yakshas vanished, replaced by a boundary stone inscribed with small characters: “Go east from here; a land route leads to the clam shell, a journey of one hundred and five thousand li. To the south lies a water route of only three thousand li, but one must pass the Demon Execution Lock, Demon Rolling Dam, Demon Shattering Shoal, and Demon Falling Bridge.” Seeing this, the two demons panicked again and cried out to Heaven, “Great Immortal has shown mercy and pardoned us to return, but this journey is long. The land route takes years, the water route countless dangers. Our powers are weak; how can we pass these gates? Death is certain either way. Better to die by the Great Immortal’s side than suffer hunger, hardship, and peril on the road.”

They knelt and kowtowed until their foreheads and faces bled. Then the voice said, “You little demons are pitiful. Since you plead so, I will not be harsh. Open your eyes and see where you are.” The two demons rejoiced and opened their eyes. To their surprise, there was a broad square; no monument was in sight. They had arrived at their destination. This joy was unlike any they had felt before.

Where exactly they had come to remains to be told. We shall see in the next chapter.
