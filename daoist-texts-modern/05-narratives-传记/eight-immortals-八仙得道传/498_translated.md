# Chapter Thirty: Repaying Old Debts — The Conch Shell Becomes a Daoist Altar; Attacking the Enemy — The Clam’s Belly Sets the Arena

Now, it happened that the two demons, Lingxu and Kongkong, intent on assassinating Master Iron Crutch, transformed themselves into mosquitoes and ants and ventured into the Spiral Palace. Yet, fate had other designs: their assassination attempt failed utterly. Instead, Master Iron Crutch, wielding his profound功 (practice) and merit, trapped the two demons within his gourd. He then compelled them to surrender all the precious法宝 (magical treasures) they had painstakingly refined through bitter toil. After frightening them thoroughly, he waited until the two demons kowtowed so fiercely that their heads bled. Only then did he withdraw the gourd and expel them. A celestial breeze swept them away, depositing them inside the clam shell’s gate.

The two demons opened their eyes and beheld their surroundings with mingled shock, joy, and fear. For Master Iron Crutch was known for his utmost慈悲 (compassion). Not only had he escaped their ambush unharmed, but he had also taken the opportunity to enlighten them, awakening their remorse for past misdeeds and urging them to embrace the正教 (orthodox teaching). This, in itself, was a great blessing. Yet the two demons remained stubbornly unrepentant, offering only plaintive pleas without a single word seeking salvation. Master Iron Crutch realized these two beasts truly lacked福命 (fortune and destiny). Thus, he returned them to their original place.

Grateful beyond measure, the two demons could not help but scramble to bow in thanks for their rebirth, then staggered into the inner hall in disarray. The old flood dragon and more than ten other demons had been anxiously waiting, and upon seeing the two in such a state, were struck dumb with astonishment. Mingmingzi spoke first: “Look at this scene — clearly they have suffered a great defeat.” Tongxuanzi, however, was preoccupied with thoughts of his precious soul-capturing bottle and hurriedly asked, “Brothers, you have returned — did you find the soul-capturing bottle? Are the two demons still there? Are they alive or dead?”

Lingxu hastily gestured with his hand and said, “No need to say more. Today we have suffered a loss unlike any before. Look, all our法宝 have been stripped away.” Tongxuanzi recounted the main events, leaving the assembly wide-eyed and speechless, exchanging glances without a word. The old flood dragon growled, “Never expected you two to suffer such a heavy loss. That lame thief is truly rampant. I shall go fetch our Lord Master at once. We must eliminate him to prevent future troubles.” The demons all rejoiced, praising the old flood dragon.

Just as they prepared to set out, suddenly celestial music rang out loud and clear, and the cry of cranes soared through the sky. The old flood dragon suspiciously muttered, “Could it be another immortal coming to aid them? If so, we must indeed invite our Lord Master here.” Before he finished, a small demon at the gate reported, “Two lords and a lady have arrived to pay respects and are waiting at the entrance.” The old flood dragon’s heart leapt with joy, guessing these must be their Daoist comrades come to assist. He and the demons went out to welcome them.

It was none other than the first-generation great disciples of the Jie Sect: the three immortals Sun Hu, Niu Bo, and Hu Haishan, accompanied by a white-clad female immortal surnamed Bai. Hearing that a daoist altar was being established inside the conch shell, and that figures from both sects had gathered there, they feared their own school might suffer losses. Hence, by the Lord Master’s order, they had come specially to oversee matters. The old flood dragon was delighted and, along with the demons, respectfully greeted them.

Sun Hu inquired about the standoff and the altar’s scheduled date. The old flood dragon reported the defeat of Lingxu and the other three demons, then added, “The altar was originally set for today, but since many comrades have yet to arrive, it has been postponed for ten days. It will surely open before the twentieth of this month.” Hearing of Lingxu’s misfortune, Niu Bo’s anger flared: “How dare the Lord of the Old Lord’s sect bully our school! Since we have arrived, tomorrow we shall build an arena on the great open ground ahead. We will summon them one by one to meet their doom. If no one can defeat the challenger, we will shatter that spiral shell and drive Lady Luo Yuan ashore, forbidding her to linger within five hundred li of Huaihai Village. Brothers, what say you?”

Sun Hu laughed: “Though Iron Crutch has some daoist功 (skill), how great can it be in these few years? Now that he knows we have come, he will surely seek other masters to aid him at sea. We will send word to summon them for the arena, and at the same time, we ourselves will guard the crucial mountain pass. If that fellow ventures out to sea, he will be going up the mountain for reinforcements. We might as well capture him first and avenge our three comrades.” Hearing this, the demons’ faces brightened, praising the plan.

Inside the clam shell, a grand welcoming banquet was prepared. Meanwhile, a small demon was dispatched beneath the spiral shell to send a letter.

Juexian received the letter and, together with Huitong and Zhang Guo, came to see Master Iron Crutch. Taking the letter, the master smiled: “A contest at the sea bottom — truly a marvelous tale. Alas, many comrades will inevitably suffer this trial, which is both pitiful and grievous.” The two understood his meaning and nodded silently. Huitong asked, “Master, will you summon some immortals to aid us?” The master smiled: “No need. Our reinforcements are already on their way.”

Before long, indeed, the immortals Wenshi, Piaomiao, Guangcheng, Yunzhong, and the immortal Wenmei all arrived together. Iron Crutch and Juexian, along with the assembly, went out to greet them. Wenshi smiled at Iron Crutch: “Our Patriarch hears you are skilled in strategy and full of慈善 (benevolence). He greatly praises you.” Iron Crutch humbly replied: “To receive the Patriarch’s favor moves me deeply, a debt I shall never forget. It is especially touching that so many fellow Daoist brothers have come to assist me. Yet in the palace, I was told by the Patriarch himself that at critical moments he would personally come to guide us. I wonder if that will come to pass?” The immortals all said, “This is your special fate. To be nurtured so closely by the Patriarch — who else can compare?”

Zhang Guo also came to pay respects to the immortal Wenmei. The immortal examined his daoist功, seeing his radiant道气 (spiritual energy) and immortal bearing, and was greatly pleased. Nodding, he sighed: “The immortal fates of the two sects are truly beyond explanation. You came from humble origins and have been raised by one such as myself. Now that the storm has passed, you may devote yourself to cultivation. In at most a few hundred years, you will surely attain the Dao. Among those who achieve the Dao in the realm of beings, you count as having good fortune. Yet compared to your uncle Iron Crutch, the depth of his happiness and the thickness of his immortal fate cannot be spoken of in the same breath.” The immortals all sighed in admiration.

Zhang Guo said, “I only seek success, not speed. Those with shallow fate and little fortune will also become immortals, only requiring thousands of years of hard功. To come to the human world and take up cultivation is to accept hardship as part of one’s lot. Though foolish, I do not belittle myself.” Seeing this, Wenmei was pleased: “With such resolve and heart, becoming immortal or Buddha is easy, no cause for worry.” Wenshi and the other immortals, and Iron Crutch, all praised him warmly, leaving Zhang Guo somewhat uneasy.

Soon Huitong came out to pay respects to Wenmei, explaining his tardiness as due to arranging the altar with Juexian and others. Wenmei smiled: “You had important matters; you should complete them before seeing me. How could I blame you?” Huitong thanked him and sat down with Zhang Guo at the head of the assembly.

Wenmei and Wenshi smiled at the immortals Piaomiao and Fire Dragon: “Brothers, you have come, but where are your disciples to serve you? This place belongs to that couple; should they not be the hosts?” The two immortals laughed: “We came hastily and did not notify the Crystal Palace, so they did not know we had arrived. But that couple are loyal and simple folk; within a day or two of hearing we are here, they will surely come to pay respects.”

Before the words were finished, a sudden sound of wind and rain burst forth, followed by the roar of waves, tumultuous and fierce. The immortals wondered at the cause. Master Iron Crutch suspected the clam demons were causing mischief. Mei smiled: “I know it must be the disciples of Piaomiao and Fire Dragon.” No sooner said than a maid from the cave led the Dragon King and Queen forward, who first bowed to the two immortals. The two hurried to greet their senior uncles and brothers. Among them, only Huitong and the Dragon King were well acquainted.

Though Zhang Guo had been old friends with them for hundreds of years, he now felt humble and respectfully bowed to the Dragon King and Queen as elders. After a round of exchanges, the scene was lively and warm. The Dragon King said that a new great clam had arrived in the South Sea, had transformed its shell into a palace, and invited demons from all directions to set up an arena to challenge the immortals here. “I had long planned to drive them out and forbid their mischief, but I heard there are many capable people inside. The Jie Sect’s Lord Master Tongtian himself plans to come to support his disciples. Our daoist powers are limited and cannot resist him. Fortunately, many celestial immortals are here, so the demons are not hard to dispel. For now, we feign carelessness and see how they dare oppose us.”

Wenshi laughed: “Now that we have come, we cannot stand aside. Tomorrow we will all go to see how they arrange their affairs and who the experts among them are. Knowing early will help us ask our junior brother Li to finish his altar work soon, so we can all return to our heavenly posts without lingering long at the sea bottom and disturbing the Dragon King.” All the immortals smiled and agreed.

The Dragon King and Queen were deeply humbled: “Your arrival is truly a blessing for the sea realm. We are overwhelmed with welcome and cannot say how to express our gratitude for the trouble.” Fire Dragon smiled: “Indeed. This is your domain; it is only right you fulfill the duties of host.” The Dragon King rose and smiled: “Of course. We had planned to invite all the senior uncles and brothers to tour the palace, but knowing the altar is not yet complete, I dare not impose. As for all provisions, the palace has fully prepared them and sent officials to deliver.” The immortals all thanked them.

Piaomiao laughed heartily: “Brothers, no need for such formality. The Dragon King and Queen enjoy heavenly feasts and rare delicacies beyond compare. We are fortunate to be here even once; what harm in troubling them a little?” Yunzhongzi and Guangchengzi laughed: “So it seems you two teachers are just greedy and want to extort a little from your disciples, but don’t drag us into it!” Everyone laughed.

As they spoke, the Dragon Palace sent servants to set a grand banquet, one seat for each immortal. The Dragon King and Queen courteously invited them to sit, personally serving wine and sitting with them at the lower seat. The immortals, not wishing to be formal, settled in. The Dragon King and Queen poured wine and laid out dishes and fine fruits, an endless display of wealth and splendor, countless delicacies and rare flavors. The hosts urged the guests to drink, and all drank freely and joyfully. The feast began in the morning and lasted until afternoon before dispersing. The Dragon King and Queen, having duties, took their leave.

Suddenly Wenshi felt a stirring in his heart and smiled at Iron Crutch: “Brother, those demons are truly shortsighted. To prevent you from summoning reinforcements, they have stationed people inside the palace to wait for you. We can play a trick on them now.” Iron Crutch laughed and asked what plan he had. Wenshi smiled: “You are the altar master and cannot leave. Let Wenmei and I transform into your disciples’ likenesses and allow ourselves to be captured. On the day of the arena, we will act from within to strike a decisive blow. Would that not be convenient?” The immortals applauded the cleverness.

Hearing the word “disciples,” Iron Crutch suddenly recalled an important matter and said hurriedly: “I wanted to ask you about my disciples Feifei and Diandian, who were captured by demons and sealed inside the soul-capturing bottle. We have retrieved the bottle but cannot open it. What shall we do?” Wenshi laughed: “That must be Tongxuanzi’s magic treasure. That thing is like a cicada shell. Our senior brother Yun Ding taught him some daoist法 (method), but he grew impatient and foolishly challenged us. His fate is nearly spent. Show me the bottle and I will examine it to find a way to open it.”

Iron Crutch took out the soul-capturing bottle from his bosom. Wenshi held it in his hands, and the immortals gathered round. Wenshi chanted softly, spitting golden气, which shot straight to the bottle’s mouth. The mouth cracked open, and two souls were restored to their bodies. Inside, Feifei and Diandian cried out “Ah!” and scrambled up, hastily bowing in thanks to the celestial saviors.

Then Wenmei transformed into Iron Crutch’s shape, and Wenshi split into two, becoming Feifei and Diandian. The three rose amidst the clouds and looked around. Indeed, demons guarded all sides. Wenmei and Wenshi fought bravely but without full strength and were soon captured. The demons rejoiced and escorted the three back into the clam shell.

The two immortals looked up and saw faint purple clouds enveloping the shell’s summit. Alarmed, they said, “So the Jie Sect’s Lord Master Tongtian has arrived. Our disguises cannot fool his eyes. We must be careful not to let our cleverness backfire.” Before they finished, they were pushed inside by the demons to the second large courtyard. There stood an arena, crowded with many demons and immortals of all sorts — refined and vulgar, beautiful and ugly. In the center sat an old Daoist with white hair, beard, square nose, and long ears. The two immortals recognized him as Lord Master Tongtian, though they did not know when he had arrived.

Just as they pondered escape, Tongtian slightly opened his eyes and smiled at several senior disciples beside him: “Look at these fools under my command, so unwise. Knowing I am here, they still dare to use transformation法 to test me.” The disciples asked, “Are these three not Iron Crutch and his disciples?” Tongtian sneered, “Bring that confused youth here. They can transform and use the Five Escapes, but I have a talisman to stick on their heads. Once marked, they cannot flee.” The senior disciples Sun Hu and Niu Bo took the talisman and descended from the stage.

Wenmei winked at Wenshi, who understood and said, “Let us go.” With a stomp, they used earth escape法 to vanish from the clam shell and return to their camp, leaving Tongtian and his disciples furious.

The next day, Wenshi, Wenmei, Piaomiao, Fire Dragon, Guangchengzi, Yunzhongzi, Iron Crutch and his disciples, Huitong, Zhang Guo, Juexian, and over ten immortals went to the clam shell. Tongtian Lord Master still sat high on the stage as before, unmoving. Wenshi called out loudly: “Lord Master Tongtian, though our sect and yours differ, we are all outsiders with the Dao. Our comrade Juexian, burdened by heavy sins from a past life, is holding a few days’ altar to liberate resentful souls, which is reasonable. Yet we do not know what offense he gave you to cause your arrival as if to battle an enemy. What is the reason?”

Tongtian did not answer. From the side, generals Niu Bo and Sun Hai burst forth, shouting: “Wenshi, Wenmei, do not speak nonsense! Since you know we are all outsiders cultivating the Dao, you should respect and be close to each other. How then do you slander our sect as non-human? Are all Wenmei’s disciples human? Heaven cherishes life; all beings are equal, noble or lowly, depending on cultivation. How can you insult by birth? Our sect has always been magnanimous and does not trouble you. But the little demon Luo Yuan overstepped and sought conflict with Brother Jiao. Though Jiao was once his son, a thousand years have passed and many generations changed. Why stir up old grudges? Our Patriarch, with great compassion, came to aid him. If you are wise, return to your mountain, hand over the spiral maid to us, and all will end. Otherwise, you will surely come to grief today.”

Wenshi and Wenmei laughed: “From what you say, it seems our being not counted as your kind caused old grudges. By chance, that old flood dragon went to complain, and you took the chance to come for revenge, yes? Setting aside the truth of your claims, that flood dragon is full of all manner of rebellion and folly. Even if he did not seek us out, we would have to find him to rid the people of a scourge. Yet he came to us himself. Know that his time is up; thousands of years of功 will vanish. You journey far to aid him in wrongdoing—truly you do not understand Heaven’s dao or great justice. We pity you for this.” Hearing this, Niu Bo and the others grew furious.

How the anger of Niu Bo and the others will unfold remains to be told in the next chapter.
