# Chapter Thirty-One: The Contest of Magic in the Clam Palace — The Gourd Conceals an Immortal

Now it happened that within the clam shell a grand arena was set, and the Primordial Lord of All Heaven issued his command. Seeing that Niu Bo and the other immortals on this side could not outmatch their opponents in debate, he declared: “Who among you has the skill to match them in words? Now we have arranged this arena; let them come forth and compete. If they prevail, we shall lower our banners and return to our mountain. But if not, then as I have said before, those snails and bats shall no longer swagger here. Each one must be driven beyond the heavens, never to return to the Central Land again.” Having spoken, the Lord stepped down from the platform.

On this side, Lingxu, Tongxuan, and Kongkong—three companions—all had lost their treasures and could no longer display their majesty. Only Mingmingzi remained unyielding, determined to avenge his three comrades. He stepped first onto the stage and cried out: “Which disciple of your sect dares come forth and test skills with this humble Daoist?” Before his words had ended, the female immortal Huitong leapt up. After exchanging names, each grasped a treasured sword, and they clashed fiercely upon the stage, yet no victor was seen.

Mingmingzi secretly unleashed a magic treasure from his hand and turned to flee. As Huitong pursued, he suddenly shouted: “Wicked woman! Here comes the Master’s treasure!” Huitong looked up and saw a red light hurtling straight for her forehead. Mingmingzi was none other than a firefly perfected, and the red light was his own fire; any mortal struck by it would be scorched to ashes in an instant. But Huitong was prepared—she drew a treasured fan from her sleeve and fanned the flame thrice against the wind. Though the fire could not burn Mingmingzi, it could not cross over to her side either. She laughed: “You little insect, truly the glow of a firefly, yet you dare to frighten people? Behold your ancestor’s fire!” With that, she spat a red pellet shaped like a fox’s body, which struck Mingmingzi. Suddenly, flames burst forth all around the stage, engulfing him. Mingmingzi’s original form was consumed—revealed as a monstrous mosquito. From the fiery sparks he fluttered down off the stage, his head scorched, wings tattered, bones broken, barely clinging to life as he retreated to his formation.

The old flood dragon, seeing Mingmingzi’s disgrace, was enraged. He instantly breathed forth a single mouthful of spittle, and the entire stage was submerged beneath a vast ocean. Huitong was terrified and fled in disorder, dragging mud and water behind her back to her own ranks. At that moment, the immortal Wenmei’s soul journeyed to the Dragon Palace, urging the Dragon King and Queen to quickly restrain the floodwaters, forbidding the demons from borrowing them. The Dragon King reported: “Though that old flood dragon employs wicked magic, his nature is water. At his full strength, he can overturn rivers and seas, but the disciples have not lent him their power.” Wenmei was helpless and returned to the clam shell.

Fortunately, Iron Crutch Master arrived soon after and inquired about the matter. The waters grew ever higher, pressing this way, but all the immortals had methods to avoid the flood. When the water reached their sides, it parted as if by magic, causing no harm. Iron Crutch smiled and said: “This calls for my gourd to hold a cup of it.” Hastily opening the gourd and chanting quietly, the raging floodwaters all flowed into the gourd. The old flood dragon, furious, summoned all the waters of the Southern Sea to drown the immortals. Yet the greater the flood, the faster it poured into the gourd, and outside the gourd not a single drop of water remained. Suddenly, Wen shouted: “That beast truly knows no fear of death! If you drain an entire sea, would you not kill all the living beings there? Are you not afraid of violating Heaven’s laws, inviting fire and thunder to punish you?” The old flood dragon was startled awake. Seeing that the great waters could not harm the enemy, he reluctantly formed a spell to halt the flood. Iron Crutch Master raised the gourd and smiled toward the stage: “You may withdraw the waters, but know that the shallows there are but a few inches deep, still troubling the living beings.” The old flood dragon was speechless and slunk off the stage.

Then Sun Hu stood before the stage and loudly called: “Who dares to spar with this humble Daoist?” Guangchengzi smiled at Yunzhongzi and said: “Sun Hu is a tiger demon. He carries a string of skull beads which, when shaken in the wind, cause the faint-hearted to lose their courage. Brother Dao, you have the Calming Spirit Pearl to counter him. But his swordsmanship and martial skill are excellent; be on your guard.” Yunzhongzi drew his sword and ascended the stage. After exchanging names, they leapt into a fierce battle. Though Yunzhongzi was a master of deep Dao, facing Sun Hu’s twin hammers he felt the force keenly and laughed: “After all, he is a fierce tiger, with some real strength.” Hearing this, Sun Hu grew angrier still and swung his twin hammers upon Yunzhongzi’s body with a hail of blows. Yunzhongzi was swift and agile, evading every strike. The crowd below saw Sun Hu’s hammers strike Yunzhongzi, yet he remained unscathed. He darted behind Sun Hu, then flashed past his back, leaving Sun Hu powerless and sweating profusely with rage. Suddenly, Sun Hu drew a string of skulls—some seventy or eighty in number—souls of those he had devoured, forged into this treasure. He shook the beads toward Yunzhongzi, rattling fiercely. Even Yunzhongzi’s great magic caused a chill to run down his spine. Fortunately, he had anticipated this and held the Calming Spirit Pearl to counter the skull beads.

Sun Hu’s eyes widened as he saw the pearl glow, a yard in diameter, reflecting many fierce ghosts, each wild-haired, bloodied, and terrifying. These were the true forms of the skulls, gnashing teeth and lunging at Sun Hu. He screamed and fell to the ground in terror.

Guangchengzi shouted from below: “Brother Yunzhong, act quickly! This beast has devoured many; his evil is full. Do not treat him lightly!” Before the words ended, Yunzhongzi thrust his sword into Sun Hu’s belly. A tiger’s roar echoed like heaven and earth shattering. Sun Hu died an unnatural death. On the stage lay a dead tiger, one paw clutching his dreadful skull beads. Yunzhongzi raised the beads, about to descend, when suddenly a wild shout came from behind: “Thief Daoist, don’t run! Come and spar with me!”

Yunzhongzi turned to see a monster with a bull’s head, horse’s face, dragon’s body, and tiger’s tail—this was the Primordial Lord’s mount, the Dragon-Tiger Hybrid. Clutching a gilded shield, it struck at Yunzhongzi’s head and face. Seeing such a hideous fiend charging fiercely, Yunzhongzi stepped back three paces and laughed: “What rotten luck, to have such a monster appear in broad daylight! You don’t even look in a mirror? You can’t even shape yourself into a proper beast, let alone a human face, yet you show yourself before men?” His words enraged the Dragon-Tiger Hybrid, who roared and spewed twin streams of smoke from its nostrils, foul as dung and rank as serpent venom.

Yunzhongzi felt sick and, standing at the edge of the stage, stumbled off. Guangchengzi caught him just in time.

The immortal Wenmei frowned: “Cultivators fear nothing but filth and foulness. This creature’s stench is unbearable. If we try to drown or burn it, the stink will only worsen. And given its dragon body, it may well master the water. How then shall we deal with it?” Wenmei laughed: “Brother, why fear such a lowly monster? Wouldn’t that invite mockery?” Wenmei said: “Not that I fear it, but such a vile beast should not sully the immortal body. Have you not seen Brother Yunzhong suffer from it?” Wenmei pondered and said: “I have it. The foulness fears the purest fragrance. Iron Crutch Brother’s gourd contains a lily scent made by the Patriarch himself. Let us try it.” Wenmei invited Iron Crutch Master to the stage. Limping with his staff in one hand and gourd in the other, Iron Crutch ascended the arena. The Dragon-Tiger Hybrid, unaware of its own hideousness, laughed at Iron Crutch’s ugly appearance. Iron Crutch paid no heed, simply removed the gourd’s lid and chanted. Instantly a rich fragrance spread far and wide. The Dragon-Tiger Hybrid was unprepared for such a counter to its stench and soon fainted atop the stage.

The Primordial Lord, seeing his mount felled, hastily summoned many divine generals with talismans to guard the Dragon-Tiger Hybrid. Iron Crutch angrily said: “The Jie Sect is but evil demons and heretics. Why do your divine generals obey their orders?” The generals transformed and replied: “Master, we serve only the talismans, not the person. Since these are your commands, we dare not err. We take our leave.” Iron Crutch thanked them repeatedly, and they departed.

Fearing the Primordial Lord might try other tricks, Iron Crutch did not wait for the generals to ascend. He swiftly slashed the Dragon-Tiger Hybrid in two with his sword. Green blood spurted forth, its stench even worse than before. Iron Crutch had anticipated this and leapt off the stage, but the sword, tainted by the foulness, fluttered about the stage, unable to descend. At that moment, the one-horned great lion ascended with a blade. Unprepared, it was struck by the sword’s flash and lost half its horn. The immortals below laughed: “From now on, the one-horned lion is only half-horned.” The lion, furious, saw the sword still flying and raised its blade high. When the sword came near, the lion struck it with a “clack.” The clash rang out, sparks flying in all directions. Fortunately, Iron Crutch chanted a spell and recalled the sword. The tainted edge looked as if rusted, still exuding a foul stench that made one nauseous. Iron Crutch cursed: “I shall need several days of cultivation to repair this.” The immortals laughed: “You have only suffered a small loss. The monster’s life is in your hands, and its master has lost his mount. How vexed he must be!”

Before the words ended, the Primordial Lord and the one-horned lion stood side by side at the stage’s edge. The Lord thundered: “How dare you rascals damage my mount! I have spared you out of consideration for our shared Dao, to preserve your lives. But now you run wild—do not blame me if I strike you down!” Without delay, he spread his hands wide, forming a great coil, chanting swiftly, and shouted: “Swift!”

In an instant, the sky darkened and the earth dimmed; not a glimmer of light remained. This was the Primordial Lord’s most fierce and poisonous spell, called the “Executioner’s Net.” Raising both hands, he formed a vast net, chanting as he did so. Though invisible and intangible, no immortal or demon caught within could step beyond its bounds. Chinese history speaks of King Wen of Zhou drawing a prison on the ground—similar, but that could only imprison offenders, not bring death. This Executioner’s Net was far more terrible: those trapped felt countless needles and ropes binding them tighter and tighter, the pain growing unbearable. No matter how fierce, in less than twelve hours one would dissolve into a pool of blood and water.

The Primordial Lord confined the immortals within the net, yet fearing some might be powerful enough to escape, he ordered the clam spirit to sew the shell shut and affix his divine talisman, preventing escape. He himself, fearing the Patriarch Laozi might come to their aid, stationed several senior disciples in the clouds outside the clam shell. Once twelve hours passed and the immortals all turned to blood and water, he would claim complete victory, shatter the snail shell, drive away Luo Yuan and the others, and return without ceremony to his southern cloud peaks.

Meanwhile, inside the Executioner’s Net, the immortals suffered greatly. Wen Shi and the other four true immortals could not discern the spell’s nature. They tried various methods to escape the strange net, but it was no tangible thing. It was forged from the Primordial Lord’s own sinews, appearing and vanishing at will. The more they tried to break it, the more unyielding it became. The immortals were at their wit’s end. After some time, they felt as if bound by ropes all over, or pricked by countless needles. The most advanced cultivators felt little, but Huitong, Zhang Guo, Diandian, Feifei, and others writhed in unbearable pain, wailing and begging for death.

Growing ever more anxious, Iron Crutch suddenly recalled the Patriarch’s words. He loudly advised the Daoist friends to endure the pain a while longer, not to show weakness to the enemy. The Patriarch had foreseen this tribulation and promised to come personally to rescue them. They must wait patiently. Hearing this, Huitong and the others wept: “Master Uncle, your Dao is profound and you feel no such pain, but we suffer terribly!”

Iron Crutch was both ashamed and anxious. Just then, Wenmei said: “Brother Iron Crutch, your gourd holds another world. It can be a refuge. Why not try it? That treasure was forged by the Patriarch himself. Though the demon magic is fierce, it cannot penetrate inside.” The immortals rejoiced: “Excellent! Quickly bring it forth!” Iron Crutch hastily removed the gourd’s lid. A ray of light shone forth from its mouth. The immortals hurried into the brightness. Though few in number, they all entered, feeling the place grow ever brighter and larger. Deeper inside, furnishings and implements appeared; outside, fields, homes, and mountains—all were complete. They dwelled in three thatched cottages, as comfortable as outside, though none knew if they could escape the gourd.

After some discussion, Iron Crutch declared: “This place can only shelter us temporarily. Once we leave the gourd, we fall again into the Primordial Lord’s net. Escape is impossible.” Hearing this, the immortals were greatly disappointed. Yet the injured, upon entering the gourd, found their wounds healed, pain vanished, and all was as usual. This comforted them, and they resolved to await the Patriarch’s rescue.

Time passed unknown. Suddenly, voices sounded outside. The immortals listened carefully and heard the Primordial Lord’s strange words: “My great spell has never failed. I have slain many demons and even the Golden Immortals of various caves fear me. Why then do these people show no sign of blood and water? Moreover, where have they all gone? What can this mean?” Another voice said: “Master, see, that gourd belongs to the lame thief demon. It hides thousands inside. Could these rascals all be hiding there?” The Primordial Lord replied: “That is possible. But no matter what, they cannot escape outside the gourd. I will burn it with the Samadhi True Fire and see what they do!”

Inside, the immortals heard this and Iron Crutch laughed: “He plans to burn my gourd! Truly foolish. My gourd is no rustic farmer’s pot to be burned or cut. If it were useless, would it have so many powers?” Huitong laughed: “If they set fire outside, nothing else matters, but I fear the inside will grow hot.” Zhang Guo chuckled: “What of it? It’s cold here anyway. With a fire stove sent by him, isn’t it cozy and amusing?” The immortals burst into laughter.

Outside, voices said: “Listen, there are voices inside. These rascals truly hide in the gourd!” Inside, the immortals laughed in turn: “What a bother! They become demons in the clam, and we become immortals in the gourd. If this stalemate continues, who knows whether the clam shell will be crushed by the gourd, or the gourd flattened by the clam shell!”

What witty words the demons outside spoke next remains to be told in the next chapter.
