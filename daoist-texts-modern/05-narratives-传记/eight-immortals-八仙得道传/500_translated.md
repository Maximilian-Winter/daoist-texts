# Chapter Thirty-Two: The Battle of Magical Arts—The Sealed Gourd Shatters; The Spirited Clam Shell Yields and Surrenders

Now, it happened that all the immortals inside the gourd, hearing the demon outside speaking, found it exceedingly amusing, so much so that they forgot all their peril. After a while, they suddenly noticed the air within the gourd shift; just as Zhang Guo had said, it grew somewhat hot, yet not unbearably so.

The Perfected Wen Shi smiled and said, “Zhang Guo fears the cold; this warm air is a welcome balm—it should make him more comfortable. But if it grows any hotter, it might well roast you all dry. What then?” Hui Tong laughed and replied, “No matter. I reckon the Three Mysterious True Fire of the Lord of All Under Heaven’s power is no greater than this. Yet, since he is the supreme leader of the sect, his dao power is not ordinary, thus this effect. Were it any less, I doubt Brother Zhang could even persuade him to turn up the heat! If the senior masters doubt me, listen again to what the outsiders say.”

All present quieted and pressed their ears to listen. They heard the voice of the Lord of All Under Heaven, speaking with bitter anger: “These thieving daos are truly stubborn! Even my Three Mysterious True Fire cannot burn them to death. Clearly, these fellows have some skill!” At this, the immortals inside burst into uproarious laughter. Then the Lord of All Under Heaven said to someone, “Quick, listen! These thieves are still laughing inside!” Another demon outside said, “This fellow’s nature is thin-skinned; that’s why we can hear their laughter even from outside. Otherwise, how could we hear them at all?” Then one demon expressed surprise, “This is truly strange! The gourd is so thin, and the Patriarch’s Three Mysterious Fire so fierce—how can it fail to burn them? And the gourd remains intact, not a mark upon it. Isn’t that odd?” These words only made the immortals inside laugh all the more.

Fei Fei and Dian Dian, both straightforward by nature, could no longer restrain themselves. They shouted loudly, “You demon folk! You don’t even understand such simple reason, yet dare to pose as immortals? The very name ‘immortal’ is insulted by you! Listen well: we truly are heavenly Golden Immortals. Your Patriarch’s so-called Three Mysterious Fire, after all this burning, cannot harm our Master’s treasure, much less our bodies. That’s just a dream!”

This shout reached outside and startled the demons under the Lord of All Under Heaven. Among them was a little white demon, originally a snake spirit who had refined herself; because of her pure white color, she called herself Lady White. Lady White said to the Lord of All Under Heaven, “Your servant reports: the gourd is from the old man’s garden, and he personally tempered it. Naturally, fire cannot harm it. If the gourd is unbroken, how can these thieving daos die? In my humble opinion, it would be better to take this thing back to the mountain and use the Patriarch’s talismans to seal them beneath Cloud Peak Mountain, so they cannot emerge for a thousand or ten thousand years. Even if they do not die, it is as good as death. Meanwhile, we can burn the clam shell and destroy it. Then we will have complete victory and need not linger here longer. Tomorrow, the Old Lord will come, and there will surely be a bloody battle. Though we do not fear them, it is not worth the trouble. What does the Patriarch think?”

Hearing this, Dian Dian jumped up and said to Hui Tong and Zhang Guo, “Brothers, did you hear that? This little white demon’s plan is far more cunning than the others’. If the Lord of All Under Heaven listens to her and locks us beneath the mountain, will we ever see the light of day again?” Hui Tong laughed at his worry, but then Master Iron Crutch shouted, “No nonsense! What do you know? I have already reckoned the Patriarch will come to rescue us within two hours. Everyone, be patient and wait a little longer.” Fei Fei and Dian Dian were both half surprised and half pleased to hear this.

Outside, the Lord of All Under Heaven indeed approved Lady White’s plan. He ordered her to lead thirty small demons to smash the clam shell and drive away Luo Yuan and the others. Once done, they were to come to Cloud Peak Mountain to meet him without fail. He also commanded the Howling Void Hermit and the Bull Demon King to patrol the sea winds; if any thieves came that way, they were to report immediately. He ordered the Old Flood Dragon to cover the rear, to fend off the Dragon King couple’s pursuit, to resist but not to win, retreating all the way toward Cloud Peak Mountain, hoping they might be chased back to their own mountain. With these assignments made, the Lord of All Under Heaven commanded Lingxuzi and Tongxuzi to hold the gourd. 

Unbeknownst to them, the immortals inside heard all these orders clearly. The senior immortals were certain the Patriarch would come to their aid soon and they would escape disaster. Their hearts were calm and peaceful. The lesser cultivators, seeing their calmness, also relaxed and felt no fear.

At that moment, they suddenly felt the house they were in sway slightly. The Perfected Wen Shi laughed, “Those two fellows, whatever their names are, have obeyed their master’s command and are now playing with our temporary dwelling!” Together with Wen Mei and the four other Perfected Ones, he cast a heavy-body spell, pressing the gourd down so solidly it was heavier than Mount Tai. Lingxuzi and the others could barely budge it, pushing hard a few times, but it was like a dragonfly shaking a stone pillar—no movement at all.

Seeing this, the Lord of All Under Heaven, alarmed, laughed and shouted, “They have cast a heavy-body spell! What use is your little strength against that?” Then he muttered incantations, drew his treasured sword, and pointed at the gourd, instantly lifting the mountain-like weight. His chief disciple, Hu Shanhai, lightly lifted the gourd, tossing and turning it so that the immortals inside were flipped about, somersaulting one after another. The Perfected Wen Shi was furious, “Damn demon dogs! How dare you be so rude?” He called on Master Iron Crutch to perform a spell to enlarge the gourd as much as possible.

Master Iron Crutch chanted “Great, great, great” seven or eight times, and the gourd grew larger than a house, frightening Hu Shanhai so much he dropped it immediately. Then Iron Crutch chanted “High, high, high,” and the gourd grew taller than a mountain. In a moment, it grew ever larger and higher without limit, pressing hard against the clam shell. The demons inside were crushed and battered, trapped with nowhere to flee, their cries shaking the heavens.

The Lord of All Under Heaven paid no heed to these demons but hurriedly cast a spell to tighten his Immortal-Slaying Net. Yet the gourd’s power equaled that of the net, so the pressure from outside and the expansion from inside balanced out. Alas, the clam palace was already stuffed full with the gourd, all inside objects were utterly destroyed, hundreds of small demons were crushed to death, and many powerful demons were injured and unable to move, lying on the ground wailing.

The Lord of All Under Heaven quickly took out elixirs to heal their wounds, then used his arts to rapidly enlarge a clam palace just like Iron Crutch’s gourd. He laughed and said to the demons, “Do not worry. No matter how formidable that cripple is, if he can make the gourd so vast as to blot out sun and sky, I have means to stretch this clam shell beyond the heavens. If they think they can use such petty tricks to break the shell, they are dreaming!” After a while, seeing the gourd shrink again, he laughed, “Perhaps these fools know illusions won’t work and dare not deceive anymore.” The demons rejoiced and praised their master’s boundless magic.

Just as the Lord of All Under Heaven was about to speak, suddenly outside the clam shell came a loud thunderclap. The Lord of All Under Heaven’s face paled. “That is the Old Lord’s Palm Thunder! Could it be the Old Daoist himself has truly come to oppose me?” Before he finished, two more thunderclaps roared. He stamped his foot and said, “Enough! I should not have sent them to patrol the winds. The Howling Void and Bull Demon disciples have limited power; how could they withstand such thunder and fire? Surely their lives are lost. I wonder what Lady White’s fate is at the clam shell—can she escape this calamity?” He fell silent, calculating the situation, then nodded, “Good, good. Lady White has escaped the water’s surface, caught by a fisherman, but soon sold to be released. This one has some destiny; no need to worry. The pity is the Bull Demon and Howling Void lost their lives in vain—how sad!”

Before he finished, the clam shell shook violently, breaking in several places. The old clam, tearful and sorrowful, knelt before the master, begging for mercy. The Lord of All Heaven was both ashamed and angry, growing more furious at the clam’s pitiful state. He shouted, “Ignorant beast, what nonsense do you babble? If you are not meant to die, you cannot find death even if you seek it; if you are meant to die, what use is begging?” With that, he kicked the old clam aside and strode out wielding his sword.

Outside, he met the Old Lord riding a blue ox, holding a whisk. Around him were only four young boys with topknots—no soldiers. Seeing the Lord of All Heaven, the Old Lord laughed and said, “Brother Daoist, as leader of a sect, how can you not understand the principles of cause and effect? That awakened one attained true fruit through heterodox means and now, by his master’s command, invites the Daoist Master of Morality to hold a few days’ ritual to liberate the souls harmed in the past. This is all very good. The Old Flood Dragon was once his son; having oppressed his birth mother, he has rebelled to the utmost. After a thousand years, to come seeking revenge—how can that be justified? You, as leader and founder of their sect, should have reprimanded and stopped such impropriety long ago. How could you heed this fellow’s slander, rashly raise arms, and cause trouble? In doing so, you have harmed your own disciples and who knows how many living beings besides. This is your fault. Now that I have come, out of kindness for our shared otherworldliness and pity for your ten-thousand-year cultivation and position, I will not punish you. See, I come alone, without a single soldier—this shows my intent to resolve matters peacefully. Listen to me and return to your mountain to repent. If not, consider well: your dao power and magic cannot match my disciples. How can you withstand a single blow from me? Prepare for battle as you will; I will not strike first.”

The Lord of All Heaven, stung by this rebuke, flushed red with anger and shouted, “Li Er, don’t show off! Your disciples usually treat my followers with such disdain, making them ashamed. Now you come to test who is superior. Your high disciples are already caught in my net, soon to rot into pus and blood. How can you say I am inferior? You bring no soldiers; I too fight alone. Anyone who needs help is no true sect leader.” The Old Lord smiled, “Do you really think my disciples are caught in your net? What nonsense! Look behind you.”

The Lord of All Heaven turned and looked. Indeed, the Daoist disciples he had just trapped stood there happily, untroubled, watching the battle. He did not know what magic the Old Lord used or when these people had come out. Shocked and angry, he turned back and shouted, “Li Er, don’t push your luck! See how I use my sword light to take your head.” He opened his mouth and spat forth hundreds of blue lights, which instantly became hundreds of sharp swords surrounding the Old Lord, attacking from all sides.

The Old Lord laughed heartily, waving his whisk lightly. The sword lights scattered like dust. Seeing no way forward, the Lord of All Heaven hastily withdrew his attack.

At that moment, the Old Lord shouted, “Lord of All Under Heaven, try my blade light!” As he spoke, ten thousand golden lights shot forth, transforming into ten thousand daggers attacking the Lord of All Heaven.

The Lord of All Heaven twisted his body, transforming into a hawk, soaring upward to strike the Old Lord’s head. The Old Lord feigned ignorance, calmly producing a lotus blossom above his head to shield himself. The hawk could not descend, but this angered several of the Old Lord’s top disciples.

The Perfected Wen Shi shouted, “Lord of All Under Heaven, how shameful! We hear of beasts becoming human, but never a sect leader imitating beasts to secretly harm others. Such conduct is beneath our Patriarch’s dignity. Open your eyes wide and behold my magic treasure!”

The Lord of All Heaven circled in the air, furious at these words, but eager to see the magic treasure, he opened his eyes wide. As Wen Shi spoke, he had already drawn his divine crossbow from his sleeve and shot at the Lord of All Heaven’s eyes. Unexpectedly, the Lord of All Heaven was struck by a black pearl, blood streaming down his face, agonizing beyond measure. Luckily, he had elixirs on hand and quickly applied them, easing the pain, but one eye was blinded.

Wen Shi’s divine crossbow was forged within the Old Lord’s elixir furnace from golden essence, empowered by sacred talismans. An ordinary demon could not withstand it; only because the Lord of All Heaven had cultivated the deathless body of ten thousand kalpas was he only partially injured.

Suffering this great loss, the Lord of All Heaven’s heart burned with resentment. He flew south, then northeast, intending to return to the clam shell and summon disciples for revenge. Yet the clam spirit, offended first by the senior brothers and then by the master’s rebuke, harbored resentment and had already secretly allied with Guang Chengzi and others, handing over all the demons hidden in the shell to the Old Lord. Only the Old Flood Dragon, sensing the danger, escaped early and happened to meet the Lord of All Heaven on the cloud road.

The Old Flood Dragon wept and bowed in the clouds, recounting the clam maid’s betrayal. The Lord of All Heaven sighed to Heaven, knowing he could not fight further, and took the Old Flood Dragon back to Cloud Peak Mountain.

Thus ended the battle of magical arts between the two sects. The Old Lord’s disciples lost, but thanks to Master Iron Crutch’s gourd refuge, they escaped death and even claimed victory. Such is the wondrous power of the gourd.

Among the common folk arose the saying: “The sealed gourd that cannot be broken”—this phrase comes from this very event. Another saying: “What medicine is sold inside the gourd?” praises the gourd’s efficacy. As for the many mysteries within, they are not for outsiders to know.

This tale has passed down for thousands of years. Though we live late and have not seen the true forms and holy deeds of those Golden Immortals of the upper realms, these two sayings alone allow us to glimpse the gourd’s profound mystery; and from the gourd’s marvel, we may imagine the boundless dao magic of the celestial immortals above.

This is mere idle talk, not to be dwelled upon. Gentle readers, please sit a while longer. Let me rest briefly, then continue to recount the wondrous tales of He Xian’s attainment of the dao, Zhongli’s appearance, Meng Jiangnu’s flesh turning to silverfish, and the creation of the Zhejiang tides by the mysterious pearl.
