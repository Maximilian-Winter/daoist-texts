# Chapter Thirty-Three: The Great Household Bewitched by a Demon’s Jest — The Earth Deity Explains the Ghostly Maze

Now it happened that since the Immortal Maiden He parted ways with Li Tieguai, she dwelt alone in a stone chamber upon Mount Heng, cultivating diligently for more than one hundred years. The Mysterious Lady, having heard of her single-hearted dedication and tireless practice, descended herself to impart the Great Dao. Receiving this profound teaching, the Immortal Maiden suddenly felt her knowledge leap forward, her progress growing ever swifter.

As the Mysterious Lady prepared to depart, she further bestowed upon her the methods to summon spirits and dispatch generals; should danger or urgent trouble arise, she might call upon them to come forth and protect her. Yet, the local Earth Deity of this mountain was an aged goddess. Seeing the Immortal Maiden’s peerless beauty and relentless cultivation—and being a woman herself—she grew especially fond and affectionate toward her. From then on, she frequently visited the stone chamber, and the two would exchange tales of celestial courts and underworld realms, discussing the ultimate truths of the Golden Elixir and wondrous Dao. Whenever the Earth Deity encountered doubts, the Immortal Maiden would select those worthy of teaching and instruct them, winning the Earth Deity’s heartfelt admiration and reverence, so much so that she prostrated herself utterly.

Because the Immortal Maiden was female and secluded deep in the mountains, she took no disciples. Not long ago, many male and female demons and spirits from nearby caves had come to harass her, but she drove them away with her methods. Some, seeing her Daoist prowess, willingly offered themselves to serve as her escorts, and she comforted them kindly before sending them off. After becoming acquainted with the Earth Deity, however, two ghostly attendants began to serve her public and private affairs. Whenever the Immortal Maiden had business, the Earth Deity would order these two ghosts to run errands on her behalf, and the Immortal Maiden was greatly touched by such kindness.

One evening, after completing her evening recitation, the Immortal Maiden stepped out of her cave to enjoy the moonlight. Standing alone upon a great rock atop the mountain peak, she raised her head and looked around, her mind clear and spirit bright. Suddenly, a gust of wind stirred behind the mountain; in an instant, Heaven and Earth darkened, and the moon’s light vanished. Alarmed, the Immortal Maiden thought, “This wind roars like a fierce tiger—could it be some new arrival from outside? If not, why have I never heard it before? Nor has the Earth Deity mentioned it.” Drawing her sword, she peered about the mountain front and back, but saw no sign of movement. Her heart filled with suspicion. Being meticulous by nature, once doubt arose, she would not rest. Moreover, with a heart bent on saving others, she feared that if a fierce beast threatened the villagers below, how could she pursue immortality and the Dao in vain, seeing danger yet doing nothing?

Step by step, she descended the mountain ridge to trace the source of the sound. As she searched, not yet half a li traveled, she heard a low moaning behind her. Pausing to listen, the strange sound vanished again, but a voice called from behind, “Great Aunt, what are you doing here? Is it about that wicked beast?” Startled, the Immortal Maiden turned to see none other than her friend, the Earth Deity. She smiled and said, “Good Earth Deity, what is your office? There is such a monster on the mountain, yet you have no plan to swiftly cut it down and remove it, leaving it here to harm people?”

The Earth Deity laughed, “Ah, Great Aunt, you do not yet know this matter. Do you know what kind of beast this is? Is it like the usual tigers, leopards, jackals, or wolves? Though I am a minor deity charged with guarding this place, I have no talent for exorcising demons, so I cannot handle it. As for you, Great Aunt, though you have mastered three parts of the immortal arts and possess great merit, to cut down this monster you would still need three to five hundred more years of cultivation!” Saying this, she bowed repeatedly and smiled, “I speak in jest—please do not be angry.”

The Immortal Maiden laughed, “You old woman do like to make trouble! What’s monstrous or not? We are all beyond the world, all with hearts to save the world. Whoever has the skill should do their best; if skill is lacking, we can discuss together. We cannot just sit idly by while wicked beasts harm people, pretending nothing is wrong. Responsibility or not, seeing or not, it’s all a joke. Let that be for now; when there is time, we can chat and laugh. But first, tell me, Earth Deity, what kind of beast is this wicked creature? How does it have such power? By your account, it is no mere beast, but a demon of great magical might. Yet I have never heard you mention it before.”

Seeing her earnestness, the Earth Deity felt great respect and took the Immortal Maiden’s hand, leading her into the Earth Deity’s temple nestled in a mountain hollow. The ghost attendants brought tea, and the two sat down. The Immortal Maiden asked again about the matter. The Earth Deity sighed, “Great Aunt, how could you know? Within a thousand-li radius around this mountain, there were only some harmless wild beasts—foxes, badgers, wolves, rabbits—and even tigers and leopards were rare. Demons were unheard of. Yet, within the past three days, a divine ox suddenly appeared. Its body was blue, its horns shining bright. It could change form at will and roared like a tiger, shaking the mountains and causing birds to flee far away. It arrived the night before last and has not returned since yesterday. This afternoon, the family of Wu, a great landholder at the mountain’s foot, came to the temple to burn incense and seek divination. They said the landholder’s wife was suddenly bewitched by a demon, and the landholder himself was carried off by a demon wind. They did not know if he lived or died.”

“I sent the ghost attendants to investigate. They reported back that on that night, the landholder was holding a grand feast with his wife and concubines. Suddenly, a strange wind blew out all the lights. The household women and children were terrified and fled to the back quarters. Wu, being a man of some courage, ordered them to relight the lamps and tidy up. But when the lamps were lit, two figures appeared in the courtyard, both looking exactly like Wu, dressed alike, wrestling fiercely. One claimed the other was a demon impersonator and urged the household to drive it away; the other said the same, accusing the first of being a demon in disguise, plotting mischief, and told them to chase it off. Poor family members were terrified, unable to tell who was the real Wu and who was the demon’s illusion. One true, one false, they fought long and hard, then both said they were exhausted and needed to rest. This made matters worse. Though Wu had many concubines and a wife, none wished to lie with the demon. They agreed to refuse both, hoping to preserve their chastity.”

“Then another gust of strange wind blew out all the lamps again. In the darkness, the demon shouted, ‘Ladies, do not fear. I do not usually sleep with women, but tonight I will leave your husband to enjoy you. I shall return tomorrow to claim him.’ Hearing this, the women rejoiced, believing the demon had some Daoist power and would not be lustful. They thought that since he said he would leave, it must be true, and the one left behind was the real Wu. When the wind died down, the lamps were lit again, and only one Wu remained, looking weary and dejected, sitting in the room. When asked if he felt unwell, he only shook his head, saying ‘tiring, tiring,’ and wished to sleep. The others said nothing.”

“Some doubted, suspecting this Wu was still false and the real landholder’s fate unknown. But most believed this was the true Wu, worn out from hardship. The doubters dared not voice their suspicion, and the believers did not mention it. They helped Wu to his wife’s chamber to sleep. The wife was loyal and had no doubts, tending to him. But at midnight, alas! The landholder was viciously lustful beyond measure. I cannot say more before you, Great Aunt, but many of his wives and concubines suffered greatly. I believe the true Wu was not like this, so they saw through the demon’s deceit.”

“All agreed the landholder must be a demon. Though harmed, they kept silent. The most urgent matter was to find where the true Wu had been taken and if his life was in danger. So, during his midday rest, they held a tearful meeting and sent a request to the temple, asking me to intervene and investigate the demon’s origin and how to expel it. Alas, I am but a minor deity of this mountain, usually only guarding the law and performing routine duties. I have never studied demon-subduing arts.”

“Though I wished to refuse, I could not bear to break their hearts. So I gave them a general divination slip and sent the ghost attendants to investigate. When they returned, they passed by a thousand-person pit behind the mountain—a place where villagers abandoned corpses. There they found a man lying beneath a tree, dazed and stupefied. This place was full of lonely ghosts and heavy yin energy, seldom visited by people. My ghost attendant was clever and thought: how could anyone rest here casually? Moreover, this man’s clothes were fine, unlike a common laborer. Surely this was the true Wu, captured by the demon.”

“They found a wild ghost and questioned it. It said the man had been there since the second gust of strange wind last night, nearly half a day. He looked alive but could not speak or move. If he were a newcomer to our path, his yang energy would be gone. Yet within a hundred paces of him, there seemed to be some warmth, preventing us from approaching. We believe he must be a noble of great status; a commoner, no matter how strong, would not have such aura. This confirms he is indeed the true Wu. Wu is known for his righteousness and leads over a hundred villages around this mountain. For major village matters, no one can oppose his word. His status is like a small king—a great noble indeed. Among these farming villages, who else deserves the title ‘noble’ but Wu?”

“Thus, the ghost attendant was certain, and so am I. We believe this is the true Wu. Just as we planned to send a dream omen to Wu’s wives and concubines that night, a message came from the City God of our district. It said a divine ox had come from the west, confirmed as the mount of a great immortal. Soon an immortal would arrive to subdue it. This creature’s six senses were unclean, its wild nature untamed. Having come to the mortal realm, it would harm the people. The City God ordered all one hundred local Earth Deities to remain vigilant and warn the people wherever the ox appeared, so they might defend themselves and avoid insult or loss of life.”

“Receiving this edict, I was both enlightened and puzzled. How could the City God know the ox was causing trouble but not know which immortal owned it or where its cave abode was? Could it be that even he had taboos preventing him from speaking openly?”

The Immortal Maiden said, “The City God is upright and enfeoffed, but like other honored gods, his duty is to guard the land and protect the people, not to subdue demons. As for divining the future and discerning changes, that is the Great Dao of the Golden Immortals above. Ordinary immortals and gods may not have such skill. Besides, there are many gods in Heaven; it is not easy to investigate all at once. In my view, the City God’s knowledge is already remarkable. As for you and me, we cannot even judge these small matters clearly!”

The Earth Deity nodded, “Exactly so. I had firm convictions and, receiving the decree, personally left the temple to meet with all the Earth Deities of this mountain. We agreed on a way to notify the people. After the meeting, I went to Wu’s house to send a dream omen. Then I went to the thousand-person pit to check on the true Wu. He was still unconscious, leaning against a tree as if in deep sleep. Fearing wild beasts might harm him, I left a ghost attendant to guard him. Fortunately, he remained deeply asleep, so hunger and cold were not immediate concerns. Tomorrow morning, when Wu’s household all dream the same dream, they will come to fetch him. Then my duty will be done, and my conscience at ease.”

The Immortal Maiden pondered and said, “Ghost attendants fear no beasts, but beasts cannot see ghost attendants. Ghosts and wild beasts dwell in different realms. How can they protect this man?”

The Earth Deity laughed, “You have a point. I thought so too. That is why I sent the ghost attendant. Being a ghost himself, he belongs to the same realm as the many fox, rabbit, wild, and resentful ghosts in the pit. Though they cannot resist beasts by strength, they can unite with their ghostly wiles and magic. Together, they blind the beast’s eyes, confuse its mind, and chase it about without ever reaching Wu’s side or leaving the ghost realm. This is what is called the ‘ghostly maze’.”

They laughed heartily. The Immortal Maiden smiled brightly, “So the ‘ghostly maze’ really exists! But I never knew how to overcome it. Now that you explain, I understand. I have heard that those caught in the ghostly maze are burdened with heavy yin and weak yang, their bodies near death, lingering only on residual breath. For the strong and vigorous, the maze has no power. If an adept bites through their tongue and spits blood onto the ghost, the burning pain can destroy the ghost’s form and scatter its soul. Is this true?”

The Earth Deity said, “How could it be false? Didn’t you hear the ghost attendants say those wild ghosts dared not approach Wu because they feared his strong energy? But that applies to humans. Beasts, with weaker spirit and qi, are not feared by ghosts no matter how strong. Besides, the ghost attendant I sent has served in my temple for many years, like a mortal official in an office. His knowledge and skill surpass ordinary people. With him directing, though he cannot fight demons, guarding Wu’s body is more than enough. No need to worry.”

“What puzzles me is that the City God said an immortal would come soon to subdue the demon, yet two days have passed with no sign. Leaving that aside, Wu’s family is already suffering greatly. If no immortal arrives today, when Wu returns home tomorrow, his life will surely be at the demon’s mercy. This worries me deeply. I was just thinking of coming to your cave to discuss a plan, and here you are! Since you are determined to save those in peril, and this matter falls within my domain, you should lend your strength. That would show your compassion and righteousness!”

The Immortal Maiden laughed, “Though you say the divine ox is formidable, I suspect some exaggeration. Before Wu returns home, I will go with you to see it. If we can remove it, so much the better. If it truly has power beyond us, we can retreat without harm. What say you, honored deity?”

The Earth Deity gladly replied, “I shall accompany you.”

The Immortal Maiden said, “Saving people is like putting out a fire—the sooner the better. Since we are going, let us depart at once without delay.”

Following her words, the Earth Deity rose with her on a cloud. In an instant, they arrived at Wu’s household. The Earth Deity pointed and said, “Below is thick black mist and a foul stench. This is Wu’s residence, where the old ox is wreaking havoc!”

The Immortal Maiden looked down and saw a heavy veil of black qi covering a large mansion. The stench was so strong it nearly made her vomit. Quickly, she took a vial of medicine and inhaled some with the Earth Deity, and the smell vanished. She said, “You remain here and watch. I will go investigate.”

The Earth Deity cautioned, “Be careful.”

The Immortal Maiden replied, “Understood,” and leapt down into the courtyard. Inside, she heard music and laughter, men and women carousing and making merry. She knew the old ox was reveling here and her anger flared. Boldly brandishing her treasured sword, she entered the courtyard.

There she saw the false Wu, with two naked women clinging to his arms, drinking and playing in a most lewd manner. Around them, more than ten other naked women moved about, their faces forced into smiles but clearly showing sorrow and anger.

The Immortal Maiden’s fury blazed. She prepared to strike the demon unawares with her sword. But the false Wu had already seen her. Suddenly he laughed heartily, pushed away the women, and, naked, chased after her, shouting, “Beautiful lady, where have you come from? Come drink with me!”

The Immortal Maiden blushed with anger and launched her sword without hesitation, paying no heed to his fate, then turned and fled. Yet the creature was truly formidable. It dodged the sword’s gleam and spat a cloud of blue smoke. As she leapt into the air, the smoke touched her, filling her with a fishy stench. She was struck and fainted, tumbling headlong to the ground.

The false Wu laughed uproariously and called for help to carry the Immortal Maiden inside, saying, “I will have fun with her!”

Whether the Immortal Maiden’s life would be spared or lost remains to be revealed in the next chapter.
