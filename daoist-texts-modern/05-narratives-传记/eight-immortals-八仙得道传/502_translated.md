# Chapter Thirty-Four: The Naked Maidens and the Poisonous Ox Unleashed — The Iron Sand Immortal Method Reveals Its Numinous Power

Now it happened that He Xiangu, having been expelled by the demon with a burst of black smoke, felt a sudden dizziness and fell from the clouds to the earth. In an instant, her human faculties nearly vanished. Yet, as one who had cultivated her body, though she could not withstand the blow and seemed as if dead, when the demon shouted, the gathered women helped her to her feet. As they moved her, the blood and qi coursed anew through her limbs, and immediately her spirit and mind returned. Opening her eyes, she saw the demon standing aside, commanding many women — those very same naked, sorrowful-faced ones she had seen before — carrying her body and moving toward the rear.

The Immortal Maiden only wished to escape that naked demon; life or death mattered little at that moment. She noticed that among those carrying her, some had tears in their eyes, others whispered resentful words. Their voices were so low she could not hear clearly, but she guessed they cursed the demon to a swift death. She could not help but feel a quiet sorrow: “These women still have shame — that is rare indeed.” After they passed behind the main hall, the demon did not follow. This brought her great relief. Smiling, she said to the others, “Sisters, do not fear, do not worry. I have come to save you. I did not expect such cruelty. Your master is now held by the demon three hundred li away, imprisoned in a pit of a thousand souls, guarded by earth spirits and ghost soldiers. You will not suffer loss.”

Hearing this, all were astonished. One braver woman asked who she was, why she came to rescue them, how she knew their master was in the pit of a thousand souls, and how she could speak with the earth spirits. He Xiangu briefly told her own origin. Suddenly, the demon’s shouting came nearer from outside. In haste, the women carried He Xiangu into a delicate little room and laid her on a couch. Fearing the demon’s return, they fled, leaving her alone, no longer attending to her. Afraid the demon might come again to torment her, He Xiangu leapt down from the bed. Seeing a small courtyard outside, she forced her way through a window and rose into the clouds. Searching for the earth spirit, she found it gone.

Hurriedly she flew to the temple and looked down. There, the earth spirit grandmother was facing a ghost soldier, weeping and pleading, recounting her own suffering beneath the divine throne.

He Xiangu’s heart was deeply moved. She lowered her cloud and called out, “Madam Earth Spirit, do not worry for the ancients. Your dear Miss He has returned.” Hearing this and seeing He Xiangu standing before her, graceful and clever, the earth spirit’s sorrow turned to joy. She said, “You, you! You made us all anxious to death, yet you stand here laughing.” He Xiangu smiled and thanked her for her concern, then related the whole affair.

The earth spirit stuck out her tongue and said, “You truly know how to cause trouble. I warned you before — that demon is no ordinary tree spirit or wood monster. It has real magic, beyond our power. Since the City God has decreed, surely a celestial immortal will come to rescue the family. But you, so impatient, insisted on rushing in yourself — no wonder you suffered loss.” He Xiangu smiled and replied, “The path of the cultivator is to aid the world; how can I care for such things? The City God does not say when the immortal will arrive, but Master Wu faces mortal danger now. My plan is to move him secretly to a safe place, so the demon cannot find him and harm him. Otherwise, if the demon suspects I escaped to save Master Wu, would not his life be lost by my hand?” The earth spirit said, “That is not certain. Since you fled, the demon will seek pleasure for itself. How do you know it will look for Master Wu?” He Xiangu laughed, “I hope so. But I prefer caution — better to avoid harming those I wish to save and adding to my sins. You have your duty to guard the land; I have none. I must go see for myself. Whether the demon is there or not, I must move Master Wu to safety.” The earth spirit could not stop her and let her go.

He Xiangu rose into the sky, urged the clouds swiftly, and in no time reached the pit of a thousand souls. A ghost soldier guarding Master Wu hurried to meet her and reported, “The demon came just now and took Master Wu away. If you had come sooner, you might have caught him.” He Xiangu stamped her foot and sighed. She asked where the demon had gone and if he had seen clearly. The ghost soldier said it headed northeast. He Xiangu told him to return and herself flew after the demon toward the northeast.

Crossing two mountain ridges, she saw ahead a mass of black vapor, faint and shifting with the wind. She knew it must be the demon. Because the demon moved slowly, she planned to catch up and stab it with her sword, ending it quickly. But then she thought: the demon must be carrying Master Wu, so if she wounded it, Master Wu might be dropped and lose his life. She had no choice but to press on, shouting, “Demon, stop! Leave Master Wu!” The demon looked back and smiled, “So it’s you again, girl. You escaped me before and spoiled my fun. Now you come running to my door?” Speaking, he descended to a great mountain peak, threw down Master Wu, and waved in the air, calling, “Come, dear sister, come see your brother!”

He Xiangu’s anger flared. She flew to the mountaintop, drew her sword, and attacked the demon. The demon drew his blade and met her. Sword and blade clashed back and forth for dozens of rounds. The demon grew impatient, rolled on the ground, and revealed his true form — a colossal azure ox, massive beyond measure, wielding two great horns, charging fiercely at He Xiangu. Knowing the danger, she tried to flee. The ox’s strength was unmatched; it kicked her with a flying leg. Though she had Daoist arts, the ox’s power was tenfold hers. The kick made her stagger and fall backward.

The ox then shifted into Master Wu’s form, grinning, “Good sister, do not fear. I love your delicate form and fair flesh. Come with me, and we’ll have fun, living carefree days. If you obey me, you’ll know no shame!” Saying this, he seized He Xiangu and flew up on clouds. She knew the pain was from the kick, her strength drained. Grasping her sword, she tried to strike the ox’s vital spots. Looking closely, she realized the ox’s hide was thick as metal and stone, ringing like forged metal when flicked. Her precious sword might not harm him. She realized she was truly at a loss.

Anxious, she summoned all her strength to grab the ox’s horns, pull out hairs, and kick its rump fiercely. But the ox’s power was immense, its hide impervious, as if unaware. Carrying her slowly, it sang filthy village songs.

After struggling, He Xiangu knew she could not match him. Sweat beaded, her heart trembled, and she thought of ending her own life. After a moment of sorrowful tears, she cried out, “Master Xuannü, Senior Brother Iron Crutch, I thank your great kindness in teaching the Dao. Who would have thought before completing the path, my life would be forfeit? Do you know your suffering disciple is in peril here?” After weeping, seeing Master Wu’s home, she drew her sword to slay herself. Suddenly, she recalled, “No, no! I heard that one who seeks death is the most useless. Unless death is at the door, why try it lightly? My purpose is firm; I will risk death to achieve it. Even on this desperate path, I can delay a moment and see how he deals with me.” Thinking thus, the demon reached the courtyard, personally carried her inside, threw her on a bed, and summoned the naked women to guard her. He warned, “This is my beloved beauty; watch her well. If she escapes again, none of you will live.” Saying so, he left, smiling.

The women, seeing He Xiangu captured, wept with tears on their lashes. They said, “We deserve death for this fate. No need to say more. Sister, you escaped with your life, yet fell into his hands like us, suffering his abuse. Is it not painful?” He Xiangu, thinking of escape, could not speak. Soon the demon returned, stripped bare, strode to the bed, and laughed, “Good sister, now we shall have some fun.” Alarmed, He Xiangu pushed the women aside, leapt down, and drew her sword against the demon. The demon, unarmed, spat forth that dreadful blue smoke again. He Xiangu and many women fainted to the ground.

He Xiangu’s spirit was not fully lost. She saw the demon still in human form, smiling as he began to strip her clothes, undoing her sash. Helpless, her body limp, she could only weep dry tears.

In this dire moment, suddenly a thunderclap shattered the sky, shaking the great, sturdy mansion on all sides. Startled, the demon screamed and fled. He Xiangu awoke, rose, and saw the women still dazed, as if dead or mad. She knew the thunder came from nowhere by some Daoist power. She longed to leave, but her compassion held her. Seeing the women so abused, she could not abandon them. The fierce blue smoke made their recovery slow, and she had no means to save them.

As she hesitated, a flash of golden light filled the courtyard, dazzling her eyes. When she could see again, a celestial maiden stood on a red lotus in the center, surrounded by many beautiful attendants, all radiant and elegant. They smiled and called to He Xiangu, “Lanxian, why do you not flee? Are you not afraid of demon’s abuse?” He Xiangu bowed deeply, thanking them for their saving grace, and asked the name of their immortal land. The maiden bade her attendants help her rise and said, “We are fellow disciples, peers all, no need for such ceremony. I am the Lady of the Ninth Heaven’s Upper Origin, also a disciple of Xuannü, your fellow student. By our master’s command, I come because the Old Lord Laozi’s azure ox was released by a boy and has run amok in the mortal realm. Our master knows your compassionate heart, your overestimation of your power, and your reckless deeds. Your sin is grave, yet your heart is commendable. Thus I am sent to rescue you and teach you the method to subdue the demon. Henceforth, focus on your cultivation and avoid worldly affairs, lest demons arise and calamities follow. This time we forgive your first offense without punishment. You may now thank your masters.” He Xiangu was startled and ashamed, knelt, and bowed to the empty sky in gratitude.

The Lady swept her sleeve, and the naked women awoke as from a dream, rising in confusion, staring at the Lady, He Xiangu, and the attendants, unsure what had happened. He Xiangu wished to speak further, but the Lady took her hand. In a flash of golden light, they were outside the courtyard, atop a mountain.

It was He Xiangu’s grotto, right before them. The Lady led her attendants and bade He Xiangu enter first. He Xiangu was deeply grateful and thanked her repeatedly. The Lady smiled and said, “We are sisters on the same path, and by our master’s command, no thanks are needed.” He Xiangu asked about the demon ox. The Lady sighed, “It is a small calamity, unavoidable. This was once the Old Lord Laozi’s mount, guarded by a boy. Before your Senior Brother Iron Crutch became immortal, he suffered from this beast. Later, Master Wenshi personally retrieved it to the mountain, ending Iron Crutch’s misfortune. Then, because the boy neglected his duty, the Old Lord almost punished him, but the brothers interceded. Now, due to a grand Daoist ritual in a sea snail shell, demon cultists took advantage to trouble our sect. Our brothers defeated the demons, but their leader came to the sea bottom, set up a contest, and used spells to trap our brothers. Only the Old Lord’s arrival freed them. The Old Lord stayed five days underwater, leaving the ox behind unused. The boy and others raced the ox, and in anger whipped it. The ox bore a grudge, and when the boy was tired, it slipped away to the mortal world. This happened three days ago, which is several months below. The ox has rampaged widely. The Eastern Emperor and Great Emperor Perfected Martial sent forces to drive it here. Master Wu was especially afflicted because in a past life he was a butcher and now loves beef, so his suffering is greater. The Old Lord has now demoted the boy and sent a mature replacement to retrieve the ox. Soon he will come. Moreover, our master says: ‘All who cultivate immortality must establish merit and virtue as the sole foundation.’ Though your actions were reckless, your heart was right. After you subdue this beast, learn protective arts. In ten years, you may go down the mountain to help the people. Then the master will surely give further instruction. Just cultivate carefully and await his command.”

He Xiangu agreed to all. The Lady took out a tiny grain of iron sand, no bigger than a mustard seed, and said, “Our master commands you to carry this sand. When you meet the demon ox in battle, throw it into the earth. It will surely work wonders. Be careful not to misuse it. I cannot go with you; I will wait here.” He Xiangu accepted the iron sand but wondered how such a tiny thing could subdue the mighty ox. The Lady said no more and departed. He Xiangu, troubled, left and returned to Master Wu’s home.

Before she descended, she heard cries and wails. Looking down, she saw many naked women tied high on pillars, the demon whipping each with instruments. She knew this was punishment for their aiding her escape. Filled with pity, she swiftly descended and stood outside the courtyard, hand on her precious sword, shouting, “Wicked beast, how dare you be so rude? Taste my sword!” She flung a sword strike, but the demon, unarmed, grabbed a large stone block from the yard to meet it. The sword cut the block in two; half fell to the ground, half remained in the demon’s hand.

Furious, the demon prepared to unleash magic. Suddenly, the iron sand flew from He Xiangu’s hand and fell to the earth. Surprised, she cried out and bent to pick it up. Looking down, she saw the ground sprout a patch of sand and mud, growing deeper, wider, and broader. In moments, the demon’s feet were trapped in the sand. He called out like thunder, lifting one foot only to have the other sink. As one foot tried to rise, the other sank deeper. He Xiangu realized the immortal treasure’s wondrous power. Hovering in the air, sword pointed at the demon, she commanded, “You demon ox, once the Old Lord Laozi’s mount, no ordinary beast enjoys such fortune. Even mortal kings and nobles who seek your longevity only dream of your freedom. Your exalted place comes from the Old Lord’s great grace and your own deep roots and long merit. You should ascend step by step, seek higher realms, and join the ranks of immortals. Why degrade yourself by fleeing to the mortal world and harming people? Because of your failures, the Old Lord has demoted your guardian boy to the mortal realm. How can your heart be at peace? That great thunderbolt just now could have struck you dead. Do you know how it came? It was sent by Lady Xuannü, who dispatched the Lady of the Upper Origin to save me and warn you. Because you are the Old Lord’s mount, none would harm you utterly. Otherwise, your hundred lives would have ended long ago. Do you understand?” The demon, realizing resistance was futile, lost all anger and pride. Standing trapped in the sand, it wept and begged forgiveness, confessing guilt and pleading mercy. He Xiangu pointed and said, “Stop.” The sand ceased rising, burying half the demon’s body, immobilizing it.

This was He Xiangu’s compassion for the demon ox, hastily tested and found to respond to human will. She rejoiced and said, “Enough talk. This single grain of divine sand can bury you for three years or five, to see if you can save yourself. I spare your life not for your pleas but for the Old Lord’s sake. Know this: away from the Old Lord, you face death everywhere. If you repent and behave, your future is boundless. Benefit or harm depends on you. Since you understand spirit and change, know right from wrong, think quickly! I must leave now. Endure a while longer buried in earth. You have feasted well these days; stay a few more. Soon your new master will come for you.”

She looked at the women, still tied to pillars, not buried. With a gesture, their ropes fell away. He Xiangu led them to a back room, clothed them, and told them all that had happened and her own story. She bade them look to the sky and thank Lady Xuannü and the Lady of the Upper Origin for their rescue. The women bowed and thanked He Xiangu. She smiled and said, “Master Wu is now somewhere in the mountains. I have sent the earth spirit to rescue him; do not worry. Though we suffered loss and shame, life is safe. The root of this calamity is his love of beef. In the future, it is best to kill less, and boundless merit will come.”

Having said this, she took her leave. From afar came the demon ox’s mournful cries. He Xiangu wept and sighed, “When I came, I heard the women’s weeping; now I hear his lament. Retribution is swifter than thunder and lightning. The world does not understand and recklessly commits violence. Is it not pitiful and lamentable?”

On her way, she saw a white cloud from the west, carrying a boy dressed as a herdsman flying swiftly. She knew he was sent by the Old Lord Laozi to retrieve the demon ox. She stopped and watched him land in Master Wu’s courtyard. Only then did she relax and return to her own grotto.

How He Xiangu sent Master Wu back safely remains to be told in the next chapter.
