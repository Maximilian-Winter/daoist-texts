# Chapter Thirty-Five: Immortal Maiden He Receives the Mandate to Enter the World; Young Lord Zhao Gathers Rogues to Court Women

Now it happened that Immortal Maiden He returned to her cavern, reporting the matter of subduing the divine ox to Lady Shangyuan. The lady smiled and said, “Heartfelt congratulations! Though this is but a small matter, it counts as our junior sister’s first merit since leaving the mountain.” Immortal Maiden He smiled in thanks, replying, “Had it not been for the gracious aid of Master and elder sisters, this one life would long ago have returned to the Underworld; what merit could there be?” They shared a laugh together.

Then Immortal Maiden He first went to the Earth Deity’s temple, instructing the Earth Deity to dispatch ghostly soldiers to escort Master Wu back home. She also gave Master Wu a single pill of elixir, ordering him to swallow it to restore soul and strengthen body. The Earth Deity took the mandate and went to carry out the task.

Returning to her cavern, Immortal Maiden He received many protective methods from Lady Shangyuan. Being supremely clever, she grasped them at once and committed them to memory after a single lesson. The lady rejoiced, saying, “Virtuous sister, your spiritual insight is so keen, the time to realize the Dao is not far off. This humble sister awaits your imminent exaltation in the Celestial Bureau.” Immortal Maiden He bowed in gratitude.

Lady Shangyuan then sent a maid to retrieve the iron sand from the Wu household. Seeing how Immortal Maiden He praised this iron sand repeatedly, she generously bestowed it upon her: “If you ever encounter fierce demons, you may use this to subdue them.” Immortal Maiden He was overjoyed and inquired the name of this sand. The lady replied, “As for the sand’s nature, it is truly laughable—just ordinary iron sand as commonly seen. Only after my refining has it gained these slight changes. In truth, it holds no real value.” Immortal Maiden He laughed, “Celestial treasures are often deemed worthless; if all were appraised by market value as you say, they would become mere wares on a secondhand stall.” Lady Shangyuan smiled faintly, then gave a few final instructions before taking her leave.

After seeing Lady Shangyuan off, Immortal Maiden He continued cultivating in her cavern. She practiced the various spells and methods imparted by the lady until thoroughly proficient. In the blink of an eye, ten years passed. Then, Mysterious Lady descended with Lady Shangyuan and several disciples to the stone chamber, imparting many transformation techniques which Immortal Maiden He readily comprehended.

Mysterious Lady instructed, “You may now descend the mountain. The current age is the Qin dynasty, where Emperor Ying Zheng rules with great cruelty. Soon, the realm will be troubled by rising warlords; the imperial throne will pass to the Liu clan. The true destined Son of Heaven has already appeared in Pei County. Your senior brothers Li Tieguai, Zhang Guo, and others have been sent by the Master to descend and relieve suffering, enlightening those with affinity. One among them has been exiled to the mortal world and will also attain true realization. On this journey you shall meet them all. Many matters await your hand to fulfill; you must apply your heart and not be negligent, nor should you be fearful. Your own merit and future depend greatly on this; you must be especially vigilant.” Immortal Maiden He accepted these commands one by one.

Mysterious Lady bestowed upon her ten cinnabar pills, capable of restoring life and reversing death; a jade bottle to contain human souls; and a golden needle that could instantly multiply into thousands, able to pierce one’s eyes. She earnestly cautioned, “Of these three treasures, only the cinnabar pills are immortal elixirs to save lives. When encountering those with affinity, gravely ill, severely wounded, or even dead for three days—so long as the body remains uncorrupted—just half a pill taken will immediately revive the soul, dispel illness, and heal wounds. A further half pill restores full health. Yet these pills cannot be given to all; one must understand that each person’s lifespan is fixed. Only those with great dark virtue and grand merit among good men and women may receive them; no exceptions. As the saying goes, when the King of Hell decrees death at the third watch, no one can delay it to the fifth. I do not speak this solely of the cinnabar pills, but to teach you that in doing good and saving lives, one must first discern whether the person is truly meant to be saved, and if saving them does not contravene Heaven’s will. Thus, the words ‘doing good’ are not so simple! Otherwise, in this vast world, with so many dying each day, even if you had boundless compassion, how could you aid all and extend their lives? Moreover, where would you find so many life-restoring cinnabar pills?”

Immortal Maiden He listened and found these words beyond her usual thoughts. She understood Mysterious Lady’s intent: her own heart was warm and compassionate, often acting without weighing facts or consequences, moved only by sudden pity, even at the cost of her own happiness to rescue others—as in the recent Wu household incident, precisely the kind of case Lady Shangyuan had warned against. Mysterious Lady’s teaching was a fitting remedy, using the example of the cinnabar pills as a veiled caution.

Lady Shangyuan stood nearby, smiling quietly upon hearing this. Immortal Maiden He felt even more certain that Mysterious Lady’s words were purposeful and solemn. She bowed with sound and said softly, “Master’s commands, your disciple dares not disobey or forget. This journey down the mountain shall be undertaken with utmost care and mindfulness, keeping these instructions ever in heart. Not only will I never act rashly in wicked deeds, but even when doing good to help others, I will be prudent and cautious. My merit is shallow; I cannot judge who should be aided or not, who deserves saving or not. Yet I will rely on my own conscience, guided by Heaven’s principle and human feeling, acting neither too close nor too distant, neither humble nor arrogant. I trust Master will approve of my efforts.”

Mysterious Lady smiled with delight, “Very good. My duties keep me busy, so I cannot always descend to instruct you. But in critical moments, I shall foresee events and send your senior brothers to guide you. You need not worry.” Then she resumed, “The purpose of the cinnabar pills is solely to save lives. If one saves improperly, though Heaven may punish, Heaven’s heart is most merciful. For all acts of kindness, even if there is penalty, it will not be severe. As for the bottle and needle, these are weapons of harm and killing. Regardless of right or wrong, when you use them, your mind must already harbor the intent to kill or harm—fear that the other cannot escape your blow. Such thoughts are called evil. We Dao cultivators base ourselves on saving the world and relieving suffering. If, for the sake of protecting the good, one must first eliminate evil, though meritorious, one’s conscience must bear the blame. Worse still if one acts rashly, harming or maiming even upright gentlemen; then the guilt is beyond words, truly a case where good cannot offset evil. Once Heaven’s punishment falls, even I cannot save you. Is that not dreadful?

Therefore, such items should be kept unused and deeply hidden. Only when absolutely necessary—when you will surely be harmed if you do not act, and life or death hangs in the balance—may you employ them. Yet even then, your heart must hold the resolve to let go, to resolve grudges and avoid enmity. Leaving some margin is also a way to accumulate virtue.

If you encounter Dao practitioners or demons who have reached a certain stage, many have labored long and hard; you must consider that reaching such a level is no easy matter. If possible, do not kill them; instead, gently guide them to the right path or take them as disciples. This is not impossible. But one word of warning: accepting disciples and transmitting the Dao is extremely dangerous. The master bears responsibility for the disciple’s conduct and intentions, whether good or evil. This is not something to be done lightly. You must pay close heed to this.”

These words startled Immortal Maiden He deeply. She prostrated herself and said, “I am young and inexperienced, knowing nothing of the world. Receiving Master’s great compassion and earnest guidance, I now see that beyond personal austerities, the path of cultivation is fraught with dangers and terrors. This makes me tremble with caution, forbidding myself from reckless speech or action that might bring disaster upon myself.”

Mysterious Lady bade her rise, smiling to comfort her: “The first rule for cultivators is boldness. The timid fail to do evil but also cannot accomplish good. We stand beyond Heaven and Earth, bearing the duties of the world upon our shoulders. To be timid is to be a coward, unworthy of a cultivator’s path. In all, be prudent; especially when employing spells, be exceedingly careful. But prudence is not fearfulness. You are clever—what could you not understand? Yet since this is your first descent, you have never handled great matters, nor experienced the many cunning deceptions of the mortal world. How could you fully perceive them? A single slip could lead to being deceived. Thus I warn you again and again, with utmost seriousness and care. Since you understand, I hope you will put these words into practice, not merely speak or think well but forget when acting—that would be a grave loss.” Mysterious Lady spoke, and Immortal Maiden He responded in turn. When finished, Immortal Maiden He respectfully kowtowed several times. Then Mysterious Lady and her attendants departed.

Because Immortal Maiden He was well acquainted with the Earth Deity and had received much care over the years, she went personally to bid farewell. The Earth Deity, hearing of her impending journey, was deeply attached. Immortal Maiden He comforted him, then took the treasures given by Mysterious Lady. Dressed as a Daoist maiden, all in white from head to toe, she appeared pure and elegant, incomparable to any worldly beauty.

Back in her cavern, she sealed it with talismans and incantations, then mounted a cloud and rose. Remembering that her Master said the current emperor, named Ying Zheng, was cruel and heartless, oppressing the people, she resolved to see for herself what manner of tyrant he was. Among the oppressed, if she found those with affinity, to save even a few would be a great merit.

Having made up her mind, she formed a hand seal and summoned an Earth Deity, asking where the emperor’s capital was, the route, and how to proceed. By chance, an ancient Earth Deity with knowledge of the rise and fall of dynasties appeared. Seeing Immortal Maiden He’s request, he did not hesitate to recount a long tale of former and latter dynasties. She listened with great interest, hearing much she had never known. The Earth Deity then gave detailed directions and the path to Xianyang.

Immortal Maiden He thanked him repeatedly, then parted. A swift cloud carried her to Xianyang. She chose a bustling district to descend, but fearing attention, first transformed into a tiny flying insect. Flying down unseen, she then reverted to her true form.

It was just noon, early spring, with clear skies, neither cold nor hot—the best time for human joy and the beginning of all trades. Immortal Maiden He walked the city streets several times. Observing shopkeepers and passersby buying and selling, public and private dealings, every face bore sorrow and furrowed brows, as if burdened with secret troubles. She sighed, “They say a wise ruler and good ministers bring peace to the people. Now, with a tyrant, the people naturally suffer. How could they be joyful?”

She wandered to a quiet lane, finding a temple exquisitely built. It was one of many Daoist monasteries erected by the First Emperor, seeking to meet immortals. Inside, an elderly Daoist came forth to greet her. Immortal Maiden He explained she wished to lodge there. The old Daoist, seeing her beauty, scrutinized her up and down, seeming somewhat doubtful.

She smiled, “Daoist brother, do you suspect I am not a good person?” The old Daoist hastened to smile, “Not at all. It’s just that you are young and beautiful, the prime time to enjoy worldly blessings. Why choose this path beyond the world? I do not meddle, but there are reasons I must explain, lest trouble arise.” Immortal Maiden He was puzzled, “Each has their own will; no one can force another. Do you mean that a young, beautiful woman is destined to enjoy worldly blessings and cannot leave the world to cultivate the Dao? That would be unreasonable.”

The old Daoist laughed, “Ah, you have not yet grasped my meaning. Since you have come to our humble temple and have not eaten, please enter the guest hall for refreshments. I will explain my difficulties so you understand my good intentions in not detaining you.” Curious, Immortal Maiden He followed him to a small guest room.

The old Daoist said, “This place is called Qingxu Temple. I am the steward here. The temple has over ten masters, some deeply versed in Daoist arts, including one surnamed Fei, named Changfang, a true disciple of celestial immortals with especially profound power. These masters reside here, supported by the palace. The temple was built less than three years ago. The first two years were peaceful, but this year, early in the first month, the son of Lord Zhao, relying on his father’s power, learned that many noble young ladies come here to offer incense. He often leads a band of green-skinned ruffians and rogue youths, claiming to seek immortals. When they see a beautiful woman, regardless of background, a secret signal is given and they seize her. Sometimes they follow her out to plan an ambush. In short, any good girl they see, unless she escapes their eyes, none avoid their schemes. Some, fearing death or craving fame, comply and gain some benefit for a few days, then are discarded. Others, noble ladies unwilling to lose their chastity, are beaten until their bodies are bruised, sometimes endangering their entire families. This month alone, six or seven such incidents have occurred. Seeing your beauty, like a heavenly immortal, and your youthful prime, I say that none of the previous victims compare to you. Yet they fell prey; how much more might you? I speak frankly: that Young Lord Zhao is the son of the current emperor’s minister Zhao, called ‘the standing prime minister, the forbidden noble son.’ Does anyone in the world wield such power? Many noble ladies and wealthy matriarchs have been ensnared. You are a Daoist maiden like us; how could you speak of power? So I think it best you stay here. You will not suffer much, but when Young Lord Zhao arrives, your cultivated body and chastity may not be safe. Is that not fearful? Is it not a pity? Please consider carefully. I am ninety years old and never lie; please do not doubt me.”

Immortal Maiden He appreciated his kindness but was determined to investigate the tyrannical deeds of the Qin emperor and his ministers, so as to save and relieve suffering. Such a villain, long sought but not found, could not be abandoned. She smiled and thanked him, “Your kindness is clear. I am no plant or stone; I know gratitude and would not wrongly suspect. But to be frank, I met a stranger in youth who taught me minor Daoist arts. Though I cannot harm others, I have some confidence in preserving my life and protecting my body. Please assign me a small room to rest. If Young Lord Zhao comes, and I can avoid him, that is best. If he sees me, I have means to make him retreat. I do not wish to start conflict or harm him, nor trouble your temple or you.”

The old Daoist was stunned, then looked her over again and suddenly brightened. “You have a refined face, unlike ordinary people, and such beauty! At ninety, this is my first time seeing such a countenance. I suspect you are a true celestial immortal descended to play among mortals. If so, forget Young Lord Zhao and his childish tricks. Even now, Qin—” At the word “Qin,” he abruptly stopped, glanced around to ensure no one was near, spat, and laughed, “What time is this? What place? At my age, I talk too much. If I cause trouble tomorrow, I fear this true immortal before me might not come to save me!” Then his dark, wrinkled face shifted from black to blue to purple, taking on an oddly coquettish expression. Turning sideways, he smiled at Immortal Maiden He, “Is that so, Daoist friend?”

She could not help but laugh heartily at his sudden shifts—from talkative to self-reproach to this strange pose. Seeing he would say no more, she knew the capital was tightly controlled, with spies everywhere, making people fearful. She recalled the ancient saying, “To guard against the people’s speech is more severe than guarding against floods,” and sighed.

The old Daoist ceased his chatter and summoned a servant, ordering him to escort Immortal Maiden He to a side chamber in the west wing. He told her to ask the servant for anything she might need. Immortal Maiden He thanked him repeatedly and followed the servant westward. As she walked, she pondered the masters in the temple said to be accomplished in Daoist arts. She wondered who they were and what powers they held. If their arts were profound, she might seek them out for instruction—a fine opportunity on this journey.

Lost in thought, she suddenly heard the sound of men laughing and chasing behind her. Turning, she saw—oh no!—the very band the old Daoist had warned about: Young Lord Zhao and his gang of lackeys. They had just arrived at the temple gate. Several flattering Daoists greeted them, boasting of a newly arrived peerless Daoist maiden, describing her beauty, figure, and flawless complexion as a rare treasure of Heaven and Earth, surpassing any beauties Young Lord Zhao had ever had. The old Daoist was escorting Immortal Maiden He to the guest hall, promising the lord he would soon see her.

The lord was delighted and hurried like a bird to the guest hall, just as the old Daoist was supervising servants preparing the rooms. Upon entering, the lord found no sign of the famed beauty. Among his lackeys was one named Wei Yingqin, who, before the lord could speak, grabbed the old Daoist’s Daoist cap and tugged his robe collar, shouting, “You old fool, where did you hide our lord’s heavenly beauty?”

The old Daoist, startled from his work, jumped back and turned with a smiling face, bowing deeply and saying, “Are you asking about the Daoist maiden who just came to the temple?” The lord and his men laughed and clapped. The lord, suppressing laughter, said, “That’s right. Didn’t you bring her in? With such a treasure, why not send word to your lord? Why must I come in person to investigate? Where have you hidden her? You deserve a beating!” The old Daoist stuck out his tongue and laughed, “You speak lightly. I am over ninety; my legs won’t carry me to do your dirty work. I planned to keep her here, prepare her room, and then report to the mansion. But with your great fortune, you surely had ears everywhere and came rushing here. Such swift methods leave this old fool no chance!”

This made the lord laugh heartily. He ordered Wei Yingqin to release the old man: “This Daoist is a good man. Don’t play tricks on him. At his age, your scare might give him a stroke. If there’s a murder case, my lord won’t get involved.” The gang laughed, and old Wei pouted, muttering but gave up.

The old Daoist then sent someone to accompany the lord and his men to find the new celestial beauty. Hearing “celestial beauty,” the lord chuckled, “Look at this old relic, over ninety and still so lively.” Saying no more, he led his men in a rush westward, chasing after Immortal Maiden He.

Immortal Maiden He, thoughtful yet curious to see the temple’s sights, did not expect to encounter this very enemy. As she strolled leisurely, a whistle sounded. The gang swarmed around her, circling front, back, and sides, forming a tight ring. Though skilled in Daoist arts and brave, the sudden violence startled her.

How Immortal Maiden He fared in this predicament—see the next chapter for the unfolding tale.
