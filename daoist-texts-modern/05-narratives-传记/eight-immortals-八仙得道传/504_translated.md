# Chapter Thirty-Six: The Immortal Maiden and the Noble Youth Insulted; The Loyal Adopted Son’s Plea to the Eunuch Lord

Now, it happened that the Immortal Maiden He found herself surrounded on all sides by a band of ruffians and scoundrels under the command of Young Master Zhao. She cried out, “Immortal, please stay your steps! My young master requests a word.” But the Immortal Maiden, already knowing the scheme, stood firm and composed, smiling gently as she asked, “Pray, from whence do you all come? And who is this young master of yours? I, a humble Daoist beyond the world’s dust, have long dwelled in deep mountains studying the dao, never mingling or trading words with outsiders. Yet I know not why your young master summons me?”

Just then, Young Master Zhao hurried forward, parting the crowd, and with a sweeping bow, pressed his forehead to the ground before the Immortal Maiden. She could do no more than smile and return the courtesy. The young master spoke, “For long I have admired the fair grace and radiant beauty of Sister Immortal. Such a wondrous age you enjoy, surely a time for delight and blessing. Yet why do you hide away in this Daoist temple, mingling with those wild, rustic daos? Like a flawless white jade buried in dog dung—what a pity!”

The Immortal Maiden laughed so heartily she nearly fell, then composed herself and asked, “According to your young master’s view, what ought to be done?”

The young master smiled and said, “Sister Immortal, do you not yet grasp my meaning? I am none other than the son of the powerful Eunuch Zhao, who serves close to the Emperor himself.”

Before he finished, the Immortal Maiden interrupted with a smile, “How can the Emperor have eunuchs? Is he not the Emperor’s own uncle?”

Hearing this, Young Master Zhao’s face flushed red, and he replied with a laugh, “These matters, Sister Immortal, you do not understand well. I will speak plainly. My family is the most powerful and wealthy within the capital and beyond. For all matters of life—clothing, food, shelter, and amusement—our household is the most refined, second only to the Emperor’s own. My view is this: Sister Immortal, with your heavenly beauty, you are like a celestial being. A wild mountain hermitage is no place for such a precious flower, nor is this Daoist temple fit to hold your proud form.”

The Immortal Maiden would not wait for him to finish, but continued, “Indeed, I grasp your meaning. By your reckoning, it is to flaunt your family’s prestige. And surely a beauty like me should move to your mansion, so as not to slight my own appearance. Is that not so?”

The young master, delighted, gestured excitedly and agreed, “Exactly so, exactly so. Sister Immortal, a figure like a celestial being, how could any garden or mansion but ours be worthy of your residence? Moreover, for all your embroidered silks and brocades, your delicacies and rare treats, every one is prepared perfectly. Just say the word ‘want,’ and immediately it will be brought before you to enjoy. Such grandeur, where else but in my family could you find it? Yet none but Sister Immortal deserves such blessings. You are wise; consider: is it better to dwell among these lowly Daoists in the temple, or to return with me and enjoy a life of wealth and ease?”

Without hesitation, the Immortal Maiden smiled brightly and said, “If your family truly has such blessings, even if you did not invite me, I would seek them out myself. And now that such a young master as you—so close to the Emperor’s eunuch—has come to invite me, I would be truly ungrateful not to spend a few days with you!” Turning about, she beckoned the young master, “Come along!”

The young master, seeing her words both sincere and teasing, her manner both carefree and unpredictable, found himself at a loss. He could not tell if she meant to comply or resist. Yet, as she was but a lone woman and he commanded many followers and a grand house, once within his mansion, how could she spread wings and fly away? Seeing her wave repeatedly, he followed after her.

The Immortal Maiden laughed and pointed at the crowd, “What sort of creatures are these? Their presence alone vexes me. Would it not be better to leave them waiting here?” The young master hesitated. But when the Immortal Maiden gestured, each of the men froze, eyes wide, unable to move a step.

The young master did not perceive this magic and said, “These men are here to protect you and me. Why do you dislike them?” The Immortal Maiden said nothing, only lightly tapped his shoulder and said, “Let us go.” The young master, as if entranced, obediently followed behind her, hastening out the door.

Within the temple courtyard, a group of Daoists were gathered, whispering among themselves about the Immortal Maiden’s encounter with the young master. “If she is sensible, she might become a ready-made young mistress; if she resists stubbornly, her life will turn through ten reincarnations, and no one will rise to plead her cause.”

Others said, “What girl is not fond of romance and wealth? This Daoist maiden must have suffered great loss to have taken the vows. Surely her heart desires this. With such an opportunity, why put on airs?” The Immortal Maiden, hearing these words as she emerged with the young master, could not help but smile. She thought to punish these spiteful tongues with a small spell, when suddenly a Daoist approached. Seeing her pinch her fingers and chant, as if casting a spell, the Daoist smiled faintly, opened his mouth wide, and blew gently toward those she had targeted. At once, the Immortal Maiden’s magic lost its power.

Alarmed, she bowed to the Daoist. He returned the bow and said, “Why contend with these ignorant fools? A true cultivator bears great tolerance. Where is there room for resentment? For my part, I will spare them.”

The Immortal Maiden wished to explain the matter but, with Young Master Zhao behind her, her movements were hindered. She nodded and said, “I will tell you in time,” then departed. The young master followed her like a daze.

The Daoist clapped his hands and laughed in the courtyard, “Good, good, good! Today this fellow has met his match. He has suffered a great loss.” The Immortal Maiden smiled back, admiring his high Dao and hoping for his aid. The Daoist nodded silently with a smile.

Leaving the temple, the Immortal Maiden pushed the young master forward and scolded, “Why do you not lead? Must I go ahead and open the way for you?” The young master said nothing, hurried on toward his mansion.

Though the distance was great, the Immortal Maiden felt her feet light as clouds, floating as if riding the wind. In a blink, she vanished from sight. She exclaimed, “Is this not the Immortal art of shrinking the earth? My master and elder sisters possess this skill. They are far away and cannot come to aid me. Could it be that Daoist’s doing? He seems upright and no rogue sorcerer. To accept some help from him is not unwelcome.” With that, she arrived at the gates of the Zhao residence.

Young Master Zhao did not look back but rushed inside. The guards stood at attention as the Immortal Maiden followed. Seeing the young master ignore her, they suspected they had not come together. Yet knowing his temper, if he had summoned her, they dared not block her, fearing his wrath. So they said nothing and led them through many courtyards to a large hall—the audience chamber of Zhao Gao.

The Immortal Maiden tugged the young master’s sleeve and said, “Stop.” He halted. Servants and maids came in from outside and inside, surrounding the young master, asking why he did not enter the inner chambers. Seeing the Immortal Maiden, they murmured admiration, calling her a celestial fairy brought home by the young master.

Yet the young master stood dumb, drooling, eyes rolling white, as if possessed by some evil spirit. The crowd sensed something amiss and stared at the Immortal Maiden, puzzled.

She smiled and said, “You likely do not know me. I am a Daoist who has taken vows, never knowing what it means to enjoy blessings or to seek wealth and honor. I do not understand the taste of fine food or beautiful clothes. Yet your young master esteems me, inviting me to your home to enjoy the finest delicacies and luxuries under heaven, blessings unmatched on earth. How could I refuse? I thought he would keep his promise and show me these blessings, so that I, who never enjoy fortune, might taste what I have never known. I was even hurrying to Mount Hua to meet a Daoist friend and could not delay. But all the way here, he has been a fool—no greeting, no word—making me embarrassed and unable to leave him alone. So I have come along, hoping he will soon produce those promised blessings. But look at him—dumb as a wooden statue, like a dead pig or dog. When will he ever deliver the gifts he promised? Could it be that such a young master would promise gifts and then deny them without turning back?” She laughed and mocked the crowd.

Those who were sharp realized the Immortal Maiden must have some magic. Surely the young master had offended her, and she had cast a spell to bewilder his soul, following to exact revenge.

As they whispered, a man came running, sweating profusely. He was an assistant officer who usually accompanied the young master on errands but had stayed behind that day. He had heard that the young master’s party was pinned down by a female Daoist’s magic in the temple, unable to move or speak, and that she had brought the young master to the mansion. He hurried to report this.

Upon seeing the scene, he shouted, “Why do you not report to the master and seize this witch? The young master has fallen under her spell!” He recounted all he knew.

Some clever women hurried to notify the master inside. The Immortal Maiden acted as if unconcerned, pacing the hall with a faint smile, nodding to the assistant officer. The rough man, eager to win favor, shouted, “Brothers, come! Let us seize this sorceress and gain the master’s favor!”

Hearing this, and seeing the Immortal Maiden’s calm, the crowd doubted her power and rushed forward to attack. The Immortal Maiden laughed, swirling her feather whisk in all directions. Suddenly, all around appeared figures of Young Master Zhao, each waving a hand at the attackers. When they sought the Immortal Maiden, only laughter was heard; no form appeared.

Fearing harm to the young master, none dared strike. They shouted and raged, unsure if any of the many figures was the real young master. If so, their wild assault might kill him. So they held back and watched.

Soon a nobleman returned to the mansion. The crowd hurried out to greet him, then bustled back in with a tall, elderly white-faced man, beardless, amid clamoring and noise. The Immortal Maiden pointed and drove the many young masters forward, then hid herself and commanded, “Kneel!” The young masters all fell prostrate.

She then commanded, “Why do you not call me ‘Grandfather’?” They all cried out “Grandfather!” The sound shook the hall like the roar of ten thousand armies on a battlefield.

This spectacle both frightened and troubled Zhao Gao. The servants and women laughed heartily. Unable to deal with the Immortal Maiden and unable to distinguish the true young master, Zhao Gao’s shame and anger burst forth, and he cursed the servants fiercely.

Poor souls, they had come to please but only earned abuse.

The hall was packed with kneeling young masters, with the crowd squeezed in between, making the chamber unbearably crowded. Zhao Gao sought a path to the inner room, but wherever he stepped, another young master blocked him, kneeling and unmoving. After ten attempts, ten more young masters appeared, blocking his way. Frightened and at a loss, Zhao Gao retreated, exited the hall, and mounted his sedan chair to hurry back to court.

At the palace gate, as head eunuch and favored by the Emperor, he passed without hindrance. Learning the Emperor was in the Western Palace with the Empress, he hastened there, falling to his knees and bowing deeply, tears streaming like rain, crying out, “Your Majesty, save me! Save my entire household!”

The Emperor was then discussing ancient and divine matters with the Empress. He said, “I, as Son of Heaven, ruler of the vast realms, wonder why my blessings fall short of an immortal’s. Immortals live forever, yet though I am nobler in rank, when my time comes I must still relinquish life. Reflecting on my years of war and hardship, pacifying calamities, it has not been easy. If one enjoys blessings, the noble must return to Heaven—what a sorrowful and grievous thing!”

The Empress asked, “Last time Your Majesty sent Xu Fu with boys and girls across the sea to Penglai to seek the secret of immortality. Why has he not returned?”

The Emperor shook his head, “Xu Fu is loyal and honest. I entrusted him with this great task, trusting it would not fail. But the sea is unlike the land; the days cannot be predicted. Storms and waves often rise, and when the time comes, ships cannot sail and must anchor until fair weather returns. Now is autumn, the most uncertain season. Such delays are inevitable. Moreover, where Penglai lies is only recorded in books; no one has truly been there. Xu Fu was given five years to succeed. Though the time seems long, such a venture is no easy matter. If the elixir exists, a delay is no harm.”

Before the Empress could reply, Zhao Gao burst into the palace, startling both Emperor and Empress. They asked, “What troubles you? Speak quickly, and I will resolve it.”

Zhao Gao wept, “Your Majesty and Empress, I am deeply favored and have no troubles. Yet today, upon returning home, a female demon appeared, humiliating my adopted son and many attendants. This is a loss I have never suffered before. As a minister, the state’s order is at stake. If such a demon dares to insult me within the imperial carriage or my gates, it is not only an affront to me but a defiance of the state’s laws and the court’s dignity. I have thought deeply: as ruler of the four seas, with authority over yin and yang and the Three Realms, Your Majesty must pity your servant’s unjust suffering, uphold the dignity of the law, and personally come to my residence. Though there be demons, they will surely hide. My family will be fortunate, and all under heaven will share Your Majesty’s favor.”

Having reported, Zhao Gao glanced at the Emperor’s expression. But instead of fear, the Emperor laughed heartily and spoke words most unexpected.

To learn what he said, we must await the next chapter’s unfolding.
