# Chapter Thirty-Seven: The Immortal Maiden Rebukes the Tyrant, Inspires Good Thoughts; The Young Master Battles the Great Leopard with Twin Fists

Now, it happened that the First Emperor, upon hearing that Zhao Gao’s household had discovered a strange being, was not alarmed but rather pleased. He hastily said, “You may rise. I have been pondering: beneath the imperial chariot’s wheels, within the capital city itself, with my own person present, how could there be such a bold strange being daring to appear in broad daylight? Surely this must be someone from your household who has offended a true immortal, causing her to descend to the mansion, displaying a hint of punishment—that much must be true. I am presently seeking immortality and the dao; since a true immortal is here, surely she does not forsake me. Perhaps she wishes to see me but lacks the opportunity to approach the throne, so she deliberately manifests her numinous signs near a minister’s home, hoping I might come in person to meet her. This is not impossible.” Zhao Gao, hearing the emperor’s reasoning, was truly taken aback, but being a man of great cunning, he knew well that with the emperor’s fixed view, there was no turning back. Moreover, if he could use this chance to introduce the immortal, he would not return empty-handed. So he immediately changed his expression, bowed deeply, and said, “Your servant was indeed foolish and ignorant, momentarily bewitched by the immortal, confused and mistaken, thinking her a strange demon. Now, reflecting on it, with Your Majesty’s majestic and divine might, wherever the imperial presence is, the moment a strange being appears in the capital, a hundred spirits would immediately drive it away—how could it possibly find shelter? By this reasoning, what my household saw must be a true immortal without doubt. Were it not for Your Majesty’s keen wisdom, how could you have so quickly grasped this truth? Now, I beg Your Majesty to come to my humble residence to summon this immortal, so she may know Your Majesty’s sincere quest for the dao, and early transmit the Golden Elixir’s great path and the wondrous medicine of longevity. I shall first return and tell the immortal, then together receive Your Majesty’s arrival—how does that sound?” The First Emperor was greatly pleased, saying, “Your words align perfectly with my heart. Go quickly, return to your home; I shall come at once.” Thus, Zhao Gao turned anger to joy, worry to delight, and with great satisfaction returned home.

Yet the immortal maiden, because no one in the Zhao household had authority and she was alone mingling with the family’s womenfolk in the great hall, sensed no good reason to stay. She resolved to reprimand the young master and then depart immediately, returning to her borrowed abode at the Pure Emptiness Temple. She then withdrew her numinous power; in an instant, many false young masters vanished without a trace, leaving only one true young master restored to his original spirit. Upon seeing the immortal maiden and the household, he felt as if waking from a great dream. Recalling all that had happened, he was fully clear, though he lamented that at the time he could neither move nor speak. Now freed, he knew the immortal maiden was no ordinary woman but truly a celestial being incarnate. For a moment, he did not know what to do.

The immortal maiden beckoned with her hand, and the young master, no longer master of his own will, ran straight forward and knelt stiffly on the ground. The maiden then sternly rebuked him, saying, “Your foster father is but a petty commoner—what merit or virtue does he possess? Only through cunning and deceit did he flatter the emperor. Though a mere eunuch, he has risen so high; he should be cautious, keep to his place, be content and self-restrained—that is the proper way. How dare he, relying on favor and rank, act wantonly and wickedly? Above, he blinds the Son of Heaven; below, he oppresses the ministers; the people’s lifeblood is sucked dry by him. Yet he still tempts the emperor to indulge in tyranny. Such conduct is intolerable by Heaven’s principle; his destruction is not far off. You, as his son, do not think to do good deeds to atone for his sins but instead abuse your power, seduce virtuous women, causing families to ruin and lives to perish. In guilt, you are no less than your father. Today, by chance, you have met me, a humble Daoist with some power. By luck, you have escaped your poisonous hand; had it been otherwise, you would now be a wronged ghost in the Court of Retribution. For your deeds, you deserve a sword’s justice to relieve the many suffering families inside and outside the capital. But by my master’s decree, I may not kill lightly. Moreover, though your father and you are full of evil, your fate is not yet complete; you must live a few more years. When your crimes reach the heavens, your glorious retribution will come. Tell your father: everyone is watching!”

The young master, hearing this sharp rebuke, understood it well in his heart, yet he had always harmed others wantonly, never suffered a single loss, and knew nothing of confession or repentance. After the immortal maiden’s cutting admonition, he merely opened his eyes wide, revealing a fierce glare, glaring savagely at her. The maiden sighed softly and said to those around, “Look at your young master’s expression—what spirit is this? Were it not for my presence, he would surely have turned on you all, seeking to take my life. Alas, I offered him many kind words, but he would not hear a single one. I have no patience left to speak further. If he had not met me, so be it; but since he has, I will not allow him to go forth to ruin women again, nor will I lightly lift my sword against this useless wretch. Watch now: with a single finger, I shall disrupt the flow of his vital qi and blood, so that his meridians cannot run as before. At least he will suffer a wasting illness; not only will he be unable to go forth to do evil, but even to move a step will exhaust his whole being. He will become a cripple.”

Hearing this, the crowd panicked. They all knelt before the immortal maiden, knocking their heads in unison, pleading mercy on the young master’s behalf. The maiden smiled and said, “I know well: if he could repent from the words I spoke, that would be the gateway to the dao. Not only could he avoid punishment, but he could cultivate to become an immortal—all depends on this one thought. Now, seeing no sign of repentance but only anger and hatred, it is clear he is a hardened villain. Sparing his life is already a great kindness. How could I allow him to go out and harm others again?” Saying this, she extended a finger and touched a vital point on the young master’s upper body. At once, he cried out, “Ah!” and fell backward, lying on the ground groaning. The crowd was greatly alarmed and hurried to support him, but the maiden laughed, saying, “Two of you carry him inside at once; he has no strength to move.” Before she finished, a voice outside announced the arrival of a great official. The immortal maiden was somewhat surprised: how could that scoundrel Zhao Gao still dare to see her? She sat upright in the hall, waiting for him to enter, curious what he would say next.

Unexpectedly, Zhao Gao knelt immediately upon seeing the immortal maiden, crawling forward on his knees and face, crying out, “Immortal, forgive my crimes! Your servant truly did not know the immortal had descended and offended you greatly. I have heard the young master did not obey and was rightly punished. Your servant is infinitely grateful. I have already reported to His Majesty the Son of Heaven, who ordered me to send a decree to invite you to stay your numinous carriage and come at once to meet you.” Hearing this, the immortal maiden was puzzled, but since he came with courtesy, she could not remain arrogant. Smiling, she waved her hand and said, “Rise, rise. Your son disobeyed instruction; I could not bear to see the people suffer, so I showed a slight punishment to prevent his evil deeds and spare your family future trouble. As for the emperor’s arrival, I dare not presume; I shall go to court to pay respects. Though I am no golden immortal of the upper realms, I know somewhat of the path of cultivation and will report the details face to face, hiding nothing. If one outwardly admires the dao but inwardly harbors lust, even if one meets the Patriarch of the Dao or the Jade Emperor, one will not attain longevity. Besides, I have no merit or power to act for him.” Then she laughed and said to Zhao Gao, “Please convey my thanks to the emperor. I take my leave.” With a flourish of her sleeve, the entire hall filled with red light and waves of strange fragrance, stirring the hearts of all present with a refreshing solemnity.

Zhao Gao was just inquiring about his son’s condition when the First Emperor arrived. He had no choice but to step outside to kneel and escort him inside, repeating the immortal maiden’s words. The First Emperor frowned and said, “The immortal asks if I am sincere, yet she does not come herself—how am I to express my heart to her?” Zhao Gao reported, “From the immortal’s tone, she seems deeply moved by the imperial favor and will surely come to court. Your Majesty may dwell safely in the inner palace and await her descent; then you may petition the immortal’s dao. I believe nothing will hinder this.” The emperor asked a few questions about the immortal’s descent, and Zhao Gao reported his son’s illness in detail.

Returning to the palace, the emperor found the empress and concubines gathered in the imperial garden. He ordered two chief eunuchs to accompany him there. A young eunuch hurried ahead to announce their arrival. The empress led a group of concubines to kneel in welcome. The emperor entered the gate, took the empress’s hand, and smilingly asked, “How is it that you have all come to this place at once?” The empress replied, “I was just about to report, Your Majesty. Just now, colorful clouds appeared in the sky, and in their midst stood an immortal maiden, dressed plainly, holding a whisk. She dropped a piece of white silk into the garden, so everyone came to see.” She then presented the white silk with both hands to the emperor. The emperor took it and saw written upon it: “To nourish the heart, nothing is better than few desires; to seek the dao, nothing precedes loving the people.” At the bottom was signed a single character: “He.”

The emperor saw this and could not help but scoff, saying, “This must be that female Daoist from the Zhao household. If she is an immortal, how can she speak such pedantic words?” The empress laughed too, saying, “Such old-fashioned talk! The hundreds of scholars we buried last time all said the same. Who wants her to say more?” The emperor suddenly recalled something and said, “I heard ministers report that every mountain, sea, river, and lake has its own immortal deity, but the Yellow River’s god is most powerful in dao and magic. Offering white jade and silk sacrifices surely protects my sacred life for ten thousand years. I sent ministers to perform the rites, but they have not yet returned. Yesterday, a certain alchemist claimed he could summon wind, rain, thunder, and lightning, commanding ghosts and spirits. I planned to summon him to court for a test, but affairs were too many, and I forgot. Tomorrow, I must investigate these two matters thoroughly.” The empress and others replied, “Immortals certainly exist, but some only know a little magic and have no great skill. Hearing the emperor loves the dao, they boast talents to seek wealth and rank, but truly have nothing to do with the Great Dao. Such people must be guarded against.” The emperor nodded, smiling, “Your words are wise. I often guard against such deceivers. I must test them face to face before I believe.” The empress and others all said, “Your Majesty is most sagacious.” The emperor was pleased and ordered the eunuchs to set a banquet at the garden’s pavilion on the lake, to drink and enjoy with the empress and concubines.

Leaving aside that matter, what of the immortal maiden? After leaving the Zhao household, she used invisibility arts to wait nearby. After a while, seeing the emperor indeed come in person, she was somewhat moved. She thought: when people have good thoughts, Heaven must follow. Though the emperor has committed violent acts, he is after all the ruler of all under Heaven. If he can repent immediately, renew the people, then with a turn of his hand, he could create boundless merit and virtue, reversing his fate—it would not be difficult. Since he shows such sincerity toward me, I must do my utmost and go to admonish him a few words. Resolving this, she wrote those two lines on white silk, rode the clouds into the palace, and deliberately revealed her true form, dropping the written silk from within the palace. This was only to inspire admiration and wonder among the palace folk, to confirm the truth of immortals’ dao, so that when the emperor returned, all would report this matter, strengthening his faith in the immortal path. This was her heartfelt intention. Yet the emperor regarded it as pedantry and ignored it—something the immortal maiden did not expect. After dropping the silk, she immediately returned to the temple, only to find the young master and his retinue all gone. She laughed and said, “No need to say, this is that Daoist priest’s doing. I was just about to seek him; now I must ask that old Daoist.”

Just then, the old Daoist came toward her and, seeing her, shouted, “Fellow Daoist, you have caused trouble! I warned you not to look for a place to stay, but you did not listen and ran into that Zhao young master. You are a person of the Way and casually used some little tricks, throwing his whole family into chaos. Have you not thought how, under such great power and influence, we could escape his grasp? Just now, troops were sent to take away our Master Liu, and we do not yet know how he will be judged. No need to say more; anyway, you cannot control these matters. But from now on, our temple will no longer harbor passing Daoist companions. I must trouble you to find lodging elsewhere.” The immortal maiden was both shocked and angry. Seeing his decisiveness, she did not wish to argue further and said, “Master Liu also has his magic; how could he suffer loss to that scoundrel? As for me, I do not need a fixed place. If I must go, I shall go, no need to trouble you further. But may I ask, when you escorted the Zhao young master away, I briefly greeted a Daoist but had no time to inquire. May I ask if that was Master Fei? Does he live in the temple or elsewhere?” The Daoist replied, “Master Fei lives on West Street, very near here. He is a highly esteemed figure. If you want to find him, just ask anywhere and you will know.” Saying this, he apologized and left without looking back. The immortal maiden stood alone, unnoticed by anyone.

Though angry, she also found it somewhat amusing. She could only pace out. Reaching a market street, she asked around and was indeed directed to Master Fei’s home on West Street. She knocked, and a child opened the door. Seeing the immortal maiden, the child spat and laughed, saying, “My father hates monks and Daoists. My uncle is bewitched every day by a crooked Daoist. Now a female Daoist comes looking for him—how ridiculous!” Saying this, the child shut the door, and no matter how loudly she called, no one answered. The immortal maiden could not help but smile, saying, “Arriving in the capital, I have been driven away twice already. Truly, near the Son of Heaven’s feet, there are many bad people and few good.” Saying this, she turned and found a quiet, deserted place to sit in meditation through the night. At dawn, opening her eyes, she scooped some spring water from a stream to wash them. She was planning how to find Master Fei again, to discuss rescuing Master Liu and to ask about some dao methods, but troubled that his household would not receive her, she wondered what to do. Lost in thought, she sat on a stone used for washing clothes, dazed.

Suddenly, a strange wind rose from behind the western mountain. The trees on the mountain rustled wildly; insects and birds all whistled and screeched, crying out in confusion and scattering in flight. Listening downward, the spring water babbled and rippled, stirring countless wrinkles on the surface, tossing many fish and shrimp helplessly, rolling and tumbling in turmoil. The immortal maiden sighed and said, “Insects, birds, fish, and shrimp live peacefully among the mountains and waters—what wrong have they done? Yet they suffer the harsh wind’s calamity. I hear that the present Son of Heaven commits many unrighteous acts, and Zhao Gao and a band of villains lead him to evil, stirring chaos across the four seas. The people wander and flee, not knowing where to die. How are these fish and birds any different?” Reflecting thus, she felt a surge of compassion and lamented her shallow cultivation, unable to eradicate violence, bring peace, save the countless suffering people, or dispel the myriad vexations of the world.

Lost in thought, suddenly a greater wind arose, fiercer and more sudden than before, more violent in force. For a time, the sounds of trees, water, insects, birds, stones, and flying sand all responded to one another, merging into a chorus of dreadful cries. The immortal maiden saw the wind come without cause and cast a divination with her sleeve. Alarmed, she said, “There must be a great tiger or leopard in the mountain.” Before she finished speaking, a tremendous roar arose from the mountain, fiercer than ordinary thunder. Drawing her sword, she left the stream’s edge and stepped along the bank, intending to ascend the mountain. Halfway there, she saw a great spotted leopard rushing out of the mountain. The beast ran while frequently glancing back, as if afraid of pursuit. The immortal maiden was amazed, saying, “Such a great beast—could there be someone chasing it?” Before she finished, she saw a strange sight: behind the leopard, a person was running swiftly in pursuit. The figure appeared no older than eight or nine years, bare-handed, rushing courageously like a gale, shouting, “You wretched beast dares to escape? Do you think your young master will let you go?”

This sight left the immortal maiden dumbfounded and bewildered. How could a child fight a leopard? What would be the outcome? The answer will be revealed in the next chapter.
