# Chapter Thirty-Eight: Masterful Hands Subdue the Fierce Beast — True Skill Awakens the Divine Child

Now it happened that the Immortal Maiden, upon seeing the one pursuing the great leopard, realized it was a child not yet ten years old. She was struck with astonishment and alarm. Originally, she intended to rush up the mountain to aid him with a sword strike, so as to prevent the needless loss of life. Yet, unexpectedly, the leopard, upon noticing the child closing in, let out a mighty roar and charged down the mountain. The Immortal Maiden then perceived that this matter was indeed extraordinary. This child was no mere mortal or spirit transformed, but surely someone of great destiny. Since that was so, the leopard must not harm him in the slightest. Resolutely, she stepped forward to block the beast’s path, thrusting her sword toward the leopard’s throat.

The leopard, dizzy from its flight, was utterly unprepared for this sudden obstruction. Raising its head in fury, it lunged at the Immortal Maiden. With a spirit keen and eyes sharp, she quickly bowed her head and dropped her body low, slipping beneath the leopard’s belly. Just as she prepared to strike its abdomen, the leopard seemed to understand her intent. It leapt upward, soaring over ten feet into the air, evading her sword. In that instant of thrust and dodge, the child arrived behind, seizing the moment of the leopard’s leap. He stretched out a small hand and caught hold of one of the leopard’s legs midair.

The leopard, seeing the Immortal Maiden’s sword was not much to fear, yet feeling the child’s sudden tug, howled in pain as if a thousand agonies pierced it. It twisted its head around to swallow the child whole.

The leopard’s jaws were vast, the child’s head small. The Immortal Maiden could not help but cry out, “Ah!” She rushed forward to protect him, but to her surprise, the child did not shy away. Instead, he went with the momentum, pushing his small head straight into the leopard’s mouth. The distance between them was but a few inches. The Immortal Maiden grew even more anxious, hastily raising her sword to strike at the leopard’s eyeballs. Yet the child’s skill and agility surpassed her swordplay. Just as her blade neared the leopard’s eyes, the beast retreated slightly, and the child vaulted over its head, flipping his body into a posture like an inverted dragonfly perched upon the leopard’s back. His two feet pointed skyward, while his hands gripped the leopard’s back tightly. The leopard was pinned down, unable to move, as if a great mountain pressed upon it. Its breath came in heavy gusts, showing extreme exhaustion.

Only then did the Immortal Maiden understand: this child truly possessed the power to subdue fierce beasts. Though she wielded a treasured sword, she had repeatedly failed to strike true. As a practitioner of the dao, she felt ashamed. Hastily, she sheathed her sword and prepared to speak with the child. Suddenly, the child turned over, sitting astride the leopard’s back, and pointed at the Immortal Maiden with a smile:

“Sister, you have a kind heart, but alas, your treasured sword cannot even shear a single hair from this great tiger’s hide. Such a weapon is only fit to kill cats and dogs, to carve fish and turtles, or at best to trim bamboo strips and cut grass and reeds—then it might be of some use. But to handle a beast like this, I fear it would swallow even your delicate body whole. I dare say it wouldn’t even need to frown or rub its belly afterward.”

The Immortal Maiden, seeing the child’s flippancy, felt both ashamed and at a loss how to respond. Yet she cherished his innate genius, knowing he could be nurtured. If she did not seize this moment to caution him, he would grow ever more arrogant and reckless, destined to become a villainous scoundrel who would harm the people. This was a matter both regrettable and worrisome. With a furrowed brow and a smile, she said to the child:

“Young sir, your strength is indeed formidable, but you cannot rely solely on brute force. Were it not for this strength, you would long ago have become the beast’s meal, or worse, its excrement. So, in my humble view, this is not yet a truly extraordinary skill.”

The child, stung by her words, grew angry. Sitting astride the leopard, he raised two small fingers and scolded:

“You wretched woman, what great skill could you have to speak such wild nonsense? Those who fight beasts always depend on strength. Strength as great as mine, bare-handed, is a hundred times mightier than your sword. How can you say it is not a skill? But you, brandishing a treasured sword, cannot even shear a single leopard hair—how is that skill?”

The Immortal Maiden laughed:

“That is not what I mean. I say that to kill a beast by force alone is the valor of a mere warrior. But if a large pack of beasts should come, no matter how strong your strength, you would be forced to attend to one and lose another, ending up in the beast’s belly with no hope of rescue. In my humble opinion, using sword and strength is not very convenient. It is best not even to use bare hands, but to command hundreds of fierce beasts to bow their heads and obey your orders. When you command them not to move, they dare not breathe; when you command them to move, they cannot stop their feet. Would that not be safer and more reliable than brute force? Moreover, you could use them to carry loads and replace your footsteps.”

The child laughed so heartily he nearly fell off the leopard’s back. He shouted:

“Before, I took you for a living person and spoke properly, even calling you ‘Sister.’ But now I see you are no living being at all, but a ghost who only speaks dead words!”

The Immortal Maiden smiled:

“How do you know I am a ghost?”

The child laughed again:

“If you were alive, why would you be so mischievous? You think me a child, but I am clever and will not listen to your nonsense.”

The Immortal Maiden replied:

“How do you know I am speaking nonsense?”

The child said:

“If you would show me your skill face to face, then I might believe your words. But I fear you have not tested your methods, and your life would be buried in a living grave. Would that not be seeking suffering? And you would only invite my laughter!”

The Immortal Maiden smiled:

“You are a naughty child, speaking without reason. What living grave? What seeking suffering? So young, yet your tongue is so unkind.”

The child grew angry again and shouted:

“Nonsense! I truly mean well. If you cannot control the leopard, it will swallow you whole. Would that not be a burial inside the beast? The leopard eating your slender body would not surely burst, but might grow stronger and healthier. Then would your burial place not be a living grave? Besides, what does it matter to you if I tame the leopard? Yet you stir it up with such tricks, like snatching food from a tiger’s mouth—what they call ‘grabbing the tiger’s whiskers with bare hands.’ Do you think you will survive? That is seeking suffering. You seem clever, but your words show no sense of right or wrong. If you keep this up, don’t blame me if I treat you like the leopard. Then don’t say I am rude!”

He laughed loudly, tossing his body like a willow swayed by the wind.

In all human life, laughter and tears are unavoidable, yet these two states often bear an inverse relation to physical health. According to physicians and health experts, those who cry much are said to be harmed by sorrow and grief, while those who laugh much are said to forget worries and refresh their spirits. Thus, laughter and tears relate intimately to our well-being. Yet all things must have limits. Though crying and laughing cannot be wholly avoided, one cannot laugh aloud all day without frowning or shedding tears. That would be too uncomfortable for the body. So laughter and tears, like ordinary matters, must have their proper measure. Excessive crying is not necessarily harmful, but excessive laughter can also cause problems. This is a clear principle needing no further explanation.

As for the child who fought the leopard, his strength was indeed great, but at his age, his knowledge was still lacking. The ancients said that to tread upon a tiger’s tail or wade into spring waters were acts of great danger. How much more so to ride a fierce leopard! Having mounted the beast’s back, one must always be cautious and vigilant against any sudden move. Yet this child, caught up in verbal sparring with the Immortal Maiden, laughed heartily, loosening his joints. This was the very saying of “light bones,” meaning that laughter, when ill-timed, can be as harmful as crying.

It was thus that the child met with danger. As he laughed, his joints loosened, and the once heavily pressed, subdued leopard sensed its burden lessened tenfold. This was its chance to break free. With all its might, it thrust upward, flinging the child to the ground. When the child had first subdued the leopard, he had been extremely cautious, never relaxing. But now, after laughter and the sudden fall, he could not regain his strength at once. Moreover, he was startled and injured, his spirit and composure shaken. His struggles were slower than usual. Meanwhile, the leopard, sensing the upper hand and turning defeat into victory, grew more spirited. Seeing the child thrown down, it dared not slacken, but spun like a hawk and pounced upon him. What had been fast before was now a hundred times swifter.

Before the child could rise, the leopard’s forepaws pressed down upon him, as if to repay him in kind by pinning him beneath its weight, so he could not escape. Only then would it open its bloodthirsty jaws and slowly savor its prey.

Gentle readers, do not say that the author is not a leopard and cannot know the leopard’s mind. We must understand that worldly affairs often allow one to see one thing and know two, to infer principle from circumstance. From the leopard’s actions toward the child, it truly seemed to harbor such intentions. Yet the author is always humble, never rashly affirming anything. Hence, before describing the leopard’s mind, I prefaced it with “it seemed,” indicating this observation remains tentative, not absolute.

Alas, too many words! Though the reasoning is ample, scholars might say I am trifling, indulging in the petty tricks of novelists, inserting trivial talk at a moment of great tension. This concerns the author’s reputation, so I shall stop here and return to the story of the leopard’s struggle.

Now the leopard was above, the child below, like a mechanism ready to snap shut with a “click.” The fitting of mortise and tenon would decide life or death, victory or defeat, with no chance of rescue. The leopard’s weight was immense; the child was small. The child’s hold on the leopard relied purely on innate strength. The leopard, to pin the child, need only lie down casually upon him, no need to open its jaws to swallow. Surely the child’s body would be crushed to pulp.

The situation had reached this desperate point. In that instant, a strange cry rang out: “Ah, ah, ah!” Poor child, born with great strength and cleverness, his small body pressed close to the leopard’s belly, head and abdomen touching. No matter how brave, he could not help but be terrified, crying out in horror, his soul and courage shattered. Unconsciously, he lunged forward, face down, back toward the leopard’s belly. The leopard, exerting full force, lay down and pressed its four paws tightly, preventing the child’s escape. Even with ten lives, the child could not avoid a journey to the living grave.

At this critical moment, not only did every reader hold their breath for the child, but even the author’s heart trembled with a hundred and twentyfold caution. Yet the author is confident, possessing a measure of foresight beyond the reader. Since the child is a key figure in this tale, he shall not perish prematurely. When death seems near, an unexpected savior will surely turn the tide. Not to mention the Immortal Maiden herself, though she has not yet become an immortal, she is skilled in the dao. How could she bear to harm the child she wishes to nurture? Readers must keep this firmly in mind.

From the moment the child was thrown from the leopard’s back to being pressed beneath its belly was but a fleeting instant. Throughout this moment, the Immortal Maiden remained by his side, never stepping away. Seeing the child thrown down, her fright was even greater than the child’s own peril. Fortunately, she quickly recovered her wits, knowing that force was less effective than method. She chanted softly, forming a binding spell, then shouted, “Wicked beast, release him at once!” From her voice came a powerful call. The leopard was immobilized by her daoist spell, unable to move despite trapping the child. Seeing the leopard still, the child thought his chance to escape and retaliate had come. He crawled out from beneath the leopard’s belly and seized its front leg, pulling hard. Once free from under the leopard, he could turn defeat into victory. His spirit and courage revived, he planned to break the leopard’s leg as a means of conquest.

Yet the leopard, bound by the Immortal Maiden’s spell, was as hard as steel. The child strained with all his strength but only shifted the leg slightly. The leopard seemed not to notice, nor utter a sound of pain. The child climbed out and examined the leopard’s body. The beast stood quietly in one place, its eyes flashing like lightning, staring blankly at the Immortal Maiden, like a trained dog awaiting orders. The child was surprised and shouted at the Immortal Maiden:

“Immortal Maiden, did you teach it to play dead like this?”

The Immortal Maiden smiled and nodded:

“If I had not taught it to feign death, would you still be alive? At this moment, if it dared move, you would already be buried in its living grave.”

The child, though mocked, did not grow angry. Instead, he approached the Immortal Maiden with a grin and asked:

“Sister, if you truly have such skill, I invite you to my home. I have a big house and a large garden, full of delights. I will make you my master and ask you to teach me the methods of taming leopards and fighting tigers. How about that?”

The Immortal Maiden secretly nodded to herself: this child is reasonable and a talent to be cultivated. She smiled and said:

“Do you still doubt? With but a single finger, I can command this beast to squat on the ground as your steed and send you home. What do you say?”

The child was overjoyed:

“Good Master, please issue the command to make it squat.”

The Immortal Maiden said nothing but extended her index finger and commanded sharply, “Hurry!” The leopard immediately crouched down. The child rejoiced and exclaimed, “Wonderful!” Disregarding everything, he leapt up and rode the leopard’s back, pounding it ten times with his small fists and scolding:

“You wretched beast, you nearly cost me my life!”

The leopard felt nothing, as if unaware. The Immortal Maiden laughed:

“This creature is still bound by my daoist spell. Its soul is not in its body. Even if you were to kill its head, it would feel no pain.”

The child stopped and asked:

“Master, will you not come with me?”

The Immortal Maiden smiled:

“Where is your home? Who else lives there? Tell me clearly, and I will go with you.”

The child hurriedly said:

“Sister, no need to ask more. My home is nearest, just beyond this mountain, near the lake. My surname is Zhongli, given name Quan. My father is Zhongli Jun. He is very old now and cannot hunt beasts. Sometimes when he walks far, I have to support him. I also have a grandmother, older even than my father.”

At these words, the Immortal Maiden could not help but smile.

What further words the child spoke, and whether the Immortal Maiden accompanied him, shall be revealed in the next chapter.
