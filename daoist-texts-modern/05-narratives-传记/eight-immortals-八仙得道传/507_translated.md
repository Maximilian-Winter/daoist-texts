# Chapter Thirty-Nine: The Wine Jar That Could Hold Iron Crutch, The Gourd That Silenced the Immortal Maiden

Now, it happened that Zhongli Quan spoke to the Immortal Maiden, telling her that his grandmother was even older than his father. He could not help but laugh, saying, “Child, you speak like a child again. Naturally, grandmother is older than your father—just as you are younger than your father. Is this not obvious?” Zhongli Quan laughed as well and said, “My elder sister is called Big Miss; she is twelve years old this year, while I am only nine. I also have an elder brother, who, as father says, was carried off by a tiger. Because of this, my father hates tigers and leopards bitterly. Ten years ago, he was still a mighty hero, a great man of valor. Countless wild beasts of the four nearby mountains fell by his hand. Later, when my sister and I were born, he taught us all his skills. Yet two years ago, when he went to a certain place, he was surrounded by many tigers and leopards and fought them through the night. Though he survived, all his strength was spent. At dawn, someone found him lying on the ground, foaming at the mouth, his body limp and powerless, unable to govern himself, yet still able to speak. They carried him home. Since then, he has not dared enter the mountains nor confront those beasts again.”

The Immortal Maiden listened and could not help but nod and sigh, saying, “Child, look well. Your father was such a hero, such a man of talent. Yet, by relying on his own brute strength to kill tigers and leopards, he ended up wounded and maimed. This shows that in life, even if one has some strength, it is best not to use it to harm others or kill creatures. It is wiser to reserve one’s energy for deeds beneficial to the world or for protecting oneself. That is the proper way.” The child said, “Sister, you speak truly. At first, my father was eager to send my sister and me into the mountains to slay all the tigers and leopards. But after he fell ill, he was reluctant to teach us such matters. What he said is just the same truth you have spoken. I believe my father’s lesson, and I also believe all the good words you have taught me.” Hearing this, the Immortal Maiden grew even more pleased and said, “The time grows late. Your family must be waiting for you to return for the meal. Come, take me with you. I will surely teach you the method to subdue tigers, leopards, and wolves. From then on, you will have less trouble with wild beasts, sparing many lives. Moreover, my method not only tames beasts but also, should you encounter wicked men who act violently or harm the place or oppose you, you need not fight them. Simply silently recite an incantation, and the opposing person will lose their power to resist. Child, do you think this method is good?”

The child heard this and was so joyful that he danced about, calling out several times, “Good sister, you truly are my fine master. My father and grandmother both said they would hire a master with skill for me. Who would have thought that today I would meet one! Master, please lead the way; let us return home together. As for this leopard, I feel a bit reluctant to leave it behind. Master, use some magic power to bring it along, and then we will hear what my father decides.” The Immortal Maiden wished to bring Zhongli Quan under her tutelage and guide him on the path, so she could not always oppose his wishes and risk losing the child’s favor. Smiling, she said, “Go ahead. I will bring it along with us.” Then, with a gesture of her hand, the leopard leapt up, lowering its head and flattening its ears, and followed the two as they walked beyond the mountain.

Zhongli Quan pointed with his finger and said, “There is a great bamboo grove over there. Behind the bamboo grove stand two large camphor trees. Along the riverbank is the house where we live.” The Immortal Maiden was just following the direction of his small hand, looking far ahead, when suddenly she noticed something very strange. Before she could clearly see the house, she first saw a most peculiar sight: in front of the bamboo grove, facing the path where the two were walking, stood a wine jar with a mouth small and belly large, moving on its own. The jar’s mouth was upward, its base downward, staggering forward as if coming to greet the Immortal Maiden and company from afar. Startled, the Immortal Maiden exclaimed, “Child, look! What is that thing? How can it move by itself? Yet it has no feet. What is the reason for this?”

Zhongli Quan glanced and laughed, saying, “Oh, that thing? That is a person. Master, you did not see it before, but there is a human head sticking out from the jar’s mouth. This man is said to be the strangest eccentric in the capital city. How could you not recognize him?” By now, the Immortal Maiden had indeed seen the human head protruding from the jar’s mouth and grew deeply suspicious. She asked the child, “Do you know where this strange man is from? How long has he been here?” The child replied, “This man has no home or family. He lives inside this jar. Sometimes he leaves the jar on the road and goes out, often not returning for two or three days. Sometimes he carries the jar as he walks, as if the person and jar are connected and cannot be separated. Master, you just saw him walking with the jar. This man does not speak much with ordinary people, nor does he go to market or eat at home. The jar’s mouth is small but his body is large; no one knows how he can enter and exit without hindrance. He never gives his name, so no one recognizes him. All know only that he is a black, tough, crippled man who always leans on an iron crutch. He calls himself Iron Crutch Sir, and others call him Iron Crutch Sir as well. Master, tell me, how should we reckon his name?”

The Immortal Maiden pondered deeply on this and, seeing Iron Crutch approaching, hastened forward with Zhongli Quan to greet him. She bowed to the black head protruding from the jar’s mouth and called out, “Sir, whence do you come, and where are you bound? This poor Daoist…”

Before she finished the word “Daoist,” Iron Crutch Sir tapped the black head three times on the jar’s mouth. The head and jar struck with a loud “boom,” causing Zhongli to burst into hearty laughter. Iron Crutch Sir first said to the Immortal Maiden, “Don’t say anything. If you say more, it will be too much. Do you think I and you are blind? We don’t even recognize our old companions of two generations?” The Immortal Maiden was stunned and did not understand his meaning. Iron Crutch Sir then smiled at Zhongli and said, “Child, why are you laughing? I’ll tell you: it’s not that this jar cannot bear my taps, but that without my iron head, no one else could make the jar sound like that.” Zhongli’s eyes grew wide and round as he stared at Iron Crutch Sir in amazement. Iron Crutch Sir laughed and said, “Don’t be confused or afraid. Use your strength for striking leopards and tap this jar three times. See if it makes a sound!”

Zhongli Quan, seeing how strange this was, hesitated and dared not move. Iron Crutch Sir laughed at the Immortal Maiden, saying, “Look at you! Your high disciple has only just received a few lessons from you, and already he is so cautious.” Hearing this, both the Immortal Maiden and Zhongli were even more astonished and frightened. The Immortal Maiden bowed deeply and said, “I know you are a golden immortal from Heaven playing among mortals. I have been a Daoist for many years but feel ashamed of my scant achievements. I have long wished to return to the true path but, lost in the sea of people, have not met the right one. Now meeting you, surely I will receive your guidance. This is truly a blessing for three lifetimes.” Before she finished, Iron Crutch Sir laughed loudly and said, “You are too polite. I am only troubling you. Since you want to be righteous with me, why did you steal my disciple away?” The Immortal Maiden was bewildered and asked, “Master, what do you mean? This is our first meeting. How could I have stolen your disciple?” Iron Crutch Sir laughed and said, “That child is called Zhongli Quan, is he not? Isn’t he my disciple? Though you have affinity with him, I was appointed by the Patriarch of Life to protect and instruct him. How could you, upon first meeting, dare to take him as your disciple?”

Seeing that he knew everything beforehand, the Immortal Maiden trusted that he must be a true immortal. She bowed again and said, “Master, you are too kind. Your Daoist cultivation is so profound, how could you not know that the talk of master and disciple came from the child’s mouth? I did not dare accept him. I only saw that he had great strength and, being a mere child, I was somewhat amazed and thought he could be nurtured. Later, seeing his submission and respect, I grew to love him more and wished to follow him home to teach him some methods. This is a small matter. My private wish is to lead him onto the path, to save his noble nature from being lost to worldly desires. If I can guide him onto the true way, then later he can seek a great master to teach him the great Dao, and it will not be difficult for him to become an immortal. This is all my humble intention. A sage as wise as you surely can understand. Now that we have met, it is also this child’s good fortune. Not only him, but I too would wish to join your ranks and follow your immortal carriage, so as to quickly attain true enlightenment and escape the mundane world. I am truly grateful.” She bowed again.

Before Iron Crutch Sir could reply, Zhongli Quan, still a child at heart, quickly pulled the Immortal Maiden back and said, “Master, do not be so formal. Let us invite this honored teacher to our home. If his Daoist methods are truly higher than yours, then my sister and I will both bow to him as master. If not, I will still learn from you and not be fooled by others.” The Immortal Maiden quickly scolded, “Do not speak nonsense. This master is the true immortal. How do you see otherwise?” Iron Crutch Sir laughed heartily and said, “Oh, this child has forgotten his true nature. Very well, very well. Since you say so, I will show you a little skill. If you still make me your master, you may not even respect me and might think me a mere cripple, deliberately made to be your master. If you have such doubts, your cultivation will never advance, and all my efforts will be wasted. Come, come, come, look! Aren’t we already at your home?” The Immortal Maiden and Zhongli were astonished and opened their eyes wide in disbelief. Indeed, it was a strange matter: not only had they arrived at Zhongli’s home, but they were already inside the main hall.

Zhongli Quan’s father, Lao Jun, and his elder sister, Big Miss, were seated at the lower end, chatting about daily matters. Seeing the three suddenly enter, they were startled and stood up. The Immortal Maiden was deeply suspicious that this Iron Crutch Sir might be the very Fei Changfang who had yesterday escorted her to the Zhao family, employing the art of instant travel. As for Zhongli Quan, though young, his heart was clear. He already understood this much: this was truly a heavenly immortal’s great art, far beyond the Immortal Maiden’s methods of subduing beasts. His heart brightened, and he immediately knelt, bowing several times to Iron Crutch Sir, saying, “Master above, your disciple Zhongli Quan pays respects. Earlier, my words were rash and disrespectful. I beg your forgiveness.” Iron Crutch Sir laughed heartily. The Immortal Maiden was also greatly comforted and wished to bow to him as master, performing a respectful greeting. Iron Crutch Sir hastily stopped her, laughing, “No, no, I am not your master. You already have Mysterious Lady as your teacher, far stronger than me, so why seek another? Besides, you and I are old friends from past lives. Our cultivation just differs in timing and depth of attainment, but in the end, success will be the same. Now that we meet here, it is like meeting an old friend in a strange land. Whatever you wish to ask, speak freely. How dare I take the place of master?”

The Immortal Maiden, hearing this, was still puzzled and asked, “I cannot recall where I have met you before. I consider my memory good and do not dare to claim I have paid homage to your golden visage. Please, immortal master, enlighten me.” Iron Crutch Sir smiled and shook his head, saying, “You only know how to see people’s appearances, all superficial learning. How can you connect with the spirit? To know without seeing, to discern shape through transformation—that is because your skill is lacking. This is no fault of yours. Just now, you thought the person who helped you yesterday was me in disguise. That shows your mind is sharp. But it is not so. The person you saw yesterday is one I recently tried to save but failed. His surname is Fei, named Changfang. The ‘Master Fei’ I mentioned to you yesterday is this same person. Why would you suspect me?” The Immortal Maiden blushed slightly, feeling her thoughts had been read. She admired him more, but since he said he could not be master, there must be a reason. She waited for him to speak of their past meeting before further consideration.

Yet Iron Crutch Sir said no more and turned to greet Lao Jun and his daughter. By now, Lao Jun had heard his son’s account of the matter and had long known of the strange newcomer in the capital. Now that Iron Crutch Sir possessed such great art and was willing to accept his son as disciple, how could he refuse? He placed his hand on his daughter’s shoulder and prepared to kneel.

Iron Crutch Sir laughed heartily, “Since your son is my disciple, you are my fellow townsman. Fellow townsmen owe masters only the duty of presenting the offering of the three-fold tribute. There is no need for such grand kneeling. Please sit. I wish to speak with your son.” Lao Jun had no choice but to thank him repeatedly, then helped his son and daughter to sit again at the lower end. Iron Crutch Sir pointed and said, “You, an old man of such years, walk slower than a child. Are you not ashamed?” His words caused a great burst of laughter. Zhongli Quan quickly recounted again how his father was injured by beasts. Iron Crutch Sir laughed and said, “I do not believe it. Who in the world is ever hurt by beasts? I suspect your illness is feigned.” Seeing his master’s jest, Zhongli laughed too and said, “Father, the master says you are faking your illness! Sister, help Father up so the master can see if the sickness is real.” Big Miss complied and helped her father up. But halfway through, she felt his body so light it was as if he weighed nothing. She used all her strength but stumbled, almost falling. Lao Jun reached out to steady her, and with only a slight effort, lifted her as if she were a chick. At the same time, he felt all pain vanish and his vigor restored.

All were amazed and exclaimed at the marvel. Lao Jun understood that Iron Crutch Sir had healed him. He straightened his body and regained the heroic spirit of ten years past. He loudly declared, “I, an old man, out of deep love for my children, vowed to kill all tigers and leopards near the mountains. Yet, in doing so, I brought harm upon myself. Though not yet old, I became crippled. For ten years, my body was numb and pain beyond words. The worst was that, though Heaven gave me strength, I could not use it to help the world. Instead, I became maimed. Though tigers and leopards are harmful and should be driven away, all creatures have their place by Heaven’s design. To kill them to death, to slay excessively, is not the heart of a benevolent man. Whenever I think of this, I feel I have wasted Heaven’s gift of talent. My conscience is more painful than my body’s suffering by tenfold. Now, fortunately, the immortal master has descended and graciously aided me. My decade-long illness is cured in an instant. Perhaps Heaven sees that though I have many faults, my heart is not evil. My punishment is complete. So, by the immortal master’s hand, my health is restored. From now on, all my remaining years are Heaven’s special gift, and since the immortal master refuses thanks, I can only hold my children’s hands and strive to do good, hoping to repay Heaven and wish the immortal master eternal life without bounds.”

He then commanded Zhongli, “Quickly, on my behalf, you and your sister bow and thank the immortal master.” The two obeyed and knelt before Iron Crutch Sir, who accepted their bows. Then he laughed and said to Lao Jun, “Since your son has joined my Daoist school, I must teach him some skills so that his apprenticeship is not in vain. As for this Immortal Maiden, she and I are Daoist friends from past lives. Having met by chance, we shall linger a while. Old hero, please prepare two clean chambers: one for the Immortal Maiden’s rest, one for my disciple and me to teach. As for myself, this jar suffices for my lifetime’s sleep. I need not trouble myself further.” Lao Jun had no words but to agree and said he would immediately prepare the chambers. Then he asked, “Master, living in this jar, is it not too uncomfortable? Why not come out for a walk?”

Iron Crutch Sir laughed heartily, “Old hero, do you think this jar cannot hold me? Let me play host and invite you all to visit my humble abode.” As he spoke, he stepped out of the jar’s mouth, waved to everyone, and said, “Please.” The Immortal Maiden led without hesitation and entered the jar’s mouth. Lao Jun and the others hesitated, but seeing the Immortal Maiden disappear instantly, they summoned courage and approached the jar’s mouth to look inside. Iron Crutch Sir raised his sleeve to shield their eyes, and they felt the world darken slightly. Their bodies had entered the jar, where they saw a realm beyond the mundane world—serene, spacious, and wondrously different. Ahead, the Immortal Maiden and Iron Crutch Sir stood together, beckoning them.

The three hurried forward. There, a giant leopard lay across the path. All were startled. Zhongli Quan was especially amazed, for he recognized this leopard as the very beast he had subdued and that the Immortal Maiden had brought home by magic. Since following Iron Crutch Sir home, he had not yet examined the leopard and wondered if Iron Crutch Sir had not brought it back but left it on the road. How, then, had it arrived first inside the jar? He quietly told his father. Lao Jun hastily said, “No need to say more! That must be the immortal master’s Daoist art. He has the power to alter paths near and far, to seize Heaven and Earth’s creation. What are such small matters?” Zhongli dared not speak further. As they talked, they reached the side of the Immortal Maiden and Iron Crutch Sir.

Iron Crutch Sir smiled and asked Zhongli Quan, “Do you see your leopard? Do not underestimate this beast. It has some worldly ties with you.” Before he finished, not only were the father, son, and sister bewildered, but even the Immortal Maiden was at a loss.

What sort of worldly ties Zhongli Quan might have with this beast—this will be revealed in the next chapter.
