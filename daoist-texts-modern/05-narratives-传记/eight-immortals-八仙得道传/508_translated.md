# Chapter Forty: On Past Lives’ Bonds Between Humans and Beasts — Unraveling Doubts, New Friends Are Old Acquaintances

Now it happened that the Immortal Maiden and the venerable Old Jun, father and son, listened intently as Master Iron Crutch recounted how the leopard and Zhongli Quan shared certain bonds from past lives. Their hearts brimmed with doubt, and they quickly asked the Immortal Master, “How can it be that these beasts also have ties with humans?” Master Iron Crutch smiled and said, “You shall know soon enough; no need for lengthy questions.” The company dared not press further.

After some time journeying through many places, all exquisitely beautiful, their eyes beheld flowers that never withered through the seasons, birds that sang harmoniously in winter and summer alike, and countless creatures never before seen by mortal eyes—each formed with perfect symmetry and exquisite grace. In short, none belonged to the human realm.

Master Iron Crutch pointed ahead to a small bridge and said, “There lies a flowing stream, and upon it a boat awaits. When we reach there, we shall board and cross to a certain house, which is but my humble abode. I have already ordered some refreshments prepared. Would you all indulge me with a brief gathering?” Old Jun and the Immortal Maiden were deeply moved and grateful. Zhongli Quan and his elder sister, the great Miss, were so delighted they leapt about. Zhongli Quan even embraced one of Iron Crutch’s short legs, calling out, “My Master, my good Master, how can you have such a wondrous place? If only I could follow you here and spend a lifetime!” Master Iron Crutch laughed and nodded, “That is no hardship. Once you have cultivated the dao of immortality, not only this little trifle but the entire cosmos will fit within your pocket. Such things are easy.”

Old Jun hastily scolded, “Child, do not pester so. If you vex the Master, he may cast you off.” Iron Crutch and the Immortal Maiden both smiled and stopped him, saying, “Children must be lively and spirited. Our Daoist path prizes the absence of guile. At this age, he is utterly free of cunning—what the Confucians call ‘the heart of a newborn.’ Confucius said, ‘In ancient times, Yu the Great ruled by non-action.’ This is the principle. Our Patriarch Li Laozi wrote the thirty chapters of the Dao De Jing, which emphasize non-action above all. Non-action means no scheming; once the mind schemes, countless changes arise, and how can one govern by non-action? Therefore, the cultivation of immortality is best begun in youth. One’s insight and grasp of the profound surpass that of adults, making the path far easier!” Old Jun ceased his objections.

The five companions reached the bridge’s edge. Though not wide, it was constructed without roots or seams, as if naturally formed by Heaven itself. The materials were strange and wondrous, unknown to mortal eyes, adorned with rare treasures and jewels. Zhongli Quan stood upon the bridge, running his hand over a pillar, laughing to his father, “This thing is quite amusing.”

Before he finished, Iron Crutch suddenly barked, “What is there to amuse? Even trifles can stir the heart. Once the heart stirs, it hinders cultivation. Is it worth becoming a Daoist if you cannot master your desires?” Zhongli Quan was startled, quickly withdrawing his hand and composing himself. “Master, I have never cared for toys. Just now, seeing something new, I spoke without thinking. Please forgive me.” Iron Crutch smiled and said, “Did I not say cultivation depends on a still heart? When the heart stirs, demons arise, and achievement is forever lost. You say you marvel at the unseen, but such wonder is unworthy of a cultivator. Remember this caution henceforth.”

The Immortal Maiden stood aside, nodding in admiration, stroking Zhongli Quan’s neck, and smiling, “This is the highest teaching of the Way. Good child, if you wish to learn the dao, first engrave this lesson deeply in your mind. Pursuing the final step, you must not even remember this teaching, for to remember it is itself a form of intention!” Master Iron Crutch heard and nodded with approval.

They boarded the prepared boat, rowed by two women. The five descended and pushed off, swiftly drifting downstream. Before long, they arrived at the house Iron Crutch had indicated. “Here we are. Let us disembark,” he said. The two women drew the boat close, and the five stepped ashore. Though not vast, the house was exquisitely built, its upper and lower sections joined seamlessly like the bridge, without a trace of patchwork. Iron Crutch claimed it as his own and invited the four guests inside, where servants of both genders came bustling forth to attend.

He led them into a tiny study of unparalleled refinement and antique elegance. Once seated, he turned to Zhongli Quan and said, “You must understand why the leopard shares a bond with you. Come, look and see.” Zhongli Quan laughed, “I have always doubted why a good man would have ties with such a beast.” Iron Crutch said nothing but drew from his sleeve a small gourd, pierced with a tiny hole just large enough for two eyes to peer through. “Child, come look inside. What do you see?”

Zhongli Quan obeyed, peering through the hole. Within, he saw a palace atop a high mountain, surrounded by what seemed an immense garden. The scene was far more elaborate than what had been glimpsed before, with many immortals riding clouds and mist, coming and going. In the palace’s main hall sat an old immortal whose face was strangely familiar yet unplaceable. Around him stood many immortals listening to his teachings; Iron Crutch himself was among them.

The old immortal first sent Iron Crutch down to the mortal realm, then soon followed. Before departing, he entrusted a young attendant with the care of his green ox, warning him to be cautious. Yet, once the old immortal left, the attendant went off to play with other children in the garden. After a while, he led the ox into the garden, and they played games. The ox, disobedient, was struck several times by the attendant, provoking its nature. It then fled to the mortal world, causing great calamities.

Most strange was that the ox first arrived at a place resembling the mountain behind Zhongli Quan’s own village. There, somehow, it became friendly with a leopard, often going out and returning together, sleeping and rising side by side. The leopard later bore a cub, and the ox abandoned it, moving on to another place where it transformed into a human form, seducing women. It even took away their true husbands, disguising itself as their spouse, drinking and reveling with these women. This enraged a Daoist maiden who came to confront it—remarkably, this Daoist maiden’s appearance and attire were exactly like the Immortal Maiden who had come with them. This revelation nearly made Zhongli Quan cry out in terror.

Master Iron Crutch smiled slightly and asked what he had seen. Zhongli Quan suddenly raised his head, glancing at the Immortal Maiden and then back at the maiden in the vision. Iron Crutch laughed, “Could it be she is also there?” Zhongli Quan said nothing but continued to watch. He saw the Daoist maiden unable to subdue the ox, until another fairy came to rescue her. Meanwhile, the ox’s master, the old immortal, sent another attendant to bring the ox back to the palace, demoting the original attendant to the mortal realm, where he was reborn into a family. The child’s appearance and form were exactly Zhongli Quan’s own, without the slightest difference. Even the child’s parents and elder sister were precisely his own family.

This astonished Zhongli Quan beyond measure. He cried out, nearly dropping the gourd. Old Jun and the Immortal Maiden were alarmed and asked what fearful vision had so shaken him. Only Master Iron Crutch smiled faintly and said nothing.

Zhongli Quan held the gourd silently, no longer looking or speaking, lost in thought. After a long while, his heart was fully enlightened. Suddenly tears poured like rain, and he wailed in sorrow, falling at Iron Crutch’s feet, unwilling to rise. Iron Crutch laughed and helped him up, comforting him, “Do you now understand your own origin? Do you grasp why you came to the mortal realm?”

Zhongli Quan stood, wiping his tears. “I understand fully. I was well in the celestial palace but carelessly caused great calamity and was exiled to the mortal world. How can I not regret it? I beseech the Immortal Master’s mercy to grant me salvation, so I may return to Heaven. That alone would satisfy me.”

Iron Crutch smiled, “Go ask this Master if the scenes you saw in the gourd are true.” Zhongli Quan earnestly questioned the Immortal Maiden about the ox-taming episode. She too was greatly astonished. Iron Crutch then bade Zhongli Quan look again inside the gourd. Zhongli Quan said, “There is still one thing unclear: is the leopard born of that ox the very beast we captured today?”

Iron Crutch laughed, “If not, how could it be called a bond from past lives?” Zhongli Quan laughed in turn.

The Immortal Maiden seemed to understand and asked Zhongli Quan, “Surely that leopard was born of the ox I subdued, was it not?” Zhongli Quan replied, “Indeed it was.” She said no more.

Zhongli Quan resumed peering into the gourd. The story continued: a leopard cub lived with its mother in the mountains. The mother was killed by humans, leaving the cub to roam alone. It grew up hunting fat beasts but never harmed a person.

Zhongli Quan muttered to himself, “No wonder I survived today. Since this beast was brought by my Master, it must have some destiny.” The others heard him mumble and were puzzled.

Zhongli Quan looked further and saw his own growth and the events of capturing the leopard and meeting the Immortal Maiden, until they returned home together and encountered Iron Crutch, who took the leopard under his care. The gourd then turned pitch black, revealing nothing more.

Iron Crutch took back the gourd and handed it to the Immortal Maiden. “Dao sister, look here. Within lies some truths that may tell you a story.” She smiled, peering into the gourd’s mouth, seeing her own story unfold. Most astonishing was the episode after parting from Li Xuan, showing the transformation into Iron Crutch. Only then did she realize Iron Crutch’s true identity: he was none other than the former Li Xuan himself.

Seeing clearly, the Immortal Maiden turned and smiled at him, “So you are Brother Li indeed. No wonder you speak of deep ties from past lives. Beyond you, there is no other. But you have changed your form and name so much—how was I to recognize you?” Iron Crutch laughed heartily.

The Immortal Maiden and Zhongli Quan then recounted all they had seen in the gourd to Old Jun and his daughter. Iron Crutch laughed, “Now that you all understand, there is no reason to linger. Let us return.” Saying this, he raised his staff and struck the gourd. A thunderous crack echoed, startling all. When they regained their senses, they found themselves back in Zhongli Quan’s hall. Reflecting on the visions, it seemed but a strange dream. They bowed once more to Iron Crutch, thanking him for his guidance.

Iron Crutch stayed at Zhongli Quan’s home, discussing the dao morning and evening with the Immortal Maiden and Zhongli Quan. The Immortal Maiden repeatedly asked about rescuing Master Liu and seeking Fei Changfang. Iron Crutch only said, “Patience, it will be no trouble.” After three days, the Immortal Maiden ceased asking. Iron Crutch suddenly smiled at her, “Fei Changfang will surely return today. Why do you wish to see him?”

She replied, “There is no great matter. Last time, when troubled by the bandit Zhao, he helped me with the art of swift travel. Though a small kindness, it moved me, especially as he has fellow practitioners. This Master was captured by bandits; his fate is unknown. I must inform him. Besides, this trouble began with me alone. If I stand aside, how can my conscience bear it?”

Iron Crutch nodded and smiled. “I will tell you: Fei Changfang’s swift travel technique was taught by me. Seeing the attendant’s demotion to the mortal realm, I petitioned the Patriarch to allow me, as a fellow disciple, to assist his cultivation. If he studies diligently, his merit may one day equal ours—not just a mere herdsman. If so, it is truly a blessing in disguise. Whether he succeeds depends on his own cultivation. Should he stray from the true dao, indulge in worldly desires, and harm his nature, he will not only fail to achieve immortality but fill his karmic debts, perhaps even seek death in vain, only to fall into the beastly paths after death, unable to return to human form. How dreadful! I feared such danger, so I hurried to observe his condition in youth, taking care of many mundane matters, including your affairs, sister. Before you came here, did the Master mention me?”

The Immortal Maiden answered, “He spoke of Li Xuan, but never of your change of form and name. So when we met, we did not recognize each other. Were it not for your revealing the cause and effect in the gourd, it might still be a mystery.”

Iron Crutch laughed again. “I have been here long enough to see that Zhongli’s child is brave, filial, and loyal—a rare talent for immortality. I awaited your arrival so you two might meet before proceeding, and I have also rescued that leopard. This creature not only shares bonds with Zhongli Quan but is almost my peer in age. We are all fellow disciples. I have learned it has not harmed humans. Such wildness combined with good knowledge is rare indeed. The extraordinary, whether in person or beast, is precious. That is why I placed it in my gourd, intending to train and elevate it. Perhaps it will become a mount or find another path upward. Its good nature shall not be wasted.” All nodded in approval.

Old Jun sighed, “If beasts can refrain from killing, the Master will aid them. Yet I, a human, harbor ambitions and have slain countless wild beasts. What suffering awaits me?” He patted his son’s back and laughed, “Good child, if you truly honor your father, cultivate the dao swiftly and perform merit for me, to atone for past misdeeds.”

Zhongli Quan took his father’s words seriously. “Father, rest assured. Though young, my resolve surpasses many adults. Having vowed to become a monk, even if they kill me or rip out my heart, I shall not fear. I must complete the dao before returning to you. If I waver or quit, I beg my Master to strike me down with thunder and fire. I will bear no complaint.”

Old Jun was moved to tears by his son’s resolute words. Iron Crutch laughed heartily, “With such resolve, how can you fail? Yet your words contain a paradox. Only by preserving the heart of a newborn can one seek the path of immortality. After maturity, knowledge grows, and worldly temptations increase daily, becoming the greatest obstacle to enlightenment. I hope you remain forever a child at heart, even when grown. Only then will your efforts be doubly fruitful. You have a foundation of immortal fate and such focus and diligence. I guarantee that within fifty years you will have achieved more than half your merit. Then, when you return home, you may even lead your father to become an earth immortal.”

The father and son rejoiced greatly. Iron Crutch continued, “Now I tell you, Fei Changfang met me by chance. Seeing his talent, I sent him on a mission. You have heard the tale of the cruel Qin Emperor’s tyranny during your two days here. Such deeds cannot end well. Yet his heart is insatiable, seeking the Golden Elixir and the Great Dao. On his last eastern tour to Mount Tai, I sent a disciple to seize his white seal. This time, when he sent offerings to the Yellow River, I dispatched Fei Changfang to return the seal, warning him with four words: ‘The destroyer of Qin is Hu.’ This Hu is not the barbarian Hu, but a secret heavenly plan not to be revealed. Yet he misunderstood and now the strongest of the Hu, the Xiongnu, roam the northern steppes. He has ordered General Meng Tian to conscript peasants to build a great wall stretching from the East Sea to the western Kunlun Mountains, also called the Heavenly Mountains, over four thousand li long. This has caused widespread resentment and misery.”

At these words, the Immortal Maiden nodded and sighed, “So this is the cruel governance. No wonder when I first reached the capital, I saw the people frowning and troubled, as if burdened by great sorrow. It must be this matter.” Iron Crutch nodded and spoke further.

What happened next remains unknown—await the next chapter to unfold.
