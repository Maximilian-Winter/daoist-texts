# Chapter Forty-One: Building the Great Wall to Guard Against the Tyrant Hu and a Child’s Encounter with a Monster

Now, it happened that Master Iron Crutch spoke to Immortal Maiden He, saying: “At that time, my heart was filled with boundless unease over this matter. I even sent my soul to Kunlun to petition the Patriarch, only to learn that the merit and harm of the Great Wall were both of a moment and yet extended for myriad generations. It was the destiny of the Qin sovereign that would not endure long; Heaven’s heart grew weary and, through his hand, allowed this great work to be wrought. Though the people suffered grievously, it was truly pitiable, yet without such a monumental labor, the world could not quickly fall into chaos, the True Lord could not arise, and the people’s suffering in fire and water would be hard to transcend. Better then to shift this calamity into the building of the wall. Once the calamity of the wall was complete, the tyrant’s evil would be full, the people’s hanging peril resolved. Truly, this was the cunning of creation—harming to save, a marvel beyond measure. Having received this revelation, I returned to the capital, where Changfang begged earnestly for deliverance. Seeing his sincere heart, I devised a stratagem. At that time, the court was conscripting laborers everywhere, so I transformed into a public official and went to his home, delivering a letter to sever their hopes—telling them Changfang had already been conscripted.”

Immortal Maiden He laughed upon hearing this and said, “So that is why, when I personally visited the Fei family that day, they showed such strange behavior. They were timid, fearing that misfortune might again befall others, so they kept their heads down, afraid to provoke trouble. Pray tell, Brother, where is Changfang now?”

Master Iron Crutch replied: “The Great Wall is now under construction, and I hear it must be finished by a set deadline, so the need for laborers is truly great—some hundreds of thousands are indispensable. In the north, there is a pitiable woman whose wedding day approaches. Somehow, a villain caught sight of her beauty and reported to the court. The unrighteous, foolish emperor decreed she be taken as a concubine. The woman remained steadfast, refusing to yield. The Qin emperor was furious and had her husband’s name registered among the conscripts sent to build the wall. Alas, the man was weak in body and spirit—how could he endure such harsh labor? Moreover, the emperor sought to oppose him but lacked grounds to execute him, so he merely conscripted him. Had there been cause, his life would have been ended long ago. Yet in this state, his life was more perilous than other strong laborers. Others had strength and no enemies; once the work was done, they could return home. But this man was powerless and had a formidable foe. There, he needed only to be accused of laziness to be beaten day and night, left for dead. The woman, full of resolve and talent, knew her husband had no hope of survival. Meanwhile, the court daily sent envoys to persuade her to abandon her husband and accept the wealth and honor of becoming a concubine. Knowing her husband’s fate was sealed, she feigned willingness to enter the palace, only asking to escort her husband to the north to fulfill their conjugal duty. The officials relayed this to the foolish emperor, who consented. To assure her husband’s family, she personally visited them, pleading to hasten the wedding that very day so they might travel together—thus avoiding suspicion of impropriety on the road and dispelling doubts of her changing heart. Her husband’s family, moved by her fidelity and sincerity, agreed. After the wedding, the next day they set out together. Because she was to be a palace woman, guards accompanied them along the way. She displayed her future status as imperial consort and protected her husband at every turn. This couple was now in dire straits. I had already calculated that neither would survive this journey, yet one of our fellow Daoists, moved by their bitter fidelity, stubbornly defied Heaven. This person is now in Youzhou, locked in stalemate with the palace folk. Truly, this is all futile. I could not abandon my Dao friend, nor could I ignore the woman’s lonely, bitter resolve. I must also leave some memorial of her in the human world; moreover, I intend to gather her soul and spirit, to await her rebirth. If she has the fate of immortality, I can then nurture her accordingly. I have now sent Changfang to handle this, but fearing his Dao power is insufficient and the matter may not be properly managed, I shall wait for the right moment and then go myself with my junior sister.”

Immortal Maiden He rejoiced, saying: “Such a woman exists in the world! To be able to save and deliver her is truly fortunate. I beg Brother, please take me along—do not go alone.” Master Iron Crutch laughed: “What harm is there? Not only may you go, but if A Quan wishes to come along for a little adventure, that is no problem either!” When Zhongli Quan heard he could accompany them, he was so delighted he could hardly speak. Immortal Maiden He then asked: “The Qin emperor is so cruel. If Brother’s Dao magic could slay him with a single sword, would that not remove a great harm from the people? Why toil in bits and pieces, laboring so hard over such matters?”

Master Iron Crutch laughed heartily, looking to Heaven: “Junior sister, you have cultivated the Dao for many years, yet do you not understand the principle of kalpa? Wherever a kalpa lies, do not speak of avoiding it; at best, one can only reduce its scale and shorten its span, but even that is impossible. The Qin emperor was born cruel by nature and certainly did no good, yet this was not his own doing. To be honest, he was born to fulfill the kalpa, acting as its agent in motion. Even as emperor, he could not control himself—how much less others?” Immortal Maiden He suddenly understood. From then on, Iron Crutch devoted himself to instructing Zhongli Quan and carefully pointed out the places where Immortal Maiden He had not yet reached. Fortunately, Immortal Maiden He had a solid foundation, and Zhongli Quan had karmic ties; both were quick to learn. Within a few days, they attained some real skill.

One day, Master Iron Crutch suddenly said to the two: “Fei Changfang is almost here. A Quan, go meet him.” Zhongli Quan was startled and said: “I do not know Changfang, nor where he is coming from. How can I meet him?” Iron Crutch scolded: “So many words! I tell you to go, so just go—what need is there for questions?” Zhongli Quan dared not argue and gloomily left the house, thinking: The master said Changfang went north, so surely he is now coming south. I should go north to meet him. But there are many roads north; I do not know which one he takes. What to do?

After hesitating a while, he suddenly thought: The master’s words, though false, have reason. I will not fret. I will cast a divination to Heaven and simply follow the road north as it is. Having decided, he set off northward. From noon until evening, he walked. As night fell, a great mountain blocked the way. To proceed, he must cross it. Zhongli Quan, still childlike in heart, did not consider how high the mountain was or how far the path. Relying only on his two feet, he did not know how many days it would take to cross the peak. He carried no food; if hunger came, where would he find sustenance? Nor did he carry any weapon. If he met wild beasts, he could not rely on fists alone. These many difficulties he had not considered, but still he summoned courage and stepped onto the mountain path.

After much walking, night was fully dark. Though moonlight shone, the wind was strong and clouds thick, letting only faint light through the layers. The trees on the mountain were indistinct; directions were lost. Zhongli Quan felt somewhat uneasy here, but he was an extraordinarily tough child. Since birth, he had faced countless dangers and hardships without a single complaint or tear. Now he bowed to his immortal master, his faith unwavering. No matter how dire the situation, he trusted his master would never deceive him. Standing alone in the wilderness, he looked up to see the stars and moon dimmed, glanced sideways at dense trees and deep mountains, and strained to listen. Only the howls of foxes and wolves, the cries of strange birds, reached his ears—each sound chilling and sharp. Then came a piercing, mournful cry unlike any he had heard before. Zhongli Quan listened a while and then laughed aloud: “Father once said the mountain is full of vengeful ghosts—souls eaten by tigers and leopards. Father saw them and said they appeared strange and terrifying. Alas, I have rarely run far enough to see what they look like. Perhaps what I hear now is just such creatures. I will see them for myself and open my eyes.” Thinking so, his spirit lifted. Though his belly was a little hungry, he no longer felt it.

Following the sounds, he came to a mountain hollow. Suddenly the moonlight brightened, shining pure and clear. Beneath it, he saw a figure with disheveled hair and bare feet—human in form but with a round shape, beastlike yet standing upright on two feet—bowing repeatedly to the moonlight. Zhongli Quan thought: This must be the creature making the calls. Bowing to the moon, is it trying to cultivate some elixir or refine some method? How strange that such a hideous thing as this hopes to become an immortal! How laughable! Thinking this, he could not help but laugh aloud.

This laugh, though small, startled the monster into jumping several paces. Zhongli Quan, wanting to see what it would do next, hid behind a large tree he could embrace, peeking through the branches. The monster looked around wildly, then suddenly turned its face toward Zhongli Quan. Now the moonlight was brighter, revealing the monster’s face—strange and terrifying beyond measure. It was human-shaped but had a face covered in white fur, with two gleaming green orbs for eyes. It glanced several times toward Zhongli Quan, who, brave as he was, shivered. Finding no one, the monster turned away and resumed its work. Zhongli Quan, mischievous as ever, thought: Those green orbs are so strange—if I could dig them out and bring them to my sister, they would make fine earrings. Thinking this, he laughed heartily again.

This laugh was ill-timed. The monster heard it clearly and ceased looking around. It turned swiftly and leapt toward Zhongli Quan. Its movement was unlike a normal person’s; a black furry shape swept forward like a whirlwind. In a flash, it crossed the trees, spreading two waxy, skeletal arms to seize Zhongli Quan. As it approached, Zhongli Quan saw its face was smeared with fresh blood, dripping all the way down. Its stench was unbearable, and its tongue dragged a foot long, resembling the image of a strangled ghost told in folk tales. Zhongli Quan, though chilled, grew angry at this assault and shouted: “What ghostly thing are you? How dare you attack your young master?”

This shout bolstered his courage. The monster seemed caught in a whirlwind and involuntarily stepped back ten paces. Zhongli Quan grew more confident, seeing its retreat. Disgusted by its filth and stench, he fought barehanded. As the monster withdrew, he broke off a branch and, before it could charge again, swept it aside. The monster, knowing it could not resist, shook its head, uttering a harsh, rattling cry unlike before.

Zhongli Quan laughed: “What luck! Today I see a ghost at last.” Before he finished, the ghost turned and fled. Yet Zhongli Quan’s leg skills were no ordinary child’s. Though he lacked the swift ‘earth-shrinking’ technique, he could keep pace with the ghost’s whirlwind flight. In a moment, he overtook a small hill. Seeing the distance was not far, he raised the branch and struck at the ghost’s head. With a crash, the ghost dissolved into fragrant smoke, vanishing without a trace, its stench gone. In an instant, it reappeared beneath a tree ahead, in the same form, kneeling and bowing profusely.

Zhongli Quan laughed: “You strange thing, three parts not human, seven parts not ghost, and yet you know fear? Since you know fear, I need not be your enemy. But you must show me a way out. I intend to go north. If you can guide me, I shall be grateful. When I advance in the Dao and become immortal, I will repay you handsomely.”

The monster seemed to understand and suddenly rolled over beside Zhongli Quan, bowing its head to the ground with chuckling sounds. After a while, it rose and, catching the wind, rolled northward. Zhongli Quan followed. Around midnight, the monster stopped, pointed north three times, then turned back and bowed again. Zhongli Quan laughed: “You must be eager to return before dawn, for you are a ghost and cannot bear the light, yes?” The monster nodded.

Now Zhongli Quan felt pity for it and said kindly: “Go then. If I make progress, I will not forget your guidance. But you must strive to be a loyal and kind ghost—do not frighten or harm the people, nor disturb travelers. That is most important. Also, whether you are ghost or demon, since you cannot speak, I cannot know. But you must have a name. When I seek you again, call to you three times on this mountain peak under the moonlight. You must come out to meet me—no mistakes. If you fail, misfortune is yours alone, not mine. We met on this moonlit mountain; I shall name you ‘Mountain Moon.’ Remember it well. Now go! I must hurry to find a place with people, beg some food, and fill my belly before traveling.”

The monster suddenly tugged at his clothes. Zhongli Quan laughed: “Have you prepared some food for me?” The monster nodded. Zhongli Quan rejoiced: “Excellent! Then quickly bring it. I shall wait here.” The monster flew off like the wind. Zhongli Quan chuckled: “This ghost is quite amusing.” He wandered the mountain alone for some time. As dawn approached, the moon hid behind dark clouds, and the mountain scenery vanished. He grew anxious for the monster.

Just as he hesitated, a strange rattling sound came. He laughed: “Good, it has hurried back.” Before he finished, a whirlwind rose at his feet. Looking down, he saw a black furry thing crouching beside him. Zhongli Quan asked: “Friend, have you brought the food?” The monster croaked a few times and held out a large barley cake, hard as stone, in one hairy hand, and a bamboo jar of water in the other.

Zhongli Quan laughed: “Thank you! It is a pity we cannot speak. If we could, you might tell me if there are any villages nearby.” The monster shook its head and spread its hands wide, meaning villages exist but not close. Zhongli Quan understood and was about to ask more when the monster bowed again and flew away like the wind. Zhongli Quan sighed: “It is a ghost and cannot see daylight. I, foolishly, have taken its kindness and yet linger. If I delay its time, the fault is mine.”

Dear reader, human abilities are always limited. Zhongli Quan, though strong-willed, was but a child who had walked all day and night without rest, hungry and thirsty, soon unable to endure. Having received water and barley cakes, his worries vanished. He chose a large stone to sit upon and consumed the food and drink. Seeing the sky not yet bright, he laughed: “This black ghost has troubled me all night. Dawn is not yet here. I shall rest a while longer.” Saying so, he lay down on the stone and fell fast asleep. Children sleep deeply; once fallen into slumber, even blows cannot wake them. Zhongli Quan slept until dusk, when the sky darkened again. He rolled over, sat up, rubbed his eyes, and looked at the sky in shock: “Have I slept a whole day? This is a grave mistake. If I miss Fei Changfang, how can I face my master?” Thinking so, he was lost in thought when suddenly a fierce wind arose, swirling sand and stones with unstoppable force.

Zhongli Quan, having grown up among wild beasts, knew well what this meant. Seeing the wind, he immediately understood it was no ordinary breeze but heralded the approach of tigers or leopards. He laughed: “These beasts are unlucky indeed. Had I still been sleeping an hour ago, ten bodies would have been devoured. They waited until I rose—just as they deserve their plague.” Though he spoke boldly, he dared not be careless. He roused his spirit, grasped a handful of stones, and prepared to strike the eyes of any fierce beast that came, a family technique of precise stone-throwing, never missing its mark. Zhongli Quan was brave beyond measure; tigers and leopards were nothing to him. Yet this was the first time he took such precautions, knowing he was in hostile territory and must not be careless.

Yet, the world’s affairs are most unpredictable. The more careful you are, the more sudden the misfortune that arises. Zhongli Quan waited long, then suddenly heard a whoosh behind him. Turning quickly, he saw a small figure already carried aloft by the beast behind, soaring through clouds and mist, rising into the sky.

What became of his fate is unknown. We shall see in the next chapter.
