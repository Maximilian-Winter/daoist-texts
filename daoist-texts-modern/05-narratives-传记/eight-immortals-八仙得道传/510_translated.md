# Chapter Forty-Two: Zhongli Encounters the Divine Beast, The Emperor Finds a Worthy Disciple

Meanwhile, Zhongli Quan was cautiously on guard, never imagining that something would silently strike from behind. Before he could even launch a stone attack, he was gently lifted up, thunder and lightning flashing as they soared into the sky. In an instant, they vanished into the swirling clouds and mist. Only then did Zhongli Quan grow somewhat alarmed, yet his stubborn spirit forbade tears; the more perilous the situation, the more he forced himself to appear calm and carefree. Besides, he had recently taken an immortal as his master, who came and went on clouds and mist with such ease—how he envied that freedom! His one secret hope was to learn this very art of cloud-riding, for even the earth-shrinking technique of his elder branch seemed too slow and impractical. This thought had lingered for many days, and now, in this moment of danger, fate was first teaching him the taste of soaring on clouds.

Zhongli Quan was truly mischievous. Immediately, he formed a thought: “This journey is fraught with danger; my life is likely to be devoured by this demon beast. But since it knows the art of cloud-riding, I might as well enjoy the thrill of flight before I die.” With that, he worried the path might be too short, arriving too quickly at the beast’s lair. He hastily patted the creature twice and said, “Good friend, I know you’re quite fond of me. I’m willing to offer my body as a little snack, so you need not fear I’ll escape to the ends of the heavens. Why rush so swiftly? Take it slow, let me enjoy the sights of the sky; you won’t be so exhausted, and both of us will benefit. Isn’t that better?”

As he spoke, he knew well it was idle talk. While saying it, he anxiously scanned the surroundings above and below. Above, the sky stretched endlessly, shrouded in drifting clouds and mist. Here and there appeared strange pavilions, flying springs, and uncanny trees. In his heart, he thought these must be the abodes of heavenly immortals, and no longer did he envy them. Seeing this, he prepared to look down upon the mortal realm, just as he finished his request to the beast. It seemed to understand and granted his wish, slowing its flight to a gentle, steady pace.

Zhongli Quan was both startled and delighted, unable to help but laugh aloud: “No wonder my grandmother always said my fate was to turn misfortune into blessing, that in danger good people would come to aid me. But now it seems not only good people, even demons and beasts have some friendship with me!” Settling his heart, he stroked the beast’s neck fur in thanks for its kindness, then calmly gazed down upon the world below. He saw vast stretches of scorched earth, barren and lifeless; dense human settlements flourishing with verdant forests; towering mountains; and deep, winding rivers. For a moment, it seemed they passed over a great sea, with sky above and water below, reflecting each other so perfectly that no boundary could be discerned. Floating within, it felt like being enclosed inside a great round vessel. When the sea breeze stirred, the sinking sunset and the rising pale moon—one red, one white—were mirrored beneath the waves, tossed by the rolling surf like turning wheels, one after another. Truly, a magnificent spectacle of Heaven and Earth, a wondrous scene beyond the world.

Zhongli Quan was so entranced he forgot himself. His childish nature flared up; sitting atop the beast, he waved his arms and shouted loudly, completely forgetting his peril and the pain of this journey. He wished he could negotiate with the beast to stay and play for ten days or half a month, then willingly offer his body as a delicacy, dying without regret. But the beast had little patience. Seeing his wild antics, it suddenly grew angry, tightened its hooves, and surged upward into the murky darkness. Zhongli Quan felt a chill; beyond the swirling mist, the sea view vanished, and no matter how he tried, he saw nothing else. In his frustration, cursing his ill fate, he suddenly looked up and saw a vast city rising before him. Within the city stood many majestic palaces towering into the clouds. The beast carried him straight into the city, heading directly for the central great hall.

At this, Zhongli Quan felt relief: “Lately, I’ve often encountered immortals; this must be their abode. The beast means well to bring me here to enjoy myself. Otherwise, why not have devoured me early or dragged me back to its lair? It’s just a pity it flew so fast—passing through bustling markets without letting me examine the immortal city’s scenes. That’s truly a loss.” As he thought this, the beast suddenly squatted low; Zhongli Quan lost his balance and tumbled to the ground. Opening his eyes and looking around, he realized they had arrived at the great hall. The hall’s appearance defied description—its layout, exquisite and magnificent, was beyond words. Yet he nodded in admiration, finding it a vast and fascinating place, and silently thanked the demon beast.

While he lingered, someone appeared, dressed in garments somewhat like those of a mortal imperial palace. Being from the capital, Zhongli Quan recognized the palace and its attire, though this person’s clothing was somewhat looser and less formal. The man approached the hall’s courtyard, smiled at Zhongli Quan, and beckoned, saying, “The Emperor commands you to enter. Be careful, no mischief—understand?” Then he came close, lightly tapping him and asked, “After such a rough ride, aren’t you tired?”

Zhongli Quan felt as if in a dream, unsure what was happening or where he was. But he thought, the beast that carried him must have been sent by the Emperor to welcome him. If so, there was no danger at all. Glancing back at the beast, he saw it was a huge white tiger with piercing eyes and a white forehead—a formidable kind of tiger. Riding such a beast through the night made him shudder in retrospect.

The man saw Zhongli Quan staring at the tiger and laughed: “Do you still plan to ask it to take you back? Don’t worry, after you meet the Emperor, he will surely have a way to send you home.” Zhongli Quan smiled quietly, no longer arguing, and followed the man through several palace halls until they reached a small side chamber. There, a dignified figure sat, flanked by more than ten attendants standing silently on either side. Zhongli Quan did not know the official attire but felt no clothing could be more splendid and solemn. In his heart, he thought, “This must be the Emperor.” So, cautiously, he followed the man closer to the hall’s steps. The man entered first, seemingly to announce his arrival.

The Emperor held a book with a yellow face and white core, as if consulting some matter. Hearing the announcement, he smiled and said, “Bring him in.” The man descended, pulled Zhongli Quan onto the courtyard steps, and ordered him to kneel and bow. The Emperor commanded him to stand, and Zhongli Quan rose to thank him.

The Emperor beckoned him closer. Zhongli Quan then saw clearly that the Emperor was a fair-faced, long-bearded deity with a kindly expression, which emboldened him. Taking his small hand, the Emperor asked, “Are you Zhongli Quan? Is your master Li Xuan, also known as Iron Crutch?” Zhongli Quan answered each question.

The Emperor smiled: “Do you know who you were in your past life, and why you were banished to the mortal realm?” Zhongli Quan replied, “Recently, under the guidance of Master Iron Crutch, I have come to understand something of this.” The Emperor laughed: “Do you now wish to cultivate the dao?” Zhongli Quan hesitated, then smiled quietly, placing a small finger to his lips, his bright, round eyes sparkling with lively innocence. The Emperor and his attendants all smiled with delight.

The Emperor then instructed: “You are a person with immortal affinity. If you set your mind, your achievements will be twice as fast as ordinary people, and your future attainments may equal your master’s status, far beyond your past life, where you only managed your master’s mount. Your master likely has told you this.” Zhongli Quan merely smiled shyly, neither confident enough to claim such heights nor willing to accept a lowly fate. Hearing this, he remained silent.

The Emperor understood his meaning and laughed: “I see your spirit—you have ambition but do not boast. This is the foundation of entering the dao. But you must understand, though you call your senior brother Li Iron Crutch your master, there is a flaw: first, the seniority does not fit; second, by the usual reckoning, you should not be Iron Crutch’s disciple. You do not know this principle. Iron Crutch, though an immortal, is careless and wrongly claims the title of master. This is his fault.”

Hearing this, Zhongli Quan suddenly interrupted: “Master Li is so capable—why should he not be my teacher?” The Emperor smiled: “This is a principle you cannot understand now. To put it simply, all who enter immortality follow the same principle. Relationships of father and son, husband and wife, teacher and disciple, brother and friend are not formed by chance but are bound by fate. Now, though you and that master are not without affinity, he can only be your teacher in skills and knowledge. In reality, your true master is still Iron Crutch; but in name, let that master enjoy the honor. That person is none other than the Emperor sitting before you—your future master who will bring you forth from the world, raise you to Heaven, and guide you.”

Zhongli Quan suddenly understood the meaning. The attendants on either side urged him to quickly bow and accept the master’s title. Zhongli Quan was deeply confused and knelt but refused to bow immediately. In his heart, he thought, he had already taken a master, and that master was well. How could he take another master at home? If he did, would Master Li allow it? Moreover, according to the Emperor, he would still have to consult Master Li for teachings and methods. This matter seemed unfair to Master Li; what if he did not agree? How could he explain?

While pondering, the Emperor spoke again: “Child, do not hesitate. Your Master Li is merely careless now, neglecting some calculations. Once he understands this relationship, he himself will step back to the position of senior brother. But no matter what, this will only benefit your future and cause no harm. Think: having an additional master to guide you is not a bad thing. To be honest, you were banished by your patriarch for carelessly herding cattle. The root cause was your patriarch descending to the sea to rescue Li Iron Crutch. Iron Crutch saw you suffer because of him and could not rest; with their bond as fellow disciples, how could he not guide you? Not only him, but all the immortals of your patriarch’s lineage will look out for you, but only as protectors and teachers. Your true master is me, the Emperor. Now you may accept me as master. When you return, your master will surely understand. Once he understands, he will no longer claim the title of master, and you may still honor him as such. He will continue to instruct you in the dao and various magical arts. When you succeed in cultivation, you will be able to save me to Heaven.”

At this, the Emperor himself did not realize it, but many celestial officials nearby were struck dumb, falling prostrate in alarm. The Emperor was startled and asked, “Why do you all act so?” A celestial leader replied, “The sage speaks no jest nor error. Now the Emperor suddenly says that Zhongli Quan will save the Emperor to Heaven. We fear the sacred presence may have a concern about descending to the mortal realm.”

The Emperor thought for a moment, then stamped his foot in frustration and ordered, “Rise, all of you, and hear my words.” The officials stood and returned to their places. The Emperor sighed: “I often say the mortal world is full of wicked hearts and sins. I constantly seek ways to correct and enlighten. Such great matters cannot be done without personally descending. Perhaps I still have a karmic bond with all beings, fixed by fate. When I first attained the dao and ascended, I was aided by the Jade Emperor, taught and supported by Yuanshi and Laozi, and recommended by leaders like the Queen Mother of the West and the Mysterious Lady. I was granted equal status with the Jade Emperor’s incarnation, the Great Emperor Perfected Martial, honored with the title of Emperor, entrusted for tens of thousands of years. Yet I have no merit or virtue. It is rare to have such a destiny to descend again, to inspect the customs and morals of the present world, to establish ten thousand years of moral teaching. I believe this work is no less than Laozi’s repeated mortal incarnations, his scriptures and teachings, or Confucius’s words and example for generations. How could it be compared to the idle Eastern Emperor who sits long in the heavenly palace, dead to merit? I have resolved to wait until Zhongli Quan becomes immortal, then personally descend again to be saved by him. Our master-disciple bond will be a tale for ten thousand years. I hope you all will not worry for me.”

The celestial officials, hearing this, were filled with joy and sincerity, bowing in unison: “We did not expect the Emperor to have such great resolve. This is like the Buddha Tathāgata’s vow, ‘If I do not enter Hell, who will?’ and the great virtue of the ancient sage who said, ‘If one man is hungry or drowning, it is my fault.’ How can such great merit be compared to mere cultivation? We believe one golden immortal in Heaven is no match for one sage on Earth. When your term is fulfilled and you return to Heaven, the Jade Emperor will surely rely on you more. What harm could there be to the Emperor? This is truly the fortune of all beings and the Emperor’s greatest virtue. Without divine wisdom and sage insight, who could turn calamity into blessing and walk through disaster as if on level ground? We, humble immortals, are ashamed to have doubted your heart.”

The Emperor quickly said, “You all have accumulated virtue and merit, cultivating yourselves to attain immortality. How could you not wish to aid the world? My concern is only that mortal hearts have grown too worldly, with too much ceremony and too little feeling, cunning and deceit increasing day by day. If this continues, human hearts will become beastly, customs will grow depraved, and unprecedented calamities will arise. I have long held a high position, yet feel ashamed for not helping in times of hardship. To descend and act as I can may yet redeem some faults. If compared to the Buddha, Li the Patriarch, Confucius, and ancient sages, how dare I claim such merit?” The officials praised him again.

Zhongli Quan listened carefully, now fully understanding this was the Eastern Emperor. Greatly reverent, he no longer hesitated but bowed deeply several times. The Emperor laughed heartily. The celestial officials also laughed: “Surely the child reveres the Emperor’s virtue and cannot help but sincerely submit.” The Emperor then instructed: “Your Master Li is a man of foresight. Nothing of today’s matter escapes him, but heavenly secrets must not be revealed; to do so would be a grave sin. Be cautious and do not speak recklessly.”

Zhongli Quan bowed and accepted the command. The Emperor continued: “Are you here to await Fei Changfang coming from the north by Master Li’s order? That man has already arrived at your home. You need not return; go directly to Youzhou. When your master, Miss He, and Fei Changfang all arrive, you will meet. There is a matter you must settle, and some comrades are imprisoned and must be rescued quickly. Go now.” Zhongli Quan asked, “When I arrive in Youzhou, where should I find my masters?” The Emperor smiled: “Your master’s power is great; how could he fail to find you? To be honest, Master Li sent you to receive Fei Changfang to test your courage and heart. You are fierce by nature, having slain many beasts, caring little for danger. This time, you have faced some fright and surprises to test whether you still lack compassion and remain reckless and violent. Luckily, you have patience and handled matters well. Otherwise, after meeting that monster, even greater dangers awaited. Master Li calculated that Fei Changfang’s return would help you escape, so he sent you to meet him, who will bring you home.”

Zhongli Quan laughed in sudden understanding. The Emperor added: “But to flatter mountain demons and ghosts, letting them join your ranks, hoping to gain progress and promising them benefits—this is childish arrogance. You forget your position. Learning a few incantations without mastering even the basics of nurturing life and self-preservation, you think to be a teacher and save others? This invites ridicule and distracts the mind. A divided heart cannot master the dao; you cannot protect yourself, let alone others. I do not single out last night’s matter, which arose by chance and out of compassion. I speak now to warn you against rashly taking disciples and spreading dao to evildoers, causing chaos and bloodshed. You would be the first sinner, and your master and I would share responsibility. This is a grave matter. Do not take it lightly!”

Zhongli Quan shuddered and said, “I am young and ignorant of these dangers. Even if I gain power, I will not kill recklessly. Though I promised to save that demon ghost, I must break my word with it. Such beings are wild; if they cause trouble, not only I but my two masters will share the blame. This would be a lifelong worry.” The Emperor smiled: “A person without faith cannot stand. Since you sincerely promised, how could you prepare to break your word? Fortunately, that creature, though accepted by you, is not so fortunate. Rest assured, it will not harm you. Just be especially careful in the future.”

Zhongli Quan pledged obedience and asked, “Is that creature a demon or a ghost?” The Emperor said, “A thousand years ago, an evil man was sent by the Great Emperor Perfected Martial’s black tiger to be devoured. His ghost lingers in the mountains, appearing and vanishing. Though he harms little, those who meet him are frightened and fall ill. Now, having received sunlight, his eyes shine, and he can gather soul energy to form human shape. In a hundred years, his elixir will mature, and even without guidance, he will become a minor power. But his nature remains fierce; even with cultivation, his temperament is hard to change. You must watch him carefully.”

Zhongli Quan bowed again to receive the command. The Emperor said, “You have stayed long enough here. Do not linger. Use your original mount to go to Youzhou.” Zhongli Quan begged, “That tiger is unruly; please grant me a divine wind to speed my journey.” The Emperor laughed: “Do not underestimate that tiger. It is a thousand times older than you. How can you command it? Still, I know you long to try the taste of cloud-riding. For the sake of master and disciple, I will teach you the cloud-riding technique. This is no ordinary art. At first, you need no incantations or mysterious skills—just where your heart wills, your feet will rise. In one hour, you can travel a hundred thousand li, rivaling your Master Iron Crutch. Such a great method is not usually taught to beginners, but since your heart is pure and kind, I break the rule to teach you. With this special honor, you should cultivate a righteous heart and do more good.”

Having spoken, he beckoned Zhongli Quan close and whispered something in his ear. Zhongli Quan was puzzled. The Emperor scolded, “Foolish child, this is the great method I give you. Why doubt?” Zhongli Quan suddenly understood and tried reciting it once. Immediately, he felt his body float lightly into the air. Delighted, he shouted, “Good master, dear master!” Dancing and waving his arms like a madman, he made the Emperor and his celestial attendants laugh heartily.

What further adventures await Zhongli Quan in Youzhou? We shall see in the next chapter.
