# Chapter Forty-Three: The Cunning of the Old Demon Zhongli and the Calamity Befalling the Faithful Husband Meng Jiang

Meanwhile, the Eastern Flower Sovereign, upon seeing Zhongli Quan so joyous, glanced to the left and right at the celestial attendants and smiled, saying, “This child is so lively and innocent—truly endearing.” Beside him, a celestial official respectfully reported, “Zhongli Quan is not only innocent, but when serious matters arise, he can also be mature and steady. Such a person will surely never fail the Jade Emperor’s gracious favor in time to come.” The Sovereign was greatly pleased and immediately issued an edict: “Zhongli Quan, cherish yourself well. From now on, proceed directly to Youzhou; there is no need to descend again.”

Zhongli Quan bowed repeatedly amid the clouds, then with a single bound soared hundreds of li away. Looking back, the palace and courtyard had vanished without a trace. The joy swelling in his heart was beyond words. After traveling some distance, a mischievous impulse arose within him. He thought to himself: “Though Youzhou lies far off, with this cloud-riding method, I can arrive in an instant. Why not leisurely follow the lower cloud paths and savor the sights of the mortal realm along the way?” Pleased with this reasoning, he lowered his body until only a few dozen zhang above the earth. Gazing down, the figures on the ground appeared remarkably clear, and the people below could see a small child drifting slowly northward through the air, as if pushed by the wind and clouds. Some looked up in wonder, others clicked their tongues in amazement. Wherever he passed, many gathered in whispers, exchanging curious remarks.

He came to a place that was a mountain pass or checkpoint. Zhongli Quan did not know where exactly this was and was about to descend to inquire about the route to Youzhou and how much farther remained—lest he overshoot the destination. Just as he prepared to alight, a sudden whooshing sound came from behind. Turning, he saw two men dressed as Daoists hastening through the clouds, laughing and chatting without care. One of them said, “What skill has Fei Changfang? His master, I hear, is a lame Daoist.” This remark caught Zhongli Quan’s ear, and he was instantly struck dumb. Hastily, he stopped his cloud-step, deciding to wait for them and observe carefully. Before he could fully collect himself, the two Daoists had already caught up and saw the child traveling in the clouds.

The two exchanged a brief consultation, then suddenly halted their clouds and greeted Zhongli Quan. Only then did Zhongli Quan take a careful look at them. One had a snow-white face, short stature, and appeared no more than thirty years old. The other had a brown face with a tuft of gray-white beard, his expression sly and cunning, about sixty years of age. The elder was the first to speak: “Young brother, may I ask your honorable surname? From where do you hail? And where are you headed now?” Zhongli Quan, having overheard their disparaging words about Changfang and Master Iron Crutch, knew they were surely adversaries. Moreover, their faces did not look quite proper. He was all the more unwilling to reveal the truth and replied with a smile, “My surname is Zhong, given name Li, from Hebei. I am now sent by my master to find a senior brother and deliver a message.” They quickly asked, “Who is your honored master?” Zhongli Quan did not answer but first inquired their Daoist names and the celestial homeland they came from. The white-faced one said he was Leng Shen, a qi-refining cultivator from overseas. He then pointed to the black-faced one: “That is my senior brother, the Flame Daoist, who just came from the sea and is also bound for Youzhou. It is fitting that we travel together.”

Zhongli Quan then said, “I am a disciple of the Eastern Flower Sovereign. My senior sister He Dagu follows Li Iron Crutch to Youzhou. My master said that Li Iron Crutch is no good and ordered me to summon him back to the mountain. So I hurry on. May I ask what business you two masters have in Youzhou?” The two exchanged glances, their faces lighting with delight. Leng Shen said, “So young brother is a disciple of the Sovereign—truly a talented youth, most worthy of respect. That Li Iron Crutch is no upright man. Why does he have a crippled leg? It is because he habitually abducts other men’s wives. He met his match, was caught, and thrown from a rooftop to the ground, breaking one leg. Such a man is unworthy of company. No wonder the Sovereign wishes to recall your senior brother—truly a wise decision. We two are disciples of the demonic sect, yet have attained the Dao and become immortals. This journey is to intercept Fei Changfang, who was sent by Li Iron Crutch to seize Fan Qiliang, whom the Emperor has sent to Tiancheng, and to plot to seize Fan’s wife, Meng Jiangnu. This act greatly violates Heaven’s mandate; Iron Crutch deserves thunder’s punishment. When the Qin Emperor learned of this, he specially commissioned us to exterminate Iron Crutch. Since young brother is headed that way and Iron Crutch is your senior’s enemy, why not assist us as an insider? Once the deed is done, the Qin Emperor will surely grant you honors, and your master’s reputation will also shine. Would that not be splendid?”

Hearing this, Zhongli Quan cursed inwardly, “You pair of fiendish Daoists! What grudge does my master have against you to be slandered so? If you want me as an insider, I shall agree and use your scheme against you—to help my master slay this treacherous demon. Why not?” Thinking thus, he smiled and replied, “What is there to refuse? But once you succeed, do not abandon me. Go claim your rewards yourselves—I will not stand for that.” The two laughed heartily. “Young brother, you are too suspicious. The rewards come from the Qin Emperor; we ask no investment from you, only to speak a good word for you. Would we dare deceive you?” Zhongli Quan laughed with joy. “That is well. What official posts do you hold in the Qin court? How did you gain favor with the Emperor? Pray tell.” The Flame Daoist answered, “The present Emperor is a sage ruler who reveres the Dao and believes in immortals. He once sent the minister Xu Fu to seek immortals at sea, but Xu Fu encountered our elder brother, the Old Flood Dragon. The Old Flood Dragon took him to meet our sect’s Patriarch Tongtian. The Patriarch, with us and our uncle Youmingzi, went to the capital and taught the Emperor the way of longevity. When this matter arose, the Emperor asked us first to eliminate the demons before returning to court to receive our titles.”

Zhongli Quan asked, “Why did Xu Fu not go to Penglai? There are many immortals there. Why not invite more of them? Perhaps Xu Fu did not know the route to Penglai?” The two laughed. “How can the immortals of Penglai compare to the many disciples of our sect—all upright Daoists? Not to mention the Emperor himself, a hero who unified the six kingdoms and subdued the world, the true Son of Heaven. Would his insight be lacking? He sent Xu Fu to seek our sect’s people, not to Penglai. This shows the two teachings have their own right and wrong. Ignorant people only know Penglai as the home of immortals, unaware it is all hearsay and blind following.”

Zhongli Quan’s heart nearly burst with anger. By his nature, he would have long since dispatched them with a few kicks and punches. Yet, having been repeatedly taught restraint, he kept calm and measured, unwilling to act rashly. Seeing their nonsense amused him, and he wished to test them further. So he swallowed his anger and laughed heartily: “So it is. I am young and inexperienced, how could I understand such matters? What of Xu Fu now? Has he returned?” The two said, “He is a fine man. Our Patriarch is very pleased with him and granted him a floating field in the sea, making him ruler of a nation. He leads many boys and girls taken with him to open lands and multiply descendants. He calls himself the solitary emperor now. When young brother achieves great merit with us, we will petition the Patriarch to grant you a sea-immortal mountain, so you too may become a sovereign lord.”

Zhongli Quan laughed again and asked, “Since you want my help, please explain the situation. What happened before? Who is this Fan Qiliang of Tiancheng? Why did Fei Changfang try to seize him? What is the true story?” Leng Shen smiled: “The Emperor received a heavenly warning of the fall of Qin, foretelling the northern barbarians—likely the Xiongnu—as the threat. He conscripted all able men and ordered the building of a ten-thousand-li Great Wall along the border, appointing General Meng Tian as commander. Fan Qiliang, husband of Meng Jiangnu, was among the conscripts. Meng Jiangnu could not bear to be separated and chose to accompany him, enduring hardship. The wise Emperor, seeing her beauty and grace, was moved with pity and sent attendants to care for her along the way.”

Hearing this, Zhongli Quan laughed heartily and said, “If the Emperor is so wise and cherishes Meng Jiangnu so, why not simply exempt Fan Qiliang from service so they could be reunited? Why waste so many men and resources, sending escorts to protect her? This is truly topsy-turvy. You say the Emperor is wise, but I find it hard to understand.” The two were momentarily stunned and could not reply.

The Flame Daoist said, “Indeed, at first everyone thought so, suspecting the Emperor meddled too much. Later, when Fan Qiliang reached the north, General Meng’s proclamation appeared: ‘The Great Wall project is vast and requires a dedicated earth deity to oversee it.’ Fan Qiliang was found to be upright and suitable for this role. His earthly lifespan was complete; he was to be sealed within the wall. The decree from the kings of yin and yang realms appointed him as the earth deity of the Great Wall, so that on the day construction began, he would secretly aid the effort, preventing demons, ghosts, and beasts from obstructing. Only thus could the great work be completed; otherwise, endless resistance and turmoil would arise, and the wall would never be finished.” They showed the imperial decree appointing Fan Qiliang as the earth deity to the Emperor, who was shocked awake. Knowing Fan Qiliang was Meng Jiangnu’s husband, he was reluctant to separate them, but this was a matter of state, the foundation for generations of emperors. The fate was already decreed, and Fan Qiliang willingly accepted death to become a god. Even if Meng Jiangnu lived among mortals, having a divine husband would bring some benefit. To avoid spoiling his future, they chose a day to bind Fan Qiliang, offer sacrifices to Heaven, Earth, and gods, and seal him within the wall. Meanwhile, the escort for Meng Jiangnu was ordered to continue protecting her back to the capital. Unexpectedly, an incident occurred: a disciple of the Perfected Man Wenmei named Zhang Guo came by, saw injustice, and felt General Meng should not send a good man to be sealed in the wall. Using minor magic, he blinded the eyes of the crowd, rescued Fan Qiliang from the wall, and planned to flee Youzhou southward to evade capture. Fan Qiliang wished to live and die with his wife and refused to abandon her, so they plotted to abduct Meng Jiangnu. She was guarded by soldiers, so the attempt was delayed for several days. The capital learned of this, and just then our uncle arrived. The Emperor asked him to subdue Zhang Guo and retrieve Fan Qiliang. Our uncle’s skill far exceeded Zhang Guo’s. Upon arriving in Youzhou, he found their hiding place, swept Fan Qiliang away in a gust of wind, and used magic to confuse Zhang Guo, imprisoning him in the general’s camp. After this, Fei Changfang arrived. Though he had some minor magic, he was no match for our uncle. He infiltrated the army and rescued Zhang Guo. When he tried to rescue Fan Qiliang, our uncle discovered it and drove him away. Zhang Guo, overconfident, resisted our uncle but was captured again. Changfang, using his shrinking step technique, vanished in an instant. Our uncle had no way to stop him and let him escape. Later, it was learned he was a disciple of Li Iron Crutch, who would surely come to aid him. Thus, we were sent to assist. Now that we have met young brother, it is a great fortune. If you can, while Iron Crutch is meditating, use your sword to kill him and save us much trouble, gaining immeasurable merit. Otherwise, when we arrive, you can act as an insider, catching them unawares and making capture easy. This is your great achievement. Think carefully—what method do you prefer?”

Zhongli Quan considered and said, “The first method is simpler. But Iron Crutch is a man of the Dao; how can ordinary weapons harm him?” Leng Shen quickly said, “If young brother is willing, I have a magic treasure forged from refined golden essence—a small box containing sixteen flying swords of Immortal Execution. When opened, all sixteen swords fly out together. Except for the Great Luo Golden Immortals in Heaven, none can escape this doom. This treasure is called the Primordial Immortal Execution Box. If you do your best, I can lend it to you. It is best to open it suddenly when he is unprepared and strike with a single wave. The method is extremely convenient.” Zhongli Quan laughed, “A man’s word is his bond. Please lend me this treasure to see if it suits.” The two exchanged glances and hesitated briefly. The Flame Daoist said, “We are now on the cloud road; it is not convenient to take it out. Wait until we reach Youzhou and meet our uncle, then we will lend it.” Zhongli Quan said no more.

After a while, the two said they had reached Youzhou’s border. Zhongli Quan looked down and saw the place was not very lively, far less bustling than the capital. He followed the two down from the clouds to the camp of General Meng, where an old Daoist greeted them with two young attendants. The two called him “uncle” and bowed; then they invited Zhongli Quan to pay respects. Though disdainful inside, Zhongli Quan feared spoiling the mission and performed the ritual bow. The two explained the matter to the old Daoist, who scrutinized Zhongli Quan carefully before nodding and saying, “Very good. How old are you, child? Why did you become a disciple of the Eastern Flower Patriarch?”

Zhongli Quan smiled and fumed inwardly but spoke cleverly, telling a casual lie that convinced the old Daoist. The old man ordered him to stay nearby, awaiting instructions. When the great task was done, he would personally bring Zhongli Quan to the Eastern Sea to teach him the Dao and report to the Emperor to seek honors. Zhongli Quan thanked him and withdrew.

The old Daoist then summoned Leng Shen and the Flame Daoist inside for a private discussion. Soon after, he called Zhongli Quan in and asked if he truly had the courage to assassinate Li Iron Crutch. Zhongli Quan answered, “With the Immortal Execution treasure, what fear have I? Without it, I would not dare go empty-handed.”

The old Daoist smiled and nodded. “Naturally, you cannot go empty-handed. Iron Crutch and his group have already arrived and met with us. I have burned the demoness surnamed He with poisonous fire. I expect they will soon come to seize Zhang Guo. We plan an ambush to trap them, but such a scheme can only tease others and may not capture Iron Crutch. So we send you first. If you learn when they will come, report quickly. Meanwhile, keep on good terms with them. If you can kill him, that is best. Otherwise, accompany Iron Crutch in the raid, staying close at every step. When he is unguarded, suddenly use the treasure to strike and harm him. This is a grave matter; you must be very careful. If you fail, both mortal law and celestial law will not forgive you, and your life will be in danger. You must assess yourself. If you cannot do it, tell me now to avoid future regret.”

Zhongli Quan was furious but thought the fiendish Daoists’ lives were in his hands and need not argue. He promptly agreed: “I obey the Patriarch’s command and will not act rashly or disappoint my master’s trust.” The old Daoist was pleased, praised him, handed over Leng Shen’s treasure box, and warned him repeatedly to be cautious. Zhongli Quan accepted the mission and was escorted out, heading straight to Li Iron Crutch’s lodging at a local earth temple outside the western gate.

What further events befell Zhongli Quan upon meeting Master Iron Crutch remains to be told in the next chapter.
