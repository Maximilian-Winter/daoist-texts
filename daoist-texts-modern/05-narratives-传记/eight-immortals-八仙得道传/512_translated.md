# Chapter Forty-Four: The Geomancer of Youzhou Recounts Past Events — Xu Fu Establishes a New Realm in the Eastern Sea

Now, it happened that Zhongli Quan, upon seeing Master Iron Crutch, prostrated himself upon the ground, bowing his head repeatedly without cease. Master Iron Crutch hastened to have Fei Changfang pull him up, laughing as he said, “Congratulations! Only now have you truly found your genuine master. It was I who rashly took the teacher’s seat, and in my heart felt deeply ashamed—yet what fault have you in this?”

Hearing Master Iron Crutch speak thus, Zhongli Quan felt all the more uneasy. Yet, born in the wild mountains and valleys, and of a nature both loyal and straightforward, he never spoke with polite artifice. His heart unsettled, he only blushed deeply, his tongue tied and breath caught, his demeanor exceedingly troubled.

Master Iron Crutch, perceiving his meaning, could not help but laugh heartily: “Do you think that by taking a new master, I, who mistakenly claimed that title, would sever ties with you as if cutting a cloth, breaking off all relations? Know this: you and I belong to the same school, originally brothers in spirit. By reason, when you, the younger brother, are cast down to the mortal realm, does the elder brother fail to strive to protect and care for you? Though I have other matters to attend to upon descending the mountain, I can say half of my purpose is for you—to awaken you, to instruct you, to support and uplift you, so that you do not forget your origin, may soon escape the mortal dust, and ascend early to the celestial realms. Once these tasks are accomplished, my responsibility to you is fulfilled. Why then cling so tightly to the names of master and brother? Is it that I, as your teacher, would only care for you while holding that title, but as your elder brother abandon you like a cast-off thing, indifferent to your welfare? Or that you must be my student to receive my guidance and favor, and as my junior brother be denied these benefits? Even by worldly standards, which so often speak of gratitude and repayment of kindness, we are beings beyond the mundane. Let alone such matters, even if gratitude were required, would it not be enough that you understand my earnest intentions—neither to harm nor abandon yourself, but to cultivate diligently, to return swiftly to the ranks of immortals? Thus I may complete my duty to you at the earliest, and my heartfelt efforts be accounted for. That is the first way to repay kindness. Do not speak of me alone; even your newly recognized Patriarch, with his lofty status and profound dao, does he expect repayment from you? What he hopes for is no more than what I have just said. See then, master, friend, or brother—true deeds and results are all the same. What more do you fret about?”

Master Iron Crutch spoke on and on, both earnest and sincere, with humility yet offering encouragement. The Immortal Maiden and Fei Changfang, seated on either side, sighed deeply in admiration. Yet Zhongli Quan felt only greater unease; two lines of shameful sweat trickled down his forehead. Still, Master Iron Crutch continued, “Though so, in name we must be proper. From now on, you should address me as senior brother, following the same form as the great maiden here. I shall likewise call you junior brother, as was proper in past lives—now simply restored to its original state.”

Having said this, he laughed heartily. Yet when Zhongli Quan heard it, tears suddenly streamed down his face. He stepped close to Iron Crutch and, prostrating himself, wept aloud. Since his birth, through countless dangers and disasters, he had never before cried so bitterly since gaining consciousness. Naturally, Iron Crutch and the others understood his meaning. After a while, Zhongli Quan raised his voice, saying, “Master, your disciple is rough-tongued and blunt of speech. What you said today surely contains the great truths of the Dao. Even the Eastern Flower Patriarch would speak thus. Yet, though the facts are as such, my heart still feels uneasy at the change of address. It is not only the names, but I wish Master to treat me as before, that disciple and master remain as in former times. Only then can I be at peace to apply myself, to receive your teachings, and not fail your expectations. Otherwise, I fear I shall gain no benefit, wasting the hard efforts of both masters, and might as well return home quickly to be beaten by my father like a beast. These few words I speak; I know not what politeness is. This is no matter of etiquette. I have said all I can; there is nothing more to say. If Master will not agree, then there is no need to call me junior brother. I beg Master’s forgiveness.”

Master Iron Crutch saw that though his words were unpolished, they were sincere and straightforward. He admired his innocence and honesty, and for a moment found it difficult to contradict him. Just then, the Immortal Maiden and Fei Changfang could not bear it and spoke on his behalf: “Master and junior brother both speak profound truths. Yet Master’s teaching of the dao requires gradual uplift and care—it is a real matter, not something to be dismissed with empty words. Since this is so, there is no shame in proper names. In the Three Teachings, it is common for one to take many masters; thus the saying ‘the sage has no fixed teacher’ applies here! Now that Master and Brother Quan have differing views, we are willing to act as mediators. Let the principle of moderation govern: Master humbly yields and no longer insists on the teacher’s seat, so you may address him as junior brother as in past lives. And Brother Quan, being clearly a disciple, may fully respect him with the rites of a student. Let all be as originally agreed. What harm is there?”

Master Iron Crutch had no choice but to agree, laughing: “This child is so stubborn, there is no way to teach him otherwise. Luckily, the Eastern Flower Emperor can see I am not one to lord it over others or disregard my elders, and will forgive my presumption. Quan, you may rise now—why still cry so?”

Zhongli Quan still felt uneasy and said, “Since Master has acknowledged the rites of teacher, why call me junior brother? Not only can I not accept it, but I fear others will laugh, saying I am an arrogant disciple while Master is too humble. That would be unreasonable!”

Master Iron Crutch laughed: “Enough, enough! No need to argue further. I can call you Ah Quan, or Quan’er, whatever I please. You just agree anyhow and it’s done. By right, the immortal way requires proper names and words, no sloppiness. But today’s matter is no ordinary one, so some leniency is warranted. Now it is settled!”

Zhongli Quan finally rose. He had not yet met Fei Changfang, so Iron Crutch introduced them. Then he smiled and said, “I sent you to fetch Changfang to test your true courage. Courage and strength alone are not surprising; you must also show benevolence and righteous chivalry. I am pleased you have done so without betraying my trust. There is one small fault your Patriarch already warned you about, no need to repeat it. At the time, a rough calculation foretold that after you encountered the demons and awoke from your dream, it would be when Changfang returned that you two should meet in the mountains. So I sent you to welcome Changfang, confident you would return together. But when Changfang arrived at dusk the next day, you were not with him. Suspicion arose. I quietly employed profound methods and carefully recalculated, only then realizing the Eastern Flower Emperor had again used this opportunity to dispatch the White Tiger to escort you away. Truly, the Emperor’s dao methods are profound, beyond our reach. Yet a single slip of the tongue has sown the seeds of reincarnation anew. The Emperor has brought suffering upon himself; but for you, it is an unexpected, once-in-ten-thousand-years great fortune. You have followed the Patriarch for many years. The Patriarch saves people and the world, establishes virtue and words, his merit covers the cosmos, his dao rivals the Emperor of Heaven. You were but a child in his company, with much labor to your credit. Thus, upon reincarnation as a human, you have such a wondrous encounter. It is still the Patriarch’s blessing, not mere chance. This you must understand.”

Hearing this, Zhongli Quan was fully enlightened. He saw that both masters knew all without seeing or hearing, their mutual understanding flawless to the smallest detail. Amidst astonishment, joy blossomed anew. Suddenly, his childish nature fully revealed, he ran to Iron Crutch’s side, clinging as if glued, trembling with laughter: “Who would have thought you two masters have eyes that see a thousand miles and ears that hear the wind? To be your disciple is truly no easy matter. If we have faults we ourselves do not know, surely your palm thunder has already struck our heads!” Saying this, he shook his head repeatedly, clicking his tongue: “So formidable, so formidable, incredible, incredible.” Their laughter filled the air.

Iron Crutch grasped his topknot with one hand and his little arm with the other, smiling to comfort him: “Child, your insight is good. One must be so cautious in life, and even more so in cultivating the dao. But I must teach you further: cultivation depends on oneself, not others. To fear blame and punishment, to dare not slacken, is not unvirtuous. Yet if one’s character is already sullied, and cultivation is not from true heart’s desire but from fear of blame, is that not like a mischievous child trying to escape school but fearing the rod? You see my meaning?”

Iron Crutch paused, and Zhongli Quan laughed first: “I was only speaking so; who does not have such faults?” Iron Crutch and the Immortal Maiden laughed along.

The master continued: “There is yet another point you miss. The laws of immortals are like human laws, with degrees of severity. Judging by the size of the offense, as you said, to strike with thunder at every turn—how many times can a mortal endure thunder and fire? To punish small matters with such extreme penalty would be worse than the foolish emperors of today. Good child, I know your words were jest, but even jest must have limits, lest one be mocked. At critical moments, a single slip of the tongue can bring calamity vast as the heavens. Did you not see what happened yesterday with your Patriarch? Though he had this in mind long ago, a single slip of the tongue, like an arrow shot, was irreversible. The root lies in the usual state of mind—not necessarily in the slip itself, but in what is hidden within, which when spoken becomes a trigger. What is hidden may be delayed; once lightly spoken, it becomes the spark. When the time is ripe, even the power of the Heavenly Emperor cannot restrain it for a moment. Is this not perilous? Is it not fearful?” These words silenced Zhongli Quan for a long time.

Master Iron Crutch then warned: “Ah Quan, this is heavenly secret. Do not leak it. Never speak carelessly. To reveal it is to offend Heaven’s laws.” Zhongli Quan promised compliance. He and Fei Changfang wished to inquire further but dared not speak.

Then Master Iron Crutch smiled at Zhongli Quan: “The two demons you met on the way—one a white fox spirit, the elder of the Flame Daoists; the other Leng Shen, a rabbit who cultivated to reach a certain stage. Foxes are cunning by nature, rabbits stubborn. Though they can transform into human form and wield some dao magic, they cannot escape their true nature. Upon seeing you, they sought to use you for their own ends, treating you as a puppet. They did not know the Eastern Flower Patriarch is a celestial golden immortal of high rank, utterly incompatible with their evil cult. Yet they pretended to be of the orthodox dao, playing you as a tool. The old Daoist they call ‘uncle master’ is not a beast reborn, but a notorious bandit leader named Li Gecko, nicknamed Gecko for his unmatched bravery and ability to scale walls and roofs. This man committed countless crimes and harmed many. Later, he suddenly repented, abandoned his ways, and became a monk, even attaining his current position. He is a key figure dispatched by the Heavenly Sovereign of the Tongtian Sect. They intercepted Xu Fu, sent by the Qin Emperor into the sea, and with minor sorcery deceived Xu Fu into believing they were true immortals, handing over the emperor’s imperial edict. They came to Xianyang to meet the emperor but abandoned Xu Fu and his dozens of followers on a sea island. Fortunately, they encountered my senior brothers, the Perfected Piao Miao and Fire Dragon, who pitied their plight and, seeing them trapped and without hope, used great magic to establish a village, bringing grains, mulberry trees, and silkworms so they could farm and weave. From then on, they no longer needed to return to China. Over time, they multiplied and could form a nation, passing down their heritage without replacement. One reason is that Xu Fu’s heart was kind, and as he went for our teaching, though deceived, he deserved special favor, showing our dao’s vast compassion. Another is that the Qin Emperor was cruel; the demons Xu Fu brought would eventually reveal their true nature. When that truth emerged, the demons could not stand, and Xu Fu would be guilty of deceiving the sovereign. Thus, not allowing his return was also a form of protection. I heard the two Perfected spent much effort on his behalf, even going to the sea to summon the Dragon King and his family. The island stretches north to south, jutting into the Eastern Sea in a narrow slant. When storms arise, the shores suffer greatly. The island’s shape is narrow and slanting; with the shores gone, the interior land is limited, clearly losing half the country. So they specially instructed to care for it, to avoid disaster. Yet the sea’s winds, waves, and rains have fixed quantities. If the island’s shores lessen the storms, the reduced amount shifts to the farther sea, making the ocean waves even greater. Henceforth, Chinese ships venturing there must brave great peril. Fire Dragon Perfected said well: ‘This island hangs alone beyond the sea, grown by immortal magic, self-sustaining. Should invaders come, it would be hard to resist. The natural storms act as a shield, a perfect defense.’ We need not have exerted such effort for Xu Fu, but wished to leave a mark in the sea, to show the boundless power of our immortal arts.”

As Iron Crutch finished, Immortal Maiden smiled and asked, “Such a great island—did it have no inhabitants before? Just the few dozen boys and girls Xu Fu brought? To multiply so would be difficult indeed.”

Master Iron Crutch nodded: “I heard the island’s residents still reflect ancient times. Future population growth will naturally root in those children. But due to the urgent need to multiply, early marriages bring drawbacks. By human physiology and life energy, forced breeding is difficult. So the two Perfected instructed the Dragon King to send water palace physicians to seek the yang essence of sea dogs, making a medicine to strengthen health and fertility, given to Xu Fu to distribute among the children. With this, the descendants will be sturdier than elsewhere, though shorter in stature—aptly described as ‘short, small, and vigorous.’ This is the immortal way’s subtle use! Beyond this, there is an unavoidable matter: marriage customs do not follow Chinese rites—no parental consent, no matchmakers. Partners may freely unite as they please, without censure. A man may marry several women simultaneously; a woman may love several men at once, with love waxing and waning day by day. Partners may freely seek others as they wish. Widows and widowers remarrying is also proper. In short, the population is small and isolated, making intermarriage with other countries difficult. The priority is rapid multiplication; all means to increase offspring are accepted without question. The root of future problems lies here. The resulting licentiousness will grow rampant and uncontrollable. As the saying goes, ‘To cure coldness with magic brings harm; to cure greed with magic brings greater harm.’ Such is the principle!”

All listened, nodding and sighing. Master Iron Crutch laughed again: “See how absurd these demons are? Even with Xu Fu’s matter, my two senior brothers spent countless efforts to bring him to this island, clear the land, cut the weeds, and build a new country. Yet they shamelessly claim credit for it all. Is this not laughable?”

Zhongli Quan laughed: “Exactly so. They said the same to me.”

Iron Crutch, Fei, and Immortal Maiden all laughed heartily. Iron Crutch continued: “Since they dare steal others’ merits, they will surely use vile means to harm Xu Fu’s descendants. Watch and see!”

The three nodded in sorrowful agreement. Iron Crutch then asked Zhongli Quan, “Will you take out that treasure box they gave you? Let us play with it.”

Zhongli Quan smiled: “Master knows all beforehand. Those demon slaves still dare to plot secretly—truly overestimating themselves.” Saying this, he drew the treasure box from his bosom and handed it to Iron Crutch. But his playful heart could not wait; he eagerly opened the box. Suddenly, with a thunderous “boom,” countless swords shot forth, stabbing at the three masters from all sides. Immediately, cries of pain rang out as two were struck and fell to the ground.

Who fell and what became of their lives remains to be revealed in the next chapter.
