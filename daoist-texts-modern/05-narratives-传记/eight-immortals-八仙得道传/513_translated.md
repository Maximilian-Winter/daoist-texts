# Chapter Forty-Five: The Great Calamity Wrought by Misused Magic Treasure — The Golden Needles’ Swift Deed Wins Glorious Merit

Now it happened that Zhongli Quan, ever mischievous and quick-tempered, hastened to present the sword box given by the demon. Without delay, he pried open the box’s lid, and in an instant, a host of swords shot forth. Fei Changfang was struck in the waist and thigh, immediately fainting. The Immortal Maiden also suffered a wound upon her arm, crying out and falling backward—fortunately, Zhongli Quan stood just behind her and caught her in time. Only Master Iron Crutch’s countenance remained unchanged; though seven or eight swords pierced his body, not a drop of blood appeared, nor did he feel pain, as if utterly unaware.

At this moment, Zhongli Quan was struck with terror and shame, his face shifting from pale to green, then from green to white, and suddenly flushing a blood-red—this was the first fright he had ever known since his birth. He was so dismayed he could hardly find a place to hide, and he hastily prostrated himself, bowing his head again and again.

Master Iron Crutch shouted, “Why do you not rise and help your senior brother Changfang?” Only then did Zhongli Quan, trembling with fear, crawl to his feet and lift Fei Changfang up. The master muttered incantations, then cried “Swift!” as he circled his finger thrice around Changfang. With a sudden “Ah-yo!” Changfang awoke. The Immortal Maiden, who had already regained consciousness, was still as pale as paper, crying out in pain without cease. Master Iron Crutch smiled and said to her, “Why do you hide the divine elixir? Hurry and bring it forth for use.” The Immortal Maiden was instantly enlightened, hastily retrieving the pill bestowed by the Mysterious Lady. The master ordered both to take one each—half swallowed with warm water, half dissolved with saliva and applied to the wounds. Before the meal was finished, all the injuries had calmed; not a trace of pain remained.

All beheld Master Iron Crutch, who had suffered the most wounds yet felt no pain, and were filled with awe and envy. The master laughed, saying, “There is nothing strange in this. What is precious in an immortal is to be without the notions of self or other. Without the notion of other, one fears no one in the world; without the notion of self, nothing in the world can harm me. Because I have neither, no matter what knives or swords you throw, or even the poisonous fireflies the old demon unleashed the other day—you all saw them swarm about me, yet I dispelled them with a cold light, leaving no trace. Why did Sister He escape harm, yet Changfang suffered a slight injury? This is the difference between having and not having self!” Both nodded in admiration and praise.

Seeing Zhongli Quan still kneeling stiffly, they pleaded on his behalf: “Though he is childish and rash, it was truly unintentional. Thanks to the master’s dao methods and the Mysterious Lady’s divine elixir, our pain is gone. We beg the master to forgive him and teach him.” Master Iron Crutch bade him rise. Zhongli Quan first thanked his master, then apologized to the two. The master could not help but scold him, then said, “Now it is best to use their own scheme against them. Tomorrow you shall return and tell that old demon that we are gravely wounded and cannot face the battle, to ease their minds. If he dares to come to attack us, that will be best. Moreover, the demon’s poisonous fire is made by gathering thousands of fireflies and mixing the deadliest poisons and fiercest incantations from the Four Seas. When you, Brother Fei, suffered from it, your life was nearly lost. Luckily, I poured out the gourd’s water beside you, extinguishing its light, or else disaster would have struck. Though I escaped harm, I cannot yet destroy him. You must steal this thing as I have instructed, to redeem your fault. Be careful—do not play about and cause trouble again.” Zhongli Quan promised to obey.

Master Iron Crutch handed the sword box back to him, instructing, “Once this box is used, it requires another incantation to close and open again. Take it back and return it to the Flame Daoist, to maintain their trust.” Yet Zhongli Quan, hearing this, was somewhat reluctant to rise. Suddenly he asked, “Master, this thing has caused me so much trouble. I was thinking of keeping it for amusement. Can it be so easily returned?” Master Iron Crutch laughed heartily, “You, a monk cultivating the dao, so covetous of others’ things—how can that be? I’ll tell you plainly: all their treasures will sooner or later belong to us. Why the hurry?” Immortal Maiden He smiled, patting his back: “Junior brother, just go forth and win merit. Such demons are nothing special. Never mind that they will all belong to us eventually; we can simply refine another just like it. For them, that is most troublesome, but for our master, it is but a wave of the hand—hardly worth mentioning.” Zhongli Quan then gladly obeyed the command.

The next day, Zhongli Quan returned to Meng Tian’s camp, where the old Daoist and the two demons Yan and Leng came out to greet him, congratulating his great merit. Zhongli Quan was at first bewildered, but after Leng Shen’s detailed explanation, he understood. After he left, they had been uneasy, so Yan and Leng personally went to spy on the situation. They heard the box open, and a sword light shot from the room into the clouds. The two demons were startled, then upon investigation realized Iron Crutch and the others were wounded, though not dead, and unlikely to recover soon. They thought Zhongli Quan had surely accomplished this feat and would return immediately. Yet after waiting half a day with no sign, they could only guess and return disappointed. After a night’s rest, they began to deliberate. Just then, news came that Zhongli Quan had arrived, so all rejoiced and asked why he had not come the day before.

Zhongli Quan laughed, “My methods are most subtle. Honestly, the three demons still do not know it was my trick. They think you sent someone to lie in wait outside the window, and the flying swords wounded each other. How could they suspect me? I took advantage of their unconsciousness to retrieve the swords and the box. If you don’t believe me, come see—the treasure has all been used. But now it cannot be closed again. What is the reason for this?” The old Daoist and two demons were greatly pleased, saying, “No matter, this thing can only be used once. To use it a second time, the incantation must be repeated.” Leng Shen took the box, muttered some words, and indeed the box closed again, just as before.

Zhongli Quan then proposed, “I report to the three masters: now that Iron Crutch and his two disciples are wounded and unable to move, why not seize this chance to raid their dwelling, capture the three demon Daoists, and perhaps burn them with the master’s poisonous fire? Would that not be splendid?” The old Daoist nodded, “Your plan suits me well. We shall go tonight.” He added to Zhongli Quan, “You should return there. Iron Crutch is skilled; the poisonous fire failed to harm him before, so he is not easy to deal with. But I believe if we catch him unawares, we can injure him fatally. For now, take the sword box back. When we arrive, Iron Crutch will be busy at the front. You can secretly attack from behind, and there will be no mistake.”

Zhongli Quan hastened, “That will not do. Though the sword box is fierce, Iron Crutch does not fear it. Though he escaped the poisonous fire, what he fears most is this treasure. I heard him speak of it myself, his face changed color, and he warned us repeatedly: if the poisonous fire comes, we must flee quickly. You see, he fears the poisonous fire greatly and still has no method to avoid it. Please, master, entrust me with this treasure. When the battle begins and they are busy, I will approach and unleash the poisonous fire, releasing many fireflies at their vital points, to strike a mortal blow. Even with all their powers, they cannot escape this great calamity.”

The old Daoist pondered deeply. His only hope lay in this treasure, and if anything went wrong, the disaster would be grave. Yet the plan was clever, and without it, Iron Crutch could not be killed. Seeing Zhongli Quan young but capable, he trusted him and agreed, trembling as he handed over the bottle of poisonous fireflies, warning thrice, “Be extremely careful. If this is damaged, half my life will be lost.” Zhongli Quan felt both joy and amusement, pitying him so much he almost said, “Better your life be lost!” but restrained his laughter, feigning utmost solemnity as he took the bottle, bade farewell to the three demons, and returned to Master Iron Crutch’s side to report his merit.

By then, Master Iron Crutch had already counted on his return and personally led Immortal Maiden He and Fei Changfang out to greet him. Zhongli Quan knelt hastily, saying, “Master, do not be so courteous; I do not deserve it.” The master smiled, “Your carefulness shows you are a man of great talent. I honor you not lightly, but to encourage you to be steady and mature in all your future affairs, so as not to disappoint the respect I show you today.” Zhongli Quan entered with the three, laughing, “In that case, I dare not accept your respect.” The three laughed heartily.

Master Iron Crutch ordered the firefly bottle brought forth, saying, “Tonight they will surely attack. Changfang can hold off the cold demon. This treasure has but one jade pestle, which can change size. To mortals, one strike turns them to powder. Though Changfang has no cultivation, he has taken my Bone-Transforming Golden Elixir and is no longer an ordinary body. He can wield my sword to resist. If he can hold his own, I will come to aid. Sister He can face the Flame Daoist. This one is unlike Leng Shen; his cultivation is deep. You have already experienced his sword box; though it cannot kill you, you must not be careless. You have the Mysterious Lady’s piercing needles, which can transform into millions, enough to break that box. Once the demon fox is dead, you and Changfang can together fight the rabbit.”

The two accepted the orders. Suddenly, Master Iron Crutch lifted the gourd’s lid, producing a magic treasure, smiling at Zhongli Quan: “I hid the poisonous fireflies, but conjured a false bottle, and transformed your body into two. The false body holds the false bottle by my side, never leaving an inch, as if waiting to release the fireflies. Meanwhile, your true body hides in the air. When I release the crystal light pearl, at that moment, you will drop it from above. This treasure can bury the old demon alive in the earth, with no escape.”

Zhongli Quan took it and saw it was a lump of rotten mud. He could not help but laugh: “Master, everyone says I am mischievous, and you often scold me for being naughty. Who would have thought you also love to play? This is but a lump of mud—what treasure is this? Even if it were a treasure, thrown on someone’s head, it would at most raise a bump. How can it bury the old demon alive? Isn’t that laughable?” Immortal Maiden He and Fei Changfang laughed at his childish views, saying he truly had the eyes of a child; immortal treasures cannot be equated with ordinary things. Master Iron Crutch, however, sternly rebuked, “No more words! You think you are so clever, that this is just a lump of mud that can only raise a bump? How do you know such a thing cannot bury a little old demon?” Zhongli Quan was frightened into silence, took the mud lump, stifling his laughter and doubt, awaiting the evening to test it.

At dusk, Master Iron Crutch had transformed Zhongli Quan’s body and the firefly bottle as planned, just ready when a gust of wind sounded in the air. He smiled at the three, “The demons have arrived.” They looked up to see three black clouds drifting from the east, settling in their courtyard—indeed, the three demon Daoists. Master Iron Crutch ordered Immortal Maiden He and Fei Changfang to act swiftly. The old Daoist, seeing Iron Crutch and the others uninjured and prepared, was greatly startled, unaware it was Zhongli Quan’s trick. Confident, he and the two demons split to face their foes, three pairs matched in combat. The false Zhongli Quan held the false firefly bottle, never leaving Master Iron Crutch’s side. The old Daoist was secretly pleased.

The three pairs clashed in sword, saber, spear, and cudgel. The Flame Daoist first lost to Immortal Maiden He, hastily releasing the sword box. She countered with a torrent of ten thousand golden needles from her mouth, blocking the flying swords. The swords and needles clashed with a ringing sound; the sword light dimmed while the needle light shone bright. The Flame Daoist found his eyes unable to open; as he tried to flee, both eyes were pierced and blinded by the needles. Rolling on the ground, he revealed his true form—a white fox, speaking human words, begging for mercy. The Immortal Maiden’s heart softened, wishing to spare him, but the volley of needles pierced him all over, and he died an untimely death. She gathered her needles and swords and turned to aid Fei Changfang.

Fei Changfang’s immortal sword was fierce, and Leng Shen’s jade pestle was no weak weapon. They fought evenly. When Immortal Maiden He joined, skilled in dao methods and martial power, and with the Flame Daoist dead, Leng Shen’s courage faltered. Upon facing the maiden, he fled, dragging his pestle. She continued to hurl golden needles at his back, and with a loud shout, blood spurted from Leng Shen, nearly staining their weapons. Hastily they withdrew, only to see a rabbit lying dead on the ground.

The old Daoist and Master Iron Crutch fought with their swords for seventy or eighty rounds. Seeing the two demons dead, the old Daoist grew anxious and wondered why Zhongli Quan, holding the firefly bottle, did not release it. He shouted, “Zhongli Quan, why do you not unleash your treasure?” Master Iron Crutch laughed heartily, “How can your harmful thing be called a treasure? Watch my true treasure.” Opening his mouth, he spat forth ten thousand beams of crystal light that trapped the old Daoist. Within the light shone a dazzling pearl. The old Daoist was ensnared, unable to move or find direction. As he tried to escape by earth concealment, the true Zhongli Quan leapt into the air and hurled the mud lump at the old Daoist’s head. The lump struck the ground and immediately expanded, encasing the old Daoist within. The old Daoist thought it was ordinary earth and tried to burrow in, but in an instant, his figure vanished.

Zhongli Quan quickly descended, shouting, “Master, how did this demon escape?” Fei Changfang, having slain the rabbit, stood aside watching the battle, stamping his foot, “What a pity! That most fierce and wicked thief escaped.” Only Immortal Maiden He smiled faintly, saying nothing.

Master Iron Crutch laughed, “Where is the treasure I gave you?” Zhongli Quan replied, “What treasure? That lump of mud? Didn’t I just throw it on the old demon’s head? It scattered at once, and the old demon disappeared somewhere.” The master smiled, pointing to where Zhongli Quan had thrown the mud lump. Suddenly, a great mass of filthy mud rolled together from all sides, forming a large round lump. From its center emerged a round object, crying out in wails and pleas. They hurried over to see, greatly astonished and laughing aloud.

What this was, and why it was within the mud lump, will be revealed in the next chapter.
