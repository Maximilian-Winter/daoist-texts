# Chapter Forty-Six: The Mud Ball Bursts Forth a Head, The Stubborn Immortal Hides Within the Ear

Now it happened that Master Iron Crutch, with a single finger, gathered a vast mass of earth and clay, rolling it into a smooth, round ball—like a great orb. Suddenly, from atop this great ball, a smaller, black, furry sphere began to emerge and burrow forth.

All who beheld this marvel were struck with astonishment and wonder. They scrambled forward eagerly for a closer look, only to discern a figure—a man’s head sprouting from the mud ball, while from the neck down, his body lay concealed beneath the earth. Upon closer inspection, they recognized him as the old Daoist who had been aiding the violent mischief-makers. The crowd burst into uproarious laughter. Yet the old Daoist still recognized Zhongli Quan and, with a plaintive voice, begged him to intercede with Master Iron Crutch, pleading for mercy and pardon of his life. He vowed never again to commit evil nor to aid Emperor Qin, and offered to seek the release of Zhang Guo, the general soon to be captured, as atonement for his sins.

Zhongli Quan laughed and scolded, “You villain, your misdeeds are countless, your arrogance boundless. Now is the time your evil has reached its fullness, and Heaven’s punishment descends. If my master were to pardon you, would that not defy Heaven’s will and bring ruin upon himself? As for Zhang Guo, my master has his own means to summon him back at once. What need have we of your scorpion-like flattery? We will not accept your false kindness.”

The old Daoist, seeing no hope of life, sighed deeply toward the heavens and cried out loudly, “All my life I have wrought evil without end, knowing I am unworthy before Heaven. So I abandoned my family to cultivate the dao, enduring hardships and bitter suffering, only to gain a small measure of skill. Yet I erred into a deviant path and was used by the demonic cult, harming more than when I was a mere thief. If such conduct could grant immortality, then truly the heavenly dao would be undone. Very well, since you say you act as Heaven’s executioners, I die without complaint. I only ask that in five hundred years, if fate allows, we meet again, and then I may seek your instruction anew.”

Master Iron Crutch sighed, “When a man faces death, his words turn good. Hearing this man, my heart almost softened. Yet as Ah Quan said, this fellow’s nature is fierce and stubborn; though he has left the world, he still loses his true nature. Clearly, he is one who cannot be expected to repent. You would not listen to his words, and in five hundred years he will come seeking revenge. This single utterance proves his fierce and unreasonable nature. I am certain that if he reincarnates in five hundred years, he will still be a restless, unruly being. Since he himself asks for death, I cannot bear to let him suffer piecemeal. I shall grant his wish.”

With that, he pointed again, and the great mud ball rolled a while on the ground. When it settled, the human head was gone, leaving only a smooth, round mud sphere. Master Iron Crutch sighed to the crowd, “This is the end of the wicked who persist in evil. To rely on sorcery to harm others is most detested by Heaven and rejected by those beyond the world. As the saying goes, such men deserve to be struck down by all. Let this be a mirror for ourselves.” All present shuddered in agreement.

Master Iron Crutch then smiled at Zhongli Quan, “Did you see? This little mud ball has buried alive such a great Daoist! Yet truly, one Daoist alone is not worth burying. With the scope and power of this mud ball, it could hold a thousand armies without difficulty!” Zhongli Quan laughed heartily, “Master, may I keep this mud ball to play with?”

Master Iron Crutch chuckled, “What kind of toy is that? You now should focus on diligent cultivation of the great dao, not on such murderous weapons. When your cultivation succeeds, such treasures can be forged by yourself at will, no need for gifts. Moreover, my treasures are not like those obtained by demons through cultivation; they come from this wondrous gourd, perfect and complete in all things. These things are like children to the gourd, and without the mother, even if effective for a time, they will eventually lose their power. If you take it, what use will it be?” Zhongli Quan dared not speak further but felt a lingering attachment.

The Immortal Maiden smiled, “Young brother is impatient! Brother, please hear me: since he is but a child, wanting some treasure is not necessarily a frivolous distraction. Better to grant him the sword case left by that demon.” Master Iron Crutch smiled again and presented the sword case to Zhongli Quan, but earnestly warned, “A treasure is not truly a treasure, but a deadly weapon. Used improperly, it harms both others and oneself. Remember the fate of its owner and the cause of his death. Do not use this treasure recklessly, nor regard it as a mere plaything.” Zhongli Quan bowed and accepted.

Then Master Iron Crutch said to the Immortal Maiden, “Hurry and fetch Zhang Guo, and finish the affairs of Lady Meng Jiang. We must soon part ways—there is no need to linger here.”

The Immortal Maiden eagerly agreed, “I have no merit in this matter; let me handle these small tasks.” Master Iron Crutch smiled, “Sister, you are too polite. Your efforts have been enough; I suppose you want to take on many tasks alone to earn merit?” This remark brought laughter all around.

Master Iron Crutch continued, “There remain a few petty demons in Meng Tian’s camp. Such creatures, once cultivated, cause more harm than good. If they resist stubbornly, we might as well open a killing decree and wipe them out cleanly, to prevent future troubles. If they flee at the first sign of difficulty, there is no need for excess; we would not want others to think our sect delights in bullying the weak.” The Immortal Maiden responded, “I obey.”

By now she had newly mastered the art of instant travel. Though the camp was not far, with this method she arrived in no time. It was just past midnight, and the camp echoed with the clanging of guards’ bells. The Immortal Maiden knew Zhang Guo was locked inside a wooden shed in the rear camp, sealed by the old Daoist’s magic and incantations. Zhang Guo’s own skill was shallow, so escape was impossible.

Approaching the shed, she prepared to chant the unlocking spell, when suddenly several whirlwinds circled her feet, rolling about and causing a commotion without dispersing. Looking elsewhere, she saw no smoke or flame, and instantly understood these were the little demons her brother had mentioned. Though not good creatures, her heart was kind and gentle; she wished to avoid killing again. Lowering her gaze, she recognized the black winds as two or three pig demons, a small ox, and a creature neither bear nor wolf. She felt both anger and amusement, and a touch of pity.

Drawing her sword, she stood firm and shouted, “Beasts, show respect! By the decree of the Golden Immortal of the Upper Realms, I come to rescue Zhang Guo. Your patriarch and two masters resisted stubbornly and have lost their lives. What power have you, mere demonic clowns, to defy orders? I need not waste words; one stroke of my sword could end the lives of a thousand pigs and oxen. I speak only to save you. If you are wise, depart quickly, enter deep mountains and dense forests, cultivate sincerely, and harm no people. Then you need not fear the day of reckoning. If not, my sword knows no mercy. Though you may have years of cultivation, once your lives are taken, what a pity that would be.”

Her words were born of compassion, yet the beasts, hearing themselves called swine and cattle, and their patriarchs scolded without mercy, were enraged. These wild, ignorant creatures, once angered, could not be reasoned with. After her speech, she hoped they would heed her counsel and clear the way, but instead, suddenly sharp, hard objects attacked her feet from all sides. Quick and agile, she leapt into the air, standing mid-flight to look down. The beasts had transformed—each half human, half beast; some with human heads and beastly bodies; others with beast heads and human bodies; some with beast hooves behind and human hands before, wielding weapons in bestial form. Their horns, whether on human or beast heads, shone with sharp brilliance. Any ordinary person struck by those horns would be pierced through chest and abdomen, head split open. Even her Daoist body felt a dull ache from their touch.

At first puzzled, she now realized these were forged beast horns and was somewhat frightened. She stuck out her tongue, muttering, “Fortunate I escaped quickly today; otherwise, how could I face my brother and Ah Quan with a battered body?” Then she heard chattering voices below. These demons, though cultivated for years and trained by demon Daoists, could only mimic human speech to a limited degree—just chattering, half-understood words.

The Immortal Maiden was both amused and vexed, no longer inclined to pity. Driven by curiosity, she refrained from striking, instead turning her keen ear to listen and translate. They were discussing the news she had brought.

One said, “With such masters, where could any ghostly immortal come from to catch them all and kill them?”

Another said, “Still, I’ve seen our patriarch’s complexion dim; perhaps he cannot succeed after all.”

Another said, “If our masters are gone, we should each flee, find a new place, and seek good women to enjoy life—then our cultivation would not be in vain.”

Another said, “That woman—whether human or demon—I saw her withstand our touch and vanish in a cloud. She has skill. How can we fight her? Better to flee quickly.”

Hearing this, the Immortal Maiden thought, “These dumb demons do not see me standing here. No wonder they are called stupid oxen and dull pigs—the most ignorant of beasts. Yet they know to seek women and pleasure—truly, they learn only bad habits. They deserve no forgiveness. No wonder my brother never saw them and judged them all bad.” Resolving her course, she thought, “Though these beasts have little skill, there are seven or eight of them. If I fight them directly, it wastes my strength, soils my sword, and risks their scattering. Better to pierce their eyes with golden needles, driving them into their brains—would that not be swift and effective?”

She drew golden needles and cast them downward. In an instant, dazzling golden light filled the ground. Amid cries and shrieks, she felt pity, “Though they are no good, why must I take their lives?” She withdrew the needles, covered her face, and quickly descended to the ground. Approaching the wooden shed, she dispelled the sealing spell. Inside lay a Daoist.

She hurriedly asked, “Are you Brother Zhang? I am He Lanxian, sent by Brother Li to rescue you.” She repeated twice, but he did not answer. Though unfamiliar with Zhang Guo, she trusted the mission and moved closer, using her enlightened vision to examine him. She saw he had been bewitched by the old demon and lost his true nature. With no means to free him, she untied a sash around his waist, bound him, and hoisted him onto herself, leaping out of the shed.

Just as she was about to leave, she encountered two night watchmen carrying clappers and lanterns, followed by an officer and four soldiers, all armed. Seeing her carrying a man, they shouted and surrounded her. The Immortal Maiden, intent on escape, sought a way out. Suddenly, the soldiers seemed possessed; they dropped their weapons and began fighting each other fiercely, ignoring her entirely.

Puzzled but eager to flee, she moved to an open space, leapt lightly into the air, and upon landing, found herself more than ten li from the camp.

Carrying Zhang Guo, she smiled to herself: “I am a chaste Daoist maiden; in saving lives and aiding the world, I need not fear suspicion. Yet carrying him back like this invites gossip. Better to leave him at the gate, have my brother rescue him, and send him inside—then I am free.” As she pondered, a voice whispered in her ear, “If you want to avoid suspicion, why rescue him at all? If you rescue, you must not care for suspicion.”

Startled, she looked around but saw no one. Nearly dropping her burden, she steadied herself and scanned all directions, seeing no trace. She spat, “What ghost dares joke with me? Surely my mind is muddled, ears confused. No matter, I will follow my own path.” As she turned to leave, the voice laughed again, “Forgive me, your skill is such that ghosts dare not joke with you. Know that I am no common ghost, but something different.”

The voice grew clearer, and she grew more alarmed, thinking, “This is serious—what being has such great power? And I carry this fool on my back, with nowhere to hide.” Then the voice laughed wildly, “I hide in your ear; where can you hide? You cannot cut off your ear!”

Angry and anxious, the Immortal Maiden threw Zhang Guo onto a dense, thick patch of grass, stood firm with hands on hips, and demanded, “What demon are you, to play such tricks? I have serious business to save a life, and you hinder me. If you are a fellow Daoist brother seeking amusement, show yourself and speak plainly.”

The voice replied, “You are unreasonable! You want to meet me, yet you throw the one you saved on the ground. If you injure his limbs, would that not be your fault?”

The Immortal Maiden, at a loss, pleaded, “Good friend, please stop tormenting me. If you persist, Brother Zhang may not die from being thrown, but from illness.”

Hearing this, the voice laughed heartily and revealed itself—a female Daoist standing before her, saying, “Daoist He, do you not recognize me? I have come with you to see your Master Iron Crutch.”

Who this person was, and what path she followed, will be revealed in the next chapter.
