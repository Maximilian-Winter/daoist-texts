# Chapter Forty-Seven: The Immortal Fox Teases Maiden He; The Savage Soldiers Mangle Lady Meng Jiang

Now, it so happened that Maiden He was thoroughly bewildered and dazed by the antics of that female Daoist, utterly at a loss as to what was going on, nor did she understand who this person truly was. Smiling gently, she inquired, “Fellow Daoist, surely you have met me somewhere before; otherwise, how could you today play such a jest upon me?” The female Daoist laughed and replied, “You might as well hoist this Brother Zhang Guo upon your back again. We shall walk and talk all along the way, and when we reach Senior Brother Li’s place, our conversation can conclude. Then you will know who I am, and there will be no need to suspect me as some ghostly apparition.”

Hearing this, Maiden He felt deeply ashamed in her heart and had no choice but to comply, lifting Zhang Guo once more onto her back, letting that Daoist lady lead the way, while she herself followed behind. The Daoist lady, unreserved and familiar with the path, twisted and turned through the winding roads at a leisurely pace. As they walked, she revealed to Maiden He that she and Zhang Guo were both disciples of the Venerable Wenmei, and that her name was Tonghui. She also mentioned that she had once had dealings with their Senior Brother, Iron Crutch, so they were well acquainted. Maiden He’s mind cleared at this, and she smiled, asking, “Since you come from Venerable Wenmei’s school, what is your seniority rank with Senior Brother Li?” Tonghui grinned and stuck out her tongue, saying, “You take me for a simple soul, yet your tongue is sharp! You say Iron Crutch is my senior uncle, and that even you are a generation above me. I ought not to be so rude as to joke before you, is that so?” Maiden He had no such intention, but Tonghui’s words made her feel quite embarrassed. She quickly smiled and said, “Dao Brother, do not be so suspicious. I have no cunning schemes or sly tricks. You, with your vast spiritual powers, can surely see the heart’s intent. How could you not see the joy behind my laughter? Why must you wrong me so?”

Tonghui laughed heartily and said, “Enough, enough! For a first meeting, I think I have teased you enough. To be honest, the most well-behaved and mature one among Venerable Wenmei’s disciples is Zhang Guo, the one you carry. The most mischievous, unruly, and restless is this old fox spirit here. If I take a liking to someone, I do not greet them with formalities; I tease and play with them at once. Though I have never met you before, I have long known your story. Now that I have met you, I am very fond of you, fearing you might prefer politeness and fall into the vulgar habits of mortals. So I thought it best to play with you a bit first, lest we remain strangers and stiff when we meet. Don’t you think I deserve a good scolding for this?”

Maiden He, always reserved and accustomed to gentle, refined company, had never encountered such a wild, eccentric, and purely playful friend. Yet seeing Tonghui’s dignified bearing and graceful demeanor, with humor but no trace of frivolity, she grew fond of her innocence and liveliness, and deeply admired her extraordinary dao cultivation. Smiling, she said, “Immortals differ from the Western Buddhists and Eastern Confucians; they do not fuss over surface proprieties or mimic worldly formalities. I only regret my own clumsiness, born into this mundane world and unable to leap beyond its fleeting vanities. Now I see Dao Brother’s carefree and unrestrained ways—truly befitting a genuine immortal. If you do not abandon me, I shall humbly accept your teachings and learn some of your easygoing, playful methods. Might I hope you will take me, this dull disciple, under your wing?”

Her words made Tonghui laugh until she clutched her belly, exclaiming “Ah, oy!” Maiden He laughed and said, “What else could it be? Am I born to a bitter fate, bound to suffer the snares of this dusty net all my life, forbidden even to be a little lively without rebuke?” Tonghui chuckled, “Where do you get all these worldly sayings? Honestly, if you want to be my disciple, you must first sweep away these useless worldly trappings and cast them into the Eastern Ocean, entrusting them to Brother Zhang’s old acquaintance, the Dragon King, to keep safe in his crystal palace as a curious antique. Only then can I have a method to cultivate you. If you cling to these worldly ways, you cannot enter my gate; you might as well follow the Western Buddhists or Eastern Confucians and become a sage outside the world.”

Maiden He laughed again and said, “Dao Brother, don’t speak so sourly. Though I cannot be as carefree and transcendent as you, I firmly believe your style best preserves my true nature and suits my heavenly disposition, unshackled by any worldly net. Therefore, I am resolved to cultivate the path of immortality, and among all, your temperament and conduct are most fitting. Pray tell, do you think my words are no longer worldly? Can I avoid being sent to the crystal palace?”

Tonghui shook her head and laughed again, saying nothing of right or wrong, but told her, “I come by the order of Venerable Wenmei to rescue Zhang Guo. The Venerable knows Zhang Guo must have a rescuer, though he did not expect it to be Iron Crutch and you. He only instructed me to act according to circumstances. Having saved Zhang Guo, I was to find another important person. So I hurried here, learning you were all in this place and had already slain the three demons. I prepared to rescue Zhang Guo and then chat with you. But I arrived a bit late, and you had already taken the credit. When I reached the main camp, I saw you surrounded by soldiers. I cast a minor spell to let them play a while, so you could escape safely.”

Maiden He then understood and smiled, pointing at Tonghui. “I knew some immortal must have come to aid me—it was your trickery all along.” Tonghui laughed, “Had I not told you, I would have forgotten to withdraw the spell. I fear they have fought themselves to exhaustion.” Turning back toward the soldiers’ direction, she raised her hand and waved, saying, “Spare yourselves.” Maiden He asked, “These soldiers fought so fiercely—are their lives not in danger?” Tonghui laughed, “That was all under my command. When I want them dead, at the moment you slip away, each will have already arrived at the gates of the underworld. Why would I, a kind-hearted person, show mercy? But since they are good folk forced into service, already suffering greatly, how could I bear to harm them further? I only ask that they neither harm me nor hinder my affairs. So I cast the spell with great leniency. Didn’t you see them drop their weapons and fight barehanded?”

Maiden He nodded in admiration and praised the skill. Then she spoke of the matter of Meng Jiang and her husband. Tonghui suddenly sighed and said, “I was just about to tell you, and now you ask. As women, we cannot help but wish to protect good women in the human world, to keep them free from disaster and suffering, safe all their days. How could we sit idly by while Meng Jiang, so faithful and virtuous, suffers? Yet my master warned me sharply not to meddle in such affairs, lest I bring trouble upon myself. I asked again and again why such good people are not saved. Saving lives is our heavenly duty, so how could it be ‘idle business’ that brings sin? My master said they are destined to die; death brings release and reward. This matter belongs to Iron Crutch. When you meet him, you will understand. Though you have only just met me, you must have seen I am impatient and straightforward, unwilling to live in a dull shell. My master is otherwise fine, but when it comes to important matters, the more eager I am to know, the more he holds back, telling me a little today, a little tomorrow, slow and reluctant. It vexes me greatly. But I can only speak so much before you; I dare not question my master. He only said, ‘I send you to rescue your senior brother but forbid you to meddle in others’ affairs.’ After these words, his face changed and he scolded, ‘No more talk. Your senior brother’s troubles come from meddling. Do you want to taste prison life?’ That scared me into silence. I only hope to reach Senior Uncle Li soon to learn the truth. When I heard he had arrived here first, I was happier than if I had rescued Meng Jiang myself. Now, Dao Brother, have you heard Iron Crutch speak of the fate of Meng Jiang and her husband?”

Maiden He replied, “We only heard from Senior Brother that they are both destined to die, but we do not know the cause. We should ask him more, but I wonder how the couple fares now.”

Tonghui’s face grew sorrowful. “I know all about it and have already guessed. I am not afraid to speak freely, since you are one of us. Since Meng Jiang accompanied her husband here, hardly a day passes without her heart-wrenching cries—understandably so. The tyrant Huang wanted Meng Jiang for himself and devised a cruel scheme: he made Fan Qiliang the guardian of the Great Wall’s earth and trapped him inside the city moat. You probably know this.” Maiden He nodded, “I heard from Senior Brother’s disciple Zhongli Quan that your senior brother Zhang Guo, seeing injustice, rescued Fan Qiliang, thus causing this disaster.”

Tonghui nodded. “Indeed. But according to my master and senior brothers, might there be a heavenly decree in this? Otherwise, why would so many immortals help and yet fail to save their lives? Now Fan Qiliang has been buried alive by Meng Tian within the moat. When the coffin was sealed, Meng Jiang wept bitterly, begging Meng Tian to allow the couple one last meeting. If not, she vowed to die alongside her husband and never return to Xianyang. Meng Tian, helpless, ordered the workers to lift Fan Qiliang’s head from the earth. He was already faint, his face pale as death, unable to speak. At the sight of her husband, Meng Jiang cried out and spat blood before fainting. Meng Tian feared her waking and causing more trouble, so he had her carefully tended and quickly breached the city wall. A fine young man, for the sake of a beautiful wife, never to enjoy the bridal chamber, lost his life within the city wall. Under such a tyrant’s rule, the people’s fate is truly pitiful.”

Maiden He’s brows rose in anger, her rosy face turning pale; she was speechless for a long while. Tonghui continued, “Meng Jiang still remains in Meng Tian’s camp. I reckon she will soon join her husband in the underworld. By our powers, never mind that the demons are dead—even if the three demons were still alive, I alone could handle them. With your help, we could rescue her easily, especially since the guards are but a band of useless commoners. To save her would be no trouble at all. Yet my master has repeatedly warned me not to meddle in such affairs, which frustrates and angers me to no end.”

Maiden He said, “If your master commands so, and Iron Crutch has said the same, and since they say this ill-fated pair will find peace only after death, perhaps it is best to let them endure this momentary suffering to gain eternal happiness. If we rashly meddle with our limited skills, we might harm both ourselves and others. We must be cautious.” Tonghui sighed and said no more.

By then, they had arrived at Iron Crutch’s abode, where he and Fei Changfang and Zhongli Quan awaited them with smiles. “Old friends come from afar—what good fortune!” Tonghui stepped forward, saluted him grandly, and sent greetings from her master, Venerable Wenmei. Iron Crutch returned the salute with a smile and said, “Everything has its fate. Zhang Guo is your senior brother; it is strange that he had to be rescued by the young lady here, isn’t it?”

As they spoke, all entered and took their seats. Tonghui smiled at Maiden He, “You are the elder, and Zhang Guo is my senior brother. I ought to carry him, but since this is your merit and our first meeting, I did not wish to divide credit. Forgive me for the trouble.” This made Iron Crutch and Maiden He laugh heartily. Iron Crutch added, “I know you are just lazy, not petty. If you were, you would not be Tonghui.” Tonghui laughed again and then spoke with Fei Changfang and others about Daoist matters, while Iron Crutch alone fetched a cup of cold water and splashed it on Zhang Guo’s face. He said, “Zhang Guo has been poisoned by a deadly toxin from the sea. I can awaken him easily, but his stubborn body has not yet shed the poison from his heart. This careful treatment not only clears the toxin but also nourishes the spirit. In about half an hour, he will awaken and join your conversation.” All agreed.

Iron Crutch smiled at Tonghui, “Congratulations on your great skill, able even to read hearts and nearly kill our junior sister with your tricks.” Tonghui laughed loudly. Fei Changfang and others did not understand, so Maiden He recounted the story, and they laughed as well. Iron Crutch said, “This is no wonder. All immortals can know past and future, but the past is easy to see, the future hard to know. Those who know the future are ranked by how far ahead they see. Wenmei and I can foresee hundreds of years ahead. But those who see at a glance or sense intuitively only know the present. The future requires calculation. Tonghui can read hearts with unerring accuracy and transform objects large and small. Our junior sister is honest and simple, so naturally she was fooled.”

Maiden He and Tonghui exchanged smiles. Iron Crutch was about to speak further when Zhang Guo suddenly shouted, “What a bore!” and immediately awoke. Sitting up and opening his eyes, he saw Iron Crutch and Tonghui and doubted if he was still dreaming. Tonghui quickly comforted him and told him of the order to rescue him and that Maiden He had first freed him. Zhang Guo thanked them and turned to bow to Iron Crutch. Iron Crutch stopped him, and all remained seated. He asked Tonghui, “Did the master scold Zhang Guo for his rashness?” Tonghui laughed and replied, “I was just about to ask you about this. The master said when he saw you he would understand and hoped you would instruct him.”

Iron Crutch sighed, “Immortal powers can know past and future, but careless speech can defy Heaven’s decree and bring sin. As beginners, you blame your masters for withholding the future. Yet there are great differences: some things may be spoken today but not yesterday; some known to me but not to others; some heard but not all may listen. All depends on fate and decree, subtle and strict. There is no time now to explain. We must first rescue Meng Jiang’s soul and also collect her husband’s spirit. A moment’s delay only prolongs their suffering, which is unworthy of a benevolent heart.”

Having said this, he told Tonghui and Maiden He, “You two come with me.” Delighted, the two followed, and with a single step of earth-shrinking technique, they arrived at a place where a great army was bound to a high mountain by a large group of soldiers. There, a beautiful woman was tied up, and sharp blades were gouging chunks of her snow-white, tender flesh, to be thrown into the water. The woman was already dead and felt no pain, but those watching below closed their eyes, unable to bear the sight. Some could not hold back tears and wailed aloud. One person began to cry, and soon the whole crowd joined, their lamentations echoing through the valleys and shaking the mountains. The commanding officers on the mountain grew furious and ordered the soldiers to descend and kill the mourners. Terrified, the crowd scattered in panic. The soldiers pursued fiercely, capturing dozens.

At this moment, Tonghui could bear no more. Reckless of consequences, she turned and blew a breath toward the ground. Immediately, the sky darkened, the earth dimmed, and the sun lost its light. Sand and stones flew, striking the soldiers’ heads. Terrified, they cowered and fled, clutching their heads. The stones seemed to recognize their targets. Suddenly, a large stone flew up and struck the commanding officer’s head, splitting his forehead and drawing blood. Holding his head, he knelt and cried, “Heaven, have mercy!” Meanwhile, those captured seized the chance to escape.

Iron Crutch nodded and sighed, “Such villains are cruel indeed. Giving them a little suffering is not wrong, but no need to go too far.” He then formed a finger seal, and the winds calmed, the sun rose, and all was silent. Only the flesh from Meng Jiang’s body remained floating on the water’s surface, untouched by the wind. Iron Crutch, Tonghui, and Maiden He marveled silently. Iron Crutch said, “Let us transform these fragments into something that will remain forever in the world.” He traced a talisman with his finger, chanting earnestly, and shouted “Swift!” The fragments gathered as if by magic, merging into one. Iron Crutch then circled this mass dozens of times with his treasured sword. Each circle caused a ring of flesh to scatter, transforming into countless pure, delicate jade-like little fish, swimming out in all directions. When the last circle was drawn, the entire mass was dispersed, and the river was filled with these exquisite little fish, a truly beautiful sight. Iron Crutch raised his sword, shouted loudly, and suddenly the myriad little fish all nodded thrice toward him before scattering. Iron Crutch’s hand seemed to grasp something invisible, and he hurriedly opened a gourd, capturing it inside.

What this mysterious thing might be remains to be revealed in the next chapter.
