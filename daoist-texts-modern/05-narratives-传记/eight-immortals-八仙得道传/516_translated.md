# Chapter Forty-Eight: The Flesh of Lady Jiang Transforms into Silver Fish — The Dragon Soul Detained at Meng Po’s Pavilion

Now, it happened that Master Iron Crutch performed his magic. He first gathered together the scattered flesh of Lady Meng Jiang into a single mass, then carefully analyzed and dispersed it, transforming it into countless slender, pure white little fish. All these fish nodded in unison toward Master Iron Crutch before scattering in every direction. The master then stretched out his right arm, opening his palm over the water as if to scoop something up. At that moment, a faint, almost imperceptible white vapor flew into his palm. Hastily, he closed his hand and withdrew it, then opened his gourd and carefully placed the captured white vapor inside. Smiling, he said, “Now at last I have resolved a certain case. Let us return for now.” The Immortal Maiden and Tonghui eagerly asked, “What use is this?” Master Iron Crutch laughed and replied, “Do you not understand yet? This is the chaste soul of Lady Meng Jiang, sealed within my gourd. Once inside, it instantly regains human form, indistinguishable from her original self. Having obtained this soul, I must send her to the Underworld, instructing her to return to the mortal realm and begin early cultivation of the great dao. As for her husband, Fan Qi’s soul, when we first arrived here, other ghostly attendants had already escorted him to the netherworld.”

The two listened with great joy and then inquired about the principle behind flesh transforming into fish. Master Iron Crutch said, “There is no great mystery. Out of pity for her ill fate and respect for her chastity—since the person is dead and the soul must reincarnate—what use is the scattered flesh? I simply preserved some as a keepsake. First, it shows that Lady Meng Jiang is not only destined to become an immortal in her next life, but that her present life is immortal as well; second, it allows all future generations who see these fish to know they are the transformed remains of Lady Meng Jiang’s relics. In commemorating Lady Meng Jiang, it also serves to inspire others to strive for chastity and virtue. This is my way of using what is otherwise useless to subtly admonish the world. It has little direct relation to Lady Meng Jiang herself.”

Both exclaimed, “Lady Meng Jiang sacrificed herself as a woman for her husband’s sake, upholding her virtue unto death. To receive such praise is a glory that will endure through the ages, admired and emulated by countless women. Surely, this is no small matter.” Master Iron Crutch nodded, “That is true. Now, think of a name for these fish—something neither strange nor dull, but deeply fitting their shape and nature.” Tonghui laughed, “I am not so meticulous; let us ask Master He to consider it.” The Immortal Maiden modestly hesitated a moment before saying, “These fish are pure white like silver, and silver is a precious metal, befitting Lady Meng Jiang’s dignity. Shall we call them Silver Fish?” Hearing this, the two clapped their hands in approval.

From then on, many regions produced this kind of silver fish, passed down through the ages, all knowing they were the relics of Lady Meng Jiang transformed by immortal magic. Later, when Lü Dongbin attained the dao and traveled to the Xiang River, he once used wood shavings to create silver fish to serve as delicacies for a group of workers. There is a tragic tale connected with this, but that will be told later and not now.

Returning to Master Iron Crutch, he brought the soul documents of Lady Meng Jiang and Fan Qi to the Underworld. Though their bodies had perished, their love remained deep. Before the King of the Underworld, they wept and begged to be reunited as husband and wife in their next life. The King gently replied, “In your previous life, your marriage was unfulfilled, yet your fate remains intertwined in the next. There is no need to plead; you will naturally become a pair of mandarin ducks. But since Master Iron Crutch has brought you here, there must be a deeper purpose—some special cultivation planned for you. Human life rarely exceeds one hundred years; the most passionate years of marriage last but twenty at most. How much better to leap beyond the bonds of passion and enter the ranks of immortals, where husband and wife live forever, meeting for ten thousand years! You are all wise folk—can you not see this truth? Nowadays, mortals weary of the mundane world and desperately seek true immortals, hoping for some elixir of eternal youth. Yet among millions, only a handful succeed. Even your adversary, Emperor Qin Shi Huang, so powerful and fortunate, constantly seeks immortality and the dao, but all he gains are demons and deviant paths, causing only strange disturbances before ending in failure. In the end, not only is eternal life unattainable, but even a short life is not guaranteed. It is clear that to be born with immortal destiny is the greatest blessing from Heaven. You have no great merits or virtues, only Lady Meng Jiang’s single spark of chastity moved the immortals to exceptional care, extending grace even to Fan Qi. This is something millions and emperors alike cannot obtain. And yet you begrudge a mere twenty years of marital bliss?”

Hearing this, the two suddenly understood and kowtowed, saying, “We were indeed foolish, unable to see this before. We did not realize the deep intention behind the immortal master’s delivery of our souls. We are unworthy of such grace, and yet we long for the mundane world. We are truly ashamed. But now we worry: since we will be husband and wife again in the next life, how can we avoid the affairs of marriage? If the emotional bonds of the past life remain unbroken and we match harmoniously, who will awaken us to break through the realm of desire? How shall we manage?”

The King of the Underworld laughed heartily, “You are clever at twisting things! First you ask to be reincarnated as spouses, which is reasonable; now you turn around and want to undo the phoenix pair. Do you want me to hide in your bridal chamber, waiting for you to consummate your union, then suddenly jump out and strike you with a stick?”

His words, full of sly humor and subtle meaning, caused the judges, little ghosts, horse-face and ox-head demons, and even Fan Qi and Lady Meng Jiang to burst into laughter. Then a certain judge stepped forward and reported, “I have a method to ensure the couple do not lose their true nature. From the moment they leave the womb, they will remember their past life. If they sincerely become monastics, they can cultivate from childhood without needing anyone to awaken them, thus avoiding missteps. If their worldly desires remain and past feelings linger, that is their own abandonment of fortune. Then Your Majesty may command us to haunt their marital bed daily, but even so, there will be moments of carelessness, allowing them to enjoy their conjugal bliss comfortably. What does Your Majesty think?”

The King smiled and asked, “What is your plan?” The judge said, “It is no great scheme. Usually, souls reincarnating into the world must pass through a pavilion where the ‘soul-forgetting soup’ is served. When the soul reaches there, it is overcome with thirst and drinks a cup, instantly forgetting all past life memories. Yet many souls are stubborn and refuse to drink, suffering unbearable thirst and burning within. When they see a fragrant, palatable soup, they cannot help but drink. Thus, since ancient times, countless souls have reincarnated without remembering their past lives, because none can endure the torment of thirst. Now, since Your Majesty wishes to protect Lady Meng Jiang and Fan Qi, have them drink their fill here first, so that when they reach that pavilion, they will not be parched and will not need to drink the soul-forgetting soup. Once past that pavilion, they will walk the path of rebirth without suffering thirst.”

Before the King could reply, another clerk laughed and said, “That will not do. The great matter of reincarnation must have rules. If one can avoid drinking the soul-forgetting soup by simply filling up here, many would cheat. Who would want to forget their past life entirely? That is why from ancient times to now, few remember their past lives.”

The King nodded, “True, such a great matter must have rules. But I think there must be a way to make exceptions. Since the immortals have so graciously arranged this for them, I too must extend special favor and devise a method.” Then he gently instructed Lady Meng Jiang and Fan Qi, “You may withdraw for now. When a method is ready, you will be summoned again.” The couple kowtowed and departed.

According to old customs of the Underworld, all souls not yet assigned to reincarnation are given rooms in the palace, like apartments in the mortal world. But while mortal apartments are set up by communities, these dwellings are prepared by the palace itself—showing the Underworld’s special care for virtuous souls. This is mere background and need not be elaborated.

Lady Meng Jiang and Fan Qi lived in these palace rooms for many days. One day, the King sent word summoning them, saying, “The King has devised a method for you. Come quickly to the hall to receive instructions.” Overjoyed, the couple followed the ghostly attendants to the hall. The King smiled and said, “A fortunate coincidence has occurred. The old woman originally in charge of the soul-forgetting soup was dismissed for neglecting her duties and is seeking a suitable soul to replace her. By chance, your respected aunt—Fan Qi’s mother—knowing your misfortune, died from grief and vomiting blood. I pity her unjust death and, upon investigation, found her loyal and kind. In her youth, she accumulated great merit by preserving a person’s honor. By rule, she qualifies for an official post. Now she is appointed to oversee the pavilion’s affairs. Though demanding, it is an important position, and she can also manage your matters. Is this not good?”

Hearing that their mother had died for their sake, the couple were deeply moved. Since their own affairs were settled and their elder gained a post in the Underworld, their sorrow turned to joy. They thanked the King. The King then ordered Meng Po’s soul to be summoned to meet them. Mother and children reunited after death, inevitably embracing and weeping bitterly. Even the King, judges, and ghostly attendants were moved to tears. Meng Po angrily said, “The unrighteous, foolish King harmed my whole family. When his time comes here, I will seek revenge and vent our grievances.” The King laughed, “Emperor Qin was cruel and ruthless, tormenting the realm. Soon he too will arrive here, his sins unmitigated in death. He will be judged according to his deeds and punished accordingly, enough to satisfy your anger.”

The three thanked the King again. He spoke kindly a few more words, then dismissed them, ordering the ghostly attendants not to restrain them. After Meng Po formally took office, she could bring her daughter-in-law to her post, and when the time came to reincarnate, they could choose their own destinies. At this time, the soul-forgetting pavilion had no overseer, only a few clerks. Meng Po knew where to live and took her daughter-in-law inside, staying one day before formally assuming her duties the next.

From then on, Meng Po became the mistress of the pavilion, managing the soul-forgetting soup. Thus the pavilion came to be called Meng Po’s Pavilion, the origin of the name.

With Meng Po in charge, Lady Meng Jiang and Fan Qi lived in the pavilion, naturally spared the torment of thirst and needing no soul-forgetting soup. Meng Po was reluctant to part with them and let them stay for a long time. Later, the King learned of this and ordered the ghostly attendants to urge them to reincarnate quickly. Lady Meng Jiang was reborn in Linhuai Town, Jiangnan, into a family named Wang, given the name Yueying; Fan Qi was reborn in Jiangnan into a family named Lan, named Caihe. Both families were virtuous for generations. The mothers were pregnant for eighteen months without giving birth, causing great anxiety, as they feared a demon’s fetus. When the children were finally born—one boy, one girl—both were exceptionally pure, beautiful, and graceful.

Even more joyous was that before delivery, both mothers dreamed of a lame immortal holding an iron staff, at the end of which hung a tiny gourd, accompanied by two female immortals. The lame immortal said to the mothers, “You will bear children of great destiny who will bring blessings to the whole family. You must cherish and protect them carefully, never neglect or belittle them. To the boy’s family: when he marries, find a girl born the same year, month, and day. She is surnamed Wang from Jiangnan. Remember this well; if matched wrongly, great calamity will follow. To the girl’s family: she must marry a boy surnamed Lan from Jiangbei, born the same year, month, and day.”

The two mothers told their husbands and elders of the dream. Within half a day, both gave birth, and a strange fragrance filled the rooms, lingering all day. Even more astonishing, the children spoke immediately upon touching the ground, calling their parents “father” and “mother.” The neighbors were amazed and spread the news far and wide. The two families lived just across the river from each other in a densely populated area with a busy ferry crossing. Such strange events, combined with both families being among the most prominent locally, quickly became common knowledge. Each family sent people across the river to investigate the other’s situation and found the coincidences true. They then arranged for the children to meet. Upon seeing each other, the children showed great joy, each reaching out to hold the other’s hand, unwilling to let go. The boy said, “Sister, we have met again.” The girl shyly smiled and replied, “Brother, let us not forget the immortal master’s instructions.” These words perfectly matched their mothers’ dreams, and all realized the marriage was truly predestined by Heaven. Even more remarkable, the families were socially equal. They promptly arranged the marriage through a matchmaker, wedding on the full moon. What followed in their lives will be told later.

Thus it was that Master Iron Crutch delivered the soul documents of Lady Meng Jiang and Fan Qi to the Underworld, and at their rebirth, through dreams, personally accompanied by Immortal He and Tonghui, he enlightened them. Only after returning did he reveal to them the story of their past lives.

Who these two were in their former lives, and why they suffered such tragic fates, will be revealed in the next chapter.
