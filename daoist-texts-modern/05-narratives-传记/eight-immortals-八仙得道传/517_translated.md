# Chapter Forty-Nine: The Immortal Master of the Purple Mist Cavern Discusses Cause and Effect — The Heroic King Beneath the Sahā Tree Transforms into a Craftsman

Now it happened that Master Iron Crutch had settled the matter of the transmigration of the couple Fan and Meng. Leading a company of senior brothers and disciples, he journeyed together to the Purple Mist Cavern on Mount Hua. Fei Fei and Dian Dian knelt to welcome them inside. Master Iron Crutch took his place in the foremost chamber of the stone cavern, while he assigned He Xiangu and four others, dividing them by gender into two rooms on either side, to reside there. He dispatched Fei Fei and Dian Dian to attend to them separately. On this day, gathering all together, he expounded upon the meaning of the scriptures. The assembly felt as if a fresh draught had poured over their heads, their minds clear and spirits uplifted.

After the formal lesson, the Master turned to He Xiangu and the other four and said, “You have repeatedly asked me about the cause and effect of Fan Qiliang and Meng Jiangnu’s previous lives. Now I shall speak of it in broad strokes. In those days, there was a sovereign named Hou Yi, a man brave and skilled in archery. He once obtained the elixir of immortality from the Queen Mother of the West, intending to wait for a most auspicious day to thank her before daring to consume it. Thus, he entrusted the medicine temporarily to his consort Chang’e for safekeeping. Hou Yi was a cruel and ruthless man, addicted to war and conquest, long harboring ambitions to usurp the Son of Heaven and crown himself emperor. Chang’e often remonstrated with him, but he would not listen; instead, he regarded her as a thorn in his eye, wishing he could cleave her in two with a single stroke. Yet because her beauty was unmatched throughout the world, he could not bear to lose her, so he kept her alive as a mere plaything.

Chang’e was originally a handmaiden of the Queen Mother of the West, banished for some fault. Those with immortal affinities in past lives are naturally clever and quick-witted. Seeing how Hou Yi treated her, how could she not be on her guard? She longed to escape him early, to avoid falling victim to his cruelty. But Hou Yi’s vigilance was strict; she could not slip past the palace gates. Day after day, she sat in sorrow within her prison, helpless to save herself. It was not her fate to perish violently; Hou Yi was not destined for immortality. Having long neglected Chang’e, dealing with her only perfunctorily, he did not know what to do and, without realizing it, handed the immortal medicine to her.

The moment Chang’e took the elixir, she thought, ‘Whether it is efficacious or not, I am doomed to die sooner or later. Better to swallow it now. If it can lift me into the air, even if I do not become a true immortal, I can escape this peril and no longer fear his harm. If the elixir has no power, and I remain a mere pawn trapped in this deep palace, then when he returns and demands the medicine, will I still have a chance to live? If he kills me then, it would be better to end my own life immediately.’ So she placed near her all the means of suicide she could find — knives, ropes, and such — preparing that if the medicine failed to lift her, she would take her own life. All was ready; without hesitation, she took the medicine in hand and swallowed it. Instantly, a pure fragrance filled her heart and lungs, a delight unlike any before. The pill was no larger than a bean, swallowed whole without chewing. Chang’e felt her spirit clear and refreshed, her vital energy multiplied tenfold; her whole body seemed to lose all weight. Overjoyed, she closed her eyes and concentrated, sitting quietly for an hour. Then a surge of heat rose from the crown of her head down to the elixir field, spreading throughout her body; every bone and muscle moved with an extraordinary grace and speed.

This was because the Queen Mother of the West had forged the elixir in her Five Phases furnace, using the true fire of the sun, then refined it further with her own samadhi vital fire to dry and perfect it. Hou Yi, a tyrant as lawless as the present-day Ying Zheng, could never have been gifted such an immortal pill by the Queen Mother. In truth, she had calculated that Hou Yi would entrust the medicine to Chang’e, and by his hand, it would be delivered into her mouth, thus enabling her transcendence to Heaven. The Queen Mother’s divine calculations never err. Indeed, when Chang’e secretly took the medicine, she gained the power of lightness and flight, ascending to the heavens.

After sitting for a while, Chang’e suddenly thought, ‘Time does not wait. If I can escape, I must hurry; if not, I should die soon to avoid his arrows.’ She rose swiftly and stepped out into the courtyard, looking up at the sky, where a bright moon hung high. She thought, ‘The moonlight is so pure, the scenery in the Moon Palace must be exquisite. If I can fly into the Moon Palace and dwell there a while, even if Hou Yi pursues me with wild arrows, I would be content to die.’ With this thought, unexpectedly, a new immortal affinity was formed. She felt her feet lift lightly from the ground, floating into the air. At first, her flight was slow, but gradually she rose higher and faster, reaching halfway to the heavens. Amidst her mingled joy and fear, Hou Yi happened to return, and by chance looked up, seeing a beautiful woman soaring among the clouds. Amazed, he fixed his keen eyes — sharper than ordinary, the source of his divine archery skill — and recognized his beloved consort Chang’e. Furious, he roared like thunder. Fortunately, he carried his bow and arrows, quickly drawing a full arrow and shooting at Chang’e.

Yet, though swift, Hou Yi’s arrow was not faster than her cloud flight. This was because Chang’e had no true dao skill; ascending with a mortal body lacked the power of genuine immortals, so her cloud-riding was far inferior. Hou Yi’s aim was precise and deadly; how could his arrow miss? After the whizzing sound, a cry rang out in midair. Poor delicate Chang’e, how could she withstand it? Luckily, she was still airborne; the arrow’s force waned at the end, only wounding her toe. The pain made her dizzy; she could not stand and tumbled head over heels, feet skyward, rolling to the ground. Hou Yi rejoiced and hurried to seize her. The spot where Chang’e fell was but a hundred paces from where he stood. Hou Yi strode forward, desperate to catch her, but strangely, no matter how hard he chased, he could not close the distance. Suspecting his eyes were blurred by drink, he summoned many soldiers to capture Chang’e. Poor Chang’e, a lone frail woman, already faint from her fall, could hardly withstand the rough treatment of those warriors.

At this point, Master Iron Crutch paused, and the listeners all felt indignation for Chang’e, especially Tong Hui, He Xiangu, and Fei Fei — women by nature, their hearts softer than men’s. Beyond their sympathy, they clenched their fists, each sweating coldly. Tong Hui, impatient, could not wait for more and hurriedly asked, “Master Uncle, could it be that Chang’e was indeed killed by that tyrant? Could the leader of the immortals, the Queen Mother of the Jade Pool, have deceived us with a fake medicine?”

Master Iron Crutch did not answer immediately. Just then, Zhongli Quan chuckled softly. Master Iron Crutch did not respond to Tong Hui’s question but smiled gently and asked Zhongli Quan, “Ah Quan, why do you laugh?”

Zhongli Quan replied, “I laugh because this senior brother’s question is too foolish, yet his temper is even more impatient than mine. He cannot wait for the Master to finish and rashly asks such silly things. Have you not heard the saying ‘Chang’e of the Moon’? Chang’e still dwells in the Moon Palace today. If she had truly died by Hou Yi’s arrow, how could she still be there?”

Hearing this, Master Iron Crutch laughed heartily and nodded. “Your reasoning indeed answers Tong Hui’s question. Though it seems foolish, it has merit. Know that the clearest brilliance in the world is the moon. The realm within the moon surpasses even the distant Penglai Isles and the fairy mountains upon the sea in its purity and tranquility. No matter how beautiful or refined Chang’e is, her mortal body remains a worldly vessel, and she was once the consort of a tyrant king. Such a body is the most defiled in the Moon Palace. Though you have not yet attained the Great Dao, you know the Lord of the Moon Star is the ruler of the Moon Palace. She is the Jade Emperor’s third princess, residing close to him. Who else could be as noble as she? Yet her nature is strange and erratic, seeing both Heaven and Earth without a trace of elegance. Though placed in the Heavenly Palace, she dwells like a captive beast, never smiling in comfort. The Jade Emperor once inquired if there were any places of supreme purity and beauty to offer the princess for quiet cultivation. But the princess herself chose a corner of the Moon Palace as most fitting. Beyond that, there is no pure place on Earth or in Heaven suitable for her. The Emperor had no choice but to appoint her as the Lord of the Moon Star and grant the Moon Palace as her residence. Only then did the princess find peace and contentment. Her lofty purity is so formidable that even Chang’e’s refinement cannot compare to her spotless, detached being. Chang’e’s impurity lies only in having been Hou Yi’s consort. As for her character, she is unlike ordinary people and possesses a certain refined and transcendent quality. Moreover, she has always loved the bright moon, and even in hardship, she longed to return to the Moon Mansion, fulfilling a long-cherished wish. Though dead, she harbors no resentment. On this point, she shares sympathy with the Moon Lord.”

Master Iron Crutch continued, “By chance, the Moon Lord was returning from an inspection of the Heavenly Palace and passed this place. She suddenly sensed Chang’e’s sincere heart and could not help but lower her gaze through layers of clouds, using her divine sight to observe the mortal realm. She saw Chang’e wandering in sorrow and longing. The Moon Lord pondered and understood the matter but, moved by Chang’e’s love for the moon and pitying her harsh fate, wished to rescue her into the palace to serve at her side. Yet, she hesitated, for Chang’e’s body was still impure, and she feared displeasing the Queen Mother. While in thought, Chang’e suddenly soared upward, flying swiftly toward the Moon Palace. The Moon Lord, still uncertain, saw Hou Yi draw his bow and shoot Chang’e down. Seeing this, she was glad and quickly extended her index finger, drawing a line in the air that lengthened the distance between Hou Yi and Chang’e by three or four leagues. Turning to her attendant celestial officials, she said, ‘I wish to take Chang’e back to the palace, but her body is too defiled, and I fear I cannot explain this to the Queen Mother. Now that she has fallen, her body must be broken and her soul surely out of the body. You must hurry to bring her living soul to me. As for her stubborn corpse, though impure, it must not fall into Hou Yi’s hands. Use divine wind to carry it to a deserted place by the sea and burn it to ashes. Then return to the Jade Pool and report this to the Queen Mother.’ The officials received the decree and began the ritual. They watched Chang’e’s soul leave her body and seized it. At the same time, a great wind arose, carrying her corpse to a vacant spot by the sea, where the local earth deity was summoned to burn her remains to ash. Another gust scattered the ashes without a trace. Because Chang’e had taken the immortal elixir, she only fainted briefly upon falling and did not die outright. Had the Moon Lord not seized her soul, she might have revived and suffered Hou Yi’s cruelty again, truly caught between life and death. Thanks to the celestial officials taking her soul and the Moon Lord extending the distance, Hou Yi, though cruel, could not seize even her body, which was swept away by the wild wind to the seaside. Hou Yi could only stamp his feet in frustration and return to the palace in anger.”

Master Iron Crutch paused here, and Tong Hui laughed, saying, “So it turns out Chang’e had to die before things could turn out well. Master Uncle, why did you not say so earlier? We wasted our breath worrying over the ancients for nothing!”

Master Iron Crutch smiled, “A person who does not pass through danger and hardship cannot become a true man. How much less can the way of immortals be gained without trial? It is not something to be obtained casually.” Zhongli Quan laughed, “From my view, the Queen Mother’s elixir is not entirely miraculous. It claims to grant immortality, yet a single divine arrow causes fainting? Without the Moon Lord extending the path and sending officials to seize her soul, Chang’e would surely have died at Hou Yi’s hands. Does this mean the elixir is powerless?” Tong Hui and He Xiangu both laughed, “You say too much. How could the Queen Mother’s elixir lack power? As you say, Chang’e’s body is mortal — how could she reach the heavens? How could one without dao power follow the Moon Lord and join the ranks of immortals? If she died by misfortune, that is another matter, unrelated to the medicine’s effect. Do you suppose that taking the elixir grants license to act recklessly, immune to sword, fire, or water? That would make it a talisman against all harm, a wish-fulfilling pearl of immortality!”

Master Iron Crutch laughed and nodded. “Nowadays many foolish people seek the immortal way without cultivation, even raising alchemists and charlatans to refine mercury and pills, thinking such things grant eternal life, so they need not do good deeds and invite suffering upon themselves. Such minds are truly foolish to the extreme. The immortal elixir only strengthens sinews and bones, aiding your cultivation efforts. It neither concerns the heavenly immortal’s work nor greatly benefits the study of mind and character. Those who take the elixir must redouble their practice, so that the power of the pill resonates with their effort, producing mutual enhancement and doubling the effect. If, as you say, one takes the elixir and then acts recklessly, not only will the pill’s power be null, but can they avoid heavenly punishment? Can the power of Heaven not cause them to die suddenly?” Such words made the assembly laugh heartily.

Master Iron Crutch went on, “Chang’e’s arrival in the Moon Palace was her safe haven, where she naturally followed the Moon Lord joyfully, living carefree and free of worries. But Hou Yi was not one to suffer loss lightly. He was originally the earthly incarnation of the Black Tiger Fiend Star from Heaven, trained by a famous master from youth, possessing some foundation. Yet his behavior was unrighteous and reckless, so he fell into the demonic path. At that time, a member of a demonic cult told him that Chang’e was now in the Moon Palace and taught him the art of flight. With bow in hand, he vowed to storm the Moon Palace, demanding the Moon Lord hand over Chang’e, threatening to destroy the palace and kill all the immortals if refused. How laughable — the Moon Palace is so pure and serene, never before disturbed by such a wild man or such turmoil. The Moon Lord, leisurely in her deep palace, knew nothing of warfare or defense. All the immortals there obeyed her, living peaceful and carefree lives. None could have dreamed that over one woman, such unprecedented trouble would arise. Even if the Moon Lord foresaw it, she was careless and never imagined such violence could occur in such a pure place.

At that moment, while chatting with a group of celestial attendants about courtly matters, a sudden uproar outside the palace startled her. Among the shouts of killing, the name Chang’e was called repeatedly. The Moon Lord composed herself and sighed, ‘Wretched pest, how dare this beast be so unruly as to come here? Surely some evil person taught him sorcery to dare come alone. I have always been too careless, never calling soldiers to guard. Moreover, my nature is quiet and uncompetitive, shunning worldly glory. I willingly guard this lonely, remote place, abhorring war and the cruel weapons of battle. Now, in a moment of crisis, I must call for Heaven’s aid, but it is too late. Must I personally go out to quell this demon? Though bold, would he dare be rude to me? Yet it would shame me and contradict my usual ways. What to do?’ While pondering, Chang’e knelt, weeping and reporting, ‘Because of me, Moon Lord, you have been alarmed, and the officials, sisters, and people have suffered. My guilt is great. I beg you to hand me over to the demon to end the strife and prevent further disaster.’ She wept bitterly. The Moon Lord, angry, said, ‘What nonsense is this? You are here with me; you belong to me. The Queen Mother would not summon you back for my sake; how could a demon abduct you? Not only would I lose face before the Queen Mother, but all the immortals in the Moon Palace are pure maidens. If any villain learned evil arts and came to demand them, would I hand them over one by one? This is unreasonable and must not become a precedent. You step back; I have a plan.’ 

Chang’e dared not speak further, kowtowed, and withdrew to one side. The Moon Lord thought a moment and ordered the elder Wu Gang to enter. She sent a celestial official to speak to Hou Yi: ‘The Moon Lord decrees that Chang’e is to return to her former mistress, the Queen Mother of the Jade Pool. She has summoned her back. You must wait patiently and not cause disorder or bring heavenly punishment upon the Moon Mansion.’ Hou Yi bowed and obeyed.

The official returned with the report, and Wu Gang arrived. The Moon Lord instructed, ‘Hou Yi, using his sorcery, has disturbed the Moon Palace and spoken arrogantly, demanding Chang’e. You are to deliver this decree: Though Hou Yi is Chang’e’s husband, his violent nature is intolerable. Heaven punishes him for seizing his wife. Their fate is not yet complete; their red thread may be renewed. But Hou Yi’s intrusion into the Moon Palace is unforgivable. Yet, considering their marital bond and his rashness, the matter may be forgiven. The Moon Lord plans to build a hundred jade mansions in the western garden. The first task is to cut down the great Sahā tree blocking the way. Hou Yi, famed for unmatched bravery, is ordered to cut the tree and redeem his sins. Only after completing this may Chang’e be returned to him to bring back to the mortal realm.’ Hearing this, Hou Yi thought, ‘I am unmatched in valor and strength, with no rival in Heaven or Earth. Ten days ago, I shot down nine suns by the command of Emperor Yao. Such a task is trivial; it will be done in no time.’

He bowed repeatedly, proclaiming obedience. Wu Gang handed him a great saw and led him to the Sahā tree in the garden, urging him to begin at once. He hung a basket of wine and food on a branch, smiling, ‘Your divine courage and strength are rare since ancient times. This small task should not take longer than a meal. I hang this basket for you to refresh yourself when the tree falls and the basket descends.’ Hou Yi laughed, ‘No need for so long. Watch me.’ Squatting firmly, he prepared to saw the tree. Wu Gang, following the Moon Lord’s orders, recited incantations, drew several circles around Hou Yi’s seated form, and shouted sharply. Hou Yi felt as if rooted to the spot, unable to move. He realized he had fallen into their trap.

Yet Hou Yi was a tough man. Not only did he not grow angry, but he smiled and said brightly, ‘Our affairs are contests of wit and strength. How laughable that I, a hero of unmatched talent and a great man of my age, should be fooled for a moment by your trick. You see, my skill is no match for the Moon Lord’s. If so, I must submit to her authority and not stubbornly resist. But there is one thing I must say: Though I was wrong to storm the Moon Palace, as the Moon Lord said, it was for the sake of my wife, and that is understandable. Since the Moon Lord has consented, I dare not disobey. I bow with utmost respect, for she is the Jade Emperor’s princess, as revered as his golden image. We are all stars beneath the Jade Emperor’s dome; how dare I not obey? But for the Moon Lord’s sake, to use such deceit to lure me into her snare for the sake of Chang’e, a lowly servant — my life is nothing, but how will future generations regard the Moon Lord as a deity?’ His words were sharp and reasonable.” At this, Master Iron Crutch’s narration ended, and the assembly laughed.

As for how Wu Gang dealt with Hou Yi, Master Iron Crutch could not recall at the moment. To know how Wu Gang responded, one must wait patiently for the next chapter.
