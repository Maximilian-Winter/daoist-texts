# Chapter Fifty: Punishing the Tyrant—Sawing the Great Tree in the Moon; Pitying the Former Lord—The Spirit Mansion Is the Pass of Affection

Now, it was said that Master Iron Crutch recounted how Hou Yi was ensnared and confined, and though he spoke a few stubborn words, they were cunning and reasonable. The crowd hurried to ask, “How did Elder Wu respond to him?” Master Iron Crutch smiled and said, “Why the rush? Consider this: the Star Lord of the Moon Mansion is a celestial immortal of such sharp wit and cleverness that she needs no questioning; she already has ready replies prepared. In the records above, the Star Lord instructs Wu Gang thus and so, which includes these very words.”

Then Master Iron Crutch continued: “At once, Wu Gang smiled and said to Hou Yi, ‘Don’t brag and be obstinate, slandering the Star Lord. To be frank, our Star Lord—what is her rank, what divine powers does she possess? How many Great Luo Golden Immortals bow before her with utmost reverence? The Queen Mother of the Jade Pool, sovereign of the immortals; the Primordial Lord Laozi, patriarch of the immortals—when they see the Princess, they do not presume to take precedence. This you well know. She wields such vast potency and authority; could she truly fear a mere petty sinner like you? First, the Moon Mansion is a place of serene seclusion; many unblessed immortals cannot even hope to visit here. For the Princess is the purest and loftiest being among all humans and immortals, ancient and present. Ordinary immortals cannot meet her—not only can they not see her, they cannot even set foot on an inch of the Moon Palace grounds. This too you know. Would she cause a small disturbance on your account and then go to Heaven’s Court, petition the Jade Emperor, dispatch generals and troops, and mobilize forces against you? Not to mention, such a fuss is unnecessary. Even if a host of heavenly soldiers and divine generals came to station here for a moment, the Princess would surely not endure it. If she does not lightly wield arms, would she then personally appear and spar with a lowly creature like you? Would that not be a greater insult to her status? With all these difficulties, having no choice, she must resort to a small stratagem, leading you here to undertake this task. But what you say about the Princess coaxing you—that is not true. The Princess did not decree you to saw down this tree as a place to make merit and atone. Did you not yourself swear to obey the decree and willingly come to work? Now the project has not yet begun, and the Princess fears you will start but not finish, sawing halfway, then grow bored, and having newly acquired the art of flight, suddenly abandon the task and fly down to the mortal world. Then the tree would remain half-sawed, leaving this great Sahā tree with skin and bone still intact. Imagine how unsightly that would be! After much thought, you, this barbarian, are not amenable to gentle persuasion. So she must again use immortal magic to temporarily restrain you. For now, say no more. Just work hard at sawing the tree. When the tree is cut through, that will be the moment you regain your freedom—and the day you and your wife descend to the mortal realm. The Princess has never once broken her promise to you. How can it be called deceit?’”

Hou Yi heard this and said nothing. At first, he was angry and unwilling to work. Later, he thought: “The basket of food and wine hangs on the treetop. Unless I saw down the tree, the basket cannot come down. Judging by this, besides the basket’s contents, there is no other food or drink for me. When hunger strikes and I cannot endure it, I must exert all my strength to saw down the tree and then demand Chang’e back from her. Since she prides herself on faithfulness, surely she will not create further obstacles.” Thinking thus, he swallowed his anger and summoned all his strength to saw the Sahā tree. Though the trunk was large, it could not withstand Hou Yi’s innate divine strength; his two arms alone could break it, let alone with the aid of a tool. In just a few hours, he had cut it through. The treetop fell down, but in a strange twist, the trunk leaned outward while the basket slid inward, swiftly falling into Hou Yi’s hands. Looking at the basket, it was only slightly larger than a fist, but filled with wine and food—could such a thing satisfy Hou Yi’s vast, bloodthirsty appetite?

At this moment, Hou Yi’s hunger burned fiercely, almost unbearable. Seeing this, he was both angry and sorrowful. Angry that the Star Lord wished to trick him; sorrowful that he could not fill his belly. He thought, “What use is this trifling thing, even if I eat it? I wanted to throw it away, but the aroma of the food and wine is unlike ordinary fare—fragrant, sweet, and delicious. I cannot help but drool in waves.”

He then thought, “Since the work is done and the matter settled, why quarrel or fret? Now that there is good wine and food, I might as well eat it first, then go find Elder Wu Gang. I’m not afraid he won’t properly compensate me.” So he poured out the wine and drank deeply, then ate the food. Strange things happened again. The empty basket soon refilled with wine and food. Hou Yi rejoiced: “So this basket has such benefits? When I see Elder Wu Gang again, I must beg him to generously give it to me.” Emboldened, he filled his belly, eating three hundred and fifty baskets in a row before feeling fully satisfied and comfortable. The basket remained as before, still full of fresh, sweet white rice and fragrant fine wine. Hou Yi laughed: “What a marvelous thing! Carry this with me, and I can travel the world, through ten provinces and three islands, without worrying about food. Truly wondrous.”

No sooner had he spoken than the basket slipped from his hands, whistling swiftly back to its place on the treetop. Hou Yi was startled. Just as he hesitated, a rushing wind blew fiercely; the tree’s shadows scattered and dazzled his eyes. Sawdust on the ground whipped into the air, stinging his eyes. Hou Yi hurriedly closed them, cursing the sudden wind. After a while, the wind ceased and all was silent. Opening his eyes, he cried out bitterly. The cut in the tree had been mended; it stood trembling and towering in midair, reaching high into the clouds. Not only was there no trace of the sawed mark, but even the sawdust had vanished. At this point, Hou Yi felt deeply grieved but dared not curse the Star Lord. He only cursed the demon who taught him to fly and tricked him into the Moon Palace, causing him such suffering. Having long dwelt as a mortal, he did not know the power of heavenly immortal magic. If he called himself a heavenly Golden Immortal, how could he not understand the laws of the Moon Palace? The Star Lord casually played this trick and left him caught between life and death, unable to advance or retreat. That demon, lacking the ability to overcome others and not helping him personally, led him into this great trap—surely with malicious intent. Thinking thus, he wished to fly down immediately and shoot that demon three or four hundred times, piercing his flesh and skin, to vent his anger.

After venting his rage, he sat dazed for a while. Seeing the sky darken, his ignorant belly and naïve intestines, unmindful of their master’s pain, began to rumble and clamor, causing Hou Yi great distress. He thought, “They share my joys and sorrows; I cannot bear to let them suffer. But unless I saw the tree again, the food and drink will never come down.” Helpless, he sighed deeply, bowed his head, and resumed the same game. He worked until the tree was cut through again. Once more, the basket came down with the torch’s light, and he ate and drank his fill. The basket again filled with food and wine, rolling back to its original place. Hou Yi suddenly thought to press the broken wood firmly, preventing it from rejoining. But no sooner had he thought this than a fierce wind arose, stronger than before. Along with sawdust, sand and stones blew fiercely, nearly blinding Hou Yi and causing tears to stream uncontrollably. This turmoil lasted two or three hours. Impatient by nature, with eyes aching unbearably, he wished for a small knife to gouge out his eyeballs. Finally, calm returned; tears stopped; pain and itch ceased; the wind faded. He dared to open his eyes—and was furious beyond words.

The tree he had cut twice was once again fused, standing tall into the clouds, unreachable. A basket hung high on the treetop, like a watermelon growing there, swaying in the wind—amusing, yet maddening. Hou Yi was dumbfounded, like a wooden statue, frozen for a long while. Seeing no solution, he resolved to endure. Later, he devised a plan: when the basket came down, he would not eat but first press the broken tree. But, as if the tree were sentient, whenever Hou Yi touched it, a great wind would arise, nearly blinding him again. The basket returned as usual, the broken tree rejoined. Though angry, his belly remained ignorant of danger, his intestines unworldly, still hungry and thirsty, still demanding food, still requiring him to saw the tree. So it went, day after day. After two days, Hou Yi grew resigned, prepared to serve as a small laborer indefinitely, abandoning all ambition to seize or usurp imperial power.

Two days in Heaven equaled several months on Earth. At this time, a poor kingdom had lost its king, and chaos reigned in the court. The kingdom’s great and minor deities petitioned Heaven’s Court. The Jade Emperor discovered Hou Yi was now with the Princess; he also learned that Hou Yi’s reign had lasted over five hundred years, but due to his lack of virtue and harm to the people, his mandate had been revoked and he would soon be slain by his ministers. The Jade Emperor commanded Venus, the Great White Metal Star, to deliver an edict ordering Hou Yi’s body returned to suffer the consequences of being usurped. As for his living soul, it could remain in the Moon Palace, forever assigned to saw the tree as a substitute for the punishment of the underworld. Until his suffering equaled his sins, he was forbidden to reincarnate elsewhere.”

Master Iron Crutch paused here, and the author interjected a few words to inform the reader. The story of Hou Yi’s flight into the Moon Palace has been told for ages. Many scientists, geographers, and explorers say the moon, like other planets, has people, cities, and institutions. According to Chinese tradition spanning thousands of years, the Moon is governed by the Moon Star Lord, and there is a person there who endlessly saws the great Sahā tree, which breaks and mends continuously. A basket of food and wine hangs on the tree, descending when the tree is cut and rising when it mends—just as this book describes. However, the storytellers are ignorant, mistaking Chang’e for the Moon Star Lord and not knowing who the sawyer is or why he endures such suffering. Since the rise of modern science and new theories, such ancient tales have been dismissed as superstition. Scholars, unable to find evidence of the Moon’s inhabitants, have tried to reconcile new science with old stories, often treating the Moon’s conditions as idealized. Whether this is true, no one can say for sure. In the author’s view, many ancient Chinese traditions verge on philosophy, while outsiders speak purely of science. The two often contradict each other. Yet careful study reveals some harmony. For example, lightning strikes: scientists say it is electric shock, which is partly true. According to this book, lightning is still governed by heavenly gods. Otherwise, why do ancient and modern accounts say those struck by lightning are usually wicked or evil, never upright gentlemen? Though this may seem arbitrary, staunch atheists have no better evidence to offer. If lightning’s nature is thus, then the Moon Palace’s conditions may be similarly understood. It is said that Xu Fu, when crossing the sea, met immortals and established a kingdom with people and governance. Before Xu Fu’s arrival, how could the locals not be immortal folk? Otherwise, why would the immortals grant that land to Xu Fu? By analogy, perhaps the Moon Palace, like that sea kingdom, was granted by the Moon Star Lord as a colony for humans. Perhaps she clings to purity and will not allow humans to intrude. All this remains uncertain. If one blindly believes a few explorers who claim the Moon is like Earth, inhabited by humans with no immortals, that is as unconvincing as denying divine lightning. Enough idle talk; let us return to the main story.

Master Iron Crutch said: “The Jade Emperor ordered the Moon Star Lord to seize Hou Yi’s soul and release his body to suffer punishment. The Star Lord naturally obeyed. Imagine a person without soul—how could he do anything well? Hou Yi returned home again, like a madman or fool. Soon he was killed by Han Zhuo, utterly defenseless. With Hou Yi’s death, half his sins were expiated, and by custom, he should enter the underworld to face judgment. The Jade Emperor, however, granted special favor, allowing him to endure five thousand more years of torment in the Moon Palace, after which he would regain his celestial rank and return to the original post of the Black Tiger Star. This was the best outcome. Yet Hou Yi was a man given to lust; though his soul was seized, his infatuated heart still clung to Chang’e. Whenever she came to the garden to pick flowers, sweep bamboo, or roam the mountains and waters, he would wail and call out, his voice heard far and wide. At first, Chang’e ignored him. But as time passed and feelings shifted, ordinary people often forget grudges but remember kindness. Chang’e, being gentle and loyal, hearing such pitiful cries, could not help but feel moved. Though Hou Yi had a thousand faults, he had at least one good quality. Now his soul was imprisoned in the Moon Palace, enduring the scorching sun, rain, wind, and frost all year round, all because of himself. Having become an immortal, she had never suffered any loss or hardship from him, but he bore the punishment for her. Past days aside, how could he endure the coming thousand years? Moreover, though the Star Lord may not have heard his cries, the circle of sisters all took it as news and laughed at Chang’e, saying she had no heart, leaving her husband in such a plight. How could she not show mercy and plead for him before the Star Lord? Such mockery troubled her deeply. For these two reasons, Chang’e’s heart unknowingly grew pity for Hou Yi.”

Master Iron Crutch paused here. The few listening female immortals sighed to each other, “The most unfathomable thing in the world is this matter of affection! How pitiful, how pitiful.” Zhongli Quan, still young and naive to worldly ways, suddenly snorted with laughter and said, “You two are women at heart, born more merciful than us. Beware! The Master just said Chang’e has compassion. Though the ending is unknown, surely she will descend to the mortal world for a while. Perhaps she is the previous incarnation of Meng Jiangnu, who can say? Since you are so tender-hearted, if someday someone speaks to you of love and affection, you may pity their earnest passion and stir up mortal thoughts. Then the Master will not be able to help either of you!”

At these words, Zhang Guo and Fei Changfang were struck dumb, while the Immortal Maiden and Tong Hui snorted coldly, their faces flushing red with anger.

Master Iron Crutch quickly scolded, “A child who does not understand must not recklessly judge others. Especially when speaking to women, one must be cautious. What you just said was utterly frivolous and shameless. Such words are unacceptable to others, let alone to one’s own fellow disciples and senior brothers. Such speech shortens life and diminishes merit. This is your own fault and loss, no one else’s. If you are careless again, I will not dare meet you.” His words made Zhongli Quan sweat profusely and prostrate himself. The Immortal Maiden and others could not bear to see this and each took a hand to help him up, smiling. Zhongli Quan apologized repeatedly. Master Iron Crutch comforted him a little and then continued, “Earlier, Ah Quan guessed that Chang’e was the previous incarnation of Meng Jiangnu. That guess was quite accurate. Chang’e pities Hou Yi and wishes to stop his wailing. She longs to meet him again, but is timid and fearful. Whenever one has thoughts of love, they deepen day by day, hard to escape. When passion grows intense, even great danger is risked to try. Chang’e’s feelings are thus impure. At first, she was timid and her love shallow, barely restraining herself. Now, after about a year, her heart has warmed further. Though she dares not visit openly, she frequents nearby places more often, sometimes even coming to the Sahā tree, pretending to watch him work. When Hou Yi sees her, he treasures her like a precious gem, speaking only of self-pity and regret. At times, overcome with emotion, he pauses work, raising his large fan-like palms to beat his own body fiercely. This makes Chang’e deeply uneasy. At first, she tried to soothe him with words; later, she shed tears for him. From then on, they met day and night, old grievances dissolved. Hou Yi begged her to find a way to save him. Chang’e, blaming her low rank and small position, dared not agree outright, but was anxious for him and wished to find a chance to probe the Star Lord’s attitude and reason with her. Yet before opportunity came, she herself brought about a great calamity.”

Master Iron Crutch stopped here. The quick-tongued Zhongli Quan could not help but laugh again: “Surely the Star Lord knows of this and will refuse her.”

What great calamity Chang’e caused remains to be revealed in the next chapter.
