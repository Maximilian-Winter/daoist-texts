# Chapter Fifty-One: The City Filled and Oaths Sealed Will Surely Be Answered — New Affections Bind, Yet Good Deeds Come to Naught

Now, Iron Crutch Master turned to Zhongli Quan and said, “You have guessed rightly once again. Since you are so fond of guessing, I shall test you further. Tell me, could that Houyi be the very one who offended her—could he be the former incarnation of Fan Qiliang, both of them exiled together to the mortal realm?” Zhongli Quan, without much hesitation, smiled and replied, “In my humble view, Houyi is absolutely not Fan Qiliang’s former self, nor did he descend to the mortal world alongside Chang’e. How can this be? Houyi’s crimes were grave and monstrous; the Jade Emperor himself judged his case, decreeing that after five thousand years of confinement, he must return to his original place among the stars. Heaven’s decree is fixed—how could it be reversed? Moreover, the couple Meng Jiangnu and her husband, having received the grace of our master, were sent to the Underworld and then reincarnated into the mortal realm. Our master has already prepared their liberation from the cycle of birth and death, showing that their future is extraordinarily bright. If Houyi were such a demon, how could he share such a fate? It is clear that Meng Jiangnu is indeed Chang’e descended to the mortal world, while Fan Qiliang is someone else entirely. As for who he really is, or why he and Meng Jiangnu have been husband and wife for two lifetimes, that is beyond my understanding. There is yet another clear proof: for hundreds and thousands of years, even until now, we can still see in the moonlight the great sal tree, the rice basket hanging from its branches, and a person crouching beneath it—this is plainly the Houyi story our master told us. It shows that since his banishment, Houyi has never left the sal tree beneath the moon palace by a single step. As our master said, the Jade Emperor’s sentence was lenient. Having already been merciful, how could it be further reduced? I fear that before the five thousand years are up, the Black Tiger Star Officer will have no hope of returning to his place. Yet during those five thousand years, all who look up can see Houyi suffering beneath the sal tree in the moon palace, sawing at the tree. This is his self-inflicted punishment. Except for the Jade Emperor’s great pardon, who else could reduce his sentence, save him from descent, and grant him the grace of our master to become a true immortal upon liberation?”

As Zhongli Quan finished this discourse, the four fairies and immortals all laughed. Iron Crutch Master nodded with a smile and said, “This child is truly clever. It is remarkable how he can speak so insightfully without hesitation, perfectly matching the facts without a single error. Is this not supreme wisdom? At that time, Chang’e, moved by her feelings for Houyi, was lost in infatuation, day by day more bewitched. How could the star lords not hear of it? Once they knew, they were naturally furious beyond measure, immediately summoning her, sternly reprimanding her, and punishing her by casting her down to the mortal world. Chang’e, knowing her grave fault, dared not plead for mercy; she could only prostrate herself, weeping silently without a word. Yet the star lords felt some pity and secretly employed divine calculation to assess her fate. They furrowed their brows deeply, their faces darkening with sorrow, then ordered Chang’e to rise and stand aside to await further decree. Meanwhile, they summoned the Old Man Under the Moon to the hall to inquire personally about matters of marriage in the mortal realm. If the union could not be harmonious, the bond of husband and wife could be dissolved. The Old Man reported: ‘Everything has a fixed destiny. Those destined to unite cannot be separated even by force. Some unions are only nominal, without true marital ties. This nominal bond was fixed five hundred years ago and cannot be escaped.’ The Old Man then asked, ‘May I confirm that this decree concerns Chang’e?’ The star lord nodded slightly. The Old Man continued, ‘This matter was decided long ago. Chang’e’s fate requires her to marry a mortal for two lifetimes, thereby establishing her foundation and securing her place forever among the immortals. Star lord, you need not grieve for her.’”

Hearing this, the star lord nodded and dismissed the Old Man. Then turning to Chang’e, he said, “Though you have been exiled to the mortal world, your punishment is self-inflicted. Who permitted you to secretly nurture feelings, to disturb the pure serenity of the moon palace, to disrupt our solemn order? For such conduct, I must punish you first; otherwise, you will surely face harsher penalties under Heaven’s laws. Then you will fall into the Nine Nether Hells. Even if your former master, the Queen Mother, were to show favor, she could not save you. It is better that I deal with you now. If, after descending, you can live as a chaste and virtuous woman, or perform many meritorious deeds, you may atone for your crimes and return to the ranks of immortals. This is a way to mitigate your punishment. If you are wise and understanding, you will grasp this principle. Go down and live well, so that your end will be good and your future bright. Then you will understand my bitter intentions for you. Also, you should visit the Jade Pool to see your former master and explain the cause of these events. If you feel ashamed to speak, I will send someone with you. Once there, your former master will surely know all; you need not explain yourself. Take good care of yourself. Since things have come to this, you cannot stay here long—go quickly and leave the hall.” 

Chang’e obeyed the decree, knelt and kowtowed several times, then with shame and tears left the palace courtyard. Female immortals under the star lord’s command escorted her out with two attendants. Upon reaching the Jade Pool, she paid homage to the Queen Mother. The Queen Mother did not rebuke her but instructed the attendants, “Return and say, ‘Greetings to the princess. Chang’e is to be reincarnated as a mortal; I will handle this matter, so the princess need not trouble herself.’” The attendants bowed and left. The Queen Mother then ordered the clerks to determine the appropriate family for Chang’e’s reincarnation. The clerks reported that the Meng couple were loyal and upright people, suitable to receive a good daughter. The Queen Mother commanded that Chang’e be sent to be reborn in the Meng family. Chang’e thanked them and parted, accompanied by her escorts, slowly making her way toward the Central Plains. 

Along the cloud road, suddenly a pale blue-white cloud appeared, carrying a handsome child who hurried alongside Chang’e. She saw the child’s graceful and beautiful appearance and found him very lovable. Unconsciously, she glanced at him several times. Unexpectedly, the child was very well-behaved; seeing Chang’e’s gaze, he smiled and asked, “Sister, are you the Chang’e maiden of the moon palace?” Chang’e laughed and said, “Child, how do you know my name?” The child joyfully replied, “Sister, don’t think me small—I am many times older than you.” Chang’e laughed and scolded, “Nonsense! You’re just a little child; how could you be older than me?” The child grinned and said, “If I can prove it, sister, you must agree to be my wife. If I cannot, you may scold and beat me, and I will not resist or reply. Deal?” Chang’e blushed and scoffed, thinking he was just a child speaking playfully, with no real reason. Besides, he was truly adorable, and she wanted to tease him back, so she smiled and said, “You shameless little rascal, so young and already wanting a wife! If you can prove it, I won’t be embarrassed.” The child laughed, “Since you say so, that means you agree. Sister, we are both immortals in heaven; words are as binding as mountains. No fibbing allowed.” Chang’e laughed and chided, “Such a slick tongue! Don’t you have parents or teachers to discipline you?” The child stretched out a small arm and twisted Chang’e’s jade arm tightly, refusing to let go, looking up and smiling, “Sister, you say I’m bad but never forbid me to be your husband. That means you definitely agree. Now I will tell you the proof that I am older than you.”

Iron Crutch Master paused here, and all the listeners burst into laughter. Zhongli Quan found it especially amusing, clapping his hands and stomping his feet, saying, “Master, look—immortals even have mischievous children! No wonder you always scold me for being naughty.” Tonghui smiled and said, “This child’s mischief surpasses yours. When you become an immortal, you should go pay respects to him as your mischievous teacher—and maybe even win a fairy as your wife. Mischief has its benefits! From now on, we won’t complain about your naughtiness.” Iron Crutch Master also laughed and said, “That child later became Fan Qiliang. He suffered such great losses for a wife, yet you all praise him!” Then he continued, “At that time, what made Chang’e most suspicious was when the child twisted her arm as if it were caught by something golden and could not be moved. She was startled and said, ‘Child, how do you have such strength? Let go quickly, or you’ll break my arm.’ The child refused, laughing foolishly, ‘Good sister, will you admit I’m right? Nod once, and I’ll let go. If not, I’m sorry—I’ll have to use force.’”

Chang’e laughed with him, unaware of the future troubles. Fearing he might really pull hard and cause her pain, she thought it unwise to resist. After all, nodding once would not cost her anything. So she smiled and nodded, saying, “Child, isn’t that a fair bargain? Now tell me your proof. If you’re wrong, I’ll punish you twice as hard to warn you against future nonsense and lies.” Seeing her nod, the child released her arm. Chang’e’s face flushed deeply with shame; she turned away and hurried on, ignoring him. The child hurried after her, trying to grab her hand again. Chang’e, afraid he might use force, stood firm and scolded, “You’re such a trickster! You should speak plainly, not just seek advantage. This is truly unreasonable!” The child then revealed that he was the younger brother of the Barefoot Immortal, the disheveled immortal. Mischievous by nature, he was not favored by his elder brother, who himself was a rascal. Many Taoist friends feared his antics. Yet the elder brother forbade his younger sibling’s mischief, so the younger did not fully accept his discipline. Hearing this, Chang’e could not help but laugh.

Iron Crutch Master smiled at this point, and the fairies and Zhongli Quan laughed heartily. Iron Crutch Master said, “Chang’e was very clever then. She said, ‘You are greatly mistaken. Your elder brother loves you and hopes you will be especially good. How could he be mischievous himself, yet forbid his brother’s mischief? Perhaps he sees you unwilling to apply yourself. Though you are among the immortals, your foundation is not yet firm; you should work hard and practice diligently. He, on the other hand, has already attained an imperishable body, living as long as Heaven and Earth. His jokes have no real harm. How can you compare yourself to him, blaming him unfairly? If I were your brother, I wouldn’t drive you out, but I would beat you seventeen or eighteen times to make you repent and reform.’”

At these words, the disheveled immortal shook his head, tossing his long hair wildly. The strands lifted and fluttered in the wind, making his appearance all the more amusing. Chang’e laughed and reached out to tidy his hair, but he laughed and said, “Sister, your words are true, but I still don’t quite believe it. Why is it that children are not allowed to laugh mischievously, but grown-ups can tease others at will? I don’t understand this. Later, I went with my brother to the Peach Banquet. I thought the peaches I got were too small and suspected the Queen Mother looked down on me as a child. So I transformed into a worm and sneaked into her garden to steal peaches. But the Queen Mother’s power is great. When she found out, she quickly sent people to catch me. I panicked, jumped down, and accidentally kicked one of her favored attendants, who went back crying. I became even more afraid and tried to escape. My brother, Barefoot Immortal, came with many others to catch me. Seeing him, I grew bold, refused to confess, and even insulted him. That made things worse. I heard the Queen Mother’s decree: ‘Stealing peaches is mere mischief, forgivable. Kicking the attendant was unintentional, also excusable. But insulting your brother is a grave breach of ethics. Among the immortals, such disorder is intolerable.’ She severely reprimanded my brother for poor discipline and sent me down to the mortal world, saying if I did not repent, I would be cast into the animal realm with no hope of release. Sister, you must think about this—how could such things not anger one? Now I must go see my brother and then journey to the mortal realm. Sister, we met by chance on the cloud road, and you have granted me marriage. With such a blessing, going to the mortal world is not such a loss.” 

Chang’e laughed and said, “Nonsense! Marriage is a serious matter, not something to be joked about. You are always mischievous and fond of pranks, which causes you trouble again and again. Having received severe punishment and banished to the mortal world, you should reform your heart and mind. On the journey, whether we know each other or not, speaking so carelessly may bring you more suffering.” The disheveled immortal’s face grew serious as he said loudly, “Hey, hey, hey! Why do you blame my marriage? Didn’t I tell you immortals don’t joke? Especially on such a great matter, there is no room for casual talk. Once spoken, it is a lifelong vow. Even mortals do not lightly break marriage vows; how could immortals do so?” Saying this, he clenched his fists and crossed his arms, ready to argue. Chang’e felt a little afraid but recalled the Old Man Under the Moon’s words: “Marriage was fixed five hundred years ago. Right and wrong are predestined; children’s jokes cannot decide such matters.” So she smiled and answered, “So you say you must have me?” The disheveled immortal replied seriously, “How could it be otherwise? Honestly, I don’t care if you agree or not, or if anyone else competes with me. I will claim you.” 

Just then, they passed a city. The disheveled immortal laughed and pointed at the city, saying, “To speak plainly, even if someone caught me and buried me alive within this city, my restless soul would never let you go.” Chang’e heard this and, though half in jest, felt his sincerity deeply. Seeing his handsome bearing and lively spirit, she had long admired him, though as a child she never thought of marriage. Hearing his story, she recalled tales of the Barefoot Immortal and the disheveled immortal brothers and felt respect for their status. Now, with his earnest proposal, her heart was deeply moved.

While silently turning these feelings over and over, the disheveled immortal firmly took one of her jade hands and gently asked, “Sister, I have spoken so plainly. Do you still doubt my sincerity? Honestly, after you descend to the mortal world as a woman, who does not marry? Since you must marry, why not bind this fateful coincidence with me?” Chang’e blushed and said, “To be frank, I was once a servant in the moon, among the immortals, carefree and free. But out of one moment of compassion, I longed for my violent former husband and thus violated Heaven’s laws. I was rightly sent to the Underworld, but the star lord’s great favor reduced my sentence to exile in the mortal world. This is my present plight. Now, having met you on the cloud road and heard your words, you have taken it upon yourself to arrange my life. Though marriage was recorded clearly in the Old Man’s book five hundred years ago, I do not know who my husband is. If it is you, that would be wonderful. But if it is another, would that not bring further complications and calamities? My previous sins are not yet expiated, and new ones are already sown. You must help me consider what to do.” 

The disheveled immortal laughed heartily, “You have long been among the immortals and still do not understand the two characters for ‘marriage’—yuan (fate). To know fate is to know that those with fate are connected by a red thread even across a thousand miles. Those without fate face many obstacles even when face to face. Now, by chance, we met on the cloud road and found our words in harmony. What else could this be but past fate? Since we have past fate, it is marriage. To me, this marriage is truly a match made by Heaven and Earth. Otherwise, why would you and I, one in the far East and one in the far West, be exiled at the same time and meet halfway? Tell me, is there such coincidence in mortal marriages? Good sister, if you refuse me again, I dare say when you go to the mortal world, you will not lack fellow exiled immortals. But to lightly pass up such a good match would be a sin as grave as your previous violation of Heaven’s laws.” 

Chang’e spat and laughed, “Smooth talker! If it is a good match, how could I pass it up? You are speaking nonsense. Very well, since you are so sincere, I will agree.” The disheveled immortal rejoiced and asked, “Sister, can I trust your word? Will you not change your mind?” Chang’e smiled, “Having promised, how could I change my heart?” 

As they spoke, they passed a great river, with mountains on the left bank. Chang’e pointed to the mountains and river and said, “Since you love me so, no matter what, I will marry you. Even if someone throws me from the mountain into the water, I will never break my vow!” The two made this pact, then parted ways to be reborn.

By all rights, their marriage was indeed a fateful coincidence. But both bore guilt and were exiled; these heavenly laws could not be avoided. Having already suffered punishment, their karmic debts were partly paid. If the couple were truly harmonious, growing old together in mutual respect, they would not be here to suffer but to enjoy the mortal world’s blessings. Thus, though Fan and Meng’s marriage was accomplished, it was but a name to behold, never truly attainable.

Iron Crutch Master finished recounting this tragic tale of Fan and Meng. Tonghui then asked, “If their marriage was but a fleeting illusion, why must they still endure such cruel punishments?” Iron Crutch Master sighed, “There is no need to say more. In short, it was because they failed to examine themselves that they blundered into trouble and soon forgot their suffering. Meeting halfway, they did not speak seriously but hastily arranged marriage. This was a great offense provoking Heaven’s wrath. The Dao is most subtle, applying to them the very punishments they willingly bore, perfectly fulfilling their oath. It is a method both clever and just.” All who heard this were filled with awe.

Then He Xiangu asked, “Qin Shi Huang was so cruel; why has he not yet received retribution?” Iron Crutch Master laughed heartily, “Though only a few days have passed in the mountains, many years have elapsed in the world. You dwell hidden in your grotto; how could you know the great upheavals of the mortal realm? Now Ying Zheng has been brought before the Underworld’s tribunal and is being interrogated. His son Hu Hai has succeeded him as the Second Emperor. My prophecy that ‘the destroyer of Qin is Hu’ will soon come true.” Hearing this, all were suddenly enlightened, saying, “So the destroyer of Qin refers to Hu Hai. Even we could not guess this; how could Qin Shi Huang himself have foreseen it in his son?” Iron Crutch Master smiled at He Xiangu and asked, “Do you know how Qin Shi Huang died?” The assembly was stunned and said, “We were just about to ask.” Before Iron Crutch Master could answer, a sudden gust of wind howled outside the stone chamber, then fell silent. Iron Crutch Master laughed, “Fly out and see—Brother Yang has arrived.”

Who the visitor might be, we shall see in the next chapter.
