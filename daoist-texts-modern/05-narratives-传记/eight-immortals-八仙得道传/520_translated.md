# Chapter Fifty-Two: On Electric Power as Ten Thousand Directions Like One Face — Transmitting the Profound Scripture, Each Disciple with Their Unique Fate

Now it happened that within the Purple Mist Cavern atop Mount Taihua, the assembly of immortals were engaged in discourse concerning the manner of the death of Emperor Qin Shi Huang. Suddenly, Fei Fei flew swiftly inside, reporting, “Senior Brother Yang of Mount Tai has arrived.” Master Iron Crutch chuckled, “I reckoned he should be here by now. Have him come in.” Fei Fei hurried out and soon returned, bringing Yang Ren with him. Yang Ren bowed eight times before Master Iron Crutch, who then bade him greet all the senior brothers and uncles, and took his seat at the head beside Fei Fei.

Master Iron Crutch smiled at Fairy He and said, “You urged me earlier to hasten to save Master Liu of the Pure Emptiness Temple, but later you ceased to speak of it. Why so?” Fairy He laughed and replied, “At first, I was truly anxious on his behalf. But then I saw how carefully you handled matters, sparing no one who ought to be saved, and leaving no task undone. Since Master Liu had been repeatedly warned by me but stubbornly ignored it, I thought surely your actions could not be in error. I concluded this man must have chosen the path of death himself, beyond rescue, and so could not accept your grace. My own learning is limited, and my功 (practice) negligible; in all matters I must follow your lead, so as to avoid mistakes. If you do not wish to save those beyond saving, how dare I meddle? If I dare not meddle, why then speak further to you?”

Hearing this, Master Iron Crutch laughed heartily, then pointed at Yang Ren and said, “Look well, this is indeed Master Liu, the one Zhao Gao captured. I took advantage of Emperor Qin’s summons for alchemists to send him to the capital as a recruit. He was assigned within the Pure Emptiness Temple as a法师 (ritual master). His task was to assassinate the emperor swiftly once Qin’s wickedness reached its peak. For nearly a hundred years, the people have suffered daily under war and conscription, under cruel levies. Everyone hoped that after unification, with a true sovereign on the throne, even if the glories of Wen, Wu, Cheng, and Kang could not be restored, the endless wars and suffering of the Spring and Autumn and Warring States periods would at least cease. Yet since Qin’s accession, he has arrogantly claimed Heaven’s mandate, ruling with cruelty and violence, trampling on the lives of the people even more than during the Seven Kingdoms. This is all fate’s decree, not the fault of the emperor alone. Even he himself is but a demon lord born to fulfill this calamity. Such men have already broken Heaven’s laws and been cast down to the mortal realm. Their punishment in the dust of the world replaces the heavenly penalty. Both ruler and subjects are bound by fate, unable to act on their own will. Yet emperors are called Sons of Heaven, parents of the people. If a parent governs wisely, they may still invoke Heaven’s favor. If they bear the remorse of Cheng Tang’s seven failings and the guilt of King Wu upon their shoulders, they may yet reverse fortune, turning great calamity into auspiciousness. This is the emperor’s responsibility. Knowing the ruin is inevitable, why then worsen it by harming the people? For the common folk, what use is such an emperor? Now the garrison soldiers at the Great Wall have chosen their leader, raising axes and banners in revolt. The true sovereign has already been born. There is no place for the likes of Ying Zheng to linger in the world. Because he lacks仁德 (benevolent virtue) yet terrifies the universe with his might, every day he remains on the throne is another day of frustration for the righteous armies. Would it not be better to end him swiftly and take advantage of the moment? This matter concerns the survival and peace of the entire realm; the heavenly secret cannot be revealed lightly. That is why you asked repeatedly but I did not answer—this is the reason.” All present listened with astonishment and sighed deeply.

As they spoke, suddenly there was a tremendous roar in midair. The mountain trees rustled wildly, birds on the branches cried out in alarm and scattered in flight. Master Iron Crutch smiled at Zhang Guo and said, “Your master has sent an old friend to deliver a message. Go out and see.” Zhang Guo, puzzled, stepped outside the cavern. At the entrance, a great maple tree had snapped a branch, from which hung a letter, slanting on the limb. Hastily, Zhang Guo took it down and saw it was a decree from Master Wenmei.

Zhang Guo bowed his head, holding the letter reverently as he returned inside to present it to Master Iron Crutch, smiling as he asked, “Is this not the sword light method?” Master Iron Crutch handed the letter back and told him to open it himself, replying, “Sword light can send letters tens of thousands of li away in no time at all. If one can borrow the power of lightning, even to the farthest east or west, communication can be instant. One can write the words on one side, and in the blink of an eye, they appear on the other. Far more convenient than sword light for sending letters.”

All were amazed at this. Zhang Guo read the letter aloud. It told how Master Wenmei, seeing Zhang Guo’s功行 (spiritual achievement) was too shallow, instructed him to go into seclusion at Mount Wudang. Passing through Mangdang Mountain, he encountered a man traveling drunk who was blocked by a great white serpent. This man was the true sovereign to come. The white serpent was none other than the spirit of the deceased Qin Emperor Ying Zheng, whose resentment had not dissipated. Knowing this man would replace him, it had attached itself to the serpent’s body, intending to kill him in the narrow pass. Zhang Guo was to hide in the mountain; when he saw a pair of great lights appear at the foot of the mountain, that was the white serpent emerging. He was to quickly assist the true lord in slaying it. This was a great功行 not to be neglected. With these words, Master Iron Crutch ordered Zhang Guo to set out at once. Afterward, he also sent Yang Ren back to Mount Tai.

Then he laughed and said to Zhongli Quan, “I think I shall travel the world with Sister He, and on the way, convert the future incarnations of Fan Qiliang and his wife. Ah Quan, you should receive my Profound Scripture. You may study it well here with Fei Fei and Dian Dian. Twenty years hence, your master will surely test your功课 (practice). If you show no progress, not only will your master abandon you like a discarded thing, but I too will dare no longer instruct you.”

Zhongli Quan bowed again and promised. Master Iron Crutch then gave him three volumes of the Profound Scripture, charging him to guard them carefully. Should they be lost, the penalty would be thunder’s strike. Zhongli Quan kowtowed and accepted. Fei Fei, Dian Dian, and Fei Changfang stood aside, and seeing Master Iron Crutch entrust the scripture solely to Zhongli Quan, their faces showed displeasure. Master Iron Crutch laughed heartily and ordered Zhongli Quan to take out the scripture and place it on the stone table in the center. Then he commanded the four to bow together. Afterward, he casually opened a page and told Fei Changfang to look first. The page was blank, not a single word. Turning several pages, all were the same. Fei Fei and Dian Dian also came forward and turned the pages one by one, all blank. Master Iron Crutch asked if they saw anything. The three could only answer truthfully. Then he ordered Zhongli Quan to read aloud. Zhongli Quan saw clear, upright characters and recited them loudly.

Master Iron Crutch sighed, “Immortal fate is fixed; accomplishment varies. I do not show favoritism; it is simply that your法缘 (spiritual affinity) differ. Otherwise, why can Ah Quan read clearly this Profound Scripture, while the three of you see not a single word?” At this, the three had no reply, though a trace of discontent showed on their faces.

Master Iron Crutch said, “Though you lack Ah Quan’s affinity, you are not barred from learning entirely. Yet the highest and deepest teachings cannot be grasped until you have labored in苦修 (arduous cultivation) and冥炼 (profound refining), truly able to reverse destiny. Even then, I and Ah Quan must instruct you directly. To read this scripture straightaway is utterly impossible. This is the so-called fate predetermined, things having their masters—no forcing it at all. When I first read this scripture, you all saw it yourself: I read ten lines at a glance, with great ease. Now, in功 (practice), Ah Quan may not be faster than me, but certainly not slower. After he finishes reading, we will select what can be taught. Besides what I have already taught you, there remain some dozens of methods, effortless for us. For you, even with daily toil, it will take at least twenty or thirty years to grasp a hint. Ordinary people may study thirty years without learning even the shallowest mysteries. Compared to you, that is incomparable. When I practiced before, I was abducted by demons, and later took you two with me to retrieve the scripture. You should remember. In truth, what use is the scripture once obtained? It is but a blank page. Yet then I did not know this, fearing the demons might steal some secret methods. Even if the book was recovered, the harm was great. Hence my urgency. Looking back, it seems laughable. Now in these mountains, most demons and ghosts have been expelled by me or slain by Fei Fei and others, nearly all cleared away. But you must not be overconfident; better to be cautious. This scripture is the secret treasure of the Eight Scenic Palaces. When I finished reading it, I submitted it to the Patriarch. The Patriarch decreed Zhongli Quan worthy to inherit it. Therefore, he entrusted it to me for safekeeping, saying: ‘If a great immortal fate and deep wisdom appear, able to read this scripture, then it may be passed on.’ Now Zhongli Quan has come. Though not my disciple, he is my fellow disciple, even above master and student in relation. He truly can read it, proving he is the one the Patriarch spoke of. Passing it to him fulfills the Patriarch’s command, cultivates his immortal talent, and frees me of a heavy burden. Three gains at once—nothing could be more fitting. For Ah Quan, receiving this rare scripture is a great blessing. Yet he must bear this heavy burden and not neglect it. Moreover, the scripture can only be fully read within three to five years. After decades of practice and功行德业 (cultivation of功 and virtue), such swift progress will make him a Great Daoist Immortal within a millennium. His skill will be rare even among heavenly immortals.” Zhongli Quan listened joyfully and bowed to the empty air, thanking the Patriarch.

Fei Fei, Dian Dian, and Changfang also kowtowed. Since Master Iron Crutch and Zhongli Quan agreed to pass on what could be taught, it was proper to observe this rite. Only Fei Changfang, having finished bowing, saw Master Iron Crutch smile at him. Changfang was puzzled and asked, “Master, why do you smile upon me? Have I been disrespectful or done wrong?” Master Iron Crutch laughed, “Though you are my disciple, your foundation is shallow. Your immortal fate is less than Fei Fei’s and the others’. You have been away from home long; it is time you return to see your family.”

Changfang was startled, “Master, why speak so today? If I lack immortal fate, how could I have met you? If my dao heart were weak, you would not have kept me by your side. I have not done wrong these days. Why suddenly send me away?”

Master Iron Crutch smiled, “Sending you back is not casting you out. Your status as junior brother is fixed; if you cannot become an immortal, that status remains. I only mean your future achievement is thin; at best, you may become an earth-immortal, and even that requires tenfold effort. When you left home, your family was sorrowful and anxious. You should return to comfort them—that is proper.”

Changfang wept, “Master, you were only teasing me, giving me false hope. When I left, by your power, my family believed I had died. Though I have been in the mountains only a few days, my family may have aged or changed beyond recognition. Returning may be meaningless. Nonetheless, I beg you to keep me by your side. If fate grants me earth-immortal status, I will accept it gladly, with no complaint, not to trouble you.” Master Iron Crutch smiled and nodded.

That night, the three disciples parted from Fei Fei and others and left Mount Hua, taking the route through Xianyang, preparing to journey south to find the couple Lan Caihe. Meanwhile, the capital was ravaged by Xiang Yu’s troops, burning and slaughtering, turning many residential areas into rubble. Emperor Qin Shi Huang’s painstakingly built palaces, corridors, and gardens, bought with the blood and sweat of the people, were now mostly scorched earth.

Master Iron Crutch and company traveled leisurely, sighing and reminiscing about past events. Only Changfang was silent, quietly pondering his own home—wondering if it had been burned. His family, where had they gone? The thought grieved him deeply, tears streaming down. Fearing Master Iron Crutch might notice, he kept his expression calm. Seeing this, Master Iron Crutch turned to Fairy He and chatted casually, and only then did Changfang’s heavy heart settle.

Suddenly, Master Iron Crutch raised his hand and pointed, “Changfang, is that not the old Pure Emptiness Temple? Could it be that the residence you passed through was untouched? Perhaps Yang Ren managed to preserve it. Since we are here, let us go inside and see. If we can settle, it would not be improper to stay there a while.” Fairy He and Changfang agreed.

Entering the temple, they found the buildings intact but no one in sight. Even the utensils and implements were missing. Master Iron Crutch sighed, “Seas turn to mulberry fields, changes are many. This place was once bustling and prosperous. How quickly it has become desolate. Life in this world, the flesh and bones of men, perish far faster than wood, stone, or fields. The more attached to fame and profit, the swifter the death. It is truly dreadful and lamentable!”

He glanced briefly at Changfang, who smiled and said, “Master, do you suspect I still harbor desires for fame and profit?” Master Iron Crutch laughed, “Not just you alone. Now you understand, that is enough.” He continued, “Your home is close by. Since we have come, it is proper to visit. Cultivation is not apart from human feelings; the immortal path values情 (affection) above all. To cling to worldly feelings is wrong; but to be indifferent to one’s closest kin, as if unrelated, is also not the way of the cultivator.”

Changfang replied, “Since traveling with you, I have grown ever more detached from worldly affairs. Yet even between family and children, I have not fully let go. I blame my shallow understanding and scant learning, for loving family against the dao heart, thus opposing the path. I keep these feelings hidden, never speaking of them before you. Sometimes I use forceful methods to cast them aside. Now hearing your clear teaching, I see that feelings within reason are like ordinary people’s, no need to force falsehood and lose one’s true nature. Master, is this so?”

Master Iron Crutch shook his head, “Your words are partly right and partly wrong. Not forgetting kin, not abandoning propriety, that is human reason. Why did the Patriarch ascend by uprooting his home? Why did I, after attaining the Dao, follow the Patriarch’s decree to save my parents? All because of情 (affection). Thus, affection cannot be broken by mortals or immortals. But immortals’ affection must first arise from无情 (detachment), so that true情 may later manifest. If one were like ordinary people, clinging day and night, husband and wife, parents and children always together, where would be time or heart for cultivation? You said since leaving home you often think of your family; such thoughts mean you long to be with them always, never apart. But forcing oneself not to be lost in this is a stage all beginners must pass. To say cultivators should not have such thoughts, or that without this one is not a cultivator, is a grave error. When cultivation is complete, the dao heart pure, no worldly or demonic forces can harm you. You may act as you wish, entering and leaving as you please, all in accord with measure. Confucius’ ‘following the heart’s desire without overstepping bounds’ is the same principle. But now, though your dao heart is firm, your dao body is not yet solid, your dao power very weak. You think yourself assured, but cannot withstand external demons’ temptations. Once caught, all功 is lost. You must always be vigilant, constantly mindful, expanding your so-called forced effort. When all thoughts and matters return to one, to pure精 (essence), no need to watch or consider, then there are no thoughts at all. Only then can one comprehend the Great Dao—the first step of the Great Dao’s gateway功夫. At your present stage, you are at the crossroads, able to advance or retreat, enter or exit. Though you cannot fully cut off worldly thoughts or block mundane worries, you must not keep such thoughts as ordinary people do. Better to move from forced effort to naturalness, reaching the point of unmoved heart; even if distractions arise, treat them as passing clouds, not binding you. Over time, you will reach the state of one and pure精. I send you home to see your family not to abandon worldly worries or lose mundane thoughts, but to focus your heart, not be tempted by things. With my stillness responding to their movement, my emptiness meeting their substance, do not forget propriety. This is the way of pure harmony. Your words seem similar but differ subtly—this you must clearly understand.”

Changfang accepted the teaching, ashamed and moved, feeling his heart brightened. That night, after bidding Master Iron Crutch farewell, he went to seek his family. Outside the temple, he asked and learned his village had not been ravaged by war, which comforted him. He hastened on. At the village entrance, he suddenly saw a woman being dragged and pulled by several ruffians, uttering many filthy words. The woman cried out for help, saying, “Even if my family has broken the law, I must go to the authorities to plead. I cannot suffer your abuse.” Changfang recognized the voice as his wife’s. Looking closely, it was indeed Bai Shi, his wife. One rogue twisted her face and laughed, “Your husband fled long ago, and your family has committed a great crime. If you cooperate, come with us—we’ll provide food and clothing, and you’ll never suffer loss.” Bai Shi cursed loudly. The ruffians grew angry, “We’ll take her now, enjoy the night, and send her to the magistrate tomorrow.” With a raucous shout, they seized Bai Shi and fled like the wind. Changfang’s blood boiled, his three尸神 (three corpses spirits) leapt, his seven orifices smoked. Without hesitation, he gave chase.

Whether he could catch them or not, the story will be told in the next chapter.
