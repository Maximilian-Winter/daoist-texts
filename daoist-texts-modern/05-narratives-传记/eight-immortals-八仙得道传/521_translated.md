# Chapter Fifty-Three: Fei Changfang’s Wrath Unleashed, The Erlang God Descends to Warn the Fierce and Lawless

Now it came to pass that Fei Changfang, seeing with his own eyes how his wife was so cruelly humiliated by a band of scoundrels, felt a fire blaze fiercely within his chest, scorching his very core; the Three Corpses within him leapt and raged. He beheld those ruffians dragging Lady Bai away, her hair disheveled and loose, her bare feet treading the ground, her garments torn to tatters beyond recognition. From her lips escaped only desperate cries: “Help! Bandits are abducting me! Someone save me, I beg you!” Her voice was sharp and pitiful, unbearable to hear.

Fei Changfang could endure no longer. Seeing Lady Bai dragged some hundred paces away, he unleashed his art of swift earth contraction: with a single thrust of his feet, he closed the distance and confronted them. The crowd, witnessing a man suddenly appear from thin air, marveled and whispered among themselves, suspicious and wary. Fei Changfang spoke no more than to first ask his wife, “Do you still recognize this humble man?” Lady Bai, beholding Fei Changfang’s appearance, found him looking younger than before, more vigorous. She clearly recognized her husband, yet a veil of doubt clouded her heart. Years had passed since they parted; she had searched everywhere, hearing rumors he had died in a distant land. Now, to see him suddenly appear, as if by chance, seemed a miracle beyond belief. Or perhaps he was a ghost returned from the netherworld, knowing her plight and manifesting to save her. She had not seen him lurking anywhere before, and suddenly he stood before her. This last thought seemed the most plausible. After all, it was her own husband, the one she had shared bed and pillow with; though she knew it might be a spirit, she feared nothing. Clutching Fei Changfang’s robe, she wailed to Heaven and Earth, “You are long dead—how is it you come here now? Could it be that you know your wife is in peril, and have come as a numinous spirit to save me?”

Fei Changfang replied only, “Speak not nonsense—how can you prove I am a ghost?”

Before he finished, the gang surged forward, shouting, “Are you man, ghost, or demon? Even if you are a ghost, your wife has broken the law, and we are preparing to deliver her to the authorities. You dwell in the nether realms, disconnected from our world. We advise you to meddle no further. If not, we will seize you first and send you to the City God’s temple, to face charges of falsely claiming another’s wife. Let us see if you can become a peaceful ghost then!”

Fei Changfang, already furious as thunder, grew even more enraged at these words. Drawing his sword, he roared at the speaker, “Wretched villains! In broad daylight you abduct a married woman, and now you dare call the living dead spirits? I will show you what a ghost’s hand can do!” With a swing of his blade, the man’s head lightly rolled to the ground. The ruffians cried out, “Where did this wild Daoist come from? He’s killed a man!” and rushed to seize Fei Changfang. Pushing Lady Bai aside, Fei Changfang again employed earth contraction, leaping half a li away, then turned to fight the crowd.

These scoundrels, used only to bullying in numbers and preying on villagers, knew nothing of swordplay. Moreover, they were unarmed, facing Fei Changfang’s blade with bare hands. Enraged beyond measure, Fei Changfang swung wildly, and in moments, six or seven lay dead. The remaining five, wounded, fled. Laughing, Fei Changfang called after them, “You curs! Had I known you would not fight, I would never have bothered with your wicked deeds.” He gave chase and shouted, “Stop!” The five sets of feet were as if nailed to the ground, unable to move. Fei Changfang laughed, “You worthless rascals, sparing your lives only brings harm to the land. Better that I expend more effort and send you all to the netherworld, so you may meet the City God sooner. Then he can dispatch someone to arrest me for my crime.” Raising his sword, he struck down two more in swift succession.

Though their feet were fixed, their minds remained clear and their voices able to plead aloud: “Great Immortal, spare our lives! We will never dare do evil again!” Fei Changfang laughed, “You say you won’t do evil—who would believe empty words like that?” And with that, he slew another, leaving only two alive. These two wept bitterly, “Great Immortal, be merciful and compassionate, for salvation is your foundation. Our crimes, at worst, are robbery of common women—not worthy of death. You have already slain many of our brothers; only we two remain. Though your thunderous wrath is great, surely you can show mercy and let us live a few more days?” Their tears flowed like rivers.

Hearing this, Fei Changfang suddenly recalled the teachings of Master Tieguai and felt their words were just. He realized he had gone too far, killing so many in a moment of rage. It seemed he had abused his power, oppressing the common folk. Moreover, to wield a treasured sword against bare hands was neither martial nor kind. Repentance filled his heart; he cast down his sword with a curse and said, “Years of cultivation undone by a moment of violence. I do not understand what grudge I bear against you to bring such ruin upon myself!”

He spoke thus, and seeing the two still weeping and begging, he hung his head in dejection and said, “I will spare your lives. But you must mend your ways and never again bring harm to the village. Even if I do not kill you, the law of the land and the Dao of Heaven cannot be evaded. Go now, go.”

The two bowed deeply and fled like frightened mice. Fei Changfang, having killed so many in his fury, was seized by remorse. He sat stunned for a long while, then picked up his sword, spiritless, and went forward to find his wife.

Suddenly, a voice called from behind, “Murderer, where do you think you’re going?” Startled, Fei Changfang turned to see a Daoist clad in white robes, riding a white elephant, galloping swiftly as the wind. Knowing escape was impossible, and despairing, Fei Changfang summoned all his courage, resolved to face death. He stopped and waited for the Daoist to approach, then raised his hands in salute and asked, “Fellow Daoist, whence do you come? May I inquire your honored dharma name?”

The Daoist sneered, “You wild man, do you even know manners? We monks base ourselves on compassion. Your deeds—revenge beyond measure, breaking the law, defying Heaven’s decrees—are all improper. You rely on petty magic to bully the unarmed and ignorant commoners. Such shameful acts disgrace our Daoist tradition. Magic should be used to save and aid the world, not to kill. Unless the victim is a great criminal, and the law has not yet taken its course, and the person is a danger to the land, killing is not justified. Even then, it should be rare and measured. You have slain ten—how cruel! Such wanton killing wounds the harmony of Heaven. If common men did this, they would be executed without mercy. If Dao cultivators act thus, their punishment must be doubled. By your example, anyone versed in magic could slaughter all the people. If this continues, Daoism itself will perish.”

Fei Changfang, filled with shame and remorse, dared not reply. The Daoist continued, “As for your case, seeing your wife insulted, your anger is understandable. And you say these men were no good, so killing them might rid the land of harm. That sounds reasonable. But when people break the law, it is for the officials to handle. We outsiders interfering is overstepping and unlawful. Your idea implies all Dao cultivators have the right to meddle in politics. If so, why entrust political power to officials and emperors at all? Even if we must involve ourselves, it should be to do more good. Acts of murder and arson are not our role. You killed many and claim to be ridding the land of harm—this is shameless boasting without reason. Moreover, among evildoers, there is always a leader, and many are forced or misled, not wholly wicked. Officials do not execute all thieves at once but interrogate carefully, because not all are beyond redemption. Among the wicked, there are ranks and degrees. If possible, some are spared and given a chance to reform. You, however, made no distinctions, killing all indiscriminately. You and your master constantly say Emperor Qin was cruel and ruthless, even sending assassins to end him. Yet your deeds are crueler still. I must ask your master if he bears some responsibility for such a disciple.”

Fei Changfang, hearing the Daoist’s sharp and accurate words, and knowing he was surely a celestial immortal of great standing, felt powerless to resist. Bearing heavy guilt and fearing to implicate his master, he could not calm his heart. He did not even consider where his wife was or what great trouble had befallen his household. Falling to the ground, he kowtowed and confessed, “All my sins come from my rashness and roughness, from acting recklessly and causing this great calamity. My master once said I was unworthy of the Dao and intended to expel me. After many pleas, he allowed me to remain. Yet my foolishness and lowly nature caused this disaster just steps from his side. This has nothing to do with him. I beg you, Great Immortal, to enforce the law on my master’s behalf; I willingly accept whatever punishment—be it blade, saw, axe, or halberd.”

He kowtowed without cease. The Daoist sighed and gave orders. Fei Changfang rose and stood humbly aside, head bowed to receive commands. The Daoist said, “I am the Erlang God, nephew of the Jade Emperor, sent by imperial decree. Soon the struggle between Chu and Han will decide the rightful Son of Heaven. I am to patrol the world, inspect the people, and where there is suffering or injustice, to aid those who can be helped, and where aid is impossible, to mitigate pain and prevent calamity from spreading. Just now, descending to the mortal realm, I witnessed your deeds. You should have been handed to your master and then sent to the netherworld, cast into the Nine Hells. But out of respect for your master’s virtue, I spared his face. Seeing your repentance and that your actions were unintentional, I will take you to be judged but grant leniency. Go quickly and return your wife home. She is a virtuous woman, respected by immortals and spirits alike. Care for her well and do not let her suffer further. In time, others will come to assist her. When this is done, return here in three days to see me.”

Fei Changfang wept and bowed deeply, then with earth contraction hastened to where his wife was held. The place was sparsely populated, so he found her easily. The couple briefly exchanged words, and Fei Changfang did not reveal the troubles he had caused. Together they returned home, and he inquired into the cause of the disturbance.

It was revealed that Fei Changfang, having become a monk years before and left no children, had his brother’s son inherit the family line. This nephew was the very man who had opened the door to Lady He Xian Gu the previous year. As a child, he was decent enough, but as he grew, he declined year by year, delighting in consorting with bandits and engaging in lawless deeds. Soon, he squandered all the family wealth, causing his elderly parents such grief that they fell ill and passed on one after another.

Lady Bai, though no longer young, retained some grace and charm. When Fei Changfang was at home, their conjugal love was strong. After he left to cultivate the Dao, many relatives urged her to remarry while still young, to avoid the bitterness of loneliness. But Lady Bai vowed to remain chaste, steadfast and unyielding, earning the respect of the local people.

Unexpectedly, the nephew, after selling off the family property, was persuaded by some to think thus: though his stepmother was old, she was more comely than many young girls. Since he lived in poverty, why not trick her out and sell her for money? At first he hesitated, but desperate, he gambled all he had in a last-ditch effort to turn his fortunes. He planned to win and then reform. But Heaven did not believe his resolve, nor did it favor his luck. He lost everything and fell deeply into debt, with creditors demanding repayment.

Now he had no qualms about targeting his stepmother. Though Xianyang had suffered war and fire, it was once a capital city, bustling and lively, with many pleasure quarters catering to nobles and wealthy youths. Lady Bai’s beauty was well known, and the nephew thought if he could sell her to a brothel, he might fetch a high price. Within two days, a house agreed to pay three hundred taels of silver for her as a courtesan. Fearing she might refuse, they sent many ruffians to her home to create a disturbance, claiming the nephew had committed a great crime and been arrested, and that they would take his mother to the magistrate.

Lady Bai, innocent and naïve, was deceived and forced out. Once outside, the ruffians used vile tricks, thinking to enjoy themselves with a famed beauty who was rarely seen. They never expected Fei Changfang to return home at that moment, leading to this great uproar. The ruffians’ heads fell before their plans could unfold, a most unprofitable outcome.

Fei Changfang, in his anger, had wrought great disaster. Not only was his Dao cultivation now hopeless, but he faced punishment of unknown severity, and feared what fate awaited. He could not yet devise a way to secure Lady Bai’s safety. The unworthy nephew, hearing of his uncle’s return, dared not show his face, hiding here and there. Fei Changfang felt deep guilt toward her and helplessness. Meanwhile, news came that the local constable reported a massacre of ten people, and officials had dispatched agents to investigate and capture the culprit.

Fei Changfang thought no one had seen him kill, as the place was remote and seldom traveled, and the event was brief. Yet he feared his nephew’s wickedness might bring trouble, and if the nephew accused him, there would be no escape from the law. Though Fei Changfang could flee, his concern was for Lady Bai.

Two days later, determined, Fei Changfang resolved to seek his master, confessing all he had done and the punishment decreed by the Erlang God, and to ask for guidance.

As he prepared to leave, he suddenly heard voices from above. Hastening to the corridor and looking up, he saw a one-legged Daoist descending from the sky—it was none other than his master, Master Tieguai. Overcome with gratitude, shame, and fear, Fei Changfang prostrated himself and said, “Master above, your disciple has become a criminal in the Daoist world. I dare not face you, only beg your severe punishment to cleanse my sins.”

Master Tieguai, seeing his state, felt sorrow. Lady Bai, working inside, heard her husband’s voice and peeked through the door crack. Seeing him kneeling beside the one-legged Daoist, she knew her master had arrived. She dropped her needlework and hurried out, kneeling beside her husband and introducing herself as disciple’s wife Bai, paying respects and wishing the master immortal longevity.

Master Tieguai, seated above, let Fei Changfang kneel without reply. Seeing Lady Bai kneel, he rose and cupped his hands, saying, “Madam, a virtuous woman of steadfast chastity is worthy of admiration, but such great ceremony is unnecessary. Please rise.”

Lady Bai saw her husband still kneeling and knew it must be due to the many murders. She too did not rise. Master Tieguai waved his hand gently, “All rise and speak.”

The couple stood aside respectfully to hear his words. Master Tieguai sighed, “This is all predestined fate. Though you can endure all, you cannot bear insult, and thus your path to Dao is far, far away. Erlang is a god of upright and fiery nature, yet most chivalrous. I have just met with him regarding your case. Out of pity for your unintentional deeds, and for your wife’s virtue, he has appointed you an official in charge of fierce spirits. Though alive, your office is in the netherworld. In these times of chaos, countless ghosts wander without shelter, many weak and oppressed by the strong. As a solitary soul, already pitiable, how can you bear further abuse? If you find such cases, you must fairly and justly protect them. Also, ghosts who harm the living and trouble the good people must be driven away. In short, all wandering souls not yet judged by the underworld’s laws fall under your jurisdiction. If you govern with justice and fairness, so that no unjust ghosts trouble the world and no evil spirits harm the people, this will be your greatest merit and atone for today’s sins. But if you abuse your power, using Dao methods to bully ghosts and humans alike, you will be punished doubly. You will not escape the thunderfire’s wrath nor the Erlang God’s sword.”

Fei Changfang wept and vowed to obey without error.

Whether Master Tieguai could truly trust him remains to be seen; the story continues in the next chapter.
