# Chapter Fifty-Four: Fei Changfang Entrusted to Govern Ghosts; Xuan Zhuzi Commissioned to Guard Against the Flood Dragon

Now it happened that Fei Changfang was given command over the ghostly legions. He swore solemnly never to err again, vowing to devote himself wholeheartedly to the task, hoping thereby to build merit and atone for his past sins. Master Iron Crutch, upon hearing this, smiled faintly and nodded, saying, “That is the way! That is the way!” From his sleeve he produced a scroll of talismans and incantations to subdue ghosts, handing it to Fei Changfang. “This,” he said, “is the simplest among the three volumes of the Mysterious Scripture. Though simple, it is not for everyone to learn, nor can it be practiced carelessly. You, being exceptionally clever, will find it not too difficult to master. But do not lightly pass it on to others, lest you bring down Heaven’s wrath. At the end of the scroll is a treatise on weapons for controlling ghosts and monsters. You should forge a peachwood sword according to the method described, to serve as your weapon for slaying evil ghosts and intimidating stubborn fiends.” Fei Changfang bowed again and accepted the charge.

Master Iron Crutch continued, “I have long known you lack the fate of immortality. Yet, since you have pleaded repeatedly, I earnestly hope to turn your destiny around, to help you succeed. But human effort cannot overcome Heaven’s will; the outcome remains as it is. Now, I arrange this post for you so that you may seize this chance to transform your sins into merit. When your sins are exhausted and your merit abundant, this too is a way to restore your vital energy. Moreover, since you have slain ten people, many with grievances, their restless spirits have not dispersed. Your dao power is too weak to subdue them. If they unite to seek revenge, you will be unable to resist. But with this authority, they all fall under your governance and can no longer act on their vengeful thoughts. Yet the work of immortals and spirits must be just; how can you rely on power to oppress others? You must also devote the heart of a husband and wife to help these ghosts transcend, so they may receive some benefit from you. This is most important.” Both bowed their heads and obeyed.

Master Iron Crutch added, “Changfang, this is your last chance to establish merit. Though you swear daily, I still fear that over time your resolve may waver, and a single lapse could bring great disaster. I hope you will always be vigilant and never forget these words.” Pausing briefly, he said, “By my reckoning, if your dao heart remains pure and unwavering, even if you do not succeed in this life, there is hope in the next. Few achieve much within a few hundred years; but after a thousand years, you will surely be reborn in the Heavenly Mansion and take your place among the Golden Immortals. Mortal cultivators often accumulate merit for ten thousand years without glimpsing the profound mysteries. Some cultivate the human body through external substances, others seek immortality within the human form, enduring countless years. Among your generation, Zhang Guo is such a person. If you, under such circumstances, can succeed after a thousand years, though not swiftly, it cannot be called difficult. It seems Heaven favors you, though I regret my dao power is shallow and my knowledge limited to this. As for the exact details, only the Primordial Lord and the Queen Mother of the Western Pond can truly know. We fall short in this regard. Yet though the particulars are unknown, the broad outline is certain. Unless you change your heart midway or commit great evil, forfeiting your position and bringing disaster upon yourself, you must not err. You may rest assured and strive forward. There is no need for resentment or sorrow, nor for despair or discouragement.”

Fei Changfang kowtowed, saying, “Your disciple is resolved to follow the venerable master’s golden instructions. As for the time to succeed, not to speak of a thousand years or more, even if it takes twenty thousand years like Senior Brother Zhang, I shall not grow weary or lose heart. I will persevere unyieldingly, never ceasing until complete accomplishment. I also beg the master’s great kindness to continually instruct and admonish me. All my days are granted by the master’s grace.” Master Iron Crutch nodded in approval.

Madam Bai, seeing her husband had finished speaking, also came forward to inquire about her future. Master Iron Crutch smiled and said, “In your previous life, you were no unknown person, but a queen consort during the Warring States period, reincarnated anew. Your punishment term is nearly complete; you will soon return to your place of origin. In the next life, you will be reborn as a man, with a bright future ahead—something truly to rejoice over. This is the fine fruit of your own steadfast virtue, not mere fate.” Having said this, he gave further instructions: “Now you must seek an heir. This person has already repented. Before I came, I also sent your Uncle He to manifest some spiritual signs to guide him toward goodness. Within a day or two, he will surely return, bearing a token of repentance, and ask your forgiveness. Then your family will be reunited, and you may all live in harmony.” With that, he departed.

A flash of golden light filled the room, fragrant as a blooming garden. Master Iron Crutch had already slipped away from the Wang household by means of a scholar’s escape technique. He arrived in an open space and ascended into the sky. By chance, he met the God Erlang. The two immortals raised their hands in salute. Master Iron Crutch thanked him for his kindness in mediating on Fei Changfang’s behalf. Erlang laughed heartily, saying, “You and I are alike, both wishing to cultivate the younger generation and encourage virtue. Your disciple is also mine; no need for thanks. When the three-day period ends, he will come to see me. I must encourage him further. I fear his restless heart will not be easily quelled, lest he later fall prey to ghostly delusions—that would be a grave mistake indeed.”

Though Erlang holds a high position, in terms of dao methods he is far surpassed by Master Iron Crutch. His foresight extends only a few decades; beyond that, all is vague and uncertain. Master Iron Crutch smiled and replied, “Those who govern ghosts are often themselves beguiled by ghosts; this is to be expected. Yet I see this youth has some fortune. If he can diligently persevere, after seven hundred years he will die once more, then cultivate for five hundred years, and be reborn into a noble family. He may then transcend the mundane and enter the saintly realm.” Erlang said, “That is good. I have heard that the true lord Liu Bang once wandered drunkenly in the mountains, when the soul of the former Qin emperor possessed a giant serpent, intending to devour him. Fortunately, a Daoist came to help, secretly using magic to weaken the serpent’s body so it could not move. Thus Liu Bang was able to slay it with a sword. I have also heard this Daoist is named Zhang Guo. I have never heard that name among your sect. Could he be a newly enlightened one? How did he come to bear such a heavy responsibility and achieve such great merit?” Master Iron Crutch then briefly recounted Zhang Guo’s origins and his mission to slay the serpent, as well as his relationship to his own generation.

Erlang clapped his hands and said, “So Zhang Guo’s previous life was that bat of Guankou. That means he is still an official under my jurisdiction. Speaking of this fellow, he has a good nature. But somehow he became acquainted with the old dragon of Guankou and quarreled with a flood dragon, causing great calamity. I had to rush to the Heavenly Court several times and even lead troops down to the mortal realm once. Though the matter was not his fault, it did indeed start with him. Unexpectedly, he has greatly improved and even received your true transmission—truly a remarkable fate.”

Master Iron Crutch laughed as well. “Erlang, you still remember those old affairs? Talking about them, it seems you still harbor some lingering resentment. People say true gods are magnanimous, but judging by Erlang today, your tolerance is quite small. I fear you will soon be mocked by Zhang Guo.” Erlang laughed heartily. Then he asked Master Iron Crutch where he was headed next.

Before Master Iron Crutch could answer, a violet cloud swiftly approached from the north. Erlang reached out and beckoned, and the purple cloud stopped beside him. Standing upright within it was a celestial official, as handsome as a jade crown and as serene as autumn waters. Erlang greeted him and smiled at Master Iron Crutch: “You two hail from the same place. This is Xuan Zhuzi, now serving as secretary official in the Lingxiao Precious Palace. You probably have not met him, but surely you have heard his name?” Erlang then introduced Master Iron Crutch’s background to Xuan Zhuzi. The two immortals exchanged courteous words of admiration. Erlang laughed and said, “Immortals have no need for formalities. We both enjoy seeing the ways of mortals—what’s the reason for that?” Both laughed. Erlang asked, “Xuan Zhuzi, where do you come from? Where are you rushing off to? Why do you hurry so, yet do not spread your great wings, preferring instead to travel slowly on this cloud road?”

Xuan Zhuzi, embarrassed to have his true nature revealed before Master Iron Crutch, quickly smiled and said, “Erlang, do not speak nonsense. I have been ordered to investigate the demon qi of the Qiantang River. It is said that a great flood dragon escaped from the Western Sea and is hiding at the river’s mouth. Soon it will emerge to cause calamity and disturb the region. I was specially and briefly dispatched to handle this matter and to build a shrine in the Haining area to guard against it. If we can stop the flood dragon and lessen the tribulation, it will be a blessing for the people.” Erlang laughed, “So you have newly received an honorable commission and are going to take up your post—congratulations indeed.” Xuan Zhuzi smiled and thanked him humbly. “Not at all. I must ask for your guidance. Since I have just been appointed to this external post, I am unfamiliar with all matters and fear causing delays and harming millions of lives. Fortunately, I have met Erlang and earnestly beg his instruction, so as to avoid mistakes and disasters. I would be most grateful.”

Erlang heard this, grabbed Xuan Zhuzi with one hand and held Master Iron Crutch with the other, laughing heartily: “I am but a warrior, though I have dwelt in the lower realms many years, knowing little of human affairs. Here is this learned and talented Iron Crutch immortal—why not consult him instead of asking a blind man?” Master Iron Crutch, not expecting Erlang’s teasing, blushed and laughed modestly: “Friend, do not listen to Erlang’s nonsense. He is a true god who has long held his post, yet claims ignorance of human affairs. This is modesty without proper courtesy. To flatter me, a newcomer who has not yet glimpsed the profound mysteries, in such a way only shows his intent to joke with us. Truly, it is most unreasonable.” Xuan Zhuzi, however, believed Erlang’s words deeply and also laughed: “Friend, do not be so modest. Erlang is a longtime close friend. I know his nature well—though playful, when faced with serious matters he acts earnestly and does not joke. He is experienced and well acquainted with the people. Though he dwells in the Western Heaven, from our perspective it is but half a day’s journey. If I encounter difficulties, I will surely visit him in Guankou. If he then treats me coldly or harshly, I will invite old friends from the Three Realms to hold a tribunal and tear down his old lair—then you shall see my skill. But now he is busy with official duties, so I dare not speak further. If he errs tomorrow, he may not admit fault and will blame me, saying: ‘It was Xuan Zhuzi who caused my failure.’ I cannot bear that risk.”

Their words made Erlang and Master Iron Crutch laugh heartily. Erlang pointed at Xuan Zhuzi and scolded jokingly, “Very well, you can be harsh to others yet say they are cold and harsh to you. Fine! Since you say I cause official failures, I will pray daily in the little Guankou temple, beseeching Heaven and Earth to send calamity your way, so you may commit a few errors and satisfy my grudge.” Though they joked, Master Iron Crutch’s face suddenly darkened inwardly. He thought: “Words reveal the heart and body. These two immortals are true gods with heavy duties. Why do they not jest with other words, but instead wager on ‘failures’ and ‘errors’ like a contest? This joke is too unreasonable.” While thinking, he silently calculated their futures and already understood much: Erlang would lose face once due to this jest, and Xuan Zhuzi would suffer great misfortune. Yet, since it was heavenly secret, he dared not foretell. He hastened to soothe them: “It is rare to meet thus. My humble thought is to invite you both to Mount Hua, where my disciples guard a grotto. Though small, the place is serene. Allow me to gather some local fruits and extend the hospitality of a host. What say you?” Both immortals smiled and thanked him: “Our official duties prevent us from idling. When your affairs are complete and you return to Heaven’s Court, we will surely visit the Precious Mountain.”

Master Iron Crutch is a warm-hearted immortal. Hearing their ominous talk, he wished to take advantage of the opportunity to guide them with a few words of warning. Though fate cannot be escaped, a sharp admonition might lessen disaster and fulfill the spirit of friendship. Seeing both decline due to their duties, he desisted. Then Xuan Zhuzi said to Master Iron Crutch, “Do not be so formal; I have not yet finished. Just now I said Erlang is busy, but I plan to wait until he makes a mistake, when disaster strikes, and then I will seek his help. For now, I do not need him. As for your learning and virtue, though this is our first meeting, I have long admired you. I learned from Patriarch Li that among the three volumes of the Supreme Mysterious Scripture, only a dozen or so Great Golden Immortals may peruse them. You, born latest but with the highest fortune and talent among the Daoist ranks, have been granted transmission of this scripture—clearly a being of great merit and virtue. Just now Erlang’s modesty was not proper courtesy; it was more like speaking of oneself. Moreover, I am but a newly appointed official, suddenly burdened with heavy duties amid the rampaging poisonous flood dragon. Without true talent and virtue, I fear I cannot fulfill the post. From the start, I was anxious and even petitioned to resign repeatedly. But Heaven’s favor is too great; I could not refuse. So I must boldly try. My heart is uneasy, not knowing if this is blessing or calamity. Now, by chance meeting you, a gentleman, my heart is at peace. I earnestly hope you will consider the millions of lives in Zhejiang and our kinship in the Dao, and not treat me harshly for this first meeting. I will sincerely accept your instruction and respectfully carry it out.”

Erlang laughed heartily: “Iron Crutch, hearing such earnest words, what more can you say? I cannot endure your polite exchanges; I find such refined airs distasteful and do not know how you will resolve your negotiations. Forgive me, I must take my leave. When Xuan Zhuzi receives his new post, we shall go to the Daoist assembly.” Saying this, he raised a hand, instantly transforming into a white crane soaring into the sky. As he flew, he stretched his neck and nodded respectfully to the two immortals. They smiled at each other: “This fellow is truly straightforward and lovable.” Master Iron Crutch already knew that the Xuan Zhuzi before him was the white crane immortal who had long served in the Primordial Lord’s court. Erlang’s earlier teasing about why he did not spread his wings to fly, then transforming into a crane to soar, was meant to joke with him. Master Iron Crutch felt Erlang’s joke was unreasonable. Though playful, it portended ill. He also saw that though Xuan Zhuzi spoke humbly, his face showed some unease, and he sighed silently. When Erlang cried out like a crane and flew westward, vanishing from sight, Master Iron Crutch said to Xuan Zhuzi, “Friend, your humility is admirable. If I know anything, I will gladly share it and not speak coldly. Fortunately, I too wander widely. When you take up your post, once I learn of it, I will surely come to congratulate you. Then we may discuss the local situation and the flood dragon’s havoc, perhaps offering you some guidance.”

Xuan Zhuzi was overjoyed: “Since you so graciously invite me, I shall be ever at your service.” Master Iron Crutch smiled and nodded: “Rest assured, friend, I never break my word. As for the poisonous flood dragon you mentioned, I seem to know something of it. If it emerges to cause trouble, I will carefully relay its history and methods to control it, so you will not be troubled.” Xuan Zhuzi was even more comforted and laughed again: “I am truly newly appointed and worry much about causing delays and harming the people and myself. Now that you have promised your help, I can be at ease.”

Master Iron Crutch, seeing him speak such ominous words, felt uneasy and hastened to comfort him: “Indeed, such great matters require consulting several highly accomplished immortals. I lack talent and knowledge, knowing too little. If you do not reject me, I will invite some senior Daoist masters to assist. Only pray you act with caution and care, neither reckless nor fearful. If you can maintain this, the worries and dangers you fear need not come to pass.” Thus he spoke.

What further words Xuan Zhuzi had remain unknown, to be revealed in the next chapter.
