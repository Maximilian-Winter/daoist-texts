# Chapter Fifty-Five: Guarding Against Future Perils, Gathering the Zhejiang Tides; Awakening to Past Lives, Unraveling the Dream of Mortal World

Now it happened that the Numinous Pearl Master, having received the teachings of Iron Crutch Elder, went forth to the Eastern Sea to take up his new post. It was known that the Old Flood Dragon of Guankou, after his defeat at Huaihai, had once ventured to the sea’s mouth, intent on breaking through the Welcoming Dragon Gate, occupying the Qiantang estuary, and setting himself up as king. Yet his plans were ill-concealed, and the patrolling sea officials of the Eastern Sea caught wind of his scheme and hastened to inform the Dragon King. Since the Old Flood Dragon commanded many followers and was further supported by the Demon Sect’s leader, the Dragon King and Queen took the matter most seriously. Moreover, the Queen’s mother’s tomb lay thereabouts; should the Old Flood Dragon succeed, he would surely seek revenge for the grievances at Guankou and Huaihai, first flooding and damaging the Queen’s ancestral resting place. Thus, at the Queen’s personal entreaty, ten thousand divine soldiers of the sea kin were summoned, led by the four princes and their great generals, to guard the harbor.

The Old Flood Dragon, seeing the Dragon King’s defenses were tight and his plan foiled, lashed his tail toward the shore, unleashing towering waves tens of thousands of feet high, submerging fields, homes, and countless cattle and people. Though venting his fury, it was but a hollow mockery of power—much like the common saying about blaming the Kitchen God when one has a stomach ache. Afterwards, the Dragon King reported to Heaven’s Court. The Jade Emperor issued an edict, dispatching the Numinous Pearl Master to descend and investigate thoroughly. In the lands of Haining, the local earth god revealed the people’s dreams, and a temple was established to venerate the Immortal Lord who pacifies the dragons and calms the sea.

Upon assuming office, the Numinous Pearl Master twice journeyed to the sea, conferring with the Dragon King and his consort and sons on strategies to safeguard the Zhejiang waters. Beyond petitioning Heaven to dispatch troops to station permanently at the temple, and having the Dragon King assign sea soldiers to guard the narrow passes, there was the matter of the Zhejiang tides, known as the Vast Dragon. This was because two mountains flanked the harbor like a seal, while upstream the Qiantang River’s terrain rose higher than downstream, hemming in the waters on all sides, thus creating tremendous tidal surges. Before the Numinous Pearl Master’s tenure at Haining, high tides occurred everywhere. To prevent the Old Flood Dragon from sneaking in with the rising tides, he conferred again with the Dragon King and petitioned the great celestial lords of sun, moon, and stars to jointly cast a spell, drawing the high tides from all places to converge at one spot in Haining. Furthermore, all tides throughout the year in Haining, except the regular monthly large and small tides, were gathered after the Zhongyuan Festival. At that time, the furious waves surged spectacularly, known colloquially as the Lonely Soul Tide, often capable of sweeping people under and drowning them. Thus, the famed Zhejiang tides, from the Qin and Han dynasties until today, have been most magnificent at Haining. And the greatest tides there occur after the Mid-Autumn Festival in the eighth lunar month—this is the reason why.

Since this method was enacted, tides rise and fall under the watchful eyes of divine soldiers dispatched by the Numinous Pearl Master, standing in the air, gazing far and near. Whenever sea monsters cause mischief, they are the first to perceive it and can immediately subdue the trouble. Though the Old Flood Dragon can change its form, growing large or small at will, its original shape is clumsy and massive. Generally, to alter size or transform into other things requires profound attainment of the dao. Even those who can change shape at will and unpredictably do not find it as comfortable or free as their original form. The lowest practitioners can only maintain a transformation for a few hours; once the time passes, they feel exhausted and unable to move. Ordinary beasts—tigers, leopards, wolves, dogs, horses, hawks, and falcons—can easily kill them. If the time extends too long, the soul and spirit cannot return to the original body, and even without enemies, life cannot be preserved. Unlike the high dao practitioners, true immortals whose bodies exist between being and non-being, and whose souls dwell between the realms of reality and illusion, for whom change and constancy are the same. Whether unchanging or transformed for hundreds of years, no difference is found. In short, their body, mind, and soul have no fixed abode, so harm cannot befall them. Thus, except for these true immortals, no one dares to change form lightly. When compelled by necessity to alter appearance, they remain ever vigilant, ready to revert to original form at the slightest discomfort, preferring rest before changing again. This is a natural stage all cultivators of transformation must pass through—a natural hierarchy.

As for the Old Flood Dragon, though it has cultivated for many years, it has mostly done evil deeds, lazy in hardship, wasting tens of thousands of years in scheming and rivalry. In its first thousand years, progress was rapid, able to transform at will; but after a millennium until now, its skill has not increased, only not diminished, which is rare. At present, it can maintain a transformation—enlarging or shrinking—only for one or two months. After a day or two, it must return to original form to rest before transforming again. Compared to the true upper-level Golden Immortals who change without changing, naturally and without trace, the difference is vast. To maintain a form for one or two months is already rare. The Old Flood Dragon, unambitious and mingling with lowly demons, rules among them, growing ever arrogant, believing no one surpasses it. Since the great uproar at Huaihai Village and the failure at the Clam Palace, it has hidden beneath the sea for a thousand years. Now old habits stir again, ambition flares, and it plots to seize the Qiantang River and establish a small independent court. The river mouth’s water volume is not great, mostly shallow shoals, unsuitable for its massive body. It relies on the great tides and the formerly widespread tidal surges to raise the water level, allowing it to appear and disappear. Now, with the Numinous Pearl Master and Dragon King invoking the star lords to draw and gather the tides, and divine soldiers guarding the gathering place, it is difficult for the dragon to enter. Even if it sneaks past, the shallow upstream waters and calm tides are no place for a lurking flood dragon.

Hence, the Old Flood Dragon’s grand ambition is halted; it no longer dares to look southward. Yet it hates the Numinous Pearl Master more fiercely than any enemy. Besides fleeing to Spirit Vulture Mountain to lament to the Sovereign of the All-Heavens and request troops for revenge, it hides in the sea depths, waiting for any lapse in vigilance to rise again. Even if it cannot achieve sole dominion, it will harass the Numinous Pearl Master until he is defeated and cannot live in peace and honor. This is the venomous resolve of the Old Flood Dragon. Though hidden, it resembles King Goujian of Yue, who endured hardship and nursed his hatred in silence. The Numinous Pearl Master naturally anticipates the Old Flood Dragon’s persistence and daily plans to subdue it, aiming for thorough eradication. The forces of good and evil stand opposed, awaiting the outcome, which shall be revealed in later chapters.

Turning now to the tale of Lan Caihe, who, since birth, had already reached the age of ten. Betrothed since childhood to Miss Yueying of the Jiang family, their parents grew close and intimate. Especially remarkable were Lan Caihe’s father, Lan Wen, and Yueying’s father, Wang Guang, both magnanimous and generous men, unconcerned with trifles. Seeing their children grown, and for the convenience of education, Lan Wen invited a teacher surnamed Mao to instruct at home. Wang Guang also wished to hire a teacher, but though somewhat respectable, his circumstances were modest, unable to afford a tutor. Moreover, in their rural village, good teachers were scarce, and for a girl, the choice of teacher required even greater care. While searching, Lan Wen’s household was about to open a school. Lan Wen arranged a grand banquet to honor the teacher, inviting several respectable local scholars as guests. Wang Guang, as relative and close friend, was naturally among the invitees.

At the feast, Wang Guang saw the elderly Master Mao, with white hair and beard, whose demeanor was one of strict propriety—speaking only of what was proper and acting only within decorum. He was clearly a man of high moral standing and upright character, inspiring deep respect. After some conversation, Wang Guang admired the teacher’s vast learning and suddenly thought to himself, smiling to Lan Wen: “Brother-in-law, your great fortune has brought such a fine teacher. I admire him deeply. My daughter and your son are the same age. This year, I intend to have her study for a few years. Though girls need not necessarily pursue learning, given our family’s circumstances, it would be unbecoming if my daughter remained illiterate. Moreover, she is promised to your son and will become part of your family. Your house has a long tradition of scholarship; your daughters have all been skilled in poetry and prose. If my daughter lacks even basic learning, when she marries in, she will bring little honor among sisters-in-law. I wish to cultivate her for three to five years—not to excel, but to grasp some literacy and understand the great principles of sages. This thought has long troubled me, but in our remote village, I cannot find a good teacher, which vexes me greatly. Now seeing your teacher, who combines virtue and talent, I deeply regret not having the chance to make acquaintance. I have resolved to ask you to kindly consent.”

Lan Wen quickly replied, “We are close friends; what cannot be discussed? Please speak your mind, and all shall be obeyed.” Wang Guang said, “I wish to send my daughter to study at your school. This will save me the trouble of seeking a teacher, and she is not dull; she can study alongside your son. Though betrothed, custom forbids the couple to meet, but in our families, why be bound by such rules? Besides, the children are still young; there is no cause for suspicion. After a year or two, when I find a good teacher, we can reconsider. Would you consent, brother-in-law?” Lan Wen laughed, “That is best. How could I refuse? But I fear your wife will be reluctant to part with your daughter. How shall that be managed?” Wang Guang laughed too, “If you agree, my wife has no objection. Our families have long been close, like old relatives. We live not far apart; if the ladies miss the girl, they can cross the river anytime to visit. It should cause no trouble.” Lan Wen laughed, “That is excellent. Tomorrow is too late for school. The day after, I will send a carriage and horses to escort Miss Yueying across the river.” Wang Guang rejoiced and added, “I must consult my wife to choose an auspicious day for sending her; no need for a formal meeting.” Lan Wen agreed.

Back home, Wang Guang told his wife, Madam Niu, of the plan. She at first refused, saying, “Our only daughter is already promised; when grown, she must marry out. She is still young and should be kept company for a few years. Now sending her away to study—how can we be sure they will care for her well? Worse, I hear that Madam Hu, your wife, is a cunning and difficult woman. My daughter is innocent and naive; if she offends Madam Hu and they harbor resentment, when she marries in, she will suffer lifelong hardship. Is that worth it?”

Wang Guang saw her concerns had merit but, being a man of pride, having already spoken, and since it was his request, to break the agreement would invite ridicule. So he sternly said, “These are women’s worries. We live close; even after marriage, visits will be daily. Why must you cling so tightly to her to show affection?” Madam Niu, fearing her husband, knew his mind was set and could not argue. To resist would only harm their relationship. After pondering, she reluctantly consented and chose an auspicious day three days hence to send Yueying across the river to study at Lan’s.

Though a girl, Yueying was gracious and well-mannered from childhood. Since age seven, when her father sent her to school, her mind had been filled with many classics and poems. Yet her fondest study was not these texts but the Way beyond the world, especially revering the Laozi’s Dao De Jing. By eight or nine, she had mastered it thoroughly. Now at ten, her knowledge was fuller, and she grasped its deeper meaning, often burning incense and reciting silently, pondering with sudden insight. She studied other Daoist scriptures without weariness, seeking to understand the true principles. Thus, her heart was clear and serene, with a yearning to transcend the world. Reflecting on her past lives, many cruel events had sprung from marriage. The first hurdle was the word “husband and wife,” which she must break. Yet she wondered whether Lan Caihe, who had lived in luxury and ease these years, could resist worldly desires and keep his spirit pure. If his heart changed, he would surely impose the way of husband and wife upon her, pressing and constraining. Then, beyond gentle admonition, if she could not turn him back, she would have to cultivate alone, journeying far to Mount Taihua to seek her past-life master. She believed her master, whose dao and virtue were supreme, would surely have a way to save him, and she could rest assured. Such thoughts often stirred her delicate heart, though she dared not speak a word before her parents.

Sometimes, sitting idly with her sisters, each expressed their wishes—some hoped for a wealthy husband, others a talented scholar. Only she sat with eyes closed, silent and apart. They laughed, saying, “You already have a good husband; your heart is settled, so why worry?” Yueying smiled coldly and said, “Each has their own heart, and hearts differ. My aspirations are quite the opposite; how could I join your talk?” They asked eagerly, “What are your aspirations?” She smiled and said, “Talented men are as numerous as mountains, yet none live beyond a hundred years, decaying with grass and trees. Wealthy men have riches as vast as the sea, yet in sixty or seventy years, as spirit fades, money without skill is useless. Moreover, worldly affairs are uncertain; wealth often brings disaster. Thus, it is the most unreliable and useless thing. Yet mortals fail to see this, spending their limited years chasing fame, pleasure, and profit. When impermanence strikes suddenly, all ceases. The petty struggles and pursuits cannot be carried beyond. So, sisters, none of your hopes please me.” Hearing this, they laughed and said, “You criticize our words but won’t tell us your own aspirations. What good is that?” Yueying sighed and said, “You take my words as mere criticism. Thus, I need not, nor should I, explain my aspirations further.” They laughed and dropped the matter.

Seeing her sisters, each gifted and beautiful, yet bound by fame and profit, lacking any independent strength, Yueying felt ever more that the words “fame and profit” were invisible shackles, axes that cut down the spirit—truly fearful and dreadful things. She feared her betrothed might also be ensnared by these worldly matters, losing his heart and nature. Then, this incarnation would not only lose the hope of the dao but add a great demonic obstruction, a heavy kalpa. Moreover, it would betray the Iron Crutch Immortal’s gracious intentions, forever closing the path to the dao. Each thought filled her with dread for him. She hated that, as a married woman, custom forbade seeing him before the wedding. Though she wished to warn him, she had no chance. She was sincere and deeply attached to Caihe, their bond one of life and death, arranged by their Immortal Master to be born and die together. There was no other relationship; it was unreasonable to abandon Caihe and seek the dao alone. Alas, her quiet heart was troubled by his future, restless for a moment’s peace.

While she pondered in hesitation and found no relief, she overheard her father in the next room speaking: “Young Master Lan is handsome, diligent, and talented, comparable to great ministers of old. We expect him to attain high office before twenty—a man of ambition. Yueying’s future is assured.” Madam Liu, loving her daughter, was pleased to hear such words. Turning, she saw Yueying standing silently nearby, hair modestly pinned, lost in thought.

Madam Liu smiled and said to her husband, “Look, our Yueying hears your words but says nothing. What does that mean?” Wang Guang laughed, “Girls should know to be shy like that!” Madam Liu embraced Yueying, caressing her small face with a smile: “My child, didn’t you hear how ambitious and talented young Master Lan is? So young, already planning to surpass many to become a great official! My child, when he becomes a great official, won’t you be a proper lady?”

Hearing her father’s words, Yueying’s heart was troubled. She had not expected her deep worries to become reality, which was painful. Nor did she expect her mother to speak such unfeeling, unwelcome words, making her heart ache. Her cheeks flushed, eyes shimmering, and suddenly tears rolled down. Wang Guang and his wife were startled and asked, “Dear child, what is wrong?”

How Yueying answered remains to be told in the next chapter.
