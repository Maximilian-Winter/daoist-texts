# Chapter Fifty-Six: Miss Wang Urges Her Husband to Cultivate the Dao; Uncle Hu Aids His Sister in Treachery

Now, it so happened that Yueying was reborn as a mortal, her spirit and nature undimmed. Though she dwelt amidst silks and brocades, her thoughts never strayed from cultivating the dao. Yet her path differed from others’. While most sought only personal perfection, she was bound by ties that reached beyond this life—her fate intertwined with Lan Caihe through birth and death. Caihe could not ascend as an immortal alone; Yueying could not attain the dao by herself. This was no mere external obstacle, but the deep bond between them, a shared destiny: to be born and die together, to pass through mortal flesh hand in hand, and to enter the immortal realms side by side. Such was the inevitable dao, the fixed condition. If one failed to attain the dao, the other could not abandon them and go alone. Readers, having witnessed their past-life entanglements, will surely accept this truth. For immortals, the paradox is that they are at once the most unfeeling and the most feeling beings. It is precisely because they have feeling that they must root themselves in unfeelingness. Thus, their passion is all the more bitter, their attachments all the deeper.

Yueying was originally of immortal seed, and guided by heavenly immortals, she transcended confusion and was shown the true path. At this moment of entering the world and preparing to leave it behind, she could see through all else but could not cast aside the word “feeling.” Other matters might be temporarily set aside, but with Lan Caihe, whose bond was so profound, she could not bear to forsake him and walk her own way.

In modern terms, this would be called a matter of conscience. Among all worldly affairs, the hardest to resolve is the matter of conscience. A robber brazenly holds a weapon and robs his victim; disobedient children may beat their parents. Yet at the moment of death, every shred of conscience is revealed. The awakening of conscience is tenfold more severe than any legal punishment. This is the issue of conscience. The wicked fear neither Heaven nor Earth, only the awakening of conscience. How much more so for immortals cultivating the dao—such a solemn undertaking—how could they disregard conscience and selfishly follow their own will? Generally speaking, conscience is the operation of human feeling, and human feeling itself is conscience. What conscience and feeling forbid, no one who cultivates the dao—even the most foolish husband—would believe possible.

For example, Yueying’s tender heart, having resolved to leave the world, was originally calm and steady, yet was disturbed by thoughts of her future husband. She lost appetite and sleep, all because her conscience stirred her feelings, forbidding her to abandon Caihe and seek only her own perfection. She felt such a course was not only unreasonable but utterly against her conscience. Her usual worry was that Caihe might be lost to worldly desires. When she heard that he was intoxicated by fame and profit to such a degree, she realized all her earlier fears had come true. Her parents, eager for their daughter’s happiness, rejoiced to have such a fine son-in-law, believing their daughter must be even happier than themselves. But Yueying harbored a secret sorrow. Hearing of this against her will, adding to her suffering, her heart suddenly ached, and two streams of tears fell silently. She kept all this locked within, so that Wang Guang and his wife could not guess her thoughts or feelings. They could only ask in unison, “My dear daughter, what troubles you? You have such a fine fiancé—what could be amiss?”

Though Yueying’s heart was troubled, ancient women customarily kept silent on matters of marriage and betrothal, never revealing their true opinions. Moreover, Yueying was naturally kind-hearted; she could not forget the love of her past life, yet how could she offend her parents in this life? She knew they loved Caihe deeply, and that Caihe, a young man of resolve, was beyond reproach. How could she say, “I pity him for being blinded by worldly desires, afraid he cannot cultivate the dao”? Unable to speak plainly, and pressed by her parents’ earnest questioning, she could only utter a casual lie: “I felt unwell and could not bear it, which alarmed you both. But now I am better—please do not worry.” She forced a smile, which made the old couple laugh and think she was merely shy. Wang Guang chuckled, “A young girl hearing talk of her fiancé should be a little bashful—that’s what a proper young lady is like.” His wife agreed. They knew Yueying’s words were excuses but mistook them for modesty. Their few words unwittingly freed Yueying from her dilemma.

From that day forth, Yueying’s heart grew heavy with sorrow. She was deeply unhappy but kept it inside, smiling bravely before her parents to spare them worry. At night, when the household was quiet, she would sit alone in her fragrant chamber, turning over these thoughts, pacing restlessly by her bed. Her only hope was to marry soon and meet Caihe, so she could counsel him day and night, recounting their past and present, their tangled affairs. Caihe was indeed endowed with a latent immortal wisdom and fate; those momentary confusions were but later temptations, not beyond awakening. If he could be roused, the two could enter the monastic life together, seek out immortal masters, quickly erase their karmic roots, attain the dao, and ascend to Heaven. If Caihe’s confusion ran too deep to be persuaded, she would preserve her primordial yang, cultivating the profound mysteries alone. When she reached some degree, she would abandon home and seek her master, striving to enlighten Caihe. In any case, as long as Caihe remained unawakened, she dared not leave the mortal world. This was her recent secret anguish. She only lamented their youth, for marriage must wait for the proper time. Meanwhile, Caihe daily approached the snares of the mundane world, and she feared that the longer he lingered, the heavier his worldly attachments would grow, perhaps beyond remedy. Worse, her own steadfast cultivation might wound their marital bond, a sorrow beyond measure.

Yueying’s single foolish thought had brought her to the brink of illness, yet Heaven granted her wish. Wang Guang suddenly disregarded convention and proposed that the young couple study together. Yueying saw this as the perfect moment to admonish Caihe and rejoiced, her spirit lifted. She laughed and spoke freely, transformed before everyone’s eyes. Her circle of sisters teased her, saying, “At your age, hoping to be with your husband—aren’t you shy?” Yueying felt deeply wronged but could only smile in silence.

When the auspicious day arrived, Wang Guang and his wife personally escorted Yueying across the river. On the other side, the Lan family, father and son, arrived with sedan chairs and horses to welcome her at the riverbank.

The young couple’s first meeting was like old friends reunited; they forgot all shyness and grew affectionate. On the road, they spoke little, but upon arriving home, Caihe was wild with joy. He led Yueying inside to pay respects to the elders, then to meet brothers and sisters of their generation. These young folk, fond of teasing, could not resist poking fun at Caihe. He laughed along without protest. Caihe’s mother, Madam Wu, adored this future daughter-in-law, her eyes nearly closed with joy as she embraced Yueying, calling her “precious darling.” Yueying was truly clever, playing along, calling her “mother” and “father” as if she were Lan Wen’s own daughter. Madam Wu then ordered Yueying to share her chamber, so she could care for her personally, moving Caihe out to a back suite. Yueying felt comforted by such favor.

Leaving aside these details, consider Caihe’s lifelong remembrance of his past life. At five, he began schooling; by seven, he could compose poetry and prose. His aspirations then matched Yueying’s: to cultivate immortality and the dao, not to seek worldly fame or profit. Yet the Lan family had long served as officials, and their friends were likewise bureaucrats. From childhood, the children studied with the aim of officialdom. The elders’ teachings urged them to become magistrates and bring honor to their ancestors. Caihe, still young, absorbed this environment and gradually replaced his innate will with a desire to continue his forebears’ ambitions. This was a path he felt compelled to follow. Lan Wen and his wife rejoiced in this. Madam Wu told Yueying how Caihe had resolved his ambitions and applied himself. Yueying dared not contradict, but followed custom, praising him. Madam Wu grew even more delighted.

On Yueying’s first day of study, the young couple sat face to face in the study. Master Mao was a learned gentleman, teaching these students to grasp ten things at once and read ten lines at a glance. He never took a day off, and so the young couple’s studies progressed swiftly. Yet Yueying had other plans: beyond the regular lessons, she placed several daoist texts on the desk, reading them aloud to Caihe during breaks.

At first, Caihe suspected she was showing off and paid little attention. But as days passed and their affection grew, politeness fell away. He asked, “Sister, why do you love to read these daoist books?” Yueying, hoping he would ask, smiled and replied, “Brother, have you forgotten? These are the very books we should be reading.” Caihe laughed aloud, “So it is! Sister, you must understand our past life. We were husband and wife, yet suffered such tragic fate. Reflecting on it breaks the heart. Luckily, we have been reborn and matched by immortal masters to renew our bond. We should live happily this life, making up for past injustices. Why trouble ourselves with the dao? Whether we attain it is uncertain, but a lifetime of happiness lost to the Eastern Sea is a pity. To be frank, I once thought of cultivating the dao, but life is short; why seek suffering? Hardship is minor; I fear the dao too remote, success unlikely. Many have tried, yet few are known. Thinking thus, I repent and will devote myself to the classics, preparing to serve the royal court, so you and I may share worldly wealth and honor. What say you?” Yueying quickly answered, “Brother, you err. Cultivators seek the dao because mortal life is fleeting; even a hundred years pass like clouds. Within a hundred years, even great wealth lasts but a moment. How can that compare to immortals who roam free, sharing Heaven and Earth’s longevity, sun and moon’s eternity? Though cultivation is bitter and perilous, it is brief. What is lost is small; what is gained is boundless. How is that not worthwhile? As for difficulty, it is true. But Heaven does not forsake the diligent. Those fated may succeed with perseverance. Besides, we share a past fate, have been guided by immortals. If not, why would masters care so? What others find hard, we need not fear. We must not abandon ourselves. You say few have attained immortality. But I know that in the ten continents beyond, in the upper and middle realms, there are many golden immortals, heavenly immortals, earthly immortals, and ghostly immortals. Compared to ordinary mortals, attaining immortality is rare and precious. The value lies in the difficulty of cultivation. If all could become immortals, the path would be common and immortals unremarkable. I urge you to remember our past, turn back early, and not disappoint our masters and the grace of the Underworld’s sovereign. After ascending, joy is endless, far beyond worldly riches. Moreover, your plan to serve the court and enjoy honor is uncertain—do you truly hope for it?”

Caihe laughed heartily, “Sister, you are truly bewitched! Since we live in the world, whether cultivating or not, we should make a grand mark, so future generations know of Lan Caihe and that this life was not in vain. After fame and success, if the immortal fate remains, we can strive again for the dao. If not, by then we will be old and near death—hardly a loss. What do you think?” Yueying saw his delusion was deep and words wasted. She kept silent, waiting for opportunity to admonish him again.

Meanwhile, Yueying had studied in the Lan household for half a year. Lan Wen and his wife spoiled her as if she were a treasure, sometimes more attentive than to their own son Caihe.

Lan Wen’s concubine, Madam Hu, had a son and daughter, both dull-witted and coarse. The old couple cared little for them. Hu first complained, “We are all children of the master—why the favoritism?” The wife heard but paid no mind. Hu made a fuss for a time, then gave up. Now a new daughter-in-law arrived, so favored by the wife, and Lan Wen treated her like a precious jewel. Yet the treatment of Hu’s children remained unchanged.

From Hu’s eyes, it was clear that Lan Wen and his wife favored Yueying so much that they treated her own children with coldness. This bred jealousy she could not bear. At first, she grumbled openly and behind their backs. When ignored, her boldness doubled. Yueying was young and focused on the dao, ignorant of worldly dangers and human deceit, secluded in her chamber, rarely venturing out or engaging in social affairs. Since coming to the Lan household, she spent her days studying with Caihe or helping the wife with needlework. She was not especially attentive to others, but no one minded, thinking her shy and quiet.

Only Hu, harboring resentment, saw every gesture of Yueying as disdain. She thought, “This child is still young, only a guest here, yet so proud and intolerant. When she grows and marries in, becoming our mistress, she will surely make life hard for us. I can endure now, but how will my children survive?”

With such thoughts, Hu regarded Yueying as a thorn in her side. Caihe’s constant defense of Yueying only deepened her hatred and fear. She had a brother named Hu Qian, a sly, troublemaking man from a poor household. Usually dependent on his sister’s support, he gambled daily to scrape by. He claimed to live off others’ gains and to repay kindness with protection. Since he relied on his sister, he sought to ease her troubles. Often visiting the Lan mansion, he was despised by Lan Wen and his wife. Seeing this, Hu feared for his sister’s future and his nephew’s fate. He depended on them for livelihood and saw no other way. So Hu enlisted him as an accomplice. Together they schemed to send the young couple to their deaths, so Hu would seize control of the household. Though Madam Wu was the legitimate wife, losing her son was like an official losing his seal—no one could challenge the heir. Hu Qian would become the acting uncle, and through his efforts, at least a third of the Lan estate would be his. The siblings plotted thus, yet lacked opportunity.

Heaven, however, aids the wicked. The Lan family’s calamity was near. What opportunity fate would bring, we shall see in the next chapter.
