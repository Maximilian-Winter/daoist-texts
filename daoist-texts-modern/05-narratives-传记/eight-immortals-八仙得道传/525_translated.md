# Chapter Fifty-Seven: Calamity Befalls the Household — The Parents Return to the Land of Bliss; Entangled in Fame and Profit, the Husband Clings to the Red Dust

Now, it happened that the Hu siblings were secretly plotting how to deal with the couple, Cai and He. By chance, that summer a fierce epidemic raged. The lady of the house was the first to fall ill; within less than half a year, her spirit returned to the netherworld, and she could no longer care for her precious, beloved daughters-in-law. At this time, Lan Wen had already reached the sixth year of his hope. He was a man of loyalty and kindness, naturally unwilling to take another wife and thus ruin a young girl’s happiness. Yet, managing the household affairs both inside and out could not be done without a helper. So, the reins of the entire family power, without anyone noticing, quietly passed into Hu’s hands. Hu herself could never have dreamed of such a profound blessing in her dreams.

Just as she was basking in her pride, the newly appointed great uncle on her maternal side, Hu Qian, came up with a clever plan. He said, “Sister, though you have gained some authority now, it is but temporary. Moreover, it is not a proper office, merely like an old clerk in a shop. When the manager is absent and no one replaces him, they temporarily put this familiar old clerk in charge. If handled well, no one complains. But if a small mistake happens, think about it—can you endure the criticism from outside? Once criticized, the owner can revoke your proxy authority at any moment and immediately hire another manager. At that time, will this clerk still have face to conduct business in the shop? Even if you are greedy for your position, your colleagues’ spouses will harbor resentment toward your temporary power and laugh at your fleeting glory, knowing you will fall back down like them. How can such days be endured? To speak plainly, sister, as the mistress of the house, your status is only slightly above that of the male and female servants. Now that you stand on the stage, who is not afraid of you? Who does not respect you? They all show you three degrees of special deference, seeking your favor. But if you err and the master sees your misstep, he will say, ‘A servant is only fit to be a servant, not to stand on the stage.’ Meanwhile, relatives and friends might casually advise him, or even maliciously flatter him to act as matchmaker. In such circumstances, sister, you must ask yourself: do you have a way to prevent him from taking another wife? If you cannot stop him, then as the former acting mistress, what face will you have to face these relatives, especially those servants? That is not all. Your two little enemies now, who are forced under your hand, are extremely resentful. They only regret lacking the power to drag their dead mother back to the land of the living. Once a new mother is installed, they will seek to win her favor and vent their long-held grievances. They will surely try every method to oppose you, the powerless little mistress who has lost her influence. Sister, I think for you, this is even more dangerous and dreadful than when you were a mere little mistress!”

Hu was originally an ambitious woman. Hearing these harsh words, she felt a chill of danger. Suddenly she exclaimed, “Yes, I understand now. I must make the old man take a firm stand, decide once and for all, and quickly elevate me to the official wife. Then, with power and prestige, with a legitimate title, not only will outsiders dare not utter a word, even those two little beasts at home will dare not disobey my orders!” Hu Qian laughed and said, “What a kind-hearted person you are! You are content just to be the great lady, commanding those two little creatures. But have you thought how clever and cunning those two children are? They have won the old man’s favor. Usually, even if you are strong, you are but a servant under their hands. Now, suddenly becoming their stepmother, will they willingly obey your commands and submit to your control? They will not be content, and you will never give up your stepmother’s authority. From then on, mother and children will be estranged, never to reconcile. The old man is ultimately closer to them than to you. If you consider this, you will see that merely becoming a stepmother will not bring peace. You must…”

When he reached the word “must,” he glanced around, saw no one else was present, then bit his lip gently and smiled, saying, “I will say no more. Such sins and transgressions, I do not advise you to commit. After all, you are a sensible person. When you are full and idle, close your eyes and quietly think: is there a way to become the true head of the household forever, without future troubles, and to make those two little ones, before they establish themselves, utterly unable to resist you, nor able to complain? Only by reaching this degree will this great family property truly belong to you. As for such methods, they are worthless to speak of. Fortunately, you know the old saying here: ‘No poison, no man; to hate the small is not gentlemanly.’ Your future fortune or misfortune hinges on this one move; this is the most critical turning point. Surely you can understand this without my repeating it.”

Hu hesitated deeply upon hearing this. She repeated the two old sayings uttered by Hu Qian over and over, seventeen or eighteen times. Suddenly, she stopped, clenched her teeth, pointed at her own two children, and said fiercely, “I see it clearly. I know that without this most ruthless move, there is no way to overcome those two little beasts. Fortunately, I do this for the sake of the Lan family’s descendants. Even if I act harshly, it is to honor the ancestors of the Lan clan. After all, who told them to bear such foolish, partial, and unfair children?” Hu Qian laughed, “You understand now, that is good. The old man has been ill lately, taking medicine every day. This is your good opportunity. You must be careful and quickly ask him to support you as the official wife, to fix your status. When old and weak, one must appear dignified before relatives and friends, seated grandly in the main hall, receiving the deep bows and salutations from those two little ones and Yueying. Do not underestimate these worldly rites; there is subtlety in them. Once they have kowtowed several times, their hearts will forever fear you three degrees when they see you. That is very reasonable. Once you are established officially, you will no longer need to…”

Here he stopped the second half of the sentence, smiled faintly, and said, “The rest of the good show, you must perform yourself. As you said, for the Lan descendants, you must harden your heart. Otherwise, you will only gain the reputation of a virtuous woman, but before the ancestors, you will still bear the guilt of harming your children. Merit or fault, in the end, cannot be avoided.” Hu felt as if a cooling powder had been taken by a fevered person; her heart blossomed with joy, and she praised the plan repeatedly. The siblings closed their doors again and quietly discussed many schemes. Hu Qian hurried away. Soon after, he returned, took a small package from his sleeve, and secretly handed it to Hu. Hu hastily took it and hid it in the wardrobe.

From that day forth, Hu treated Cai and He’s couple with extraordinary politeness. She cared for the ailing Lan Wen with exceptional attentiveness. Using some unknown words, within less than three days, Lan Wen, still weak, was helped to the main hall, summoned many relatives and friends, and boldly announced the elevation of Hu as the official second wife, commanding the children and Yueying to kowtow and pay respects to her.

Hu, confident and composed, immediately assumed the demeanor of the principal wife, sitting upright and receiving their grand ceremony before casually attending to the relatives and guests. Among the relatives, some who understood the matter felt this event was too strange and abrupt, deeply worrying for Cai and He. Yet Cai and Yueying remained innocent and simple. Previously, they had never shown the slightest disrespect toward Hu; now that she was their formal stepmother, they sincerely fulfilled their filial duties. This was beyond dispute.

Yet their stars of calamity shone brightly. Suddenly, Yueying’s family was set ablaze by enemies. In one night, the fire consumed everything utterly. Yueying’s mother perished in the inferno. Her father, Wang Guang, seeing his home destroyed and family lost, coughed up blood and died. The couple returned to the netherworld on the same day, only hours apart. Yueying learned the news early in the morning and hurried home by noon, just in time to send off her father’s final rites.

Before dying, Wang Guang instructed her, “I have lived a life of goodness, not knowing why such harsh retribution. Yet life spans a hundred years, and death is inevitable. Fortunately, I have no sons, only you, my daughter, who already has a husband’s family. Though your mother-in-law has died, your father-in-law still lives. Your husband is a promising young man, said to treat you well. I can rest in peace, with no attachments. As for my family’s affairs, though poor, if the funeral is simple, the expenses will not be great. Only one thing to tell you: your father-in-law has just elevated the young wife to official status. That woman is a…” Here he could say no more, taking those half words with him to the underworld. Yueying’s grief and distress were beyond words. A young girl, newly bereaved, had no experience with such rites. She could only send for her husband to come and help. She herself wept as if mad, utterly helpless.

Fortunately, Cai deeply understood Yueying’s ignorance of these matters. Besides bringing money to purchase clothes and coffins, he also invited several elder uncles from the clan to oversee everything. Cai had to manage the Wang family’s funeral and comfort Yueying, becoming overwhelmed with unprecedented sorrow and busyness. After the funeral was completed, it went without saying that Yueying had no choice but to return with Cai. To Yueying, this matter was not so important, for she had always firmly believed in the great dao. Having suddenly suffered such great loss, she felt the fleeting nature of mortal life held no value. Originally disheartened by the world, now she regarded worldly affairs as dead ashes, utterly devoid of attachment. Only Cai, with a similar background and ordinary wisdom, remained confused and unawakened, not yet seizing the opportunity to enter the dao.

When she returned to the Lan household, Lan Wen’s illness had somewhat improved. He called her into his room, asked about her parents’ deaths, and repeatedly comforted her. Yueying thanked him and then went to pay respects to Hu. That day, Hu treated her with unusual warmth, calling her “heart’s darling,” “flesh and blood,” touching her thin waist, and uttering many words of regret. Though innocent, Yueying was overwhelmed by this sudden favor, becoming flustered and unable to sit still. After a few words, she hurriedly took her leave.

Coincidentally, Cai, fearing Yueying’s sorrow, was searching everywhere to invite her to the garden for fishing to ease her mind. Yueying had no heart for amusement but could not refuse his kindness. They walked together to the large rear garden, which covered more than twenty acres, with artificial hills and ponds filled with many swimming fish. Once inside, Cai smiled and said, “Sister, today you met the stepmother. Did she say anything to you?” Yueying shook her head, “Not really. I only felt the stepmother treated me better than usual. Perhaps she saw me as a poor girl without parents or a home, so she pitied me more.”

Cai pondered and said, “Sister, you and I are sincere people, but how can we know the deceit of the human heart? The stepmother is now the elder; we are daughters-in-law. How could we suspect her of ill will? But there is one person who chills me to the bone — that great uncle. That day, I personally heard him tell the stepmother, if she wants to eliminate future troubles forever, she must take a ruthless and cruel step. First, the old man must not be allowed to do this or that. After that, I did not hear clearly and dare not guess. Probably nothing good. Sister, think about it: if they harbor such intentions, what can two children like us do to resist? Moreover, our father is now under the stepmother’s influence; his old life is in their hands. How can we sit idly by, letting him be in such danger without preparing? If we tell the old man first, he will not believe us. If the stepmother finds out, the danger will immediately fall upon us. There is no way to avoid it. Sister, think carefully: what should we do?”

Yueying, still grieving her father’s last words left unfinished, sensed the meaning was like what Cai heard. Though incomplete, such words she had never heard from her father before. Suddenly, at his deathbed, such solemn instructions showed this matter was no small affair. Her heart was troubled, yet she could not ask Lan Wen or his father much, which tormented her. Fortunately, seeing the world clearly, she thought to set it aside for a few days. Now hearing Cai’s words, her burden surged again. She said hurriedly, “Brother, this cannot be spoken lightly. Even if great uncle said this, whether the stepmother follows is uncertain. Even if they intend harm, we can only be extra cautious and never reveal their secret. That would only hasten their actions. This must never be done.”

Cai agreed. He then recounted Hu Qian’s collusion with the stepmother and their suspicious deeds to Yueying. He added, “When our mother was alive, life was truly joyful, with no fear of harm. No one dared bully us. Unexpectedly, after mother’s death, so many troubles arose. At this rate, our days ahead will be very hard!” Yueying, hearing this, suddenly had a thought and asked, “Brother, do you still wish to be an official?” Cai was surprised, “How can a person have no ambition? Why do we study the sages’ writings? Is it not to establish ourselves in the court and serve the royal family? Why would I not want to be an official?”

Yueying replied bitterly, “Brother, that is truly to trade a moment’s small gain for ten thousand years’ great blessing! Since the family disaster, my heart is like dead wood and ashes. Not only do worldly honors no longer move me, but also the stepmother’s lack of love and great uncle’s mischief do not trouble me. After all, we all must part; why care about such small gains and losses? To put it simply, I have long planned to escape the mortal dust. Before, there were difficulties: one, the natural bonds of kinship — I was the only child of my parents, dependent on them, and could not bear to abandon them to follow my own path; two, from emotional history — there is only you, brother, with whom I share a deep bond through three lifetimes, and we should share hardship and not flee alone. So I hesitated, not daring to leave the world lightly. Now that my parents are gone, my grief deepens, and I feel it is time to leave the world and cultivate swiftly. If delayed, I fear time will not favor me. I could have avoided returning to the household, but I must come now because the future depends on you alone. Though you are lost, I believe you will awaken and escape suffering soon. Though I love wandering mountains and waters, in this great sorrow I have no heart for it. I only wish to use this quiet place to have one last deep talk with you, hoping you will understand my foolish heart. Remember past times, do not let the immortal master or the dark lord mock you for being fickle and easily attached. Even you yourself will not fall again into suffering or endure great tribulation. I hope you will think carefully.”

Cai, hearing her so firm and sincere, shed a few tears and said sadly, “Sister, by your words, cultivation is certain. Whether you will succeed, I dare not say. But, but…” Cai said “but” three or four times, his face flushing red, yet he could say no more.

Yueying, seeing this, understood immediately and inwardly resented, “So you not only crave fame and profit but also harbor lustful desires. Is this not yet another demon barrier?” Seeing he could not speak, she boldly spoke for him, “What is there to hide? Is it not said that man and woman in a household is the great human bond? This can be spoken among ordinary people, but not to immortals and spirits beyond. Brother, you have not drunk the potion of confusion and may still remember past lives. Marriage ends as such. In past lives, fortunately, immortal masters took pity, guiding and rescuing us. As for this life, if we do not strive, once we slip, we fall into the Nine Hells with no immortal to save us. Brother, though bold and desirous, I dare not follow you. In short, as long as I live, I will try to awaken you. If on my last day you remain unawakened, I will only look after my own future. When I have cultivated successfully, I will meet you again. But I fear then I will be free from the world, enjoying quiet, eternal life, while you have become a bent-backed old man, all attachments extinguished, or worse, met some fate I cannot bear or speak of. Then I will not abandon you but must pull you along to the immortal realm together. Yet your demon barriers run deep; cultivation will not be easy. Even if you succeed, you may not reach the highest place. Would that not mean I wasted decades in the mortal world, suffering many needless worldly troubles? Should I not stop this?”

Cai was silent, his face blank. Yueying guessed he could not yet change and forgave his lack of worldly experience. She smiled and said, “Since you cannot heed me, I have one request: as for marriage, I will only keep the name. If you force me to fulfill the rites of husband and wife, I will leave immediately. Until I succeed in the dao, and you fall deep into tribulation, we shall not meet.”

Cai said nothing, naturally displeased.

While the young couple were secretly meeting, the household servants hurried in, calling out, “Young masters, come quickly! The master’s illness is very serious. He is about to…” The word “about to” sent Cai’s soul flying from his body. Yueying caught him, whispered a word in his ear. Cai nodded and rushed into the mansion, Yueying following close behind.

Why Lan Wen suddenly fell gravely ill will be revealed in the next chapter.
