# Chapter Fifty-Eight: The Ruthless Heart of the Fierce Woman Unleashes Cruelty; The Righteous Servant Embraces Justice

Now it happened that ever since Wang Guang and his wife had both passed beyond, Hu Qian hastened without delay to the Lan household, seeking counsel with his elder sister on a plan of advance. There he found Lady Hu, her brows tightly knit as if burdened by some great and weighty matter. The moment she saw Hu Qian, she clapped her hands sharply and said, “You come just in time. Do you know what misfortune has befallen that wretched family?” 

Hu Qian replied, “How could I not know? Seeing you so troubled, it’s clear enough. Have you not suffered their cold disdain long enough? Now that Heaven’s retribution has come upon them, surely you must feel compelled to stand up for justice on their behalf, no?”

Lady Hu spat disdainfully and laughed, “Do you take me for a fool? I would sooner see that wretched woman burn in the flames herself before I’d lift a finger to defend her!” 

Hu Qian smiled and said, “Then why the sorrowful look? Wouldn’t that be like rejoicing and grieving at once?”

She spat again and retorted, “If I say there is no grief, what joy remains? You must understand, the old man’s expenses have been heavy lately, his income unable to keep pace. Now the Wang family lies broken and bereft. That wretched woman, being his favored daughter-in-law, will bring a dowry and funeral expenses that will all fall upon our house. But that’s not all. It was said she was grown, and after this year or the next, she would return home. Now that she has no family to return to, do you think the old man would turn her out? Having such a little enemy in the house has already worn me down beyond bearing. If this wretched woman stays on, won’t she become a thorn in my eye? Though she was but a child before, ignorant and defiant, it was no great matter. But now, year by year, she grows in stature and spirit, and with a bigger heart come more schemes. The two of them, skulking and conniving together—how can I continue to live in peace?”

Hu Qian could not help but snort a laugh through his nose and said, “I truly do not understand you, dear elder sister. Are you really bent on becoming a Buddha or immortal, a saintly woman? Or are you merely wearing eighteen masks of false piety to fool your own brother? Honestly, if you truly had a kind heart, Heaven would not allow you to remain in this mortal realm; the Golden Boys and Jade Maidens would have long since come to escort you to the celestial courts as a Great Daoist Immortal. If you lack such conscience, then why spout such saccharine words of righteousness? Either you are deceiving me, Hu Qian, or you are deceiving yourself. Or perhaps you are just confused and bewildered in the moment.” 

Lady Hu, taken aback by his sharpness, flushed and sneered coldly, “You are so kind-hearted yourself, never thinking up a perfect plan for others, but only coming to mock me first. What good is that?” 

Hu Qian sighed, “So it seems, sister, you are truly blinded by greed. Such simple truths, such easy opportunities, and yet you cannot see them. I had thought you a clever woman.” He stepped closer and whispered a few words in her ear.

At first, Lady Hu dared not agree. But when Hu Qian pounded his chest and took full responsibility, she reluctantly nodded, her voice trembling, “Men are braver by nature. Even with such a ruthless heart, I might not have the courage to carry out such cruelty. You once told me, when the time comes, to steel myself; the next cruel act would bring a lifetime of fortune. Yet when the moment arrived, my hands trembled first. It seems I am but a useless vessel. Since you fully agree to take on this, I will lay this great burden upon your shoulders. When it is done, your reward needs no mention. You know well that I am not the ungrateful sort. I will not wrong you. But one thing must be said beforehand: if this matter leaks and causes a great uproar, I will not bear the blame. The guilt must fall on you. You are committing a foul deed, and death is the only outcome. Aside from doing my utmost to cover for you, I will not accompany you to court or prison. For the sake of our ancestors and our sibling bond, do not drag me into this. Can you promise me that?”

Hu Qian found this amusing beyond measure. She spoke so grandly of power, lifting herself so high, yet treated responsibility so lightly, invoking ancestors and sibling ties as if they were trifles. Truly, she was a selfish, heartless old maid. But no matter; these matters were not for now. Once the first step was taken and money gained, the world was vast and full of places to go. Why linger here to share her risks and suffer her blame? Since she was so clever, he was no fool. He agreed to her terms.

Laughing heartily, he said, “Sister, you are a master of worry. Such a small matter to warrant so many warnings and second thoughts. Well, you are a woman, and it is no shame to be timid. Since I have made the plan, I will take care of everything. Rest assured, rest assured. You only sacrifice one old husband; for all else—catching the culprit, going to prison, enduring punishment, even death—it is all on me as your brother. You stay home and enjoy your blessings like Heaven itself, without a scratch or a care. How does that sound?”

Lady Hu was overjoyed and gave thanks. The siblings arranged their plan. They intended to act that very night, but Hu Qian had to go out to procure a certain medicinal preparation, which proved difficult and delayed matters several days. It was not until Yueying had returned with Caihe that Hu Qian brought the medicine from a distant county and handed it to Lady Hu. She scolded him for missing the appointed time. Those two little beasts had already come back—did that not mean two more pairs of eyes watching? 

Hu Qian said, “What is there to fear? Those two little ones, together, are not even twenty-five years old. What knowledge could they have? Must we fear such things? How could we go about our great affairs if we did?” Lady Hu said no more.

At this time, Lan Wen’s old illness had somewhat abated, though he still took medicine daily. After taking the medicine, the doctor instructed him to rest quietly. Soon, Lady Hu prepared the medicine for him. Hu Qian entered and mixed the drugs into the bowl. Lady Hu, trembling with fear, carried it into the room and served Lan Wen the potion.

The elder was no fool—what kind of potent substance had Hu Qian brought? What was the outcome when it entered Lan Wen’s belly? Who could not guess? Indeed, within a few hours, the Lan household erupted in chaos, proclaiming the master had passed beyond. With Lan Wen dead, Lady Hu became head of the family. Hu Qian was hailed as a founding hero, wielding great power and swelling with pride. 

Hu Qian secretly summoned his sister and urged her to take advantage of this moment to strike fear into Caihe and Yueying. First, to intimidate them into silence; second, to keep them forever subdued beneath their authority, never daring to resist again. Lady Hu obeyed, making life unbearable for the young couple. They found themselves in a no-win situation—neither tears nor laughter, neither sitting nor standing was right. Truly, they were trapped between life and death. Though they knew their father’s death was suspicious, they were powerless.

Yet Hu Qian was meticulous and cautious. Not only were his actions clean and precise, but even the handling of the corpse left no trace. Not to mention Caihe and Yueying, who were but children and unaware of such matters, even the many servants in the Lan household, suspicious of their master’s strange death, paid special attention to the body’s appearance. In whispered talk, they all admired the siblings as cunning killers, able to accomplish such a swift deed without leaving a mark. Hu Qian was indeed a crafty fellow.

Perhaps sensing some wind of trouble, he and Lady Hu conspired to distribute large sums of silver to the servants, ostensibly as special rewards for the hardships of the funeral, but in truth to buy their silence.

Though the servants felt injustice for their master, none had the courage or righteous heart to seek vengeance. Having accepted Lady Hu’s generous gifts, they could only accept quietly, agreeing among themselves not to speak or meddle, lest they bring disaster upon themselves.

Thus, Lady Hu and her brother grew ever bolder. According to Hu Qian’s plan: “If you do not finish the job, the weeds will grow again. Now that the crime is committed, it is better to strike twice than once. Since we bear the guilt of one blade, why not take this chance to kill both those little pests outright and be done with it?” 

But Lady Hu insisted otherwise. She had her own serious reasoning.

She said, “If only the old master dies, no one will pay much attention. But if all three—the old master, the main wife, and the daughter-in-law—die, not only will the servants have no explanation, even neighbors and relatives will refuse to believe that all died natural deaths. If some busybody speaks out, the rumor will spread until it reaches the magistrate’s ears, and then the trouble will be great. Better to keep them for now. I am their lawful mother-in-law and head of the household. What fear have I of their rebellion? I have my own ways to make them suffer so much that they will run themselves straight to the courts of the Underworld. Is that not splendid?”

Hu Qian found her reasoning sound and left the arrangements to her. After the funeral, Lady Hu’s first move was to declare the household in dire financial straits. Even when the master lived, expenses outpaced income. Now, with the funeral costs, two funerals for the Wang relatives, and many unexpected expenses for Miss Wang, half the family fortune had vanished within a month.

To save and economize, she first dismissed the old teacher Mao, who was frail and ill and no longer able to teach. Keeping him was useless and costly. Second, she appointed Caihe to manage the cattle and sheep, and to purchase firewood and fodder. Third, Yueying was assigned to weaving, laundry, cooking, and fire tending. The other servants were sent to farm. Lady Hu took the role of overseer, Hu Qian became accountant. Their two young children were still small; when grown, one would assist the brother, the other the sister-in-law, sharing duties without distinction.

Though Caihe obeyed these orders, her heart was full of bitterness and grievance. Yueying, however, felt no shame and smiled at Caihe, saying, “From now on, no more books, no more dreams of official rank. What use are they now?” Caihe replied, “Dear sister, you jest, but we are in the same boat. I suffer hardship; how can you stand aside?” Yueying hurried to explain, “Not so. I never intended to linger long in this dusty world, good days or bad. I told you before, only to endure for your sake a while longer. In the end, we must leave. Why quarrel over these few hard days? Better to focus single-mindedly on fame and fortune than to suffer such setbacks. This is surely a difficult crossroads ahead.”

Caihe fell silent. Meanwhile, Lady Hu handed Caihe the tools for woodcutting and herding—sickles, carrying poles, whips—and sent Yueying to work elsewhere. The cruelest measure was to separate the two, denying them any chance to meet day or night. Yueying, not bound by love, felt no great pain, but Caihe’s heart could hardly bear it. Despite her hardships, she worked as best she could, but could not help voicing some complaints. The household, having all received Lady Hu’s favors, sided with her. Caihe’s grievances were twisted and exaggerated, reported with added fuel. Hu Qian, standing nearby, sneered and said to Lady Hu, “Did you hear that? You preach morality and righteousness, yet behind your back they scheme against us. If you do not act swiftly and decisively, worse troubles lie ahead.”

Lady Hu, reflecting, felt she had been too lenient with these former daughters-in-law. Angrily, she said, “I am their lawful mother-in-law. If they scorn me, they scorn the dead old master as well. They are no true daughters-in-law of the Lan family. Uncle, please devise a plan to drive these little pests from my door at once. If they refuse to leave, bind them with a rope and send them straight to the magistrate, charging them with the grave crime of rebellion and unfilial conduct.”

Hu Qian clapped his hands and said, “Good, good! You have been too soft. You need someone to keep watch and spur you on, so you won’t be taken advantage of. Since you entrust me fully, I will bear the blood debt and make sure the matter is done thoroughly, not failing your trust.” Saying this, he departed cheerfully.

At that moment, an old steward who had retired, Lan Xiu’s son named Lan Zhen, overheard the conversation nearby. Evening was near. Lan Zhen, having returned home early these days to care for his ailing mother, hurried to tell his father Lan Xiu what he had heard. 

Lan Xiu’s fury flared uncontrollably. Pointing a finger at the Lan household, he shouted, “What a pair of lawless, heartless beasts! The master died under suspicious circumstances, and everyone says it was your siblings’ doing. Only because your methods were cunning and left no trace could they escape blame. Though all know the master was wronged, none can do anything. But mark my words: the law of men may be fooled, but Heaven’s Dao is not deceived. And now, before the master’s bones have grown cold, you plot against his daughter-in-law as well. I cannot fathom what deep hatred you bear the Lan family to seek to wipe us out! Hah, if I did not know before, I do now. See if I will let you act with impunity!”

The old man’s anger grew louder and fiercer, his curses more furious, frightening his wife Wang Shi, who hurried out to clamp her hand over his mouth. Though ill, the shock drove the sickness away for a distance. She scolded him, “Old man, you’ve had your drinks and now meddle in others’ affairs. Think carefully: your son works in their house, and the new mistress is harsh. After all, she is your son’s employer. Your fate depends on her word. Why offend her needlessly over others’ troubles? If your son loses his job, and your strength wanes with age, where will you find silver to support us?”

With that, she and Lan Zhen together dragged him inside, laid him on the bed, drew the curtains, and left him to grumble to himself.

Whether Caihe and Yueying’s lives would be spared, and what further moves old Lan Xiu might make, shall be revealed in the next chapter.
