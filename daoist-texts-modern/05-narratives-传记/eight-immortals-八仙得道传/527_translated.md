# Chapter Fifty-Nine: To Scheme for Wealth One Must First Harm Life; In Saving the Master, One Is Instead Branded with Infamy

Now then, although Lan Xiu was forcibly dragged into the house by his wife and pushed onto the bed, his heart churned with new resentments and old grievances, swelling with a spirit of injustice. How could he possibly contain himself? Moreover, he recalled how three generations had relied on the Lan household for their livelihood. When Lan Wen was alive, he had shown them kindness and favor. Now that he himself had died without justice, and as a mere servant unable to avenge or redress the wrongs, this was already a betrayal of conscience. Yet, that was all in the past, and since he had known nothing beforehand, it could be said he had no chance to exert effort. But as for the young master and mistress before him—youthful and fallen from power, and in mortal danger—this matter had already clearly reached his ears. Now, before it breaks out, it was precisely the time to take precautions. If he did not warn them in advance, would that not make him a conspirator with Hu Qian and his sister in their treachery?

He pondered again and again, feeling that there was no other way. Besides, Hu Qian was ruthless and quick in action. If he struck immediately, hurrying now might already be too late. How could he delay any longer? Resolving firmly, he feigned deep sleep, waiting until the household had all fallen into slumber, then quietly slipped away, slipped out the door, and made straight for the Lan residence. Though it was only half a li apart, his aged body was frail, his eyesight dim, and his feet weak; it took him a full hour, step by step, to reach the Lan home. Being a very familiar old man, he naturally knew the layout well. Yet he did not approach the main gate nor the back door, but took a small side gate on the western end. The gatekeeper was none other than Lan Xiu’s own nephew, a boy of only thirteen or fourteen years. Lan Xiu took advantage of the boy’s ignorance of affairs and went straight to him.

The young servant opened the side gate and, seeing his uncle-in-law arriving so late, was greatly surprised. Lan Xiu forbade him from asking questions, only inquiring where the young master currently lived, and where the Miss of the Wang family resided.

The boy, having a conscience, upon hearing mention of the young master, could not help but speak sorrowfully: “Uncle Lan, please do not mention the young master again. He is suffering terribly now. Not to speak of anything else, just the place where he lives—he is lodged in a thatched hut behind the cattle shed. Inside, there are only three boards and a single bed; nothing else. The mistress said that all the herding of cattle and sheep was to be managed personally by the young master, so they let him live there for convenience of supervision. If you want to see him, you must pass through the mistress’s quarters, crossing several gates. Should you awaken the mistress or the old uncle, it would be most unwise. It would be better to visit Miss Wang instead, as she lives closer. She too suffers greatly, but somewhat less than the young master, and her lodging is far more comfortable. The mistress said the young master and the lady are no longer children and should not live together, so they are separated by several courtyards. They are kept apart. Thus, it is not easy for the young master and the lady to meet. I have heard the young master complains about this.”

Before the boy finished, Lan Xiu sharply interrupted: “Children should not speak so much. Take me to see Miss Wang at once.” The boy readily agreed: “That is easy; she lives just in front of my room. It is late at night now, everyone inside is fast asleep. Uncle Lan, if you go, you need not disturb anyone, right?” This was exactly what Lan Xiu wished to hear, and he praised the boy for his insight and reason, saying he was far better than his cousin. The boy’s heart blossomed with joy and he led Lan Xiu to a window framed by moonlight.

The boy tapped thrice lightly on the window with his index finger and softly called, “Miss Wang, are you awake? Your Uncle Lan has come to see you.” At this, a faint murmur came from within, asking, “Is that not the old steward Lan?” Dear reader, though Yue Ying was a lady of deep chambers, even though she had been disgraced and cast down, her dignity remained unblemished. At such a still and silent hour, for a man to come seeking her was indeed a fearful and strange occurrence. But the boy was clever; by naming Lan the old steward, he dispelled much of the shock inside. Moreover, in such a deep night, with the mansion quiet for long, how was Yue Ying not yet fast asleep, able to awaken so lightly at a mere call? The truth was, Yue Ying was devoted to cultivation, and at night’s stillness and dawn’s approach, she always practiced an hour of seated meditation. When the boy knocked, she had just finished her practice and was preparing to lie down. She was exceedingly clever, having lived with the Lan household for years, well acquainted with their internal and external staff. She admired the old steward Lan most of all. In this life-and-death moment, she was ever watchful and alert, always prepared to prevent misfortune. Hearing that the long-absent old steward Lan came at midnight, seeking no one but herself, she had already guessed with great certainty what was afoot even before uttering a sound.

She asked as she rose from bed, peering through the window slit. Indeed, there stood a black-faced boy supporting a wrinkled, white-haired old man like silver, beneath the window. Yue Ying did not delay; she hurriedly opened the door and stepped out, but did not allow them into her room. Instead, beneath the bright moon in the courtyard’s center, they spoke softly and quietly.

Yue Ying first asked, “Honored uncle, to visit so late surely means you bring grave news, is that not so?” Lan Xiu was startled and bowed deeply: “Miss, have you also heard? Why have you not prepared sooner?”

Hearing this, Yue Ying was momentarily stunned, then said, “I will not conceal from you, honored uncle. Caihe and I truly have no news. What I just said was but a wild guess stirred by your unusual actions, and I did not know if it was true or not. Now that I hear from you, it seems my guess was unfortunately correct. Yet Caihe remains unaware. Pray tell, honored uncle, what has happened now? As for me, I had already turned my heart away from worldly matters. If they are incompatible, it only hastens my path to the dao, for which I feel boundless gratitude. What I fear is only for Caihe alone. Alas, alas, no need to say more. Who calls him... ah, no need to dwell on it. Please, honored uncle, quickly tell me the news. I can then inform Caihe and prepare for what is to come.”

Lan Xiu sighed and recounted the evil plot devised by the Hu siblings and how he had come to know of it. He expected Yue Ying to be utterly terrified. Yet, upon hearing this, she remained calm and even gave a cold smile: “Oh, is that so? Then this is a fortunate misfortune for me. Pray, honored uncle, since they have planned it, do you know on what day it will be carried out?”

Lan Xiu replied, “That I do not know. The boy said it would likely be within one or two days. I meant first to tell the young master, but who knew he was so bold as to treat the young master so cruelly and unjustly? I could not see the young master today, and if delayed until tomorrow, I fear the villains will act at once. What then?”

Before Yue Ying could speak further, a sudden mocking laugh rang out from the alleyway. The three—Lan Xiu, Yue Ying, and the boy—were greatly alarmed. Searching for the source, they saw several dark figures darting out like shadows. In the moonlight, it was clear: the leader was none other than the newly appointed uncle-in-law Hu Qian, followed by three servants recently hired by him.

They rushed in a pack to Yue Ying’s side. Hu Qian sneered, “What a shameless young madam, a noble lady of fine family, yet truly a vile harlot who steals servants’ men. With such a daughter-in-law, the Lan household’s reputation is utterly ruined, its honor lost. Usually coy and timid, like a fox’s charm, beguiling her husband as if a proper person—how is it now? The truth is plain, caught red-handed, the mask fallen. Well then, since you have no shame, I care not for the Lan household’s face. Perhaps it is best to send you to the magistrate’s office for a visit.”

Having said this, he turned to his three men and barked, “Quickly bind these adulterers and harlots.” The three immediately moved to seize them, though they did not know whom exactly Hu Qian meant to bind—besides Yue Ying, there were old and young alike. The old was too old to be a lover; the young too young to be a lover. They quietly asked Hu Qian. Hu Qian paused, then roared, “Bind them all together! I know who the adulterers are!”

As the three moved in, Lan Xiu and Yue Ying naturally flew into a rage, cursing loudly. The boy, seeing his uncle wronged and himself falsely implicated, also shouted insults at Hu Qian’s shameless wickedness, openly recounting Hu Qian’s many past rogue tricks and repeated visits to the Lan household begging for loans.

As this was said, Hu Qian’s feigned anger became real fury; he stamped and clapped, urging his men to attack. One guarded Yue Ying, two seized the old man and the boy. Yet Lan Xiu and the boy still had some strength and resisted. Hu Qian’s men were all lowly ruffians, wasted by wine and lust; though they looked fierce, they were inept. Having been roused from sleep, confused and half-awake, they did not understand the situation fully and were surprised by the resistance.

Lan Xiu’s nephew, small in stature but unaware of the stakes, reached out and grasped one man’s kidney. It is said that squeezing a person’s kidney can be fatal. In the desperate moment, he gripped and twisted hard, causing the man to cry out and fall backward. Hu Qian and the man guarding Yue Ying shouted in alarm, “The boy has killed someone!”

Lan Xiu and the other man, evenly matched in fight, stopped upon hearing this and looked at the fallen man. The uproar had already roused everyone inside and outside. From the new mistress Hu down to the servants, all hastily dressed and came to see. Even the disgraced young master Lan Caihe hurried out in panic. Seeing Hu Qian gesturing and reporting the scene to Mistress Hu, Caihe caught a few words and knew Hu Qian was framing Yue Ying. He rushed to Yue Ying, weeping: “Sister, I have harmed you.”

Yue Ying could only gaze at Caihe with moist eyes, unable to speak—her tears rising and falling, words caught in her throat.

The man guarding Yue Ying, seeing Caihe’s closeness to her and feeling shame and anger at being beaten by Lan Xiu and the boy, vented his spite on Caihe. Knowing Caihe was a so-called young master but actually lower than a servant, and Yue Ying was his prisoner to guard, he had no scruples. He glared fiercely and shouted at Caihe, “Your wife is a thief and harlot, yet you have the face to cry and speak with her?”

Before he finished, a sharp slap rang out, followed by two more. The man was shocked and looked to see the first slap came from Caihe on his left, the next two from Lan Xiu on his right. Caihe cursed him for bullying with false authority; Lan Xiu called him a lowly beast. Hu Qian and others joined in scolding Caihe. The man cursed Lan Xiu and tried to slap him back.

The great courtyard erupted into uproar, voices clashing, no one yielding. Hu Qian shouted to the crowd, “If you want to eat in this household, you must obey Mistress and me. Quickly bind these three adulterers and harlots and send them to the county. Now they have killed a man, the crime is greater. If you refuse, Mistress will throw you all out; no more service here.” He repeated this several times, but the servants looked at each other, unwilling to move. Their conscience stirred; they had all benefited from the Lan family and could not betray their hearts by committing such treachery. Hu Qian grew furious, cursing wildly at the crowd.

Seeing this, Lan Xiu urged Caihe and Yue Ying, “Young master, young lady, let us go. The world is vast; we can find food elsewhere. Leave this household to them. Though I am old, I would rather wander to the ends of the earth with you than stay here and suffer daily insults and plots.” Saying so, he took Yue Ying by one hand and Caihe by the other and hurried out the door, the boy following. No one dared stop them; the three left the house.

This enraged Hu Qian, who roared like an ox, returned to his room, fetched three heavy knives, clubs, and ropes, and summoned his new servants. They all rushed out the main gate. Under the moonlight, they saw Caihe and the others fleeing along the riverbank. Hu Qian commanded, “Catch those four! There will be great reward. If any harm befalls them, I alone will bear the blame. If anyone deliberately lets them escape, they will share their guilt.” The men braced themselves and gave chase. In a moment, they caught up.

Hu Qian gave a sharp whistle; all brandished weapons, threatening the fugitives to return at once or face death. Lan Xiu cursed the villains as utterly heartless and vowed they would be struck by thunder. The boy urged his uncle to flee quickly.

Lan Xiu still cursed, while Hu Qian took out ropes and ordered his men to bind these shameless wretches. Caihe and Yue Ying were unarmed. Caihe, considering himself the rightful master, thought Hu Qian dared not harm him, and sneered: “Returning is our own home; why force us? Sister, let us go back and see what they can do to us.” Turning, he strode swiftly toward his home, Yue Ying following. Lan Xiu and the boy, though cursing, had to follow behind.

Yet Hu Qian, intent on humiliating Caihe and Yue Ying, harbored a darker plan: to kill them both and leave Mistress Hu to bear the blame, so he might seize the opportunity to profit and flee. He would not allow them to walk away so easily. He unleashed his full fury and ordered them bound and sent to the magistrate.

The men obeyed, shouting as they advanced and seized Caihe and Yue Ying, preparing to bind them. Suddenly Yue Ying cried out, “Heavenly Master above! Your disciple Yue Ying has never once forgotten the teachings of my master, nor ceased to cultivate the dao. Only because I could not bear to see my husband fall into the demon path did I delay leaving the world for years. Yet today I suffer such disgrace. Though my fate is hard, I am a lady of noble birth, enduring hardship without complaint, but I cannot accept this insult. I care no longer for my husband’s future; I will now sacrifice my remaining life and ascend to meet my master in Heaven.” Saying this, she suddenly broke free and dashed toward the riverbank.

The crowd knew she intended to drown herself and Hu Qian was pleased, ordering them not to rescue her. Others hesitated, but Caihe wept and shouted, trying to follow. His hand was held back, and in desperation, he bit the hand holding him, causing pain and release. Caihe ran after Yue Ying. Hu Qian said, “Let them go; let them die and see how.” Lan Xiu and the boy were held fast and could not follow. All watched in stunned silence as the young couple ran to the riverbank, weeping and holding each other, then leapt into the water.

This was a deep, swift bend of the Yangtze River. Once plunged in, there was no hope of survival. Caihe and Yue Ying were both frail youths; naturally, they should have perished. Yet, in the world, there is no law above Heaven’s law. If such deeply rooted children were to die by Hu Qian’s hand, would that not mean the total collapse of cosmic justice? Rest assured, the world is not so unfair.

The villains watched eagerly as the two young masters plunged into the water, ears straining for the expected splashes that would mark their deaths. Their task would then be done, and they could return for their reward. Even Hu Qian, eyes and ears alert, waited for the sound of their drowning, eager to proceed with his second plan. Yet, though they saw the two leap together, no splash came. This puzzled them all. They approached the riverbank and peered down. Ha! A marvelous sight unfolded before their eyes, so wondrous that Lan Xiu and the boy cried out repeatedly, “Heaven has justice! Heaven has justice!” Hu Qian was dumbfounded, speechless for a long while.

What this wondrous spectacle might be, and how the tale unfolds, is a drama for another time—await the next chapter’s revelation.
