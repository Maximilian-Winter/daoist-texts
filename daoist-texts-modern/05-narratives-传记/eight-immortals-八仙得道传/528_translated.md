# Chapter Sixty: Thunder and Lightning Unleash Might to Punish the Wicked Slave; Immortals Employ Their Methods to Rescue the Noble Disciples

Now it happened that Hu Qian led a band of wicked slaves, forcing the two young masters to leap into the river. They watched long and hard, yet never heard the customary splash—no plop nor thud—nor saw even a palm-sized ripple rise upon the water’s surface. The riverbank was sheer and steep like a cliff, without a single reed or rush to conceal a body. So where, then, had these two children plunged? Curiosity seized them all, and without a word, they hurried to the river’s edge, many eyes peering down into the depths.

Suddenly, a burst of golden light surged from beneath the water, striking their eyes like a thousand needles—each one aching unbearably. They hastened to shut their eyes tight, crying out in pain. Only Lan Xiu and the young servant felt a refreshing clarity and brightness. Through the golden radiance, they clearly saw a red lotus slowly ascending. Upon the lotus stood two men and two women; besides Cai and his wife, the other pair were clad in garments beyond the mortal realm, radiating the aura of immortals.

Lan Xiu quickly took advantage of the others’ blinded eyes to untie the ropes binding the two. They knelt, bowing their heads repeatedly: “Immortal Lords have saved our masters and taken them to Heaven.” This single cry startled the cruel masters and wicked slaves, who involuntarily raised their heads to behold the golden light, guarding the red lotus. Upon the lotus stood four immortals, and their two young masters were clearly within. Terrified, the band of slaves fell to their knees, bowing in worship. Only Hu Qian, though shaken in heart, stubbornly declared, “These are demons ensnaring people—surely they have dragged those two little brats into some cavern to be devoured as a snack.”

Before he could finish, a loud voice rang out from the sky: “Lan Xiu, listen well. Your masters are of immortal seed, but through a single lapse of thought, they were banished to the mortal world. Your young master’s heavy desires have ensnared the young mistress, and both suffer this calamity. Now they are taken to a famed mountain to cultivate the dao. You and your nephew are loyal and steadfast, truly commendable. I command the local Earth Deity to send you home, granting each an immortal elixir to extend life to a hundred years; soon you shall receive one hundred taels of gold to share. Hu Qian’s cruel and wicked heart is beyond pardon. I now dispatch the thunder and lightning generals to execute immediate punishment.”

Only then did Hu Qian’s terror swell to great fear. He prostrated himself, trembling, crying out to the exalted immortal for mercy, vowing never again to do evil. Yet his sins were full and ripe. Suddenly, a thunderclap split the air. All beheld two fierce-faced generals within the golden light—one man, one woman—bow respectfully to the two immortals. Black clouds swiftly gathered, blotting out the moonlight, while flickering golden rays lit the scene as bright as day. The clouds lowered abruptly, and all heard the generals speak: “Reporting to the dharma masters, by imperial decree we are to strike down Hu Qian with thunder. Alas, it is the cusp of late winter and early spring; Heaven and Earth’s qi do not yet mingle. To wield thunder now, we must first report to the Jade Emperor and receive special sanction. Only then may we proceed with the execution.” The immortals instructed, “Prepare immediately to perform the spell. I shall personally report without error.” The generals bowed, “With the dharma masters’ report, we shall obey the command.”

With that, they bowed once more and withdrew. In an instant, the golden light vanished, but the thunder roared, shaking the mountain valleys. Yet no lightning flashed. Hu Qian and his band sought to flee, but found their feet heavy as if nailed to the earth, unable to move an inch. Though a cruel villain, Hu Qian’s evil thoughts vanished; his soul scattered. He first wailed and begged for mercy, but the thunder’s roar drowned his cries a thousandfold. Alas, his final words of repentance could not reach Heaven’s ear. The thunderclaps circled above his head, poised to strike but hesitating, tormenting him unbearably. The other wicked slaves suffered the same agony and terror. Only Lan Xiu and the young servant stood apart, untouched by pain, watching the thunder’s punishment unfold.

After some time, golden light rose again in the sky. Within the radiance, the immortals called out: “Lord of Thunder, Lady of Thunder, hear this: the imperial edict has arrived; proceed swiftly with the execution.” Each word pierced Hu Qian’s ear like a thunderbolt. He felt a deafening roar atop his crown as three souls fled—two gone, one remaining. The thunder resumed, now accompanied by flashing lightning. Suddenly, a crackling blast echoed through the open air, filling the sky with the scent of brimstone. Hu Qian, with a heart utterly wicked and conscience lost, screamed once and was struck down, reduced to charred blackened wood—no longer among the living. Several of his wicked slaves escaped thunder’s wrath but were so frightened that some fell ill, others blinded for life by the golden light.

Lan Xiu and the young servant hid nearby, waiting until Hu Qian’s death was certain before bowing again in gratitude. Suddenly, a voice whispered: “The immortals have departed; no need for further ceremony. Come with me and return home to enjoy your blessings.” Though they heard the voice, no figure appeared. Knowing it was the Earth Deity sent by the immortals, they thanked him repeatedly and followed. Upon reaching home, dawn was breaking. Lan Xiu heard again: “Old friend, farewell, farewell. An immortal elixir is placed in your ear; remove and swallow it.” Hastily, Lan Xiu bowed to the empty air. He felt something lodged in his ear and, using his small fingernail, extracted a smooth, crystalline elixir. He swallowed it at once. Later, while working in the vegetable garden with his nephew, they unearthed a jar of gold—proof that the immortals do not deceive. They shared the treasure equally and enjoyed their blessings. Lan Xiu lived to a full hundred years before returning to Heaven. But these are tales for another time and need not be detailed here.

As for Cai and Yueying, having been rescued by the male and female immortals and witnessing Hu Qian’s thunderous execution, they felt relief mingled with pity. They dared not speak and followed the immortals as they soared on clouds like swift winds. After some time, as if a meal was ready, the immortals said, “We have arrived; let us descend.” The clouds dipped swiftly, and in a blink, they stood before a stone house atop a high mountain. The two immortals halted and smiled gently at Cai and Yueying. Yueying recognized the man as her former master, Iron Crutch. The woman seemed familiar, though her memory was faint; Cai recalled her only dimly.

Yueying immediately addressed the master, bowing to the ground. Cai knelt alongside her, both bowing deeply. Iron Crutch bade them first pay respects to the female immortal: “This is your senior uncle.” They bowed again. Iron Crutch led them inside the stone chamber, where a young Daoist emerged, kneeling and greeting: “Master, senior uncle, your disciple Yang Ren pays respects.” Iron Crutch waved them to rise and entered with the female immortal. Yang Ren followed, ushering Yueying and Cai inside. The two immortals sat solemnly above; Yang Ren and the others bowed once more. Iron Crutch comforted Yang Ren and praised Yueying. Then he sighed to Cai: “Because of you, this child, Yueying’s cultivation was delayed by years, trapped in the mortal net. She urged you so earnestly, yet you argued and remained lost in delusion. With your foolish nature, you should have been cast out long ago to endure torment and tribulation, never to turn back. Without anyone to plead for you, you would be condemned to the eighteen layers of the Nine Nether Hells. But for your wife’s sake, we now grant you one last chance. You must go to Mount Wangwu to quietly refine your sitting meditation for three years. Only then, if your resolve changes, will the great dao be taught to you. If you find you cannot endure the solitude, hunger, cold, and wild beasts of mountain life, I will not force you. You may descend and pursue your worldly fame and fortune, enjoying your grand halls and beautiful concubines.”

Hearing this, Cai wept bitterly: “I now see clearly my past folly. Not only did I cause Yueying to lose her immortal fate, but I myself have brought suffering. My studies remain unfinished; my stern father and cruel stepmother have repeatedly oppressed me. Were it not for the aid of the immortal master, I would long have been buried in a fish’s belly, with no hope for fame or wealth. Moreover, I was not without foundation. Now, having seen the immortal example, I know my vain words were the utmost folly. To cling to the mortal world and lose self-respect is worse than beasts or plants. Master, please rest assured: not only will I not refuse cultivation, I would gladly face fire and water, life and death itself, without hesitation. Please send me forth at once.”

Iron Crutch laughed: “Fine words, but can you truly do it? You say you would face fire and water without complaint, but you do not know that seeking immortality is the hardest task under Heaven. At the crucial moment, fire and water are but trifles; far worse dangers, with death all but certain, must be faced. You cannot avoid them, nor show the slightest fear. Can you truly endure?”

Cai bowed deeply: “The greatest fear is unwillingness to die. I now regard myself as dead already. No matter the peril, it cannot be worse than death. I dare not call myself a man of resolve, but I must urge myself constantly.”

Iron Crutch smiled and nodded: “Very good. No blame for the past. The future’s success or failure depends on this journey. I will not send anyone with you; there is no idle person here. Cultivators must endure hardship. Wandering mountains and waters is the joy of suffering. Along the way, you will pass many famed mountains and rivers, savoring their beauty. Go slowly and alone.”

Yueying stood nearby, listening. She knew Iron Crutch’s command for Cai to go alone to Mount Wangwu was meant to test his body and temper his sinews. With danger unavoidable and fear forbidden, hardship was certain. Cai, a noble youth accustomed to entourages crossing rivers, now must walk this perilous path alone. Though the immortal master surely had wisdom and no harm intended, Yueying’s heart grew heavy with worry.

Just then, Iron Crutch turned sharply and shouted at Yueying. To others, it was an ordinary voice, but to Yueying’s ears it was like a thunderclap from a clear sky. Having just come from thunder and lightning, she had not found those sounds so fierce, but this shout made her heart pound wildly, her face paling, tears nearly falling. None present understood Iron Crutch’s intent or why Yueying was so frightened. Even Yueying herself did not know why she was so shaken. Iron Crutch then snapped at her: “Immortals are often more merciless than merciful. Foolish desires die hard; the dao heart wavers. You are the wisest and most resolute here—why bind yourself to such worldly attachments? Though your love differs from ordinary couples’, know that if the root of love remains, you may fall into demonhood. The deeper the demon path, the weaker the true path. The superior person is cautious in subtle and private matters—that is why.”

Hearing this, Yueying’s heart suddenly brightened; all thoughts vanished. Not only toward the world but even her usual concern for Cai was released. At this moment, her spirit shone clear and pure, unlike her former self, who fancied herself dead and withered. Unconsciously joyful, she bowed gracefully to Iron Crutch and gently bit his daoist shoe with her cherry lips, holding on long to show her respect. Iron Crutch laughed heartily, nodding repeatedly, and said to Yang Ren: “This child is teachable, truly a seed of immortality. Far better than Cai, her future is boundless.” Then to Cai he said: “You and Yueying share the same origin and foundation. Because she has not lost her true nature and remains unsullied, her path is near and immortality easy. In about thirty years, she will reach minor attainment. You, burdened by desire, will lag ten years behind, even with effort. But in any case, you both have innate roots, so the advantage is great. Even if you are decades slower, your path remains easier than most.”

At this, he pointed to Yang Ren. Yang Ren smiled: “Master, if you heed today’s teachings, focus single-mindedly, fear no hardship, dread no pain, shun no danger, and endure solitude, in a few years you will match our decades. Decades hence, we will still seek your counsel.” Cai thanked him for his advice. Yang Ren added: “Brother, do not be too humble. We are family; we must treat each other as kin. By the master’s order, I must now take my leave. Though foolish by nature, I shall obey commands and strive diligently. If I fail, I hope you will remind me as a fellow disciple. It would be my great fortune.”

Iron Crutch then ordered Yang Ren to bring a bag of silver, several robes, and all necessary travel supplies, handing them to Cai with instructions to descend the mountain immediately. Cai lingered, reluctant to depart. Iron Crutch scolded: “Confucius said, ‘To hear the dao in the morning and die at night is sufficient. If one does not catch up, one fears losing it.’ Since you have resolved to seek the dao, do not waste even a day or an inch of time. The sooner you start, the sooner you attain the dao. I have spoken; why do you still linger?”

Cai could only bow and bid farewell. All returned their bows. At Yueying’s side, he said: “Sister, your heart for me is true and complete. These past years you have been delayed by me; in the years ahead, watch over me. Even if I die in the mountains, I will never again disappoint you. Please cherish your dao body. When I make some progress, I shall seek your great teaching.” Yueying, less sorrowful than before, replied with encouragement and, with Yang Ren, personally saw him down the mountain. Only when he was far away did they return to the cave abode.

Iron Crutch laughed to He Xiangu: “Sister, what do you think of Cai’s prospects?” She smiled: “His heart is good, but worldly attachments run deep. I fear his dao heart lacks firmness, which will hinder his future. Compared to Yueying, he is far behind.” Iron Crutch chuckled: “Yueying is naturally better, but Cai’s cleverness is not inferior. Having endured this great trial, he has grown indifferent to worldly matters. His silence today shows the foundation of entering the dao. Three years of quiet cultivation on Mount Wangwu will surely bring success. Yet he must be fully awakened and prevented from new distractions. Only thus can his dao heart be single, advancing boundlessly and swiftly. With nothing pressing here, we might take Yueying down the mountain to follow Cai secretly and enjoy a little outing.” He Xiangu gladly agreed.

Iron Crutch then inquired about Yang Ren’s recent studies. Yang Ren reported that the day after tomorrow was his late mother’s anniversary, and he must clean and offer sacrifices at her grave. Iron Crutch nodded: “That is proper. Your mother lacks immortal fate; I can only help her become a ghost immortal, no higher. When you see her, urge her to perform meritorious deeds to cultivate blessings. When you achieve true fruition, perhaps she may become an earth immortal.” Yang Ren bowed deeply: “I shall certainly encourage my late mother to widely perform good deeds for future blessings.”

Iron Crutch nodded. After parting with Yang Ren, he rode the clouds back to Lan Caihe’s home. Along the way, he said to Yueying: “Do you know why I go to the Lan household?” Yueying replied: “My father-in-law died under unclear circumstances. The whole village knows, but the chief suspect is my father-in-law’s legitimate wife’s sister. Though Cai and I know the truth, there is no proof; who can speak falsely? Now that you personally go to the Lan home, it must be to resolve this injustice and clear the dead man’s name. As the youngest, I dare not speak rashly. As for the troubles my husband and I suffered, they were all Hu Qian’s doing. Since he has confessed, our grievances are gone, and we seek no revenge against our elders. I know you would not trouble yourself for us.”

Iron Crutch praised her words: “Your father-in-law died at the hands of the Hu siblings. The attackers acted together, but the mastermind was Hu Qian alone. His guilt is greatest and most evil. Though struck down by thunder, his punishment is not yet complete. In the underworld, he still suffers the tortures of knife mountains and sword trees. As for your aunt, a concubine newly raised to legitimate status, she failed to repay kindness with loyalty. She listened to the wicked brother’s words, plotted your father-in-law’s death, and sought to harm you and your husband. Her heart is no better than Hu Qian’s. Yet there is a difficulty: your father-in-law was a good man, leaving behind a young son and daughter, both Hu’s children, still tender and needing their birth mother’s care. Should Hu’s punishment be severe and she die, those children would suffer. So for now, we must temper the punishment, instructing her to raise the children well and not foster new malice. Though she cannot atone fully, her crimes may be somewhat lessened. We shall go and teach her this. Besides, there is another matter requiring a day or two’s delay. Once both matters are settled, we can hasten back to Henan to track Cai’s progress.” Both were pleased to hear this.

As the master and disciples spoke with interest, a streak of black cloud flew swiftly from the northeast corner. Iron Crutch cried out in alarm: “Wicked beast, wicked beast! Repeatedly thwarted yet unrepentant, still daring to harm others. Alas! This head raised again—how many innocent lives will fall beneath its hand?”

What manner of power this thing wields shall be revealed in the next chapter.
