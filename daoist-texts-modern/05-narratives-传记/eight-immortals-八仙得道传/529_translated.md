# Chapter Sixty-One: Li Tieguai Visits Master Xuan Zhuzi; Wang Yueying Tests Lan Caihe

Meanwhile, He Xiangu and Wang Yueying followed Master Tieguai, riding the clouds toward the Lan family estate. Along the way, the master and disciples discussed how to deal with the Lan descendants and punish the Hu clan. Tieguai then said, “This is a small matter. For Caihe’s sake, and for Yueying’s honor, I cannot omit this journey. Besides, there is an even greater matter.” He Xiangu quickly asked what other matter the senior brother referred to.

Before Tieguai could answer, suddenly in the northeast corner of the sky appeared a mass of black clouds, flying swiftly southward. Tieguai sighed, “What a wicked thing. Who knows how many living beings it will harm this time?” Then he told the two, “The greater matter I mentioned is precisely this. Can you discern what stands atop that black cloud?”

He Xiangu, with her profound cultivation, had already seen it—a colossal, mighty dragon, its golden scales flashing, fierce and vigorous beyond measure. She told Tieguai at once. Yueying, however, saw nothing but a pitch-black mass. Tieguai sighed, “In terms of age, even the celestial immortals of the upper realms today are few who surpass it. As for cultivation, it can vanish into the heavens, and it can transform at will. Among ordinary immortals, few can match it. Yet, for reasons unknown, it delights in sinking into the demonic path, committing deeds that harm Heaven and violate principle. Though it may evade heavenly punishment for a time, when the great reckoning comes, it cannot escape thunderbolts. What a needless fate!”

He shook his head repeatedly, lamenting, “What a pity, what a pity!” Yueying asked about the creature’s origin and its mischief. Tieguai smiled and said to He Xiangu, “That is the wicked beast that once ravaged the Snail Spirit Daoist Altar. Time and again it sought to seize Qianjiang as its base. Fortunately, Master Xuan Zhu has guarded well, so it has not succeeded. But fate is fixed; eventually it will cause havoc. I am going now to present Xuan Zhu with a talisman that can save millions of lives. If the worst comes, it can be used in emergency.” He Xiangu listened with deep admiration. Tieguai then recounted the old dragon’s history to Yueying, who was amazed: “We strive earnestly for immortality and the great dao. This ancient dragon, with such profound cultivation, yet behaving so arrogantly—does it not bring about its own destruction? Such a waste of ten thousand years’ merit.”

Tieguai and He Xiangu exchanged sighs. By then they had arrived at the Lan residence. Tieguai, He Xiangu, and Yueying descended from the clouds, startling the Hu family—old and young alike—who all knelt with heads bowed, afraid to raise their eyes. Only Yueying did not accept such formal reverence, quickly stepping aside. Seeing Yueying come with immortals, the Hu family knew she had already become an immortal and dared not show disrespect. Fearing she had come to avenge past abuses, they trembled and stammered, calling out, “Miss Wang… Miss Wang… young… young madam…” like a volley of arrows, all overly familiar. When they tried to explain past grievances and plead for forgiveness, Tieguai suddenly shouted, frightening them so much they nearly fainted.

Yueying hurried forward to support them and quietly reassured, “Do not be afraid. My master is a Daoist immortal. He has come only to save you, to spare you from suffering and the wheel of rebirth. Just listen carefully, mend your ways, and you will find benefit in the future.” Hearing this, the Hu family trembled and said, “I understand your kindness, young lady. I was blinded by greed and failed to recognize good people. For all my past wrongs against you, I beg you not to hold them in your heart…” Yueying felt uneasy and quickly smiled, “Listen to the immortal master’s teaching. See what he holds in his hand?” The Hu family looked at Tieguai, but the sight terrified them more and more until they screamed and collapsed, foaming at the mouth, unconscious.

It turned out that Tieguai held a small mirror, no larger than a bowl, but to the Hu family it appeared as vast as the heavens. Looking into it, they saw no daylight. The mirror showed a scene like another world. First was a house, inside which lay a sick man. Nearby, a man and a woman whispered, plotting to poison him. The patient took their poison, jumped convulsively, and blood flowed from his seven orifices. The scene was horrifying beyond words. The house was the Lan family home. The patient was Lan Wen. The poisoners were none other than Hu herself and her brother Hu Qian. Lan Wen’s death was gruesome. Only the siblings saw it, and Hu Qian cleaned up all traces, so no one else suspected. But the mirror preserved a vivid painting of the murder, true to every detail. How could Hu not be terrified to death?

Seeing Hu faint, Tieguai smiled slightly and blew on her. She revived, understanding now, and tried not to look at the mirror again. Yet what she saw was all there—in the mirror, she could not tell if her body was inside or outside it. She saw how, after Lan Wen’s death, she seized power; how Hu Qian slandered; how they plotted against Caihe and her husband; how Lan Xiu discovered the truth and secretly sent word to Yueying; how Hu Qian framed Yueying; how the whole family erupted in chaos; how the young couple fled; how Hu Qian led a pursuit; how Caihe and Yueying ascended to immortality; and finally how Hu Qian was executed—then the mirror went blank.

To Hu, the mirror had shrunk to the size of a bowl. She was dazed and bewitched, staring wide-eyed at Tieguai. Tieguai then ordered Yueying, “Take her inside and ask if she is willing to repent and reform, to live rightly and commit no more evil. If she can perform much unseen merit and do many good deeds, Heaven will not close the door to her renewal. When her merit is complete, unexpected blessings will come.”

Yueying obeyed, helping Hu into an inner chamber and earnestly persuading her as instructed. Hu’s heart was suddenly enlightened. She stood up, ran outside, and knelt before Tieguai, pounding her head like a mortar pestle, weeping as she confessed, “I deeply repent my past faults and vow to do good. If I lie or falter…” She bit off more than half her little finger with a snap, blood pouring forth, pain piercing her heart, yet she struggled on, “…this body shall not die a good death, but be cut in two, like this finger.”

Having spoken, she fainted from the pain. Tieguai rejoiced at her resolve, nodding in approval: “If one can be like this, even great crimes can be redeemed.” He blew on her again; she sprang up, her bleeding stopped. Tieguai comforted her gently. Hu kept the severed finger, saying, “I will look at it every day, so I do not forget and repeat my old ways.”

Only a few present understood the full meaning of this drama. The Lan household servants and Hu’s children saw nothing amiss. Even the many illusions in the mirror were invisible to them. When Hu bit off her finger, the crowd was amazed and fearful.

Tieguai explained that the mirror’s power was akin to his gourd’s. Both contained a portion of his spirit. When the dao is deep, the soul can roam beyond Heaven and Earth, revealing events of a thousand years past or future with perfect clarity. This method was later passed down by Yang Ren, but with less power, relying on talismans and incantations instead of soul travel, showing only faint images. Used to investigate cases and track bandits, it remained effective for thousands of years, now called “Yuang Guang” (Perfect Light). Some charlatans exploit it for profit, losing its original purpose and weakening its efficacy. The learned disdain “Yuang Guang,” but the true failure lies with the frauds, not the method. It would be foolish to dismiss it altogether because of such mischief. In recent decades, Western philosophers, inspired by Tieguai, developed hypnotism—without talismans or mirrors—to discern truth of past and future, near and far. Yet the process is complicated, not everyone can perform it, and some lack the spirit to master it. The technique is new, and some unscrupulous people misuse it, fooling many into thinking hypnotism is like “Yuang Guang,” which is baseless. True hypnotists are rare; most imitate superficially and cannot claim scholarly understanding. In sum, this method originated with Tieguai. Yang Ren transmitted it; Western philosophers studied its principles. It all depends on the soul’s power—the “spirit’s abode” as Tieguai calls it. With his dao power and divine ability, he can instantly know events thousands of miles away, or calculate happenings centuries hence. No tools or procedures are needed. This is the mark of a true immortal, the real mastery of transcendence—beyond what Western philosophers or Yang Ren could imagine.

Putting aside such digressions, now to the matter at hand: Tieguai finished dealing with the Lan household and, with He Xiangu and Yueying, once again mounted the clouds, heading straight to Haining, to the temple of Master Xuan Zhuzi. Since taking office, Xuan Zhu had shown many spiritual responses, so incense offerings flourished like none other. Hearing of Tieguai’s arrival, he hurried out to greet him. The two immortals met with great joy and laughter, joining hands to enter the temple. Tieguai instructed He Xiangu and Yueying to pay respects and express their admiration. Xuan Zhu asked about Tieguai’s travels, and Tieguai inquired about the dragon’s guarding of the land. He told of the old dragon’s journey southward. Xuan Zhu sighed, “Unless this beast is eliminated, Zhejiang’s troubles will not end. Though I have worked with the Dragon King to block its paths, this demon’s powers rival ours. I fear one slip, one flaw, and it will succeed. The fate of millions rests on me alone. I am but shallow in skill, yet bear this heavy burden. Each thought chills me to the bone. Brother Daoist, since you have not abandoned me and kindly come, surely you have something to teach me.”

Tieguai smiled, “You are too modest, brother. Though fierce, evil never triumphs over good. With your vigilance at the sea’s mouth and the help of the Ping couple, the old dragon has no chance. Even if misfortune strikes, it is fate’s decree, unavoidable. If you remain steadfast, diligent, and vigilant—not losing caution for a moment’s pleasure—then when the kalpa comes, it will not concern you.” Xuan Zhu agreed repeatedly but inwardly felt Tieguai’s words were somewhat perfunctory, as if brushing him off. His expression showed slight doubt. Tieguai, knowing this, pretended not to notice. That evening, Xuan Zhu prepared fresh fruits from Jiangnan and specialties from Yuezhong to entertain the three guests. The hosts and guests talked freely, enjoying themselves to the fullest.

The next day, Tieguai led He Xiangu and Yueying north to Zhongzhou. He smiled at Yueying, “I will teach you a little trick.” Yueying was puzzled. He Xiangu laughed, “Senior brother surely has a purpose. You just study hard and do not ask too much.” Tieguai chanted an incantation, had Yueying memorize it, then wrote the characters “hidden” and “manifest” on her palms, saying, “With this spell, you can transform into someone you wish to become. But it is not true dao and cannot last long—perhaps one or two days at most. The characters on your palms are talismans for hiding and revealing your body. To hide, raise your left hand upward; no one will see you. To reveal, cover downward with your right hand, and your form appears immediately. This is a mere trick, not a proper immortal art. True transformation and invisibility require genuine power, infinite change, and no talismans. But you are just beginning your path; such skills are not yet within reach. Also, these tricks are not orthodox cultivation. When your great dao is complete, you will need no practice; it will come naturally. To learn superficial arts first is to abandon the root and chase the branch, dividing your heart and harming your spirit. This must never be done. What I teach today is not truly a trick, but you should regard it as a playful thing, not obsess over it lest you invite outside demons. Do you understand why I teach you this?”

Yueying hesitated, “I am confused. Master says to seek dao, not arts, lest one’s heart be divided. Why then teach me a talisman spell, lower than even arts, and repeatedly warn me to treat it as mere play? I feel my foundation is weak, my learning nil—surely this is not the time for tricks. Am I not risking dividing my heart for the dao? I am ignorant; please instruct me clearly.” Tieguai was pleased with her grasp of the principle and her integrity, praising her before saying, “This is for Caihe’s sake, and also for you. I have great confidence in you, but I cannot yet be sure of Caihe’s resolve. I want to test him a few times, not only to examine his sincerity. If he truly has destiny, this test will strengthen his resolve. If he ascends early, so can you. Your wishes and Caihe’s are like mine and He Xiangu’s—she will not become immortal until I do. She works diligently, rising early and resting late. In her study of life and nature, she is already seven or eight parts complete. Soon she will bear fruit. Though I have waited centuries, she has not disappointed me. I hope Caihe will also work hard for you, so you may have less worry and I great comfort.”

Yueying still did not fully understand. Tieguai smiled and sighed, “Such a clever child, yet this small matter escapes you—surely a moment’s confusion?” He Xiangu said, “Do not fret. I understand senior brother’s meaning; I will tell you.” Hearing this, Yueying suddenly realized and laughed, “Truly I am not clever enough. Master’s meaning is to have me transform and test Caihe, is it not?” The two immortals laughed heartily, “So you understand now?” Tieguai reminded her carefully to follow the plan exactly, so as to reveal Caihe’s true heart. Yueying obeyed.

Looking down, Tieguai pointed to a village below, “This is already the territory of Yuzhou, south of the Yellow River. I expect Caihe will come here tonight to lodge. He is still on the road. He Xiangu and I will go first to scare him a bit, see if he has courage. When he reaches the village, you follow my plan exactly—no mistakes.”

They descended on a small earth temple, startling the local earth god, who hurried out to welcome the immortals. Tieguai comforted him and explained their purpose, asking him to look after Yueying, who was young and inexperienced. Yueying waited in the temple for Caihe. Tieguai and He Xiangu left again, using the earth-shrinking technique to reach a hillside ten li away. Tieguai pointed to a forest opposite and said, “There, walking slowly through the woods, is Caihe. The wilderness is empty now; see how he looks around, surely seeking someone to ask the way. Sister, you should act quickly and lure him here.”

He Xiangu smiled, turned, and transformed into an old white-haired woman, approaching Caihe.

Caihe, lost as dusk fell, eager to find someone to ask directions, saw the old woman and was greatly relieved. He hurried forward with a greeting, “I am a humble Daoist on my way to Wangwu Mountain. I hurried and missed my meal. Please, grandmother, tell me where the main road is and where I might lodge.”

He Xiangu pointed back, “Go that way, around the hillside, then travel five or six li more. There is a village where you can stay.”

Caihe thanked her and quickened his pace. The sun was setting, the sky dimming. The more anxious he grew, the faster he walked. Yet the hill remained distant; he could not catch up.

He laughed and scolded himself, “Impatience always does this. The road’s length is fixed; it cannot suddenly grow longer or shorter. It must be my heart making the journey feel slower.” Yet the road was strange indeed—though the distance was short, it took him half an hour to walk it. As dusk deepened, half an hour more meant nightfall.

At the foot of the hill, weary, he fretted, “The old woman said after the hill there are six or seven li to the village. Now it is dark; the path is hard to see; I am exhausted. How can I make it? The mountain is not very high, but peaks overlap. There may be tigers, wolves, or bandits lurking. Without a weapon, I cannot defend myself. Weak as I am, escape would be difficult. What shall I do?”

After a moment’s thought, knowing sitting still was no solution, he gathered courage to press on. Just as he prepared to round the hill, the trees rustled wildly in the wind. A fierce gale chilled him to the bone. Looking up at the mountain, he saw two enormous red lanterns flashing light amid the woods. Doubt filled his heart: “No one lives here. How can there be such big lanterns? I did not see them before. Who hung them? What use are they here?” Thinking this, he looked again. Seeing clearly, he could not help but shout and fell to the ground in fright.

Why Caihe feared these red lanterns will be revealed in the next chapter.
