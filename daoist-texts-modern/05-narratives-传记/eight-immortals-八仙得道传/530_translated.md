# Chapter Sixty-Two: A Great Python Clings Between Two Mountains, Splitting the Mountain to Forge a Path; Alone He Seeks the Great Dao, Willing to Sacrifice Life for the Way

Now it happened that Caihe, upon seeing atop the high mountain two blazing red lights suddenly appear, was filled with astonishment. He could not help but raise his head to gaze, and only then did he clearly discern that these were not red lanterns at all, but rather a colossal serpent, unmatched in size and length. The red lights he saw were its eyes. Its head was larger than a bushel basket, its girth ten times around, its length stretching ten li. Its head rested on this mountain, its belly on the opposite peak, spanning roughly five li between. 

Caihe, having read since childhood, had once heard tales of a loach over ten zhang long, swallowing a fat pig whole. At the time, it was a marvel that kept him awake at night in fear. Yet today, what he beheld was far more absurd and beyond belief—surpassing even that loach devouring a pig. No wonder he was so terrified that he fell to the ground in shock. Fortunately, having already resolved to seek immortality, he had long cast aside concern for life and death; thus his courage was a hundredfold stronger than usual. After steadying his heart, he sprang to his feet and shouted to himself, “Caihe, Caihe, you who seek immortality and pursue the dao, do not speak of ten li length or tenfold girth. Even if it were a tiny little earthworm, or a true dragon covering sky and earth, overturning seas and rivers, you should not fear it so! Go, go! It does its business, I’ll go mine. What is there to fear?”

He set his large strides forward, pressing onward. Yet still, in his heart, he could not help but think of that tiny little earthworm. His small heart thumped wildly, uncontrollably, but at the same time he scolded himself, saying, “Do not think of it, do not think of it; to think of it is not the mark of a true man.” Yet though he spoke thus, his little square inch of mind would not obey, spinning round and round with fearful and confused thoughts. With such thoughts, even his legs would not obey his command. Though he walked forward, his steps were faltering and awkward, utterly uncomfortable.

As he struggled desperately onward, the two great lights on the mountain seemed to know his direction. Suddenly they turned and shone directly upon him, like twin torches of lightning, accompanied by a rank, foul stench that pierced his nostrils in waves. This was not the worst. The monstrous creature, as if bent on opposing him, suddenly lunged forward with its massive head. A thunderous crash echoed through the air as a great bulk stretched across half the sky, its enormous head resting on a giant ancient tree branch some ten zhang from Caihe’s body.

Caihe was already faint with fright, unable to examine where the tail lay on the other mountain. But he saw the massive tree, its trunk and branches swaying violently, as if about to snap—testament to the serpent’s power. At that moment, Caihe was clearly beneath the serpent’s neck, its body less than one and a half zhangs above the ground. With just a slight stretch, it could crush him to death. A mere sneeze or body tremor could hurl him miles away. More terrifying still, the serpent’s eyes faced forward, as if intent on traveling the same path as Caihe. Truly, the only way was to retreat quickly; to press forward meant certain death in the serpent’s belly.

Recovering his wits, Caihe pondered deeply. In this dire strait, to preserve his life, he resolved to retreat for now, seeking a flatter, broader place to sit through the night and reconsider at dawn. Yet just as this thought arose, he vividly recalled the bold words he spoke at Mount Tai. Though his master and Yueying were not present, since he had boasted so grandly, and the road ahead was fraught with danger, to retreat at the first peril would offend his master, invite ridicule from Yueying and Yang Ren, and halt his progress on the dao forever. Moreover, life and death are truly decreed by Heaven’s mandate. If fate decreed a violent death, even retreat would not save him; the serpent might turn and pursue. His small body was but a morsel to it. Or if not the serpent, wild beasts or bandits might end his life. But if fate allowed survival and the hope of becoming immortal remained, then he would dash beneath the serpent’s body, moving quietly without disturbing it. Would such a great beast truly miss a tiny morsel like him?

With this thought, his courage swelled. Then, with a childlike fancy, he resolved to test his own cultivation by offering his body as trial. He raised his hands to Heaven, solemnly praying, “Disciple Lan Caihe is resolved to cultivate immortality, unafraid of danger. If the great dao is to be fulfilled and ascension hoped for, may I safely pass this little earthworm’s trial. If the path is hopeless, then my efforts are in vain. All mortals must die; death is death, what difference is there? Early death or late death is no reason to fear. I beseech the spirits to show their will, and command the earthworm lord to swallow me whole. I will dwell within its belly as a tiny worm, with no complaint.”

Having spoken, he lowered his hands, steadied his heart, and strode boldly forward. After a few steps—ah, disaster! The earthworm was no longer courteous. Whether it yawned or stretched, a dark mass fell across the path from midair. Its head still on the tree, tail still on the mountain, the great middle section lay sprawled across the ground, blocking Caihe’s way.

This sight shrank Caihe’s courage to smaller than a soybean. He trembled uncontrollably, crying out, “Heavens, heavens! Is it truly hopeless for me to cultivate immortality, destined to become a worm in the earthworm’s belly? Then why did my master lead me here to die in vain? If they wished me dead, why rescue me from the evil uncle’s hands? Master, you are truly a trickster!”

He wept a while, then looked again at the serpent’s body, which did not move much, and saw no other obstacle behind. Retreat was still possible. But Caihe, considering himself a cultivator, must practice self-restraint and solitude. Though life hung by a thread, he would keep his vow and not retreat. He resolved to find a way to pass beneath the serpent’s body.

By now, darkness had fallen, and no lights shone in the wilds. The only guide was the so-called earthworm lord’s pair of great red eyes. As mentioned, the serpent’s eyes faced forward, moving in tandem with Caihe. These twin flashes of light illuminated the path ahead clearly. Bored and restless, Caihe’s childish mind conceived a thought: “If only I could become brothers with this earthworm lord, I might rely on its light to guide me to the village. How wonderful that would be!” But he knew this was childish fancy, too good to be true.

After a long pause, the serpent moved slightly, frightening the birds on branches above to scatter in flight. Naturally, Caihe was terrified to death. He crouched low, prepared to sacrifice himself in its belly.

Sure enough, after the slight movement, the serpent stirred fully. A sudden fierce wind arose, shaking trees and swirling dust and stones, some striking Caihe’s head with bruises. Fearful beyond measure, he paid no heed to pain.

Unexpectedly, the creature leapt into the air, rising over ten zhang high. Caihe then saw its full form, smaller than the heavenly dragons he had imagined. His hope for survival surged anew. Silently praying for Heaven’s protection, he stretched out a hand, wishing to pull the serpent skyward and escape. To flee now would be a sign of future success in the dao. Yet the serpent soared freely, unrestrained by any heavenly hand, then gracefully descended. Its two red eyes no longer shone east or west, but fixed solely on Caihe. Clearly, the worm in its belly recognized Caihe as a new companion.

This fright was worse than the first. Beyond surrendering to being devoured, he had no hope. Suddenly, as the serpent neared the ground, it leapt forcefully between the two mountains, cleaving a great path through the peaks. This path led straight to the mountain village ahead.

For centuries, this mountain road remained passable. The elders called it the Divine Python Pass. The village at the mountain’s mouth took the name Python Roaming Pass. But after the Tang and Song dynasties, the pass grew deserted, taken over by demons, and sealed by Lü Chunyang with a single pellet of earth, closing the route. Even so, locals still know the name and the story. But that is a tale for another time.

Meanwhile, the serpent, trapped between the two mountains, could barely move. Frustrated, it thrashed wildly, shaking the mountains, stones, and trees to their limits. If it fell, Caihe below would surely perish beneath rock and serpent alike. Yet he cared not, believing that while the serpent’s body was stuck, if he moved swiftly, he might escape.

The serpent’s body, caught between the mountains, twisted and collided fiercely, its black eyes widening, its light growing fiercer than before.

Caihe had no time to watch. Seizing the chance, he hoped to flee the danger, whether by fortune or sign of immortality. Summoning all his spirit and courage, he examined the serpent’s body carefully. He dared not look back at its eyes, fearing their fierce aura would freeze his courage. Judging the serpent’s girth, he decided that leaping over its body would save much effort. Otherwise, he would have to find another path around the serpent’s head, adding three or five more li. The serpent’s eyes were too bright; if it overturned the hillside and twisted its body to chase, the chance would be lost.

After careful thought, there was no choice but to risk the leap. A child’s mind, simple and single-minded, made the plan without hesitation. He gathered his robe, closed his eyes, and with all his strength leapt forward, landing squarely on the serpent’s belly.

The serpent’s body was slippery; he could not stand firm and slipped, falling to the side path. The serpent seemed to feel the touch, humming a few low sounds from its head. The foul stench was unbearable. Though earlier he had smelled it, urgency to escape had dulled his senses. Now, safe but with senses clear, the stench overwhelmed him. He felt nausea and vomited much food, his body weakening, consciousness fading. Courage was gone; he could not take another step. He lay faint beside the serpent’s belly, unconscious.

The serpent, seeing its morsel still near, leapt upward, freeing its body from the mountain crevice. It swung its tail from west to southeast, stirring sudden fierce winds and thunderous roars.

Countless ancient trees were felled and broken, life endangered. But Caihe, small and weak, lay under the watchful eyes of the two great red orbs, drooling two streams that fell into a low hollow, instantly forming a tiny lake. The unconscious Caihe soaked in the pool, drenched through. The stench now was far worse than before, as if containing a biting poison. Yet this fierce odor revived the dying Caihe from the gates of death.

Opening his eyes, he saw the serpent still relentlessly pursuing him. He did not know whence the slick, cold water flowed. After some thought, his courage and strength failed. He felt all hope lost, and the serpent’s gaping maw slowly closed in on him. In a flash, he faced the prophecy of becoming a worm in the serpent’s belly.

He sighed deeply, calling out to his master and Yueying: “I always hoped to succeed on the dao and hear your teachings again. Who knew I would lose my life before reaching Wangwu, wasting your kind hopes.” Watching the serpent’s mouth open and close, nearing him, he opened his small eyes and saw it nodding, saying, “Good fellow, I planned long ago to make you my snack. I only regret being too small to fill your noble belly. Truly, I am sorry.”

Before the words ended, the serpent’s mouth hovered over his head. A blood-red tongue, over three chi long, licked his tender face, dripping streams of saliva like twin waterfalls pouring from the mountain. The low ground could not contain it, and water overflowed onto the plain. Poor Caihe was completely submerged.

Night was deep and all was silent. Apart from Caihe and the serpent, no other living thing stirred. Only the two red eyes shone; no other light existed. The wind howled, water moaned—a desolate scene, as if pitying this pure, innocent boy doomed to die in the serpent’s belly. As the serpent’s tongue neared his face, Caihe felt his courage vanish, his senses fade, yet no sorrow.

Dear readers, you are compassionate souls. Close your eyes and imagine Caihe’s plight. Surely you would sigh thrice and shed a handful of tears. Yet the author urges you: though you may weep and sigh again and again, do not abandon this book. Have you not heard the ancient sayings: “From utter despair comes life; from calamity, transformation”? Though Caihe’s danger was dire, know that some parts are crafted by the author’s cunning to awaken drowsy readers. After all, he is one of the Eight Immortals, protected by divine beings; death is not so easy for him.

If you doubt, pick up the book again and read on. At the moment of near death, a great voice thundered from midair: “Vile python, show respect! Swiftly deliver Caihe to the village earth temple. His merits shall offset his crimes.” Before the words ended, the serpent hummed in reply, withdrew its three-chi tongue into its blood-red mouth, and straightened its once-curving body into a line.

Caihe knew a deity had come to protect him and rejoiced, regaining clarity. Then he heard a voice from the sky: “Caihe is devoted to the dao, with resolve and measure, worthy and lovable. He should ride upon the python’s back; it will safely carry him to the village. Hesitate not.” Then silence.

Caihe heard the words but saw no divine form. He raised his hands to Heaven in reverence and lowered his head in thanks. Looking down, he saw the python lying on the ground, as if waiting to be mounted, calm and docile. No longer afraid, Caihe leapt up and grasped the serpent’s body. It was icy cold and slick, uncomfortable to hold. Just as doubt arose, the python began to glide swiftly, faster than an arrow and steadier than a boat, through tangled vines. The only sound was the rustling of leaves.

In no time, the python halted and lifted its head, nodding to Caihe. Looking ahead, Caihe saw they had arrived at the earth temple indicated by the deity. Hastily, he dismounted, bowed deeply to the serpent, and stroked its body, saying, “Dao friend, thanks for carrying me here. Pity your body is so cold. When I have fortune, I will surely make you a cotton robe.”

The python nodded again, then turned and swam back along the path. Perhaps ashamed of its clumsy bulk, fearing it might harm more creatures or frighten Caihe if it turned suddenly.

Watching it go, Caihe saw dawn break. Exhausted beyond words, he approached the temple door and knocked gently. After a while, the mountain gate slowly opened, and out stepped a peerless beauty of thousand charms, a woman of incomparable grace. Caihe gazed, stunned.

Why Caihe was so dazed—was it the allure of her beauty? The next chapter will reveal all.
