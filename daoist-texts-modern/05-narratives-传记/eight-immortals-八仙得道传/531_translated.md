# Chapter Sixty-Three: The Earth Temple’s Profound Discourse on Mysteries — The Tender Enchantment Entices the Daoist Youth

Now it happened that Caihe, amid extreme hardship and peril, was rescued by an immortal’s timely aid, who in turn commanded a great python to escort him to the Earth Temple. At that moment, dawn was breaking, and Caihe felt both weary and famished, utterly spent. Hastily, he approached the mountain gate of the Earth Temple and knocked.

To his surprise, the one who opened the gate was a maiden of peerless beauty, her radiance natural and her form full and graceful. Taken aback, Caihe stood momentarily stunned, then quickly raised his hands in salute and inquired if the young lady was a permanent resident of the temple. “I am but a humble Daoist who, pressed by haste, met with misfortune on the road. By the grace of the exalted immortal, I escaped danger and arrived here, hoping to rest briefly at your honorable place, offering incense and tribute. Might the young lady permit this?”

Seeing his disheveled and pitiful state, the maiden’s heart softened with compassion. Smiling gently, she replied, “A recluse makes home wherever he roams, much less in a temple’s shelter. How could you not be allowed to stay? Though the abbot is absent, I am kin to him in the mundane world and may act as host. Daoist, please do not stand on ceremony—come inside and accept some tea.”

Relieved, Caihe thanked her and followed the maiden through the gate. Inside was a small guest hall, where she invited him to sit and called to a Daoist nun to brew fine tea. She added, “You have traveled far and must be very hungry. This place is remote and poor, so I have nothing but homemade noodles from my family kitchen. Might you partake?”

At that moment, Caihe’s stomach rumbled like thunder, and though shy to speak, her words blossomed joyfully in his heart. He hastened to rise and express thanks. The maiden smiled and bade the nun quickly bring two bowls of noodles. Obediently, the nun returned shortly, bearing two large bowls steaming with fragrant vegetarian noodles.

The worms in Caihe’s belly, drawn by the aroma, stirred into a riotous uproar. No longer able to hold back, he accepted a bowl, said “Please,” and lifted his chopsticks to eat. The maiden, seeing his hunger, sighed and smiled, saying, “There are no outsiders here, Daoist, so please eat freely without reserve.” Sitting beside him, she ate as well, all the while inquiring about Caihe’s journey. He answered her questions one by one.

As she listened, a trace of surprise flickered in her eyes. When he finished the noodles, she smiled and said, “Daoist, forgive my bluntness. A youth of your noble birth and prime age—why would you not seek to study and advance, to serve as official or magistrate, to enjoy the worldly splendors of life? Why flee the world, courting death and hardship? Could there truly be immortals? Can one really become immortal at will?”

Before she finished, Caihe laughed and replied, “It seems, young lady, that though you dwell in a temple, you do not truly believe in the dao. Your words are those of an outsider. Immortals are made by mortals; there is no reason why one who strives for the dao cannot become immortal. As for whether immortals exist, others may doubt, but I am one hundred and twenty percent certain they do. This is not mere theory—I have witnessed immortal wonders more than once. Take my own master, a true immortal of the upper realms; and last night, the one who rebuked the great python in the sky to save me was surely an immortal. Otherwise, how could such power compel such a fierce, dull beast to bow and obey?”

He then recounted many strange events from his past to the maiden. At last, he spoke earnestly: “To be frank, I was once deeply worldly, with no dao in my heart. I too dreamed of official rank, wealth, and worldly glory. But after several calamities, I realized that no matter how rich or honored one is, it all passes like smoke and clouds—gone in a blink. Guided by my immortal master and friends, I came to know that immortals truly exist, and that they are all mortals who cultivated to transcendence. With this insight, I awakened fully, seeing that fleeting glory cannot compare to eternal blessing. To lose everlasting happiness for momentary gain is a poor bargain. So I resolved to abandon all, obey my master’s command, and endure hardship to seek the immortal dao. If I perish on the way, or am devoured by beasts, it is but death—no different than the death of nobles or commoners. Whether one dies peacefully or is buried in a beast’s belly, it is the same. From the immortal’s view, who lives a hundred years or dies in infancy is no great difference. Since I have seen this truth, I no longer covet wealth or status, nor do I care for lifespan or manner of death. I focus solely on the path to the great dao. Whether I succeed or fail is fate, beyond human power, so why fret? Therefore, when you ask if immortals exist and if mortals can become immortals, I not only affirm their existence but insist they are made by mortals. Even if immortals did not exist, or mortal cultivation was uncertain, I would not care or even think on it. Moreover, all who cultivate must have such resolute will and grand perseverance to hope for immortality. Those who become Daoists today and tomorrow expect instant enlightenment, then dream of soaring clouds, eternal youth, and endless joy—how are they different from common folk chasing rank and wealth? Such people only invite suffering without achievement.”

The maiden listened, then suddenly raised her head to look at Caihe, her face showing a pleased and comforting expression, though still faintly smiling. She said, “In my view, life is short precisely because it is too short. One should hurry to seek present joys before impermanence arrives and it is too late. As for cultivation of immortality, it is too absurd—only to fool fools. The slightly wiser cannot believe it. Daoist, consider how many sages and heroes of old, brilliant beyond compare, surely desired immortality and carefree life beyond the world. Yet why do we hear of them serving kings and countries, governing wisely and bringing peace? Are they all fools, unaware that mortals can become immortals?”

Caihe answered solemnly, “Young lady, your words err. There are three teachings in the world: Confucianism, Buddhism, and Daoism. Confucianism flourishes in the central lands; Buddhism arises in the West; but Daoism predates both, though less widespread, it is older. Your question about sages not cultivating immortality seems reasonable but shows little understanding of the origins and aims of the three teachings. Though different in approach, all seek to benefit people and nation. We Daoists, though far from attainment, cultivate both personal merit and widespread good deeds, building a firm foundation to advance gradually. The more merit and good connections, the greater the achievement. How is this different from Confucianism and Buddhism? Each has its own cultivation methods and joys. Do not think sages live as long as ordinary people. Like tools, bodies of saints and commoners alike are fragile and short-lived. But the sage’s spirit is like that of immortals—eternal and indestructible. Likewise, though some Daoists ascend bodily, most shed their flesh and ascend in spirit. You are wise; do you see how the three teachings stand like three pillars, different roads but one path? Confucians have their way and need not do our work, just as we have our own path and do not imitate them.”

The maiden laughed aloud, “Here we go again! If there is a way to immortality beyond cultivation, why must one become a Daoist?” Caihe was momentarily stunned, then laughed and said, “If cultivation leads to immortality, why turn to Confucianism or Buddhism? Each teaching values single-minded perseverance. If, as you say, one can return to the family and worldly affairs after becoming a Daoist, how could Daoism forbid it, or the others accept it?”

By now Caihe was growing impatient with the maiden’s persistent argument. Yet she would not relent, continuing to engage him. Caihe, amused and vexed, glanced out the window at the high red sun and the morning breeze entering the room. Though nourished and refreshed by food, he felt no fatigue, but wishing to leave the maiden’s presence, he said, “You have kindly allowed me temporary shelter. After a night of hardship, I find myself unable to endure longer. I beg you to grant me leave to rest briefly so as not to delay my journey.”

The maiden seemed skeptical of his fatigue, smiling with a hint of irony: “My noodles are unlike common fare. Some who eat them find great nourishment, even healing and longevity if taken daily. How can you eat such a large bowl and still speak of weariness? It is not lack of blessing but weakness of body, wasting such tonic. It seems your hope for immortality is utterly hopeless. Perhaps your talk of death by beast’s belly is nearly true.”

She smiled sweetly, glanced sideways at Caihe, and said, “I speak with a sincere heart, but you heed none of it, arrogantly clever and full of nonsense. Such a fool I have never met.” Her brows knitted in a mingling of grievance and sorrow, her charm deepening with a tender melancholy. Anyone but a heart of stone would feel moved. Yet Caihe, one in a thousand with a steely countenance, neither accepted her warmth nor welcomed her concern, finding it strange and frightening. He quickly lowered his head, silent and avoiding her gaze.

At that moment, the attending Daoist nun stood nearby, smiling and said, “This Daoist does not seem a poor recluse but a noble gentleman. Our young lady is but eighteen, with rare beauty and virtue that even heavenly immortals may not surpass. Our late master once served as a high official in Chu, a family of great standing. Last night, he dreamt and told the young lady, ‘Tomorrow a young Daoist will come seeking shelter. He is destined to be your match; keep him and wed him.’ So she rose early to await you. When you arrived at the gate, it was clearly a heaven-sent fate without error. That is why she urges you not to become a Daoist. Think, where else could you find such a lady? Many noble sons have come seeking her hand, but she accepted none. Today she favors you. Such fortune is rare. I think you should lay aside your Daoist robes, don Confucian garb, and wed here. If you wish to cultivate immortality, enjoy twenty or thirty years of conjugal bliss first, then work together with one heart. When the mortal mind is pure, ascension will come. Cultivating as a couple is lively and strong, far better than wandering alone through mountains and dangers. Please consider well.”

Caihe laughed heartily, “So it is! You and your mistress do not truly wish to shelter a guest but to follow your master’s dream and lure this Daoist into your maiden’s fragrant realm to become husband and wife again. Though I appreciate your mistress’s kindness and your master’s favor, I am unworthy. I have long since cast aside body and life. Even if a heavenly immortal descended to wed me, I could not accept. Please have your mistress look wisely and find a match of equal rank and talent. Forgive my stubbornness and failure to appreciate your kindness.”

Before he finished, the maiden burst into tears, weeping bitterly upon the table. Caihe felt pity for her but was helpless. Hardening his heart, he apologized repeatedly and sought the nun’s help to take him to a guest room to rest. The nun, seeming angry at his firmness, said sternly, “Sir, do you doubt my words? Our late master even named you in detail in his dream. If you do not believe me, let me tell you one by one. Your surname is Lan, your given name Caihe, from such and such village. You suffered abuse from your stepmother, quarreled with your wife, left home, and both of you attempted drowning…”

The nun recounted Caihe’s past in such detail it was as if she had witnessed it herself. Caihe was stunned, speechless. When she mentioned the drowning, a thought struck him: “No mere ghost could know my family’s affairs. Could this young lady be a demon in disguise, sent to tempt me? If so, I have no choice but to die. But since she shows no change of face, I, powerless, will not seek her out.” He begged the nun, “I have sworn before my master a deadly curse: if I fail to attain the dao, such and such shall befall me. I cannot accept your mistress’s affection. Though I will always remember your late master’s kindness and strive to repay it if I progress, I cannot heed your words now. Please do not speak further.”

The nun smiled faintly, “Strange indeed. Nowadays many young people suddenly wish to become Daoists. Not long ago, a certain gentleman sought the great dao but met bandits and was slain before attainment. Now another fool comes, discarding such good fortune to walk a path of ruin. Truly strange.”

The maiden said nothing, only bowed her head in silent sorrow, tears shining as if overwhelmed. When the nun finished, the maiden softly scolded her, “He does not want me; why keep speaking? Take him to rest; no more words.” Then she sat quietly, her eyes moist and almost tearful. Suddenly she looked at Caihe once more, then lowered her head, neck bowed to her chest, unable to raise it again. Caihe clearly heard her choking sobs, her sorrowful yet tender expression stirring deep pity. Even he felt a surge of compassion but knew there was no comfort to offer. He thanked her and rose hurriedly, following the nun to the west wing.

There, a chamber was prepared, with a clean, exquisite, fragrant bed. The nun whispered, “See, this is our young lady’s embroidered couch. She is so fond of cleanliness she would not share her own bedding with just anyone. If you were not born of iron heart, would you not relent?”

Caihe replied, “I dare not disrespect the young lady. Please find another room; a simple straw mat will suffice. As a novice on the dao, I cannot bear to waste others’ goods and increase my sins.” Saying this, he moved toward the door.

The nun laughed and pulled him back, “Where would you go? This is a lonely temple with few rooms. Besides this newly prepared guest room, where else is there? If so, you might as well nap in the hall. The young lady’s chamber is no place for careless disrespect.”

Caihe said, “Then I shall rest in the hall. How could I be rude in a lady’s room?”

The nun’s face twisted awkwardly; she sneered, “You make things difficult. We have prepared a bed for you, yet you have many reasons. As a guest, you should not suffer. Even we locals would not sleep on such a crude mat. Napping in the hall is out of the question. If the abbot learns of this, he will not allow it. I advise you to accept this day’s blessing. The heavens may not dispatch the karmic officials to drag you to hell. If you are easygoing, sparing us some trouble, it may count as merit. Those destined to become immortals in a hundred years, if they achieve it at ninety-nine and a half, have gained half a year’s grace.”

With that, she laughed coldly and pushed Caihe onto the soft embroidered couch. He felt as if struck by a thousand pounds, while the nun moved as lightly as a reed, revealing her immense spiritual power. Fearful and startled, Caihe knew he could not contend with her. He resolved to plead softly.

Just as he settled to speak, the nun lifted him again, laid him on the bed, covered him with the quilt, smiled, and said, “Forgive me; I must leave now.” Shaking her head, she laughed, “Indeed, I am no companion for you. Your companion will soon arrive. Do not look so stern at others.” Saying this, she left.

With a click, the door shut and locked. No matter how loudly Caihe called, no one answered. He recalled the nun’s last words and wondered: could this young lady truly cast aside shame to offer herself? If so, how could he respond? If the nun intervened should he resist, forcing him to break his vow, he saw only death as escape.

Lost in such thoughts, suddenly he awakened to a soft voice outside: “Has this gentleman fallen asleep?” Startled, Caihe’s heart stirred.

Who was this visitor? The answer awaits in the next chapter.
