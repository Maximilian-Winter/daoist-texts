# Chapter Sixty-Four: Wang Yueying’s Scheme to Spy on the Mortar; Dongfang Shuo’s Cunning Theft of the Peaches of Immortality

Now, when Cai He awoke from a dream, it was already midday. From his ears came the sound of a woman’s voice. Pushing open the door, his heart leapt in alarm, and suddenly he was fully awake, hastily sitting up. The woman had already come close to the bedside and lifted the curtain. Only then did Cai He recognize her—it was the young lady he had spoken with that very morning. Instantly recalling her words, he grew even more flustered and paid her no heed. The young lady, however, asked boldly and plainly, “Young master, you have awakened. Would you like some refreshments before returning to rest?” Cai He hurried to swing his legs over the bed, but she pressed a hand gently upon him and smiled shyly, “Why do you treat me with such coldness? We are but strangers who have met by chance. Since the ancestors have shown the dream, it is clearly Heaven’s decree of a good match. Why persist in stubborn refusal? Have you not heard that even immortals sometimes take spouses?”

Cai He hastened to shake his head, “Please do not mention such things again; it brings me great shame. You are a celestial being, surely with noble sons and talented heroes to be your lifelong companions. How could you entangle yourself with a humble Daoist like me?”

Hearing this, the woman’s face blushed like a peach blossom, her shyness evident. She answered, “Young master, do not mistake me for some lowly wanton. My father is a renowned minister at court, and my mother comes from an illustrious family. Though I am humble, in my youth I received proper instruction in the classics, poetry, and needlework—I understand all such matters. How could I imitate base women, courting suspicion by seeking out a strange man? It is only because my late father’s dream was so clear that it may serve as my parents’ arrangement. And since you will depart this very day, this precious match, once missed, may never be reunited. For this reason, I cast aside shame and hesitation, coming to see you while the temple is empty, earnestly hoping you will consent to this union, so that I may have a settled life and bring comfort to my late parents in the underworld. Can you, young master, pity my plight and graciously grant this favor?”

As she spoke, Cai He watched her expressions and movements closely. She was not frivolous, yet his heart grew ever more suspicious. Unable to rise from bed and unwilling to respond to her questions, he closed his eyes tightly, composed himself, and sat upright in solemn silence.

Sensing her lack of success, the woman sighed softly and withdrew quietly, closing the door behind her. Cai He knew shouting would be useless, so he laid down again to sleep. Yet his heart was in turmoil, and he could not enter dreamland. No matter how he tried to restrain himself, it was to no avail. Unconsciously, anger welled up, and he clenched his teeth with a grinding sound. He cried aloud, “Lan Caihe, Lan Caihe, you boasted so boldly before your master, yet now, at the very first step of cultivation, such tribulation arises. If I secretly stir my heart, not only will I fail to see my master, wife, and companions, but I fear falling into hell, never to rise again. At this crucial moment, I must risk my life and fight with all I have!”

After a while, he thought he heard a woman’s laughter in the room, which made him suspicious. Looking around, he saw no one. He decided he must have misheard and let it go.

He then gathered his primordial power and sat in meditation once more. After some time, his mind settled. Suddenly, he heard a commotion outside. Listening carefully, he was greatly astonished. For he recognized a voice—it was unmistakably that of his wife, Wang Yueying. He pricked up his ears and listened intently. Indeed, it was Wang Yueying quarreling with the matchmaking woman. Cai He was deeply amazed. In such a remote village, how could Yueying have come here? Could it be that his master, knowing his plight, had specially sent her to rescue him? Thinking this, he tried to break open the door to meet her. At the door, he found it small but very solid. Shaking it with his hand, it did not budge an inch. He was struck with dismay. Outside, the voices grew closer, clearer with each word. He heard Yueying scolding the woman as a shameless wretch, daring to seduce another man’s husband. The woman would not yield, continuing to brawl foolishly. After a while, Yueying grew angry and drove the woman out with a flurry of fists and sword strikes. Then he heard a Taoist nun pleading with Yueying, who also sent her away. Cai He hoped Yueying would open the door so they could meet, but after waiting long, all grew silent outside. Growing anxious, he summoned all his strength to push the door and shouted Yueying’s name hoarsely. Yet no response came. Bewildered and frustrated, Cai He sat on the bed, unwilling to move further.

Soon evening fell, and hunger gnawed at his belly. Turning, he saw on the bedside table a large flatbread and a pot of water. Without further thought, he grabbed some bread and ate, drinking a few sips of water. Outside remained utterly quiet. Knowing shouting was useless, he resolved to sleep through the night. If no one came by morning, he would find a way to break through the window and escape. After finishing the bread, he sat in meditation for a while. Night darkened the sky. Climbing into bed, he fell asleep at once.

He awoke at dawn, hearing a voice say, “Young master, take care. The master has sent me to test your resolve. Fortunately, your determination is firm, and I have words to report to the master. We need not meet face to face, which would only disturb your heart. Go forth well; we shall meet again soon.” Cai He clearly recognized the voice as his wife Wang Yueying’s, yet no one was to be found. He smiled wryly, “Surely the master taught her some invisibility technique to tease me.”

Rising, he found the door wide open. Searching around, he saw no one. Cai He knew his master could test his heart and will at any time, and protection was always near. From then on, his resolve grew ever firmer, and he boldly pressed onward.

Before long, Cai He arrived atop Wangwu Mountain. Along the way, he endured countless hardships and dangers, yet passed safely through all. Upon reaching the mountain, he found a place to settle and quietly began his cultivation. At first, his food supply was not yet exhausted, though he worried that the high mountain and distant path would make gathering food difficult. Yet each morning, in his stone cave, he found a portion of dry food and fruit sufficient for the day’s nourishment. After half a year, the provisions gradually lessened but still sufficed to fill him.

Two years later, he completely ceased all cooked food, feeling his spirit grow ever brighter and his courage stronger. He could even go out to find wild fruits to quell hunger. Even without eating, he no longer felt hunger or thirst. From then on, every three years, Master Iron Crutch would send several disciples to Wangwu to inspect his progress and teach him some Daoist arts.

At that time, Zhongli Quan of Mount Taihua had completed reading the three scrolls of the Profound Scripture, and by the elder patriarch’s decree, passed them to Cai He. Centuries passed swiftly, spanning from the Western Han to the Eastern Han. On Mount Wudang, Zhang Guo received the Jade Purity Canon by invitation from Master Wenmei and the Primordial Lord.

He Xiangu was summoned by the Mysterious Lady and personally taught the essential Dao of the Primordial Gate, along with the Heavenly Escape Sword Technique. These immortals all possessed eight or nine parts of the dao’s accomplishment. Meanwhile, the human world was in the era of Emperor Ming of the Eastern Han. Ming himself was a reincarnation of a Buddhist disciple and first revered Buddhism. Thus officials and common people alike abandoned Confucian and Daoist teachings in favor of Buddhism. To prevent disciples from competing and quarreling, the Primordial Lord invited all major disciples, emperors, stellar deities, and all officials and wandering immortals to assemble at the Eight Views Palace. There, he expounded the principle that the Three Teachings share the same source. Though worldly powers wax and wane, this too is Heaven’s decree, and all should embrace the principle of benefiting others. Since others bear burdens, why seek personal merit? During these centuries, disciples were allowed to secretly aid Buddhism and jointly establish merit. Those who preferred quiet and disliked noise could cultivate on the mountains, avoiding the world’s affairs. The disciples accepted this decree and warned their own followers to observe it. Thus, from the Eastern Han onward, Confucian and Buddhist sects often attacked each other fiercely, but Daoists remained aloof, upheld by the edicts of two great patriarchs.

Now, let us speak of Dongfang Shuo. Also called Manqian, he was the reincarnation of the Wood Star. From childhood, he was tutored by a Daoist celestial official who descended to teach him various arts. Growing up, he mastered many skills, able to enter the netherworld and foresee the future. Emperor Wu, who favored the Dao, heard of his fame and appointed him Grand Minister of the Central Court. Dongfang Shuo was naturally witty and, though in court, was not bound by formalities. When meeting the emperor, he spoke freely and laughed at will, often making the solemn ruler smile broadly. The emperor, weary of courtly restraint, found delight in this jester’s company. Thus, the emperor did not rebuke him but favored him greatly for his frankness and charm.

It was said that the Queen Mother of the West once, moved by the emperor’s earnest desire for immortality, descended to the Han palace and discoursed on the supreme Dao for three days before departing. In truth, this was all a prank by Dongfang Shuo alone. Emperor Wu was ruthless in war and heavy in taxation, long incurring Heaven’s wrath and the people’s resentment. Though he spoke of the Dao, he could not move the trust of immortals. Moreover, as leader of the female immortals, the Queen Mother would never so lightly descend and dwell three days in his palace. Such conduct would be no different from mortals. The true story was otherwise. Knowing Dongfang Shuo could summon immortals, the emperor repeatedly ordered him to invite the Queen Mother. Dongfang Shuo, knowing the difficulty, was reluctant but dared not refuse due to courtly duty. Reporting the matter would be useless or might even provoke the Queen Mother’s rebuke. So, he devised a plan: he invited several fellow Daoist adepts to impersonate the Queen Mother and her attendants, complete with imperial carriage and celestial chariots, descending on clouds to lecture the emperor on the great Dao for three days.

Though entirely counterfeit, their words contained many profound truths. Had Emperor Wu followed even some advice, he might have gained Heaven’s favor, immense blessings, and become a sage king. His own merit would then have been considerable. Alas, though he feigned reverence, he had no true intent. The speakers urged earnestly, but the listener was drowsy and distracted. Such a scene would have disgusted the real Queen Mother, and even the impersonator grew weary and reluctant to stay the full three days. In truth, the emperor’s heart was no longer in such thoughts. A man of supreme wisdom, he naturally grasped ordinary principles without questioning. He had hoped the Queen Mother’s visit would bring novel insights to broaden his mind. Instead, the discourse was dull and ordinary. Simply put, his sole hope was a single pill of the elixir of immortality to grant him endless years as ruler. The Queen Mother was indeed invited and the immortals appeared. Yet during those three days, all they heard were common, tedious teachings, lacking any fresh or stirring wisdom. This was already hard enough to endure. The Queen Mother, unaware of the times, seeing his lack of interest, spoke of the supreme Dao as simply “the ordinary.” Because it is ordinary, it is close to human nature; anything strange would be a deviation. To true cultivators, these words hold infinite profundity and delight. But Emperor Wu grew ever more bored. Being clever, he suspected the Queen Mother was but a trick by Dongfang Shuo, who, unable to summon the real Queen Mother, had sent a celestial substitute to avoid angering the emperor. This emperor was one of China’s great rulers and would not be fooled lightly. Realizing this, his anger flared, and he summoned the eunuch to call Dongfang Shuo to court.

Dongfang Shuo was at home refining a pill when suddenly summoned. Sensing something unusual, he calculated the situation and knew the truth. Scratching his head in vexation, he obeyed the strict imperial command and hurried to the palace, having already resolved a plan.

Arriving, the emperor was not angry but smiled as usual, saying, “You brought the Queen Mother, who has taught me scriptures and health methods for days. I understand them now. But I heard the Queen Mother’s garden is richest with the Peaches of Immortality, which bloom once every five thousand years and bear fruit only after another five thousand. Each time fruit appears, the Queen Mother keeps many for gifts. Some peaches, unpicked for ten thousand years, remain fresh. A mortal who eats one will be cured of all ailments and live longer. At our first meeting, I did not dare ask her directly. Could you petition on my behalf for a few peaches?”

Dongfang Shuo did not expect the emperor to devise such a cunning test to probe the Queen Mother’s authenticity. If he refused or failed to obtain peaches, it would prove the Queen Mother false and he would be guilty of deceiving the sovereign. He had no choice but to promise compliance, replying, “The Queen Mother descended for three days and must return to the west today. I shall accompany her to the Jade Pool and beg for a few peaches to present to Your Majesty.” The emperor, seeing his consent, was unsure whether Dongfang Shuo was genuine or deceitful. Because of his desire for the peaches, he treated him with special favor.

That night, Dongfang Shuo met the Queen Mother and truly accompanied the divine carriage, ascending to the heavens. They arrived at an immortal mountain by the sea, where many wandering immortals were his comrades. Even the impersonator of the Queen Mother was among them. They discussed how to obtain the peaches. Some said, “A mortal emperor’s face is not small. Asking the Queen Mother for a few peaches is no great matter. We should ask her straightforwardly.” Others said, “The Han emperor is licentious and violent, no less than Qin’s tyranny. Though his ancestors’ virtue protects him from death and ruin, the Queen Mother is kind and dislikes such men. If we fail to get peaches, we cannot demand them. Moreover, the impersonation of the Queen Mother is not aboveboard. If the peach matter is pursued, it may alert the guards and bring trouble.” Hearing this, the immortals worried for Dongfang Shuo.

Yet Dongfang Shuo, clever and witty, was untroubled. Bowing his head, he devised a perfect plan, though he did not reveal it then. Parting from the immortals, he went straight to the Jade Pool.

Dear readers, can you guess his method? Ha! Other matters may be hard to divine, but the tale of Dongfang Shuo stealing peaches is a well-known ancient proverb. Even village children of three years roughly know something of it. Yet, as the matter is mysterious, no official history records it accurately, and popular tales differ widely. What is the truth? Not even the learned may fully understand.

By now, you likely know Dongfang Shuo went to the Jade Pool under imperial orders to obtain peaches. Though the name was grand, his means were cunning and secret. By chance, at that time, the Western Buddha was preparing to transmit the Dharma to the Eastern lands, first expounding Buddhist mysteries. Besides the assembled immortals and mortals attending the lecture, other high immortals were invited in advance. The Queen Mother, as leader of the immortals, naturally cared deeply and went with the Primordial Lord and great emperors and golden immortals to the Western lands. Thus the Jade Pool lay quiet and its garden less strictly guarded, with only one great guardian deity and a few immortal children watching. The Queen Mother was kind and lenient, and with the host away, the children naturally sought their own amusements. The guardian deity was old and timid. The Peaches of Immortality had never been stolen. Only one with extraordinary power—truly a high celestial immortal—could do so. Every peach banquet was a grand affair, and who would be so greedy as to steal after being honored guests? Such behavior would disgrace their status and face. Thus, though called guardian, the deity needed no real guarding. The garden gates were open day and night, with people coming and going freely. Not a single petal or leaf had ever been missing. This duty was a carefree, privileged post in the upper realms, with authority but no real obligation.

Yet the world’s affairs are full of the unexpected and unimaginable. At this very time, the Wood Star Dongfang Shuo, having caused trouble in the mortal realm, dared to come to the Jade Pool to steal peaches. For writers, such an impossible tale is hard to believe. Even the Queen Mother in the Western lands likely did not foresee it, let alone the guardian deity or the immortal children.

To learn how Dongfang Shuo stole the peaches and whether he faced danger, await the next chapter’s unfolding.
