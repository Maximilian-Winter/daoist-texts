# Chapter Sixty-Six: The Holy Mother Returns to the Mountain to Clarify the Injustice; The Ghost Official Shows Favor to the Chaste Soul

Now, it is told that the Chief Guardian Deity of the Jade Pool Mountain received reports from the assembly of celestial maidens, saying, “The Garden Guardian Spirit has committed various irregular deeds, most grievously the theft of the sacred peaches. The case is most serious.” The Chief Steward, leading his divine soldiers, arrived at the garden. The first thing he observed was the Garden Guardian gambling in secret. Knowing well that his misconduct was true, he refrained from immediate wrath, instead bringing his soldiers straight into the garden to count the new and old peaches. Consulting the records kept over the years, they inspected every tree and every corner. Indeed, more than ten peaches were missing.

Thus, an order was issued to detain the Garden Guardian, awaiting the Holy Mother’s return to pass judgment. Meanwhile, the Chief Deity appointed a suitable and meticulous divine official to take over the garden’s guardianship. As for the Queen Mother’s garden, the peaches were truly abundant, but through the ages, only the tale of Dongfang Shuo stealing peaches was ever told. Aside from Dongfang Shuo, no second or third thief had ever been heard of.

Moreover, the Jade Pool is a sacred realm guarded by countless immortals and spirits. The Queen Mother, dignified and supreme among the immortals, would surely have her possessions protected. Who would dare to steal from her? Even Dongfang Shuo’s theft was compelled by imperial decree from the mortal realm, a matter beyond his control, merely a trial. By fortune, he encountered the Queen Mother away on a journey, and the Garden Guardian was negligent, allowing him to succeed. Without such opportunity, it would hardly have been so easy. As for the accusation that the Garden Guardian stole from his own charge, this came from Dongfang Shuo’s mouth—a man of jest and trickery, who had just suffered losses at the Garden Guardian’s hands. It was only natural he would play a trick, causing the guardian to suffer a wrongful charge.

The learned reader, upon reaching this passage, should think thus: all the missing peaches in the garden were taken by Dongfang Shuo alone. He thought, since he had once been a thief, why not do so thoroughly? Ten or more peaches he stole at once, bringing the Garden Guardian to a place where he could not defend himself, losing his post and fearing future punishment. This too may be seen as the guardian’s retribution for neglect and careless speech. When the Queen Mother returned to the Jade Pool, her radiant wisdom illuminated all, leaving no detail hidden. She summoned the Chief Guardian Deity and revealed the truth about Dongfang Shuo’s theft and the false accusation against the Garden Guardian.

Regarding Dongfang Shuo, though mischievous by nature, he bore no ill intent. Moreover, he served the Han court with merit and had benefited the people. He could have been shown leniency. Yet fearing others might imitate, and justice be undermined, he was ordered to suffer mild terror in the mortal realm, his crime officially recorded. The Garden Guardian, though innocent of theft, was guilty of dereliction of duty and thus deserved punishment: three years of sweeping and cleaning in the garden. After three years, if he could revive his spirit and show true merit, he might be reassigned to another post. The verdict was clear, and all offered respectful praise to the Holy Mother’s virtue. Though demoted, the Garden Guardian’s heart was grateful to have his name cleared. Only Dongfang Shuo, having stolen the peaches, returned to present them to the Martial Emperor, who was greatly pleased and henceforth honored him above all others.

Several years passed. The Martial Emperor, finding the Queen Mother’s teachings on the dao too slow and doubting the words “cultivate immortality,” heard from ministers of a certain alchemist named Li Shaojun, who could traverse the path of life and death and possessed the elixir of immortality. The Emperor sent high officials to invite him to court. Shaojun, a disciple of a demonic sect, upon meeting the Emperor, boldly declared that cultivating the dao was easy, ascending to Heaven as simple as turning one’s hand. The Emperor, weary of the Queen Mother’s slow methods, found these words to his liking. He favored Shaojun, placing him above Dongfang Shuo in rank.

At this time, the Emperor mourned deeply the recent death of his favored consort, Lady Li. Shaojun, sensing the Emperor’s heart, claimed he could bring the spirit of the departed consort to meet His Majesty.

The Emperor ordered the palace to be cleansed and purified, allowing Shaojun to perform his experiment. After leaving the palace, Shaojun sought out his friend Wang Yizhi to borrow the soul of a female ghost under his command. The plan was to have this ghost impersonate the consort’s spirit and meet the Emperor.

Wang Yizhi, growing older and more muddled in mind, spent his days drinking wildly with a band of companions, often becoming so drunk he neglected his duties. His disciple, Fei Changfang, deeply attached to his master, frequently admonished him with stern words. But Yizhi, believing he had failed in cultivating immortality and that his remaining days were few, preferred to enjoy his remaining time rather than waste it on worldly affairs. After many attempts, Changfang gave up.

When Li Shaojun asked to borrow a ghost, Yizhi, squinting his drunken eyes, laughed, “This is easy. You must give me ten jars of fine wine as thanks. I will select the most beautiful ghost—fat or thin, tall or short—anyone you specify, and bring her for your use.” Shaojun smiled, “You grow greedier with age. What use is a belly full of such yellow brew? If you get drunk and make a mistake, and the ghosts rise against you tomorrow, how will you escape?” Yizhi laughed and said, “Nonsense! I am the master of millions of ghosts. What evil spirit dares to cross me?” Shaojun laughed, “Just joking. No need to get so angry. Ten jars of good wine? That’s easy. I’ll send them right away, along with a banquet of fine dishes for your drinking pleasure. How’s that?”

These words delighted Yizhi greatly, and he laughed heartily, bowing in thanks. He fetched a newly arrived register of female ghosts and said, “Tonight, bring the wine and feast. We’ll drink ourselves senseless. I will summon the ghosts, and you may choose one yourself. I will teach you a secret to bring the ghost into the palace. You may keep her as long as you like; if you tire of her, you can send her back at once. Brother, with my help, these ten jars of wine and the feast won’t be wasted, right?” Shaojun was overjoyed, parted from Yizhi, and at once sent ten jars of fine wine, then secured a sumptuous banquet from a famous tavern, delivering it as well. That night, he returned to Yizhi’s home, and old friends drank with great enthusiasm. By midnight, both were thoroughly intoxicated.

Shaojun, eager, raised his cup and asked Yizhi to summon the female ghosts for a look. Riding the wave of their drunkenness, Yizhi led him into a gloomy, shadowy chamber. Yizhi pursed his lips and whispered, and a black mist rose from the floor.

Shaojun shivered involuntarily but fixed his gaze: a shaggy-haired, bare-chested, barefoot male ghost appeared, folding his hands to Yizhi and asking, “What orders does the master give?” Yizhi commanded, “Summon all the newly arrived female ghosts to meet me.” The ghost howled in response, black winds rose, and in an instant, all traces vanished. Yizhi said, “This is the ghost attendant, ready to obey commands.” Shaojun asked, “In such pitch darkness, even if there are beauties, how can one see them?” Yizhi laughed, “Why worry? When mortal lights meet ghosts, yin energy surges so strong it can extinguish flames. Strong ghosts come and go with whirlwinds. Even a hundred paces away, the wind can blow out the greatest lights. To meet ghosts, one must prepare a bright lamp with a horned shade, so the ghost wind cannot snuff it out. Today, many ghosts have been summoned, and the yin energy is fierce. The horned lamp may not suffice. I have prepared a kind of electric fire. This fire is the most powerful in the world. Actually, ‘in the world’ is just a phrase. Where else can you find such heavenly fire? Simply put, it is the lightning of thunder and lightning. Thunder has Lord Thunder, lightning has Mother of Lightning. Though thunder and lightning are natural, Lord Thunder and Mother of Lightning hold authority and responsibility over them. I borrowed this electric fire from Mother of Lightning. Many fierce ghosts form bands and disobey commands, hiding in darkness to cause trouble. Even with ghost-slaying weapons, one often runs out of skill. So I asked my master, Iron Crutch, to petition Mother of Lightning for some electric power.”

He took from his bag two plates, neither copper nor copper, neither iron nor iron, saying, “These are treasures forged in my master’s gourd, called Electric Plates. When rubbed together, they draw lightning from the air into the room. My master also said, ‘Two thousand years hence, the world’s morals will decline, and human hearts will be like ghosts. The fires used by mortals will fail. Then Mother of Lightning’s responsibility will be even greater, for all the fires of the world will rely on her electric power to shine forth and illuminate the world.’” Shaojun laughed, “That sounds like a jest. Will people two thousand years from now really borrow electricity from Mother of Lightning as you do?” Yizhi sneered, “You don’t understand. As I said, electricity is a natural product of Heaven and Earth. It is not Mother of Lightning’s private property, nor something she creates herself. She only manages and controls it.

Moreover, all things in the world are for the use of all people. In the future, since nothing but electricity will illuminate, people will naturally harness electric light. The method of gathering electricity will be as common as farming, weaving, and sericulture are today, nothing strange. Yet the power to deliver electricity will remain in Mother of Lightning’s hands. Just as people today know electricity is not hers, only under her management and control.” As Yizhi spoke, he cast a spell and drew the electric light into the room. Instantly, the chamber was bright as midday, but the light was pure and clear, like moonlight rather than the fierce red of sunlight. Shaojun, standing by, felt a warm heat that was uncomfortable and asked, “When will the ghosts arrive?”

Yizhi pointed sharply and drew talismans, suddenly frowning in anger, shouting into the air, “Why such disobedience? How long must I wait before they come?” Before he finished, whirlwinds arose, swirling to the floor, then stilling near the electric light. Many female ghosts clamored and stood before them, all bowing to Yizhi. Yizhi smiled arrogantly and did not return their bows. Shaojun looked closely and saw some with disheveled hair and bleeding orifices; others were finely dressed, with clear brows, bright eyes, red lips, and white teeth, indistinguishable from living people; some were fat as pigs and dull as oxen; some over ten feet tall, others barely three feet.

Shaojun had learned from palace informants that the late consort was a slender, graceful beauty. Boldly, he searched among the ghosts for one matching this description.

After much searching, he found one about twenty years old, bearing seven or eight likenesses to the description. Examining her closely, he saw peachy cheeks, apricot eyes, cherry lips, and a willow waist—a peerless beauty. What puzzled him was that while other ghosts showed anger or illness, this ghost was cold, solemn, neither angry nor sorrowful, without a trace of frivolity. Shaojun rejoiced, “Brother Wang, please have this lady endure the journey.” Wang Yizhi nodded, “Very well, take her.” Before they spoke further, the ghost asked, “Master, may I ask where I am to go with this official? Know that in life I refused to compromise lightly, and so came to this path of death. Now, as one beneath the earth, must I still guard my resolve? Must I go with a strange man? Though cut off from the living world, unknown to anyone, my temper is such that I would rather dwell alone in silence than keep company with the living. Please tell your friend to choose another.”

Wang Yizhi, naturally irascible and drunk, seeing a ghost so stubborn that commands failed and fearing Shaojun’s ridicule, shouted, “How dare you disobey orders? Know this official is the most esteemed before the Emperor. He brings you to the palace to meet the Emperor, a rare blessing sought by many. Yet you refuse! Truly, you show no gratitude!” Saying this, he silenced the ghost and asked Shaojun to make a talisman. A wisp of fragrant wind slowly entered Shaojun’s sleeve. Yizhi said, “This ghost is now by your side. You may do as you please, but do not use any method to defile her. That crime is grave indeed. Not only you, but I would be ground to dust!” Having said this, he withdrew the electric light, waved his hand, and the whirlwinds scattered the ghosts. The two left the chamber and resumed drinking.

After drinking, Shaojun laughed and asked, “I did not expect it, but is it truly impossible to summon the royal consort?” Yizhi shook his head, “That is difficult. Know that a woman who became a royal consort is no ordinary woman—either a star descended, or a deity fallen. After death, some return to their ranks; some, if guilty, are punished further; some are cast into hell without release; some, if meritorious, are promoted. These are beyond my jurisdiction. I cannot summon them. Otherwise, I could have found the consort’s original soul to reunite with the Emperor, sparing all this trickery.” Shaojun asked, “Why is this ghost so stubborn? You are their chief, yet she shows no fear of you. Why?” Yizhi said, “Do not underestimate her. She was a scholar’s daughter, surnamed Wang, named Yingying. From childhood, she was betrothed by her parents to a family named Liu. Both families were prosperous then, a match of equals. But the Liu child was unlucky. Since his birth, death, floods, and fire disasters befell his family, ruining all.

Though he grew learned, his family was broken, and he could not find shelter. An old servant paid expenses to send him to his father-in-law’s home, hoping for care. But Yingying’s parents were no good. Hearing of the Liu family’s plight, they planned to remarry her.

Yingying was famed for beauty and talent, from a local official family. Many young men desired her. Her father sought a second match, judging by power and influence. He said, ‘Though the family is ruined, with power we can recover. Without power, comfort now cannot withstand misfortune.’ Thus, he favored a prime minister’s son, hoping to secure a post through his influence. He spoke this to his daughter. But Yingying, a woman of integrity and learning, rebelled, threatening death, saying, ‘One woman cannot have two husbands. Even if I marry a dog or chicken, I will follow them all my life. Though mocked as a beast, I will have no shame. If I marry for power and despise poverty, even with kings and nobles, the loss of virtue and stain of disgrace will never fade. For fleeting comfort, to suffer endless scorn, I will never.’ Her father was furious, beating her with his wife, locking her in a room. Yingying endured and reluctantly agreed.

That night, she tried to hang herself but was saved by servants. From then, her parents’ love turned to hatred. The Liu child arrived to visit his father-in-law. Yingying’s father, hostile, fearing Yingying would learn, hurriedly sent him fifty taels of silver, ordering him to return to study within two years or never return. The Liu boy, angry, threw the silver at the door, cursing loudly. The matter became known, and Yingying sent her maid to secretly inform him of her fidelity and willingness to return with him.

But the maid’s loose tongue revealed this, and Yingying was locked in a room, forbidden to see anyone but to eat and drink. Her parents spread rumors she had sought death, blaming the Liu boy. They sent men to threaten him to return. But he laughed and said, ‘If she can keep faith for me, I will die content. No matter what my father-in-law does, I will accompany her in death.’ The scandal spread through the city. People said old Wang was greedy and cruel, forcing his daughter to reject her betrothed. The prime minister forbade his son to marry into the Wang family. Wang’s father was driven mad with rage, and could only scold his daughter. Yingying, locked away, resolved to die to repay Liu. Her husband remained unaware, and she suffered endless sorrow. One day, her father beat her cruelly.

The old man spread false news that the Liu boy had died, and servants lamented. Yingying, enraged and unthinking, late at night removed her ornaments and hanged herself. Her resentment lingered, and she often appeared at home, causing disturbances. Her father, driven to despair, finally called me to take her back. Such a chaste and righteous soul is unlike ordinary ghosts and cannot be long confined in the underworld. Once her case is resolved, she shall be reborn into a noble family.

I can only keep her for one or two months. Other ghosts may stay longer, but not this one. When the matter is done, please return her to me at once. One more thing: since you will use her to replace Lady Li, know that she is a maiden who never left the country, a most chaste woman, and may not agree to impersonate a married woman or claim a husband. If she objects upon meeting, it will cause trouble. It is best to keep her far from the Emperor—close enough to see, but not to approach. Their languages differ, so any slip can be easily covered. This is very important.”

Shaojun thanked him repeatedly, took Yingying’s ghost to the palace, and reported to the Martial Emperor: “By imperial order, I have summoned Lady Li’s living soul. The meeting may only occur at midnight’s zenith. But Your Majesty is the supreme sovereign, majestic and mighty. Spirits and ghosts may not approach. At the meeting, you may only gaze from afar, and may not converse. Please be mindful.” The Emperor only wished to see Lady Li; whether they could speak was secondary.

When the Martial Emperor came to meet Yingying, what happened next remains to be told in the following chapter.
