# Chapter Sixty-Seven: Zhang Mu Borrows a Soul—Demonic Trickery Deceives the Lord; Rescuing the Disciple and Assisting the Dharma—Immortals Descend to the Mortal Realm

Now, it happened that Li Shaojun, following the method taught by Wang Yizhi for commanding ghosts, set up a secret chamber within the palace. Inside the chamber, he hung black curtains all around, and in the center suspended a bright horn lamp. Once the arrangement was complete, he placed Yingying’s soul beside him and then invited the Martial Emperor to come and meet.

The Martial Emperor, hearing that the soul of Lady Li had been summoned, felt both sorrow and comfort. He followed Li Shaojun to the secret chamber.

Shaojun invited the Martial Emperor to sit quietly outside the curtain. Drawing his sword and forming hand seals, he began the ritual. The Martial Emperor’s eyes never wavered from the curtain’s center. At first, it was empty and hollow, but then suddenly a gust of chilling wind arose, causing the bright horn lamp to sway in midair. The candlelight flickered—darkening and brightening repeatedly. Though bold of heart, the Martial Emperor felt a creeping unease.

Shaojun quickly pointed the sword’s tip thrice at the lamp’s light, and only then did the wind calm and the lamp steady. Yet even in the steady light, a shadowy gloom lingered, a faintly sinister aura. The Martial Emperor then noticed, at the corner where the black curtain met the wall, the faint silhouette of a woman cast upon the drape. The expression bore some resemblance to Lady Li, though not quite lifelike.

The Martial Emperor thought: this is her soul’s transformation after death, nothing strange. Looking more closely, the shadow seemed to detach from the curtain, slowly drifting downward as if approaching him. Yet upon a second glance, it appeared still fixed upon the curtain, unmoving. His heart grew anxious and pained.

He wished to call out but feared that his yang vigor might scatter her yin soul, so he patiently waited. After a while, the ghostly figure seemed to notice the Martial Emperor and instantly displayed an angry countenance. The Martial Emperor was startled. He thought: when Lady Li was alive, their bond was deep and true. Now reunited after death, she should feel joy and sorrow intertwined—why anger?

Lost in such thoughts, the ghost suddenly turned away, back facing the Martial Emperor, leaning against the curtain, no longer visible. Overcome with sorrow, the Martial Emperor could not help but recite a few lines of poetry:

“Is it evil or not evil, coming and going in turns?  
Why does she linger so long in coming?”

Having finished, he burst into loud lamentation, tears falling like rain. Suddenly, a thunderous roar echoed, like distant thunder. Shaojun hurriedly dragged the Martial Emperor away. The Emperor, bewildered, followed unwillingly. Yet his eyes could not bear to leave and glanced once more toward the curtain.

What he saw was a ghastly sight: a hanged ghost with disheveled hair, tongue hanging three feet, blood flowing from all seven orifices. The Martial Emperor screamed in terror and collapsed. Shaojun hastened to support him out.

Back in the palace, the Martial Emperor’s face was ashen. Dismissing the attendants, he asked Shaojun urgently: “Why has Lady Li become a hanged ghost’s form?”

Shaojun quickly reported: “This is because Your Majesty’s recited verses forced Lady Li’s wandering soul to retreat. I had with me a hanged ghost, entrusted by Ghost Master Wang Yizhi to investigate a case. Generally, those who die by strangulation bear lingering resentment. Even in the presence of yang vigor, they can appear. Since Lady Li passed away, this ghost seized the opportunity to manifest, seeking Your Majesty’s judgment.”

The Martial Emperor asked hurriedly: “What kind of hanged ghost is this? What grievance caused her death? Tell me in detail. I shall surely avenge her.”

Shaojun replied: “This matter must be settled by Your Majesty in due time. Now is not the moment; to speak would be useless. Moreover, it contains heavenly secrets—disclosure would be a crime. I dare not speak recklessly.”

The Martial Emperor, his heart heavy with thoughts of Lady Li, lost interest in pressing further. After a few questions, he let the matter rest. Shaojun then took Yingying’s living soul back and returned it to Wang Yizhi.

After Shaojun left, Wang Yizhi’s disciple Fei Changfang happened to come by and learned of the matter. Changfang was greatly displeased and said: “Master has been used by Shaojun. Whether in Heaven, the Underworld, or even the White Jade Emperor and Yanluo, the highest value is placed on a man’s integrity and a woman’s affection. A woman like Yingying, so chaste and pure, truly deserves the reverence of the celestial gods and the three teachings alike. Master, as a ghost master, should align with Heaven’s will and human sentiment. Such a ghost’s soul demands special care and respect. How can you recklessly lend your dao power to some unrelated scoundrel to impersonate a woman’s soul? This not only desecrates a chaste maiden but may also harm your own virtue, something the gods will not tolerate. I am but a humble disciple, yet I deeply worry for you, Master.”

Wang Yizhi, then heavily drunk and muddled, took Changfang’s words as slander and rebuked him sharply. Changfang, seeing his master’s drunken confusion, did not argue but sighed silently and took his leave. By the next day, Wang Yizhi had completely forgotten the previous night’s events.

Changfang did not mention the matter again. It was only in the afternoon, when Shaojun personally returned the ghost soul, that Wang Yizhi recalled Changfang’s admonitions, which lingered in his heart. Reflecting, he found every word true. Yingying was a woman of utmost chastity; in life, she would not waver, so how could she tolerate being violated by their dao methods after death? Such a pure and fierce soul should roam freely, traversing the Three Realms and wandering beyond the Four Seas. Though temporarily entrusted to him, she would soon be summoned by the Heavenly Emperor and honored specially. When that time came, how could she silently endure such humiliation? What hope would remain for his own life and future?

Deep in thought, he shivered with dread. Looking at Shaojun, then at Changfang, he suddenly sighed deeply, tears streaming down, leaving Shaojun and Changfang perplexed.

Wang Yizhi bitterly said to Changfang: “Brother, I now remember your words from yesterday. I hate myself for lacking self-discipline and for my quick temper. Though I have long studied under famous masters, I have been undone by this stubborn pride, lacking patience, nearly causing great disaster. Fortunately, my master saved me from hell and entrusted me with my current duties. Yet I am so worthless that after more than a hundred years, instead of progress, I have fallen into drunkenness and folly, even suffering insult from false friends and deeply offending a chaste soul beyond repair. I fear the Heavenly Emperor will investigate and, once the case is judged, I shall surely descend to hell.

I recall my master’s earnest warnings, implying I was unfit not only to cultivate the dao but even to be a mere ghost leader. His concern was for my fate should I fail. Reflecting now, I have done no great evil these hundred years. Yet now, growing old and unlucky, I have fallen for a villain’s trick and committed this mad folly. The outcome must be dreadful. Could it be that my master’s prophecy is fulfilled today?

I have lived upright, doing good, upholding chivalry and righteousness, never stooping to base or vile acts. I dare not claim to be a gentleman but have avoided being a villain. I never expected that failing in cultivation, I could not even keep the modest rank of a ghost immortal, and now, in old age, bring about such disaster. My life is insignificant; how can I face my master beyond this world, or my worthy brother Changfang? Had I awakened after your counsel yesterday, perhaps there would have been a chance to mend this.

But cursed is my drinking nature—once it seizes me, I lose all reason, worse than beasts or stones. Missing this last chance, I have made an irreparable error. Alas, what can I do but await my punishment? I do not blame fate, only my own lack of humanity and worthlessness. At this age, unable to distinguish right from wrong, unable to judge a single matter’s truth—this is truly misfortune. What more is there to say?”

He sighed again, bowed over the desk, tears flowing. Changfang, his disciple and close companion, was stunned beyond expectation. Only Li Shaojun, who had borrowed the soul to deceive the lord, was no good man. Though aided by Wang Yizhi, he was accustomed to evil deeds and regarded the abuse of a female ghost as trivial as a mustard seed. Yet hearing Wang Yizhi’s bitter words, he could not bear it. Ignoring Wang Yizhi’s sorrow, he laughed coldly to the sky and loudly declared:

“I have never seen such a useless scoundrel, boasting of being a gentleman—truly shameful! Even if I am a bad friend, a villain, here to harm you, you are a gentleman, a righteous man—why did you so readily agree to me? You oversee these matters and should know the rules and risks. I only wanted a common female ghost; you should never have brought this chaste soul along. Since you, as ghost leader, brought this ghost here, how can I not believe you cannot control her? You caused all this trouble and offended an old friend before disaster even struck. What kind of business is this? Think it over yourself; I am too lazy to argue with such foolishness.” Saying so, he strode out.

When Shaojun had gone, Wang Yizhi gasped, sighed deeply, and turned to Changfang: “Brother, have you seen? Such a man truly has lost all conscience. I blame myself for mistaking a villain for a gentleman. It is my own sin, no more to say. But one thing I must tell you: I know this disaster is too great. The last time was worse, but the culprits were all villains, and there was cause. Moreover, my master was nearby then to aid and prevent death. This time, it is entirely my own doing, no hope of rescue, no second master to save me. When this is discovered, not long hence, my life will surely end. My death is no loss; with a disciple like you to carry on, I shall die without regret. From today, I will teach you fully the dao power I have not yet passed on. You shall be my successor. After I die, I expect my master to come for me. You must earnestly petition him to rescue me, to lessen my sins. This is most important—do not forget.”

Changfang was deeply moved. Nothing more could be said; he offered some words of comfort and fell silent.

Unbeknownst to them, in the celestial courts of Heaven and Earth, where reward and punishment are most exacting, this matter was already known. Though no one in the mortal realm was aware, the gods of the Three Realms had reported Wang Yizhi and Li Shaojun’s insult to the chaste soul and deception of the sovereign to the Jade Emperor. The Jade Emperor, upon receiving the report, ordered the Wood Star, Dongfang Shuo, to investigate and enforce the law.

Dongfang Shuo, close to the court, was favored by the Martial Emperor since Li Shaojun’s summons to the palace. The Emperor esteemed Dongfang Shuo above others for his uprightness and loyalty, guiding the sovereign rightly, correcting faults, sometimes subtle in counsel, sometimes blunt, his merits in court affairs were many. Yet this earned the Emperor’s displeasure. Li Shaojun envied Dongfang Shuo most fiercely, even accusing that the last time the Queen Mother and the host of immortals were invited, they were but a band of demons in disguise. In truth, the real Queen Mother still sat high in the Jade Pool, unaware of these things.

The Martial Emperor, deeply suspicious, found Li Shaojun’s words striking, for Shaojun was his most trusted. Though the matter had passed without evidence, and Dongfang Shuo’s protests were ignored, the Emperor’s distrust grew.

Dongfang Shuo knew these intrigues well. Fortunately, he cared little for rank or favor; whether the Emperor trusted him or not was irrelevant. Let them scheme and sow discord; he paid no heed. Yet to avoid trouble, he no longer spoke as freely or served as devotedly as before. Since the Emperor spoke little to him, he focused on cultivating his great dao, paying little attention to court affairs. Thus, relations between lord and minister remained peaceful.

Now, having received the heavenly decree, and knowing Li Shaojun’s collusion with Wang Yizhi to ensnare the chaste soul and impersonate Lady Li, deceiving the Emperor, Dongfang Shuo found it difficult to shirk responsibility.

One day, pondering how to take the lives of Wang Yizhi and Li Shaojun, Dongfang Shuo considered that though Wang Yizhi’s power was limited, Shaojun possessed potent sorcery, rivaling himself. To confront him openly would undermine the heavenly order, delay justice, and risk the Jade Emperor’s wrath. If he summoned Shaojun, the latter might shield himself with imperial favor, refusing summons or even accusing Dongfang Shuo. Secretly attacking with flying swords was improper; the law required clear evidence and formal judgment. The heavenly court must act openly and justly.

Wavering, Dongfang Shuo grew drowsy and nodded off at his desk.

Just as sleep began to claim him, he heard the harmonious cries of phoenix and crane in midair. Then birds alighted in his courtyard. Rousing himself, still half asleep, he saw two immortals standing nearby—one clad in white, the other draped in a cloak—accompanied by colorful phoenixes and white cranes, resting and wandering.

Dongfang Shuo did not recognize them and quickly composed himself, greeting them and asking their names and purpose. The two immortals smiled at each other. The one in white, a lame immortal, said with a smile: “Have you forgotten us so soon?” He named himself Li Xuan, nicknamed Iron Crutch. Pointing to the other, he said: “This is Xuan Zhuzi. We were old friends in a past life—how could you not know us?”

Dongfang Shuo, a man of profound dao, though in the mortal realm, was versed in the spirits. Hearing this, he suddenly recalled celestial matters and smiled, admitting his fault, inviting the two to his study.

The immortals laughed: “No one visits the Three Treasures Hall without cause. We come because the Wood Star faces difficulties and we wish to lend a hand. Also, we have a small favor to ask.”

Dongfang Shuo seated them and asked: “Is this about Wang Yizhi? He is Li Dao brother’s top disciple. Such a pity this affair has become so tangled; I fear no way to save him.”

Iron Crutch replied: “I am not here to save his life. As a ghost master, he knowingly broke the law. If such could be pardoned, then all the ten great crimes in the world could be forgiven. The penalty for such is death—once dead, the sentence is complete. My concern, out of many years of master-disciple bond, is that after death he will suffer in the Underworld, with no end in sight. So I spoke with the Wood Star: after his death, may I take his remains so he can endure hundreds of years of hardship, perhaps gaining some fortune. Surely this can be arranged?”

Dongfang Shuo answered: “That is easy. Heaven’s punishments have limits; once served, no excess. Besides, Yizhi is merely a drunken fool, not truly evil. His case is pitiable, and your kindness repays his lifetime of chivalry and loyalty. This can surely be done.” He then asked Xuan Zhuzi: “Brother, having come so far, do you have any advice?”

Xuan Zhuzi smiled: “Iron Crutch cares for his disciple’s fate; I seek nothing from you. But since you now enforce the law against Li Shaojun, know this: Shaojun once followed the Tongtian Patriarch and caused havoc at Huaihai Village and troubled Luo Yuan’s wife. He is a demon. This demon was once a great turtle cultivated for five thousand years, carrying a magic treasure called the ‘Eye-Shield.’ It is made from its own turtle egg, cursed with the most filthy things of the mortal world. When this orb is unleashed, it shrouds all eyes in a thick fog, so no one can see clearly, even face to face.”

Hearing this, Dongfang Shuo nodded: “No wonder I heard that last time he replaced Lady Li’s ghost to meet the Emperor. The Emperor could see her but not her true face—blurred and vague, as if in a five-li fog. I did not know what power caused such an illusion. Now, your words explain it was this orb’s doing.”

Xuan Zhuzi chuckled: “That is but a minor matter. Whether the Emperor sees Lady Li or not matters little. You do not know what mischief he caused at Qiantang River. The tides there are great everywhere. Since I took office, I have unified the tidal laws so that other places have lesser tides and shallower waters. The frustrated dragon spirits and turtle demons cannot hide there. Where the tides are strong, I control them. Though cunning, they cannot prevail. Yet last year, the old dragon schemed with this turtle demon to launch a major attack. The turtle demon hung its orb, and our divine generals could not see each other, almost falling into its trap. Fortunately, Master Wenmei sent his disciple Tong Hui to forge a crystal bottle beneath Wenzi Peak in Fujian. It shines light and absorbs the demon’s fog. Tong Hui arrived on time, drove it into the sea, forcing it to hide. But now it has taken human form to confuse the Emperor. I fear if this creature is not eliminated, great harm will come. I have come specially to help you remove this monster. Its treasure not only clouds vision but resists weapons. It knows its evil deeds are many and fears heavenly punishment, so it often hangs the Eye-Shield in its room to prevent secret attacks and blind others to its presence. Though you are charged with its arrest, I fear you may not easily overcome it.”

Dongfang Shuo bowed deeply and said: “I thank you, Brother, for coming so far to instruct me. To learn the method to eliminate this demon would be not only my fortune but a blessing for all under Heaven.”

How Xuan Zhuzi replied is revealed in the next chapter.
