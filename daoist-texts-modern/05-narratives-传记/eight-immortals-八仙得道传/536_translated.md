# Chapter Sixty-Eight: Receiving the Official Decree to Settle the Peach Theft Case; Refining the Defiling Mirror to Shatter the Eye-Covering Orb

Now it happened that the True Pearl, upon seeing Dongfang Shuo approach with respectful entreaty, hastily agreed, saying, “Both of us serve the people by removing harm; there is no need for thanks.” As he spoke, he took out a small mirror box and opened it. Inside were two mirrors, one above and one below. Within each mirror, two pairs of naked men and women were reflected, engaged in the rites of the Duke of Zhou. Dongfang Shuo could not help but laugh aloud and asked, “What is the meaning of this?” The True Pearl also smiled and said, “This is the eye-covering orb of Lord Li Shaojun. Its most potent power lies in a kind of yin defiling energy, which it refines into a heavy fog. Thus, whether immortal or mortal, none can open their eyes. The bottle used by Tonghui last time was good—it could break his spell but could not destroy the orb itself. I have now refined this mirror, taking the utmost filth and obscenity to counter that defiling energy. The mirror’s light is drawn from the fiercest sunlight, able to dispel his fog and burn his orb. Nothing else can break it.”

Dongfang Shuo rejoiced greatly and then spoke of his own hesitations. The two immortals said, “This matter offends Heaven. Since Heaven decrees punishment, it must be just and proper to chill the hearts of demons and men alike. What you have seen is truly righteous and grand. Now that there is a method to restrain him, there is no fear of his resistance.” Dongfang Shuo happily agreed and asked, “When may we act?” The True Pearl replied, “I cannot stay long. It is best to seize him immediately, clarify his crimes, so that the guilty die without grievance and the onlookers are filled with dread. Then announce the Jade Emperor’s decree and proceed to execute him—how does that sound?” Hearing this, Dongfang Shuo, the True Pearl, and Iron Crutch went together to the western end of the imperial palace, to Li Shaojun’s mansion, and formally requested his presence to receive the decree.

At that moment, Shaojun was in the rear garden, drinking and enjoying himself with a group of concubines. When the servants reported, “Master Dongfang has arrived with two Daoist priests to deliver an imperial decree,” Shaojun, still dazed, mistook it for an edict from the Han emperor. Hastily he prepared himself and came out to meet the three.

Dongfang Shuo stood at the head and said, “The Emperor on High has decreed; Li Shaojun, kneel to receive it.” With these words, he startled Li Shaojun. Shaojun neither knelt nor grew angry; instead, he smiled slyly and asked, “Lord Dongfang, you and I serve in the same court, colleagues and fellow Daoists, so our situation is more intimate than with others. Just now you said you came to deliver a decree; I mistakenly thought it was an imperial edict from the emperor himself, so I came out with reverence to receive it. But what you declare is the Jade Emperor’s decree. To speak frankly, Heaven and Earth are far apart, and such matters can be true or false. Since you and I are so close, you should have first told me the contents—whether blessing or disaster—so I might prepare myself. What do you think?”

Dongfang Shuo saw his evasions clearly showed disdain for the decree and disrespect for Heaven. Anger rose in his heart, and he shouted, “How dare Li Shaojun be so rude! Even within our Daoist path, we should be under the governance of the Upper Realms; even if you were a common person under the emperor’s rule, would Heaven not have authority? Someone like you, who runs rampant in lawlessness, deceives Heaven and defies the emperor, clearly disobeys the Jade Emperor and harbors rebellion—your crime deserves death ten thousand times over. Yet you still speak arrogantly, scorning the imperial decree; such a crime cannot be pardoned.” Shaojun, enraged, confident in his strong defenses and knowing Dongfang Shuo’s Daoist skills were not supreme, felt no fear. Wiping his face, he sneered, “By your logic, you are the Jade Emperor’s enforcer come to make trouble for me? Never mind that we belong to different sects—even if we were of the same school, I am now a minister of the realm, trusted by the emperor, and need not obey the Upper Realms’ orders.”

Seeing Shaojun grow more arrogant, Dongfang Shuo quickly said to the two immortals, “This villain is so bold—please help me seize him.” Hearing the word “seize,” Shaojun immediately drew his sword and charged at Dongfang Shuo. The True Pearl met him with sword in hand. Shaojun shouted, “This is no place for fighting! If you have courage, follow me to the rear plaza.” The three immortals shouted back, “Even if it is your demon lord’s lair, who would fear you?” They all gave chase. Unexpectedly, Shaojun ran through another courtyard and stopped in a large open hall.

The three immortals entered the hall and suddenly felt as if a black curtain blocked their sight, preventing them from seeing one another. Knowing this was where Shaojun hung his eye-covering orb, they were grateful for their prior precautions. The True Pearl took out the mirror box and held the upper mirror outward. To their surprise, the small mirror cast a blue-green flame that filled the hall and its surroundings, instantly dispelling the black fog. Then he shone the lower mirror, and a rustling sound like falling debris came from above. The orb had been shattered. Seeing his wondrous treasure lost and resistance futile, Li Shaojun hastily transformed into a black cloud and fled into the sky. The three immortals also mounted clouds in pursuit. Yet Shaojun, who often entered the palace, had built a chamber behind the imperial residence for convenience, only a few feet away. In the blink of an eye, a blue light descended into the palace, and he vanished without a trace.

The three immortals, seeing he had entered the palace, deemed it unwise to continue the chase. They turned back to attend to the matter of Wang Yizhi. Yizhi was not like Shaojun; he had long since confessed. Upon receiving the imperial decree, he prostrated himself, begging for death. Dongfang Shuo ordered that he be allowed to see his master one last time before execution. Yizhi thanked them and rose to pay respects to Master Iron Crutch, bowing deeply without daring to look up. Iron Crutch, moved by his pitiable state, sighed and said, “Fate is predetermined; why argue further? Since you know your guilt, go quickly to your sentence. What happens after death, I will take care of. Do not worry. Your disciple Fei Changfang is spirited and courteous; have him come to see me.” Yizhi rose and summoned Changfang, who came to meet the three immortals.

Iron Crutch commanded, “Your master offended Heaven and brought punishment upon himself. After his death, I will guide his soul in further cultivation. If he is diligent, there will be benefit in five hundred years. His position should be yours to continue—be careful and attentive, and perform well. If you do, it will be great merit; if not, your master will be a cautionary example.” Changfang wept and kowtowed, saying, “I do not wish to take up my master’s post. But I hope the Patriarch, who opened Heaven and Earth, will remember my master’s sincere diligence and merits, and petition the Jade Emperor to spare his life. My master and I will redouble our efforts, perform good deeds, and make amends. I earnestly beg the Patriarch’s favor.”

Iron Crutch shook his head, “This is fate, irreversible. If you doubt, ask your master. Before he first took this post, how did I instruct him? As for you succeeding him, that is not my decision but comes by the command of the Daoist Patriarchs. You need only remember your master’s crime today and never forget it, striving always to be good. That will honor your master, and you yourself will benefit. But… ah… no need to say more. Worldly affairs cannot escape the numbers. Unless one has great wisdom and great fortune, who can change fate? Since it is of no help, I will say no more. I have spoken my piece. Dongfang, please proceed with the sentence at once.”

At that moment, Wang Yizhi knelt before the hall. Dongfang Shuo sighed and said to Iron Crutch, “I will take some responsibility and grant him a complete corpse.” No sooner had he spoken than he extended two fingers, sending a white light flying to Yizhi’s body. It transformed into a white silk ribbon, tightly binding his neck. The immortal’s power differs from ordinary execution devices. In an instant, Yizhi’s soul left his body, which collapsed to the ground. Changfang and the other disciples burst into tears.

Iron Crutch had already seized Yizhi’s living soul and placed it inside a gourd. He cupped his hands to the True Pearl and said, “Soon Dongfang Dao Brother will face a great calamity, also predetermined and unavoidable. There is a Ninefold Rebirth Talisman and a Soul-Calling Banner; keep these with you. When he meets his trial, place the talisman on his neck and use the banner to carry him away. Each day, give him one of the Qian Yuan Life-Stealing Pills he himself refined. After three days, his primordial energy will be restored. Then, when Dongfang’s earthly ties are fulfilled, he may return to Heaven and need no longer linger in the mortal realm. Even the Han emperor, when his time comes, will no longer require Dongfang’s service here.”

The True Pearl listened and agreed, then asked Iron Crutch, “Do you foresee any unexpected events upon my return?” Iron Crutch was surprised by the question. He turned his divine gaze upon him for a moment, then sighed, “Words reveal the heart, and the heart governs affairs. Dao Brother, why such doubt? The Book of Changes says, ‘Good and ill, regret and blame arise from movement.’ Your words are movement. For those who cultivate the Dao, the greatest taboo is a restless heart. Your future is indeed not peaceful. Fortunately, among your younger brothers there are those with karmic ties to you who will come to your aid. Have no fear; as long as your conscience remains alive, all will be clear. We are not afraid of physical punishment. Heaven’s secrets are hard to reveal; what I know is not limited to this, but what I can say is only this. Farewell!” With that, he saluted and vanished, having slipped away by earth concealment.

Dongfang Shuo and the True Pearl felt uneasy after Iron Crutch’s words. They gave a few instructions to Changfang and returned to Dongfang’s residence to plan anew how to kill Li Shaojun.

Meanwhile, Shaojun, upon seeing the Martial Emperor, immediately wept and bowed, saying, “Dongfang Shuo, jealous of my daily service to Your Majesty, feared I would reveal his many crimes of deceiving the emperor, so he specially invited a distant demon to trouble me. They shattered my millennium-refined treasure and dared to impersonate the Jade Emperor’s decree to take my life. I beg Your Majesty to intervene.”

The Martial Emperor, hearing this, grew angry: “Dongfang Manqian, repeatedly deceiving me, now making trouble with the master—truly a man deserving death. Master, do not worry; I will dispatch the imperial guards to expel him from the realm, forbidding him to linger in the Central Plains. Is that well?” Shaojun hurriedly advised, “This man’s Dao is deep, aided by demons. If Your Majesty does not use him, you should kill him quickly. If only expelled, he will harbor resentment and seek revenge; not only I but Your Majesty will be in danger. It is better to execute him swiftly.”

The Martial Emperor, then resentful of Dongfang Shuo and trusting Shaojun, issued an edict to behead Dongfang Shuo, ordering Shaojun to oversee the execution. Shaojun, elated, led several hundred imperial guards to surround Dongfang Shuo’s residence. Dongfang Shuo, bewildered, was about to inquire when Shaojun and four strong men strode in, confronting Dongfang Shuo and ordering his arrest. Dongfang Shuo stepped back and asked, “What is the meaning of this?” Shaojun, mimicking Dongfang’s own manner, ordered him to kneel and receive the edict, then produced the imperial decree. Dongfang Shuo, a true immortal, naturally observed his duties and knelt to receive it. Shaojun stood in the center, read the decree aloud, and without waiting for thanks, drew a flying sword and severed Dongfang Shuo’s head.

Dear reader, understand that this was the retribution for Dongfang Shuo’s peach theft, a punishment from the Queen Mother of the West. Yet this matter was too unjust. Dongfang Shuo, a man of Dao and magic, was not afraid of a single blade. Look—no sooner had his head fallen than another grew in its place. Shaojun used the flying sword again and again, each time the head fell, another sprang forth from his chest. After several times, Shaojun pondered and devised a plan. He immediately sent riders to petition the Martial Emperor, bringing the imperial seal and the imperial carriage himself. The Martial Emperor, curious and unwilling to oppose Shaojun, came in full procession to Dongfang’s residence. Shaojun knelt to welcome him and reported how Dongfang Shuo had used sorcery to deceive the emperor and defy the law. The Martial Emperor, moved to anger and fearing Dongfang’s revenge, resolved that he must be killed. He asked Shaojun how best to proceed. Shaojun replied, “Please, Your Majesty, imprint the imperial seal on paper. When the head falls, place it on his neck to suppress it so no more will grow.” The Martial Emperor obeyed, took out the imperial treasure, and stamped the paper.

Shaojun severed Dongfang Shuo’s head again, then placed the paper bearing the imperial seal on his neck. Indeed, the authority of the law and the emperor’s power were weighty. Even Dongfang Shuo’s mighty magic could not act. His head was cut off and could no longer regrow. At this moment, the True Pearl, having hidden nearby by invisibility, saw the head fall and Shaojun speaking with the Martial Emperor. No one noticed the dead body. Seizing the chance, he appeared and pretended to inspect the corpse. Approaching Dongfang Shuo’s side, he removed the seal paper, replaced it with Iron Crutch’s talisman, and placed a small sword about an inch long in his palm, saying, “Dongfang Shuo, listen! The law is obeyed, retribution is clear. Heaven’s decree cannot be escaped. Your punishment is here—why not act?”

Before the words finished, the headless Dongfang Shuo suddenly grasped the sword and, following the True Pearl, flew upward. In an instant, the Martial Emperor and his attendants, eunuchs, and soldiers all shouted, “Disaster! The ghost has fled!” The Martial Emperor, though a wise ruler, was aged and often given to wine and women, his vigor diminished. Moreover, as emperor, he had never been to the execution ground or battlefield. Seeing such a terrifying sight, he could not stand and fell backward. Shaojun, though bold, was now blind and suddenly dazed, unable to use magic to resist. The True Pearl seized his throat with both hands and read aloud the imperial decree, enumerating his crimes. The crowd, unaware of the truth, dared not approach or question. When the True Pearl finished reading, Dongfang Shuo’s sword flashed in the wind, three feet long, and pierced Shaojun’s belly. Shaojun cried out and rolled on the ground, revealing his true form—a giant turtle. He poked his head about, trying to escape, but was restrained by the True Pearl’s magic, crawling and spinning helplessly on the hall floor. The Martial Emperor, recently revived, saw Shaojun’s turtle form and was struck with terror, feeling his soul flee and unable to sit still. Hastily, he ordered the carriage back to the palace.

Here, the True Pearl struck the turtle shell thrice with his immortal sword, and a tremendous roar shook the roof tiles. The shell did not move, but the sword was knocked to the ground. Furious, the True Pearl tore his hair, grasped his sword, and strode out, chanting spells and drawing talismans to summon Leigong and Dianmu. Under the bright blue sky, suddenly the heavens darkened and the daylight dimmed. The thunder and lightning deities appeared in the air, bowing and asking, “Master of the Law, you have summoned us; what is the matter?” The True Pearl raised his hand in salute and said loudly, “The turtle demon Li Shaojun has repeatedly harmed living beings, his crimes are great and evil. Recently he took human form, stood in court, insulted pure souls, seduced the emperor, and committed countless crimes. For a time, the planet Dongfang Shuo had unfinished karmic debts and was deceived by the turtle demon to the emperor, who first beheaded him. Now Dongfang’s debts are cleared and he may soon be reborn. But the turtle demon’s crimes are too heavy to allow him to live longer. Dongfang has entrusted me to assist in exterminating the demon. The demon has revealed his true form, but his stubborn shell is strong. I am ashamed my magic is weak and cannot break it. I ask the honored gods to lend your power and shatter the shell with thunder and lightning. It would be a great favor.” Leigong and Dianmu conferred and said, “The turtle demon has long deserved punishment. Fortunately, it is summer, the season of thunder and lightning’s might. Master of the Law, please step aside and allow us to perform the rite.”

The True Pearl thanked them, summoned Dongfang Shuo’s body, and followed them inside. He instructed others to bring the severed head. Holding it carefully, he aligned it with the torso and placed it back as it had been. Then he took Iron Crutch’s talisman and inserted it at the hairline. Chanting spells, he shouted “Seal!” and the head and body fused seamlessly without a trace. Yet Dongfang Shuo still could not move or speak. The True Pearl pushed him aside, then looked out the window to hear thunder and lightning gods commanding their troops, beating drums with strange sounds. From the ground rose a golden light, shooting straight at the giant turtle in Dongfang’s courtyard. With a crackling roar, the shell shattered into dozens of pieces, blood and flesh spilling, the stench foul. Thus ended Li Shaojun’s turtle life. Yet the eye-covering orb technique, originated by him and passed down, remains. People today do not know its principle and revere it as the Eye-Covering Spirit.

Such magic, if used to catch thieves and investigate cases, or assist all police matters, is indeed effective. Alas, those who wield this method are all charlatans of the martial world, using it to extort money. For example, when a person is publicly killed and dismembered, they can immediately be reassembled; or when fake coins replace real ones, even hidden in the strongest and most secret places, there are ways to adjust the decay—these are all effects of the eye-covering. Travelers of old often placed a most filthy item, such as a spring palace cloth, inside silver coins, said to prevent sorcerers’ secret attacks. This is the True Pearl’s defiling mirror breaking the eye-covering orb’s meaning. This is idle talk; having said it, we move on.

After Leigong and Dianmu helped the True Pearl kill Shaojun’s original form, the True Pearl soared into the clouds and thanked the two gods repeatedly. They smiled and said, “We serve the public good; no thanks are needed.” The True Pearl praised their power. They laughed, “We are but hosts following Heaven and Earth’s energies—what power have we? Moreover, evil men are many, and thunder and lightning do not strike constantly. For one or two evildoers, such mobilization may harm the people and is inconvenient. We have petitioned the Jade Emperor to make electric power public, so those with law enforcement authority may use our thunder to punish evil. Thus villains would grow more fearful, and crime might lessen—though this is uncertain.” The True Pearl eagerly said, “This method is excellent. May it be adopted.” Dianmu replied, “The Jade Emperor has paid close attention and convened a great assembly with all the immortals and the Western Buddha. In the end, most said, ‘Today’s world has far fewer evildoers than good people. Thunder and lightning’s display is enough to warn the wicked. If electric power is given to the people, over time they will grow accustomed and become careless, losing its warning effect. It is better to leave things as they are.’ Only the Western Tathagata sighed, ‘The world’s morals decline, and hearts grow worse. In a thousand or two thousand years, perhaps only one in a hundred will be upright. Then earthly weapons will lose their power and fail to warn the world. The thunder gods’ proposal may eventually be implemented, but with time, evildoers will also use electric power to oppress the virtuous. Those who truly uphold justice will still rely on the thunder gods.’ Hearing this, all sighed deeply. The matter remains undecided; the future is unknown.” The True Pearl sighed, “Then we must wait until that time to deal with it.” The two gods nodded, withdrew their powers, and departed.

The True Pearl descended from the clouds and returned to Dongfang’s home. Dongfang Shuo still stood dazed to one side. The True Pearl took out the soul-calling banner and waved it at Dongfang Shuo, who shivered. The True Pearl tied the banner to himself and walked forward. Dongfang Shuo followed step by step. They left the house and used the earth-shrinking method to return to Haining. At a roadside inn, the True Pearl entered alone to lodge, leaving Dongfang Shuo outside, facing the wall. Wherever they went, people marveled at the sight of a half-dead man fleeing with him. Following Iron Crutch’s instructions, as soon as the corpse fell, it turned into thick blood. To prevent passersby from disturbing it, the True Pearl cast a spell to draw a circle around it. Anyone approaching the circle found themselves blocked as if by a wall, unable to cross. Sometimes when crossing a river by boat, he placed Dongfang Shuo at the bow and used the same method to keep onlookers away. Thus, their journey passed without incident. Yet upon reaching Haining, a great matter arose.

What that great matter was, we shall see in the next chapter.
