# Chapter Sixty-Nine: The Crippled Immortal’s Pioneering of the Returning Corpse Method; The Virtuous Maiden Mistakenly Weds a Flood Dragon Spirit

Now let us speak of the present time, within the borders of Hunan Province, in the regions around Baoqing and Changde, where customs have been handed down, speaking of a so-called method of returning the corpse to its homeland. Whenever a person from place A dies in place B, not only is moving the coffin a great difficulty, but the expenses are also exceedingly vast. Thus there arose a certain kind of person who makes a livelihood solely by escorting corpses back to their native villages. They possess a secret incantation, and carry upon themselves a soul-summoning banner. Reciting the spell toward the corpse, the dead will naturally follow them on the journey. When they come to an inn or resting place, they lay the corpse beneath the eaves outside, facing the wall, standing upright. If they must cross a river by boat, they carry the corpse off the vessel, standing it erect at the stern or prow. In this way, the corpse arrives safely at its home. Though the journey may last a full month, even in the scorching heat of summer, the corpse will not change form nor emit any stench. Yet one must not let it fall; should it topple, at once it rots and swarms with worms, and cannot be restored. 

Stranger still, when the corpse reaches the family gate, that household must have long since prepared the coffin and burial arrangements in readiness. Upon arrival, the coffin must be promptly set up without delay. If postponed even for an hour or two, the corpse will begin to decay and become unmanageable. In all, this method of transporting the corpse is reckoned the most convenient and economical of all. For thousands of years it has been passed down, flourishing without fail, though no one knows when it was first created or by whom. According to the investigations of this author, it was the Crippled Immortal who taught the method to Xuan Zhuzi, who sent the corpse of Dongfang Shuo to Haining with this talismanic spell. After Xuan Zhuzi offended the authorities, he was banished to the Xiang River as a crane, yet he also transformed into a commoner and performed this service for people. Thus this method became widespread within Hunan Province. But only in Hunan have such corpse-returning methods ever been heard of; elsewhere, never.

The reason lies in the nature of the Chinese people. Whenever there is some special invention, it is always passed down from grandfather to grandson; not only is it forbidden to teach outsiders, but even the family’s own daughters are not allowed to know of it. For once a girl grows up, she must marry. When her love for her husband deepens, she will reveal all secrets. Over time, the secret spreads ever wider, and this secret method would become a public practice. Therefore, many customs in China that could benefit society and rescue the poor and sick remain little known. This is the reason.

Now, matters like returning corpses may seem close to superstition, but whether superstition or not, if it truly works and can be tested by the people, and indeed benefits them, who can refuse belief? To believe to the utmost degree is only fitting; how can one simply call it superstition? Even if it truly is superstition, as long as it has value in inspiring faith, even if that faith is extreme, what harm is there? Moreover, every creation must have some reason within it, yet it is always treated as mysterious. The creator only speaks of the method; the recipient cannot fathom the principle. Thus it becomes something that can be used but not understood. Such matters most certainly hinder the progress of culture and science. Take the returning corpse method, said to be an immortal technique—this is indeed true. The world surely has such principles, yet not everyone can devise such methods. There cannot be a method without reason. Besides, immortals are the elite chosen from millions who have cultivated successfully. If they can create methods convenient to the people, would they fail to find the reason behind them? If there were no reason, whence would the method arise? Novels abound with vague, elusive, unverifiable tales of ghosts and wonders, meant only to entertain readers after wine and tea, to dispel melancholy and boredom.

Where there is no proof, naturally there is no reason. But the marvels recorded in this book—the various immortal deeds and stories of sages—mostly nine out of ten have evidence that can be sought. Especially as above, the returning corpse method is indeed practiced today in Hunan Province. Not only returning corpses, but also the eye-covering technique of Li Shaojun, though he died, has spread throughout the world; many wandering performers use it as a magic trick, and all know it. Like the returning corpse method, it has the method but not the principle. Hence these great immortal arts serve only a few poor people as means to earn food and clothing; beyond that, they are useless and cannot be innovated upon. Transformations and marvels further create many methods convenient to the people, for which lawmakers bear no blame. The truly regrettable ones are those who first obtained these methods, who either gained the method but did not seek the principle from lawmakers, or obtained the principle but kept it secret. Over time, even they know only the how but not the why. How laughable, how lamentable, how regrettable, how hateful! Therefore I think, if such methods were invented by present-day scientists and philosophers, they would never let them go easily, but study them thoroughly, even compile books and make them public. People reading such books might grasp other reasons, develop other enterprises, or improve upon earlier methods, refining and perfecting them—this is clear to all. It is not that this author wishes to diminish others’ ambitions or belittle himself!

Enough idle talk; lest the reader grow weary, let us hasten to the main story. The previous chapter told how Xuan Zhuzi created the returning corpse method and brought Dongfang Shuo to Haining, causing a great commotion. But the author must first declare: after Dongfang Shuo arrived at Haining and Xuan Zhuzi, following the Crippled Immortal’s instructions, tended to him, he soon regained his spirit and body, fully restored. At the same time, his exile ended, and he was summoned back to Heaven to serve the celestial court. His matter may now be concluded. The “great commotion” refers solely to Xuan Zhuzi himself.

Since assisting Dongfang Shuo and slaying Li Shaojun, Xuan Zhuzi believed that the old flood dragon, having lost this helper, would be frustrated and unable to succeed for a time, so he gradually relaxed his vigilance toward the authorities. Most affairs of the world are ever shifting like clouds and storms, hard to foresee. Yet careful preparation and caution before the storm naturally bring greater security. Especially matters of state and people’s livelihood, the safety of the land and its people, are of utmost importance. Those in charge must be especially prudent to prevent troubles before they arise.

But at this point, further reflection is needed. Human psychology often compels caution during times of hardship. When the storm passes and the waves calm, one unconsciously grows careless. Thus the ancients said, “Born in hardship, perish in ease.” This is the truth. The case of Xuan Zhuzi is much the same. Yet the disaster he brought was beyond expectation. As the saying goes, a great wind arises from a tiny wisp of duckweed. Though the wind is strong, its origin is exceedingly slight.

At that time, within Hangzhou city of Zhejiang, there was an official household surnamed He, with no men left—only a mother and her daughter, relying on each other. The mother, Madam Hu, was already advanced in years. Her daughter, named Chunying, was graceful and charming, neat and beautiful, twenty-five years old that year. Madam Hu, considering her own age and having only this one daughter, wished to find a suitable man to marry into the family, so she might have a son-in-law to rely upon. But the great and noble families scorned them for their declining fortunes, deeming them an unlucky household. Moreover, the custom of taking a husband into the wife’s family was considered shameful, and no one wished to try. As for the lower classes, the mother and daughter would not consent. Thus the years slipped by, and the fine young lady reached twenty-five without a proper match.

Madam Hu was often melancholy and unhappy. But Chunying found joy in serving her aged mother. She said, “Whether I marry or not matters little; I only wish mother to live a hundred years or more. When I grow old, we shall enter the earth and return to Heaven together—that is my heart’s desire.” Madam Hu laughed and chided, “Foolish girl, at your age to speak such mad words! Your mother has done no great meritorious deeds, nor accumulated much virtue; how could she live so long? Besides, if your wish came true, two old women alive alone, with no one to care for them in life or send them off in death, the ancestral incense would not be kept burning—this would be no good at all. I think if a suitable man appears, one of good character regardless of family background, marry him off without fuss. If you truly love me, do not be so stubborn; this is far better than dying together.” Chunying nodded and agreed, saying, “I will obey mother’s decision and say no more.” Hearing this, Madam Hu was comforted.

Not long after, the house was robbed; everything in Madam Hu’s room was stolen clean. The authorities were notified, but the thieves left no trace. Madam Hu wept, saying, “Chunying, this is all because there is no man in the house, inviting scorn and boldness. If it were not thieves but open robbers, what could two women do but surrender? Stealing things is one matter, but if they dared assault my daughter, how could she live?!” At this she broke down in tears.

After some comforting, Chunying came up with an idea. She said, “Mother, do not worry. I have a plan. The thieves are bold because our house is full but people few. Why not rent out many unused rooms to suitable tenants? We do not seek high rent, only good, upright people who can be good neighbors and watch over the place. Even if no rent is charged, it is better than rooms lying empty and falling into ruin. Having decent people to share the house and care for it is good. Mother, what do you think?” Madam Hu agreed, and Chunying wrote a rental notice herself, posting it at the city office. Within three days, many came to inquire. But most were disreputable or had too many people. Madam Hu felt none were suitable. On the fourth morning, a young man in white came—a refined gentleman with a face like polished jade and lips like vermilion, gentle in manner and clear in speech. He said he was the son of an official family, drawn by Hangzhou’s serene mountains and waters, wishing to settle here. He said his father had been a high official but was deceased; his mother and siblings remained in Jianye, and once the house was rented, they would soon come to live with him.

Mother and daughter were greatly pleased at his bearing. Hearing he was from an official family with many people, all seemed ideal, so they agreed at once to rent to him. When asked about rent, Madam Hu said she valued good neighbors over money and would accept whatever he wished. The young man was not greedy and paid one hundred taels of silver as a deposit, saying his family would come later to discuss the rent. Seeing his generosity, Madam Hu trusted him more. When asked his name, he said Wang Chengfu, then left.

After more than half a month, Wang Chengfu returned, saying affairs in Jianye delayed his family’s move. He planned to study in Hangzhou with several servants, moving in first. Madam Hu and Chunying trusted him as a man of good character. Chengfu was pleased and immediately brought his fine belongings, all exquisite and elegant. Though the He family was wealthy with many treasures, Chengfu’s furnishings surpassed them all. He brought more than ten male and female servants. His style was grand and his character honest and diligent. Besides reading, he often talked with Madam Hu, saying she resembled his mother and respectfully calling her godmother; he treated Chunying as his sister, so no suspicion arose, and they met often. The brother and sister served Madam Hu joyfully, delighting her greatly. Madam Hu then wished to take Chengfu as son-in-law. She inquired of his servants and learned he was ambitious and proud, seeking a talented and beautiful wife, and was still unmarried. He was the same age as Chunying, twenty-five. Hearing this, Madam Hu was overjoyed and told Chunying.

Unknown to her, Chunying and Chengfu were truly a match of talent and beauty. Though newly acquainted, their feelings ran deep. Hearing her mother, Chunying blushed and shyly said, “Brother Wang is indeed a man of good character. Mother, do as you think best.” Madam Hu knew her daughter was eager. Yet she did not know Chengfu’s thoughts. With no matchmaker, only her brother He Deshan often came to visit and had met Chengfu several times. Chengfu called him uncle, showing close ties. No one else was available, so they sent for He Deshan to explain the matter.

He Deshan agreed and went to Chengfu. Chengfu was busy inside. Deshan coughed outside; Chengfu heard and came out, saying, “Uncle, what brings you here?” Deshan took his arm and entered, laughing, “I came specially to congratulate you.” Chengfu smiled and asked, “Uncle, you are elder; no joking please. What joy do I have to be congratulated for? Pray tell.” Deshan laughed and explained. Chengfu was delighted, saying, “If Sister Ying consents to marry me, I have no objection. But as a guest here, all must be simple. Please forgive godmother, uncle, and sister.” Deshan said, “We are all family now; why fuss over such formalities? If you are willing to marry in, all can be arranged.” Chengfu laughed, “Living under one roof is already like being married. After marriage, my mother and brothers will be cared for here. With both families together and close kin, what division remains?” Deshan agreed and reported back. Madam Hu and Chunying approved. Both families were not young; the match must be made soon. Deshan explained this to Chengfu, who agreed readily.

With the two households united, all affairs were convenient. They chose a date, bought some new furnishings, and that was enough. Both families were wealthy; everything else was ready, needing no last-minute arrangements. When the joyous day came, many relatives and friends came to celebrate. Though Chengfu was a guest, many friends came to help and congratulate. The joint celebration was lively indeed.

Three days after the wedding, the new couple first paid respects to their mother-in-law, then returned to the bride’s home. Madam Hu looked at daughter and son-in-law, noting their matching talents and bearing, a perfect couple, and her heart brimmed with joy. Since the families were united, Madam Hu worried Chengfu living outside might lack servants’ care; her daughter was pampered and unaccustomed to serving others. So she decided to move them into the main house, living together in one room. The other rooms were occupied by servants. Madam Hu’s greatest fear was that when Chengfu’s family arrived, they would take her beloved son-in-law away, like reclaiming a borrowed item. She often spoke of this to Chunying, but Chunying understood family bonds should unite all under one roof. Living in one room but separated inside and out, what division was there? So she never mentioned this to Chengfu.

Yet strange things happened. Chengfu always said his family was in Jianye but no word came. Though he said his mother would soon come to Hangzhou, three years passed with no sign. It seemed he cared nothing for his family. Madam Hu, old and dim, only wished her son-in-law and daughter near her, and preferred no one take him away. She ignored his family affairs. But Chunying, sharp and wise, noticed this oddity and could not help doubting. Often she hinted at her suspicions and watched Chengfu closely. Yet Chengfu seemed troubled and fearful when asked about his family, answering evasively and nervously. This only deepened Chunying’s doubts.

By now Chunying had given birth to twins twice. Remarkably, both births were preceded by dreams of golden dragons entering her sleep. Upon waking, she told Chengfu. He said, “These are signs of imperial destiny. Could the children have the fortune of the nine-five?” Fearing gossip, he warned her not to tell others. Chunying was half-believing. After three more years and two more twins, the same strange dreams recurred. This time the dream was clearer. She recognized the dragon’s form as unlike ordinary dragons, with a fierce aura that inspired awe. Upon hearing this, Chengfu’s face changed suddenly. Though still smiling, his expression revealed a sinister secret. Chunying’s heart turned over. Though married many years and deeply in love, she felt her husband’s sincerity was not complete. How could two people sharing a bed have secrets from each other? Might his origins be unclear? Thinking thus, her many longings piled upon her heart, and she found Chengfu truly strange. From then on she resolved to watch carefully and uncover his hidden secrets, telling no one.

Yet Chengfu was a careful man. After the birth of the second twins, Chunying probed his habits and words, but he showed no slip. Only regarding his family in Jianye was he silent, having spoken first and unable to explain. Whenever mother and daughter spoke of it, he made excuses or changed the subject. At last he gave a perfect reason: his birth mother was dead; the family in Jianye was his stepmother, a cruel and wicked woman with whom he could never live. His brothers were her sons, naturally siding with her. Honestly, he said, he came to Hangzhou because she drove him out. At first, he could not say this openly; later he wished to tell but felt a son should not slander his mother, so he kept silent. Now, seeing his wife suspicious, he must speak frankly to clear doubts. Speaking, he wept bitterly. His words were reasonable, and mother and daughter believed him. They feared the stepmother and brothers might come to Hangzhou, hoping to devise ways to keep them away forever. After this, Chunying’s doubts melted, and her love deepened.

Yet troubles caused by awkward people cannot be perfectly managed. One hot, sultry night, from Madam Hu down to the four children, all were cooling themselves in the back garden. Chengfu, weary of the children’s noise, lay alone on a short couch beneath the bean trellis, about a hundred paces from the others. After a while, a cool breeze arose, refreshing his spirit. Unconsciously, he drifted into sweet dreams. Madam Hu was playing with a little girl, unaware of him. Above the trellis hung a great snake. Near the trellis grew various fruit trees, each with bird nests. Madam Hu was kind-hearted and forbade servants from destroying nests, so they multiplied, nearly every tree bearing one or two. Suddenly she thought of her son-in-law sleeping beneath the trellis and worried about disturbing the snake and birds, fearing accidents.

With this thought, she carefully took the child and walked over. No more than ten steps, the birds cried out together and flew into the sky. Madam Hu cursed softly, “You little creatures are too timid! How kind I am—why do you flee so?” Before she finished, the grass rustled and the snake hissed, descending swiftly from the trellis and gliding away. Madam Hu nodded, patted the child’s shoulder, and laughed, “See how your father loves to sleep! If that snake had fallen on him, wouldn’t it have scared him to death?” No sooner said than, near the trellis, she looked up and screamed, dropping the child in fright. Madam Hu herself fell backward, fainting, frothing at the mouth, unconscious. The child cried loudly in fear and pain.

What did Madam Hu see? Why such terror? We shall see in the next chapter.
