# Chapter Seventy: Revealing the True Form That Frightened Tai Shui; A Dream Omen Breaks the Clouds of Doubt

Now it happened that Madam Hu was walking near the bean trellis. She opened her aged eyes to glance at her beloved son-in-law, and suddenly gave a loud scream, falling backward to the ground. The little girl she held in her arms—only four years old—was thrown down as well, crying and wailing loudly. After a moment, she looked toward the old man sleeping on the couch and screamed again wildly, then fainted alongside her mother-in-law. This sudden commotion had already roused Chengfu, who quickly sprang from his sleep, stumbled down, and helped Madam Hu up, then lifted the girl in his arms. At the same time, Chunying and two maidservants hurried over. Everyone was busy in the chaos, asking what had happened.

The little girl was the first to awaken. Seeing her father holding her, she cried out and struggled fiercely, pulling wildly at her mother’s clothes, saying, “Father is not a person! Father is not a person! I don’t want him to hold me!”

Chunying was greatly astonished at these words and quickly took the child away. At the same time, she anxiously questioned Chengfu about what had truly occurred. Chengfu, hearing the girl’s words, was puzzled and turned the matter over in his mind. He stood there dumbfounded, uneasy, until his wife pressed him for an answer. He said, “Even I do not understand what this is about. For now, we should quickly send your mother back and then sort out the matter. Everyone is here; it is no place for trouble.”

This remark reminded Chunying. So she took the girl and several children—who had also heard the news and come running. Chengfu stood for a moment, furrowed his brow, then suddenly struck his chest with a fierce look, and ordered the servants, “Attend to the young masters; do not let them run off.” Then, calling on his courage, he personally came to carry his mother-in-law. Chunying tried to stop him, but Chengfu said, “Mother-in-law is always fond of cleanliness, and she is my wife’s most proper and upright mother. Who else could carry her? As her son-in-law, I am like my own son; it matters not. Besides, the old lady likes me and would not think me unclean.” Chunying had no choice but to yield.

The group went ahead, with Chengfu carrying Madam Hu behind. They had already entered the garden gate, but Chengfu still walked slowly, some dozens of paces behind. Yet Chunying and the others clearly heard a faint sound from Madam Hu’s throat. Everyone thought she had awakened and were quite glad. Soon they all entered the main hall. Chengfu gently laid her on the bed and said, “Why does mother still not speak? Come, all of you look—she is like this, is it not already…”

He stopped himself from finishing the sentence. Chunying heard this and understood at once: her mother’s fate was dire. She hurriedly handed the child to the second maidservant and approached. She saw Madam Hu’s eyes bulging wildly, her tongue protruding from her mouth, as if strangled to death. Feeling her body, there was not a trace of lingering breath. Chunying immediately struck the bed and table, wailing to Heaven and Earth in grief. Chengfu, too, bent over the bedside, howling in sorrow.

After a time, the servants came to soothe them. Soon their maternal uncle Deshan, along with his wife Madam Zhang, son, and daughter, all arrived upon hearing the news. After a round of weeping, Chengfu spoke before anyone else: “Mother-in-law died in a most strange way, and her death was too bizarre. If someone had secretly harmed her, what great enmity could she have with anyone? Besides, I personally carried her in; all saw it. She never left my side until she reached the bed, and then she became like this. Could it be some strangling ghost or spirit, taking her life silently from my shoulder as she stumbled, perhaps in a stroke-like state? That might be so, but the matter is close to absurd. Uncle, you are our elder relative here; how do you think we should investigate this?”

Deshan was a sage in drunkenness: so long as he had good wine and meat, he would lend his head to be used. Hearing Chengfu’s account, he resolved to mind his own business and said, “Brother-in-law’s words are right. Your mother-in-law was carried into the room by you yourself; who could silently take her life from your shoulders? And, jokingly speaking, even if you wished to kill her, it would not be so easy.” Chengfu’s face darkened at this, about to speak, but Deshan continued: “Thinking carefully, apart from the strangling ghost you mentioned, there is no other explanation. In short, all this is the retribution of past-life grudges, now repaid in this life. The person is dead; it is urgent to handle the funeral. What use are these empty words?” Chengfu felt a great weight lift from his heart. They then raised their mourning and began the busy preparations for the funeral, which need not be recounted here.

As for Chunying, since last year when Chengfu explained the Jianye affair, her doubts had vanished. Yet, not long after, this strange funeral occurred. She thought her mother’s death was cruel and did not seem caused by fright or stroke. Moreover, the little girl, now four years old and somewhat aware, said: “That night, grandmother carried me to father’s side, but father was nowhere to be seen. Instead, there was a huge, enormous serpent, like the great dragon in the books my brother reads. Father wore only a pair of trousers, but those trousers were clearly wrapped around the lower half of that dragon-like, serpent-like thing. Grandmother was so frightened she fell down, throwing me down too. When I cried out, the thing vanished, and father rose from the couch to hold me. Mother and brothers came then. Even now, I tremble when I see father.”

Hearing this report, Chunying recalled the dreams surrounding the births of the four children and other past mysteries. She combined these questions into a great riddle. She felt that her beloved husband must be a reincarnation of a divine dragon, hence so many strange signs. Some omens he himself might not fully know, so he could not explain them. Regardless of his knowledge, such auspicious portents showed he was extraordinary, destined for great fortune. Thinking thus, she felt comforted.

Time passed swiftly. Several years later, Chengfu’s youngest daughter was now eleven or twelve years old. Chengfu no longer went out, nor did he have any notable or noble friends visiting. Though husband and wife’s affection remained unchanged, Chunying did not expect him to seek fame or fortune, titles or military rank. Yet as years waned, illusions multiplied, and her heart silently turned, she felt these strange phenomena lacked any foundation.

One day, Deshan and his wife came for a visit, just as Chengfu had gone out. Madam You, Deshan’s wife, was honest and sincere, always fond of Chunying. Chunying treated them like parents and spoke freely before them, words she might not dare say in Chengfu’s presence. That day, they casually spoke of Madam Hu’s strange death, which remained a mystery. Chunying had sent the children away and said to Madam You, “My niece has an unsolvable difficulty and long wished to consult uncle and aunt. Because the matter is delicate, I dared not speak lightly. Today, speaking of mother’s death, I cannot hold back the words long pent in my chest and must speak them to uncle and aunt.” They asked what great matter was so serious.

Chunying then detailed all her doubts about her husband, from the day of betrothal to Chengfu’s revealing his true form that frightened his mother to death, telling every detail. After finishing, she wept bitterly and said, “I knew mother’s days were old and sent her to an enemy, but he did not intend to kill her. Yet when the matter came out, our family was torn apart, and the children left to be raised by others. Because of his many strange signs, I suspected he was a gifted and extraordinary man, and I was foolishly hopeful that he might achieve great deeds, thus honoring mother’s memory and allowing her to rest in peace in the underworld. In Chengfu himself, this might count as some merit. I kept these thoughts inside and never revealed a word. Often, thinking of my departed mother, I pray she does not hate me for protecting my husband and not avenging her. Since mother’s death, I have turned over many thoughts about Chengfu. One moment, I want to expose that he frightened mother to death; whether he meant it or not, guilty or innocent, let the kings and laws judge. Then I think he might build a career, serve the country, and win posthumous honors for mother, thus gaining her forgiveness. These two thoughts have long dwelled in my heart, unresolved. But judging by his current state—uncle and aunt are here, so I do not speak lightly—he seems unlikely to become a hero or great man. I do not necessarily want him to bring glory to our family, but if he cannot accomplish anything, then my mother’s wish remains unfulfilled. That would be one thing, but the strangest is that he claims to be an ordinary man, yet he has these strange signs. If so many signs exist, why is there no retribution? Since childhood, I have read how many emperors and ministers showed extraordinary omens at birth, especially dreams of golden dragons, portending great nobility. Now, not only do our children have such dreams, but he himself reveals his true form in sleep. Such signs are remarkable. Why, then, does he show no sign of rising or flourishing? I still doubt this. I think you two elders, with your broad knowledge, must understand the truth behind this.”

Deshan was cautious and careful. Hearing this long discourse, he feared his nephew-in-law might truly act, not caring for fame or wealth but worrying for their own safety. After hearing, he was stunned, staring blankly at his wife, unable to answer Chunying’s questions. Madam You, though a woman, was braver than her husband. Seeing him thus, she laughed and said, “Niece, you should not say such things to your uncle. He is a man, but his courage is less than a mustard seed. Hearing this, he is so frightened his soul has fled to the Nine Heavens; how can he have any resolve?” Deshan blushed at her teasing and smiled awkwardly, “What are you saying? As an uncle, do I not wish my nephew-in-law to rise to greatness? But I blame my own ignorance. I cannot answer your questions. Since you say so, you must have insight. You are family, and you ask sincerely; why not speak frankly to put her mind at ease?” Madam You laughed and spat, “You call yourself a man, but for small matters you dare not speak and always push me forward to speak for you. Now, your niece, your own flesh and blood, asks a few casual questions. Whether you answer or not, what harm is there? If you cannot speak, then so be it. Why must you push it all onto me? Isn’t that ridiculous?” Deshan’s face reddened further. He tried to retort but lacked words, stammering until Madam You and Chunying laughed together. Chunying said, “Uncle is truly sincere, more straightforward than aunt. Since aunt says so, I hope you can help solve this mystery. Please tell your niece quickly.” Madam You smiled, “Niece, you are very amusing. You are clever and well-read; many men cannot match you. Could a simple country woman like me, unlearned and unversed, have greater insight? But speaking of country women, we do have our rural wisdom. I heard that outside the city, the Great Emperor Donghua is very efficacious. Many who seek blessings receive them, those who seek wealth gain it, those who seek children are granted them. Since you have doubts and we have leisure, why not prepare incense and candles and go ask the Great Emperor for a spirit oracle? Then we can understand the truth.”

This remark reminded Chunying, who said, “Aunt is quite right. The Emperor Donghua is indeed the most responsive deity. Luckily, he is not far from my home. Aunt, since you and uncle are both here, why not now? My nephew-in-law has gone out and said he will not return until evening. It is only midday; we can go quickly and quietly, keeping it from him entirely. Will you agree, uncle and aunt? Let us go at once.” Deshan and Madam You were pleased and immediately summoned a servant to prepare a sedan chair with incense and candles. The three rode in sedan chairs—Dragon’s sedan carried Chunying’s young son Maomao; Chunying herself took her daughter Nannan, along with one male and one female servant. The party of seven went straight to the Donghua Temple outside the city.

They all disembarked, and the servants took the children to play nearby. Chunying let her uncle and aunt first light incense, then she followed, kneeling with devotion and bowing several times. She prayed for a spirit oracle. The three gathered to look. The oracle slip bore no words—only a blank sheet of paper. They were puzzled. Chunying said, “We did not choose an auspicious day or purify ourselves with fasting and bathing. Surely the deity dislikes my insincerity and refuses to grant a sign.” Madam You advised her to try again. Chunying obeyed, knelt, and prayed silently and earnestly for a long time, then drew another slip. To their disbelief, it was the same blank slip. Madam You then tried on their behalf, but the result was the same. This left all three at a loss. Madam You said, “Surely one of us has offended the deity. The longer we stay, the more the Great Emperor is displeased. We should return quickly.” Chunying believed this and, their spirits dampened, they hurried home.

Chunying had gone to resolve doubts but only deepened them. That night, her mind was restless, tossing and turning through the night, disturbing Chengfu’s sleep. At first, he suspected she was ill and asked several times. Chunying, fearing his suspicion, forced herself to curl up motionless. Chengfu finally fell asleep, but Chunying remained restless until the third crow of the rooster at dawn, when weariness overtook her and she drifted into a dream.

In her dream appeared a young immortal, clad in Daoist robes and crown, holding a whisk. He said he was Zhongli Quan, disciple of the Emperor Donghua, and spoke thus: “By imperial decree, your husband has offended Heaven and repeatedly escaped punishment. Now his evil is full, and the Emperor commands me to execute judgment. Yet, considering his loyal nature and innocence, and that he was misled into marriage, I first warn you: should misfortune arise, flee quickly to your natal home. Do not harbor private affection or rashly act, lest you bring endless calamity upon yourself. Today, when you came to the temple for an oracle, the Emperor refused to reveal it, fearing the secret might leak. The demon is cunning; if he acts prematurely, it would be dangerous indeed. You must understand the stakes and be especially cautious. Take heed and beware, lest you regret it.” Having spoken, he departed.

Chunying awoke drenched in sweat, the dream vivid in her mind. Reflecting on the daytime oracle, she felt ill omens and little hope. Yet, recalling many years of marriage and knowing her husband’s proper nature, she wondered what great crime could bring Heaven’s punishment. Thinking this, she doubted the dream’s truth and would not fully believe it.

Just then, Chengfu awoke and saw Chunying staring blankly, deep in thought. He was puzzled and feared she might be ill, so he embraced her warmly and comforted her gently. He asked what she felt, but suddenly lost his usual composure. This only worsened matters. Chunying, moved by his care and tenderness, unconsciously forgot the immortal’s urgent warning. As a wife sharing weal and woe, whether the dream was true or false, she could hide it from others but not from her husband. So she told him everything she had seen and heard in the dream, holding his waist with both hands and whispering, “Brother, please think with me—how can such a dreadful dream not frighten one?”

She asked again, but Chengfu remained silent, which puzzled her. She leaned her rosy cheek close to his, pressing against his face, about to ask more—when suddenly his face turned cold as iron and ice. His eyes opened wide, staring blankly outside the curtain. Dawn’s light filtered in, revealing his terrifying expression. This frightened Chunying so much she screamed aloud.

Why Chengfu showed this strange demeanor remains to be revealed in the next chapter.
