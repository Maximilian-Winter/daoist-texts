# Chapter Seventy-One: The Demon Reveals True Intentions, Seducing a Virtuous Wife; Spreading Evil Arts, Stirring Storms on the Plain

Now, it happened that Chengfu, upon hearing Chunying recount the details of her dream, instantly changed color; his eyes widened in shock. Chunying’s rosy face, which had been pressed close against his, suddenly felt icy cold, as if she were clinging to cold steel itself. This sudden chill froze Chunying in place, unable to move, and she clung tightly to him, calling out anxiously.

After a moment, Chengfu let out a cold laugh and uttered words that terrified Chunying: “Ah, so it is the old Donghua who seeks to trouble me, sending this child to spy on me. He truly underestimates this old flood dragon.” At these words, Chunying was so startled that she released her hold, sitting upright abruptly. Her eyes, like autumn waters, opened wide with worry as she scrutinized Chengfu from head to waist, except for what was hidden from view. Only then did the old flood dragon realize he had spoken too freely, hastily forcing a smile and saying to Chunying, “Let me tell you, that was only to scare you. Who told you to frighten me with such vague, elusive dreams? Do you think you alone may scare me, but I may not return the favor? Look at yourself—what a state you’re in! Do you truly take dreams for reality, and see me as some heinous criminal, a primordial villain whom Heaven cannot tolerate? To be honest, I am neither so grand nor so qualified. You, clever as you are, take these baseless, groundless dreams as some grave matter, and first thing in the morning, you pester me with them. Ha! Where should I even begin to explain?”

Chunying noticed how unnatural his speech was. Though she knew he was deliberately hiding the truth, his evasions only made his furtive nature more apparent. Thinking it best to act decisively, she resolved to tell him about the divination she sought the day before. She wanted to see what excuses he might offer, and observe his demeanor closely. If she could uncover the truth, their bond as husband and wife might deepen; if he bore no great guilt, perhaps they could prepare early to repay karmic debts by making offerings at the City God’s temple and performing meritorious deeds to erase sins. But if he truly carried a vast crime, beyond Heaven’s mercy, she would decide whether to share his fate or to take their children elsewhere to survive—better than harboring silent dread forever.

Without hesitation, she recounted how he had revealed his true form before, how the divination had failed three times in a row with blank slips, and the dream’s details. She pressed him to confess any misdeeds. Chengfu only laughed coldly at the sky, refusing to answer. When Chunying finished, he asked, “If I am truly a great sinner, long overdue for Heaven’s punishment, my evil deeds full and my life at risk, what will you do, my beloved wife, who has loved me so deeply all these years?” Chunying was caught off guard and hesitated slightly. He continued, “Or if I am innocent, but others accuse me out of sectarian spite and seek to kill me, what then, dear wife?”

At this, Chunying blurted, “No need to say—I will help you resist our enemies. If misfortune befalls you, I will lead our children to avenge you, with no regrets until death.” Hearing this, Chengfu leapt up, stepped down from the bed, and bowed deeply to Chunying: “May my beloved wife never forget these words. I will now tell you all about my past and origins, so that your doubts may vanish like ice and tile shattered.”

Chunying returned his bow as she dressed, and the two sat side by side on the bed’s edge. Chengfu sighed and said, “In today’s world, not to mention the mundane mortal realm, even the Heavenly Emperors and immortals above have become nothing but a clique of self-serving factions. We are unfortunate to be born in such times, mingling with these selfish people, no wonder there is turmoil everywhere. Dear wife, I will speak honestly now, so do not be shocked. Though we have been husband and wife for many years, and have borne children, and even now sit shoulder to shoulder chatting on this bed, sharing daily life as equals, the truth is quite different. To speak plainly, I am not a mortal like you or others in this world—I am a golden dragon of the Western Sea, a dharma body cultivated for ten thousand years.” He glanced at Chunying’s expression.

Chunying was naturally astonished beyond words. Yet, since her mind had long harbored signs and suspicions that he was no ordinary man, much of her shock was softened, preventing her spirit from flying away or faltering. Moreover, having agreed to share life and death with Chengfu, and having asked him to reveal his true feelings, she forced herself to show calmness.

Still, Chengfu saw her face pale and her body tremble with fear. He smiled gently to comfort her: “Dear sister, do not be afraid. Am I not still a mortal like you? Everyone in this world has a past life—some are reincarnated beasts, others fallen immortals or gods. Who knows, dear sister, perhaps your past life was a star spirit or a ghost deity reborn? But you cannot know this yourself. I have never died since birth—not reincarnation, but transformation, and I can avoid death. In truth, you have inherited my essence and are not far from me. With cultivation, you too could reach a state of imperishability through kalpas. This is a rare chance many seek but few attain. You have gained it unwittingly—truly your great fortune, nothing to fear or dread.”

Though half in doubt, Chunying was more joyful than fearful and nodded. “If so, why have you hidden this truth all these years, never uttering a word?”

Chengfu replied, “I have long wished to tell you, to encourage you to cultivate early and attain true awakening. But one day, when I revealed my true form by accident, it frightened your mother to death. I feared that if I spoke openly, you would bear hatred for me as the cause of your mother’s death. Even if not, it would cause great distress and make cultivation difficult, wasting our affection.” Chunying nodded again and asked, “Since this was unintentional, how could I bear you ill will? But if you are an immortal, why marry a mortal woman like me?”

Chengfu laughed, “That is something you do not understand. The path of cultivation is endlessly varied. Some never approach women in their lifetime; others rely on the union of yin and yang to balance energies and refine elixirs, ascending to heaven by taking them. I belong to the latter, a member of a demonic school. Any woman I marry must have immortal fate. With diligent cultivation, she too will become immortal. We do not marry just any mortal; if she lacks immortal affinity, the union benefits her but harms me. Some lustful men marry women without spirit, wasting their essence and falling into the mortal world without hope of immortality, doomed to endless kalpa trials. Such things happen often. Thus, cultivation is extremely difficult. After a thousand years, many still fail at the gate of desire. Dangerous, isn’t it?”

Chunying smiled wryly, “Then you should be careful not to indulge in love too much, lest your millennia of cultivation be lost.”

Chengfu laughed, “I am not afraid of that. We most resent Heaven’s injustice, how cruelly it bullies us. From your dream and what that Zhongli Quan told you, it is clear they intend to destroy me.” Chunying grew anxious again, “Still, dreams are uncertain; perhaps it will not come to pass.”

Chengfu said coldly, “No, no. According to him, I have escaped Heaven’s punishment many times. This is true. They have repeatedly troubled my sect. I am the leader’s top disciple, the first among his followers. Next to the leader, I am their greatest enemy. They have tried every method to subdue me. In Daoism, few can match me. But one year, in Hua Hai village, many immortals came and were utterly defeated by me, scattered in flight. Having no other way, they resorted to a vile scheme: bribing my fellow disciple, a clam spirit, who betrayed me when I was off guard. I never dreamed such treachery. This caused me great loss.”

Chunying, moved by their bond, said angrily, “Only such people lack conscience—truly worthy of death! Do you know what that little demon gained by siding with them?” Chengfu hesitated, then smiled, “Such treacherous and cruel creatures have no bright future. I hear he now serves under a snail spirit, called ‘cultivator,’ but is treated like a slave. Clams outrank snails, yet they placed him beneath a snail spirit—such humiliation only he could endure. If he had any shame, he would not suffer such abuse. Otherwise, he would be destroyed for crimes big and small.”

“Since my defeat that year, I have been in hiding, following the leader’s orders. Because my fate is poor, I was told to lie low. ‘Your cultivation and potency surpass the current Dragon King of the Sea by many times. That Dragon King’s position should have been yours. But your pride made Heaven fear you and immortals envy you, so the peaceful couple took the position instead. Now their descendants govern the great seas, dividing them among four sons—Ao Guang, Ao Run, Ao Xiang, and Ao Gui. Inland rivers and lakes are guarded by their kin. You, a talented elder, have lost favor with Heaven and are deemed a sinner, with nowhere to dwell in the vast world and seas. Though you hide now in the East Sea by my power, when they learn of this, war will surely come. I wish to help you reclaim your rightful place, but first we must secure a base inland. The Qiantang River’s might and narrow mountain banks make it ideal. The peaceful wife once severed the dragon veins on both banks, barring the true dragon’s entry. There is a secret winding mountain path for covert access. To launch great deeds and achieve greatness, this is the best place.’ After a hundred years of quiet cultivation, I was to begin there.”

“Following orders, I hid in the sea for a hundred years, then accompanied my master to the Qiantang River’s mouth to survey the land. But they learned of this and sent the treacherous Xuan Zhu to guard Haining, along with a fox demon named Huitong and the peaceful couple and their sons, all scheming to trap me. They guarded Haining with heavy troops, especially during tides, making it impossible for me to enter or stand firm. I was furious and resolved to go ashore secretly, watching for their weak defenses. When they slackened, I could rise and unleash my power to draw the East Sea’s waters, flooding houses and people within a thousand li around Haining, creating a great flood reaching north to the Yangtze and east to the sea, to rival the peaceful couple. This would be a good tactic of retreat and defense. I told my master, who cautioned me to act carefully. I said, ‘They bully us too much. I will carry out this plan.’ My master warned caution, which I obeyed, but did not forbid my plan. I then took human form and came to Hangzhou. This is my history before meeting you.”

Chunying, now more familiar with him, found the flood dragon husband quite amiable, halving her fear. Hearing this, she smiled and said, “That’s my luck. If I had refused to marry you then, and you had begun your plan, wouldn’t we have perished together in ruin?”

Chengfu laughed heartily, “All things depend on Heaven’s destined fate. We were fated to meet and marry—how could you not marry me? But let me finish. I told you that immortals in my sect marry and bear children to resolve mundane ties, then use yin-yang harmonizing to refine elixirs and ascend. Finding no chance to act, I stayed here to settle this mundane bond. Coincidentally, my master sent a sword-light decree naming a woman of a certain surname, aged twenty-five, as my destined partner. That surname is yours. I was amazed how fate turned so swiftly. This shows our good fortune is fixed, and my marriage to you is Heaven’s will, done without my will.”

Chunying asked, “You have stayed here so long without action—was it because their defenses were too strong?”

Chengfu nodded, “Indeed. That Xuan Zhu is formidable. Before I came, another disciple disobeyed orders and secretly surveyed the Qiantang River, only to be driven off by Huitong. That disciple loved worldly splendor and foolishly sought a post with mortal emperors. Xuan Zhu found out and killed him. Truly tragic. Our master said he acted rashly and would suffer for it. He repeatedly warned us not to act prematurely or repeat such mistakes, lest we bring death upon ourselves. So I am very cautious here, not even leaving the gate or mingling with mortals, fearing premature exposure of plans.”

Suddenly, Chengfu stamped his foot, clenched his fist, and sighed deeply: “I never expected my wife to heed your mother’s words and seek some ghostly divination from old Donghua. This is clearly handing evidence to our enemies, accusing me of harboring your foes. I am your enemy’s husband! Alas, sister, I do not blame your curiosity. My suspicious behavior invites it. If I were you, I too would seek divine omens to know the truth. But alas, all my years of hiding and waiting have been utterly ruined.”

He glanced at Chunying, who was now frowning like spring mountains and clear as autumn waters, her face flushed, hands clenched tightly, as if with nowhere to hide, on the verge of tears. Chengfu hurried to comfort her: “Dear wife, please don’t be like this. I have said before, this is all fate and timing, nothing to do with you. Besides, hearing your words of loyalty and willingness to avenge me, I am deeply grateful. Even if misfortune comes, I am willing to die content.” Saying this, tears fell from his eyes. Chunying buried her face in his chest, sobbing uncontrollably. Chengfu comforted her until her grief subsided.

Wanting Chunying as an assistant and protector for their children and future vengeance, Chengfu taught her many magical arts, commanding her to memorize them well. Later that night, when all was quiet, he brought their four children to the garden’s grass. First, he revealed his true form to them, then chanted incantations, striking each child’s neck. Suddenly, all four children rose into the air, transforming into smaller flood dragons, flying and playing in the sky with great delight. Chunying, at first frightened, soon gained courage and asked, “Since the children can fly and transform, can I also change form and fly?”

Chengfu laughed heartily, “If you lacked such power, how could you claim immortal fate? Besides, we have been married many years, and you have absorbed much of my essence. This advantage surpasses ordinary cultivation tenfold. If you don’t believe me, try it yourself.” With that, he chanted again, no need to touch her, just blowing a breath and shouting, Chunying rose slowly into the clouds. Chengfu below traced talismanic symbols with his fingers and shouted spells. Chunying’s body moved involuntarily, instantly transforming into a flood dragon. Though her mind was clear, her body was out of control. Chengfu, fearing her fright, beckoned her down and struck her once, returning her to human form.

Chengfu then taught the mother and children how to draw water and create mist. Being of the same bloodline, they grasped it quickly with little instruction. Chengfu drew a bellyful of river water from outside the Yinglong Gate, leapt into the clouds, and sneezed downward, causing a heavy rain below. Landing, he asked, “Do you all understand? Have you learned it?” Before they could answer, a loud voice thundered from midair: “Bold demon flood dragon sneaking inland with evil designs, a crime beyond pardon, daring to seduce women! For such acts, you deserve death. I, by the decree of Patriarch Donghua, arrest you for punishment. Kneel with your children, bound, and you may yet be spared. Resist, and your entire family will perish within an hour!”

Chengfu and the others were shocked, looking up to see a young Daoist standing on a cloud, wielding a precious sword. Chunying shouted, “This is the demon sorcerer from my dream! He called himself Zhongli Quan—that must be him!” Chengfu, furious, leapt upward, revealing his true form, and charged at Zhongli Quan, mouth wide to swallow him whole.

Whether Zhongli Quan survived, remains to be seen in the next chapter.
