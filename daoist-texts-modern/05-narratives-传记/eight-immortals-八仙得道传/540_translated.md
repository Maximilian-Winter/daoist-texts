# Chapter Seventy-Two: The True Dao Overcomes the Demonic — The Divine Immortals Cast Their Spells; A Single Bucket Holds Half the Sea — The Dragon’s Wife Seeks Vengeance

Now it happened that Zhongli Quan, carrying out the decree of the Eastern Flower Emperor Sovereign, had subdued the dragon spirit and waited aloft in the empty sky for the right moment to strike. Yet this old dragon, heedless of retreat or advance, still trained his wives there, stirring clouds and summoning rain, disturbing the mortal realm below. Zhongli Quan’s patience wore thin; he manifested his form in the air and shouted aloud, “Demon dragon, cease your wickedness! I act by imperial decree to subdue you.” 

The old dragon and his wives heard the voice and recognized by Chunying’s discernment that it was the figure from their dreams. Enraged, the old dragon soared upward, revealing his true form, opening a blood-red maw wide to swallow Zhongli Quan whole. Seeing the ferocity of his foe, Zhongli Quan transformed himself into a dharmic body a hundred zhang long and ten zhou wide. But the old dragon’s magic was vast; seeing Zhongli Quan’s great size, he would not yield. Twisting his body, he stretched himself like a rainbow, as thick as a mountain, his original form restored.

Zhongli Quan laughed, “No fear of ugliness, demon slave! You come to measure size with me, to show your wives? My dharmic body can grow large enough to blot out heaven and cover the earth. No matter how you change, I can always overshadow you. But today’s matter is no game to play. I have no time for such trifles, lest we frighten the people below. Open your eyes and see—today I take your life.”

The old dragon made no reply, leaping forward again with mouth wide to bite. Zhongli Quan wielded his sword and cried, “Grow! Grow!” The sword lengthened thirty zhang to meet the dragon’s maw, thrusting deep. The old dragon, terrified, shrank back to his original size. Zhongli Quan pressed the attack, striking again, slicing off a great piece of the dragon’s head skin. Blood gushed like a flood, raining down for dozens of li, the stench overwhelming. The dragon, wounded and howling in pain, shook the mountains and hills. Quickly, he transformed into human form, drawing forth his hooked scythe spear forged from dragon essence to strike at Zhongli Quan.

Spear met sword, sword met spear, the battle lasting dozens of rounds. Zhongli Quan chanted true words, summoning a hundred thousand heavenly soldiers and generals, casting a celestial net that enclosed the old dragon like an iron barrel. The dragon’s body was pierced by dozens of swords, blood flowing ever more, the rain of blood growing heavier. Furious and with no outlet, the old dragon made a mighty leap, drawing in countless sea waters from the Eastern Sea’s corner, opening his great mouth to spray upon the assembled heavenly troops. In an instant, the upper, middle, and lower Three Realms all became a world of great rain. The lower reaches of the Qiantang River surged, transforming into a vast watery expanse.

The heavenly soldiers were forced back several steps, and the old dragon broke through their ranks, fighting desperately to flee. By chance, his four children, angered by their father’s losses, obeyed their mother’s command to come to his aid, each wielding weapons, bravely slaughtering foes, joining with the old dragon in hopes of escaping back to the mortal realm. But the flood was no small matter. The guardian of Haining, the Mysterious Pearl, had long neglected his watch, assuming the old dragon hid beneath the sea and dared not show his head. Only when the mountain torrents burst forth did he discover the dragon’s rampage. Knowing his grave fault, he hurried with his divine generals, swift as wind and lightning, to confront the threat.

Just as the old dragon and his sons reached mid-heaven, the Mysterious Pearl shouted, “Wretched beast, how dare you wreak havoc upon the people?” From all sides they encircled and attacked. The old dragon and his four sons fought separately. Before three rounds were complete, Zhongli Quan arrived with his divine troops, joining forces with the Mysterious Pearl. Together they slew the four young dragons, leaving only the old dragon alone. Sad, pained, and desperate, he dared not linger in battle. Transforming into an owl, he flew upward.

The Mysterious Pearl and Zhongli Quan searched for the old dragon in vain. By chance, Erlang Shen, on patrol through the Three Realms, saw the owl take flight. He transformed into a great eagle and swooped at the owl. The old dragon, alarmed, shifted again into an eel and slipped into the river. Erlang Shen revealed his true form and informed the Mysterious Pearl and Zhongli Quan before hastening away on official business. The two immortals restrained their troops and pursued into the river.

The eel was resting by the riverbank when Zhongli Quan pointed his sword tip, instantly freezing the water. Seeing the ice closing in, the old dragon hastily changed into a yellow dog and hid in a privy, swallowing filth. The two immortals, disgusted by the stench, held back.

Zhongli Quan smiled at the Mysterious Pearl and said, “Dao brother, behold this demon slave in such disgrace. Our treasures are forged from the numinous essence of Heaven and Earth, not for tasting or enjoyment. Please go and withdraw the floodwaters, saving the living beings. I will find someone to help me deal with this wretch.” The Mysterious Pearl complied, wielding his sword and sealing gestures to draw back the waters the old dragon had summoned.

Meanwhile, Zhongli Quan summoned the Lord of Thunder and the Mother of Lightning, explaining the situation and requesting their lightning to strike down the old dragon. The thunder deities assented and quickly began their rites. Zhongli Quan tightened the celestial net, leaving the old dragon no place to flee. Suddenly, beneath the bright blue sky, a great thunderclap shattered the air. The local people saw a great dragon blasted into seventeen or eighteen pieces, its remains and flesh strewn across seventeen or eighteen acres of fields.

Thus was the vicious Western Sea dragon, long a scourge and subject to Heaven’s judgment, finally eradicated.

Afterward, Zhongli Quan dismissed the divine troops and returned the imperial decree, reporting the Mysterious Pearl’s assistance and Erlang Shen’s merits. The Eastern Flower Emperor Sovereign smiled and said, “Erlang Shen’s help was as it should be. But as for the Mysterious Pearl, who normally guards a region, what was his duty? His one great trouble was this old dragon, yet he allowed it to hide within the land for decades without notice. In the end, it unleashed floods that harmed countless lives and property. Though he aided in the end, this cannot make up for his negligence. The Emperor has decreed: ‘He was originally a white crane perfected, but as punishment, he is to go to the banks of the Xiang River, still as a white crane, guarding the river’s narrow pass.’ Five hundred years hence, you and I must go to redeem him. For now, he must suffer hardship.”

With a slight sigh, he added, “Regarding this matter, the Mysterious Pearl was indeed negligent. Were it not for the wife’s cunning in piercing the mountain path and severing the dragon’s veins, the old dragon could not have entered the interior. This matter, when fully investigated, will reveal yet another great upheaval. But that is a tale for later. For now, after several decades, you must return to Hangzhou. There remains an unfinished business you must complete before your duty is discharged.”

Zhongli Quan asked, “What is this matter?” The Emperor Sovereign replied, “Though the old dragon and his young have all perished, his wife remains, determined to avenge her husband and children. This woman was originally without sin, but her method of vengeance is grievously mistaken. She believes our intervention to slay the dragon was prompted by her coming to our temple to seek divination. If the people of Hangzhou do not believe in our gods, she cannot enter the temple to burn incense. Without incense, her husband’s fate cannot be revealed, and thus the calamity would not have occurred. Following her husband’s teachings, she now cultivates day and night. When successful, she will draw half the Eastern Sea’s waters into a bucket and flood all Zhejiang, drowning the temple statues, the Mysterious Pearl’s dharmic body, and all the people and beasts of Zhejiang, to vent her grievance.”

Hearing this, Zhongli Quan was aghast, “I did not expect this woman to be so fierce and cruel.” The Emperor Sovereign sighed and said, “Her heart is worthy of death, yet her resolve is pitiable! You who descend to aid the masses, when encountering such a person, if she can be spared, you must preserve her. Only if she cannot be spared may you open the killing decree. This is your own way of cherishing blessings.”

Zhongli Quan knelt and accepted the command, asking, “Since the dragon’s wife harbors such vengeful intent, and if left to fester it will be difficult to eliminate her, or perhaps impossible to preserve her life, would it not be better to enlighten her early? To make her realize her husband’s death is his own fault, to advise her not to waste effort and bring about her own destruction? If she truly awakens and turns back to the Dao, she will have boundless blessings in the future. Is that not better than waiting until her crimes are fixed and then raising armies to destroy her?”

The Emperor Sovereign shook his head with a smile. “When a person suffers great trauma, it is hard for them to calm their heart quickly. You have slain her husband and children; she now holds deep hatred for you. Moreover, before the old dragon died, they had sworn to share life and death. Such a woman’s feelings run deepest and her heart is most intense. Now that her husband and children are all dead, her vengeful heart will not be dispelled by your words. As a lone woman in this world, living or dying, she feels that whether she avenges or not, death is certain. To die avenging means she will meet her deceased husband in the underworld; to betray their vow and live means a joyless life and no reunion after death. Thus her resolve is firm and unshakable.

As for your concern that this will breed future troubles, that is not certain. I calculate that though she has vengeful intent, she will harm no one in the end, and only suffer herself. Though we wish to preserve her, fate is fixed and there is no remedy. Her future depends on whether, after suffering, she can turn her heart and abandon evil. Then we may find a way to protect her.” Zhongli Quan took his orders and withdrew. The next day, he returned to Mount Hua by imperial command.

Time passed swiftly. More than ten years later, Zhongli Quan’s dao power grew purer, his merit deeper. He could now spirit-travel beyond form and foresee future events. One day, while quietly refining his primordial功 in a stone chamber, a sudden surge of heart-blood told him the Patriarch’s decree had arrived. Hastily straightening his robes, he stepped outside the grotto. In mid-heaven appeared a pair of red birds, descending upon the mountain and transforming into two youths. Zhongli Quan recognized them as the Patriarch’s blue and white attendants. He hurried forward, calling, “Junior brothers, you bring the Patriarch’s decree!” The youths smiled and greeted him. The Blue Youth said, “The Patriarch commands you to journey at once to Hangzhou.” The White Youth added, “What the matter is, you will know upon arrival.” Zhongli Quan understood at once—this was about the old dragon’s unfinished case from ten years past. He respectfully accepted the order and invited the youths inside, offering fine fruits from his mountain. The youths thanked him joyfully and departed.

Zhongli Quan wasted no time. Donning his usual attire and sword, he mounted a cloud and flew straight to the headwaters of the Qiantang River. Thinking that his usual form might hinder investigation—if he met the dragon’s wife, who had encountered him twice before, she might recognize him and prepare defenses—he transformed into an old woman. Using the earth-shrinking technique, he entered Hangzhou city and wandered about.

By now, a rumor had spread through Hangzhou: “The old dragon, shattered by thunder, still has a wife alive, preparing to avenge her husband. She is diligently forging a water bucket that can hold the entire Eastern Sea. When her cultivation succeeds, she will flood the land, wreaking havoc on the people.” This tale was widely known, from women to children.

Zhongli Quan overheard and casually stopped a passerby, asking where the rumor came from. The man replied, “The old woman is a local. How could she not know such a great matter? Now, inside and outside the city, everyone knows the dragon’s wife seeks revenge. Wealthy families are moving to other provinces; only the poor remain, with nothing to lose and nowhere to flee, resigned to fate.”

Zhongli Quan asked further, “This dragon’s wife must be a female dragon. Her husband was so powerful, yet was ground to flesh and blood, his life lost. Could her dao be higher than his?” The man laughed, “The old dragon rebelled and was crushed by heavenly soldiers. Whether divine beings came to protect us, how could mortals know? They say the Lord of Thunder and other immortals came together to smash the dragon into meat paste. But the blood rain and floods were enough for us to endure.”

Zhongli Quan pondered silently. The man babbled on, recounting ancient and recent events. Zhongli Quan responded politely, then asked, “If the female dragon causes mischief but has never issued notices or commands, how do you know?” The man answered, “There’s a story. The female dragon is not truly a dragon but a local lady of the Yin family, Miss Chunying. She was deceived by the old dragon and married him. After the old dragon died, the heavenly soldiers slew her four children. A fortunate woman was ruined, her family destroyed. She swore before her husband to avenge him, hence today’s events. She has an aunt who repeatedly urged her not to commit such heinous acts, but she refused. The aunt is a good woman, over sixty years old, who went door to door warning neighbors to prepare against floods. The story spread from one to two, two to three. Now no one is unaware. Yet many tough men say it’s nonsense, urging others not to believe. A former official, Lord Liu, accused the old woman of spreading rumors and deserved death. He reported to the authorities, who sent men to arrest her. Luckily, neighbors rose in defense, saying she was a good person wrongly accused. The uproar scared the palace into inaction.”

Zhongli Quan nodded, “I see. But is this avenging woman still in the city?” The man shook his head, “She is a daoist now, coming and going without trace, able to change endlessly and vanish. Who knows where she lives? But her aunt says she often returns home, visiting her husband’s grave yearly. So she comes and goes, but no one can find her.”

Zhongli Quan smiled, “Then please tell the people: the female dragon’s revenge is true. But the heavens have sent divine beings to subdue her. This time defenses are thorough; there will be no blood rain or floods. Those planning to move away should not act rashly. Those who stay may live in peace and prosperity. Do not panic and waste time or work.” Before he finished, the man scowled, spat several times at him, and cursed, “What damned old woman are you? I kindly tell you, and you joke with me. When the flood comes, our strong men might survive, but old hags like you will crawl underground to become fish food. See if you still joke then!”

With that, he turned and left, ignoring Zhongli Quan. Zhongli Quan laughed heartily, so much that the man glanced back unwittingly. A golden light flashed in his eyes as Zhongli Quan rose into the clouds. Many onlookers witnessed this spectacle. The man, terrified, knelt and kowtowed, shouting, “Great Immortal, forgive my blindness and rude words. I will obey your command and notify every household.” The crowd, seeing Zhongli Quan ascend, also bowed in reverence. Afterward, they asked the man what had happened. He gestured and recounted the entire story, calling witnesses, and spread the news throughout the city: “An immortal descended to subdue the female demon; Hangzhou’s people are safe from disaster.”

This news soon reached Chunying’s aunt, Lady You, a truly warm-hearted woman. She hurried to warn her niece with tears, begging her not to act rashly—to spare innocent lives and avoid repeating her husband’s tragic fate. But Chunying would not listen. She said, “I have long resolved to act. Success or failure, gain or loss, I do not ask. Alone in this world, life or death is the same. Let the heavenly gods and generals come to strike me down; death is my will. Honestly, living like this is no different from dying. Even if I succeed in revenge and vent my grievance, I will drown the Emperor Sovereign, the immortals, and most of the city’s people. My husband’s resentment may be eased, but I will remain as before. My only wish is peace of mind. If revenge succeeds, I will die and return to the truth, no longer wandering the mortal world. If I fail and die by divine hands, I can face my husband and children. Aunt, please take care of yourself and do not worry about me. Now that the world knows, the matter is urgent; I must act at once.”

Lady You, seeing her words fail, wept and left. Chunying transformed into an old woman’s guise, carrying the bucket she painstakingly forged. Following her husband’s secret method, she drew in the Eastern Sea’s vast waters, binding the bucket’s mouth with a thin cord. She bore it on her shoulder, intending to climb Hangzhou’s highest City God Mountain and pour the flood down from the heights, turning hundreds of li into a watery realm. She also prepared a sharp blade, planning to slit her throat and drown with the flood, joining all immortals and mortals in destruction, fulfilling her vow and her husband’s final promise.

After some travel, she reached the foot of City God Mountain, carrying the bucket step by step upward. At the mountain’s midpoint, she grew weary and set the bucket down to rest. Sitting a while, she gazed skyward—the blue sky clear as a painting; the wind in the pines whispered sorrowfully. Her heart stirred, recalling her life’s course.

From her father’s death, her mother’s nurturing, her arranged marriage, years of toil and care. She had found a good husband in Wang Chengfu, hoping to entrust her future to him, securing peace for mother and daughter. Yet tragedy struck then. Her mother died frightened by Chengfu’s true form; she was left alone, homeless. Now she must bear the burden of revenge. Whether she succeeds is unknown, but this life’s ties seem at their end. She wondered about her ill fate, her life and afterlife. Thinking thus, her heart felt as if cut by knives. Seeing no one around, she looked up and wept aloud.

Suddenly, a voice behind asked, “Madam, what troubles bring you here alone on this mountainside, so sorrowful?” Chunying started and turned to see an unfamiliar girl.

Who this child might be, we shall see in the next chapter.
