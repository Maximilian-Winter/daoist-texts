# Chapter Seventy-Three: The Matron’s Heart Urges Reform — A Single Breath Drains the Ocean

Now it is said that when a person is about to die, aside from the natural decline of age and fading breath—like oil spent and a lamp extinguished, flickering and faint—those who reach the full span of their allotted years pass quietly. Yet for those in the prime of life, strong and vigorous, who perish suddenly from grave illness or by their own hand, though the body dies, their vital breath does not disperse. After death, such souls may indeed become malevolent spirits. And in the final moments before passing, there must be many reflections—sometimes looking back upon one’s life, sometimes pondering the days to come. In any case, there remains an undeniable reluctance to part from the world that once bore them; this is an unshakable truth.

In the previous chapter, we spoke of the old flood dragon’s wife, Miss Chunying, who, clutching a heart full of grief and fury, bore the weight of half an ocean upon her shoulders. She intended to ascend to the summit of the City God’s Mountain and, from that lofty vantage, enact her will upon the world in its entirety. Cruel, yes—cruel to the utmost extreme. Tragic, indeed—tragic beyond all measure. And especially coming from the hand of a woman, this cruelty and tragedy took on a form unseen since the dawn of Heaven and Earth. The gentlemen scholars, all refined and discerning men of great virtue, upon suddenly encountering this tale, did not blame the author for exaggeration. Yet regarding Miss Chunying herself, they could not bring themselves to believe she was an ordinary mortal. This much can be declared without hesitation. And according to the author’s knowledge, the matter was indeed as cruel and tragic as told. The one who led these affairs was truly a matron born of gentle birth. Because of this, before she took action, she had a series of reflections deeply in accord with human feeling. From these reflections, by discerning her character and inclinations, it becomes even clearer that Miss Chunying was not the cruel and tragic figure previously described; rather, she was a woman of great purity, chastity, and tender sympathy.

Precisely because of this, the gentlemen scholars found the disparity between the woman and the deeds ever more incomprehensible. The author dares to sum it up in a single phrase: No matter the size of the matter, it depends on the person’s resolve and spirit. When will is as firm as a mountain and energy as vast as the sea, even a frail woman may undertake the greatest affairs of the world. Otherwise, even if one holds power to govern the realm, yet fears to act decisively, one will only become a feeble, weak ruler—an ineffectual monarch unworthy of mention. Enough idle words; it is time to strike and swiftly turn to the main narrative.

At that moment, Miss Chunying was lost in recollection of past events, her heart torn with grief as she gazed upward in a great lament. Suddenly, a voice spoke from behind her: “Madam, why do you grieve so deeply? Why have you come to this mid-mountain place to wail aloud? Could it be that some great injustice weighs upon you?” Chunying turned to look and saw a young girl with hair tied low, standing smiling atop a mountain rock, gazing at her with unblinking eyes. Chunying had no mind to engage, but seeing the girl’s lively charm, delicate beauty, and keen intelligence, she found her very endearing and felt a reluctance to ignore her. Then she recalled her own childhood, when she loved to climb mountains and wade through waters, and was fond of meddling in others’ affairs. Whenever she went out and encountered the poor or despairing, she would strive to help them. Now seeing this child bore some resemblance in appearance and spirit, fond of meddling and fond of the hills and woods—just like herself—her withered heart suddenly felt as if bathed in dew, stirring faintly to life. Her mind’s sanctuary, pondering these things, knew not whether to taste bitterness or sweetness, sour or sharp—yet she cared not to analyze it. In any case, she no longer had the courage to refuse the girl’s questions; that was certain.

So she wiped away her tears, stifled her sorrow, and nodded to the girl, saying: “Young maiden, you are among the most upright and joyful of Heaven and Earth, and the happiest in the human world. How could you know that under the same Heaven, the same world, and the same life, from youth to maturity, one might suddenly, without cause or awareness, step onto a path no human should tread? The joys and happiness of youth all turn to their opposite ends. At such times, one truly feels born unwillingly, and death cannot come swiftly. Young maiden, tell me, is such a life easy to endure? Can one continue living thus? But… ah, sweet young maiden, kind little sister, how can these words enter your ears now? Not to speak of others, even I myself, when I was your age, if someone had spoken thus to me, I might not have believed it. You are warm-hearted and caring, yet I cannot answer you. Not only cannot, but need not. For if I told you all, you might not believe. I have no need to waste this precious time entangling with you. Please forgive me, young maiden, I must go now. Farewell.”

Having said this, she rose, hoisted her water bucket, and hurried away. The girl laughed and stepped forward, catching hold of the bucket, saying: “Mother, don’t go. Even if you do not tell me, I will not ask to trouble you further. But why rush off so hastily? The day is still young; why not sit a while longer?” Chunying found herself held fast by the bucket, unable to break free. Hearing the girl call her “mother” so affectionately, her heart stirred once more, suddenly recalling her own children. Without knowing why, she halted, her whole body numb, staring blankly at the girl, unable to move. The girl quickly took the bucket from her hands and placed it on a stone seat, smiling gently: “Mother, don’t be impatient. Whatever hardships you face, find a way—step by step—to pass through. Surely after bitterness comes sweetness; the days of happiness lie ahead!”

Hearing this, tears poured from Chunying’s eyes like rain. Though she said she had no time to sit, her body unknowingly sank down, and she wept aloud, wailing to the heavens. The girl comforted her for a time, and seeing her unable to stop crying, sat silently waiting. Chunying’s heart was naturally grateful; she wiped away her tears and choked out: “I understand your kindness, young maiden. But I cannot accept your words. For in this world, I have long been utterly alone. I cannot create fortune for myself, nor have I kin or flesh to share even a spark of happiness. So my life can be said to have no path forward. If there is no path for life, how much less for happiness? Thanks to your kindness, though we are but strangers passing in the water, I am deeply grateful for your concern. Ten years ago, I saw Heaven filled with righteous gods, and the mortal world with good people. But in the last ten years, not only have I found no good person in the world, I have found no upright immortal in the heavenly courts. Perhaps it is my dire circumstances and narrow vision. Yet knowing this, and having no fierce spirit left to change it, I cannot rest without thinking all gods and humans are corrupt. Young maiden, do not mock or blame me. I now wish I could tell you all my story, but… ah… truly… you are a kind soul. If you are truly blessed… no, no… I see in you a refined beauty and wisdom, a bright and full forehead, a face radiant with uprightness and compassion, a demeanor revealing depth and grace, neither vulgar nor frivolous. Surely you possess great fortune and good luck. Since this is so, I may venture a guess: not long from now, you will come to know what sort of person I am; what immense sorrow, resentment, loneliness, and bitterness I bear; why I have come to this mountain; what I intend to do; and how it will all end. These are things you need not ask about, for you will perceive them clearly. For now, you see only an old woman, powerless and worthless. But, young maiden, alas… I cannot speak in detail today. In brief, I can say I am no ordinary old woman. The calamities I have endured are beyond what any common woman could bear. Thus my affairs are unlike those of ordinary women, and may form stories told now, in the future, and even thousands of years hence. Young maiden, do you think this old woman is formidable or not? You must understand that for me to possess such great power to stir the hearts of all people and endure unwaning through the ages, what force or influence could bring me to this state? No, no, no, I am but a woman. How could I wield such power and effect? Simply put, this is the outcome of the terrible tribulations I suffered ten years ago. From my story alone, you may judge the weight of my sorrow. Do not say a woman’s life and death could merit great deeds. How then could it be so formidable? So, young maiden, our idle talk today leaves no record, no proof. Soon enough you will know. Whether my words are true or exaggerated, you may judge for yourself. There is no need for me to swear oaths or offer needless evidence. But I must say one important thing first. The legend of my enduring fame among the people is not self-praise, nor tales of merit or benefit to the world. Frankly, it is a great evil, worthy only of scorn and hatred.”

At this, the girl could not help but smile and ask: “Mother, I believe all you say. But from your meaning, it seems you are about to do a great evil, intending to harm many people. Is this so? Though I dare not ask what crime it is, I cannot fathom why anyone would knowingly do harm, knowing it will hurt others. I see you as a person of great righteousness. Why then, knowing this evil, would you still commit it? Moreover, if there were some benefit to you in doing so, that might be understandable. But hearing your words, it seems you seek no gain, and after doing this deed, you yourself wish no longer to live among men, yet you will be reviled and cursed for all eternity. Why endure such pain? Though I am but a child, taught by my parents to read and understand, and knowing something of how to be a person, I truly do not understand your words and actions today.”

Chunying, hearing her clear speech and sharp tongue, was greatly surprised. She looked the girl over from head to foot, then sighed and said: “This matter is beyond your understanding. If you ask too much, you will become a foolish child. In short, my affairs stem from tragic encounters beyond human reason, and so my actions defy common logic. If one judged all by reason and feeling, I should not exist in this world. And since I exist, I should not suffer such incongruous consequences. Young maiden, I deeply appreciate your heartfelt counsel. Our meeting in this life is too soon for your youth, too late for my affairs. We are not suited to be close companions. If fate wills, in the next life we shall be friends and kin. I would gladly accept your teachings and strive to be a good person within reason. As for this life, our meeting and parting are one and the same moment. Even if we could be friends, the time is far too brief. Yet I must solemnly declare: I am not speaking to you of my ten years of suffering and my loss of faith in gods and men. Seeing you now, I dare no longer hold such bitterness. Our sudden meeting and your tender, earnest counsel have brought a swift and profound change to my heart. I no longer dare say that Heaven and Earth are filled only with demons. I think all misfortune is my own peculiar fate, unrelated to Heaven, Earth, or gods. Thinking thus, my spirit is much calmer. Young maiden, this is your gift to me in a short time. The ancients said, ‘To hear the dao early, death at dusk is acceptable.’ Today, your teaching is a kind of hearing the dao. I feel my heart transformed, my body and mind refreshed. Alas! I never expected that after more than ten years of arrogant views, in a moment, your innocent heart would restore me. Young maiden, you are truly a good physician of my conscience. You have healed part of my dead conscience. Even if my body dies, this healed conscience will remember you gratefully through reincarnations, even in hell.”

The girl, seeing her speak so earnestly and with such emotion, showed a hesitant, gentle expression, then smiled and asked: “Mother, I dare not accept your words. But since you hold your conscience dear, why commit such harm? You yourself would not harm your own self, preserving this part of your conscience. Consider the many lives and properties harmed—compare their weight to your conscience. Which is lighter, which heavier? Why value yourself so highly and treat others so lightly? If you cherish your conscience yet do evil, how will you justify yourself?”

Chunying was stunned, silent for a long while, then suddenly laughed and said: “Young maiden, I truly do not believe one so young could possess such knowledge and eloquence. In a few words, you have left this world-weary, aged woman speechless. But, young maiden, I beg your love and forgiveness. I have said before, my affairs are not matters of ordinary reason. From my tribulations to my final ruin, all is beyond human feeling and common logic. You may dismiss reason and feeling. My theory you may accept, but my actions follow another path, beyond debate. I can only accept your goodwill.”

The girl, seeing her so resolute, was taken aback. The two sat facing each other in silence for some time. Chunying suddenly rose, forced a smile, and said: “Young maiden, let us part. The day grows late. Though no tigers or leopards lurk here, many wicked men do. You have been out long enough; you should return lest your parents worry. If fate allows, I hope we meet again in another life and form lasting bonds. As I say this, my throat is half hoarse.” The girl, hearing this, was moved, her cheeks flushed with tears. Chunying suddenly lifted her bucket, her face pale, forced a bitter smile, said nothing more, turned, and hurried away.

The girl, seeing her leave, hurried after her, still holding the bucket, and said mournfully: “Mother, you must go, to do your work. I dare not detain you, nor wish to waste your time. But our meeting today is no accident. Please give me something as a keepsake. Seeing your expression, I will never forget you. I wish to keep you with me always. If that is impossible, give me something to remember you by, so I may see it and think of you, as if we were always together. Mother, will you do this?”

Hearing these sincere words, Chunying felt she could no longer refuse. But she had nothing to give. While pondering, the girl said: “If you have nothing to give, please let me drink some water from your bucket. If I carry your water within me, I will remember you every time I eat or drink. Our time together in the mountain will feel like we never part. Mother, what do you say?” Chunying smiled and said: “That is well. Young maiden, come drink.” She sat again, opened the bucket lid, and handed it to the girl.

The girl peered into the bucket, then shook her head: “No, no.” Chunying asked anxiously: “Why not? Is the water unclean? It is seawater, salty but fresh.” The girl smiled and said: “Not so. I see you rise unwilling to part with this bucket. Surely this water is of great use. What if I drink it all? What then?” Chunying laughed heartily: “Young maiden, do not belittle this little water. If it were only for drinking, it would last at least…” She stopped herself, regretting the loose words. Such matters should not be told. She closed her mouth and changed tone: “Young maiden, drink freely. Do not spare this water on my account. If you can finish it, I shall gladly be your host.” The girl laughed: “If you say so generously, mother, do not regret it later and make me spit it back. I have the power to do so, but the dirty water would only serve as fertilizer for your fields.” Chunying, amused and fond, yet somewhat impatient, said: “No teasing. Drink quickly. I will not regret it, nor want you to return it.” Hearing this, the girl smiled and tilted the bucket to her small mouth. After a few gulps, she raised the bucket upside down, shaking it at Chunying: “Mother, you truly deceive me. There is only a little water here. How can you call it half an ocean?” Before she finished, Chunying was so startled she fell to the ground, speechless for a long while.

Who is this girl? How does she carry such a great belly, holding half the ocean’s water? See the next chapter for the answer.
