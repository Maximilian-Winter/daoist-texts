# Chapter Seventy-Four: He’s Daughter’s Delusion and Suppression; Immortal Zhang’s Compassion Grants the Water’s Radiance

Now it happened that Chunying had gathered a small bucket of water, yet within it was contained half the volume of the Eastern Sea, prepared to flood all the temples and houses inside and outside Hang City, drowning lives and possessions alike. But in the mid-mountain, she encountered a tiny girl, and with earnest diligence she engaged her in conversation for a long while. At last, the girl drank down all the vast water—half a sea in that bucket—in one gulp, gulping it dry without a drop remaining. This sudden act so terrified Chunying that she collapsed to the ground, motionless for a long while.

The girl, seeing her in such a state, hurried over and helped her up, saying, “Mother, I thought you wouldn’t bear to let me finish your water. It’s not for this little water that you grieve so deeply. Now that the water is all gone, honestly, I only wished to show my sincere heart, so that I might never forget you. As for how much I can drink, mother, don’t be fooled by my small body and narrow belly. If I tried my best, even if you gave me ten or eight more buckets, it still wouldn’t quench my thirst.”

Chunying, supported by her, sat upon a stone and fixed her gaze fiercely on the girl, then burst into tears again, saying, “Very well, I recognize you. You are no true girl at all. You are none other than Zhongli Quan, whom the Old Elder of the Eastern Flower sent to kill my husband and children. Now that you know I intend to avenge my husband, you have come specially to take me. I had planned that today’s deed would bring me and all gods and living beings to perish together. I have already hinted at this to you. If you do not believe me, I still have a sharp blade here. See what use it is? Frankly, I have told you everything. Whether I avenge or not, it matters not to me. If I succeed, I die; if I fail, I die. In any case, with this one act, my conscience after death can be clear before Heaven and Earth, and I can meet my late husband and four children in the underworld with no shame. Now that I have met you, my foe has arrived. I have cultivated for many years, inheriting my late husband’s lingering spirit and his dying instructions. Only thus have I learned some small arts. To gather a bucket of sea water has cost me ten years of effort, not to mention the peril of collecting it. How could I have known that with one light sip you would drink it all dry? This shows how much greater your power is than mine, beyond all measure. Thus, the outcome between us is already decided. Even if I recklessly engage you in fierce battle again, the result would be no different. Why then make such a fuss?”

Hearing her reveal her intentions, Zhongli Quan no longer concealed himself. Raising the tablet in his hand, he waved it once, instantly transforming back into a youthful Daoist with pale face and red lips, just as before. Because she spoke so pitifully and with such sincere grief, he truly could not bear to harm her. He reasoned with her again and again, explaining that her mother had indeed been crushed to death by the old flood dragon, urging her to abandon the dragon, turn her heart, and cultivate the correct dao. He said, “In the future, your attainment will be assured, your blessings boundless. Why give your whole life’s happiness into the hands of your mother’s murderer? Even if we had not met today, your vengeance for your husband would be complete and clear. Yet the world and future generations will likely judge you harshly, for your loyalty to husband and children cannot outweigh the guilt of filial impiety. The stakes of right and wrong here are very clear, needing no explanation or thought. How could someone as supremely wise as you fail to understand this?”

Zhongli Quan’s words were concise and clear, reason flowing smoothly. As he said, the stakes of right and wrong were indeed very clear. Anyone with even a modicum of adaptability would, upon hearing this, surely awaken in sudden understanding, turn around, and immediately leap from the path of delusion to seek a new life—losing something at the east but gaining at the mulberry sunset. Alas, Chunying was by nature stubborn. Once she trusted someone, she never doubted them again. If anyone said she lacked virtue, even with proof, she would not change her mind. If she fixed upon a decision about how things should be, she would never turn back, throwing herself into it with all her might, regardless of success or failure. Once her mind was set, she would not allow herself to slacken even a fraction of her effort. In truth, such a person is the most admirable and hopeful in the world. Yet such character also bears great danger: errors in observation and mistaken views. Their will is strongest, their faith most intense. For those they trust, this faith and perseverance are proper. But if they encounter falsehood or error, they will believe and insist just as strongly, elevating the false to full stature and sacrificing themselves to pursue the mistaken cause. This leads to error from head to foot, from life to dead end, and even at death’s door they will not believe their harmers are evil or their deeds wrong. This is exactly what the ancients called a colossal error forged from the iron of the nine provinces. Is there anything more dangerous or fearful in the world?

Gentle readers, having read the previous chapters, may roughly understand Chunying’s nature as belonging to this type. And fate had dealt her a frightful and terrible matter. First, she firmly believed her husband was a true immortal, a seed of deep affection; those who fought and slew him were evil spirits and demons of the wrong path. Secondly, she was married to such a loving and righteous husband and had vowed before him to avenge him. Having spoken it, how could she not act? Knowing her power was limited, she cared not for success or failure, only that her heart was at peace. Such great spirit and tenacity, rare even among men, much less a widow without strength or courage, commands respect and sympathy. Yet the one she met was a deceitful demon, her mother’s murderer. Thus, what she regarded as a matter demanding all her strength and life became a blind and senseless act. Yet her stubborn nature could it be persuaded? The more Zhongli Quan declared the old flood dragon worthless, the more she hated him with clenched teeth, the more resolute she became to hold on to her last breath and never relent.

This situation, born of Chunying’s stubbornness and self-harm, was also fated in some measure. Thus, before sending Zhongli Quan, the Eastern Flower Emperor had foreseen that Chunying could never be persuaded to submit. Zhongli Quan, having cultivated for centuries and studied the secret jade void scriptures, could guess this at once. Knowing it was futile yet not sparing words was only to fulfill his heart’s wish to do good.

Enough idle talk. Chunying heard Zhongli Quan’s admonitions as autumn wind passing her ear, paying no heed, only demanding he grant her death swiftly. Zhongli Quan first hesitated to strike, but when she said, “You are my enemy. If you do not kill me, I cannot spare your life. If you flee elsewhere, I will still gather water from all the seas to flood the city. I would rather wait for you to come drink my water and then give you my life,” he knew the master’s prediction was true. This woman’s stubbornness was innate, beyond human persuasion or rescue. Better to imprison her for now; perhaps over time her nature might soften, and then persuading her to return to the correct path might be more effective. But to see such a steadfast woman suffer torment at another’s hand—how could he find peace? Tears of compassion silently fell as he spoke to her grimly, “Madam, this is my last counsel to you. The old flood dragon is truly your mother’s murderer. As custom holds, a parent’s enemy is one with whom there is no common sky. You only know to avenge your husband, but do not know that your enemy is also your own. Before, you were deceived and thought him a loving husband. Now that I have proven it for you, if you do not believe, you are truly the most foolish and unfilial person in the world. I pity you suffer without cause, respect your pure loyalty and honest nature, so I have asked the Patriarch to guide you repeatedly. I hope you will pull back from the brink, turn around, and ascend the shore. Cultivate your heart and nurture your nature, return to the dao gate. I, though unworthy, can still guide you somewhat. When you have thoroughly understood life, attained the supreme dao, freed yourself from the mundane, and ascended to the immortal abode to live with sun and moon, Heaven and Earth, would that not be the greatest joy in the world? You are wise beyond measure—please consider carefully.”

Zhongli Quan spoke with utmost sorrow. Chunying, however, only heard the words “return to the dao gate” and coldly replied, “No need to say. My late husband told me your sects are divided, each with masters and slaves, each building factions and opposing others. My husband was slain because he refused to conform to your teaching, and my four children died by your hands as well. Such hatred is nearly as great as that of those who share no sky. I only know that to betray one’s husband is unrighteous; to forget one’s children is unkind; to avenge is not courage; to serve one’s enemy with a smiling face is shameless. Such unrighteous, unkind, cowardly, shameless people deserve shame in the world. If you truly have a merciful heart, lend me your sword and kill me quickly. Fulfill my will and give me solace. As for your baseless words and false righteousness, though I am ignorant, I will not fall for them.” With that, she stretched out her neck and called, “Please punish me.”

Seeing her so deluded, Zhongli Quan felt some regret. He stepped back three paces and shouted sternly, “Madam, listen well. Since you insist on your delusion, I must carry out Heaven’s judgment according to law. But my precious sword will not slay the innocent. I will now imprison you beneath this mountain, grant you a fasting pill. When you grow hungry, swallow it, and you shall never know hunger or thirst again. If you can turn your heart, there will be a day of release. Moreover, Heaven’s decree has destined that one day someone will come to save you. Be patient and endure.”

Having spoken, he covered his face, cast down a red pill, then raised a hand and pressed it once upon Chunying’s body. A great rumbling sound shook the half city god mountain, overturning it. Chunying was sealed in a stone cavern beneath the mountain. Soon she transformed into a female flood dragon, crouching within. At first she endured hunger and thirst, wishing for death. When she could no longer bear it, she swallowed the pill. The immortal medicine was potent; from then on she felt no hunger or thirst. Yet imprisoned deep in the mountain, unable to move, she grew ever more hateful of Zhongli Quan, who wished to persuade her to cultivate the dao, while she only burned with bitter hatred. Such a half-dead, half-alive existence was worse than death.

Fortunately, the cavern was naturally formed and, placed by Zhongli Quan beneath the mid-mountain, was not cramped. After long residence, she grew accustomed and at ease, feeling no suffocation—only lacking sunlight and unable to distinguish day from night. Her heart was that of a flood dragon, uneasy without water. Though there was mountain water, it was not enough for her to move freely, nor did she know when she might see the light again. Whenever she thought of this, she felt deeply ashamed.

Until the Southern Song era, when Xu Jingyang, having cultivated the Great Dao and been conferred the title of Perfected One, wandered here, charmed by the mountain’s beauty, lingering long. Suddenly he sensed the presence of lingering resentment on the mountaintop. Counting on his fingers, he knew the cause. So he exerted great power, sending his voice into the cavern, asking if she had anything to say.

The female flood dragon, imprisoned so long, hearing a human voice was a thousand times more delightful than hearing footsteps in an empty valley. She cried out, begging to be moved to a place with water and to see the sky often. Xu Jingyang’s heart softened; he used his power to move her to a water source. He drew a talisman and dug a great hole, allowing sunlight to enter.

By chance, the local people wished to dig a great well here. Now the flat earth cracked open a hole, and the crowd marveled, probing and finding deep spring water below. They rejoiced, thinking it a heavenly bestowed immortal well. They fenced the original hole with stone railings, making it a large well. From then on, though the female flood dragon remained underground, she had water to swim in and light to see by. The Perfected One feared she might escape the well, so he sealed her with a talisman, preventing her from leaving, and taught her many methods to cultivate heart and nourish qi, commanding her to practice diligently and not waste her time underground. The dragon gratefully accepted and asked when she might emerge. The Perfected One said, “The realm is created by the mind; if the mind is correct, the realm is vast. To know when you will emerge, ask yourself when you might see your true nature and illuminate your heart.”

The dragon then recounted her life’s grievances and injustices. The Perfected One laughed, “You are innocent; this hardship you brought upon yourself. I know all past matters; no need to say more. To cultivate the true dao, mountain dwelling and cave abode are all the same. If you apply your heart to cultivation, becoming Buddha or immortal, this place can be your starting point. When your great work is complete, do not say these humble talismans will vanish on their own; you may even have celestial gods descend to welcome your ascent. Why rush to emerge? Wandering the mortal world only entangles the heart with worries—what good does it do? As for your cultivation period, if you are diligent and unchanging, roughly three thousand years will bring success. If your nature is simple and desires few things, progress is easier than most. I say three thousand years because your attachments run deep. Though proper attachments, they are not fit for cultivation. Because of this, I have calculated that only then can your power and dao practice erase your husband’s sins. You yourself may become a celestial immortal, and your husband may share your light, escaping hell to become an immortal body. Know that the three thousand years of merit are not for you alone!”

The dragon wept, “Master, does this mean my husband, who died so cruelly, must still suffer hell’s torment?” The Perfected One laughed heartily, “Your husband’s crimes are beyond telling. What Zhongli Immortal told you is all true, yet you refuse to believe. If judged by his deeds and the harm he caused to people and creatures, it is fitting he dwell for millions of years beneath the eighteen layers of hell. How lightly you speak of it! Even when I say he may share your light after three thousand years, that only means by such means. It does not mean that once you become a celestial immortal, you can immediately rescue him from prison and transform him into an immortal body. In truth, it depends on whether he repents and cultivates diligently. Honestly, even with your merit, you can only pull him out of hell to qualify for cultivation. If a wife’s attainment could lift any wicked husband to heaven, would that not be a world of favoritism and corruption?”

The dragon fell silent. The Perfected One comforted her, “Do not be impatient or resentful. As the saying goes, ‘Only those who endure the bitterest sufferings become the best among men.’ As I said, cultivators eat no good food and live in no good places. You now have water, light, and a cavern to dwell in, free from tigers, wolves, demons, and ghosts. Compared to ordinary cultivators, you are already quite comfortable. Regard your present situation as a blessing, not a calamity. When your mind is calm, your circumstances will be joyful. When your great work is complete, a great luminous realm will appear before your eyes. That will be your day of emergence and ascension. Work hard and take care of yourself. I go now.” With a kick of his feet, he vanished without a trace. The dragon knelt in the cavern, seeing him off.

From then on, she kept the Perfected One’s teachings ever in her heart. Years later, her mind was calm, her resentment released, and she peacefully began cultivating underground. But because the Perfected One said, “When your cultivation succeeds, great light will appear before your eyes,” the people of Hang City, through rumor and distortion, created a most amusing tale.

What that rumor was, we shall reveal in the next chapter.
