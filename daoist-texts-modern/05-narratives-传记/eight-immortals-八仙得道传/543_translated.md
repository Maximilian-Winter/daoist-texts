# Chapter Seventy-Five: The Immortal of Great Well Alley Leaves Ancient Traces; The Ghost Official of White Cloud Mountain Seeks the Renowned Master

Now then, after Master Xu the Perfected had rescued the female flood dragon, he released a sliver of heavenly light beneath the City God’s Mountain, granting her a place by the water’s source to dwell. Moreover, he promised that once her dao-cultivation succeeded, a radiant revelation would surely appear. This was originally but a phrase among cultivators, yet it unwittingly gave rise to a great misunderstanding among the common folk. As told before, the people of Hangzhou, inspired by the Perfected’s opened grotto, dug a great well there—a source of drinking water for the masses. Later, the popular tale arose that this well was used by Master Xu to subdue the flood dragon, and that one might glimpse a light within it, signaling the female dragon’s emergence.

Thus, among the people, a warning spread: at dusk, no one must bring lamps near the well, lest the female flood dragon come forth. This well still exists today, and the locals name the place Great Well Alley. The caution against lantern light remains deeply imprinted in their hearts, passed down from elders to children. A single phrase of misunderstanding has endured for over two thousand years—how utterly laughable! But that is a tale for another time and need not detain us here. Even the saying that Master Xu allowed the female flood dragon three thousand years hence to attain immortality has yet to come to pass. Since no proof has surfaced, the author finds it best to leave such matters unexamined.

Now the story turns to another figure, the disciple Fei Changfang, who was once taught by Wang Yizhi, mentioned in the previous chapter. Since Wang Yizhi’s passing, Fei Changfang has fully inherited his master’s skills and, through diligent effort, has in some respects surpassed him. With Wang Yizhi gone, the office of managing ghosts fell to Fei Changfang. Yet this position was lowly, steeped in dealings with yin souls and heavy yin qi. Moreover, overseeing fierce ghosts inevitably earned him many ghostly enemies. Wang Yizhi himself had never wished to shoulder such vexations or accumulate grudges. Ultimately, having failed to become an immortal and having blundered into a great calamity, Wang Yizhi’s survival—avoiding hell—was itself a stroke of fortune. Elevated by the Iron Crutch to this post, how could he expect more? He carried out his duties for over one hundred years until his death by crime, then passed the office to Changfang.

Changfang was younger and ambitious. Having entered the daoist path, how could he not aspire to reach the rank of celestial immortal? Moreover, seeing his master’s long tenure end in a sudden misfortune, he understood such matters held little meaning. Though compelled by Heaven’s decree to accept the post, he vowed to advance diligently, never daring a moment’s idleness, hoping to ascend to the heavenly realms. Through countless kalpas, sincerity accumulated would surely bring response. By chance, Master Wenmei the Perfected passed through his region and heard of this devoted cultivator of the great dao. He summoned his disciple Zhang Guo by swordlight, instructing him to test whether Changfang possessed the blessing to become immortal.

Zhang Guo set out accordingly and, midway, encountered the companions Lan Caihe and He Xiangu wandering idly. The three met and exchanged greetings, Zhang Guo invited them along, and the two immortals gladly consented. Together they rode the clouds toward the region of Luoyang where Fei Changfang lived. Selecting a vacant spot, they alighted and transformed into ordinary daoists, then proceeded directly to Changfang’s home to pay their respects.

Changfang, deeply absorbed in his studies, was naturally pleased to receive fellow practitioners. He tidied his robes and welcomed them inside, offering formal greetings and seating. After exchanging surnames, the three immortals each fabricated names, saying, “We have come from Lingnan, having heard that your dao-cultivation is profound and that you command the ghosts of the world—a true man of talent, wisdom, and virtue. Thus, we dared to make this unannounced visit.” Though Changfang held a humble post, he was proud and loathed being called a ghost-master, seeing it as an insult that marked him unworthy of true cultivation. His friends knew his temper well and, though aware of his ghostly duties, dared not utter the word “ghost,” out of respect for his disdain.

Yet these three unexpected guests opened their mouths with that very history, praising his record. Changfang’s face flushed scarlet; he could neither deny nor affirm. As first-time visitors from afar, it was improper to offend them, so he stammered a few words and quickly changed the subject. But these three were simple folk, lacking social tact, unable to read his mood. The more Changfang resented it, the more they pressed him, discussing ghost affairs and asking about his dealings with fierce ghosts. They spoke of his master Wang Yizhi’s foolishness and suffering. Their teasing seemed deliberate, as if they had conspired to make sport of him. Changfang could bear it no longer. Unable to offend his guests, he feigned distraction, playing a tune on a zither and singing, showing reluctance to reply. They asked three or four questions; he answered coldly with half a phrase. Yet the three paid no heed, continuing their talk, always returning to ghosts and spirits.

Changfang suspected these esteemed guests were no mere admirers from afar. Surely they bore some grudge against him. Or perhaps they were enemies of his late master, now that the old man had become immortal, seeking revenge through his disciple. Their coming was ill-intended; good men would not come thus. Since they meant harm, he would yield much but not surrender. In his youth’s pride, he would not show weakness. Hearing their endless chatter, he bowed and said, “I deeply apologize to you three. I serve by decree to manage ghostly affairs, partly to continue my master’s unfinished work, partly because I have no other occupation. Given the imperial order, I gladly play this humble role, serving the local people. Though the post is lowly, my heart is not set here. Alas, meeting you three for the first time, our acquaintance is shallow; there are many subtle matters I cannot speak of. Yet I trust that, as new acquaintances, we have no ties. From your first step inside until now, you have spoken only of ghosts. I do not dare suspect you consort with fierce spirits, nor believe you come by any command to investigate me. I have always welcomed fellow practitioners warmly. Yet today, your words have greatly disappointed me. Pray, what is your teaching? Why speak only of ghosts and not of human affairs? I beg you to enlighten me.”

Having spoken, he set a stern face and fell silent. The three immortals laughed heartily and said, “Sir, you are indeed a rare man of spirit. Nowadays, if not an official in the living world, one might serve as a clerk in the underworld. Yet you bear this heavy office with such discontent. This shows how men differ in ambition and aspiration. But tell us, what is your true aspiration? What noble endeavor do you pursue in life?”

Changfang, who had welcomed them with humility and openness, expecting sincere instruction from distant daoists, was now inflamed by their words. No longer holding them in regard, he replied coldly, “Each man has his own aspiration, as varied as his face. We are but chance acquaintances with no ties. I have no leisure to inquire into your origins; yet you ask about my ambitions—surely that is meddlesome?”

Zhang Guo, seeing his anger rise, quickly smiled and apologized: “We had no prior meeting and did not know your reluctance to serve in this office was not heartfelt. Surely your aspirations exceed your current post by ten or a hundredfold. We spoke abruptly only out of admiration and a wish to befriend you. How could one of your spirit and virtue show such anger at a mere word? Surely your magnanimity is lacking. Such narrow-mindedness fits only ghostly duties, not the great dao of immortals. Or perhaps you have other aspirations, even beyond the immortals? If your aim is cultivation of immortality and such matters, that seems beyond your temperament. We hope you will consider this carefully.”

Changfang wished to dismiss them coldly, to avoid further entanglement. Yet anger and public mockery stung deeply. His face flushed red, veins bulged, displeasure fully displayed. Yet Zhang Guo’s words held truth. He thought: “No matter the visitor’s character, if they speak, I must be especially kind and humble. Only thus can I raise my station and show the broad, grand heart of a cultivator. To quarrel over a word and ask in anger is the act of a petty man, unworthy of their example.” With this thought, his rage vanished. He bowed and smiled to Zhang Guo: “Your visit, though sharp, has been most instructive. I dare not refuse your teaching. I confess, I was born under ill fortune, orphaned young, lacking courtly training. Later, I learned talismanic arts from Master Wang Yizhi, unrelated to the great dao. When he passed, I planned to abandon home and seek renowned masters. Yet fate compelled me to inherit his post. Though I walk unhindered, my duties distract me from deep study of profound principles. This weighs on me and causes regret. Unexpectedly, you three came from afar, not to aid me by the true path, but to probe my hidden resentments, mocking me without cease. Though unintentional on your part, it has greatly disappointed me and shown in my words and countenance.”

The three immortals nodded and said, “A pupil worthy of teaching.” Their six eyes exchanged glances; they leapt into the air. Suddenly, the courtyard filled with five-colored auspicious clouds, rising gently. Fragrant breezes wafted through the chamber, unlike any earthly scent, refreshing the mind and spirit. Changfang was startled and terrified. He hurriedly looked up and saw the three immortals standing on the clouds, laughing heartily down at him.

He knelt quickly, kowtowing and cried out, “Three immortal masters, your disciple was blind and rude in speech. I beg your mercy for my offenses. Please graciously accept me, record me on the lineage wall, so I may escape the sea of suffering soon. For all my life, I shall be grateful for your great virtue.” Zhang Guo waved his hand from the clouds, bidding him rise, then revealed their origins. He said, “If you have true sincerity, come within three days to the summit of White Cloud Mountain west of the city. There stands an ancient temple where the three of us will be. There, the wondrous dao will be transmitted. Arrive on time; do not be early or late.” With that, the colored clouds condensed and the figures vanished.

Changfang bowed and returned inside. His first wife had long since died. Recently, he had remarried a young lady of a great family, beautiful and talented, their marriage deeply affectionate. She saw him enter and asked, “Who visited today, speaking at this hour?” Changfang smiled, “To please you, my lady, I do not trust worldly wealth but seek only immortality and the dao. Today, three true immortals, moved by my sincere heart, came to teach me and bade me meet them the day after tomorrow atop White Cloud Mountain to receive the supreme dao face to face...”

Before he finished, his wife spat and said, “You have truly lost your mind. Who does not know White Cloud Mountain teems with tigers and leopards, injuring countless people yearly? Though you have some magic, it only works on humans. Against wild beasts without spirit, it will avail little. Why risk yourself for such a remote matter?” Changfang shook his head, “I have the shrinking-earth technique; I can reach the summit in a single step. Even fierce beasts cannot catch me. Besides, if a cultivator fears death east and west, it would be better to live a simple mortal life. Why cultivate the dao at all?”

His wife urged him again and again, but Changfang was resolute. He thought, “The immortals said not to speak of this at home, but to come to this dangerous place. Surely they test my sincerity. If I use the shrinking-earth technique to leap there at once, it is no different than staying home and would make the immortals laugh at my laziness. That would not show my true heart.” So he concealed his plans, prepared some dry food, and early the next day slipped out, heading toward White Cloud Mountain. His wife, suspecting he might go soon, did not expect him to leave earlier and could only wait anxiously for his return.

Though near his home, Changfang had never ventured up the mountain, for it was full of fierce beasts. The path was overgrown. After asking at several places, he finally reached the foot of the mountain. That night, the mountain loomed steep and precipitous. Though a narrow path led upward, it was exceptionally tight. Unaccustomed to mountain trails, he soon grew breathless and drenched in sweat, exhausted but afraid to rest. Drawing courage from the moonlight, he pressed on desperately. After some distance, his legs weakened and his body could hardly hold up. The moonlight flickered; when bright, the path was visible; when dark and clouded, even the trail vanished. At this point, Changfang felt he could go no further and chose a stone seat to wait for dawn.

Throughout the night, he heard tiger howls echoing through the valley and saw mountain ghosts roaming. The ghosts feared Changfang and did no harm. But tigers and wolves were beyond his control. Fortunately, he had the shrinking-earth method to evade beasts if attacked. Though he never had to use it, his spirit was nearly scared out of his body. Another strange thing troubled him: his shrinking-earth technique was utterly useless here.

The next day, weary from his flight, he entertained a thought: “Since the summit is near, I might quietly borrow my magic. Surely the immortals would not mind.” So he used the method. Normally, one stride could cover a million steps. Fearing blame, he limited his power to one step equaling ten. Yet as he shortened the distance, the mountain path seemed to stretch longer. Though he saw a target within one step’s reach, on opening his eyes, it was still eight or nine steps away. By calculation, his step had the power of only one step. Changfang was greatly alarmed. He recalled that his master’s teachings never failed. Why this strange phenomenon today? Surely the three immortals’ illusion, designed to test his courage. The terrifying things he saw last night were also their trial. If he shrank the moment he left home or shrank at danger, the immortals would see his lack of sincerity. Now the crisis neared its end, the summit in sight, he must struggle onward. Then the immortals could not say he was unworthy or refuse to teach.

He looked at the sky, ate some food, and resolved to press on, confident the peak was within reach. Rising, he saw the mountain peak ahead and a dilapidated temple atop it—surely where the immortals awaited. His heart leapt with joy; renewed vigor filled him. He disregarded his worn shoes and aching limbs, climbing with effort to the summit. Standing firm, he looked up and could not help but cry out in complaint.

Why Changfang met new difficulties upon reaching the peak, the next chapter will reveal.
