# Chapter Seventy-Six: Lan Caihe’s Long Song Rebukes the Worldly Guests; Fei Changfang’s Short-Sightedness Leads Him Astray

Now it happened that Changfang, after countless hardships, had climbed to the summit of White Cloud Mountain. Originally, he had seen from afar the ancient temple standing majestic atop the peak, towering amid the dense woods. Yet, upon reaching the summit and raising his eyes, he found—strangely—that the ancient temple was nowhere to be seen. Changfang was struck with both fear and astonishment. Fearing that the immortals might be angry at his insincerity and had deliberately concealed the temple to show their rejection, he thought thus and could not help but wail to Heaven, howling aloud and weeping bitterly.

After crying for a time, he glanced at the sky and saw that evening had fallen. The dimming sunlight slanted through the grove, casting its pale glow upon withered branches and yellow leaves, reflecting one another to paint a scene of desolation. At this moment, Changfang truly felt himself trapped—no path forward, no way back—standing alone in the vastness, hesitating as he looked about.

Having wept his fill, he let his body fall upon a towering, jagged rock, gazing up at the endless sky, and gave a long, piercing howl. The birds in the forest, startled by the cry, scattered in panic. Lost in thought, Changfang mused: “Life in this world is truly like a passing traveler’s fleeting existence, a sojourner lodged in a hostile inn. Once the final limit arrives, all matters are done. Reflecting carefully, I do not know why, but recalling my own hardships—growing up studying the dao under Wang Yizhi’s tutelage, barely acquiring some methods—yet the path to the Dao remains far away. Later, inheriting my master’s position, I found even less time to cultivate. Fortunate to meet three immortal elders, I thought the maze might be crossed, the great Dao attained. Yet, after braving dangers and hardships to reach this mountain peak, I do not know what offense I gave the immortals that even the ancient temple has vanished in illusion. This proves they absolutely refuse to show their favor. Having missed this chance, when and where might I meet immortals again? Without meeting immortals, there is no becoming Dao. Death is inevitable; rather than suffer the burdens of the mundane world, better to seek escape early.”

As these thoughts crossed his mind, his heart unknowingly turned dark. Suddenly, he stood up and shouted: “Since the immortals will not accept their disciple, there is no benefit for me to live in the mortal world. Life inevitably ends in death. I no longer wish to be a futile mortal. Here, I bid farewell to the three immortal elders and will go to the underworld of Yin Cao.” Having spoken, he knelt and kowtowed several times. Just as he was about to hang himself, he suddenly heard singing from behind the mountain. The song went:

“Foolish man seeks the cloud path,  
The cloud path lost without a trace.  
Mountains high and perilous,  
Valleys broad and seldom clear.  
Green barriers before and behind,  
White clouds west and east entwined.  
If you wish to know where clouds dwell,  
The clouds abide in empty space.”

Then another song:

“I see the people of the world,  
Born and then return to death.  
Yesterday still two persons,  
Vigorous spirits and noble men.  
Now past seventy years,  
Strength wanes, forms wither away.  
Like springtime flowers,  
Opening at dawn, falling by night.”

Another song:

“A white crane carries bitter flowers,  
A thousand miles in one breath.  
Seeking to reach Penglai Mountain,  
Using these as provisions.  
Before feathers fall away,  
Leaving the flock, heart mourns deeply.  
Returning to the old nest,  
Wife and children do not recognize.”

Another song:

“Weeping willows dark as smoke,  
Flying blossoms drift like hail.  
Husband dwells in the wife’s land,  
Wife longs for husband’s county.  
Each at opposite ends of Heaven,  
When shall they meet again?  
Send word to the Moonlit Tower,  
Do not store the pair of swallows.”

Another song:

“A chestnut horse with coral whip,  
Gallops the road to Luoyang.  
Pity the handsome youth,  
Unbelieving in aging’s approach.  
White hair ought to grow,  
Red cheeks cannot last.  
Look to Mount Beiyin,  
That is Penglai Isle.”

Another song:

“My original aspiration is the dao’s order,  
The dao’s order always close at hand.  
Meeting travelers on the road,  
Often exchanging words with Zen guests.  
Discussing mysteries on moonlit nights,  
Exploring principles at dawn’s arrival.  
All affairs vanish without trace,  
Only then to know the beginning and end of man.”

Another song:

“Hand strokes broad and free,  
Body tall and robust.  
Born with a limited form,  
Die as a nameless ghost.  
Since ancient times many such,  
Now you are helpless.  
Come to White Cloud,  
I’ll teach you the Purple Ganoderma song.”

Another song:

“Vast and mighty Yellow River waters,  
Flow eastward endlessly.  
Clear waters never seen,  
All men’s lives have limits.  
If you wish to come to White Cloud,  
How can you grow wings?  
Wings are but your temples’ hair,  
Walking and standing require effort.”

Another song:

“I now have a garment,  
Neither gauze nor silk.  
May I ask its color?  
Neither red nor purple.  
In summer it is worn as a shirt,  
In winter as a quilt.  
Winter and summer alternate use,  
All year long just so.”

Another song:

“World affairs are so vast,  
Greed never ceases.  
Listening to all Heaven and Earth’s names,  
When will rest be found?  
Four seasons wither and change,  
Eight festivals rush like a stream.  
To repay the great mansion’s lord,  
Riding the sun’s ox on the exposed ground.”

Another song:

“High atop the mountain peak,  
Looking all around boundless.  
Sitting alone, no one knows,  
A lonely moon shines on cold springs.  
No moon in the spring,  
The moon freely in the blue sky.  
Singing this one song,  
The song itself is Zen.”

Another song:

“East house has a wife,  
Rich for three or five years.  
Once poorer than me,  
Now laughs at my lack of money.  
She laughs I am behind,  
I laugh she is ahead.  
Laughing at each other not knowing,  
East side again west side.”

Hearing these songs, Changfang was greatly astonished and said, “These songs are no common verses; they carry great immortal meaning. Could it be that the immortal masters are still on the mountain, not having departed? Surely they pity my foolish heart and still wish to save me.” So he bowed low to the ground and cried out loudly, “Immortal masters, where are you? Your disciple Fei Changfang has come up the mountain as commanded but has not seen you. Now I am prepared to end my life here to thank you. If you still deem me worthy, please quickly manifest your power, so your disciple may see your countenance before death. Even beneath the Nine Springs, I shall close my eyes in peace.”

As he mournfully called out, the singer stepped from behind the opposite mountain, climbing the peak step by step. Seeing Changfang, he stared blankly and asked, “Sir, you are quite amusing. You come to this high mountain and perform such great rites—is this not strange?” Changfang looked up and saw that although the man was not one of the three immortals, he bore the immortal aura and Daoist bearing, his spirit graceful and free. Moreover, at dusk in the deep mountains, to travel and sing alone was surely no mortal’s deed. Perhaps he was a friend or disciple of the immortals, specially sent to visit him.

Changfang kowtowed several times, then rose and said, “Honored brother, you must surely be sent by the immortals to aid your disciple, is that not so? Just now, overhearing your songs, I knew you were no ordinary person or worldly man.” The man smiled, returning the bow, and asked the cause. He sighed and said, “So it is; no wonder you are sorrowful. But as for the three immortal masters, I know a little of them. They do not refuse to see you, nor do they bear any hatred. In their hearts, they are glad you braved dangers and came here. Yet this meeting is your first great trial on the path to transcendence, not so easily passed. First, you surely still have a wife at home—can you truly sever ties? Second, though your courage is great, do you have any laziness or desire for shortcuts?”

At these words, Changfang suddenly understood—the immortals’ refusal to appear was a test of his mastery of the shrinking-earth method. Clearly this man was sent by the immortals. Hastily, he begged his name. The man laughed, “We meet like drifting duckweed, soon you east, I west. If you truly kill yourself, it would be me living and you dead—no need for names. If fate allows us to meet again, we will know each other without names.” Changfang dared not ask more and confessed his occasional laziness. He added, “As for attachments to wife and children, I believe I can cast them aside. Might you convey my repentance and sincere resolve to the immortals, asking their acceptance?”

The man smiled and nodded, “Cultivation depends on oneself, not others. If you can set your mind pure and strive unceasingly, the great Dao lies in your heart, needing no external seeking. Otherwise, daily talk of seeking masters and the Dao is but self-deception and humiliation—what good is it?” Changfang, being sharp and having studied under Yizhi from youth, and recently transmitted his Dao methods, made great progress. Hearing this, he fully understood. In an instant, his mind was as if bathed in sweet nectar, indescribably joyful and clear. Reflecting again on the songs and glancing at the man, he suddenly realized this was surely one of the three immortals he had sought. What he said was the very beginning of their teaching, like the opening chapter of their doctrine.

He bowed deeply and said, “Disciple understands: practice must be grounded, without the slightest insincerity. Seeking the Dao requires all attachments to be silent, allowing no entanglements. May I ask, honored immortal, is this correct?” The man smiled, “Being grounded is the first and hardest task. Easy to say, hard to do. Saying and doing in accord—that is true integrity. Confucian, Buddhist, and Daoist teachings all say this, but none is easier. Beautiful words without real deeds are empty talk. Empty talk is insincerity, and insincere people are loathed by the immortals. How can they speak of cultivation?” Changfang bowed again. The man laughed and asked, “Where will you go now?”

Changfang said sadly, “I came only to pay respects to the three immortals and receive instruction. Not finding them, I met you and your wise words have opened my mind. Now I wish to leave the world and study the Dao, all depending on my own resolve. Without resolve, daily empty talk is useless. Even with the heart to cultivate, if there is fear or attachment, love or unwillingness to part, saying today and tomorrow, this year and next, is self-deception. Self-deceivers are not only insincere but invite great abandonment. Those who truly resolve, once enlightened, decide immediately. After deciding, they turn back at once. This is the proper step in cultivation and the only way to become immortal. Having fully awakened today, if I do not decide to cultivate, but cling to the mundane world and delay time, fearing the moment lost, future failure is certain, and I will be but a laughingstock—too pointless indeed.”

The man smiled and nodded, “So you can resolve to abandon your beloved wife and children and all worldly attachments, starting now, to become a Daoist recluse?” Changfang kowtowed, “As you command.” The man laughed, “Though so, your love for your wife is good, and your young son is handsome and bright, like a carved jade ball—so precious. Do you intend to abandon them all together? That would be too cruel.” Changfang resolutely said, “Only those truly attached can forget attachment. Only by forgetting today can true love come tomorrow. Immortal, do not test me further. I have laid down the butcher’s knife and resolved to advance, loving nothing.” The man said, “If so, I will prepare a little thing for you, so your family may believe you have died, ending their worries. Then I will take you to meet the three immortals. Is that well?” Changfang rejoiced, “Such kindness is deeply appreciated.” The man produced a pill, saying, “Swallow this; it will dispel hunger and clear your vision. After taking it, you may go a year without food and see objects clearly at night.” Changfang accepted, swallowed it, and instantly felt vitality surge and his eyes cool and clear. The sky had darkened; moonlight was faint, yet opening his eyes, he could discern the path and recognize things as well as by day. Joyfully, he thanked the man.

The man instructed him to break off a dry branch from a tree opposite and lay it on the ground. Changfang asked, “What is this for?” The man smiled, “This will serve as your temporary substitute.”

As he spoke, he chanted over the branch and shouted sharply. The branch vanished, replaced by a figure dressed exactly like Fei Changfang, standing beside the real Changfang. Changfang asked, “Is this the stand-in to fake my death?” The man laughed, “I have no time to escort him. Let me find someone to help.” He summoned the mountain’s earth deity and ordered him to take the false Changfang to the land temple outside the western city. There, the earth deity was to send a dream to Fei Changfang’s wife, urging her to lead the children to collect the body. The earth deity accepted the command. The man then breathed upon the false Changfang. The earth deity grasped him and said, “Come with me.” Strangely, the false Changfang moved as if alive, following the earth deity down the mountain. Changfang felt both moved and amused, standing silently lost in thought.

The man laughed, “How is it? Do you not miss your family? Tell me honestly, if you return like this, your wife will be full of suspicion. Think: when did you leave?” Changfang replied, “Only two days ago.” The man laughed heartily, “This is the immortal realm; time differs from the mortal world. Ask below and you will know you have been here several months. If you doubt, observe your body—has it not passed from heat to cold, then to gentle warmth?” Changfang remembered that when he left, it was early autumn, wearing a light jacket.

By the time they reached the mountain top, it was very cold. Yet, unable to find the three immortals and anxious, he hardly felt discomfort. When meeting the man and discussing profound principles, warmth returned—it was already spring again. Changfang was greatly surprised and asked, “Is this White Cloud Mountain the dwelling of immortals?” The man laughed, “Immortals have no fixed abode, unlike mortals who buy property and need much space. In short, the blessed grotto is entirely in your heart. The more sincere your heart, the closer you are to the immortal realm. The more false your heart, the farther from the immortal land. Think again: from when you first climbed the mountain, how did the weather change? At the summit, how did it change? Know that mountains have no height or low; it depends on your heart’s sincerity. The higher you climb, the more sincere your heart, the closer to the immortal realm. Thus, at the foot, it is still mortal time; the higher the climb, the longer the time compared to the mortal world. This is the principle.”

Changfang pondered the past two days’ changing weather and trials, finding every word true. Especially the phrase “the immortal realm lies in the heart” struck him with sudden clarity. After deep thought, his heart gained another layer of awakening. He begged the man to accompany him in seeking the three immortals. The man agreed, smiling, “You have the shrinking-earth method; descending the mountain is easy, no?” Changfang, recalling previous talk, said quickly, “My heart is sincere in seeking the Dao; I dare not flaunt small skills or seek shortcuts. I will follow you on foot down the mountain.” The man laughed, “No need for such trouble now. Come, even with cloud riding and shrinking earth, it takes half a day to arrive. Since you refuse shrinking earth, come with me to ascend Heaven.” He blew a breath, and a colorful cloud appeared beneath their feet, carrying them aloft. The man shouted, and the cloud soared high into the sky, bearing the two upward.

After half an hour, the man pointed, and two clouds descended straight to the earth. Speaking from the cloud, he said, “Immortals, Buddhas, and sages cannot forget their flesh and blood. Now your home is in sight. Lower your head and see how your wife fares.” Changfang hastened, “Immortal, do not joke with your disciple. First, my foundation is shallow; though resolved to leave the world, it is only a forced effort. Seeing my wife again will surely stir worldly thoughts. Second, my wife will surely weep and cling, unwilling to let me go. Would that not ruin my great cause?”

The man laughed, “You are in the air; they are in the mortal world. I will not let them see you, so they cannot behold you. Whether your heart stirs depends on your own strength to hold firm. If you cannot force yourself to leave, seeing family will only weaken you, and cultivation is useless.” As he spoke, the cloud lowered, and Changfang looked down. The landscape was clear; indeed, they were at Changfang’s home. Strangely, though in the clouds, he could hear the cries and wails of his family. His wife had just received the false Changfang’s body and was in deep mourning. She wept as if dead and returned to life. His son cried ceaselessly, “Father, come back! Father, come back! If you do not return, mother will die of sorrow.”

Changfang heard each word, heart pierced with pain. Though outwardly calm before the man, tears streamed down his cheeks, soaking his clothes. The man said nothing, only smiled gently. Changfang was overwhelmed with grief and pain, paying no heed. The man raised the cloud, returning to the sky. Changfang’s eyes kept turning toward his home, as if taking a step and looking back—a scene of constant longing. From then on, what the man said and Changfang’s replies often mismatched, though he did not notice, the man laughed heartily.

Less than two hours later, the man said, “Now we must cross the sea; let us descend.” Changfang asked in alarm, “Have the three immortals already gone overseas?” The man nodded silently, pointed downward, and the cloud shot down like a meteor. Changfang, unused to such travel, was fearful and closed his eyes. Suddenly, he felt his feet touch solid ground and a slight tremor. Opening his eyes, he found himself on a seashore, standing beside the man.

The man beckoned to the sea, calling, “Bring a boat! Bring a boat!” After several calls, from somewhere a tiny boat appeared. The sea wind howled, white waves surged. From afar, the boat seemed the size of a common cart. Yet as it neared, the boat shrank, until at the shore it was no larger than a big banana leaf. The boatman took up half the space, leaving barely room for one foot—how could two people ride it? Changfang was amazed and frightened, not understanding what was happening. Hesitating, the man leapt aboard, standing beside the boatman. The remaining space grew even smaller and narrower.

The man waved repeatedly, “Come quickly, come quickly, the boat is about to depart.” Changfang hesitated briefly and asked, “Immortal, we are many; this boat is so small. How can we cross? And with such fierce wind and waves, is it not dangerous to sail the sea?”

The man kept beckoning. Suddenly, a great wave swept over, engulfing both men and boat beneath the sea. Changfang, unskilled in water and seeing no one around, could not call for help. He sighed a moment and set off blindly, hurrying forward without direction. The shoreline stretched hundreds of miles; after a long walk, he was exhausted. Looking back, he was still by the sea, with no end in sight. He rested on the ground, thinking if he used the shrinking-earth method, he might find a market town quickly, but he had resolved to seek the immortals. Having said he would not take shortcuts, how could he change his mind? Yet here he was, in this boundless wilderness, with no shore or lodging, not knowing how long before he found people. His heart grew anxious.

He wondered if the immortal who came with him was one of the three immortals. Why did he not ride the clouds but choose this tiny boat to cross the sea, risking drowning? How pitiful and lamentable!

Suddenly, he thought: that immortal had such Dao power—how could he drown? There must be some reason; I must not fall into his great trap. Thinking this, he became lost in thought. After a while, as if enlightened, he suddenly leapt up and shouted, “Alas! I have been tricked by the immortal!”

What trick he fell into remains to be revealed.
