# Chapter Seventy-Seven: Seeking the Immortal, Returning to the Immortal; Attempting to Control Ghostly Beings, Only to Be Bewitched by Them

Now, it happened that Fei Changfang was momentarily bewildered, mistakenly believing that the immortal who had come with him had drowned in the vast ocean. He felt deeply fortunate that he himself had not boarded the boat with that immortal, thus escaping with his life. Had he rashly boarded, by now he would surely have been ground to powder inside the belly of some great fish or giant turtle. He walked on, pondering as he went, step after step. After traveling some distance, he glanced back and saw still only the stretch of beach, clearly no more than an arrow’s flight from where the immortal had supposedly drowned. Looking forward, there was boundless sea, endless and shoreless, stretching a thousand miles beyond sight, with no sign of human habitation. Suddenly, a thought struck him sharply: this immortal did not seem one without the power to divide waters and still waves. Moreover, having attained an imperishable body, how could he perish in the sea?

Reflecting further, he recalled that the immortal had traveled all along on clouds—so why now cross the sea? Besides, there was no boat in the water; if he had called, surely a vessel would have come to receive him. Usually, ships appear small from afar and grow larger as one approaches, but this boat was the opposite. Such matters were indeed most strange. And that small boat, looking so narrow one could hardly stand on it, how could it remain so spacious even after another person boarded? The immortal had already gone aboard and beckoned him—was he fearless of death? Or did he seek death for himself and yet wished to drag Fei along as company? These riddles were countless, all pointing to the conclusion that the entire scene was an illusion conjured by the immortal. Even the cries of his wife and children heard from the sky below—such a thing was utterly impossible. Surely it was all a mystical trick played by the venerable one. Yet Fei Changfang, brave in climbing mountains and crossing waters without much concern, though he had faced dangers before with the art of earth-shrinking to protect himself, now found himself hesitating. Unlike crossing seas and riding waves, where accidents might happen and magic could not be employed, here he discerned a difference between difficulty and ease, danger and safety. But from the immortal’s perspective, lacking sincerity was one and the same.

Just now, the immortal had repeatedly said, “Without sincerity, there is no need to learn the dao.” Clearly, he had been rejected, no longer granted entry into the path. Now, looking back, not only was this fellow immortal who came with him one of the three immortals encountered, but even the boatman who controlled the vessel must be one of them. The saying that immortals dwell overseas—turns out they were right before his eyes. No wonder when on the mountain, the immortal had repeatedly said that the immortal realm lies within the heart-field. Yet though he understood the principle, he could not act upon it in reality. It seemed the immortal had long foreseen him, thus spoke words of the difficulty of practice. He thought: I have so arduously met three true immortals, braved many dangers, reached the summit of White Cloud Mountain, and through the immortal master’s art severed my family’s thoughts, believing my resolve unshakable. Then, by the immortal’s compassion and guidance, I was told that cultivation would succeed and ascent to Heaven was hopeful. Who knew that in a single moment, because my cultivation was not steadfast, I would be abandoned by the immortal master? Not to mention the great error committed, the regret beyond reach, but how could I face my native village, my elders, my wife and children? At this point in life, I truly feel there is nothing left to do. Originally, I had risked death on White Cloud Mountain, only to be awakened from my confusion by the immortal master and follow him here. Now, better to return and die; yet even if the immortal master knows, he may not come to save me. Thinking thus, he could not help but burst into loud lamentation.

At that moment, suddenly a woman’s voice was heard from the sky, calling out: “Fei Changfang, your desire is not yet withdrawn, your dao-heart not yet firm. Forcing yourself to become a recluse, you may find no end. Better to return early and still enjoy hundreds of years of human blessings. Be mindful of your duties, humble and gentle in conduct. If you can end well, you may become an earth-immortal. Otherwise, your master Wang Yizhi will be your example. The missteps of the past are not far away; do not neglect or be careless. This place is within the borders of Shandong’s Penglai; three hundred li hence lies a market town, which you may reach by your magic. Early tomorrow, use your magic to travel west; within half a day you can reach home. I am none other than He Xiangu. The boatman you saw is Daoist friend Zhang Guo. The one you met on White Cloud Mountain is Daoist friend Lan Caihe. The three of us heard of your progress in cultivation and greatly wished to aid your success. Alas, your karmic conditions are not yet ripe; such a fine opportunity you have wasted. Yet among the three teachings, Confucianism does not speak of immortals, but success is one. From now on, if you can truly resolve to do good and persevere without slackening, your future will be bright indeed. Why must you insist on becoming an immortal? Strive on, strive on. Lan and Zhang are waiting in the sea, going together to pay respects to Daoist Zhongli; we cannot speak at length now, I must go.”

Fei Changfang looked up to the sky; all along he saw only a patch of colorful clouds, suspended alone at mid-heaven, but no figure. Yet the voice was clear, each word entering his ear without blur. Knowing this was a wondrous work of the immortals, he quickly prostrated himself on the ground, acknowledging his fault. After He Xiangu departed, he rose and sat on the shore, lost in thought for a time, reflecting that his immortal fate was lost by his own fault. Living in this turbid world held no true interest. Yet the words of the immortal maiden seemed to hold hope for the future. Since the immortal had earnestly encouraged him, how could he dare to abandon the path and incur the crime of opposing Heaven? In an instant, his dao-heart vanished entirely, worldly thoughts surged, and he longed to rush home at once to see his beloved son and wife, to enjoy family happiness again. Truly, the human heart is fickle, now and then unlike itself. Fei Changfang hastily employed his earth-shrinking method, hurried to the market town, and spent the night there.

At dawn the next day, he set out and within half a day returned home. His wife, upon seeing him, suspected a ghost and there was naturally a frightful commotion. After Fei Changfang explained the cause, he took them all to the place where the coffin was kept. Opening it, they found only a withered branch. Calculating the days from when he left to when he returned, it was but four days; yet at home a whole year had passed. According to his wife, upon hearing the bad news and the funeral rites, more than a hundred days had already elapsed. Husband and wife, father and son, met again after death—a mingling of joy and sorrow beyond words. From then on, Fei Changfang always remembered the immortal maiden’s admonitions, treating the world and others with increasing peace and caution. After the death of Wang Yizhi in the Western Han under Emperor Wu, the office passed to Fei Changfang. Failing to become immortal, he lost heart in cultivation and devoted himself to the office of controlling ghosts. The lengthy account above serves only to supplement prior matters in this book.

Later, Fei Changfang lived through the Western Han, Eastern Han, and into the Two Jin and Five Dynasties, indeed healthy and safe, wandering freely in the human world. Though not becoming immortal, his years passed in ease. Yet who could know the end of life is fixed? The immortal maiden, seeing his cultivation hopeless, advised him to return home and enjoy blessings; she also vaguely foretold that he would not continue as a master. Reasonably, since Fei Changfang received immortal instruction and strove to be good, he suffered no calamity amid the chaos. In the end, though not immortal, he did not fall into ruin. Perhaps his fate was thus fixed, destined not to end well. As the ancients said, those skilled at swimming often perish by drowning; those who control ghosts will ultimately die by ghostly hands. From Wang Yizhi and Fei Changfang to the Tang dynasty’s scholar Zhong, no ghost master escaped death by ghosts. Such matters cannot be judged by ordinary logic. But for now, we speak only of Fei Changfang’s tragic end.

At the end of the Jin dynasty, Fei Changfang made a close friend named Huan Jing, a man of renown. Anyone who has read the Jin histories would know his name. Huan Jing was also a remarkable figure. It is said that in his youth he met a lame Daoist who told him that in a past life he had eaten too many dogs and in this life would be killed by many dogs. Huan Jing, seeing the Daoist’s extraordinary appearance, elegant bone structure, and despite tattered clothes, a radiant and refined aura, suspected he was the famed Li Tieguai. Hearing the words, he was terrified and begged for a method to avoid this fate. The Daoist, at a loss, finally gave him a talisman, saying: “Go to a certain mountain. At the juncture of midnight and noon each day, a great wolf-dog appears, spitting a red elixir to the moon. I now give you this talisman; swallow it, and you will become invisible and protected, unseen by the wolf-dog. You may hide behind it and, when it spits the elixir, seize it immediately and swallow it. From then on, the dog cannot approach you. Another benefit is that your eyes will see yin beings—old ghosts, new ghosts, great or small—none can escape your gaze. This will protect you and allow you to cure others, a method with double gain.” Having spoken, the Daoist vanished like a clear wind, destination unknown.

Huan Jing swallowed the talisman and went as directed. Indeed, he saw a magnificent and fierce dog atop the mountain, bowing to the moon. Each bow, it spat forth a red elixir, fluttering in the wind, a splendid sight. After bowing, it swallowed the elixir again. Huan Jing dared not delay, creeping close with a pounding heart, thinking: “If the talisman fails, I will not die by future dog bites but be swallowed early by this wolf-dog.” Yet as he approached, the dog seemed unaware. Relieved, he boldly followed the method, scooping the dog’s elixir into his hand and quickly swallowing it.

Suddenly the dog went mad, leaping and rolling wildly atop the mountain, howling loudly, terrifying Huan Jing to paralysis. The dog stayed about half a li away, crying and raging but unable to approach. Sometimes it glared angrily, raised its tail, and howled straight at Huan Jing. He knew the elixir worked. Though fierce beyond measure, the dog could not harm him. When Huan Jing stepped forward, the dog fled as if meeting a tiger or leopard. Joyful, he ceased teasing and hurried home.

From then on, his eyes seemed to shine with an extra brightness, twofold in vision: one for the yang world’s people, the other illuminating ghostly beings. Wherever he went, at any time, all manner of strange, cruel, and fierce ghosts appeared before his eyes. At first, seeing the unseen and such terrifying scenes, he was frightened and dared not open his eyes freely. Later, accustomed, he no longer found it strange. When friends’ families were troubled or sickened by ghostly possession, they called him to inspect. Some could be sent off properly with paper and spirit money; others, stubborn and malevolent, required him to dispatch ghost soldiers to capture the pests. Thus he incurred the hatred of many fierce ghosts. Among them, several sharp-tongued, cunning, and sly ghosts—those cleverest in the ghost realm—gathered men, women, young and old spirits, convening a grand assembly to discuss how to kill Huan Jing, ending his life by ghostly hands so he could not even become a ghost.

After some deliberation, a sharp-tongued ghost proposed a cunning plan: “We ghosts, trapped in the netherworld, suffer countless hardships. When evil men or those owing us debts come, we stir trouble to gain some benefit; or, with special connections, we may bargain for a substitute to return to mortal life early. But this Huan Jing lives well in the human world, opposing our realm without cause or grudge, even petitioning our chief to punish us severely. We have countless brothers harmed by him. If we let him remain, we ghosts suffer ever more, never seeing the light of day.”

At this, many male ghosts clenched fists and snarled with rage; female ghosts wept bitterly, a pitiful sight. They asked, “Honored spirit, what is your high counsel? Please declare. We suffer much from this man; if we can kill him, all will follow your command.” The sharp-tongued ghost shouted, “Huan Jing is clever, eyes bright, schemes many, and aided by our officials. Open battle is impossible. The best plan is a hidden arrow. I say, now that autumn has just passed and plagues spread, we send some pestilence ghosts to his home, spreading seeds of disease far and wide. This will not only kill Huan Jing but wipe out his entire family. Remember, many brothers have been harmed by him; this is just retribution. Even if Fei Changfang learns of it, Huan Jing will be dead. He need not avenge a friend and offend all our followers. Besides, Huan Jing recklessly defies fate, saving those who should die, upsetting Heaven and Earth’s order. If this goes to trial, we will all accompany him to the Court of the Underworld and explain clearly; likely King Yan will not favor him. As for Fei Changfang, who blindly trusts Huan Jing and aids his crimes, causing us to die unjustly and become resentful ghosts, he too deserves punishment. He is wise and should cease opposing us. If he persists in helping his friend and oppressing us, he brings suffering on himself. First, with so many ghosts against him, he cannot hold his position; once he loses it, his life is in our hands. Second, if we all rise against him before King Yan, even he cannot oppose the will of the many. Once approved, Fei Changfang will no longer be feared. Think well—does my plan succeed?”

The ghosts cheered, “Excellent plan! No wonder you are called the Sharp-Tongued Ghost among men. Your ideas are cruel and fearsome, truly worthy of your name. We will follow your plan fully. First, wipe out Huan Jing’s family; then see how Fei Changfang deals with us, and plan the next step.”

Having agreed on the poison plot, they sent hundreds of pestilence ghosts to Huan Jing’s home. To avoid detection, they hurried to hide in a storeroom filled with goods. By day they dared not act; at night, when Huan Jing, his wife, children, and servants slept, they leapt forth in joy and set to work. In a flurry, they tampered with food, tea, utensils, and clothing—anything within their power. In no time, the house was filled inside and out with seeds of plague. To hasten effect, as if eager to die, they increased the poison’s potency. When finished, they noisily withdrew.

Poor Huan Jing’s family slept soundly, unaware of the ghostly vengeance. It seemed that though he escaped death by dog, he could not escape death by ghosts. Yet ghosts have many schemes, Heaven but one. Huan Jing’s fate was not yet sealed; a savior would come—none other than his friend Fei Changfang, the ghost master. That night, Fei Changfang was returning from a friend’s banquet when he passed a place of many abandoned graves, where ghostly lights flickered. Ghosts, though usually shrieking sharply, spoke in many twists and meanings. Amid the sharp cries, Fei Changfang heard the pestilence ghosts from Huan Jing’s home boasting of their deeds, each phrase piercing his ears. Alarmed, he did not return home but hurried to Huan Jing’s, knocking and entering to see him. Surprised by Fei Changfang’s late visit, Huan Jing asked why. Fei Changfang thought: I only saved their lives; no need to reveal the truth and deepen their hatred and enmity. So he spoke vaguely.

Finally, he said: “Your household faces great disaster. Tomorrow morning, lead all family members, men and women, young and old, to a high mountain for a day’s outing. Each person must bind an amulet filled with cornelian cherries on their arm; if none, carry it in a pocket. This will ward off poison and plague, repel demons and ghosts. One more thing—do not forget: once you set out, leave immediately, taking no food or even a sip of broth. If you disobey, even on the mountain your life is at risk. After you depart, I will send spirits to dispel the misfortune. Wait until sunset and moonrise to return; earlier is no good.” With that, he took his leave.

Huan Jing pondered long, never dreaming of ghostly mischief. Trusting Fei Changfang’s great dao power and reason, he roused everyone. All were anxious and dared not sleep. At dawn, they locked doors and fled, each carrying cornelian cherries, escaping hurriedly to the mountain. They played all day, returning only at dusk.

Entering home, they first saw all their animals—pigs, sheep, chickens, ducks—dead to the last. Huan Jing then believed Fei Changfang’s foresight. Grateful, they prepared to summon Fei Changfang to ask how to remove the ill fortune. Before the messenger left, urgent news arrived: Fei Changfang had been killed by evil ghosts.
