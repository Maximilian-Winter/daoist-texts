# Chapter Seventy-Eight: Ascending Heights on the Double Ninth, Dog’s Eye Repels Pestilence; The Ghost King Enters the Pit, the Scholar Suffers Deceit

Now it happened that Huan Jing was secretly ambushed by a host of malevolent ghosts. Fortunate indeed was he that Fei Changfang’s timely warning roused him to flee; the entire family took refuge upon a mountain peak, narrowly escaping a great calamity. Upon returning home, they found all their livestock—oxen, sheep, chickens, and dogs—utterly dead. Examining their bodies, it was plain they had succumbed to pestilence. Only then did they understand that Fei Changfang’s counsel to escape was born of foresight, foreseeing the harm wrought by the plague ghosts. A mingled feeling of gratitude and resentment stirred in Huan Jing’s heart. Gratitude for Changfang’s deep affection that saved their lives; resentment for the cruel fiends who unleashed such poison.

As he directed his servants to gather the remains of the beasts, a sudden report arrived: Fei Changfang himself had fallen victim to the fiends, perishing in a deep ravine. Huan Jing was struck with horror and hastened to mount a swift horse, riding straight to the Fei household.

Arriving at the gate, a cacophony of wailing burst forth from within, shaking the very heavens. Huan Jing’s heart leapt wildly in his chest. Dismounting, he tied his horse to a tree and was just about to draw the reins when he noticed the courtyard before Fei’s door thronged with countless grim and fearsome fiends. They whispered among themselves, as if plotting, yet each face bore a strange smile. Huan Jing, though able to see ghosts, could not ordinarily hear their speech. But having recently spent much time with Fei Changfang, he had learned a method to catch their words—though not with the clarity Changfang possessed, he could grasp their general meaning, if only dimly. Now, confronted with this scene, his heart trembled with dread. It so happened that this day was the Double Ninth Festival, and a biting north wind arose, sharp and piercing, carrying many ghostly voices into his ears, which he understood perfectly.

The tale unfolded thus: After warning Huan Jing to flee, Fei Changfang had returned home and recounted the matter to his family. His fifth-generation descendant, named Jinghou, now over sixty years old, reproached him for meddling too much in others’ affairs. He said, “Those caught by ghosts surely have their reasons. As for upright, bright, principled, and benevolent people—never mind that ghosts cannot approach them, even gods, Buddhas, and immortals must show them respect. Such people are not rare in this world. If such good folk exist, ghosts would not dare harm them, nor would they need to rescue Huan Jing. Therefore, those whom he saved must be wicked souls deserving ghostly assault. Whether rescuing Huan Jing was right is questionable. The ghosts are clever indeed. If Huan Jing were truly innocent, would they dare risk opposing him? So, whether Huan Jing should be saved is itself a doubt. Our ancestor’s act was compassionate, but as a ghost master, leader of myriad ghosts, he should punish lawlessness among them. Otherwise, should he treat them with favor? That would be a balance of kindness and severity, making all ghosts mindful and obedient, easing his future governance. If he relies on magical power to aid friends and oppress ghosts—even if just—ghosts would resent him. Especially if his cause is not entirely just. Ancestor, consider: having done this, is there no danger?”

Changfang, hearing this, was deeply troubled and regretted his deed. Yet by nature proud and resolute, with no chance to undo what was done, he refused to discuss it further. Unbeknownst to him, the ghosts, upon learning that Changfang had foiled their plans, were incensed and convened a grand assembly. The sharp-tongued ghosts and cunning spirits declared, “Changfang’s conduct shows no loyalty to our ghostly realm. Now that Huan Jing knows, his hatred will deepen. He will strive all the more to thwart us, making matters worse. Moreover, Fei Changfang, as our ghost master and leader, should punish the unworthy among us and avenge grievances, clearing injustice so we may honor him sincerely. Only then is he fit to lead. But now, he has become our public enemy, hated even more than Huan Jing. What use is such a leader? Better seize this chance to punish him. Since he saved our enemy, let him die in their place. This will warn future ghost masters and intimidate Huan Jing from opposing us again. After his death, as a fellow ghost, he will stand trial in the underworld. The King of Hell is just and impartial; he will not favor him. United, we ghosts bear our guilt together; the King of Hell cannot slay us all. Since the fault lies with Changfang, how can the King tolerate his misdeeds? Surely, in the Court of the Ten Kings, he will be charged with some minor offense.”

The assembly erupted first in anger, then in unanimous agreement. Changfang had served as ghost master for centuries without mishap, enjoying great prestige and trust. He considered this incident a minor slip, thinking a future apology would suffice for peace. But resentment toward humans is fiercer than snakes and scorpions; toward ghosts, even more so. Never in his dreams did he imagine mere ghosts would dare rebel against him. Their method was this: though Changfang subdued ghosts by his power, he depended on talismans passed down from Wang Yi. He kept these talismans close, even slipping one into his hair before sleep, never parting from them. Without the talisman, his eyes were veiled as if by heavy curtains, unable to see ghosts; his powers would fail. The ghosts, obedient to him, never dared to trouble him—so he grew careless, taking no precautions. Now, with their plan to oppose him, the first step was to steal his talisman. Yet the talisman’s nature was formidable: any ghost approaching it would lose soul and mind, dissolving like blue smoke, their spirit vanishing. So, though they spoke boldly, when it came to who would risk stealing the talisman, the ghosts exchanged uneasy glances, hesitating long, none daring to volunteer.

Just then, a reckless, soul-lost ghost appeared—a mad, desperate spirit, barely a ghost at all, sustained only by lingering resentment. Upon entering the assembly, he bowed to the elder ghosts. The others, troubled and helpless, paid him little mind, as such visits were common. But the cunning ghosts brightened at his arrival, quickly greeting him and signaling the sharp-tongued and wise ghosts to join in respectful salutes. The resentful ghost, surprised by such deference, felt grateful and inquired about the meeting’s purpose. The sharp-tongued ghosts sighed deeply and recounted the situation, omitting the talisman’s power but adding that Changfang’s talisman was used solely to punish new ghosts, a fearsome matter indeed.

The resentful ghost grew afraid and asked if there was any way to resist. The cunning ghosts replied, “We treat all ghosts equally, old and new. Many new brothers fear the talisman’s power and cannot endure hardship, so they asked us elder ghosts for a plan. To help the newcomers, the first step is to find a reckless, soul-lost ghost to steal the talisman. Second, we will enter his chamber and stuff his five senses and seven orifices with cow dung and mud, suffocating him alive. Third, we will accompany him to the Court of the Ten Kings, to see if the King of Hell will heed the public will and punish Changfang for abusing his power and oppressing new ghosts, or if he will protect him selfishly. Then we have further methods to deal with him. The plan is set, but we have yet to find such a reckless ghost, so the discussion continues.”

The resentful ghost, naturally mad and impulsive, eager for action, immediately volunteered: “I am newly arrived and have yet to prove myself. Since you elders cannot find such a reckless ghost, I fit the role exactly. May I be of use?” The ghosts, moved by his loyalty, quickly replaced their disdain with warm smiles. One by one, they put on ghostly grins and faces, vying to flatter him with ghostly words and schemes, weaving a web of ghostly intrigue.

At last, the sharp-tongued ghosts took command, sending the new resentful ghost to steal the talisman. Four cunning ghosts and eight fierce ghosts were assigned to follow, each armed with dung and filth, ready to enact the second step once the talisman was secured. Two subtle ghosts were sent as lookouts. Under a bleak wind and a grim ghostly atmosphere, the assembly surged toward Fei’s home. These elder ghosts knew the place well and led the resentful ghost straight to Fei Changfang’s chamber.

At the fourth drumbeat, Changfang was sleeping soundly, without even a dream. The reckless ghost, true to his nature, acted without thought. Ignoring all caution, he stepped forward and probed Changfang’s hair, finding a small slip of paper—the talisman. Hastily pulling it free, he fled, carefree and triumphant.

Seeing Changfang without his talisman, the ghosts grew bolder and began their assault. They stuffed every orifice and cavity on his body tightly, allowing no air to pass. Such torment, if inflicted by mortals, would provoke struggle. But by ghostly hands, it took no time at all; Changfang did not resist and soon passed away, joining the throng of ghosts rushing to the Court of the Ten Kings to plead their case. Thus was Fei Changfang slain by ghosts.

Huan Jing, hearing this, broke out in cold sweat, hastened inside to pay respects, and soon after, overcome by shock and grief, followed his old friend Fei Changfang to the underworld. This was a boon to the King of Hell, who could consolidate several cases, simplifying procedures. Such matters belong to the nether realm. This book does not chronicle the history of the underworld nor bear record of its judgments. The complex outcome of this case must remain untold.

Yet here two points deserve the reader’s attention: First, Huan Jing’s ability to see ghosts came from the Dog Elixir, hence those who can see ghosts are called “dog eyes.” This term originates here. Truly, Huan Jing’s vision was granted by the Dog Elixir, a special eye that merits the name “dog eye.” Today’s so-called dog eyes often lack this elixir. Some enlightened persons say such seers merely exploit this claim for money, not truly seeing ghosts. The author believes that even if they do see ghosts, it is a physiological oddity, not quite matching the true “dog eye.” Still, custom endures, and the author cannot argue against it. Second, the ninth day of the ninth month is the Double Ninth Festival. Nowadays, many climb heights on this day. This practice need not be traced to Huan Jing’s flight from ghosts. He fled to mountains to escape vengeful ghosts. It is unclear what grudge today’s people bear against ghosts that they imitate this. To pass down such baseless customs for two thousand years is both laughable and strange. The author does not oppose climbing heights, nor deny the propriety of ascending on the Double Ninth. Climbing heights refreshes the spirit and benefits the body, and may be done any day, not only the Double Ninth. Moreover, one need not hide at home on that day or oppose customs deliberately. Whether climbing or not, on Double Ninth or any other day, one should not treat climbing as fleeing danger—that alone makes sense and avoids blind imitation.

Putting these words aside, after Changfang’s death, another named Hu Ziyu succeeded him. After Ziyu’s passing, the post passed through two more before, in the Tang dynasty, the Jinshi of Zhongnan Mountain, Zhong Kui, took over. Though a scholar, Zhong Kui was tall and imposing, strong as a tiger. Frustrated in official career, he retired to seclusion. His upright nature earned him the ghost-master’s office. Yet he had a peculiar temper—impatient and fiery—often venting anger on ghosts. He wielded a magical treasure greatly feared by ghosts: a willow branch. Chanting a spell thrice over the willow, he would break off a twig and strike ghosts. Others could not see the ghosts, but heard their piercing wails. After the whipping, bloodstains appeared on the ground. Thus, folk say willow branches scare ghosts. In rural areas, sick people going to doctors often carry willow twigs or place them in carts, believing this repels spirits. Yet the true power lay in Zhong Kui’s spell; with the incantation, any branch, flower, or fruit sufficed. Using willow branches without the spell is to abandon the root and chase the leaves, a foolish error. This, like the earlier tales of Double Ninth climbing and dog eyes, is mere superstition, not worth further mention.

Returning to Zhong Kui: he ruled ghosts with violence, and ghosts resented him deeply. Bold and clever ghosts proposed rebellion. The ghosts, long oppressed, welcomed this. Their plan was cunning: Zhong Kui suffered from poor eyesight and always wore large spectacles to find his way. Without them, he was nearly blind. The ghosts exploited this weakness. When he went out, two long-bodied wraiths followed behind. Seizing an unguarded moment, they snatched his spectacles away. Zhong Kui, now sightless, turned in alarm, but the wraiths vanished without trace. Losing his glasses, he flew into a rage and ran about wildly, unaware that many small ghosts lay in wait, throwing stones to trip him. He fell, half dead, filthy as a mud pig. Finally, several strong ghosts pushed him into a cesspit. Deep in filth, he could neither walk nor climb out. The more he raged, the more trapped he became. Only at midnight did someone hear noises and summon help to rescue him. Thus was the worldly Zhong Kui ensnared by ghosts in a farcical scene.

After this great defeat, Zhong Kui returned home ill. Knowing this was a ghostly revenge plot, he felt his authority lost, his dignity gone. He no longer wished to govern ghosts. Soon after, he died. Since then, no bold soul dared take up the ghost-master’s post lightly. Yet Zhong Kui’s fame endured. Everyone knew he could control ghosts. Each festival eve, households hung his image—this is the meaning behind it.

Who succeeded Zhong Kui? That will be told in the next chapter.
