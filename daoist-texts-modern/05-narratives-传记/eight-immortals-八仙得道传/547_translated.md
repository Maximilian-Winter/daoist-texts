# Chapter Seventy-Nine: When the Ghosts Bewitched Master Zhang and His Hand Seal Failed — Awakening from the Ghostly Maze with a Spirit-Infused Urine

It is said that those who have long dealt with ghosts and spirits are often themselves toyed with by these very phantoms. Thus, after Zhong Kui relinquished his post, this seat of responsibility hung vacant for a long time, for no one dared to shoulder such a grave charge. It was not until the era of the Great Tang that Venus, the Great White Metal Star, convened all the stellar officials and petitioned the Jade Emperor, reporting that fierce ghosts were growing numerous in the world, frequently appearing among the common folk and troubling the masses. They earnestly requested a thorough investigation and the appointment of a capable person to take exclusive charge of ghost governance.

The Jade Emperor approved the petition and inquired, “Who is fit to undertake this office?” Venus then recounted the past failures of various officials and recommended the True Man Zhang of Dragon and Tiger Mountain to concurrently hold this post. For he was born with a seal upon his hand—this very seal could govern spirits, solitary ghosts, and strange specters. If entrusted with this duty, he would surely fulfill it. The Jade Emperor consented and decreed that Venus himself should personally deliver the imperial edict.

Upon arrival at Dragon and Tiger Mountain, the stellar official was met at the cave’s entrance by Master Zhang, who had already received the daily report from the attendant official. The host and guest courteously entered within. The stellar official first proclaimed the Jade Emperor’s decree, to which the Master knelt and accepted with reverence. After the reading, all exchanged bows and took their seats, conversing about affairs celestial and terrestrial.

Master Zhang inquired, “I have lately heard that the Eastern Flower Great Emperor has been commanded to descend to the mortal realm—is this true?” The stellar official replied, “Indeed, it is so. The Great Emperor often says, ‘One more divine being in Heaven is not worth as much as one more immortal in the human world.’ Moreover, he once spoke a careless word before his disciple Zhongli Quan: ‘In the future, I shall save you as my master.’ This unintended phrase unexpectedly became a prophecy. The Jade Emperor, hearing that evil men abound and human hearts decay daily, resolved to select among the divine immortals and stellar deities those of talent, virtue, and profound merit, to descend once more to the mortal world. They would often manifest their dharma bodies, guiding the lost and opening wide the path of awakening. Yet such talents are rare indeed.

“Later, it was said that the Emperor wished to descend, but since his disciple Zhongli Quan had not yet attained the Dao and could not save him from the world, the ancient promise remained unfulfilled, causing delay. Now, Zhongli Quan has been taught the profound scriptures by Li Xuan and has long completed the Great Way. He is fit to be the Emperor’s savior in the world. This was mentioned last year to the Most High Patriarch Laozi, who said, ‘The Emperor’s nature is upright and his conduct free and unrestrained—truly the demeanor of an immortal. Since the ancient promise exists, he should descend to the mortal realm to prove the sincerity of the sage; and also to aid Your Majesty in transforming the people, dispelling evil and returning them to righteousness. This is indeed a most noble deed. Without the Emperor’s virtue and merit, no one else could bear such a heavy responsibility.’ The Jade Emperor received this report with great joy and, when the Emperor entered court, personally gave him instructions. The Emperor earnestly accepted the mandate and wished to descend at once.

“He has now been born into the Lü family by the river, named Dongbin. Before parting with the True Man, he must first visit Mount Hua to notify Zhongli Quan to hasten his salvation work, lest he linger too long in the mortal dust and suffer great calamity. If difficulties arise, both the Emperor and the True Man will do their utmost to guide him at any time. This will be a great merit indeed.” The True Man nodded in agreement.

After the stellar official departed, Master Zhang summoned the spiritual officials, dharma judges, attendants, and clerks of the entire mansion to announce the newly received imperial command. From that day forth, within the four seas, all ghosts and spirits came under the Master’s governance. It is said that until the late Qing dynasty, no change occurred.

Yet there is one small curious incident, long puzzling the world, arising from the tale that Master Zhang was once bewitched by ghosts. Evidently, even one of the Master’s stature and power once trod the same path of failure as the likes of Fei and Zhong. This only shows how difficult it truly is to govern ghosts. According to what the author knows, since the Master took charge of the spirits, a minor upheaval once occurred. But the troublemakers were not the Master himself, but one of his dharma judges. Such judges were chosen from among the fully realized adepts of the world, ranked by their spiritual power into upper, middle, and lower grades.

Toward the end of the Tang dynasty, the Master’s mansion received a new dharma judge, sharing the same surname as the Master. Young, handsome, and talented, he was much favored by the Master. When he first arrived, he was only a lower-grade judge. Within less than half a year, he was promoted to middle-grade. This man was originally the son of a poor family in Jiangxi. As a child, he begged with his parents to survive. People saw his fair appearance and upright character. Though among beggars, he bore the air of a noble youth. Thus, all pitied him; wherever he went, no need to speak, he was doubly cared for, providing warmth and food for his parents.

This dharma judge was also filial. The food he begged was first offered to his parents, then he ate the remainder. When the cold was severe, he would settle his parents in an ancient temple and go out alone to beg. Whatever he gained, he still offered first to his parents. Later, when his father fell ill and they had no money for a doctor, he wrote a heartfelt plea for help. His words were well composed, and people were especially moved. Within half a day, he collected ten taels of silver and happily returned to the temple. Yet his father’s fate was short; he passed away amid illness.

In his grief, the dharma judge cut a piece of his own thigh flesh, cooked it into a medicine, and gave it to his father. After one bowl, the illness turned for the better. The next morning, he sought out a doctor he knew, hoping to bring him to the temple to examine his father and prevent further suffering. But fate was cruel; by the time the doctor arrived, his father had already passed.

The sorrow of this dharma judge was beyond words. Weeping and wailing, he buried his father and spent the ten taels of silver. He and his mother, relying on each other, begged here and there through many days. That year, famine and poor harvests prevailed, bandits were as numerous as hair. Those with property fled afar. The few remaining farmers suffered as much as the dharma judge and his mother. He found no more to beg or seek. Though young and strong, he could endure hunger and cold, but how to care for his aged mother? Every day he returned empty-handed, seeing his mother suffer, his heart pierced like a knife. He wept in secret, hiding his pain from her, fearing to cause her sorrow. Truly, the dharma judge had come to the end of his rope.

But when one has a kind heart, Heaven surely hears and will not let him perish. The Immortal Zhang Guo heard of his plight and transformed into a Daoist, using the method of turning stone to gold to send him fifty taels of silver and taught him many healing and saving arts. From then on, the dharma judge rented a house with the money, practiced sorcery to cure illnesses, and had many successes. His clientele prospered at once. Three years passed; his mother’s health improved, growing robust and hearty. Zhang Guo again appeared and said, “Previously I taught you half for saving the world, half to support your livelihood. But this cannot last forever. Better come with me to Dragon and Tiger Mountain. I will recommend you to Master Zhang as a dharma judge. What say you?”

The dharma judge closed his shop, gave away all remaining silver except what he shared with poor relatives and friends, and devoted the rest to his mother. He then followed Zhang Guo to Dragon and Tiger Mountain and became a dharma judge.

This dharma judge was truly a prodigiously clever man. Whenever the Master performed dharma, wrote talismans, or chanted incantations, he stood nearby, attentively observing, and secretly learned many talismans and spells. One day, the Master was invited by a Daoist friend to play chess and left the dharma judge in charge of the cave. Bored and idle, he thought to test the ghost-summoning method he had stolen the day before. So, pointing his spear-like finger, he wrote a talisman and slapped the Master’s golden plaque.

In an instant, the room filled with countless ghosts—some with broken legs and arms, some with burnt heads and faces, some with tongues hanging out, some with eyes bulging from their sockets, and many other strange, terrifying specters, all gathered in a noisy throng. Seeing that the summoner was not Master Zhang but a stranger, the ghosts were somewhat perplexed.

Moreover, since the dharma judge was not authorized to govern them and was somewhat arrogant, seven or eight of them surrounded him, demanding, “Why have you summoned us?” The dharma judge, seeing such hideous ghosts, was already faint with fear and could not answer. The room was packed tight, and outside the door, more ghosts arrived in groups, pressing inside. Seeing his timidity, the ghosts despised him further—some shouted insults, some sneered mockingly, some threatened to kill this wild Daoist, others to drag him out and throw him into a cesspit.

Some said, “We were just about to enjoy a feast at a ritual elsewhere, but he summoned us here for nothing. We lost our meal for no reason. He must compensate us!” Such a dispute frightened the dharma judge so much that he lost all memory of the spell to dismiss ghosts. The ghosts grew more riotous, hoisting him upside down—head down, feet up—for half a day. Then they put him down, stuffed his mouth with horse manure and cow urine, and tried to drag him out to throw him into the cesspit.

Fortunately, the Master returned, saw the scene, and immediately used the dismissal spell to drive the ghosts away. The ghosts argued among themselves, saying the dharma judge should not have played such a prank and must be punished. The Master, reluctant to oppose the crowd, soothed them kindly and promised to admonish the dharma judge. Yet the ghosts would not disperse and insisted the Master punish him openly.

The Master, enraged, formed a hand seal with his left hand and displayed the seal on his right, shouting, “Little ghosts, how dare you so disrespect the rules! Cease your insolence! When my hand seal and talisman combine, you will all turn to blood and water in an instant!”

In truth, the Master was like any mortal, only born with the duty to govern ghosts and punish monsters, marked by the seal on his hand. Talismans and spells only gain efficacy when combined with this seal. The tradition was always to select among the sons those born with the seal to inherit the office, thus avoiding disputes. According to ancient texts, those born with markings on their hands are not unique individuals. The Master’s birth with the seal follows the same principle. His seal and talismans can warn unruly immortals, control spiritual transformations and demons, so how could mere ghosts not fear?

Seeing the Master’s anger, the ghosts feared he might truly act. Their ghostly bodies could not endure, so with a sudden wild whistle, they all fled cleanly.

When the Master turned to look at the dharma judge, he was speechless, his body bruised and swollen, pain beyond words. The Master, half amused, half angry, seeing how badly he had suffered, and being fond of him, refrained from harsh punishment and instead healed his wounds with talismans. Then he admonished him: “Talismans are most efficacious and also most fearsome. Misuse them, and you may bring death upon yourself. Moreover, to use them frivolously as a game is to add sin. Fortunately, you only summoned a band of wild ghosts and solitary souls. If you had called down the stellar gods or our mansion’s spiritual officials without business for them, your body would have long since been shattered. Could you still be here to face me?

“In the past, a certain Judge Wang in this mansion once, having no rough paper when nature called, formed a hand seal and summoned a spiritual official on duty to bring him paper. The Yellow Spiritual Official struck him with a steel whip, sending him tumbling down a deep cliff, leaving not a bone behind. Such things even I cannot save. Do you think that is not terrifying?” These words made the dharma judge break out in cold sweat, unable to utter a word for a long time.

Yet these ghosts, though lacking the majesty of divine generals or the status of spiritual officials, were stubborn indeed. Hearing the Master would not punish the dharma judge, they grew indignant. In a wilderness, they held a grand assembly to reprimand him. Among them was a fox spirit, once struck down by the Master’s Five Thunders. Because he had many human contacts, he remained among the ghosts. Though not human, he was cunning, ruthless, and full of schemes. He proposed, “Those who serve as our ghost masters, ghost officials, and ghost leaders, even as fierce as Fei Changfang and Zhong the scholar, cannot withstand our collective uproar. Now the Master relies only on one seal; aside from the seal, talismans are no threat. We should feign entreaty and approach him slowly. If he allows us, we will immediately denounce the dharma judge and punish him severely before all, then withdraw. From then on, the Master will not dare ignore us. If he remains stubborn, we will seize his sealed hand, hold it down so he cannot raise it, surround him, and use the ghostly maze to bewilder him, leaving him trapped with no way out or in. Then we will have him fully under our control, and he will lose all pride and no longer dare to shout at us.”

All the ghosts agreed heartily. Indeed, some among them plotted. When Master Zhang went out at night, they blocked his path and first spoke kindly to petition. The Master, seeing their constant threats, was displeased and scolded them. The ghosts then chose a group of fierce, tiger-like fiends to pretend to plead. They approached close, and at the Master’s scolding, they sprang up, pressing down his sealed hand. The Master, seeing the ghosts would not disperse, and with attendants and spiritual officials watching, could not lose face. His anger flared; he formed a hand seal and raised the sealed hand—but it felt as heavy as a thousand pounds and could not be lifted. Realizing he had fallen into their trap, his heart panicked and his spiritual acuity stalled. Daoist power depends on a single point of spirit; with that blocked, he was like an ordinary man.

Looking around, he saw none of his attendant spiritual officials. The more panicked he became, the more confused he was. He was surrounded by wild ghosts, who clamored and laughed as they pressed him on.

In that moment, his mind was utterly muddled. East and west were sheer cliffs and vast waters. He found a path, but after a few steps, another barrier blocked his way, nearly bruising his face. Most unbearable was the sealed hand, weighed down unbearably, growing sore and painful. His ears heard voices shouting, “True Man Zhang, surrender!” “Master Zhang, abdicate quickly!” Others said, “Do you still dare be stubborn? Still dare to scorn us? Hand over that Zhang quickly!” These words left the Master powerless—unable to agree or refuse, unable to support either choice. This was the strange drama of Master Zhang bewitched by ghosts, as told among the people.

Trapped by ghosts and powerless, the Master thought, “I must wait for dawn, when yang energy rises and ghosts disperse. Then I will consider further.” But the hand under pressure seemed about to break. He sat down, resting the hand on a large stone, hoping the stone’s strength might ease the burden. Yet the ghosts, cunning and cruel, knowing his intent, sent more wild spirits to increase the weight tenfold. His arm, pressed between stone and burden, was nearly crushed.

The Master involuntarily sighed to Heaven, “Who would have thought that, born as Master, titled True Man, I would be bewitched by mere ghosts, my life hanging by a thread? Oh Heaven, why do you not protect me? Why burden me with this task? My death matters little, but I fear no one will dare take up ghost governance henceforth, and even the Master’s seat will remain empty.”

Before his sigh ended, a loud voice thundered from the clouds, “True Man, Master of ghosts, do you not even know how to handle these little ghostly maze tricks?” Hearing this, the Master suddenly awakened, “Ah, I was truly dazed! How could I forget such simple arts?” Struggling to rise, he lowered his robes and urinated a great hot stream, turning around to sprinkle all sides. Before he finished, ghostly screams echoed from all directions. Suddenly his vision cleared as if a veil was lifted; the heavy hand relaxed as if freed from a great burden. The Master raised his hands to the sky, thanking the immortal who reminded him, found his way, and slowly returned.

What happened after the Master returned to his mansion? How did he deal with the ghosts? And who was the immortal that called out from the clouds? These will be revealed in the next chapter.
