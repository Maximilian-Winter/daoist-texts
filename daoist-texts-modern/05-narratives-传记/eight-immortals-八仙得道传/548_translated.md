# Chapter Eighty: The Prophecy Revealed—Zhang the Celestial Master Is Deposed; The Birth of Lü Chunyang Foretold

Now, as for the matter of Celestial Master Zhang being ensnared by ghosts, this was already explained in the previous chapter. The Master, with but a single stream of urine, dispersed the gathered ghosts. This tale may sound almost comical, yet it contains profound truth. Originally, the Master was born into his position, the seal of office firmly in hand. His vital energy, naturally, was unlike that of ordinary men—more so, since he was the Celestial Master. Though the Master was still a mortal man, his constant proximity to immortals, demons, and ghosts, and his frequent use of numinous talismans and incantations, meant he had to cultivate the dao diligently. Hence, his yang energy was far more vigorous and robust than common folk. That seemingly trivial stream of urine, though apparently powerless, upon touching a ghost’s form, was like scalding oil poured on fire—an agony no spirit could endure. Thus, the Master’s ability to scatter the ghosts with a single stream was no mere tale.

In our times, travelers who journey through mountain valleys at night often find themselves bewildered and dazed by ghostly assaults, trapped in a bewildering maze. If one’s vital energy is strong and fiery, one might repel such spirits with urine. But if the body is weak and of a cold, yin nature, then a different method must be used—spitting blood. The best source is to bite one’s tongue and spray blood in all directions; its efficacy rivals that of yang energy’s urine. If the one afflicted is female, no matter the constitution, blood is the remedy. Are these stories reliable? Alas, the author has never seen ghosts in his lifetime and dares not mislead others with fanciful tales. Only this one remark: these are hearsay, and responsibility is not assumed. But the Master’s tale is true and trustworthy. Should readers doubt, they may visit Mount Longhu to investigate firsthand, and there, truth and falsehood will become clear.

Enough idle words. Returning to the Master, after suffering this secret injury, upon returning to his residence, two spiritual officials and attendants who had accompanied him came to pay their respects. The Master recounted the entire incident without concealment. This stirred the Heavenly Official Wang and Earthly Official Huang into a fury. They immediately drew out their steel whips, shouting, “The ghosts have insulted the Celestial Master; we are no longer to be reckoned with in their eyes. We ask the Master to summon all the ghosts at once and punish each with a lash. If ghostly winds grow rampant and their power swells unchecked, how will we ever control them?” With that, they waited angrily for orders.

The Master smiled and soothed them: “Do I not know how hateful the ghosts are? But consider, they are spirits, many without offerings or worship. Their plight is truly pitiable and deserving of compassion. Zhang the Judge acted without understanding, rashly wielding dao methods—his punishment is well deserved. Though I have sternly reprimanded, it was not the ghosts themselves who saw it. They hate Zhang the Judge deeply and thus trouble me as well. Their conduct is detestable, yet their feelings can be forgiven. Fortunately, I have not suffered loss. Better to show mercy and spare them, thus revealing our magnanimity and benevolence. I hope you will let go of anger and not harbor resentment.”

Hearing this, the two spiritual officials calmed their hearts. Wang the Official first sheathed his steel whip and said calmly, “Though that is so, the Master may show mercy personally, but the heavenly laws allow no leniency. Ghosts may be pitiable, but among them are ringleaders and chief offenders. Such wicked spirits must not be pardoned. If all are excused, not only will the Master’s kindness be doubted, but they will suspect cowardice. If we neglect our duties and fail to enforce the law, then even minor grievances will provoke their hostilities at any time and place. Their cunning plots, ghostly stratagems, and secret tricks will multiply endlessly. Worse than ghostly walls or ghostly hands pressing down, these mischiefs will overwhelm us. Even with our dao methods, we cannot guard against every threat. Should a great calamity arise, we will be punished by heavenly law. The Master’s present mercy will become the root of future guilt. What is more, across the vast divine land, ghosts will devour humans. When ghosts overpower men and men learn to become ghosts, what world will remain?” The Master shuddered at these words.

As he pondered how to reply, suddenly a crane’s cry pierced the sky, and an immortal descended. The Master hastened with the two officials and four celestial attendants to greet him. It was none other than the Great Immortal Zhang Guo, who had recommended Zhang the Judge. Zhang Guo, upon seeing the Master, quickly cupped his hands and said, “Most sorry, True Man. Because of my recommendation, the Master was indeed ambushed by demons. Had I not chanced by and warned you, you would have suffered their torment—this would be my fault.” The Master recognized Zhang Guo’s voice from the heavens and thanked him profusely. They all respectfully entered and took their seats.

Zhang Guo first smiled at the two officials: “I overheard your wise words in the sky. Your talk of ghostly power overwhelming men and men learning to become ghosts is terrifying, but indeed such a day will come—only a thousand years hence. Good and evil, yin and yang, these are the two paths that divide all things. In the beginning of chaos, all were undifferentiated beings—without cunning or deceit, and thus good. But as time descends, cunning grows stronger day by day, and the world and human hearts grow thinner and thinner in virtue. When virtue is exhausted and yin energy flourishes, that is the time of ghostly dominance you speak of. Ghosts belong to the utmost yin; what separates humans from ghosts is a spark of yang energy. When humans lose that yang, how are they different from ghosts? It is not that ghosts can subdue men, nor that ghosts seek to turn men into ghosts. But then, ghosts remain ghosts, and men become like ghosts. Thus, the world will be filled with base, filthy, sly, and treacherous natures. Officials will ignore the public good and seek only bribes. Bribery will be public, no need for secrecy—this is like ghosts stealing food. Among common people, filial piety will be abandoned, and licentiousness promoted. All will seek only self-interest, ignoring propriety and righteousness. Like ghosts without hearts, they will wreak havoc without concern for others. Such ghostly hearts, ghostly guts, ghostly schemes, and ghostly wisdom will surely pass to living men. Then there will be no difference between men and ghosts, and the vast cosmos will truly become a ghost world. But this is the future. From my view, it will come in about fifteen hundred years. For now, it is too soon to speak of it.”

The Master laughed and said, “Old friend, you have come from afar just to vent your grievances.” This made Zhang Guo laugh as well. He added, “You may think my words excessive, but this is no jest. The day will surely come. The dao of Heaven and Earth is nothing but yin and yang. When yang flourishes, yin declines; when yin flourishes, yang fades. The ancients said the world has long been governed by cycles of order and chaos—that is the principle. At first, there is war and death, battles on all sides—a common name for great disorder, but not true chaos. Because in such disorder, only affairs are disturbed. Though affairs are chaotic, men remain men. True chaos comes when human hearts die and men transform into ghosts. Then is the real great disorder. The saying ‘human hearts deceive and Heaven’s way reverses’ is the perfect commentary on chaos. This true chaos corresponds to the primordial era of undifferentiated beings—one of full yang, the other of full yin. This process from yang to yin takes thousands or tens of thousands of years. At the peak of disorder, all blends into one—but this blending is the opposite of ancient chaos. One is yang extreme, orderly and harmonious, bustling without division, full of infinite joy. The other is yin extreme, chaotic and upside down, confused and indistinct, like a smoky, pestilent fog. When human hearts reach this point, it is the utmost chaos. Chaos lies in the heart, not in affairs. This is fundamental chaos, not the minor disturbances of place and time. Only when combined with the ancient era of undifferentiated beings can one speak of order and disorder. After this, Heaven and Earth will reunite. Another period of opening and clearing will begin, returning to the era of undifferentiated beings, the start of renewed order. Such is the dao of Heaven; none can change it. Even great sages like the Jade Emperor, Primordial Lord Lao, the Queen Mother, the Western Buddha, and Dongfang Shuo cannot reverse it.”

The Master and officials sighed deeply. The Master said, “When that time comes, what will become of our descendants?” Zhang Guo smiled: “Here is a matter of difficulty and duration. True Man, do not be angry. I can make a prophecy: if you, True Man, are born and attain the dao, becoming Celestial Master, your blessings will be great, but so will your sufferings. As for me, a humble immortal who began as a small creature, my position today, though lowly, was not easily gained. In the ghost world, I remain a minor immortal. But your descendants, Celestial Masters, will suffer some loss; indeed, the title of Celestial Master may end then. Even if restored, it will be only after the second opening.”

The Master was somewhat displeased but, being a man of composure, smiled and said, “As you say, even the Jade Emperor, the Buddha, and other sages cannot turn the tide. Besides, what matters a thousand five hundred years from now? Fortunately, by then your virtue and reputation will surely deepen. With you high in the celestial palace, my descendants need not fear lack of support. Better not to cling to the Celestial Master title or the seal of office—what importance do these hold?” Laughing, he ended.

Zhang Guo, fearing he had spoken too freely, quickly changed the subject and gradually spoke of Zhang the Judge. The Master summoned Zhang the Judge, who, upon seeing Zhang Guo, looked somewhat guilty. Zhang Guo smiled: “Young men often act without regard to consequences, unaware of when to advance or retreat. Most people are so; you are not alone. But my purpose today is to settle this heavy case. First, as the officials said, the Master can be merciful, but the heavenly agents cannot. At least the ringleaders among the ghosts must be punished.”

He then pulled out a list and handed it to the Master: “I have already investigated this matter for the Master. These wicked ghosts are the ringleaders and chief offenders. Without punishing them, the ghost world cannot be peaceful. Second, regarding Zhang the Judge’s matter: though not large, it is not small either. He acted out of momentary playfulness, experimenting with what he had learned to assist the Master in the future. There was no malice. So this matter can be somewhat forgiven, but he must not remain here. First, it would make the Master seem too lenient and lose respect; second, ghosts are often unreasonable. After the Master punishes the ringleaders, their hatred for you will deepen. Without skill, how can you resist them? Better to leave here and return home to care for your mother. When she passes, find a famous mountain grotto to cultivate. With diligent effort, you may one day become a terrestrial immortal.”

Zhang the Judge thanked the Master and followed Zhang Guo, bidding farewell to the Master and his colleagues. Zhang Guo mounted a cloud and first took him back to his native place to care for his mother. Before departing, Zhang Guo tossed him a silver coin, saying, “Use this as capital to work hard and help others when you can; such merit will strengthen your foundation. I will tell you your past life: you were once a disciple taken in by Immortal Zhongli before he attained the dao, named Mountain Moon Child. Later, Zhongli was reprimanded by his master, the Eastern Emperor, for taking disciples before his own attainment, and so dared not seek you again. But immortals do not speak lightly. Having accepted you and benefited from you, unless you commit evil, he must find a way to fulfill your destiny. After attaining the dao, he sent your record to the underworld for judgment and reincarnation here, to test your character. Because you are filial and loyal, he was confident and resolved to promote you to fulfill your old wish. Now, as the Eastern Emperor will soon descend, he has designated you as a disciple. Remembering his own rise by the Emperor’s guidance, he has incarnated as your teacher to instruct you anytime and anywhere. Unable to be present himself, he entrusted me with your affairs. Your mother is ill and has but a few years left. Leaving the Master’s residence, you may care for her and fulfill your human duties. When she passes, go to White Wind Rock beneath Mount Wudang in Fujian to cultivate. When the time comes, I will return to guide your practice.” With that, he raised his sleeve and vanished. Zhang the Judge knelt and saw him off.

From then on, he obeyed orders, married, read fortunes, earned money to support his mother, and began nourishing his qi. After five years, his mother died. He left home and traveled to Mount Wudang in Fujian, finding White Wind Rock and a cave beneath it, where he cultivated. Fifty years later, Zhang Guo personally inspected his progress and taught him many dao methods. Three hundred years hence, he was elevated to terrestrial immortal. But that is a later tale, briefly noted here.

Now, returning to Zhongli Quan at Lü Dongbin’s home, he had taught him for five years. This was during the Tang dynasty, after Empress Wu had returned power to the throne. The family had a tradition of official service, and Lü’s parents naturally hoped he would inherit the bureaucratic career. But Lü was born with a different nature. No matter how profound the classical texts for the imperial examinations, he found them shallow and crude, unworthy of reading. His father, exasperated, tested him before his teacher. Yet Lü remembered every word perfectly. At eight years old, he could compose and copy poetry and prose with both roughness and subtlety, impressing even his father. His father then tried to stump him with the hardest questions from ancient books, but Lü answered promptly, with many insights beyond the ancients—truly a kindred spirit.

His father could not challenge him and nodded with a sigh: “This truly is our family’s steed of a thousand miles. But a mere child who disparages the ancients’ books is somewhat arrogant. I do not know what books there are beyond the sages’ classics to study.” Lü replied, “Confucius’ teachings are the path for worldly affairs, plain and accessible, fit for human models. If all followed this, the world might be peaceful for a time, but not eternally. The transcendent mysteries lie in Lord Lao’s *Dao De Jing*. If all practiced it, there would be eternal order, no chaos. This truth should be embraced, yet today it is neglected as heresy. Many profound teachings and orthodox dao arts are the highest human learning. Today’s self-styled adepts despise these. This is why the great dao does not flourish and the world remains in turmoil.” These words both amazed and vexed his father.

What happened next is unknown; we shall see in the next chapter.
