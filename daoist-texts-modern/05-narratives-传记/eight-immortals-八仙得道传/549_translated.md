# Chapter Eighty-One: Lüzu’s Lofty Discourse Startles His Elder Father; Zhongxian’s Verses Warn the Worthy Disciples

Now, it happened that Lü Dongbin spoke to his father with a grand discourse on transcending the world, so profound and startling that his father stood dumbfounded, eyes wide and mouth agape. Then he scolded sharply: “You boy, you barely grasp the surface—just as the ancients said, one can only remember a few classics. How dare you, not being a sage, slander the Dao and utter such wild nonsense? Our Huaxia China has long governed by the dao of Yao, Shun, Wen, Wu, Zhou, and Confucius, passed down unbroken for thousands of years. In our present dynasty, every sage ruler has made it their task to uphold righteousness and cast out evil. Countless learned scholars dare not utter a word of dissent. You, a mere child, what great insight could you possess to speak such lawless, unbridled words?” Saying this, he cupped his hands toward the teacher and said, “This foolish dog rambles so; I beg you, master, to kindly bend your will and guide him aright. If you can save this humble home from abandoning the fragrance of books and ensure the ancestral legacy endures forever, I shall be endlessly grateful.” With that, he stormed angrily back inside.

Zhongli Quan laughed and said to Dongbin, “Because of your few wild words, I too have gotten myself into an awkward position.” Dongbin straightened his posture, eyes wide and round, and said, “Master, please do not say so. I have taken your teachings to heart and already know that within Heaven and Earth, and beyond Heaven and Earth, there is but this one Dao. Outside the Dao, there is no other dao; within the Dao, there is no other dao. Though I am young, I already understand the dao to save the world—only this one Dao. If Heaven does not give birth to me, so be it; but since I am born, I swear to lead all beings of the world into the Great Dao together. If even one person fails to attain the Dao, I will not achieve it alone. I also deeply believe in the Confucian five relationships and the principle of filial piety. Though father forbids me to cultivate the Dao, I will gradually move his heart to enter the Dao. Moreover, I privately think that to save the world and rescue people, one must begin with those closest—first kin, then distant. If one’s own flesh and blood do not believe, how can others be moved? Master, my work to save the world must begin at home. Now, father wishes me to study, gain fame, pass the imperial exams, become a high official, marry and bear children, and carry on the ancestral incense. To move his old heart, I must first obey his commands in all things, show him by example, win his favor, and then it will be easier to turn his mind. Master, how do you judge my understanding?”

Zhongli Quan heard this and praised him greatly: “The three teachings differ in ways but share one principle. Confucianism instructs people, valuing loyalty and filial piety above all. Since we cultivate the Dao, we especially should keep loyalty and filial piety in our hearts at all times. If one can, as you say, fulfill all human responsibilities and then retire to the mountains to cultivate, that would be the best and most complete. But I fear that when worldly affairs weigh heavily, the thought of the Dao grows light; not only will the grand vow to save all beings be hard to fulfill, but you yourself will rot with the grass and trees, bearing no fruit at all. Is that not dreadful?”

Dongbin laughed and said, “Master, you underestimate me too much. Before I was born, my mother had two auspicious dreams—many celestial officials, arrayed in ceremony, came to escort me into incarnation. When I was born, the room was filled with fragrance, and outside the courtyard, celestial music floated in the air, lingering for a long time before fading. Thus, my father often said I was destined for great fortune. That need not be said. What is stranger still is that I often dream of a white-haired, white-bearded star official who calls himself Li Chang Geng. I have long heard that in the Jade Emperor’s palace there is a Great White Star Lord surnamed Li, named Chang Geng—most likely this very one. In dreams, he often instructs me in many profound Daoist mysteries and tells me to remember always: ‘Better one immortal in Heaven than one sage on Earth.’ He also says these two phrases were spoken by me myself. In the dream, I seem to recall having said these words, but cannot remember when or to whom I spoke them. Upon waking, my spiritual palace is clear and bright, and I keep these words imprinted on my heart. That is why I have this great vow to save the world. Master, what I say is not a passing fancy or idle talk; it is ever present, this thought in my heart!”

Zhongli Quan laughed and said, “If that is so, do you remember where you first saw me?” Dongbin smiled, “That I cannot recall clearly. But I have told you before, the moment I saw you, it felt as if we were old acquaintances. It seems these things must be from a past life.” Zhongli Quan stroked his beard and laughed heartily. After laughing, he nodded gently but said no more. Dongbin paid little heed and said again, “Though I say so, my heart is troubled by a great matter.” Zhongli Quan nodded and smiled, “I understand, I understand. But it matters not.” Dongbin asked in surprise, “Master, can you guess what weighs on my heart?” Zhongli Quan laughed, “I suppose you are eager to cultivate the Dao and save the world, but you cannot but first move your parents. Fame and fortune you shall have; within ten years, all can be accomplished. But to bear sons and daughters, you cannot avoid the matters of male and female chambers. You fear this will break your dharma body and hinder your cultivation. Is this not your worry? Know this: you are of pure yang constitution; even if you break the precept of chastity, your vital energy will still respond and produce children without disturbing your essence and blood. This is because your root nature is thick and your yang vigor abundant—such is your advantage. For others, breaking chastity delays their Dao practice by a thousand years or more, even losing all merit, becoming no different from ordinary men. That is the greatest danger indeed!”

Dongbin heard this and rejoiced greatly: “Master, this is exactly my concern. Now, with your guidance, my worry is gone. But I must ask—are you human or immortal? How do you know so much about me? And you teach the profound Dao every day; though I am foolish, I know these mysteries are not to be spoken lightly except by a Great Golden Immortal or one with a thousand years’ practice. Clearly, you are no ordinary man. I also recall when you came to my home, many strange things happened. Even now my family often speaks of it as a marvel.”

Before Dongbin finished, Zhongli Quan laughed and asked, “What did they say about me?” Dongbin smiled, “They said that when you first came, you came to our door seeking my father. Father, seeing you in tattered clothes, thought you came to ask for help. At first, he did not want to see you, but secretly peered inside and saw your eyes bright and your face full of pure qi. He then said you were no supplicant and hurried to treat you with courtesy. When he heard your lofty words and clear eloquence, a few sentences astonished him greatly, and he admired you deeply. He asked your purpose, and you solemnly said you wished to take me as your disciple. At that time, father was troubled because I was too clever and mischievous and could find no good teacher. Since you, a man of great talent, volunteered yourself, how could he be displeased? Yet he still harbors doubts. For many years, you never revealed your hometown or origins, we know not your background or deeds, and you have never returned home nor sent letters, nor have any relatives come to visit. This is why they remain puzzled about you.”

Zhongli Quan laughed heartily at this. Dongbin continued, “I was only five years old then. Father said I was a prodigy from birth. At four, I had finished the classics; at five, I astonished two teachers so they left in shame. Now, with your honored presence to instruct me, all is well. Yet I fear that with my talents, I might look down on you, so I called out to pay respects first. But when I saw you, it was as if Heaven sent me a perfect teacher—I could not help but be filled with joy and respect. Even before learning, my heart was already won. So I say, this is truly my master!” Zhongli Quan nodded and said, “Perhaps we share some past affinity.” Lü Dongbin said with shining eyes, “Master, our past affinity is certain, but I believe you must be a celestial immortal. Perhaps by a vow in a previous life, you descended to teach me and lead me into the Dao. Master, since today is idle, why not tell me about your past life?”

At these words, Zhongli Quan’s face changed, and he scolded, “How can there be immortals in the mortal world? How can immortals come down to teach men? You child speak nonsense. No wonder your father calls you presumptuous!” Lü Dongbin was not afraid of the rebuke but laughed instead: “Master, you jest to tease me. I know you must be a celestial immortal. If immortals cannot descend, how come many true traces of immortals are passed down in the world? Generally, true beings do not reveal themselves lightly; revealing oneself brings many troubles, so they keep it secret. Since you do not admit it, I dare not guess further. When the time comes, you will surely tell me.” With that, he ceased questioning and returned to his studies.

Lü Dongbin’s talent was high, and with a famous master’s guidance, he naturally became a supreme prodigy. At this time, it was the Zhenguan era of the Tang dynasty. At twelve, Lü Dongbin went with a group of relatives to take the imperial exam. He triumphed in one attempt, ranking first among the jinshi, and was called the “Little Talent of the River Central.” Soon, great families with daughters wished to take him as a worthy son-in-law. Lü Dongbin followed his master’s teachings and his parents’ wishes. At fifteen, he married the daughter of the local governor He as his wife. Their love was deep and sincere. Two years later, they had a son. Dongbin also gained official rank and served for over a decade, with Zhongli Quan always by his side.

One day, the master, disciple, and father drank wine together in the government office, chatting idly about politics and people’s livelihood. Suddenly, a clerk came in with congratulations, saying there was news of a promotion. The father and son showed joy, but Zhongli Quan smiled quietly, saying nothing and offering no congratulations. Lü Dongbin’s father laughed and said, “Master, a true gentleman should not be concerned with fame and rank. My son is but barely of age, and his career is too smooth. When ordinary men succeed too early, pride and arrogance easily arise. Pride blocks progress, arrogance invites scorn. All envy him, but I fear this is no blessing. Only you have watched over and corrected him; my son is fortunate! The Lü family is fortunate!” Zhongli Quan laughed looking up at Heaven: “In this world, who is not deluded by fame and fortune yet advances on the Dao? Old sir only fears his pride is not a blessing, but that is a shallow concern!” These words silenced father and son.

Zhongli Quan raised his cup and staggered from the table, walking a few steps while chanting:

> To meet a true immortal teaching the Dao is rare,  
> When shall I return to follow him afar?  
> He claims his dwelling lies beyond the blue sea,  
> Another is the foremost peak of Penglai’s spree.

Then he chanted again:

> Do not tire of laughter and frequent mirth,  
> Easy to think of partings that wound the heart’s worth.  
> Leisurely bending fingers to count from the start,  
> How many find true peace in this world’s art?

Finishing, he laughed heartily: “Amazing! Today I’ve been drunk by worthy Qiaozi’s wine. I must take my leave.” Saying so, he hurried out. Lü Dongbin and his father both found his words and manner strange and said he was truly drunk. Lü Dongbin, who respected his master most of all, seeing him leave in such a drunken state, quickly informed his father and hurried after him to Zhongli Quan’s chamber. Zhongli Quan muttered and mumbled as he walked, saying things no one could understand. Upon entering, he vomited a foul mess, the stench unbearable. He paid no mind to those following and went straight to bed, lying down with his clothes on. Lü Dongbin feared he might catch cold and gently called to him by the ear: “Master, please sleep well. Sleeping like this will bring cold.” Zhongli Quan opened his drowsy, drunken eyes and chuckled: “To be drunk in life is like ascending to the Heavenly Palace. Might I take a journey from here to Heaven?” Dongbin laughed: “Master, you jest. I am but a mortal body; how could I ascend to Heaven? If I could, I would seek it eagerly and not refuse.” Zhongli Quan shouted: “Nonsense! Born in Heaven, yet you burrow into Hell—what talk of wishing to ascend to Heaven?” Then he laughed again, shook his head, and said: “This circle is fearful! This circle is fearful!” Saying this, he soon snored deeply, drifting off.

Since passing the exam, Lü Dongbin’s fame and fortune grew smoothly, but his daily affairs were all vexing troubles. Though young and vigorous, with high talent and vision, no matter the unjust cases or difficulties, once in his hands, all were swiftly and properly resolved. His reputation outside grew day by day. He himself began to feel the pleasures therein, gradually intoxicated by fame. His wife He was both talented and beautiful. Since his official career began, he also purchased two concubines, both elegant, refined, and wise. Lü Dongbin could not help but praise to his master the virtues and beauty of his wife and concubines. Zhongli Quan only smiled and nodded, neither discouraging nor speaking any dispiriting words. Yet from then on, whenever Lü Dongbin spoke to him, Zhongli Quan refused to discuss profound matters, replying only briefly to spare his face. Sometimes, when Lü Dongbin grew impatient, he said, “Master, do you doubt me unworthy? That I have entered officialdom and forgotten my true nature, thus you abandon me as if discarded?” Zhongli Quan laughed: “No, no! Cultivating the Dao is not in many words; the Dao values non-action. Once spoken, it is no longer the true Dao. How would you have me speak to suit your wishes?” Lü Dongbin dared not speak further, and in his heart constantly restrained himself, fearing that a single slip might shake his resolve and let worldly temptations lead him astray. Yet, unknown to him, desire for worldly things subtly and imperceptibly influences people. Given Dongbin’s foundation, wisdom, and aspirations, and with such a master guiding and supervising day and night, by all reason he should advance smoothly on the Great Dao. With his fame, beauty, and all worldly splendors, no temptation should draw him back to the mundane path. Yet, though reason says so, reality is not always so. Even Lü Chunyang at that time showed signs of gradual confusion by worldly affairs. Zhongli Quan, as master and his disciple in a past life, bore sole responsibility for Dongbin’s cultivation. How could he let go easily? He resolved to seize the opportunity to enlighten him, and at this banquet, feigning drunkenness and retiring early, he teased Dongbin with a few sharp words.

Sure enough, Dongbin, of the thickest root nature, upon hearing these words, felt as if struck by a heavy blow, like a clear bell toll in the silent night awakening him from a dream. He stared blankly at his master, now asleep and snoring loudly, the wine breath pungent. Moreover, the vomit was filthy and foul, stinging the nose—anyone would find it unbearable. Yet Dongbin, as a young official and noble, seemed deaf and blind, feeling nothing. He stood with hands cupped high, reverently at his master’s bedside, neither daring to leave nor to call. He stood thus for more than three hours. Many servants came and went, seeing this young lord standing as if dazed by his master’s bed, feeling astonished but afraid to ask.

Among them was an old steward, the Lü family’s chief servant, who could speak a word and wield some authority even before the patriarch. Naturally, his power near this young master was even greater. Hearing reports from all, he feared there might be some special secret concerning the young lord’s future. Guided by conscience, he must uncover the truth. He also feared the young lord might stand so long he would be too weary to work. And knowing the master loved the young lord more sincerely than even his parents, he wondered why such acting was needed, causing the disciple such devoted reverence. Could it be that the young lord had wronged the master? If so, the steward would apologize on his behalf. With these three concerns, he boldly entered, quietly tugged the young lord’s sleeve, startling him awake as if from a dream. Dongbin asked hastily, “Who is so rude?” Seeing the steward, he hurriedly bowed and asked, “Old steward, what brings you here?” The steward whispered his suspicions, which left Dongbin speechless.

Indeed, his behavior invited suspicion, yet he had done no wrong to the master nor had any demands. In truth, he had a very weighty matter in his heart, waiting for the master to awaken and give clear guidance. But this was not something to be explained in a few words or moments. Perhaps the main point could not be told to the steward. After the steward’s questioning, Dongbin only smiled blankly and said, “Old steward, do not guess wildly. I wish to consult the master on a study. Seeing him drunk and sleeping, I dared not disturb him. I planned to stand by his bed until he awoke, hoping he would see my sincerity and surely guide me. Now that you have come, that is good. Please tell the servants to set up a bed here. I wish to discuss some scholarly matters with the master. Also, if the old sir, the matron, or my wife ask about my state, please do not tell them what happened, lest they worry.” The steward was pleased with the young lord’s kindness and nodded: “I understand. You should go to the main room soon to pay respects to old sir and the matron and talk with your wife.” Dongbin agreed. The steward left happily. Meanwhile, servants cleaned the vomit and foulness, then set up a bed. All was arranged, and Dongbin ordered no one to enter unless summoned. The servants bowed repeatedly and withdrew.

Dongbin looked again at his master, but the snoring grew louder and sleep deeper. He called softly, but no response. Sighing, he said, “Master truly is a true immortal; how could one drink and fall so deeply into unconscious sleep? Surely he loves me too much and hopes for me too deeply. No doubt he sees me lately too close to wife and concubines, fearing I will be ensnared by lust and hinder my cultivation. So he feigns deep sleep to test my sincerity, then will teach me with proper words. If I slight him, he will deem me unworthy and leave me. Where else could I find such a great master?”

With this thought, he stood again with reverence and respect at the bedside. Seeing the night was late, the steward brought supper to this room. Dongbin ate alone in haste, then resumed his old practice. He looked at Zhongli Quan, who had turned inward, breathing deeply with no sign of waking. Dongbin resolved not to neglect his duty and stood with hands cupped. After some time, when Dongbin should have gone to bed, the steward, fearing he worked too hard and seeing the master’s deep sleep, felt something was amiss and entered again, urging Dongbin to sleep.

As they argued, Zhongli Quan turned over and cried out loudly: “Alas, alas, once I go down, there is no life left.” Before he finished, he had already frightened Dongbin into a cold sweat.

Why did Zhongli Quan say this startling phrase? The answer will be revealed in the next chapter.
