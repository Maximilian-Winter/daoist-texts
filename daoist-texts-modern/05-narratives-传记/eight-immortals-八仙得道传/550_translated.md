# Chapter Eighty-Two: Awakening from the Labyrinth with a Single Strike — Unleashing Grand Discourses that Overturn the True Immortal

Now it happened that Lü Dongbin, having struggled to stand upright with solemn dignity, awaited Zhongli Quan’s awakening from his deep dream. Suddenly, he heard him utter a phrase that struck like thunder: “Once I go down this path, my life is no more.” Lü Dongbin’s mind was swift and sharp; upon hearing these words, it was as if cold water had been poured down his back, a staff striking his very head. Hastily, he stepped forward and whispered, “Master, your disciple is here. I have waited long to serve you.”

Zhongli Quan rolled over, rubbed his eyes, and peered outside. “How could I have slept so long? The sky has already darkened.”

The old steward stepped forward and said, “Master has been in a deep sleep, and our young master has attended him for half a day without daring to sit even a moment. It is now the second watch. I have come specially to invite the young master to rest.” Hearing this, Lü Dongbin grew very anxious and quickly said, “Old steward, please go rest. Let me serve the master here. I can also sleep on my own; there is no need to trouble you.”

Zhongli Quan smiled faintly and said, “Today I have truly suffered a great loss at your hands, you worthy father and son. My body is too frail; in recent years, my spirit has grown ever more feeble. Look, today I have only drunk a dozen or so cups of wine, yet I am so drunk. You have labored hard for half a day—this is too unfair.” Lü Dongbin, trembling, replied, “Master, how can your disciple bear to hear such words?” He then turned and repeatedly sent the old steward away. Zhongli Quan had servants bring water and tea to attend him. He instructed, “My stomach is uneasy; I need nothing but sleep. Everyone should rest. No need to bother me.” All obeyed and withdrew.

Zhongli Quan laughed and asked Lü Dongbin, “Disciple, why do you stand here? Have you prepared a couch to spend the long night in conversation with me?” Lü Dongbin suddenly knelt to the ground and kowtowed, saying, “Master, your disciple understands your profound meaning. I know myself to be unworthy, and it is wrong to cling to wives and concubines, thus troubling your compassionate concern. My guilt is inescapable. Yet I still trust that my aspirations remain as before, my resolve unshaken. No matter how fierce the worldly desires, I will never be led astray by them. Please rest assured, Master, your disciple will not fail your high hopes or your teachings. Only you, Master, have always pitied and instructed me.”

Hearing this, Zhongli Quan could not help but sigh, “In life, it is not the inability to know that is feared, but the affliction of knowing falsely. Those who cannot know are guided by those who do, and can immediately awaken. But those who trust themselves as knowing, yet do not truly know, this is a grievous harm, and they lose all chance of awakening throughout their lives. Your root is deep, your nature excellent. Matters that others find difficult and perplexing, you can unravel in an instant—just so. Yet in some places, you cannot help but be overconfident. Self-confidence is the foremost gateway to the dao. Without self-confidence, one merely agrees and complies, accomplishing nothing—how then to speak of cultivation? But excessive self-confidence leads to extremism and arrogance, reducing learning to mere surface, sometimes to error, never corrected in a lifetime, and no one dares to correct it. Generally, the cleverest are most prone to this. You, being supremely clever, though afflicted by this illness, can still awaken and turn around, but the loss is already great. For example, the several ‘resolute’ words you just spoke are but a glimpse of your excessive self-confidence. From what I see, your fault lies in your inability to apply this ‘resolution.’ You do not resolve, yet you speak as if you are resolute, decisive, determined—so many ‘resolutes’—this is proof of your excessive self-confidence. Furthermore, you only recognize your craving for wives and concubines as your great recent illness, but you do not know that your zeal for fame and rank is the same calamity as lust. You know one but not the other. This fault also stems from excessive self-confidence, for you think, ‘I am certainly not like that.’ Thus, not a single seed of thought bends toward your own shortcomings, and your mistaken deeds remain undiscovered. Let me tell you plainly: today’s test was to see if you can awaken yourself from your errors. If you were arrogant and never reflected, even if I slept for ten days and a half-month, you would not have stood here so anxiously and earnestly for half a day. Then you would be called ‘wisdom turned to folly,’ the greatest fool under heaven. But since you have some feeling and can turn your heart inward, I see you are truly supremely clever, genuinely wise. Though your illness is deep, it is not a fundamental disease. So I recognize that your chance for repentance has come, and I must quickly correct your past faults. If you do not turn back now, alas! Time will slip away like a fleeting steed, and no one will delay ten or eight years for you. When your dream deepens and half a lifetime passes in a blink, your primordial potency will be exhausted, your merit hard to achieve. Though you have the heart to enter the dao, your body and spirit will be too late to catch up with your path.”

Lü Dongbin was drenched in cold sweat, knelt prostrate, kowtowing without cease, tears flowing as he said, “Your disciple understands, has awakened. All past deeds are as if dead yesterday; all future deeds are born today. I now turn my heart inward and see that my recent actions have already edged toward the labyrinth of delusion. I do not consider myself in danger, yet I dare boast before you, Master, and thus the danger has reached its utmost.”

Zhongli Quan heard this and ordered him to rise and stand by his side. Then he looked at him seriously and said, “You often suspect I am a heavenly golden immortal. That is true. But because the opportunity has not yet come, and many worldly ties remain unresolved, I cannot ascend to Heaven just yet. Even regarding your matter, I bear some responsibility. Do you know who you were in your previous life? Honestly, you are now the universally revered Eastern Emperor. And I am your disciple. ‘Zhongli Quan’ are my true names; I am also called ‘Yunfang.’ People call me Master Yunfang. For various reasons, you hold a grand vow, and so the Jade Emperor sent you down to the mortal world. Upon descending, the Jade Emperor entrusted you with a grave mission. Thus, your cultivation is more dignified than any other cultivator in the world. Because of your dignity, your responsibility is greater. You must concentrate your heart and will, diligently and earnestly, so as not to betray your own arduous descent nor the Jade Emperor’s commission.”

Lü Dongbin, startled, bowed deeply and said, “Your disciple fears to have been unworthy as your disciple, following you all this time, yet until today, not knowing you are truly a Great Golden Immortal of the Great Luo, coming down to the mortal world solely for me. I also did not know the karmic content of my past and present lives, nor the great responsibility I bear. The arrogant words I have spoken before you now seem so rash. Truly reaching that state would be the only way to fulfill the words ‘dutiful and devoted,’ and not waste my descent. Master, your disciple now has genuine resolve, and wishes to immediately leave family and abandon official post, to regain freedom and leisure among mountains and waters, to refine my muscles and bones, to extend my learning. After several years, perhaps some achievement will be made. Then I will seek your instruction in the great dao and the Golden Elixir. If I can become an immortal early, I can save the world a day sooner. Yet I still have attachments I cannot sever; I hope Master will explain for me.”

Zhongli Quan saw his sudden clarity and could not help but nod and praise, “You are indeed a person of profound root and vessel, surpassing other clever men by a notch. What you now worry about is your parents, not able to abandon them immediately. You want to explain before leaving, but fear not being permitted, thus fearing failure. Is this so?” Lü Dongbin said, “Master’s wisdom sees into my heart. My mind now is very different from this afternoon. Before, I still had thoughts of fame, profit, wives, concubines, and children. Now, except for my aged parents, I have no other concerns. It is not that I treat wives and children as strangers, but their youth means sorrow and worry will not harm their bodies or minds. Only my two elders, whose health has long been poor and spirits declining. If they knew their beloved son abandoned home and left, this grief and bitterness could cause grave illness. What then can be done?”

Zhongli Quan laughed, “Did you not say before that to transform the world, one must begin with parents and wife? How is it now that you first think of abandoning your parents? I have long told you, the immortal dao is nothing but human feeling. To become immortal yet not honor one’s parents or love one’s wife is to become the most cruel person under heaven. How can this be called humaneness?” Lü Dongbin, alarmed and anxious, said, “Master’s teachings, which words have not been in my heart? But today’s matter is hard to reconcile. My dao practice is nil; how can I persuade others? Is this not to kill me?”

Zhongli Quan laughed heartily, “Since you feel you lack this ability, do you not know how to seek help from others?” Lü Dongbin immediately knelt long and kowtowed, saying, “I am resolved to leave the home, never to look back. Since Master says so, I respectfully entrust this matter to you.” Zhongli Quan smiled, “Enough, enough. Those who speak of right and wrong are themselves right and wrong. Since I have said this, I cannot take it back, so I will help you once more. Our worldly friendship ends here. From now on, when we meet, we shall be master and disciple beyond the world, no longer as before.”

Lü Dongbin, seeing this, was greatly pleased. He kowtowed and rose, asking, “I have decided to set out at dawn tomorrow. Master, which path do you think I should take?” Zhongli Quan pondered silently for a moment, then said, “Since you hold a great vow and have such root, beyond Heaven and Earth, within the world, wherever gods, immortals, or Buddhas dwell, you may go. But first, you must journey to Mount Lu. There is a certain immortal there, waiting in the Jade Chamber Cavern to teach you the Heavenly Escape Sword technique. With this sword method, beyond the five escapes, you gain a sword escape—hence the name Heavenly Escape. Possessing this sword is better than a hundred sharp weapons. As for the lessons you should practice in the next three years, I have fully taught you over the past five years. You need only master these methods one by one. After half a year, you can fast without grain; after two years, you can ride clouds and summon spirits and generals; after three years, you will roughly know the methods of transformation and understand the principles of the Five Phases’ birth and conquest. Ordinary cultivators take a hundred years to achieve what your nature can attain in three. When the three years are up, you may wait for me on the banks of the Xiang River. I will help you cross over a fated thing. Then I will teach you even more refined and profound knowledge.”

Having said this, he took out a Daoist robe and personally draped it over Lü Dongbin’s shoulders, instructing, “Do not underestimate this robe. It is called the Primordial Eight Trigrams Robe. Water and fire cannot approach it; blades and weapons cannot harm it. When cold, it warms; when hot, it summons wind. Always wear it; no need for other clothes. Immortals make their homes everywhere—desolate mountains, ancient temples, riverbanks—all are Heaven’s bestowed dwellings. With this robe, ordinary demons and monsters will sense your aura and fear, no longer daring to trouble you. For those who leave home, endurance is paramount. I have planned this for you, yet it seems I do not wish you hardship. This is because you have your own root, unlike others who cultivate from nothing. If you do not believe me, you can test it immediately upon setting out. Not to mention other hardships, just walking, enduring hunger, dispelling sleep demons, braving wind and frost—these are all hardships you have never practiced. Yet none will truly trouble you, all because your past life’s merit and dao arts are deeper and greater than any immortal or god. This life you inherit that legacy, unlike others who merely refine muscles and bones, or lighten the body, you need not do much more. Disciple, these are your greatest advantages, ones others can never catch up to. With so many benefits, if you stray or dawdle, would it not be a great pity and sorrow?” Lü Dongbin bowed his head, saying, “Your disciple understands. Please rest assured, Master.”

Zhongli Quan added, “There is one small treasure you may keep for yourself or use to save others. It is the method to turn stone into silver and iron into gold.” Lü Dongbin asked, “Master, can this gold and silver remain forever unchanged?” Zhongli Quan answered, “It can last about five hundred years. After five hundred years, it returns to its original form. This is also a principle of Heaven and Earth’s cycles. How could it remain forever unchanged? If it never changed back, then today it could not be turned into gold or silver.”

Lü Dongbin frowned uneasily, “If so, your disciple does not wish to use this method, so as not to harm those who receive this gold and silver five hundred years later.” Zhongli Quan nodded in admiration, “Rare indeed, rare indeed. I had never thought of this. This is but a simple, clear principle. Yet those who learn the method study only the method itself. When the method is mastered, and they intend to help the poor, that is already a great good deed and a fine heart. Who thinks of those five hundred years hence, who will suffer when the metal reverts to iron or stone? Not only I, but many immortals can do this, yet none have considered this. Who would have thought you, a novice, would awaken us with a single phrase, correcting many immortals who only care for the present and not the future? This one phrase is worth five hundred years of merit. Rare indeed, admirable indeed, worthy of respect.”

Patting his shoulder, he smiled joyfully, “Good lad, you have such kind wisdom and insight; your future is immeasurable. A thousand years hence, you will surely be a leader among immortals. Strive, strive, and do not waste your fine nature and talent!” Lü Dongbin, feeling praised, was somewhat uneasy, “Master’s praise is too great for your disciple. I only seek early true enlightenment, to follow your staff and help transform the world. That wish is enough. As for my own future, how dare I entertain wild thoughts?”

Zhongli Quan nodded, “Gods, Buddhas, immortals, fame, rank, and fortune all have their fixed measure. What Heaven ordains, man cannot change; what Heaven rejects, man cannot escape. You will soon encounter a trivial matter on your journey. Since you cannot ignore it, you will be involved in a minor dispute. Even this small matter contains karmic principle. Fortunately, you will be protected in your future and need not worry.”

The master and disciple spoke until dawn. Lü Dongbin dared not linger; he bade farewell and prepared to depart. Zhongli Quan said, “Now there are many gates and doors—how will you get out? Come, come, let me escort you.” Taking Lü Dongbin’s arm, they stepped outside the room into a small courtyard. Looking up, faint starlight and moonlight peeked shyly from drifting clouds, as if afraid to show their faces. The morning wind stirred the phoenix trees, their branches and leaves rustling mournfully. Birds on the branches, just waking from weary dreams, chirped and chattered among themselves, as if saying, “The dawn has come; everyone wake and go about their proper tasks; do not linger lost in the dark night.” On the ground, the master and disciple stood hand in hand, sighing softly.

Lü Dongbin spoke bitterly, “Men die for wealth, birds perish for food. Born of Heaven and Earth, why are people each drowned in the sea of worldly desires? See how they rise at dawn and sleep at dusk, busy for fame and profit, convinced this is the proper way of life. But to an outsider, how is this different from birds on branches scurrying for food? When the final hour comes, life gone in an instant, can the fame and fortune gained by cunning and strength be carried even a shred into the underworld? Like these birds, passing spring and summer, then autumn and winter, busy and dull without rest, suddenly old and dead in their nests, or harmed by mischievous children or hunters. What then of all their labor and its fruits? Since I began the dao, I have no peace. Facing such people who only care for the present and never reflect, I cannot help but quietly worry for them. Master, might I one day help save some of them?”

Zhongli Quan smiled, “The ancients said, ‘If one man is not saved, how can I bear this fault?’ How great a heart is this! The Buddha said, ‘If I do not enter hell, who will?’ How compassionate is this! Shun was a man, and so am I. What others can do but say I am inferior is the act of cowards and fools; men of will disdain this. Disciple, you have this good heart; do not ask if you can or cannot in the future. Only care how diligently you act now. Heaven’s dao is most just, Heaven’s heart most kind. When a person has good thoughts, Heaven must follow. Go now, disciple, pursue your path with all your strength. As for the future, we will speak then. Worrying and fretting only brings suffering and is no help to your dao heart. Farewell, Lü Dongbin; take good care. Do not forget our appointment three years hence on the banks of the Xiang River.”

Having spoken, he waved his hand toward the sky, and a faint, hoarse cry arose from the horizon. Lü Dongbin was startled and looked around. A white crane descended from the sky, circling the trees thrice, startling the small birds into a startled cry as they scattered in flight. Zhongli Quan shouted, “Wretched beast! How dare you bully the weak and neglect your duties? Come quickly to escort your senior brother out!” Hearing this, the crane rolled and landed, transforming into a boy with bright eyes, clear brows, rosy lips, and white teeth—truly a lovable sight. He bowed to Zhongli Quan and asked, “Master, which senior brother is this?” Zhongli Quan pointed to Lü Dongbin and said, “This is Senior Brother Lü. He is going to the region of Nanchang. You may escort him to the northern bank of the river, then let him go on his own.”

Lü Dongbin raised his hand in salute to the boy, who returned the gesture. At this moment, Lü Dongbin felt a pang of reluctance, clutching his master’s hand with a sobbing sound. Suddenly, Zhongli Quan shouted, “You say you cultivate the dao, yet your dust-laden heart is too heavy! Hurry on your way!” As he spoke, he slapped Lü Dongbin’s forehead. Lü Dongbin was greatly startled, quickly opening his eyes. Ah! Truly the wondrous power of the immortals, mysterious and unfathomable! He found himself already soaring beyond the Nine Heavens, not knowing how he mounted the boy’s shoulders. The boy had again transformed into a white crane, carrying him through the air. This frightened Lü Dongbin into silence.

What adventures await Lü Dongbin on this journey? We shall see in the next chapter.
