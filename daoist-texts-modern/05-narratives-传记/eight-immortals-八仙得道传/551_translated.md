# Chapter Eighty-Three: The Dog’s Haunting on Peach Blossom Mountain — The Dog of Xiakou Bites Lü Dongbin

Now, it happened that Lü Dongbin was suddenly startled by a fierce shout from Zhongli Quan. Startled, he blinked his eyes open to find himself astride the back of a white crane, soaring high into the sky, circling and wheeling with great speed. His heart trembled with awe and surprise. Seizing the moment as the crane flew, he gently tapped its long neck and said, “Senior Brother, please slow down a bit; I have some questions to ask.” The Crane Boy slightly spread his wings, stretched his neck, lifted his head, and spoke in human words: “Master instructed me to escort you to the northern bank of the river. Once there, someone will come to receive you and escort you to Mount Lu. Do you have any doubts, Senior Brother?”

Lü Dongbin replied, “That is not what I mean. Just now I was speaking with Master, yet in the blink of an eye, I find myself on your back, flying halfway to the heavens. How can this be? What kind of dao is this?” The Crane Boy laughed, “This is Master’s immortal technique. You do not know it, but how could I?” Lü Dongbin asked again, “Where is Master now? Do you know?” The Crane Boy smiled, “Is he not still in your home? These matters I do not know at all. I only know Master summoned me specifically to escort you out. If there were other matters, since he did not speak, how could I ask?”

Lü Dongbin realized the Crane Boy’s knowledge was limited, much like his own. His earlier questions had sprung from surprise and a restless heart, mere idle words. Since the Crane Boy could not answer, he let the matter drop. The Crane Boy said no more, spread his wings, and with a powerful beat, flew swiftly. In less than half a day’s time, they had flown from the river to the northern bank. Just east of the river stood the city of Nanchang. The white crane gently set down Lü Dongbin, bidding him farewell with a promise to meet again, then spread its wings and flew away. Lü Dongbin hurriedly pressed his hands to his forehead in thanks.

Collecting his thoughts, Lü Dongbin pondered: Master had sent me to Mount Lu, and according to the Crane Boy, someone would meet me to ferry me across the river. Who might this person be? After some thought, he decided not to concern himself. This place, backed by mountains and beside the river, was serene and clean. Since he had arrived, a little leisure would do no harm. Just as he was about to step forward, he caught sight of a steward rushing toward him, his face and head drenched in sweat. Approaching Lü Dongbin, he accidentally brushed against the Daoist’s robe. Lü Dongbin, unprepared, stumbled back a few steps, then smiled and said, “Brother, you walk too recklessly. On such a broad road, even with eyes open, you can bump into others. Isn’t that amusing?”

The man was very polite and, hearing this, quickly smiled, clasped his fists, and apologized repeatedly. “I am in urgent matters and must hasten thirty li away to invite a venerable Daoist to our master’s home to subdue a demon. Seeing the sky darken and the demon causing havoc at home, I feared it might jeopardize our master’s affairs, so I rushed madly. Yet, in my haste, I lost my wits. Though I saw the Daoist ahead, I do not know how I came to bump into you. I am truly sorry.” Lü Dongbin laughed, “No harm done. But you say demon? That is a strange claim. Under the broad daylight, in the clear heavens, what bold demon dares appear openly? Brother, please tell me more.”

The man said, “It is no trouble to talk, but alas, the sky grows late and I must hurry.” Lü Dongbin smiled, “I have nothing pressing. Why not walk with me a while?” Hearing this, the man sized him up and asked, “You speak as if not from here. Could you be an immortal from afar?” Lü Dongbin smiled, “Far indeed, but not immortal. I am from the river region, surname Lü, given name Yan, styled Dongbin. I have come to Mount Lu to learn the dao of immortality, but I am not yet an immortal.”

The man laughed, “If so, Daoist, you have some learning, quite unlike common adepts. I wonder if you have the skill to help my master rid his home of this demon. Our place is the famed town of Xiakou, a hub of roads and trade. Our master is a well-known benefactor with vast wealth. His surname is Wang, and all call him Master Wang. He has a daughter, sixteen years old, both talented and beautiful, filial to her parents and kind to us servants. Yet this March, when she went with her mother, Lady Wang Anren, to offer incense on Peach Blossom Mountain, somehow the demon spotted her, tracked her down, and attached itself to her. It babbles nonsense, claiming the young lady is betrothed to him by fate. He says he is an immortal, and if Master Wang agrees to marry her to him, he will elevate the whole family to Heaven. Master Wang refuses. He has invited many Daoists to perform rites to expel the demon, but alas, they are all charlatans who only drink and eat, unable to subdue the demon. This time, each was soundly defeated, beaten until noses were flattened and faces bruised, fleeing with tails between their legs, not daring to collect their fees. Since Master Wang broke with the demon, the creature has become even more unruly, causing strange and frightening disturbances daily.”

Lü Dongbin smiled, “Oh? Many strange things, you say?” The man stuck out his tongue and said, “This demon’s methods are fierce indeed. It can conjure wildfires from thin air, setting houses and possessions ablaze, flames leaping high, frightening people and animals into flight. But in the blink of an eye, the fire vanishes; the houses remain intact, not a leaf or blade of grass harmed. Sometimes, when the family gathers peacefully, suddenly there is a loud crash, and a wall collapses before their eyes. When they rush to avoid it, the wall is restored as if nothing happened, not a speck of dust or stone missing. More cruelly, it can cloud the eyes of the household, causing the steward to mistake his wife for the old lady, the son to confuse his mother for his wife. Though the truth is soon seen, much laughter and confusion have already ensued. Daoist, imagine such a demon’s mischief! Though it cannot truly harm, it unsettles the entire household, making them unable to carry on any proper affairs, their hearts uneasy, always guarding against its tricks. Such a burden is more than enough to endure.”

Lü Dongbin asked, “And the young lady? Has she been defiled by the demon?” The man said, “That is the strange part. The demon presses her daily to marry, yet seems afraid of her. It only sits in her room. Several times it has tried to approach her bed but never dared to be bold. If such a demon still respected reason, no one would believe it. Neither reasonable nor daring, what secret lies here?” Lü Dongbin inquired, “Have you all seen the demon’s form?” The man said, “None but the young lady. She has been with it day and night. It is said to be a fierce beast, covered in hair with a tail, terrifying to behold. The young lady is like a golden branch and jade leaf, rarely leaving her chamber. Now, beside her embroidered couch, sits this dreadful demon. Poor girl suffers terribly.”

Hearing this, Lü Dongbin’s anger flared. “Enough! I will accompany you to summon that venerable Daoist and see if he can subdue the demon. If not, once I understand what this demon truly is, I will find a way to capture it. If my skills fall short, I will return to ask my Master to come and rid your household of this harm. How does that sound?” The man rejoiced, “If so, our master will be most grateful.”

Lü Dongbin said nothing further and followed him to an ancient temple called the Baoguo Chan Monastery. The man entered and requested to see the guest monk, Master Zhiyuan, with Lü Dongbin following close. Zhiyuan was a short, plump monk with a round face and large ears. The man presented a letter from his master. Zhiyuan read it but did not immediately say whether he would go. Instead, he asked Lü Dongbin who he was. The man answered for him: “He is Daoist Lü, whom I met on the road, coming to visit our master.” Zhiyuan smiled and asked Lü Dongbin, “Are you the Lü Yan from the river region?” Lü Dongbin was startled and asked, “How does Master know my name?” Zhiyuan said nothing but smiled slyly. Lü Dongbin watched him carefully and saw that smile held a cunning air. He thought, “I am bound for Mount Lu; I do not want to meddle in troubles, lest I meet a villain. First, danger; second, delay. Better to find a way to slip away and cross the river myself, no matter if someone meets me or not.”

Having resolved this, he saw Zhiyuan negotiating with the man over the reward for subduing the demon. The man agreed to pay two thousand taels of silver, but Zhiyuan still hesitated. He ordered the temple workers to quickly summon the senior master, saying, “Lü Yan from the river has arrived.” Lü Dongbin grew more alarmed, fearing this monk bore some grudge against him and had come to seek revenge. At this point, he could only wait and see. To show no fear, lest he lose face and accomplish nothing, he smiled and said, “Strange indeed: if Master knows my name, who is this senior master, and how does he know me?” Zhiyuan laughed, “Do not overthink. Our senior master’s dao is profound; he knows past and future, can call rain and summon clouds, and change heaven and earth. He is kind and loves talent. Soon you will meet him and see he is a good man of Amitābha.”

Lü Dongbin had no choice but to wait. Meanwhile, Zhiyuan and the man agreed that after the demon was subdued, the two thousand taels would be paid. Lü Dongbin, born of a noble family and generous by nature, had always helped others without thought of reward. He found it strange that matters of demon subjugation could be bargained over like mundane trade. He also suspected the monks of this temple were a stingy lot, yet somehow possessed such skills. Lost in thought, he suddenly heard footsteps in the back courtyard. Zhiyuan smiled, “The senior master has arrived. Brother Lü, come with me to greet him.”

Lü Dongbin rose and followed Zhiyuan to the rear, where they saw an elderly monk with pure white beard and flowing whiskers, radiant and extraordinary in bearing, stepping in with measured grace. Zhiyuan hurried to greet him and whispered something. The old master’s face lit with joy as he asked, “Where is this man?” Lü Dongbin, hearing his voice like a great bell, was filled with wonder and quickly followed, bowing respectfully: “Disciple Lü Yan of the Daoist school pays respects.” The old master took his arm, laughing heartily: “Good, good! We have awaited you long. Come with me; I have much to say.” Lü Dongbin saw the old monk’s face was noble and sincere, unlike Zhiyuan’s sly demeanor, and thought, “This truly is a good master. I should not have doubted him.” He followed respectfully to the meditation hall and bowed again.

The old master said, “No need for ceremony. I was born Zhang in the secular world, ordained two hundred years ago with the dharma name Tongming. This year I am two hundred and forty-five years old. Recently, in meditation, I knew you would arrive today and instructed my disciples to await you. Your root and capacity are profound; whether cultivating immortality or studying Buddhism, you will find it easy. I wish to persuade you to enter the Buddhist path. I will accept you as disciple and teach you all my lifetime’s dao. Soon I shall pass into nirvana; you may then reside here as abbot, leading the monks. Your future blessings will be great! What say you?”

Lü Dongbin was taken aback. Luckily quick-witted, he replied with thanks: “Master’s generous offer moves me deeply. Yet before leaving home, I was already guided by an immortal teacher. This journey is by Master’s command, to study swordsmanship at Mount Lu. I have entered the dao school and cannot change paths. Fortunately, the three teachings share the same source, all aiming to transform the world, remove evil, and promote good. Though I follow the Dao, I am no different from one who takes refuge in Buddha. Your Buddhist path is vast, and Master, your virtue and years are extraordinary. Surely you will not hold my refusal against me or think me ungrateful.”

The old master was silent for a long moment, then sighed: “A person without fate, forcing fate is truly against the natural order. I was wrong, I was wrong.” Saying this, he closed his eyes and sat in meditation, not speaking a word. After a while, Zhiyuan came in and stood by him. Finally, he opened his eyes and said, “Go to Master Wang’s house, but be cautious. That demon is Erlang Shen’s Howling Celestial Dog. Now, with its master away on business, it is left unrestrained and dares to roam the mortal world boldly. It is not easy to deal with. The treasure I gave you last time can repel this dog, but do not harm its life. It has earned merit serving Erlang Shen. Its minor mischief does not deserve death. Moreover, Master Wang’s daughter is a reincarnated tigress. Though once a fierce beast, she had a kind heart and never harmed humans. In this life, she became human, and because she treats her underlings kindly, the spirits attached to her remain loyal and protective. Thus, the dog cannot approach her. Since it has not defiled her, its guilt is lessened. If you kill it, not only will Erlang Shen be offended, but you will also incur karmic retribution and future grudges. Is it worth it?” Zhiyuan answered, “Understood.”

The old master then said to Zhiyuan, “Since Lü Yan has resolved not to enter our teaching, you may take him to the Wang household and help resolve this karmic case.” Zhiyuan looked at Lü Dongbin. Lü Dongbin, hearing this, had more questions but the old master had already closed his eyes in meditation again. So he bowed and left with Zhiyuan. Zhiyuan produced two pairs of armor and horseshoes, binding one set to Lü Dongbin’s feet and the other to his own. With a hand-drawn talisman, he said it was the method of divine travel, allowing three thousand li of travel each day. Lü Dongbin was pleased and they left the mountain gate. He told the steward, “No need to hurry home; we will go first.” Saying so, he beckoned Lü Dongbin to follow.

Indeed, their movement was swift and effortless. In an instant, they arrived at a bustling market. The sky was not yet fully dark. Zhiyuan pointed ahead to a large mansion, saying it was Master Wang’s home. They went straight to the gate and explained their purpose to the gatekeeper. The gatekeeper hurried to inform the household. Soon Master Wang, his wife, sons, and elderly mother—six or seven people—came out to greet them and invited them inside. After the usual formalities, Zhiyuan asked about the demon’s mischief. Master Wang’s account matched what the steward had told Lü Dongbin. When asked if Zhiyuan knew what kind of demon it was, and why it had not yet shed its fur or claws, and why it seemed afraid of the young lady, Zhiyuan repeated the old master’s instructions.

He added, “Though the dog has not yet learned of our presence, dogs are clever. If it finds out, it will flee. If it returns after we leave, it will cause more trouble. Since we are new here and it does not know us, it is best to subdue it now. Master Wang, please lead us to the young lady’s chamber so we may perform the rite.” Master Wang was delighted and personally held a bright lantern, leading the monk and Daoist, with his wife, winding through corridors to the young lady’s fragrant chamber upstairs.

At the door, Zhiyuan produced a cloth painting and instructed Lü Dongbin to guard the door, hanging the painting on the curtain. When the dog entered the painting, they would quickly roll it up, turning the dog’s bones to ash. Lü Dongbin hurriedly said, “Did not the senior master instruct us to spare its life?” Zhiyuan spat and laughed, “That old fellow is troublesome. If we come to exorcise, we must be thorough. What use is sparing its life? If we spare it, better to not bother at all. Such fake compassion is like a cat crying over a mouse. I hate such things most of all.”

Lü Dongbin said nothing, took the painting, and guarded the door. When Zhiyuan entered the chamber, Lü Dongbin hung the painting. Zhiyuan, with Master Wang and his wife, entered the room. The young lady lay asleep on her bed, curtains hanging all around, silent as a breath. Only the snoring of a dog was heard. Opening his eyes, Lü Dongbin saw a fierce and dreadful dog curled beneath the bed, sound asleep. Zhiyuan smiled, “This beast knows how to enjoy itself.” He ordered Master Wang and his wife to step back and drew his sword to perform the rite. The couple saw many divine generals and celestial soldiers appear before them. Zhiyuan explained the situation, and the generals raised their weapons and struck at the dog beneath the bed.

The dog, clad in blades, howled fiercely and leapt out, biting wildly in all directions. The weapons could not harm it; instead, several celestial soldiers were bitten and wounded. Zhiyuan, furious, wielded his sword personally. The dog fought back with sharp claws. Zhiyuan’s sword flashed like silver light, visible but the sword’s form unseen. The dog, experienced in great formations, was calm and fought with all its strength, sometimes pouncing with all four hooves, sometimes opening its jaws to swallow. After a long battle, neither sword nor dog could wound the other. Yet the generals’ strength was great, and the dog, alone, could not prevail.

Exhausted, the dog retreated toward the door, seeking escape. Looking up, it saw a vast garden outside, with mountains and waters, trees and flowers, and many small animals it liked—pigs, sheep, chickens, geese—all roaming freely, peaceful and comfortable. The dog, seeing such a paradise, and being hungry and tired, could not resist stepping in. But the dog’s knowledge was far less than a human’s; it did not know this garden was an illusion designed to trap it. It stepped inside.

Outside, Lü Dongbin watched the dog enter the painting, then suddenly disappear. Hastily, he rolled up the painting. Halfway through, he recalled the old master’s words. The dog belonged to Erlang Shen, who was acquainted with his own Master. If he harmed the Howling Celestial Dog, how could his Master face Erlang Shen? Better to release it. Thinking so, he unrolled the painting. Halfway through, suddenly a fierce dog leapt out unexpectedly, snapping at Lü Dongbin’s groin. Lü Dongbin cried out and fell backward.

This is the well-known tale passed down among the common folk: “The dog bites Lü Dongbin, not recognizing a good heart.”

Whether Lü Dongbin survived this attack remains to be told in the next chapter.
