# Chapter Eighty-Four: Entrusted by a Friend, Chang’e Sends the Azure Bird; Under Imperial Decree, the Star Lord Oversees the Moon

Now it is told that when Lü Dongbin first took up the monastic path, he was granted by Zhongli Quan a robe of the Primordial Eight Trigrams Dao. Draped upon his body, this robe was originally impervious to water and fire, fearless before blades and flames. Yet, by chance, the very first adversary he encountered was none other than Erlang Shen’s Howling Heavenly Dog.

This dog was no ordinary beast. Since ancient times, it had diligently cultivated and refined itself. Though it had not yet attained the immortal dao, it had become a body impervious to ten thousand kalpas. Its teeth, tempered through countless trials and forges, had stood by its master’s side in many a feat, biting to death many demons and ghosts. Naturally, the power of its bite was more than tenfold that of ordinary weapons or fire. Moreover, Lü Dongbin’s heart was wholly set on kindness, only intent on saving the creature’s life. How could he have guarded against the dog’s sudden leap from its painted circle? At that moment, his head spun and his mind reeled, his heart filled with hatred for his enemy.

The dog, however, could not fathom that Lü Dongbin had unfurled the painting to save its life. It only saw a faction of enemies and could not imagine a savior emerging from their midst. Thus, seizing the momentum of the painting’s unfolding, it neither questioned how the painting opened nor cared who held it. Driven by vengeance and the instinct to escape death, it had no choice but to bite fiercely.

As previously mentioned, Lü Dongbin’s dao robe could only resist ordinary water, fire, and blades, but not the Howling Heavenly Dog’s teeth. Unwittingly, the dog’s sudden bite struck his lower leg. Unable to endure the pain, he cried out loudly and collapsed to the ground in a swoon. This is the very scene behind the common saying: “The dog bites Lü Dongbin, not recognizing a kind heart.”

This tale has been passed down for a thousand years, yet no one knows its true origin. Some keen-minded and highly thoughtful gentlemen have criticized it as baseless nonsense. They argue that Lü Dongbin is a golden immortal of Heaven, the most ambitious among immortals, ever willing to save those in suffering. How could such a dog be so ungrateful as to bite him? Even if there were unreasonable wild dogs, Lü Dongbin would not fear their bite. Thus, they regard this story as a later fabrication, utterly without truth.

Such reasoning is not without merit. Yet, alas, these gentlemen only debate reason and fail to investigate the origins of the story, ending up with nothing but confusion. This cannot truly be blamed on them.

Putting aside such idle talk, we return to Lü Dongbin’s dao robe. It could not withstand the Howling Heavenly Dog’s teeth, so once bitten, he fainted. The reason was that at this time he was still a flesh-and-blood being, unable to endure the pain that even demons could not bear. Yet, given the dog’s ferocity, many demons had perished beneath its teeth, but Lü Dongbin was merely wounded and fell, still preserving his life. This must be credited to the protective power of the dao robe.

At once, the Howling Heavenly Dog broke free from the painting and fled. Soon after, the monk Zhiyuan and the couple Wang Yuanwai and his wife came to rescue Lü Dongbin. Zhiyuan scolded him harshly: “You have lost your wits! We barely managed to trap this vicious dog, rolling it into the painting to ensure it would trouble no one again. But you let it go, and now its hatred grows deeper. If it returns tomorrow to stir trouble, I won’t have the time to guard against it. This disaster you have brought upon us, you must now resolve. As for your injury, it is your own doing; no one else is to blame.” With that, he stormed off in anger.

Lü Dongbin felt both pain and regret, stung further by this rebuke, left speechless. Wang Yuanwai and his wife sighed deeply, fearing the dog would return and that their entire family’s lives might be lost in its jaws. Hearing this was even harder for Lü Dongbin than the dog’s bite.

He put on a bold face and said to Wang Yuanwai, “Please rest assured. Since I was the one who released this dog, I vow to devise a plan to drive it away so it will never dare return. Until this matter is resolved, I swear to remain in your household and fight it to the death.”

Zhiyuan would not wait for him to finish and sneered, “Very well. Had I known you had such skill, Wang Yuanwai need not have traveled so far to invite me. Now it is fortunate to have this great immortal protecting your home. Surely no demon or ghost will dare trouble you. And a mere dog? I, a humble monk, have limited power and cannot keep battling beasts endlessly. Forgive me, but I must take my leave.” With that, he hurried out.

Wang Yuanwai stopped him repeatedly, saying, “Master, you have come a long way and worked hard. The day is late, the third watch is near. Tonight, no matter what, you must stay. We will see you off early tomorrow.” Zhiyuan consented and spent the night.

The next morning, just as Zhiyuan was about to depart, another monk arrived—Zhijue, from the same temple. Zhiyuan stopped and asked his purpose. Zhijue pulled him back with a smile: “Master, I knew yesterday you could not subdue the demon or capture the monster.” Before he finished, Zhiyuan jumped up: “What nonsense! I have traveled far and wide, capturing countless demons and spirits. How could I fail against a mere dog? You should ask him yourself. Who knows what skills that wild daoist has? Yet our master trusts him so much he wants to take him as a disciple of the Chan school. Hmph! Such a man only fools people for food and clothing. If he truly entered the Chan school, ha! Our monks’ dignity would be lost.”

Zhijue saw his anger and, noting Lü Dongbin sitting composed without shame or argument, nodded and smiled: “Brother Zhiyuan, no need to be impatient. Our master never said your skills were lacking or that you could not capture demons. He said certain fates are predetermined. This dog was not meant to die by your hand. Moreover, it must not be killed by anyone. Why then did he send you here? Why did you ignore this and seek to kill it? What reason is there in this?” Zhiyuan was left speechless and stunned. Zhijue smiled: “Our master acts without error. He foresaw your fiery temper and that you held the magic treasure, giving you power over life and death. Yet you would not easily spare it. As for this Daoist Lü, you may not know his background, and he has no great magic yet, so he is no match for this dog. That is why you were sent first.”

Hearing this, Zhiyuan’s face brightened and softened, smiling: “If the master has such great plans, I cannot oppose them.” Zhijue continued: “There is more. Knowing your nature and your power, the master sent Lü Daoist along as a backup to subdue the dog.” Zhiyuan chuckled and muttered, “Backup, backup—only to have the dog bite Lü Dongbin.” Everyone laughed. Zhijue said, “Don’t say that. All things are foreseen by the master. Lü must save the dog, and the dog must bite Lü—this was foreseen. If you don’t believe, come and see what I hold.” They all looked at a small white pill in his hand. “Lü Daoist, this is the healing medicine prepared by the master for your wound. The master said if that bite had struck anyone else, their life would be over. Fortunately, it was you, and with the robe’s protection, only your leg was injured. Though painful, the robe was not torn.” Everyone marveled, for the robe covered the lower leg, and the dog’s teeth clearly pierced through the robe to bite the flesh beneath. The flesh was injured, but the robe remained intact—a true treasure of Heaven and Earth. Zhiyuan praised it heartily.

Lü Dongbin thanked the old monk and also Zhijue, who dissolved the pill and applied it to the wound. In moments, the flesh was as new, and the pain vanished. Zhijue smiled: “Lü Daoist, fate is fixed. You are to drive away this dog; no one else can interfere. Our master knew Brother Zhiyuan would not easily spare it, so he explained before you that the dog must not die. Since you heard the dog belongs to Erlang Shen, your senior in the dao, and you wished to save it, you dared to do so at the master’s word. You once mistakenly killed a dog in childhood and vowed to save all beings, unwilling to let any innocent suffer injustice. Now, through the Howling Heavenly Dog’s bite, you have released the grievance of that wronged dog. This is what the master meant by helping you resolve a karmic burden.”

Lü Dongbin reflected and recalled that at age three, he and some brothers played in the fields, tossing stones. Being small, he threw a stone that struck a sleeping dog’s eye, blinding it halfway. The dog writhed and fell into a nearby river, drowning. They tried to save it, but the children were too young and powerless. Though young, Lü Dongbin felt guilt in his conscience and sometimes remembered this with sorrow. The old monk’s reminder brought sudden clarity.

Zhijue added: “The master said that when you reach the City God’s Mountain in Hangzhou, a mangy little dog you save and elevate to Heaven will be that very wronged dog. Keep this in your heart.” Lü Dongbin bowed in thanks to the old monk’s thorough care. He also recalled Zhongli Quan’s warning about verbal disputes before taking monastic vows, which he had thought meant mere quarrels or negotiations. Little did he know it concerned the dog’s bite.

Hearing this tale of cause and effect, all sighed and resolved not to harm others. Zhijue finished and smiled at Zhiyuan: “The master commands me to invite you back to the temple; no need to linger here. Lü Daoist alone can settle this matter.” Zhiyuan said: “Didn’t we just say Lü Daoist lacks merit and cannot resist this beast?” Zhijue smiled: “Good men have Heaven’s favor. Why worry? Go, go, no more fuss.”

Zhiyuan seemed reluctant to leave, stammering: “If Lü Daoist alone suffices, why trouble us with this trivial matter?” Zhijue spat: “You are a high monk with dao in the Buddhist school, yet you cannot grasp such simple truth. I have spoken till my tongue is sore, and you still quibble. Besides, Lü Daoist may handle this alone, but Wang Yuanwai invited a master from our temple. As monks, we must follow fate. Having accepted the invitation, how can we shirk responsibility? In short, it is all predestined. Enough talk; you should leave now.”

Zhijue took Zhiyuan’s arm and said, “Come.” Zhiyuan had no choice but to follow. Wang Yuanwai and Lü Dongbin escorted them to the door. Zhiyuan told Zhijue, “One more thing: I must visit the Western Market. You go back first; I will follow. If the old master asks, say I have returned. Thank you for your hard work. Rest a moment ahead, then come.”

Zhijue refused: “The master wants you back immediately for good reason. How can we deceive him? I dare not lie for you.” Zhiyuan laughed: “You lack brotherly spirit, making a fuss over small things. Very well, I will return with you. Once I see the old master, I can come out again.” Zhijue nodded to all and left.

Wang Yuanwai and Lü Dongbin returned inside. Lü Dongbin apologized, saying, “Please rest assured, Yuanwai. Though I have little dao skill, if matters become dire, I will call on my master for help. My master is Zhongli Quan, the Great Golden Immortal, also called Master Yunfang. He has powers that penetrate Heaven and Earth, overturn rivers and seas. He is an old friend of Erlang Shen, the dog’s master. He already knows I am handling this matter here. If I cannot manage it, he will know. When he comes, whether by civil or martial means, all will be settled. What is there to fear?”

Wang Yuanwai bowed and said, “With the immortal’s protection, how could I not trust? But when will this demon return? Each day it delays, we cannot sleep soundly. Since the immortal master has such dao, it would be best to send him to Heaven to tell Erlang Shen to take back the dog. Then all will be well. Our family can live boldly and carry on, sparing the immortal master from delay and wasting your time seeking the dao.”

Lü Dongbin hesitated deeply. Though he had studied under his master for many years and knew many arts, he had spent much time in worldly affairs and never truly practiced. Living in peace, he had no chance to test his dao skills and did not know if they were effective. Setting aside all else, simply to return and seek his master’s word meant a journey of at least ten days or half a month on foot. Moreover, once home, he could not leave freely, which would harm himself. Thinking of this, his heart grew heavy.

At Wang Yuanwai’s repeated entreaties, he told him his troubles.

He said, “My master truly is a golden immortal of Heaven. He sent a white crane to carry me here. He foresees all trivial matters and sufferings I endure. Would he be unaware of what comes next? Since he did not tell me to return for instructions, it shows he has foreseen that a great one will assist. Please rest assured. We cultivators never boast or lie. If you do not believe me, see how I, a free and easy man, willingly endure hardship, waiting in your household for that demon.”

Yuanwai was half convinced but accepted this attitude, thanking him with his wife and preparing a fine chamber for Lü Dongbin. Lü Dongbin stayed three days with no news, growing anxious. At night, when all was quiet, he stepped out, strolling beneath the moon, hands behind his back, pondering how to resolve this matter. Finding no solution, he sighed deeply.

Before his sigh ended, he suddenly heard a woman’s laughter from the air. Startled, he looked up and saw a colorful cloud resting beneath dark clouds midway in the sky. Within the cloud stood a beautiful lady, adorned in palace attire, holding a dust whisk. She beckoned to Lü Dongbin with a smile: “Monk, what troubles weigh on your heart, sighing so deeply? If your burden is so great, why not return home quickly and enjoy the blessings of the mortal world?”

Hearing this, Lü Dongbin was both amazed and ashamed. He knelt hastily and bowed his head, saying, “I beg the immortal lady to descend and instruct your disciple.”

Before he finished, the colorful cloud dissolved into a wisp of azure smoke, scattered by the wind. Standing before him was the very immortal maiden, who waved her whisk and said, “Please rise, please rise. You flatter this poor Daoist.” Lü Dongbin rose and bowed four times. The immortal maiden returned the courtesy and said: “I am Chang’e of the Moon. In former times, I was tainted by mortal desires and was banished by the Great Yin Star Lord to the earthly realm. Fortunately, the Iron Crutch Immortal came to my aid and returned me to the Moon Palace. The Star Lord, moved by compassion, favors me even more than before.

“Now, by imperial decree, the Star Lord has been commanded to oversee the Moon. Because the world’s population grows daily, the original bright moon can only follow the earth’s path. To illuminate the vast worlds beyond the earth, it is utterly insufficient. Therefore, the Star Lord has pondered ways to add a lunar orb. The Star Lord summoned us to discuss plans for expansion. The proposal is to borrow several great stars around the earth, which will follow the original great planets, circling the sun. By reflecting their light, they will shine as moonlight, thus illuminating the entire cosmos. The original moon will then focus solely on the earth, its radiance growing even more splendid.

“The plan is set. We have orders for our Star Lord to be the Chief Star Lord of the Moon Palace, with many subordinate stars under his command. The Star Lord will select from among the talented immortal maidens who serve to be star officials. I, too, have been given a place and assigned to oversee the original moon. At present, I am investigating the distribution of moonlight in various places. On my way back to the original orb, I passed Mount Lu and met the Great Immortal He. She invited me to talk for half a day. She said, ‘By order of the Mysterious Lady, I await a destined person in the mountain to transmit the Heavenly Escape Sword Technique.’ I asked what sort of person she awaited. She said, ‘He is the disciple of Yunfang, Lü Dongbin.’”

Hearing this, Lü Dongbin was both joyful and astonished. He quickly said, “I report to the immortal maiden that I am indeed Lü Dongbin. My master Zhongli Quan has sent me to Mount Lu to receive the Heavenly Escape Sword Technique. To be awaited by such a great immortal is my utmost fortune. Alas, upon arriving here, a trivial matter detained me, leaving me trapped. Thus, I sighed beneath the moon, unaware I was seen by the immortal maiden. I feel deeply ashamed.”

Chang’e smiled: “I know something of your troubles. It was not from the immortal maiden, nor from my own foresight, but from meeting the Great Immortal Zhang Gu at the foot of Mount Jin. He was returning from Dragon-Tiger Mountain after saving someone. Upon seeing me, he spoke of your matter. It turns out the one he saved was also sent by the master to handle this affair. Now that it is done, he plans to return to his mountain and asked me to send a message to Erlang Shen, urging him to recall the Howling Heavenly Dog quickly, so you may not linger in the mortal realm and delay your true mission.”

Lü Dongbin, hearing this, thanked her profusely. Chang’e smiled faintly, lips pursed: “You are very polite, sir. I am not skilled in courtesy.” Lü Dongbin blushed, unable to reply. Chang’e continued: “You are new to the dao, your skin tender. I will not tease you. Let me tell you the serious matter. You know Erlang Shen and I are utterly unrelated. Why then did the Great Immortal Zhang entrust me with this message?”

Lü Dongbin hurriedly said, “I do not understand this reason and was about to ask you!”

But wait—the author writes here, anticipating the reader’s question: “Chang’e and Erlang Shen are truly unrelated, so how could she be entrusted with this message?” Yet the author answers: There is reason within.

To know the reason, please see the next chapter unfold.
