# Chapter Eighty-Five: Rebuking the Younger Sister—Er Lang’s Wrath Ignites; Repaying Emotional Debts—The Holy Mother Faces Calamity

Now, it happened that Chang’e spoke to Lü Dongbin, saying: “Daoist Brother Lü, tell me, why did the Great Immortal Zhang Gu entrust me—a person utterly unrelated—to deliver the message to Er Lang? This matter is long and tangled. Allow me to unfold it slowly for you.”

It was said that Er Lang had a younger sister who, at the end of the Zhou dynasty, had cultivated the Great Dao and, by imperial decree of the Jade Emperor, was enfeoffed as Lady Yuan Zhen. In the mortal world, the one commonly and mistakenly called the Holy Mother is none other than this very lady. Though she had attained the Dao and received her heavenly title, she still owed a certain bond of marriage to someone. For in her mortal days, from infancy, she was betrothed by her parents to a devoted youth. This youth was also a scion of a noble family, gifted in both talent and beauty, with a presence surpassing all others. Once the match was arranged, he heard that the young lady possessed all four virtues and was as fair as a celestial being; his heart brimmed with joy. Yet, the young lady, from birth, shunned meat and fish, wore no silks or brocades, and had little interest in worldly knowledge, devoting herself wholly to the Dao. Neither parents nor sisters could restrain or persuade her. Upon reaching fifteen, she abandoned her home. The youth, upon learning this, wept bitterly and died, vomiting blood. After the lady attained the Dao, she was granted the office of Lady.

Yet, because her husband died for love of her, every time she thought of him, her heart grew heavy with sorrow. She often lamented, “Though now an immortal, I bring no benefit to others; instead, I have caused the death of my devoted husband. Is this not a bitter regret?” Er Lang, her brother, often heard these words and would scold her, reproaching her for harboring such mortal feelings. He said she should no longer cling to such earthly attachments. “If you still hold mortal thoughts, why return to the mortal realm? Why come to Heaven at all?” The lady replied with calm reason: “What you say, brother, is the deepest truth and feeling. Even mortals cannot scorn affection or abandon reason; how much less immortals or Buddhas?” Er Lang, anger flaring, said: “A lust for passion like yours will surely lead to exile and fall into the mortal dust. Such years of cultivation would be wasted, and you would sink ever deeper into delusion, trapped in the cycle of rebirth. Then who will come to save you?” The lady said: “What I speak of is only affection and reason; I have no true desire to descend. Your harsh words are amusing indeed.” Er Lang sighed: “You err, sister. The difference between mortal and immortal lies in a single seed of the heart. Once mortal thoughts arise, one is no longer a true immortal. I fear your words today have sown the root of kalpas to come. Yet you remain unaware, arguing bitterly with your brother—how pitiful and laughable!”

The lady took his words as a warning meant to frighten her, and coldly replied: “I only know that affection and reason govern all realms alike. Whether in the Three Teachings of Heaven or Earth, none can escape this circle. The Patriarch Laozi, as the ancestor of immortals, descended to the mortal world several times—what for? The Western Buddha, the Tathāgata, is willing to enter hell itself to admonish the world—why else? Though I dare not compare myself to these two great ancestors, neither do I claim to be beyond affection and reason, lest people say I am an unfeeling immortal. More practically, if I cause harm to others and must be demoted to the mortal realm to repay this karmic debt, I do not refuse. As for seeing one’s true nature, awakening, self-vigilance, turning back from the brink, and returning to one’s original truth—all depend on one’s own resolve and cultivation. I have yet to see anyone who descends and falls into endless cycles without return.”

Er Lang, hearing this, burst out in anger: “I have warned you again and again, yet you remain so lost and foolish. It seems you are unworthy of being an immortal or deity, unworthy of imperial favor, no different from mortal commoners. As your elder brother, I have spoken to you with all due kindness and reason. You persist in stubbornness, without turning your heart. I can only let you be. Go then, be Laozi, be the Tathāgata if you wish. I have no such great merit or fortune. I will cautiously keep to myself as a Great Luo immortal, and dare not harbor any illusions. From now on, we siblings shall each follow our own paths, each pursue our own futures—how about that?”

The lady, seeing Er Lang press her so, grew displeased and said: “Brother, why do you torment me so? What I say is but my own view—that throughout Heaven and Earth, within and beyond the seas, in all public and private affairs, affection and reason must be the foundation. I was betrothed by my parents, and the youth died for me. Though I became an immortal and received office in the heavenly bureaucracy, I cannot repay him. Must I not at least hold a pang of remorse? Does becoming an immortal mean losing one’s conscience? Can one then disregard affection and reason, harming others for one’s own benefit? I know you think otherwise. Since you believe such behavior wrong, before repaying him, it is right to feel remorse, so that when opportunity arises, one may seek to repay. This is my sincere heart, not some secret lust or desire to descend and marry him in the mortal world! Moreover, if I had such mortal thoughts, why did I not obey my parents or heed my sisters, but instead strive to cultivate and seek immortality? Even with such effort, how could I ascend and be enfeoffed, equal to you, a golden immortal with office?”

Er Lang was by nature a fierce and competitive deity, unwilling to suffer humiliation. Now, refuted by his sister with no reply, he leapt up in rage, pointing at her and shouting: “Fine! With all your merit and deep cultivation, you dare argue right and wrong with me? Such boldness shows you no longer regard me as your brother. I no longer recognize you as my sister, a disgrace to our family’s honor. From now on, truly, we shall go our separate ways and never speak again. That way I need not worry over you.”

The lady, hearing the insult to her family’s honor, was so angry she burst into tears. She clutched Er Lang, pleading to accompany him to the Jade Emperor’s court to plead her case. Er Lang would not tolerate her grasping him; with a strong shove, he pushed her to the ground and strode off in fury. After a few steps, he turned back and scolded: “One more thing to tell you—remember this well: if you marry or steal a man, you must leave the immortal realm and return to the mortal world. Never again speak my name. I will consider you dead and never inquire after you. Should you cause trouble in Heaven or falsely use my name to do evil, I will press you beneath Mount Tai, so you shall never see the light of day again. Do you understand? Farewell.” Saying this, he turned without looking back, storming away.

Yet immortals may not speak lightly, nor owe debts unfulfilled. Lady Yuan Zhen, having owed her betrothed a bond, and having spoken words of willingness to repay her emotional debts before Er Lang, unwittingly set fate in motion. For in the realms of yin and yang, Heaven and Earth, there are spirits who wander day and night, recording all words, deeds, and thoughts. Once recorded and submitted to the Supreme Ancestor, these become fixed destinies. No matter how high your virtue or deep your cultivation, you cannot escape or reverse them. This is called the inexorable decree of fate.

As the lady said, matters of marriage require approval from above. Meanwhile, in the Moon Palace, there is the Elder Under the Moon, who governs all marriages across the realms. He keeps a ledger recording the reasons and dates for all unions. This ledger is wondrous indeed—not written by his hand, but whenever a destined couple exists in Heaven or Earth, their names and reasons appear when their marriage is set in motion. Not only proper matches, but fleeting couples or momentary pleasures cannot escape this book. When they unite, the Elder commands his clerks to tie their names together with a red thread. This thread seems born with the record itself—neither to be lifted nor torn—until one dies or the marriage dissolves, when the thread quietly vanishes without a trace.

Now, Lady Yuan Zhen inadvertently let slip a word. At that time, her betrothed had been reincarnated as a mortal named Wang Chang, born in Yangqu, Shanxi. He was just of age, traveling to the capital to take the imperial exams, and passed by the lady’s temple—commonly called the Holy Mother’s Temple. A heavy rain fell, and Wang Chang entered the temple to shelter. Seeing the statue of the Holy Mother, so beautiful in form, the young man, heedless of sin or consequence, inscribed a few mischievous verses on the plaster walls. At that moment, the lady had gone to Qiantang to observe the tides at the request of the True Lord. Upon returning, she saw the crooked poems and was furious. She ordered the temple’s guardian spirits to summon the youth back. A gust of wind turned Wang Chang back to the temple. The lady intended to report him to the Heavenly Court for severe punishment.

Yet when Wang Chang arrived, the divine wind left him dazed and confused. He collapsed under the corridor, appearing to sleep. Before interrogation could begin, the Elder Under the Moon arrived unexpectedly. The lady was greatly alarmed. She thought, as an immortal, what business had she with the Elder? Why had he come? Since he was present, she received him with due respect. Upon meeting, the Elder congratulated her. The lady was both shocked and angry, suspecting mockery. Only after the Elder showed her the ledger did she realize the prisoner before her was indeed her future husband. This case must now be resolved.

The lady wept bitterly, deeply regretting not heeding her brother’s words, which had led to this immortal-mortal bond. The Elder urged repeatedly: “Since the mortal bond exists, it will end sooner or later. Better to end it early, to secure your immortal career and avoid the ridicule of fellow immortals for harboring mortal thoughts.” Hearing this, the lady, seeing no other way, consented to marry Wang Chang. To avoid stirring her brother’s wrath, the Elder officiated the wedding that day, awakening Wang Chang to confirm the match face to face. The lady secretly observed Wang Chang—he was truly handsome and noble, worthy indeed to be her husband. After marriage, the lady, as a golden immortal with office, naturally could not descend. Wang Chang, however, was to continue to the capital for his exams.

At parting, the Elder foretold that Wang Chang would surely succeed in the imperial examination. Yet in the marriage ledger, another lady named Miss Niu—daughter of the current Minister Niu—was already tied by red thread to Wang Chang as his lawful wife. Lady Yuan Zhen said: “Since my husband is a mortal official, he should have a mortal wife to maintain his household. This is proper. I hope he attains honor and leaves the sea of suffering swiftly. As his celestial consort, our old bond may be considered settled, and I shall owe him no further emotional debts. If he remembers me, he may visit the temple, and I will present him with true Daoist teachings and secrets of achievement, so he may attain longevity and perfect the Golden Elixir. But if he is lost to lust and fame, then when we next meet, it will be too late to mend. Soon he will be but a corpse, rotting with grass, trees, insects, and fish, yielding no fruit. That would waste my heart’s counsel today.” Wang Chang agreed tearfully and took his leave.

A month after his departure, the lady became pregnant. She quietly gave birth in the temple’s quiet chamber and sent the child to Wang Chang. With this karmic bond resolved, she could serve her office peacefully, with no lingering attachments. Yet mortal-immortal marriages violate heavenly laws. Because Wang Chang had once died for her love, and though she had repaid him in kind, the weight of their karmic debt was not yet fully erased. She still had to endure one more trial to cancel this sin.

At that time, Er Lang was serving the imperial order as Inspector General of the Three Realms, charged with examining all deeds—good and evil, merit and fault—of immortals and mortals alike, and reporting rewards and punishments. Though a stern and upright deity, he had a fondness for humor. One day, at a banquet hosted by Iron Crutch, he met He Xiangu, the foremost disciple of the Mysterious Lady who had gone to Lushan to teach swordsmanship. After drinks loosened tongues, He Xiangu spoke casually of her past life and cultivation. Er Lang clapped his hands laughing: “No wonder everyone says He Xiangu has a husband! Now you yourself admit it. See, no one slanders you!” Embarrassed by his teasing, He Xiangu blushed deeply and, in a moment of rashness, retorted: “Er Lang, don’t slander others! Your own sister took a mortal as husband. You, Inspector General of the Three Realms, can’t even investigate your own family’s affairs?”

At this, the entire assembly was shocked. He Xiangu regretted her words, turning red from shame and fear. Er Lang, a deity of great wisdom, knew all affairs of the Three Realms, from matters of state to household trifles—nothing escaped his notice. Yet his sister’s affair was different: first, Er Lang was overconfident, believing no fault could exist in his own family; second, because it concerned his own dignity, everyone knew but none dared speak to him. Such is human nature. Though the matter touched celestial discipline, small though it was, it could not remain secret forever. He Xiangu’s words revealed what had long been hidden. She was deeply remorseful.

Er Lang’s face turned ashen, eyes red, and he remained silent for a long while. He Xiangu knew she had caused trouble; the other immortals quietly scolded her. She was so anxious she nearly fled. Then, recalling Er Lang’s blunt nature, she thought perhaps he might yet conceal the matter. She rose and apologized repeatedly, solemnly declaring, “It was all a jest, not true. Please forgive my slip.” Yet Er Lang had his own thoughts: as Inspector General, how could he correct others if he himself was not upright? Since rumors circulated, whether true or not, the matter must be openly investigated. He bore no grudge against He Xiangu, but thanked her for her warning.

Suddenly, he approached He Xiangu and bowed deeply: “Do not take offense, Immortal Sister. Do you think me a petty, selfish demon or evil spirit? Whatever my office, how could I be suspect and yet correct others? I have long suffered because friends thought to protect my dignity by keeping this secret from me. Yet dignity is but illusion; office is reality. Personal honor is private; heavenly laws are public. How can one sacrifice the public for private gain? This is the misunderstanding of friends who do not grasp the greater principle and seek to harm my future and reputation. Your words, though jest, greatly benefit me. You are truly a friend of righteousness. I hereby express my gratitude. After I finish my duties, I shall come to thank you properly. I hope all present will cherish me as you do, so our friendships honor the upper realms and set an example for all below—immortal and mortal alike. Friends who care only for face and not for principle are no different from those in the mortal world given to wine, flesh, and lust. I do not wish to see such friends.”

Having said this, he bowed again to He Xiangu, nodded to the assembled immortals, and strode out of the cavern. The immortals murmured, “Er Lang will surely deal severely with Lady Yuan Zhen. What will become of this?” He Xiangu was filled with remorse, tears flowing. Iron Crutch laughed: “You all are fools who do not understand. Such matters of heavenly discipline, even if He Xiangu had not spoken, the heavens are not like the mortal world. Which Great Luo immortal lacks the power of foresight? Even Er Lang himself, through overconfidence and neglect of his own family, was temporarily deceived. Sooner or later, the truth will emerge. He even complains that no one told him. But what office does he hold? What is his duty? If he cannot understand matters so close to home, how can he expect others to report? Who has enmity with his sister or serves as his assistant? Who should help him with such overreach? As for his duties, whether the matter concerns his sister or not, how can he feign ignorance? It is right that he now moves to investigate. If not now, then soon. This has little to do with He Xiangu’s words. She need not take it to heart, nor must you all worry for Lady Yuan Zhen. Given our friendships, we can all do our part to share her burden and protect her from suffering. When her star of disaster runs its course, we may petition the heavens to absolve her. If Er Lang remains stubborn, there are ways to confront him. What is there to fear?”

The immortals applauded. Lan Caihe smiled at He Xiangu: “By this reasoning, your words today have actually helped Lady Yuan Zhen.” He Xiangu smiled faintly: “That may not be so.” Lan Caihe said: “How not? Think—Lady Yuan Zhen broke heavenly laws and deserves punishment. Er Lang, as Inspector General, must judge the case. Yet since it concerns you, everyone feels some guilt and will take care of her. Isn’t that to your benefit?” The assembly laughed. Yet He Xiangu could not fully let go of her regret. She urged all to remain and await news. The immortals agreed.

After a long while, Iron Crutch, quietly calculating, chuckled: “Look at this—Er Lang is a fool! He has pressed his own sister beneath Mount Tai.” The immortals gasped. He Xiangu’s face changed, tears streaming, and she implored Iron Crutch to devise a plan to rescue Lady Yuan Zhen.

Chang’e, finishing her tale, made even the uninvolved Lü Dongbin anxious, scratching his head and asking: “Remarkable! This Er Lang is truly fierce. Even if his sister broke celestial discipline, the Elder Under the Moon officiated their marriage to settle the emotional debt. Strictly speaking, punishment is warranted; yet compassion might allow forgiveness. To imprison her beneath a mountain seems excessive. I wonder, honored immortals, can she be saved?”

Chang’e smiled: “Your own affairs remain unresolved, yet you worry for the ancients. With so many heavenly immortals around, is there truly no one to save her?” As for how she might be saved—this, not only you, but all readers eager to know—alas, this chapter has already grown too long. We must leave the rest for the next installment.
