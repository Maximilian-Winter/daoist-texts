# Chapter Eighty-Six: The Rescued Holy Mother Borrows a Glazed Pavilion, Sending Forth the Special Precious Lotus Lantern for the Infant

Now it happened that Chang’e and Lü Dongbin were conversing beneath the moonlight. Their talk turned to He Xiangu’s inadvertent words, which stirred the Heavenly Marshal Erlang Shen into a furious tempest of thunder. With his magic, he pressed his own dear sister, Lady Yuanzhen, beneath the foot of Mount Tai. Filled with deep remorse, the Immortal Maiden sought the counsel of Master Iron Crutch, saying, “If there is any entanglement, I dare not harm others; I am willing to bear the blame alone.” Lü Dongbin hastened to ask, “In the end, how will they rescue Lady Yuanzhen?” Chang’e smiled and replied, “Are you truly so naive? Among all the Great Luo Heavens’ immortals, which one lacks the art of secret substitution? Let alone being trapped beneath a mere Mount Tai—if she were confined beneath the vast sea, they would petition the Dragon King. Even if all the mountains of the ten thousand nations were piled upon her, they possess the power to move mountains into the ocean. Yet Master Iron Crutch refuses such brute force, for Lady Yuanzhen has indeed broken the law. If Erlang Shen were to rescue her immediately by force, first, the entanglement would be too great, almost like rescuing someone from a well; second, it would damage Erlang’s prestige and bring him shame. Neither is fitting. At last, he devised a perfect plan: one that neither harms Erlang’s dignity nor breaks the Heavenly Court’s laws, and yet makes Lady Yuanzhen feel no suffering from her confinement, as if she were peacefully seated in a temple as usual.”

At these words, the assembly rejoiced. Led by Iron Crutch himself, the immortals ascended to the summit of Mount Tai. There stood Iron Crutch’s cavernous abode, where his disciple Yang Ren cultivated the Way. Iron Crutch and the immortals first entered the cavern, where Yang Ren knelt to welcome them and inquired of their purpose. After a brief explanation, Iron Crutch sent Yang Ren out to summon all the local earth deities of the mountain. Yang Ren obeyed and gathered over thirty earth spirits, great and small. Iron Crutch instructed them: “Lady Yuanzhen, through some matter, has been pressed beneath the mountain by her brother Erlang Shen. This poor Daoist pities her, for her fault was unintentional and excusable. I specially invite you, venerable immortals, to lend a small favor. My intention is to uphold the Heavenly Law without breach, and to respect Erlang’s honor. Since Lady Yuanzhen has broken the celestial code, she must endure this temporary grievance. We only intend to act as friends, protecting her from suffering. First, we shall build a cavern beneath this mountain as a place for her to bear her guilt and cultivate the Way. Second, though she cannot leave the mountain, we shall visit her from time to time, so a bird’s path must be opened to the mountain’s base. Third, I ask all honored deities to lend their great power to guard the cavern and the bird’s path, sending attendants to watch over them so they do not collapse or close, and to care for her at all times. Should Lady Yuanzhen have any needs or messages, she may reach out to my disciple Yang Ren here. Do you all consent to assist in this righteous endeavor?”

The earth spirits, hearing this, naturally agreed unanimously, voicing their obedience. Iron Crutch comforted them, then led the assembly to visit Lady Yuanzhen. Upon reaching the mountain’s base, Iron Crutch cast a mighty spell, moving half of Mount Tai aside by a league. The immortals descended to the mountain’s foot, where they found Lady Yuanzhen disheveled and filthy, clad in penitential robes, curled up as if dead upon the ground. Among the immortals, He Xiangu was a woman of the kindest heart, especially moved since this calamity had arisen through her own words. Overcome with remorse, she stepped forward first, weeping as she lifted Lady Yuanzhen to her feet.

Lady Yuanzhen, seeing the immortals, was both sorrowful and ashamed, doubting if this were but a dream reunion. After He Xiangu explained the assembly’s purpose and confessed herself the cause of the trouble with great contrition, Lady Yuanzhen sighed, “All this is fate. Your humble sister has broken the heavenly code, harboring secret schemes. Such matters inevitably come to light; what concern is it to you, sister? Now, by your invitation, with so many masters and brothers journeying far to aid me, I am truly grateful beyond words. Should I one day be freed from disaster and guilt, and see the light of Heaven again, your great kindness will be repaid over many lifetimes.”

The immortals were all moved to tears. Iron Crutch then employed his wondrous art, journeying in spirit to the Sea Palace, borrowing a row of five or six glazed pavilions. Each chamber hung a bright pearl, shining brighter than daylight. Additionally, he procured two pearls—one to dispel heat, the other to ward off cold—and handed them to Lady Yuanzhen. Though imprisoned, she suddenly found herself with such exquisite quarters, far surpassing the temple’s humble abode, and her heart was filled with joy. Then each immortal contributed furnishings and utensils, making the chambers complete and perfect—so much so that it no longer resembled an immortal’s dwelling but rather the splendid home of a wealthy mortal family. Lady Yuanzhen even smiled and said, “Receiving such treatment from all of you, I dare not express my gratitude. But dwelling here so comfortably, I fear that when I am freed, I may become reluctant to leave.” Her few words brought laughter among the immortals.

Iron Crutch nodded and said, “A cultivator of the Way should see through all joys and sorrows, so as not to be bound by worldly feelings. Now, two matters remain to explain to Lady Yuanzhen. First, we have agreed that no matter when she leaves the mountain, among us ten or so immortals, one shall be sent every year to teach her some daoist methods. Though she is beneath the earth, she can devote herself wholeheartedly to practice. When disaster passes, she may ascend to Heaven’s realm and accomplish great deeds for the celestial family. This is most important.” Lady Yuanzhen, hearing this, was deeply moved and kowtowed with sound. He Xiangu hastened to help her rise. Iron Crutch continued, “Second, Lady Yuanzhen will soon give birth to a son. This child shall be nurtured by Great Immortal He Xiangu, who will gather the essence of mountains and rivers and absorb the radiance of the morning sun to craft a lamp called the Precious Lotus Lantern. After childbirth, you shall place the child and lamp in a chamber on the eastern side. The earth spirits will deliver the child to your husband Wang Chang. This lamp is no ordinary mortal flame; wherever its light reaches, all demons and evil spirits must keep ten li away. It is also spiritually perceptive, able to guide the lost. For example, when we wish to go somewhere, we need not ask this person or that; simply follow the lamp’s radiance, and there will be no error.”

As Iron Crutch spoke, He Xiangu interjected, “Leave this matter to me; it will be done without fault.” Then an elder earth spirit rose and added, “When Lady Yuanzhen gives birth to her son, I shall personally take charge of the escort. The task cannot be handed to mere ghostly servants, lest Lady Yuanzhen worry.” Iron Crutch, recognizing him as the earth spirit of the fifty-li radius, respectfully replied, “With your honored presence, Lady Yuanzhen may rest assured.” Lady Yuanzhen quickly kowtowed to He Xiangu and the earth spirits in thanks.

Blue-Clad Caihe, seeing his own limited ability, laughed and said, “I shall recruit a few others for Lady Yuanzhen.” The immortals all agreed, “Indeed, this is an important matter. It is fortunate you thought it through.” Caihe invited the chief earth spirit of Mount Tai to the summit and asked, “Are there any female demons nearby?” The earth spirit replied, “How could there be none? About a hundred li away, there is a White Rabbit Spirit gathering many solitary rabbits to cause mischief among mortals. Does the Immortal wish to capture some to serve Lady Yuanzhen?” Caihe nodded. The earth spirit said, “That is well and good, but these creatures are wild and unruly; they may become a burden to Lady Yuanzhen. What shall we do?” Caihe laughed, “I have my methods to keep them from running wild. Besides, Lady Yuanzhen has cultivated the Way for many years; when demons see her, they will only strive to ingratiate themselves, hoping to attain true realization. How dare they be stubborn?”

Following the earth spirit, Caihe took a swift earth flight to the place described. By chance, the rabbit spirit was on a clearing, playing grass games with many female demons. Upon seeing Caihe’s radiant and extraordinary bearing, they were greatly astonished. The rabbit spirit, leader of the group, harbored ambitions and said something to the others, then coquettishly approached Caihe with a smile, greeting him, “Daoist, whence do you come?” Turning to see the old man behind him, recognized as the mountain’s earth spirit, she laughed, “Why is this old fellow following you? Truly a rare guest.” Caihe smiled, “No one visits the Three Treasures Hall without cause. I am the Daoist Blue-Clad Caihe, come to invite you sisters to a proper place to care for a noble immortal now in distress. In time, there will be great fortune and good outcomes. Whoever wishes to come may follow. If not, I have already boasted over there and will drag a few of you along.”

The rabbit spirit laughed and said, “Though you look remarkable and clever, you are but a foolish man. Why would we, free and easy as we are, wish to serve another? Even if you force us, it would be like a dragonfly shaking a stone pillar—no movement at all. Better you stay here as our mountain lord. We five sisters will be your wives, living a carefree life. Why trouble ourselves helping that unlucky woman? What say you, Immortal?”

Having spoken, she cast a coquettish glance, her autumnal eyes flowing with charm and boundless allure. Were this a mortal, none could resist, falling into a trance. Yet encountering the pure-hearted Daoist Caihe, her infatuation was in vain. Caihe shouted loudly, like thunder splitting the sky, brandishing his sword and pointing at the rabbit spirit: “Do you think I am joking? Enough! I will now show you a little trick.” With that, he opened his mouth and breathed forth myriad silver rays, encircling the rabbit’s body and transforming into countless blades, all attacking the spirit. The rabbit spirit was terrified, quickly kneeling and kowtowing, begging mercy and vowing to accompany the Immortal to serve the afflicted immortal.

Caihe inhaled sharply, drawing the silver light back into his mouth, then commanded the rabbit spirit to rise and accompany him to the cavern’s entrance. The rabbit spirit went to confer with her sisters, and to Caihe’s surprise, the demons were loyal and willing to go together. Overjoyed, Caihe stood in the center and recounted Lady Yuanzhen’s birth, rank, current plight, and the help from the immortals. At the end, he earnestly admonished them: “You, as otherworldly beings, have cultivated to such skill—it is no easy feat. Yet to abandon the Way midway and gather in mischief, like mortal bandits, will surely bring destruction by heavenly soldiers. Why not seize this chance to abandon evil and return to the right path? Now, with so many golden immortals aiding Lady Yuanzhen, if you serve her long enough, when her disaster ends and she regains her position, would she abandon you? Moreover, these great immortals recognize you; with their slightest favor, you may ascend swiftly to the ranks of immortals. This is a rare opportunity. If you miss it lightly, I will find your home and other demons; in a dozen years, they will be enlightened while you remain demons. Would that not be shameful?” The demons all cheered, “We will follow the Great Immortal and never regret it! Should any harbor ill will, may they suffer thunder calamity!”

Caihe was greatly pleased and said, “It is rare to find such resolve; you will surely attain true realization. Even if Lady Yuanzhen refuses to keep you, I will act on your behalf to make you all immortals. But one thing: in human affairs, familiarity breeds contempt, so I must say this beforehand. If you wish to come, each must extend a hand to receive a talisman from me. Should you change your heart or commit wrongdoing, a mere gesture will unleash thunder and lightning to strike you down instantly. Do not say I am cruel. Know that the hardest trial in beginning the Way is taming the restless mind. With fear in the heart, this strong method is necessary; with time, it becomes natural. Your cultivation is nearly complete, and the thunder talisman in your palm will vanish naturally without need for me to undo it. Is this agreeable?” The demons all said, “Whatever the Great Immortal wills.” As they spoke, each extended a hand. Caihe inscribed talismans on them one by one, then led them, dispersing a group of lesser demons, to the underworld to meet the immortals. Caihe commanded the five demons to kowtow. Seeing so many radiant immortals, each demon felt ashamed of their own form and became truly devoted to serving Lady Yuanzhen. After completing this task, the immortals bid farewell and dispersed.

Meanwhile, Erlang Shen, ashamed that his sister had brought such disgrace, found no face to meet others. He requested leave from the Heavenly Palace and returned to his original post at Guan Kou. Upon departure, aside from transferring official duties to the acting heavenly gods, he left all personal matters unresolved. Even his ever-present Hound of Howling Heaven was left behind in his office, not taken along. Thus, the hound found leisure to descend to the mortal realm and cause mischief.

Chang’e finished recounting this long tale and paused for breath. Lü Dongbin then suddenly understood and said, “I had long suspected why such a revered god as Erlang could be so lax in control that his attendant Hound of Howling Heaven could secretly descend. Now, according to the Immortal Maiden’s account, the reason is clear. No wonder he could not be blamed. May I ask, what message does Great Immortal Zhang entrust? Why not entrust it to others but to the Immortal Maiden? Could it be that Erlang Shen himself might come to retrieve the hound? Please explain quickly.”

Chang’e nodded and said, “Do not be impatient. This is the main point and must be told. Lady Yuanzhen’s pregnancy reached term, and she gave birth to a son named Wang Tai. Though still beneath the mountain, his life was far more comfortable than being enshrined in a temple. Many earth spirit ladies competed to care for him, and several serving female demons attended him diligently. During childbirth, she suffered no pain. On the third day, He Xiangu’s Precious Lotus Lantern was delivered. An elder earth spirit carried the lamp and child to the capital city. Indeed, Wang Chang had already married the daughter of Minister Niu. One day, Lady Niu dreamed the earth spirit brought her a son. Upon waking, she told her husband of the dream. Before dawn, they heard a baby’s cries on the roof and were greatly astonished. They clothed themselves and sent someone up to find a fair-faced child with a small flowered lantern and a letter. It turned out that when Wang Chang and Lady Niu pledged their love, he had spoken of this, which she had thought a jest. Reading the letter, they knew it was true. The letter explained the lantern’s origin and instructed Wang Chang to keep the Precious Lotus Lantern always tied to the child to ward off all disasters. Moreover, it would guide the child to find his mother and more.”

The couple, knowing the child was born of an immortal, cherished him deeply. Wang Chang grieved for his wife’s plight and wept bitterly, falling gravely ill. Later, someone suggested that since the lantern could avert disaster, it might also cure illness. They hung it above his sickbed. Indeed, Wang Chang’s illness immediately vanished, and his spirit grew stronger than before. From then on, whenever anyone in the family fell ill, the lantern’s light was shone upon them, and they recovered at once. Lady Niu’s mother, over eighty, suffering from asthma and heart pain, was also cured by the lamp. Thus, the family treasured the lantern all the more, doting on the child as well. This is the latest news. Because He Xiangu felt guilt toward Lady Yuanzhen, she vowed before her to bear full responsibility for mother and child. Thus, she dared not burden others and frequently traveled between the capital and Mount Tai to report on the child’s condition. It is said that Master Iron Crutch has foreseen that Erlang will never allow his sister to leave the mountain freely, and fierce battles still await. Since the immortals and Erlang are comrades, none can speak openly. Only when the child grows will they teach and support him, so that his power surpasses Erlang’s and he may act on his mother’s behalf, defeat his uncle, and welcome his mother’s return to office. All this is now managed solely by He Xiangu, who has been extremely busy. But this concerns not you. However, your own matters stem from this. Hearing that Erlang returned to Shu in shame, leaving all private matters unsettled, the immortals felt pity and sought a way to restore his dignity. They recalled the old saying, ‘Only the one who tied the bell can untie it.’ They reasoned, ‘Marriage affairs are the domain of the Old Man Under the Moon. If he can officiate the marriage of Wang Chang and Lady Yuanzhen, this union is no mere chance. Lady Yuanzhen’s fault lies only in fearing her brother and keeping secrets, which became the crime of marrying without consent. But fundamentally, it arose from respect for her brother.’ Thus, they lessened her guilt and restored Erlang’s honor. Yet without the Old Man Under the Moon’s testimony, how could Erlang believe it? This elder is governed by the Lord of the Moon Star. Now, the Star Lord oversees male-female marriages. Though matters of ethics, he despises the mundane world, where good marriages are few and bad many. Beyond proper unions, there are wild fields, grass dew, and all manner of licentious tales. All these fall under the Star Lord’s jurisdiction. With his solitary and pure nature, could he tolerate such things? So, when appointing the various female stars, he relocated himself to the Outer World’s Chief Star, yet left the Old Man Under the Moon’s affairs on Earth, assigning them to my Moon Palace.”

At this, Lü Dongbin inadvertently said, “What of the impoverished Houyi? Is he still in his original place?” Chang’e, hearing this, at first suspected Lü Dongbin meant to tease her. Her cheeks flushed with anger, her almond face clouded, and for a long moment, she uttered no word. Lü Dongbin realized his slip and tried to divert the topic, but could find no words, his face flushing deeply, awkward and speechless.

Whether the two quarreled or not remains to be revealed in the next chapter.
