# Chapter Eighty-Seven: The Matchmaker Acts as Peacemaker, Erlang Reclaims the Howling Celestial Dog

Now, it is told that although Chang’e had endured two kalpas, she ultimately attained the immortal form. Yet, regarding the matter of Houyi, her heart still bore a quiet shame. When Dongbin inquired about Houyi, she first thought he was jesting, and her tone held a trace of displeasure. But seeing Dongbin’s anxious demeanor, she soon understood that he did not intend to dredge up old grievances. Thus, she answered with candor:

“As for that man, the Star Lord originally wished to relocate him to another sphere. But alas, this man and the Sāpo tree have become one, as if the tree were made for him, and he cannot leave it. To move him elsewhere, the tree must be transplanted along with him. Such a task is too troublesome, so the matter was deferred. Hence, Houyi remains where he is. Yet, since the Star Lord harbors this intention, it will surely be carried out in time.”

Hearing this, Dongbin felt his heart lighten. He then asked, “Since the Matchmaker is with the Immortal Maiden, might he journey to Guankou to explain this matter to Erlang?”

Chang’e replied, “For this very issue, the Great Immortal Zhang Guo has entrusted me to negotiate with the Matchmaker, urging him to visit Guankou. This is a duty he cannot shirk. I must return immediately and first settle this matter. At the same time, I shall ask the Matchmaker to deliver a message to Erlang concerning the Howling Celestial Dog. This will serve two purposes: one, it will relieve your predicament; two, it is a way for the Matchmaker to persuade Erlang to resume his duties. For if Erlang departs, even his loyal Howling Celestial Dog will slip down to the mortal realm. Moreover, other matters will be affected by his absence in ways unknown. He cannot, out of momentary personal grievance, abandon many official affairs and even harm innocent good people, such as the Wang family, who are among those affected. Erlang is a man who takes responsibility seriously and would never harm others. With this explanation, he will surely return to duty at once. Thus, your grave predicament will be resolved—surely a twofold gain, is it not?”

Dongbin rejoiced greatly and bowed deeply. “Were it not for the Immortal Maiden’s concern, your disciple would indeed be trapped in a dire siege, unable to find a way out. But when might you come to Mount Lu to impart swordsmanship? I fear I have caused the Great Immortal Maiden and others to grow impatient.”

Chang’e returned the bow with a smile and said, “This is a matter of the common good. According to Great Immortal Zhang, your origin is extraordinary. Not only do we fall short, but even the Great Immortals of the Great Luo Heaven are few who can match you. Though you are still seeking the dao, wherever you go, immortals watch over and protect you. Great Immortal Zhang acts only out of his own goodwill, and mostly on behalf of Lady Yuanzhen. Because Immortal He misspoke and drove Erlang away, he remains a distinguished guest in the temple. Now, all are secretly protecting Lady Yuanzhen, so naturally he must lend his strength—it is the true spirit of comradeship!”

With that, Chang’e smiled sweetly and bade farewell. In an instant, a veil of colorful clouds appeared before her, and she stepped forward, rising gently. Soon she reached halfway to Heaven, still waving her hand in farewell. Dongbin escorted her departure, then settled firmly in the Wang household.

Three days passed unnoticed. Seeing no sign of the canine spirit, and Erlang nowhere to be found, with no way to inquire, Dongbin grew puzzled.

That night, after completing his cultivation, as he prepared to rest, a sudden rustling came from outside the window. His heart stirred, and looking out, he saw a monk’s head peering inquisitively through a thin paper screen. To a mortal, this would be but a dark blur, barely discernible. But Dongbin’s vision was extraordinary—he could perceive the finest details and see far beyond ordinary sight. Even through the paper, more than ten paces away, he could see clearly. Yet, by nature honest and unsuspecting, he thought no ill and did not guard against mischief. Seeing nothing amiss, he extinguished his lamp and lay down to sleep.

Soon, the window rustled again, but this time with a sharper, scraping sound. Dongbin’s suspicion grew: “Could this dog spirit have transformed into a monk to stir trouble?” Though wary, he remained in bed. Peering through the curtain, he saw a sturdy monk reaching out a hand and tearing a large hole in the thick wall as if scooping dust. The monk climbed through the breach.

Now Dongbin saw clearly—it was the same Zhiyuan monk who had come to subdue demons before. His furtive behavior aroused suspicion of ill intent. Dongbin rose, lit an oil lamp, and greeted Zhiyuan openly.

Zhiyuan said nothing at first but scrutinized Dongbin’s Daoist robe, then asked, “Brother Lü, forgive my boldness—may I ask, is this the very robe you wore that day?”

Dongbin laughed, “Your humble disciple is so poor, where would there be a second robe?”

Zhiyuan examined the robe again by lamplight and nodded, “Indeed, indeed. Earlier in the shadows, I thought the color differed, but now I see it is the same. I have a small matter to discuss with you—might you consent?”

Dongbin, already guessing much, smiled, “So long as it harms me not and benefits the monk, I shall obey without fail.”

Zhiyuan smiled, “I cannot say it harms you not, but the loss will be slight. To be frank, even if it costs you, you must not refuse. Since parting that day, not a moment has passed when I could put your robe from my mind…”

Dongbin hastened, “Your concern touches me deeply, and I am most grateful.”

Zhiyuan paused, then spat, “Hold! I am no friend to you, no concern in my heart. I merely covet your robe!” 

Dongbin then understood Zhiyuan’s purpose and chuckled, “That too is a form of concern. Since the robe is my own, I should thank you for your interest.”

Zhiyuan laughed, “You are too polite. We monks speak only truth, no empty words. I will be frank: since that day, I have coveted your robe, though it now adorns you, it suits my needs perfectly. So I have waited several days, planning to take it once you retired, to keep it safe for you. Would that not be convenient? But you Daoists are stingy—penny-wise, pound-foolish. A mere robe—what value? Yet you wear it day and night, from waking till sleep, dreaming, even in your most private moments, never letting it go. We monks rely on the Bodhisattvas for sustenance, yet none cling so tightly as you to a single robe. I have lingered six or seven days, sometimes on the roof, sometimes by the wall. One night atop your canopy, I watched long into the dark. If you doubt, I have proof. On the day I sat by the wall, did Master Wang’s servant bring you fruit? You ate an apricot and shared the rest with your servants—does this ring true? On the night I watched your canopy, you spoke with a woman in the courtyard about seeing gods and ghosts, mentioning Erlang, Iron Crutch Li, Lady Yuanzhen, and the Earth God, with great enthusiasm. Brother Lü, tell me, who was this woman? She neither entered through the door nor did you invite her inside. How did she come and go unseen? Does she possess skills like mine, flying over eaves and walls? Or have you conjured demons or spirits to toy with you? Brother Lü, I truly worry for you.”

Dongbin heard these absurd, sharp words and found them both amusing and vexing. He laughed and replied, “Your kindness is great indeed. I would gladly tell you this woman’s name and origin, but alas, you are a monk who does not even honor the Bodhisattvas who sustain you, let alone respect a Daoist’s robe. Why should I reveal such things only to be mocked? The arts of immortality are vast—I do not fear your mockery but dread adding to your faults and deepening your karmic burden. My humble heart cannot bear it. So I must beg your pardon and withhold the tale.”

Zhiyuan was not angered but smiled broadly and said, “Such words are empty talk, not worth discussing. Let me be frank: now I see your stinginess clearly. No matter what, you shall not take off this robe. Perhaps you have nothing else, no inner garments even, so you cannot remove it—that I cannot say. But in any case, this robe you shall not shed.”

Dongbin laughed heartily, “Your insight into my poverty is vivid and true, as if you have seen it with your own eyes. But a gentleman remains noble in poverty. If one can broaden one’s vision and enlarge one’s spirit, not covet others’ wealth, nor steal, then even if destitute without a robe, it matters not. But shameless folk, unable to bear the sight of rare things, scheme ceaselessly to possess them, even by theft or worse. Such people, though rich beyond measure, are morally bankrupt and unworthy of humanity. What use is such wealth?”

Zhiyuan laughed, “You are sharp-tongued. At our level, praise or blame means nothing. What matters is practical benefit. Say what you will, I will do as I please. Returning to the temple, I pondered long and devised a good plan in two parts: first, a gentle approach, as now between us. I bow again and say, ‘Brother Lü, forgive me—may I have your robe? I offer a hundred taels of silver, enough to make ten or twenty identical robes. Surely this is no great loss to you.’ If you consent outright, we may become lifelong friends, brothers in the Way. How splendid that would be!”

Dongbin nodded with a smile, “And the second step?”

Zhiyuan said nothing, but produced a great black bead, gazing about the room. Suddenly, he noticed four paper balls, children’s toys, scattered by the wall. He gathered them, arranged them in a row, and blew upon them one by one. Each flew toward the wall, piercing a hole, all four passing through.

Dongbin was astonished, thinking, “This is true skill, no mere trickery or sorcery. Though my robe can repel blades, fire, and water, I wonder if it can withstand such craft.” As he pondered, Zhiyuan turned suddenly, grinning fiercely, and spat a mouthful of phlegm onto the floor. The spit burned through the floorboard, creating a hole, then slowly dripped along the edges.

Though Dongbin had studied Daoist mysteries for years under his master, he had never seen such martial skill. He was amazed but would not show weakness. Before Zhiyuan could speak, he laughed calmly:

“Who would have thought you possessed such talents? Perhaps learned in childhood play? A pity you entered the Buddhist path, wasting such skill. Though Buddha’s law is boundless, and with a smile or snap, could reduce you to ashes. Had you stayed among mortals, your skill might be unmatched by many. But this is no concern of mine. Your demonstrations just now show a fraction of the heavenly arts. If I were ungrateful and refused to yield my robe, you might use such powers against my flesh and blood. But reason says, when I first took the Way, I had no skill, while your true power is so formidable. Compared thus, it is like eggs against stone. Knowing this, and that I must surrender the robe, why waste effort? Better to comply with your gentle method, remove the robe, and accept your hundred taels in return. But alas, this robe is not man-made nor mine to give—it was bestowed by my master Yunfang to protect against blades, fire, and water. I dare not part with it. Its many benefits are why you covet it, and why I cannot lightly part with it. Yet, you have come sincerely, endured hardship, even risking theft for this humble robe. You may be its only true admirer. Though I own it, I do not fully know its powers. If you can destroy it outright, then it is useless to me and you may keep it. The matter is settled. Conversely, if you cannot damage it, then I need no great skill to overcome you—this robe alone suffices. Even if you had a thousand hands hurling iron balls and a thousand mouths spitting phlegm, all would be in vain before this robe. How then could you wear it? Thus, the matter may be resolved. What say you? Is this fair and just?”

Zhiyuan said nothing further, drew his treasured sword, and lunged at Dongbin. Unarmed, Dongbin used the robe as armor, dodging and parrying. Zhiyuan, wary of damaging the robe, aimed only at exposed spots. Dongbin was nimble, avoiding when possible, shielding with the robe when not. After several exchanges, a sharp clang rang out—Zhiyuan’s sword struck the robe’s sleeve, sparks flew, and the blade snapped. Zhiyuan was startled but grew more determined to seize the robe. Gritting his teeth, he vowed, “I will blind you first, then see how you dodge!”

From his pouch, he drew a dagger and aimed for Dongbin’s eyes. Dongbin feared this move most. Seeing a flash of light rushing toward him, he tried to evade but was too late. With a cry, he fell backward. Zhiyuan rejoiced and moved to strip the robe. But Dongbin was swift; as Zhiyuan approached, he leapt up, circled behind two square tables, and escaped toward the door. Thinking quickly, Dongbin pushed a table down to block Zhiyuan’s path, buying time to flee. Zhiyuan, enraged, kicked the table with such force it shattered, sending fragments flying and toppling a plaster wall. He then pursued after Dongbin.

The commotion roused the entire Wang household, who rushed out with lanterns and torches. Master Wang saw a monk and a Daoist locked in fierce combat and shouted urgently, “Masters, please speak calmly! What is this quarrel about? Let us discuss openly—there is no need for violence!”

But the two were engrossed in battle and did not heed him. Dongbin, relying on the robe’s protection, found no clear escape. Fortunately, Zhiyuan’s dagger only grazed the sleeve, leaving him barehanded, forcing attacks to head, face, and feet. Sometimes the dagger struck the robe, as if against thick steel. Though trained to endure pain, flesh and blood cannot withstand steel. After several blows, Zhiyuan suffered minor setbacks. Dongbin, however, was exhausted and near collapse.

At this critical moment, a sudden barking rose in the air. Master Wang and his wife cowered, crying out to Heaven for help, fearing the dog spirit’s revenge. Yet Dongbin and Zhiyuan clearly heard a voice scolding, “Wicked beast, you have caused great trouble and still dare to bark?”

Both looked up. In a flash, a golden-armored deity descended from Heaven, accompanied by a dog. Seeing Dongbin overwhelmed by Zhiyuan, the deity suddenly kicked Dongbin high into the air, and he vanished in an instant. Then he seized Zhiyuan and handed him to the dog, commanding, “Take him to Baoguo Temple and deliver him to his master. I will follow shortly.”

The dog howled fiercely and bit Zhiyuan’s leg. Recognizing it as the Howling Celestial Dog that had chased him before, Zhiyuan knew the golden-armored god must be Erlang. Panic seized him; all his martial prowess seemed to vanish. The dog bit repeatedly, drawing blood and causing unbearable pain. Zhiyuan cried out for mercy.

Erlang scolded, “No need to bite him further. Such thieves have unclean flesh and blood—no fear of soiling your mouth.” The dog barked again, then lifted Zhiyuan into the air, soaring toward Baoguo Temple.

What orders Erlang gave Master Wang, and the fate of Zhiyuan and Dongbin, remains to be revealed.

To be continued.
