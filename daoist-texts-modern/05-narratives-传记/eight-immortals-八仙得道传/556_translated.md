# Chapter Eighty-Eight: Lost on the Path, Suddenly Hearing of a Heinous Murder; In the Dead of Night, A Glimpse of Ghostly Spirits

Now it happened that Dongbin, struck by the Erlang God’s foot, was kicked into midair. He felt his body light and drifting, swaying amid thick clouds and dense mists, descending slowly. After about half a meal’s time, his feet finally touched the ground. Opening his eyes and focusing, he looked around—he stood atop a mountain peak, the ridges graceful and lovely, the woods and valleys deep and secluded. Though it was the dead of night, his keen eyes saw clearly that this was a splendid mountain forest. He thought to himself and laughed quietly. Since leaving the monastery, first he was tossed aside by the Crane Youth, and now kicked by Erlang God; his body seemed like a leather ball, tossed back and forth by others, with no say of his own. And where was he now? What realm was this? Both times, he had no clear understanding. The first time, he had asked the steward and learned he had arrived at Xiakou. Now, however, he was flung onto a high mountain, under a dark moon and sparse stars, deep in thick woods—there was no one nearby to ask about his whereabouts.

After pondering a while, he said to himself, “No matter. I shall meditate here for the night. When dawn comes, I will seek a way out. I have no wish to be escorted across the river by anyone. Now that Erlang God has descended to the mortal realm—surely summoned by the Matchmaker of the Moon—and with the Howling Celestial Dog at his side, he surely will not go after the Wang family’s young lady again. My responsibility may be considered complete. Here in Xiakou, there was no great matter; why should I linger on the Crane Youth’s words, waiting for someone to ferry me across? What if that child was playing a joke on me, seeking to tease me? Would I not be falling into his trap? But who knows how far Erlang’s kick has sent me? Perhaps to Lushan is on the way, or perhaps he kicked me farther and farther, leaving me stranded in a remote, smoky, pestilent place where no human treads—that would be truly dreadful.” At this thought, he involuntarily spat and laughed, saying, “How can a monk have such worries? Such wild imaginings only invite the laughter of Chang’e.” So he found a rock, sat cross-legged in a precarious posture, and cultivated his profound inner skill.

By dawn, suddenly from the woods came the sound of children playing and laughing. Surprised, he hastily rose and slowly walked toward the sound. Indeed, he saw three or four village children, boys and girls mixed together, playing with great delight. Dongbin thought, “From this, there must be people living below the mountain. I might as well bring these children over and ask them a question. If I learn where I am, my path will be clear.” So he stepped forward and stood beneath a tree, watching them play for a while. The children noticed him.

They all stopped playing, surprised, saying, “So early in the morning, where did this Daoist come from?” A girl laughed, “This Daoist doesn’t seem to be from around here.” A boy asked, “How do you know?” The girl smiled, “My uncle is a Daoist too. He often goes out with a group of Daoists to perform rites and ceremonies. I know them well, but I have never seen this Daoist before. Besides, the Daoists here look like us farmers—dark and rough. How could this Daoist be so fair and handsome, and so playful?” At these words, Dongbin could not help but smile. Then the boy who had spoken first laughed, “Oh, you like this Daoist, do you? You two are about the same age. You are eleven this year, and he looks only two or three years older, at most fifteen or sixteen. Today Heaven grants a good match; meeting so early in the morning shows you two are just right to be husband and wife. Let me be your matchmaker, shall I?” The girl, though young, blushed with embarrassment and scolded the boy. Several other children clapped and made a ruckus.

Dongbin, seeing their teasing, felt both amused and annoyed, and thought it not quite proper to question them further. So he stood there dazed. After a while, the girl, unable to argue with the others, began to cry. The children laughed, saying, “Little Jinzi is crying! If her mother hears, she’ll say we bullied her daughter. Let’s go back quickly.” With that, they scattered in a noisy rush. Only the girl remained, sitting on the grass, sobbing quietly. Dongbin, seeing no one else around, fixed his gaze on the girl and was taken aback. He thought, “In such a wild mountain, how can there be such a pure and ethereal girl? Though her looks are not especially remarkable, this delicate face paired with a rare and elegant bone structure—according to Daoist teachings, this is clearly the bone and spirit of an immortal. No wonder people say Lushan is a famed scenic region, where the land is sacred and the people outstanding. Even village children have such talent. I must not miss this; I will carefully inquire of her.” Resolving this, he approached and said, “Little girl, don’t cry, don’t cry. They were only teasing you. Crying only plays into their hands.” Little Jinzi stopped crying, staring with her small, round black eyes, appraising Dongbin from head to foot. She said nothing and did not rise, but shyly looked down, pulling at the grass. Dongbin asked again, “May I ask, little girl, where is this place? What is the name of this mountain?”

Little Jinzi giggled, tilting her head back, and said, “People say Daoists are a bit dull. You, Daoist, really are a little dull. You don’t even know where your own body is—how pitifully dull!” Saying this, she laughed. Dongbin thought to explain the reason, but feared the matter too strange. If she told others, it might shock the mundane world. So he made up a casual lie, saying he had been so taken by the mountain scenery that he lost his way, hence the question. Little Jinzi, half-believing, said, “You really aren’t from here?” Dongbin smiled, “Can’t you tell by my accent?” Little Jinzi nodded and said, “This place is called Lushan…”

At these words, Dongbin was startled into silence, yet filled with great joy. He hurriedly asked, “Little girl, did you say this is called Lushan?” Little Jinzi laughed, “I told you you’re dull, and you won’t admit it. I tell you the place, and you don’t believe me. Is your body fallen from Heaven, or grown from the earth? Or were you sold by bad men, or blown here by the wind? How can you be so dull!” Dongbin, teased by her words, blushed and laughed, saying, “Little girl, please don’t ask me these things. I only want to ask if this is the Nanchang region? And is the Lushan you speak of famous for a great waterfall known far and wide?” Little Jinzi raised a small hand and pointed afar, “Isn’t there a great waterfall below that mountain peak? That is called Incense Burner Peak. Tourists come all year round. My grandfather used to farm but also carried sedan chairs for these mountain visitors. He earned a lot of silver all year. When it passed to my father, who was sickly and fond of drinking and laziness, he hardly carried chairs or went to the fields. Luckily, my grandfather had bought some farmland and sold it yearly to support him. Sometimes, when he was in good spirits during early spring, the busiest season for visitors, he would set up a fruit stall at the mountain foot, earn some money, drink more wine, and be quite happy.”

Dongbin found the girl’s domestic tale amusing, and now knew this place was truly Lushan, the very destination he sought. He deeply appreciated Erlang’s kick and admired his divine ingenuity, much like when his master once shouted and sent him flying on the crane’s back, ascending halfway to Heaven—both acts of similar power. After a moment, he asked, “Is your uncle also a monk?” Little Jinzi was surprised, “How do you know?” Dongbin, seeing she had forgotten her teasing of the boys, smiled and nodded, “I have the secret art of divination, able to know what is in people’s hearts. Tell me, little girl, have your uncles spoken of any new immortals arriving here?” Little Jinzi laughed, “You’re a Daoist, yet say such ignorant things!” Dongbin asked, “How so? Are these ignorant words?” Little Jinzi said, “Of course ignorant! Such talk should come from others, not from you Daoists. I often hear my uncle and his Daoist friends say: ‘What immortals or demons? It’s all the Daoists fooling people. If people believe them, their business thrives.’ So such talk is utterly unreliable. Others may be fooled by Daoists, but you, a Daoist, are fooled by whom? Isn’t that ignorant?” 

Hearing this, Dongbin suddenly had a great awakening and laughed heartily, “So it is. Your uncle is not a true Daoist, only performing rites for money. So he himself, as a Daoist, does not believe in immortals or demons. Is that so?” Little Jinzi was about to reply when a woman’s voice called up from below the mountain, “Jinzi, Jinzi, you little shameless brat, where have you been off to in the blink of an eye?” At the same time, a child’s voice said, “Your daughter is grown up now. She already has a good man, a Daoist like you, just like your second brother. If they marry, it will be a perfect match.” 

Before the words ended, clear slaps and scolding voices followed, then the child’s stomping and wailing, growing nearer up the mountain. Little Jinzi seemed unafraid, still laughing and pulling grass. Dongbin could not stand it; fearing the girl would be beaten by her mother, he said hurriedly, “I must go. Didn’t you hear your mother scolding? Shouldn’t you go meet her?” Little Jinzi laughed, “What’s there to fear? I didn’t really steal a Daoist. Do you think she’ll eat you up? Even if I have a man, she won’t come after me. People fear her fierceness, but I’m not afraid. If she’s good, fine. If not—hmph! Don’t make me tell her secrets and see if my father doesn’t beat her to death.” 

Dongbin secretly stuck out his tongue, thinking, “This little girl talks so boldly—what will she be like grown up? But it’s a pity for her fair face and bone structure. Surely the local customs are too bad, or her family base too lowly, so that this pure and noble little spirit is gradually led astray.” After some thought, he decided to take his own path and not get involved, avoiding the scolding woman. Just as he started to leave, the shouts and scolding grew louder behind him. Dongbin, naturally warm-hearted and fond of meddling in affairs, hesitated, thinking, “Though these children are not good, I should not cause this woman to be beaten because of me. With nothing better to do, I might as well go back and see.” 

So he turned back to the original spot and saw a loud, fierce village woman driving little Jinzi down the mountain, beating and scolding her all the way. The boy who had teased Jinzi earlier followed, crying and complaining, saying he would tell his parents and not tolerate the woman. Dongbin watched, both amused and resentful. Suddenly, little Jinzi said a startling thing: “If you dare hit me, don’t blame me for being unkind. I only ask you—how did my grandmother die? How did my brother die? When I tell father, see if you can live or not!” This struck the woman dumb, and she dropped the firewood she held, soothing Jinzi, “Good child, you’re so stubborn, not like a daughter. If you say that, your mother will be beaten by father to death. What will you do then?” 

Little Jinzi, clever, caught the wind and changed course. Looking up toward the mountain top, Dongbin quickly hid behind the trees. Seeing no one, Jinzi smiled, “Mother, if you don’t beat me, I’ll help you and be on your side. If you want me to ask Uncle Wang, I’ll do it for you, without letting father or uncles know. Is that okay?” Mother and daughter laughed and walked down the mountain, turning around a peak, then disappeared. Dongbin, hiding behind the trees, was left dumbfounded.

Unintentionally overhearing such a secret, he suddenly understood the matter: hidden within was a heinous case of murder and betrayal between aunt and niece. He ground his teeth and said, “How can there be such a wanton and cruel woman in the world? I should not have turned back to see this spectacle, yet this dreadful matter reached my ears. As for other people’s family affairs, I should not meddle. I will walk my own clear path.” But his passionate heart to save the world could not let go. After a moment’s hesitation, he saw the boy still squatting under a pine tree, seemingly lost in thought. Dongbin walked over. The boy saw him and suddenly smiled, surprised, “Daoist, why don’t you go back? What are you running around the mountain for?” Dongbin laughed, “You love meddling in others’ affairs; no wonder that woman scolds you.” The boy cursed through clenched teeth, “If I catch that heartless murderous thief, I’ll tell everyone about her. Then she’ll know the power of Niu Damao’s hand.” 

Dongbin asked, “Your name is Niu Damao?” The boy answered, “Yes. I’m Niu Damao. My brother is Ermao, and my sister Sanmao. We’re much better than that little Jinzi.” Dongbin laughed, “Why do you call that woman a murderous thief? Such words are reckless.” 

Niu Damao said angrily, “Didn’t you hear what her daughter said about her? I should have dragged her to the village and exposed her, shaming her! Maybe the officials would have found out and arrested her, even executed her! But then I thought it was too big a matter. My parents forbid us from speaking of it. If trouble arises, they would beat me. So I hid here and didn’t say anything.” 

Dongbin laughed, “If you didn’t cause trouble, why hide here?” Damao smiled, then said, “Daoist brother, do you want to know about this woman? I’ll tell you. Everyone in the village knows, except her husband and two sisters. This woman is the wife of Zhu Xiaogui, called Mrs. Niu. Xiaogui is a strange fellow—you’ve never seen him, but if you did, you’d laugh till your belly broke. His head is crooked, with a big tumor under his neck, looking like he has two heads from afar. His body is short, about the size of us children. His face is covered with black spots, with one bulging eye and red eyelids rolled up to his nose—truly a frightening sight. We call this woman ‘Xiaogui’s sister-in-law.’ Though not pretty, people praise her slender figure and fair skin. How could she look down on such a husband? But she long ago took another man. Xiaogui loves to drink; when drunk, he is unconscious. This woman opened the back door to that man—oh, I haven’t told you yet—that man is the Wang family’s uncle, the one little Jinzi mentioned, surnamed Wang. We don’t know him well, but my parents and many others say he is a good gentleman. Many villagers speak well of him, as he is wealthy and does good deeds, saving many lives. So he comes and goes at the Zhu household, secretly with Mrs. Niu, and no one investigates. Their illicit affair has not been exposed. People are not afraid of Mrs. Zhu, but respect Mr. Wang.” 

Dongbin, puzzled, said, “This Mr. Wang must be a womanizer.” Niu Damao laughed, “No, he is very proper elsewhere, only close with Mrs. Niu. When he comes, she dresses up with rouge and powder like a courtesan from the East Street. They have been sneaking around for three or four years. Everyone knows, but Xiaogui is still in the dark. The damned wife—Xiaogui’s mother-in-law—several times caught them in the act. She threatened to tell her son. The woman and her lover pinned her to the bed and strangled her; she died without a breath. The next day, the drunkard learned of her death. He was a fool who understood nothing. They carried her coffin out and that was the end. But the woman’s eldest son, twelve years old, same age as me, was doomed. So big, yet his speech made no sense. He spread the news of his mother and her lover killing grandmother everywhere. Mrs. Zhu beat and scolded him repeatedly. Angry, he publicly revealed his mother’s secret. His mother hated him so much she poisoned him to death with arsenic. When he died, I saw his corpse; black blood flowed from his face. Ah, how dreadful! Yet the drunkard still paid no mind, and simply buried him on the mountain. Now everyone says Zhu Xiaogui is too stupid, marrying such a wife. That life will surely be lost at her hands!” 

Dongbin, furious, wished to chase and kill her at once. But since it was none of his business, neither kin nor friend, how could he rashly take sides? After a moment, Niu Damao left. Dongbin descended the mountain alone, wandered through the village, and recognized Zhu Xiaogui’s home. At night, he hid behind a large camphor tree opposite the Zhu house. Around the second watch, he saw a well-dressed man approach the back door, knock softly, and it was opened. It was the woman, laughing and chatting as she entered with the man. Dongbin muttered, “This is proof. The matter is indeed true. What is strange is that this lover’s demeanor is that of a gentleman. Why then is he entangled with such a woman? This must be a karmic bond from a past life.”

Before he finished speaking, suddenly a cold wind rose at his feet, swirling around him, twisting and turning as if something was entangling him. Though brave, Dongbin shivered. Gathering his primordial spirit, he looked closely and saw a mass of black smoke dart away, rolling ten paces off, emitting shrill, chattering sounds, pitiful and heart-wrenching. Dongbin was greatly alarmed and whispered, “Ghostly thing, if you bear grievance, show yourself to me. I will surely seek justice for you.” Just then, a traveler appeared on the road, rushing toward Dongbin, kneeling, grasping his feet, wailing and weeping, begging the Great Immortal to redress his grievance. This frightened Dongbin into a cold sweat.

Who was this person, and why did he seek Dongbin’s justice? The answer will be revealed in the next chapter.
