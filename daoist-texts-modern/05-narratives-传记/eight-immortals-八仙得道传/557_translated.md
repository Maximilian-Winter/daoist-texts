# Chapter Eighty-Nine: Subduing the Adulterous Husband and Wife at Mount Lu, Entering the Hidden Valley to Find the Blessed Cavern of Heaven

It is told that in a whirl of wind, suddenly a figure walking along the road was swept up, wrapped tightly in a coil. From afar, one could see this person enveloped in a dense black mist, so thoroughly shrouded that even he himself seemed to have become a lump of fog. In a moment’s time, as if his soul had fled, he lost all control over himself, tumbling and scrambling forward until he clung to Lü Dongbin’s legs, crying out loudly, “Great Immortal, grant me justice! Great Immortal, grant me justice!”

Lü Dongbin, gifted with the eye of wisdom, though it was night, saw everything clearly. He summoned his courage and demanded, “Who are you, wronged spirit? For what grievance did you perish? Speak first, so this poor Daoist may understand, then we shall consider how to redress your wrongs.”

The ghost wailed pitifully, “I am the eldest son Zhu A-ming of the little ghost Zhu. Just now, the Earth Deity sent word to me: ‘A certain Great Immortal Lü has arrived here. Your grievance can only be cleared by him.’ I asked this Great Immortal if he would stand for me. The Earth Deity said: ‘He already knows your family’s affairs; today, Niu Da-mao told him on the mountain. This Great Immortal’s heart is warmest, most willing to save people. He still lingers outside your back door, likely preparing to clear the injustice for you and your ancestor. Hurry to seek him, lest he leave. Miss this chance, and your grievances, old and young, will be buried beneath the sea, with no one to speak for you.’ Therefore, I hastened to find my grandmother’s spirit, and together we come to beseech the Great Immortal, earnestly hoping for Heaven and Earth’s grace to clear this injustice for us, forever grateful for your great virtue.”

Then the figure’s voice changed to that of an old woman, repeating the same words. Lü Dongbin knew this was the grandmother’s spirit and could not help but feel solemn. “What the Earth Deity says is true. I am not unwilling to meddle in others’ affairs, but having only recently taken monastic vows, my dao practice is shallow. This matter of ghosts is my first encounter; I do not yet know what method can save you and clear this grievance.”

Hearing this, the two spirits, borrowing the body of the man, knelt down hastily, bowing their heads. From that body came voices shifting between male and female, old and young, speaking together: “We only ask the Great Immortal to bring our spirits into his own home; we have our own means to deal with our enemies. But if a disturbance arises, the City God’s underworld inspectors will come to investigate. Then we must rely on the Great Immortal to vouch for us. The City God will pity our wrongful deaths and surely grant us favor, allowing us to be reborn sooner. We would be forever grateful.”

Lü Dongbin said, “If so, you should return home yourselves. Why drag me along?” The voice, now that of the old woman, replied, “The front and back doors are guarded by door gods; we dare not enter. We need the Great Immortal to lead us once, after which we can come and go freely.” Lü Dongbin had no choice but to agree, then instructed, “Follow me. As for this man who was walking, let him go back; do not trouble him.”

A-ming answered, “That man is no good. He beats his father and scolds his mother, secretly consorts with his brother’s wife, and even sold his brother’s son far away to be a performer. His conscience died long ago. Though living in the world, he has no yang energy left; only then could we two spirits attach to him. If he were upright and proper, his yang power would be so fierce that our humble souls would scatter like smoke and clouds, never daring to cling to him.”

Lü Dongbin sighed deeply and said, “Though so, you bear no grudge against each other. His evil deeds will bring their own retribution, beyond your concern. Now, to bring him to your home and keep him by your side is improper. Let him return home.” Before he finished, the man suddenly collapsed to the ground and came to his senses. Lü Dongbin ignored him and headed toward the Zhu family’s back door. Picking up a stone, he knocked once, and soon lights appeared inside.

After a while, a woman’s voice scolded, “In the dead of night, drunk again, stumbling home.” Lü Dongbin realized the little ghost Zhu had not yet returned. Waiting for the door to open, he glimpsed two black wisps rising from the ground, wrapping around the woman who opened it.

Lü Dongbin looked closely; it was none other than the shrew he had met on the mountain by day. Now the woman was possessed by two spirits, unconscious, dropping her lamp, leaving the door open, and turning to go inside. Soon, the room echoed with wailing, then the crashing of tables and stools, the throwing of knives and sticks. After a while, someone dashed out the back door and fled like the wind. Lü Dongbin recognized him as the adulterous husband who had entered earlier. Knowing the Niu woman was possessed and mad, he was greatly astonished. Seeing no benefit in staying, he returned the way he came and found a pavilion to sit out the night.

Early the next morning, he went to inquire about the news. Unexpectedly, the door was hung with many Daoist implements. Inside, cymbals, gongs, sheng pipes, and drums made a clamorous racket.

Lü Dongbin chuckled, “This must be the little ghost Zhu, driven frantic by the two spirits, trying to carry on his brother’s business by driving them out. Such scoundrels—unable to keep their own lives safe, yet trying to cure this adulterous wife’s madness.” Thinking this, he could not help but peek inside.

This glance proved a mistake. A young girl appeared—none other than Xiao Jinzi. Seeing Lü Dongbin, she fled inside. Soon after, a squat, ugly, pockmarked man emerged, likely the little ghost Zhu himself. Another, older and also pockmarked, dressed as a Daoist, was called uncle by Xiao Jinzi.

The two brothers dragged Lü Dongbin inside without asking questions, beating and pulling him to the altar where they performed rituals. Lü Dongbin asked, “Why do you seize and strike me without cause? I do not know you; is there some grudge?”

The Daoist shouted, “Who is this wild Daoist? Did he not inquire what family we belong to? How dare he stir trouble under the Tai Sui’s watch, letting demons in to disrupt my elder brother’s household?”

Lü Dongbin was about to ask for proof when the shrew woman, hearing his arrival, rushed out, prostrated herself, and kowtowed like a pestle pounding rice, crying, “Great Immortal, save us! Great Immortal, save us!”

This bewildered not only Lü Dongbin but also the two pockmarked brothers.

Lü Dongbin now understood somewhat and guessed they spoke of a pair of old and young spirits. But having just denied everything, he was about to question the Daoist brothers for proof. Now, embarrassed, he shouted, “Who are you woman, to pester me so, a stranger?”

Unexpectedly, the two spirits, unaware of his predicament, confirmed, “Great Immortal, we are the mother and son of little ghost Zhu. Last night you brought us in…”

Before finishing, the little ghost Zhu brothers sneered, “Well then, the demons have confessed themselves. What use is your denial now?”

Lü Dongbin was truly at a loss for words. He steadied his mind and listened as the woman wept, “…But this drunken man is unreasonable, calling in Daoists to perform rites to expel us.”

Lü Dongbin was curious. “Does this Daoist have any real magic?”

The woman replied, “Though no magic, their talismans and incantations are real. They just recited a scripture to subdue demons and ghosts. On us, it feels like burning fire and stabbing nails. We tried to flee, but then the Great Immortal arrived. Good Immortal, you are a golden immortal from Heaven; please see this through. We beg you to order them not to be so foolish. We are their mother and nephew, after all.”

Hearing this, the little ghost Zhu said to his brother, “No need to say more. This wild Daoist brought demons in, falsely claiming to be our A-ming and mother, coming to seek me. He dares to spy here; if it were not for him alone, why would he be so attentive, coming early to inquire?”

These words sealed Lü Dongbin’s lips. The little ghost Zhu raged, “This wild Daoist is a liar. Let us lock him up and see what mischief he can do.”

The Daoists agreed, “That’s right!” Another said, “Bind his hands and feet so he cannot escape or fly away.”

The brothers agreed, and all together they bound Lü Dongbin tightly like a rice dumpling. The little ghost Zhu said, “The broken house behind is no longer used for storage. Let’s lock him in there until Xiao Jinzi’s mother recovers, then release him for questioning and punishment, so he dares not return. No need to kill him.”

All laughed and carried the bound bundle to the broken house, slammed the door, and locked it. Outside, the brothers said, “We have no skill; we cannot scare off ghosts. You, great Daoist with heavenly powers, rest here a few days and then show us some amazing skill.”

They left in a clamor. Lü Dongbin, locked inside, was angry and depressed. The house was a converted latrine, filled with the scent of osmanthus mingled with foul, moldy, filthy household debris, stinking to the nostrils and truly unbearable.

Lü Dongbin thought, “This Daoist robe can resist weapons, water, and fire; its domain surely shields against such stench.” Luckily, his hands were not bound too tightly; he struggled and freed his right hand. Raising a sleeve to his nose, he found the foul smell vanished entirely. Waving the sleeve around, the stench was mostly gone. Solving this worst problem, he felt much relieved.

At noon, little ghost Zhu ordered his daughter Xiao Jinzi to bring food to Lü Dongbin. Fearing she might detect his escape, he kept his hands bound but feigned pleading, “Please untie my hands so I may eat.”

Xiao Jinzi, seeing his handsome face, felt affection and quietly smiled, loosening his hands. “You Daoist are asking for trouble. Our family matters scare even me. You, an outsider, why meddle? Now grandmother and brother’s spirits have been driven out by uncles’ incantations. Mother is no longer mad, but her body is weary, scratched by grandmother on chest, hands, and face, aching terribly. She will soon recover. When she does, you will die. Father and uncle are plotting to take your life.”

While eating, Lü Dongbin asked, “Why do your grandmother and brother not seek that villain named Wang?”

Xiao Jinzi said, “They try, but he is cunning. When mother went mad, father was not home. Mother grabbed that man, speaking only ghostly words. But he was powerful, not fooled, pushed mother down, opened the back door, and escaped. I don’t know what magic he used, but he scared away the wronged ghosts.”

Lü Dongbin pondered, then asked if she could save his life. Xiao Jinzi considered and nodded, “There is a way. If they do nothing this afternoon, at night I will take a knife, cut your bonds, and help you escape through the back door. But how will you repay me?”

She smiled sweetly, full of charm. Lü Dongbin thought, “This is truly the worst. How can such a child have such secret knowledge and boldness in illicit love? How can I deal with her? To coax her, I cannot lie as a monk. To refuse, she will never free me.”

After some thought, he said vaguely, “Young lady, do not speak so plainly. I am no heartless man. If fate allows, when we meet again, I will repay you with all my heart.”

Xiao Jinzi lowered her head, pondering. “Is that true?” Lü Dongbin said, “Monks do not lie.” She joyfully replied, “Then I will save you. But after the meal, my uncle and father will surely give you trouble. Then there is no help.”

She left, closing the door behind her.

After her departure, Lü Dongbin hoped the sun would hurry to set, waiting for Xiao Jinzi to return so he could escape. But the trouble she feared soon came. After noon, before the hour of the monkey, footsteps approached. Lü Dongbin groaned, “They have come to deal with me.”

Sure enough, soon the two little ghost Zhu brothers and a tall, strong Daoist entered. They saw Lü Dongbin’s right hand free and asked, “Who untied his hand?”

Lü Dongbin, not wanting to implicate Xiao Jinzi, smiled, “Since you kindly fed me, how could I eat without hands? I had to borrow this one. But once freed, it cannot be bound again. I must wait for you to try.”

He bent his right hand behind his back, ready for binding. The little ghost Zhu laughed, “This fellow is tough, a hard head who fears no death. We come now to invite you to move to a new place, very secluded and fit for a high person like you to rest.”

Before he finished, the two Daoists firmly bound Lü Dongbin’s hands again, twisting twice, laughing, “Let’s see if he can borrow this claw again.”

Little ghost Zhu said, “Brothers, no need to mock. Let’s get him out and ease our minds.”

The tall Daoist hoisted Lü Dongbin onto his shoulder, the two brothers following behind. They passed through the broken house’s back, down a narrow alley, then turned left at a small bend. The little ghost Zhu went ahead, gently pushing open a bamboo gate.

It was a vast, wild garden. The three led Lü Dongbin to its eastern end, where a high mound rose. The little ghost climbed up, looked around, and said, “No ghosts in sight. Let’s welcome him to his new home.”

Lü Dongbin wondered, “These three fools don’t know where they’ve taken me.” Before he finished thinking, the Daoist threw him down hard. The fall nearly stunned him.

Opening his eyes, he groaned inwardly. Beneath the mound was a deep, bottomless pit, its mouth hidden by thick wild grass, barely visible. Lü Dongbin worried, “It’s clear they intend to bury me in this hole. How can this hidden valley be called a new home?”

As he thought, the little ghost ordered, “Brothers, hurry and push him into the hole. If someone passes by, this will be troublesome.”

The Daoist strained to lift Lü Dongbin, the brothers helped clear the grass. The little ghost joked, “This is a perfect metaphor.”

His brother asked, “What metaphor?”

He said, “Isn’t this like the ‘Spring Bewitchment at the Cave’s Mouth’? Now stuffing a living thing inside, what does it resemble?”

The two Daoists laughed. His brother shook his head, “Not quite right; for a good metaphor, there must be an entrance and an exit. Now that thing goes in, is there hope to come out?”

They laughed again. Lü Dongbin thought, “These Zhu brothers are ruthless killers. No wonder they married such a woman, who killed her son and mother and still called them loving couple.”

As he pondered, suddenly he felt lifted into the air, heard two grunts, and his bound body was shoved into the hole. Lü Dongbin had long given up on life, feeling no fear. Inside the hole, he rolled downward, sides never touching anything, showing its vastness. He rolled for the time it takes to drink a cup of tea, still not hitting bottom. His wonder grew. Ancient tales spoke of bottomless pits; could this be one? The entrance was pitch dark, without a glimmer of light. Yet as he rolled deeper, light grew brighter. After another cup of tea’s time, he felt his body land.

He expected to be shattered, but midway hope rose: if his body landed first, the Daoist robe’s protection might save him from death. At worst, he’d be shaken dizzy, but survive. Whether he could get out afterward, he could not think.

Yet the world is full of marvels beyond all imagining. Upon landing, his body felt soft and comfortable. Opening his eyes wide, he laughed in amazement. Beneath the abyss was a cavern of heaven and blessed land. The ground was as smooth as a mirror, grass soft as wool, flowers fragrant, birds singing melodiously. Pavilions, towers, mountains, stones, and flowing springs adorned every place, creating a naturally noble scene. The little ghost’s word “secluded” could not compare to even a fraction of this splendor. The sky was high, clouds clear, the breeze gentle and pure. Immersed in this realm, ears and eyes were refreshed, and spirit brightened.

Lü Dongbin was overjoyed. Looking at himself, he found he lay on a broad lawn of fragrant grass. The ropes binding him had vanished. The places where hands and feet had been tied felt no pain or numbness. From such peril, he had arrived at such a wondrous place. He could not help but shout, “Today, I, Lü Yan, have truly entered the immortal realm!”

Before he finished, a warbler’s song laughed softly in his ear, “The immortal realm is still far away. Today you are but a guest entering the cavern, worthy indeed of your elegant name ‘Cavern Guest.’”

Lü Dongbin turned and saw a maiden of seventeen or eighteen years, leading several girls about ten years old, standing beneath a flowering tangdi tree, smiling gently.

Lü Dongbin recognized her as the mistress of this place. Hastily rising, he bowed deeply, “Disciple Lü Yan, entering the cavern in distress, fortunate to meet the Immortal Teacher, begs for your aid.”

The maiden hurried to return his bow, saying, “Let us count ourselves friends. The title ‘Immortal Teacher’ I dare not accept nor deserve.”

After bowing, Lü Dongbin sat on the grass. The maiden sat with him; the girls stood around solemnly. She smiled and said, “One who meddles in others’ affairs, eager to right wrongs, is naturally warm-hearted. But one must ask if one’s skill and ability suffice. Matters have urgency and order. What is urgent comes first; what is less urgent waits. This is true principle. Do you understand?”

Lü Dongbin, full of remorse, said, “I understand. I came to learn swordsmanship, sent here by Erlang Shen. I have barely begun Dao practice. Why did I not seek the Immortal Teacher first, but meddled in others’ affairs? My ignorance is great; no wonder I suffer many trials. Now I think, might you be the Great Immortal He who teaches swordsmanship? My worldly eyes failed to see this; I deserve a thousand deaths.”

He rose again, determined to pay teacher’s respect. He Xian-gu stepped back, waving her hand with a smile, “Teaching Dao is not necessarily master and student. We have no such distinction, only friendship among peers. If you treat me as teacher, it would hinder my teaching swordsmanship.”

Lü Dongbin accepted this and reported his journey, telling of meeting the wronged ghosts and bringing them home. The Immortal smiled, “You do not know: that little ghost Zhu’s woman truly deserves death and dismemberment. As for her adulterous husband, he is a good man. His later life holds great fortune. Such ghosts cannot approach him; his spiritual radiance repels them, and he is guarded by merit officials and ghost soldiers. Even if ghosts bear grievances, they dare not trouble him. In the end, they only trouble themselves.”

Lü Dongbin was amazed, “Sister Immortal, this matches what I heard on the mountain—equally puzzling. If this man is so unfilial and lawless, how can he have such good fortune? I truly do not understand.”

The Immortal laughed, “Not only you do not understand; readers surely understand even less.”

After a short pause, let me rest a moment and continue this tale in the next chapter.
