# Chapter Ninety: The White Snake First Reports the Virtue of Releasing Life — Immortals Still Bound by Unfinished Fate

It is said that in the affairs of the world, nothing is too strange to occur. Last time, we told how Lü Dongbin, having fallen into a secluded valley, paradoxically became a guest of the cavern, and there met the long-cherished He Xiangu. Truly, this was a marvel beyond marvels.

Yet, the immortal maiden spoke to him of how the villain who had treacherously slain two lives was in fact a great man of virtue—not only destined for grand transformation in the future, but even now protected by divine beings, freely entering and exiting the chambers of his concubine. Such words—could they not be deemed so strange as to defy all reason? Yet once revealed, the matter became utterly plain, scarcely worth surprise.

Seeing Lü Dongbin’s startled expression, the immortal smiled and said, “You have likely already understood that those two resentful spirits, the old and the young, no longer need the villain surnamed Wang.” Lü Dongbin replied, “Indeed, it is precisely this that astonishes me beyond measure!” The immortal laughed again: “Those who do not know the full story and fail to examine it carefully often jump to conclusions. As for this Wang, the adulterer, he surely deserves blame for his sin against a woman. But at most, he only committed the crime of adultery…”

Before she finished, Lü Dongbin interjected: “No, no. From what I have heard, there are crimes even worse than adultery.” The immortal smiled: “You must have heard the words of that child, Niu Amao, haven’t you? But it’s not only Amao. Everyone in their village who knows of this adulterous murder speaks the same way. Some, fond of grand talk, even change the facts, adding embellishments until the truth is distorted. In short, if this case breaks open, Wang will surely be branded a common murderer. Even the most discerning officials would find it hard to clear his name. But that is only the reasoning of the mortal realm. The twists and turns within are hidden from none among us immortals.

“Brother Lü, I’ll speak plainly to you. I dare assert that Wang is not a murderer at all; in fact, he does not even know how those two—the old and the young—died. His confusion and muddled pity are exactly like the husband of the woman, Zhu Xiaoguizi. They might as well swear brotherhood, for they are cut from the same cloth, indistinguishable in their folly. This is because Wang is a man of upright character. Though he committed adultery with the woman surnamed Niu, she would never dare tell him of such unfilial, heaven-defying, murderous deeds. Thus, even now, he refuses to believe those two died wrongfully. His fault lies only in the crime of adultery. Know this: he is not given to lust or pleasure. His wife died ten years ago, and he remained loyal, raising their orphaned child without remarrying. Even in ordinary pleasure quarters, his footprints are rare. Why then, alone with this woman of the Zhu family, did such ambiguous acts occur? To answer this, I must first tell you of his past life.

“You know what the woman of the Zhu family was in her former incarnation? She was a demon under the command of the heretical sect, one of their three or four talented operatives—a white snake spirit. That year, the forces of righteousness and evil clashed fiercely in Huaihai Village, turning the great sea almost upside down. Anyone who has cultivated the dao for a few years and knows a few recluses outside the world likely knows something of this.”

Lü Dongbin nodded: “Indeed, my master Yunfang has spoken of this.” The immortal said: “That white snake spirit, after defeat, somehow fell into the hands of a fisherman. Fortunately, a kind-hearted person bought it and released it back to life. Since then, the snake spirit has never forgotten to repay this person’s great virtue. After more than a thousand years, it was permitted by their sect leader to reincarnate as a human, using the body to repay its debt of gratitude. But the snake demon’s wicked ways and harm to others were many; its fate was long ago sealed not to live a smooth and pure life. Thus, when born again, it was mismatched with Zhu Xiaoguizi, nominally to repay kindness, but in truth only to be a fleeting partner. Now you should understand who its benefactor is.”

Lü Dongbin nodded: “I see. This Wang must have been the one who released it.” The immortal smiled: “In the world of human fate, whether righteous or wicked, there is usually a cause in past lives. Everyone says proper spouses are predestined, their names recorded in the Red Thread Register by the Moon Elder, matched by red silk. But even temporary, fleeting couples are not random. Their names are also in that marriage book. As for Wang and the woman of the Zhu family, since their illicit affair could come to pass, there must be some history behind it. Knowing their origins, the matter is no longer strange.” Lü Dongbin listened and only nodded.

He Xiangu continued: “But I know that the entanglement between this man and woman will not necessarily end in this lifetime. Because the snake spirit’s will is to repay kindness. When kindness cannot be repaid, and worse, it harms its benefactor, the deeper the remorse, the more urgent the attempt to repay, and the more difficult the method to be proper. You and I are fortunate as recluses outside the world, free from the dust and nets, not subject to unexpected calamities, and without fear for life. A few hundred years in the mortal realm are but a blink to us. What will become of them? Do not fear; you will see.”

Lü Dongbin was greatly astonished and asked: “Immortal sister, if this is so, do you know how their future will unfold?” The immortal laughed: “You are truly a warm-hearted fellow, worrying about matters hundreds of years hence! Alas, my dao power is shallow; I cannot know their full details. But I can roughly predict: the white snake will again appear five hundred years later to repay its former kindness. Wang will become a miserly man, but will still receive some benefit from it, far better than in this life. Yet the snake spirit itself, weighed down by old sins, should rightly endure decades of harsh tribulation. As for the final outcome, it will be exceedingly happy. Likely because through birth and death it never forgets to repay virtue. This conscience sets it apart from ordinary demon sect members, so it moves the heart of Heaven, is allowed to renew itself, and is guided onto the right path. Such is the general outline.”

At this point, the author must interject a word for the readers. The white snake’s repayment of kindness first occurred in the adulterous murder case of the Niu woman and the man surnamed Wang. The second time, five hundred years later, was when the white snake married Xu Xian as a proper spouse. Later, it was subdued by Fa Hai beneath Leifeng Pagoda at West Lake. Twenty years on, their son became the top scholar, was ordered to perform rites at the pagoda, and the white snake repented her past sins, returning to Buddhism. Many know this story; it need not be repeated here. Only their initial union and entanglement remain unknown to the world, so it has been told above, briefly and clearly.

Returning to Lü Dongbin, having heard all this, he asked: “What place is this? Why are we beneath such a deep cavern? How far is it to the surface? When I leave, which way should I go? And why are you here, immortal sister?” He Xiangu smiled: “This is my newly opened grotto, called the Jade Chamber Cave. Recently, the Patriarch’s decree came down, instructing each of us to settle in assigned places for cultivation. Iron Crutch and Master Yunfang, Blue Gatherer and Zhang Guo, some remain at their original sites, others have found new abodes—all nearly ready. Even you, though not yet a daoist, are specially regarded by the Patriarch. I hear a cave has been designated for you. When the time comes, Master Yunfang will take you there.”

Lü Dongbin hurriedly bowed to the empty air in thanks. The immortal continued: “This place was once a great earth fissure. So deep it has no bottom, no one ever came to inquire. Three years ago, I accompanied Master Xuannü here. At the valley’s bottom, our footsteps sounded lighter than elsewhere. Master Xuannü summoned the local earth spirit to ask, and it was true. She smiled and said to me: ‘Immortal grottoes are not on mountaintops, nor on the sea, but sometimes beneath the earth. Now, would you like to build a subterranean dwelling here?’ I was delighted and thanked her. She then summoned many ghostly workers and spirits, who with supernatural craftsmanship transformed this abyssal pool into a blessed grotto, where spring lasts all year, no rain falls, and the moon and sun’s essence lend their light; day and night are gentle and bright. Since the existence of immortal grottoes, this is surely the most exquisite and elegant place.

“I recall a phrase from the Zuo Commentary: ‘Our lord dwells at the valley’s mouth.’ What is called a valley mouth is but a cellar or pit made by mortals, only grander and more ornate, thus granted the name. Compared to my grotto, it is but a small wizard before a great one, a difference of countless leagues. As for exits, there are two: one is where you entered. I meant to seal it with a lump of earth to prevent harm and downfall. But Master Xuannü’s divine power is great. She foresaw that you would come here to learn the Heavenly Escape Sword Technique, and must enter by this gate. So she forbade sealing it. She said, ‘In a few years, you will gain a friend who will teach you my Heavenly Escape Sword. This person must enter here, and only then can the gate be sealed.’ Is not such divine power magnificent?”

Lü Dongbin again bowed deeply, offering thanks to Xuannü. The immortal added: “Now that you have come, stay here a while. Within a day or two, I will handle your unfinished business outside, and seal this cave entrance as well, thus filling a gap in Heaven and Earth. In future, our comings and goings will be beneath the great waterfall. None can enter without knowledge of water escape; none can reach my grotto without earth escape. This waterfall is my natural guardian, wondrous beyond belief. The water flows constantly and fiercely; though there is a cave entrance, ordinary eyes cannot detect it. A path that seems pathless—those who come by reputation alone, upon seeing this scene beneath the spring, can only sigh in despair.”

Lü Dongbin was filled with admiration. Then he asked: “Immortal sister, you said you would handle my unfinished matters—are these for that woman of Zhu Xiaoguizi? Since she and the villain have such ties, why bother with these trivial affairs?” The immortal laughed: “Fate is fate, but crime is crime. If I do not punish their adultery, how can I ignore the crimes of murder and harm to kin? Moreover, this woman is fierce and cruel. This calamity began with her; how could she be spared? Even her husband Zhu Xiaoguizi is foolish and cruel. From your side, though you escaped harm, the cruelty is such that the matter of murder is treated lightly. Such people do not deserve to remain in the world long; they should suffer alongside their brothers. Even if not killed outright, they should at least be maimed, to prevent further harm. As for Wang, his adultery was not from his true heart; he was not involved in murder. But Heaven’s principle is clear: good and evil must be repaid among men. If he were spared due to past feelings, people would suspect Heaven’s ignorance. Thus, some punishment must be given. Fortunately, he has many good deeds and has been a good man for many lifetimes. His good fortune is deep and his future blessings boundless. Let him endure some small worldly suffering; it is not serious. This case involves many matters. Normally, mortal officials handle such affairs; we need not interfere. But the case dragged on too long, no one reported it. If it continued, the dead’s grievances would never be cleared, and the living’s lives endangered. Our immortal family acts according to fate, doing good everywhere and saving people. It is fitting to display some retribution for all to see.”

Lü Dongbin nodded in agreement and said: “Immortal sister, your reasoning accords with my own. To be immortal or deity is to admonish and punish the world. If one were cold and indifferent, caring only for one’s own peace and ignoring others’ affairs, then one merely preserves oneself—what benefit is that to the world?” The immortal smiled: “Hearts differ, like faces; each sees as they will. Each acts according to their own understanding.”

Lü Dongbin felt a sudden emptiness. From that day forth, he began learning the Heavenly Escape Sword Technique in the grotto. According to the immortal, this sword art was created by the Fire Dragon Perfected One. But its method was incomplete, able only to change at will and travel as desired. Later, Xuannü obtained the method and further perfected it. Following her instructions, one who masters it can imbue spirit into the sword and hide the sword within the heart. Wherever the heart goes, the spirit follows, and the sword’s power is gathered. This is not only for saving life and the world, but can intricately weave all things, forging Heaven and Earth. Even the Great Golden Immortals cannot fathom its limits. Lü Dongbin’s nature was extraordinary, unlike ordinary immortals. Once guided, he attained the essence quickly. According to the immortal, Xuannü took thirty years to grasp one or two parts of the sword art and praised him as the greatest sword learner of all ages. Now Lü Dongbin, in a few days, comprehended its core, surpassing even the immortal and transcending Xuannü. The immortal said: “With your talent, you should master all transformations within three years. After that, your cultivation can borrow sword energy to increase power. When sword learning is deep, man and sword become one; man wields the sword, and sword energy controls human distractions, allowing for invisible progress in body and spirit. This is truly a divine sword’s numinous efficacy. Ordinary treasured swords cannot compare.”

Three years passed in the grotto like a blink, and Lü Dongbin had learned the sword art fully. He also mastered all the spells given by Zhongli Quan, practicing them to great skill. Common escape and transformation methods, summoning generals and inviting spirits—all were within his command. The immortal laughed and said: “Having learned the sword art, you still need a divine sword. Do you remember your master’s three-year appointment? Go quickly to the meeting place and ask him to find you a good sword. You must also cultivate it well to wield it freely.” Lü Dongbin heard this, bowed eight times in gratitude for the sword instruction, and asked the immortal to send him out of the cave. She laughed: “You have learned in three years what others take a hundred years to learn. Now you will leave the cave and enter the water as if on level ground. You need not have me escort you, but I must go overseas to visit a disciple. I will accompany you part of the way.”

Immortals act with the greatest freedom, unlike mortals burdened with attachments and procedures. Saying “go” is going. The two departed their grotto, walking only a few steps before hearing the roar of rushing springs. Lü Dongbin thought: “Could the waterfall above be pouring all the way here? Such a source must be very distant.” Looking up, he saw the waterfall’s descent—only a few dozen paces away, from the valley bottom to the mountaintop. He was so startled he paused. The immortal smiled: “Why are you dazed? Immortals walk step by step, like mortals, advancing steadily. How could they travel ten thousand miles by day and cross four seas by night?” Lü Dongbin realized she had used the earth-shrinking method and smiled silently. She added: “Now show me some of the skills you have learned these three years. If you never test your magic, when you must use it, you will be stiff and awkward, even panic and cause greater harm.”

Lü Dongbin smiled, formed the Water Avoidance talisman, and boldly entered beneath the waterfall. Indeed, the myriad streams passed over him without wetting a thread. Together with the immortal, he climbed to the mountaintop. She pointed to a village below and said: “Do you remember this is the place where you once sought justice and stirred up trouble?” Lü Dongbin laughed: “Indeed. I feared losing my resolve and did not mention it before. Tell me, immortal sister, how did you punish that lewd woman, her foolish and venomous husband, and the adulterer? Are these people still alive?” She said: “That is easy. I did not need to act myself, only used some means to bring the woman low, forcing her to write a confession. Then I revealed that the one entering the earth cave was a proper immortal, with good will to redress the dead’s grievances and protect the living. Hearing this, the brothers were filled with remorse. They thought to find you in the cave, to bury the woman alive before you, or throw her into the cave, and apologize. But I said, ‘He is an immortal; even if buried beneath Mount Lu, he can emerge. How could you harm a hair on his head?’ Now, if you seek to find him, you must lose your own life in the cave first. That is unnecessary. Yet you dare to harm a lone guest in a peaceful age—such crime must be punished. So they had their feet cut off. As for Niu, she was immediately killed. The adulterer, I learned his name is Wang Keming. Out of pity for his unintentional fault and his usual kindness, I showed some mercy and let him go. I see he is handsome; though he committed this crime, his forehead still shines bright. In five years, he will surely rise to high rank.”

Lü Dongbin asked: “And what of Zhu Xiaoguizi’s daughter, Xiao Jinzi? Has she not become an orphan without father or mother? The child is fair and refined. Alas, born into such a family, raised in vice, she has learned many bad habits, her words and deeds everywhere provoking dislike. Fairly speaking, this is not entirely her fault, perhaps her misfortune.” The immortal nodded, smiling: “When a child is born, it has no evil heart. Growing up, external things tempt and the person gradually becomes corrupt. This is due to a poor nature, easily led astray. Ultimately, the temptations that ensnare youth bear greater guilt than the youth themselves.” Lü Dongbin sighed: “This child is lively and bright; I wonder where she has drifted now.” The immortal sighed too, then suddenly smiled: “Ah, I remember. When you met this child on the mountain, there was another child acting as your matchmaker. No wonder you still think of her so.” Lü Dongbin laughed: “You are my elder and teacher; do not tease me so. Tomorrow when I see my master, I will tell him you taught me to do wrong. Do you think he will agree?”

Her words made the immortal laugh heartily: “Do not speak nonsense. My words are not entirely a joke. What did you say to the child in Zhu Xiaoguizi’s house? What promise did you make? Remember well: immortals do not jest or deceive. What is said becomes cause and effect. I advise you kindly: go to the Xiang River, find the child, and think of a way to help her transcend early. That will fulfill your earnest promise and repay your owed debt. What could be better?” Lü Dongbin laughed: “Today, immortal sister speaks only jokes. What reason is there?” She laughed again, nodding: “It is a joke, but truly, the child will soon pass away. You cannot help her now. But immortals act openly and uprightly. Though you escaped danger because of her, it was near to ‘crossing the river and dismantling the bridge’—something we should not do. Wait and see. This person will not benefit you in this life, but in the next will be your lover. When you two are deeply in love, you may recall my jest from beside your pillow.”

Lü Dongbin understood the truth in her words but would not admit it, smiling evasively: “Enough, enough. My master’s appointment is due; I must hurry to the Xiang River and not dawdle here.” The immortal smiled: “Indeed. Let us part. I must go overseas to visit a disciple. I hear this child recently accomplished a great deed, bringing honor to China. I must hurry to reward him.” Lü Dongbin asked eagerly: “Is this disciple the very Wang Tai?” She waved her hand: “Yes, yes. Let us go; no time to talk now.” With that, she soared on a cloud and vanished in an instant. Lü Dongbin also hastened toward the Xiang River.

What will happen next? We shall see in the next chapter.
