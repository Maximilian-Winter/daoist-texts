# Chapter Ninety-One: Meeting the Master at Crying Crane Peak — Visiting the Fox Immortal on Mount Tianping

Now it is told that the Xiang River lies south of Dongting Lake, sharing its source with the Gui River to the south, yet each flows on its distinct course. The place where these two waters jointly spring forth is none other than the famed Crying Crane Peak. The peak soars ten thousand ren high, its heights rarely trod by woodcutters or gatherers. Thus, many wild beasts and winged creatures often seek refuge here, hiding themselves to escape the snares and perils of the world.

Atop the highest, sharpest summit of Crying Crane Peak stands a towering maple tree, its branches piercing the clouds. Upon this maple nests a white crane, endowed with numinous intelligence and awareness. The locals say this crane and its nest have endured for hundreds of years. Whenever the wind is clear and the moon bright, in the deep stillness of night, one can hear the crane’s cry echoing from the mountaintop, resounding across three hundred li. Its voice is piercing and sorrowful, stirring the heart’s yearning for home, awakening the spirit of the departing soldier. Some say, “The crane is an immortal crane, its cry no ordinary sound. Thus, since ancient times, the peak was named Crying Crane Peak. Truly, it is this crane that gave the peak its name.” This tale is known to all residents within hundreds of li around the peak. Anyone who hears the crane’s cry can recount this origin. Yet the crane did not live a thousand years; its crying ceased long ago. By the dawn of the Great Tang’s Kaiyuan era, the people no longer heard its lament.

There were some burly, stout-hearted men who, eager to uncover the truth, gathered companions and climbed to the highest summit. Beneath the great maple tree, they peered and found the crane’s nest toppled, the crane’s shadow vanished. It seemed the crane’s kalpa had ended, its soul returned to Heaven. As the author knows, this is true. Readers who recall the tale of Master Xuanzhu guarding Zhejiang’s tides and his wrongful exile, and remember Zhongli Yunfang’s promise to his esteemed disciple Lü Dongbin, will piece together the crane’s coming and going.

That day, the weather had just turned cool with autumn’s approach. After days of accumulated rain, the sky suddenly cleared. At night, a bright moon rose, embracing the mountaintop. The crane flew out from its nest, wandering here and there. Meeting several fellow birds, they gathered deep in the forest, exchanging tales of their lives. Among these birds were those who in former lives had been unrighteous humans, now punished to live as winged creatures; others had cultivated the dao insincerely, condemned to bear wings and endure the hardships of wind and frost. In character and origin, all were far beneath the crane, yet their sufferings and tribulations were much the same. The crane dared not blame Heaven or resent the world. Reflecting on its own life, it had been loyal and upright in heart, though without great merit, never harboring evil thoughts. Yet fate’s cruel serpent ravaged, and through a moment’s negligence, it nearly met death—a tragic cycle of reincarnation. Thinking back on a thousand years of cultivation, only to become a mere bird, tears and hatred welled up. Though it dwelled in a constructed shelter atop the tree, it dared not relax. Each night before sleep, it would stand on one leg, tucking the other close to the trunk. Not out of hatred like King Yue’s burning gall, but with the resolve of Su Qin’s pricking thigh. First, to use hardship as vigilance—time is long, the path far, and fortunate to escape disaster and return to rank, it must not repeat past errors. Second, though exiled, its heart yearned for the immortal realm and dared not abandon study, standing rather than reclining, so awakening would come easily and learning deepen. All who pursue knowledge, without suffering hardship, find true mastery elusive—this holds for the Three Teachings alike, for both man and beast. This crane’s diligent effort during exile moved the celestial court and led to its pardon and return to truth. Later, all cranes, admiring this crane’s austere resolve to become immortal, emulate its example of arduous cultivation. To this day, cranes sleep standing on one leg; this custom traces back to this very source.

After conversing a while with many fellow cultivators, the crane found their wisdom uneven, their natures unlike its own, and interest waned. Its own bitter heartache remained known only to itself, never to be shared with other birds. After a brief farewell, it saw the moon hanging high, bright and lovely, and gazed upon it alone. Unconsciously, sorrow welled up, and it performed its nightly practice, facing the radiant moon, letting out several long, mournful cries. The other birds were startled, their courage vanished; exchanging glances pale with fear, they said, “Brother Crane has slipped into his absent-mindedness again.” Restless, they all hurried back to their nests to rest. Only this crane laughed and wept, singing and crying in ceaseless turmoil, alone in its lament.

This stirred sympathy among the moon palace immortals, who voiced their shared pity and grumbled on its behalf, for even they found it dull and joyless. Just then, a gust of wild wind blew in a mass of black clouds. They took the bright moon into their midst and hid it within the clouds, never turning back to look upon the poor crane. The crane, sensing the moon’s intent, nodded and sighed, saying, “My fellow Daoists surely cannot bear to see me suffer such misfortune, nor witness my desolation, so they hide away in the clouds, unwilling to look upon me again. Alas! Such compassion moves me deeply.”

Before the words finished, a voice came suddenly to its ear: “The world has order and chaos; fate has rise and fall; people differ in virtue and fault; fortunes ascend and descend. Since you do not forget your origin and deeply understand your numinous nature, you should accept adversity with equanimity and see all things clearly. Why, then, be so resentful and discontent over a little hardship?” The voice was soft and sweet, like a woman’s tone. The crane was greatly startled. Since its exile here, it had never heard a woman’s voice in the deep night. If not a celestial maiden, it must be a mountain demon. But how could a demon possess such knowledge? Surely an immortal! Hastily, it knelt, bowed its head to the ground, lamenting and begging to see the immortal’s face.

The immortal laughed and said, “We are all fellow travelers on the dao; such formalities are unnecessary. I am Chang’e of the moon. Just now, Master Iron Crutch entrusted me to send you a message: You have endured exile, your resolve pure and high, your cultivation diligent, and your plea has reached Heaven. On this year’s Mid-Autumn Festival, you shall be freed from disaster. Then, masters will come to your aid. At the hour between Shen and You, wait in the mountain hollow halfway up the slope. When you see two figures, one old and one young, approaching, they will be your masters. You may respectfully seek to become their disciple. They have methods to guide you back into the world.”

The crane hurriedly said, “I, your disciple, have sinned and been exiled, yet my heart is sincere in cultivation. I feared falling into the mortal dust, unable to save myself. Now, with the immortal master’s rescue, returning to the mortal realm—perhaps it is better not to return at all.” Chang’e laughed, “You have been a high immortal for many years, yet you speak like a novice. You bear sin and have long been transformed into a bird. Without first walking the human path, how can you regain human form? Even if the crane body can become immortal, it remains an alien species. And cultivating immortality as an alien is far more difficult than as a human. You think that entering the world makes you a mere mortal, but do you not know mortals surpass beasts in many ways? Besides, your original nature remains, and you have made progress in cultivation. Such immortal grace will not be extinguished by entering the human world. Moreover, with immortal masters to protect and guide you, your mortal rebirth will be but a moment, and you will soon become a true immortal. This is Master Iron Crutch’s heartfelt kindness to you, his old friend. Why speak such unskilled words?”

Hearing this, the crane bowed deeply, giving thanks. Chang’e said no more, revealing her true form, riding a cloud skyward. In an instant, she swept away the dark clouds, restoring the bright moon, now more splendid than before. The crane knelt again in awe. From that night forth, it ceased its sorrowful cries and no longer wandered the mountain idly. Patiently, it waited for the fifteenth day of the eighth lunar month. As dusk fell, it hurriedly followed Chang’e’s instructions, descending the mountain to the hollow. There it flew and paced, then looked about the heavens and earth, all directions, waiting. After the hour of Shen passed, it thought, “Surely now they will come.” It dared not even pace or fly, crouching on a high spot where it could both look up and look down, ready to greet its masters with reverence.

But long into the hour of Wei, no figures appeared. The crane’s heart began to tremble. Could Chang’e have mistaken the time? Was it not the hour between Shen and You this morning that it should have come? Had it failed to greet them, causing the two masters to think it insincere and refuse to meet?

Lost in such thoughts, it nearly fell into despair, even contemplating leaping from the cliff to end its life. In its anguish and confusion, suddenly a voice laughed in its ear: “Why do men always like to shed tears and moan? Such fussing and fretting—is it not shameful and laughable?” Hearing a human voice, the crane knew hope was near. It cared not who spoke or what was said, curling its long legs beneath it, bowing loudly on the stone, crying out, “Immortal masters, save me! Immortal masters, save me!” The voice laughed again: “You are too honest. Since I have told you this, naturally I will tell you about your two immortal masters. Hurry not. They are master and disciple, but the teacher is the former student, and the student is the former teacher. They are mutually master and disciple, a rare tale since the dawn of immortality. The teacher is Zhongli Quan, also called Master Yunfang. The student is Lü Yan, styled Dongbin, newly ordained, having just learned the celestial sword technique from Fairy He on Mount Lu. They agreed three years ago to meet here. Both are your masters, so I say you have two immortal masters.” Hearing this, the crane knew the speaker was Chang’e and felt great relief.

Chang’e recounted the past relationship of Zhongli and Lü. At last, she said the two immortals were expected soon. Because Lü had just mastered the sword technique but lacked a proper sword, his master took him first to Guxu. The fellow Daoist Zhang Guo was traveling through Wu and Yue and noticed sword qi faintly appearing in Guxu. He sought it among famous mountains and found its source in Mount Tianping outside the city, guarded by a demon who would not let it out. Yet the demon could not wield it. Zhang Guo consulted him repeatedly but found no solution and then told Zhongli.

Zhongli already knew the sword belonged to Lü. In fact, there was more than one sword, a pair of male and female blades, said to be forged by the couple Gan Jiang and Mo Xie in the Wu and Yue era. Originally two swords, they had been separated and scattered among the people. By the end of the Han dynasty, a fox demon found Gan Jiang’s sword and sought Mo Xie’s. Eventually, the two swords were united in one hand. One night, voices of a man and woman were heard in the chamber, followed by the clash of swords and flashing lights. By morning, the two swords had merged into one. The fox demon, terrified of the divine artifact, hid it beneath Mount Tianping and took a cave to guard it personally—the very demon Zhang Guo spoke of. Zhang Guo knew Lü’s background and, hearing he had mastered swordsmanship, wished to accompany the masters to retrieve the sword. Thus, they came here, fearing they might be late. Lü had planned to come here first to settle your matter before fetching the sword, so you would not wait in vain. But Zhang Guo had urgent ancestral orders to visit the capital, a weightier responsibility, so he went first to get the sword, asking you to wait a little longer. I was also on the clouds, anxious for you. Later, Master Iron Crutch sent word through me to remind you again. They should arrive no later than dawn.”

Before she finished, a tiger’s roar sounded in midair. Chang’e laughed, “They have come. This tiger was tamed by Zhongli as a child and raised by Master Iron Crutch on Mount Shaoshi. Now it is returned to him as a mount. Among immortals, only he rides a tiger. If not him, who else?” As she spoke, she revealed herself and descended. Five-colored clouds surrounded her, and she took hold of the crane’s neck, standing ready. The tiger’s roar grew near, scattering the dark clouds. Beneath the bright moonlight came two immortals, riding a fierce, striped tiger. The two first saluted Chang’e. Lü tied the tiger to a tree. Chang’e led the crane to bow before the two. Zhongli smiled, stroking the crane’s neck: “You have endured exile for hundreds of years without losing your true nature. Your future is boundless.” The crane, moved and sorrowful, recounted its exile’s hardships. Both immortals said, “We know all past matters; no need to speak further. Now we will take you to the human world. Are you willing?” The crane bowed, “How could your disciple refuse your planting and nurturing?” The two nodded.

Chang’e asked about the sword. Lü Dongbin showed her the treasured blade. As she took it, a thousand rays of cold light flashed fiercely, a spirit of heroism soaring to the heavens. Even Chang’e’s moonlight flickered wildly. Zhongli quickly brushed the sword’s tip with one hand, calming the light and restoring the moon’s steady glow. Chang’e laughed, “Amazing! With this sword, you could destroy my moon palace—how dreadful!” This made the two immortals and the crane laugh together. Chang’e asked, “Has this sword always been so formidable? Why have we never heard of it before?” Zhongli smiled, “Ordinary weapons wear out with use. But some treasured swords are forged by immortals from the essence of the Five Metals. The longer they last, the more brilliant they become. This sword, though not made by immortals, is forged from ancient metal, the refined essence of iron from the Nine Provinces, enriched with human blood. From its birth, it could fly to strike. Later, Gan Jiang sacrificed himself, and the couple’s spirit and essence were sealed within the two swords. After death, their heroic souls remained in the blades. The old fox collected them, reunited the couple’s swords into one, and cultivated it for centuries with the mountain’s water, sun, and moon qi. Now it shines brightly, able to rival sun and moon, melting the cosmos. In water, it disperses; in fire, it is extinguished. The sword itself has become immortal. Now it falls into immortal hands—a rare marvel of past and present, a heavenly and earthly wonder. How formidable do you think it is?”

Chang’e marveled, tongue-tied. Zhongli turned to Lü: “This sword is a secret of Heaven and Earth, a cosmic treasure. Not only is it rare for ordinary humans to encounter, even among the immortals of the Ten Continents and Three Islands beyond the Great Luo, few have seen it. As for wielding it, that is beyond dreams. Such treasures should not be flaunted. Flaunting breeds greed and strife, bringing war and disaster. Those who obtain such treasures do not show them lightly, not out of stinginess, but because there is no other way. How could such a peerless treasure be displayed to others? If fellow Daoists ask to see it, reveal only a diminished radiance and subdued aura, to avoid calamity. If you show its full form, disaster will surely follow, and regret come too late.”

Lü Dongbin respectfully accepted the order and stored the sword away. Chang’e then asked about Zhang Guo. Zhongli laughed, “That fellow is truly amusing. He does not much enjoy worldly play, yet now he has a wealthy post. Soon, the current emperor will pass to Heaven. The successor is a worthy ruler but burdened by the deeds of past emperors, likely to suffer great calamities, weakening the Tang dynasty and forcing the imperial carriage to move. Yet the kingdom will not fall. Zhang Guo’s mission is to enact these calamities by imperial decree. Coincidentally, he accompanies my disciple to seek the old fox. The fox said, ‘I have no fortune to wield this sword. Its weight is immense. So I hid it beneath the mountain. But having labored so much for it, guarding it for centuries, I cannot bear to part with it. Moreover, an immortal once told me that only a top-tier golden immortal of Heaven can wield it. Unable to use it, but able to keep it for a thousand years, I have absorbed its qi and spirit, and cultivated enough to become a sword immortal myself.’ Thus, he refused to yield the sword.

Later, Zhang Guo devised a plan. He said, ‘We must find one fated to face calamity, worthy of the sword. If he will surrender it, I can guarantee great merit for him. As long as he behaves properly, avoiding wrongdoing beyond his bounds, when the calamity comes, he will achieve true success.’ The old fox was pleased and peacefully yielded the sword. We then sent him to the underworld to be reborn as a northern barbarian child. This holiday delayed us an hour; otherwise, we could have arrived on time.” Chang’e asked, “How stands this calamity? May we speak of it?”

Zhongli nodded, “Though Heaven’s secrets are hard to reveal, we are not ordinary mortals. I may speak roughly without harm. After the fox’s departure, internal strife will arise in China’s court. This strife relates to palace women’s debauchery within and barbarian rebellion without, joining forces to bring great disaster. This is the general situation. But I see the fox’s suspicious nature; though fated to perish, it still guards against our tricks, perhaps causing new troubles. This is its own sin, its karmic retribution, suffering reincarnation again. Fate and calamity are fixed, but calamity is always harsher than fate. Since ancient times, special star officials sent down to cause calamity often fall into error once empowered, failing their mission and suffering harm themselves. People wonder why those fated to calamity, sent by Heaven, still err. They do not know that beyond their mandate, they worsen matters. Sometimes an edict covers one place but disaster spreads nationwide; sometimes calamity strikes briefly but poisons eternity. How can Heaven forgive this? Even special agents err so; how much harder for a fox demon, whose body is not yet formed and whose dao heart is unsteady? Truly, it is a trial beyond trials.”

Chang’e sighed, then asked, “You said the new ruler’s calamity is due to past emperors’ burdens. What does that mean?” Zhongli replied, “Many emperors of this dynasty were wise, yet lacked in familial propriety, and licentiousness flourished, leaving many unresolved cases in the netherworld. But this is the Li family’s private matter. The greatest cause lies with the former emperor’s overseas campaigns against the Wa barbarians. Those were blessed descendants ruling there for centuries, but their politics were controlled by demonic cultists. Their national master is a rhinoceros demon who, hearing of the Central Plain’s armies, conjured a great hurricane, gathering winds from all directions, scattering Tang warships, causing countless deaths. Fortunately, Wang Chang’s son, Wang Tai, enlightened by Fairy He, cultivated the Penglai dao and learned many immortal arts to prepare to cleave mountains and rescue his mother. Though young, his skill is great. Seeing Chinese soldiers perish beneath the hurricane, he was both angry and sorrowful, using sea-rolling and mountain-thundering techniques to quell the storm and ignite all the Wa’s great mountains. The fierce fire and dry earth caused earthquakes and many deaths, planting the seeds of future volcanoes. If dwarves again invade the realm with cruelty, he can, with a single incantation, reduce their prosperous lands to rubble within twelve hours. In my view, these people love war and lust, are cunning and strange, and will cause endless harm to China. Offend this young master, and more great earthquakes will surely follow. These are matters of the future, best left unsaid. As for the current great war, the demons are cruel and deserve execution. The emperor has decreed their punishment. The originators of this calamity—two hundred thousand vengeful ghosts—lay their blame squarely on the emperor himself. This is the chief cause of disaster for his successor and the great kalpa to come.” At this, Lü asked about Wang Chang.

How Zhongli replied remains to be told in the next chapter.
