# Chapter Ninety-Two: Warning Against Licentiousness and the Calamities from the Barbarian Land — The Elder Lang Conceals Himself in the Pear Garden Amidst the Tribulations

Now, on the banks of the Xiang River beneath the moonlight, Chang’e and the two immortals Zhong and Lü gathered together to discuss the matter of saving Crane Boy. Seizing a rare moment of leisure, they chatted about current affairs. Immortal Zhong had already outlined the causes and consequences of the Tang emperor’s destined tribulations in broad strokes. Yet only Wang Tai alone, though a patriot from youth, had caused the ghostly calamities in the barbarian land of Wa, slaying countless people—a cruelty too harsh, it seemed—and no imperial decree had ever punished him.

Immortal Lü did not understand and asked the master about this. Zhongli sighed deeply: “What the disciple sees is hardly without reason. But one must know that the Wa people are base in nature and cunning in deed, long despised by Heaven’s court. Wang Tai, but a mere child, bears no responsibility for defending the land, dwelling apart from the world, separated from the Central Plains. Even if he cared not for the rise and fall of Huaxia, it would not be said he was cold-hearted or indifferent to state affairs. Yet he roused himself by loyalty and righteousness, driven by solitary indignation. He sought neither fame nor merit, yet wielded his own magical power to fight for his homeland’s survival, resisting the barbarian’s tyranny. Such intent surely wins Heaven’s favor. Moreover, the burden of war lies solely on the emperor. Those beyond the emperor’s domain may be exempted, showing the Dao of the imperial Heaven’s mercy and grace. Besides, the Wa’s populace is unruly and their customs corrupt; in time, they will surely disturb the world. Wang Tai’s mastery of the volcanic arts means he can unleash disaster on the entire land at any moment. Perhaps this restrains their ambition—who can say? Thus his stratagem gained Heaven’s approval. Only that so many Wa perished, their deaths bear some guilt of his own. If the emperor openly rewarded him, it might seem a deliberate encouragement of chaos. So his deeds remain hidden, counted as merits offsetting his crimes. Otherwise, he might yet have some credit to his name—who can tell?”

They talked long into the night, until dawn was near. Chang’e, charged with the duty of the moonlight’s comings and goings, could stay no longer and hurriedly took her leave. Zhong and Lü then escorted Crane Boy to the underworld, petitioning the King of the Netherworld to arrange his rebirth into a family of honest and kind officials. This Crane Boy was none other than Han Xiangzi among the Eight Immortals. His father was Han Hui, the uncle of Han Wengong, the Confucian scholar of eight generations from Changli, later known as Han Changli, the younger brother of Xiangzi’s father.

After sending off Crane Boy, Zhongli took Dongbin with him to the Qianyun Cliff atop Mount Emei in Shu, to practice alchemical refinement and qi nourishment. Before leaving, Dongbin inquired about his family and parents. Zhongli smiled: “No need for you to worry. Your honored father had a dream in which I enlightened him; he has grown weary of the red dust and now cultivates the dao at home. I have taught them many introductory formulas and cultivation methods. By the time you succeed, they will have some merit of their own. When you visit in person, that will create a small auspicious influence—quite rare indeed. As for your son, destined for fame and rank, he will pursue his own achievements in due course. You need not trouble yourself over him.” Dongbin gratefully bowed his thanks.

Thereafter, Dongbin stayed at Qianyun Cliff for five years, penetrating cause and effect, returning to his original true nature. Counting from the day he left home, it had been barely ten years, yet he had already attained the Great Luo immortal body, standing shoulder to shoulder with Iron Crutch and Zhongli among the Golden Immortals. Truly, he was the fastest to cultivate immortality from antiquity, the swiftest to succeed. This was because his roots were originally profound, and his intent was to save the world and deliver beings, sent by imperial decree—not like those who fell from grace through faults in the red dust. How could others hope to match him? After his attainment, the Old Patriarch bestowed upon him the Secret Pivot of the Mysterious Capital, a tome containing all the magical arts known to the Three Realms’ immortals—embracing all phenomena, seizing the creative powers of Heaven and Earth. It was the most complete scripture within the Three Pure Ones’ official canon, a nameless marvel beyond ordinary immortals’ reach. Even among the Eight Immortals, only Iron Crutch and Zhongli might glimpse its full breadth.

Later, Dongbin retained the office originally held by the Eastern Emperor of Flourishing Splendor, and the book was kept in the Eastern Emperor’s hall. Dongbin read it thoroughly, his divine powers greatest, his holy deeds most numerous. The world called him Master Lü or Pure Yang Son, yet dared not speak his true name. He himself sometimes called himself the Returning Daoist. “Returning” is two mouths, the same as the character Lü, hinting at his meaning. He was also known as the Mountain Stone Master—“mountain stone” being the character for rock split apart. Another sobriquet was Valley Guest, a compound meaning of the two characters in Dongbin’s name, reflecting his vow to save all beings. While other immortals ascended to Heaven and rarely tread the mortal world, only Master Lü frequently took human form, changing names at will wherever he went—this is a tale for later.

Now, after Master Lü’s attainment, he wandered with his teacher across seas and lands for several years, accruing many merits. Then, with his teacher and the immortals Iron Crutch, Caihe, and He Xiangu, he paid homage to the Great Emperor. The Emperor hosted a banquet in the Lingxiao Palace, giving warm instructions to encourage him to fulfill his duties. After leaving the palace, Zhongli took him to pay respects to the Three Pure Ones, the Queen Mother of the West, the Mysterious Lady, and the gods of various mountains and caverns. Such rites are customary for immortals after their attainment. When all was done, Zhongli hosted a feast at his own residence, inviting many immortals to join. During the banquet, talk turned to Zhang Guo, now in the capital, whom the Tang emperor wished to see. Zhang Guo, however, refused to present himself, for the emperor favored a band of sorcerers whose wicked aura filled the palace. Zhang Guo scorned associating with such folk, yet did not want to oppose them openly, so he hesitated.

Zhongli smiled at Master Lü: “Old Zhang is stubborn and aloof. Since he’s charged with overseeing the tribulations, perhaps he must conform a bit. I think when you descend the mountain, you should first come with me to meet Old Zhang. If you can help him a little, that will be your merit.” Master Lü gladly agreed: “Your disciple is willing.” After the banquet, the immortals exchanged gifts, and Master Lü accepted all with bows. That very day, he accompanied Zhongli to Chang’an.

At this time, Zhang Guo had transformed into a theatrical official, mingling among the Pear Garden troupe. Zhongli found him and introduced Master Lü, explaining the purpose of aid. Zhang Guo was greatly pleased, laughing: “Though I mingle here, I detest their noisy arrogance. Now there is a marvelous matter. A sorcerer named Ye Fashan, before the new emperor, babbled that in the Pear Garden there is an old man, nameless and unknown, calling himself ‘Foolish Old One.’ This man is Zhang Guo’s incarnation, possessing great dao power. The emperor summoned me several times, but I claimed illness and dared not appear. Meanwhile, our troupe leader repeatedly reported that the ‘Foolish Old One’ is a stubborn old fool, skilled only in teaching drama, with no other talents. He begged the emperor not to believe the sorcerer’s nonsense.

But Ye Fashan, enraged to red-faced fury, secretly petitioned: ‘Since that is so, Your Majesty should summon him to the palace and have him teach these theatrical youths to sing before Your Majesty’s dragon countenance. Whether he is truly an immortal, we shall have means to expose him.’ The emperor, hearing this, immediately summoned our entire troupe. I, however, refused to reveal my true form. When entering, I appeared as a poor old man. I do not favor officialdom’s ways; I feigned ignorance and told them to treat me as a wild man. The emperor paid close attention, and after the performance ordered the eunuchs to summon me. I then transformed into a young page. The emperor said, ‘This is not the man; just now I saw an old man, why summon a child now?’ The troupe leader was baffled, bowing repeatedly: ‘I am to blame, for I brought him in as an old man, but somehow his form changed so quickly. I have never seen such a person, nor know whence he came.’

The emperor grew suspicious and asked me in person: ‘Who are you?’ I replied, ‘A teacher in the Pear Garden.’ The emperor laughed and asked how many teachers were in your troupe. I answered, ‘Only I, with two assistants who have not entered the palace.’ The emperor was amazed and ordered me to go down and teach another set of lines. I went down and turned back into the old man’s form. The palace echoed with laughter and wonder. Yet that villain Ye Fashan reported to the emperor: ‘Your Majesty, this man must have great divine powers to change forms before Your Majesty’s face. If not a true immortal, how could he dare such boldness?’ The emperor nodded and repeatedly summoned me, smiling kindly: ‘Some say you are the immortal Zhang Guo, playing in the mortal world. Is it so? I deeply believe in Daoism and admire the immortal teachings. If you are truly Immortal Zhang, why not grant me a glimpse of your true form? I wish to welcome you sincerely. Please reside in the palace, and I shall seek your counsel day and night. What say you?’”

Master Lü laughed and asked, “How did you respond, master uncle?” Zhang Guo chuckled: “How could I admit it? I lied and said, ‘I have no friends named Zhang, nor do I know how to write that character. How could I be Immortal Zhang?’ The emperor, at a loss, ordered us to withdraw. The emperor’s heart, suspecting my shifting forms, nicknamed me ‘Elder Lang.’” Before he finished, the two immortals laughed: “A fine name, a fine title. This is indeed a good story from the Pear Garden.”

Immortal Zhong nodded: “I knew you had a special destiny, destined to be revered in some playful art. Perhaps the name Elder Lang will be remembered far into the future.” Immortal Lü smiled: “The Pear Garden is the ancestor of all theatrical troupes. Elder Lang became the ancestor of theatrical teachers. If the sage’s words hold true, future performers will surely honor Elder Lang as a deity. This fits your master’s prophecy of a special destiny.” Zhang Guo laughed heartily.

Zhongli then spoke seriously: “Since it is a game, truly a game, Dao brother, you bear a heavy responsibility. Now that you have entered the imperial city’s forbidden precincts, why so stubbornly refuse to meet the emperor? We monks adapt to customs and form connections; there is no fixed rule. If it benefits the people, one must strive to do it. Though the emperor faces tribulations, if he can be guided to true sincerity in the Dao, diligent governance, and love for the people, restraining desires and cherishing blessings, then though the tribulations are fixed, they may be averted or lessened. This benefits both country and people. How can you not wish to act on such ready merit? Otherwise, what use is being a Golden Immortal of Heaven?”

Hearing this, Zhang Guo seemed to awaken from a dream: “Your humble servant is ignorant and narrow-minded, stubborn by nature, and reluctant to approach the imperial presence. Hence this failure of conduct. Now, enlightened by your guidance, my mind is clear. I hear the emperor has ordered Ye Fashan to hasten efforts to persuade me to the palace. He wishes to honor me as national teacher, receiving counsel morning and evening. It seems Fashan will come to seek me soon. But I have already cleverly denied being Zhang Guo. How can I now admit it?” Immortal Lü smiled: “That is easy. When the emperor summons master uncle again, I can appear as your ‘Foolish Old One’ while you sit somewhere above. When the emperor asks about the young page, the page will explain, presenting you. This way, you neither expose your old fool’s deception, avoiding the crime of deceiving the sovereign, nor validate Ye Fashan’s false report. The emperor can then distance himself from that troublemaker. A plan that kills two birds with one stone. What say you, master uncle?” Zhong and Zhang both agreed: “A brilliant plan!”

As the three immortals conversed, suddenly the Pear Garden troupe leader entered. Zhong and Lü concealed themselves. The leader, seeing Zhang Guo, frowned deeply and sighed, stamping his feet: “Master, this is truly bad. I don’t know what joke that Ye Fashan plays on us, calling you Immortal Zhang. Now the emperor summons us to perform again, supposedly just you alone. He wants proof whether you are truly Immortal Zhang. Ye Fashan said this himself. He told me if you do not admit it, he will imprison me in the celestial dungeon before speaking to you. Master, though you are not Immortal Zhang, you have some transformation skills. Otherwise, how could you so quickly change from old to young in that performance? Since you have such powers, when the emperor summons you, why not muddle through and admit it? It would be beneficial and bring no harm, and save my life. Isn’t that good?”

Zhang Guo laughed: “Oh, that Ye Fashan is truly despicable. If the emperor wants him to find me, and he dares not face me, so be it. But why scare others with such nonsense? Since he is so unreasonable, I must play a joke on him to show my foolish tricks. Leader, don’t worry. When I meet the emperor, all right and wrong will be my burden alone. You won’t be involved. Rest assured.”

The leader half-believed and prepared costumes and props, gathering the troupe to accompany Zhang Guo to the palace. At that moment, Elder Lang’s role was taken by Master Lü. Inside the palace, the emperor did not order a performance but summoned the leader and Elder Lang to meet him. He spoke kindly, repeatedly calling Zhang Guo an immortal and urging him to reveal his true form and accept the post of national teacher. When Elder Lang still denied it, the emperor’s face darkened with anger, and he ordered the leader arrested and imprisoned. The leader turned pale and prostrated himself, striking his head until it bled.

Master Lü could not help but chuckle inside and loudly asked: “Your Majesty, how do you know this humble one is Immortal Zhang?” The emperor said it was Ye Fashan who claimed so. Lü replied: “I wish to meet this sorcerer to ask him directly.” The emperor hesitated, for Fashan had begged repeatedly that his name not be revealed. To summon him now would betray trust. After a pause, the emperor laughed: “You need not meet the sorcerer; he rarely meets anyone.”

Lü bowed: “It is not that I must meet him, but after court today, I reflected on why Your Majesty mistakes me for Immortal Zhang. I will seek my master, Immortal Zhong. Zhong said: ‘To meet Immortal Zhang is not difficult, unless the sorcerer goes to Zhongnan Mountain himself.’ So it seems I am not Immortal Zhang. Immortal Zhang may be on Zhongnan, but the sorcerer must make the journey.” The emperor asked: “Why did you not say this before, only after ordering the leader’s arrest?” Lü answered: “I feared the sorcerer’s wrath and dared not act rashly. Now seeing Your Majesty’s thunderous authority, if I did not speak truthfully, it would offend the sacred heart and implicate the leader. The fault would be mine. How dare I harbor fear and invite disaster?” The emperor bowed and dismissed him. Soon he summoned Ye Fashan. Lü and others stood below the steps, watching the emperor point at him and say Elder Lang was not the true immortal, who dwells on Zhongnan and should be sought there. Fashan prostrated himself, speaking unknown words. The emperor’s face darkened and he left court in displeasure.

Returning to the Pear Garden, Lü laughed heartily and said to Zhang Guo: “Master uncle, now you can breathe freely. Tell Zhong and Zhang about this recent matter.” The two immortals laughed: “A clever trick. Early tomorrow, Ye Fashan will surely come to seek Elder Lang. You must deal with him, making him toil first. Then use this method to meet the emperor yourself, without needing his introduction, saving him from further credit-seeking.” Lü smiled in agreement.

The next morning, as predicted, Ye Fashan came to seek Elder Lang. Lü, disguised as the false old man, met him and asked his purpose. Fashan hesitated and said: “I dare not lie. I erred in haste, wrongly telling the emperor that the old man was Immortal Zhang. The emperor’s desire for talent is great, and he insists on finding Immortal Zhang at once. Yet the old man refuses to admit it, recommending I journey to Zhongnan Mountain. I do not speak further, but ask if you truly know whether Immortal Zhang is there. If so, I will gladly make the journey for the country’s sake. But if not, how can I report back? I come to humbly ask you, for the emperor’s sake, to speak honestly. Both I and His Majesty will be deeply grateful.”

Lü saw his evasive words and thought, “This fellow must be shown some power, or he thinks us fools.” Smiling, he said: “Sorcerer, you flatter me too much. Who am I to speak for the emperor? Even your arrival is beyond my honor. As for whether Immortal Zhang is on Zhongnan, I only heard my master say so in passing. My master has gone to Tiantai and may not return soon. I truly cannot inquire. I beg your forgiveness for my lack of words, and hope you understand.”

Fashan’s heart blazed with anger, thinking, “This old fellow is surely Zhang Guo himself, where else to find a second?” Yet he dared not say so and quietly asked: “Whether there is a true immortal on Zhongnan is not my concern. But if Immortal Zhang is there, will I be granted an audience? Please, on the emperor’s behalf, tell me plainly, and do not evade.” His face flushed with urgency and fear. Lü, seeing his stubbornness, wished to press him further but softened, smiling: “I said I have no connection to Zhang Immortal. Whether he grants an audience or not, I speak only truth. Your words may be somewhat improper, but I will not argue. Since you ask, I will faithfully report what I know. I once asked my master if the emperor sent envoys to invite Immortal Zhang, would he grant an audience? My master laughed: ‘Immortals value loyalty and filial piety, and hold saving others dear. If the emperor goes himself to Zhongnan, he will surely welcome him. If envoys go, it depends on their sincerity. If they show the slightest disrespect, cunning, or fail to speak honestly, even if they meet the immortal, they will not be received, and may be given a lesson.’” Hearing this, Fashan broke out in cold sweat but felt comforted, knowing that sincere approach would gain favor. He bowed and thanked Lü, then departed.

After a day, Fashan set out for Zhongnan, bearing the emperor’s letter of invitation. The journey took more than one day, through desolate and difficult terrain, crossing mountains and ridges. Though he had minor magic, he could neither ride clouds nor shrink the earth. He had to alternate between carriage, horse, and foot, sometimes missing inns or meals, enduring hunger and cold until dawn. If attacked by bandits or beasts, he fought for his life. Such hardship was rare even in his former cultivation days. Now, as a sorcerer and close imperial official, he suffered these trials without complaint, truly a calamity without cause.

Whether he met Zhang Guo at Zhongnan remains to be told in the next chapter.
