# Chapter Ninety-Three: Ye Fashan Reverently Visits Zhang Guolao; Lü Chunyang’s Three Trials of Bai Mudan

Now, it happened that Ye Fashan endured hardship and bitterness, braved hunger and thirst, journeyed countless roads, passed through many dangers, yet remained steadfast and sincere, never daring utter a word of complaint. At last, he arrived upon the slopes of Zhongnan Mountain.

At this time, Zhongli Quan had parted ways with the two immortals Lü and Zhang, setting off overseas to visit friends. He commanded the two immortals to remain in the capital, while he himself, on behalf of Zhang Guolao, took form as a daoist boy beneath Zhongnan Mountain, awaiting Fashan’s arrival.

Zhongli Quan busied himself gathering herbs, paying no heed to the visitor. Fashan, however, as if finding a priceless treasure, hurried forward and respectfully said, “Little brother, I humbly greet you.” Zhongli glanced back, still tending his work, muttering under his breath, “Where did this wild man come from? Only lived four or five decades, yet dares call me little brother? You’d better be my great-grandson, and that’s still a million years too soon.” Hearing this, Fashan was startled and said, “So you are a Daoist master. I, a humble daoist, have questions to ask; I beg your generous instruction.” Zhongli flung aside his tools and asked, “What do you want to ask? Has someone from the capital sent word to summon the Great Immortal Zhang?” Fashan was even more alarmed and quickly kowtowed, “Indeed! Your servant Ye Fashan comes by imperial edict, specially to invite the Great Immortal. I hope the Daoist master will kindly convey my message.” Zhongli said nothing, muttering again, “Had I known you’d be so respectful, you wouldn’t have suffered so many hardships. What a damned misfortune, wasting so much of my time.”

Fashan understood the boy’s sarcasm but dared not reply, standing respectfully aside, quietly awaiting his answer. Zhongli chuckled and said, “Foolish fellow, just go back. That man has long since become the imperial court’s national master. Why do you still linger here?” Fashan was stunned and said, “So the Great Immortal Zhang has already received the news and gone to the capital.” Zhongli spat and said, “What’s this ‘going to the capital’? What’s ‘first’ or ‘later’? Those great transcendent immortals of the Great Luo Heaven shine like sun and moon, present everywhere, one with Heaven and Earth, responsive and efficacious. If you say he’s in the capital, he’s no less here on this mountain; if you say he left first, perhaps he’s still behind you. This tiny universe—what great matter is it? You run about sweating like mad, thinking you’ve traveled a thousand li, but from the immortals’ view, no matter how far apart, it’s only a step or two. What’s the big deal? Go on, go on—I really have no time to bother with you.” Saying this, he turned back, gathered his tools, and resumed gathering herbs.

Fashan stood stunned a moment, then his mind filled with doubt, suspecting the boy might be Zhang Immortal himself. If he missed him face to face, it would be a laughingstock. What if the boy tricked him into setting out, but he did not truly go? Would that not be his ruin? Just then, the Daoist boy threw down his tools again and laughed heartily, “Let me tell you, your foolish thoughts have truly led you astray. Where in the world are there trickster immortals? Since you came with sincerity, the immortal has already seen your earnestness and granted your request, long ago in the palace. If you don’t believe me, rent a humble hut near this mountain and wait for the Great Immortal Zhang to retire and return home—surely there will be a day to see him.”

Hearing this, Fashan realized Zhang Guolao had never left the capital. This boy before him—whether a manifestation of Zhang or a friend—he could not tell. He only lamented his own shallow cultivation, unable to discern clearly. Zhongli laughed again, “Since you know your power is insufficient, why don’t you hurry back to cultivate? Yet you boast of your meager skills and pretend to be a master of the dao—what a joke!” Fashan, seeing how the boy seemed to peer into his very heart and liver, was deeply fearful and prostrated himself. Zhongli laughed once more, “I tell you to go and you won’t; I urge you to stay and cultivate, and you refuse; just chatter nonsense with me. Very well, I pity your long journey, your hardships and fright—you’ve suffered enough. Now I’ll send you back with a gust of wind.” With that, he opened his mouth and called out; suddenly a great wind rose, lifting Ye Fashan from the ground into the Nine Heavens, drifting and swaying like a kite cut loose, blown northward. Fashan was so frightened he shut his eyes tight, not daring move hand or foot. After a while, the wind seemed to still, and his body settled. Opening his eyes, he exclaimed, “What a strange thing! My body is on my own bed!” He hurriedly looked around—sure enough, it was his own residence. This startled him so he cried out loudly, rousing servants and women in the inner chambers, who all came to inquire. Seeing Fashan, each was dumbfounded, utterly at a loss.

Fashan’s wife, Lady Wang, first asked, “Ah, when did you come back? Why didn’t you enter from outside, nor even come inside to look around, but went straight to bed here?” Hearing this, Fashan closed his eyes again, recalling all the past scenes and the manner of his return, thinking it over thoroughly. Suddenly he rubbed his eyes and asked, “Were we not dreaming?” Lady Wang spat and said, “In broad daylight, what dream is there?” Her words made everyone laugh. Fashan steadied his mind and, speaking faintly, told everyone to leave except Lady Wang. He then related all that had happened.

Lady Wang understood better and laughed, “You’re supposed to be a man of the dao, yet you don’t see such simple truth. When one becomes a Great Luo Heaven Immortal, naturally one has boundless power and vast spiritual skill. From my view, all these events were but Zhang Immortal playing tricks on you. He was annoyed at your chatter and lack of respect, so made you suffer some hardship. Now seeing your sincere heart, the immortal would not treat you harshly, but sent you home with a gust of wind. In short, all those ‘foolish old men,’ ‘old fellows,’ ‘old fellows’ masters,’ and ‘daoist boys of Zhongnan’ were but Zhang’s own illusions. From start to finish, that’s the whole story. To be frank, it was just a joke played on you, chatterbox.” Fashan still doubted, but tidied his clothes and hurried into the palace. There he saw the emperor and an old daoist deeply discussing profound scriptures and secrets. Only then did he fully believe his wife’s words, which were indeed insightful.

The emperor, seeing him return, smiled and said, “You’ve labored hard on this journey.” Fashan knew the old daoist was Zhang Guolao, so he kowtowed and said, “Daoist Zhang has come. I nearly failed to return because of a single slip of the tongue. Greetings once more, Your Majesty.” The emperor laughed and asked what had happened. Fashan rose and saluted Zhang, smiling, “Your Majesty need not ask me about the details. Whatever has occurred lies all within this national master’s mind. Please ask him slowly.” Zhang also smiled, “Nonsense! Don’t you remember what your wife said to you?” From then on, Zhang Guolao was appointed by imperial edict to reside in the Academy of Learned Worthies, attending court daily. In leisure he was summoned to the palace to expound on the mysteries of the dao. At first, he earnestly wished the emperor would cultivate heart and virtue and become a sage ruler. Though calamities loomed, perhaps some might be averted. This emperor, Xuanzong, was diligent and benevolent early in his reign, the Kaiyuan era bringing prosperity comparable to the earlier Zhenguan.

Later, when the realm was peaceful and the people prosperous, the emperor grew arrogant, indulgent, and confused. After the era changed to Tianbao, he favored the concubine Yang Yuhuan and the favored minister An Lushan, who colluded to debauch the palace. Court officials formed factions and stirred unrest. Zhang Guolao, having served long, saw the troubles and knew the calamity was near. An Lushan was the old fox he had released beneath Tianping Mountain in a former life. His deeds exceeded all bounds. Knowing the chaos was inevitable and unable to save the realm, Zhang resolved not to linger in court. After one day’s audience, he expressed his wish to retire to Lü Zu.

Lü Zu, meanwhile, had recently experienced a most delightful affair. Hearing Zhang’s words, he laughed, “Master Uncle, you want to leave? I’ve found a lover just now, and things are going splendidly. How could I bear to leave the capital now?” Zhang laughed, “Immortals have lovers? You must be joking.” Lü Zu replied seriously, “Why shouldn’t immortals have lovers? If you have no pressing matters, come with me and see—my lover is truly a peerless beauty, worthy of my affection.” Zhang, intrigued by this sudden claim, said, “I’ll come along and see.” They prepared to leave together.

Lü Zu laughed, “Wait—such a fragrant, elegant place, dressed as we are, it’s hardly appropriate.” Zhang smiled, “So you don’t show your true face to others. No wonder you’re insincere—how can that be a lover?” This remark left Lü Zu speechless, and they both laughed. Lü Zu then transformed into a youthful scholar, while Zhang took the guise of a middle-aged merchant. The two left the Academy and walked through many bustling streets until they reached a grand courtyard. Lü Zu knocked on the door with his finger. A servant dressed plainly opened it, greeting Lü Zu as “Young Lord Wang,” wearing a broad smile and utmost respect. He also bowed to Zhang. Zhang laughed, “So you have some standing after all—too bad you became Young Lord Wang.” Lü Zu signaled him to say no more.

They entered, passing a large courtyard and a long corridor before reaching the main hall. Zhang quietly asked Lü what place this was. Lü whispered, “Master Uncle, better not ask now—you’ll see soon enough.” Zhang was puzzled. Soon many young women in splendid clothes appeared from behind the hall, all smiling and calling out, “Young Lord Wang!” Among them was one whose beauty surpassed the rest. Though slightly older, she possessed natural grace and charm, elegant and enchanting beyond ordinary women. Lü said to Zhang, “This is my lover, Bai Mudan.”

Hearing the name Bai Mudan and seeing the scene, Zhang realized Lü had brought him to a pleasure quarter. He struggled to suppress his laughter. Bai Mudan parted the crowd and approached, taking each immortal by one hand and leading them inside. Beyond the hall was a small flower chamber, flanked by curtains and fragrant embroidered rooms. Bai Mudan pulled them into the eastern chamber. Zhang looked up and saw the furnishings were exquisite. What caught his eye most was a small couplet hanging by the dressing table, signed “Hui Daoist.” He pointed at Lü and laughed heartily. Lü said, “What’s so funny? You’re too easily amazed.” Zhang replied, “I’m not laughing at anything else but your passion. Aren’t you afraid of falling into the Avici Hell?” Lü laughed, “Better to die beneath the peony flower and be a ghost with style. Since she’s called Bai Mudan, I’d rather die for her.” Zhang said nothing, but Bai Mudan would not let him speak thus. She stretched out slender jade fingers to cover his mouth, smiling, “When people speak, they hope for good fortune. I’ve never seen a young lord who talks only of death and dying. You’d die for me, but do you know I won’t die for you?”

The two immortals laughed heartily. Bai Mudan, seeing their laughter, feigned shyness and mild anger, clinging to Lü and teasing him. Lü hastily protested, “Good sister, I’m just joking with you—why be angry?” Zhang sat to one side, shaking his head and smiling, “This really is hard for you—to have such skill.” Lü said seriously, “That’s nothing. I’m going to invite you to a ‘kissing banquet.’ After that, I’ll let myself be wild tonight, and do some amorous deeds with this sister.” Zhang laughed, “Enough of this kissing banquet. Better you take care of others and leave me out—I’m an old man caught in the middle, don’t want to be disliked.” Lü laughed, “Master Uncle, you truly are a gentleman of the ancient dao. Since that’s so, I’ll invite other friends another day for a feast.”

They chatted and laughed a while longer. Zhang wished to leave, and Lü accompanied him back to the Academy. Zhang was greatly surprised by these events and knew Lü’s actions were no accident. He laughed and asked the reason. Lü then told him, “Regarding this woman, we are old companions. In a past life, she was called Little Jinzi, surname Zhu. Before I studied swordsmanship on Mount Lu, we had that connection. I once gave her a promise face to face. Now, by chance, we meet here again. After mastering the sword, the Great Immortal Maiden once teased me about it. At that time, my dao was shallow, and I took it as mere jest. Now I know a cultivator must not lightly promise others. Because of that one promise, I truly owe a karmic debt. Meanwhile, I came to the capital, and she reincarnated twice, ending in the pleasure quarter. Seeing her form, spirit, speech, and manner exactly as before, my heart was stirred, and I recalled the immortal maiden’s words. Calculating quietly, it must be so. This woman has great destiny and should be saved by me. So I intend to take advantage of this opportunity to elevate her, not wasting our past fate.”

Hearing this, Zhang suddenly understood and said, “I suspected you had some reason all along. So that’s the story. No wonder you became lovers.” Lü continued, “To be frank, I’ve already tested her twice. The first was to see her conscience. As a child, she had cruel means to hold her mother captive. Such a heart is unfit for human kindness. But then it was self-defense, so somewhat forgivable. I played along warmly. One day, I feigned a serious illness, about to die, to see her weep and seek doctors and diviners. She seemed truly sincere.”

Zhang laughed, “You were fooled. Such places have no true sincerity. Her crying and haste were just tricks to deceive.” Lü interrupted, shaking his head and smiling, “Master Uncle, you are too self-restrained. Such courtesan tricks only fool others. If even we immortals can be deceived, then… then…” Saying “then” twice, Zhang finished, “Then you’d become a courtesan among immortals.”

This made Lü laugh heartily. He added, “The second test was to try her courage—whether she had the resolve to risk her life. This test pleased me greatly. Next, I will conduct the third trial.” Zhang said, “This is neither immortal testing mortal nor young lord playing courtesan, but a state examination for talent. I worry for you—your method, though well intended, might be misunderstood by future generations, becoming distorted as ‘Lü Chunyang’s Three Theatrical Trials of Bai Mudan,’ turned into songs and dramas, with old women and children treating it as a scandalous immortal romance, passed down forever. Can you bear that?” Lü laughed, “Others won’t make such a fuss. Unless you, Master Uncle, want to tease me. With one word from you, the ‘three trials’ could become ‘three plays.’ Fortunately, I hold to practical benefit and personal integrity, caring only for a clear conscience, regardless of reputation. As for ‘romantic immortal,’ what a bad phrase! Immortals rarely have romance; how can a romantic person become immortal? Now I can be both immortal and romantic—wouldn’t that be the greatest tale since immortals began? I gladly accept this fine title.” Zhang laughed, “Very well, I’ll help you spread this romantic fame through the ages.” They laughed together.

Later, at a gathering of the Eight Immortals, Zhang told this story to all. Among them, Lan Caihe was most mischievous, and Han Xiangzi also playful, composing a fanciful immortal tale called “Lü Chunyang’s Three Theatrical Trials of Bai Mudan.” It portrayed Lü as the most rakish and unrestrained immortal. This was a jest by Han and Lan, but later generations believed it true. As Zhang said, “Turned into poetry and drama, known by women and children.” Lü’s romantic immortal image became famed. Yet the story’s details were clearly flawed. Among cultivators, such teasing is harmless, but if spread among ordinary people, it is disrespectful and laughed at by Daoists. Therefore, later some claimed the “Three Theatrical Trials of Bai Mudan” concerned another Lü Dongbin, unrelated to Lü Chunyang, to correct the record.

This explanation is well meant and not to be blamed, but not a fundamental correction. The author of this book, after examining many secret texts, found the story of the three trials and understood the cause of the mistaken “three plays.” Hence this detailed account, so that from now on no more disrespectful falsehoods will spread.

Returning to Lü, he told Zhang about the two trials of Bai Mudan. Zhang asked about the third trial. Lü laughed, “Such matters arise spontaneously; there is no fixed method. Now I want to ask you, Master Uncle, how to leave the court and return to the mountains?” Zhang sighed, “Since I entered court as the imperial national master, more than twenty years have passed in the mortal world. I see the emperor growing more debauched daily. He invited me here, but beyond a few empty talks of the dao, it’s all a game and a joke. Worse, that fox reborn as An Lushan has defiled the palace and done many shameful deeds. The emperor is blind and treats him like a godson. Such shameful things I cannot endure. My heart wishes to execute him at once. I ask how he preached before, how he became so wanton upon entering the world? But since he was born for this calamity, how can I manage him? Fortunately, I plan to leave soon—better to go quietly and cleanly. Nephew, what do you think?” Lü, with a flash of insight, laughed, “Master Uncle, have you calculated when you can return to the mountains?” Zhang said, “Not yet.” Lü laughed, “I have calculated for you—within three to five days you will leave court. But you must take a disciple back with you. Keep this secret, and it will come true soon.” Zhang said nothing.

How Lü would conduct the third trial of Bai Mudan, and when Zhang would return to the mountains, we shall see in the next chapter.
