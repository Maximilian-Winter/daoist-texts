# Chapter Ninety-Four: The Paper Donkey’s Marvelous Spirit Appears; Master Lü Redeems the Worldling’s Debts

Now it happened that after Emperor Tang Minghuang himself earnestly invited the Great Immortal Zhang Guo to serve as the nation’s master, at first he sincerely sought instruction in the profound dao of the celestial gate. But in time, beguiled by wine and women, he grew negligent even of state affairs, no longer caring to cultivate the path of immortality. Yet because Immortal Zhang displayed many wondrous and sacred marvels, whenever the emperor was in high spirits, he would summon him to perform some playful feats.

Once, the emperor noticed that the donkey ridden by Immortal Zhang was extraordinarily spirited and swift. Each time Zhang set out, he would ride it backward, which seemed quite strange. The emperor specially invited him to enter the palace riding the donkey backward, to take a gallop through the imperial garden. Zhang, whose heart was loyal and filial, always held reverence for the Son of Heaven, never daring to disobey imperial command. So at once, by imperial decree, he entered the garden, riding the donkey backward, making a wide circuit. The donkey itself was remarkable—it required no guidance to turn, but followed the will of Zhang’s mind, sometimes quickening, sometimes slowing, running the course without error.

After a while, the emperor summoned him into the palace to grant a banquet, ordering the donkey to be tied within the garden and fed. Zhang humbly said, “My donkey never eats; at most, a cup of water suffices.” The emperor consented and commanded the attendants to bring water for the donkey. Meanwhile, the banquet was prepared for Zhang and the emperor to drink together.

After some conversation, the emperor excused himself, ordering the ministers to join the feast, but he quietly slipped away to observe the donkey. The attendants reported that the donkey drank a cup of clear water, then refused more. The emperor then commanded that it be given wine. A large jar of aged wine was brought, and the donkey took a sip, sensing a strange flavor, and refused to drink further. The emperor grew angry: “If it won’t drink wine, then cut it down!” But before the attendants could force it, the donkey lifted its head, held the jar with its two forelegs, and with a gurgling sound, drained the entire jar of fine wine in one gulp. Immediately it knelt, raised its forelegs, and made a gesture of bowing to the emperor in thanks.

The emperor was greatly pleased and about to reward it with words, when suddenly the donkey’s drunkenness took hold. Its body grew limp and languid, and it collapsed sideways. The attendants urged it to rise, but it would not move; they kicked it, but it remained still, the sound of the kick like striking paperboard.

The emperor was astonished and stepped forward, kicking twice more, each time hearing the same hollow sound as if striking something made of paper. He could not help but laugh at the oddity. Looking again, the donkey lay stretched out on the ground, its eyes rolled back, breath utterly gone—it had reached the end of its lifespan and returned to Heaven.

At this, the emperor grew uneasy and asked, “Look carefully—can it be saved? If not, bury it quickly. When the old daoist comes to inquire, say it ran away. Do not reveal the truth, lest he think us mere children playing tricks.” Before he finished speaking, an attendant pulled the donkey up by one hand, exclaiming in a strange voice, “This donkey is fake—it is a paper donkey!” The emperor was startled, looked closely, and indeed it was a donkey made of paper.

He laughed heartily: “This old daoist is truly clever, tricking us with a paper donkey. Had we not poured that jar of fine wine down its throat, we might have fallen for it. Take this donkey with us; I will go ask the old daoist about it.” So the emperor led the way, attendants behind, dragging the paper donkey to Zhang’s side.

The emperor laughed and said, “Old daoist, you are quite the trickster—how did you bring a paper donkey riding into my palace?” Zhang hurriedly prostrated and replied, “The donkey I ride is indeed paper, but through my humble skill, I pass it off as a real donkey. When Your Majesty made it drink wine, the truth was revealed. It is like the worldly saying of the paper tiger—appearing real, it may deceive for a time, but cannot endure long. Thus, in all things under Heaven, only the genuine is truly precious. Falsehoods are not worth speaking of.”

The emperor smiled: “You are skilled in satire. Tell me, can a paper tiger be made to move as well?” Zhang replied, “It all depends on a bit of dao method. What difference is there between a tiger and a donkey?” The emperor ordered a paper tiger to be made for Zhang to try. Zhang said, “No need to make one; simply take a sheet of white paper, add incantations, and it will become a tiger.” The emperor was delighted and ordered a demonstration.

Zhang took a sheet of paper, crumpled it in his hand, muttering spells. Then with a flick of his hand and a shout, a striped, fierce tiger appeared, baring teeth and brandishing claws, leaping beneath the hall. The emperor feared it might attack and quickly asked if the tiger could harm people. Zhang said, “If a paper donkey can walk, how could a paper tiger not harm?” The emperor, afraid, said, “Your dao is profound and your spirit vast—truly admirable! Now please put away this paper tiger before its wild nature causes harm.” Zhang said, “With me here, what fear is there of a false tiger causing trouble?” Saying so, he waved his hand, and the paper tiger collapsed. The emperor and ministers saw clearly that though the tiger was dead, it still retained its shape. Zhang said it had reverted to a lump of white paper. Only Master Ye could discern that it was but a small paper bundle.

Zhang smiled, took it back, gently spread it open, and it fully returned to a sheet of white paper.

On another occasion, the emperor heard that Zhang had a great capacity for wine and wished to get him drunk. He secretly placed medicine in the wine and ordered Zhang to drink ten jars full. Zhang knelt and said, “My wine capacity is small; drinking too much would cause loss of decorum. If Your Majesty grants me a single drunkenness, I have a disciple who can drink in my stead. If it pleases you, I will summon him for your inspection.” The emperor asked where the disciple was. Zhang waved his hand to the sky, and with a thunderous sound, a handsome young daoist flew down from a palace corner like a falling bird.

The emperor was delighted, asked him several questions, and the boy answered calmly and with refined manners. The emperor greatly favored him and ordered wine to be served. The boy drank ten jars in one breath, showing no sign of drunkenness. Another ten goblets were given, which he also drained in one go. The emperor laughed: “Bring the large jars of palace wine from the harem—let us see if he can finish them all.” Zhang hurriedly knelt and said, “Do not grant more. If given more, he will surely become drunk and lose decorum. This was only to amuse Your Majesty. Losing decorum would be disorderly and contrary to my humble intent to entertain you.”

The emperor would not relent and ordered more wine. Suddenly, the boy collapsed backward onto the ground. Zhang hurriedly said, “This child knows no rules. Only Your Majesty’s forgiveness can save him.” While speaking, he quickly covered the boy with a cloth. After a while, the attendants reported that a large jar of palace wine had vanished. The emperor was angry: “The palace is a heavily guarded place—how can things go missing? Investigate thoroughly!” Zhang knelt and said, “Please calm Your Majesty; the jar is under my cloth.” The emperor was astonished and ordered the cloth lifted. There was no boy, only the jar of wine standing there. Pouring it out and measuring, the twenty jars the boy had drunk were all there, not a drop missing. The emperor laughed heartily.

On another occasion, the emperor said to Gao Lishi, “I have heard that only immortals can drink arsenic without bitterness.” Gao Lishi joked, “Have Zhang Guo try it.” The emperor ordered arsenic mixed with wine to be given to Zhang. Zhang drank it all and soon felt tipsy, saying, “What kind of wine is this? It has a strange flavor.” Seeing him intoxicated, the emperor ordered a couch set up in the palace and attendants to help him to sleep. The next day, his teeth had turned black. Zhang smiled, raised his ruyi scepter, and with a gentle wipe, they instantly returned to pure white.

Once more, while hunting with the emperor, they caught a large deer. The emperor ordered it cooked to accompany the wine. Zhang said, “This is a celestial deer, aged a thousand years. Long ago, in the fifth year of the Yuanshou era of Emperor Wu of Han, he caught it hunting in Shanglin Park. Unexpectedly, it still lives among men today.” The emperor laughed, “What proof do you have?” Zhang said, “Emperor Wu released it, hanging a small copper plaque on its left antler.” The emperor ordered it examined, and indeed a two-inch copper plaque was found, though the inscription was blurred beyond reading. The emperor then ordered another plaque hung on the right antler and released it again. He praised Zhang’s vast learning all the more.

Zhang served at court for over twenty years, seeing that the emperor regarded him merely as a plaything to amuse himself, caring nothing for political gains or the suffering of the people. Several times he sought to leave. The emperor earnestly tried to keep him, unwilling to let him go. Zhang, among the Eight Immortals, was the most reserved. Seeing the emperor’s treatment, he dared not insist on leaving, nor could he bear to depart without farewell.

At this time, Master Lü still dwelled with him, never leaving day or night. Zhang told Lü of his difficulties. Since their outing to the pleasure quarters, Zhang had again raised the matter of returning to the mountains. Lü calculated and said Zhang had only a few days left of worldly ties. Once these were fulfilled, he could follow his will and also gain a good disciple. Hearing this, Zhang ceased to calculate his future.

Yet the emperor, having seen Zhang manifest many spiritual marvels, long wished to know his origin. Asking repeatedly, Zhang would not answer truthfully. His intention was to avoid frightening or scandalizing others by revealing his true nature—not out of shame for his origins, but to avoid gossip. The emperor, unable to get the truth, confided in Master Ye Fashan, who at first refused to speak.

The emperor, wishing to provoke him, said, “You are a dharma master who introduced Zhang Guo—how could you not know his origin? It seems you are a master in name only, with no real dao skill.” Fashan blushed deeply and, growing agitated, said, “How could I not know Master Zhang? But I fear if he knew I spoke, he would put me to death. Would Your Majesty intercede for me, asking him not to punish me?” The emperor laughed, “What you say is heard by me alone. How would Master Zhang know?” Fashan said, “Your Majesty underestimates Master Zhang. He is a golden immortal of great standing. Every word and deed of ours he knows without others telling him.”

The emperor said, “Speak boldly. If Master Zhang opposes you, I will protect you.” Fashan then began to tell how, in the time of chaos, a mouse strove diligently in cultivation, transforming into a bat, then into a human body, and finally achieving the immortal dao. He told the story in full detail. The emperor listened with great interest, until suddenly Fashan cried out, spat blood, and collapsed, crying, “Master Zhang, spare me! Master Zhang, forgive me!” The emperor was shocked and hastened to plead for him, ordering attendants to support Fashan and kowtow to the empty air. The bleeding ceased, but his body ached bitterly. His wife, capable and wise, urged him to see Zhang, confess his fault, and beseech him as master to teach the dao. Thus he might gain mercy, preserve his life, and have hope for immortality.

Hearing this, Fashan awakened to understanding. Supporting his weak body, he sought Zhang and, following his wife’s instructions, earnestly begged. Zhang saw his sincerity. Moreover, since Fashan had served as national master with integrity and no wrongdoing, and Zhang admired his cleverness and potential, he agreed to accept him as disciple.

From the day Fashan revealed his origin, the emperor feared Zhang’s displeasure and did not summon him for several days. Lü laughed and said to Zhang, “My words have come true. Master, this is a perfect opportunity to leave. Why do you not go?” Zhang smiled, “Every day and hour I wish to go. First, I wait for you to finish the White Peony matter; second, I have not yet decided on the method of departure.” Lü laughed, “I tell you, the examiner has finished his work and awaits your honorable departure. We will leave the capital at once.”

Zhang laughed, “Why so swift? You should first tell me the exam questions, then show me her written answers, so I can judge if the examiner is biased.” Lü laughed, “That is an easy matter. Since that day I told you about White Peony’s origin, I went to her home and chatted about trivial matters. She seemed uninterested but humored me. That night we shared a bed. Suddenly she spoke of her fading youth and beauty, lamenting that the pleasure quarters were no place for long affection. She wept bitterly. I then encouraged her, saying, ‘I will help you leap out of the fire pit and marry a young nobleman, rich and attentive. After a few years of splendor, when the end comes and your eyes close, you will rot with the grass and trees—what joy is there in that?’ She seemed deeply moved.

Half the night, I watched her tossing and sighing, not knowing her thoughts. I feigned sleep and ignored her. Unexpectedly, she suddenly lifted me, shaking me desperately. Pretending to wake, I asked what was wrong. Her words amazed and delighted me. She had been moved by my talk and suddenly turned her heart to cultivation. Because I knew many immortals, she asked where to find them, wishing to become their disciple, abandoning the red dust forever. Seeing her sudden awakening, how could I not be astonished and pleased? I gave her some casual words and a small pillow, telling her to rest as usual.

When she awoke before dawn, she wept and knelt by the bed, calling me master and begging to leave the red dust. She said in her dream she had experienced all the hardships and splendors of life and found no joy in worldly matters. Her resolve to cultivate was firm. Most remarkable was that she sensed my pillow was somewhat numinous and recalled my teachings, concluding I was an immortal sent to save her. Such wisdom is extraordinary. At this point, I pitied her sincerity and plight and agreed to take her as disciple, telling her of her past life and origins.

The next day, using dao method, I sent her out of the pleasure quarters. A gust of wind swept her from the capital, bidding her walk to Mount Zhongnan. Now she may have arrived, with no regrets. If she is sincere and diligent, unafraid of hardship, when she reaches Zhongnan, I will have other arrangements to nurture her. Perhaps five hundred years hence, she will be touched by creation.” Zhang laughed, “This is but fulfilling human kindness. In truth, since she has such awakening and a good master like you, she will surely become immortal. Why must she endure three trials and then a final great test?” Lü laughed heartily, “Your reasoning is sound. But an ordinary woman, lucky to meet us, with a single thought of wisdom, becoming immortal without some danger and hardship, would be too easy for her.” Zhang laughed, “Do you not remember the times we shared bed and pillow?” Lü laughed again without end.

After some talk, Zhang again discussed how to depart. Lü whispered, “Thus, not a trace will remain.” Zhang clapped his hands, praising the plan.

After a day, the emperor, noting Zhang had not attended court for three days, grew suspicious, fearing displeasure or departure. He sent four attendants with an imperial edict and many rare delicacies. But Zhang was gravely ill. When the attendants arrived, the servants reported the national master was too sick to receive the decree. The attendants left the gifts and returned to report to the emperor.

The emperor was greatly alarmed and asked Master Ye, “Do immortals also fall ill?” By then Ye Fashan had become Zhang’s disciple and understood his master’s intent. He replied, “Immortals are like ordinary people and naturally can fall ill.” The emperor prepared to send imperial physicians, when suddenly a report came that the national master had passed away.

The emperor was greatly shocked and, with Ye Fashan and others, came to the Jixian Institute to pay respects. But the officials there petitioned to return the emperor, saying, “After the national master’s death, his body has rotted and stinks terribly. It would harm the sacred person to view it. We beg to cease the mourning.” The emperor grew more suspicious, saying, “Even common people do not rot so quickly after death. How much less an immortal body? How could it decay so easily?” He ordered the dharma masters to offer sacrifices on his behalf and to watch carefully whether the national master was truly dead or feigning illness to return secretly to the dao mountains. If the truth was found, report it to me.

Having said this, the emperor returned to the palace. Ye Fashan and the officials remained to handle Zhang’s funeral. After the coffin was sealed and carried out, the bearers said it was as heavy as that of an ordinary person. The emperor, hearing this, believed Zhang was truly dead.

Later, during the An-Shi Rebellion, the emperor fled to Shu. On the way, he personally saw an immortal descend from Heaven, bow thrice, and vanish in an instant. The visitor presented a jade box sealed with a letter inside. Opening it, the emperor read a detailed account of the rebellion’s causes and effects, and a message that the emperor would soon return to the capital, urging him to cherish his dragon body. Enclosed was the jade ruyi scepter once granted by the emperor, without signature. The emperor suspected the immortal was sent by Zhang Guo, thus Zhang was not dead and there was no doubt.

Upon returning, he ordered the coffin opened, only to find a buried bamboo staff.

Where Zhang Guo went after faking his death, and what marvels followed, remain to be told in the next chapter.
