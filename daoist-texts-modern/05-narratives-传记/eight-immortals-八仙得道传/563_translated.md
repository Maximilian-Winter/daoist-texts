# Chapter Ninety-Five: The Attack on Heterodoxy by Lord Wen and the Descent of Rain—Xiangzi Reveals Divine Powers

Now it happened that Han Xiangzi was born into the Han household, and in the blink of an eye, he was already more than ten years old. When he was but five years of age, his father Han Huijian perceived his extraordinary intelligence and said to his brother Han Yu, “This child Xiangzi has a fine natural endowment; it seems he is destined for greatness. We must invite a worthy master to teach him the classics.” Hearing this, Han Yu carefully searched far and wide, successively engaging several renowned scholars, each assigned exclusively to instruct Xiangzi.

Yet, Xiangzi was born with a predestined wisdom. No matter what scripture he encountered, it could not withstand his gaze. Once his eyes fell upon it, he not only read aloud with clarity but required no teacher’s explanation, intuitively grasping the profound and subtle principles within. In places where even the masters declared the text difficult and obscure, Xiangzi would cite classics, draw from diverse sources, and expound with unerring reasoning the great dao, leaving the teachers humbled and admiring. After one year of instruction, he refused to continue with the same master the following year. Thus, by the time Xiangzi was twelve, he had already changed four or five famed teachers.

That winter, as another teacher resigned, no master within hundreds of miles dared to accept the challenge. Even those esteemed scholars who prided themselves on their learning feared being outmatched by this prodigy, worried that their lifelong reputation might be undone. After much seeking, not a single worthy teacher could be found. Han Huijian could not help but smile at Han Yu, saying, “It seems that the so-called masters of this age are no better than this. How is it that each one fails before a mere child?”

Han Yu replied gravely, “Brother, do not speak so. A child’s cleverness is but superficial; he may stumble upon a few ancient errors and not know right from wrong. You should not regard him as so extraordinary. As for those masters we engaged before, I know them well; they are truly learned men with great skill. Their talents may not match Xiangzi’s brilliance, but in terms of genuine scholarship and deep study—say, decades of burning the midnight oil—they are not comparable to a child’s few years of half-understanding. They resigned either because their spirits waned and they feared misleading the boy, or because Xiangzi’s pride made him difficult to teach. Out of respect for us, they did not speak frankly and parted on polite terms. Brother, how can you so deeply believe that Xiangzi surpasses these masters? Be careful not to let the boy overhear such praise. Youth is naturally reckless; if he hears his father so extol him, how can he not grow arrogant and lofty? At this rate, brother, I fear his cleverness will bring no benefit. As Mencius said, a vessel formed for greatness is not a child’s fortune but may well be a calamity for the Han family.” Han Huijian fell silent.

As the third winter waned and spring approached, Xiangzi stood at a crucial stage in his studies. Yet not a single teacher could be found. The brothers often spoke of this dilemma with great difficulty. Then, at the end of the twelfth lunar month, a young man suddenly arrived, presenting a card requesting an audience with the two gentlemen. The elder brothers saw the name “Lü Gupeng” on the card. They looked at each other and said, “We have no such acquaintance.” They tidied their robes and went out to meet him. The man was not yet thirty, his face like polished jade, lips as if painted vermilion, handsome and extraordinary, with an air of refinement and distinction. The two brothers were astonished, feeling that in all their years in the world, they had never seen such a graceful figure. Their hearts stirred, and their faces unconsciously showed deep admiration.

In conversation, they learned he was a scholar who had failed the imperial examinations but was confident in his knowledge of Heaven and humanity. Having given up on officialdom, he devoted himself to teaching family traditions. Hearing that the young master of the Han household was truly gifted and that many masters had declined the challenge, he humbly offered himself. “Though unworthy,” he said, “I believe such an extraordinary talent must one day transcend the mundane. Only with a proper teacher can he progress boundlessly and become a true daoist. I dare to recommend myself as a humble servant. Let the young master meet me first; if I fail to earn his trust, I shall withdraw immediately, not repeating the mistakes of previous teachers.” The brothers found his voice clear and his bearing exceptional, sensing he was no ordinary man. They spoke with him courteously and summoned Xiangzi to meet Lü Gupeng.

Han Huijian feared that Xiangzi might be too proud, thinking, “Several learned scholars have already been confounded by my son; how will he fare before such a young man? If he were to speak arrogantly, it would be most improper.” Yet when Xiangzi met Gupeng, he first appraised him quietly, then stepped forward with a smile, bowed deeply—unconsciously knocking his head several times—and said, “This is truly my master.”

The elder brothers were greatly surprised and laughed, saying to Gupeng, “This child is clever but stubborn. He has never shown such sincere respect to any of the masters before.” Gupeng smiled and replied, “A free spirit requires a special method of teaching. Perhaps the previous masters, though learned, had never taught such a uniquely gifted student. They treated him as an ordinary pupil, applying the same methods, so it is no wonder they clashed.” Han Huijian, having invited Gupeng partly to test Xiangzi’s learning, now saw how the two conversed freely. Xiangzi considered his own knowledge shallow, but under Gupeng’s guidance, he realized his understanding was mere surface. The profound principles Gupeng revealed had never been mentioned by former teachers. His heart opened, and with a joyful smile he said, “See? Did I not say this man is my true master? His teachings are so plain and natural, yet I cannot utter a single word in reply. This shows the genuine skill of a master.”

Han Yu, who had feared Xiangzi’s cleverness would lead him to superficial understanding and overconfidence, was pleased that Gupeng had taught him the difficulty of study, so he would no longer deceive himself with half-knowledge. They agreed to keep Gupeng at the Han household, where he taught for three years. Xiangzi’s learning advanced swiftly, and his character grew more humble and proper. By then Han Huijian had passed away. Han Yu admired the teacher deeply but soon discovered something that displeased him greatly.

Since studying under Gupeng, Xiangzi had become devoted to Daoist texts, often speaking of meditation, internal alchemy, the Golden Elixir, and the great dao. This enraged Han Yu, who prided himself on Confucian orthodoxy and the transmission of the Way. Seeing his family’s sons and nephews drawn into heterodox teachings, how could he accept it? But he only realized this after three years.

According to Xiangzi, he had planted a spiritual seed firmly in the Daoist path and was about to leave home to cultivate the Way. Han Yu flew into a rage, seizing a large staff, and demanded to know who had taught him such doctrines. Was it the teacher Lü Gupeng? Xiangzi, unafraid, replied solemnly, “The Three Teachings are all sacred ways. How can you say Confucianism and Buddhism are necessarily heresies? Uncle, you slander Buddhism and Daoism because you see only the monks and Daoists of the world, who do evil and cheat for money, ignorant of true principles. But these are the thieves of the two teachings, rejected not only by Confucianism but also by true Buddhists and Daoists. If you calmly study the subtle doctrines and mysterious scriptures of the two teachings, you will find truths that even Confucianism cannot reach.”

Han Yu slammed the table, cursing Xiangzi as unfilial and barbaric, a beast without lord or father. “This is all the work of that Lü Gupeng and his pernicious books. At first, I was suspicious when he volunteered himself, unbidden, from ancient times there has been no such self-deprecating master. And you, this slave, have driven away many good teachers with your arrogance, leaving only this man, whose background we do not know, who once served as a foreign guest in some household. Foolishly, we kept him for three years. It is my fault, distracted by state affairs, that I did not investigate your studies. Yet you have fallen so far, step by step into error. Though the teacher bears responsibility, your stubborn and unruly temper has offended many upright masters. And you admire and obey these heterodox teachings. It is clear that you yourself are at fault. From now on, if you wish to be a son of the Han house, you must obey my instructions, abandon these heterodox studies entirely, never speak of them, nor even think of them. Apply yourself to proper study; you are still young and have time to pursue official rank. With your talent, three more years of diligent effort will suffice. Otherwise, the Han family does not deserve such a descendant. Not only is our household unworthy, but all under Heaven has no place for such a heretic.”

Xiangzi smiled faintly and said, “Uncle, you regard Daoism so poorly and treat me as if I were a most heinous sinner? Honestly, though you look down on me, I follow my master’s instructions. I know you were once the General Chonghezi, punished and demoted from the Jade Emperor’s palace. If I am to attain the dao, I must first save you, then ascend to Heaven and receive office. Do you know who my master is? I doubt you, devoted as you are to Confucius, know the great immortals of Daoism. But I must tell you: my current master is the most renowned and respected figure in the Daoist tradition, comparable to the great sages of Confucius’ school—Yan, Zeng, Meng, and Xun. His surname is Lü, given name Yan, styled Dongbin. Gupeng is a secret name of Dongbin. Uncle, this Lü master is truly a great Golden Immortal of the celestial realms!”

Xiangzi was about to recount Lü Zu’s origins, his cultivation, attainment, and the three years of teaching between master and disciple. But upon hearing these words, Han Yu covered his ears and cried out, “He’s mad! He’s mad!” Slamming the desk loudly, he ordered the summons of the master. Xiangzi, seeing his uncle’s fury, could not help but laugh and said, “Uncle, do not be impatient. My master has long foreseen our parting today. If you send for him now, it will surely be too late.” Han Yu did not believe him and urged the servants to hurry to the study; if the master were present, he must be brought at once. The servants agreed and went, but the study boy suddenly came running, colliding with the servants. Han Yu angrily asked what he was doing.

The boy hurried forward and presented a letter left by Master Lü as a farewell to Han Yu. Han Yu, puzzled, hastily opened it. It said roughly: “Your nephew was once a Golden Immortal in Heaven. Due to a dereliction of duty, he was demoted to the banks of the Xiang River. Originally, his immortal form was that of a white crane, which he still retains. When his term ends, he and his master Zhongli Yunfang will jointly receive him back into the fold. Thus, he is sent again to the mortal world to cultivate and ultimately transcend, returning to his true nature. Your own past life, Han Yu, is as your nephew has said. He was born with innate wisdom and cultivates with ease. In three years, he has grasped profound principles. Now he must leave home and hasten to famous mountains for nurture. In twenty years, he will achieve minor success; in thirty, he will personally guide you to attain the dao.” The letter ended with farewell words.

Han Yu, seeing the letter, was speechless with anger. He tore it to shreds, but strangely, the paper reassembled itself as before. Alarmed and enraged, he cursed, “This demon dares to toy with my nephew and me!” He ordered the servants to burn the letter. They obeyed, setting fire. Flames roared, paper turned to ash, and ashes scattered. Yet in an instant, a single sheet lay flat and intact on the desk.

Han Yu looked up to Heaven and sighed, “Demons at work—this is my own lack of virtue and ability, the misfortune of the Han family. Such a fine nephew, led astray by spirits. Now, I ask you, slave, what do you intend? If you truly believe in demons and will enter heterodoxy, spreading poison in the Central Plains, it is better to send you away early. I dare not keep you at home as a sinner against the orthodox teaching and a traitor to our ancestors, nor do I wish to have you punished by officials or driven beyond the borders. Since you have an immortal master and plan to become a recluse, I leave it to you. But if you still hold respect for me, your uncle, and your parents and ancestors, you should heed my admonition, set your heart aright, clear your mind, cease these heterodox talks and deeds, and study the sages’ scriptures properly. Then you will be a good son of the Han, a loyal subject of enlightened China. Passing the examinations and bringing honor to your ancestors will be but a small matter. I hope you can assist me in this great cause of upholding the sage and defending the Way. Choose rightly for yourself.” Having said this, he left the letter untouched and stormed out.

That night, Xiangzi composed a long letter expressing his resolve to cultivate the dao and hoping that his uncle would soon return before calamity befell him. The letter was heartfelt and sincere. After placing it in the study, he quietly left home and went to cultivate on Mount Song.

Meanwhile, Han Yu, after scolding Xiangzi, returned to the inner chambers, still fuming. His wife asked the cause, and Han Yu recounted the matter. She could not help but complain, “Since your elder brother’s death, this only son of the main branch is cherished like a treasure. When your elder brother once scolded him, his mother wept and made a fuss. Now you have scolded him so harshly. The boy is somewhat slow; in these two years, he has been inseparable from that Master Lü, very close. Whenever he returns from study, he speaks of his master as a great Golden Immortal, with marvelous powers and vast knowledge. He says that with his studies, he too will surely become an immortal. He also says that though you have merit in Confucianism, in a past life you were an immortal official in the Lingxiao Palace and will eventually return to the Dao. Then he will lead you to the Way. We have heard such talk for a long time. Everyone thought it childish and paid no heed. But this year, he has done many strange things: rising into the air, roaming among clouds and mist; diving into the earth and vanishing instantly. They say these are teachings from his master. But these are mere tricks of immortals, not truly related to the study of life and death, or the Golden Elixir and the great dao…”

At this point, Han Yu grew even more anxious, stamping and slapping the table, scolding his wife for hiding the matter and fostering the boy’s bad habits. His scolding silenced her attempts to reason. Han Yu thought, “The boy is still young; after this lesson and with his master gone, I must exert myself to discipline him well.” After some thought, he left for official business. Soon, news came that Xiangzi had become a recluse, which chilled him with fear. He hurried home, where the household was in uproar.

Han Yu had become the family scapegoat, a great Confucian scholar of eight generations, subjected to ridicule and despair, powerless to act. From then on, the Han family was often engulfed in sorrow and distress.

Three years later, Xiangzi sent a letter home through a villager, which somewhat lifted the heavy clouds. Over ten years later, Xiangzi received from Master Yunfang the book *Heavenly Gang’s Beautiful Collection*. After five years of study and refinement, he grasped its essence. At that time, Master Lü descended upon Mount Song and commanded him to return to the capital to enlighten his uncle. Xiangzi donned Daoist robes, mounted a cloud, and arrived at the capital, paying respects to his mother Madam Xu. She saw him as a living treasure fallen from Heaven. Xiangzi knelt and presented elixirs to his mother and aunt. Both ladies, now over fifty and frail, took the pills and felt their spirits revived, better than in youth.

Xiangzi met his uncle Han Yu, who still bore a stern demeanor and asked what he had learned outside. Xiangzi replied briefly. Han Yu flew into a rage and ordered his Daoist robes stripped off. Xiangzi did not resist as they tried to remove the robes, but the garment seemed to grow from his skin, clinging tightly. After much effort, even the ties could not be undone. Amid the commotion, a royal edict arrived: the Emperor, facing drought and suffering people, ordered Han Yu to go to the altars of soil and grain to pray for rain. Han Yu dared not delay, dressed formally, and went forth.

Xiangzi smiled to his mother and aunt, saying, “Uncle prays for rain, but even if he prays for three or five years, not a drop will fall.” Aunt and mother trusted his Daoist methods and said, “Good nephew, if so, you should help your uncle perform some merit, so he may believe in your dao and cease opposing you.” Xiangzi shook his head and smiled, “Helping my uncle is my duty. But to have him believe in the dao—that will take at least ten or eight years.” Saying this, he turned and vanished.

At the altar, Han Yu prayed earnestly from morning till noon, yet no rain fell, nor did a single dark cloud appear. The blazing sun scorched the earth. Growing anxious, he saw a shabby Daoist approach, standing below the altar, grinning mockingly. Han Yu, displeased, ordered the Daoist seized. The guards complied, bringing the man to the altar. Han Yu asked why he laughed.

The Daoist replied, “I laugh not at other things, but at you, sir, who hold office yet have not learned the art of rain-making. Is that not laughable?” Han Yu roared, “Where do you come from, wild Daoist, to mock me openly? If you speak boldly, can you then produce rain?” The Daoist answered proudly, “If I cannot, how dare I mock you?” Han Yu commanded him to try, threatening execution if he failed.

The Daoist smiled, making no petitions or talismans, but brandished a precious sword and pointed, calling out several times, “Where are the gods of thunder and lightning?” Suddenly, a voice from midair asked, “The dharma master is summoned; what is your command?”

All eyes looked up and saw Lord of Thunder and Mother of Lightning, leading many celestial gods and generals, standing on the clouds, bowing to the Daoist. The crowd was terrified and knelt, heads pounding the ground like mortar pestles. Some bowed to the Daoist, calling him Great Immortal. Han Yu’s face darkened with shame and fury. He pointed and cursed, “Bold wild Daoist, I command you to bring rain; how dare you use sorcery to deceive and stir the people?”

Unperturbed, the Daoist said to the clouds, “This drought is severe. Chonghezi is here by imperial decree to pray for rain. But his worldly thoughts are too heavy; Heaven withholds the sweet dew. After half a day’s prayer, not a drop has fallen. I, the poor Daoist, cannot bear the people’s suffering. I have borrowed a ladle of water from the Dragon King of the Eastern Sea to share with the people. I ask the honored gods to swiftly spread clouds and rain. I will now release the water.”

Han Yu wanted to argue, but suddenly a great thunderclap roared, followed by lightning. Dark clouds thickened; the sky darkened, the sun’s light vanished. Golden serpents of lightning flickered wildly, dazzling all eyes. The crowd cried out, “The true immortal grants rain; the people are fortunate.” Even Han Yu, stubborn and proud, was dumbfounded.

Then another thunderclap shook the heavens. The Daoist leapt into the air, holding a small vial, scattering droplets to the four directions. Instantly, a torrential downpour fell, unstoppable. The crowd took shelter beneath the altar, pressing so tightly the pillars nearly broke. After a meal’s time, the Daoist called from the sky, “People, if you think the rain is enough, say so, lest the deluge become a disaster.”

The crowd shouted, “Enough! Enough! Please descend, Great Immortal, so we may thank you.” The Daoist waved his sword; the rain ceased.

They all came out from beneath the altar. The Daoist sat at the altar’s edge, smiling and bowing to Han Yu, saying, “I have not disgraced your command.” The crowd knelt and bowed with great noise. Han Yu was first stunned, then furious, and said something incredible: “I still do not believe you brought this rain.”

The Daoist laughed, “This is witnessed by all eyes, not by me alone. Could it be that you prayed it down? I am a man beyond the world, seeking no fame or wealth, not competing for merit. Why must you stubbornly twist words and show a narrow heart?”

Han Yu demanded proof. The Daoist said, “Is not the testimony of many eyes proof enough? If you do not believe, return home and measure the empty jar in your courtyard; it now holds three feet, one inch, and seven tenths of rainwater.” Han Yu ordered the Daoist taken home for measurement, and it was exact.

Suddenly, the Daoist knelt and said, “Uncle, do you now believe in the dao? Please come with your nephew to cultivate.” Han Yu was shocked, looked down, and saw that the Daoist was none other than his nephew Han Xiangzi.

Whether Han Yu agreed to Xiangzi’s request to cultivate together remains to be revealed in the next chapter.
