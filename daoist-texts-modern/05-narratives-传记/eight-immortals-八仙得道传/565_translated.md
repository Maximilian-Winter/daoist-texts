# Chapter Ninety-Seven: Swinging on a Copper Coin’s Eye — Delivering a Compassionate Mother, Severing Worldly Karmic Bonds

Now it is told that Lord Cao Guojiu was the maternal brother of Empress Cao of the Song dynasty. The two brothers were named thus: the elder was Guojiu, “Great Lord,” and his younger brother was simply called Cao Er, “Second Cao.” Though born of the same mother, their natures and ways were vastly different. Guojiu was benevolent and magnanimous, serene and detached, devoted to practicing virtue and shunning worldly strife. Though dwelling amid the bustling capital, he never meddled in court affairs. Yet whenever anyone sought his aid in suffering or hardship, he spared no effort to help within his power. Thus, all called him the Great Good Man.

Cao Er’s temper, however, was quite unlike his brother’s. He was cunning and cruel, covetous as if his life depended on wealth. Though a royal kinsman, he was miserly to a fault, often wielding his noble status to oppress common folk. Regardless of the sum, if there was money to be had, he would not let a single coin slip away. Once silver passed through his hands, he would never part with even a penny. For decades, driven by greed, he extorted and robbed openly and in secret, ruining countless lives and tearing many families apart. Guojiu repeatedly admonished him in vain, finally petitioning the Empress to separate their households. Though living in the same city, some matters still inevitably drew Guojiu into his brother’s troubles. Many who suffered at Cao Er’s hands came to Guojiu in tears, beseeching his help.

Unable to sway his younger brother, Guojiu did all he could, emptying his coffers to compensate the victims. Yet he himself loved no wealth, and fortune never came to him unbidden. His own household lived in utmost simplicity, but because of Cao Er’s misdeeds, the sums he paid out yearly were not small. Thus, the illustrious Lord Guojiu was reduced to utter poverty. Fortunately, his heart loved only the great Dao; fame and fortune were never in his mind. Besides, as a member of the royal family, no matter how poor he became—one bowl of vegetable broth, one piece of cloth—he was always assured of the bare necessities. With this assurance, he was content.

He often said to others: “I owe the grace of Heaven’s house, eating without tilling, clothing without weaving. Freed from the bustle of worldly toil, I can burn incense in quiet chambers and devote myself to the dao. Such blessings, I do not know in how many lifetimes I have earned them. Yet my younger brother spends all his days scheming for other people’s money, heedless whether it is money earned by selling one’s body or lost in ruin—he accepts it all with a smile. But what use is all this money to him? If for his own consumption, he has but one mouth and one body—surely he does not eat or wear more than I, the penniless one. If to bequeath to his sons, pity those few young masters, ruined by his wealth, each becoming a rake, skilled only in debauchery and gambling. Better are my two children, who still read a few lines of books. Though not outstanding, at least they are not scorned as royal scions who are mere embroidered pillows—fair to look at but stuffed with straw inside. Seeing this, the rich are truly more at a loss than the poor. Yet he cannot see through this. I wonder what thoughts stir in his heart.”

From the age of about twenty, Lord Guojiu took up long fasting and cultivation of the dao. By thirty, he was tested by the two immortals Lü and Han, who came personally to examine the firmness of his dao heart. Their verdict was most favorable. At their departure, they revealed their true forms and ascended to Heaven, allowing him to witness firsthand that true immortals do exist in the world—strengthening his resolve to the dao. Later, Han Xiangzi came to his home and spoke with him for three days on the great dao, inspiring Guojiu’s utmost admiration. From then on, Xiangzi remained often at his residence. Though he traveled north and south, upon completing his tasks he always returned to stay at Guojiu’s home. Over ten years passed swiftly; Guojiu’s devotion and singular focus bore fruit in considerable dao skill and mastery of many magical arts. Xiangzi instructed him to wait a few more years until his brother’s evil deeds reached their fullness and his own son was established; then he should leave home, roam the mountains and waters, and strengthen his sinews and bones. Guojiu understood that his brother’s end would surely be ill.

He was a man of great filial piety and friendship, his heart heavy with sorrow. He once gently and repeatedly admonished his brother with subtle words. But Cao Er’s life was consumed by the single word “wealth,” and he paid no heed to retribution or the great dao. At times when Guojiu urged him earnestly, tears would almost fall with his voice. Cao Er would laugh loudly, mocking his elder brother as foolish and fearing he would become mad, even hiring an imperial physician from the Grand Medical Institute to diagnose Guojiu’s pulse. When the doctor came, he bewildered Guojiu with his questions. Only upon learning the reason—that a good brother’s loving heart had arranged this to heal his elder’s “heart ailment”—did Guojiu find the matter both amusing and vexing. He politely declined the doctor and sent him away.

When Xiangzi heard of this, he laughed until nearly falling over, then said to Guojiu: “Your younger brother’s crimes are so vast that no bamboo slips could record them all. His fate in the underworld is already sealed. How can you possibly save him?” Guojiu wept and replied: “I know well that such a man is as stubborn as an ox, as dull as a pig, as cunning and cruel as a crafty fox, and as greedy as a wolf—beyond reason. But I grieve that as his elder brother, I failed to restrain him early and could not guide him later, letting him fall into chaos. How can I find peace of mind? I only seek to quiet my heart and do all I can. If I can turn even a fraction of his evil thoughts, I will have fulfilled my responsibility as a brother. Whether he listens or not, changes or not, that is his choice. What power have I?” Xiangzi sighed deeply.

One day, on Guojiu’s birthday, Cao Er and his entire family came to the mansion to pay respects. Guojiu, weary of noise, did not summon friends or relatives, but could not refuse his own kin. He prepared a banquet in the mansion. At the feast, Cao Er spoke of worldly fame and gain, while Guojiu kept returning to discussions of nature and principle. Their words stood at opposite extremes. Suddenly, Guojiu thought of something and said: “On this humble brother’s lowly birthday, I am grateful that brothers, sisters-in-law, and nephews and nieces have come to toast me. I have recently learned a little trick. Shall I perform it to accompany the wine?” Cao Er and his wife laughed: “It is rare to see our elder brother so merry. We gladly accept your performance.” The children, hearing of a new plaything, leapt up in delight and gathered around to watch. Guojiu ordered a copper coin, one wen in value, to be brought. Through the coin’s hole, two threads were passed in a cross shape. Holding it high, he blew gently and muttered incantations, then shouted loudly: “Big! Big! Big!” The coin gradually grew until it was about the size of a small gong. Guojiu closed his eyes and recited a spell, conjuring a large rat. He caught it and placed it in the coin’s hole. With a sharp shout, the rat began somersaulting along the cross threads, flipping up and down, east and west, tumbling endlessly. Men, women, and children burst into laughter.

Cao Er clapped and praised: “Brother, what skill and spirit! Even a rat can be made to perform tricks. But when did you train it? It only flips and flips, always within the coin’s hole, never escaping the circle. It seems not very interesting.” Guojiu hastened to reply: “So you mean that flipping inside the coin’s eye is not interesting?” Cao Er said: “Exactly. If it could flip outside the circle, that would be a greater skill.”

Guojiu raised his voice: “Ah, you mean you want it to jump out of the copper coin’s eye? Brother, this rat has only this small foolish skill—flipping endlessly but never leaving the coin’s eye. I have tried teaching it many times, but it cannot understand. It seems destined to flip thousands and thousands of times, dizzy and confused, until it lies flat on all fours before it can leave the circle. But when it is dead, what use is that? It only invites eternal ridicule and scorn. This is truly the rat’s limited insight and skill—worthy only of laughter!”

As he spoke, Guojiu glanced secretly at Cao Er, who remained stubbornly dull, unsure whether he truly did not understand or was feigning ignorance, merely sneering all the while. The rat continued flipping without cease. Seeing his brother so obtuse, Guojiu chased the rat away and said: “This little trick is called ‘flipping somersaults inside the copper coin’s eye.’ But the magic of the copper coin is far greater. It not only makes rats flip but can also make them swing on a swing!”

He untied the cross threads in the coin’s hole and replaced them with two parallel strings, tying a small horizontal stick below to form a swing. Blowing gently and shouting loudly, he enlarged the coin again to the size of a large gong. Then he conjured a white rabbit and placed it on the swing board. The rabbit began to swing vigorously, rising and falling, up and down, full of energy, causing another burst of laughter. Guojiu saw that Cao Er still paid little mind and felt a pang of sorrow. He swallowed it and sighed: “Look at this rabbit’s foolishness, no less than the rat’s. It relies on the coin’s power, swinging endlessly in the coin’s eye, back and forth, yet it is still the same story. In the end, the rabbit swings itself to death. When dead, the one wen coin returns to my purse. The rabbit cannot take a single coin with it. Is this not pitiable? Is it not laughable?”

Hearing this, Cao Er’s face flushed with embarrassment. He laughed loudly and said: “Enough, enough, brother, no more tricks. Let us drink a few more cups and not let the rabbit and rat laugh at us for only knowing how to swing and flip, never enjoying a moment of true peace.” Guojiu put away the coin, released the rabbit, raised his cup, and toasted his brother. Then he smiled and said: “To enjoy true peace, one must never be like this rabbit or rat. Only by jumping outside the coin’s eye can one be free and at ease, forever a contented person. If one remains caught in endless striving, chasing fame and gain, when the final hour comes, one is no different from the rat and rabbit—merely performing tricks for our amusement. They sweat and toil in vain, becoming our laughingstock. In the end, they do not even own a single coin. Why bother? Thus, the wise value the study of life itself and seek the path of longevity. All things in the world, no matter how beautiful or entertaining, tasty or useful, are like this copper coin—never truly ours. Even if temporarily possessed, we are but short-term custodians for the world. The more wealth amassed, the harder the watchman’s toil, and the greater the danger to life. This is truly the greatest folly of human life!”

Guojiu’s performance and discourse, though heartfelt and profound, only provoked Cao Er’s disdain and hatred. When the speech ended, Cao Er turned away and began playing guessing games with Guojiu’s wife, a silent rebuke to his elder brother to hold his tongue. At this, Guojiu’s burning heart was plunged into an icy cellar. He realized that Xiangzi’s words about fate’s decree in the underworld were indeed true. Cao Er was so lost that such bitter counsel only bred resentment and harmed brotherly affection. It seemed the fixed decree was beyond human power to overturn. Henceforth, Guojiu resolved to let things take their course, each going their separate way. He would focus on cultivating the great dao himself and, when Cao Er sank further into the sea of karmic retribution, he would devise means to save him. He confided this intention to Xiangzi.

Xiangzi laughed: “I told you long ago that matters are predetermined. Your brotherhood and your efforts, though futile, come from a good heart. I cannot bear to stop you, but in truth, it is all for your own peace of mind. It has no effect at all!” Guojiu was silent for a long while. Xiangzi then urged him to abandon concern for others and focus on his own future. Guojiu heeded this advice and devoted himself entirely to practice, never stepping beyond his gate.

Xiangzi, meanwhile, was invited by the immortals to accompany him to Mount Tai to arrange the reunion of Wang Tai and his mother. They parted for a time, agreeing to meet again three years hence atop Mount Heng. Guojiu kept this in mind and remained in quiet cultivation at home for over a year. Indeed, Cao Er’s misdeeds were reported by the people, and the Censorate submitted memorials. The Empress had already passed, and the court had changed. Cao Er’s faction lost power and was dismissed. Cao Er himself was tried and sentenced to death. His family was granted clemency from exile, but his property was confiscated. Guojiu, uninvolved in politics and without outside connections, escaped implication. Instead, he took charge of Cao Er’s household affairs and funeral rites. When all was settled, he entrusted his own household to his two sons, donned straw sandals and a bamboo staff, and departed to Mount Heng to meet Han Xiangzi.

Though Guojiu had cultivated for many years, he had never left the capital. Now he faced a long and arduous journey, enduring wind and frost. Fortunately, his mastery of many magical arts protected him from demons and evil spirits, and he arrived safely at the summit of Mount Heng in Hunan. Xiangzi was already there, having prepared a stone chamber for him. The brothers met with great joy. Xiangzi smiled: “See, though you traveled far, I have prepared a brand-new home for you. Among all who cultivate immortality and the dao, few are as content as you. This is because of your centuries of diligent practice and excellent merit. The Iron Crutch Patriarch has specially nurtured you, granting you this extraordinary destiny.”

Guojiu thanked him and inquired about Wang Tai’s affairs. Xiangzi laughed: “That was all arranged by the immortals centuries ago. Now we merely follow the plan. The key figure is the Great Immortal Maiden He. This matter concerns Lady Yuanzhen, whose kalpa has ended and who should be freed from disaster. The Immortal Maiden gathered us to go to Mount Tai and then to Penglai, to summon her son Wang Tai. We held a meeting and decided to send a letter to Erlang, first with courtesy, then with force. Since the matchmaker and officiant for Wang Chang’s marriage was the Old Moon Elder alone, and Erlang feared facing the other immortals, he retired to Guankou, sending the Old Moon Elder to invite him out. So the letter was sent by the Old Moon Elder. Erlang’s temper is well known among the immortals. Knowing the old matter would be raised again, he flew into a rage, threatening to harm many friendships. He declared he was not afraid of our anger and would report to the Jade Emperor, calling forth all heavenly soldiers and generals to settle scores with us. Such unreasonable words! But we know him well and expected no mercy. Hearing such wild talk, we were not much angered. Instead, we summoned Wang Tai, instructing him to find his maternal uncle, negotiate, and rescue his mother. Over a dozen heavenly immortals lent him various treasures and promised to support him from behind, so he need not fear.”

Wang Tai’s heart was torn by his mother’s long imprisonment beneath Mount Tai. He wished to find Erlang alone and was eager to cleave the mountain to rescue her. But Immortal Maiden He repeatedly dissuaded him. He also wanted to split the mountain, but Zhang Guolao advised: “Though your mother lies beneath the mountain, she is more comfortable there than in a temple. When her kalpa ends, she will be freed. Your power could easily cleave a path through Mount Tai, or even move the entire mountain tens of thousands of miles. But Erlang has not consented, and enmity remains. Even if your mother is freed, she will still suffer harm. Better to wait a while until her sins and disasters are exhausted. Then Erlang will have no excuse to refuse. If he still resists, it will be an outrage that Heaven and men cannot tolerate. With so many immortals on our side, are we afraid we cannot help you?” Wang Tai had no reply.

Later, his father Wang Chang, having become an earth immortal, visited the mountain’s base to meet his wife. Wang Tai, following Immortal Maiden He’s instructions, also came to the meeting. The husband, wife, and son were reunited in the mountain’s grotto, their sorrowful weeping stirring the Patriarchs Yuanshi and Laojun to great compassion. They pleaded with the Jade Emperor to allow Lady Yuanzhen to return this year. Yet Erlang remained stubborn. Wang Tai, emboldened and justified, prepared to fight his uncle. With the support of the immortals, his courage grew a hundredfold. He borrowed the treasured sword from Master Lü Chunyang, soared on clouds to the Nine Heavens, and sought Erlang’s palace in the Three Realms.

Erlang, alerted, summoned his troops to battle. Wang Tai, taught by many immortals and wielding numerous treasures, was no ordinary foe. Erlang was no mere mortal either. Their powers were evenly matched. They fought with sword and spell, skill and formation. In a fierce battle, Erlang was defeated by Wang Tai’s sword. Wang Tai had learned the Mysterious Lady’s Heavenly Escaping Sword Technique and wielded Master Lü’s Ganjiang treasured sword—the finest sword in Heaven and Earth, with the supreme swordsmanship of the Three Realms and Nine Streams. How could Erlang withstand it? He was driven into the sea.

Erlang’s subordinate, Pinghe, was well acquainted with the couple and hailed from the West Sea, Guankou’s domain. Hearing of Erlang’s plight, Pinghe quickly led the sea gods to protect him and sought to mediate peace. Erlang agreed to allow Wang Tai to cleave the mountain and rescue his mother, on condition that Wang Tai and his mother bow and admit fault, restoring harmony without ill will. Erlang reluctantly consented. Pinghe led Wang Tai to pay respects to his uncle, then Erlang took him to Mount Tai to remove the spells. Wang Tai split the mountain in two with a single axe, freed his mother, and met Erlang. Thus was the ancient case of immortal and mortal marriage finally resolved.

After finishing this tale, Xiangzi inquired again about Guojiu’s condition and imparted many profound dao teachings for him to cultivate on the mountain. Another twenty years passed before Master Lü, by Laojun’s command, bestowed upon him the complete Jade Register of the Eight Scenic Palaces of Lingxu. Ten more years of study followed, culminating in his full attainment of the dao. Alongside Li Tieguai, Zhongli Quan, Lü Dongbin, Immortal Maiden He, Lan Caihe, Zhang Guo, and Han Xiangzi, he formed the Eight Immortals—known throughout the world as the Eight Cavern Immortals.

Thus the history of the Eight Immortals’ cultivation has reached a great pause. Yet there remain several major events following their attainment of the dao. Dear reader, do not grow impatient; these will be unfolded in the next chapter.
