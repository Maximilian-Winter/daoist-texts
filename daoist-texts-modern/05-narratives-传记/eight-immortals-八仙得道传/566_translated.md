# Chapter Ninety-Eight: The White Snake Endures Tribulations to Attain True Fruition — The Filial Son Cuts His Arm and Encounters an Immortal

Now it happened that the Eight Immortals had attained the Dao and ascended to Heaven, led by the venerable Primordial Lord Laozi, the Queen Mother of the Jade Pool, and the Mysterious Lady of the Nine Heavens, each a divine sovereign guiding the celestial court. The Jade Emperor bestowed upon them a grand banquet and conferred noble titles, granting each a cavern abode. He specially dispatched Venus, the Great White Metal Star, Li Chang Geng, to lead the artisans of the Heavenly Palace to the various sacred mountains to construct their dwellings.

Master Iron Crutch took residence in the Purple Mist Cavern on Mount Hua. Zhang Guo dwelt in the White Dew Rock of Mount Wudang. Lan Caihe made home in the Crinkled Cloud Valley of Mount Wangwu. Lü Dongbin settled at the Delicate Cloud Cliff of Mount Emei. He Xiangu inhabited the Jade Chamber Cave on Mount Lu. Han Xiangzi resided on the Azure Cloud Peak of Mount Song. Zhongli Quan lived at the One-Line Sky of Mount Zhongnan. Cao Guojiu dwelt on the Mysterious Peak of Mount Heng. These are the Eight Cavern Immortals known to the world today.

Each cavern abode was graced with pure, exquisite, and serene scenery, with famous flowers that bloomed through all four seasons without fading. Moreover, the Jade Emperor and the various Daoist Patriarchs bestowed gifts, as did their masters, senior uncles, and brothers—every item was rare, splendid, and crafted with celestial ingenuity.

The Eight Immortals accepted their appointments and expressed thanks for the rewards. The Jade Emperor issued a special decree, the essence of which was this: In former times, the Heavenly Palace was unsettled; seeking worthy ones to assist, the celestial leaders recommended true talents. Over thousands of years, eight Immortals were successively chosen, all profound in the Dao and vast in their divine powers, each granted illustrious rank and serving in the celestial court. Yet, mindful that in recent times the hearts of mortals below have grown increasingly base, and the world’s customs more depraved, causing turmoil in the realm, it was long intended to select virtuous and capable ones to be dispatched to various places in the mortal world, to incarnate among the people as needed, to punish the licentious and encourage the good. Because true talents are rare, this plan had not yet been carried out.

Now, since the Eight Immortals all originated from the human world and understand worldly affairs thoroughly, placing them once more in the mortal realm would surely help to restore the world’s order. After consultation with the Primordial Lord Laozi and other great Daoist ancestors, this proposal was unanimously approved. Fortunate that the Heavenly Court is peaceful and the firmament clear, and that the Heavenly Palace’s duties are relatively unoccupied, it is the perfect time to dispatch them below to travel the four seas, so that while harmonizing yin and yang, they may also undertake the task of transforming and guiding the people.

The Eight Immortals accepted the mission with joy, dancing and praising the sacred virtue. When all was settled, they returned to their granted caverns to rest for a time.

By the end of the Northern Song dynasty, the world was in great chaos. The Immortals once again gathered, meeting first at Master Iron Crutch’s Purple Mist Cavern on Mount Hua. They had heard that the Suzhou-Hangzhou region was lately renowned for its wealth and abundance. The West Lake of Hangzhou, graced and maintained by generations of famous persons, had become the foremost scenic wonder in all the world.

Lü Dongbin was the first to propose visiting these two places before dispersing to tour the realm and reconvening later to receive further orders. Upon hearing this, all heartily agreed. So, mounting clouds, they flew to the foot of Jinshan at the lower reaches of the Yangtze River, alighting gently upon the misty summit.

Why did Immortal He, Iron Crutch Li, and several others have some connection with the history of Jinshan? Thus, they first gathered there and explored the ancient sites, unable to suppress their feelings of awe and melancholy. Zhang Guo and Lan Caihe inquired whether the Dragon King’s personally inscribed calligraphy could still be found. He Xiangu smiled and said, “That indeed was a fine relic, but alas, it was sunk beneath the river by that demon snake. Do you not know the tale of the White Snake flooding Jinshan?”

Some Immortals had not heard of it and eagerly asked, “What happened?”

He Xiangu, seeing their curiosity, began to recount the story—a tale both amusing and vexing. She smiled at Lü Dongbin and said, “Brother Dao, you should know something of this.” Lü Dongbin spat and replied, “How would I know such matters of demons and spirits?” He Xiangu then turned to Zhang Guo and teased, “Friend Zhang, listen well—our Brother Lü here is perhaps the most mercenary and unscrupulous among the Immortals.” Her words caused the others to cover their mouths in laughter, puzzled yet amused, and they all looked at Lü Dongbin, who laughed heartily and said, “Enough! No matter how you spin it, all the worst deeds among Immortals fall on me. If any of you have unseemly tales, just heap them on me, Lü Dongbin. I have resolved to bear all filth and impurity, sacrificing myself for the Dao. Say what you will; I won’t be polite about it!” The Immortals burst into laughter again.

He Xiangu said, “I’m not blaming you, Brother Dao. Hold your tongue a moment; let me tell the whole story, and then we’ll judge if you are truly so mercenary and unscrupulous. Do you remember what I said to you at Mount Lu? Do you know who this White Snake really is?”

Lü Dongbin thought for a moment but could not recall. Even Zhang Guo was still confused and unclear. He Xiangu pointed at Lü Dongbin and sneered, “What a heartless and mercenary Immortal you are! I had no ill will before, but now seeing your cruelty, you truly stir my anger. To be frank, this ancient relic must be compensated by you, for it was your own mother-in-law who pushed it into the river!” At this, the Immortals laughed uproariously. Lü Dongbin suddenly understood and said to Zhang Guo, “Ah, so this is the matter she means. Uncle, perhaps you remember now.

Back in the time of Emperor Yuan of the Tang, when you were still the imperial tutor, do you remember going with me to see a courtesan named White Peony?” Before he finished, Zhang Guo suddenly realized, “It seems this snake spirit must be White Peony’s mother, so our virtuous nephew Lü has become the snake spirit’s son-in-law. Nephew, I don’t mean to criticize you, but since this was your family’s doing, how can you claim ignorance? That only shows your cunning. If you truly had no dealings with them, that would show your heartlessness and ingratitude; if you feigned ignorance because you saw their decline, that is even more mercenary.” Zhang Guo, known as the most honest of the Eight Immortals, rarely joked, so hearing him tease Lü Dongbin made all the more uproarious laughter. They said, “Old Zhang is the saint of our group; how could his words be wrong? Lü Gong, if you have any defense, speak now, and we shall judge.”

Lü Dongbin only smiled and said nothing. He Xiangu then told the entire story in full.

“It turns out the snake spirit, after incarnating as a woman of the Zhu family and committing adultery with her lover, was first discovered by Lü Dongbin. Then I myself went to expose the crime. This woman claimed her purpose was to repay kindness, not ordinary adultery. Though she killed two people, it was because they first opposed her, preventing her from repaying her debt of gratitude; thus, she plotted their deaths. This was unavoidable and quite different from common murder. She hated me for interfering and ruining her good plans, causing her death. Her grudge remained unresolved after death. Such an evil ghost should have long ago fallen to the Underworld, suffering various tortures. Yet, through her master’s efforts, she bargained with the King of Hell, forcibly claiming her soul and hiding it in a magical treasure called the Soul-Collecting Bag. There it lay for two or three hundred years, often sprayed with enchanted water. At first, a thin black vapor appeared, which gradually formed into a snake shape. Only then was it released from the bag and taught to cultivate magic and transform into human form. It was not until the reign of Emperor Shenzong of Song that she finally succeeded.

Learning that her benefactor had been reborn as a man surnamed Xu, named Xian, at West Lake in Hangzhou, the White Snake’s spirit remained clear and determined to repay her debt. She petitioned her master to descend the mountain and seek out this Xu Xian. The Heavenly Lord of the Tongtian Sect knew this journey would be fraught with difficulties and forbade it. But upon hearing the news of her benefactor’s existence, the White Snake was restless day and night, unable to sit still. After some time, she secretly slipped away from her master, found Xu Xian, married him, helped him establish a household, and amassed a fortune of hundreds of thousands.

Unexpectedly, during the Dragon Boat Festival, the White Snake drank too much wine and revealed her true form—a massive, majestic serpent coiled on the bed. Xu Xian lifted the curtain and was instantly terrified to death. When the White Snake awoke and saw her husband dead from fright, she wept bitterly. Hearing that the Queen Mother’s garden contained the most fairy herbs, she obtained a sprig, hoping it could restore life. She secretly stole the herb from the Jade Pool and returned. Halfway there, the garden’s divine guardian discovered her and gave chase. Fortunately, she was already pregnant, nearly full term. Heaven, moved by her filial devotion and unchanging resolve through tribulations, granted her a superior qilin child, destined to top the imperial examinations and be protected by the gods.

The two sides fought fiercely, neither gaining advantage. Seeing she could not hold out, the spirit protecting the Star of Literary Arts explained the matter to the opposing divine generals, who then released her to return home and save Xu Xian. Unexpectedly, Xu Xian recovered from his illness and went to Jinshan Temple to offer thanks. The temple’s abbot, Fa Hai, was a highly realized monk who knew Xu Xian had been bewitched by a demon. Though the demon came to repay kindness, long association with demons would still bring harm. Fa Hai invited Xu Xian into the abbot’s quarters, revealed the karmic causes of his past life, and urged him to become a monk and not return home. Xu Xian, still fearful from the Dragon Boat Festival incident, doubted and distrusted despite the White Snake’s repeated reassurances. Hearing Fa Hai’s words revealed the truth, he was terrified and heeded the monk’s advice, refusing to return home.

When the White Snake learned this, she led three thousand demon soldiers to attack Jinshan, flooding the temple with water. Though her magic was formidable, it could not surpass Fa Hai’s. Moreover, being pregnant and with Xu Xian a mortal top scholar, both Daoist and Buddhist sects hesitated to strike decisively. In the end, Fa Hai summoned Xu Xian, instructing him to return home temporarily and wait until after his wife’s delivery before rescuing him to ordain. Xu Xian had no choice but to return with the White Snake.

Before leaving, the White Snake saw the great characters inscribed by the Dragon King on Jinshan, knowing their connection to He Xiangu. She unleashed her demon magic to push the great stone into the river, venting her long-standing anger. A sea yaksha witnessed this and hurried to report to the Dragon King. The Dragon King was furious and sent troops in pursuit. Arriving at Jinshan, he received notice from Fa Hai that the White Snake had not yet suffered disaster. The Dragon King, powerless, took back the great stone and returned to the Crystal Palace. Thus, the great stone was hidden in the Dragon Palace, never again seen by mortals.”

Having finished, He Xiangu smiled at Lü Dongbin and said, “Brother Dao, did you hear clearly? Let us all judge the matter. This was done by your honored mother-in-law. Moreover, the grudge between her and me also arose because of you. Unexpectedly, you gained her daughter as a lover, and I suffered the calamity for you. Where to begin? To make a long story short, it was your mother-in-law who destroyed my memorial relic. You should compensate me accordingly and not hide aside, feigning carelessness.” Lü Dongbin laughed, “Don’t be so sharp-tongued. You know my lover White Peony is now close to attaining the Dao. She still remembers the old grudge of her mother’s death and is preparing to bring a great accusation against you. At that time, for the sake of my lover, I will surely have to make things difficult for you.”

These words made the Immortals laugh even harder. Zhang Guo, however, remained concerned about the White Snake and pressed for the outcome. He Xiangu smiled, “By right, you should ask your Immortal nephew. They are relatives and should understand better than you or me. But he is very mercenary. Now that he has lost favor, he speaks only of avenging his mother-in-law, though he no longer even recognizes her. Not recognizing kin, he naturally knows nothing of their success or failure, life or death. Let me tell you the gist, so you, a compassionate Immortal, need not fret over unrelated matters.”

He Xiangu laughed as she told the assembly: “The White Snake bore a son. During her confinement, she could not use magic. Fa Hai saw the opportunity and secretly gave Xu Xian a golden bowl, instructing him that shining it upon the White Snake would dispel demons and prevent future harm. Xu Xian, bewitched and confused, newly fathering a child and close to his wife, thought little of the bowl’s power. Believing it could ward off evil, and knowing his wife was no demon, he took it upstairs to tease her. Unexpectedly, the White Snake was there combing her hair. As Xu Xian entered, he laughed, ‘My lady, that monk Fa Hai suddenly came again, bringing me this thing.’ Opening the bowl, the White Snake heard Fa Hai’s name and was startled. She turned and saw a spirit had long flown into the bowl, manifesting as a tiny snake about an inch long, faintly visible within. Xu Xian was terrified beyond measure, involuntarily dropping the bowl to the floor and fainting. Fa Hai then came, revived Xu Xian, explained the past causes, and took him back to the temple to ordain. Now it is said he wanders with his master. The White Snake, meanwhile, was imprisoned beneath the Leifeng Pagoda on West Lake. This pagoda was built by Prince Qian Wusu, with bricks and tiles specially crafted, each embedding a scroll of the Diamond Sutra to suppress evil spirits.

Once inside the pagoda’s depths, the White Snake was to follow Fa Hai’s orders, enter the Chan school, and devote herself to the Buddhist scriptures. Fa Hai said that if she could cleanse her heart and work diligently, she would eventually attain true fruition. The Buddha’s compassion is vast and merciful. Though the White Snake belonged to the demon sect, her conscience was not evil. Thus, today’s calamity is the foundation for her success. Later, her son passed the imperial examinations as top scholar and was granted permission to offer sacrifices at the pagoda, becoming a celebrated tale. She was also allowed by decree to meet her son outside the pagoda. At that time, Fa Hai came by cloud to examine her progress, pleased with her great improvement. He formally accepted her as a disciple and predicted that if she persevered without slackening, she would attain true fruition within one thousand years. The year the pagoda falls will be the day of her ascension. This is yet to come. Since the White Snake’s heart is kind and good, it seems there is no failure in store. We shall see in the future.”

Lü Dongbin listened, calculated briefly, and nodded with a smile: “When this thing succeeds, the emperors of Central Plains will surely vanish. Even our Daoist order will undergo some change. The first to be affected will be Zhang Tianshi, who will be abolished at that time.” Zhang Guo said, “Indeed, I once spoke of this at Dragon and Tiger Mountain with the Tianshi. He seemed quite displeased. But these are fixed destinies; how can they be forced?” Lü Dongbin replied, “Nothing in the world remains unchanged. The Tianshi, a mere mortal, enjoys great authority with no real skill, relying solely on a hereditary seal to inherit his office and rank as a Perfected, appointed Tianshi. This is far too easy. How can such a state last forever?” Before he finished, Iron Crutch and Zhongli said, “Heaven’s secrets should not be lightly revealed. You two should be cautious with your words.” The two bowed respectfully, “Master’s words are wise. From now on, all should keep silent and speak cautiously.”

The Immortals then left Jinshan and journeyed to Gusu. The people of Su were most devoted to Lü Dongbin; every year on the fourteenth day of the fourth lunar month, his temple was thronged with incense and worshippers. At this time, the temple was bustling with men and women, young and old, many seeking children or cures—truly a busy scene. The Eight Immortals, disguised as ordinary folk, went to observe.

Inside the temple, the halls and courtyards were packed. Among the crowd was a man with tear-streaked face, clutching incense ashes, hastily leaving the temple. Instead of taking the main road, he turned toward a rarely traveled path behind the temple. The Immortals said, “This man is so hurried and earnest, and his face is full of righteous spirit. He must be in great distress. Holding incense ashes, he is surely treating someone’s illness. Let us quietly follow and see.”

They concealed their forms and silently followed him to a secluded spot. The man looked around and, seeing no one near, hurriedly rolled up his right sleeve, drew a sharp blade with his left hand, gritted his teeth, and cried out, “Heavenly Lord above, I am Ye Baimin. At home I have only one eighty-year-old father. I regret being born incapable, unable to fulfill my filial duty, causing my father discomfort in daily life and poor nourishment. Now he lies sick in bed, life hanging by a thread. I cannot afford famous doctors nor buy medicine. I have only my sincere heart. I will cut my arm to save my father. If Heaven pities my sincerity and protects my father to recover, living one more year, I am willing to reduce my own lifespan by one year. I earnestly beg Heavenly Lord to show mercy.”

Tears fell like rain. Raising the sharp blade, he cut into his left arm. Hearing this, the Immortals sighed deeply. Lü Dongbin, seeing him about to cut, immediately performed a wondrous method, lightly brushing his arm. Ye Baimin had already sliced off a bloody piece of flesh but felt no pain and smiled faintly. He applied the incense ashes to the wound, which quickly formed a scar. Amazed, Ye Baimin knelt and kowtowed seventeen or eighteen times before returning to the main road.

The Immortals discussed the matter, greatly praising Ye Baimin’s filial devotion. Lü Dongbin said, “Such acts are called foolish filial piety by ordinary people. Yet, no matter what, it is a heart of utmost sincerity, worthy of Heaven’s attention. I propose that from now on, all local earth gods be informed: when encountering such filial sons, they should apply my method to stop pain and prevent decay, sparing the filial sons from suffering. What say you all?” The assembly joyfully agreed.

From then on, Lü Dongbin and the Immortals, wherever they went, taught this method to the local earth gods, the day and night wandering spirits, the officials on duty, and the household Daoist gods. All paid careful attention and learned well. Thus it is said that those who cut their flesh to save kin feel little pain and do not suffer decay. It is not that their flesh is different, but that Lü Dongbin’s method, transmitted through the earth gods and other spirits with close ears and eyes, provides secret care at all times.

Whether Ye Baimin’s father was saved remains to be revealed in the next chapter.
