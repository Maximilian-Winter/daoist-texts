# Chapter Ninety-Nine: The Gathering of Immortals at Suzhou and the Tale of the Bridge of Awaiting the Immortal Brightening Xizi

Now it happened that Ye Baimin returned home, mixing the leftover incense ash into the flesh of his arm, brewing a decoction for his father to drink. At that moment, the Eight Immortals had already followed him closely. On one hand, they summoned the local earth deity and the day-and-night wandering spirits to teach the method to stop pain and prevent decay; on the other, they inquired into Ye Baimin’s daily conduct. Learning that he was a penniless scholar and healer, tending the sick despite his simple nature and clumsy disposition—after twenty years of study, he still could not write ordinary characters properly—they found that half his hardship came from the bitter poverty at home. Two-thirds of those twenty years had been spent in medical practice, earning meager profits to support his filial duty to his parents. Now in his forties, he had yet to marry. He never entertained such thoughts; he simply lived humbly and uprightly, devoted to supporting his parents. Yet misfortune struck—his mother had passed away two years before, and he had pledged his own body to a medicine shop, hanging a sign to see patients. The agreement was that all fees earned within three years would belong to the shop, which had lent him fifty taels of silver to cover the funeral expenses.

Fortunately, the shop owner pitied him as a dutiful son and still gave him a small salary each year. Ye Baimin was stingy with spending, giving all he had to his father’s delicacies. Unexpectedly, his father recently fell ill again, near death’s door. So Ye Baimin went to the Lüzu Temple to seek some incense ash, cutting his arm to save his father. By chance, the Eight Immortals happened upon this scene. Lüzu tended his wound, then accompanied him home, sprinkling a talismanic water upon his father’s face. Instantly, the ailment vanished. Seeing Ye Baimin’s extreme poverty, Lüzu said to the immortals, “This man is so filial, yet so destitute—I feel a deep injustice on his behalf.” He Xiangu smiled and said, “He reveres you so greatly; if you do not think of a way to help him prosper, can you still call yourself a true Daoist immortal?” Lüzu laughed, “Is that not easy? You all sit here in the temple; watch me devise a method to help him grow wealthy.” Then he transformed into a beggar and went to Ye’s home to beg alms.

Ye’s house was small; voices inside could be heard clearly from outside. Lüzu shouted and listened carefully. An old man’s voice said, “Son, by the grace of the immortal lord’s protection, my illness has miraculously healed. Remember, all the days ahead are gifts from the immortal grandfather. You must be especially good and do good deeds. Though our home is poor, the poor in this world are countless. We think ourselves most wretched, but how can we know there are not those who suffer more? Listen—outside there is a beggar asking for alms; he is worse off than we are. Give him the leftover cold rice I just ate, along with some salted vegetables and fresh meat you bought this morning. Give it all to him.” Another voice replied, “Father, rest assured—I will take care of him.” Then a middle-aged man appeared. Lüzu recognized him as the man who had cut his arm yesterday. He stepped forward, pleading for alms.

Baimin sighed and said, “Brother, I never expected a man of your bearing and talent to be poorer than we are. Truly, it is most pitiable. Wait here; I will go to the kitchen and see if I can find something to ease your hunger.” Lüzu thanked him.

Not long after, Baimin returned with two bowls of rice, two pieces of meat, and a dish of salted vegetables, placing them in the main hall. “Brother, come. This is all I have left—two bowls of rice. Let us each eat one.” Lüzu entered boldly, sitting opposite him. Seeing only two small pieces of dried meat, he frowned and said, “I do not believe your household is so frugal—how can there be only this little meat? Honestly, even these two small pieces, if given entirely to me, would barely moisten my parched intestines.” Baimin was stunned. “Brother, how can you say such things? We are both in hardship, so I dared to invite you to share these scraps. If what you say is true, then you are like a pampered nobleman. Don’t say I did not invite you; how could you bear to live the life of a mendicant?”

Lüzu angrily said, “You are unreasonable. I come to your home as your guest. Even if you are truly poor, you must find a way to prepare a few dishes so we can drink and eat together—that would be proper. Moreover, you have a big pot of meat and a jar of fine white rice hidden away. Why not bring them out instead of telling me such things? Is this how you treat guests?” Baimin was astonished. “Brother, you speak amusingly. I am so poor I cannot even afford ordinary vegetables. The pork you see was bought with the money I raised by pawning a small garment, to help my father’s appetite after his illness. There is no big pot of meat. As for rice, I have only a little left for tonight and tomorrow morning. This is the only cooked rice. Where is this jar of rice you speak of? Brother, you must be joking.”

Lüzu laughed heartily. “Good, then take me to the kitchen and see if I wronged you.” Baimin, somewhat displeased, pulled his sleeve and led him to the kitchen. There, a wondrous thing! Upon entering, the scent of meat filled the air. Lifting the lid of the pot, there lay a large pig’s trotter, stewed to tender perfection, just right to eat. Lüzu also lifted the lid of the rice jar, which contained steaming hot rice. Baimin was dumbfounded. Lüzu pointed and sneered, “How about that? Was I wrong? You kept telling me you pitied me as a poor man, yet here you are pretending poverty for my sake.”

Suddenly enlightened, Baimin prostrated himself before Lüzu, saying, “Brother, you must be a celestial immortal, pitying your disciple’s poverty and coming specially to save my father and me. I beg you, great immortal, show mercy and quickly grant your aid.” Lüzu laughed aloud. “You are not only stingy but also foolish. No wonder you are so poor. When have you ever seen an immortal? If one truly is an immortal, why would he come to your poor home without reason? Do you think he wants your incense offerings?” Saying this, he strode to the main hall, slapped the table, and called for the meat to be brought out for all to share. Baimin filled a large plate with meat from the pot and replaced the rice with hot servings. Yet, astonishingly, the pot and jar remained as full as before, unchanged by the servings taken. Baimin’s faith in Lüzu as an immortal deepened.

The people of Suzhou revered Lüzu most of all. Having just come from his temple the day before, it was easy to believe this was Lüzu’s incarnation, testing his heart and deeds. Trembling, Baimin respectfully placed the meat and rice before Lüzu, saying, “Great immortal, please partake.” He knelt and served him. Lüzu paid no mind, eating bowl after bowl—more than twenty in all. Baimin refilled his bowl over twenty times and served meat five or six times. Lüzu smiled, “You foolish host, now you understand some of the ways of hospitality. After all this food, do you not feel any regret?” Baimin said nothing, only bowed deeply, pleading for aid. Lüzu ignored him, eating until about thirty bowls were finished. Then he stretched, rubbed his belly, looked up, and laughed heartily. “Good, now this is more like it. Host, you should eat a bowl too. Forgive my laziness; I will rest a while.”

He lay down on the table and soon snored thunderously, utterly asleep. Baimin dared not leave, remaining devoutly prostrate. After a while, his father, seeing his son missing, came out leaning on his cane. He was astonished to see Baimin kneeling before the beggar. Baimin quickly said, “This is truly Lü Chunyang, the Patriarch Lü.” His father, without questioning, knelt beside his son with a thud. Lüzu awoke, seeing the two kneeling by him, and laughed, “Are you two here to ask me for alms? Speak plainly—why all this pretense?” They begged, “Great immortal, please watch over us; Patriarch, grant us blessings.” Lüzu called them to rise, but they refused, kneeling still. Angered, he said, “Where in the world are there fools like you? Kneeling so long—are you unwilling to let me eat your meat and rice? Then I shall return it to you.”

Before he finished, he spat violently, making a mess on the ground and upon the two. Looking up, the beggar had vanished, leaving behind a fragrance that intoxicated the senses. The father and son bowed and rose. Baimin recounted the scene to his father. They sighed at their lack of immortal fate and lamented together. They swept away the spit and cast it into the courtyard dirt. Unexpectedly, in an instant, a sprig of fragrant herb sprouted from the earth, filling the house with pure fragrance that penetrated the senses and bones, bringing comfort and tenfold vitality. Baimin’s father’s white hair turned black; his eyes and ears sharpened; his steps became swift. Baimin himself felt his spiritual palace clear and his body joyful.

Word of this spread far and wide. Within hundreds of li, the sick came to Baimin for diagnosis. His mind now clear and enlightened, his pulse readings perfectly matched the ailments. In every medicine, he added a pinch of fragrant herb that truly cured disease. In a short time, Ye Baimin’s reputation as a divine healer spread everywhere. Within less than three years, he became immensely wealthy. Thus all said Lüzu was now in Suzhou; whoever met him would surely gain wealth and blessings.

On the fourteenth day of the fourth month, everyone dressed anew to burn incense at Lüzu’s temple. The place was small and crowded, so packed it was hard to tell what was happening. The villagers, passing the story by word of mouth, called this event “the gathering of the immortals.” It was said that on Lüzu’s birthday, he would save one person each year, granting either fortune or blessing. Lüzu himself mingled among the crowd; if one was fated to meet him and stood close, one’s wishes would be fulfilled, and wealth and honor would come together. The funniest thing was that, because Ye’s immortal herb resembled the plant “evergreen,” ignorant folk, through rumor and hearsay, on the night before Lüzu’s birthday, would throw leaves of the evergreen at their door, hoping to grow immortal herbs like Ye’s. This falsehood was known by nearly all. Yet no one thought that Lüzu’s blessing of Ye Baimin came from his sincere filial piety. These people cast aside the root cause, seeking only the reward of wealth and blessing. Truly, there is no greater folly in the world.

Putting aside such idle talk, another similar event occurred in Suzhou not many years after Lüzu saved the Ye family. At that time, there was a shop in Suzhou specializing in marinated pork and duck, run by a man surnamed Lu, nicknamed “Lu the Good.” Each year, all profits he earned he gave away to the poor, earning this good name. That winter, the harvest was poor, and the number of poor increased. Hearing of Lu’s generosity, poor villagers came, old and young, seeking aid. But the shop was small, and business had slowed due to the hard times. Lu himself struggled to maintain the shop, with no surplus for charity. Yet he could not refuse those who came for help. So he sold a few acres of ancestral farmland and a house to fund his giving. The funds were limited, but the number of supplicants grew daily. Soon all was exhausted. Some came from afar, receiving no help, unable to return home. Lu could only sigh and weep.

One night, a beggar covered in festering sores, near death, came to his door and lay down, unable to move. When spoken to, he could only mutter incoherently, occasionally pointing to his belly to show his hunger. Seeing this, and the weather turning, threatening snow, Lu said to a clerk, “This man suffers so greatly; if the wind and snow strike tonight, he will surely die before dawn. Though I am poor, I cannot stand by and watch death. Help him inside to the kitchen to warm. Give him hot tea and rice. Tomorrow, ask Mr. Ye across the street to see him and give medicine. Healing him would be a great merit.”

This Mr. Ye was none other than Ye Baimin, now famed. All who came to him were cured without fail. Believing his success came from immortal aid, he charged no fees, even paying for medicines himself. Later, he opened a herbal medicine shop at his door, not for profit but to accumulate virtue. Yet at year’s end, his accounts always showed a surplus. This was the time the herbal shop opened, and Lu was a longtime friend, hence the conversation.

The clerk, however, found the beggar filthy and refused to assist. Lu had no choice but to help him himself. Upon lifting the beggar, Lu’s nose caught a pure fragrance emanating from the man, penetrating his bones and filling him with comfort. Lu’s mind was busy planning how to help the many poor and how to treat this beggar, so he paid no heed.

The beggar stayed several days, calling for Ye Baimin to diagnose and prescribe. After about ten days, he recovered and left, bowing in thanks. Before departing, he said, “I owe you my life, sir, and can repay only with this: treasure everything I have used and left behind. Your future wealth and promotion lie within.” Then he limped away.

Later, the clerk reported, “This beggar is no human. The master treated him so well, yet when he left, he left his bedding in a filthy state—broken mats and quilts covered with filth and sores. Such a wretched man should have died outside. Why save him?” This warning made Lu forbid anyone to touch the beggar’s belongings. Upon inspection, the bedding was indeed filthy, with much excrement and scabs. Yet Lu noticed a strange fragrance rising from the quilt, and the filth shimmered with light. Touching it, he found it hard as iron and cold as ice.

On closer examination, the excrement had turned to gold, the scabs to gold as well. Lu realized the beggar was an immortal in disguise, come to bestow blessings. Lu immediately became wealthy. Later, he cooked meat with the bedding, which gave off a wondrous fragrance. Every large pot of meat, with just one sprig of the herb, would emit a divine aroma. Thus Lu’s marinated meats became famous. All knew the meat was cooked with immortal relics, hence the special scent. The name “Lu Gaoyan” (Lu the Marinated Meat) became known throughout the land, as famed as Ye Baimin the doctor. Lu’s descendants prospered for generations. The bedding, Ye said, had the same power as the immortal herb. Any serious illness could be cured by boiling a square inch of it into a decoction. Lu, now wealthy, refused to continue the business, cutting the quilt into countless pieces. Over years, many patients were saved. Later, when a prince’s favored consort could not give birth and all doctors failed, someone mentioned Lu Gaoyan’s shop and its immortal treasures. They obtained some, and upon taking it, she gave birth safely. The prince rejoiced, reported to the emperor, and was specially honored, fulfilling the immortal’s promise of wealth and rank. Lu said the immortal was likely Lüzu, and he went to Lüzu’s temple to offer incense. Lüzu revealed it was actually Patriarch Tieguai Li. Since then, the Lu family worshipped Li Daozu. This is a later tale.

Meanwhile, the Eight Immortals, having lingered long in Suzhou, journeyed to Hangzhou. They spent several days enjoying the City God Mountain. By then, West Lake was no longer the wild brush and smoke of old. The Su and Bai causeways stretched across the lake, with six bridges and three bamboo groves, pagodas and strange peaks—nature and art combined to create the finest scene under Heaven. The immortals lingered, reluctant to leave. Hearing that within the Golden Gate below City God Mountain was a noodle shop, where a clerk was honest and kind, with no family or wife, giving all his wages to the poor, and never wasting leftovers but giving them cleanly to beggars, even eating what could not be given away, he was known as a man of virtue. Lüzu heard this and thought, “This man has some simplicity. If fate allows, I might save him.” So he transformed into a poor Daoist and asked the clerk for leftover noodles. The clerk gave him a large bowl of leftover noodles. Lüzu took it, found it tasteless, and after eating, spit it out with a fuss. The bowl remained full, not a grain less, and he said, “This noodle is not to my taste. I cannot accept your kindness; I return it.” The clerk smiled and took it back without anger.

Finding it too dirty to eat, and just then a mangy dog ran in, licking its lips, hoping for food. The clerk gave the noodles to the dog. Upon swallowing, the dog instantly ascended to Heaven, transforming into a golden dragon, shaking its head and wagging its tail as it flew away. The clerk realized he had seen an immortal and hurried to find the Daoist, but he had vanished. The clerk became mentally ill, ceased business, and every day stood on the small bridge by the door, looking up, hoping the immortal would return. After years of waiting with no sign, he grew mad and drowned, later being saved by Lüzu as a ghost-immortal.

This was because he lacked immortal fate; his destiny was only to become a ghost-immortal, and only after death could he be saved. As for the mangy dog, it was the dog Lüzu had harmed in his youth. Now it had received his grace and was freed from its grievance. This was told earlier; readers may recall. After the clerk’s death, people called the bridge where he died the Bridge of Awaiting the Immortal.

Returning to the Eight Immortals’ wanderings, more than a hundred years later, it was the time of the Queen Mother’s longevity celebration. The Eight Immortals gathered to offer felicitations, agreeing to cross the sea together. One day on the East Sea, Lan Caihe accidentally dropped the white jade flower basket he carried into the water. The Dragon King and his consort were in their palace discussing sea affairs with officials when suddenly a white light illuminated the entire hall.

The Dragon King’s grandsons, Mo Ang and Mo Run, curious and young, brought several yaksha to investigate, only to find the white jade flower basket. Overjoyed, they prepared to take it back to the palace. Meanwhile, Caihe had arranged to meet He Xiangu and entered the sea in pursuit. Seeing Mo Ang and Mo Run, they demanded the basket back. The two were furious, saying, “Our brother found this; how can it be yours?” Words turned to quarrel, then fighting. Mo Ang and Mo Run, unaware of the danger, led the yaksha to battle. The two immortals drew swords to resist. How could the yaksha withstand the immortals’ power? In a few moves, both were slain by the immortals’ swords.

How this matter resolves remains unknown—await the next chapter’s unfolding.
