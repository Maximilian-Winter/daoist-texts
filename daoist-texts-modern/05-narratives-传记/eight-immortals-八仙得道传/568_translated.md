# Chapter One Hundred: The Eight Immortals Cross the Sea—War Breaks Out on the Ocean; Two Dragons Return to Heaven’s Palace to Celebrate Peace

Now, it is told that the Dragon King’s two grandsons, Mo’ang and Mo’rùn, quarreled with the two immortals Lan and He over a flower basket. In the heat of contention, the two immortals unleashed flying swords that slew Mo’ang and Mo’rùn outright. Several yaksha attendants who had accompanied them were grievously wounded but managed to flee back to the Dragon Palace. There, they found the Dragon King and Queen and tearfully recounted the calamity.

Upon hearing the news, the Dragon King and Queen cried out in fury, “This enrages me to death!” They immediately commanded ten thousand divine soldiers from the nearby seas to rise, with the Dragon King himself leading the charge to pursue and attack the two immortals.

When the two immortals realized they had slain the Dragon King’s grandsons, they hastened to report this to the assembly of immortals. The three immortals Tieguai, Zhongli, and Chunyang were greatly alarmed, exclaiming, “This trouble you have stirred is no small matter! The Dragon King and Queen have four sons and four grandsons. Now that two of their grandsons have been killed by you, how could they possibly rest in peace?”

The two immortals replied, “The disaster was of their own making. If we lost something, would we not be right to seek it back?” The assembly of immortals considered this and said, “Though what you say is true, the Dragon King and Queen are not easy to deal with. Moreover, among us, there are those who have close ties with them. To meet under such circumstances would be most awkward.” The two immortals said, “Let us see how they approach. If all parties speak reasonably, we can admit to the crime of accidentally harming others. Truly, we did not know these two were the Dragon King’s grandsons; we regret it deeply. But since they are of such noble birth, why did they cause such trouble? Furthermore, if they had revealed their identity, no matter how reluctant we were, we would have returned to confer with everyone and devise a plan. This disaster would never have arisen. Convey this to the Dragon King and see if he might pardon us. Should he come without hearing our reasons and attack, we will not surrender without a fight. We will battle first and then see how matters stand. What do you all think?”

At this moment, the three immortals Lü, Li, and Zhong, knowing the cause and effect of this matter were predestined, and that the Dragon King and Queen were fated to endure calamity, refrained from blaming the two immortals. Instead, they said, “The Dragon King and Queen are both strong-willed and fierce in nature. Seeing their beloved grandsons slain, how could they settle matters peacefully? This calls for a great battle. You two need not worry. As fellow practitioners of the dao, we shall share fortune and calamity together, never leaving you to bear the burden alone.” The two immortals rejoiced and expressed their thanks.

Before a word was finished, the sea waves surged violently, shining with golden radiance. In an instant, thousands upon thousands of soldiers and horses emerged. The Dragon King Pinghe, with his subordinates and valiant generals, furious beyond measure, charged into the sky. The immortals hurried to place Tieguai at the forefront to respond.

Tieguai, upon seeing the Dragon King, raised his hand in salute. The Dragon King, recognizing half of the immortals and recalling the many favors he had received from them, could not help but burn with rage. Pointing at Tieguai, he shouted, “So it is you scoundrels who have harmed my two beloved grandsons! Since you are old friends of mine, I have never treated you poorly. Yet now, passing through my domain, you do not come ashore to visit old friends, but instead wreak havoc at sea, killing my grandsons. How can this grievance be avenged? To make things short, I give you but a moment to hand over the culprits for me to deal with as I see fit. If you comply, all will be forgiven, and you may pass in peace. But if you hesitate or equivocate, humph! Do not say you pitiful lot lack courage. Even if a million heavenly soldiers come, my wife and I have twice caused chaos in Heaven’s Court and never lost face. How much less will I suffer at your hands!”

Tieguai laughed at his unreasonable tirade and said, “After thousands of years, it seems you old dragon still have such a stubborn temper! Alas, I pity you who enjoy your throne and abundant blessings, yet cannot escape this great calamity. I would have calculated how you might avoid this disaster and reign as Dragon King for a few more years. But fate is fulfilled, and there is nothing to be done. Seeing you roar so, you no longer resemble a Dragon King. Your shameless words make you less than a mere beast. You serve as a high official under the Jade Emperor, granted a royal title, yet you neither cherish grace nor repay kindness, and dare boast of your barbarous deeds in Heaven’s Court. Know that all things in the world have cause and effect. You reap what you sow. Heaven’s principle is clear and exact. You thought that after wreaking havoc in Heaven’s Court, the Jade Emperor would not punish you but instead honor you with a title, believing no one in Heaven or Earth could match your prowess. Yet all this was destined by great fate. Your achievements in governing the seas and your imperial rank could not defy destiny, so you were spared until now. But the case of havoc in Heaven’s Court cannot go unpunished. I have calculated your fate, and now is the time for your retribution. This reckoning is but the due consequence of your role as Dragon King. The past could not help but grant you kingship, just as today you cannot avoid this reckoning. Since we share a long-standing bond, we have agreed that I should come forward to discuss with you how to pass this trial. Even if you cannot escape the calamity, perhaps some mitigation can be found, so your entire clan need not perish. Yet upon seeing me, you hurl insults and even blame past misdeeds to suppress me. This shows your fate is sealed, utterly beyond forcing. It is a pity my goodwill is cast into your vast sea, leaving no trace whatsoever.”

This volley of laughter and scorn was the greatest humiliation the Dragon King had ever suffered in his life. Yet with a furious roar, he led his troops forward to attack. The Eight Immortals each drew their weapons, meeting the assault on all sides. The battle raged so fiercely that Heaven and Earth changed color, the sun and moon hid their faces. From midday until dusk, the Dragon King spat forth a luminous pearl that hung suspended in the sky, shining brighter than daylight, and pressed the attack.

Among the Eight Immortals, Lü Chunyang produced a pearl no larger than a soybean, raised it in his hand, and tossed it upward. Suddenly, it emitted rays of light ten thousand feet long, larger and brighter than the night luminous pearl, causing the latter to dim in comparison. Lü Patriarch laughed and said, “You wretched dragon, now that we fight by night, we need not borrow your light. See how my treasure compares to your dragon pearl!”

Meanwhile, the Dragon King’s troops were already dazed and confused by the Eight Immortals’ weapons and treasures. Now, struck by Lü Patriarch’s pearl light, they were dazzled and unable to see clearly. Seizing the moment, Li Tieguai uncovered his gourd and blew out several gusts of wind, sucking them all into the gourd. On the sea’s surface, only the Dragon King remained. He transformed into his original form and let out a mighty roar, opening his enormous dragon mouth to swallow the Eight Immortals.

Zhongli laughed, “This is my old trick for killing flood dragons. I will grow my body longer and larger than the dragon’s, grasp its whiskers, and pull with all my might.” He pulled so fiercely that the old dragon’s head was covered in blood. Then the other immortals rushed in, each stretching their bodies long and vast, pressing their attacks against the dragon’s body.

The Dragon King was in dire straits when the Dragon Queen, having learned of his predicament, sent the sea’s troops in full force, personally leading two princes to aid him. By then, dawn had broken. Lü Patriarch withdrew his pearl. The Dragon King attempted to retrieve his night luminous pearl, but it seemed to follow Lü Patriarch’s pearl like a child clinging to its parent, flying over to him. The Dragon Queen hurried to pursue, but with a thunderous sound, the two pearls—great and small—both entered Lü Patriarch’s palm.

Deprived of his luminous pearl, the Dragon King felt as if one of his three souls had fled, his mind confused. Then, bitten on the neck by the fierce tiger Zhongli rode, he was utterly defeated and fled. Zhongli pursued him into the sea. The Dragon King shrank into a tiny loach and escaped into the Crystal Palace.

Meanwhile, the two immortals Caihe and Xiangzi, taking advantage of the battle, had already sneaked into the Dragon Palace. They smashed the main gates and set fire to the halls. The Dragon King, unable to advance or retreat, was a man of fierce spirit and unyielding heart. Unable to bear such humiliation, he let out a great roar and struck his head against the palace, shattering skull and brain, dying a tragic death.

Caihe and Xiangzi burned several halls before retreating to the sea surface to assist Tieguai and the others in resisting the Dragon Queen. At this time, the four sea Dragon Kings, brothers of Ao Guang, hearing their father was in peril, each led their divine troops to aid the battle.

Ao Guang, the eldest son of the Dragon King, was the most resourceful and skilled in magic. When he arrived with his troops, he had already agreed with his three brothers to each bring half the sea water under their command. When the battle grew fierce, they would release the waters, immersing the Eight Immortals in a great flood.

The sea and sky seemed to merge, water meeting heaven, heaven meeting water, forming a vast and immense waterfall. Though the Eight Immortals each had arts to avoid water, fighting in the flood was far less convenient for them.

The Eight Immortals gritted their teeth in fury. One by one, they soared to a higher layer of the sky and looked down. They saw the Dragon Queen and several sons and grandsons, brandishing weapons and stirring waves in search of their foes.

The Eight Immortals sighed, “The dragon’s retribution has come, yet he still dares to menace others. How many people and beasts will drown this time? How many homes and fields will be swept away?”

Lü Patriarch said, “Since this villain is so heartless, we, bearing the Jade Emperor’s edict, patrol the Three Realms to rid the people of harm. Without concern for profit or loss, we must use the method of pushing earth and filling water to level this great sea, so as to subdue such wicked beasts.”

The immortals asked, “Where shall we find so much earth?”

Lü Patriarch smiled and pointed to Mount Tai, saying, “If we move this mountain into the sea, we cannot fill the sea entirely, but at least we can bury those wicked beasts within.”

The immortals applauded. Lü Immortal then performed the mountain-moving technique, scooping up all of Mount Tai in his hand and pressing it down into the sea where the Dragon Queen and her kin were. Alas, the Dragon Queen, several princes and grandsons, and many shrimp soldiers and crab generals were crushed to death beneath it.

Though Mount Tai was later returned to its original place, much earth remained submerged in the sea, forming a cluster of small islands. The area originally had several islands of low elevation, now covered by this earth, rising into many highlands connected to the newly formed islands. Later generations said these were the Ryukyu Islands. Whether this is true or not, since the region has many islands, it cannot be confirmed. This is but idle talk.

Now this book is about to end, and there is no more to say. The Dragon clan suffered this great calamity, with only Ao Guang escaping alive. He went before the Jade Emperor to weep and plead his grievances. The Eight Immortals restored Mount Tai to its place.

Ancient texts say that ascending Mount Tai is like surveying all under Heaven, showing that in olden times Mount Tai was considered the highest mountain in the world. But today, those versed in geography know Mount Tai is not especially tall. Even within China, many mountains surpass it. This is not the narrow view of ancient people, but because when the Eight Immortals moved the mountain to fill the sea, much earth was scattered and remained in the sea, forming islands. These islands are all fragments of Mount Tai’s soil. Thus, since the Eight Immortals crossed the sea, Mount Tai has been much lowered. This is why ancient and modern Mount Tai differ.

Having completed the dragon-slaying affair, the Eight Immortals all went together to the Jade Pool to offer birthday felicitations. By then, the Jade Emperor and several immortal patriarchs had already arrived. The Eight Immortals reported the dragon-slaying episode. The Jade Emperor, most benevolent, did not hold past grudges and had long since forgotten the previous crimes of the two dragons.

Upon hearing the report, His Sacred Heart was somewhat displeased, seeming to reproach the Eight Immortals for acting without authorization and slaying celestial officials. Then Yuanshi Laojun, accompanied by his chief disciples Fire Dragon and the two Perfected Ones Piaomiao, explained that the two dragons’ havoc in Heaven’s Court and their severing of the earth’s meridians deserved retribution. The Jade Emperor had sought worthy aides because of these events. Now the dragon clan’s tragic calamity at the hands of the Eight Immortals was predestined and beyond blame.

The Jade Emperor suddenly understood and said, “Though the two dragons had past crimes, their work in controlling waters was not without merit. They governed the seas for many years without major fault. Now they suffer this cruel retribution, which is their own doing and hard to avoid. Yet my heart remains uneasy.” He then ordered Fire Dragon and the two Perfected Ones to transmigrate the two dragons and their descendants, rebirthing them into good, wealthy families among mortals.

Since Pinghe’s eldest son Ao Guang had escaped, and was known for his talent, wisdom, and considerable dao power, as well as years of experience governing the seas, he was appointed to succeed his father’s post, repaying his parents’ years of service and demonstrating the utmost fairness in reward and punishment.

The immortal patriarchs and Queen Mother all praised the Jade Emperor’s virtue. Soon, Ao Guang hurried from the Lingxiao Palace to the Jade Pool, knelt before the Jade Emperor, and tearfully recounted his grievances. The Jade Emperor comforted him and explained the cause and effect of the matter. He then announced various virtuous intentions.

Ao Guang, both sorrowful and moved, kowtowed and thanked the Sacred Grace. The Jade Emperor summoned the Eight Immortals to meet with him and dispatched Fire Dragon and the two Perfected Ones to further explain the principles of cause and effect, forbidding either side from harboring enmity. Should they disobey, they would be punished by heavenly law.

The Eight Immortals and Ao Guang together bowed before the Jade Emperor, Queen Mother, and the immortal patriarchs in gratitude.

From then on, Heaven’s Court was peaceful and the seas clear. With no further matters to record, this book thus concludes.
