# Preface

The human heart is but a single inch in breadth; if one’s thoughts incline toward goodness, one attains the rank of immortal; if one’s thoughts incline toward evil, one remains among the mundane. Is the immortal realm truly a secret path apart? No—it lies solely in removing one’s own barriers. Master Sa, a man of the Five Dynasties, recorded in the registers of the Western River of Shu, was once an immortal indeed. Yet when we examine him closely, he was but a petty clerk with a single brush; he had already changed his profession at Xuqi, yet his work had not yet reached the depth of the threefold mystery. Moreover, he became a transmitter of the dharma lineage, navigating subtle distinctions and savoring flavors—not measured by days or years. Still, his will held a longing that no profit could tarnish; his thoughts were fixed, undisturbed by desire; his spirit concentrated alone, undaunted by dangers and obstacles—thus was his heart pure and true.

The ancients who were serene and tranquil—though Confucius among the scholars, Muni among the Buddhists—were all peers. Therefore, their merit covers the six curtains of the world, their grace flows through the nine earths; they enter and exit the hidden and the manifest, overseeing and protecting the people and things. The celestial hosts then raise them up, enrolling them among the Heavenly Pivot. Alas! Alas! Did Master Sa ever swallow moonlight, chew on the essence of the sun, gnaw on the mist and vapor, boil the yellow and cook the white, wash the marrow and shave the hair? No, these were but matters of the mind. Hence I say: immortal and mundane are not secret paths apart; they differ only in removing one’s own barriers. When the barriers are removed, one masters the thoughts of the sage; when the barriers remain, one is lost in mad imaginings. Immortal and mundane—indeed, they are the keys and locks of the human heart.

In my leisure, I examined the collection *In Search of Spirits*, admiring Master Sa’s spontaneous benevolent breeze. I gathered his remaining deeds and expanded them into the *Record of the Spellbound Dates*. The Spellbound Dates recount one matter of magical arts that encompasses all others. This is not merely to illuminate the jade scrolls of the immortals, but also to honor the divine numinous for those who cultivate the heart. Should anyone regard this as baseless talk, amidst the clamorous world of flutes and drums, where sycophants abound—then how dare I! How dare I!
