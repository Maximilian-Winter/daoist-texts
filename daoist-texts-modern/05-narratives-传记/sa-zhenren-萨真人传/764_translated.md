# Chapter One: General Account of the Ranks of Beings Between Heaven and Earth — The Past Lives and Cultivation of Master Sa the Perfected

A Poem Says:

Autumn’s light departs, yet spring returns anew,  
The ravening hare hastens as if a turning wheel.  
At last I trust that fame and rank are but external things,  
Behold, wealth and honor like floating clouds appear.  
When joy is met, do not grieve the spirit’s rest,  
Life is easy to lose, like silver scattered at the edge.  
At leisure, let me tell the tale of former years,  
And behold the immortal Master Sa the Perfected.

From the primal chaos first divided, above is Heaven, below is Earth, and between them stands Man. Heaven, Earth, and Man—these are called the Three Talents. Yet the birth of man is countless and varied. Among them are kings and nobles, ministers and officials; not to mention those outside the scholar class—merchants, travelers, physicians, geomancers, physiognomists, diviners, artisans, fishermen, woodcutters, farmers, herders, musicians, and painters. How could one ever count all the ranks of beings? One sees in a single day countless deaths and births, but only a certain class observe the precepts purely, never sullied by the muddy waves of desire, never drifting in the sea of craving. They cultivate the heart, nurture the nature, perfect the essence, and solidify the spirit. Those who attain long life and unaging are called the numinous immortals. Where do these immortals dwell? After their ascent, they all reside above the Thirty-Three Heavens. A poem bears witness:

Beyond one heaven lies yet another,  
Layer upon layer, above the heavens dwell the immortals.  
Immortals were once mere mortals,  
Yet fear that mortal hearts are not yet firm.

This volume speaks solely of the immortals. In the former Five Dynasties, there was a man surnamed Sa, given name Shoujian, a native of the Western River region of Shu. He was honored as a Perfected Immortal, appointed by the Jade Emperor to oversee the celestial pivot, entering and exiting the Hall of Radiance. Beneath the Jade Emperor’s chariot, he stood alongside Master Zhang, Lord Xu, and others as colleagues, sharing rank with the Three Officials and Four Saints. Who under Heaven does not know this immortal? Yet how easily is one made an immortal in Heaven? It is only by cultivating fate through three lifetimes that one attains such a position. What then was Master Sa’s cultivation in his previous lives?

At first, he was but a butcher, surname Wu, given name Cheng. In youth, his strength was robust. Watch him slaughter oxen, butcher pigs, and flay sheep with skillful hands—his technique was like Bao Ding dissecting an ox, or Zhu Ping’s method of butchering dragons. One day he might kill one or two oxen, or flay three or four sheep, or butcher five or six pigs. He was like the swift executioner before the hall of Yama, a grim reaper hastening death among livestock. At thirty years of age, the lives he took were countless. One day, passing by a school, he heard the clear chanting of books: “A gentleman toward birds and beasts, seeing their lives, cannot bear their deaths; hearing their cries, cannot bear to eat their flesh.” He sighed deeply, saying, “My life has been in error.” From then, he abandoned his former ways—no longer killing oxen, no longer butchering pigs, no longer flaying sheep. Each morning at dawn, he burned incense, recited Buddha’s name a few times, and wrote admonitions: “Good begets good reward, evil begets evil retribution; if neither comes, the time has not yet arrived.” Also: “A family accumulating virtue will surely have surplus blessings; a family accumulating vice will surely have surplus calamities.” Approaching sixty, he passed away from illness.

On the day of his passing, the emissaries of impermanence first led him to the Eastern Peak Mansion to meet the Benevolent and Sacred Great Emperor. The Benevolent Sacred Emperor, knowing that Wu Cheng had spent half his life as a butcher and the other half reciting Buddha’s name and cultivating virtue, judged that he need not pass through the Underworld. He wrote an official document and sent it straight to the Underworld King Yanluo, saying: “Wu Cheng slaughtered living beings thirty years ago, but for thirty years has recited Buddha’s name and cultivated virtue. Should he still undergo reincarnation?” Yanluo replied, “This person has turned from evil to good and is a good man. Let him not come to the Yin realm.” He then ordered two soul guides to escort him to a good place, born into a wealthy family, where his life would be one of ease and plenty, with three hundred fields and a hundred granaries, clear water fish ponds, and grand houses. The soul guides led Wu Cheng to be reborn in Liang Prefecture into a family surnamed Chen. This was the first life of Master Sa’s cultivation.

Now, as for Master Sa’s second life: his surname was Lu, given name You. He had no elder brothers nor younger siblings, inheriting solely a portion of his grandfather’s estate, which he enjoyed fully. Though his fields were not contiguous, they numbered several hundred acres. His wealth, though not vast to the point of decay, was enough to be counted in tens of thousands of strings of cash. Though no twelve beauties adorned his embroidered screen, he had one wife and one concubine. He had servants to accompany him, never lacking fish for meals nor carts for travel. In summer, he wore fine hemp cloth; in winter, light furs. Though not a great magnate, he lived independently without needing to ask favors. Others in such a station might scheme or steal—perhaps pilfering Han Shou’s incense, or stealing Xiao Lang’s jade, or scaling Zhang Sheng’s painted walls. But Lu You was honest and straightforward.

One day, residing in his manor, a young woman of about seventeen or eighteen years appeared:

Her emerald brows parted like the willow leaf’s eight strokes,  
Her vermilion lips adorned with a single cherry dot.  
Delicate as Lady Wen, with a slender, slight waist,  
From her sleeves emerged jade-like fingers, tender and fine,  
Beneath her skirt, golden lotuses peeked,  
Her footsteps were coy and graceful.  
Truly, she surpassed even Wang Zhaojun plucking the pipa on horseback,  
Or the Qin maiden playing the phoenix flute from the tower.

This young woman was returning to her mother’s home for a visit when suddenly a fierce storm arose. The clouds blackened like spilled ink, the rain poured like a tipped basin, thunder roared like the smashing of the Ji’an stele, and the wind bent bamboo and broke trees like a boat capsizing on the Wu River. The young woman, helpless, sought shelter in Lu You’s manor. She planned to leave once the storm passed, but the rain fell from noon until dusk. When she wished to depart, the roads were dark and forbidding, so she stayed the night at Lu You’s estate. Seeing she had not eaten, Lu You ordered the servants to slaughter a chicken, cook a bowl of rice, and prepare some dishes. The young woman ate with her mouth but pondered in her heart: “This gentleman is so courteous; tonight he surely will think of me. I might as well express my feelings first.”

In conversation, she grew intimate with Lu You. After the meal, Lu You said, “Young lady, this manor has only one servant family. The master’s wife is visiting her family; otherwise, I would arrange a room for you to rest. But men and women lodging together is inconvenient.” The young woman replied, “That is no trouble.” Lu You said, “There are only two main rooms here; other bedding is untidy. It would be difficult to have you sleep elsewhere. You may sleep on my bed; I will make other arrangements.” Seeing Lu You was young and handsome, her spring heart stirred. Awaiting to share his bed, she thought to herself, “I shall hold the rain and clouds, and rest here for one night like a post station.” Yet Lu You was a man of principle, emulating Guan Yu’s steadfast virtue, keeping the lamp burning late, and reciting a poem:

Rites and laws shine as bright as the sun,  
The moral order weighs as heavy as mountains.  
Be wary of lustful desires between men and women,  
Lest the sages’ leisure be disrupted.  
Though Zhuo’s lady is famed for beauty,  
Xiangru’s charms are not to be spoken lightly.  
One must fiercely examine life,  
And break through the barriers of thought.

The young woman climbed into bed, loosened her fragrant silk sash, removed her red-sleeved jacket, and lay beneath the red gauze canopy. Unconsciously, her heart stirred. At the second watch, unable to restrain desire, she turned and said, “Sir, you might as well sleep here with me.” Lu You replied, “Men and women should not touch; how much less share a bed?”

Seeing Lu You sitting by the lamp, seemingly indifferent to her charms, she rose, dressed, and said, “Sir, my coming today is not by chance. It is a match made by Heaven. Staying at your noble manor, seeing your gentle and jade-like nature, I truly love you. Why not sleep close, chest to chest, entwined as lovers, sharing joy like fish swimming in spring waters?” Lu You said, “This cannot be. Young lady, you are a virtuous woman with a husband; I am a son of a respectable family with a wife. If you seek friendship with me, how can you forget your husband? If I seek friendship with you, how can I forget my wife? This matter must not be done.” The young woman said, “My coming today is unfortunate. If I befriend you, people will talk; if I do not, people will talk as well. Is this not like carp and crucian swimming together without distinction?” Lu You said, “True is true, false is false. Have you not heard: ‘Only in clear water can two kinds of fish be seen’?”

The young woman, seeing Lu You’s stern and righteous refusal, was helpless and left at dawn. This matter is not further recounted here. Yet who knew that Lu You’s good heart was reported by the local earth god to the celestial bureau above and the underworld below?

That was not the end. One day, Lu You was hoeing the garden and planting flowers when he unearthed a cache of gold, about five hundred taels. Lu You said, “My family’s wealth is sufficient; why seek more? This must be given to those in poverty.” So he dug up the gold. The next day, at the crossroads, he distributed it widely. Widows, orphans, and the lonely came in crowds, filling the streets. Lu You gave one tael where one was due, five qian where five were due, and in an instant the five hundred taels were all given away.

Yet more came—some crippled, some blind, some hunchbacked—limping or stumbling, taking two steps for one, two miles for one, just arriving at the crossroads as the gold was all gone. Lu You then ordered his servants to fetch fifty more taels from home to continue the distribution, finally completing his charity. Those who received blessings spoke loudly, “Lord Lu You is kind and righteous,” “Lord Lu You has a good heart.” Their voices reached the mysterious firmament above and the shadowy netherworld below. The Yin realm recorded this good deed in its ledger.

Lu You lived to the age of sixty-five and then passed away peacefully. On the day of his passing, the emissaries of impermanence first brought him to meet the Benevolent and Sacred Great Emperor of the Eastern Peak. The emperor, knowing that Lu You had dwelt with a woman without lust, and had found and distributed five hundred taels of gold to the poor, judged that he should not undergo reincarnation. He wrote a brief official document and sent it to the Underworld, saying: “Such and such.” The King Yanluo ordered the officers of reward and punishment to check the records, and finding these two deeds, said: “This man was not deluded by beauty, nor greedy for gold. He has overcome great karmic obstacles and must cultivate further. If his precepts are strict, he shall attain the true fruition.” Thus, the document was returned to the Eastern Peak Mansion, ordering the emperor there not to send Lu You to the Underworld, but to have soul guides escort him to be reborn in the human realm, to experience worldly affairs fully, and then become an immortal. This was Master Sa’s second life of cultivation.

But how he fared as an immortal in this life—let us unfold in the chapters below.
