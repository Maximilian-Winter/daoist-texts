# Chapter Two: Master Sa Enters the Yamen as an Official — Master Sa Mistakenly Prescribes Medicine

Now, it is told that the former incarnation of Master Sa, having cultivated through two lifetimes, once again followed the Soul-Calling Boy to be born in Xihe County, in the western reaches of Shu. At that time, there was a man named Sa, with the courtesy name Ruwang, married to a wife surnamed Cao. The couple had sown many good roots, yet after thirty years remained childless. Cao’s heart longed deeply for a child, and after three years of yearning, one day she found herself with child. One afternoon, while resting with her husband, she dreamed of a flying phoenix alighting upon her body, and in this vision she beheld:

Nine splendid plumes, rare and noble; five brilliant hues, radiant and resplendent.  
The nine splendid plumes drank in the numinous essence of Heaven and Earth;  
The five brilliant hues shone with the literary brilliance of the cosmos.  
Majestic as the auspicious signs of Yu’s court, ethereal as the omens of Qishan.  
It is said the phoenix rests not on any wutong tree, nor feeds on any bamboo fruit.  
Behold, it gathers in this wondrous dream, destined to soar at the appointed time.  
O phoenix, O phoenix, descending to survey virtue’s radiance;  
O phoenix, O phoenix, spreading wings to rise on high.  
This phoenix is the portent of the Sa lineage’s immortal seed,  
Not the pleasure-seeker riding in Qin’s towers or Xiao’s chambers.

After Cao recounted this dream to her husband Ruwang, he replied, “I too have had dreams—this surely heralds a good son.” When the tenth month drew near, a great big Eucommia bark and a small ginseng root were seen. Master Sa’s father ordered Liu Jinu to take aconite from the top and hang it with honeysuckle; before the incense was lit, he softened the large belly’s skin gently. Then, the Ophiopogon flower blossomed wide. In a moment, a clove-sized child was born. Ruwang and Cao were overwhelmed with joy and named him Shoujian.

From birth, the child was bright and gifted, his nature extraordinary and precocious. As a boy, he excelled at reading, devouring books with a mind full of treasures—ten thousand scrolls, ten lines at a glance. He was skilled in calligraphy, his brush strokes like iron paintings and silver hooks, coiling dragons and crouching tigers in form. He was adept at poetry, his verses falling like coughs from the ninth heaven, pearls and jade born on the wind. He was gifted in composition, his writings like dragons’ patterns filling a hundred bushels’ cauldron, his pen’s force able to bear great weight alone.

With such learning, Master Sa was clearly a prodigy. People said, “He will rise to high rank as easily as picking weeds from the earth, win his degrees as simply as plucking hairs from the brow.” Yet little did they know that the Lord of the Underworld wished to test his discipline, bringing many trials and changes. At the tender age of nine, his father passed away, then his mother followed. What father had Master Sa to rely on? What mother to support him? Alone and forsaken, like a fledgling crow lost without its mother’s milk, he cried and cooed pitifully indeed!

As he grew, food and clothing became scarce. Suddenly, an imperial edict came down, ordering every county elder to select promising youths to serve as agricultural clerks. The elders of Xihe County recommended Master Sa. He tried to refuse, but was compelled to serve in the county office. Though a kind-hearted man, the duties were no light matter. It would have been better to be assigned to the clerical office managing documents, or the ritual office overseeing sacrifices and the reception of officials, or the household office handling finances, or the workshop office supervising artisans, or the military office managing soldiers. Yet fate placed him squarely in the penal office.

Once inside the penal office, guilt and innocence blurred; one had to employ cunning tricks, wield pen and blade alike.

One night, a man broke into the stable and stole a fine steed. The rain had just ceased. The horse’s owner traced the tracks at dawn for over twenty li, finally finding the horse at a certain household. The matter was reported to the authorities. Everyone said the horse thief was surely a mere petty criminal. The thief claimed the horse had escaped and he had taken it in. The magistrate ordered the penal office to investigate. The thief begged Master Sa to clear his name. Master Sa defended him with a written petition: “If one has the means to steal a horse, would one not also have the means to hide it? This horse may well have escaped and been taken in by someone else.” With these few words, the horse thief was declared innocent. The magistrate then turned the charge upon the horse owner. This is called “reversing the charge”: accusing the accuser of the crime himself.

Another case: a man owned a boat left unattended, which was stolen downstream and refitted as another vessel. When the boat was dismantled, the owner discovered it and reported: “At the third watch of night, the man came, beating drums and gongs, and seized a passenger boat, scattering its cargo, then dismantled its boards to rebuild another boat.” The magistrate, upon hearing this, judged: “The man stole goods but did not kill or injure; reduce the charge by one degree, commuting death to military service.” The man begged Master Sa to clear his military sentence. Master Sa petitioned the magistrate: “A passenger boat carrying goods surely has two or three guards. If drums and gongs sounded at night to seize the boat, if anyone escaped, they would have called for help from the shore; if no one escaped, they would have been killed by the thief. Yet the accusation only mentions the theft of the boat and scattering of goods, not the presence of people aboard. This is a baseless charge. To call an empty boat a cargo boat and to call drifting downstream a robbery is an unreasonable accusation.” With this defense, the magistrate clearly acquitted the man and reversed the charge upon the complainant, sentencing him to military service. But this matter is not worth further mention.

Once, a man had been involved with a woman for three years, their feelings deep. Later, the man took another woman, and the new love grew strong while the old affection waned. The first woman, resentful, repeatedly blocked the man from visiting the new woman’s home. As the saying goes, “Too much love breeds hatred; too much affection turns to enmity.” The woman said a word to the man, the man said a word to the woman. The man cursed the woman; the woman cursed the man. Unable to bear it, the man’s anger flared, his rage rising from his heart to his gallbladder. He struck the unfeeling woman with fists and kicked her with cruel toes, knocking her down and beating her dozens of times, kicking her dozens of times, until she died.

Truly:

A foolish woman and a faithless man—  
Once love turned to bitter hate.

The woman’s husband returned home to find his wife beaten to death and said, “This was no one else but the adulterer who killed her.” He reported this to the magistrate. Neighbors testified as well, saying the adulterer had indeed come from her home on the day she died. The magistrate sentenced the man to death. The man begged Master Sa to save him. Master Sa petitioned: “Though I had close ties with the woman, intimate as if sharing a chest, there was no beating or kicking. There was the appearance of holding rain and hanging clouds, but not the tragedy of overturning heaven and earth. The woman’s death was not at the hands of an adulterer, but by a rejected suitor who struck her.” The magistrate, seeing this petition, spared the man’s life, charging him only with adultery. The husband was accused of false testimony and questioned, “Should not the charge of selling one’s body be added?” This was the very place where Master Sa wielded pen and blade.

One day, news came that a conscript died at the post station, a soldier died at the frontier, and the adulterer died of rage. Master Sa then awakened, saying: “I have saved one life, yet condemned another. To give life and take life—what heart is this?” Using the excuse of “going to the countryside to pacify the region,” he abandoned his pen-and-blade career and fled to a distant town, never daring to return.

No longer an official, Master Sa thought, “The way of medicine is truly a benevolent art.” He purchased the Divine Farmer’s *Materia Medica*, Wang Shuhe’s *Pulse Classic*, and Sun Zhenren’s *Prescriptions After the Elbow*, studying them all thoroughly. Then, he disguised himself as a physician, and behold:

He inherited the art passed down from Master Xuanqi,  
His heart born of Heaven and Earth’s creatures.  
To probe a single root of illness, he must observe, listen, ask, and pulse;  
Diagnose the three parts’ subtle pulses, discerning emptiness, fullness, floating, sinking.  
To dispel chronic ailments and revive the paralyzed, he must know which wondrous formulas and rare medicines to use;  
To restore life from death, he must wield divine moxibustion and miraculous needles.  
He loves the clear springs of Su Dan and the orange wells,  
He admires Dong Feng’s flowers blooming red in the apricot forest.  
When illness strikes, he thinks only to aid the people and benefit all things;  
When prescribing, he seeks to nourish yang and nurture yin.  
He longs to spread the healing arts across the world, his heart full of compassion for living beings.

Master Sa practiced medicine with a heart overflowing with kindness, his marvelous medicines like divine gifts. He cured mute ones to speak, blind ones to see again, hunchbacks to straighten, cripples to walk upright, healed many with the five wounds and seven ailments, restored those with paralysis left or right, relieved urinary and bowel blockages, soothed heart and stomach pains unceasing, cured stubborn ulcers before and behind nails, and treated falling bladder and kidney ailments left and right. Master Sa’s skill was so great that all admired him, saying, “This healer is the reincarnation of Bian Que, the rebirth of Duke Lu.” Yet little did they know:

Even a fool’s thousand thoughts yield one insight;  
Even a wise man’s thousand thoughts yield one error.

One day, a man fell ill with great weakness and burning chills. The proper remedy was a single dose of the Ten-Perfect Great Tonic Decoction, yet Master Sa prescribed a purgative, and the man died at once. Another woman suffered postpartum fever, clearly caused by stagnant blood obstructing her; removing the stagnation would have healed her. Yet Master Sa gave her a great tonic, which sealed the stagnation, and she died. A small child, mute after convulsions, needed tonic to recover. Master Sa said, “This is phlegm confusing the mind; clear it and he will heal,” and gave a dose of sulfur and yellow powder to open the channels. The child died immediately.

Master Sa, struck by these three deaths, clasped his chest and mourned deeply, looking up to Heaven and sighing, “How difficult the way of medicine is!” Then he said, “Only a broken arm can make a good doctor; I have not learned this medicine by breaking my arm.” And again, “A doctor must not prescribe medicine before three generations; I have not inherited this art through generations.” He threw his medicine bag into the waves and set his medical books on fire. Filled with self-reproach, he composed a poem:

Life’s affairs are clumsy as a dove’s awkwardness;  
As official and healer, I have no merit.  
The official’s path is crooked and sly;  
The healer’s way unclear and mediocre.  
Mistaken medicines are like poison;  
The pen and blade dance sharper than spears.  
The most painful wound is to living souls;  
One thought, one regret, surges within.

Master Sa, thus filled with regret, pondered, “What path shall I now pursue to atone for past faults?” Then he reflected: “The path of cultivation is founded on compassion, its gate opened by skillful means. I shall leave the world and cultivate the dao, confessing and cleansing my past errors, to escape the suffering of rebirth.”

This single thought was the very root of his immortality. Let us see how the story unfolds.
