# Chapter Three: Master Sa Cultivates the Dao with Sincere Heart — Three Divine Immortals Bestow Magical Arts

Now it happened that Master Sa, having abandoned the art of medicine, took up the path of the dao. Upon his head he wore a simple daoist kerchief; on his body, a tattered robe; around his waist, a hempen cord; and on his feet, a pair of straw sandals. Once he entered the mysterious gateway, he suddenly grasped some immortal secrets, realizing that all human life is but ensnared and harmed by this “skin sack.” What is this skin sack? It is none other than the flesh-and-blood body. Once a person is bound by this vessel, they sink into the sea of desires and drift along the river of love. Is this not being ensnared and harmed?

Master Sa then intoned a “Lament on the Skin Sack,” saying:

> This skin sack, how obstructive it is,  
> A grievous plague upon my numinous platform.  
> Every step I take, it schemes and plots,  
> Left and right, it binds me in unease.  
> Tendons all tangled, flesh a lump,  
> Binding the hundred bones into the Four Great Elements.  
> There is hunger, thirst, poverty’s sting,  
> Disease, disaster, decay’s cruel hand.  
> Begging for food, craving for clothes,  
> Yet more, lust for glory and worldly ways.  
> My heart finds no rest, debts born from the start,  
> Reflecting deeply, truly unbearable.  
> Summoning legions of demons hard to restrain,  
> Breeding five ghosts and three corpses,  
> Nourishing eight evils and six harms.  
> Excrement, urine, limbs, pulse and blood congealed—  
> What charm is there to behold?  
> Nine orifices all foul pits,  
> Six gates a chaotic mess.  
> Falling into the Three Paths, sinking in the Six Paths,  
> All because this skin sack commands me so.  
> Now I know you are my enemy,  
> Thus I teach myself to loathe this life.  
> Seeking the enlightened master, seeking an easy road,  
> Only the method can bring me back.  
> Life springs from desire’s root,  
> Desire’s heart endless, no coming or going.  
> To sever desire’s heart, one must be steadfast,  
> Forsake attachment to the skin sack, lest one err.  
> Simple meals, coarse tea suffice for now,  
> Beyond that, greed and envy arise anew.  
> O master, do not yearn or look back,  
> Recognize the profound mystery within.  
> Hidden inside lies a great divine pearl,  
> Day and night its light forever shines.  
> Beyond words, beyond speech,  
> Neither heard by ear nor seen by eye.  
> Neither void nor fullness, nor middle ground,  
> Flickering bright, without fixed measure.  
> To nourish the skin sack, one must be purely simple,  
> From pure simplicity arises understanding and awakening.  
> Suddenly the heart awakens and sees clearly,  
> The skin sack transforms into a treasury of bright pearls.  
> Emitting light that pervades the dharma realm,  
> Inside and outside connected without hindrance.  
> Illuminating the noble transcendent,  
> Perfectly adorned with numinous powers.  
> No sin, no merit, no heaven or hell,  
> One day shedding this skin sack,  
> Free to roam unbound and unshackled.  
> Neither coming nor going,  
> Between arrival and departure no fixed abode.  
> Vast and boundless, shining through the empty heavens—  
> Who can seek the place where Buddhahood is made?

Having finished lamenting the “Skin Sack,” Master Sa reflected further that the human heart is inscrutable: restless, it survives; relinquished, it dies; coming and going without fixed time, unknown is its home. So from his lips he intoned the ever-memorized “Heart Sutra”:

> Avalokiteśvara Bodhisattva,  
> Practicing deeply the perfection of wisdom,  
> Clearly saw that the five aggregates are empty,  
> O Śāriputra, form is no other than emptiness,  
> Emptiness no other than form;  
> Form is emptiness, emptiness form.  
> So too are sensation, perception, volition, and consciousness.  
> O Śāriputra, all dharmas are marked with emptiness:  
> They neither arise nor cease,  
> Are neither defiled nor pure,  
> Neither increase nor decrease.  
> Therefore, in emptiness there is no form,  
> No sensation, perception, volition, or consciousness;  
> No eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, mind;  
> No color, sound, smell, taste, touch, or dharma;  
> No realm of sight, up to no realm of mind-consciousness;  
> No ignorance and no end of ignorance,  
> Up to no old age and death, and no end of old age and death;  
> No suffering, origination, cessation, or path;  
> No wisdom, no attainment, and no non-attainment.  
> Therefore, Bodhisattvas rely on the perfection of wisdom  
> And have no hindrance in their minds.  
> Because there is no hindrance, there is no fear,  
> Far beyond all inverted views,  
> Ultimately Nirvana.  
> The Buddhas of the three times  
> Rely on the perfection of wisdom  
> And attain Anuttara-samyak-sambodhi.  
> Thus, proclaim the mantra:  
> Gate gate pāragate pārasaṃgate bodhi svāhā.

Master Sa, devotedly cultivating, further thought: all dharmas ultimately return to one; without a master, who can transmit? At this moment he heard that in Jiangxi’s Guangxin Prefecture there was a Master Zhang Xujing; in Jiangxi’s Jianchang Prefecture, a Master Wang Fangping; and in Jiangxi’s Jiujiang Prefecture, an Immortal Elder Ge. These three were all masters of profound dao magic. Master Sa resolved to journey from Shu down to Jiangxi, first to Jiujiang to pay respects to Immortal Elder Ge, then from Jiujiang to Guangxin to visit Zhang Xujing, then from Guangxin to Jianchang to see Wang Fangping. He would take these three as his teachers and respectfully seek their wondrous dao.

It was the season of peach blossoms and willow greens. Having passed the Nine Streams and Eighteen Caves, and then the Twelve Peaks of Wushan, carrying some scattered grains of millet, he came straight to the mountain where the meeting of dragon, tiger, wind, and cloud took place, intending to learn the art of fire refining the elixir. He traveled by day and rested by night, trudging and hastening. He crossed many spring water ferries and many sunsets beyond mountain after mountain, until finally he emerged at a gorge’s mouth. Weary in spirit and body, he rested briefly in a pavilion, when suddenly three daoists appeared. One called himself “Daoist Jing,” another “Daoist Ping,” the third “Daoist Weng.” These three were none other than Zhang Xujing, Wang Fangping, and Immortal Elder Ge.

Seeing Master Sa’s sincere longing for the dao and his distant journey, the three conferred and decided to transmit their wondrous methods right there at the midway pavilion by the gorge’s mouth.

Master Sa, beholding these three venerable daoists, their immortal airs and daoist spirits, elegant and detached from mortal life, quickly rose and said, “Honored Daoists, this humble daoist bows deeply.” The three promptly returned the greeting, saying, “Daoist, please do not be offended.” Master Sa then inquired, “May I ask your honorable surnames and names? From which places do you hail?” Zhang Xujing said, “I am Daoist Jing.” Wang Fangping said, “I am Daoist Ping.” Immortal Elder Ge said, “I am Daoist Weng. We are all natives of Jiangxi.” Daoist Jing then asked Master Sa, “May I ask your honorable surname and name? From which region do you come?” Master Sa replied, “This humble daoist is from Xihe in Shu Commandery, surname Sa, given name Shoujian.” Daoist Jing asked, “You have come here—what is your destination now?” Master Sa said, “I intend to go to Jiangxi, to pay respects to Zhang Xujing, Wang Fangping, and Immortal Elder Ge, three masters, and to respectfully receive their dao methods.” Daoist Jing said, “Xujing, my dao friend, has already passed away.”

Master Sa was startled and asked, “If Master Xujing is dead, is Master Wang Fangping still alive?” Daoist Ping said, “I am from Jianchang, neighbor to Wang Fangping, but he too has passed away.” Master Sa was again shocked and asked, “If Masters Zhang and Wang are both dead, is Immortal Elder Ge still among the living?” Daoist Weng said, “Immortal Elder Ge was also my dao friend, but he passed away many years ago.”

Hearing that all three masters had died, Master Sa looked up to Heaven and sighed, saying, “I have no fate to reach this place.” Tears welled and fell. Daoist Jing said, “Daoist, do not grieve. Though Xujing has died, his son now holds the title of Heavenly Master, and his dao methods remain profound. I have an old acquaintance with him. I have a letter here, which I meant to entrust to someone. Now it is better to give it to you. Go to visit him, and he will surely transmit the dao methods.” Then from his sleeve he produced a slip of paper and handed it to Master Sa. Master Sa accepted it and asked, “How far is it from here to Xin Prefecture in Jiangxi?” Daoist Ping said, “Cloudy mountains piled high, rivers vast and flowing—very far, very far indeed.” Daoist Weng said, “Daoist, on your journey you will need plenty of provisions. I will teach you the method of the ‘Enchanted Jujube.’” Master Sa asked, “What is this method of the enchanted jujube?” Daoist Weng said, “Simply recite the incantation, and the jujubes will naturally grow large, as big as pears. Each day, chant over nine jujubes, eating three each time, and you will be full for a whole day, needing no other cooked food.” Then he taught the secret words, instructing Master Sa to chant thus:  
“Ram’s horn, ram’s horn,  
Deer antler, deer antler,  
Yan he mo ni ba fu hong.”

Master Sa followed the instructions, and indeed, jujubes silently appeared in his sleeve. These jujubes were described as:

> Bright and pure as white blossoms,  
> Tall and red as vermilion.  
> Crisp as sugar candy, sweet as honey.  
> Solid as Han Yan’s golden pellets,  
> Sweet as the red duckweed of Chu.  
> Filial as Zeng Shen to his parents,  
> Honest as Wang Ji to his departed wife.  
> Clever as Man Qian in guessing covers,  
> Loyal as Xiao Rou in offering true heart—  
> How could such devotion not be repaid with fierce loyalty?

Master Sa gratefully received the method of the enchanted jujube and thanked Daoist Weng profusely. Daoist Ping said, “Since Daoist Weng has passed on the enchanted jujube method, I have nothing more to teach. But I do possess a palm-leaf fan that cures illness. One wave cools fever, two waves bring chill, three waves make the bones shudder, and the sickness is cured. Moreover, this fan can return the souls of the deceased. For those who die suddenly, if they have not yet reached sixty years, and have talismanic scripts affixed to their bodies, waving this fan over them will bring them back to life. Hence it is also called the ‘Returning Soul Fan.’” Master Sa asked, “How can this palm-leaf fan have such wondrous power?” Daoist Ping said, “This palm leaf does not grow elsewhere; it comes from a stone cliff on Mount Sumeru, having endured thousands of kalpas. It has drunk countless heavenly dews and endured many frosts and snows, embodying pure yin essence—a treasure of Heaven and Earth. My master, Daoist Xu Wu, gathered it and fashioned this fan, hence its marvelous power. I now pass it to you.” Then he taught two talismanic scripts. Master Sa bowed and accepted them, deeply moved.

Daoist Jing said, “The three of us have met Master Sa. Since the other two have bestowed their teachings, I too shall reveal my lifelong magical arts.” He taught Master Sa the “Great Method of the Five Thunders,” instructing him to hold the spirit within the heart, exhale with the mouth, perform hand seals, and tread the cosmic pattern beneath the feet. He sent forth thunder gods to command the thunder generals, stirring the wild thunder of the five directions. He further taught: the pig hour is the Heavenly Gate, where heavenly fire is kindled; the earth trigram is the Earth Gate, where earthly fire arises; the rabbit hour is the Thunder Gate, where thunder fire blazes; the fifth and first earthly branches kindle the fire of thunderclaps; the snake, horse, and goat hours summon the blazing true fire of the sun’s samadhi. The thunder roared fiercely, shaking heaven and earth; the fire blazed fiercely, scorching mountains and fields. With this method, evils are driven away and demons subdued—this is called the “Five Thunder Method.” Master Sa again bowed deeply in thanks.

Thus, the three daoists each imparted their methods to Master Sa, then took their leave. Master Sa was full of mixed feelings.

Yet whether the methods they transmitted would prove efficacious or not, remains to be seen. Let us watch the unfolding story.
