# Chapter Four: Master Sa Tests the Marvelous Methods Along the Way and Subdues the Malevolent Frenzied Spirit

Now it happened that Master Sa, having received the teachings of the Three Daoist Teachers, journeyed onward, applying their methods—and indeed, all came to pass as foretold. How was this verified? One day, Master Sa arrived at the region of Yunyang, where no village lay before him, no inn behind. Unconsciously, hunger gnawed at his belly, so he chanted an incantation over some jujubes and ate them. Spreading out his sleeve, behold—the jujubes suddenly appeared! It was unknown whether they fell from Heaven above, or welled up from Earth below, or were sent by ghosts and spirits. Master Sa took three and ate them; his hunger was immediately quelled.

Further on, he reached the region of Xiangyang, where he saw a household hastening craftsmen to make a coffin for the dead. Master Sa inquired, “For what purpose is this coffin being made?” One replied, “My father is gravely ill and near death; thus we prepare this coffin.” Master Sa asked, “Why not summon a physician to heal him?” The man answered, “Many medicines have been taken, but none proved efficacious.” Master Sa said, “I shall treat him for you.” He then took out his palm-leaf fan and waved it over the old man. With one wave, the fever retreated; with two, coolness arose; with three, every hair on his body stood on end—and the illness was instantly cured. The man prostrated himself, saying, “My father has received the grace of life; such Heaven’s favor is beyond repayment!” Master Sa quickly helped him up, saying, “To aid others and benefit all beings is the very duty of one who has left the household life; there is no need for bows or kneeling.” Soon after, the man offered ten taels of white silver in thanks. Master Sa replied, “I am a recluse of the Way; I have no use for such silver,” and refused it, departing.

Not half a day’s journey later, a mournful cry was heard, lamenting: “Young son, young son! Zeng Shen could not nurture Zeng Xi, Yan Lu mourned for Yan Hui.” Master Sa’s heart was moved, and he said, “This must be the wailing of one who has lost a child.” He went to the house and saw an old man. Master Sa asked, “Old sir, why this bitter weeping?” The old man said, “I was fifty years old when I first had a son; now he is but nineteen, and suddenly he has died. I am old and without an heir; thus I grieve.” Master Sa asked, “How long since your son died?” The old man replied, “His breath has but recently ceased.” Master Sa said, “Then you need not weep so bitterly; I can bring him back to life.” He affixed two talismanic scripts upon the body and waved his palm-leaf fan. Suddenly, the dead youth stirred and soon rose again. The father embraced him, weeping, “I thought father and son would never meet again—how fortunate that your soul returns!” Then he asked his son, “How did you return from the other world?” The son said, “I had just reached the realm of the Underworld when two messengers suddenly chased after me, saying, ‘Return quickly, return quickly.’ Then I felt a breeze beneath my arms and flew back with them.” The father pointed to Master Sa and told his son, “This gentleman is the one who saved your life.” Father and son knelt together, bowing deeply twice. Master Sa saw their reverence and quickly returned their bows, saying, “You are my elders; please rise, please rise.” The old man again offered gold and silk in thanks. Master Sa said, “I am a recluse of the Way; I have no need for such wealth. Please return it.” They parted with mutual respect.

One day, Master Sa came to the region of Wuchang and again heard the sound of weeping: “Young husband, your son is but a child, your wife alone—how can you leave for the Nine Springs?” Master Sa’s heart was deeply moved with sorrow and he went to the house. There he saw a woman about twenty-two or twenty-three years old, her bearing gentle and serene, tears flowing endlessly from her eyes, as if:

> Her jade-like face lonely, tears dripping down the balustrade,  
> A pear blossom branch in spring, still wet with rain.

Master Sa asked, “Young lady, why such bitter weeping?” The woman wiped her tears and said, “My husband was but twenty-three when he died suddenly, leaving behind a son of only five years and me, alone and desolate. This is why I weep.” Master Sa asked, “How long since your husband died?” She said, “Not long—only a few moments.” She wept again. Master Sa said, “Young lady, no need for such grief. Since your husband’s death is so recent, I can bring him back.” He placed two talismanic scripts upon the body and waved his palm-leaf fan. The dead man stirred and soon revived. The young couple, husband and wife, seeing each other alive again, embraced and wept—this cry was even more heartrending: “Like paired birds nearly torn apart by a fierce hawk.” Then the wife asked her husband, “How did you return to life?” He said, “I had reached the Naihe Bridge, about to cross over, but hesitated, fearing danger. Suddenly two messengers appeared, took my hand, and said, ‘Return, return.’ Before they finished speaking, a cool breeze rose beneath my arms, and I flew back.” Master Sa stood nearby. The wife said, “It is by this gentleman’s power that my husband lives again.” The couple knelt and bowed deeply. The husband said to Master Sa, “Sir, you have given me a second birth.” Master Sa said, “Though I revived you, it is also because your fated ties were not yet severed. Please rise; no need to bow.” Deeply grateful, the couple wished to repay Master Sa but had nothing suitable. The woman offered her jewelry and clothing as thanks. Master Sa said, “To aid the people and benefit all beings is the very duty of one who has left the household life; there is no need for thanks.” He returned the jewelry and clothes and took his leave.

Master Sa then journeyed to the region of Jiujiang, where he saw a household plagued by a man possessed by a malevolent spirit. The man was maddened, his head bare of hat, body stripped of clothes, feet without shoes or socks—naked as the day he was born. Wherever he found filth, he ate it; wherever urine was, he drank it; and he would seize women to make mischief. His parents chained him at home, beating him with peach branches and willow rods from dawn till dusk, yet no marks appeared on his body, nor did he show pain. At night, he would break free, escaping the chains. His parents would lock him up again, adding locks to locks, chains to chains, confining him behind heavy doors. But the next night, he would break free once more, unlocking chains and doors alike.

Helpless, his parents summoned a dharma master. They sent the household servants to fetch one, and soon a dharma master arrived with four brothers—five in all—to assist in the rites. Proud and confident, one said, “Master, this spirit is fierce indeed. You must apply yourself fully.” The master replied, “My dharma is supreme, my methods wondrous. I have overturned the altar of Lord Zhao and shattered the temple of Lord Yan. Such a demon is no match for me.” They set up two high altars—one for the chief master, one for the assistant. The two other masters each forged a ball of fiery energy, blowing their ritual horns with mournful wails; they shook their ritual knives, sounding sharp and clear; and summoned the gods of the Five Rogues and the Five Young Lords.

The chief master wore a fiery bowl atop his head; the assistant held a ritual whip. Together with the three protective disciples, they entered the madman’s room. The possessed man lifted his head, resembling a monkey spirit, his eyes like a fierce golden-eyed beast. The chief master shouted a command; the spirit shouted back. The master shouted twice; the spirit echoed twice. The chief master’s face flushed with anger and fury; he struck the fiery bowl atop his head with a “puff,” but the spirit blew on it, sending the sparks spinning wildly. The master’s hair and eyebrows were singed, but the evil spirit remained unscathed.

Frustrated, the chief master blew his horn to summon the army of the Mad Ones, greatly enhancing his power. Unexpectedly, the spirit flicked his hand, and the horn floated high in the void, never to return. The chief master, enraged, swung his ritual knife, but the spirit flicked his hand again, and the knife too floated high in the empty air. The chief master tumbled, threatening to overturn Heaven’s gates and shake Earth’s axis, but the spirit pointed a finger and suspended him to the east. Seeing this, the assistant master struck with his whip but was also flicked by the spirit’s hand and suspended in midair. He too tumbled, attempting to rescue the chief master by shaking Heaven’s gates and Earth’s axis, but the spirit pointed again and hung him to the west.

There they hung—two masters dangling in midair without ropes or chains, while the spirit played tricks, banging their heads and hands together until their hands split open and their heads cracked. It was like two pounding mallets, striking and splitting in turn, a game of hit and open, open and hit—what a spectacle!

The three protective disciples, seeing their chief and assistant masters suspended, were terrified and dared not tumble or strike the fiery bowl. They hurried outside and beat their ritual plaques, calling out: “Heaven’s generals, Earth’s soldiers, Fire’s masters, Thunder’s gods, Old Mother of Mount Lu, True Lord of Maoshan, Five Rogues and Five Young Lords, hasten swiftly!” Before they finished, the frenzied spirit emerged, grabbing two of the disciples—throwing one to the left, one to the right. Then with a press of his hand on one’s head and a lift on the other’s, it was as if a thousand pounds of crushing weight pinned them motionless. Only one disciple, seeing this, fled in panic.

All watching laughed and clapped, saying, “What a master who overturned Lord Zhao’s altar! What a master who broke Lord Yan’s temple! The master did not chase away the frenzied spirit; instead, the evil spirit chased away the master.” The dharma master paid no heed to their laughter and ran off, gasping for breath. After two miles, he met Master Sa. Sa asked, “Master, why such haste?” The master, panting, said, “In a certain village, a household is plagued by a frenzied spirit. My four brothers and I went to treat him, but two were hung up, two were crushed, and only I escaped. I have never seen such a fierce demon.” Master Sa said, “Go back; I will drive it away for you.” The master shook his head. “Old sir, do not take it all on yourself. This spirit said he would deal with all five of us, but only I came and went freely. If you go, you will just fill the numbers.” Master Sa said, “My methods differ from yours. I shall go.” The master said, “My dharma is high, but this demon is several times stronger than me.” Sa asked, “Will you dare return?” The master said, “Like a hooked fish escaping the golden hook, wagging its tail and shaking its head—I will never come back.” And with that, he fled.

What a man, Master Sa! Hearing how these dharma masters were hung and crushed by the evil spirit, how could he not go to save them? A living being, so thoroughly maddened—how could he not treat him? So he went alone to the frenzied spirit’s home. There he saw the man, hair wild, eyes yellow, naked as ever. He saw the two masters hung in midair and the two crushed on the ground. Master Sa ascended the ritual altar, summoned the spirits, calmed the qi, and moved his palms, invoking the Thunder Lords of the East—Jia and Yi Wood Thunder Lords; of the West—Geng and Xin Metal Thunder Lords; of the South—Bing and Ding Fire Thunder Lords; of the North—Ren and Gui Water Thunder Lords; and at the center—the Wu and Ji Earth Thunder Lords. He then kindled the Heavenly Fire, Earthly Fire, Thunder Fire, Thunderclap Fire, and the Sun’s Samadhi True Fire. Thunder roared, fire blazed; the thunder’s sound shook Heaven and Earth, the fire’s flame burned all before it. In an instant, the fire and thunder forces seized the frenzied spirit.

The spirit knelt on both knees, bowing his head and knocking his forehead, crying, “Immortal Master, spare my life! Spare me!” Master Sa asked, “What spirit are you? Speak truthfully.” The spirit said, “I am the essence of the local village’s malevolent spirit. Thirty years ago, I took the fortune and treasure of this household. This family has honored me yearly with offerings. But in the past six or seven years, they have not poured a cup of plain wine nor burned a bundle of paper money. The lesser spirits are displeased and thus bring disaster. I beg the Immortal Master’s mercy.” Master Sa said, “By your own account, the blame is not yours alone; the household is also at fault. I now command your household to resume their offerings as before. You must reform and cease your mischief.” The spirit said, “I dare not do so again.” Master Sa said, “Release the two hung masters and help the two crushed ones up.”

In a moment, the spirit pointed east and west; the two hung masters slowly descended from the void. Then with a flick of his left and right hands, the two crushed masters slowly rose from the ground. Soon after, the ritual horn, knife, and whip all fell. The masters gathered their implements and bowed in thanks to Master Sa. They did not live on.

Now that the evil spirit had retreated from his frenzy, the man regained his true nature, overwhelmed with shame. He quickly combed his hair, donned a hat, put on clothes and shoes, and came to bow to Master Sa, saying, “I am deeply grateful for your grace in saving my life.” Master Sa said, “Your calamity was fated. But since the malevolent spirit once received your household’s protection, from now on you must not neglect his offerings.” The man promised and withdrew. His parents, grateful for Master Sa’s virtue, offered silver and gifts. Master Sa refused, saying, “Those four dharma masters suffered greatly on your behalf; you should thank them.” The parents followed Master Sa’s advice, completed their offerings, and Master Sa took his leave, heading straight to Guangxin Prefecture to meet the Celestial Master. Let us see what follows.
