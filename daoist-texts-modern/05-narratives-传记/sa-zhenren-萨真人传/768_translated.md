# Chapter Five: At Supreme Clarity, Meeting Celestial Master Zhang — Consulting the Register and Petitioning the Perfected One

Now it happened that Master Sa had subdued the spirits of the wraiths and specters, and journeyed onward in a winding path until he arrived at the Dragon and Tiger Mountain in Guixi, Guangxin Prefecture of Jiangxi. This very Dragon and Tiger Mountain was indeed a blessed land. Behold:

The mountain ridges stretched on endlessly, peak after peak; the waters curved and twisted like serpentine rivers. To the left lay the sinuous, winding Azure Dragon; to the right curled the stately, upright White Tiger. From the mountaintops rose wisps of pale, ethereal auspicious clouds; before the caverns gathered mists thick and luminous like radiant rosy dawn. The planted pines stood ancient and verdant, their green deep and pure; the bamboo grew tall and dense, sturdy and upright in their joints. Birds took flight and danced in the air—brilliant and resplendent were the purple orioles; cries and calls echoed—proud and secretive were the white cranes. Fragrant and delicate were the rare and wondrous jade blossoms; soft and tender grew the lush and velvety precious grasses. There were thirty-six palaces, each burning incense rich with musk, dragon’s bile, and fragrant ambergris; and seventy-two pavilions, each playing the faint, murmuring phoenix pipes and elephant tusk flutes. A poem bears witness:

> Clouds embrace the fungus chamber, full of worldly haze,  
> Jade flowers and precious grasses bloom in eternal spring.  
> A hermitage built high where none may reach,  
> At midnight, a new phoenix rests upon the green bamboo.

As for the grandeur of the Supreme Clarity Palace, we shall not dwell on it now. Master Sa, holding in his sleeve a letter from Daoist Jing, proceeded straight to pay homage at the Celestial Master’s mansion. The mansion’s scene was even more wondrous still. Outside the gate flowed several winding streams, clear and limpid, naturally forming silken ribbons; beyond the rivers rose layer upon layer of noble mountains, towering and majestic, like a painting opened by Heaven itself. Crimson towers rose abruptly, piercing the clouds; painted pavilions stood translucent and bright, dividing sun and moon in perfect balance. Master Sa entered the first gate, where on the lintel hung couplets reading:

> On the Qilin Hall, guests are immortals;  
> Within Dragon and Tiger Mountain dwells the prime minister’s home.

Passing through the first gate, he came to the second gate, where another couplet was displayed:

> Red clouds embrace white cranes returning—here lies a human cavern of wonder;  
> Precious grasses and jade flowers grow—why seek elsewhere for the Isles of the Immortals?

Having passed this gate, Master Sa ascended several flights of steps until he reached the hall of the Celestial Master. Upon seeing the Master, he kowtowed and said, “This humble Daoist comes from Western Shu. On the way, I met a Daoist named Jing, who said he had old ties with the Perfected One, and entrusted me with this letter. I humbly hope you will accept it.” The Celestial Master called for the attendant on duty to receive the letter and ordered Master Sa to wait in the corridor. Opening the letter, the Master saw it bore the handwriting of his father, Xu Jing, and burst into loud weeping, which soon roused his mother, Lady Yuan. She hurried out and asked, “Why does my son weep so bitterly?” The Master handed her the letter. Lady Yuan, astonished, exclaimed, “This is your father’s own writing!” She too broke into tears, then asked the Master, “From where did this letter come?” The Master replied, “Just now, a Daoist delivered it.” Lady Yuan asked, “Where is this Daoist now?” The Master said, “He waits in the corridor below.” Orders were given to summon him.

When Master Sa saw Lady Yuan, he prostrated himself. She asked, “From where did you receive this letter?” Master Sa replied, “I am a man of Xihe in Western Shu, drawn by the lofty spirit of Daoist Xu Jing, and also by the dao methods of the Three Immortals—Wang Fangping of Jianchang and Elder Ge of Jiangzhou. I came far to pay respects. At the Xiakou Pavilion, I met three Daoists: one was Daoist Jing, one Daoist Ping, and one Daoist Weng. They said that Daoist Xu Jing and the two gentlemen Wang and Ge had all passed on, but each transmitted to me their methods. This letter was sent by Daoist Jing.” Lady Yuan said, “According to what you say, Daoist Ping is Wang Fangping, Daoist Weng is Elder Ge, and Daoist Jing is Daoist Xu Jing himself.”

Hearing this, Master Sa was suddenly enlightened and said, “It is true, it is true! Were it not for these three masters, how could I have received such methods? The spells come one after another, saving the dying and reviving the dead, driving away evil and extinguishing malevolence.” Lady Yuan then said to the Celestial Master, “Let us see what your father’s letter says.” The Master carefully read aloud:

> My son Da, know this: I have shed my mortal coil,  
> And now roam the Jade Capital—this is not death.  
> You and your mother need not grieve.  
> You have inherited the Celestial Master’s seal;  
> You must fulfill your duties,  
> Carry on the immortal spirit of your ancestors,  
> And not disgrace the teachings—I earnestly hope this of you.  
> Strive, strive!  
> Master Sa of Xihe in Western Shu has come from afar to pay respects.  
> I, with the two immortals Wang Fangping and Elder Ge, have each bestowed upon him a method.  
> You must also present him with the Register of Merits,  
> Petition the Perfected One by name,  
> So that his methods may shine ever brighter—  
> This is the glory of our immortal lineage.  
> The treasured sword I leave behind may be entrusted to him.  
> No other words remain; my son, take these to heart.

When the Celestial Master finished reading his father’s letter, Lady Yuan and the Master said, “Since your father has commanded it, you must petition the Perfected One for Master Sa. You should obey and carry it out.” The Master said to Lady Yuan, “How could I disobey?” Lady Yuan withdrew to the incense chamber, and Master Sa bowed deeply in thanks. This, however, is not the main story.

Now, the matter of petitioning by name led Master Sa to accompany the Celestial Master to the Hall of the Three Clarities. What is meant by “Three Clarities”? They are the “Heavenly Venerable of Supreme Clarity, the Numinous Treasure,” the “Heavenly Venerable of Jade Clarity, the Primordial Beginning,” and the “Heavenly Venerable of Great Clarity, the Dao and Virtue”—these Three Clarities are the ancestors of the Daoist tradition. Hence, the Supreme Clarity Palace is built with halls dedicated to these Three Clarities.

At that moment, the Celestial Master arrived at the Hall of the Three Clarities and ordered the assembly of Daoist officials: the Supervisor, the Furnace Keeper, the Cauldron Keeper, the Confession Officer, the Scribe, the Music Officer, and a host of Daoist priests. They burned fragrant incense, thick and drifting; lit towering, brilliant candles; kindled lamps bright and dazzling; beat the clear, ringing drums; struck the resonant, magnificent bells; blew the piercing, clear flutes; played the faint, murmuring sheng pipes; and struck golden bells, jade cauldrons, and cloud zithers in turn.

The Celestial Master donned his ritual robes, crowned his ceremonial hat, grasped the elephant scepter, and performed the sacred rites, chanting:

> The Great Ultimate divides the high and thick,  
> The light and clear ascend to Heaven.  
> If one cultivates the supreme dao,  
> The body becomes a true immortal.  
> Practice reaches three thousand counts,  
> Time spans tens of thousands of years.  
> The Elixir Platform opens the precious lotus,  
> The golden mouth and water remain to transmit.

Then he intoned:

> I, Zhang Daoling, descendant of the mysterious lineage, Celestial Master so-and-so, with utmost reverence and fear, bow and kowtow.  
> Humbly petitioning for Master Sa Shoujian of Xihe in Western Shu, to be registered as a Perfected One,  
> So that his fragrant stream of methods may flourish,  
> And the Daoist immortal clan be extended.  
> I have no words sufficient to express my gaze toward Heaven and reverence for the Sage,  
> Nor my deepest sincerity in this solemn petition.

When the Master finished the petition, he burned the Register of Merits. As it burned, a plume of smoke flickered and shimmered, forming the two great characters “Perfected One,” which floated slowly and gracefully straight up to the Celestial Palace. At that moment, Master Sa knelt again, gazing upward in unspeakable joy. Having completed the petition, the Celestial Master removed his ritual robes and crown and returned to his mansion. Master Sa bowed again and again in gratitude.

Now, having petitioned the Perfected One, Master Sa wished to return to Shu and bid farewell to the Celestial Master. The Master, reluctant to part so soon, arranged a banquet to see off Master Sa. What delicacies were arrayed on the table? Pure and pristine immortal peaches; green and clear immortal wine; red and radiant immortal peaches; smooth and slippery immortal tangerines; round and flawless immortal jujubes. There were fragrant and savory eight treasures; beautiful and rich seven jewels soup. Truly, leopard fetus, bear paws, and purple camel humps were all expertly stir-fried; eagle breasts, orangutan lips, and golden carp tails—each a rare delicacy. Celestial Master Zhang played host, Master Sa the honored guest; the noble host and worthy guest toasted each other, drinking until the moon hung over the parasol trees and the silver arrows of the water clock signaled the hour.

Before long, dawn broke. Master Sa took leave of the Celestial Master and departed. At that time, the Master, following his father’s command, took out a treasured sword and handed it to Master Sa, saying, “This sword can sever evil and protect the dharma; cherish it well.” Master Sa received it with a bow. The Celestial Master’s affection was deep and reluctant to part; he even took up a sedan chair and accompanied Master Sa beyond the eastern outskirts. At parting, he composed a poem:

> You come from Shu and return to Shu again.  
> At the head of the white clouds in the heavens,  
> I gaze—where might you be?

Master Sa, moved by the Master’s fondness, could not bear to part either, and also composed a poem:

> Eight thousand li I journey to the Jade Capital,  
> Arriving there, joy overwhelms me.  
> Today we meet again only to part once more;  
> The blue clouds and green trees all hold our feelings.

With these exchanged poems, Celestial Master Zhang and Master Sa bowed and parted ways. Zhang returned to his mansion; Master Sa mounted the courier road. What misfortune or malevolent spirit he might encounter on the road, none could say. Let us see what unfolds next.
