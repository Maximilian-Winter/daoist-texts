# Chapter Six: Wang E Captures the Monkey and Horse Spirits; the Perfected One Extinguishes the Sacrificial Boys and Girls

Now, it is told that in the region of Xiangyin, within Hengzhou Prefecture, to the south of the Southern Mountain dwelt a wild monkey spirit, while to the north of the Northern Mountain roamed a wild horse spirit. What manner of monkey spirit was this? Behold:

A pair of eyes flashing bright as lightning,  
A tangled coat of fur all wild and tight.  
Lively hands that grasp and clutch,  
A supple waist, soft as such.  
Lightly it circled the trees with ease,  
Swiftly it raced across the leas.  
Cunning as the Monkey King of lore,  
Proud and fierce, a beastly demon of yore.

And what of that wild horse spirit? Observe:

A tail that swayed with gentle grace,  
A tangled mane that framed its face.  
Lively as a black steed’s stride,  
Swift as a gust that cannot hide.  
Faster than the famed Red Hare’s pace,  
Proud and mighty, none could face.  
Formidable demon beast of might,  
Strong and fierce, a tyrant’s blight.

These two spirits, the monkey to the south and the horse to the north, each held their ground, each possessed great power and numinous skill. The deer, the elk, the fox, the stag—when they saw these spirits, which among them did not tremble, crying out “Great King!” Even the tiger, called the Mountain Lord, upon seeing these two fiends would bow low, calling himself their junior. When these spirits unleashed their numinous power, they sent forth demon winds, exhaled strange airs, darkening the sky above and blackening the earth below. Any who stood before them would instantly grow dizzy and drowsy, as if struck by a narcotic, their bones soft and useless—how could they move at all? Some were dragged off by the monkey spirit, others seized by the horse spirit. Day by day, the monkey spirit took one or two, the horse spirit carried off three or four.

The villagers of that district wept bitterly: fathers lost their sons, crying for them; wives lost their husbands, mourning their loss; elder brothers lost younger, younger lost elder, all lamenting each other. The wails of grief echoed through Heaven and Earth. Whenever people gathered, none would say, “My son was taken by the monkey spirit,” but rather, “My father was seized by the horse spirit.” None would say, “My younger brother was dragged off by the monkey spirit,” but rather, “My elder brother was carried off by the horse spirit.” Truly, as the saying goes:

> “Do not speak of sorrow to the sorrowful,  
> For speaking of sorrow only deepens the sorrow.”

At this time there was a man named Wang E, a native of the prefecture, known for his fierce nature and extraordinary strength. One night, while traveling through the mountain valley, he saw a pillar of fire blazing upward. Wang E shouted loudly, and the fire immediately vanished. Marking the spot, the next day he dug there with his hoe and found a pit filled with pure iron, weighing over one hundred jin. Wang E took it home and called several blacksmiths, setting up several furnaces and burning hundreds of jin of charcoal to forge a steel whip. It was seen as follows:

Murderous aura surged forth, cold light fiercely gleamed.  
Forged and tempered, neither literary nor martial flame,  
Molded and cast, neither gold nor silver, but iron from the earth.  
Its angles and edges measured like a moderate vessel’s capacity,  
Its segments refined like the perfect spacing of bamboo joints.  
Swinging it felt neither light nor heavy, like a serpent in motion,  
Grasping it was neither long nor short, three feet of snowy steel.  

This whip could rival Hu Jingde’s blows upon Zhang Shigui without fail.  
This whip could match Zhao Xuantan’s exorcisms of ghosts and demons.

Having forged this whip, Wang E heard of the spirits in Xiangyin, devouring countless humans. He boldly declared: “In ancient times, Zhou Chu was but a mortal man who slew the dragon of Yixing’s waters and killed the white-foreheaded tiger of the Southern Mountain. Today, the wild monkey spirit is no more than the dragon of Yixing’s waters; the wild horse spirit no more than the white-foreheaded tiger of the Southern Mountain. Zhou Chu wielded a sword; I wield a whip. Tomorrow I shall surely rid these two scourges.”

Some urged him not to go, others encouraged him. Those who warned said, “Such spirits exhale demon airs that darken Heaven and Earth. If you provoke them, you will only seek your own death.” Those who encouraged said, “You are a valiant warrior, a fiery man—surely you will not fear a monkey spirit or horse spirit? If you do not go, you are no hero.”

Wang E, stoked by their words, blazed with fiery speech and smoke from his nostrils. Clad in a short shirt and skirt, tight socks, his head wrapped firmly, belt fastened securely, whip in hand, he strode straight to Xiangyin. First, he went south of the Southern Mountain to confront the monkey spirit. Fearing the spirit would not emerge, he disguised himself as a woodcutter, singing to lure it out:

> “Clouds drift softly, recalling the old woods,  
> On broken cliffs fragrant grasses make the path hard to find.  
> From the western hills I see the morning rain,  
> At the southern stream the crossing deepens on return.”

The monkey spirit, hearing the song from its cave, thought to drag the singer inside to tear sinew and skin, feasting with its monkey brood. It rushed out, only to meet its match. There stood Wang E: steel whip in hand, eyes bright as a Hui warrior’s, beard thick as steel needles, face dark as thunder god’s, tall as a celestial being. The spirit was greatly afraid but thought: “I exhale demon airs that darken Heaven and Earth, devouring thousands—how could I fear this man?” It grabbed a weapon from the cave and with a breath of demon air charged forth.

Wang E parted the demon wind and struck with his steel whip. The monkey spirit wielded an iron rod to oppose him. The whip danced with martial skill, the iron rod wielded numinous power. They clashed several times. Wang E’s strength was great; feigning a flaw, the monkey spirit struck, but Wang E parried with the whip and flicked its tip, causing the spirit to flee. Wang E pursued to the cave’s mouth and with a final strike ended the monkey spirit’s life. He then entered the cavern, striking each monkey and monkey spawn with his whip, scattering them like wind dispersing clouds, wiping them all away.

Having slain the monkey spirit, Wang E journeyed north of the Northern Mountain to confront the horse spirit. After waiting long, the horse spirit did not emerge. Wang E then disguised himself as a herdsman, singing:

> “I seek no fame within temple halls,  
> Resting on soft grass beneath the setting sun’s fall.  
> Rising, I find no yellow calves in sight,  
> Searching by fallen flowers and flowing streams’ light.”

The horse spirit, hearing the herdsman’s song outside the cave, thought: “This fool refuses Heaven’s path and stumbles before Hell’s gate.” It prepared to seize him, to feast with its horse brood. It rushed out, only to meet Wang E, whip in hand, eyes sharp as an owl’s, face dark as a barbarian’s, voice loud as Zhang Fei roaring at Baling Bridge. The spirit was afraid but thought: “I will exhale demon air to make his bones ache and soften, cloud his eyes—surely I will prevail.” It blew forth demon air and leapt forward.

But Wang E, rousing his spirit, was unaffected by the demon wind; his eyes did not dim, his bones did not ache. He raised his steel whip and struck at the horse spirit. The spirit leapt two or three zhang high, lunged to bite Wang E, then leapt again to kick him. Over and over, it attacked, but Wang E’s whip struck left and right, parrying each assault.

The horse spirit could not withstand and was struck by Wang E’s whip. It fled swiftly, Wang E tracking closely to the cave’s edge. The horse spirit did not expect Wang E’s pursuit and made no escape; another powerful strike ended its life. Wang E entered the cave and struck each horse and horse spawn, breaking skin and flesh, scattering soul and spirit, cleaning them all away.

After slaying these two fiends, the villagers came to see. South of the Southern Mountain, the monkey spirit’s cave was piled with dry bones; north of the Northern Mountain, the horse spirit’s cave was stacked with skeletons. None could help but shudder. Though Wang E had subdued the two spirits, he was exhausted by their demon airs and overexertion and soon died. The villagers mourned: “Such a hero, what a pity, what a pity.” They prepared clothes, coffins, and buried Wang E. This matter is left aside for now.

Meanwhile, the City God of Xiangyin, recognizing Wang E’s sacrifice in ridding the land of harm, declared him a martyr in life and a heroic spirit in death. He reported this to the Prefectural City God, who in turn reported to the Provincial City God, who petitioned the Jade Emperor. The Jade Emperor decreed Wang E to be a divine path spirit of Xiangyin, receiving blood offerings from the region, with an annual sacrifice. Wang E accepted the Jade Emperor’s decree and manifested his numinous power in Xiangyin. The locals built a grand temple in his honor, naming it the “Guangfu Temple,” and called the deity “King Guangfu.” Every year on the third day of the fourth month—the day of Wang E’s death—the villagers slaughtered pigs and sheep, cooked chickens and roasted geese, arranging the offerings neatly and respectfully.

At the temple on festival days, thousands of men and women would come to pay homage; incense burned in countless bundles, paper offerings consumed by the thousands. Yet who would know that this divine path spirit had once been a cruel man, and in death, a cruel god? One year, as the festival approached, the spirit suddenly spoke:

“You blessed households, I have served this land well,  
By the Jade Emperor’s decree, I receive blood offerings here.  
Each year you offer pig, sheep, chicken, and goose,  
Yet the taste is not refined. This year’s festival, I demand boys and girls for my feast.”

Hearing this, the blessed households trembled. Some brave souls knelt before the temple, pleading: “King, you are a god who aids the blessed, protector of this land—why do you harm the boys and girls of the people?” The spirit, angered by their words, said: “You residents disobey divine will, how detestable, how detestable!” In an instant, it summoned a fierce wind, a wind so violent:

One breath roared in fury, birds lost their nests in the shaken woods.  
Darkness fell before the ridge, waves rose high upon the river.  
Willows on the embankment snapped, thatched huts were torn away.  
Boats rocked and shattered, countless souls were lost.

After the wind came a great rain, so heavy:

At noon the sun was bright, when suddenly thunder startled all.  
Dark clouds merged from the earth, pouring torrents filled the sky.  
Waterfalls surged like the Milky Way, overturning the White Emperor’s city.  
Plains and fields vanished, transformed into a river’s breadth.

But the rain was not the worst; next came a hailstorm, fierce and cruel:

At first like lizards’ breath, then like shadows born anew.  
Churning seas and rivers, mountains cracked and stones shattered.  
Hard as silver bullets, shining like crystal bright.  
Do not say Heaven brings strange omens—these are punishments from ghosts.

This spirit’s wind was no ordinary wind. Other winds only blew leaves and scattered flowers; even great winds only broke branches, uprooted trees, or sent sand flying. But this wind rolled stones into rivers and blew people into the sky. The rain was no mere rain. Former rains only washed dust and broke petals; even great rains only broke banana leaves or dripped on peach blossoms. But this rain fell like a silver river pouring through Heaven’s moat, swift as waves crashing through sea gates. The hail was no ordinary hail. Former hailstones were only as large as beans or grains; even the largest like cherries or plums. But this hail was as large as buckets, as hard as stone, each weighing five or six jin.

See how this divine spirit, to win an argument, unleashed wind, then rain, then hail, laying waste to a great village: no tree left standing, no crop left growing, no tile left on roofs; ducks and geese in ponds were all struck down, birds on the hills all perished; travelers on the roads were seven out of eight injured; cattle and sheep in the fields were nine out of ten dead. When the storm ceased, the spirit asked: “Blessed households, will you offer boys and girls for my festival?” Seeing such devastation, the people had no choice but to agree.

The Guangfu Temple district had ten protective wards. These ten wards took turns providing sacrificial offerings. This year it was the first ward’s turn. The head of the first ward asked the eastern households for a boy: “My dear son, how could I part with him?” He asked the western households for a girl: “My precious daughter, how could I bear it?”

The ward leaders were helpless. The festival was near, the first day of the fourth month, and they feared missing the date if they sought elsewhere. There was a man named Liu Duan, wealthy and owning over fifty maids and seventy or eighty male servants. Liu Duan was cold-hearted; the servants and maids were not paired, and when girls reached twelve or thirteen, their desires awakened, and they learned to play the pipa. Among them was a clever young servant and a striking maid. The maid and servant exchanged glances full of longing. They slipped away to a quiet place to indulge their desires. At the peak of their passion, the maid embraced the servant, calling: “Dear brother, you make me so happy.” The servant embraced her, saying: “Dear sister, you make me so relaxed.”

But little did they know, “Walls have ears, windows have eyes.” Liu Duan came upon them, hearing clearly, smelling distinctly. He shouted. The maid and servant, naked, were caught in the act. Liu Duan summoned his household and brought them before the hall, saying: “You two have caused disorder; by family law, you shall be beaten to death.” The maid and servant begged for mercy, but Liu Duan said: “Very well. The Guangfu Temple festival requires boys and girls—why not offer you two to King Guangfu?”

Liu Duan’s words opened the door. Soon the festival leaders came to his home and took the maid and servant. They bathed them in fragrant water and, at the fifth watch the next day, brought them to the temple for sacrifice. They prepared the usual offerings of pigs, sheep, wine, and incense, placing the boy and girl on two trays. Normally, the festival required all ten wards to line up and kneel in worship, but with these children, the crowds were dismissed, and only one or two ward leaders remained to offer wine.

The ward leaders said the god only absorbed the spirits of the boys and girls, not their bodies. After two or three cups of wine, the god refused pig, sheep, chicken, or goose, eating only the children—removing their hair, toes, bones, and skin, consuming them alive. The ward leaders were terrified beyond words.

The first ward’s sacrifice passed without incident, but thereafter it became custom. Every year on the third day of the fourth month, one boy and one girl were offered. The second ward would follow with the third, the third with the fourth, and so on. At first, the second ward bought children from elsewhere, but by the third and fourth wards, only the ward’s own children were acceptable; purchased ones were rejected. This was not a case of “Without precedent, it cannot be established; with precedent, it cannot be abolished,” but rather: “With precedent, it cannot be established; without precedent, it cannot be abolished.”

Now, it happened that the Perfected One Sa, returning from the Upper Clarity Palace, passed through this place. At the road’s edge stood a house with banners and flags, inside bright lamps and fragrant incense, with music sounding clearly. Sa Perfected One thought: “This must be a place holding a ritual offering.” He approached to see who the benefactors were. An old man saw him and hurried to welcome him, inviting him to the tea hall. After greetings, the old man pulled out a chair for the Perfected One to sit, while he himself sat lower. The Perfected One asked: “Sir, may I ask your honorable surname and name?” The old man replied: “I humbly am called Gao Biao.” The Perfected One asked: “How many brothers do you have?” Gao said: “Only one younger brother, named Jie.” The Perfected One asked: “Is your family holding a Qingmiao Offering or a Bao’an Ritual?” Gao replied: “Today is a preparatory offering for the departed.” The Perfected One asked: “A preparatory offering is a preparatory offering, a departed offering is a departed offering—why call it a preparatory departed offering?”

Gao bowed and said: “Sir, you have just come from afar—have you seen the grand temple?” The Perfected One said: “I have seen it, but not yet visited.” Gao said: “That temple is called Guangfu Temple, dedicated to a numinous great king named King Guangfu. Years ago he subdued a monkey spirit and a horse spirit here. The Jade Emperor commanded him to receive blood offerings from this land, thus he is called a numinous great king.” The Perfected One said: “Please, sir, explain what is meant by ‘numinous’?” Gao suddenly wept and said: “Sir, that great king ‘responds to the offerings of the land, his power and spirit protect the people for a thousand li. Yearly he bestows sweet dew on the fields, every year clouds of blessing fall on the villages.’”

The Perfected One said: “Bestowing sweet dew and blessing clouds is a good intention—why such sorrow and distress?” Gao stamped his foot and beat his chest, crying out: “Sir! ‘Though grace is abundant, resentment remains; though kindness is great, harm is done. All because he demands boys and girls—not a just and upright god.’”

The Perfected One asked: “Does this god demand boys and girls?” Gao said: “Exactly. Every year the festival requires one boy and one girl, along with pigs, sheep, and wine offerings. Once he consumes these, he ensures favorable winds and rains. If not offered, disaster and calamity befall us. This year the festival falls to my household.” The Perfected One asked: “How many sons do you have?”

Gao beat his chest and said: “Alas, alas! Sons? Shame on me! I am sixty-three this year, my brother fifty-nine, and our children are few and frail. I took a concubine after fifty, who bore me a daughter, now eight years old, named ‘One Scale of Gold.’” The Perfected One asked: “Why call her ‘One Scale of Gold’?” Gao said: “Because of our poverty, I built bridges and roads, temples and pagodas, gave alms and offerings. I kept accounts, and when my daughter was born, I had over thirty jin of gold saved—thirty jin is one scale, hence her name.” Gao continued: “My brother has a son, also an only child, now seven years old, named ‘Guanbao Gao.’” The Perfected One asked: “What is the meaning of that name?”

Gao said: “We worship Lord Guan, and under his protection, my brother’s son was born, hence the name ‘Guanbao.’ This year it is our turn for the festival. We dare not refuse, so this flesh and blood bond is hard to sever. We first hold a ritual to pray for their souls’ peace, thus the ‘preparatory departed offering.’”

The Perfected One’s tears flowed uncontrollably. He said: “Sir, if you have no sons, only a daughter, and your brother only a son, how can you bear to offer them alive?” Gao said: “We have no choice.” The Perfected One asked: “Could purchased children be substituted?” Gao said: “At first, the god accepted purchased children, but now only biological children suffice; purchased ones are rejected.” The Perfected One said: “Bring your daughter out for me to see.”

Gao hurried inside and brought out One Scale of Gold, then called out his brother Jie to bring Guanbao Gao. They placed the children before the hall. The children, unaware of life or death, clutched fruit in their sleeves, chewing nervously, then suddenly fell into Gao’s arms, crying “Daddy!” The brothers wept uncontrollably, saying: “Child, you are ours now, but tomorrow you will be the feast of Guangfu.” They cried aloud.

Sa Perfected One’s heart was moved. He said: “Sir, do not weep. These two children (text missing).” Gao asked: “Sir, how will you save them?” The Perfected One said: “I am Sa Shoujian from Western River in Shu. I cultivate the dao and have studied under three immortal masters—Zhang Xujing, Wang Fangping, and Ge Xianweng—who taught me three kinds of dao methods. If I use my thunder method, this divine path spirit will be destroyed, and he will no longer consume your children.” Gao said: “If you can, it will be a blessing; if not, a curse.” The Perfected One said: “I will ensure blessing, not curse.” He instructed the Gao brothers to hold the children inside and not send them to the festival the next morning. Sa Perfected One then went alone to Guangfu Temple.

What happened thereafter is yet to be told.
