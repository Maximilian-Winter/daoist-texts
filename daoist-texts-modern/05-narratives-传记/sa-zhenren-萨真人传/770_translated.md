# Chapter Seven: The Perfected One Sets Fire to the Guangfu Temple — The City God Commands Wang Echa to Investigate

Now it happened that the Perfected One Sa made his way straight into the Guangfu Temple. There he saw the multitude of blessing households beating drums and striking bells, arranging incense, flowers, lamps, and candles, all in perfect order and neat rows. The divine attendant then spoke, asking, “Today is the sacrificial festival at the Gao family’s home. Why have the offerings not yet arrived?” The blessing households replied, “The Gao family surely has prepared a rich and abundant sacrifice; that is why they are late.” The attendant asked again, “Are the boy and girl the very ones named Gao Guanbao and Yicheng Jin?” The blessing households answered, “Great King, by your mighty spirit, we dare not substitute them.” The attendant said, “If so, those two tender ones are indeed fit for use.”

Before he finished speaking, the Perfected One Sa stood just outside the temple gate. With the Three Terraces covering his head and the Eight Trigrams guarding his body, he planted his feet firmly. He grasped the mighty talisman of Gan Julu Wen Lianwu, which breaks the northern Dipper’s fierce constellation, and in his hand he formed the secret formula of the Heavenly Venerable of the Leaving Edict Fire, victorious over the southern Dipper. Then he summoned the barbarian thunder of the Five Directions, kindled the celestial fire, terrestrial fire, thunder fire, thunderclap fire, and the three-flavored true fire of the sun, and blew forth a gust of the southeast wind. Thunder roared, fire blazed fiercely, and wind howled mightily, setting the Guangfu Temple ablaze in a sea of glowing red.

Behold:

Flames leapt from the beams, fire flared upon the pillars, the blaze billowed and scorched Heaven and Earth, its radiance illuminating mountains and rivers. At first, the deep scent of sandalwood incense filled the nose; now the clamor of gongs and drums was nowhere to be heard. This was like the first destruction of Xianyang, like the burning of the Ao Temple itself. The bell’s cord snapped, the incense burner shattered like a treasured duck’s string. The braziers turned to fiery hair, the incense sticks became coal smoke. The burning was so fierce that the judges could not hold their brushes, the little demons dared not raise their fists. The Guangfu King was burned to a crisp, the earth gods scorched and their faces fell away. The blessing households fled east and west in terror, the temple master wailed in bitter complaint. Truly, it was all because of those boy and girl sacrifices that the living immortals were enraged. They unleashed merciless fire—what a formidable Sa Shoujian!

Meanwhile, the flames of the Guangfu Temple roared high. The blessing households fled clutching their sons, brothers escaped holding their siblings. At such a time, who cared for the temple? The temple master ran east to save a piece of clothing, west to rescue a pair of shoes, down to the kitchen for pots and rice steamers, spoons, chopsticks, bowls, and plates, and to the bedroom for straw mats, cushions, cotton quilts, and sheets. In such panic and confusion, who cared for any Bodhisattva?

Yet there was one Bodhisattva, though carved from wood and bamboo, who truly possessed some spiritual efficacy. Seeing the fire’s glow near its side, it leapt with all its might and jumped out of the temple gate. Looking closely, it beheld a Daoist standing before the temple gate, commanding thunder and wielding fire. The divine attendant, enraged, exclaimed, “Anger rises from the heart, hatred grows at the gallbladder’s edge!” He seized a steel whip and struck at the empty air. The Perfected One, seeing the attendant’s hostile intent, brandished the treasured sword granted by Master Zhang the Celestial Master, blocking the steel whip. The whip struck from the left, the sword met it on the left; the whip struck from the right, the sword parried on the right; the whip came down from above, the sword intercepted from above; the whip struck upward from below, the sword met it below.

The divine attendant was helpless. Just as he was about to call his soldiers to join the fray, the Perfected One summoned the barbarian thunder in his palm and struck head-on, wielding blazing fire to burn fiercely. How could the attendant withstand such power? He then asked the earth god of the temple, “Who is this person who destroyed my sacrifices and burned my temple?” The earth god replied, “I just came from the Gao family’s home. The Gao family’s earth god told me: ‘In Xihe of Shu, there is a Sa Shoujian who has obtained the arts of the three immortals Zhang Xujing, Wang Fangping, and Ge Xianweng, as well as the treasured sword granted by Master Zhang the Celestial Master. This sword flies here and there, severing heavenly gods above and earthly fiends below.’ Today, the one who set fire to the temple and destroyed the boy and girl sacrifices is this very person.”

Hearing this, the divine attendant sighed silently, “Since this person has such abilities, how can I possibly contend with him? But I was appointed to oversee the blood offerings for the Guangxiang King in this land, all by the report of the City God of Huguang Province’s capital. It is best I go see the City God and seek his judgment.”

So he rode a cloud of mist and went straight to Huguang Province’s capital. There he saw a temple where a divine attendant sat, wearing a black silk cap, a grand red robe, a golden belt, holding an ivory tablet. His face was delicate and handsome, teeth white and lips red, powdered cheeks, and three wisps of beard. On his left stood rows of judges, on his right rows of little demons, all majestic and fierce, exuding murderous energy.

The Guangfu King arrived there and asked an earth god at the temple entrance, “Is this the City God’s temple?” The earth god replied, “Indeed.” Guangfu King asked, “What is the City God’s family name and given name?” The earth god said, “Do you not know his origins? His surname is Ji, given name Xin. In former times, he served Han Gaozu loyally to death. When Han Gaozu gained the realm, he appointed him as City God.” Guangfu King said, “There are many City Gods across the realm; are they all surnamed Ji?” The earth god answered, “Across the two capitals and thirteen provinces, in every prefecture, state, and county, the City Gods are all surnamed Ji. Even among the Eastern Barbarians, Western Rong, Southern Man, and Northern Di, wherever cities are built and temples established, the City Gods all bear the surname Ji!” Guangfu King asked, “Why does this City God seem especially majestic?” The earth god said, “This City God is the lord of a province. The provincial City Gods have more authority than those of prefectures; prefectural City Gods outrank those of states; state City Gods outrank those of counties.”

The origins of this City God shall not be further recounted here. The Guangfu King entered the temple to meet the City God and, due to their high offices, offered a kneeling salute. After paying respects, the City God asked, “What earth god are you?” Guangfu King replied, “I am surnamed Wang, given name E. In former days, I subdued the monkey and horse spirits in Xiangyin, and the City God of Xiangyin County reported me before the Jade Emperor, who decreed I oversee the blood offerings in that region. But now, in Shu’s Xihe, there is a man named Sa Shoujian who burned my temple and destroyed my sacrifices. Now we earth gods have no shelter over our heads. I beg your mercy, Lord.” The City God said, “This Sa Shoujian, I have heard, has obtained the Dao arts of the three immortals Zhang Xujing, Wang Fangping, and Ge Xianweng, and now he is called a Perfected One, with vast divine powers and boundless magic. What can you do against him? It is pointless to argue with me today. Better you follow him for twelve years; if he errs, you may whip him to death and avenge your grievance, then I will report to the Jade Emperor. If he commits no fault, you dare not strike him rashly, lest you bring guilt upon yourself.”

Guangfu King secretly rejoiced, “Sa Shoujian, Sa Shoujian, not to say twelve years, even twelve hours I will repay your grudge. If not in twelve hours, then twelve days; if not twelve days, then twelve months. Surely not twelve years.” The City God, seeing Wang E’s joy, feared he might act on personal vendetta and harm the Perfected One rashly, so he sent an official from his department to accompany Wang E as a supervisor. If Sa Shoujian errs, Wang E may whip him; if not, he must not seek private revenge. Wang E agreed and the official likewise consented to accompany him. This matter shall not be further recounted here.

Meanwhile, the Perfected One Sa, having burned the Guangfu Temple, went to the Gao family’s home. The Gao brothers, grateful that he had saved their two children, prepared a sumptuous feast to thank the Perfected One. They slaughtered a newly born pig, a soft-furred sheep, a rooster that crows at dawn, a goose with red feet, a duck with a green head, and netted several splendidly scaled fish, arranging everything neatly.

As soon as the Perfected One arrived, he asked, “For what purpose is this feast prepared?” Gao replied, “Thanks to your magic power, you saved my daughter and nephew. This humble feast is but a token of gratitude.” The Perfected One was greatly surprised and said, “To slaughter so many living creatures for me alone is my sin.” He then clasped his hands and repented, reciting the scripture for disaster relief and sin expiation without ceasing. Afterwards, he said to the elder Gao, “I am a monk who has left the world, abstaining from wine and meat. You have gone to great trouble; please take it all back.”

The Gao brothers were astonished and said, “Since you eat vegetarian, our humble home has little to offer.” The Perfected One said, “No need. I must take my leave.” Gao said, “The Guangfu King burned the temple. If you leave and he comes to harm my family, what then? Please stay here for a year or two.” The Perfected One said, “That divine attendant was burned by me; how dare he come again to cause trouble? Rest assured.” The Gao brothers urged him repeatedly; the Perfected One had no choice but to stay for a month or two. Since he ate only vegetarian fare, the Gao brothers sent servants to prepare vegetarian fruits and dishes.

It was the fourth month, and in the garden, aside from loquats, plums, apricots, and cherries, there were no other fruits. Yet in their own home they still had fresh tangerines, sweet sugarcane, round and clean big chestnuts, and pure and fine earth melons. They gathered these fruits, then gathered celery from the southern stream, dug bamboo shoots from the western garden, sought wood ear mushrooms on the eastern mountain, and fetched reed roots from the northern hill. They cooked fragrant rice from the green fields, brewed tender early spring tea, opened clear golden Huajiu wine, and prepared smooth jade-like soup. The servants arranged these vegetables, fruits, and dishes on the table, and the Gao brothers invited the Perfected One to dine at noon in the guest room.

The Perfected One said, “I am much obliged to your kindness, but I have received the magic of the immortal master Ge Xianweng’s incantation jujube. Three jujubes suffice for one meal; nine jujubes sustain a whole day. These fruits and vegetables I do not need at all.” Gao said, “Then you have already entered the path of fasting.” He asked, “What is this incantation jujube?” The Perfected One said, “Simply recite the spell, and the jujubes come by themselves. Now I borrow a small box, place it on the table, and will chant a few jujubes to offer to you worthy brothers.” Gao said, “What a marvelous method!”

He placed a box on the table. The Perfected One chanted a few words: “Sheep horn, sheep horn, deer Lu, deer Lu, an he mou ni ba fu hong.” As soon as the incantation ended, several jujubes as large as pears appeared in the box. Gao laughed heartily, “Your magic is wondrous indeed!” The Perfected One presented the jujubes to the Gao brothers. Gao took one, Gao Jie took one, Gao Guanbao and Yicheng Jin each took one, as did the wives of Gao and Gao Jie. With the distribution complete, the Perfected One dispersed the rest. The Gao brothers ate the jujubes, which tasted extraordinary and filled them with satiety. They said, “Sir, with such treasures, why still eat these wild mountain fruits?” Then they cleared the feast.

The Perfected One Sa stayed at the Gao residence for over a month. One day, he truly wished to take leave. The elder Gao could not detain him, so he presented one hundred taels of silver, one hundred taels of gold, fifty bolts of brocade, and fifty strings of copper and iron as reward for saving the children, laid out in the courtyard. At that moment, Wang E from the underworld observed and said to the official, “If this man accepts such heavy wealth, then I have made a deal and will surely give him a whip. I will strike him.” The official said, “Let us see if he accepts it or not; do not act rashly.”

The Perfected One, seeing the gifts, was startled and said, “Sir, why do you offer such things?” Elder Gao said, “My daughter and nephew are indebted to your protection; this is but a humble thanks. Please accept it with a smile.” The Perfected One said, “I am a monk without parents to support me, without wife or children to nurture me. I do not go as a guest or traveler, nor do I collect taxes or grain. Why would I need such heavy goods? Please take them back.” Elder Gao said, “Once a yellow sparrow was struck by a hawk and near death, but was saved by Yang Bao, who later received two rings in thanks. We brothers are deeply grateful to you; if we do not repay you with gold and silk, we are less than a bird. Please accept it.” The Perfected One said, “Sir, your sincerity is enough, enough! If you insist on thanks with gold and silk, it is not love but a burden. I resolutely refuse.”

The Gao brothers knelt together, determined that the Perfected One accept the gifts. The Perfected One also knelt and said, “Please rise, please rise.” Elder Gao said, “Sir, if you do not accept this humble gift, we brothers will kneel until tomorrow.” The Perfected One said, “Very well, please rise. I will accept one string of coins.” Elder Gao said, “Please also accept gold and silver.” The Perfected One said, “One string of coins is enough.” Elder Gao said, “Please accept brocade to make some clothes.” The Perfected One said, “I have this monk’s robe sufficient for a lifetime; what need have I for clothes?” Thus they parted, the Gao brothers filled with gratitude.

The official saw that this Perfected One valued righteousness over wealth and said to Wang E, “This man is upright and good, a good man.” Wang E said, “Official, do not praise him too much. Sooner or later, I will find a flaw and end him with my whip.”

But where did the Perfected One go after leaving? What fault did Wang E seek to find in him? Let us see what unfolds below.
