# Chapter Eight: The Immortal Wang E’s Misdeeds and the Immortal’s Return of the Merchant’s Bright Pearl

Now it happened that Immortal Sa departed from the lofty mansion, wandering far and wide, intent on saving people and benefiting all beings. But that spirit Wang E, bent on avenging old grudges, followed him eastward and westward, shadowing his steps, striking down anyone who showed the slightest fault. One day, the Immortal came to the region of Chenzhou. It was the ninth month of the year, and he saw a woman in the wild fields pulling up a green creeping vegetable. What was this creeping green? It was none other than the wild greens known as wūqīng. The vegetable was described thus:

Its roots were white, its leaves a fresh green. Planted in fields nourished by Heaven’s rain and dew, it sprang from the earth to aid the lives below. Though called wūqīng, it was also known as creeping green. Eaten when hungry, it filled the belly; chewed when thirsty, it produced saliva. This was originally the vegetable of Zhuge, not some wild herb of the common folk.

Why was it called “Zhuge’s vegetable”? Long ago, when Zhuge set out on his campaigns, wherever his army camped, he ordered this vegetable to be planted, hence its other name. Now, as Immortal Sa passed by, the woman pulling the greens was a virtuous one. Seeing he was a wandering Daoist, she asked, “Sir, might you use some wūqīng to quench your thirst?” As she spoke, she held out two sprigs of the green vegetable with respect. Wang E watched from behind and said, “Men and women should not touch; today he deserves a whip for this.” The attendant spirit said, “Wait a moment—let’s see what he does.”

Immortal Sa saw the woman offering the wūqīng and quickly said, “Young lady, since you kindly offer, please lay it on the ground; I will take it myself.” The woman replied, “Sir, you are unusually polite. Countless others have taken it from my hand without a word.” The Immortal said, “In times of suspicion, one must be cautious.”

The woman had no choice but to place the wūqīng on the ground. The Immortal then laid down a few coins beside it and said, “Young lady, please accept this humble copper money as payment.” The woman said, “Sir, two sprigs of wūqīng are not something I sell. Many have received favors from me in these fields today.” The Immortal said, “If you do not accept the money, I dare not take the greens.”

Seeing his careful courtesy, the woman accepted. The Immortal took one sprig and said, “Thank you.” The woman urged, “Sir, take both.” The Immortal said, “One is enough. To take more would harm my integrity.” So he took one sprig, washed it clean in a clear stream, and then ate it. The attendant spirit watching said to Wang E, “A gentleman who knows propriety—rare indeed! Rare indeed!” Wang E said, “This time he escaped my whip; I’ll follow him again and make sure he dies by my hand.”

One day, the Immortal reached the borders of Guizhou, at a place called Longjin, where a great stream flowed. He saw:

Vast and deep the waters spread, waves layered and endless.  
Like Sichuan’s rushing gorge waters,  
Like the Milky Way pouring from the Nine Heavens.  
Bottomless and fathomless, swirling with eddies,  
No sight of the middle currents breaking, only the distant songs of fishermen.  

Calling to the boatman, none appeared ahead or behind;  
Gazing at the full river’s might, no way left or right to turn.  

Indeed:

Before the rapids, swift waters murmur down,  
Waves strike the fishing rocks, white blossoms fly.  
At dusk, no inn by the river’s edge,  
Calling the boatman to stand on the sandy shore.

The sky was already darkening; no inn was near on this side, and no ferry boat was in sight. Immortal Sa searched left and right, then saw a ferry boat tied among the willows. The boatman, fearing someone might take his boat without paying, had tied it far off to the hanging willows. The Immortal, helpless, boarded the boat, untied the willows, and took up a bamboo pole to push the boat out from the shade.

Wang E saw this and raised his steel whip, saying, “Taking what’s not yours, crossing without paying—” and was about to strike the Immortal’s head. The attendant spirit quickly stopped him, saying, “Don’t be rash. Such a small matter—why strike him blindly? Let’s see how he fares on the other side.” Immortal Sa pushed the boat into deeper water; the waves grew larger. He set down the pole, lifted the oars, and with effort rowed to the opposite shore.

This shore still had some willow trees. The Immortal jumped off, grasped a willow branch, and secured the boat firmly. Then he took a few copper coins, placed them in the boat’s cabin, bowed once, and departed. The attendant spirit, seeing the Immortal’s conduct, exclaimed with admiration, “‘Do not neglect the small good deeds’—rare indeed! Rare indeed!” Wang E said, “Master, don’t admire him so. Though he escaped my whip this time, he won’t escape the next.”

One day, Immortal Sa wandered to Yuxi, still in the ninth month, when suddenly a fierce wind arose. That wind, truly:

Blew straight in my face, eyes could not see it.  
Crossing the river, waves a thousand feet high,  
Bamboo stalks bent and broken by the blast.

Where the wind blew, a heavy rain followed. That rain:

Fell with the wind, drop after drop,  
Pouring like a bucket, never ceasing.  
Streams swelled and flooded the ditches,  
Beating down the banana leaves.

Immortal Sa was on the road, no village ahead, no inn behind, no pavilion for shelter. With no better option, he opened his rain cover to shield against wind and rain. Unexpectedly, a gust tore the cover from his hands and carried it away. Poor Immortal, drenched by the heavy rain, water streaming down his face, his patched robe not a thread dry. Wang E followed, saying, “Today this steadfast one is blown by wind and soaked by rain. If he were to curse the wind or scold the rain, he would surely earn a whip.” The attendant spirit said, “Wait—let’s see what he does.”

What a true Immortal! Braving rain and wind, soaked to the skin, trudging through mud ankle-deep. Indeed:

At home, a thousand days are good;  
On the road, half a morning is hard.

He uttered no complaint. A group of about a dozen travelers hurried up to him and said, “Sir, why no umbrella?” The Immortal said, “I had one, but the wild wind just now tore it away.” One merchant said, “Today’s wind is no ordinary wind; today’s rain is no ordinary rain.” Another said, “At this time, such a strong wind? Surely not the Clear Wind, Fish Fry Wind, or Peach Blossom Wind.” Another said, “At this time, such heavy rain? Surely not the Bean Sprout Rain, Pear Blossom Rain, or Yellow Plum Rain.” Another said, “If I were a god, I’d hang the Wind Master and Rain Master in midair and give each a thousand lashes.”

See how on the road, people chatter endlessly, their words half true, half false, hardly serious. The Immortal said, “Gentlemen, this is Heaven’s decree; do not grumble or complain.” One merchant said, “Sir, you’re soaked through and yet so calm—don’t you fear the yellow swelling disease?” The Immortal said, “As the saying goes: ‘Yellow swelling does not strike the traveler; phlegm-fire does not harm the laborer.’” Another said, “If the rain doesn’t stop, I worry you have no clothes to change into.” The Immortal said, “I trust the rain will not last long. Today my patched hood is soaked; tomorrow the sun will dry it. How could Heaven fail to care for us?” A merchant laughed, “Such a man is an ancient gentleman.”

Though Immortal Sa spoke thus, the rain grew heavier. The merchants said, “Sir, the rain worsens. You go slowly; we will press ahead.” The Immortal said, “No hurry; the road ahead is also there.” As he spoke, the saying proved true: “Wild winds do not last the whole morning; sudden rains do not last the whole day.” The storm began at dawn and ceased by noon. Looking up, the clouds cleared, the mist dispersed, and a red sun shone bright overhead. The Immortal reached a pavilion, took off his soaked hood, leaving only his short robe, wrung the water from his sleeves, and sat to dry in the sun. He then composed a poem:

Sudden rain, wild wind, Heaven darkened,  
Long journeying traveler’s soul nearly broken.  
Now joy to see the sun’s warm light,  
Thanks to Heaven’s gracious protection.

The attendant spirit watching saw the Immortal, drenched and solitary like a rain-beaten cold chicken, his patched hood and clothes soaked through, yet uttering no complaint. When the mist cleared, and the Immortal offered thanks in verse, the spirit sighed, “What a good man! What a good man!” Wang E said, “Master, master, don’t admire him so. His reckoning will come. Watch and see.”

One day, the Immortal came to Yongning Prefecture, to a place called Zhuozhuo Village, where for twenty miles not a single tree grew. No trees on the mountain—this was what Mencius called “thus it is bare indeed.” Hence the name Zhuozhuo Village. The Immortal reached this place and suddenly felt an urgent need to relieve himself. This was a pressing matter; how could he hold it in? Wang E rejoiced, “The sun blazes high; if he fouls the three lights, he must become a ghost whipped below.” The attendant spirit said, “Let’s see what he does.”

The Immortal searched left and right, found no latrine nor tree, and had to relieve himself in the open, fearing pollution of the three lights. What a noble Immortal! Having lost his rain cover to the wild wind before, now he had a new one. He opened the umbrella in the middle of the field, shielding himself from the sun as he relieved himself. When done, he covered the spot thickly with earth, then folded the umbrella and washed himself clean in a nearby stream. He then recited several sacred incantations: the “Nine Phoenixes Dispelling Filth,” followed by “Ganluo Dana” and “Ever Pure Ever Clean Heavenly Venerable” to dispel impurity. The attendant spirit, seeing this, said to Wang E, “This one is meticulous and cautious, without a single flaw. Will you still strike him?” Wang E said, “Master, master, not this year, but next year. Just wait and see.”

One day, the Immortal traveled to Qujing Prefecture, at Ganxing Post Station, and suddenly saw by the crossroads a bright pearl. That pearl was:

Radiant and lustrous, perfectly round,  
Like the brilliance of the Shen and Shang stars,  
Like the cold light of Kui and Bi constellations.  
A relic from the Red River, symbolizing the net,  
A treasure from Hepu, returned by Meng Chang.  
This pearl once hung beneath the jaw of the black dragon,  
Once nestled in the belly of an ancient clam.  
Wei Huiyu once hung it to light his carriage,  
Wu Zixu once treasured it crossing the pass.  
Truly round as cinnabar washed in the medicine well,  
Bright as dew running over a lotus plate.  
A snake warns Sui Hou—truly strange!  
An ant tunnels Confucius—truly difficult!

The Immortal saw this shining, lovely pearl and said, “The pearl of the bright moon discarded by the roadside—how could a traveler pass without drawing his sword?” He bent down, picked it up, wiped away the dirt, wrapped it carefully in paper, and hid it in his sleeve. Wang E saw this and raised his steel whip, saying to the attendant spirit, “In old times, the simple folk did not take what was not theirs. This steadfast one picks up a bright pearl on the road—if not to strike him dead, then when?” The attendant spirit hastened to stop him, saying, “How do you know he won’t return it?” Wang E said, “That pearl is already wrapped and tucked in his sleeve. If he were to return it, I would only give him a whip.” The attendant spirit said, “The City God commands me to be the Master. If you recklessly strike and kill someone, I will oppose you.” Wang E had no choice but to hold back.

The Immortal picked up the bright pearl but did not leave. He sat on a grassy slope, waiting for the owner to come and reclaim it. He looked left and right, but no one appeared. The sky darkened; he thought to seek lodging but feared the owner might come. This was a crossroads; no one knew whence the owner came or whither he went. In this awkward situation, the Immortal sat through the night.

The owner of the lost pearl was a merchant from Jiangxi. Traveling through Guangdong, he had saved five or six hundred taels of silver. Seeing the pearl, he paid five hundred taels for it and used one hundred taels for travel expenses, heading to Yunnan Province to sell it. The journey was long and the days many. The pearl pouch hung at his chest, never taken off day or night. Unnoticed, the seam tore, and the slippery pearl slipped out onto the road.

The merchant traveled half a day unaware. At dusk, he stopped at an inn, set down his luggage, and bought two jars of wine to ease his weary feet. After drinking, he opened the pearl pouch and looked—only to find the bright pearl had vanished into thin air! The merchant burst into loud sobs. The innkeepers were startled and said, “Sir, if you’re going to get drunk and make a scene, one jar would have been enough. Why two?” The merchant said, “Innkeepers, it’s not drunkenness. My clothes are on that pearl, my food is on that pearl, my wife is on that pearl, my land is on that pearl, my house is on that pearl. Now the pearl is gone.”

The innkeeper said, “Sir, how could your pig marry, buy land, or build a house? How could it do all that? The other day I slaughtered a big pig worth only a few taels of silver, not enough even for one garment. I had to sell a piglet to make up the difference.” The merchant said, “My pearl can walk.” The innkeeper said, “I know pigs can walk. The other day, my pig ran three or four miles after being let out of the pen. I had to hire strong men to catch it.” The merchant said, “I don’t raise pigs. I’m talking about a walking bright pearl.” The innkeeper said, “That’s a treasure; you should be more careful.” The merchant said, “Innkeeper, I entrust my luggage to you. I’ll search the road at night and day to find it.” The innkeeper said, “Sir, you don’t know the dangers here—deep mountains, dense forests, snakes and insects, tigers, mountain spirits, ghosts and goblins. If you travel alone at night, you’ll be bitten by snakes or mauled by tigers, or lost to spirits. I fear you won’t live ten lives. If you die, don’t come back to trouble my inn.”

The merchant had no choice but to wait for dawn. That night, he sat wide awake, full of sorrow, murmuring the pearl’s name, thinking of the pearl. Truly:

Joy finds the night too short,  
Loneliness makes it longer still.

Suddenly, from the woodcutter’s tower, the drum struck the fifth watch, and roosters flapped and crowed, cawing and clucking. The merchant bid farewell to the innkeeper, saying, “Please watch my luggage while I go seek the pearl.” The innkeeper said, “The sky is still early.” The merchant said, “The dawn is near.” He left the inn.

The waning moon had not yet set; the morning stars still shone bright. The merchant searched the old road, passing long and short pavilions, crying as he went, asking all he met, “I lost a bright pearl on this road yesterday. If anyone finds it and sells it, I am willing to share the price.” They answered, “Lost yesterday, sought today—where are such kind-hearted souls who would return it?”

Hearing this, the merchant grew more troubled. Near noon, he came close to Ganxing Post Station. Immortal Sa sat on the grassy slope and saw a man rushing, gasping for breath, tears streaming down his cheeks—truly pitiful. The Immortal asked, “Sir, are you the one who lost the pearl yesterday?” The merchant said, “I am indeed. I lost a bright pearl yesterday and don’t know who found it. If anyone kindly returns it, I am willing to share the price.” The Immortal said, “You are a careful merchant. I found this pearl here at noon yesterday and waited half a day for you. Not seeing you, I sat here all night, waiting.” Then he took the pearl from his sleeve and said, “Is this the pearl?”

The merchant’s sorrow turned to joy, worry to delight. “This is indeed the pearl!” he said. The Immortal generously returned it. The merchant said, “Such kindness is rare. Come with me to sell the pearl and share the price.” The Immortal said, “No need. I am a monk and take no payment.” The merchant said, “Such kindness is rare. You waited a day and night and won’t share the price. Please accept my bow.” The Immortal said, “No need. If you bow, I will kneel in return. A respectful bow and farewell will do.” The merchant and Immortal parted, grateful beyond words. The merchant went south; the Immortal headed west. This, for now, is not to be told.

The attendant spirit, watching from above, exclaimed with admiration, “This Master Sa must be Confucius reborn, or the Buddha Shakyamuni returned. Otherwise, how could he have such a good heart? The immortals are short of such a one. A good man! A good man!” Wang E, seeing the spirit’s admiration, said, “Master, master, I and you have only nine years with him, three years left. Watch closely these three years and see if he deserves death or not!”

But what happened afterward between Wang E and him, we shall hear in due course.
