# Chapter Nine: Li Qiongqiong Forsakes Womanly Virtue; Master Sa Ren Transcends Carnal Desire

Now it happened that Master Sa Ren, one day wandering the world, arrived at a place called Flower-Competing Village. Why was it called “Flower-Competing Village”? The village lay nestled among mountains of strange and wondrous shapes: to the east, west, south, and north each rose a ridge, together resembling a beautiful woman reclining in repose—folk called this “the beauty competing with the flowers.” Thus the village took its name from this form: Flower-Competing Village. Within this village, the women were many and loose in their ways.

Among them was a woman named Li Qiongqiong, married to a man named Zhou Tianrong. Tianrong had a sworn brother surnamed Yao, named Jiude, who served as prefect of Chengdu Prefecture in Sichuan. When Tianrong went to his post, he visited Yao Jiude. At their meeting, like old friends reunited in a foreign land, joy overflowed. Tianrong stayed on at Yao’s office for two whole years without returning home. Meanwhile, at home, his wife Qiongqiong kept two lovers. One was Liu Jiaolang, the other Chen Junlang. These two, Jiaolang and Junlang, were close friends, classmates in study, sharing a friendship as deep as Guan and Bao dividing gold, as loyal as Lian and Lin severing their own necks. Liu Jiaolang was also related to Zhou Tianrong by marriage, calling Li Qiongqiong his elder cousin-in-law.

One day, Jiaolang came to Tianrong’s house to ask if his cousin had returned from Chengdu, or sent any news. Li Qiongqiong came out to meet Jiaolang. Upon seeing him, she appeared graceful and serene, her bearing gentle and sweet. Her waist was like tender, soft willows swaying in misty smoke; her face like a delicate lotus just dripping with water. None could rival the flute-playing Qin Nongyu in the tower, nor boast like Wang Zhaojun plucking the pipa on horseback. Jiaolang, upon seeing her, burst into a deep song and said, “Greetings, elder cousin-in-law.” Li Qiongqiong quickly returned the greeting, saying, “Uncle Jiaolang, please forgive me.” Then she asked, “Uncle Jiaolang, since cousin left, you have not come by—has something displeased you?”

Jiaolang replied, “How could that be? It is only that the master has arrived, the exam season draws near, and we must study hard, so I have not had time to come.”

Since her husband had gone away, Li Qiongqiong did not know how many fine occasions she had missed. Seeing Jiaolang’s handsome countenance and the talent of a young scholar, her heart stirred with desire. Liu Jiaolang was a young gentleman; seeing Qiongqiong, “more eloquent than flowers, more fragrant than jade,” he too felt the stirrings of spring in his heart. Truly, as the verse goes:

> Fair lady, handsome gentleman—both worthy of praise,  
> The young willow loves the oriole, the oriole loves the willow,  
> The bright flower beguiles the butterfly, the butterfly is lost in the flower.

Li Qiongqiong then asked, “Uncle Liu, will you marry this year?” Jiaolang answered, “I am ashamed, still not yet arranged—too early yet.” Qiongqiong said, “With such a talented young man, why worry about lacking a wife?” Jiaolang saw the pity in Qiongqiong’s eyes and asked, “Elder cousin-in-law, since your cousin left, do you lie alone at night, do you not beat the bed or turn the pillow?” Li Qiongqiong only smiled and said nothing. Jiaolang said again, “If you do not reject me, I will come to keep you company tonight.” Qiongqiong smiled again but said nothing.

Seeing some meaning in her smile, Jiaolang drew near, embraced her, and kissed her lips. Behold these two, their passions awakened, like fish playing in water, like phoenix seeking its mate. They entered the bedroom, unbuttoned, loosened silk sashes, shed clothes, and with hearts aflame, they joined in a dance of clouds and rain—how joyful they were! When their union ended, Jiaolang took his leave. Li Qiongqiong promised to meet him again that night. Their mutual longing and hesitation need not be told here.

Meanwhile, Liu Jiaolang went to the inn and told Chen Junlang of these events, saying just so and so. This made Chen Junlang’s soul fly beyond the heavens, his spirit scatter across the nine skies. At dusk, Jiaolang said to Junlang, “You sleep alone tonight; I will go to elder cousin-in-law’s house to spend the night.” Junlang replied, “Go ahead.” Though he said this, in his heart he schemed; when Jiaolang left, Junlang followed stealthily.

At Zhou’s home, Li Qiongqiong sat beneath the lamp. Seeing Jiaolang, the two embraced, whispering “my heart, my soul.” Suddenly Junlang appeared, calling out, “Good elder cousin-in-law! Good elder cousin-in-law!” Li Qiongqiong was startled. Jiaolang said, “Damn you, why have you come?” Qiongqiong asked, “Uncle Jiaolang, who is this man?” Jiaolang answered, “He is my friend Chen Junlang.” Qiongqiong greeted Junlang. Junlang saw this woman, truly “cherry lips like Fan Su, willow waist like a young beauty; her face like Wenjun, impossible to capture in painting.” His soul could not help but soar. Li Qiongqiong also saw Junlang’s handsome, gentle bearing—no less beloved than Cui Yingying was to Zhang Sheng, or Han Xiangru to Wenjun.

Junlang said to Jiaolang, “Brother, brother, tonight we share the pleasures of wind and moon; how can one alone enjoy the springtime of Shanglin?” Jiaolang replied, “You are my close friend; what is there to say? Only ask elder cousin-in-law.” Qiongqiong said, “Since Master Chen is dear to Uncle Jiaolang, I cannot refuse.” Thus the three shared one bed. Li Qiongqiong lay in the middle, Chen Junlang inside, Liu Jiaolang outside.

That night, Junlang first joined Li Qiongqiong in union. Behold these new lovers, how much meaning, how much tenderness, how much caressing—their kisses sweet as sugar on the tongue, their breath fragrant in the nostrils. Truly:

> No joy surpasses the joy of new acquaintance.

When Junlang’s union ended, it was Jiaolang’s turn. See how, having joined once by day, now their love grew deeper, their passion increased. Jiaolang could not stop calling “dear elder cousin-in-law,” Qiongqiong could not stop calling “beloved uncle.” How wondrous! Then Junlang asked Qiongqiong, “Are all affairs settled? Are all matters complete?” Qiongqiong said, “I see you before me, then suddenly behind.” So, facing outward, she embraced Jiaolang; facing inward, she embraced Junlang. Truly:

> The bridal chamber’s spring is like the sea, each moment worth a thousand pieces of gold.

Li Qiongqiong was exceedingly joyful! Liu Jiaolang was exceedingly joyful! Chen Junlang was exceedingly joyful! From then on, the two men came by day and left by dawn—this story need not be told further here.

Now, Master Sa Ren journeyed to Flower-Competing Village, arriving late in the day. From afar he saw no smoke or fire in the village ahead and wished to press forward, but the mountains rose high and the trees thick. Just as he reached the gate of the Zhou household, he saw a side door. Not wishing to disturb those inside, he quietly sat beneath the doorframe, intending to pass the night there and continue in the morning. Little did he know, Li Qiongqiong inside saw him and thought, “Tonight I have invited Liu Jiaolang and Chen Junlang to a secret tryst; this Daoist stranger at the door is most inconvenient.” She called a servant named Zhou Bao, whom Tianrong had hired to supply firewood when he left for Chengdu. Qiongqiong said, “Outside the side door is a Daoist; tell him to come inside and rest.”

Zhou Bao went to Master Sa and said, “Sir, night has fallen; it is not good to sit outside. Please come inside to rest.” The Master said, “I am a monk; your home is no inn—I should not enter.” Inside, Li Qiongqiong said, “Sir, it is inconvenient outside; please come in and rest.” The Master thought this woman was kind and so followed the servant inside to rest, never asking if there was a man in the house.

Meanwhile, Chen Junlang and Liu Jiaolang went to a tavern to drink. Midway through, Jiaolang said, “Tonight at Li Qiongqiong’s house, let me go first.” Junlang said, “I want to go first.” The two argued back and forth, and on the tavern’s upper floor they came to blows. Junlang struck a cup at Jiaolang’s face; the cup shattered, cutting Jiaolang’s cheek, blood flowing freely. Jiaolang grabbed a pair of chopsticks and struck Junlang, bruising his eye.

The two then went to the study hall. Jiaolang said, “Tonight no one should go.” They buttoned their robes and sat facing each other by the light of a green lamp. Unbeknownst to them, Li Qiongqiong leaned by the door, watching and waiting. She muttered to herself, “Last night they came in pairs; tonight, why does not one come? If Liu Jiaolang does not come, Chen Junlang coming is good; if Chen Junlang does not come, Liu Jiaolang coming is good.” She turned her thoughts again and again, growing more anxious and angry—truly, eyes worn thin by waiting, heart broken by longing.

By the third watch, Li Qiongqiong’s passion burned fiercely. She cursed, “Those two wretches, may they die young, murderers!” Suddenly she thought, “The Daoist who came late, graceful and handsome, with good character—why not amuse myself with him? Would that not be good?” She lit a lamp and approached where Master Sa slept. The door was not locked; she pushed it open. The Master saw her and bowed, rising. Li Qiongqiong made a polite gesture, “Sir, please do not be offended.” The Master returned the bow. Meanwhile, the spirit attendant Wang E rose, raising his steel whip, cracking his knuckles and grinding his teeth, saying to the talisman bearer, “Prefect, prefect, I have served ten years and never met such a demon. Tonight he must die. If he shows the slightest evil, give him a whip.” Truly:

> The King of Hell decrees death at the third watch,  
> Not sparing him to the fourth.

The talisman bearer said, “This is a crucial moment; if Master Sa errs, deal with him as you see fit.” But more on this later.

Master Sa bowed again to Li Qiongqiong and said, “Young lady, you come bearing a lamp—what is your intent?” Qiongqiong said, “Sir, you came late; this woman was not hospitable. I have come to keep you company.” The Master said, “Young lady, you err. ‘Do not adjust your shoes in the melon patch, nor your hat beneath the plum tree.’ In times of suspicion, one must be cautious. Please withdraw. If others learn of this, it will not be safe.” Qiongqiong said, “My husband is far away, no elders here, only a servant sleeping soundly. Sir, you should be sensible.” The Master said, “A woman’s way is to observe the three obediences and the four virtues—that is the path of a good wife. A monk’s six senses are pure, the five skandhas empty—that is the way of a good Daoist. Young lady, you let me be a good Daoist, and you be a good wife.”

Having spoken, he tried to leave. But Qiongqiong barred the door, saying, “Sir, you entered my chamber; you cannot leave my chamber. Where will you go?” The Master said, “Young lady, look to Heaven’s face—I truly do not wish to do this.” Qiongqiong said, “Youth fades quickly, good fortune is rare. Tonight you meet me; if you do not join me, you are a fool. If I let you go now, I am the fool.” She pressed close to him, seeking union.

The Master was helpless. Drawing the sword he wore, he handed it to Qiongqiong, knelt on both knees, tears flowing, and said, “Young lady, if you insist I join you tonight, I beg you, by your own hand, to use this sword to sever my head.” Seeing his words, Qiongqiong’s heart was eased. She said, “Sir, you are a good man; forgive my lowly jest.” She took up her lamp and left. At dawn, the Master, seeing this woman lacked the way of virtue, departed without a word.

The talisman bearer shook his head, stuck out his tongue, and said, “Such a great demon, yet Master Sa escaped—rare indeed! Rare indeed!” Wang E also somewhat relented, saying, “At this crucial moment, I meant to give him a whip; unexpectedly, he escaped. Let us follow him two more years and see what happens.”

But what befell thereafter? That shall be told in the next chapter.
