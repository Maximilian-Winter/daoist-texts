# Chapter Twelve: The Yin Court Establishes the Platform of Rewarding Good Deeds — The Perfected One Tours the Office of Goodness

Now, the Perfected One had just crossed the bleak Ridge of Desolation. Raising his head, he beheld before him a grand main gate, above which hung a plaque inscribed with four great characters: “Platform of Rewarding Good Deeds.” This platform was a palace of jade and crystal, its eaves tiled in shimmering green, arranged with elegant irregularity. On either side of the two stairways stood eight splendid palaces, each with a vermilion plaque inscribed in golden characters. The first plaque read: “Mansion of Filial Devotion.”

The Judge led the Perfected One inside. Colorful banners fluttered, crimson tassels hung in rows, celestial music rang out with clanging and clashing tones, auspicious clouds swirled in profusion, and fragrant aromas filled the air—one might well mistake it for a divine immortal’s grotto. The Judge and the Perfected One ascended to the main hall, where they summoned forth several gentlemen to meet them. They appeared adorned in sky-piercing crowns, robes of cloud brocade, and pearl-studded shoes. After exchanging bows, host and guest took their seats and exchanged greetings over tea.

The Judge said, “This gentleman here, Master Sa, is a mortal from the yang world, bearing the title Perfected One. He has come today on a special visit during his tour of the Underworld.” The gentlemen replied, “We are honored by your radiant presence.” The Judge asked, “Master Sa, do you recognize any of these venerable lords?” The Perfected One replied, “I have not had the honor of acquaintance.”

The Judge explained, “All these gentlemen are models of deep filial piety. This one’s surname is Meng, given name Zong. His mother fell ill one winter month and longed for bamboo shoot soup. Holding a bamboo stalk, he wept, and lo! the shoot sprouted. Later, the court honored him as Grand Master of the Palace of Light. This one’s surname is Jiang, given name Shi. He was devoted to his mother, who loved to drink river water and eat raw fish slices. One day, a spring welled up nearby, tasting just like river water, and every day two carp leapt forth from it, which he offered to his mother. The court later honored him as Vice Minister of the Secretariat. Another’s surname was Huang, given name Xiang. At nine years old, he fanned his mother’s pillow in summer and warmed her quilt in winter. The court honored him as Censor-in-Chief. The rest, for the most part, are filial sons, all dwelling within this Mansion of Filial Devotion.”

The Perfected One nodded repeatedly, then asked, “Since all here are filial sons, why do they not reincarnate into the world?” The Judge replied, “Those who dwell within the Platform of Rewarding Good Deeds receive the righteous qi of Heaven and Earth, without end or cessation. When a wise sovereign rules the land, they are born as kings, nobles, generals, or ministers, their fame lasting a hundred generations. When no such ruler reigns, they peacefully enjoy the Yin Court, silently receiving Heaven’s blessings.” The Perfected One said, “Such reverence for filial sons!” and bowed respectfully before taking his leave.

They proceeded to the second palace, whose vermilion plaque bore the inscription “Mansion of Brotherly Duty.” Judge Cui led the Perfected One inside, with the same ceremonial attendants, the same celestial music, and the same heavenly blossoms. Several gentlemen appeared again, wearing sky-piercing crowns, cloud brocade robes, and pearl-studded shoes. After exchanging bows, the Judge asked, “Do you recognize any of these Perfected Ones?” The Perfected One replied, “My eyes are poor; I cannot be sure.”

The Judge said, “These gentlemen are all models of fraternal virtue. Let me tell you briefly about a few. One is surnamed Jiang, given name Gun. His younger brother, named Jijang, was ambushed by thieves in the wild. The brothers fought to the death; the bandits released them and fled. They once shared a single quilt. Another is surnamed Yu, given name Gun. During a great epidemic, his eldest brother died, and the second brother fell gravely ill. While the family fled the plague, Gun alone stayed to care for his brother. Later, when the second brother recovered, the elders said, ‘Only in the cold of winter do we know that pine and cypress are the last to wither.’ Another is surnamed Tian, given name Zhen. He had a second younger brother, named Shi Guang, and a youngest brother, named Qing. Their family once debated dividing their estate. Before their courtyard stood a purple bauhinia tree, which they planned to cut into three. One night, it suddenly withered and died. The virtuous brothers embraced the tree and wept, saying, ‘Even plants and trees have no heart to be split apart; how much less should people?’ They ceased their division, and the purple bauhinia flourished anew. The rest, by and large, are all devoted to the path of brotherly duty.” The Perfected One nodded and withdrew.

Next, they entered the third palace, whose vermilion plaque bore the four characters “Mansion of Loyalty and Integrity.” Judge Cui and the Perfected One entered, accompanied by the usual attendants. Several gentlemen appeared, again in sky-piercing crowns, cloud brocade robes, and pearl-studded shoes, bowing alongside Judge Cui. The Judge said, “These gentlemen are those who forgot their families for their country—loyal ministers and heroic martyrs. Do you recognize them, Perfected One?” The Perfected One replied, “I know a few by sight. Are those two Lords Zhou Hanya and Ma Fubo?” The Judge said, “Yes.” The Perfected One continued, “And those two, are they Lord Zhang Suiyang and Lord Yan Pingyuan of the Tang?” The Judge said, “Indeed.” The Judge then asked how the Perfected One recognized these four. The Perfected One said, “In the yang world, I have wandered to various shrines of meritorious officials, where their divine images are sculpted. Some resemble these four venerable lords.” The Judge said, “The others are all loyal and righteous men, residing within this Mansion of Loyalty and Integrity.” The Perfected One said, “So these venerable lords still enjoy peace in the Yin Court. ‘Snow and frost cover the lonely old minister for ten thousand miles; the radiant mountain of righteousness endures a thousand years.’ Truly so! Truly so!” They then took their leave.

They came to the fourth palace, whose vermilion plaque read “Mansion of Faithfulness and Sincerity.” Judge Cui led the Perfected One inside, with the same ceremonial attendants. Several gentlemen appeared, attired as before, bowing respectfully. The Judge said, “These gentlemen are all men who hold truth as truth, guardians of faithfulness. Do you recognize them, Perfected One?” The Perfected One said, “I do not know them.” The Judge said, “Let me tell you briefly. One is surnamed Zhu, given name Hui, a man of complete trust among friends and urgent matters of friends’ wives, who rose to the rank of Left Vice Minister of the Secretariat. Another is surnamed Fan, styled Juqing, who never failed an appointment even a thousand li away. Another is surnamed Deng, given name Shutong. He was betrothed to a lady of the Xia family, who became mute from illness. When advised to choose another bride, he said, ‘I have already pledged; how can I abandon her like a broken promise?’ He never remarried. The rest are all gentlemen of truthfulness and sincerity, residing within this Mansion of Faithfulness and Sincerity.” The Perfected One took his leave.

They arrived at the fifth palace, whose vermilion plaque read “Mansion of Cautious Propriety.” Judge Cui led the Perfected One inside, with the usual attendants. Several gentlemen appeared, dressed as before, bowing respectfully. The Judge said, “Do you recognize these venerable lords, Perfected One?” The Perfected One said, “I have not met them.” The Judge said, “They are all humble, modest, and observant of propriety. Let me tell you briefly. One is Lord Chi of Lu, aged seventy, who dared not exceed propriety. He once said, ‘Gentlemen cherish humility to perfect their name; petty men feign humility to avoid punishment.’ The Duke of Lu was granted ten thousand strings of coins annually. Another is surnamed Wang, given name Zhen, who died at sixty-four. The Lord of the Underworld favored his modest virtue and extended his life by ten years, so he lived to seventy-six. Another is surnamed Di, given name Qingchen, who was once a guest prone to drunken raving. When someone threw a cup at his face, he bowed and apologized humbly, becoming ever more courteous, eventually rising to the office of Chief Military Commissioner. The rest are all respectful and courteous men, residing within this Mansion of Cautious Propriety.” The Perfected One said, “‘Humility brings benefit; pride invites loss.’ Well said. These gentlemen enjoy peace in the Yin Court.”

They reached the sixth palace, whose vermilion plaque read “Mansion of Esteeming Righteousness.” With the usual attendants, they saw several gentlemen as before, bowing respectfully. The Judge asked, “Do you recognize these gentlemen, Perfected One?” The Perfected One said, “I cannot identify them.” The Judge said, “They are all gentlemen whose righteousness is as heavy as a mountain. Let me tell you briefly. One is surnamed Wu, given name Dazhi. When his sister-in-law died, he sold himself into servitude to pay for her funeral. His brother and sister-in-law sold themselves as well, and sold ten acres of land to redeem him. Emperor Gao of Qi heard of his righteousness and granted him two hundred acres. Another is surnamed Zhang, given name Gongyi. He once wrote the character ‘endure’ one hundred times; his family lived together for nine generations. Another is Chen Yimen of Jiangzhou, also nine generations living together. Their hundred dogs ate from the same kennel; if one dog did not come, the hundred dogs would not eat. The Southern Tang honored them as the House of Righteousness. The rest are all gentlemen who value righteousness, residing within this Mansion of Esteeming Righteousness.” The Perfected One said, “‘The world is full of greed; how many cherish righteousness and share wealth?’ These venerable lords surely belong in this Mansion of Righteousness.”

The seventh palace bore a vermilion plaque inscribed “Mansion of Purity and Integrity.” Judge Cui led the Perfected One inside, with the usual attendants. Several gentlemen appeared, dressed as before, bowing respectfully. The Judge said, “Do you recognize these venerable lords, Perfected One?” The Perfected One said, “I dare not claim familiarity, but I recognize a few.” The Judge asked, “Which ones do you recognize?” The Perfected One said, “One is Scholar Li, given name Ben. He kept himself pure and upright, was sent as envoy to the Turks, and died on the journey, wrapped only in a coarse woolen blanket. There is a poem: ‘Covering oneself only with a humble cloak, carrying no riches like Lu Jia.’ Another is Vice Envoy Sun, given name Heng. He never engaged in business; on his desk lay only a single volume of admonitions. When he died, he left no money or silk to his descendants. Another is Lord Zhao Gui, Prefect of Qizhou. When he entered court, the elders sent him off saying, ‘You are as pure as water; please accept this cup of water as a farewell.’ Do I truly recognize these lords?” The Judge said, “Yes. But one is Lord Yang Zhen of the Former Han, Governor of Zhuo Commandery, who refused gold at night. Another is Lord Liu Chong of the Later Han, Governor of Kuaiji, who accepted only a single coin as tribute. Another is Lord Deng Shuo of the Jin, Governor of Shao in Wu, who drank only water from the Wu River. You do not yet recognize them all.” The Perfected One said, “These are figures of former dynasties; I have not truly known them.” The Judge said, “Let us proceed to the eighth palace for a look.”

The vermilion plaque read “Mansion of Pure Shame.” The Perfected One followed the Judge inside, with the usual attendants. Several gentlemen appeared, dressed as before, bowing respectfully. The Judge said, “Do you recognize these venerable lords, Perfected One?” The Perfected One said, “I recognize one or two. One is Lord Wu Bocheng, a Censor who judged cases with virtue. When someone thanked him with a bar of gold, Lord Wu said, ‘Take it quickly; do not shame my eyes.’ Another is Lord Wang, Chief Military Commissioner, given name Pu. He once carried a tally to inspect customs; when a county official offered him gold, Lord Wang said, ‘Do you love me, or do you shame me?’ and firmly refused it.” Having recognized these two, the Perfected One asked Judge Cui, “Sir, are these lords truly as I say?” The Judge said, “Indeed. But the one before was Scholar Guan, who shunned ornate clothes to keep his body pure, wearing simple cloth all his life; the one on the left was an Inspector, who shunned the dirt of carriages and horses, traveling on foot; the one on the right was Chief Military Commissioner Fan, who shunned the filth of grand halls, living at a humble gate with mulberry and mulberry trees. You have yet to recognize these.” The Perfected One said, “Times change. These are men of the Han and Tang dynasties; I have not truly known them.” They then took their leave.

The Judge said, “Having toured all these immortal mansions, let us now visit the ‘Platform of Punishing Evil Deeds.’” The Perfected One asked, “What is the Platform of Punishing Evil Deeds like?” The Judge said, “It also has eight offices, corresponding to unfilialty, unbrotherliness, disloyalty, untrustworthiness, rudeness, unrighteousness, dishonesty, and shamelessness. All are first-class evildoers, enduring punishments there.” The Perfected One said, “Since they are evildoers, there is no need to look upon them. As the ancients say, ‘Seeing goodness is like chasing after it; seeing evil is like touching boiling water.’ Why gaze upon them?” The Judge said, “Come, I will take you to the gates of Hell to have a look. How about that?” The Perfected One asked, “How many layers does Hell have?” The Judge replied, “There are eighteen divisions, but in total only nine layers.”

Thus ends the Perfected One’s inspection of the Underworld. The next chapter will unfold the details of Hell.
