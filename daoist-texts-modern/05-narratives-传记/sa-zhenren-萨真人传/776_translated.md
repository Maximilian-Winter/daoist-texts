# Chapter Thirteen: Immortal Sa Tours the Underworld, Lord Guan Guides the Immortal Back

Now it happened that Judge Cui led the Immortal to the Yin Mountain Underworld, with Wang Shan following behind. Upon arriving at Yin Mountain, the scene was altogether different. The sunlight was dim and wan, the cold wind howled fiercely. All around stood walls of iron and cities of bronze; before them was a single gate. The gate was forged from molten iron, its surface blackened and flat, bearing four large white characters: "Gate of Universal Plunder." The judge approached the gate and called out, “Open the gate!”

Before his words had even finished, two little demons emerged from either side—both bull-headed yakshas, their forms strange and grotesque. They shouted, “Tut tut!” and opened the gate. Then, startled, they said, “Today’s fate is strange indeed, to run into this Daoist ghost. Where would we find so much money to give him?” One yaksha said, “That Daoist isn’t the problem; it’s the big demons inside here who are even fiercer than I.” The judge barked, “Nonsense! He’s a living person, and that divine Daoist is his subordinate. Now that we’ve come to the Underworld, the King Yan has ordered me to show him around. Who dares say another word?” Hearing this, neither yaksha dared utter a sound.

The judge and the Immortal stepped inside, entering the first layer of the underworld, above whose gate hung a plaque inscribed with four great characters: “Prison of Wind and Thunder.” The Immortal approached a small door to peer inside and saw a bronze pillar standing upright. A guilty man was bound fast to the pillar, surrounded by a great bronze ring fitted with short, sharp blades. A little demon struck the ring with a whip, and the wind howled in response. The louder the wind howled, the faster the ring spun. The ring pressed close to the man’s body, the blades embedded in the ring stabbed fiercely as it whirled. Soon, a thunderclap sounded beneath the ring, shattering the man into pulp! After the man was dead, the little demon whipped the ring again—a retreating whip—and with a crack, the thunder ceased and the wind stilled. Slowly, a swirling vortex of wind on the ground spun left and right, gathering the scattered remains and bones back into their original form: once again, a man. The Immortal asked, “Master Cui, what thunder is this? And what wind is this?” The judge replied, “The thunder is called the Black Heaven Thunder, and the wind is the Wind of Resentful Karma.” The Immortal asked, “Who are these people?” The judge said, “They are those who committed the ten unpardonable evils in the world of the living. They must pass through this prison of wind and thunder.”

Next, they came to the second layer of the underworld, where the plaque read: “Prison of Vajra.” The Immortal stepped through the small gate to take a look. On the ground lay a rough stone mill, about eight feet in diameter, square and round at once. Sitting at the eight directions around it were eight great demons. One demon held a heavy iron hammer, while four others stood around. These four demons each grabbed a man, kicked him onto the millstone, and then all eight demons struck him with their hammers, pounding him into a pulp like a flattened persimmon cake. One after another, they kicked and hammered, until at last a little demon said, “It’s better to make him into a cake, but he still must be ground again.” One of the four demons took a cake and placed it on some glowing coals, burning it a little. Yet, in the end, it was still the same man. The Immortal’s heart chilled, and he said, “Master Cui, the gate inside is truly terrifying.” The judge replied, “Have you not heard: ‘The human heart is like iron but not truly iron; the official law is like a furnace, and once entered, there is no escape.’”

Then they arrived at the third layer, the plaque reading: “Prison of the Fire Chariot.” The Immortal entered through the small gate to look. There was a wheel-shaped chariot carrying several men. The little demons gave a whistle, and the chariot surged forward. The demons blew a breath beneath the wheel, and flames burst forth. The chariot sped swiftly, the fire blazed fiercely, and in moments, a man was burned to a crisp, reduced to a lump of glowing coal. Yet they took him again, sprinkled a few drops of cool water, and he was still the same man. The Immortal asked, “That chariot’s fire is so fierce—how can a man burned thus return to his original form?” The judge said, “This is because their resentful karma is entangled for hundreds of thousands of kalpas.”

They then came to the fourth layer, the plaque reading: “Prison of the Murky Cold.” The Immortal went to look inside. There was a round pool of clear water, with a group of little demons standing on either side, shouting “Wah!” Each demon tossed a man into the pool, where a giant catfish opened its wide mouth and swallowed him whole. Another little demon shouted “Wah!” and tossed in another man, swallowed by another catfish. Ten men were tossed in before the pool was full. After one round, the pool was full of catfish swimming about, looking bloated and drunk. Then the demons shouted, “Wah! Return my original men!” At their call, the catfish vanished. Another group of golden-threaded carp appeared, each carrying a man in its mouth. Tossed onto the pool’s surface, the men reappeared, soaked through and shivering with cold. The Immortal asked, “Are these fish trained?” The judge said, “No. The fish forget death when they swallow their prey. Those who do evil are always foolish.”

Next, they reached the fifth layer, the plaque reading: “Prison of the Oil Dragon.” The Immortal approached to look and saw several generals inside. Hanging from the pillar tops was a dragon, and bound beneath each pillar were guilty men, naked without a shred of cloth. The little demons struck the dragon’s head, and boiling oil dripped from its mouth, pouring down onto the men’s heads. Their skin split, their flesh melted, leaving only a handful of bare bones. When only bones remained, the little demons poured a pail of cold water over them, and yet the man was still the same. The Immortal said, “What a cruel prison, the Oil Dragon’s!” The judge said, “Those who do evil are repaid by Heaven’s justice; when the time comes, there is no freedom.”

They came to the sixth layer, the plaque inscribed: “Prison of the Venomous Basin.” The Immortal peered outside the small gate and saw a deep pit of earth filled with poisonous snakes, venomous scorpions, and black vipers. The little demons grabbed a guilty man and threw him into the pit. The snakes and insects hissed and swarmed, some eating flesh, some gnawing skin, others sucking blood, until no human form remained. Another man was thrown in, and the venomous creatures tore him apart as well. Many were thrown in, many devoured, until at last a little demon shouted, “Come up!” Holding a small flute, he blew a note, and sure enough, the men emerged, their skin torn and flesh shredded, their bodies battered and broken. Who would not cry out in pain? The Immortal asked, “Where do these evil creatures come from?” The judge said, “They were all created by Heaven and Earth.” The Immortal said, “Such torment!” The judge replied, “As the saying goes, ‘Evil men have evil tormentors; when enemies meet, there is no escape.’”

The seventh layer bore the plaque: “Prison of Pestle and Mortar.” The Immortal approached and looked inside. In the main hall stood a great mortar, about ten feet wide. Four little demons surrounded it, one holding a large pestle. They threw a guilty man into the mortar, and with a unified pounding, in moments he was ground to a paste like crushed garlic. The paste was shaped into a large lump and placed on a rack for soul return. They ground several men, making several lumps, all placed on the rack. At the end, with a crack, the lumps returned to the original men—though no longer skin, no longer flesh, but pitiful indeed.

The eighth layer’s plaque read: “Prison of Knives and Saws.” The Immortal approached and looked inside. Within the small gate, two wooden boards clamped a guilty person—man or woman. A group of little demons pulled a saw from head to toe, cutting through skin and flesh. Some were sawed in two, some in three parts, others in four strips. When finished, a little demon took a broom and swept over their bodies. Yet each remained a man or woman. The Immortal said, “So cruel, so pitiful. Let us move on.” The judge said, “There is still one more prison; better to see it through.”

They came to the ninth layer, the plaque reading: “Prison of the Boiling Cauldron.” The Immortal approached and looked inside. There stood a huge bronze cauldron, blazing with fierce fire. A group of little demons took a guilty man, cutting a piece of flesh from his left side and throwing it into the pot to fry; then a piece from his right side to boil. They cut until skin revealed flesh, flesh revealed sinew, sinew revealed bone, cooking all into a pot of oil. Then they threw in the man’s bones and his heart and five viscera, boiling them into a thick soup. Several little demons ladled the soup with iron scoops, adding a bowl of water—and yet, the man remained the same. The Immortal’s heart trembled with fear, and Judge Cui had no choice but to lead him out.

They then came to the City of Wrongful Death. The judge led, the Immortal followed, and Wang Shan accompanied them. After walking less than half a mile, they arrived in the city. Two or three resentful ghosts seized the Immortal, saying, “Sa Shoujian, you once wielded pen and sword to trap and kill us. We have awaited this day.” Before they finished, three or four more wrongful death ghosts came, cackling, “Good, good! Sa Shoujian has come!” The ghosts gathered in groups and began to beat the Immortal, but Judge Cui quickly shouted, “I am here! No disrespect allowed!” Wang Shan raised his whip and shouted, “Who dares strike my Immortal?” The ghosts dared not move.

An elder ghost, about eighty or ninety years old, hearing the commotion, came out and shouted, “You ghosts, cease your quarrels!” The ghosts said, “Master, you do not know. This man is from Xihe in Shu, our fellow countryman. When he was an official, he wielded pen and sword to incite lawsuits and trap us to death. Today, seeing him, we hate that he is no gentleman.” Another group of ghosts said, “Later, he practiced medicine—quack medicine—and gave us poison, causing our deaths. Today, seeing him, we say he is no true man.” The elder asked, “What is this man’s name?” The ghosts said, “His surname is Sa, given name Shoujian.”

The elder immediately bowed low, tears flowing, saying, “He is my benefactor.” The Immortal was unaware of the cause. The elder said, “I am Zheng Deweng, who died in Xipu. He buried me with kindness, my grandson was saved, my daughter-in-law was spared. I never expected to see him today.” The ghosts, seeing the elder bow so, were all shocked but said, “We cannot show such favor today; we only want our lives returned.” The Immortal said, “I have come to seek the King Yan on your behalf, to ask for your transcendence. Luckily, Judge Cui is here to witness.” The judge said, “I hold the pen of life and death; I will now register your rebirth.” The ghosts said, “Though the judge is willing to register our reincarnation, the other clerks and demons demand much money and favors, and even the patrol officers expect bribes.”

The elder said, “In that case, I recently performed merit-making rites at home for my release. The King Yan appointed me as the lord of the City of Wrongful Death. I have some money and tally slips; you ghosts may take two to divide among yourselves. This is my small thanks to the Immortal.” The Immortal said, “Since I have no money, I would rather return the lives of the resentful ghosts than accept such gifts.” The judge said, “That is no problem; you can send the money back to the elder in the living world.” The Immortal said, “So be it; I will borrow some for now, that is acceptable.” The elder then called the wrongful death ghosts to carry two tallies of yellow money. The ghosts quickly brought them, and the Immortal repeatedly entreated Judge Cui to carefully register these people’s release; this was no small matter.

Meanwhile, a group of about fifty or sixty ghostly boys and girls saw Wang Shan and rushed over, saying, “This is the King of Great Fortune. In years past, he demanded our sacrifices, killing us young. Today, we will not let him go.” They all seized him, beating and cursing, demanding his life. At this moment, the judge tried to persuade them, the elder tried to calm them, and the Immortal repeatedly entreated, “Children, do not seize him. This is the judge; I have asked him to register your release.” But the children were disrespectful and would not listen. They pulled and dragged, insisting on taking him to see King Yan.

Judge Cui and the elder did not know the cause. The Immortal said, “This man’s surname is Wang, given name Shan. He was once the god of the Great Fortune Temple, demanding annual sacrifices of boys and girls. I destroyed his temple and ended his sacrifices. He has now reformed and follows me. Today he has met his old enemies. This is truly a case of ‘resentment has a head, debt has a master.’ What can be done?” The judge said, “If so, Lord Wang is also caught in great resentful karma. Those boys and girls pulling him to see King Yan will bring many difficulties.” The Immortal, helpless, had to take his leave of the elder and follow Wang Shan to King Yan to seek a solution.

As fate would have it, halfway there, a heavenly deity descended, and the deity sang:

Eyebrows arched like twin silkworms,  
A tiger’s waist stretched a full ten feet.  
Galloping Red Hare, the vermilion steed,  
Shining Azure Dragon crescent moon blade.  
A jade belt tied with gentle grace,  
Clad in a robe of brilliant crimson.

The Immortal looked and saw it was Lord Guan. How came Lord Guan in Fengdu? Long ago, he had stood with Master Zhang Dao Ling, who forged a document to send Lord Guan to Fengdu, intending to imprison him there forever. Passing by, Patriarch Pu’an tore open the document and saw it was Lord Guan himself condemning himself. Pu’an thus changed it to “Eternal Guardian of Fengdu,” so Lord Guan remained stationed in the land of Fengdu.

Lord Guan dismounted and bowed to Immortal Sa. The children, lacking respect, upon seeing Lord Guan, immediately released Wang Shan to look at Lord Guan, then went to admire the Red Hare vermilion horse. The judge said, “Immortal, it would be best to entrust your exit from this shadowy underworld to General Guan, and leave Wang Shan here, to avoid the children’s entanglements.” Lord Guan nodded slightly, dismounted, and walked forward. The Immortal bade farewell to Judge Cui, with Wang Shan following and Lord Guan leading them out. After a few steps, the Immortal turned back to the judge and said, “Master Cui, please pay many respects to King Yan for me, and especially register the release of these boys and girls.” The judge replied, “No need to see you off further.”

The children turned and saw Wang Shan leave, eager to pursue but unable to catch him. They began to cry in small groups. The judge said, “Children, do not weep. I will take you to the Wheel-turning King to arrange your rebirth.” So the boys and girls followed the judge away. Lord Guan led the Immortal and Wang Shan along the Yin Mountain path. Countless resentful ghosts called out, “Immortal, Immortal, since you have toured the shadowy realm, when you return to the living world, please hold a grand fast to universally save our wandering souls.” The Immortal promised and went on.

After walking a few miles, they rounded Yin Mountain. Here the cold wind blew sharply, and darkness prevailed. Lord Guan lit the path with the gleam of his blade and led the way. After several miles, the way suddenly opened wide. Lord Guan said to the Immortal, “This is the boundary between yin and yang. I cannot accompany you further.” They parted ways.

The Immortal then returned with Wang Shan to the living world. They went straight back to Xihe to establish a Daoist altar for rescuing the suffering souls of the dead. But that is a story for the next chapter.
