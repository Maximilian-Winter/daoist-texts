# Chapter Fourteen: The Perfected Establishes the Great Offering at the Western River; the Venerable Xu Jing Ascends

Now, it is told that the Perfected Master Sa returned to the Western River. His fields still remained, his houses still stood. The Master then wrote out the deed and sold it to others. With the money obtained, he arranged a grand offering lasting ten days and ten nights. He summoned the yellow-crowned feathered attendants and burned vast quantities of pure incense—incense of purity, incense of nature, incense of non-action. He set before them many joyous ritual foods: food of dharmic delight, nectar food, and food for humans and heavens alike. He chanted many sutras: the Scripture for Delivering Beings, the Scripture for Dispelling Calamities, and the Scripture for Saving from Suffering. He performed numerous compassionate repentances: the Repentance of Mercy, the Repentance of the Netherworld, and the Repentance for Delivering the Lost. He raised a banner high, summoning all the lonely souls of the underworld.

The male souls gathered as one cluster, the female souls as another; the old souls formed a group, the young souls another; the mad, the paralyzed, and the crippled souls clustered as one. Three meals a day were offered to them, all arranged with perfect order and harmony!

Such a grand fast and offering moved the Jade Emperor of Heaven. The Jade Emperor feared that some wild spirits, fierce monsters, great demons, or minor devils might obstruct the sacred dao site. Therefore, he dispatched the Spirit Officer Ma to the mortal realm to watch over the offering altar. Whenever the food was offered, Spirit Officer Ma saw demons and monsters rushing in disorderly to snatch it. He then unleashed the Samadhi fire to burn them away. The food offered was scorched to dryness, and even the wandering souls could not partake.

Suddenly, in the midst of the Southern Sea, a female Bodhisattva perceived this. This Bodhisattva was described thus:

Her face like a full moon, her beauty like pear blossoms. Pearls and jade adorned her temples, unadorned yet radiant; her chest was draped with interlaced necklaces and hairpins. The Red Boy was enveloped in flames, the Dragon Maiden’s hair coiled in twin buns. In her bamboo basket swam a golden carp; in her pure vase bloomed two lotus flowers. From the distant Purple Bamboo Forest, she gazed upon the water’s moon; her home was deep within the Putuo Rock.

This female Bodhisattva was none other than Guanyin, the Compassionate One who Saves from Suffering and Distress. From her vantage at Putuo Rock in the Southern Sea, with her wisdom eye she saw that Perfected Master Sa had set up this great offering, yet the ghosts and spirits could not receive the food—it was all in vain. Moved by a single thought of compassion, a plan formed in her heart. She mounted a cloud of auspicious vapor and flew straight to the Western River. There, she transformed into a ghost king with three heads and six arms, a blue face and bared fangs, mingling among the spirits at the altar to snatch the food.

Spirit Officer Ma saw this and unleashed the true Samadhi fire to burn among the ghosts. What a ghost king indeed! But Guanyin sprinkled sweet dew water, and the fire was extinguished. Truly it was as the saying goes: “Within the encirclement of myriad perfected ones, amidst a hundred billion auspicious lights.” Only then could the ghosts fully feast on the pure offerings, and the cold forest was free of resentment and suffering.

See how Guanyin’s single compassionate thought was truly good, truly good! Perfected Master Sa’s ten-day, ten-night offering was completed. He then distributed many spirit money notes to aid the ghosts. He also sent two sets of spirit money and an official document, directly dispatching a talisman envoy to the City of the Wrongly Dead, delivering them to Lady Zheng De. With merit perfected, the ghosts joyfully dispersed, their hearts light as the heavens. Guanyin then revealed her true form, mounted a cloud, and returned to the Southern Sea. Suddenly, in midair, she encountered three immortals: Zhang Xu Jing, Wang Fang Ping, and Immortal Ge. Guanyin caught the cloud and exchanged a verse with them.

Zhang Xu Jing, the Heavenly Master, along with Immortals Ge and Wang, steadied the cloud and asked, “Great Venerable, from where do you come, and where do you come to save from suffering?”

Guanyin replied, “At the Western River, Perfected Master Sa Shoujian established a grand offering to deliver the lost. I came from there bearing sweet dew water.”

Zhang Xu Jing said, “Excellent, excellent.” Then he inquired, “Has Sa Shoujian’s merit now been fulfilled?”

Guanyin answered, “This person has cultivated for decades, aiding the living in the mortal realm and transcending ghosts in the netherworld. His merit is immeasurable. You should report this to the Jade Emperor and have him enter the ranks of immortals, with the title ‘Shangqing’ bestowed.”

The three immortals said, “We three have just returned from Mount Penglai and have this very intention. Tomorrow we shall present it to the Jade Emperor and recommend this person.”

Guanyin said, “I have heard that you initially transmitted his method; now you recommend him again. This is truly a perfect completion from beginning to end.” With that, they parted ways. This matter will not be further detailed here.

Meanwhile, Zhang Xu Jing, Wang Fang Ping, and Immortal Ge arrived outside the Three Heavens Gate, where the Jade Emperor was seated in his imperial hall. Red clouds swirled, and auspicious vapors filled the air. To the left stood the Solar Palace with the Sun Emperor; to the right, the Lunar Palace with the Moon Empress. To the left were the Three Officials Great Emperors; to the right, the Four Sacred Perfected Lords. To the left were the Twenty-Eight Constellation Governors; to the right, the Three Hundred and Sixty Responsive Heavenly Venerables.

Zhang Xu Jing, together with Wang and Ge, bowed deeply before the Bright Hall and reported: “In the Western River of Shu, there is a dharma lineage named Sa, with the surname Shoujian. He has cultivated for more than a decade, bearing the talismanic register and bearing the title of Perfected. He aids living beings in the mortal realm and transcends ghosts in the netherworld. His merit and practice are complete. We humbly request the august decree to elevate him to the ranks of immortals in the Nine Heavens.”

The Jade Emperor, upon hearing this, was greatly pleased and said, “Sa Shoujian’s cultivation is complete; he shall enter the ranks of immortals. Dispatch the Scarlet-Robed Envoy riding the Red Qiu, bearing the Jade Scepter, to summon him to the Heavenly Bureau and confer the immortal office.”

Zhang, Wang, and Ge thanked the Jade Emperor and withdrew outside the Three Heavens Gate to await the Scarlet-Robed Envoy’s descent to the heavenly court. This matter shall not be further recounted here.

Meanwhile, Perfected Master Sa, having completed the offering at the Western River, took up residence at Yongtai Temple. There, he set up his alchemical furnace and began to refine the “Great Returning Elixir.” Using cinnabar as the Father, mercury as the Mother, and black lead as the Child, he employed the civil and martial fires, gathered the essences of sun and moon, and through seven returns and nine reversions, forged the Golden Elixir.

Just as he was about to set out on his travels, suddenly Wang Shan appeared in his true form and said, “A heavenly edict is about to arrive, summoning the Perfected to assume the Heavenly Pivot. You need not journey afar.”

Before the words were finished, from the blue sky above, faint colored clouds appeared. In midair, a strange fragrance drifted down, filling a hundred li with scent. A celestial music ensemble played, clear and resonant. Soon the Scarlet-Robed Envoy arrived, riding the Red Qiu and holding the Jade Scepter. He came directly to Yongtai Temple, presenting a heavenly scroll to the Perfected, saying, “Perfected Master, your cultivation is complete. Heavenly Masters Zhang Xu Jing, Immortal Ge, and Wang Fang Ping have long petitioned for your return to assume the Heavenly Pivot. The supreme bliss of Heaven is without suffering; you should hasten your journey.”

In a moment, the Perfected’s spirit departed his body, and he died. He then followed Wang Shan and the Scarlet-Robed Envoy straight to the celestial palace. At the Three Heavens Gate, Zhang, Wang, and Ge awaited him. Upon seeing them, the Perfected was overjoyed and could not contain his gratitude. He kowtowed and said, “Your disciple Sa Shoujian once received your transmitted dharma teachings and now is graced with your recommendation. The favor of Heaven is beyond repayment!”

The three masters said, “You have transmitted our dharma, you have practiced our teachings; you have not disappointed our hopes. Rejoice, rejoice!”

With these words, Wang Shan again kowtowed. The Heavenly Master asked, “Who is this person?”

The Perfected replied, “This is Wang Shan, the temple deity of Xiangyin, whom I have taken as a general under my command.”

Zhang Ying Jing, together with Wang and Ge, then led the Perfected to the Bright Hall to pay homage to the Jade Emperor. Zhang Xu Jing again petitioned: “I, Zhang Xu Jing, together with Immortal colleagues Wang Fang Ping and Ge Xianweng, and the Scarlet-Robed Envoy, bring Perfected Sa Shoujian of the Western River to kneel before the Heavenly Throne, humbly requesting the imperial decree: what office shall be granted to Sa Shoujian?”

The Jade Emperor said, “Sa Shoujian’s cultivation is complete, and he is now named Perfected. He shall assume the office of Heavenly Pivot, overseeing the celestial bureau’s documents, entering and leaving before my presence.”

The Perfected thanked the Jade Emperor and then said, “I, Shoujian, have taken under my command Wang Shan, temple deity of Xiangyin, as a general. Now he awaits your decree outside the Three Heavens Gate. What office shall he be granted? I humbly request an imperial edict.”

The Jade Emperor, upon hearing this, declared, “Since Sa Shoujian has taken Wang Shan as a general, Wang Shan shall receive the office of Spirit Officer and forever serve under his command.”

The Perfected again expressed his gratitude. Then Zhang the Heavenly Master, along with Immortals Wang and Ge, led the Perfected down from the Bright Hall. Golden Boys and Jade Girls each bore banners, canopies, and treasures, escorting the Perfected into the palace of the Heavenly Pivot. All the immortals came to offer congratulations.

At that time, the Perfected had died at Yongtai Temple, where the monks prepared a coffin and buried him. Later, his corpse was no longer seen. It was known that the Perfected had shed his physical form and departed. I commend this event and thus compose the “Record of the Incantation Date.”
