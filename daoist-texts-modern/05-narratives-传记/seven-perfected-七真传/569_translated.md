# Chapter One: Compassion Bestowed in Poverty’s Hour — A Dream Reveals the Path Ahead

To do good, one must act from sincerity;  
Do not buy empty fame nor seek vain renown.  

What use is hollow fame and empty praise?  
They only stir the poor to speak of injustice.  

In the waning days of the Yan and Song dynasties,  
In Shaanxi’s Xianyang County stood a village named Great Wei,  
With over a hundred households, most bearing the name Wang—  
Truly a great clan.  

Within this Wang clan lived a widowed woman,  
Over forty years of age, with a son and a daughter beneath her knees.  
Though her children had wed and been wed,  
Her heart was tender and kind.  

Seeing others’ little boys and girls, she treated them as her own,  
Never ceasing to scold or coax them as if kin.  
When the children cried, they called out “Mother!”—  
And she would answer without hesitation.  

Thus all called her “Mother Wang.”  

Mother Wang’s household was fairly prosperous,  
And she loved to do good deeds.  
Her greatest joy was in the twin paths of Buddha and Dao,  
Often offering vegetarian feasts to monks and spreading the teachings,  
Bowing before Buddhas and reading scriptures.  

All said she was a woman of virtue,  
And many monks and Daoists came to receive her alms.  
Poor folk from the village also came begging,  
And she gave what she could, little or much, at any time.  

One late winter day, when snow blanketed the horizon,  
Mother Wang stood at her door and saw two beggars coming through the snow,  
Seeking her charity.  

Mother Wang scolded them:  
“Why do you not go to work to earn your living,  
But instead beg from door to door?  
Surely you are idle, lazy, and fond of leisure.  
Who has spare tea and empty bowls to serve you?”  

Before she finished, several monks arrived to collect alms.  
Mother Wang gave them money and rice.  

After the monks left, the two beggars asked:  
“Kind mother, you gladly give to monks but not to the poor—why is this so?”  

Mother Wang replied:  
“It is not that I favor monks,  
For monks can chant sutras and Daoists can cultivate the Way.  
Though I give them but a little money and rice,  
The monks can dispel calamities for me,  
The Daoists can prolong my life.  
What benefit would there be in aiding you?  
You would only make noise at my door.”  

The beggars said:  
“To give kindness expecting no return is true charity;  
To expect reward is no charity at all.  
You give a bowl of rice, a few coins,  
Yet expect to dispel calamity and extend life—how mistaken!”  

With that, they departed.  

Giving to monks to weave good karma,  
Yet sparing no pity for the poor and suffering—  
Heaven esteems highest the merit of true compassion.  

The two beggars, denied by Mother Wang, moved onward.  
Soon they came to a vermilion gatehouse,  
Where they loudly called out, “Grandfather, please give alms!”  

After a while, a man appeared.  
His face was ruddy, his beard long, his spirit clear and bright,  
A man of generosity and magnanimity,  
A chivalrous air about him, aged about forty.  

His surname was Wang, given name Ji, styled Zhiming,  
And called Desheng by others.  

In youth he had studied poetry and prose,  
But failed to attain official rank,  
So he abandoned letters for arms,  
Winning the martial champion’s title,  
And held the office of Filial and Incorrupt Gentleman.  

On this snowy day, bitter cold,  
He sat before the hearth with his wife Zhou and son Qiulang,  
When they heard the cries outside,  
“Grandfather, please give alms!”  

Wang Wuji found it strange,  
And went out to see the two beggars at his gate.  
He asked them, “Are you calling on your grandfather for aid,  
Or is your grandfather the one seeking alms?”  

The beggars replied, “The matter cannot be explained—  
To explain would only breed suspicion.”  

Wang Wuji found their words reasonable,  
And asked no more.  

The wind howled, snow swirled like pear blossoms falling,  
Mountains were silent of birds, roads lost to footsteps.  

Wang Wuji saw the beggars wore but a single layer of clothes—  
How could they withstand such bitter cold?  

Moved by compassion, he said:  
“Forget the idle talk. In such heavy snow, how can you travel on?  
There is an empty room beside this gatehouse,  
Filled with scattered straw where you may sit or lie.  
Why not come inside and shelter from the snow?”  

The beggars answered, “That would be best.”  

Wang Wuji opened the room,  
And they entered to rest.  

He returned to the hall and sent his servant Yuwa  
To bring food and drink for the beggars.  

Thus a few generous souls, willing to loosen their wealth,  
Invited the poor inside from the cold.  

Only that year, Wang Wuji’s life was marked by such generosity—  
A spirit broad and magnanimous.  

The beggars stayed two days in Wang Wuji’s home,  
Until the sky cleared and they wished to leave.  

Wang Wuji came in, followed by Yuwa carrying wine and food.  
He said to the beggars, “I have been busy these days,  
But today I am free—shall we share a cup and warm ourselves with talk?”  

The two beggars eagerly agreed.  

Wang Wuji bade Yuwa set the table,  
And the beggars ate without reserve,  
Drinking down two whole jars in moments.  

Wang Wuji called for more wine,  
As they drank heartily.  

He asked, “Good friends, what are your names?  
What trade do you follow in life?”  

The beggars answered, “We do not know any trade.  
He is called Jin Chong, I am called Wuxin Chang.”  

Wang Wuji said, “I wish to gather some capital with you,  
To start a small business and earn a living—  
Would that not be better than begging?  
What say you?”  

Jin Chong waved his hand and said, “No, no.  
I have long lived a carefree life,  
And cannot bear the ties and troubles of business.”  

Seeing Jin Chong’s resolve, Wang Wuji turned to Wuxin Chang:  
“If Brother Jin cannot take up this small trade,  
Might you, Brother Wu, be willing?”  

Wuxin Chang replied, “My carefree life is even more so!  
I have heard the saying:  
‘The domestic chicken feeds near the soup pot;  
The wild crane soars freely without grain.’  

If I were to seek petty profits,  
How could I ever find true freedom?”  

Wang Wuji sighed:  
“From your words I see your noble spirit.  
Yet today the world values robes and titles,  
And loves silver and gold.  
If you remain so detached, who will recognize you?”  

Wuxin Chang said, “We do not seek recognition.  
If we did, we would not be reduced to begging.”  

Hearing their lofty words, Wang Wuji spoke no more,  
And ordered Yuwa to clear the dishes.  

The next day, the beggars took their leave.  
Wang Wuji escorted them beyond the village,  
Reluctant to part, he walked a few steps further.  

Suddenly he saw a bridge blocking the road.  
Wang Wuji thought, “There was no bridge here before.”  
He looked back at Great Wei Village,  
Now faint and unclear in the distance,  
And was puzzled.  

Just then Wuxin Chang called him back:  
“Filial and Incorrupt Gentleman, come quickly.”  

Wang Wuji turned and saw the two sitting at the bridge’s edge.  

Jin Chong clapped his hands and sang:  

“Money gathers and scatters,  
Robes and titles all decay in time.  
How unlike us two,  
Who dwell beyond the world’s bounds.  

No debts to the state,  
No children’s burdens to bear,  
No talk of good or bad,  
No words of rise or fall.  

No dealings with the vulgar world,  
Avoiding their strange suspicions.  

One tattered sleeve coat,  
Worn year after year,  
Rotted and mended anew,  
Washed clean and dried in the sun.  

By day it shields the body,  
By night it serves as cover,  
No fear of thieves or villains.  

Ever holding lofty aspirations,  
With one heart roaming the upper realms.  

If others knew my mind,  
They would surely bow in reverence.  

I hold boundless truth,  
Enduring for a thousand years.  

Alas, few recognize it,  
Turning grace into harm.”  

Wang Wuji stepped onto the bridge.  

Wuxin Chang said, “Filial and Incorrupt Gentleman,  
Since you accompany us this far,  
You must share a drink.”  

With that, he took from his sleeve a small tin bottle,  
Placed a cup atop it, and poured out fine wine,  
Offering it to Wang Wuji.  

Wang Wuji took it and drank it all at once,  
Three cups in a row,  
Till he was drunk and fell upon the bridge,  
Drowsy and ready to sleep.  

Suddenly Wuxin Chang came and pulled him up, saying:  
“Do not sleep, do not sleep!  
Come with us to see a wondrous sight.”  

Half-drunk and dazed, Wang Wuji followed.  

After a few steps, they came upon a towering mountain,  
So steep and high it blocked the path.  

Wang Wuji exclaimed, “Such a mountain!  
How can one climb it?”  

Jin Chong said, “Follow me, and you shall ascend with ease.”  

Wang Wuji followed without effort.  

In moments they reached the summit,  
Where the ground was flat and broad.  

There lay a great pool, filled with clear water,  
Within which bloomed seven golden lotus flowers,  
Each as large as a plate,  
Radiant and magnificent beyond compare.  

Wang Ji’s heart was filled with longing,  
He exclaimed again and again, “What wondrous lotus flowers!  
How can I pluck one to keep?”  

Before he finished speaking, Wuxin Chang leapt into the pool,  
Gathered all seven golden lotuses,  
And handed them to Wang Ji, saying:  

“Take these all with you,  
And guard them well.  

There are seven masters:  
Qiu, Liu, Tan, Ma, Hao, Wang, and Sun.  

These seven are your teachers and disciples.  
When you meet again,  
Be sure to awaken them with kindness,  
So as not to betray the meaning I entrust in you with these lotuses.”  

Wang Ji took the lotuses and held them close,  
Ready to return home.  

Before leaving, he asked Wuxin Chang,  
“When shall we meet again?”  

Wuxin Chang replied:  
“The time is not far off—  
Only two or three more,  
Still from the place of parting,  
At the bridge’s edge, all ties shall be resolved.”  

Hearing this, Wang Ji descended the mountain.  

Suddenly, he was caught by a vine at the roadside,  
And tumbled down the slope.  

His fate unknown—  
To be continued in the next chapter.
