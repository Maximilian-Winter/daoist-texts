# Chapter Two: Patriarch Lü Personally Transmits the Dao at the Bridge of Ten Thousand Ties — Filial Official Wang of Great Wei Village Feigns Stroke

Understanding is like finding a lamp in the night,  
A dark room without windows suddenly filled with light.  

If this body is not to be saved in this life,  
Then when else shall it be saved?

It is said that Wang the Filial Official, clutching seven lotus blossoms, stepped down the mountain path. Suddenly, his foot was caught by creeping vines, and he tumbled like a dragon falling. Startled awake, all phenomena vanished into emptiness—it had all been a dream. Opening his eyes, he found himself lying in his own study at home. His son, Qiulang, stood nearby. Wang coughed once, and Qiulang heard it, shouting out, “Father is awake! Father is awake!” That cry roused Lady Zhou, who hurried to inquire, “Has my lord sobered from wine?” Wang replied, “How strange! How strange!” Lady Zhou said, “All things arise from one’s own delusion; what is there to find strange?” Wang said, “I clearly sent the guests away, yet why am I still here at home?” Lady Zhou answered, “My lord, you are too reckless. Yesterday you sent off two beggars, and half a day passed without their return. I sent others to look for you several times, but you were nowhere to be found. I grew anxious and asked Uncle Wang Mao and Jade Maid to seek you out. Twenty li away, they found you lying on the bridge, deeply drunk and unconscious. They hired a cart to bring you home. You have slept a full day and night, and only now do you awaken. From now on, my lord must respect himself, drink less wine, conduct affairs properly, and avoid strangers of unknown origin. You now wear the court’s badge of honor and are respected by the townsfolk—how can you lie drunk in the wilderness and lose all dignity? Would that not bring ridicule upon yourself?”

Wang rose and thanked her, saying, “Madam, your words are like medicine and stone; how could I not engrave them on my heart? I think those two unfortunate friends yesterday must have been immortals.” Lady Zhou said, “They were clearly two beggars—how can you say they were immortals?” Wang replied, “By their speech and manner, I knew they must be immortals.” Lady Zhou asked, “What words did they speak? What deeds did they do? In what way were they like immortals?” Wang then recounted how he helped them raise capital, how he declined their offer, how the next day when he sent them off, they had already traveled more than twenty li, how they sang songs and offered wine, how they gathered lotus flowers on the mountain, and their parting words—he told Lady Zhou everything from beginning to end. He added, “I drank only three cups with them and was drunk for a whole day and night—so many strange things happened. If they were not immortals, how could such marvels be?” Lady Zhou said, “I have heard people say there are all sorts of scoundrels in the world who know the art of shrinking the earth, taking a single step to travel ten li, a thousand li in a day. They put poison in wine and carry it on their person. When they see a lone merchant or traveler, they offer wine. Once the wine touches the lips, the victim falls into unconsciousness. Then they steal silver and strip clothes. By the time you woke, they had vanished without a trace. If you are not careful, you will surely regret it later.”

When Lady Zhou finished speaking, Wang thought to himself: she is after all a woman, and if I argue with her, I will never make myself clear. Better to go along with her and end this matter. So he casually replied, “Madam, what you say is true. I shall take it to heart.” Lady Zhou withdrew. Wang often sat alone in his study, pondering the words of Golden Youth and Heartless Chang, turning them over and over, silently grasping their meaning. After many days, suddenly he awakened to the two characters “gold” and “heavy” (金重 jīnzhòng). Joined together they form the character “bell” (鐘 zhōng). Wu Xinchang wrote “Heartless Chang” (無心昌 wúxīn chāng); the character for “prosperous” (昌 chāng) without the “heart” radical (心 xīn) is the character “Lü” (呂 lǚ). Clearly, it was the two immortals Zhong and Lü who came to save me. I had no fate and missed them face to face. The more I think, the more it fits. I cannot help but sigh aloud, “What a pity! What a pity!” Suddenly recalling their parting words: the appointed time was not far, only two threes, still to meet at the place of separation, at the bridge to sever ten thousand ties. “Not far” must mean near. “Two threes” surely means the third day of the third month. “Place of separation”—to know the coming place, one must seek it at the place of departure. “Sever ten thousand ties” means all the myriad dharmas return to it. Thinking thus, joy rose in his heart.

Time flies like an arrow, the sun and moon like a shuttle. In the blink of an eye, the late winter has passed, and spring has come again.

Each year brings new phenomena,  
Ten thousand flowers compete to bloom anew.  

Children once young have all grown tall,  
Look again—now white-haired folk.

Now, Wang the Filial Official passed the New Year. In the blink of an eye, it was the third day of the third month. Secretly leaving home, he took the old road to the bridge and waited long. Seeing no one come, he silently pictured their forms, his heart deeply earnest. Standing at the bridgehead, looking east and west, suddenly he heard a voice behind him call out, “Why have you come so early, Lord Filial Official?” Wang turned and saw it was the two friends from last year. Hastening forward, he grasped their sleeves and said, “Two great immortals, since you left, I have missed you terribly.” Heartless Chang and Golden Youth sat down at the bridge. Wang knelt on both knees before them and said, “Your disciple Wang Ji, flesh and blood mortal, did not recognize the descent of the immortals and has often been disrespectful. I beg your pardon and forgiveness. Today to see your immortal faces again is truly a blessing of three lifetimes. I humbly seek your guidance to dispel my confusion and ascend the path of awakening. Your disciple’s gratitude is profound.” Saying this, he bowed deeply.

The two laughed heartily, golden light flowing from their mouths, dazzling the eyes. In a blink, their forms changed: the one on the left wore twin buns atop his head, loose robes draped his body, his face dark red like jujube, eyes bright as stars, a long beard hanging to his chest, a few goose-feather fans in his hand. The one on the right wore a nine-beam kerchief, yellow Taoist robes, a face like the full moon, eyes piercing, a sword at his side. They were indeed Patriarch Zhongli and Patriarch Lü Pure Yang. Wang knelt, bowing his head, not daring to look up.

Patriarch Lü said, “In ancient times, human hearts were simple and honest, customs pure and good. Those who taught the dao first imparted magical arts to protect the body, then passed on profound功 to achieve perfection. Nowadays, the world is degenerate, human hearts no longer as before. If one first teaches magical arts, it will surely harm the body. Therefore, first the profound功 is transmitted, no need for magical arts and the body is at peace; no need for transformations and the dao is complete. When the dao is complete, all dharmas are accessible; without seeking magical arts, magical arts are naturally attained. This is called the teaching of Complete Reality.”

He then expounded the wondrous principle of Complete Reality:

“The so-called Complete Reality means pure truth without falsehood. Who does not have a true heart? But one turn and it is no longer so. Who does not have true intention? One confusion and it is lost. Who does not speak with true feeling? One bias and it is wrong. The original heart is true; change and it becomes false heart. The initial intention is true; calculation and it becomes false intention. Ultimate feeling is true; perversity and it becomes false laziness. The so-called original heart is the innate heart; the so-called initial intention is the nascent intention; the so-called ultimate feeling is the nature’s feeling. In the heart there is true intention and true feeling; in feeling alone appears true heart and true intention. From true heart arises true intention; from true intention arises true feeling. This feeling is the natural scene, always the revelation of Heaven’s mechanism. Then how can one not be true? Without true heart, there is no true intention; without true intention, no true feeling. I have seen those who cultivate the dao, when moving, private thoughts arise; private thoughts mean the heart is not true. When still, desires follow one another; desire means the heart is not true. Private desires never cease, and sometimes there is no true intention at all, or half true and half false. At the half true and half false boundary, Heaven and man interact—this is intention, which feeling cannot conceal. To verify the true dao, first verify true feeling; to verify true feeling is to know whether the heart is true or not, whether intention is true or not. Therefore, the way of cultivating truth must begin with intention. If intention is sincere, the heart is also sincere; the feeling arising from the heart is also sincere. Sincerity is truth. If sincerity is not true, it appears in words as insincerity, not true words; in deeds as not following nature, not true deeds. The cultivator must remove the heart outside the heart, the intention outside the intention, the feeling outside the feeling. When raising a thought or speaking, one must lift up the heavenly conscience and lay down the human heart, not allowing the mind to doubt or mix intention. Only then is there true heart, true intention, true feeling, without the slightest falsehood—this is the true dao. The true dao pervades all things; therefore it is called Complete Reality.”

Having finished explaining the principle of Complete Reality to Wang, Patriarch Lü then taught him how to refine himself and build his foundation, how to set the furnace and establish the cauldron, how to gather herbs and return the elixir, the timing of the fire, and all the steps of the功. Wang bowed again to receive the teaching. Patriarch Lü further said, “After you attain the dao, quickly go to Shandong to save the Seven True Ones. The Seven True Ones are the masters of the seven golden lotuses I spoke of before.” Having given these instructions, Patriarch Lü and Patriarch Zhongli leapt up, their bodies shining with golden light, vanishing in an instant. Wang looked up to the empty sky and bowed in thanks. After bowing, he still gazed at the sky, silently recalling the immortal faces.

Just then, Wang Mao and Jade Maid came forward, saying, “By Lady Zhou’s order, we came to find our master. Suspecting he was here, now that we have found him, we ask him to return home so as not to cause further worry.” Wang then slowly walked back, silently memorizing the dao Patriarch Lü had transmitted. Returning home, he did not enter the inner chambers but went straight to the study to sit. Lady Zhou, hearing that her husband had returned, came to inquire. Seeing Wang silent and thoughtful, she urged him, “My lord, you often go out lightly, making me worry. I fear your conduct will bring shame and ridicule upon the village. You have repeatedly ignored my advice. What is to be done?” Wang was deep in contemplation of the profound功 and did not even notice Lady Zhou entering or what she said. Only at the end, when Lady Zhou said, “What is to be done?” did he come back to himself and replied casually, “How to be done, how not to be done?” Lady Zhou, hearing his words which made no sense, said no more and withdrew.

Wang thought to himself, if I let such disturbances continue, how can I succeed and realize the dao? Unless I devise a method to sever worldly ties, I will never be free. Bowing his head in thought, he found a way: unless he feigned a stroke and silence, he could not cut off these entanglements. Having decided, he acted the part of a fool, feigning stupor and silence. When people came, he groaned and moaned, refusing to return to the inner chambers, lying instead on the cool bed in the study. Lady Zhou, seeing this, was deeply worried, coming several times a day to ask. She saw him muttering incoherently, speaking unclearly, moaning and calling out, shaking his head without end.

Lady Zhou was at a loss and sent Jade Maid to invite several of Wang’s usual friends to come and chat, to see what was wrong. These friends were all those Wang respected and loved; upon invitation, they came immediately and entered the study together. In unison they asked, “Lord Filial Official, how do you fare?” Wang shook his head a few times, waved his hands a few times, babbled incoherently, and sighed. The friends saw he could not speak and only moaned. “He seems ill but we do not know what disease,” said one elder. “I observe he looks like he has a stroke causing silence. I know a doctor named Zhang Haiqing at the east end of the village. Let us send for him to examine the pulse and see.” Lady Zhou, hearing this outside the door, ordered Jade Maid to fetch the doctor. Soon the doctor arrived. The friends all stood to let him enter and sit. They explained Wang’s condition. Zhang Haiqing examined Wang’s pulse with both hands. After checking, he found no sign of illness in the pulse but, following the crowd’s story, said, “Indeed, it seems a stroke causing silence. Just take several doses of medicine and he will surely recover.” Saying this, he wrote a prescription for several herbs. Whether the medicine cured him or not, we shall hear in the next chapter.

Because martial cultivation is originally no illness,  
It is not that the doctor failed to understand.
