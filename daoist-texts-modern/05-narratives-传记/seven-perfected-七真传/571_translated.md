# Chapter Three: Receiving Heaven’s Edict to Cross Shandong and Save the World — Entering the Earth Path to Hide in Zhongnan

The ways of the world are scorching and cold beyond compare,  
In the red dust, men vie for fame and seize after profit.  
All beings desire to be saved, yet none save others;  
They wish to deliver all beings, but fail to deliver a single soul.

It is said that Wang Xiaolian was originally a man without illness,  
Yet he feigned sickness to cut off entanglements,  
Hoping to awaken to profound功.  
How Master Zhang Haiqing discerned his deep heart,  
He examined left and right, but could find no ailment,  
So he went along with the common talk and said,  
“Truly, this is a stroke that renders one speechless.”  
He then took paper and brush and wrote a prescription:  
Three qian of Sichuan lovage and half liang of Siler root.  
When finished, he chatted a little with the crowd,  
Drank a cup of fragrant tea, collected his fee, and departed.  
After the master left, friends said to Wang Wuju,  
“Sir Xiaolian, take care; we shall return another day to see you.”  
Wang Wuju nodded his head once, and the friends each went their way.

After the guests left, Lady Zhou called her son Qiulang and Jade Boy  
To the western village’s apothecary to fetch the medicine.  
They brewed it in a jar and poured it into a bowl,  
Then Qiulang carried it with both hands into the study.  
Just as he called, “Father, take your medicine!”  
The father’s eyes snapped wide open, and he stamped his foot fiercely—  
Frightening Qiulang so much he hurriedly set down the bowl and ran outside,  
Refusing to come again even when called twice.  
After Qiulang left, Wang Xiaolian secretly poured out the medicine in a quiet spot.  
From then on, only Jade Boy came and went,  
Serving tea and water, while the maids dared not approach his door.  
If he saw them, he would beat his chest and stamp his feet,  
So none dared come near.  
Only Lady Zhou, mindful of their marital bond, came in to see him,  
But even then, he was unwilling.  
Since his feigned stroke, all household affairs were managed by Lady Zhou alone,  
Who often came to ask after him.  
Relatives and friends came twice to visit,  
Saw his state, and never came again.  
Thus all said, “What a pity for Wang Wuju to have fallen ill with such a bad sickness.”  
That single phrase left him abandoned in solitude,  
Quiet and alone in his study, cultivating the dao and refining the true,  
Practicing meditation thus for twelve years, until the Great Elixir was perfected.

A wife to serve, a son to keep company,  
Thirst quenched with tea, hunger fed with meals—  
To all appearances, he was like any other man,  
Who would know he was busy with the dao?

After twelve years,功 was complete,  
His yang spirit rose to the crown of his head and appeared.  
How many practitioners in the world,  
Who could bear to do the same?

Now Wang Wuju had cultivated the Great Dao at home,  
Able to send forth his yang spirit and transform his form,  
He took a dao name for himself: Tian “Chongyang.”  
One night, while meditating in his study,  
In a moment when not a single thought arose and all was utterly silent,  
Suddenly he heard a voice in the void calling out:  
“Wang Chongyang, swiftly ascend the clouds to receive the edict!”  
The voice pierced his ears.  
Chongyang hurriedly soared into the empty sky,  
Saw the Great White Metal Star standing on the clouds,  
Who spoke, “The Jade Edict descends.”  
Wang Chongyang knelt and listened as it was read aloud:

“Remember, Chongyang, you have labored in cultivation for twelve years without fault.  
By decree, your dao fruit is complete.  
You are hereby specially appointed as the Enlightened Perfected One.  
Hasten to Shandong to save the world,  
Promptly raise the Seven Perfected Ones.  
After功 is complete, further honors shall be bestowed as you desire.”

When the Great White Metal Star finished reading the edict,  
Chongyang bowed again to thank the favor,  
Then paid respects to the Star Lord.  
The Star Lord said, “Perfected One, hasten to Shandong to save the world.  
Fear not toil or hardship, lest you fail the Emperor’s will.  
One day we shall meet again at the Peach Banquet to converse anew.”  
With that, the Star Lord returned to the Heavenly Palace,  
And Chongyang returned to his study to meditate.

That morning, Jade Boy came to bring water for washing,  
But the door would not open.  
He hurried to tell Lady Wang.  
Lady Zhou and two maidservants came to the study door,  
Calling loudly, but the door remained shut.  
They feared Xiaolian was surely dead,  
So they forced the door open and entered the study.  
No one was to be found.  
Lady Zhou was shocked and alarmed,  
Ordering a search in all directions, but no trace was found.  
She wept bitterly, rousing the villagers to come inquire.  
Jade Boy told the story to the villagers,  
Who all said, “This is strange indeed.  
The door was bolted, yet no one is here.  
Could he have ascended the roof or passed through walls?”  
They entered and inspected,  
No brick or tile disturbed.  
They split up to search, but found no whereabouts.  
One knowledgeable man said, “No need to search.  
I believe Wang Xiaolian has surely become a神仙.”  
The villagers asked, “How do you see that he became an immortal?”  
He said, “He sat in this study for twelve years without moving a step,  
Feigning a stroke but truly transcending dust.  
I once saw his face radiant red,  
His eyes shooting numinous light—  
If not an immortal, how could this be?”  
The crowd half believed, half doubted,  
And all said in unison, “Then he must have become a仙, riding clouds to Heaven.”  
Lady Zhou heard this and her sorrow lessened,  
And the people dispersed.

Now it is told that on that day, Wang Chongyang used earth escape from the study,  
Leaving Great Wei Village, heading toward Shandong,  
Traveling thousands of li,  
Yet found no Seven Perfected Ones, only two people.  
Who were those two?  
One was the person called “Name,” the other “Profit.”  
No others were to be found.  
Seeing no one to save, Wang Chongyang returned to Shaanxi.  
On reaching beneath Zhongnan, he saw a stretch of earthen hills a hundred li long,  
Quiet and lovely.  
He thought to use the earth method to vanish,  
To enter deep into the earth, hide and lie in wait,  
Until practitioners appeared in the world,  
Then emerge to save them—not too late.  
Thus he formed hand seals and recited incantations,  
And vanished into the earth.  
After about half an hour, he reached a very deep place,  
Found a cavern large enough to dwell in, and entered.  
He padded his form, breathed in regulation,  
To preserve his life essence.

The great cosmos holds but two—one named, one profit turning the wheel.  
The Seven Perfected Ones unknown where to save,  
In earth’s womb he lies in wait for later cause.

Meanwhile, Wang Chongyang lay concealed in the earth, unaware of daylight,  
For nearly half a year.  
Suddenly he heard a rumbling like Heaven collapsing and Earth splitting,  
The earth cavern cracked open a fissure letting in light,  
Above shimmered golden radiance—  
His master had arrived!  
Wang Chongyang was greatly startled,  
Hurriedly leapt to the earth’s crack,  
And saw the two immortals Zhong and Lü,  
Together born of the earth platform.  
Wang Chongyang bowed low, not daring to look up.  
Lüzu smiled and said,  
“Others cultivate the dao to ascend Heaven,  
But you cultivate the dao to enter the underworld.  
It seems your功 is unlike others,  
Opposing Heaven’s will above, defying the master’s intent below—  
Is this how an immortal is made?”  
Chongyang kowtowed and apologized,  
“Sire, I dare not defy Heaven’s will or the master’s teaching.  
Truly, Shandong has no one to save,  
So I temporarily hide, waiting for practitioners to arise in the world,  
Then I shall go to save them, not too late.”  
Lüzu said, “Practitioners are everywhere,  
Only you have not earnestly sought them, so none appear.  
For example, when you first began, you had no heart to learn the dao.  
If the Patriarch had not repeatedly enlightened you,  
You would have been only a filial official all your life.  
How could you become a Great Golden Immortal?  
Now you seek safety and do not advance diligently,  
Yet say there is no one in the world—how absurd!  
If you use the method I taught you to save yourself,  
You can then save others, and no one will be beyond saving.  
Once I was drunk thrice in Yueyang, and thought no one was to be saved,  
Lightly flying over Dongting Lake.  
Returning north to Liaoyang, I saw the prime minister of the Jin Kingdom with a spirit to save,  
So I personally instructed him.  
He laid down his seal and returned to the mountain,  
Cultivated the Great Dao, and took the name Sea Toad.  
Liu Haichan followed me south,  
He saved Zhang Ziyang,  
Zhang Ziyang saved Shi Xinglin,  
Shi Xinglin saved Xue Daoguang,  
Xue Daoguang saved Chen Zhixu,  
Chen Zhixu saved Bai Ziqing,  
Bai Ziqing saved Liu Yongnian and Peng Helin—  
These seven all attained fruition, known as the Southern Seven Perfected Ones.  
At the time I thought no one could be saved,  
Yet he saved many more.  
The world is vast, the four seas wide,  
Profound principles endless,  
True persons are not few—how could there be none to save?  
Now there are the Northern Seven Perfected Ones—Qiu, Liu, Tan, Ma, Hao, Wang, Sun—  
Who repeatedly urge you to go save others.  
Is it that your power cannot match Haichan’s?  
No, it is because your heart fears hardship that you fall short.”

When Lüzu finished speaking,  
Chongyang’s mind was suddenly enlightened,  
He trembled with fear and apologized, sweat streaming down his spine.  
Zhongli Laozu called him to rise and stand aside,  
Saying, “Not that your master has not urged you repeatedly,  
But because the Peach Banquet is near,  
An edict calls all practitioners who have attained true immortality  
To attend this gathering.  
The peach on Kunlun blooms once in a thousand years,  
Fruits once in a thousand years,  
Ripens once in a thousand years—  
Three thousand years in all to reach perfection.  
The peach is as large as a bushel, red as blazing fire,  
Eating one grants life for a thousand years.  
The Queen Mother of the West cannot bear to keep it alone,  
And wishes to share it with all immortals, Buddhas, and divine sages.  
Thus she holds a meeting called the “Assembly of All Immortals.”  
Each meeting welcomes some newly perfected immortals,  
To add brilliance to the gathering.  
If only old immortals attend,  
And none newly cultivated,  
The Queen Mother is displeased.  
In ancient times, each meeting brought over a thousand new perfected immortals,  
In middle ages, several hundred.  
Now in this later world, few remain,  
So you are charged to hasten to save the Seven Perfected Ones,  
And attend the Peach Banquet,  
To add your might and radiance.  
The peaches are about to ripen.  
If you delay and miss this chance,  
You must wait another three thousand years to attend—  
Is that not a pity?”

These words were clear and thorough.  
Wang Chongyang knelt again and said,  
“Now I hear the master’s words as if waking from a dream.  
I wish to return to Shandong to save souls.  
Please instruct me on the path ahead.”  
Zhongli Laozu said,  
“The land is dense with people.  
You must mingle among them,  
Appear in the dust,  
Speak and act,  
And those who seek you will come.  
You may stay where you meet Hai,  
Prosper where you meet Ma,  
Stop where you meet Qiu.”  
When Zhongli Laozu finished, he and Lüzu rode clouds away.  
Wang Chongyang returned toward Shandong.  
One day he came to a county called Ninghai,  
Under the jurisdiction of Dengzhou Prefecture in Shandong.  
Recalling the master’s words, “Stay where you meet Hai,”  
Surely this was the place?  
He stayed there, carrying an iron pot,  
Feigning a mendicant to save others,  
Just as Lüzu had once saved him.  
Whether he succeeded in saving others—  
That will be told in the next chapter.

Mingling in dust, awaiting the appointed time,  
When the time comes, the dao fruit will naturally ripen.
