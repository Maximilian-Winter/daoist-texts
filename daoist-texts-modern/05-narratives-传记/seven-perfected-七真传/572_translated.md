# Chapter Four: On True Emptiness—The Sun Family’s Instruction to the Husband; Seeking the Great Dao—Ma Yu’s Quest for a Wise Master

Heaven is empty, Earth is empty,  
Life drifts faintly within their midst.  

The sun is empty, the moon is empty,  
Rising in the east, setting in the west—whose work is this?  

Fields are empty, lands are empty,  
How many masters have they changed hands?  

Gold is empty, silver is empty,  
After death, when have they ever stayed in one’s grasp?  

Wife is empty, child is empty,  
On the road to the Yellow Springs, they do not meet again.  

Morning goes west, evening goes east,  
Life is like a bee gathering flowers.  

Gathering a hundred blooms into honey,  
In the end, all the toil is empty.

It is said that Wang Chongyang came to Ninghai County in Dengzhou Prefecture, Shandong. Under the pretense of begging for alms, he truly sought to visit those who cultivated the Way. But that is another tale. Now, it is said that northwest of Ninghai lies a village called Ma’s Manor, where dwells a man named Ma Yuanwai, his given name Yu—just a single character. His parents passed away early; having neither brothers nor siblings, he alone took a wife from the Sun family, named Yuanzhen.  

Sun Yuanzhen was of dignified appearance and serene temperament. She could read and contemplate books, tracing antiquity and probing the present. She cared not for sewing needles or embroidery, nor for picking flowers or stitching blossoms. Though a woman by birth, she possessed a manly spirit. Whenever Ma Yuanwai faced matters he could not decide, he would consult her; with but a word or two from Sun Yuanzhen, all doubts vanished instantly. Thus, the couple treated each other with the respect of guests, their affection like that of teacher and friend. Yet beneath their knees, no sons or daughters were born; they were already approaching middle age.

Swiftly the light of time cannot be held,  
Year by year, one only sees the water flowing east.  

Do not believe? Try to look into the blue caltrop’s reflection—  
Once rosy cheeks, now white hair.  

These few lines of verse speak of time’s arrow urging one to age, the sun and moon like a shuttle weaving youth away. The Ma couple, seeing themselves near forty with no offspring, one day Ma Yuanwai said to Sun Yuanzhen, “You and I are not far from forty years, yet beneath our knees there is no heir. This fortune of ten thousand strings of cash—who knows into whose hands it will fall?”  

Sun Yuanzhen replied, “The Three Sovereigns ruled the world long ago, the Five Emperors achieved great deeds; Yao and Shun bowed to each other in humility, Yu dredged the nine rivers to flow; Cheng Tang employed Yi Yin, King Wen sought the Grand Duke; the Five Hegemons displayed their strategies, the Seven Heroes wielded their hearts; Ying conquered the Six States, Chu and Han contended for supremacy; Wu and Wei served the Han throne; Liu Bei sought the Sleeping Dragon; the Eastern and Western Jin, their enterprises vanished without trace; the Southern and Northern Wei, the realm was shrouded in mist; Tang and Song reached to today, many wealthy lords—ask now, where are those people? All is but emptiness. From ancient times to now, tens of thousands of years, emperors and generals numbering in the thousands, in the end, all is empty, fleeting shadows. You and I, husband and wife, cast all past and future into emptiness, as if the world never had us, as if our parents never bore us.”  

Ma Yu laughed and said, “Though others are empty, they still have descendants. We, in this emptiness, even the root is severed.”  

Sun Yuanzhen said, “When emptiness reaches rootlessness, that is the Great Emptiness.”  

---

When emptiness reaches its utmost, it is the Great Emptiness—  
No now, no past, like the primal chaos.  

If one can recognize the principle of Great Emptiness,  
Truly one will reach the numinous mountain and behold the Great Hero.  

Sun Yuanzhen continued, “If we speak of having children or not, having children is empty, not having children is empty. In the past, King Wen was said to have a hundred sons—how many today bear the Ji surname? Who are his descendants for ten thousand generations? How many tend his ancestral tomb? It is said Zhang Gongyi had nine sons, two passed away; Guo Ziyi had seven sons and eight sons-in-law; Baoyan Mountain’s five laurels bloom in fragrance; Liu Yuanpu’s two honored ones vie in beauty—these are all flourishing lineages, yet now how many sons and grandsons remain? Still desolate winds and cold rain, abandoned platforms and ancient graves, sorrow clouds the sky, weeds cover the ground. Is this not proof that having or not having all returns to emptiness?  

Lonely graves and walls—are they all childless?  
Prosperous cities—do they surely have descendants?  

I think life in this world, these few decades, pass in but a moment, like a flash of stone fire or lightning, arising and vanishing; like dreams, illusions, bubbles, and shadows—neither real nor true. A mansion of a thousand rooms is but a seven-foot bed for the night; ten thousand acres of good fields are but for three meals a day. Though there are many delicious delicacies, countless silks and brocades, in a blink impermanence arrives: in an instant all things cease, leaving behind much glory and splendor, yet none to enjoy it; countless gold and silver cannot buy life or death—vainly one becomes a changed person.”  

---

Managing worldly affairs, day by day busy,  
From ancient to now, all is not truly here.  

Mistakenly thinking the lost path is home,  
Only borrowing mirrors to confuse the passing time.  

Sun Yuanzhen said again to Ma Yuanwai, “Within emptiness, where nothing is empty, let us seek something real and truly real, to accomplish a work neither born nor perishing, to learn a method of long life and deathlessness.”  

Ma Yuanwai said, “My lady, you speak wildly. Since ancient times, where there is birth there must be death; how can there be a principle of long life and deathlessness? From beginning comes end—how can there be a matter without cessation?”  

Sun Yuanzhen said, “I have read Daoist books that say: refine essence to transform into qi, refine qi to transform into spirit, refine spirit to return to emptiness—thus the true nature remains forever, the numinous light never extinguished. This is the way of long life. If one learns this dao, one is a hundred times stronger than those with children!”  

Ma Yuanwai said, “Though you say so, how can essence be transformed into qi? How can qi be transformed into spirit? How can spirit return to emptiness? How can the true nature remain forever? How can the numinous light never be extinguished?”  

Sun Yuanzhen said, “You must pay respects to a master to obtain this wondrous principle.”  

Ma Yu said, “Then I shall take you as my master; you may transmit your practice to me.”  

Yuanzhen said, “I am but a woman, knowing only a few characters, having read a few books—how could I understand such wondrous principles? If you truly wish to learn the dao, you cannot do without visiting a wise master.”  

Ma Yuanwai said, “Visiting masters and friends is my lifelong delight, but those who cultivate the dao must have a root foundation. Without root foundation, one cannot become immortal, cannot become Buddha. So I reckon my root foundation is shallow; I will no longer speak of cultivation.”  

Sun Yuanzhen said, “Husband, your words are mistaken. All those who transform in the world have root foundations. Without root foundation, how could one transform? Only the depth varies. Those with shallow roots have incomplete six senses—eyes lose brightness, ears lose sharpness, hands crippled, feet lame, foolish, deaf, mute, widowed, orphaned, poor, lowly—these are shallow roots. Those with deep roots may be emperors, wealthy over the four seas; or high ministers governing thousands; or officials renowned and illustrious; or families rich and enjoying fields; six senses complete, ears sharp, eyes bright, heart kind, spirit peaceful—these are deep roots. The world values wealth and rank; those wealthy have especially deep roots. If they do deeds to aid people, their roots grow even greater. Becoming immortal, Buddha, or sage is all possible. Therefore, root foundation must be supplemented at all times; it is not fixed from past lives. If it were from past lives, why worry about carrying it to the next? Like a mountain, the more you pile, the bigger and higher it grows. Do not say we have no root foundation; without it, how could we enjoy this great estate, command servants and slaves, call and have a hundred obey? In this light, we are indeed people of great root foundation.”  

Ma Yuanwai was fond of the dao but had been confused. Hearing Sun Yuanzhen’s clear and distinct reasoning, he suddenly awakened.  

He rose and thanked her, saying, “Many thanks, my lady, for opening my blocked mind. But I do not know where to find this master?”  

Sun Yuanzhen said, “That is not difficult. I once saw an old man, leaning on a bamboo staff, carrying an iron pot, spirit clear and bright, eyes piercing, face flushed with red light. He has been begging for alms here for several years, his appearance growing younger, showing no sign of aging. I believe this man surely has the dao. When he comes, we shall welcome him into our home, offer him hospitality, and slowly beseech the wondrous principles.”  

Ma Yuanwai said, “In our great estate, we should do some acts of respect for the aged and pity for the poor. Whether he has the dao or not, we shall receive him and support him all his life. He cannot eat much, nor wear much. I will visit him tomorrow—how does that sound?”  

Sun Yuanzhen said, “The sooner one cultivates the dao, the sooner one is liberated. Do not delay.”

Leaving the words of Ma Yuanwai and his wife, it is said Wang Chongyang stayed in Ninghai County for several years. By this time, he had refined his profound skill to subtle depths and lively places, able to know past and future matters, the secrets of ghosts and gods, possessing full spiritual powers and perfect wisdom. He knew how to guide the Seven True Ones, beginning with Ma Yuanwai and his wife. This perfectly matched the saying of Patriarch Zhongli: “Meeting the horse, one’s fortune arises.” Thus, he came and went, always wandering near Ma’s Manor for several years, having met Ma Yuanwai several times and knowing his great virtue; having met Sun Yuanzhen twice, seeing her great wisdom, wishing to enlighten the two of them. Yet he said, “The Way is not lightly passed on; one does not knock on the door of a doctor, nor lightly teach the Way. One must bow low and seek with sincere heart; it cannot be spoken otherwise.” Because he begged for alms here for many years, all recognized him as a lonely old poor man from afar, seeking food. Who knew he was a god-immortal? Who recognized him as a true person? Only this one Sun Yuanzhen, a wondrous woman of the world, a peerless extraordinary person, born with eyes that see good men, recognized that poor lonely old man as a true immortal. She told her husband to receive him into their home, support him, and seek the Way. Thus the Seven True Ones gradually advanced. Among the cultivation achievements of the Seven True Ones, Sun Yuanzhen ranks first.

Wisdom’s origin is truly extraordinary,  
Not merely Yuanzhen’s sharp eyesight.  

Recognizing the immortal’s arrival in the north,  
The Seven True sect’s fame will endure.  

It is said Ma Yuanwai, hearing his wife Sun Yuanzhen’s words, went outside and told the gatekeeper, “If you see that old man carrying the iron pot, quickly inform me.” The gatekeeper readily agreed.  

One day, Ma Yuanwai was sitting in the hall when the gatekeeper came to report, “The old man with the iron pot has arrived.” Hearing this, Ma Yuanwai went out to welcome him. This was the arrival of the old master Wang Chongyang’s dao fortune, exactly fulfilling Patriarch Zhongli’s words: “Someone will come seeking you.” But how Ma Yuanwai came to receive the master—this is yet to be told. Let us see in the next chapter.

Even immortals must wait for their time;  
Without the tide of fortune, the dao does not proceed.
