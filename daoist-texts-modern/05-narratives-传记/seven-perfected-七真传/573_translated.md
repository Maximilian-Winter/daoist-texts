# Chapter Five: Master Ma Diligently Serves the Teacher with Reverence — Wang Chongyang Manages Wealth Through Mutual Dao

Once again, it is told that Master Ma, the Gentleman of the Outer Court, upon hearing that the old man who carried the iron pot had arrived, hurried outside to receive him, respectfully inviting the elder into his home. The old man followed him into the main hall and, without ceremony, seated himself boldly upon a chair, his bearing lofty and proud. With a commanding voice he asked, “You have called me in—what is it you wish to say?”

Master Ma replied, “I see that you, venerable sir, are of great age and spend your days begging, which is most exhausting. Why not stay in my home? I am willing to support you with care. What say you to this?”

Before he could finish, the old man’s face suddenly darkened, and he said sharply, “I am accustomed to begging; I do not eat your nameless food.” Seeing the elder’s change of countenance, Master Ma dared not press further. He withdrew inside and spoke to Sun Yuanzhen, “That old man who carries the iron pot is now in my home. I offered to support him, but he said he would not eat my nameless food. Clearly, he does not intend to stay. I have come to ask you how to arrange things.”

Sun Yuanzhen laughed and said, “Have you not heard that the gentleman seeks the dao, not food, while the petty man seeks food, not the dao? You met him and immediately promised support—that is to lure him with food and drink. How can a gentleman entice in such a way? Your words were misplaced and failed to strike a chord. Leave it to me; with just a few words, I will surely have the old man settle in peacefully.”

It was not that the teacher was unwilling to stay, but that their words had not yet found harmony.

Yuanzhen then went forth with tactful skill, certain to win the elder’s consent.

Now Sun Yuanzhen approached the hall and, upon seeing the old man, bowed and offered a myriad blessings. The elder smiled and said, “I am but a beggar; what blessings do I deserve?” Yuanzhen replied, “You, venerable sir, are unburdened and free, roaming at ease— is that not a blessing? Without worry or sorrow, serene and effortless— is that not a blessing? In this dusty world, many wealthy families and men of fame and profit labor their minds daily, laden with worry and care. Though they have wife’s favor and children’s love without end, they cannot truly enjoy their blessings; they possess only empty fame. How unlike you, who enjoy true blessing!”

Hearing this, the old man laughed heartily, “Since you know that roaming freely is blessing, and quiet non-action is blessing, why do you not learn to roam freely? Why do you not learn quiet non-action?”

Yuanzhen said, “It is not that I do not wish to learn, but I have not found the method. I desire to roam freely, yet cannot; I desire quietude, yet cannot attain it.”

The old man said, “If you are willing to learn, I would not hesitate to teach you.”

Yuanzhen said, “Since you, venerable sir, are willing to teach, there is a pavilion in our rear garden called the Moon-Inviting Pavilion, very quiet and serene. Please, come stay there, and we may learn together.”

The elder nodded in agreement.

Their words struck a chord, bridging ancient and modern. Today the teacher met a kindred spirit.

A knowing friend speaks to a knowing friend; their hearts are one.

The old man, pleased by Yuanzhen’s words, nodded assent. Master Ma immediately ordered his servant Ma Xing to tidy the Moon-Inviting Pavilion in the rear garden, arranging beds, quilts, tables, chairs, and stools—all in readiness. Then he invited the elder inside to settle. He assigned a young houseboy named Zhenwa to pour tea, serve water, and bring meals morning and evening.

Master Ma then said to Sun Yuanzhen, “We have spoken with the old man for half a day, yet do not know his name. I will go ask.”

Madam Sun said, “Great kindness needs no thanks; great virtue needs no name. It suffices to meet with proper respect. Why must you know his name? Simply call him ‘Old Teacher’—that is the common address.”

Master Ma was unconvinced and insisted on asking. Yuanzhen tried to stop him but could not. So Master Ma went to the Moon-Inviting Pavilion, where he found the elder seated in meditation on a couch. Approaching, he said, “May I ask your honorable surname and given name? Where do you reside? What brings you here?”

After several questions, the elder opened his eyes wide and answered loudly, “My name is Wang Chongyang. I come from Shaanxi. I do not mind the thousand-mile journey; I have come here for you.”

Master Ma was startled and said, “Old Teacher, you have come here on my behalf?”

Wang Chongyang clapped his hands and laughed heartily, “Indeed, I have come for you.”

Master Ma asked again, “Why have you come for me, Old Teacher? What is the reason?”

Wang Chongyang said, “I have come for your vast wealth.”

Hearing this, Master Ma both laughed and grew angry, pursing his lips and retorting, “You have come for my vast wealth? Do you truly desire it?”

Wang Chongyang replied, “If I did not desire it, I would not have come.”

These words angered Master Ma so deeply that his face turned ashen, and he hurried away.

The teacher’s words startled all: plainly asking for wealth and property.

Such a thing is unheard of in the world; the principle behind it is hard to grasp.

Master Ma left the Moon-Inviting Pavilion and walked to a quiet corner, muttering to himself, “This old fellow is utterly shameless, always thinking of others’ wealth. To speak so openly—he is worse than a child. What virtue does he have?”

Returning to the main room, he sat silently. Sun Yuanzhen saw his troubled face and guessed he had been vexed by the old man’s words. She smiled and said, “I told you not to ask, but you would not believe me and insisted on asking. It was your improper questioning that caused the old teacher to clash with you. You must broaden your mind and not act like a petty man.”

Hearing this, Master Ma’s expression softened somewhat. He said to Yuanzhen, “I thought the old man was a man of virtue, but who knew he was a money-grubber?”

Yuanzhen asked, “How do you know he is greedy?”

Master Ma recounted Wang Chongyang’s demand for the family wealth. Yuanzhen listened and then said, “Old Teacher Wang must have his reasons for wanting your wealth. Have you not asked clearly? There is a saying: ‘A thousand years’ land has eight hundred masters.’ This wealth is the most impartial thing under Heaven, only temporarily entrusted to people. Those who know how to use it enjoy it for decades or generations; those who do not, it scatters like rain-dashed flowers or wind-scattered clouds. It passes from hand to hand, poor to rich, rich to poor. There is no owner for a hundred generations, no hoarder for a thousand years.”

Vast wealth is nothing to boast of; who can guard it forever without loss?

Wealth is the world’s most impartial thing; how can one keep it for a thousand years?

Sun Yuanzhen then advised her husband Ma Yu, “Old Teacher Wang must have a reason for wanting your wealth. If his explanation is reasonable, there is no harm in giving it to him. Besides, we have no children; this wealth will eventually fall to others.”

Before she finished, Master Ma laughed, “Madam speaks so easily, but our ancestors moved from Shaanxi to Shandong, enduring countless hardships to earn this family fortune. Though I am not talented, I dare not give away the hard-earned sweat and blood of my forebears. Moreover, we are but halfway through life. If we give away our wealth, how shall we live? What shall we eat or wear? Would that not ruin everything?”

Sun Yuanzhen said, “You are a man, yet so lacking in insight. We give our wealth to seek the dao of longevity. Once we have the dao, and become immortals, what need is there for wealth? One son becomes immortal, and nine ancestors ascend. How can that fail to repay the ancestors? It seems that the single word ‘dao’ is worth far more than your vast fortune.”

Gold, silver, and treasures are like the sands of the Ganges; wealth, though great, will eventually be spent.

Not worth comparing to the value of dao merit, which endures forever without decay.

Master Ma heard Sun Yuanzhen’s words and said, “Your words are not without merit. But if I fail to become immortal, would it not be like painting a tiger that turns out a dog?”

Sun Yuanzhen said, “One must have perseverance. Without perseverance, one cannot be a healer or shaman, much less learn to be an immortal. Where there is will, there is accomplishment; where there is no will, there is no success. It depends on constancy and resolve. It is said that immortals were once ordinary people; the only fear is that ordinary people’s hearts are not focused. If you concentrate your heart and mind, naturally your wishes will be fulfilled. Every immortal and Buddha of past ages was once a mortal who cultivated until completion. Were they born immortal?”

Master Ma nodded in approval.

The next day, he came to the Moon-Inviting Pavilion and said to Wang Chongyang, “Old Teacher, yesterday you said you wanted my family fortune, but I do not know for what purpose you desire this wealth.”

Wang Chongyang spoke solemnly, “My intention is to gather all the world’s cultivators and seekers of the dao here, to practice and carry out the dao. I will use your wealth to nourish their nature and protect their dao, so that externally they have no burdens, and internally they have sustenance. When they come, they will be peaceful and joyful; while here, they will be happy and content.”

Hearing this true purpose, Master Ma’s heart was finally at ease, though he still hesitated whether to part with his wealth. Let us await the next chapter to see how this unfolds.

Only those who can give up self for others may be called transcendent great sages.
