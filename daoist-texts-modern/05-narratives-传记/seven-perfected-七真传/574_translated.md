# Chapter Six: Sun Yuanzhen Urges Her Husband to Surrender Family Wealth; Ma Wenkui Accepts Bribes and Adapts with Expediency

It is said that Master Chongyang explained to Ma Yu the matter of “borrowing wealth to protect the Dao and gathering practitioners” with great clarity. Ma Yu, the wealthy gentleman, was pleased and said to the master, “Sir, as you speak, you are truly a person of great virtue. My wife, Lady Sun, and I both wish to take you as our teacher. May I ask your thoughts on this?” Chongyang replied, “So long as you and your wife sincerely cultivate the dao, I have no objection. But you must first surrender your family wealth; only then can I transmit to you the supreme dao. This will allow you to focus wholeheartedly, free from constant attachments and distractions.” Ma Yu said, “If you need silver coins, feel free to take them. I am not stingy; why must I surrender everything?” Wang Chongyang said, “If you do not surrender, it remains yours, and I cannot act freely or at ease.” Ma Yu said, “The fields lie outside, the silver coins within. I will bring the contracts and account books and hand them over to you—that will be the surrender.” Master Chongyang said, “Keep the contracts with you for now; just ask the clan elders to witness. Draft a paper of surrender, and that will serve as proof.” Ma Yu’s joy turned to worry.

After bidding farewell to the master, he returned to the main chamber and told Sun Yuanzhen what Chongyang had said. He added, “In my view, this matter is not proper.” Yuanzhen said, “How do you see it as improper?” Ma Yu replied, “Do you not know the hearts of our clan members?” Yuanzhen said, “Each person has their own heart; how can they all be the same?” Ma Yu said, “In our clan, seeing that we have no heirs, one after another they covet dividing the estate. They wait for the day we both die so that the family wealth and fields will belong to them. How could they allow me to surrender the family wealth to an outsider? That is why I say it is improper.” Sun Yuanzhen said, “This is not difficult. Tomorrow, invite several capable clan elders to discuss. If they agree, so be it. If they refuse, you can do such and such; they will surely comply, and I guarantee this matter will succeed.” Ma Yu laughed and said, “Lady, you truly have talent. This matter will likely be accomplished.” He immediately sent Ma Xing to invite the clan elders, arranging for them to gather before noon the next day. As Ma Xing went to invite the elders, there is no need to mention further.

The next day, the clan elders arrived, followed by some brothers of the same generation and younger nephews, all expecting a feast with tables and drinks. These people entered the hall and sat according to rank and generation. The eldest among the peers was named Ma Long, a tribute student. At once, Ma Long asked Ma Yu, “You have invited us here today; what is it you wish to say?” Ma Yu said, “My grandson has been ill in recent years, often coughing and wheezing, rarely well for two days in three. One person cannot manage the affairs of a hundred. Moreover, your grandson’s wife often harms the old man’s health, making it difficult to manage matters. Now, a certain Master Wang from Shaanxi has come—a loyal and honest man I have kept at home. I intend to entrust him with managing the family estate. My wife and I will live a quiet life. If he agrees, that is well and good. I ask you elders to issue a surrender paper to him. This is why I have called you respected elders to discuss and issue a surrender to him.” No sooner had Ma Yu finished speaking than a cousin named Ma Ming became angry. Ma Ming stood up and pointed at Ma Yu, saying, “Have you lost your wits? Are you foolish? What nonsense is this? The ancestral foundation and estate must be preserved. How can you surrender it to another? Who has deceived you into such a trap, speaking such unseemly words?” Ma Yu knew his reasoning was weak and, seeing Ma Ming’s anger, dared not speak further.

There was an uncle, Ma Wenkui, a scholar, and another cousin, Ma Zhao, a student at the Imperial Academy. These two gentlemen were outstanding talents in the Ma clan. All major and minor affairs depended on these two for settlement; whether something was permitted or forbidden hinged on their single word. Ma Wenkui was a man of expediency. Seeing Ma Ming rebuke Ma Yu, he casually said, “Do not blame him. This gentleman is honest; blaming him is useless. Go call out that Master Wang here. Let me ask him a question and see what his true purpose is.” Having said this, he sent Ma Xing to summon the master. Soon Ma Xing returned and brought the old master before the hall. The master did not greet others, and others paid him no mind. Ma Ming laughed upon seeing him and said, “I thought this was some great Master Wang, but it turns out he is just a beggarly old man.” Ma Wenkui said to Master Chongyang, “You old man have begged in our region for years. I have heard no news of your abilities. I do not know what aspect of our gentleman’s family you have caught onto that he has taken you in, fed and clothed you sufficiently. You should live quietly and properly in your remaining years. Why deceive my nephew into surrendering his family wealth to you? You are fifty or sixty years old; surely you understand reason. How can you speak such words without shame? Are you not afraid of being ridiculed?”

Master Chongyang replied, “In my life, I have no great talents. I am only afraid of poverty. That is why I told him to surrender the family wealth to me, so I might live a few happy years. Whether they ridicule me or not is of no concern.” Before he finished, Ma Futian and Ma Gui jumped forward and spat several times in the master’s face, saying, “You shameless old man! A crooked mouth wanting to wear the phoenix crown, a weasel wishing to eat swan meat! You have lived these many decades and speak such shameless words. It is infuriating.” Ma Fu said to Ma Gui, “Let us not quarrel. Simply drive him out of the manor; that is the best plan.” Saying this, they tried to seize him, but Ma Zhao stepped forward to block them, saying, “No need to drive him away. Consider that he is a lonely old man. Since our gentleman has taken him in, let him be. Just do not let him surrender the estate.” Ma Fu and Ma Gui stopped their attack. Ma Yu whispered something into the ear of the tribute student, Ma Long. Then Ma Long said to the assembly, “You children need not make a fuss. Everyone return home. I have my own decision. I will not allow him to surrender; how dare he do so!” This old tribute student was the senior elder of the Ma clan; no one dared disobey. Thus, everyone returned home.

Ma Yu secretly kept Ma Long, Ma Wenkui, and Ma Zhao behind and invited them into the study. He treated them with wine and food. The old tribute student sat at the head, the scholar Ma Wenkui to his right, the academy student Ma Zhao to his left, and Ma Yu on the right side. Just as they sat, a servant boy passed cups and bowls, raised goblets and poured wine, bringing forth delicious dishes beyond description. After three rounds of wine, Ma Yu stood and said, “With the three elders and two uncles present, I, Ma Yu, have a matter of heart to discuss with you.” Ma Wenkui said, “Speak freely. We will all consider it.” Ma Yu said, “Do you think I truly intend to surrender the family estate to Wang Chongyang? I only wish to let him watch over it for a few years so I may enjoy some leisure.” Ma Zhao said, “Letting him watch over it is no problem, but why draft a surrender paper?” Ma Yu said, “Brother, you do not understand. This is but a temporary expedient to bind that old man’s heart so he will truly and sincerely watch over the estate. Then I can rest assured, and he will not be negligent.” Ma Wenkui said, “I do not understand this reasoning. Please explain it slowly.” Ma Yu said, “Uncle, listen to my explanation. Because I am often ill and your niece-in-law frequently suffers dizziness, it is difficult to manage affairs. I wanted to find a loyal and honest person to manage things for me. Fortunately, as Heaven wills, this Master Wang came—an extremely loyal and honest man. I told him to manage the estate well, as if it were his own home, without wavering or distraction. The old man would not listen and asked me, ‘Do you mean to surrender this estate to me?’ I said this was foolish talk and answered him in jest, ‘If I surrender it to you, then I surrender it to you—what’s the big deal?’ It was plainly a joke, but he took it seriously and asked me to have the clan elders issue a surrender paper to him. I thought he was a lonely man without kin or friends, and he could not move anywhere else. Besides, he is advanced in years and cannot live many more years. So I agreed to draft a paper to please him, so he would dedicate himself to managing the estate. I could then enjoy leisure and nurture my illness. After he dies, the estate will still return to me. What harm is there? I hope you, uncle, will act as arbiter and help make this happen.”

Ma Wenkui said, “There are many in the clan; I cannot decide alone. We should ask the senior elder what he thinks.” Before he finished, the old tribute student Ma Long shook his head and said, “I do not interfere with the next generation; I cannot decide. Let us see what Ma Zhao says.” Ma Zhao said, “With the clan elders present, how could I presume to decide on my own?” Ma Yu knew that empty words would not suffice, so he went inside and took out a certain treasure. He flashed it before their eyes, and they were entranced, unable to resist his will. What was this treasure?

It was dense, hard, and firm; with it, all matters could be done.

Its flashing shapes were round and square, unmatched in myriad ways.

Ma Yu then presented this treasure to the three men. Once they received it, their eyes closed with smiles, and they could only comply. The tribute student said to Ma Wenkui, “Ma Yu spoke clearly just now. This is merely a borrowed surrender paper to bind that old man’s heart so he will focus on managing the estate. There is no harm in this.” Ma Wenkui said, “Though a temporary expedient, it requires everyone’s cooperation.” Ma Zhao said, “So long as the senior elder and uncle agree, I will ensure the others are pacified.” Ma Wenkui said, “If not, I and the senior elder will decide, but I do not know how you will persuade the others.” Ma Zhao whispered a few words to him, and Ma Wenkui smiled, “Excellent! With this plan, how could they not comply?” He then rose and said to Ma Yu, “Rest assured; it will be accomplished. But how to draft the surrender paper is another matter. We shall see in the next chapter.”
