# Chapter Seven: Bribing the Clan Chief Ma Yu to Establish the Deed of Surrender — Discussing Profound Cultivation, Chongyang Passes on Quanzhen

The flowing water rushes swift, no time to pause or tarry,  
From towering cliffs ten thousand feet high, it lets go freely.  

Fame and profit entangle like nets and snares,  
Yet when one lets go all attachments, no demon can ensnare.  

It is said that Master Ma Yuanwai, having employed the words of Sun Yuanzhen, bribed the three involved parties within the clan. Ma Wenkui then instructed Ma Zhao to address the clan folk, saying, “Ma Niu’s plan to surrender the family wealth is indeed a clever stratagem.” The clan members asked, “What sort of stratagem is this?” Ma Zhao replied, “It is the plan to leave the tiger guarding the mountain.” The people pressed further, “What is the true intent behind this plan?” Ma Zhao said, “Ma Yu wishes to enjoy leisure and ease, so he leaves that old man merely as a steward of the wealth.” The clan asked again, “How can you be sure he will be left as steward?” Ma Zhao answered, “Ma Yu sees that old man as loyal and honest, so he wants to leave him to manage the household. Yet fearing the old man might not apply himself diligently, he feigns surrendering the family wealth to him. The old man believes it true and demands a deed of surrender. Ma Yu does not want to sign such a deed, but fearing the old man’s laxness, he invites us to witness and writes a formal agreement, binding his heart so that he guards with true sincerity. Is this not leaving the tiger to guard the mountain?” The clan said, “If the wealth is surrendered to him, it is his; how could he not guard it?” Ma Zhao said, “How can he take even a fraction of it, and still call it his?” The clan asked, “How do you know he cannot take even a fraction?” Ma Zhao replied, “He is a solitary old man from afar, with no kin, and of great age. He cannot eat much, nor wear much. When his eyes close, he came empty-handed and will leave empty-handed. The original estate remains with the old owner. That old man merely guards for others — is he not a steward of wealth?” Hearing this, the clan laughed together. Ma Zhao further tempted them with profit: “When that old man dies, the wealth returns to Ma Yu. Ma Yu has no heirs; why worry it will not fall to our sons and nephews? Now we go with the current, do this favor, fulfill his wish. I see that old gentleman is a man of feeling and righteousness. If we settle this matter, in future if there is any shortfall, we can borrow from him. Thus, it is wise to leave a way open for future dealings.” Hearing Ma Zhao’s words, the clan all gladly consented.  

Words need not be many; if not for bribery, private matters would not be so easily settled.  

A single phrase can quell storms; yet even good words may err or mislead.  

It is said that Ma Zhao, seeing the clan’s agreement, set the time for the next day to gather. The next day, the clan members came to Master Ma Yuanwai’s home, where they saw the venerable scholar Ma Long sitting with Master Wang Chongyang in the hall, chatting and laughing, gesturing and discussing heaven and earth with warmth and ease. Ma Wenkui ordered Ma Yuanwai to prepare many tables laden with food and wine. When all the clan had arrived, he began to speak: “All elders and juniors, high and low, are here. Now Ma Yu wishes to surrender the family wealth to Master Wang Chongyang. Do you all consent or not?” All those present, as Ma Zhao had predicted, consented without dissent. They answered in unison, “We all consent, no objections.” Ma Wenkui then called Ma Yu to write the deed of surrender. When done, he read it aloud to the assembly. Ma Wenkui lifted the document and had Ma Zhao read it clearly:  

“The undersigned Ma Yu hereby surrenders the ancestral estate, fields, houses, silver, goods, servants, maids, furniture, tools, and all possessions inherited from his grandfather, entrusting them under the name and management of the venerable Master Wang Chongyang, to be freely used and governed at his discretion. No member of the Ma clan objects. After surrender, Ma Yu shall not retract. To prevent empty words, this agreement is hereby established as proof. Witnessed by clan chiefs Ma Long, Ma Wenkui, Ma Wenxian, Ma Wende, Ma Wenyu, and witnesses Ma Zhao, Ma Ming, Ma Jian, Ma Zhen. The undersigned Ma Yu is true.”  

Ma Zhao finished reading the deed and handed it back to Ma Yu. Ma Yu presented it with both hands to Master Wang Chongyang, who accepted it and immediately ordered the feast to begin — great chunks of meat eaten, large cups of wine drained. They ate and drank until drunk and full, then dispersed.  

The poet, reading thus far, sometimes remarks on Ma Yu’s bold resolve to surrender his estate in those years. Hence his swift attainment of the Dao. The poem says:  

Having surrendered all wealth to seek cultivation,  
Today he lets go of all false thoughts.  
Leaving nothing behind, how can one live?  
Thus in future years, the Way is first attained.  

Meanwhile, Ma Yuanwai saw the clan disperse and returned to the inner chambers. He said, “If not for my lady’s teaching, how could I have accomplished this matter?” Sun Yuanzhen smiled and said, “All things done in accord with principle come to pass.” Ma Yuanwai replied, “It is done, but how shall we seek the Dao now?” Sun Yuanzhen said, “The quest for the Dao must proceed step by step. Let the master rest a few days, then we shall go together to pay respects to the teacher.” Ma Yuanwai repeatedly praised this as excellent.  

Leaving aside Ma Yuanwai and Sun Yuanzhen’s plans to seek the Dao, it is said that Master Wang Chongyang, with single-hearted purpose, gathered cultivators from all under Heaven to cultivate the true way and nurture their nature. Yet fearing slander and trouble from neighbors, he first bestowed favors so all would hold goodwill and share in grace, thus making them his helpers. He widely practiced expedient means, generously bestowing kindness — money and rice given from time to time to aid the poor, widows, and orphans. When the Ma clan had shortages or difficulties, he helped fill the gaps. If a man could not marry, he arranged marriage; if a woman could not wed, he arranged her match. For sickness and funerals, nothing was neglected. For debts owed nearby, he did not seek repayment. Truly, as Ma Zhao said, he was a man of benevolence and righteousness. Thus inside and out, all was peaceful and orderly. People came freely to hear the Dao and discuss the profound, with no idle gossip or confusion, clear from beginning to end. All this was the power of kindness bestowed on others. Those in high places or wealthy families should not be stingy or selfish, withholding kindness from others. Later readers, upon reaching this, sigh in verse:  

Stingy hearts cannot succeed,  
If not for Master Wang’s grace.  
Idle words arise at all times,  
How can peace last for years?  

It is said that Master Wang Chongyang, having bestowed favors outwardly and managed affairs within, established more than ten thatched huts beside the rear garden, places for cultivators to rest and quiet themselves. When all was ready, the Master moved into one central hut to awaken功. One day Ma Yu and the couple Sun Yuanzhen came to the hut, knelt together, and asked the Master for instruction. Master Wang Chongyang said, “The Dao is the path of awakening, guiding people back to the awakened path and out of confusion. Yet one must proceed from shallow to deep, from small to great, following order, to achieve功. All who seek the Dao must first refine their nature. Nature is originally innate; it must be refined to become round and bright, shining with true power. Nature is linked with emotion; when nature and emotion stir, they rage like tiger and dragon. Without refining to subdue them, how can one remove their wildness and return to emptiness? The way to refine nature is to be in a state of muddled confusion — unknowing and unaware, no self and no other. Only by refining thus can one enter the法. The way of subduing dragons and tigers must be practiced, and one must also bind the heart-monkey and tether the intention-horse. The so-called heart-monkey is cunning like a monkey, the intention-horse swift like a fiery steed. They must be tied and locked so the monkey cannot act slyly, the horse cannot run wild, thus returning to stillness and calm. The功 of stillness and calm can seize the creative power of Heaven and Earth, the wondrous principles of yin and yang. When still, all worries vanish; when calm, not a single thought arises. Acting in accord with this is mundane; acting against it is immortal. One must have no trace of杂念 in the heart, no slightest obstacle — empty, hollow, unattached to anything, deep and dark, without a single thing. This is the great outline of the Dao: utterly unburdened, unstained by dust. Beyond this lies profound mystery, indescribable, only to be grasped by heart and mind. When you progress further, I shall point it out to you.”  

Ma Yu then took the Dao name 丹陽 (Danyang, “Cinnabar Sun”), and Sun Yuanzhen took the Dao name 不二 (Bu’er, “Not Two”), signifying eternal singleness of heart.  

Having taken their Dao names, Ma Danyang and Sun Bu’er bowed together to thank their master, then returned to the inner chambers. Sun Bu’er said to Ma Danyang, “Before we bowed to the master to learn the Dao, we were husband and wife. Now, as fellow disciples learning the wondrous Dao, I call you senior brother, and you call me fellow Daoist. Moreover, those who study the Dao must sever affection; we must live separately, you may not come to my room, nor I to yours. If there is need to discuss, we may send a maid back and forth to invite each other, then meet in the front hall to talk.” Ma Danyang said, “As you wish, I have no objection. If you are sincere, and I am earnest, then even if for a year or a year and a half I do not come to your room, it matters not.” Having said this, Danyang called Ma Xing to bring blankets and bedding, and set up a bed in the front side room. He bade farewell to Sun Bu’er and settled in the side room. Later poets wrote:  

Husband and wife separate rooms with firm resolve,  
Thus attainment of the Dao is made easy.  

The great Dao does not cling to affection; behold how Patriarch Ma acted in those years.  

How can attachment bring功?  
Spouses apart, hearts most sincere.  

It is said that after Sun Bu’er separated from Ma Danyang, half a month passed unnoticed. One day she sent a maid to invite Ma Danyang to come to the hut to inquire about the Dao. Ma Danyang left the side room to meet Sun Bu’er, and together they went to the hut to pay respects and ask the Master: “Master, you said yesterday that nature is originally innate. May we ask, what is this innate nature like?” Master Wang Chongyang said, “Innate is the chaotic one qi, without color or sound, unknowing and unaware. What is there to do? If you say it is like something, then it is not innate. The word ‘like’ itself loses the subtle truth; it cannot be spoken. To say innate is like this or like that is to fix it in form, and once fixed in form, it loses the propriety of innate. People say innate is here — this is already not so. People say innate is there — that is also not the meaning of innate. Saying and saying, there is nothing at all; to use one word to approximate it is futile. Do not say one word is innate; one word itself is not. If you now wish to know the principle of innate, I shall write it down for you in detail.” Having said this, the Master took up the brush in hand, intending to write out the subtle truth of innate, but how he would do so was not yet revealed. We shall see in the next chapter.  

Nature is originally the most numinous innate thing;  
To refine true nature is to refine the innate.
