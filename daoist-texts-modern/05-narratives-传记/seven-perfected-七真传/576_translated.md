# Chapter Eight: On the Primordial Unity of the Mysterious Principle — The Nondual Gate to Eradicating the Root of Demons

Seeking the path to immortality outside the heart leads one astray;  
Like the moon’s shadow in water, like flowers in a mirror—  
Do you know the wondrous principle of the primordial?  
It lies solely within the one heart, and there you may boast.

It is said that Master Chongyang spoke to Ma Danyang and Sun Bu’er, saying: “Nature is originally one primordial thing, perfectly round and brilliantly radiant. Though it bears a name, it has no form; unknown and unknowable, hard to describe or depict—what could it resemble? Now I will strive to sketch an image for you, but you must be sincere yourselves.” Having spoken, the Master took up a brush and first drew a circle upon a red lacquered stool—a simple ring, then another circle, and within the circle he placed a dot: ⊙. When finished, he asked Ma Danyang and Sun Bu’er, “Do you two understand this principle?” Both answered in unison, “We disciples are dull of heart and nature, unable to grasp this principle. We humbly ask Master to instruct us.”

Master Chongyang said: “The first circle is the indistinct, the murky chaos before Heaven and Earth parted, before sun and moon were set apart—this is called ‘Limitless’ (Wuji). From non-being arises being; thus, within the circle arises a point, called ‘Supreme Ultimate’ (Taiji). This point gives birth to Heaven, Earth, and all things. The primordial comes forth from the Supreme Ultimate; this point is the One Qi, hence called the primordial One Qi. This nature issues from the primordial, manifesting before it has form, abiding after form has faded. This point of numinous nature is the root that neither arises nor perishes—thus it is called the spiritual root (linggen). Everyone possesses this spiritual root, but ordinary people obscure themselves; those who obscure themselves are lost. Losing one’s true nature, deluded thoughts arise in full, evil and excess follow these thoughts, and one forever loses the primordial, never hearing the great Dao. The sea of suffering is boundless—where is the shore? Alas! Few awaken to the Dao, fewer still truly practice. The primordial can be verified anywhere; do not ask the primordial with the human heart. If you use the human heart to question the primordial, the primordial is originally unattainable. Relying on the Dao heart to question the primordial, the primordial is right before you. The human heart is the one heart darkened by greed and desire; the Dao heart is the conscience newly revealed. Once conscience is revealed, the primordial is gained without seeking. Moreover, one must dispel illness—not the illness of wind, cold, heat, or summer heat, but the illness of greed, anger, arrogance, and love. When this illness is removed, a hundred ailments do not arise; one may extend life and increase longevity, become Buddha or immortal, sage or worthy. Now I pass this work to you; you must diligently practice it. The way to remove illness is to remove its root. Find the root, and illness is not hard to cure. Most illness arises from greed, anger, ignorance, and love, also caused by wine, lust, wealth, and qi. Therefore, those who cultivate must first remove wine, lust, wealth, and qi, to eliminate external influences; then cut off greed, anger, ignorance, and love, to remove internal harm. When the root is pulled, the body heals itself; then the great Dao may be cultivated, and longevity attained.”

Now, speaking of the character for wine: some know wine harms the Dao and vow to quit it. Yet when they see wine, they still hold back with caution; or are persuaded by others; or see others drinking and thus desire to drink themselves. Though they have never drunk, once this desire arises, it is as if they have drunk—this is the root of the wine illness. To remove it, one must remove it at the moment the desire arises, only then can the root be fully pulled.

Some know lust harms the Dao and vow to remove it. Yet when they see beauty, they still guard their thoughts; or a coy gesture or tender smile stirs their heart, and desire arises. Though they have never consummated, once this feeling arises, it is as if they have consummated—this is the root of the lust illness. To remove it, one must remove it at the moment the feeling arises, only then can the root be fully cut. Thus, the root of wine and lust illness lies hidden in the heart and mind. To remove the root of illness, first correct the heart and make the intention sincere, and the root will sever itself. The root remains uncut only because the heart and mind are not upright. When the heart and mind are not upright, a fleeting thought arises: though one has not drunk, the mind desires to drink; though one has not consummated, the heart desires to consummate. Originally there was no such thought, but external stimuli move the inner being—like the moon in water, when the shore rocks stir the water, the water moves and the moon’s reflection moves with it. Though the moon is not truly disturbed, its shadow shakes. The true Dao cannot be grasped thus.

Those who seek the method to sever the root: Confucians say, “Do not look upon what is improper; do not move toward what is improper; see as if not seen; hear as if not heard.” Buddhists say, “Forget self, forget others, forget all beings.” Daoists say, “See without seeing; hear without hearing.” All these can eradicate the root of wine and lust illness.

As for the character of wealth, it is difficult to speak of. Some, due to incomplete Dao affinity, temporarily calculate; some, due to poverty, seek livelihood; such circumstances cannot be helped. Some only slightly trace the original heart. Others, if speaking of status and appearance, speak of grandeur and splendor; of clothing and food; of fields and houses; of strange skills and licentiousness, always rolling in the marketplace of profit, repeatedly calculating with abacus and scales, desiring both fame and profit, yet also to become immortal or Buddha—such people come to learn the Dao? Is it not laughable? As for qi, no one is yet balanced; who has just qi? Who nurtures righteous qi? They only stir up pure qi, restless qi, blood qi, and worldly qi, which show on their faces, compete in their words, strive in their affairs, and flaunt strength in anger. They recognize qi but not principle, lacking the vast and lofty qi! Such people come to learn the Dao? Is it not laughable! To sever this root of illness, Confucians say: “Unjust wealth and honor are to me like floating clouds.” Also: “Hold fast to your will; do not let your qi be violent.” Buddhists say: “Do not accept blessings or merits; attain through patience.” Daoists say: “Break all stinginess and greed; with a compassionate heart, humble qi.” All these can remove the root of wealth illness.

These four beginnings—if you wish to sever the root of illness, you must correct your heart and mind. Confucians emphasize awakening; Buddhists emphasize awareness; Daoists emphasize enlightenment. If you can awaken, be aware, and enlighten, then all matters under Heaven become clear. Master Chongyang finished explaining the principles of removing illness. Ma Danyang and Sun Bu’er then asked how to practice sitting meditation. Master Chongyang said: “Sit quietly, forget emotions, stop thoughts—let the mind die and the spirit live. Lay a thick mat, loosen your belt, and at the hour of the Rat face east, sitting cross-legged with a slight bend. Clench your fists firmly, straighten your body; tap your teeth and swallow saliva; press the tongue to the roof of the mouth; use the ears to listen inwardly; half-close the eyes, letting the eyelids droop. Let the spirit’s light reflect back to below the navel—this is called the Mysterious Pass (xuanguan). In sitting practice, you must stop all delusive thoughts; even the slightest delusion causes the spirit to lose pure yang, and the work cannot succeed. You must also forget emotions; if emotions remain, the mind is unsettled and the Dao cannot be achieved. A thick mat allows sitting without weariness; loose clothes and belt let qi flow freely. The hour of the Rat is when yang qi arises; facing east draws in the vital energy of life. Sitting cross-legged gathers and nurtures spirit and qi. Clenching the fists with thumbs pinching the third finger is to forget form. Keeping the body upright and spine straight lets the spaces between vertebrae open, so qi does not stagnate. Tapping lips and teeth prevents loss of qi in the tower of the mouth. The mouth is the aperture of qi; if open, qi scatters, so it should be closed. The ears connect to the essence aperture; thus, listening inwardly means hearing without hearing. Half-opening the eyes prevents darkness; the eyes are the aperture of spirit. If the eyes are harmed by color, spirit scatters. Fully open, spirit leaks; fully closed, spirit darkens—thus the eyelids droop halfway. The spirit’s light reflects from the Mysterious Pass to below the navel, like the sun and moon illuminating and giving birth to all things. Speak little to gather qi and prevent leakage from the mouth; cut off sound to nurture essence and prevent leakage from the ears; empty the visual field to condense spirit and prevent leakage from the eyes—thus one is called a True Person without leakage.”

Master Chongyang finished his teaching on the Dao. He added: “This is the work of sitting meditation, the gateway to entering listening. Do not regard it as empty or false. You must diligently practice it, and results will come. Do not be lax and thus ruin your future.” Having spoken, the Master gave further pointed instructions. Ma Danyang and Sun Bu’er understood his meaning silently, took their leave, and returned to their places to practice accordingly. Gradually, effects appeared, and they thought the Dao ended here. For more than a month, they practiced solely this work without seeking further refinement at the hermitage. One day, Ma Danyang was sitting in meditation in a side room when Master Chongyang entered. Ma Danyang rose to receive him, and the Master sat down, saying to Danyang: “The great Dao is boundless, inexhaustible in taking, inexhaustible in using. You must let it pervade all transformations; do not cling to one end. Sincerely turn your heart toward the Dao; truly reform your faults—that alone benefits body and mind. The Dao does not move without cause; every moment must not leave the original essence; every word and deed must come from the heart. Be clear and undarkened; every thought filled with benevolence—this is true turning to the Dao. If faults are not corrected and not removed, it is like illness in the private self; use the public heart to remove the private; if illness lies in desire, use the principle heart to remove desire; if illness lies in bias, use the central heart to remove bias; if illness lies in arrogance, use the harmonious heart to remove arrogance. Wherever the illness lies, treat it there. Seek help thus: arise and awaken; awaken and sweep away; sweep away and extinguish. Naturally, the heart becomes harmonious like spring breeze, bright as stars and moon, vast as Heaven and Earth, still as mountains. Gradually qi fills and spirit overflows, silently moving the One Origin, filling the four limbs. Unknowingly, the great Dao is achieved.”

Leaving aside the conversation between Master Wang Chongyang and Ma Danyang, we turn to Sun Bu’er, who was sitting alone in her room meditating. Suddenly, Master Wang Chongyang lifted the door curtain and entered. Startled, Sun Bu’er hurriedly stood, about to speak, when the Master smiled and said: “The Dao’s principle is subtle; the Dao’s method boundless; all is interconnected; myriad schools pay homage to the source. One must live it lively and move it naturally—that is true merit. But you, so cold and lonely, sitting here all alone, it is useless. Do you not know that solitary yin cannot be born, lone yang cannot grow? Sitting dead like this, yin and yang cannot communicate. How can you conceive? How can you bear a child? Let me tell you: if you want this without that, or that without this—”

Master Wang Chongyang said this and that, making Sun Bu’er’s face flush red with shame. Trembling all over, she hurriedly lifted the door curtain and ran outside, sitting before the hall. She called for the maid Qiuxiang to quickly fetch the master of the house. Qiuxiang, seeing her mistress so angry, dared not delay and hurried to the front chamber to invite Master Ma. Ma Danyang was then accompanying Master Chongyang discussing the wondrous Dao when Qiuxiang rushed in, saying to Master Ma: “I do not know why my mistress is angry; she sits before the hall and calls me to invite you. She has something to say.” Ma Danyang excused himself to the Master: “Master, please forgive me; I will return shortly.” Master Chongyang nodded his head slightly and said, “Go, go; who knows what will come of this journey?” The story will continue in the next chapter.

Not knowing this or that principle, thus arise such and such thoughts.
