# Chapter Nine: Wang Chongyang’s Manifestation Saves Souls — Sun Bu’er’s Anger at the Master

I, in guiding sentient beings and bestowing the true transmission, find words fail to express the boundless presence and absence.

Though one clearly knows the great Dao is not distant, if one enters without focused heart, the opportunity is lost.

As Ma Danyang heard Qiu Xiang’s words, saying that Lady Sun was before the hall, angry without cease, and wished to invite the gentleman out to speak, Ma Danyang then told the master, “It is my Dao-friend Sun who, for some unknown vexation, wishes me to go and talk. Master, please rest a while; I will go and return shortly to accompany you.” Master Wang Chongyang smiled and said, “Go, go.” Ma Danyang left the front chamber and came to the hall, where he saw Sun Bu’er’s face flushed red, anger unstoppable. Ma Danyang put on a smiling face and asked Sun Bu’er, “Dao-friend Sun, why are you so enraged? Could it be that some household servant has offended you? As the host, you must broaden your mind and not quarrel with them.” Sun Bu’er said, “Brother, you do not know. We hold Wang Chongyang as a man of the Way, yet who would have thought that old fellow so improper? Just now he came into my sleeping chamber and spoke many unpleasant words—truly vexing. I shall give up this dao-study.” Ma Danyang asked, “When did the master come into your room?” Sun Bu’er said, “Just now.” Ma Danyang said, “That is a lie. The master has been in my room since early, speaking of the Way without moving an inch. I have not left his side. The master is now in my room; when Qiu Xiang came to invite me, she also saw him. If you do not believe me, ask Qiu Xiang.” 

Before Sun Bu’er could reply, Qiu Xiang said, “When I went to invite the master, Old Wang was speaking of Heaven and Earth, so engrossing. After the gentleman left with me, I do not know if he is still there or not.” Hearing this, Sun Bu’er lowered her head in silence. Ma Danyang, fearing the master waited long in the side room, said no more to Sun Bu’er and hastened back to the side chamber. 

Meanwhile, Sun Bu’er brooded with a belly full of anger, only wishing to call Ma Danyang out to scold the master and vent her rage. Yet, to her surprise, it only dampened her spirit, leaving her gloomy and displeased. She then returned to the inner chamber. 

More than a month passed before Ma Danyang personally came to the thatched hut to inquire of the master. Wang Chongyang said, “Sit down, I shall tell you.” Then with a deep sigh he said: 

“Alas! Among those who cultivate the Way in this world, some cultivate in external matters, some in outward appearance, some in daily routines—all miss the mark by far, having no share in the true Dao. Others cultivate through the ears and eyes, the belly and stomach, through reverence and respect—all these methods of doing are not the Way, for they lose the essence of the true Dao and cannot be called the Dao. Its form flows forth, impossible to fully express. Some approach it from side doors, some falsely claim to refine and practice, some are heavy in show but light in stillness, some are earnest in will but weak in power—all have their ailments. Some are too light, some too heavy, none proceed naturally from within. Thus, they delight here and worry there, advance an inch but retreat a yard, never tasting the subtle charm of the great Dao, truly unaware. 

In sum, the human heart is not extinguished; the Dao-heart is not perfected. The human heart is not extinguished because one has not seen through worldly affections: fearing clothes not be splendid, fearing food not be fresh and tasty, fearing reputation not be spread, fearing talent not be revealed, fearing silver and goods not be abundant, fearing fields and houses not be vast. All cannot be seen lightly, harboring desires for blessings, sometimes wishing for peace, sometimes lamenting poverty, sometimes dreaming of luxury—full of selfish desires. This is what is called the human heart. Without diminishing it, one cannot see lightly the worldly and let it go. All people have this true nature, the vessel made by the Way, the root foundation for accomplishment. Yet because they cannot see lightly the world, the Dao-heart is not perfected. 

What is called the Dao-heart is the heart that is light: light in having, light in not having; light in beauty, light in ugliness; light in gain, light in loss; light in disgrace, light in praise; light in birth, light in death. To see lightly all things is the Dao-heart. This heart, used to cultivate the Way, and the Dao can be accomplished; used to subdue demons, it will vanish by itself. Cultivators, can you not discard the human heart and keep the Dao-heart? I only wish all would awaken the Dao-heart and attain the true fruit.” 

Not to speak further of Master Chongyang’s discourse with Ma Danyang, let us return to Sun Bu’er. Since that day in the hall, after Ma Danyang’s few words, she was left silent and speechless, returning to her room with a heart unconvinced. If she said she was dreaming, she had not slept—so whence the dream? Moreover, she clearly saw him enter, his words ringing in her ears. Why then say he was in the side room, never moving? This left her puzzled beyond reason. 

While she pondered, Master Wang Chongyang lifted the curtain, smiling broadly as he strode in and said, “The great Dao does not distinguish male from female; without yin and yang, it cannot be.” Sun Bu’er let him enter and sit, but she herself stood by the doorpost and asked, “Master, if you are not meditating in the thatched hut, what brings you to the boudoir?” Wang Chongyang said, “Because you carry the furnace of creation on your back, sitting alone in stillness, your qi turns dry. A woman without a husband is a resentful woman; a man without a wife is a lonely man. I now plainly tell you, without one yin and one yang, there can be no Dao. Yin and yang paired is the right principle. The matchmaker urges drink with the hand lifting the pot: the woman of the west, the man of the east, harmonizing and matching. Only because the matchmaker is witness do the husband and wife enter the bridal chamber, the two eights matching to unite and mingle, forming a fetus beside the body. Ten months of nurturing and warmth complete the work, birthing a child stronger than others. If you now follow my teaching, you will stand before the Jade Emperor in the heavenly palace.” 

Sun Bu’er, hearing this, made no reply. She went outside and overturned the two doors of her room, determined to confront and seek out Ma Danyang to verify the master’s words. Seeing the side room door closed, she asked the servant Ma Xing, who said the gentleman had gone to the thatched hut. Hearing this, Sun Bu’er went straight there. 

Meanwhile, Ma Danyang was in the thatched hut accompanying Master Wang Chongyang’s discourse. The master was speaking of the need for the human heart to be light and the Dao-heart to be true, when suddenly he laughed heartily and said to Danyang, “Go quickly! Someone is looking for you.” Hearing the master’s words, Ma Danyang feared a guest had arrived and took his leave, going out of the hut toward the front hall. There he met Sun Bu’er head-on. Sun Bu’er grabbed his clothes with one hand and said, “You must go see.” Ma Danyang asked, “See what?” Sun Bu’er said, “Don’t ask, just go and you will understand.” Ma Danyang had no choice but to follow her to the inner room’s door. Sun Bu’er unlatched it and called Ma Danyang inside to look. Ma Danyang, not knowing the reason, stepped in and looked around. The bed curtains and bedding were as before, the chests and boxes remained unchanged, and except for the chair removed, nothing else was different. He asked Sun Bu’er, “What did you want me to see?” Sun Bu’er said, “See your master.” Ma Danyang said, “The master is in the thatched hut speaking with me; what master is here?” Sun Bu’er, unconvinced, entered herself, lifting the curtains and blankets, searching under and behind the bed, everywhere, but found no trace. She kept muttering, “Strange, strange!” Ma Danyang said, “What is strange? This is because your Dao thoughts are impure; you are possessed by demons.” Sun Bu’er said, “Brother, what are you talking about? I have no distracting thoughts, only a heart for stillness. How could I be possessed? The master came twice into my room; his form is vividly before my eyes, his voice still in my ears, his words clearly remembered. How could this be possession?” Ma Danyang said, “What words did the master say? Tell me.” Sun Bu’er then repeated all the words Master Wang Chongyang spoke during his two visits. Ma Danyang laughed heartily and said, “Dao-friend Sun, you have been wise all your life but confused this once. Now you are lost.” Sun Bu’er said, “How am I lost?” 

Ma Danyang said, “Those who study the Way must be humble and lowly, not ashamed to ask below. Only then can one take a step and then another, each step higher than the last. Accumulating threads into inches, inches into feet, feet into yards, yards into thousands, thousands into tens of thousands. The subtlety of the Dao cannot be counted by numbers, hence it is said the Dao’s marvel is boundless. You have now grasped a little mysterious skill and think the Dao ends here. Each month you guard this room, sitting in despair and dryness, ignorant of yin and yang’s principle, unknowing of creation’s mechanism, never going to the master for instruction. Blocked by distinctions of male and female, you have given rise to notions of self and other. The master sees you clinging to this method and unable to realize the Dao, so he personally came to instruct you. But fearing suspicion, he manifested his yang spirit and a double to save you. The master often tells me that one yin and one yang is called the Dao; without yin and yang, the Dao cannot be. This yin and yang is the yin and yang of the yang fire and yin talisman, not the yin and yang of male marrying female or worldly yin and yang. This is to speak of such subtle principles; pity you do not understand. That is to speak of such profound mysteries; alas, you do not know. 

The lone yang cannot grow: yang belongs to fire; too much fire makes restlessness, unable to form the elixir. The lone yin cannot give birth: yin produces water; too much water overflows, unable to form the elixir. This lone yin and lone yang are like water and fire unable to aid each other. In sum, cultivators must balance water and fire, connect yin and yang, to return the elixir. Saying you carry the furnace of creation means plainly you do not understand the principle of true yin and true yang: a lonely man and resentful woman also symbolize lone yin not giving birth and lone yang not growing! Therefore, I clearly tell you, those who study the Way cannot be without this yin and yang. This yin and yang is the wondrous use of returning the elixir. The matchmaker is true intention! Using true intention to harmonize yin and yang is like lifting the pot to urge a good drink. 

True intention belongs to earth; earth contains yellow, thus it is likened to a matchmaker. The western woman is metal; metal flourishes in the west, hence ‘western woman.’ The eastern man is wood; wood flourishes in the east, hence ‘eastern man.’ The two match the number two and eight to one jin. Metal is not the child of wood and cannot conquer it; wood is not the child of metal and cannot generate it—this is the principle of yin-yang creation and the Five Phases’ generating and overcoming. Cultivators must use intention to harmonize, like a matchmaker uniting two families, so metal and wood meet without gap, like a harmonious couple. The bridal chamber is the cinnabar field, where metal and wood return. Metal is the corporeal soul; wood is the ethereal soul. Gathering soul and spirit in one place, clinging and inseparable, like husband and wife matched. Mercury is also eight taels; lead is also eight taels. The mingling is the place of elixir formation: the soul and spirit depend on each other; the essence and qi seem to respond, condensing within like pregnancy. Ten months is a sufficient number; nurturing is the fire’s timing. This means essence and qi condense and are refined by fire’s timing to form the elixir, completing the work, and the infant is born. The infant is the spirit transformed from true qi! This spirit emerges from the mud pellet palace, ascends to the golden palace, and becomes a true person—is this not a transcendent immortal?” 

Having spoken thus, Danyang made Bu’er greatly enlightened. What follows next? Wait for the next chapter’s unfolding.

Harmonizing yin and yang, connecting true intention, Bodhi’s clear heart traces the path.

If you wish to explore the wondrous mysteries of the Pure Land, the Dao lies with the master but cultivation rests with oneself.
