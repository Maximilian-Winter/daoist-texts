# Chapter Ten: Teaching the Three Vehicles and Expounding the Complete Reality Dao — Willingly Losing One’s Beauty to Become an Ugly Person

Once the true transmission of the dao is obtained, cultivation may begin; the wondrous methods of the three vehicles are at your command to seek.

On that day, Yuan Zhen destroyed his own face, exchanging it for a golden body that endures through ten thousand autumns.

It is said that Sun Bu’er, having heard the words of Ma Danyang, was struck as if by a sudden blow to the head—breaking through the net of confusion, awakening as if from a dream. She sighed, saying, “If not for the words of my senior brother, I might have nearly ruined the great matter. I have always thought myself more discerning than you, yet why is it that in learning the dao I fall short of you?” Ma Danyang replied, “It is not that you are inferior to me, but because you have not gone to receive instruction, you remain behind. Thus it is said that cleverness can be the undoing of cleverness; many a bright mind misleads itself. In all the world, only by learning can one know; how many are born knowing from the start?” Sun Bu’er respectfully said, “I will heed the master’s teaching and henceforth receive instruction with humility.” Ma Danyang was greatly pleased, then returned to his chamber.

Several days later, preparing to visit his maternal uncle’s home to offer birthday congratulations, he gathered the gifts and informed the master, also inviting Sun Bu’er to accompany him. Sun Bu’er feigned illness and declined to go. Ma Danyang had no choice but to send the gifts by a servant boy, mounting his black donkey to set off for his uncle’s house.

Leaving aside Ma Danyang’s departure, we turn to Sun Bu’er alone in her room. Because Ma Danyang had said she was unwilling to receive instruction and thus did not understand the subtle dao, she pondered this deeply. Seeing Ma Danyang absent and the servants all playing outside, she quietly went to the thatched hermitage, where the master sat cross-legged in meditation. She knelt before him and said, “Disciple Sun Bu’er is dull of heart and unclear of the ultimate principle, causing two mistakes. Yesterday, by senior brother’s enlightenment, I realized my former words were the dao. I now regret my shortcomings and beg the master’s forgiveness, hoping you will instruct me once more.” Having spoken, she kowtowed repeatedly.

Master Wang Chongyang said, “Rise, and I shall speak with you. The dao has three vehicles; measure your strength and proceed accordingly. Now I will explain to you—see which vehicle you can learn.” Sun Bu’er stood and bowed, listening attentively.

Wang Chongyang said, “Those who learn the dao must place life and death beyond concern; breaking through the word ‘death’ itself, one may become a person who does not die. The highest vehicle is the Way of Emptiness and Nothingness: utterly unburdened, unstained by a single speck, like the bright moon shining in a cloudless sky stretching ten thousand miles. A single numinous root can seize the creative power of Heaven and Earth, contemplate the true principle of yin and yang, and by methodically refining it, cause the existent to return to the nonexistent, and from the nonexistent again give birth to the existent. One may age with Heaven and Earth, cultivate alongside sun and moon—this is the supreme path of the celestial immortals.

The middle vehicle is to hold reverence and purity, to fast and observe precepts, to worship the holy and true with ritual propriety, to recite the sacred names of the Heavenly Venerables, to chant the secret texts of the Most High. With a single pure thought, all worries vanish; one ascends to the vault of the heavens, where myriad spirits see through all, the spiritual light never extinguished. A single true nature reaches straight into emptiness, placing one among the ranks of immortals—this is the middle vehicle.

The lower vehicle is to accumulate merit and deeds, broadly practicing expedient means, aiding people and benefiting things, constantly examining faults and errors. With true abiding, one’s spirit and clarity naturally manifest, sometimes hidden, sometimes revealed, indistinguishable from immortals—this is the lower vehicle.

Now, measure your strength and choose which vehicle you wish to learn, and I shall impart to you the true secret.”

Sun Bu’er said, “I desire to learn the highest vehicle, the celestial immortal’s dao.”

Wang Chongyang smiled and said, “Your heart is indeed great, but I fear your resolve is not firm.”

Sun Bu’er replied, “My heart is not great, but my will is very firm. This body may perish, but my resolve cannot be taken.”

Wang Chongyang said, “All who cultivate the dao must obtain the numinous qi of mountains and rivers; thus, the choice of place is not to be neglected. Now, in the eastern commandery of Luoyang, the numinous qi is at its peak, and a true immortal is destined to emerge. If you go there and cultivate for twelve years, you may hope to attain the dao. Can you go?”

Sun Bu’er said, “Disciple is willing to go.”

Wang Chongyang looked at her and shook his head, saying, “You cannot go! You cannot go!”

Sun Bu’er said, “I am willing to give up life and forget death; how can I not go?”

Wang Chongyang said, “Death must be died to some benefit; if death is without benefit, is it not a waste of life? Luoyang lies a thousand li away from here. Along the way, there are many frivolous wanderers and many reckless youths. If they see your face, fair as flower and jade, would they not be moved? At best, they will mock and jeer; at worst, they will violate you. You are of chaste and loyal nature; how could you endure such defilement? You would surely risk death to preserve your honor. You seek longevity, yet would lose your life instead. This is why I say you cannot go.”

Sun Bu’er pondered these words for a long while but did not refuse the master. She left the hermitage and went to the kitchen, sending all the cooks away. She personally kindled the fire, poured a jar of clear oil into the pot, and waited until the oil boiled. Then she took a bowl of cold water in her hand, turned her face toward the pot, closed her eyes tightly, and with resolve poured the cold water into the boiling oil. The hot oil, meeting the cold water’s sudden arrival, splattered all over her face, burning it with blisters wherever it touched. Enduring the pain, Sun Bu’er came to see the master and said, “Is my face in this state fit for going?”

Wang Chongyang clapped his hands and laughed, “Wonderful, wonderful! The world indeed has such a person of great ambition. It is not in vain that I have come to Shandong to make this journey.” Having spoken, the master then imparted the subtle principles of yin and yang, the mysterious workings of creation, the forging of yin into yang, the transcendence from the mundane to the sage. When the teaching was complete, he said, “The Great Dao hides in unknowing and unawareness. This unknowing and unawareness practice requires a touch of madness and frenzy to conceal it from others, so that none know you have skill, none perceive your cultivation. Only when great merit is accomplished may you reveal yourself and speak the dharma. When your oil-blistered face has healed, go forth to Luoyang; no need to bid me farewell. When your merit and fruition are full, we shall meet again at the Peach Banquet.”

Having said this, the master closed his eyes and fell silent. Sun Bu’er bowed several times, then left the hermitage. Outside, the servants and maids came in and were startled to see her; had it not been for her familiar clothes, they might not have recognized her. When asked why she was thus, Sun Bu’er said, “I wished to make some oil cakes with Master Chongyang, but feared you were not clean, so I sent you away and did it myself. I mistakenly poured cold water into hot oil and could not avoid the splashing, so my face is blistered. This is but a temporary calamity, nothing serious. Do not be alarmed. Each of you attend to your tasks and do not trouble yourselves about me.” Having said this, she returned to her inner chamber and closed the door, silently pondering the master’s teachings and practicing them one by one. The secret formulas and wondrous words she recited anew.

Two days later, Ma Danyang returned. Upon entering, the servants told him of Sun Bu’er’s face, burned by boiling oil. Ma Danyang sighed deeply, first going to the hermitage to see the master, then to the main chamber to meet Sun Bu’er. There he saw her face covered with blisters, already broken and oozing yellow fluid, transforming a countenance once like flower and jade into a ghastly mask. Ma Danyang could not help but sigh and exclaimed, “Comrade Sun, why were you not careful and allowed yourself to be burned so? If it had been worse—” Before he could finish, Sun Bu’er opened her eyes wide, looked at Ma Danyang, and burst into loud laughter. She stepped forward, grabbed Ma Danyang’s hand, and said, “Are you a child of the Queen Mother of the West? She sent you to invite me to the Peach Banquet. Today I shall go with you to the Heavenly Palace. Hurry, hurry!” Saying this, she climbed onto the table, grabbed the window lattice, as if to ascend. Suddenly she stumbled and fell to the ground, groaning.

Ma Danyang quickly helped her up, but she wept and laughed in turns. Seeing her in this state, Ma Danyang’s heart grew heavy with sorrow. He returned to the hermitage to see the master and said, “My comrade Sun seems mad with longing for immortals. What is to be done?” Wang Chongyang said, “Without madness and frenzy, who can become an immortal?” When Ma Danyang tried to ask more, the master had already closed his eyes and entered meditation, ignoring him. Seeing this, Ma Danyang left the hermitage and returned to the hall, feeling gloomy.

Meanwhile, Sun Bu’er, having driven Ma Danyang away with her mad words, found peace and quiet to practice. She cultivated until her essence was perfectly clear and wondrous beyond words, her heart bright and open. She realized many benefits in the dao and greatly delighted in them. Taking a water chestnut-shaped mirror, she looked at herself and was startled! Her face was covered with scars, red and black in patches, and having gone over a month without grooming, her hair was disheveled and wild, resembling a hairy ghost—clearly a demon or a fierce yaksha. Where was the refined lady of status? After looking at her reflection, she rejoiced inwardly, thinking, “Now I may go to Luoyang!”

She then roughly tore her clothes, smeared some soot on her face, and ran out into the hall, laughing loudly three times. This alarmed the maids, servants, and household boys, who all came running and surrounded her. Seeing them approach, Sun Bu’er tried to walk away. The maids grabbed her, and she bit wildly. One devoted maid held tightly to her clothes, but Sun Bu’er turned and bit her hand, drawing blood. The maid loosened her grip, and Sun Bu’er escaped. The servants, seeing her fierce manner, dared not come near. They hurried to inform the master of the household.

Meanwhile, Ma Danyang was meditating in the side chamber. Suddenly hearing the commotion outside, he rose and looked out. The servants reported, “Madam Sun has gone mad and run outside.” Hearing this, Ma Danyang feared something might happen, urgently ordered the servants to pursue quickly, and followed after them himself.

Sun Bu’er walked straight out of the estate. The gatekeepers could not stop her, and the people inside and outside the estate did not recognize her, so she escaped. Knowing pursuers would come, she entered a thicket of tangled grass outside the village. There she saw Ma Danyang and the household chasing after her. After going a short distance forward, she suddenly turned back by the same route. Watching them go away, she came out and headed southeast.

By day she begged in villages; by night she lodged in ancient temples, always in desolate, remote places with large trees and overhanging cliffs to shelter from rain. If anyone asked her, she spoke nonsense—sometimes words from heaven, sometimes from earth—crying and laughing madly. Others, seeing her like this, knew her as a madwoman and did not question her. Thus, she traveled safely. When she met upright gentlemen, she asked directions and within less than two months arrived at Luoyang.

Whether she truly attained immortality and the dao remains to be seen. This shall be told in the next chapter.
