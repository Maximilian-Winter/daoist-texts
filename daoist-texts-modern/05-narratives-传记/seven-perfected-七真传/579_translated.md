# Chapter Eleven: The Heavenly Lord’s Protection Against Hailstones — The Perfected One’s Subtle Guidance

For years one sinks and drowns in mire,  
The River of Love surges with waves that tower to the sky.  

Yet cultivation can lead to the high shore,  
Why seek another boat midstream to ply?

It is told that Sun Bu’er, after departing Ma Family Village, traveled feigning madness. For several months she wandered until she reached outside the city of Luoyang, where there stood a broken tile kiln. There she took refuge within the kiln, living by begging in the county town. She acted the part of a madwoman so thoroughly that children followed her along the way, calling out, “Crazy hag here! Crazy hag there!” Thus she became known far and wide. Everyone in the town and countryside knew her as the madwoman, and no one dared to trouble her. In this way, she found peace to awaken to the Dao, confirming the teaching of Master Chongyang that the great way is hidden within words of madness.

Now, in Luoyang County there were two notorious ruffians. One named Zhang San, the other Li Si. They were often guilty of lust and deceit, doing all manner of wickedness. They frequently saw Sun Bu’er begging on the streets. Though her face was marred and ugly, her eyes were bright and teeth white; if not for the many scars on her face, she might have been considered a person of talent. These two ruffians took note of her, keeping her in mind.

One night, the moon was bright and the wind clear, the stars sparkling across the vast sky. The two had just returned from deceiving honest villagers in the countryside, drunk and staggering. Not far from the broken tile kiln, Zhang San said to Li Si, “Let us go have some fun with that crazy hag!” Li Si replied, “No, no! I have heard that if you lie with a madwoman, you will suffer bad luck your whole life and never find lasting fortune.” Zhang San said, “We are those whom Heaven does not receive, whom Earth does not want—what care we for fortune or misfortune?” So he paid no heed to Li Si’s warning and went toward the broken tile kiln. Li Si had no choice but to follow.

After only a few steps, suddenly above their heads a black cloud gathered, spreading wide and thick. The sky darkened, and they could not see their own hands. A fierce wind rose, chilling them to the bone. Then, near the kiln, a thunderclap burst forth like a mountain collapsing, earth shattering, striking down upon one’s head. Zhang San and Li Si trembled all over with fright.

The black cloud swirled and scattered, blotting out Heaven and Earth. A wild storm broke loose, and a fierce rain began to fall, drumming on their heads like pounding drums, making them dizzy and aching. Li Si raised his hand to shield his head, but the rain struck the back of his hand like iron pellets. Only then did he realize it was not rain but hailstones—people called them “snow bullets,” commonly known as “cold pellets.” These cold pellets drove the two with no escape, nowhere to hide.

Li Si kept saying, “Living retribution! I told you not to come, but you forced your way—now see what happens!” Zhang San, hearing Li Si’s complaints, grew angry. Suddenly he stepped on a hailstone. The hailstone was smooth and slippery; how could he keep his footing? He slipped like a dragon twisting and turning, scrambling to get up, only to step on thin air again and fall flat once more, as if pushed by an unseen hand. He tripped and fell repeatedly, his head bruised and eyes swollen, flesh torn and blood flowing, crying out to Heaven.

Before long, the clouds parted and the moon reappeared, the stars once again filling the sky. Li Si, though struck by some hail, did not stumble and suffered no great harm. Only Zhang San was dazed and dizzy from his falls, sticking out his tongue and shaking his head, saying, “Unbelievable! Unbelievable! This crazy hag must not be offended!” Li Si said, “Now you know she must not be offended. Let’s see if you come back again!” The two spoke as they walked, each going home separately.

Li Si recounted this episode to the other ruffians and scoundrels. One told ten, ten told a hundred, and so those who were unruly and the beggars no longer dared approach the broken tile kiln. Sun Bu’er remained in Luoyang for twelve years, cultivating and awakening to the Dao, never troubled by evil men—all thanks to Li Si’s deed!

Later readers who come upon this tale may sigh with this verse:

> Here the Perfected One attains profound功,  
> How could wild rogues dare to show their might?  
> When hail descends and beats with fierce blows,  
> One knows the Heavenly Lord guards the法.

Master Wang Chongyang stayed at Ma Yuanwai’s house for more than a year without noticing the passing time. Outside, several village elders chatted idly, saying, “Ma Yuanwai knows not how to enjoy blessings, foolishly giving away his family fortune to others. His wife went mad from anger and disappeared, no one knows where she went.” Among them was a man over fifty named Duan Anren, who said, “Yesterday I went to his manor to see Ma Yuanwai. No guards stood at the gate. When I entered, I saw no women, only men. I asked where Yuanwai was, and they said he was in a thatched hut behind, listening to Master Chongyang expound the Dao. I went back and saw many thatched shelters built there. Ma Yuanwai and Wang Chongyang sat in meditation in one of the huts. Yuanwai saw me and came out to accompany me to the front hall. I asked about his wife’s whereabouts. Yuanwai said, ‘She has her own dao, and I have my subtle mysteries.’ I asked why there were no maids or servants. Yuanwai said, ‘The male servants have married, the female servants have wed, each establishing their own households, with no lingering ties.’ I asked what the thatched huts were for. Yuanwai said they gathered cultivators to awaken to the Dao and nurture true nature. I asked why Master Chongyang did not come out. Yuanwai said he loved quiet most of all and did not mingle with common folk.” After finishing my questions, I spoke with Ma Xing. I asked, “Your manor used to be lively; why is it now so cold and quiet, like a temple?” Ma Xing said, “You don’t know. The Master Chongyang who came to our house is a living immortal. He dislikes noise and loves tranquility. Since Lady Sun left, he sent away all the maids and servants, leaving only a few of us old ones to watch over the place. That is why it is so quiet.” I asked how he knew Master Chongyang was a living immortal. Ma Xing replied, “He knows everything about the household and past events without anyone telling him. That is not strange. He also knows future things—when it will be sunny or rainy—how could he not be a living immortal?”

Duan Anren finished telling the story of Ma Family Village. Among the village elders was an old man surnamed Pan, who said, “If what you say is true, and he knows past and future, we have suffered drought for a long time without rain. Why not ask him when the rain will come?” The elders all agreed and went with Old Pan to Ma Family Village. They first saw Ma Yuanwai and explained their purpose. Ma Danyang then led the elders to the thatched hut to ask Master Chongyang when it would rain. The Master said, “At the Earth God’s temple on the east side of your village, the wall records the rain schedule. Go and see for yourselves.” The elders heard this and left the manor. Returning to their village, they went to the Earth God’s temple on the east side. Before the temple, on the whitewashed wall, were several lines of writing. Old Pan read aloud to the others:

> Before the King of Men a pair of melons,  
> One pearl shines upon the royal house,  
> On the twenty-third day great rain falls,  
> The monk’s mouth spits out mud.

Below were a few small characters: “broken.” Old Pan laughed and said, “These are riddles written here by schoolchildren. What rain schedule is this?” The elders said, “What kind of riddle is this? Can you guess it?” Old Pan said, “I am used to riddles. How could I not guess?” The elders said, “If you can guess, do so for us.” Old Pan said, “The King of Men with added raindrops is the character for gold (金). The ‘king’ character with a dot is the jade palace (玉宇). The twenty-third day with rain together forms the character for ‘full’ (滿). The monk drops the ‘he’ (和) and keeps ‘shang’ (尚), which means earth or soil. Adding ‘shang’ on top of earth forms the character ‘hall’ (堂). Altogether it reads ‘gold and jade fill the hall’ (金玉滿堂). There is no rain schedule here.” Duan Anren stepped forward and pointed to the line “twenty-third day great rain falls,” saying, “This is clearly the rain schedule. You say there is none, but though these are riddles, there is hidden meaning. Today is the nineteenth; in four days, the twenty-third day will come. We shall see if it rains or not, and then know if he is truly efficacious.” The elders all agreed and returned home.

On the twenty-third day, black clouds filled the sky, and heavy rain poured from dawn until noon, then ceased. The villagers believed in Master Chongyang’s divine power. Another man from the northern village lost a cow and could not find it anywhere, so he came to ask the Master. Master Chongyang said, “The cow is in a crow’s nest atop a tall tree in the southern village.” The man laughed, saying, “Such a big cow—how can it fit in a tiny crow’s nest?” The Master said, “Go and you will find the cow; no need for more words.” The man left the hut and went to the southern village. There he saw a tall tree with a bird’s nest. The villagers knew how to climb trees, so he climbed up and took the nest. It was empty. When he pulled a dry branch, it fell and struck his face. Looking down, he saw a broken house with a cow tied inside. Upon closer inspection, it was the lost cow. The cow lay inside the broken house, surrounded by stacked firewood and brush, hidden from view unless seen from above. The man understood that a thief was at work in the village, and if not for the Master’s guidance, the cow would have been taken far away and sold, never to be found. The man led the cow back home.

Leaving that matter aside, on that day several people from the western village came with questions. Among them was a boy of thirteen or fourteen who said his elder brother had been away for months and he did not know when he would return. He came to ask the old Master. Master Chongyang said, “Go ask your mother’s hand.” The boy laughed heartily. Later, at home, he saw his mother holding a letter. She said, “Your brother is doing business in Laizhou and sent this letter back. The messenger has just left. You may open and read it to me.” The boy opened the letter and read aloud:

> An unworthy son respectfully writes to his kind mother:  
> Since father’s passing, I have been raised by you.  
> Now fulfilling father’s will, I trade afar,  
> Things go well, though accounts remain unsettled.  
> I cannot return quickly to comfort your heart.  
> When autumn cools, around mid-September, I shall come home,  
> To serve you with sweet delicacies.

Before finishing, the boy clapped his hands and laughed, saying, “So true! So true!” His mother was about to ask him more when five or six people arrived at the door. What could this mean? Let us see what unfolds next.
