# Chapter Twelve: Clarifying the Subtle Principle of the Finger-Sitting Practice — Rejoicing to Meet the Enlightened Master in Pursuit of the True Dao

Love and attachment entangle, impossible to untie;  
One day the body departs, no longer together.  

Now I let go without clinging or delay,  
Straight to the Jade Pool, ascending the steps of jade.

Now, the tale turns to the child of West Village, who was just about to recount to his mother the words Master Chongyang had taught him. Suddenly, five or six people appeared outside the gate, asking for the way to Ma Family Village. The child said, “You ask for Ma Family Village—are you perhaps going to meet a living immortal?” The visitors answered, “Indeed we are.” Hearing they sought the living immortal, the child’s joy was boundless. “It’s not far,” he said, “I will lead you there.” With that, he went forward. The group followed him, leaving West Village behind, and before long arrived at Ma Family Village.

By fate’s design, just then Ma Yuanwai sat in front of the hall. Seeing them enter, he rose to welcome them inside and invited them to sit. He asked, “What brings you all to our humble village?” The visitors replied they had come seeking the dao. Ma Danyang, hearing this, immediately led them to the thatched hermitage to pay respects to the Master.

Among them was a man surnamed Tan, named Chuduan, styled Changzhenzi. In former years, he had suffered a lingering illness. When Wang Chongyang first came to Shandong, he had taught him the method to dispel his sickness. Once healed, Tan devoted himself wholeheartedly to the dao, searching far and wide for the Master, but found no trace. Now, hearing that Ma Family Village had a living immortal named Wang Chongyang, he knew the Master was here. He had also invited a fellow seeker, surnamed Hao, named Datong, styled Taigu, a native of Wendeng County in this prefecture. The others were likewise persons devoted to the Way, their names need not be further mentioned.

Tan Changzhen expressed gratitude to the Master for curing his illness in past years, then began to explain the purpose of their visit to study the dao. Master Chongyang said, “The dharma gate is wide open: those who leave, leave; those who come, come. Those who go are not detained; those who come are not refused.” He then ordered Ma Danyang to escort them to the second hermitage to settle in.

Several days later, two more practitioners arrived—one surnamed Liu, named Chuxuan, styled Changshengzi; the other surnamed Wang, named Chu Yi, styled Yuyangzi, both natives of Shandong. Ma Danyang received them, inquired after their purpose, and learning they also sought the dao, led them to pay respects to the Master. Master Chongyang assigned them lodging in the third hermitage.

Thus, one came from the east, another from the west; within less than a month, dozens had arrived. Master Chongyang instructed Ma Danyang to organize them, assigning each to oversee a sect, all with rules not to be violated. When all was settled, the Master lectured on the sitting practice. The disciples formed two groups in order, bowing respectfully to listen.

Master Chongyang said, “The human body is founded on qi, rooted in the heart, with nature as its curtain. Heaven and Earth are separated by eighty-four thousand li; the human heart and kidney are eight cun and four fen apart. The kidney here means the inner kidney, three cun and three fen below the navel! This is precisely where a single channel runs to connect breath. Floating and sinking breaths govern all the vessels: one exhale opens all the vessels; one inhale closes them all. The workings of Heaven and Earth’s creation and transformation revolve around these two words—breath.

When a person breathes between heart and kidney, blood and qi flow smoothly, primordial qi consolidates, the seven emotions do not run wild, and a hundred ailments vanish without treatment.

The method of sitting: at the hours of Zi, Wu, Mao, and You, in a quiet room lay a thick mat. Sit cross-legged upon it, eyes half-closed fixed on the navel. Plug ears with cotton, let the mind cease all thoughts and worries, and let intention follow breath—one going, one coming, up and down with the breath—neither slow nor fast, letting it be natural.

Sit through one incense stick’s burning, feeling the breath at mouth and nose grow less coarse, gradually softening and thinning. After another incense stick, feel the breath at mouth and nose as if present yet absent. Then slowly stretch legs and open eyes, remove earplugs, rise and walk a few steps, then lie down on one side. After a moment, rise again and drink half a bowl of gruel. Do not indulge in pride; never let anger arise, lest it damage your work and harm your true qi.”

“The merit of sitting practice does not lie in quantity, but depends entirely on dispelling demonic qi and banishing devils. First, remove all obstacles at once; do not let nets form in the mind. If obstacles remain, vexations gather; if nets are not untied, how can one escape the Saha world? Clearly, the ultimate principle is passed down—never fall into stagnation and self-imposed illness.”

After Master Chongyang finished lecturing on the sitting practice, he rose to rest. The disciples returned to their quarters, and the story leaves them for now.

Meanwhile, in Dou Village, Qixia County, Dengzhou Prefecture of Shandong, lived a man surnamed Qiu, named Chuji, styled Qifa. He had two brothers: the eldest named Qiming, the second brother’s wife named Xiao Xing. Their parents died early, and Qiu Qifa was cared for by his elder brother and sister-in-law, allowing him to grow to adulthood. He had studied books for several years and could compose poetry, lyrics, and essays, but had no interest in fame or rank. He loved quietude, often sitting alone all day without speaking, as if he had found some secret delight. His brother and sister-in-law often urged him to study for officialdom, but he replied that reading was for investigating principle, not for seeking fame. When they tried to arrange a marriage for him, he firmly refused, saying, “A man who has not established himself should not be bound by marriage.” Hearing his uncommon words, they dared not press him further and let him be.

Qiu Qifa once said to others, “Life in this world is bitter; if one does not seek a way out, one will spend days contending for fame and profit, greedy for wife and child. When impermanence arrives, all becomes empty. People take worldly affairs as true, but to me they are like floating clouds, morning dew, dreams, illusions, bubbles, and shadows.”

One day, he heard people say that in Ninghai County, Ma Family Village had a Master Wang Chongyang, widely virtuous and a great practitioner. Several from Qixia County were studying the dao there. Qiu Qifa, who loved the dao all his life, resolved to go study it. Without telling his brother and sister-in-law—fearing they would forbid him—he quietly packed some travel money and a few changes of clothes, and secretly left home, heading toward Ninghai County.

In less than a day, he arrived at Ma Family Village. That day Ma Danyang was on duty. He asked Qiu Qifa’s purpose and recorded his name. Hearing that Tan, Liu, Wang, Hao, and others had all come seeking the dao, they rejoiced. “Such a young man sincerely seeking the dao is rare indeed.” Saying this, Ma Danyang led him to pay respects to Master Chongyang.

Ma Danyang conveyed Qiu Qifa’s wish to study the dao. The Master looked him over and shook his head. “This man’s mind is too busy, too clever; he cannot learn the dao. Better for him to return early and not deceive himself.” Qiu Qifa knelt and said, “I wholeheartedly seek the dao with no other intention. I earnestly hope the Master will accept me.” Ma Danyang pleaded on his behalf, but the Master refused. “It is not that I do not accept him; this man’s roots of suffering are deep. I fear he cannot endure the hardships ahead and will surely falter. It is better not to accept him.” Qiu Qifa tried to plead again, but the Master left the hermitage to admire flowers. Ma Danyang and others were at a loss.

They had no choice but to lodge Qiu Qifa in the front hall and set him to sweeping. Secretly, they passed on some sitting practice to him. One day Qiu Qifa said to Ma Danyang, “Since the Master will not accept me, why not let me take you as my teacher?” Ma Danyang replied, “No, no! When seeking a teacher, one must seek a great man; when taking a master, one must take an enlightened master. I only know a little of the initial work. As for the great dao, I have not heard it. You should stay at ease and I will slowly guide you.” Hearing this, Qiu Qifa was greatly pleased and served diligently morning and evening, responding promptly to every call.

After a few days, he became familiar with everyone and was liked by all. One day, following the senior brothers to the hermitage, he saw Master Chongyang sitting in the center, disciples standing respectfully on both sides, listening attentively.

Master Chongyang said, “Since I came here, I have compassion for the world, speaking bitter words to transform people, intending to lead all to the path of awakening, to help all escape the maze of delusion. Yet I too am but a man—born loving the dao, foolish and dull in youth, strange in adulthood, and in strength, communicating with spirits. Those who find me strange in this world all see me as different! But how could I wish to be different? I am but dull, common, and foolish!

I am not proud nor jealous; I do not imagine nor act rashly—dull! I do not know schemes nor cleverness; I am foolish! I do not speak oddly nor fall into worldly dust; I am common! People call me dull, laugh at my foolishness, blame my commonness. I pity their extreme dullness, foolishness, and commonness, yet they do not awaken. I use the path of utmost dullness, foolishness, and commonness to awaken the world. If you cannot understand, then you do not understand.

Therefore, those who cultivate the dao must begin by refining the heart. Refining before it arises is precious; refining after it arises is even more so. The wandering mind, the restless heart, all the杂念 (miscellaneous thoughts) are the heart already arisen. To make it utterly still and unmoving, one must guard the heart, fix the heart, and gather the heart.

Guarding the heart means keeping it before it moves; fixing the heart means fixing it when it must move; gathering the heart means collecting it after it has moved. Gathering is not easy; first one must gather as it arises. The faster the gathering, the firmer the guarding; the firmer the guarding, the longer the fixing. This is the subtlety of heart cultivation in our dao school! The heart must be made empty, without a single thing.

The heart is formed from the true yang of primordial qi; thus the heart belongs to fire, not pure yang without yin. Within yang is true yin; thus the small form has three numbers covering below, and below is a waning moon supporting above. It shows yang cannot grow without yin, yin cannot be born without yang. True yin comes from true yang; hence it is called heart.

Therefore, if a single false thought moves, the heart immediately loses a portion of true qi. When a matter enters the heart, it adds a kind of demonic obstruction. When the heart moves, it is no longer called small; this is called ‘念’ (nian—thought). The character ‘念’ shows a person has two hearts. When a person has two hearts, they cannot be focused; thus a hundred affairs fail, and the dao is even further away.”

Master Chongyang continued, “The heart is the master of the body, one and only one. If two hearts arise, that is called thought! This first sprout gives birth to many false matters, and the heart cannot rule, causing the body to fall into sinking and drowning. Alas! Hard to escape!”

As he spoke, Qiu Qifa listened joyfully among the crowd, repeatedly exclaiming, “Wonderful!” The Master shot him a sharp glance and stopped speaking. The disciples all came out, complaining that he should not have spoken aloud, causing the Master to halt the lecture. Qiu Qifa pretended not to hear, letting them grumble a while, secretly pondering the Master’s words on refining the heart—indeed the secret of refining the dao! Without first refining the heart, even the wondrous dao cannot be forged.

Thus, every day he examined his heart, checking for faults or no faults, mistakes or none. Whenever he saw the senior brothers absent from the front hall, he would slip behind to listen to the Master’s teachings, though what he heard remained unknown.

To be continued.

In the world, there is originally no difficulty—only fear that the world lacks those with heart.
