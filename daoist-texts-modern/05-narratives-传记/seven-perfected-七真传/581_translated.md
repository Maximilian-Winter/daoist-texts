# Chapter Thirteen: Dispersing the Altar, the Seeker Returns Home — Changing Daoist Robes, Master and Disciple Journey Southward

Musing on the folly of mortals who fail to grasp emptiness,  
Lost in flowers and wine, flaunting their heroism.  

Spring nights leak away, joy hastened by the passing hours,  
Years stretch long, yet death’s limit presses close.  

Craftiness is like a cat chasing mice,  
Time flies swift as arrows loosed from bows.  

Unaware, one drains the spirit dry,  
Willing to bury this body deep in the earth.

It is told that Qiu Qifa found his senior Daoist brothers absent from the front hall; surely they were in the back, listening to the Master expound the dao. So he went to the thatched hermitage and indeed saw the Master seated, delivering the dharma. The disciples stood in order on either side; Qiu did not enter inside but stood outside the door, cleansing his ears and listening in quiet attentiveness.

Only the Master’s voice was heard: “In cultivation, the mind’s thoughts are subtle within subtle. The moment a selfish thought arises, even a tiny speck of dross lodges in the heart. The moment desire stirs, a great demon barrier stands within. For once selfish desire arises, the primordial is lost. One must cast away selfish desire to preserve the primordial. The primordial is the one qi; when selfish desire rises, fire stirs; when fire stirs, the qi scatters. Once the qi scatters, how can there be primordial? How then to discern the right moment for the fire? When selfishness is heavy, the qi is exhausted; how then to restore spiritual mechanism? When desire is intense, the qi withers; how then to attain the profound mystery? Such is the mechanism: should selfish thoughts be removed or not? Should desires be removed or not? Should false thoughts be removed or not? Those with selfish thoughts, heed my words and beware! Those with desires, beware! Those with false thoughts, beware! Above all, one must nurture the heart to stillness and immobility; then thoughts can be extinguished. When thoughts vanish, selfishness ends; when selfishness ends, desire is purified; when desire is pure, yang is refined and yin dissipates. True immortals and great Buddhas all come from this place, all begin by addressing the thoughts. Do not regard this as mere talk.”

Master Chongyang was just reaching the subtle essence when Qiu Qifa, forgetting himself, involuntarily uttered a voice of approval. The Master turned to the disciples and said, “The dharma is spoken within the gate, yet one outside listens—tell me, who is the true friend of understanding?” Having spoken, Ma Danyang looked outside and saw it was Qiu Qifa, then called him in. The Master, upon seeing him, angrily said to Ma Danyang, “I instructed you to send him away; why is he still here?” Before he finished speaking, Liu Changsheng, Hao Taigu, Wang Yuyang, and Tan Changzhen all stepped forward to say, “Since Qiu Qifa has come to bow and seek the dao, we hope the Master will take pity and accept him as disciple, to teach and instruct him morning and evening.” Master Chongyang said, “It is not that I refuse to accept him, but I fear his heart is not sincere. Should he encounter hardship even once, he will surely regret it and turn back. Then the dao cannot be cultivated, and he will only bring trouble. It is better not to accept him.” Liu Changsheng and the others pleaded earnestly, and Qiu Qifa knelt on the ground and would not rise. Master Chongyang said, “Since you have recommended him repeatedly, do you think I can refuse? Seeing how you care for him, I will accept him and give him a dao name: Changchun.” Qiu Qifa immediately rose, performed three kneelings and nine kowtows, bowed to the Master, and then saluted the others. The Master descended from his seat and all returned to their places.

More than a month later, the Master instructed Ma Danyang to gather all the Daoist brothers into the inner hall. This time, the dharma talk must be held on an altar set outside the hermitage. Ma Danyang took the Master’s words and prepared everything. Soon the assembly gathered, splendidly robed and dignified, all coming to the front of the hermitage to invite the Master to ascend the seat and speak the dharma. Master Chongyang emerged from the thatched hut, took his seat, sat with solemn composure for a long while, then said:

“My teaching centers on stillness. The character ‘still’ can be contemplated above as nurturing transformation, below as embracing all phenomena. I now explain this character ‘still’ to you all. It is not only useful for cultivation and awakening to the dao, but indispensable for harmonizing family and governing the state! The one character ‘still’ holds infinite subtle principle. Many speak of stillness, but few truly know it. Thus, many desire stillness but cannot attain it—they have yet to find the root of stillness. The root of stillness first requires seeing the empty world; the gate of stillness demands cutting off effort from the restless place; the end of stillness is rich in constant use. Guard the subtle method: once a thought arises, immediately extinguish it; extinguished, it arises again—do not allow it to arise; if it arises, extinguish it again, so that it may be extinguished forever. At stillness’s extreme, what is not still becomes still. One neither speaks of stillness nor unrest. The highest good is none other than stillness. At stillness, the great mountain crumbles yet is unshaken. Not because it is unshaken, but because before crumbling it is as if not crumbling. Before a beautiful woman, one remains unmoved—not because of willful stillness, but as if she were not there. As for movement and action, dealing with people and things, the power of calmness naturally manifests without conscious knowing: parents see stubbornness and respond with kindness; siblings see harshness and respond with harmony; spouses see fierceness and respond with compliance; friends see falsehood and respond with sincerity; common folk see roughness and respond with refinement; scholars see recklessness and respond with restraint. Thus, loyalty to the lord is loyalty by nature; thus, love for the people is true love, not indulgent worry. What way is there not to follow, what ambition not to pursue! This is not strange, yet the marvel cannot be spoken. Not only stillness within stillness, but stillness within movement—when both move and rest are still, the dao can be accomplished. The Buddha said, ‘To illuminate the mind and see the nature’—without stillness, how can one illuminate and see? The Confucian says, ‘To exhaust principle and fulfill nature’—without stillness, how can one exhaust and fulfill? The Daoists say, ‘To cultivate truth and nurture nature’—without stillness, how can one cultivate and nurture? Stillness is the lifeblood of the three teachings, not only here. Consider: daytime is not possible without the stillness of night as its root; the four seasons would not move without the stillness of winter as their root. The dao is rooted in stillness, the principle of nature. The dao is natural; without stillness, how can one enter the gate?”

Master Chongyang said the character ‘still’ is the practice inseparable from the three teachings. Scholars, farmers, artisans, merchants, kings, nobles, generals, and ministers—all must first find stillness to be at ease, then ease to deliberate, then deliberation to attain. When parents are still, children naturally become filial; when rulers are still, ministers naturally become loyal; when siblings are still, harmony arises; when friends are still, trust is born; when spouses are still, obedience follows. The Master spoke this character ‘still’ to the disciples, knowing well that among the dozens present, only six—Qiu, Liu, Wang, Tan, Ma, and Hao—would truly focus on understanding the dao. The others were all those who start with zeal but end in slackness, who begin but never finish, not true practitioners. Later, they would surely fall into contention for fame and gain. Thus, the Master taught them the practice of calmness to soften their harshness and cultivate their refinement. Though not transcending the mundane or entering sagehood, they could cultivate themselves and harmonize their families, remaining good people—not wasting their coming to bow and seek here.

Meanwhile, Qiu Changchun, hearing the Master speak of stillness so naturally and thoroughly, perceiving its many benefits, felt his heart soften and his limbs dance with joy—yet the Master watched him and angrily pointed at him, saying, “You hear the dao but do not advance; you understand reason but fail to awaken. You merely flaunt your cleverness and wit, unable to conceal or endure, only knowing how to twist and turn cunningly. You are not a vessel for the dao! I have spoken many times, yet you transgress the rules. Now I shall avoid you in the southeast, lest you constantly disturb me.” Then he said to Ma Danyang, “Tomorrow I shall journey southward to seek the dao. Only Liu Changsheng, Tan Changzhen, Hao Taigu, and Wang Yuyang shall accompany me; you may send them home. The others may come or go as they please. I shall be gone at least half a year, at most a full year, before returning.”

These words stirred homesickness among the disciples. Some wished to return to see parents, others to care for children. They packed their bundles and luggage overnight, waiting for dawn to bid farewell to Ma Danyang and to convey their respects to the Master. Ma Danyang could not but escort them out of the village; all clasped hands in farewell. Ma Danyang returned to the hermitage, where Master Chongyang instructed him to take out five sleeves of robes, five mats, the daoist hat, the straw hat, the rush shoes, the grass sandals, the rock-drift sandals, the shovel, and all other items. The Master and Liu, Hao, Wang, and Tan changed into Daoist robes and attire. Taking advantage of the still-dark sky, they quietly left Ma’s village. Ma Danyang escorted them beyond the village, then turned back. Just then, Qiu Changchun bowed in farewell. Ma Danyang asked where he was going. Qiu Changchun said, “I will follow the Master.” Ma Danyang said, “The Master cannot bear to see you; that is why he left. If you go now, you will surely suffer.” Qiu Changchun replied, “The Master does not truly dislike me; he only wishes me to learn well. If I do not go, would I not betray his good intentions?” Saying this, he set off. Ma Danyang called after him, “Come back quickly, I have something to tell you.” But what that was, none knew. Let us see in the next volume how it unfolds.

Each went their own way in private; Changchun, longing for the Master, hastened to follow.
