# Chapter Fourteen: Testing the Mundane Heart with Repeated Rebukes, Always Upholding the Teacher’s Will and Taking Refuge

To cast off evil is like untying tangled threads; the numinous heart itself has its moment to unravel.

If one misapplies even a little effort, countless kalpas and endless rebirths will find no end.

The story goes that Ma Danyang called Qiu Changchun back and said, “Master, all the elder brothers have changed their dao and are ready to journey afar. But you still wear the garb of the mundane world—how can you go like this? I have a dao robe and a dao hat; put them on, and then you may depart!” Hearing this, Qiu Changchun was overjoyed. At once, he donned the robe, placed the dao hat upon his head, and took up Ma Danyang’s straw mat and his own gourd to follow after the master.

After walking for a while, they saw from afar Tan, Hao, and others walking slowly behind the master. Changchun noticed some villagers eating breakfast and thought to himself: “We left early and have not eaten. Perhaps I should beg some alms food to offer the master.” Having never begged for alms before and not knowing the proper method, he braved standing at someone’s door with his gourd in hand. Just then, a yellow dog barked sharply, and a person came out to look. Seeing Changchun, they turned and went back inside, soon returning with a full bowl of millet porridge, which they poured into his gourd. Changchun was overjoyed and did the same at two more houses. His gourd was now full; he cupped it with both hands and hurried to catch up with the master.

Meanwhile, Master Chongyang had walked for some time and rested beneath a great tree. He asked Liu, Hao, and the others if they had brought any travel funds. Liu Changsheng replied, “Because you left so hastily, we were busy chasing after you and did not ask Brother Ma for any money.” The master said, “Since you have no funds, each of you should go beg some alms food. I will wait here.” Hearing this, the four each took their gourds to beg food.

Master Chongyang sat alone beneath the tree. Suddenly, Qiu Changchun appeared, holding a gourd full of food to offer. The master angrily said, “Who told you to disturb me? I cannot accept your offering!” Changchun pleaded repeatedly, but the master paid no heed. Soon after, Liu and Hao each returned with some alms food to offer the master. The master ate a little of Liu Changsheng’s offering and then refused the rest. Having all eaten their fill, they rose together and traveled more than ten li. As evening fell, they came upon a cold, deserted temple and entered. They cleaned it, laid out their straw mats, and sat in meditation through the night.

The next day, the master and disciples continued on. Qiu Changchun, walking behind, begged for alms along the way. A kind family invited him to eat. Changchun said, “I have my master ahead; since he has not yet eaten, how dare I accept?” The kind family replied, “That is no matter. You eat now, and we will prepare some clean alms food for you to carry in your gourd to offer him later. It will not be too late.” Seeing the reason in their words, Changchun sat down and ate his fill. Then, thanking the family, he found his gourd full of food. Holding it with both hands, he hurried forward. Seeing the master not far ahead, he called out, “Master, walk slowly! Your disciple has brought food.” Master Chongyang feigned not to hear and kept walking. Changchun quickened his pace to catch up, holding out the food. The master glanced at it and said, “This is the food of one household. I have no merit to accept it. How could I ask for a gourd full of food from a thousand households while wandering alone for ten thousand li?” Hearing this, Changchun was silent and watched the master walk on. He thought, “If I return the food to that kind family, the back-and-forth will delay our journey. If I eat it, my belly will be full. What can I do?” Helpless, he dragged his gourd along, his hands aching and numb, sweat streaming down his body. Ahead, the elder brothers and the master sat on a stone to eat their alms. Fortunately, their offerings were scant, so Changchun presented his gourd of food to them. Each took a little before the food was finished. That night they lodged again in the old temple. Changchun thought to himself, “My master is from Shaanxi and dislikes rice; he prefers steamed bread. Tomorrow I will beg some steamed buns to offer him.”

That night, his resolve was firm. The next day, he indeed begged several white steamed buns to honor the master. Master Chongyang angrily said, “I told you not to eat my food. Why do you trouble me so?” Saying this, he snatched the gourd and hurled it to the ground, nearly breaking it. The steamed buns rolled off the edge. Qiu Changchun hurried to pick up the gourd, placed the buns inside, and saw the master had already gone far ahead. He followed after him.

Dear reader, you may wonder why Master Chongyang treated Changchun so harshly. It is because Changchun had begun the dao in youth, unlike Liu, Hao, Wang, and Tan, who had already transformed their qi. Without deep and repeated refinement, how could he become a vessel? As the saying goes, “To polish his nature,” and yet Changchun’s foundation was deep and firm. Though repeatedly rebuked, he bore no resentment.

Master Wang Chongyang and his disciples journeyed for more than two months. At that time, the heavenly dao grew cold. They gathered some bundles of firewood in the countryside. That night, heavy rain and snow fell, and the cold was severe. They took some firewood to kindle a fire for warmth. Seeing this, Master Chongyang was displeased. He threw all the bundles into the fire at once. Flames leapt high, sparks flew wildly. The master took the shovel and pressed down the wood several times. The flames instantly died, thick smoke billowed, choking them with no way out. The temple was narrow, and the wind blew the smoke inside. Qiu, Liu, and the others could not bear it and had to step outside the mountain gate to escape the smoke. One by one, they rubbed their brows and eyes, all exclaiming, “What fine smoke! What fine smoke!” Seeing them go out, the master closed the gate, moved his straw mat to the door, and sat blocking the entrance.

They stood outside a while until the smoke cleared, but the cold returned. They turned to push the door, but it would not budge. They dared not call out and sat under the eaves, shivering. Liu Changsheng said, “Master has taught us the fire work. Why don’t we all do it to dispel this severe cold?”

Changchun and the fellow Daoists began their practice. They closed their breath, gathered qi, and moved it about. Before long, not only did they feel no cold, but warmth arose within. Soon the sky brightened, and the mountain gate opened. They entered and saw the master sitting on his straw mat, still angry and silent. He said to them, “You fear heat and dread toil, clinging to life and fearing death. You abandon the true for the false, craving the warmth of a fake fire but refusing to move the true fire within. Seeking comfort without deep effort—such laziness, how can you attain the dao? If I do not rebuke you severely, you will begin diligent and end idle. Enough!” Then he ordered Wang Yuyang to bring the disciplinary rod and struck each of them twenty times as a warning for the future.

Liu, Hao, and the others turned pale and dared not reply. Qiu Changchun knelt before the master and said, “It is my fault alone, not the elder brothers’. I am willing to bear the punishment. I beg the master to pardon them.” The master said, “If you are willing to take their punishment, twenty strokes each, that makes a hundred in total.” Liu and Hao pleaded for mercy. The master sighed, “If you all pardon each other, how could I refuse? But next time, do not be so careless, lest you ruin your future.” He then threw down the rod and said to Liu Changsheng, “You suddenly resolved to journey south, and now that the excitement has passed, you still wish to return north. Set out at once without delay.”

Having spoken, he walked out. Qiu, Liu, and the others hurriedly rolled up their straw mats, took their shovels, and bid farewell to the old man tending the incense. They followed the old path back to Shandong. Soon they arrived at Ninghai County, at Majiazhuang.

Qiu Changchun first went to inform Ma Danyang. Danyang hurried out to welcome the master inside. They stayed in the thatched hut behind, living quietly without incident, no need for further words. After more than a month, the disciples heard the master had returned. One by one, they came to study the dao again, and the place grew lively once more. The master devised a subtle method to disperse them. How he sent them away remains to be told. Wait for the next chapter to unfold.
