# Chapter Fifteen: Revealing Master Yuhua’s Retirement and Escorting the Spirit Coffin—Disciple Service and Toil

Where the wind stirs the banner, that is not the true;  
Original nature, perfectly bright, is the dharma body.  
Understanding the subtle meaning of plucking a flower and smiling,  
One finds nowhere to place even a speck of dust thereafter.

It is told that Master Chongyang, upon seeing those who studied the dao still gathered together, observed that among them there was not a single person truly sincere toward the dao. They merely clung to empty fame, using the dao as a pretext, hoping others would know they practiced cultivation and enlightenment, yet in truth, they had not a trace of dao-mindedness. He bitterly wished they would disperse, for falsehoods confuse the genuine, and the dharma gate cannot remain pure and tranquil. 

He conceived a wondrous method. Nodding once, he suddenly cried out several times, “No, no!” Startled, the crowd rushed to his side. The master said, “I should not have gone out. On the road, I was struck by the damp heat, causing my heart to knot with gloom and my body to break out in blisters.” 

He loosened his robe for all to see. Indeed, his chest was swollen, his entire body covered with blisters. Alarmed, Ma Danyang and disciples Qiu and Liu hurried to seek doctors and remedies. They summoned several renowned physicians in succession, administered wondrous medicines several times, yet none brought relief. 

After two days, the blisters burst and festered, pus flowing freely, the stench unbearable. Those who studied the dao whispered behind his back, “Master Chongyang surely lacks the dao. If he cannot even preserve his own body, how can he transcend? If he cannot cure his illness, how can he become an immortal? Let us each return home, lest we delay great matters.” 

Thus, one by one, the yin left, one by one, the yang departed. Within two days, they had all gone, leaving only Qiu, Liu, Tan, Ma, Hao, and Wang—six in all—who served him day and night. 

Seeing all had left, the master summoned the six close and instructed: “I shall die tomorrow at noon. But before I came here, I took Ma Yu’s share of silver coins, which I have used to aid the poor, assist others in burial and marriage rites, and to send off maids and servants, fulfilling all the bride-price and family offerings, spending a considerable sum. I also supported those who came to study the dao for one or two years, thus the silver is all spent. Now the treasury is empty. After my death, if a funeral is held, fields and lands must be sold. But heed my instructions: no silver or money is to be spent. When I die, there shall be no mourning or weeping, no memorial rites or wakes. Only a few thin boards to hold this foul skin. Let Qiu, Liu, Wang, Tan, and Hao take turns carrying me back to beneath Zhongnan Mountain in Shaanxi. Where the rope breaks shall be my burial place. Do not err. Should you disobey my words, I shall not rest in peace.” 

Qiu, Liu, and the others heard the master’s words and wept bitterly. Master Chongyang said, “Do not act like children!” Though he spoke thus, Qiu, Liu, and the rest could not help but feel sorrow and grief.

At noon the next day, the master dressed in full ceremonial robes, seated upright on his mat, and called the six close disciples near. He spoke: “The method of cultivating life and nature together requires both internal and external completeness. Without external work, virtue is incomplete; without internal work, the source is unclear. External work means in daily life, the mind must be without fault. Every word must be cautious—words are merit. Every deed must be careful—deeds are merit. No matter the matter, be exacting; every detail must be strict. All this is where merit accumulates and advances. 

What then is internal work? To be vigilant and not fall into confusion; guard the mind as one guards a fortress. Empty the mind of all things; guarding the heart is stricter than guarding the body. At times, Heaven and man meet on a razor’s edge—this is the battle between Heaven and man. I shall emphasize internal work: it cannot be seen with the eyes, cannot be sought with the gaze, cannot be trusted to luck, cannot be taken lightly. Sweep away every trace of color and form, and there remains a single spark of yang. Sweep away all baseless appearances, and boundless yang arises. By sweeping away the poison of appearances, leaving no grudges, one attains the pure yang body. 

There are those who cultivate the dao who do not lack firm faith, but their flaw is haste; before the work is complete, they seek to verify the fruit. Others practice a hundred times over, not without care, but their flaw is leisure—day by day they dawdle, sleepy and dull, spirits flagging, struggling to carry on, unwilling to exert effort. Do they not know that mastery of a skill requires endless ingenuity, until it flows naturally and effortlessly? Half a thread, half a strand, expending great effort to satisfy the heart. If one would become a perfected immortal, must one not toil hard?” 

When Master Chongyang finished speaking, he took out a book titled *Tao Guang Ji*—the Collection of Concealed Radiance—which he had personally authored. It contained the way of hidden traces and the marvels of seclusion. He entrusted it to Ma Danyang, saying: “You six must explore the profound principles within. Knowing is not difficult; doing is. You must strive diligently and not fail my heart. Your junior fellow Daoist, Dao You, is nearing fruition; do not worry. Only Qiu Changchun’s merit is still slight; you should instruct him a little. Liu Changsheng’s appearances have not yet completely emptied; there are still waves within. Hao Taigu wanders east and west; the places he has seen are the lands of enlightenment. Tan Changzhen meets and communicates with the mysterious. Wang Yuyang encounters Yao and enters the marvelous. Qiu Changchun, by the Stone Fan Stream, has exhausted bitter roots; at the Dragon Flying Gate, the Great Elixir is complete.” 

Having spoken, Master Chongyang smiled and passed away.

Qiu, Liu, and the others carefully followed the master’s last instructions, not daring to make a sound. They prepared the body for burial according to the method, binding the coffin firmly with ropes. They found a carrying pole and two crossbars. The next morning, Qiu, Wang, Tan, and Hao lifted the spirit coffin and set out. Liu Changsheng carried the luggage behind. Ma Danyang escorted them for more than twenty li. At parting, he took from his side a pouch of scattered silver, about forty or fifty taels, and handed it to Liu Changsheng: “The household silver was all spent by the master’s good works. We could not prepare more in time. Here is some loose silver to cover expenses; it will suffice for the journey. After the burial, hurry back. Our fellow Daoists cultivate together in one place.” 

Liu Changsheng accepted the silver and parted from Danyang. After a few li, many people appeared on the road holding incense and paper offerings, blocking their path to pay respects. Liu Changsheng approached and saw they were all false practitioners who had studied under the master. He gave thanks. Unknown to them, Master Chongyang in life could not bear false cultivators. Now that he had passed, his true spirit was not clouded; seeing them still committing evil, a foul stench arose from the coffin, so rank that all covered their noses and retched, unable to stand. They made hasty kowtows and fled. The stench then ceased. 

Qiu Changchun and Hao Taigu continued carrying the coffin westward. After no more than ten li, someone stopped them with food. Qiu and Liu thought these were acquaintances of the master who, hearing of his passing, had come to offer a meal out of kindness. They quickly set down the coffin and ate, then gave thanks and lifted it again. After some time, they came upon an ancient temple by the roadside and could carry no further. They laid down the coffin and rested there overnight. At dawn, they lifted again. At breakfast and lunch, others stopped to offer food. At night, they rested at cold temples. Thus they traveled for more than a month. 

When they reached the border of Shaanxi, Qiu Changchun pondered the matter. How could such coincidences be? Nearby, they thought these were friends of the master, showing kindness. But now, after traveling so far, people still came to offer food. This was truly extraordinary. As he pondered, it was midday when someone again brought food and invited them to eat. Liu, Hao, Wang, and Tan thanked the giver and took their bowls. Qiu Changchun pulled the food-giver aside and asked, “How did you know we would come here, bringing this meal? What is the reason?” 

The food-giver said, “Since early morning, an old Daoist in yellow robes came to our village, speaking of a transformation. He said he had five disciples carrying a spirit coffin from Shandong, and that our host should provide a meal for guests. Our master is very kind, so he sent me with food.” 

Changchun remembered this well. The next morning at breakfast, feigning stomach pain, he went to the nearby village to ask for a bowl of hot soup. He asked Liu Changsheng to help carry one shoulder; Liu agreed, taking the luggage and shouldering the pole. Qiu Changchun carried the luggage on his back and strode several li ahead. There he saw an old man in yellow Dao robes, resembling the master, going into the village. Qiu hurried forward, grabbed the Dao robe, knelt, and said, “Master, please walk slowly. Your disciple is here to serve.” 

Master Chongyang turned, his face full of anger, and rebuked Changchun: “You wayward disciple, ignorant of Heaven and Earth’s fullness and emptiness, and the way of concealed traces, you foolishly show cleverness and leak immortal secrets. Because of this, you will have to spend three more years refining demon work. You bring this upon yourself.” 

With these words, he transformed into a clear breeze and departed. Changchun, full of remorse, saw the spirit coffin coming and hurried to take up the carrying pole again, handing the luggage to Liu Changsheng. From then on, no one brought food. Had it not been for the scattered silver Ma Danyang gave for expenses, they would surely have starved. 

After another half month, they reached Zhongnan. There the ropes broke, and the coffin fell to the ground. Changchun looked ahead and saw an old man standing outside a village. He went forward and bowed. Before he could speak, the old man asked, “Are you the ones carrying the spirit coffin from Shandong?” 

Qiu Changchun replied, “Indeed. How do you know?” 

The old man said, “Last night I dreamed that Wang Xiaolian had died, and five disciples carried his coffin from Shandong to here, asking me to give a burial place. I thought we were old friends from the provincial examinations, so I agreed. I asked when the burial would be, and he said today at noon. When I woke, I was half in doubt. I came out several times to look and saw you carrying the coffin, just setting it down on my land.” 

Changchun told the old man about the place where the ropes broke, the burial spot the master had designated. The old man rejoiced and went inside to call several villagers, who brought hoes, shovels, and baskets. They moved the coffin and dug a grave, quickly making a large mound. 

Qiu, Liu, and the others thanked the old man and the villagers, who then invited the master’s brothers and friends to the village for a vegetarian meal. Afterward, Qiu and Liu bid farewell to the old man, asked for directions to Dawei Village, and with a bow, departed—whence they went, none knew.

Seeking the dao eastward, the true path is fulfilled;  
Sending the master westward, the great task complete.
