# Chapter Sixteen: The Three Elders of Great Wei Village Recall Past Affairs — A Word at Jin’an Bridge Points the Way from Confusion

A myriad turns of the body like a boat unmoved,  
When wind stirs waves and surges, hard to regain control.  

Grasping firmly the balanced helm by the flowing stream,  
A light sail carries one all the way to the riverbank.

Now it is told that Qiu Changchun, accompanied by his fellow senior disciples, arrived at Great Wei Village in Xianyang. They found the houses ruined, the village desolate. Three elders sat before the gate of a temple. Changchun stepped forward and bowed deeply. Then he inquired about the residence of Wang Xiaolian. An elderly man with white hair and beard spoke, “You ask about Wang Xiaolian’s dwelling—do you have some connection with him?”  

Qiu Changchun replied, “He is our master. He spread the dao in Shandong, then feathered away to immortality. We accompanied his coffin back here, and just yesterday, beneath the southern mountain, we sought land for his burial. Today we wish to return to Shandong, so we come to ask after his family. Are they safe and sound?”  

The elder sighed deeply and said, “Your master was my clan elder brother. I rank third in seniority and am called Wang Sanlao. Since my elder brother left home, Sister-in-law Zhou fell ill from worry and passed away. His son Qiulang went to live with his maternal grandfather and returns only once or twice a year. Now there is no one at his home.”  

Changchun asked again, “How did this village come to such ruin?”  

Wang Sanlao sighed once more, “Since my elder brother departed, no one here took charge. Everyone minded their own affairs. When trouble came, no one stepped forward to manage it. Instead, they meddled in each other’s matters, making things worse and worse, growing poorer and poorer, until the village fell to ruin. Later, when people heard that Xiaolian had become an immortal, they said he had drawn away the village’s fengmai—the vital wind currents—and lightly laid this blame upon himself.”  

Changchun asked, “How do you know he became an immortal?”  

Wang Sanlao pointed to the temple and said, “This temple was built by the northern and southern villages in his honor. You may enter and see for yourselves.”  

Changchun and his fellow disciples entered the temple. Indeed, they saw a statue of their master, lifelike and solemn. They all approached and bowed. Above was a plaque inscribed with the four characters “A Hero Among Men.” On either side, couplets read:  

> “Manifesting the dao arts in Xianyang,  
> Extinguishing fire with a breath of wine;  
> Extending grace and light to his native place,  
> Dispelling plague with talismans.”  

Qiu and Liu, puzzled by these words, asked the three elders how their master had driven away plague and extinguished fire.  

The elders replied, “That year, a plague spread through our region, infecting many. People were terrified. Suddenly, a yellow-robed Daoist appeared, inscribing talismans in vermilion script and distributing them freely throughout the villages. Anyone who placed these talismans on their doors saw the plague vanish at once.  

“Then word came that a fire broke out in Xianyang city, burning houses without end. A Daoist in yellow robes emerged from a tavern, holding a half cup of wine. He took a sip and spat toward the flames. The fire instantly died out. The townsfolk, grateful for his fire-quelling deed, asked his name. He said, ‘Three horizontals in a row is my surname; three scholars opening their mouths is my given name.’ Then, with a light step, he vanished without a trace.  

“Later, someone deciphered this riddle: ‘Three horizontals in a row’ is the character ‘Wang’; ‘three scholars with open mouths’ is ‘Ji.’ Thus, his name must be Wang Ji. When this news reached our village, we realized he had become a deity.  

“We had a clan sister, called Jade Mother, who on her deathbed said, ‘Uncle Xiaolian, clad in yellow, has come to escort me.’  

“Therefore, the northern and southern villages, grateful for his protection and grace, built this temple to repay his virtue. On the left wall hangs a wooden plaque commemorating these events. You may read it and understand.”  

Qiu, Liu, and the others approached the plaque and looked upward to read its inscription:  

> “It is said that those who labor diligently for the nation are honored,  
> Those who benefit the people are revered.  
> Our village’s Lord Wang, named Ji, was an extraordinary man.  
> In youth, he studied books; in prime, he practiced martial arts.  
> After entrusting himself to Xiaolian, he feigned illness and stroke, falling silent.  
> No one could discern his condition. He nurtured his health for twelve years,  
> Gazing out before his door, then one day vanished without a trace.  
> Searches found no sign of him.  
> Later, when plague struck, he cast talismans to save lives,  
> Preserving many souls. The villagers all shared his blessings.  
> He also quelled fire in Xianyang city by spitting wine,  
> Leaving a riddle that bore his name.  
> He escorted a widowed sister to ascend the heavens,  
> Blessing the people with abundant fortune.  
> Though he forgot not his native village,  
> How could the villagers fail to repay him?  
> Given his merit in driving away plague and fire,  
> It is fitting to honor him with offerings.  
> Thus, the villagers gathered and resolved  
> To build this hall and enshrine his image,  
> Holding annual rites to repay his toil.  
> That is the story.”  

Qiu and Liu sighed, “Our master’s divine workings are unfathomable, his transformations endless—beyond our knowing!”  

They saw Wang Sanlao whispering into a young attendant’s ear. The boy nodded and soon returned with a villager carrying a basket filled with noodles and such. He invited the Daoist friends to partake.  

Liu and Qiu offered thanks, but the elder said, “You have labored to escort our clan elder brother’s coffin home and now come to visit his family. There is no fine hospitality—only a simple meal. No thanks are needed.”  

Seeing his humility, Qiu and Liu sat to eat. That night they rested in the temple. Many came to visit and converse. At dawn, seven or eight households brought food. The Daoist friends could not eat much, but each took a little to honor their hosts.  

Liu Changsheng and the others discussed and decided to give the remaining ten or so taels of silver, gifted by Master Ma Danyang for expenses, to the three elders as a contribution for temple upkeep. The Daoist friends approved and handed over the silver, explaining their intent. Wang Sanlao accepted it. Then Qiu and Liu took their leave.  

Leaving Great Wei Village, they traveled over ten li until they reached a great tree beneath which they sat to rest. Tan Changzhen said, “Our grand task of escorting the master westward is complete. If we return to Shandong, it will only be to feed Brother Ma and spend some money. As the saying goes, ‘There is no feast without parting.’ Also, ‘The dao does not cling to affection; attachment is not the dao.’ Having traveled together so long, surely three or five forming cliques invites gossip and inconvenience. Better to part ways and gain freedom.”  

Wang, Hao, and others agreed, “Brother’s words are wise.”  

Thus Liu Changsheng went southeast, Wang Yuyang southwest, Tan Changzhen south, and Hao Taigu east. Qiu Changchun, seeing all roads taken, had no path to follow and resolved to remain in Shaanxi, seeking alms to sustain himself, aspiring to cultivate the dao.  

This story we set aside for now, and turn to Hao Taigu’s journey northward. He came upon a stone bridge with eight or nine caverns beneath. The bridge’s foundations were natural bedrock. Each autumn and winter, when the river ran dry and waters receded, refugees and starving folk often rested beneath the bridge.  

Hao Taigu saw the bridge’s underside was remarkably clean during the dry season. He sat beneath it to meditate. At first, no one noticed, and it was quiet. Gradually, people learned of him and became involved. Nearby villagers, seeing him sitting all day, knew he was a cultivator. They often brought him bread and cakes. He could not eat so much, so the leftovers piled before him. Crows and old ravens pecked at the scraps, tearing pieces here and there, flying in the air or dropping crumbs into the water or onto the road. Children saw this and gathered the bits to eat. They tracked him down to the bridge and played around him. Seeing him sit motionless like a statue of clay or wood, the children, becoming familiar, treated him like a Bodhisattva and wanted to build a temple for him.  

They gathered stones and tiles, building walls on both sides. They broke branches for beams and covered the roof with grass. After eating at home each day, they invited one another to come down beneath the bridge to kowtow and bow to Hao Taigu, laughing and chattering boisterously.  

Hao Taigu was a man of great composure and did not mind. Letting them make noise and frolic, he found peace amid the clamor—quiet within the uproar, not without benefit.  

One day, the village held a Guanyin Lotus Platform festival. The children went to watch and were very quiet. Hao Taigu saw a man beneath the bridge grinding a brick. The man ground a while, then held it up to his face, then ground again, repeating this dozens of times until the brick was worn away. Then he took two more bricks to grind.  

Hao Taigu thought the man intended to make some vessel from the brick. Seeing him grind the bricks into useless mud, Hao Taigu wished to guide him and asked, “What vessel do you intend to make by grinding this brick?”  

The man answered, “Indeed, I want to make a vessel.”  

Hao Taigu said, “If you want to make a vessel, you must first set your intention: either scrape it high and smooth it flat, or use force to shape it round. Follow the rules, then skill arises. Without pattern, how can you succeed by grinding at random? Tell me, what vessel do you truly seek?”  

The man replied, “I want to polish this brick bright to make a mirror, to look at my face morning and evening.”  

Hao Taigu laughed, “A brick is mere tile, neither copper nor iron. How can it be polished bright? Is this not a waste of effort?”  

The man laughed heartily, “By your logic, since this brick cannot become a mirror, how can your sitting become immortality? Your dry sitting is no different from my grinding bricks.”  

Hearing this, Hao Taigu was startled. He rose quickly and stepped forward to ask more, but the man drifted away like a spirit and could not be caught in conversation.  

Hao Taigu knew this was a transcendent being come to instruct him: that idle sitting without purpose is no better than grinding bricks in vain. He gathered his belongings and left Jin’an Bridge, heading toward Youyan, sighing:  

> Grinding bricks wastes effort in vain—  
> Both acts are labors without fruit.  
> Sitting still, cultivating breath until dry,  
> One word’s reminder breaks the path of confusion.  

Setting aside Hao Taigu’s northern journey, let us speak of Changzhen’s southern travel. One day in Suizhou, as dusk approached, there was no ancient temple or pavilion, nor any inn or traveler’s lodge. By the roadside stood a large manor with many houses. Wishing to borrow lodging and offer some simple vegetarian fare, he approached the manor.  

Just as he neared the gate, a man emerged, appearing to be the steward. His surname was Gu, given name Zucheng, styled Yufeng. Once a good man of the dao, he had been cheated multiple times by unruly Daoist pretenders claiming immortality, losing money again and again. Thus, he despised Daoists, like the front scaring the back.  

Gu Yufeng saw Tan Changzhen approaching and shouted loudly, “Daoist, do not come here! Monks and Daoists have no fate with us!”  

Tan Changzhen glanced at him, intending to enlighten him, uncertain if the man would accept teaching. Let us await the next chapter to see what unfolds.
