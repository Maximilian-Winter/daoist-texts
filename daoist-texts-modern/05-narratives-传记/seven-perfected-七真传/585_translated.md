# Chapter Seventeen: The Playful Xi Hong’s Scheme to Escape; The Elusive Hunran and the True Path

The heart’s realm must be clear and bright;  
Do not let a single matter mislead your whole life.

In former years, all were deceived by false men,  
Now, meeting a true person, one cannot discern clearly.

It is told that Master Tan Changzhen, seeing in Gu Yufeng a trace of benevolent aura, wished to enlighten him. Yet before Tan could speak, Gu Yufeng said, “Daoist Master, no need for many words. I am weary of all your talk. Even if you say more, I will not believe it. I have been frightened by your kind of people. What kind of cultivators are you? To me, you all seem but those scheming for food and clothing.” Having said this, he went inside and did not come out again.

Tan Changzhen, hearing these words that stripped the Daoist path of all its spirit, resolved to revive the noble tradition of the sect. Looking up, he saw the sky darkening; so he sat at the gate of the estate, meditating. When night fell, the villagers urged him to leave, carrying a bucket of cold water to splash at the gate, wetting him and opening the door.

Seeing such cruelty, Tan Changzhen would not approach the gate again but sat by the roadside. That night, snow fell again, piling up over a foot deep. At dawn, the villagers came out and saw Tan sitting in the open field, surrounded by white snow—but strangely, not a single flake touched his body. They reported this to Yufeng.

Upon hearing this, Gu Yufeng came out himself to see. Approaching Tan, he felt a warm aura near him and knew he was a man of the dao. He invited him inside with guestly respect, saying, “It is not that I disbelieve the dao; it is just that among daoists there are no good men. But you, sir, with such earnest cultivation, who would not respect you? I now wish to support you. Stay in my home for three years, five years, ten years, or even eight years—I would be pleased. Tomorrow I will choose an auspicious day to formally take you as my master. May I ask if you would consent?”

Tan Changzhen had intended to enlighten him, but seeing he had begun to believe, though not yet fully reverent, how could he refuse? So he nodded assent.

Gu Yufeng rejoiced and ordered his servants to clean a room in the back. He invited Tan inside, who sat in reverent meditation, observing profound mysteries without fail. Every day there was vegetarian tea and meals, with no lack of offerings. He also had the maidservant Xi Hong attend to Tan, bringing him soup and water. Truly, Tan’s Dao was genuine virtue, his subtle principles boundless.

Time passed swiftly. After more than half a year, Gu Yufeng did not come seeking the dao or asking questions. Tan suspected his heart was fond of the dao but not of learning it; he wished to have others support him, to create merit and blessings on his behalf, while he enjoyed the ready-made fortune. Seeing through this scheme, Tan no longer wished to be supported in that household. He repeatedly took leave, but Gu Yufeng pleaded bitterly, unwilling to let him go, even ordering his household to watch carefully. Thus, Tan’s attempts to leave were thwarted again and again.

Unable to escape, Tan devised a clever plan, knowing this was the only way out.

Soon Xi Hong came with tea. Tan deliberately squeezed her wrist and said, “Your hand is so fair and delicate, it makes one love it to death!” Xi Hong’s face flushed red; she forced a reply, “It is as smooth as lacquer, Master, please do not tease.” With that, she went out and went to the upper room to tell the mistress of the Gu household.

The mistress said to her husband, “Master Tan is teasing our maidservant. He is no true cultivator. You should send him away.” Gu Yufeng did not believe this, saying, “This is just Xi Hong’s impatience in serving him, causing such rumors.” Seeing her husband’s words, the mistress scolded Xi Hong, who dared not speak further.

Two days later, Gu Yufeng saw Xi Hong bringing tea to Tan and secretly followed behind to spy. Indeed, he saw Tan move Xi Hong’s hand, smiling warmly, saying, “Your hand is as white as jade, as soft as cotton—truly enchanting!” Hearing this, Gu Yufeng’s heart burned with anger. He wanted to drive Tan out but thought: He had often tried to leave, and I had repeatedly begged him to stay. Now if I expel him, I will seem unkind. Better to write a few words on a paper and post it on the wall. If he is wise, he will leave on his own. I will only tell my men not to block him. This is a good plan.

The next day, Tan sat until after breakfast but saw no Xi Hong bringing tea or water. The plan was working. He came out and saw a paper posted on the door, with four lines written:

> The west wind blows, snowflakes fly day and night,  
> Coldly sitting on the mat, shadow slants in the light.  
> Do not envy today’s hands like jade,  
> Far think of the past body like a frog.

Tan read this and smiled. Entering the room, he found brush and ink on the table. Taking the brush, he wrote four lines on the paper outside. After finishing, he went inside to pack his belongings, then ran out before the hall, calling out thanks twice, but no one answered. He went straight out the estate gate, heading south. He wandered for two years before returning north—this is another tale, not told here.

As for the Gu household servants, since their master had told them not to block Tan’s leaving, they all avoided him when he came out, reporting to their master only after he had gone. Gu Yufeng came behind and saw the additional four lines Tan had written at the bottom of the original paper. What were these four lines?

> Do not speak of snow, moon, wind, or flowers,  
> With a righteous heart, why fear a slanting shadow?  
> No mention of Xi Hong’s hands like jade,  
> This body is surely a frog in the well.

Seeing these lines, Gu Yufeng realized Tan’s teasing of Xi Hong was a clever ruse to escape and sighed deeply.

This tale aside, let us speak of Wang Yuyang. After parting ways with fellow daoist friends in Dawei Village, he journeyed to the region of Fangzhou. In the northern road of Fangzhou lived an official named Yao Chonggao. Once he served in the Xin’an Youfu but, seeing the world’s affairs lightly, resigned and returned home to enjoy rural life. Above all, he loved the dao. Meeting monks or daoists, he treated them like kin, whether they cultivated or not, always eager to talk.

Near him was the “Encountering Immortals Temple.” The abbot there was also a daoist, and monks and daoists passing through often stayed overnight. Yao had instructed the abbot: “If any cultivator of skill and goodness comes, be sure to inform me.” The abbot agreed.

One day, a practitioner neither monk nor daoist came, claiming to be a man of the dao. He often displayed great magic before people, saying he was ninety-six years old, had met Zhang Sanfeng many times, had also met Lü Dongbin several times, that Bodhidharma was his master, Ji Dian his good friend, and that he could sit in meditation for one or two days without falling. That day at Encountering Immortals Temple, he spoke words of boundless salvation. The abbot listened attentively and asked his name. He said he was called Hunranzi.

The abbot led him to meet Master Yao. Upon meeting, Hunranzi said, “Monks are hungry ghosts of lust; daoists are demons of qi. Neither can become immortals or Buddhas. Only one like me, who can see through all things and remain unstained by a single speck of dust, counts as true cultivation.” He asked how long Yao wished to live as a cultivator. Yao Chonggao was delighted and bowed to him as master, supporting him at home.

The old man spoke without reserve, scorning monks and daoists in every sentence. Nearby, the daoists of Encountering Immortals Temple heard this and felt offended. The abbot thought: This old man is so ignorant. I recommended him kindly for support, yet he disrespects us openly, slandering monks and daoists before my eyes. Does he not know the roof tiles above and the people below the eaves? He only seeks Yao’s respect but belittles us. I must find another meditator to rebuke this old man and satisfy my heart. With this thought, he left Yao’s home and returned to the temple.

A few days later, Wang Yuyang came to lodge. The abbot saw his dignified bearing and knew he must be a man of the dao. Seeing him meditate all day, his spirit bright and clear, the abbot thought: To refute that old man, none but this one will do. He wished to explain the matter to Wang but feared he might refuse to go. So he devised a plan, saying, “Master Yao has a great cultivator at home who can sit ten days without faltering. I wish to visit him with a fellow daoist. What do you think?”

Wang Yuyang was pleased and went with the abbot to Yao’s residence. The gatekeeper announced their arrival. Yao Chonggao came out to welcome them and led them to the guest hall to serve tea. Before speaking, a white-haired old man entered. Wang looked at him: thick eyebrows, narrow eyes, nose raised high, lips curled back, square face with long ears, a few wisps of beard, a few white hairs on his head—he looked like an old crone. He sat on the upper chair.

The abbot told Wang, “This old gentleman is the great cultivator I mentioned.” Wang bowed to him. The old man looked haughtily without moving and said, “You, dao friend, are you a flower planter or a willow inserter?”

Wang was puzzled and did not answer. The old man asked again, “Do you have a wife?”

Wang thought these were worldly questions and answered casually, “I do have a wife, but I left her at home.”

Hunranzi laughed loudly, “You wasted your monastic path if you don’t even know these few words. I tell you: ‘planting flowers’ means young men becoming monks; ‘inserting willows’ means middle-aged men becoming monks. Asking if you have a wife—is that to get true yin news? You answer with worldly words, showing you do not understand. If I asked about pregnancy, you would understand even less.”

This Hunranzi openly shamed Wang, but Wang did not mind. The abbot, however, turned pale. Seeing the abbot’s face flush with shame, Wang had to say a few words to save face for all.

He smiled and asked, “Just now you spoke of true yin. What exactly is this true yin? You also spoke of pregnancy, but I do not know where the fetus comes from, nor what is conceived?”

Hunranzi could not answer immediately, laughing silently, “The profound mystery cannot be revealed. How could I speak lightly to you?”

Seeing the old man’s forced words, as if he did not know, the abbot said to Wang, “Friend, just ask him. If he does not know, do not press.”

What Wang said next is unknown. We shall hear more in the next chapter.

Blustering often, yet when questioned, silent and dumb.
