# Chapter Eighteen: Wang Yuyang’s Genuine Attire and Tan Changzhen’s Ancient Teachings Confirm the Present

It is said that in the Western lands grows a wondrous lotus,  
Its blossoms ten inches wide, the rhizomes shaped like boats.  

The Numinous Platform itself harbors the Garden of Vows,  
The local scenery is none other than Buddha’s Heaven.

The tale unfolds: Wang Yuyang spoke a few pointed words that utterly refuted Hunranzi, who could not reply. The temple master beside them clapped his hands and laughed heartily, urging Wang Yuyang to speak freely without hesitation, for Hunranzi could not grasp such matters. Seeing the temple master say he did not understand, Hunranzi grew angry. Wang Yuyang quickly explained: “Old sir, it is not that you do not know, but that you are unwilling to speak! I, a humble Daoist, dare to lay out this principle for all to ponder and judge its truth or falsity. The true yin and true yang are the two vital energies. The true yang energy is stored in the liver; the true yin energy gathers in the lungs. The liver corresponds to Wood, the dwelling of the hun soul; the lungs correspond to Metal, the place where the po soul resides. Metal is the Dui trigram, the female; Wood is the Zhen trigram, the male. Wood flourishes in the East; Metal is born in the West. Thus, we liken the East family to the lad and the West family to the lass. To bring Metal and Wood together so that hun does not leave po, and po does not leave hun—like a husband loving his wife, and wife relying on her husband—this is the principle of yin and yang uniting.

“Old sir Hunran asked if I spoke of household affairs, but indeed one must borrow the matchmaker Huangpo to bring them together. Huangpo is true intention; it means one must use true intention to understand and unite, so that Metal and Wood have no gap between them, just like a harmonious couple. Intention belongs to Earth and is full of feeling; its color is yellow and it moves restlessly, hence it is likened to a matchmaker. East and West come and go, communicating between the two families like a go-between. Pregnancy means the true qi condenses within the elixir field, as if in a state of conception. When true qi is complete, it manifests in the spirit; thus the spirit is called the child of qi, and qi the mother of spirit. Hence the saying of a baby’s birth. When it reaches this stage, the Great Elixir is complete: one may age with Heaven and Earth, rest with sun and moon.”

Old Master Yao praised these words without end. Hunranzi, fearing Wang Yuyang would snatch his livelihood, boasted loudly: “Where there is virtue, there must be words; but where there are words, virtue need not be present. If you dare to sit in meditation with me, abstaining from tea and water for three days, then you may be said to have real skill.” Wang Yuyang smiled: “If it were many days, I could not sit. But if you say two or three days, this humble one is willing to accompany you.” With that, the two began to compete in meditation skill. They laid out felt mats side by side in the guest hall and sat shoulder to shoulder. Hunranzi could normally sit three days without tea or water, but because he was competing with Yuyang, a bit of resentment arose in his heart, making him restless. Many troubles arose: at times he longed for tea and water; at times he had to relieve himself repeatedly, several times a day. By the second day, he could no longer endure and finally rose to seek food and drink, then dozed off, snoring loudly. Wang Yuyang sat firmly until the third day before rising, feeling refreshed and clear in spirit. Old Master Yao praised him repeatedly: “Your meditation skill surpasses that of the old sir.” Wang Yuyang replied: “It is not that the old sir is inferior, but that he is advanced in years and his vigor is waning. If I reached his age, I fear I could not endure half a day.” Hearing this, Hunranzi’s heart was pleased and he resumed conversation with Wang Yuyang, no longer arrogant but gradually humble and respectful.

Wang Yuyang stayed several days at the Yao residence, teaching a few profound techniques. They got along very well. One day, Wang Yuyang excused himself, saying he was going to the Encountering Immortals Temple to obtain a single scroll. He left and did not return for several days. Yao Chonggao sent servants to inquire; the temple master said he had left that very day. Upon hearing this, Old Master Yao stamped his foot and sighed deeply, feeling fate had slipped away. Hunranzi also felt reluctant. After Wang Yuyang’s departure, the story shifts to Liu Changsheng, who, after bidding farewell to fellow Daoist friends, journeyed south, then east to Lu, where he refined his skills at Mount Tai for three years. Having attained the true fruit, he ascended to the upper realms to feast at the Jade Pool and pay respects to the Queen Mother of the West. Behind her stood dozens of immortal maidens, their countenances wondrous and rare in the world, beyond description or painting—lovely and enviable. Unable to resist a moment’s impulse, he stole a glance at the assembled maidens. The Queen Mother asked: “You look upon them—what do you intend?” Hearing her words, Liu Changsheng realized his rudeness and, trembling with fear, apologized humbly: “I happened to see the rainbow sleeves fluttering and colorful sleeves spreading. Unintentionally, I glanced at the immortal maidens, truly with no other intent. I beg your mercy and forgiveness.”

The Queen Mother reproached him: “While you still cling to self and other, while form is not empty, even if the Golden Elixir is achieved, you cannot transcend the mundane to enter the sage. You must return to the mortal world and undergo bitter cultivation and refinement.” She then ordered the celestial officials to send him down. The Southern Heavenly Officials, obeying her command, led Liu Changsheng to the Southern Heavenly Gate. Just as he was about to ride the cloud qi downward, a celestial official pushed him with a palm, causing him to fall from the gate. Suddenly awakened, he realized it was but a dreamlike vision. Reflecting on the Jade Pool incident, he saw it was truly a moment’s lapse. Moreover, Master Chongyang had once said: “I excel in the way of the elixir, but my form is not yet empty.” Now, the Queen Mother’s rebuke in the dream agreed with the master’s words. Yet he did not know how to proceed with the method. He must descend the mountain to seek a master’s guidance. Thus, he came down the mountain and, after a few days’ travel, met Tan Changzhen, to whom he recounted all past events.

Liu Changsheng said: “You do not accept family support and your mind is not misguided. I, at the Jade Pool, erred in gazing upon the immortal maidens, yet my mind was not wrong. Now I wish to refine the emptiness of form but do not know where to begin.” Tan Changzhen replied: “Long ago, when Xu Jingyang was young, he loved hunting. One day, while hunting in the mountains, he shot an arrow at a young deer. The young deer fled with the arrow, and Jingyang led his men to search the mountain. They found two deer in a hollow. The young deer lay on the ground, and the older deer licked its wounds. Seeing humans approach, the older deer did not flee; both were captured. Returning home and releasing them, both deer died. Upon opening their bellies, the mother’s intestines were severed, while the young deer, though wounded, had intact intestines. This shows the pain of a child’s heart is far more piercing than the arrow’s wound. Seeing this, Jingyang’s heart was moved, so he broke his bow and arrows and entered the mountains to cultivate, eventually achieving the true fruit. He wished to transform and save the Ten Powers, so he ascended a platform to preach and gathered over a hundred disciples.”

One day, Jingyang said to his disciples: “You hundreds are many indeed, abandoning home to learn the dao with sincerity. But for practitioners, one must see through form’s emptiness. Can you see form without greed?” The disciples replied in unison: “Regarding wealth, qi, and wine, perhaps we have not fully let go; but as for form, we regard it lightly and do not covet it.” Jingyang said: “You say this so purely, but I fear it is not so.” The disciples answered: “We dare not falsely deceive the master.” Jingyang said: “I have a method to test your truth. Each of you prepare a piece of charcoal, about two feet long, or three or four feet if possible, and place it on your bed to sleep with for one night. Tomorrow morning, bring it to me and I will reveal the true skill to you.” The disciples, not understanding, each prepared their charcoal and placed it on their beds.

That night, one disciple awoke from a nap to find someone sleeping beside him. Feeling with his hand, it was soft as cotton, smooth as jade. Reaching lower, it was a woman’s body. Desire flared suddenly and could not be restrained, so he embraced her. Having leaked true yang, he was reluctant to part and they slept entwined. At dawn, a shout outside called: “Come quickly to hand in your charcoal; the master has waited long.” The disciples awoke in shock, each clutching a piece of charcoal, bewildered. The call came again: “Put on your clothes and come hand in your charcoal.” Jingyang ordered the disciples to stand in two rows and hand over their charcoal one by one. Hearing this, none dared disobey and stood in two lines. One stepped forward to present his charcoal. Jingyang asked: “How old are you?” The man replied: “I am seventy-six this year.” Jingyang said: “At your age, why have you not seen through form?” The man replied: “How do you know I have not?” Jingyang said: “If you have, then what is that on your charcoal?” The man looked and saw faint white spots at its midsection, filthy marks—proof of last night’s leaked true yang. Ashamed, he hung his head and said nothing. Only then did everyone realize the woman of last night was but the charcoal transformed. Seeing the marks, many feared disgrace and stood dumb, refusing to hand in their charcoal. After several calls, none moved. Only one laughed and stepped forward, presenting his charcoal spotless. Jingyang asked: “Form is what people desire; why do you not desire it?” The man answered: “I have refined my skill from desire itself.” Jingyang asked how he refined it. He said: “Whatever one desires, one fears. At first, one fears not obtaining it; once obtained, one rejoices and will not rest. This weakens spirit and qi, and one fears for life. Thus, one fears greatly and must avoid. By facing the object and forgetting feeling, one cuts off desire to preserve the body. In my youth, I was reckless, sleeping with flowers and willows, never returning home for years, treating brothels as my own house. Having seen countless beauties and endless romances, I harmed my spirit. Fearful, I wished to avoid it but could not, so I fled here to learn the dao, to preserve life and no longer covet beauty. There is no other trick, only having seen much and experienced much.” Jingyang nodded. He then dismissed the disciples, keeping only this one to teach the subtle dao, who later also attained the true fruit. From this, it follows that all things must be experienced; only by seeing much can one regard things lightly and let go.

Tan Changzhen finished recounting this generation of ancients. Liu Changsheng said: “I had no intention toward inner matters, only delight in outward appearances. One day I shall visit the brothels, see all the painted faces, and become well versed, making my eyes broad and empty.” Tan Changzhen invited him to the land of Jin to see the birthplace of the Dao Patriarch. After many days’ travel, they met Wang Yuyang walking ahead. Wang Yuyang recounted the debate with Hunranzi at the Yao residence to the two. Liu Changsheng laughed: “That old fellow has profited, stealing away our dao secrets.” Wang Yuyang said: “If I did not know how to sit in meditation, that old man would not have yielded.” Tan Changzhen said: “It seems sitting in meditation is the gatekeeper’s cudgel for us Dao practitioners; none in our school may neglect it.” The three walked and talked, when suddenly a voice called from behind: “You walk so fast. Who might this be? We shall see in the next chapter.”

Lovely forms were once the painted towers,  
Evening joys and morning pleasures never ceased.  

Suddenly the impermanence ends all affairs,  
The night platform can no longer display old charms.
