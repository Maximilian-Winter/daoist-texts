# Chapter Nineteen: On the Profound Mystery—Four-Word Tokens of the Subtle Dao; Opening the Stone Cavern, One Person’s Sole Diligence

Sunk deep in mire and ruin for many a year,  
The River of Love surges, waves towering to the sky.  

One who cultivates may reach the high shore,  
Why seek a boat midstream once the path is sure?  

It is told that Liu Changsheng, Wang Yuyang, and Tan Changzhen—three companions journeying together—suddenly heard someone calling from behind. Turning around, they saw it was Hao Taigu. Upon meeting, they shared their parting sorrows, and the four traveled on together until they reached the region of Ku County, where the Most High had descended.  

There stood nine wells encircling an eight-sided pavilion. Beside the pavilion grew a plum tree, said to be the very tree beneath which the Most High was born. The four stepped inside the pavilion, where in the center stood a stone stele recording the birth event. It read:  

“In the time of Pan Geng, when the Shang became Yin, in the fifth year of Yin, this land was inhabited by people skilled in numbers and patterns, able to know past and future. Through quiet cultivation, they lived hidden lives, seeking no fame or recognition. Among them was a maiden, nineteen years old, unmarried, gentle and serene, disliking idle chatter and laughter. One day, she chanced beneath the plum tree and saw a bright red plum hanging from a branch. She plucked and swallowed it, and soon became with child. Since she had no husband, rumors arose, but the people, versed in numerology, discerned that a great sage was to be born, and so they supported her with care. The sacred fetus grew within her, and the time of birth was chosen carefully.”  

“They sought a good year but found no good month; a good month but no good day; a good day but no good hour. After much choosing, eighty-one years passed. At last, the sacred mother, now a hundred years old and carrying the sacred fetus, neither hungry nor cold, free from illness or disaster, came to the plum tree on the fifteenth day of the second month to ease her mind. The Most High split the mother’s left side and leapt forth, born with white hair. Upon touching the ground, he could walk immediately, stepping forward seven paces, retreating three, and shouting thrice: ‘Heaven above and earth below, I alone am honored.’”  

“As he finished, celestial music filled the air, fragrant winds drifted, jade maidens scattered flowers, nine dragons spouted water, bathing his body. Where the water fell, nine wells formed. The Most High’s spirit and wisdom were unparalleled, his sacred virtue like Heaven’s own. He took ‘Li’ as his surname, for his birth with white hair, and people called him Laozi. This is the origin of his birth. Other marvels are recorded in scriptures and histories, verified by many, not without basis.”  

Liu, Hao, and the others, having read the inscription, praised: “The Most High’s Daoist spirit leaves a legacy, eternal through a thousand autumns, praised through myriad ages, endlessly recalled. We have cultivated the dao many years—who among us truly knows the profound mysteries? Before this immortal realm, let us not hesitate to reveal its secrets.”  

Hao Taigu said:  
“A keen sword hangs cold beneath the stars,  
Demons bound, no chance to stir their plots.  
On the meditation cushion, the midnight moon is cut,  
Ninefold refining, dragons and tigers entwined.”  

Wang Yuyang said:  
“At the immortal pavilion, recalling ancient warmth and chill,  
Examining the profound work’s utmost truth.  
Seizing the golden crow and jade rabbit,  
Naturally the tiger crouches and the dragon coils.”  

Tan Changzhen said:  
“The dao’s method knows no bounds, spirits and ghosts shiver,  
Transcending mortal and sage, whence comes this root?  
One fist shatters the net of delusion,  
In the crescent furnace, dragons and tigers coil.”  

Liu Changsheng said:  
“Speak now of men whose hearts tremble,  
Where rainbow and cloud first stir the root.  
Wisdom itself turns to folly,  
What need to mention immortal mountains where dragons coil?”  

When they finished speaking, Wang Yuyang asked again: “What all three of us have said accords with the subtle dao! Words that win, not words that lose. Yet why does Brother Liu not speak of victory but of defeat, belittling others? Surely this is not the subtle dao!”  

Tan Changzhen replied: “A trembling heart is not the dao! A foolish man is not subtle! Yet to cause trembling is not without dao. To recognize folly is not without subtlety. It is not that the dao is not subtle, but that the subtle dao lies within. Not judged by victory or defeat—what merit is there in belittling?”  

Hao Taigu said: “What Brother Liu speaks is not limited to this; there must be other reasons.” Tan Changzhen laughed: “Indeed, indeed! Brother Liu once went to the Jade Pool feast and secretly watched the celestial maidens. The Queen Mother grew angry and sent him back to the mortal world. We two met on the way; he spoke to me, and I answered him with charcoal testing the dao, the Jingyang’s intention. Hearing my words, he resolved wholeheartedly to go.”  

Here Tan Changzhen stopped speaking. Wang Yuyang asked: “What was his single-minded purpose?” Tan Changzhen said: “He sought to realize the dao among the red powder troupe, to investigate the subtle in the silk and bamboo hall, applying great effort to empty form and color.” Wang Yuyang said: “Seen, it is not seen; heard, it is not heard; thus no form or color.” Hao Taigu said: “Better to forget self and other, and form and color become empty.” Liu Changsheng said: “What you say is for the highest sages and perfected ones. I now wish to use broad seeing as skill, to widely know and practice.” Wang Yuyang and Hao Taigu both said: “Those who refine the color demon are many through ages, but none have heard of such refining as this.” Tan Changzhen said: “The determined can be skillful; the undetermined may keep simplicity. Each has subtle use; no need for deep words.”  

With that, night fell. The four sat in meditation within the pavilion and passed the night. The next day, they parted ways.  

As for Hao Taigu, he journeyed to Huashang, and suddenly looked up to see a towering mountain shaped like a palm, soaring into the clouds. Previously, when escorting the master’s coffin westward, the burden on his shoulder left no time to gaze, so he had not seen this mountain. Now, carefree and at ease, he could not help but admire it. He recalled the master’s words about the place where the dao was realized and climbed to its summit. From there, all mountains bowed beneath him. The old poet Kou Laigong once wrote:  

“Only Heaven stands above, no mountain matches its height.  
Raising my head, the red sun draws near;  
Lowering it, clouds seem to sink below.”  

This mountain was the Western Peak, Mount Taihua, the immortal mountain. On its summit were more than ten palaces and temples, each tended by Daoists burning incense, a bustling scene. Hao Taigu sought a quiet spot. Being skilled in stonework, he made hammer and drill, and by divine power carved a cavern in the rock face, just large enough to kneel in. Just as he was about to enter for quiet cultivation, a Daoist friend arrived, carrying a meditation mat and a hand bell. Without waiting for Hao’s reply, he stepped inside, spread his mat, and sat down, claiming the cave regardless of Hao’s consent.  

Hao Taigu, kind-hearted and soft-faced, could not bear to refuse, so he yielded the cave. He went further up and found a great stone several zhang high by the roadside. He set to carving another cave, working his hands and feet to exhaustion, finally making a cavern slightly wider than the first. Joy filled his heart. Yet another Daoist came, saying he had nowhere to meditate and begged Hao to be merciful and give him the cave. Hao, a cultivator, fulfilled his wish again.  

One after another, more than ten men came, and after great toil Hao had carved seventy-two caves, all of which were requested and given away.  

Still with nowhere to cultivate, Hao sought another place. He found a spot deep within a sheer rock face thousands of zhang high, where swallows could not fly. If he carved a cave there, no Daoist, no matter how skilled in flight, could reach it. Yet there was no path—one must descend by rope or climb by rope.  

Hao Taigu surveyed the place, then went out and used the wealth he had gathered over the years to buy a long rope. Along the way, Heaven sent him an honest disciple. Together, master and disciple reached the mountain, tied the rope to a great tree, and Hao, carrying drill and chisel, held the rope and slowly descended the cliff to the chosen spot. There was a narrow space to sit and stand, where he could carve his cave daily. The honest disciple cooked meals for him. Hao ate only one meal a day, returning at night.  

The disciple grew impatient, thinking: “I thought learning the dao would be leisurely, but cooking meals is such hard work. What good is this study?” His heart darkened. Secretly carrying a firewood knife, he waited until Hao ate and went to carve, then followed behind. Seeing Hao lower the rope and begin descending, the honest disciple drew his knife and cut the rope with one stroke.  

The rope snapped forward, and Hao fell down the sheer cliff thousands of zhang deep. His fate unknown.  

Later folk, admiring Hao’s cave, wrote four lines on the rock wall:  

“Gentlemen, be cautious, be cautious,  
Descending nine li and three fen.  
People fall from Huayin,  
Southward to seek the corpse.”  

Meanwhile, the honest disciple, believing Hao was smashed to pulp, packed his master’s bedding and belongings and set off down the mountain. After more than ten li, he came to a great stone and saw a man below who looked like his master. Upon closer look, it was indeed him. Shocked, sweat running down his back, he blurted out: “Master, where have you been?”  

Hao Taigu smiled faintly: “The drill was dull, so I went to the blacksmith in Shangzhou to have it sharpened. You, carrying the bedding, where are you headed?”  

The disciple said: “I came to meet you, for you had not returned long.”  

Hao Taigu laughed heartily: “What a filial disciple! Only an hour has passed, yet you worry so. There are still eleven or twelve li of mountain ahead, and the sun is but three zhang high. How could you have walked so far? If you had not brought bedding, you would have surely suffered the cold tonight.”  

With that, Hao Taigu went on ahead, leaving the disciple beneath the great stone, pondering: “What kind of master is this? Such a high cliff should have killed him, yet he lives. His toil is not yet done; he must still carve caves and cannot roam freely. Yet he acts as if he is a god, surviving the fall and returning so swiftly. And when he saw me, he only smiled, no anger—truly a magnanimous man. I have missed such a master; none else in the world is so compassionate. Perhaps it is my fault. I shall return to the mountain and serve him, see if a way forward appears.”  

So he followed and asked: “The rope is cut—how will you carve caves?”  

Hao Taigu said: “That does not matter. Watch me leap down.”  

With that, he sprang and leapt down the sheer cliff thousands of zhang deep.  

What follows next—wait for the next chapter to unfold.  

Light as flying clouds,  
What fear of cliffs thousands of zhang high?
