# Chapter Twenty: Refining Form Amidst the Brothel’s Smoke and Flowers — Speaking Sublime Words, Contemplating Pure Innocence

To behold beauty yet remain unmoved—this is the heart’s true test;  
When skill has reached this point, naturally the depth unfolds.  

There are those who master the method of true emptiness,  
Their tiger’s roar and dragon’s chant spanning ancient and modern times.  

Now, it is told that Master Hao Taigu was one who attained the dao;  
How then could he be cast down? When his disciple severed the long rope,  
He had already shed his mortal frame. This time he merely came forth to reveal the dao,  
So that future generations might know that gods and immortals are indeed attainable.  

His disciple, seeing his master leap from the cliff, was struck with terror.  
After waiting several days with no sign of his return, each went their separate way.  

Meanwhile, Liu Changsheng, single-minded in his quest to refine the demon of lust,  
Heard that in the two prefectures of Su and Hang there were beauties aplenty,  
And so journeyed thither. Gathering some rough stones, he transformed them into gold, silver;  
Discarded his Daoist robes, bought silks and satins, dressed himself grandly,  
And swaggered boldly into the brothel’s smoky flowered courtyard.  

The madam followed close behind, inevitably asking questions.  
Liu Changsheng told her, “My name is Changshengzi, a man of Yanshan.  
I have come here bearing jewels and treasures, long absent from the world,  
Seeking the finest sister to ease my heart’s unrest.”  

The madam, hearing he was a wealthy patron, knew at once a god of wealth had arrived.  
She dropped her smile and doubled her flattery, leading him to the chamber of a peerless beauty.  

This sister was named Sì Yù—“Like Jade”—a famed courtesan of the smoky flowers,  
Skilled in singing, dancing, painting, and poetry, graceful and charming.  

When Sì Yù saw Changshengzi, his bearing elegant and speech gentle,  
Open and unpretentious, so hospitable without a trace of pride,  
How could she not receive him warmly? She thus displayed utmost tenderness,  
A hundred coquettish charms, dancing and flattering with artful grace.  

Changshengzi recalled his master’s two sayings:  
“Before Mount Tai crumbles, remain unshaken—not out of ignorance,  
But as if the collapse had not yet come.  
Before a beauty’s presence, remain unmoved—not out of coldness,  
But as if she were not truly before you.”  

He emptied his heart according to these words—void and bare, utterly without possession:  
No demon of desire could find purchase; all the sister’s myriad charms,  
Her ten thousand kinds of allurements, could not stir his heart.  

The heart is the master of the body; when the heart does not move, the body is still.  
All other thoughts follow the heart’s command; if the heart does not move, they dare not move either.  
Only the eyes and ears are two mischievous fellows, seeing beauty and hearing sweet sounds,  
Reporting to the heart what they have perceived.  

Changshengzi praised the heart, bidding it not to trust the eyes and ears,  
Lest great matters be lost. The heart obeyed, feigning ignorance, like a child at play,  
Unaware of affairs of love.  

They all slept on one bed, sharing one pillow—nothing but a foul skin bag,  
Accompanying a powdered skeleton; no great delight, merely red and green colors,  
Unavoidable to the eyes; jingling sounds, unavoidable to the ears.  

Changshengzi also praised the eyes and ears, teaching them a method:  
See as if not seeing, hear as if not hearing.  
They truly followed his method—one feigned blindness, the other feigned deafness.  
Though rising and falling with the sister, they still did not know what manner of man he was,  
Nor the preciousness he bore.  

Because Liu Changsheng flattered these three elders—the heart, eyes, and ears—well,  
They protected him within the brothel, and he refined himself into a true immortal.  

Now unbound by form or trace, he often played in the courtesans’ chambers.  
The sisters, seeing him willing to spend silver, saw Changshengzi walking beside Sì Yù,  
And casually placed a fresh flower in his hair,  
Even attempting to strip off his male clothes to dress him in female robes,  
Undoing the buttons at his chest.  

Suddenly, a cough sounded outside. A foreign monk burst in—  
A dark-faced, short-bearded man, large-eyed with thick brows,  
A high nose and arching forehead, a strange visage that frightened the courtesans,  
Who all hid behind Changshengzi, not daring to utter a sound.  

Who was this foreign monk? It was none other than Patriarch Bodhidharma from the Western lands,  
Traveling southward by the sea, passing through Hangzhou.  
He saw purple mist rising from the courtyard—surely a true immortal descending to the world,  
Yet wandering amidst the smoky flowers. He intended to enlighten and save him.  

Entering the courtyard, he found the sisters and Changshengzi adorned with flowers and half-undressed,  
In a wild commotion. The madam buried her head, tidying boxes and chests;  
The other sisters napped in their rooms. Hearing the laughter behind, Bodhidharma burst in.  

Changshengzi saw at once the stranger was no ordinary man,  
Quickly rose and respectfully invited him to sit.  
Seeing a copper kettle on the table, its water cold and unboiled,  
He took the kettle, placed it on his belly, and moved his internal fire skill.  
In an instant, a roaring sound arose within the kettle, steam burst from its spout—  
The water was boiling.  

He then took a pinch of the finest Maojian tea leaves, placed them in a bowl,  
Poured the boiling water, and with both hands presented the tea to Bodhidharma.  

The courtesans, amazed at this marvel, stared dumbfounded, calling it strange and wondrous.  

Changshengzi laughed and said, “This is but a spark of true fire from the Five Phases—what’s so strange?  
I can even bake pancakes on my belly.”  

The sisters did not believe him; some fetched flour, others water.  
In moments, they made a pancake the size of a bowl, bringing it for him to bake.  

Changshengzi took it in hand, placed it on his belly, turning left three times, right three times—  
The pancake bore a cooked hue. Turning it over, he turned it several times more,  
Until the pancake was fully cooked. He handed it to the sisters, who tore it apart and ate it.  

Bodhidharma, one who sees through the emptiness of the world,  
Unburdened by worldly matters, never quarreling with others,  
Possessed of vast compassion and broad tolerance,  
Might have shown off some dao techniques if he were shallow and petty.  

But he remained unmoved, feigning a touch of simplicity, saying,  
“Your method is amusing; I shall come back to learn it from you.”  

With that, he cupped his hands and took his leave.  
Before departing, he spoke four lines:  

“Having known the road from the East,  
Do not err in returning West;  
Do not let your true nature be obscured,  
Nor linger long, forgetting home.”  

Liu Changsheng heard these words and replied with four lines of his own:  

“Empty, utterly without a thing,  
How can thoughts go astray?  
Who commands this body?  
Where is my true home?”  

Hearing this, Bodhidharma knew he was a man of cultivation,  
Said no more, and drifted away like a passing cloud.  

Meanwhile, Yuyang came south. Having spoken the dao with Changsheng in the bitter county,  
He feared that after a year apart, Changshengzi might lose his true nature amidst the smoky flowers,  
So he came to seek him, hoping to persuade him to return early to the mountains and forests.  

That day he arrived in Hangzhou, searched many courtyards but could not find him.  
Passing by one place, he saw two rouged and powdered women standing at the gate.  
He approached to inquire after Changshengzi.  

The two women smiled and asked, “Are you the Daoist who came to meet the one who bakes pancakes on his belly?”  

Yuyang found their words strange and suspected Changshengzi was inside,  
So he answered casually, “Yes, I have come to meet him.”  

One woman said, “If you want to see him, come with me.”  
She led the way inside; Yuyang followed.  

How did these two women know his purpose?  
The day before, they had seen the foreign monk wearing a broad collar and holding a shovel;  
Now seeing Yuyang similarly dressed, they guessed he came to meet that guest,  
Planning some trick. Curious, they led him in, but as they neared the gate,  
The madam shouted, and the two women left Yuyang behind and slipped out.  

Yuyang found the door half-closed and pushed it open.  
Sure enough, he saw Changshengzi dozing beside a peerless courtesan on the bed.  

Yuyang could not help but laugh. On the table was a coal brazier;  
He took it up, gently kindled the fire, and blew the sparks toward Changshengzi’s face.  
The flying embers landed on the sister’s delicate skin, burning her.  

Startled awake, she flailed her sleeves, shouting, “Who is here setting fire to me?”  

Changshengzi laughed, “The demon plays with me.”  

Yuyang also laughed, “I too play with the demon.”  

Changshengzi replied casually, “If you call me demon, then so be it.  
One demon can save us from wasting time.  
You now set fire to a woman’s face—between us, who is the greater demon?”  

Yuyang was about to converse further when Liu Changsheng said,  
“Go quickly, someone waits for you in Chu; you may together ascend the dao shore.”  

Yuyang asked, “Brother, when will you leave?”  

Changshengzi said, “When I go, I will go; no fixed date.”  

Hearing this, Yuyang bowed slightly and left the smoky flower courtyard,  
Heading toward Chu. On the way, he passed Tan Changzhen,  
Both agreed that rushing was futile, and quiet nurturing brought merit.  

Together they entered Yunmeng, cultivated for several years,  
And attained the true fruit.  

Tan Changzhen authored the “Collection of Clouds and Waters,”  
Yuyang authored the “Collection of Cloud Light.”  

Tan Changzhen ascended on the first day of the fourth month,  
Yuyang ascended on the twenty-fourth day of the fourth month.  

As for Liu Changsheng, having refined the emptiness of form in the smoky flowers,  
He left Su and Hang, returned to Eastern Lu, and entered the mountains to nurture quietly.  
In the third year of Jiatai, the year of Guihai, on the eighth day of the second month, he ascended.  
He authored the “Collection of True Cultivation.”  

Returning to Hao Taigu, who had cultivated many years on Mount Taihua,  
On the thirtieth day of the eleventh month in the year of Chouchou, he ascended,  
Authoring the “Collection of Taigu.”  

Among the Seven Perfected, four had completed their tasks;  
Only Qiu Changchun, Ma Danyang, and Sun Bu’er remained unfinished.  

Now we turn to Sun Bu’er. She cultivated bitterly in Luoyang for twelve years,  
Attaining the great dao, with transformations infinite.  

Knowing Ma Danyang guarded the home, unable to complete the dao,  
She wished to return home to instruct him.  
Yet thinking, “I have been in Luoyang so long, everyone calls me the madwoman.  
If I do not manifest the dao, how can I transform and save the hearts of men?”  

She went outside the kiln, broke two branches from trees,  
Blew two breaths of true qi, and shouted “Change!”  

The two branches transformed into a man and a woman,  
Pulling and tugging, they went into the city of Luoyang.  

The townsfolk saw the madwoman holding an unknown man,  
Running up and down the streets, embracing and clinging,  
Cursing yet unable to drive them away, beating yet unable to repel them—  
How could they not be angered?  

Moreover, Luoyang was a grand city of rites and propriety,  
How could it tolerate such disorder?  

All agreed to deal with the two, but whether they could capture her or not,  
Will be revealed in the next chapter.  

Since ancient times, streets and alleys should be serene and elegant—  
How could they allow men and women to run wild in chaos?
