# Chapter Twenty-One: Sun Buer Reveals the Dao Arts in Luoyang — Ma Danyang Meets Friends in the Western Pass

Let not the six thieves daily assail;  
All forms and hues are but emptiness.  

Realizing that originally there is not a single thing,  
The numinous platform dwells only within this heart.

It is said that Sun Buer transformed tree branches into a man and a woman, their appearances alike to living beings. Every day on the street, they clung to each other’s shoulders and necks, embracing and entwining. No beating could drive them off, no scolding could make them leave. The neighbors were helpless and together submitted a memorial:

“To all shopkeepers and residents of the city: We report in accordance with proper customs and morals, to maintain order in the neighborhood. Several years ago, a madwoman came from afar, lodging in a broken kiln outside the city. We, moved by her suffering, did not drive her away but often gave her food and drink to sustain her life. Now this madwoman is accompanied by a man; daily they cling and embrace, laughing and playing. Though repeatedly driven away, they refuse to leave. This is truly improper conduct. Luoyang is a great metropolis, a vital thoroughfare north and south. How can it bear such filth, inviting ridicule from outsiders? We earnestly hope the honorable authorities will act with integrity and eliminate this demon man and demon woman.”

The county magistrate of Luoyang, upon seeing this memorial, pondered deeply for a long while, then took up his brush and decreed:

“The so-called mad are those who have lost their original nature. If they are thought to be ignorant of human affairs, then all matters are pardoned. But now, according to this memorial, their nature is not lost; they feign madness on purpose. Men and women roaming together violate rites and propriety; clinging shoulders and embracing deeply offend public morals. To do so openly in broad daylight is shameful; at night, no words need be said to understand their intent. The neighborhood is no place for revelry; the broken kiln is no place for licentiousness. Since they cannot be driven away, their forms must be destroyed. Wait until they return to their nest, then without mercy, gather a cartload of firewood and burn it to ashes, so their kind may be utterly extinguished.”

When the decree was done, the officers conveyed it. The neighbors each took a bundle of firewood and marched toward the broken tile kiln. On the way, they saw the mad man and mad woman holding hands and entering the kiln. The crowd shouted once, then threw the firewood into the kiln. In moments, the kiln became a mountain of kindling. They set it aflame; fierce flames soared, sparks flew wildly. Suddenly, a thick smoke billowed from the kiln’s opening, transforming into five-colored auspicious clouds. Within the clouds sat three immortals. At the center sat the very madwoman who had caused chaos in the street.

The madwoman and madman, perched atop the clouds, spoke to the crowd:

“I am a cultivator, residing in Shandong, surnamed Sun, named Buer. I have hidden myself in madness here to cultivate for twelve years. Now that great achievement is complete, I intend to ascend by fire. Therefore, I transformed tree branches into a man and a woman to lead you here. Now, with your escort, I entrust this man and woman to you as proof.”

Having spoken, she pushed the two beside her off the cloud, tumbling down. The crowd hastily caught them; they were merely two forked tree branches, and all burst into laughter. Looking again, the madwoman had already entered the celestial river, her form growing faint and small. In the blink of an eye, a tiny black shadow shot upward like a crane, shrinking to the size of a coin, then a bean, and vanished. The crowd looked to the sky and bowed in reverence. Indeed, for several years afterward, the winds and rains were timely, the land abundant, and the people prosperous. Grateful for her great virtue, they built a Three Immortals Shrine, where all prayers were answered without fail.

Meanwhile, Sun Buer returned to Ninghai County in Shandong. Upon entering the village, Ma Xing immediately spotted him and hurried to greet him. Sun Buer went straight into the hall and settled in. Ma Xing went to report to the local gentleman, Ma Danyang, who came out to meet him, saying, “Dao friend Sun, you have labored hard.” Sun Buer replied, “Brother, why speak of hardship? The word ‘hardship’ is the test of cultivators. Without enduring hardship, how can one cultivate?”

As they spoke, the servants came to pay respects, and Buer comforted them kindly. That night, he sat in meditation beside Ma Danyang. Ma Danyang had to rise several times during the night, but Sun Buer sat unmoved. Ma Danyang said, “I see your sitting practice surpasses mine.” Sun Buer replied, “Not only is my sitting practice somewhat better, but my mysteries surpass yours tenfold.” Ma Danyang said, “Don’t underestimate me; I can turn stone into silver.” Sun Buer said, “You can turn stone into silver, but I can turn stone into gold. Yet gold and silver cannot transcend birth and death; they cannot make one immortal. They are ultimately useless. Long ago, Patriarch Pure Yang Lü followed Old Master Zhongli to learn the Dao. The master wrapped a heavy object in brocade, weighing dozens of pounds, and made Pure Yang carry it on his back. For three years, his shoulders wore through, yet he bore it without complaint. One day, the master ordered him to unwrap it — it was a stone. Pure Yang did not lament. The master said, ‘Though a stubborn stone, it can be turned to gold. Your three years of bearing were not in vain.’ Then with a finger, the master turned the stone into gold. He asked Pure Yang, ‘Shall I teach you the art of turning stone into gold?’ Pure Yang asked, ‘Can this gold remain unchanged forever?’ The master said, ‘The gold made by this art differs from true gold; after five hundred years, it will revert to stone.’ Pure Yang then declined, saying, ‘If so, I do not wish to learn. This art benefits for five hundred years but harms for five hundred years later. Would it not mislead those after me? Therefore, I will not learn.’ The master sighed, ‘Your Dao insight surpasses mine; your attainment should be above mine.’ By this reasoning, the art of turning stone into gold harms future generations and profits the Dao not at all.” These words left Ma Danyang silent.

Another day, Sun Buer boiled a pot of water, carried it into the room, and poured it into a bathing tub, inviting Ma Danyang to bathe. It was the eighth month, still hot by Heaven’s way. The steam rose thick and dense, impossible to touch. Ma Danyang tested it with his hand and nearly scalded himself, exclaiming, “Hard to bathe! Hard to bathe!” Sun Buer laughed, “You have cultivated for many years and lack even this skill? Let me bathe first.” Saying so, he undressed and bathed, splashing water without a word of complaint about the heat.

After bathing, he dressed and sat down. Ma Danyang said, “We share the same master and study the same Dao, using the same methods. Why is your Dao art stronger than mine?” Sun Buer replied, “Though our transmission is the same, our refining differs. I labored bitterly in Luoyang for twelve years to gain these mysteries. You stayed home enjoying ease, guarding your few rooms, never stepping out, unwilling to endure hardship or leave your nest. How could you gain such wondrous power?” Ma Danyang said, “After our master’s ascension, no one guarded the estate, so I did not venture far. Now that you have returned, I can entrust the home to you and go out to seek the Dao.” That night, he changed into Daoist robes and, before dawn, while others slept, quietly left the village unnoticed.

Seeing Danyang depart, Sun Buer thought: Since this journey must lead to attainment, what use is leaving behind so much wealth? He used it to repair bridges and roads and aid the poor. He also adopted Ma Ming’s son to continue the Ma lineage. When all was settled, he retreated to Jade Maiden Peak on Mount Tai to cultivate for several years, finally ascending on the nineteenth day of the second month.

As for Ma Danyang, leaving Ninghai County, he did not know where to go. Suddenly, he recalled his master’s tomb lay in Shaanxi and thought, “Why not travel there?” Resolving this, he journeyed westward. One day, arriving at Chang’an, he saw from afar a Dao friend emerging from a village, resembling Qiu Changchun. Thinking, “Whether or not it is him, I will call out,” he shouted, “Dao friend Qiu!” The man heard and ran swiftly forward—it was indeed Qiu Changchun. They met, exchanged greetings, and sat by the roadside. Ma Danyang asked about the places Qiu had traveled and his cultivation progress. Qiu answered, “My master’s tomb is here; I dare not stray far. I have not neglected my inner work.” Ma Danyang laughed, “Our master attained the great Dao; how could he truly die? Death is but the end of descendants’ vain hopes to become immortals, not true death. Cultivating nature is inner work; virtue is outer work. You once said inner and outer cultivation together is true mystery. You claim not to neglect your work; is this not mistaken?” Hearing this, Qiu suddenly understood and thanked Danyang, saying, “Brother, your words have illuminated my lifelong darkness. I, Qiu, am truly fortunate.” He then recounted seeing their master’s face before his passing. Danyang said, “Our master often said you cannot hide your light and always show cleverness. Your attainment will come after six others; you must beware. If you can reflect, conceal your cunning, and cultivate simplicity, I will teach you the Dao my master passed to me.” Hearing this, Changchun was overjoyed and led him to the Great Wei village to pay respects at the master’s temple. Then they went to the foot of Zhongnan Mountain, visited the tomb, and journeyed together through Jing and Xiang.

Qiu Changchun deeply repented, hiding his form and ceasing to show cleverness. Ma Danyang indeed revealed the profound mysteries to him. Qiu diligently studied the wondrous truths without slackening. Seeing the splendor of Chu’s lands inferior to Shaanxi’s simplicity, they traveled from the Xiang River to Xugu.

One day, heavy snow fell. The two were trapped in a cold temple, sharing a single straw mat in meditation. Why one mat for two? Because when Qiu first came to Ma’s village to study, he had no Daoist implements. Later, traveling south with Master Chongyang, Ma Danyang gave him his own patched robe, straw mat, and portable bell. When delivering the master’s remains, they wrapped the mat with the robe and carried it on the coffin to Shaanxi. Over the years, the robe wore threadbare, but the mat remained intact. Ma Danyang had his own felt bedding at home and never made another mat. In their hurried departure, he brought only a few changes of clothes and some small silver coins. By the time he met Qiu Changchun, his silver was gone, and he relied on Qiu’s charity. One person’s provisions had to support two, leaving no funds for a mat. Thus, they shared one mat, sitting back to back. Cultivators seek no comfort, only what suffices.

That night, heavy snow blanketed the ground three feet deep. Xugu lay amid ten thousand mountains, far from any household, with no food to be found. The two went hungry for three days and three nights. Suddenly, Qiu Changchun had a thought—what thought was it? We shall see in the next chapter.

Hunger and cold press hard, unspeakable suffering;  
How can one not be driven to wild thoughts?
