# Chapter Twenty-Three: Transforming the Violent and Returning from Evil — Discussing the Ultimate Principle, From Death to Life

Wealth and honor are like foam upon the water;  
Why bother riding a crane to Yangzhou?

At Lotus Pond there is a method to gather the heart,  
In stillness, quietly chanting seven strokes of the hook.

It is told that Qiu Changchun saw a fresh peach floating on the water. He thought his fate was to starve to death, fearing that this cluster of peaches could not be eaten. Yet now he would try, to see how it might be. With that thought, he reached out, took the fresh peach, and bit into it. The fragrance and sweetness were extraordinary. After finishing it, his spirit was greatly revived; hunger and thirst were instantly relieved. The creek water also dried up, and a red sun rose high, shining down until sweat drenched his whole body. Unable to sleep peacefully, he turned over and reflected: his fate should not be to die by the water’s edge; he must surely perish on a high mountain. Truly, this is a single thought that ensnares the demon, binding one in lifelong delusion. Therefore, those who cultivate the dao must regard the words “life” and “death” with utmost care. One must not cling stubbornly to life, nor must one desperately seek death. Life comes as it will; death comes as it will. One must not grasp at existence, nor drown in nonexistence. Thus the demon cannot possess the body, and the heart naturally finds tranquility.

Again, Qiu Changchun came to the Qinling Mountains and saw a small temple on a mountain ridge. It was a desolate place, rarely visited by people. He entered the temple, laid out his mat, and reclined upon it. He had been hungry for eight or nine days and had not drunk water. One day, as he contemplated his fleeting life, he suddenly heard voices outside. Changchun half-opened his hungry eyes to look and saw more than ten people sitting before the temple. Then he saw one person enter the temple, glance at him, and ask where he had come from. Changchun was impatient and would not answer the question, his eyes barely showing a glimmer of life. Seeing him near death, the man did not press further but went outside to join the others. Together they gathered firewood and kindling, set up a tripod of three stones with a kettle, and took a large piece of meat from a basket. They threw it into the pot to cook, then came to offer it to the gods.

After the offering, they cut the meat into small pieces, stir-fried it with seasoning, and poured it into an earthenware basin. They also brought a pot of water underneath. From the basket, they took out a bottle of wine, poured it into bowls, and—brothers in arms—they feasted and drank heartily. You might ask, who were these people? They were bandits who robbed travelers on the Qinling Mountains. Among the most notable were several heroes: one called Zhao Bi, another Li Xiong, then Zhang Jian, Wang Neng, and Zhu Jiu. Having just concluded a profitable deal, they came both to offer thanks to the gods and to divide their spoils. They arranged wine and food and gathered in a circle to eat and drink. When the wine was halfway gone, Wang Neng said to Zhao Bi, “Brother Zhao, we’ve lived a lifetime of wrongdoing. Today, shall we do some good instead?” Zhao Bi replied, “What good deed is there to do? Tell us, brother. Nothing is impossible.” Wang Neng said, “That teacher lying inside the temple is not sick. I think he’s just starving. Why don’t we cook some noodle soup for him to eat and save his life?” Brother Zhao agreed. He ordered the others to prepare it quickly.

Hearing their leader’s command, they bustled about. In no time, the noodle soup was ready. They brought it into the temple and urged Changchun to eat. Changchun refused, but they lifted him up and held his head, forcing him to drink two bowls in succession. Instantly, his belly was full and warm; life returned to him. Yet he grumbled, “Look at my great misfortune, meeting you people who offer nameless food to eat, forcing me to endure more suffering. Truly, seeking life is impossible, and seeking death takes great effort.” As Changchun spoke, he angered Zhu Jiu’s temper. Zhu drew a steel knife from his waist, angrily pointed it at Changchun, and cursed, “You wild daoist, so ignorant! We brothers saved your life, and you call our food nameless? If you want to die, we’ll gladly help you.” Saying this, he raised his knife to strike.

Qiu Changchun was not afraid at all. He patted his belly and said, “If you want to kill me, no need to strike elsewhere. Just cut open my belly. When I pull out my intestines, I will return your nameless food. I will die willingly.” After speaking, Zhu Jiu could not help but laugh and said, “You teacher truly have no head! How can you repay food once eaten? I won’t kill you. But tell me, why do you want to die? Speak so we all may hear.” Changchun then recounted how the hemp-clad physiognomist had told him he was destined to starve to death, and whether that fate could be changed. Therefore, he wished to emulate the two great sages Boyi and Shuqi, to know his destiny and obey Heaven’s will. When Changchun finished, Brother Zhao laughed, “Teacher, no need for that. Since you fear starving to death, each of us brothers will pitch in two taels of silver, more than ten taels in total. You can find a temple to live in, take on a disciple, and all work diligently to accumulate grain and rice. How could you go hungry?” Before Zhao Bi finished speaking, Zhang Jian and Li Xiong each took out a few pieces of scattered silver, about three or four taels in all. The others were about to take out silver as well, but Qiu Changchun shook his head and refused. He never took others’ wealth without cause and had a token to prove it.

He then took out the token and showed it to them. On it was written: “Those who take others’ wealth without cause will have their sinews severed; those who eat others’ food without cause will grow sores in their mouths.” Wang Neng laughed, “We brothers are glad to help you with a few taels of silver. We are not demanding it from you. How can that be ‘without cause’?” Qiu Changchun said, “Anyone who gains wealth without merit is said to have no cause. No cause means no reason. Taking others’ money and food without reason—is that not ‘without cause’?” Zhu Jiu said, “By the law, you can kill a man; by the Buddha’s law, you cannot live. We help you with a few taels, and you dare not accept. Afraid of taking wrongly? We make a living by robbing and plundering; we don’t know how great our sins are.” Qiu Changchun said, “You are different from me. In my past life, I never helped others. Therefore, in this life, I cannot accept others’ offerings. You, however, must have had debts to repay in your past lives. Those who cheated you of money now meet you on the road to collect double. If you do not collect enough, you will not meet them. Even if you pass by, you let them go lightly.”

Qiu Changchun’s words made the thirteen men shudder. Li Xiong said, “Incredible! According to this daoist, could it be that everyone owes us less? Might we not also owe others? If we owe less to others, then in another life they will come to demand from us on the road. I fear we will never be clear of debts.” Zhao Bi said, “We all have some silver on us. We can do small business to live out our days. Let us take this opportunity to change our ways and return from evil. What do you all think?” Zhu Jiu said, “Brother’s words make sense. Let us settle our hearts here.” Saying this, he threw his knife into the tangled grass. Zhao Bi then said to Changchun, “Teacher, cultivate well. We brothers will surely come to worship you as master and learn the marvelous dao.” With that, they all left.

Yet Qiu Changchun, having fallen into the demon of hunger and death, though saved by Zhao Bi and the others, still had the root of the demon within. He still wished to die. After wandering for more than a month, he gathered about two or three hundred coins, bought an iron chain and an iron lock, and carried them with him. He found a place, a temple without a road leading to it, surrounded by forest deep in the mountains, where no one came. Ancient trees soared to the sky; brambles covered the ground. He tied the chain to a large tree, fashioned a noose, then pulled it around his neck and locked it. He threw the key into the air, not knowing where it fell, and lay down beneath the tree, thinking now there was no more reason to live.

Who would have known that this act startled the celestial lord of the Great White Star in the upper realms? He transformed into a herb gatherer and approached, asking, “Teacher, what crime have you committed? Who has locked you to this tree?” He asked several times before Qiu Changchun finally spoke, “Go about your business; don’t bother with me.” The herb gatherer said, “The affairs of the world are handled by the people of the world. How can I not bother with you? I too understand the dao. Tell me your thoughts, and I will explain them clearly. Perhaps I can help ease your worries and sorrows.” Seeing the reason in his words, Changchun recounted the hemp-clad physiognomist’s prophecy of his starvation, and how he had repeatedly sought death but was rescued each time. He explained why he came here to hang himself, showing his resolve to end life and avoid rescue, saying he had no real sorrow and no need for explanation.

The herb gatherer laughed heartily, “Foolish, foolish! Such deep obsession! I feared you had worries about Heaven or Earth, but it is a single thought that has entered the demon and misled your whole life. I will tell you so that your demon may dissipate. A person’s fate is fixed for life—only ordinary people’s fate is fixed. If a great good person’s fate were fixed, it would not be so; if a great evil person’s fate were fixed, it would not be so. Fate has inner and outer aspects: there is the heart’s appearance and the face’s appearance. The outer appearance does not equal the inner. A good fate is not as good as a good heart. The appearance of a good person changes with the heart. When the heart is good, the appearance is good. Those destined to die may live long; misfortune turns to blessing; danger changes to auspiciousness. The appearance of a great evil person also changes with the heart. When the heart is evil, the appearance is evil. Those destined to end well may die badly; blessings turn to calamity; joy turns to sorrow. Thus, the secret of physiognomy says: “Long life and fortune come from loyal kindness passed down in the family; short life and misfortune come from frivolous character.” Those destined for poverty who turn to wealth do so because their hearts cherish helping the world; those destined for wealth who turn to poverty do so because their hearts seek only profit for themselves. Those destined to starve but who eat without end do so because they cherish grain and rice; those who have plenty but suffer hunger do so because they squander the five grains. Where there is flourishing blessing, the person must have the virtue of cherishing life; where there is no offspring, the heart surely lacks benevolence. This is the great outline of heart physiognomy! What can face physiognomy do? Moreover, you who cultivate the dao can manipulate creation, turn Heaven and Earth upside down, and transform a mortal body into an immortal. Is an immortal’s fate truly fixed in appearance? It all depends on the work of the heart and the awakening of understanding. As long as you can cultivate to the status of immortal, which immortal starves to death? If you act like this, in life you will starve, and in death you will become a hungry ghost. If life is useless, what benefit is death?“

These words made Qiu Changchun feel as if waking from a dream, as if darkness suddenly brightened. He realized that his long-held desire to die was like a woman’s mind—unworthy of a great man and truly shameful. He wished to unlock himself, but without the key, he did not know if he could escape. Let us see what unfolds in the next chapter.

One place not reached, one place lost in confusion.
