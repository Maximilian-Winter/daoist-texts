# Chapter Twenty-Four: When Bitter Roots Are Exhausted, All Follow the Heart’s Change — The Yin Demon Arises as Illusion, Born of Human Life

After the Lantern Festival, no more lamps remain;  
Through all eternity, only this heart shines ever bright.  

Its radiance lights the endless heavens, never extinguished,  
A brilliance pure and clear, enduring to this very day.

It is told that Qiu Changchun, upon hearing the words of the herb gatherer, felt as if awakened from a deep sleep by a sudden blow, realizing that past events were but the childish notions of a child—not the deeds of a true adult. Eager to break free from his bonds, he knew not where the key lay, and his heart grew anxious. The herb gatherer said, “The key is what I have found.” From his sleeve he drew it forth and unlocked the shackles.

Qiu Changchun said, “I am a man already dead. To be guided by your few words, to find life in the jaws of death, to be resurrected—this is a kindness beyond measure.”

The herb gatherer replied, “I have neither silver nor food to give you, only a few words to urge you. Whether you believe or not is your choice. If you believe, you may escape death; if not, life remains impossible. Life and death are your own making—what concern is it of mine? What kindness is there to speak of?”

Having said this, he drifted away like a cloud, vanishing in an instant.

From that day forth, Qiu Changchun cast aside the thought of seeking death, as if a day’s mist had been completely swept away, revealing a clear blue sky, bright sun, and boundless heavens without hindrance. Had it not been for the Jade Emperor’s righteous teaching that uprooted his demonic root, even a million heavenly soldiers or a thousand Wei Tuo guardians wielding demon-subduing staves could not have driven away his demonic obstruction nor pulled out its root.

Thus, whenever a cultivator faces demonic hindrance, one must seek its root—where it arises—and gently pluck it out at its source, effortlessly. If the demon has taken root here, but you seek its shoots elsewhere, you will never find it in a lifetime. Even if you speak all the finest words in the world, if you do not strike at the heart of his affliction, he will not be convinced.

After the herb gatherer revealed the lost path, Qiu Changchun reestablished his profound功 (merit) and resumed austere practice. One day, arriving at a place where the mountains and rivers were richly beautiful, a stream crossed the road beside him. It was midsummer; the river swelled, its surface flat and smooth, making bridge-building impossible and boat passage unfeasible. The only way was to wade across.

Nearby villagers, familiar with the water’s nature, crossed back and forth without concern; distant travelers, however, sighed by the riverbank, hesitant to ford the stream lightly.

Qiu Changchun then conceived a thought: to perform苦功 (austere功) and offer a convenience. For those unable to wade, he would carry them across; generous people gave him a few coins to buy food, enough to get by. Some took nothing and he carried them anyway.

When food was scarce, he went begging for alms—morning alms from seven households, evening alms from eight. When gathered together, if he met the hungry or cold, he gave them food, going hungry himself. If rain or snow blocked his way, he would fast all day. Over the years, he endured hunger over a hundred times. Hence the saying: “Great hunger seventy-two times, small hunger countless.”

Qiu Changchun labored thus in苦功, lodging at a cold temple at night. On its plaque were the words: “Offered by the disciples of the Xi Stream clan.” Thus he knew the river was called the Xi Stream.

Suddenly recalling Master Chongyang’s words by the Shifan Stream—that bitter roots and riches are exhausted here—he set his heart firmly, delving into the Dao’s mystery. In leisure, he sat in meditation and applied功. For six years he repeatedly endured hardship, beyond words to tell. But when the water and mountains reached their end, he was moved by kind-hearted folk who came to form good karmic ties, sparing him somewhat from hunger and cold.

Heaven does not forsake the cultivator, only fearing the sincerity of the heart.

If the heart truly suffers to awaken the Dao, why worry about clothes and food for life?

After six years of苦功, just as completion neared, the stream surged suddenly. Three men appeared, clad in military garb, each bearing a bronze blade and a severed head. They claimed to have slain great bandits and were on their way to report to the provincial government. Unfamiliar with the water, they asked to be carried across.

Changchun, intent on his苦功, could not refuse. He carried the first, then the second, across the river. When he came to the third military lord, the man was timid and trembling, saying, “I have always feared water; be careful.” Changchun said, “No fear is needed,” and took him up.

Midstream, where the current tightened, a sudden wave struck. Changchun’s footing faltered; the wave pushed him, his body flashing aside. The military lord cried out, “Alas!” clutching Changchun’s robe. In a swift motion, the severed head slipped from his grasp and fell into the water.

The military lord shouted, “What has happened? What has happened?” Changchun looked and saw the head drifting with the waves.

He hurried to shore, intending to retrieve the head. But when he turned back, the river roiled, floodwaters surged—where could he find that head? Where could he fish it out?

Seeing the military lord beating his chest and calling to Heaven and Earth in panic, Changchun’s heart grew confused and aimless.

He said to the military lord, “Bring your blade and I will cut off my own head to repay yours.”

The military lord replied, “The head fell by my own fault, not yours.”

Changchun said, “I am alone, and death would be no injustice. You have a family of many mouths to feed. If I live, I support your entire household. Is that not right?”

The military lord said, “You have a kind heart, but I cannot bear to kill you. They say a steel blade, though sharp, does not cut the innocent. If you wish to save my great matter, you must take your own life.”

Having said this, he handed the blade to Changchun. Changchun took the knife, about to slit his throat, when suddenly a voice called from the void:

“Qiu Changchun, return my blade!”

Looking up, he saw three military lords standing within five-colored auspicious clouds.

They said, “We are the Three Officials of Heaven, Earth, and Water. Seeing your steadfast Dao heart and completed苦行, we come to transform and save you. You have truly sacrificed yourself for others, accumulating功 and merit. Now we transform your mortal body into a Dao body, your illusory form into an immortal form. Six years of Dao comprehension are complete; in seven years you shall attain true realization. You must diligently advance without error.”

Suddenly, Changchun’s heart brightened; his spirit awakened. Looking at the blade in his hand, it was but a piece of morning芴 (a type of medicinal herb), not a steel knife. Among the Three Officials, one held out his empty hand—it was his morning芴. Changchun leapt upward, entering the clouds, and presented it.

The Three Officials mounted their splendid clouds and slowly departed.

Changchun was about to descend from the clouds when he recalled the Magu soldier who had once decreed he should starve to death. Now that his Dao fruit was formed, he thought he could no longer endure hunger. Why not borrow this cloud to journey east of the river and test that one’s insight?

Resolving thus, he turned the cloud and in an instant traveled a thousand li to the front of the Sai Magu estate. He alighted from the clouds and entered the manor.

There he saw a man in his twenties—the same young servant who had once brought out the meal that year. Changchun said, “I have come to seek the old gentleman’s physiognomy reading.”

The man said, “Our master has long not gone out. If you wish a reading, please follow me to the hall.”

He led Changchun inside.

Sai Magu sat in the hall. Seeing Changchun enter, he rose quickly and welcomed him with the courtesy due a guest, seating him and offering tea.

Changchun saw Sai Magu’s hair and beard were white, his frame aged and feeble, and said, “Years have passed without meeting, yet your hair has suddenly turned white.”

Sai Magu said, “I do not know where I met the Daoist before; I have forgotten in a moment.”

Qiu Changchun said, “Do you not recall the ‘Teng She Locking the Mouth’—the one doomed to starve to death?”

Upon hearing this, Sai Magu examined him and laughed heartily, “Wonderful, wonderful! The Daoist has performed great功德 somewhere, changing the former physiognomy.”

Changchun said, “You once said the face is fixed for life, never to change. How then do you now speak of change?”

The physiognomist said, “I only know how to read faces, not hearts. Now the Daoist’s face changes with the heart, beyond my knowing. Formerly, the twin lines at the mouth’s entrance were called ‘Teng She Locking the Mouth,’ indicating starvation. Now these two lines divide and circle the ‘Chengjiang’ point below the mouth, where a small red mole has grown, forming the pattern called ‘Two Dragons Presenting a Pearl,’ a sign of nobility beyond words, destined to receive imperial offerings and immeasurable blessing. How could an old fool like me understand this!”

Changchun accepted the divination as divine and took his leave.

Returning to the Shifan Stream temple to meditate, he found that a trace of calculation had stirred in his heart—he had gone to mock Sai Magu, which stirred up a demonic obstruction.

While meditating, in a trance between life and death, as if among myriad mountains, a sudden fierce wind arose, revealing a yellow-spotted fierce tiger, baring teeth and claws, leaping toward him. But he regarded death lightly, unmoved.

Later, in the deep darkness, a Dao boy appeared, saying, “My master Ma Danyang has arrived. Senior uncle, will you not rise to greet him?”

Sure enough, Danyang came from below. Changchun thought, “The Dao does not cling to feelings; come or go as it will.”

Suddenly many people appeared, saying, “Thank you for carrying us across the river. Now is the time for your reward. We have gathered over a stone of wheat, enough for a year’s food, and also two strings of coins to sew clothes.”

They placed the wheat before him in a tall heap and brought two strings of copper coins for him to receive. He paid no mind.

In a daze, a beautiful young woman of seventeen or eighteen appeared, saying she had been beaten by her stepmother and fled secretly, wishing to go to her maternal uncle’s home. But alone and weak, she begged the old master to escort her, promising deep gratitude.

Changchun paid no heed, remaining in a state of no-self, unknown and unknowing.

In a flash, his second sister-in-law came with several children, saying, “Your second brother is dead. The eldest uncle has seized the family estate, leaving your nephews and nieces without clothes or food. How can a woman like me raise them? For the sake of your elder brother’s memory and our blood ties, please help us find a way.”

The children tugged and cried, clamoring for food and drink, clawing and grabbing.

In perfect stillness, wisdom arose: as if empty of all things.

Suddenly, a loud sound echoed from the void—the South Heaven Gate opened wide.

Two boys led a white crane before him, saying, “By order of the Jade Emperor, the Perfected One is summoned to mount the crane and ascend.”

To be continued in the next chapter.
