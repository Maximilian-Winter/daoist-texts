# Chapter Twenty-Five: True Yang Dispels the Gathering Yin — The Weight of Evil Sinks a Family into Perdition

Beneath Mount Beimang, tombs lie in rows,  
Wild grasses entangle, strange birds call.  

Long sleeps the hermit by the spring terrace, unawakened,  
Peach blossoms fallen, plum petals faded past the Pure Brightness.  

Thus the tale unfolds: Qiu Changchun sat in meditation within the Fanxi Temple, diligently applying his practice. In the midst of profound stillness, suddenly two young attendants appeared, guiding a white crane before him, saying, “By imperial decree, the True Man is summoned to mount the crane and ascend.”  

Qiu Changchun pondered deeply the words of the Three Officials Great Emperors. Seven years of cultivation to attain truth were due to bear fruit; how could there be a sudden flight to the heavens this very day? Could it be that the shadowy demons of his own mind assailed him, conjuring such illusions to undermine his true dao? With this single insight, the two attendants vanished, the white crane disappeared, and he found himself alone, seated on half a mat. Outside, stars and moonlight mingled, all sounds hushed. Truly, from nowhere arose these strange and eerie visions. Had his thoughts not held firm, he might have erred by a hair’s breadth and lost the path by a thousand miles. He reproached himself for rashly testing the magic of the Hemp-Clad One, deliberately inviting many shadowy demons. Without refining away the yin energies, how could pure yang be attained? Reflecting further, he resolved that only by employing this method of mingling with the demons could he exhaust the gathering yin, leaving no gap for them to exploit — this was the supreme strategy.  

Thus, he left Fanxi and came to a humble earthen hill. Below the slope lay a round stone weighing a hundred catties, a quiet and secluded spot. There he made a grass mat base and sat in meditation. When the yin demons discovered him, they would rush over, and he would move the round stone up the hill, then let it fall back down, returning to sit in stillness. This scene repeated, and he moved the stone to confuse them. For three years thus, the yin demons retreated entirely, his body suffused with pure yang. All such visions vanished from mortal eyes; his spiritual clarity shone forth like the rising sun; Heaven’s secrets naturally unfolded. He sensed a story hidden within, but the heavenly mysteries could not be revealed outright. He must first enlighten others, so that if they awaken, they might avoid this ruin and not lose Heaven’s gracious favor, opening the gate to salvation. Having resolved this, he left the earthen hill to carry out this task.  

Now, in the land of Kanlong, there lived a wealthy man surnamed Wang, named Yun. His household was rich and grand, and all called him Lord Wang, a true master of wealth. Nestled by mountain and water, he enjoyed the blessings of encircling hills and flowing streams, with a creek running before his gate. Though Wang Yun possessed vast private riches, his heart was cruel and mean. He habitually used heavy scales and small measures, weighing people unfairly, always bullying the poor and weak, seizing fields and lands. His servants, emboldened by his power, acted like foxes borrowing tiger’s might, dogs relying on their masters’ influence, cheating the village simpletons. They were knaves without limit, wielding their master’s prestige to commit crimes vast as the sky, yet remained unaware of their sins.  

Outside his gate stood a great stone over a yard tall, several feet wide, its head large and tail small, shaped like a lion. Thus it was called the Stone Lion. Many laborers worked nearby, and at mealtimes, the gate guards would perch on the lion’s back and strike a wooden clapper, the sound echoing all around, signaling the return for meals — a common custom. Not far off was a hillside upon which stood a Guanyin Temple, built by Wang Yun’s ancestors, who had donated land and appointed a custodian. But when Wang Yun took charge, he drove away the custodian and reclaimed the land, though he did not demolish the temple or break the deity’s statues — a faint trace of kindness remained. Yet the temple became a cold and desolate place.  

Qiu Changchun, having journeyed from Baoji, took shelter in this temple. Each time he heard the clapper, he would offer alms, giving charity many times, but no one paid him any heed. Not a soul responded. He could not even secure a drop of water. Only a maid named Chunhua, seeing him come and go empty-handed, felt pity. Secretly, she hid some candies and slipped them into his sleeve, whispering, “Old master, leave quickly; this is no place of kindness.”  

Two days later, Qiu Changchun came again to offer alms and found Wang Yun standing at the gate. Changchun intended to enlighten him, but seeing him there, he spoke four verses to move his heart:  

> Greed for fame and profit turns no gaze back;  
> Though gold and silver adorn, none can be taken along.  
> One day, impermanence halts all affairs,  
> Leaving but two eyes to weep long and deep.  

Having finished, Wang Yun burst into anger, “You wild Daoist, stop your nonsense here! I have never believed in Buddha’s teachings. You’d best leave now to avoid insult.”  

Changchun replied, “I come humbly to your mansion to offer alms, giving what I can to the worthy.”  

Wang Yun noticed a basket outside, filled with horse dung, and a shovel nearby. He scooped a shovel-full and approached Changchun, saying, “You ask me for charity; how about I give you this?”  

Changchun, testing his heart, saw this was mockery and pushed forward his stone dipper. Wang Yun truly poured the dung into it.  

Changchun said, “What use have I for horse dung?”  

Wang Yun replied, “This dung was gathered by hired hands. Today, I give it to you; consider it my charity.”  

Changchun praised, “Well said, well said.” Wang Yun and his servants laughed heartily. Hearing this, the whole family laughed too — except Chunhua, whose heart was troubled.  

One day, seeing the servants go up the hill to work, Chunhua secretly hid some distilled liquor in her sleeve and stepped outside. She happened upon Changchun standing at the gate and wished to give it to him. Changchun said, “I am not here for liquor. I have an important word for you. Remember it well: when the eyes of the Stone Lion at the gate turn red, you must flee to the Guanyin Temple on the hill and hide there for a time of three quarters of an hour to be safe.” Saying this, he vanished like a drifting cloud, never to be seen again.  

Chunhua kept these words close to her heart, coming out twice daily to watch the Stone Lion. Months passed until a herdboy noticed and asked, “Sister Chunhua, why do you come out every day to look at the Stone Lion?”  

She answered, “The alms-giving master told me that when the Stone Lion’s eyes turn red, I must quickly flee to the Guanyin Temple to avoid great calamity.”  

The herdboy, amused, secretly found some red earth. One afternoon, as he herded cattle home, he climbed the Stone Lion and painted two round circles on its face, like a pair of eyes. Then he slipped away to watch the outcome.  

As dusk fell, Chunhua suddenly felt her heart race and her eyes dart, restless and uneasy. She thought, “Could it be the Stone Lion’s eyes have turned red?” She rushed outside, ignoring her master’s shouts, and saw the Stone Lion’s eyes glowing crimson. Terrified, she fled to the Guanyin Temple. The herdboy followed.  

Inside the temple, just as he prepared to question her, a sudden thunderclap shook the earth, followed by wild winds and black clouds filling the sky. In an instant, a torrential downpour fell like a great overturned bucket, pouring until midnight before easing. Chunhua and the herdboy crouched beneath the altar, ears filled with the roar like a thousand drums, like ten thousand horses stampeding.  

At dawn, they dared to emerge and behold the scene. What had seemed a small matter before now struck terror to their souls. Wang Yun’s estate had been swept away by the waters. No one knew when the flood had come, but a dragon had passed there, seeing the grand house and proceeding to the Crystal Palace. Only the Stone Lion refused to leave, lying toppled in the river’s midst.  

Chunhua, heart aching at the ruin of Wang Yun’s family, wept bitterly. Soon, neighbors and villagers gathered, all declaring, “Heaven has eyes; retribution is swift.” Seeing Chunhua weeping, they asked, “Your master’s whole family is destroyed; how did you escape with your life?”  

Chunhua recounted the Daoist’s warning. The villagers debated, agreeing that Wang Yun’s evil deeds had piled high, and the flood was Heaven’s punishment. The Daoist must have been a true immortal who came to warn him, but Wang Yun refused to repent and thus was swept away. Though a mere maid, Chunhua had some good roots, so she was saved, along with the herdboy. It seemed that in life between Heaven and Earth, one must do good deeds, for when disaster comes, a savior appears.  

They asked Chunhua what she would do now. She said, “This temple was built by my old master, and the surrounding lands were donated to it. Now I live here, letting my hair grow and cultivating the Way. I no longer desire the colorful world or the pleasures of the red dust.”  

The villagers said, “That is good. We will gather some provisions to help you through, and after the autumn harvest, you will have enough to eat.”  

So they collected money and grain for Chunhua and found an old woman to keep her company. Chunhua thanked them and devoted herself wholeheartedly to diligent cultivation. After several years, Qiu the True Man, resting in the Dragon Gate Cave, sensed her sincere heart toward the dao and came to guide her. She then took him as her master and later attained the true fruit.  

Meanwhile, after instructing Chunhua, Qiu Changchun entered the mountains of Longzhou and found a stone cliff with a cave. This was the place where, at the end of the Qin and beginning of the Han, Master Lou Jing fixed the positions of sun and moon. Below flowed a winding creek, and the cliff hung over the water’s curve. From afar, the cliff seemed to span the creek, and the cave looked like a gate. At that time, scholars prized success in the imperial examinations. Seeing this mountain cave like a gate, they named it Dragon Gate, symbolizing the carp leaping through the gate to become dragons.  

Arriving here, Changchun finally understood the phrase “dragons flying upon the gate” and began to cultivate his nature and refine his truth within the cave’s entrance.  

Within two years, Longzhou suffered drought. The prefect led the people in prayers, but rain did not fall. Crops withered, and the people despaired. Qiu Changchun came to the prefecture, declaring he could pray for three days of sweet rain to save all the people. The prefect rejoiced and invited him to ascend the altar.  

Dressed in solemn robes, Changchun bowed before the altar, focusing his mind and sincerity to communicate with the Jade Emperor. Indeed, torrents poured down for three days and nights. The fields flourished, and the people found peace.  

The following year, the northern provinces suffered great drought. The heavens withheld rain for long. The emperor and officials prayed but to no avail. The Yuan Shun Emperor issued an edict, posting a proclamation seeking those with the dao who could pray for rain. Those who succeeded would receive high rank and great reward.  

The imperial proclamation hung, known throughout the provinces. The Longzhou prefect recommended a man who could pray for rain, though none knew who he was. The story continues below.
