# Chapter Twenty-Six: Praying for Rain to Turn the Heavens and Reverse the Sun; Employing Marvelous Arts to Exchange the Phoenix and Steal the Dragon

A single fragment of utmost sincerity can move Heaven itself,  
Turning a year of calamity into one of abundance.  

Do not say the Primordial Sovereign loves the people most deeply—  
Rather, it is the true Daoist’s wondrous mystery.  

---

The tale begins with the Yuan Shun Emperor posting an imperial edict, seeking those whose dao practice is pure and lofty to pray for rain’s blessing. The governor of Longzhou submitted a memorial to the capital, stating: “In Longzhou’s Dragon Gate, the noble recluse Qiu Changchun’s dao and virtue are lofty and pure. Last year, Long Prefecture suffered drought, but thanks to his power, he prayed and obtained sweet rain, saving all the people. Now the Emperor wishes to seek rain to relieve the people’s hardship; none but this man will do. I, with a heart to rescue the people, thus report this.”  

The Yuan Shun Emperor read the memorial and his dragon heart rejoiced greatly. He immediately commanded Minister Hali Tuotu to visit Changchun. Soon, the minister arrived at Dragon Gate, presented jade and silk, and conveyed the sovereign’s intent. Changchun gladly accepted the summons and accompanied the minister to the capital. The next day, he was presented before the Primordial Sovereign. The Yuan Shun Emperor honored him as a master, seating him above the nine ministers, entrusting him with the task of praying for rain.  

Changchun reported: “Your Majesty’s concern for the people is heartfelt; how could I not exert my humble strength? Yet, two conditions must be set high: Your Majesty must personally incense and worship, then I shall pray to the Supreme Deity, and within three days rain will fall.”  

The Emperor was greatly pleased, immediately ordering officials to arrange the matter, and sent eunuchs to escort Changchun to lodge at the Jixian Pavilion.  

The next morning at court, officials reported that the rain altar had been established, and Master Duan Hou ascended the altar. The Emperor declared that Changchun join him there. The Son of Heaven respectfully burned incense and worshipped. After the rites, the imperial carriage returned to the palace. Changchun prostrated himself before the rain altar, praying earnestly.  

By the third day, at the hour of noon and afternoon, the red sun blazed overhead like a fiery wheel, scorching the earth until dust rose everywhere, and all people sweated profusely. Changchun took a willow branch, dipped it in purified water, and sprinkled it toward the red sun. Soon, a streak of black vapor appeared at the sun’s edge, swiftly transforming into clouds that veiled the fiery orb. In an instant, the sky darkened and the earth dimmed; heavy rain poured down for several days, turning dryness to abundance, decay to spring’s renewal. The people rejoiced, and all living things benefited.  

The Yuan Shun Emperor’s dragon heart was filled with joy. He ennobled Changchun as the Grand Daoist True Man, inviting him to reside in the capital with the honors of a high guest.  

One day, the Yuan Shun True Man entered the palace and strolled to the imperial gardens. Within this garden grew evergreen grasses that never withered, flowers that never faded, strange stones and wondrous trees beyond naming. The Emperor and True Man sat upon a living rock, discoursing on the dao and mysteries, while five-colored auspicious clouds hovered above like a splendid canopy.  

At a subtle point in their discourse, the Emperor sighed: “If I were not heir to the great succession, I would follow Chi Songzi to wander the mountains. Once I have an heir, I shall certainly take you as master and enter the mountains to cultivate.”  

True Man Qiu replied: “Your Majesty need not worry. The Empress is already with child of the dragon embryo; soon she will bear the Crown Prince.”  

The Emperor pondered secretly, knowing the True Man was indeed a transcendent, for he had divined the pregnancy in the harem. He responded casually: “The Empress is indeed with child, but I do not know if it is a boy or a girl.”  

True Man said: “I have already calculated—it is a boy, without the slightest error.”  

The Emperor said: “If as you say, it is my great fortune.”  

The True Man withdrew. The Yuan Shun Emperor returned to the palace and told the Empress: “True Man Qiu has divined that you carry the dragon embryo. I do not know if it is true or false.”  

The Empress replied: “How could he divine so accurately? Why not summon the National Master to the hall and have him divinate alongside the True Man? Only if their words agree can it be certain.”  

The Emperor rejoiced greatly. The next day, he summoned the White Cloud Chan Master from White Cloud Temple to the hall, to divinate with True Man Qiu whether the Empress’s pregnancy was male or female.  

The White Cloud Chan Master counted on his fingers and said: “According to my calculation, Her Majesty carries the phoenix embryo, surely to bear a princess.”  

The Emperor again asked True Man Qiu, who answered: “Yesterday I explained clearly to Your Majesty—the Empress carries the dragon embryo and will bear the Crown Prince. Why ask again?”  

The Chan Master laughed: “Since you are enlightened, you must know the principles of numbers. Calculate once more.”  

True Man said: “Whether I calculate or not, it is still the dragon embryo, surely a boy.”  

The Chan Master was angry: “My calculations are flawless. How dare you speak recklessly and disturb the sacred virtue!”  

True Man said: “Numbers are not as reliable as Heaven’s principle. Yin virtue has the power to turn the heavens; good deeds have the merit to defy numbers. Now the Sovereign himself prays for rain, saving all people, insects, and plants alike—this is great yin virtue. Perhaps Heaven is moved, turning female into male, transforming phoenix into dragon—it cannot be known.”  

The Chan Master said: “I consider you a man of the dao, yet you are ordinary. The pregnancy precedes the prayer for rain; how can the embryo change after formation?”  

True Man said: “I have already predicted it; why argue further?”  

The Chan Master said: “Do you dare to bet with me?”  

True Man said: “If a bet is to be made, so be it—what is there to fear?”  

The Chan Master said: “If it is the dragon embryo, I will forfeit White Cloud Temple to you.”  

True Man said: “If it is the phoenix embryo, I will forfeit my head to you.”  

The Chan Master laughed: “Do not regret later.”  

True Man said: “One word shall settle it; no regrets.”  

The Chan Master said: “Words alone are not proof; we must write a contract as evidence.”  

True Man immediately requested paper and brush before the imperial desk. He wrote: “I, Qiu Changchun, wager my head to White Cloud Chan Master. If the Empress bears a phoenix, I will lose and consent to be beheaded without dispute.”  

The Chan Master also wrote: “I, White Cloud Monk, wager White Cloud Temple to Qiu Changchun. If the Empress bears a dragon, I will lose and surrender White Cloud Temple without dispute.”  

After writing, they sealed the documents and exchanged them, each reading aloud once. They then presented the contracts to the imperial desk. The Yuan Shun Emperor’s dragon eyes examined them and personally preserved them, awaiting the Empress’s delivery to reveal the truth. That day’s court ended, and all returned to their places.

The White Cloud Chan Master returned to White Cloud Temple, thinking of Qiu Changchun’s boldness. Could it be that the Empress truly carries the dragon embryo? Was my calculation mistaken? Uneasy, he recalculated but found no error. Secretly pleased, he muttered: “Qiu Changchun, you brought this disaster upon yourself, losing your life despite your cultivation.”  

Meanwhile, True Man Qiu returned to Jixian Pavilion, fixing the Empress’s delivery date. He spent a divine talisman and borrowed from the Nine Heavens’ Female Palace a divine maiden named Jade Chaste Fairy, who possessed boundless transformations and vast powers. This fairy came under the command of the Nine Heavens’ Holy Mother to obey True Man Qiu’s orders.  

Qiu respectfully said: “At the hour of the Ox tonight, the princess will be born at Prince Ning’s mansion. You may transform the gourd into a baby girl, exchange her for the boy, and hold him at the Golden Throne. After I swap the phoenix, you shall return the gourd.”  

The fairy obeyed and went to carry out the plan.  

At midnight, the Empress gave birth—a daughter, confirming the White Cloud Chan Master’s phoenix embryo prediction. Officials reported to the Emperor, who greatly admired the Chan Master’s accurate calculation but worried for True Man Qiu’s life, resolving to save him—that is the way of a ruler.  

An early court was convened. Officials, knowing the Empress had borne a princess, came to congratulate. The White Cloud Chan Master also congratulated, saying: “I heard the Empress bore the Crown Prince, continuing the sacred line. I am overjoyed and wish the Emperor long life and the Crown Prince eternal reign.”  

The Yuan Shun Emperor sighed: “My fate lacks an heir, which is no regret. Yet True Man Qiu erred in yin and yang calculation and must pay. But considering his prayer for rain, I wish to save him. I shall donate one hundred thousand from the imperial treasury to compensate White Cloud Temple, redeeming True Man’s head.”  

As the Emperor spoke, the Chan Master was still pondering. A palace official reported that True Man Qiu had come to court. The Emperor ordered him summoned.  

True Man Qiu bowed and congratulated the Emperor: “The Empress bore the dragon embryo; I come to congratulate Your Majesty.”  

The Emperor said: “You erred; the Empress bore a daughter.”  

True Man said: “My calculation is flawless. If it is a girl, please bring her to me for inspection; I will gladly die.”  

The Emperor wished to protect him but was displeased at his obstinacy. He summoned a palace maid to bring out the baby. It was now the hour between Tiger and Rabbit. The divine maiden transformed the gourd into a baby girl, exchanged her for the boy, and concealed the divine radiance, waiting at the Golden Throne. The palace maid carried the baby girl before the Emperor and handed her to True Man Qiu.  

Qiu took the child with both hands, covering her with his robe sleeve. The divine maiden had already swapped dragon for phoenix, sending the boy to the prince’s mansion. The officials, being mortal eyes, could not perceive this. The White Cloud Chan Master had some wisdom but no divine power; how could he know?  

True Man Qiu employed this art of stealing the dragon and exchanging the phoenix, holding the boy aloft and inviting all officials to see whether it was boy or girl. After viewing, all cried out: “Long live the Crown Prince!”  

The White Cloud Chan Master’s face paled with anger. He rushed forward, took the child, and saw clearly it was a boy, not a girl. His face flushed red, and he had no choice but to congratulate the Emperor: “Indeed, the Crown Prince is born.”  

Having seen the boy, the Emperor marveled and immediately changed his words: “I heard palace reports but did not see the child myself, thus mistakenly thought it a girl—this was the palace’s error.”  

He ordered the Ministry of Works to hold a banquet for three days and proclaimed a general amnesty. The Emperor withdrew from the hall, and civil and military officials dispersed.  

True Man Qiu asked the White Cloud Chan Master: “What does your master say?”  

The Chan Master said: “Once words are spoken, even four horses cannot chase them back. Tomorrow I will hand over the temple to you; you move in, I move out; all will be settled. What instructions do you have?”  

After speaking, they each returned to their temples.  

True Man Qiu returned to his pavilion. The divine maiden came to return the gourd and ascended to the Nine Heavens.  

The White Cloud Chan Master returned to White Cloud Temple, still dissatisfied. He recalculated but found no error. He sighed: “The chess master’s one superior move is hard to defeat; the weaker skill loses three points in the cycle.”  

A servant beside the Chan Master said: “Qiu Changchun is alone; how can he occupy so large a temple? We must match one for one, exchange one for one. If we cannot match or exchange all, we shall remain and slowly reason it out.”  

The Chan Master was greatly pleased upon hearing this. The next day, True Man Qiu arrived. The Chan Master said: “The monks are many and the temple wide; you come with one, I go with one; one for one, if we cannot finish exchanging, we cannot leave. Monks stay, daoists stay.”  

True Man said: “Excellent! This is how it should be. I will call them in from the mountain front.”  

With that, he left the mountain gate, took a dust whisk from his sleeve, plucked some brown hairs from it, and tossed them into the air. What will happen next? Let us see in the next chapter.
