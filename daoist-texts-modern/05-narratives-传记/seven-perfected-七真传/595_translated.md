# Chapter Twenty-Seven: Exhorting the Dao Assembly with Earnest Admonitions — A Layered Discourse on Cultivation

The blossoms fall and bloom again, another year has passed;  
How often in life does one see the moon perfectly full?

Unlock the chains of fame and gain,  
In blazing fire, a lotus is well sown.

It is said that Master Qiu stepped forth from the mountain gate, and within his sleeve took out a dust whisk. Silently, he plucked some of the brown hairs from the whisk, breathed forth true qi, and cast them into the air. The wind scattered them far and wide, their resting place unknown. In an instant, countless Daoists arrived, following Master Qiu inside, replacing all the monks within the temple. The venerable Master Baiyun at once took residence in the Xian Hall where Master Qiu dwelled. The monks dispersed to various temples for lodging. You may wonder why Master Qiu insisted on taking over the Baiyun Temple? It was because in the capital region, the local royal qi was at its peak. Such a place of gathering, he wished to open a platform here and expound the teachings. Meanwhile, Master Baiyun was destined to rise in the south, to spread the Dao across the Three Rivers region. If he remained guarding Baiyun Temple in the capital, it would be difficult to unfold his mission. Thus, the temple was seized so that Baiyun could journey southward to universally save sentient beings. Hence, each True Person of Heaven and Earth has their proper place—what benefits one may harm another, what aids one may hinder another. The superior cultivator must choose the place that corresponds and nurtures, and avoid those that oppose or obstruct. This is called obtaining the advantage of the land.

Meanwhile, Master Qiu gathered Dao companions at Baiyun Temple. Within less than one month, dozens of Dao friends arrived. They took up various offices and duties, and soon the place buzzed with lively activity. Seeing that among the Dao friends some were wise and others less so, Master Qiu felt compelled to instruct them.

Master Qiu addressed the assembly: “To renounce the world as a monastic is to leave behind dust and vulgarity! One must first harbor a resolute intention to see through worldly affairs and a heart to seek the Dao in seclusion; only then can one be said to truly renounce the world with sincerity. If one rashly hopes to become an immortal, or out of anger or craving for ease takes monastic vows, this is but using the Dao as a pretext to settle one’s body. Hence, a fierce and impetuous mind arises, but a long-term heart is hard to find; the Dao becomes something optional, and thus the profound mystery is ultimately lost. There are also those who lost their support in youth and, lonely in old age, take monastic vows—not out of seeing through the world, but merely to find shelter in our gate. What insight is there in that? In sum, those who come, let them settle in peace. Whether they see through or not, having come to the Three Treasures’ place, they are all destined by fate. Those who enter our gate do not become destitute; those who leave do not grow rich. Having entered, one must embody our heart: the superior ones revere the mystery and sit in meditation; the middle ones observe rites and proclamations; the lower ones do hard work and labor—thus fulfilling the affairs of renunciates. What others cannot do, I strive to do; what others cannot endure, my heart endures. The able sever desires; the enduring bear hunger and cold. Thus, one surpasses ordinary men. One must keep the heart empty, allowing no slightest obstruction, nor the rise of a single bias. Not only no other, but no self—if there is no self, whence comes the demon? Seek the Dao in this void and nothingness, and the work will naturally come. If one sits in meditation as mere fabrication, one loses the true Dao. In all matters, measure your strength; do not overreach or fall short. Recognize the great and accomplish the great; recognize the small and accomplish the small. Follow the string and compass, abide by rules and standards. Though one may not become an immortal or Buddha, one will not fail to be a good person—thus not wasting one’s renunciation. If one only knows that tying the hair is the Dao, or shaving the head is becoming a monk, yet the five aggregates are not extinguished, the four marks not forgotten; outwardly adorned in robes and crowns, inwardly scarcely different from beasts—hearts clinging to fame and gain, minds ever grasping right and wrong, thoughts of luxury only fearing clothes and food fall short of others, hoping all deeds go as wished—such a person, though called renunciate, has not truly renounced. The name ‘Dao’ is utterly absent. Compared thus, one might as well return to secular life, choosing suffering as pleasure. Why linger long in the mysterious gate, making the Dao a livelihood, committing boundless offenses? If in this life one cannot transcend, in the next one will still fall into the sea of suffering. The blessings of this life are not gained, yet the sins of the next are already sown. One must deeply reflect!”

As Master Qiu spoke these earnest words, more than ten tall, robust men arrived outside the mountain gate. Who were these men? They were the brave fellows who once rescued the True Person on Mount Qinling—Zhao Bi, Wang Neng, Zhu Jiu, and others, a band of brothers. They came to Baiyun Temple. Long ago, they had saved Master Qiu’s life on Mount Qinling. The True Person had spoken to them of the debts of sin and blessing, awakening them to reform. Each had turned from evil, taken up a modest trade, and wandered the Youyan region, eking out a living for more than ten years.

Zhao Bi, Li Xiong, and Zhang Jian had grown old; only Wang Neng and Zhu Jiu still bore no beard. Hearing that Baiyun Temple housed a Master Qiu, a man of the Dao, who last year prayed for sweet rains to save all beings, and later foretold the birth of the imperial heir, winning the temple from Master Baiyun in a wager, and now widely recruited those who cultivate the Dao and expound the scriptures—they rejoiced. Zhao Bi said, “Years ago, we saved that old teacher on Mount Qinling, who bore the inscription ‘Follow Master Qiu.’ Could it be he has now attained the Dao? Why not go to Baiyun Temple to see for ourselves?” Zhang Jian said, “We often seek out men of the Dao; perhaps now our wish will be fulfilled.” Zhu Jiu said, “If he has Dao and virtue, we shall bow to him as master and become disciples.” Zhao Bi said, “Brother Zhu’s words are most forthright.”

So they came to Baiyun Temple, just as Master Qiu and the Dao friends sat in the great hall courtyard, discussing the words of renunciation and study. Seeing them enter, Master Qiu rose and said, “Good fellows, long time no see! How have you fared?” Zhao Bi and the others did not recognize Master Qiu at once. They asked hurriedly, “By Heaven’s grace, we have found peace. You, the old teacher, we met once but forgot your name. May we ask for your identification?” Master Qiu said, “Do you not remember the hungry Daoist on Mount Qinling?” Zhao Bi said, “Are you the Daoist who once guided our old teacher?” Master Qiu said, “If not me, then who?” Hearing this, Zhao Bi and the others knelt and bowed, saying, “More than ten years have passed since then. We have all grown old and frail; your countenance has changed little, truly a man of the Dao! You once said that after you attained the Dao, we should come to join you. We hope you will accept us, and we wish to become your disciples. What say you, master?”

Master Qiu said, “I have not forgotten the life-saving kindness. If I say I have attained the Dao, I have in truth gained nothing—only relied on the Dao to enlighten the world. Alas! The sea of suffering is boundless; turning back is the shore. My words were meant to warn myself, yet who could have known that upon hearing them, you brave fellows would cleanse your hearts, courageously reform, and remain steadfast for more than ten years? Now you see through the red dust and wish to renounce the world; this is indeed a joyful matter. But having come to renounce, you must all have accumulated good deeds in past lives to give rise to this thought. Though you vow to be monks or Daoists, you must strictly follow the laws and teachings, with compassion and humility, respecting all. Do not let your nature run wild, nor let myriad false thoughts arise. You must give up self and follow others. Above all, avoid harming life. Do not think yourself inferior and thus kindle jealousy; do not say others are less than you and thus foster disdain. Do not let competitiveness oppress others; do not raise arrogant thoughts. ‘I am not as good as he’ means your cultivation is not yet sufficient; ‘He is not as good as me’ means his time has not come. The Dao knows no great or small; officials know no rank or status. No matter rich or poor, noble or humble, high or low, old or young, the one with Dao is great; the one with virtue is honored. The diligent learner is like gold and jade; the unlearned like grass and thatch. We do not sell gold, silver, or treasures; we value benevolence, righteousness, and the Dao. The emperor who renounces is not noble; the beggar who renounces is not base. In my youth, having lost my support, I was raised by elder brothers and knew I had no part with the red dust. Wholeheartedly I sought the Dao and cultivated the True. I met my master, the True Person Chongyang, who imparted the supreme Dao. I was also deeply guided by senior brother Ma Danyang. After separating from Xiegu, I strove hard, starving seven thousand two hundred times, nearly dying; countless times little hunger and suffering—all hardships told. Yet my heart was like iron and stone, willing to die rather than retreat from my original resolve. The more suffering I endured, the stronger my will became. I worked hard for six years in Fanxi; the hardships are beyond words. As the saying goes, after bitterness comes sweetness. One day I suddenly awakened and Heaven’s favor descended. I prayed repeatedly for rain, and sweet dew fell. My fame spread through the empire; I was summoned to the court. Though it is said ‘the Dao fruit is not yet complete,’ to reach this stage is no easy matter. Since you wish to renounce, keep this thought: do not let wealth or honor move your heart, nor poverty or lowliness shift your resolve. Regard my body as one who has died and now lives again. Arise with a great intention to seek the method of immortality; only then can you be called a Perfected Person.”

When Master Qiu finished speaking, Zhao Bi and the others wept bitterly, moved by the memory of the True Person’s hardships in cultivation. Master Qiu said, “Until one reaches the utmost of suffering, the tongue’s root is not exhausted, and wisdom is hard to open. Now I wish you to seek it in suffering. Endure one measure of hardship, and one measure of demon obstruction will retreat; endure ten measures of hardship, and all demonic qi will vanish.” When the True Person finished speaking, he selected an auspicious day to confer caps and tie hair, each taking a Dao name, which need not be recorded here.

Meanwhile, the Empress pondered: I gave birth to what was clearly a girl, but when carried out of the palace, she spun about and became a boy. She lost the great Baiyun Temple to Master Qiu—this calamity all comes from me alone. Fearing Master Baiyun’s heart would be troubled, she ordered a palace attendant to summon the Chan Master to the palace to comfort him, saying, “Because of this child, my master has suffered.” Master Baiyun said, “The calculations show it is a phoenix, but I do not know by what sorcery Master Qiu changed it into a boy. I fear this is not a blessing for the realm.” The Empress said, “The emperor worries about lack of an heir; I dare not speak deeply. The sovereign cherishes this child as a deity and every day lectures on the Dao and mysteries in the imperial garden, rarely returning to the palace.” Master Baiyun said, “In the Tang Minghuang’s reign, the court praised Zhang Guo as an immortal. Minghuang put poison in wine and made Zhang Guo drink it thrice. Zhang Guo said, ‘Wine is no good wine; food is no good food.’ Then he fainted for a moment, his teeth all blackened. Upon waking, he sought the iron ruyi scepter before the throne and knocked out all the black teeth. After a moment, his new white teeth grew in, and only then did Minghuang believe he was truly an immortal descended. Why does Your Majesty not imitate this story? Place poisoned wine on the table and have Master Qiu drink it. If he drinks and does not die, then he is truly an immortal.” The Empress, hearing this, was greatly pleased and ordered the attendant to announce it. What will happen when Master Qiu drinks the wine? Wait for the next chapter to unfold.

A little cunning applied, even immortals cannot escape.
