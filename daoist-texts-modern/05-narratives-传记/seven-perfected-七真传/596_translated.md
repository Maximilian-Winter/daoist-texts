# Chapter Twenty-Eight: The Empress Tests the Way with Poisoned Wine — The True Man Wearing the Golden Crown Recites a Poem

The elixir perfected through nine transformations is pure yang throughout,  
Entering the sage realm, transcending the mundane, life prolonged.  

Without a single twist and turn,  
How could one’s name endure through ten thousand ages?

It is told that the Empress, having heard the words of the Chan Master of White Clouds, ordered her palace attendants to summon True Man Qiu from White Cloud Temple. Meanwhile, she prepared poisoned wine in secret, ready to test him. The palace eunuchs, bearing the Empress’s command, came to escort the True Man into the palace. The True Man, already aware of her intent, instructed Zhao, Li, and the others to prepare twenty-four jars of cool, pure water, arranged in a perfect line. “When I return,” he said, “there will be a marvelous use for them. Do not fail me, lest my plan be spoiled.” Having given these orders, he accompanied the eunuchs into the palace to pay respects to the imperial presence.

The Empress said, “Earlier, the True Man predicted that I would bear a Crown Prince. Indeed, his words came true. I have no way to repay this favor, so I command that three cups of the imperial wine be granted to him, as a small token of respect.” Having spoken, she ordered the eunuchs to present the wine before the True Man. Qiu did not refuse, drinking all three cups in succession. After taking his leave of the Empress, he returned to White Cloud Temple.

There, he saw the twenty-four jars of clear water lined beneath the corridor. Without hesitation, the True Man leapt into the first jar, immersing himself in the cold water. In an instant, the water heated. Rising, he jumped into the second jar, which too grew warm. One after another, he plunged into the jars—twenty-three in all. When he reached the twenty-fourth jar, the water was not yet filled to the brim, barely covering his chest. The poison’s venom was not yet exhausted; the toxic fire surged upward, scorching the hair on his heavenly forehead, stripping away a patch three fingers wide. From afar, it appeared as if he wore the half-shaven head of a Daoist adept.

Meanwhile, the Chan Master of White Clouds, having heard that True Man Qiu was still alive, came again to the palace to report to the Empress. She said, “He drank the poisoned wine and did not die—surely he is a true immortal, without doubt.” The Chan Master replied, “Perhaps the poison was not strong enough to kill him; that is possible. I have heard that immortals can overcome the five metals and eight stones. All gold, silver, copper, and iron in their hands become like mud. To be expedient, they take forms; to be perfect, they take forms. The Daoist school has the ‘kerchief’ and the ‘crown’: the kerchief covers the hair, the crown binds the hair. Though feigning ignorance, it all comes down to kerchief and crown. Your Majesty, please bestow upon him a golden crown, a single ingot of pure gold to wear upon his head. If he can wear it steadily, then he is truly an immortal. If it wobbles, we shall all have a laugh, and he will be embarrassed, unable to face anyone, surely retreating to the mountains and forests.”

The Empress, delighted by this suggestion, sent the eunuchs once more to summon True Man Qiu into the palace. The True Man accompanied the attendants to the imperial court. The Empress, seeing his forehead bare of hair, asked, “True Man, why is there no hair upon your head?” Qiu, unperturbed, calmly recited four lines:

Yesterday I heeded the elixir’s decree to ascend the Jade Steps,  
The Queen Mother and I shared a banquet in grace.  
Three cups of longevity wine I drank in a row,  
Thus the heavenly gate atop my crown was opened.

Having finished, the Empress felt a pang of shame in her heart. She had no intention to test the Way further, but having already promised the Chan Master of White Clouds, she smiled and said, “Truly, you are an immortal. Your divine powers are no small matter, inspiring great reverence. I have personally crafted this golden crown; please wear it upon your head to show your Daoist bearing.” With that, she ordered a palace eunuch to present a single ingot of gold on a tray of agate. “This golden crown is a gift from the Empress. Please wear it to accept her favor.”

The True Man was already prepared. Hidden in his sleeve was a steel needle. Taking the gold ingot with both hands, he breathed upon it with the Samadhi True Fire, softening the metal until it was as malleable as clay. Using the needle, he pierced the gold through and fastened the ingot to his hair. With the needle, he picked several strands of hair, inserting them into the golden aperture. The needle’s tip grasped a few hairs front and back, securing the ingot firmly. Was not this golden crown worn steady and secure upon his head?

The Empress, having heard the Chan Master’s suggestion, had only meant to mock True Man Qiu. Who would have imagined that this would become a lasting model for the Daoist tradition? The yellow crown worn by Daoist friends today finds its origin here. But this tale is not yet finished.

True Man Qiu, wearing the golden crown, bowed to the Empress in gratitude and recited a couplet:

Often I receive the elixir’s decree, bestowing deep grace,  
Dare I respond with verse to sing before my sovereign.  
A gentleman’s heart knows no cold affliction,  
A man’s head bears the golden crown.

Having finished his poem, the Empress felt uneasy. Rising, she said, “I recognize my fault! I hope the True Man will not mind.” Qiu replied, “There is no fault of the Empress. It is I who have long lingered in the dust of the world, inviting my own demons.” Before he finished, the Chan Master of White Clouds leapt out from behind a screen and seized Qiu, saying, “Qiu Changchun, it is not you who have invited demons, but this old monk who has been the demon to you.” Qiu said, “The Chan Master is one who sees the emptiness of the four elements; how could demons afflict me? It seems indeed I have brought this upon myself.”

Greed and confusion in worldly ways invite the dust’s allure,  
Lingering long in the dust, demons come of their own accord.  
Troubles are truly self-chosen,  
How can others make me waver?

Thus spoke True Man Qiu, taking all blame upon himself. Originally, the Chan Master of White Clouds had no quarrel; it was the True Man who had slyly taken over White Cloud Temple, winning it from him. Hence this small obstacle arose. The Chan Master advised the Empress to host a banquet and bestow the crown as a form of revenge. Had the True Man not claimed White Cloud Temple, there would have been no such trouble. Thus, Qiu’s self-blame was an act of clear conscience. Later generations should not use this victory or defeat as grounds for argument.

The Chan Master, hearing Qiu’s self-blame, also regretted his misguided intention. He casually recited four lines:

Having read the Buddhist sutras, all is emptiness,  
Why then does the heart grow dim in an instant?  
To speak of dragons and phoenixes is ultimately futile,  
Wasting effort and skill on mistaken work.

The Empress, seeing both masters each taking blame upon themselves and reflecting inwardly, was greatly pleased. She was about to offer words of praise when a palace official reported, “The imperial presence approaches.” The Empress hurried to welcome the sovereign into the palace. True Man Qiu and the Chan Master of White Clouds came together to pay respects. The Yuan Emperor was greatly pleased, saying, “I have long worried over the discord between you two. Having just left the Western Palace to ease my mind, I was told you have reconciled. My dragon heart rejoices greatly. Thus I left the Western Palace to accompany you for some leisure talk.”

The Empress then recounted the words of each master taking blame upon themselves to the Yuan Emperor. The sovereign was delighted and said, “The Three Teachings have no duality; monks and Daoists belong to one family. I must say a few words to congratulate both masters:”

One monk and one Daoist dwell in the capital,  
Monks and Daoists have always been one family.  
Henceforth, no need to divide this or that,  
Together attain the true fruit as Bodhisattvas.

True Man Qiu and the Chan Master of White Clouds heard this and both voiced thanks. The Yuan Emperor said to the Chan Master, “I have already issued imperial funds to the national master to build a new temple. When the work is complete, the Buddhist statues of White Cloud Temple shall be moved there. The old White Cloud Temple will be renamed White Cloud Sanctuary, with new statues of the Daoist Patriarch. Thus monks and Daoists will each have their own place of worship, for eternal incense and admiration, honoring the merits of both masters in protecting the orphaned realm.” The True Man and the Chan Master again expressed gratitude. The sovereign ordered officials to prepare a simple banquet for lord and ministers to enjoy together.

At the banquet, they also discussed the subtle wonders of Dao and Buddha’s teachings: Buddha’s teaching is founded on emptiness, Dao’s on the void. Emptiness means nothingness; void likewise means nothingness. In the end, it is all one principle. Before long, the banquet concluded, and the two masters took their leave, returning to their respective abodes.

Meanwhile, the monks who had left White Cloud Temple took up residence in various monasteries. One day, they happened to gather in one place and discussed, “Our fine temple has been taken by Qiu Changchun. Shall we simply give up?” Among them was a meddlesome monk who claimed to understand feng shui. He said, “If you follow my advice, we shall build a West Wind Temple in front of White Cloud Temple. I guarantee White Cloud Temple will be utterly defeated.”

The others asked the cause of this defeat. The troublesome monk said, “Have you not heard that feng shui fears human disruption? With my west wind blowing upon White Cloud, what fear is there that it will not fail? What fear it will not scatter?” Hearing this, the monks clapped their hands and laughed, calling it marvelous. They immediately prepared several contracts.

Another monk, skilled in letters, took up the brush and wrote a preface. Together, they went to see the Chan Master of White Clouds, seeking land and official titles. They told him of the plan to blow the west wind upon White Cloud Temple. The Chan Master laughed and said, “Who gave you this idea?” The monks pointed to the meddlesome monk and said, “It was this superior Bodhisattva.”

The Chan Master asked him, “You want to raise a west wind to scatter White Cloud—what is your meaning?” The monk said, “I wish to take revenge on you, Master.” The Chan Master replied, “Since Buddha opened the teaching, we only make connections with others, never enmity. Monks see the four elements as empty, and are unstained by a single speck of dust. What enmity is there to repay? When Buddha was cut limb by limb by King Kālī, our Buddha bore no hatred. Thus he attained the great heroic position, neither born nor dying. Only by enduring insult with compassion can one possess true spiritual power. Therefore, our school’s ultimate teaching empties all things, no self, no other, no sound, no smell. Since there is no self or other, what hatred can there be? What wind can be blown? Moreover, True Man Qiu has no grudge against me. White Cloud Temple was lost to him by my own fault, not by his forceful taking. Yesterday, the sovereign bestowed imperial funds to build a new temple. Now you fabricate these words to stir trouble. If the sovereign knew, and punished us, this old monk could not bear it. If you want to build, then build as you will.” Having said this, they each withdrew in silence.

The monks, hearing the Chan Master’s words, suddenly awakened. The idea of raising a west wind to blow away White Cloud vanished in an instant. They burned their contracts and dispersed to their temples. Only the meddlesome monk remained dissatisfied. Meeting Zhang and Li, he boasted, “I have several thousand silver taels to build a West Wind Temple before White Cloud Temple. When my west wind rises, I will surely scatter White Cloud. I guarantee not a single Daoist there will remain.”

He thought to frighten the Daoist friends of White Cloud Sanctuary with his bluster, unaware that nine out of ten Daoists are also fond of grand talk. Hearing his words, rumors spread that he should just build it. When he does, we will build a high wall in front, like a fan. When the wind comes, we shall fan it back—call it a returning wind, blowing itself apart. Suddenly, someone shouted, “If you can return the wind, I will set fire!” Who that was remains unknown. Let us see in the next chapter.

Enduring insult can bring about harmony,  
Honor and disgrace are but truths and falsehoods flowing eastward.
