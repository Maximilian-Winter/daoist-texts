# Chapter Twenty-Nine: Receiving the Elixir Edict, the Seven Perfected Achieve True Fruition; Journeying to the Jade Pool, the Assembly of Immortals Celebrates the Peaches of Immortality

To cultivate the Great Dao and emerge from confusion,  
That alone marks a true man of the mortal realm.  

Sun and moon shine together, eternal and unending,  
Heaven and earth grow old side by side, strengthening the Mysterious Capital.  

---

Now, those boastful Daoist companions were just then discussing: “If he were to build the West Wind Temple, then we shall erect a screen wall outside the White Cloud Abbey. Since ancient times the Dao says ‘fear the wind,’ and the wind fears the wall. This wall shall serve as a fan—when the wind comes, we shall flap it once, and the wind will blow back, called the Returning Wind.”  

Before the words were finished, Zhu Jiu, the highway robber on Mount Zouxian, roared loudly nearby: “If you can really return the wind, I’ll set fire and burn it down clean!”  

Wang Neng saw his reckless bravado and hurriedly shouted: “The temple is not yet built—why burn it? Wait until it is finished, then burning would not be too late!”  

The Daoist friends laughed heartily at this. But who would have guessed that some busybody Daoist would spread these words around, passing them from Zhang to Li, from one to another, until over time the tale became a popular rumor. People took it as truth, believing that the monks were building a West Wind Temple to blow apart the White Cloud Abbey, and that the Daoists used a crude method to return the wind and fire, burning the West Wind Temple to ashes.  

In truth, none of this happened. There was only a meddlesome monk on one side and a boastful Daoist on the other. You say this, I say that, stirring up trouble for those who delight in mischief. Many old cultivators born and raised in the capital could not clarify this matter. Now, relying on ancient texts, we correct the record without error, so that future disciples will not quarrel over who is stronger or weaker, but instead shine with the brilliance of cause and effect.  

Since ancient times, false rumors cannot be trusted; the more they are told, the more absurd they become.  

Today, people take them as real events, repeatedly judging the sages’ merits and faults.

It is also said that after Master Qiu reconciled with the Chan Master of White Cloud, during his quiet repose he refined his cultivation through ninety-nine turns and eighty-one transformations—symbolizing the ninety-nine and eighty-one hardships—using his true nature and original feelings. The restless mind and wandering thoughts were used as his own tools; the seven emotions and six desires, along with the three corpses and six thieves, were external demons invading and robbing him.  

He composed a great book entitled *Journey to the West*.  

After the book was completed, he sent a Daoist boy to the Jixian Pavilion to present it to the White Cloud Chan Master.  

The Chan Master, a man of great wisdom, understood at a glance. He also recorded the cavernous visions and the wondrous uses of stillness, the thirty-six routes of external demons attacking the self through the six-by-six array. Using wisdom and spiritual power to overcome transformations, he composed a great book called *Investiture of the Gods*.  

He then sent a novice monk to the White Cloud Abbey to present it to Master Qiu.  

From then on, the two schools reconciled. The Chan Master, now fully endowed with spiritual power, flew his talisman southward to spread the teachings.  

These two immortal and Buddhist works—*Journey to the West* and *Investiture of the Gods*—endure through the ages, their wondrous uses boundless.  

The two great books conceal profound mysteries, illusions created by human reason as natural.  

The seven emotions and six desires bring chaos, spawning myriad demon kings.

It is further said that Master Qiu opened a platform at White Cloud Abbey to teach the precepts, widely opening the gate to salvation, reviving the Quanzhen Dao. He established rules and standards to warn future generations, and left behind instructive writings for posterity.  

He opened seventy-two monastic communities, connecting the mysterious lineage for hundreds of millions of years, achieving three thousand merits and eight hundred fulfilled practices.  

Answering the call of Lord Zhao Zifu, he became an immortal of the Great Luo.  

On the nineteenth day of the tenth month, he mounted a crane and ascended to the heavens.  

At that moment, rosy clouds glowed and purple qi soared, twin Golden Boys came forth to escort him, paired Jade Maidens to guide his steps.  

A gentle breeze stirred, banners and flags danced in midair, clear music rang out, and immortal melodies thundered from the clouds.  

In an instant, they departed the capital, arriving swiftly at the Southern Heavenly Gate.  

Wang, Ma, Yin, and Zhao greeted him with hands clasped; Zhang, Ge, Xu, and Sa smiled and welcomed him.  

They bowed before the Supreme One at the Golden Palace, observed the Heavenly Countenance at the Royal Court, and prostrated beneath the Jade Steps.  

Before the Lingxiao Hall, they declared their allegiance: “Long live our Sovereign, boundless as the heavens! Great is the Emperor’s virtue, fostering all life!”  

The Supreme Patriarch rejoiced greatly and ordered the Three Officials to examine the merits and achievements in the hall, recommending the Seven Perfected Ones:  

“By merit and virtue, after examining their inner and outer practices, Qiu Changchun ranks first.  

Mastering the subtle mysteries of the boundless Great Ultimate, Liu Changsheng is second.  

Tan Changzhen, steadfast in the Dao, ranks third.  

Ma Danyang, pure and tranquil, is fourth.  

Hao Taigu, unstained as a single speck of dust, is fifth.  

Wang Yuyang, with all worries extinguished, is sixth.  

Sun Buer, wise and complete, the prime initiator of cultivation, has the greatest merit. She should surpass the others, yet humbly yields her place—first as beginning, now as end—thus is named seventh.”  

The complete beginning and end, the fruit of the Seven Perfected, are inscribed by the Purple Palace.  

Now I dare to report this.”  

When the report was finished, the Heavenly Countenance was pleased and decreed the Seven Perfected be conferred titles:  

Qiu Changchun was named Heavenly Immortal Top Scholar, chosen by the Purple Palace, Supreme Leader of the Quanzhen Sect, Divine Transformation Bright Response Lord True Sovereign.  

Liu Changsheng was named Profound Stillness and Accumulated Virtue True Sovereign.  

Tan Changzhen was named Ancestral Profound Bright Virtue True Sovereign.  

Ma Danyang was named Non-action Universal Transformation True Sovereign.  

Hao Taigu was named Thoroughly Profound and Marvelously Ultimate True Sovereign.  

Wang Yuyang was named Broad Compassion Universal Salvation True Sovereign.  

Sun Buer was named Mysterious Void Harmonious Transformation Primordial Lord.  

---

With the conferments complete, Liu, Tan, Ma, Hao, Wang, and Sun all expressed thanks. Only Qiu Changchun refused to thank.  

The Three Officials called out: “Why does Qiu Changchun not thank?”  

Master Qiu bowed low at the Jade Steps, tears streaming, trembling as he reported:  

“It is not that I refuse to thank, but because the Dao is fundamentally difficult to learn, and becoming an immortal is not easy.  

Those who cultivate and learn the Dao in later generations, if they endure hundreds of thousands of hardships without turning back, are one in ten thousand.  

Goodness is the hardest to learn; without learning goodness, the Dao cannot be completed.  

I have written a chapter on the difficulty of learning goodness to present.  

‘Awakening to the Dao is not easy; learning goodness is the hardest.  

The matter of learning goodness cannot be undertaken by those without great strength.  

One must endure hunger and cold, humiliation and shame.  

Sometimes clothes do not last a lifetime, food not a day.  

Days may pass with only two meals, nights hard to spend in sleep.  

Each day one provokes dislike, repeatedly suffers insult.  

Words are bitter, hearing them chills the bones.  

I have experienced a thousand hardships, thus know the difficulty of learning goodness.  

One simple word, ‘good,’ is hard to learn—how dare one hope for immortality!  

I fear that future cultivators will not endure such suffering and hardship, bearing only the name of Dao learning but not its reality, leaving me no way to transform and save them, thus failing the grace of our Sovereign’s honor.  

Therefore, I dare not thank. I humbly beg forgiveness.’”  

---

Master Qiu reported the difficulty of learning goodness to the Supreme Emperor. The assembly of immortals was silent.  

Suddenly, from the western hall emerged a Star Lord.  

Can you imagine this Star Lord’s appearance?  

He was born with red hair, red face, red beard, and a red heart following him.  

Wearing a golden helmet, golden armor, wielding golden bricks and golden whips,  

His feet tread on fire chariots of three and five wheels,  

Chasing wind and pursuing lightning, subduing demons and capturing monsters,  

Upholding justice without partiality, known as Iron-faced Lord of Thunder,  

Protector of the Dharma with spiritual response, jointly venerating the Primordial Spiritual Ancestor.  

Nearby stood the Spiritual Ancestor.  

Hearing Master Qiu’s report that those learning goodness suffer many trials without protection, he secretly resolved to become a protector deity.  

He loudly proclaimed:  

“Qiu Changchun, you may now thank!  

In the future, if any cultivator or Daoist has three parts cultivation, I will respond with seven parts;  

If they have ten parts cultivation, I will always illuminate them.  

There will be those who offer feasts and offerings; they shall not endure hunger or cold.”  

Master Qiu, hearing the Star Lord’s words, then thanked and bowed to him, placing a burden weighing thousands of catties on the Star Lord’s shoulder.  

---

Soon after, the Supreme Emperor withdrew from the hall, the assembly dispersed.  

The Seven Perfected accompanied the East Flower Emperor to pay respects to the Primordial Ancestor Donghua, Patriarch Zhongli, and Patriarch Dongbin.  

They also bowed to their master, Patriarch Chongyang.  

The East Flower Emperor sent Purple Mist True Immortal to guide the Seven Perfected to the Hall of Ceremony, where they learned the rites of the Jade Pool.  

Before long, the Peach Banquet was held, a joyous audience with the High Transcendents.  

---

When the time of the gathering arrived, the East Flower Emperor led the newly advanced Perfected Immortals, from both southern and northern schools, the Five Phases and the Seven Perfected, all gazing toward the Jade Pool.  

From afar they beheld the jade towers and crystal palaces, golden pavilions and silver courts, coral railings, steps of red jade, golden and azure brilliance intermingled, vermilion and purple dazzling the eye.  

Auspicious light reflected brightly, fragrant aromas filled the air.  

Among the jade forests and crystal trees, phoenixes flew and dragons danced.  

Beneath golden pillars and silver pedestals, tigers roared and dragons howled.  

Mysterious cranes and plum deer, blue lions and white elephants, all paired in harmony.  

Phoenix carriages and dragon chariots, phoenix sedan chairs and crane steeds—unmatched in the world.  

Words cannot fully describe the solemnity of the Jade Pool, nor express the beauty of Kunlun.  

---

Meanwhile, the East Flower Emperor led the new assembly of immortals to pay homage to the Queen Mother.  

The Queen Mother received them with the courtesy due guests.  

In a short while, the holy perfected ones gathered like clouds.  

The Queen Mother greeted and inquired, then according to ancient meeting rules, each had their order.  

Only the newly advanced perfected must await the host’s arrangement.  

The Queen Mother said:  

“Newly advanced immortals, before the Supreme Sage, if you cannot each pay respects individually, now you may proceed as convenient—stand by the Elixir Pool, bow thrice together, united as one.”  

Having given these instructions, the East Flower Emperor led the assembly to kneel on the jade steps.  

After the Queen Mother performed nine kowtows, she seated them one by one.  

Music played from the Celestial Sphere, songs and dances of the rainbow and wisteria.  

The banquet’s treasures were beyond naming, none of this world’s making.  

Many immortal children passed cups and offered wine, countless jade maidens held goblets and poured from ewers.  

Dozens of boys carried purple bamboo baskets, flying lightly to the treetops to pluck the Pan Tao peaches.  

From top to bottom, baskets filled in an instant.  

Immortal attendants and officials passed them around, quickly filling the courtyard.  

The largest peaches were presented to the Heavenly Venerable and Great Sage, the next to the Great Luo Golden Immortals and the Three Realms’ true gods, and the next given as rewards to the celestial guards and all their retinues on Penglai Isle.  

These peaches are not easily eaten; only those who cultivate may obtain them.  

Future disciples who desire these peaches must also follow the Seven Perfected’s devoted hearts and diligent resolve, cultivate and realize the Dao to become perfected.  

Respectfully worship the Queen Mother of the Jade Pool, and she will surely grant you a Pan Tao peach.  

Eating one grants a thousand years of life, unaging and eternal.  

---

When the banquet concluded, thousands of perfected and myriad saints each returned to their heavenly palaces.  

The Seven Perfected followed the East Flower Emperor back to the Purple Palace.  

This Purple Palace lies upon the Fangzhu Mountains, which resemble Kunlun but are not as towering.  

Within are grasses evergreen through the four seasons, flowers that never fade through the eight festivals—counted among the highest realms of Heaven’s Palaces.  

Not easily reached.  

A poem says:  

> The Seven Perfected’s cause and effect flow forever,  
> Enduring boundless suffering in the mortal world.  
> Only hoping we learn the subtle mysteries,  
> Surely we shall become carefree immortals in Heaven.
