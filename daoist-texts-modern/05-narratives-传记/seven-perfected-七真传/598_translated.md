## Preface

In the boundless expanse of the Ten Directions, beneath the ever-turning heavens, the dao unfolds like a river flowing through the ages. The Seven True Words are the sacred utterances, the numinous syllables that open the gates of transformation and reveal the hidden patterns of the cosmos. This collection gathers the living expressions of these words, as practiced and transmitted by the venerable Sun Chengde, who, through decades of cultivation and refinement, brought forth their luminous power from the depths of the mysterious Dao.

## Chapter One: The Origin of the Seven True Words

Long ago, before Heaven and Earth took shape, the primordial Dao was without form or sound. From the silence emerged the first breath, the original resonance that gave birth to the myriad things. Among these, the Seven True Words appeared as the sacred keys, each a gate to a realm of transformation.

The first word is the breath of Heaven, the pulse of the Nine Heavens, where the Jade Emperor, Great August Sovereign, holds court amid the stars of the Northern Dipper. It is the word that calls forth the celestial light, the numinous power that governs the turning of the seasons and the rise and fall of empires.

The second word is the voice of Earth, the deep murmur beneath the mountains, where the Great Emperor of the Eastern Peak watches over the cycles of birth and death. This word nurtures the roots of the Five Phases, the hidden textures of wood and stone, and the silent growth of all living things.

The third word is the song of Water, flowing through rivers and seas, carrying the grace of the Water Official, Great Emperor, whose mercy washes away suffering and grants renewal. It is the word of fluidity and change, the secret current beneath all forms.

The fourth word is the flame of Fire, burning bright in the hearth and the heart, where the Heavenly Venerable of Great Unity, Savior from Suffering, kindles the light of compassion and wisdom. This word ignites transformation and purifies the soul.

The fifth word is the breath of Wind, invisible yet felt, stirring the leaves and the clouds, where the Mysterious Lady of the Nine Heavens dances among the stars. It is the word that carries the song of freedom and the whispers of the unseen.

The sixth word is the echo of Thunder, rolling across the mountains, where the Lord of Thunder commands the storm and the flash of lightning. This word is the power of awakening, the call to vigilance and the force of change.

The seventh word is the silence beyond sound, the stillness within movement, where the Most High Patriarch of the Dao resides beyond form and name. It is the ultimate word, the path to return to the source, the gate to immortality.

## Chapter Two: The Practice of the Seven True Words

To speak these words is to open the gates of the Three Realms, to traverse the Six Paths, and to harmonize with the rhythm of Heaven and Earth. The practitioner must cultivate the breath, refine the spirit, and nourish the soul, aligning with the principle of yin and yang and the flow of the Five Phases.

Begin with the breath of Heaven, inhaling the numinous light of the Nine Heavens, feeling the pulse of the Jade Emperor’s grace. Let this breath fill the body, awakening the inner caverns where the primordial energy dwells.

Next, attune to the voice of Earth, grounding the spirit in the deep roots of the Eastern Peak. Sense the texture of the soil, the principle of growth and decay, and the silent virtue that sustains all life.

Then, flow with the song of Water, allowing the currents of mercy and renewal to wash through the channels of the body. This is the path of flexibility and surrender, the way of transformation without resistance.

Ignite the flame of Fire within, kindling the light of wisdom and compassion. Let this flame burn away the dross of ignorance and kindle the inner altar of the heart.

Feel the breath of Wind, the invisible force that stirs the leaves and carries the soul’s song beyond the confines of form. This breath is freedom, the dance of spirit in the vastness of space.

Hear the echo of Thunder, the call to awaken from slumber, the power to break through illusion and grasp the true nature of things. This is the voice of change, the roar of the cosmic drum.

Finally, rest in the silence beyond sound, the stillness that holds all movement. Here lies the ultimate word, the path back to the Dao, where all distinctions dissolve and the primordial unity is revealed.

## Chapter Three: Tales of the Seven True Words

It is said that once a humble woodcutter wandered into the caverns beneath the Eastern Peak, seeking refuge from a storm. There, he heard the whisper of the Earth’s voice, the second true word, and felt his spirit awaken. Guided by this word, he journeyed through the realms, meeting the Heavenly Official, Great Emperor, who taught him the breath of Heaven, and the Water Official, Great Emperor, who showed him the song of Water.

Through trials and tribulations, the woodcutter learned to speak the seven words, each unlocking a new facet of the cosmos within him. He tamed the flame of Fire that threatened to consume his fears, danced with the breath of Wind that carried his dreams, and heeded the echo of Thunder that shattered his doubts.

In the end, resting in the silence beyond sound, he became a transcendent, a true immortal who walked the path of the Most High Patriarch of the Dao. His story reminds us that the Seven True Words are not mere syllables but living keys to the eternal mysteries.

## Chapter Four: The Seven True Words in the World

The Seven True Words resonate not only in the heavens but also in the hearts of all beings. They are the hidden melodies in the rustling leaves, the silent prayers in the flowing rivers, the sacred fires in the hearths of humble homes.

The dao of the Seven True Words is a path open to all who seek. Whether a gentleman of noble birth or a humble farmer, the words speak to the heart’s deepest longing, guiding each step along the winding road of cultivation.

## Epilogue

May the Seven True Words illuminate the path of all who wander in darkness, may their numinous power awaken the spirit and nourish the soul. As the Jade Emperor governs the Nine Heavens, so may these sacred utterances govern the inner palace of the heart, leading all to the eternal Dao, the source and return of all things.
