# Preface

I have pondered the origin of the Dao and Virtue, the root of life and nature itself—this is qi, this is principle. It swirls and drifts within the boundless Great Void, condenses and gathers inside the Six Directions, establishing Heaven and setting Earth, the primal source and the essential end. Stretching through antiquity without alteration, enduring myriad kalpas to last forever, growing ever higher and ever farther, supremely true and numinous. The Most High named this mighty force the Dao.

Fuxi beheld the River Chart, the numbers of Heaven and Earth, yin and yang emerging and forming; from these he developed the trigrams and lines. Cangjie, inspired by the Luo Writing’s numbers, drew near to the body and far to the things, observing bird tracks and thus creating the seal script. Wen, Wu, and Duke Zhou expounded the *Zhou Yi*, revealing the wondrous workings after Heaven’s formation, crafting the tradition and legend, laying out the Heavenly Dao, and reaching the root origin of creation.

Confucius edited the *Poetry* and *Documents*, fixed the *Rites* and *Music*, clarifying the beginnings of benevolence and righteousness. The Empress instructed on marriage and betrothal, establishing the origins of human relationships. Thus the Three Powers were set, the Six Arts completed; literature flourished, rites and music were composed. As for the myriad schools’ writings and the Three Teachings’ scriptures, they fill countless cartloads, numbering in the millions upon millions. Yet the people of the time cannot exhaust the root source; they only seek branches and pluck leaves, the more they see the more confused they become, ever searching further and further.

Now, the affairs of the world are muddled and dissipated, life is frivolous and shallow. When faced with luxury and licentious talk, it seems like sugar and honey; when hearing true and genuine principle, it is like a crack or an enemy. Thus falsehoods multiply, righteous qi daily diminishes. All the wise and clever strive with brush and ink to seek refinement; officials and courtiers are intent on fame and profit. Because of this, the national spirit declines, the hearts of the people drift apart—how can there be no ruin? Today, those who hold loyal and upright hearts, who establish resolute wills, are few indeed; those who focus on dao and righteousness, who set their feet firmly on nature and life, are even fewer.

Alas! In this world, everyone contends for fame and seizes profit; all love wine and are lost in flowers. Who knows that extreme joy will end in sorrow, that blessings exhausted will bring calamity? Without practicing the Eight Virtues, even if one attains the Three Platforms, one remains a petty person; without cultivating the Ten Good Deeds, even if rich beyond the world, one dies a poor ghost. In life, one seeks unjust fame; in death, one falls into the prison of endless suffering. Only a foul name remains to flow through ten thousand generations—what use is that to me? Wise and enlightened ones, quietly reflect upon this; hasten to turn from error to truth, repent the past and cultivate the future, lest your body sink into the bitter sea, lost and drowned without rescue.

How sorrowful! Now the world declines and the Dao wanes; the days of the sages grow distant. Those with true resolve cannot find the proper gate, and people are all seduced by side doors and wild teachings. Those without prior roots take false feelings and illusory scenes as earnest, seeking pleasure in wine, women, wealth, and anger, contending like snails for fame, snatching like flies for profit. Do they not know that time is limited, that in a blink all is impermanent? When the illusion fades, all things are false; puppets are gathered, all is sham; the sea of suffering is boundless—turn back, and the shore is near.

I have seen the old text *Transmission of the Seven Perfected*, which not only lacks all dao and virtue, but whose words are confused and disorderly; moreover, the origins and endings of the Perfected and their immortal traces cannot be verified. I fear it will mislead later generations, taking falsehood for truth. Therefore, I have thoroughly examined treasured proclamations and historical records, searched for sayings and alchemical scriptures, and compiled this book, recording in four scrolls and twenty-four chapters. Among these, the seven golden lotuses bestowed by Chongyang are paramount, hence named *The Immortal History of the Golden Lotus*. Every matter within is verified, every phrase true—it is a precious raft to ascend to Heaven, a compassionate ferry to cross the world.

I only wish that those with aspiration toward the Dao may carefully and quietly savor it, not treating it as a trivial book or worldly writing. If one can grasp the meaning within this book, the gate of Dao and Virtue can be entered, the path of cultivating the True can be found. Scholars should emulate the arduous resolve and steadfast hearts of the two ancestors Qiu and Bai, advancing bravely and diligently, cultivating the Dao’s work—what worry is there that virtue will not be established or the Dao not accomplished? Thus is this preface composed.

In the season of autumn’s full moon, the year of Jiachen in the Guangxu era.  
Qingyang Daoist of Tainan, Pan Changming, humbly composes this preface.
