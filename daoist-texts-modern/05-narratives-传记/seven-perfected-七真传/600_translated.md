# Chapter One: The Manifestation of the Mysterious Primordial Immortals Leaving Sacred Traces — Examining the Descent of the Two Sons of Creation into Mortal Flesh

**Poem:**

In tranquil gaze, all matters bloom as one Huaxu;  
The world’s ways, hot and cold, are but empty hue.  
At Yuji’s bed, one prays for three feet of rain;  
Zhuangzi sits immersed in five cartloads of books.  
Wang E sternly fishes among forest plums and cranes,  
Tao’s chrysanthemums, Zhou’s lotuses, garden bamboos, and fish.  
Each master’s seed of feeling differs at the root;  
When birth’s heart is cleansed, true thusness is reached.

**Another Poem:**

Dao and virtue, effortless, embody nature’s form;  
Teachers pass down true explications in their norm.  
Elixirs perfected, purple mansions hold the scrolls;  
Fruits attained, the Jade Capital notes eternal goals.  
The Most High stores a thousand branches in jade tomes,  
Heavenly immortals’ single lineage begins golden blooms.  
Mystic threads flow and unfold through ages old and new;  
Generation to generation, they inspire the worthy few.

It is said that beneath Heaven’s vast expanse, there originally existed four great continents: the Eastern Continent of Divine Victory, also called Fuyudai; the Southern Jambu Continent, also named Yanfuti; the Western Ox-Head Continent, also known as Quyeni; and the Northern Kuru Continent, also called Yudan Yue. These four continents, where one is dark the other bright, where one is shadowed the other illuminated. All that is dark is called Chaos.

Now, focusing on the Southern Yanfuti, since its primal opening and division, there have been over three hundred states, large and small. Among all the peoples born there, the land of Zhonghua is the most beautiful. Therefore, the upper realms’ heavenly immortals and true sages are most numerous in China. All those who have attained the dao in China, from antiquity to now, reached their peak between the Tang and Song dynasties.

Our heavenly immortals’ primordial ancestor, the Eastern Flower Sovereign Lord Wang Xuanfu, was a man of the early Han. He spontaneously received the dao of the Perfected Yin Xi, dwelling in the misty caverns of Kunlun Mountain, cultivating and refining the elixir to completion. By the time of Emperor Huan of Han, he transmitted the dao to the Upright Yang Sovereign Lord Zhongli Quan, a native of Xianyang in Shaanxi, wise and brave, serving as a remonstrance official for Han. When northern Qiang tribes rebelled, his elder brother Zhongli Jian served as a middle-ranking general and recommended his brother. Zhongli Quan was appointed a great general and led northern campaigns. Liang Ji envied him. The Qiang captured the camp, the army was defeated, and Quan fled alone on horseback into the mountains.

At night, he saw a distant lamp’s glow and spurred his horse to seek it, finding a thatched hut with a monk inside, white-haired yet childlike in face. Quan was amazed and asked his name. The monk said, “I am Huanglong Huiji, the Summer Yellow Elder Cui Kuo of Shangshan’s Four Elders. You are a great general of the Han, but within you are traitors and rebels without. With the army defeated, there is no place to stand. You should go seek the Master of Shaoyang; in time, you will become the leader of true immortals. Why linger long in the dusty world, buried in the wheel of rebirth?”

Upon hearing this, Quan’s heart awakened. The elder led him away to pay respects to the Shaoyang Sovereign and hear the ultimate dao. Later, he and his brother Jian entered Mount Hua to cultivate, calling themselves the Upright Yang Sons, styled Yunfang. When the dao was fulfilled, the Jade Emperor issued an edict, bestowing upon Quan the title of True Man of the Left Palace of the Supreme Ultimate. Later, he concealed his name, calling himself Jin Chongjian, serving Wei as a great general guarding Dai Commandery. Seeing Emperor Jin’s arrogance and luxury, he retired into seclusion.

By the Tang dynasty came the Passing Benevolence Sovereign Lord Du Fuyou, surname Lü, named Shaoxian, whose ancestors hailed from Yongle County in Henan. His uncles were Wen, Liang, Gong, and Jian; his father, named Rang, had passed the imperial examination and served as governor of Haizhou; his mother was Lady Wang. On the fourteenth day of the fourth lunar month in the twentieth year of Zhenguan’s Bingwu, at the hour of the snake, he was born. From infancy he showed wisdom; when swaddled, Master Ma saw him and said, “This child’s bones and features are extraordinary; in time he will manifest in the world’s dust. When he meets a hut, he will dwell; when he sees a bell, he will bow.” Growing up, he knew filial piety and propriety, recording ten thousand words daily, speaking with written eloquence. He married Lady Liu. Though he failed the imperial exams thrice, at forty-six, urged by his mother, he took the test again, bringing his family servant Tong Jier to the capital.

At a tavern in Chang’an, he met the Upright Yang Sovereign, who gifted him a pillow. Shaoxian leaned on it and fell asleep, dreaming of the examination hall. His writings were outstanding, and he ranked first as top scholar. He attended the Jade Forest banquet, roaming the capital streets for three days. Summoned by imperial order, he returned home to tend ancestral graves. The next year, he resumed duties as chief examiner. After completing affairs, he was promoted to Censor-in-Chief. His governance was upright and clean, then he rose to Deputy Minister of Rites, then Minister of Personnel. A treacherous official accused him of treason, leading to his dismissal and imprisonment. Within days, he was summoned for judgment, facing a blade at his throat, as if a red pot pressed on his head, forced to walk ten li in unbearable pain. Upon awakening, drenched in sweat, the Upright Yang Sovereign asked, “What of this dream?” Shaoxian asked in alarm, “I dreamed my servant Tong held an unripe yellow millet; does the Master know what this means?” The Sovereign said, “You yearn for wealth and honor; your life’s fortunes and losses are all here. If you do not quickly turn back, when the blade comes to your head, regret will be too late!” Shaoxian’s limbs went numb; he realized that wealth and honor were but a yellow millet dream. From then on, the Sovereign departed, and Shaoxian sought the dao with a sincere heart, awakening to the world’s vanity.

In the second year of Zhou Tian Shou, the year of Xinmao, he took the exam and passed the advanced degree. Assigned magistrate of Dehua County in Jiangzhou, he traveled to Mount Kuanglu, where he met Fire Dragon True Man Zheng Siyuan, who transmitted the Heavenly Escape sword method and inner refining secrets. From then on, he abandoned office to wander, sending Tong Jier home to report. Tong Jier, obeying orders, stayed overnight at a lonely inn, pondering, “My master has abandoned office to seek the dao and sent me home to inform my mistress. How can I face her? Better to die here and await my master’s attainment to save me.” Thus, he hanged himself beneath a willow. Later, Shaoxian met the Upright Yang Sovereign again, who taught him the Golden Elixir formula. Cultivating, he attained truth, returning home to visit the grave and save the willow’s spirit, calling the Willow Immortal Tong Jier, whose real name was Guo Shangzao. Later, during the Yuan era, he was posthumously titled Grand Teaching Willow True Lord. This is another tale, not told here.

Shaoxian attained the dao, calling himself Pure Yang Son, named Yan, styled Dongbin, traveling everywhere to teach and save people. In Guangzhou, he saved He Gu and attained the dao; in Changli, he saved Han Zi to ascend truth; in Handan, he awakened Lu Ying from a dream to see the world; in Yanjing, he inspired Liu Cao with a few words to seek the mysterious. Traveling with Lan Yangsu to the Azure Realm, he saved Cao Jingxiu to ascend Pengying, also saving Zhang Zhen’nu and Immortal Maiden Hou. These immortals appear in records here and there. All these were Lü Zu’s unfulfilled vows.

How do we know his vows were unfulfilled? When the Upright Yang Sovereign was summoned to ascend Heaven, amidst rainbow banners and divine regalia, with retinues and phoenix carriages, heavenly messengers descended to welcome him, decreeing him the Nine Heavens’ Golden Palace’s chosen immortal envoy. He said to Dongbin, “You shall remain in the world to accumulate merit; one day you too shall be like me.” Dongbin replied, “My will differs from yours; I must save all beings before ascending.” The Sovereign said, “Your aspirations are vast and deep; you shall become a great vessel. Though I now return to Heaven’s Palace, I will aid you and fulfill your wishes.” Then he ascended. Thus, later Zhongli and Lü, two immortals, everywhere save and guide, never departing. Later generations praised in verse:

With mighty will and lofty virtue’s glow,  
Ancient and modern immortal registers show heroes.  
Everywhere guiding unintentional guests,  
Everywhere supporting those with resolve and zest.  
Painting cranes and inscribing poems to shock the mundane,  
Flying phoenixes reveal and break worldly strain.  
If all were like Zhongli and Lü,  
Merely boasting would uproot a hair.

It is told that True Man Wang Sheng of Yuntai, who attained the dao in early Han, was later appointed by Laozi alongside Zhang Shen, Wang Sheng, and Li Zhong to oversee Yuntai. By Emperor Xuanzong’s Tang era, all immortals gathered for the Peach Banquet of Fangzhu. Wang Sheng toured the Immortal Isles with Laozi, seeing immortals descending to the world, each accumulating merit and fame. He then conceived a worldly thought—to descend at the right time and accumulate merit.

By the Song dynasty’s Zhenghe era, in Dawei Village of Xianyang County, Western Qin, lived an elder surnamed Wang, named Renzheng, who had passed the filial and incorrupt official examination and came from a lineage of officials. Serving as magistrate of Wuzhou in Shanxi for several years, he was known for upright governance. At half a century, childless, he resigned and returned home with his wife Lady Xie, family, and servants, crossing the Yellow River by horse-drawn carts. Passing before the Western Peak Temple at sunset, they hurried to lodge, settling their drivers and horses. After supper, the couple discussed, “This Huashan Temple is the palace of the Western Peak Golden Heavenly Sovereign, whose divine power is renowned; all prayers answered. Now, having no heir and resigning office, our ancestors have long accumulated virtue, and we ourselves love goodness and joy in the dao. I have heard in the Book of Changes: ‘A family accumulating virtue will surely have abundant blessings.’ Is this not true? I think Heaven’s net is vast and sparse, yet nothing escapes. Our Wang family now faces extinction of heirs; I fear not so.” That night they wrote a petition praying for offspring, waiting until dawn, then bought incense, candles, and paper money, and together offered incense and prayers at the temple courtyard. After presenting their petition, they returned home.

The Western Peak Great Emperor governs all heavenly ranks, ghosts and gods, and human rewards and punishments. All major affairs are reported to the Jade Emperor, who issues decrees; minor matters are handled by the Emperor himself. Seeing Wang Renzheng’s petition, he dispatched the judge official along with city gods and earth gods to investigate the Wang family. The gods reported, “The Wang family has accumulated virtue for generations; Renzheng and his wife have amassed much yin merit.” The Western Peak Emperor, seeing their deep roots, dared not act on his own and brought the petition to the Bright Hall to report to the Jade Emperor. The petition was presented by the Celestial Master Xu Jingyang to the Jade Emperor, who read:

*“Humbly, holding the west, governing Geng and Xin to nurture life;  
Charged with Huashan, receiving Qian and Dui to generate forms.  
Ten thousand generations show efficacy, no request denied;  
A thousand autumns shine bright, all feelings communicated.  
Respectfully submitting this petition.  
In the Great Song State, Western Qin, Xianyang County, Dawei Village, lives faithful official Wang Renzheng and wife Lady Xie. On this day, they bathed and offered incense, sincerely praying at the Western Peak Temple courtyard, saying:  
‘We humbly note the Wang family’s generations of virtue, yet difficulty in producing heirs;  
Renzheng’s half-life of accumulated goodness may pray to continue ancestral blessings.  
We reveal our true hearts, daring to disturb holy wisdom, hoping all wishes may be granted and protection bestowed.  
We pray that in the White Jade Capital, a purple radiance be issued, granting a son of eternal life;  
Within the Golden Palace, decree a cinnabar script to extend the clan’s lineage;  
To inherit ancestors and open the future, illuminating forebears and clan.  
Further praying for household auspiciousness and all affairs to prosper.  
Our humble words cannot express the deepest earnestness.  
Respectfully submitting this petition, bowing a hundred times to report.’”*

The Jade Emperor, after reading, said, “It is unknown if the Wang family truly has virtuous proof.” The Western Peak Emperor replied, “I sent envoys to investigate; the Wang family has much yin merit for generations, and Renzheng and his wife are very virtuous. I dare not grant reward privately, so I report to Your Majesty, humbly requesting that the Four Fruits Immortals descend to beget a son, so that in the future the mysterious wind may freely blow.”

Before the Jade Emperor could reply, True Man Wang Sheng stepped forward, holding a tablet, kneeling long, and said, “I humbly report to the Jade Emperor: I once accompanied Laozi on a journey to the lower realms, seeing the mysterious wind weakening and intending to descend to the dusty world to restore the mystic thread and become a model for later generations; to widely expound the great teaching as a compassionate ferry across the sea of suffering. I dare to offend holy wisdom, offering my sincere report with utmost joy.” The Jade Emperor, pleased, said, “You wish to descend to the dusty world and widely expound Daoism. Fortunate that you share my surname and root.” He then commanded the Jade Maiden Jingwei to present a cup of jade nectar and fine wine: “Drink this elixir; though you reincarnate, your past causes will not be obscured. When the time comes to abandon dust, true immortals will mark and confirm your rank and grant further promotion.” Wang Sheng bowed and drank. Jingwei, standing nearby, seeing Wang Sheng’s mission to descend, felt a stirring desire to descend herself. With a subtle glance, she glimpsed Wang Sheng. The Jade Emperor, knowing her thoughts, commanded Jingwei to descend with him, to be paired as husband and wife until their功 is complete and they may ascend the Heavenly Palace together. The two immortals thanked and took leave. The Four Great Celestial Masters and other immortals escorted them out of Lingxiao. The two True Men bowed farewell to the assembly. The Western Peak Emperor returned to Huashan. (Not recorded here.)

It is said that the Jade Maiden Jingwei was originally the daughter of the Divine Farmer Flame Emperor, named Nühua, who studied under Chisongzi. This maiden, desiring to cross the sea seeking the dao and longing for longevity, bade farewell to her parents, taking palace maids and attendants to gather herbs by the sea. She built a raft to cross the ocean but drowned. Her pure spirit, untainted, transformed into a bird named Jingwei. Her resentment unsoftened, she tried to carry wood and stones from the Western Mountains to fill the Eastern Sea. Later, she met Master Chisongzi, who brought her to meet the Queen Mother. The Queen Mother commanded her to guard the Langyuan Peach Garden, awaiting the cleansing of her resentment so she might reincarnate as human and ascend the upper realms. Since attending the Peach Banquet of Fangzhu, the Queen Mother ordered Jingwei to attend the Jade Emperor, adapting to circumstances and reincarnating. Thus Jingwei took the opportunity to descend, incarnating as a daughter of the He family in Chang’an. Her mother dreamed of a blue bird flying into her bosom, and upon waking found herself pregnant. (Not recorded here.)

Meanwhile, Wang Renzheng returned home, busied for days arranging household affairs, finally feeling at ease. Suddenly, winter passed and spring arrived; in the second lunar month, the weather was clear and mild. The couple strolled in the garden, where peach blossoms were in full bloom, dazzling the eye. Though once saddened by childlessness, their brows now lifted. They called servant Wang Xing to move the wine table before the flowers, appreciating them while reciting:

“I recall when first we planted this tree,  
In joy I once composed a poem on its growth.  
Today I bring wine to admire again,  
Though old the tree, its blossoms and fruit are late.”

His wife laughed upon hearing the verse, saying, “The old tree’s late fruit shows the true flavor of age.” Her words stirred Renzheng’s heart; the couple drank and laughed in joy.

That evening, as the couple lay in bed, suddenly a feathered scholar in yellow crown and crane cloak descended from the air, standing before the bed, loudly declaring, “I am a true immortal of the Han, wishing to dwell here, destined to become a leader of the mysterious gate.” The couple awoke startled, realizing it was but a southern branch dream. Though doubtful, they wondered: if a dream, why did both see and hear it? Surely fate was at work. The wife then sensed pregnancy.

Time passed swiftly; ten months later, in the twelfth lunar month, twenty-second day of the Renchen year of Zhenghe, Lady Xie suddenly felt labor pains and called a maid to summon her husband. Wang Renzheng hurried to arrange incense offerings, first bowing to Heaven and Earth, then to ancestors. Red clouds filled the sky with fragrant auspiciousness. He thought, “In the cold of midwinter, how can such radiant clouds appear? This must be a sign of the child’s auspiciousness.” The household and servants rejoiced, bringing forth a living treasure. Renzheng took the child in his arms, seeing a handsome boy with clear brows, bright eyes, high forehead, and prominent nose—no ordinary child. “First, the Wang family’s generations of virtue; second, last year’s prayer at Huashan Temple moved the divine; thus this child was granted, extending the Wang lineage and fulfilling our lifelong hopes and goodness.” He instructed Wang Xing to prepare a banquet for the third day’s celebration. Neighbors, relatives, and friends all came to congratulate. The household was busy for days, and as spring neared, the festivities grew even livelier.

As the full moon approached, officials from Xianyang County and countless officers from Chang’an came to congratulate. Carriages and horses came and went in endless numbers, the commotion lasting days. Truly:

Carriages and horses fill the gate as if to a grand assembly,  
Good friends fill the seats like a banquet of Fangzhu.  
If not for vast accumulated virtue and yin merit,  
How could a true immortal descend in a jade carriage?
