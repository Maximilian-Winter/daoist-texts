# Chapter Two: Lin Lingsu’s Profound Discourse on the Dao and Virtue — Lü Dongbin Protects the Realm and Exorcises Evil

**Poem:**

How much of fame and profit is right or wrong?  
Better to step back and hide within the mountains.  
Abandon scholar and warrior, harboring resentment,  
Seek the dao, pursue the mysterious, and perceive the moment.  
When the nature of things remains unclear, it is hard to grasp,  
But when heartfelt feelings are released, do not oppose.  
From now on, shatter the sour jar of bitterness,  
Leap beyond the cage, mount the crane and soar.

Now it happened that the two immortals Zhong and Lü were roaming the Zhongnan Mountains, and they came upon the lively household of the Wang family, bustling with activity. Immortal Zhong said, “This is the place where the Perfected True Man Tongcheng Wang Sheng descends and ascends. The full moon is near; lest he forget the past causes, I shall accompany you to enlighten him once more. What harm is there?” The two immortals then transformed their forms, becoming two Daoist companions on a wandering pilgrimage. How were they dressed? Behold:

One wore a bamboo hat, a robe with a hundred sleeves, splattered with mud; the other wore straw sandals, a garment hung with a thousand needles, tattered and ragged. One had three strands of long beard flowing straight, singing Daoist ballads with a clear, resonant voice; the other’s beard was thick and bushy, holding a fish drum that sounded clattering and lively. Truly, they were carefree transcendent companions beyond the mundane, masters of the subtle mysteries, feathered ones of the Dao.

The two immortals arrived at the Wang family gate and struck the fish drum, singing a Daoist song:

In former days, myriad immortals entered the imperial capital,  
Faithful officials prayed to the Jade Qilin.  
The Perfected True Man, by imperial decree, descended from the heavens,  
Intent on renewing the profound thread day by day.  
Planting golden lotuses, ferrying the world’s people,  
Teaching squarely, naturally communing with the spirits.  
The Dao’s breeze opened the Song dynasty,  
The mysterious fate stirred the primordial stars.  
Bright moon and clear wind are everywhere,  
Fish Terrace firmly seated, mending the silk fishing lines.

At that moment, the lord of the house was seeing guests out the door. Seeing the two Perfected True Daoist companions singing and drumming, he hurried forward and bowed, saying, “I did not know that two venerable Daoists would grace this humble abode, bringing auspicious qi and illuminating the place. I hope you do not disdain the dust and bustle. Please come inside the main hall to sit and converse.” The two immortals saw his earnest hospitality and genuine kindness, and returned his bow, saying, “Since you do not disdain our tattered appearance, how could we refuse your invitation?”

The three courteously urged each other and entered the hall, exchanging formal greetings once more, then took seats according to guest and host. They quickly ordered Wang Xingqian to prepare a simple vegetarian feast. The two immortals said, “Though we wander amid the mortal world, we have long abstained from smoke and fire. Your invitation shows your sincere heart for the dao.” The lord, seeing they did not partake of cooked food, grew even more respectful and hastened to bring pears and fruits to express his reverence. The immortals laughed, “We are not beggars come to eat. We have heard that you have recently had a son; may we be granted a glimpse? We wonder at your intention.” The benevolent lord smiled, “The little one was just born, today is the full moon. Since you love to see him, how could I refuse?” He ordered Wang Xing to notify his wife and quickly brought the young master out to the outer hall.

The two immortals took the child’s hand and looked upon him. They saw a faint smile on his face. Immortal Zhong said, “This child’s eyebrows are clear and eyes bright, forehead high and jaw square, nose prominent and ears large. He will not be a mortal thing; surely he will become a person of the Jade Capital.” Immortal Lü said, “This child’s appearance is extraordinary; he will become a great vessel. Yet his minor fortunes lack some clarity. He will lose his father first, then his mother. First he will study letters, then enter the martial path. In the future, husband and wife will share the realm of Penglai, and the nine clans and seven ancestors will all receive grace. He must be given a resounding and auspicious name, so that his roots may be firm and his nurture easy.” The benevolent lord clasped his hands and ordered a maid to carry the child back to the inner chamber, then stepped forward and bowed deeply, saying, “I beg the two immortal masters to bestow a name upon the little one, so he may receive immortal blessings and live long, thus showing my lifelong sincere heart for goodness. May the two immortal masters be pleased to comply?” The two immortals rejoiced, “We see this child will be both literary and martial, becoming a noble official. He will surely have much blessing, long life, and many sons. For these three great auspices, name him Jia, with the courtesy name Yunqing.”

The benevolent lord was greatly pleased and bowed again, “As the masters say, the Wang clan’s lineage is hopeful, and I am content. Masters, do not journey far; our back garden is quite serene. Please come to the back garden to rest. Though you do not eat cooked food, I shall prepare some fruits to offer.” The two immortals laughed, “Our traces are uncertain, our hearts not fixed. We must now take our leave.” The lord said, “May I keep the names of the two masters, so that in the future we may meet again?” Immortal Zhong said, “I am surnamed Jin, named Chongjian.” Immortal Lü said, “I am surnamed Chang, named Wuxin. This is our only farewell; we shall not meet again, but you may see us in your son’s future.” The lord saw them out the great gate; they transformed into a whirlwind and suddenly vanished. Knowing they were divine immortals descending, he bowed to the empty sky, praying silently for their protection. Returning home, he painted a scroll of their immortal portraits and offered incense and devotion. No more need be told.

At that time, Emperor Huizong loved the dao and bestowed upon the alchemists Xu Zhichang the title Master Chongxu, Xu Shouxin the title Master Jingxu, and Liu Hunkang the title Master Xuanmiao Chonghe. In the spring of the year of the Wood Horse, Wang Wenqing of Fuzhou passed away by shijie (liberation of the corpse) and was posthumously titled Perfected True Man of Concentrated Spirit Hall, Serving the Celestial Throne, and Master Chongxu Miaohuan. Li Siguang of Jishui in Ji’an Prefecture became immortal; the emperor ordered a temple built in his honor. The Daoist Lin Lingsu, styled Suichang, had in youth shaved his head to become a monk, but suffered harsh beatings and scoldings from his master, so he abandoned monkhood for the dao. Traveling into Shu, he sought the right mystery and met the Right Profound True Man Zhao Sheng, enduring years of diligent cultivation to receive the transmitted dao arts. Later, wandering between the Huai and Si rivers begging alms, he was insulted by monks. He lodged at the Taiyi Palace in the capital, recommended by Xu Zhichang. The emperor summoned him, and Lingsu boldly declared:

“Heaven has nine layers of clouds, but the Divine Cloud is highest. Its administration is called the Supreme Divine Cloud Mansion, ruled by the Unsurpassed Jade Purity King, the eldest son of the Supreme Emperor, lord of the south, styled the Great Emperor of Longevity — that is Your Majesty. Next is the Eastern Flower Emperor, Cai Jing, the Left Original Immortal Elder. Wang Fu is the Literary Official Sheng Zhang. Concubine Liu is the Nine Flower Peaceful Consort.” The emperor was greatly pleased and trusted him more. It turned out the emperor had once dreamt of roaming the Divine Cloud, secretly confirming Lingsu’s words.

The emperor often worried about border affairs. Lingsu said, “The Liao realm is self-absorbed and neglectful; why would it have leisure to raid?” That winter, the Jurchen Wanyan Aguda rebelled against Liao, capturing Jiangning Prefecture and counties. In the spring of the year of the Wood Sheep, Aguda proclaimed himself emperor, renamed himself Shizu, founding the Jin dynasty, the Great Jin, with the era title Shouguo. That autumn, he attacked Huanglong Prefecture, reaching the Hun and Tong rivers, but lacked boats to cross. A deity carried him across, water reaching the horses’ bellies, and thus Huanglong fell. The frontier officials reported to Bianjing; the emperor summoned Lingsu, saying, “Your words have been verified.” In the spring of the year of the Fire Monkey, Lingsu was granted the title Master Tongzhen Daling. In April, he was ordered to convene Daoists at the Shangqing Palace.

At first, the emperor worried because he had no heir. Daoist Liu Hunkang said that the northwest of the capital was low and should be raised, promising many sons. The emperor ordered the hills raised several zhang, and then the palace bore more children, increasing his faith in Daoism. In the ninth month of autumn, the emperor assumed the sacred title of Jade Emperor and ordered all the blessed caves and lands to build palaces and temples, sculpting sacred images.

Suddenly, ghosts and demons appeared in the palace, manifesting by day, stealing gold and treasures, violating concubines, and giving no rest. All were terrified. The emperor summoned Lingsu to quell them, but the disturbances ceased only to resume. The emperor prayed with utmost sincerity, offering petitions and performing rituals. One day, while napping, he saw a Daoist wearing a green lotus crown, a purple crane cloak, holding a crystal ruyi scepter, bowing to the emperor, saying, “I come by the emperor’s command to eliminate these demons.” After a while, a golden-armored deity appeared, seized the demon, tore it apart, and devoured it. The emperor asked, “Who is the golden-armored deity?” The Daoist replied, “He is the enfeoffed Chongning True Lord Guan Yu.” The emperor asked, “Where is Zhang Fei?” Guan Yu said, “Fei and I have been brothers through many kalpas, always men in every life. In the Tang dynasty, he was Zhang Xun; now he serves Your Majesty’s realm, born in Xiangzhou’s Yue family. One day he will serve Your Majesty, aiding in the restoration, and Fei will merit great honor.” The emperor asked the Daoist’s name; he said, “My surname is Yang, born on the fourteenth day of the fourth month.” The emperor awoke and asked Lingsu, who said, “This is Immortal Lü.” The emperor decreed that all honor the Pure Yang Mysterious Dao True Man title and uphold the rites.

In the year of the Fire Rooster, Jin changed its era to Tianfu. In autumn, the emperor visited Shangqing Palace and commanded Lingsu to lecture on the Dao scriptures. Every time a grand ritual was held, costing millions of coins, it was called the Thousand Dao Assembly, with Daoists from all over the realm gathering. One day, a mad Daoist, after the feast, wished to thank the emperor, saying, “Your Majesty’s love of the dao is truly admirable, yet you cannot avoid the northern calamity.” The emperor was surprised and asked, “Are you not Immortal Lü?” He replied, “My surname is Li, not Lü. I will return to Min; at the hours of noon, afternoon, fire, and earth, I shall visit the northern chariot again.” After speaking, he suddenly vanished. The emperor asked Lingsu, who said, “I have heard of a Li Ti in Min, who fits this description.” The emperor ordered a statue placed beside the Lü Patriarch.

In the year of the Earth Dog, in April, the Daoist Bureau submitted a memorial, naming the emperor as the Daoist Lord Sovereign Emperor, so that all memorials and petitions would follow Daoist rites. An edict was issued to build palaces and temples everywhere, carving the emperor’s image, and inscribing heavenly books in seal script. Lingsu was given the title Master Tongzhen Daling Yuanmiao, and Zhang Xubai the title Master Tongxuan Chongmiao. As for the princes competing to enter Daoism, people called them the two Daoist mansions. Zhang Xubai was from Dengzhou, versed in Taiyi and Liuren, meeting strange beings who transmitted the dao. The emperor heard his name and summoned him to preside over the Taiyi Palace, entering and exiting the palace, speaking only of the dao and virtue, never of affairs. Later, seeing the court in chaos, he resigned and traveled to Wuling, drinking with Old Woman Cui, then liberated his corpse and departed. Later, villagers met him again in Yangzhou, and he sent a poem to Old Woman Cui:

By Wuling Creek, Old Woman Cui drinks wine,  
In heaven there is none, but on earth there is.  
From the southern land of the dao, she drinks a bucket,  
Drunkenly lying deep at the White Cloud cavern’s mouth.

In the year of the Earth Dog, the era changed to Chonghe. In the year of the Metal Pig, the era changed to Xuanhe. Buddhist titles were changed to Great Awakening Golden Immortal, monks to virtuous scholars, clothing altered, and original surnames restored. Temples were renamed palaces and temples, nuns became female virtues.

In the summer of the year of the Metal Rat, the era changed to Yuande. Lingsu was found guilty and banished to the countryside. He told his disciples, “I am about to depart. You may carry my coffin to the foot of the southern mountain; where the earth breaks, bury me there.” After speaking, he passed away. The disciples followed his words, reaching the foot of the southern mountain, where indeed the earth was broken. They dug down and found it unfathomably deep, so they lowered the coffin and buried him. The next day, they looked again, but the place was level and showed no sign of burial. News reached the emperor, who sighed deeply.

That winter, Fang La rebelled in Muzhou, capturing Wuzhou, Shezhou, and Quzhou, then besieging Hangzhou, holding it for several years. In Huainan, Song Jiang and thirty-six others, corresponding to the heavenly gang’s number, formed a stronghold at Liangshan, receiving a dream from the Mysterious Lady of the Nine Heavens, who bestowed heavenly books and yellow-and-white arts. They rampaged through the northern rivers and plains, plundering eastern prefectures; government troops dared not resist. Zhang Shuye knew Haizhou and advised the court to show virtue and intent, persuading Song Jiang and others to surrender. They were then ordered to join the campaign against Fang La in Hangzhou, with eunuch Tong Guan combining forces to attack. Most of Song Jiang’s forces perished at Water Margin. Fang La’s army was defeated and fled to Bangyuan Cave. Han Shizhong served as general under Wang Yuan, secretly moving through valleys, asking a wild woman for a path, killing dozens, and capturing Fang La. The Muzhou rebellion was quelled.

Suddenly, demons and ghosts caused unrest in the palace, disturbing the night without cease, sometimes appearing as a great turtle, sometimes taking human form, impervious to weapons. The emperor was greatly troubled. Officials reported, “A Daoist named Chang Xuzhong from Songshan is skilled in dao arts and able to quell demons.” The emperor ordered him summoned. On the way, a Daoist presented a poem:

From afar I point to the high peak and laugh once,  
Red clouds and purple mists arise before my face.  
Though I wander dusty markets, none recognize me,  
I often dwell in the mountains where cranes greet me.  
At times I play with jade and moon, driving away ghosts,  
By day I boil the golden cauldron, cooking precious nectar.  
One day, if I attend the Penglai assembly,  
You will know my alchemical writings bear my name.

The emperor considered the poem’s meaning, thinking the character “Chang” and “Xuzhong” meant “Lü.” From then on, the palace demons ceased, and reverence increased. No more need be told.

Meanwhile, in Chengdu lived Xie Shi, styled Runfu, a learned man versed in change, who had received the dao of Patriarch Lü. Using character analysis to predict human fortune and misfortune, all were marvelously accurate, and he was famed in the imperial court. Summoned to the back garden, he divined for concubines and the crown prince, never failing. The emperor rewarded him richly, appointing him to the rank of Chengxin Lang. Shi knew the north was troubled and soon returned to Shu.

In the spring of the year of the Water Tiger, Jin attacked Liao; the Liao ruler fled to Yunzong. Jin conquered the western capital; Liao enthroned Jin Wang Chun as emperor, with the capital at Yanjing. That winter, Song allied with Jin to attack Liao, capturing Yanjing; Liao ruler Chun fled to Tiande.

In the autumn of the year of the Wood Rabbit, the Jin ruler Wen died; his brother Sheng ascended as Jin Taizong, changing the era to Tianhui. At that time, Wang Jiannian was twelve years old, versed in classics and histories, all schools of thought. Suddenly, his father died without illness; family affairs were managed by his mother and Wang Xing. Since he was not yet established, he only wept bitterly. Lady Xie, worried for her young son, wept deeply, fearing for his health, but comforted him kindly: “The old live a hundred years; death will come in time. Your father was over sixty, not short-lived. You must study hard and seek advancement; then even if your father is in the underworld, his heart will be at peace.” Yunqing heeded his mother and resolved to study. He replied, “I think the world is in turmoil; Song now allies with Jin to destroy Liao; Jin is strong and will surely cross south to destroy Song. These years are the time for martial men to advance. I think it best to abandon letters and enter the martial path, to protect myself and establish a career, and to assist the nation and secure the realm. This is my wish; I beg my mother to decide.” Lady Xie thought, “Though my son is young, his words are extraordinary. Though he does not yet understand affairs, he speaks of state matters. He will not be a mere fish in a pond; he awaits the time of wind and cloud.” She said to him, “I am but a woman with little insight; I only hope you grow to establish your career. Whether letters or martial, I will follow your wishes.”

From then on, Yunqing changed his name to Zhongfu, practicing archery and wielding stones and knives at home. At eighteen, he changed his name to Shixiong, took the imperial exam, and married the daughter of the military commander of Chang’an city. The next year, his mother fell ill and died. He observed mourning for three years. At twenty-four, he took the exam again, placing thirty-sixth among the successful candidates, then returned home to tend the graves and offer ancestral rites. No more need be told.

Meanwhile, Song appointed Zhang Shangying as prime minister. After a long drought, on the night Zhang Shangying took office, heavy rain fell. The emperor was pleased and inscribed the characters “Shanglin” (Heavenly Rain) for him. A hunchbacked Daoist and his disciple sought alms. Zhang Shangying jested, “As a Daoist, do you have any dao arts?” They answered, “We can mold earth into incense.” Zhang took some earth from beside the steps, molded and burned it; a wondrous fragrance filled the air. When the smoke cleared, the Daoist was gone, leaving a poem on the table:

Molding earth into incense has its cause,  
In this world, falsehood should not be made true.  
The emperor’s prime minister, Zhang Tianjue,  
Wanders the world like Lü Dongbin.

Zhang Shangying regretted not recognizing him, and from then on gave up worldly ambitions, turning to the dao. Later, falsely accused by He Zhizhong, he was demoted to magistrate of Henan Prefecture, then further demoted to military governor of Chengxin. Seeing affairs worsen, he abandoned office and traveled to Zhongnan to seek the dao, meeting two immortals who said, “You have been asleep; now you awaken.” Zhang was amazed, bowed, and asked their names. They said, “Speaking of recent times, Fan Li and Zhang Liang; of ancient times, Qi Bo and Feng Hou. You have traveled with Master Lü; how hard is it to attain the dao?” Zhang begged for transmission to save the world. The two masters gave him secret formulas and urged him to cultivate diligently, then departed. Zhang chose a place to practice. No more need be told.

In the spring of the year of the Wood Snake, Jin captured the Liao ruler Yanshi and the Eastern Liao ceased. Yelü Dashi proclaimed himself emperor at Qierman, founding the Western Liao De Emperor, with the era name Yanqing. At that time, Song ennobled eunuch Tong Guan as Prince of Guangyang. Zhang Shangying sighed, “Strong enemies arise outside, the nation suffers many calamities, eunuchs are made princes — never before in history. This fall of the nation can only be awaited.” He then entered southern Yunnan to cultivate. Soon, his elixir was complete and he transcended the world. Truly:

Though the path is distant, it can be sought;  
Loyalty to protect the realm brings natural rest.  
Today, I care not for worldly affairs,  
Mounting cranes and phoenixes, I return to the Ten Continents.
