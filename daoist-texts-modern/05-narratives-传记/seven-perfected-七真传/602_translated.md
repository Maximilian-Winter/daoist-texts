# Chapter Three: Yue Pengju Risks Life to Aid the Restoration; Wang Shixiong Is Demoted Amidst the Emptiness of Worldly Affairs

**Verse:**

The will of mortals must be firm and true,  
To aid the realm and learn from sages’ view.  
A heart of loyalty upholds the land,  
Though hidden feelings yet to stand,  
A noble spirit soars to Heaven’s blue.  
Embracing innate vigor through and through,  
Now casting worldly cares away,  
To end dusty passions, seek the true lead’s ray.  
*(Tune: "Chasing Clouds Flying")*

It was the winter of the Yi-branch year. The Jin armies invaded by separate routes. The Song emperor summoned General Zhong Shidao as the Commander of the Two Rivers, and Yao Pingzhong accompanied him to Bianjing. The emperor, seeing the Jin forces pressing closer each day, fled eastward to avoid the troops. Li Gang requested leave to hold the title of Crown Prince to guard the realm; the emperor immediately abdicated. Crown Prince Huan ascended as Emperor Qinzong, honoring the former emperor as the Retired Emperor and establishing the Zhu clan as empress. In the spring of the Bing-wu year, the reign title changed to Jingkang. In the twelfth month, the army was routed at Liyang, and the Jin crossed the river. Li Gang was appointed Governor of Dongjing, commanding the troops to aid the defense. The Jin besieged Bianjing; Li Gang fought fiercely, repeatedly repelling them. The Jin sought peace, sending Prince Kang as hostage.

Zhong and Yao’s troops arrived and launched a night attack on the Jin camp. The Jin general Hou Shi detected them and sallied forth, engaging in battle. The Jin camp was roused early, and all forces rushed to the fray. Zhong Shidao, commanding from the rear, saw the Jin’s overwhelming strength and dared not fight recklessly; he retreated while fighting, gradually withdrawing. Yao Pingzhong’s troops were in front, deeply encircled. Twenty thousand elite soldiers were trapped. Yao Pingzhong, known for unmatched bravery, charged left and right, carving a bloody path. Riding a blue mule, he traveled seven hundred and fifty li in one day and night to Dengzhou to find food. Later, entering the Great Mian Mountain, he untied his mule and sat leaning against a rock, suddenly feeling his heart and mind cool and clear. A figure appeared ascending the mountain, saying, “You strive for such petty fame, causing the deaths of twenty thousand men; your sins are grave.” Pingzhong bowed and begged for salvation. The figure said, “I am Zhongli Quan of the Han, come to save you by resemblance of deeds.” He then imparted the Supreme Dao, instructing him to quietly nurture himself in the mountain cave; when the Dao is fulfilled, he must accumulate merit and practice. Pingzhong accepted and began his quiet cultivation. This was not recorded further.

That winter, the Jin seized all the counties east of the river and then took the Western Capital. An edict sent Prince Kang to the Jin; at Cizhou, the defender Zong Ze welcomed him and urged him not to go further.

In the beginning, Yue He of Tangyin County, Xiangzhou, was a true man descended five generations from Master Xulin. His wife, Lady Yao, was pregnant and dreamed of an armored man who said, “The Han’s Zhang Yide once lived here.” Upon waking, she soon gave birth to a son. A great bird like a swan flew and cried atop the house, so they named him Fei, styled Pengju. He was born on the fifteenth day of the second month in the Guiwei year of Chongning. Shortly after birth, a great flood rose; his mother held Fei in a large urn, floating with the waters. When they reached shore, both were unharmed. From youth, he bore a noble spirit, was steady and taciturn. The family was poor but diligent in study. Early on, he learned archery from Zhou Tong, never missing a shot. When Zhou Tong died, Fei visited his grave every new and full moon to offer sacrifices. When his father passed, he performed all funeral rites. He married Lady Li to care for his mother. He resumed study under Wei Zhong of Ximu Mountain, that is, the immortal Wei Boyang, and received the martial bell. At that time, many locals were bandits; his mother tattooed the words “Utmost loyalty to repay the realm” on Fei’s back to warn him. When Liu Shixuan pacified Zhending and recruited brave warriors, Fei joined, capturing many fierce bandits. Prince Kang appointed Fei as Chengxin Lang.

At that time, Prince Kang was at Cizhou. Visiting the shrine of Cui Jue, he rested briefly inside, waiting until dusk to slip away. In a haze, someone said, “Rise quickly, the pursuing troops are near!” The prince awoke startled, saw a horse under starlight, mounted and whipped it, leaping over water. At dawn, soldiers of Xiangzhou welcomed him in; the horse stood stiffly—it was the clay horse from Cui’s shrine.

The Jin besieged the capital, demanding the emperor’s surrender. They sent an envoy with a sacrificial edict to Xiangzhou, ordering Prince Kang as Commander-in-Chief of Hebei troops to lead forces to defend. The army was defeated; the emperor negotiated peace with the Jin camp.

In the spring of the Ding-wei year, the emperor was captured in the Jin camp. The Jin generals forced him to change clothes. Minister Li Ruoshui cursed the invaders and was killed. Liu Shi hanged himself; after eighty days, his body was laid out, still looking alive. In the second month, the Jin abducted the empress, crown prince, and royal kin; only Empress Meng was spared, living in exile. The Jin installed the minor official Zhang Bangchang as Emperor of Chu. That summer, the Jin took two emperors and three thousand captives northward. Empress Meng sent a letter by hand, ordering Prince Kang to succeed the throne. The ministers firmly petitioned for rightful succession; thus, he ascended in Ying Tian Prefecture as Emperor Gaozong of the Southern Song, changing the reign title to Jianyan, honoring Empress Meng as Empress Dowager Yuanyou. Zong Ze was appointed Governor of the Capital, ordering Yue Fei to rout the Jin, promoting him to commander.

In the spring of the Wu-shen year, Jin Wushu invaded Bianjing; Zong Ze was defeated. He was suppressed by Huang and Wang’s memorials, developed a tumor on his back, and died. Du Chong replaced him but betrayed Zong Ze, leading to military defeat.

In the Ji-you year, the emperor fled to Zhenjiang, defended by Lü Yihao. The emperor arrived at Jiangning, renaming it Jiankang. He appointed his son as crown prince but soon passed away. He sent Hong Hao as envoy to the Jin to inquire about the two emperors, but Hong was detained at Lengshan. In July, Wushu invaded Bianjing; Du Chong abandoned the city and fled. The emperor fled to Hangzhou, renaming it Lin’an. That winter, Du Chong rebelled and defected to the Jin; all armies collapsed. Wushu invaded south; the emperor fled to Mingzhou. Wushu took Lin’an; the emperor sailed by sea.

---

In the spring of the Geng-xu year, the Jin pursued the emperor. Zhang Gongyu, commander of Haizhou, defeated them. The emperor arrived at Wenzhou, anchoring at the foot of Jin’ao Island. While touring, he saw a steep stone wall inscribed with a poem:

*A boat lies crosswise at Weitou’s oyster bed,  
The setting sun waits for the tide to spread.  
With you, I’ll not betray our climbing vow,  
Together we’ll walk the back of Jin’ao’s brow.*  
*(Inscribed by Xu Shenweng)*

The emperor marveled and said to his attendants, “When I was born, Xu Shenweng presented this poem to the Retired Emperor, transforming it; who could have known it would apply to today!” The emperor returned to Yuezhou. At that time, Han Shizhong dealt a great defeat to Wushu on the river. Wushu sought to advance on Jiankang, but Yue Fei ambushed him at Niutou Mountain. Yue Fei’s eldest son, Yue Yun, twelve years old, wielded twin hammers in battle; Wushu was defeated again and fled the river. Han Shizhong blocked the Jin at Jinshan; Wushu used fire attack but escaped. The two emperors were relocated to Wuguo City. The Jin installed Liu Yu as Emperor of Qi.

In the Xin-hai year, the Song changed the reign title to Shaoxing, appointing Zhang Jun as Commander of Jianghuai, with Yue Fei as deputy. Zhang Jun sent his son Zhang Xian under Yue Fei’s command. Fei led Zhang Xian, Niu Gao, Wang Gui, Yue Yun, and others to pacify Jianghuai completely. Empress Dowager Meng passed away. Qin Hui and Lü Yihao became left and right vice ministers; Hu Anguo was demoted from overseeing Xiandu Temple. Zhang Jun was recalled to govern Xihe. That summer, Yue Fei captured Qianzhou. The emperor wrote four characters, “Utmost Loyalty, Yue Fei,” and bestowed a banner.

---

In the spring of the Yi-mao year, the Jin ruler Sheng passed away. His nephew Bingbing succeeded as Emperor Xizong, continuing the Great Jin title. The emperor appointed Zhao Ding and Zhang Jun as left and right vice ministers. Zhang Jun wished to recommend his friend Su Yunqing as successor; Su Yunqing declined and sent a poem back to the envoy. Zhang Jun read:

*Years apart, a family’s way has grown,  
Who knew idle fame would reach the throne?  
Fools covet wealth and rank in vain,  
Do not soil Su Gong with worldly stain.*

Zhang Jun sighed endlessly. Later, someone saw Su Yunqing in Yixing, looking younger; in a blink, he vanished. That summer, Yue Fei was ennobled as Marquis of E and sent to defeat Yang Mo. The emperor summoned Zhang Jun back; Fei said, “Please grant me eight days; I will capture Yang Mo.” Indeed, in eight days, Yang Mo was beheaded. Zhang Jun sighed, “Marquis Yue is a master strategist.”

In the summer of the Bing-chen year, Yue Fei took leave to mourn his mother. An edict recalled him. Fei petitioned to recover the Central Plains, but the emperor refused; so he returned.

In the Ding-yi year, He Xian returned from Jin and first heard of the deaths of the Retired Emperor and Empress Dowager. The emperor donned mourning clothes. An edict ordered Yue Fei to station at Jiangzhou.

In the spring of the Wu-wu year, Jin changed the reign title to Tianjuan. The emperor settled the capital at Lin’an, appointing Qin Hui as prime minister. Wang Lun came with Jin envoys to negotiate peace and return lands; Qin Hui strongly advocated it. Yue Fei submitted a memorial: “The prime minister’s schemes are not wholesome for the realm.” Qin Hui bore a deep grudge. Wang Lun was detained by the Jin at Hejian Prefecture and hanged himself.

In the Geng-shen year, Wushu again seized Henan and Shaanxi prefectures; Wu Lin was defeated at Fufeng. Wushu used iron floating towers but was broken by Liu Xi. Yue Fei advanced to recover the Western Capital, leaving a large army at Yingchang. Wushu came with cavalry; Fei ordered blades made of hemp to cut their horses’ legs. Wushu increased forces and fought; Yue Yun was defeated. Wushu’s army was routed and sought to return north. Qin Hui wished to negotiate peace, urging the emperor to order generals to retreat and summoning Yue Fei back with a Jin-issued edict. Fei wept in anger and led troops back to E. Wushu retook Henan counties. Qin Hui accused Zhang Jiucheng and six others of slandering him; all were demoted. Jiucheng called himself Wugouzi, an incarnation of Wen Chang, versed in Buddhist and Daoist scriptures. Demoted to Shaozhou, he later secluded himself to write. This was not recorded further.

In the Xin-you year, Jin changed the reign title to Huangtong. Wushu took Shouchun. An edict ordered Zhang Jun and Liu Fu to rescue it; the Jin fled. An edict recalled the army, appointing Han Shizhong and Zhang Jun as Privy Councilors, Yue Fei as deputy. Qin Hui slandered Fei, removing him to serve at Wanshou Temple. Qin Hui forged an edict imprisoning Fei. Peace was concluded; the court submitted to Jin. On New Year’s Eve, Qin Hui forced Fei to hang in prison; Zhang Xian and Yue Yun were beheaded and their heads displayed in the market. That day, the sky darkened. Yue Fei once dreamed of two dogs quarreling. Crossing the river, he heard the monk Dao Yue at Jinshan predict the future. He went to ask him, telling of the dream. Dao Yue said, “The two dogs quarreling signify ‘prison.’ I advise the general to hide and escape to avoid the calamity.” Fei laughed and did not believe it—until he was caught at Fengbo Pavilion. Qin Hui confiscated Fei’s family property and exiled them to Lingnan. Fei’s daughter Yinping drowned herself. Han Shizhong was removed to serve at Liquan Temple, then closed his door and lived in seclusion, drinking alone.

---

In the Ren-xu year, Jin returned the remains of Emperor Huizong’s Empress Dowager. Empress Dowager Wei arrived. Qin Hui was made Grand Preceptor and Duke of Wei. At that time, Xie Shi traveled to Lin’an, taking the character “Xiang” as his name. The emperor met him, striking the ground with a staff to write “Xiang.” Xie said, “Adding one stroke to earth makes ‘king.’ Please write another character.” The emperor wrote “Wen.” Xie was startled, “Left and right are ‘lord,’ the ruler himself.” The emperor said, “Say no more; I will summon you tomorrow.” The next day, summoned, the emperor wrote “Spring” on a side hall wall, ordering Xie to interpret it. Xie said, “Qin’s head is too heavy, pressing down the sun’s brightness.” The emperor was silent, gave rewards, and dismissed him. Qin Hui heard this and secretly framed Xie, exiling him to Lingnan. This was not recorded further.

Meanwhile, Wang Shixiong once served as Commander of Chang’an for three years. When the Jin invaded the passes, he joined forces with deputy commander Wu Lin at Tongzhou, defeating Jin at Fufeng and retaking Shaanxi city. Later, he was promoted to chief of the Western Route, guarding Tongguan. This was not recorded further.

Now, outside the west gate of Ninghai Prefecture, Dengzhou, about five li from the city, lived a wealthy family surnamed Ma, with son Yifu. His mother, while pregnant, dreamed that the Immortal Maiden Magu bestowed a single pill, which she swallowed before awakening to give birth. He was born on the twentieth day of the fifth month in the Gui-mao year of Jintianhui. From youth, he was wise, often chanting poems of riding clouds and cranes. Li Wumeng saw him and said, “This child is truly immortal material.” The family was immensely wealthy, also called Ma Banzhou. He married Lady Sun, daughter of Sun Xianzhong from the village. Lady Sun was born on the fifth day of the first month in the Ji-hai year of Song Huizong’s Xuanhe era. Her mother dreamed of a white crane carrying her auspiciously; upon waking, she conceived. Lady Sun had delicate brows and bright eyes, naturally clever and beautiful as a fish sinking or a wild goose descending, with the grace of moon-hidden flowers and shy blossoms. She loved calligraphy and poetry, often composing couplets with her husband, rivaling the young Su Shi. Though their elders died early, the couple was blessed with handsome sons and beautiful daughters, joyful from dawn to dusk, though still burdened with household affairs. Fortunately, their wealth allowed many servants. When the Jin invaded, fearing chaos, they were born on the fringe and escaped disaster. This was not recorded further.

In the autumn of the Yi-chou year, a comet appeared. Zhang Jun was demoted to Lianzhou after discussing current affairs.

In the Bing-yin year, Liu Ziyu died. Initially, Minister Zhu Song was ill and entrusted family matters to Ziyu, teaching his son Zhu Jia, later establishing him in Daoist righteousness. This was not recorded further.

In the Wu-chen year, Jin Grand Preceptor Wushu died; Wanyan Liang became prime minister.

In the Ji-si winter, Wanyan Liang was upright and self-reliant, changing the reign title to Tiande. He massacred royal clansmen and indulged in debauchery. He moved the capital back to Yanjing. Song ministers wished to attack Jin, but Qin Hui opposed.

In the Geng-wu summer, Shi Quan attempted to assassinate Qin Hui on the road but failed. In the Xin-wei year, King Han Shizhong of Xianping died.

In the Jia-xu year, the Western Liao ruler Yilie died; his wife was appointed regent as Empress Chengfu, changing the reign title to Chongfu.

In the Yi-hai autumn, Qin Hui plotted rebellion, imprisoning Zhang Jun and other worthies, but suddenly fell ill and lost speech. He was made King of Jiankang and ordered to retire; he died that night. The emperor began to see Qin Hui’s treachery, ordering the purge of Qin’s faction, exiling them to remote prefectures. Zhang Jun, Hu Yin, Zhang Jiucheng, and others were reinstated.

In the Bing-zi summer, Jin changed the reign title to Zhenglong. Emperor Qinzong died in Jin captivity.

In the Ji-mao spring, Zhang Jiucheng oversaw Taiping Temple in Jiangzhou, predicting Jin’s defeat and peace. He recommended Chen Kangbo and Zhu Jia. In June, a heavenly envoy came to escort Jiucheng; he sat upright and passed away. That autumn, Zhu Jia was summoned but did not come; Chen Kangbo was made Right Vice Minister.

In the Geng-chen winter, envoy Yu Yunwen was sent to Jin to offer New Year greetings. The Jin ruler said, “I will go see flowers in Luoyang.” Yunwen returned with the report. Kangbo requested to use Wu Lin, Liu Yi, and Wang Gang to command troops for defense.

In the Xin-si autumn, Jin launched a major invasion of Jianghuai; Wang Gang and Wu Lin defeated them. The Jin ruler’s forces were routed crossing the Huai; Liu Yi and Zhang deployed troops at Huaiyin to follow. The Song emperor personally led the campaign; Kangbo requested Yunwen to assist in military planning. Wanyan Liang advanced to Yangzhou, besieging Caishi. Yunwen led troops to intercept and slaughter the Jin, killing Wanyan Liang in battle. Yunwen and others requested the emperor to withdraw. In the tenth month of winter, the Jin installed Wulu at Liaoyang, renaming him Yong, as Jin Shizong, changing the reign title to Dading.

In the Ren-wu year, the Song emperor passed the throne to Crown Prince Ge, becoming Emperor Xiaozong. Gaozong was honored as Retired Emperor. Zhang Jun was summoned to pacify Jianghuai and restored Yue Fei’s rank, giving him a proper burial at West Lake. At that time, Wei Sheng of Suqian raised troops and retook Haizhou. Sheng was skilled with a great blade; the Jin fled at his sight. Sheng was childhood friends with Wang Shixiong, both sworn to serve the realm.

Earlier, Wang Shixiong guarded Louwo Pass. Seeing the Jin repeatedly defeated, he wished to avenge the two emperors. Qin Hui, however, advocated peace and submission to Jin. Wang Shixiong, deeply resentful, composed a satirical poem on the Spring Official, implying Qin’s treachery. The emperor approved the poem but demoted Wang.

Demoted, Shixiong returned to Xianyang at age forty-seven, sighing aloud:

“Confucius was not perplexed at forty,  
Mencius unmoved at forty;  
I have passed that age, yet still swallow foul and rotten,  
Clutching purple and gold—how foolish am I?”

He spoke with his wife, Lady He: “I see bowing to prime ministership and marquisates all like floating clouds and purple mists; wearing gold and jade belts—how unlike the carefree man beyond worldly things! Now, luckily demoted, I will not grow old trapped in officialdom. If I do not awaken and retreat quickly, I fear sinking deep into the sea of suffering.”  
His wife said, “There is a saying: ‘Serving a king is like serving a tiger; eating salary is like swallowing a hook.’ Now that you are demoted, what is there to worry about? Besides, we have reached the age of knowing fate, blessed with two sons, Jinbao and Jinyu, ensuring descendants; and our clothes and food suffice. Why seek elsewhere?”  
Shixiong replied, “Though your words are reasonable, worldly affairs are tangled like hemp, time flies swiftly, not waiting a breath; fate is not mine to hold. I wish to emulate Han’s Marquis of Liu, Yue’s Fan He, Jin’s Ge Hong, Tang’s Jia Dan—these all achieved merit and fame, attained the Dao and ascended immortality, sharing Heaven’s lifespan, merging with sun and moon’s light; some ride cranes to the Three Isles, others mount dragons and tigers to the Nine Heavens. When that time comes, how joyous it will be! Though I say this, I do not know if Heaven will follow human wishes.”  
His wife said, “If one has such wishes, Heaven must comply. But your words make me feel as if waking from a drunken dream, suddenly seeing the dust of the world as empty and fleeting. I hope you soon meet a wise master to receive the wondrous methods of self-cultivation, so we may practice together and ascend the immortal realm as husband and wife. Would that not be beautiful?”  
Shixiong laughed, “If I attain the Dao, when we meet on the path, I can teach you—let alone my wife! From now on, I will seek and inquire. If Heaven has compassion, and we have immortal roots, surely a true master will appear to transmit the Supreme Dao.”  

Truly:

*Fated seeds meet in this life,  
From now severing the red string’s ties.  
If not for the young bird’s descent then,  
How could one finger so swiftly rise?*
