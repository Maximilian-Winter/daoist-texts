# Chapter Four: At the Drunken Immortal Bridge, Shi Xiong Meets the Dao Patriarch; At the Liquor Spring Temple, Zhong and Lü Test the Mortal Heart

**Verse:**

Old karmic seeds once sown, the heart soon clears,  
Seeking to learn the true immortal’s dao.  
One draught of jade nectar, drunk to dream and rest,  
Water and fire reverse their roles.  
When flowers bloom, the infant clasps with tender hands;  
Beneath the bright moon, delights unknown to thought.  
Illusory realms are never true,  
Transformations end the thousand demons now—  
Fear not the coming of impermanence.  
*(Right tune: “White Snow Chant”)*

It is told that Wang Shi Xiong and his wife, both resolved in heart to seek the dao, entrusted their household affairs to their eldest son, Jin Yu. In the year of the Wood Rabbit, Shi Xiong journeyed to Zhongnan Mountain, arriving at the bridge by Gan River town. There he saw two Daoists sitting silently, their bearing like mists and clouds, their spirit soaring in the vast heavens.

Shi Xiong knew they were men of the dao and hurried forward with a bow, saying, “May I ask, honored immortals, which immortals descend here? From which immortal register do you hail? Where now do you cultivate in famous mountains or grottoes? What brings you to this place? For a mortal to behold immortal countenance is truly a blessing of three lifetimes. I humbly beg you, masters, to reveal the cause of this meeting.”

The two immortals smiled and replied, “Though we are not celestial immortals, we count as Daoist adepts beyond the dust. Born in different eras, skilled in arts both literary and martial. Yesterday we gathered at Penglai; this morning we journey to Qingcheng, resting here briefly. You now are cast down, your worldly passions diminished—what else do you seek?”

Hearing these words, Shi Xiong knew true immortals had descended. He prostrated himself deeply, saying, “Though I have slipped the reins of fame and gain, I cannot leap beyond the mortal world. My surname is lost in confusion; I have not reached the path of true cultivation. My mortal body is sullied and vulgar, hard to approach the land of learning the dao. I beseech the immortal masters to grant a thread of mystery, to open the path of awakening to my dullness. Grateful for your grace and virtue, I shall not forget even beyond death.”

Seeing his sincere heart, the two immortals bestowed upon him the secret formula of the Returning Elixir, instructing him step by step. They further said, “Next spring, on the sacred birthday of the Venerable Lord Lao, you may meet us again at the Liquor Spring Temple.” Then from their waist they took out a tiny gourd, and from their sleeve a wine cup, filling it full. Offering the cup to Shi Xiong, they said, “This is jade nectar, rare for mortals to encounter. Drink this cup and extend your life by a decade. Your karmic root is deep; today you have met your fate.”

Shi Xiong bowed in thanks and drank the cup. The wine was extraordinarily sweet. In his heart he thought, “Such fine wine—why not give me a few more cups?” The two immortals read his thought and said, “One cup is enough to sleep seven days; you must not drink more.” With that, they parted and transformed into a pure breeze, vanishing away.

Shi Xiong saw them dissolve into the wind and wished to return home. Suddenly his limbs went limp, and he collapsed drunk upon the bridge. Passersby saw a drunken man lying there, with a poem pinned to his robe’s collar:

*This man is no mortal here,  
Once summoned by imperial edict down to dust.  
Today he meets immortals, drunk on wine,  
Seven days he sleeps before waking clear.*

All said, “This is the Drunken Immortal!” Henceforth, the bridge was named Drunken Immortal Bridge. But that is another tale, not told here.

---

Meanwhile, Shi Xiong slept deeply on the bridge for seven days. The Gan River town lies at Zhongnan’s foot, some fifty or sixty li from Da Wei village, along a main road to Chang’an. News of the Drunken Immortal’s words soon reached his sons, Jin Yu and Jin Bao. The brothers conferred: their father had gone to Zhongnan and was missing for days—this was suspicious; also, the tale of the Drunken Immortal was strange and wondrous, and they wished to see for themselves.

The brothers sought out the Gan River town bridge and found the sleeper was their father. Seeing the poem on his collar, they knew he had met immortals, drunk their wine, and lay here intoxicated. They quickly hired a carriage and brought him home. When Shi Xiong awoke, he recounted the encounter with the immortals in detail, and all marveled.

Shi Xiong reflected that on the ninth day of the ninth month, he had met his masters and attained the dao, so he took the name Chongyang (Double Yang). Knowing himself enlightened and the principle clear, he changed his name to Zhiming (Knowing Bright). With the secret formula taught by the two masters, he and his wife pondered the profound mysteries daily, cultivating the wondrous dao together.

In the second month of the Gengchen year, he suddenly recalled their words and parted from his wife to journey southward, ascending Mount Taibai, seeking the Liquor Spring Temple.

---

The Liquor Spring Temple stood near the border of Duxian and Shengli counties, not far from Zhongnan town, about two hundred li from Da Wei village. One day, Chongyang reached Zhongnan’s foot, watching the sun set behind the western hills and the moon rise over the eastern sea. The inns were empty, the human smoke sparse. As he wandered in uncertainty, he suddenly saw a light shining through the forest.

Following the light, he entered the woods and found a tall mansion. An old man stood by the door lamp, on which was written the plain characters “Jia Mansion,” revealing the family name Jia. Chongyang bowed and said, “May I ask, sir, is this the Jia Mansion?”

The old man returned the bow, “This is indeed the Jia Mansion. The day grows late; what brings you here, guest? Pray tell me, so I may inform the mistress.”

Chongyang said, “I am Wang Shi Xiong from Da Wei village in Xianyang, seeking to offer incense at the Liquor Spring Temple. Passing your mansion late at night, with no inns or shops open, I saw your light and came seeking shelter. Seeing ‘Jia Mansion’ written, I know your surname is Jia. May I lodge here for the night?”

The old man replied, “Passing travelers may lodge as is proper. But my master has passed away; all affairs are under the mistress’s command. Please wait a moment while I inform her.”

Chongyang said, “Thank you, sir.” The old man went inside and soon returned, saying, “The mistress invites you in.”

---

The old man closed the great door and led the way, with Chongyang following. They passed many corridors and chambers until they reached a guest hall. The dwelling was elegant and tranquil, with corners arranged in varied heights. Inside the hall, on the walls hung calligraphy and paintings by famous hands—landscapes serene and graceful, full of poetic charm.

Suddenly, a girl of about fourteen or fifteen appeared, bearing a cup of fragrant tea. Soon the kitchen brought forth a sumptuous table laden with dishes, fine and exquisite. A pot of fine wine and two sets of cups and chopsticks were set.

Then three or four maidservants appeared, escorting a beauty like a blooming flower. Chongyang’s eyes beheld this woman’s adornment:

Her face was like the full moon, eyebrows two spring mountains;  
Her lips red as vermilion, eyes holding a pool of autumn waters.  
She wore robes of white silk, dignified as Yang Guifei of Tang;  
Her waist bound in a jade-green skirt, surpassing the beauty of Xi Shi of Wu.  
Her voice was like orioles singing sweetly, her smile like blossoms unfolding;  
Her hair like black clouds veiling willow leaves, her form like spring waters stirring peach blossoms.  
Her fragrance was orchid and musk, her tones like chimes of jade and gold.  
Truly she was:  
The moon palace’s Huan’e descended to mortal realms,  
The Jade Pool’s fairy maiden alighting the dusty world.

The woman stepped forward and bowed deeply, saying, “I did not expect the arrival of the elder uncle; I have not gone out to greet you, please forgive my rudeness.” Chongyang returned the bow, “I come to offer incense at the Liquor Spring Temple, passing by. The day is late, and I sought lodging; grateful for your kindness. I fear ‘elder uncle’ is a mistaken address.”

The woman smiled, “My late husband once said he knew Wang from Xianyang, a schoolmate and friend, a general with talents in both civil and martial arts. Seeing you now, your bearing is extraordinary; his words were not false.”

Chongyang said, “Decades of official toil have made me forget old friends. Your words grieve me. Has your husband left sons?”

The woman sighed, “Alas, my husband died years ago, leaving no heirs. Only this estate remains. Though filled with gold and silver, pearls and jade, no one to manage it. Not even close relatives or trusted kin remain. I wish to choose a worthy man to manage the household, to be my lifelong support. But men today, in my view, lack sincerity. If elder uncle would kindly consent, I would be forever grateful.”

Chongyang lowered his head in silence, thinking, “This woman has no shame, meeting me by chance and entrusting her lifelong hopes. Little does she know my heart is set on the dao; worldly passions and desires are long since seen through and erased.”

Seeing his silence, the woman poured wine and said, “Elder uncle, you must be hungry. Please drink and eat.”

Chongyang said, “I have vowed to fast and abstain until the Venerable Lord Lao’s birthday tomorrow, when I will offer incense at the temple. These days I have held to vegetarian fasting. Your kindness is great; a single meal will suffice.”

The woman said, “Have you not heard the sage say, ‘When offering sacrifices, act as if the deity is present; sincerity in heart and fasting in mouth suffice. Why cling to abstaining from wine and meat, fixated on appearances?’ If elder uncle insists, I cannot dissuade you.” She then ordered the kitchen to prepare a vegetarian meal.

After eating, the woman bade two maidservants to escort Chongyang to rest. Chongyang took leave and followed them to a chamber, where the bed was splendid and pure. Sitting in meditation, he soon fell asleep.

In a haze, two maidservants entered, accompanying the woman into the room. After they left, the woman closed the door, removed her outer clothes, revealing a body as white as snow. A fragrant breeze wafted forth as she approached, intending to share the bed.

Chongyang’s heart leapt in alarm. Thinking, “If this beauty ensnares me, my life is lost!” He quickly pushed away the covers, jumped down, opened the door, and fled outside. Moonlight shone as bright as day. The place was a garden; he leapt over the flower wall and saw a broad road. Taking advantage of the clear moonlight, he walked slowly.

---

Ahead, a sudden blaze revealed a landslide on the hillside, exposing two great stone coffers of gold and silver, dazzling in brilliance. Chongyang thought, “Gold and silver are useless to me now. If Heaven grants them to me, they may aid in emergencies or help the poor.” He prayed aloud, “If these treasures are meant for another, let them be. If for me, I humbly ask to keep them until my dao is fulfilled, to benefit the world with accumulated merit.”

Suddenly the gold and silver vanished.

Then a black tiger appeared on the mountain, sharp teeth and claws bared, ready to devour Chongyang. Chongyang said, “The tiger is lord of beasts and can speak human words. I, Wang Chongyang, seek only the dao; what fear have I? Past sins of ancestors now bear fruit; if you must eat me, then eat. If I must go, then go.” The tiger shook its head and wagged its tail, then climbed the mountain and left.

Chongyang proceeded about three li when a band of robbers appeared, brandishing spears and knives, surrounding him and demanding money. “This man is rude, trespassing our road. Have you silver to spare? Spare your dog life! If not, we’ll send you straight to Yanluo!”

Seeing their weapons drawn, Chongyang thought, “If I flee, others may be harmed later. Better to seize a blade and kill them cleanly, to prevent future harm.” Resolute, he rushed forward, kicking one bandit to the ground, seizing a knife. Just as he raised it to strike, a voice behind cried, “No, no!”

Chongyang turned quickly, stumbled and fell, realizing it was but a fleeting dream. He found himself in a wilderness, dawn breaking. Reflecting on the dream, his mind was clear, only his vital nature remained unrefined, needing gradual tempering.

He saw a passerby and asked about the Jia Mansion’s origins. The area, over twenty li, was deserted—he knew this was a divine manifestation testing his heart. Chongyang’s resolve for the dao grew ever firmer. His journey continued, untold here.

---

Meanwhile, the two immortals Zhong and Lü tested the Jia Mansion’s various temptations—wine, lust, and wealth were overcome, but one impulse remained. “This one’s past cause is not dark; he may be entrusted with the secret of the Golden Liquid Returning Elixir.” The two immortals transformed into two disciples teaching outside the Liquor Spring Temple’s mountain gate, play-fighting.

Chongyang arrived at the Liquor Spring Temple, bought incense and candles, and first offered incense with bows and prayers. Then he sought the two masters. Outside the mountain gate, two disciples were fighting.

Chongyang stepped forward to mediate, “Why do you two fight here?”

They said, “We are begging for food, fighting for a meal. What brings you here?”

Chongyang thought, “Their words have cause. They fight for food; I come seeking the dao. Do they understand my purpose?” He bowed and said, “I hear your words have cause; do you know my intent?”

The two immortals then transformed back to their forms from Gan River town and said, “Do you recognize us?”

Chongyang saw and bowed deeply. The two stopped and took his hand, leading him to a secluded spot where the three sat. They transmitted the true secret of the Golden Elixir, then pointed eastward, saying, “Why do you not look?”

Chongyang looked east and saw dazzling golden light, within which bloomed seven golden lotuses bearing fruit. The two immortals smiled, “That is not all; there will be ten thousand jade lotus chambers.” Then the two masters swept their sleeves and departed.

Chongyang stood bewildered, then returned to Xianyang, renaming his wife He Yuchan. He built a hermitage with Daoist friend Li Lingyang and cultivated together for three years. When Chongyang’s embryonic breath was perfected, he severed ties with worldly fire and smoke, dwelling in an earth cave to nurture his spirit for twelve years. People called his place the “Tomb of the Living Dead.” When he emerged, his wife He Yuchan had also borne the fruit of the dao. At that time, Shi Chuhou, Liu Tongche, and Yan Chuchang also successively attained the dao, wandering and accumulating merit.

Hearing the court abandoned the lands of Sichuan and Shaanxi, Chongyang left the eastern passes to guide the lost, hoping to fulfill the omen of the Golden Lotus. At Mount Song, he met two men, their appearance unlike mortals. The three bowed and sat to discuss. Chongyang asked their names. They said, “Our surname is Xue, styled Zixian. Formerly monks, we met our master, the True Man Shi Xinglin, and the Patriarch Zhang Ziyang, who expounded the Six-Character Scripture Verse. Thus we left Buddhism and returned to the true secret of the Returning Elixir. Now with disciple Zhang Huanwei, we seek a place to refine the elixir. May we know your master’s name and dharma title?”

Chongyang told them the full story of his attainment. Though his dao came from Zhong and Lü, Zixian’s elixir was completed first, and the three mutually respected each other.

Chongyang asked, “Where is your master now?”

Zixian said, “Our master passed away last year, leaving a verse:  
‘Thunder breaks the mud pellet cave,  
The True Man rides the fire dragon.  
Who struck first, no one knows,  
Shattering the great void?’”

Chongyang said, “This verse shows return to spirit and emptiness. Where do you two now go?”

Zixian said, “We intend to visit Master Hai Shan at Mount Hua. I have a disciple Chen Cuixu in Huizhou. May you visit him to impart mysteries and strengthen his faith?”

Chongyang agreed, and they parted.

---

Chen Cuixu, from Baishui Rock in Boluo County, Huizhou Prefecture, named Nan, styled Nanmu, made barrel hoops for a living. He first met the mountain spirit Li Lao, who taught him the Great Thunder Scroll of Jingxiao. Using talismanic water, he shaped earth into pills that cured disease, called Chen Mud Pills. Later he met the True Man Zixian, who taught the Returning Elixir formula; then Master Pilin, who taught the Way of the Taiyi Knife and Jade Tablet.

Having completed cultivation, his marvels were unfathomable. His hair uncombed, he could summon heavenly soldiers, command dragons to bring rain, wield an iron whip to aid the world, traveling hundreds of li daily. He once served Patriarch Zhang Ziyang, who warned him not to use magic lightly, fearing sacrilege. Chen Cuixu heeded this and refrained.

Truly:  
Though methods aid the dao’s foundation,  
Without root, methods surely fail.  
Dao and method together, with full merit,  
Surely one will soon ascend the elixir’s steps.
