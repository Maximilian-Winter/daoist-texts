# Chapter Five: Lord Li of the Old Heaven Meets the Assembly of Worthies at Kongtong; Wang Chongyang Guides the Disciples Across the Sea of Tranquility

**Verse:**

The immortal register esteems merit as the highest dao,  
Thus fitting to seek it amid the dust of the world.  
Three thousand eight hundred fruits perfected whole,  
In one instant, clear and complete, mounting cranes to meet the host of immortals.  
At will, responding and transforming with good causes and conditions.  
Once receiving the alchemical edict of old,  
Today plucking the Seven Golden Lotuses.  
Fruit fulfilled,功成, stepping swiftly to the Jade Heavens.  
*(Right tune: "Yu Meiren")*

It is told that the Perfected Wang Chongyang arrived at Huizhou to visit Chen Cuixu. There he saw a cooper chanting:

“From the conditioned comes the unconditioned—how can water leak through?  
Once perfectly round and tight, inside and out one true void.”

The cooper was none other than the concealed Mud Pellet Master, who, while shaping barrels, recited this verse. Seeing a Daoist whose eyes shone with numinous light, clearly no ordinary one, he hastened forward to bow and pay respects.

Chongyang asked, “What did you see that made you welcome me so?”

Cuixu replied, “The immortal’s eyes radiate divine light, a purple aura crowns your head—I recognized you by these signs.”

Chongyang inquired, “Have you studied under the Purple Worthy?”

“Indeed,” he answered.

Chongyang and Cuixu withdrew to a quiet place and discoursed on the essence of the Golden Elixir, their words in perfect accord. Together they ascended Mount Tiantai to meet the Purple Yang Perfected, lingering long in conversation.

When Chongyang took his leave, he invited them to tour the seaside.

In the year of the Guiwei, before the era name changed to Longxing, that winter the imperial edict summoned Guo Yong of Shanzhou, but he did not come. Yong’s father was loyal and filial, a disciple of Cheng Yi, author of the *Yi Commentary*, and Yong inherited his learning. He once debated with Chongyang on the way of nourishing life, styling himself the White Cloud Master. The emperor granted him the title of Recluse of Chonghui.

In the summer of the Jiashen year, Zhang Jun passed away. That winter, the Jin forces attacked Chuzhou; Wei Sheng resisted the enemy and died.

In the spring of the Yiyou year, the Song court changed the era name to Qiandao. Chen Kangbo died. Wang Gangzhong of the Privy Council, while seated at midday reviewing documents, saw Chen Kangbo arrive and said, “Yesterday I lingered near the Laurel Palace, admiring your steadfast loyalty and valor. The emperor commands you to return to the Bureau of Kings, to ascend the summit and meet together.” Gangzhong soon passed away.

Meanwhile, the Most High Patriarch of the Dao commanded the Perfected Yin Xi to summon the assembly of worthies, listing those immortals who had merited功. On the eighteenth day of the third month in the Dinghai year, they gathered at Kongtong to report功 and receive orders. Once the dao edict was issued, all the immortals assembled to pay homage to the Old Lord.

The Old Lord commanded each to expound on their profound truths, separately recounting their true功, their words differing yet converging on the ancestral dao. The Old Lord ordered a celestial feast, seating all in order.

The Heavenly Official of the Upper Yuan, Emperor Tang Yao, said, “Humans arise with greed and anger, brewing this kalpa of calamity. Though we strive to transform and protect the Great Harmony, we have no功 among the myriad masses. We are truly ashamed.”

The Old Lord looked upon Wen Shi and others, saying, “Well spoken, sons; your功 and virtue are great indeed! You have saved sentient beings from fire and flood, transformed vexations into cool clarity. Heaven’s heart is fulfilled; the golden seal records your merit. Yet in saving and aiding the world, what is your ultimate purpose? Speak again.”

---

Wen Shi Perfected said, “Among the customs of the four directions, harmony precedes affairs. One must cast away resentment and block desire, simplify things and forgive others, weighing light and heavy to guide accordingly.”

The Old Lord said, “Your words are excellent.”

Zhengyang said, “The minor methods of the side gates are easy to see功, and people delight in them, passing them from hand to hand, never awakening until death, corrupting the Great Dao. They are sunk in the bitter sea of self, yet try to pull others in, coaxing fools, self-glorifying their methods, dead souls in the netherworld. Truly sorrowful.”

The Old Lord said, “This is indeed the ignorance of ordinary men, caused by the spread of false teachings, making disciples hard to awaken. You must urgently rescue the orthodox, so they may realize.”

Zhengyang presented the *Song of Breaking Confusion and Correcting the Dao*. The Old Lord read it and said, “This suffices to shatter the side gates and awaken the lost. Though they cannot attain truth in this life, in future rebirths they may tread the path of the Great Dao.”

---

Chunyang presented the *Song of Tapping the Lines*, the *Song Directly Pointing to the Great Elixir*, and the *Fisherman’s Verse*. Haishan offered the *Rhapsody on Returning the Elixir* and the *Song of Utmost Truth*. Yin Changsheng presented the *Song of Dragon and Tiger*. Yan Junping offered the *Song of Lead and Mercury*. Xu Shiyang advanced the *Song of Drunken Thoughts on Immortality*. The immortals all eagerly submitted their works.

The Old Lord viewed them and praised, “This shows your earnest hearts to save the world; you are truly the Great Wall of my dao.” He ordered the attendants to bring sweet cream, and the worthies drank deeply.

---

The Earthly Official of the Middle and Upper Realms, Emperor Yushun, said, “Just now I received the jade edict: the loyal and good Yue clan have ascended to the heavenly realms; the treacherous Qin Hui has fallen into the Three Paths. But the strength between Song and Jin—how shall it be resolved?”

The Old Lord said, “The Jin are fond of slaughter, their cruelty too great. In time they will receive retribution from the Mongols, surely doubled.”

He then ordered the Grand Custodian to open the *Dao Canon* and select scriptures to entrust to the immortals, saying, “This *Scripture of Deliverance*, *Jade Pivot Scripture*, and *Three Officials Scripture*—those who can uphold and recite them may dispel calamities and resolve disasters. The *Great Brahma Dipper* and *Morning Truth Ritual*—by honoring these one may request blessings and prolong life. The *Chapter on Life Spirits*, *Ritual of Refining Aid*, *Scripture of Deliverance from Suffering*, and *Great Scripture of Life*—reciting these can ferry the departed to ascent. The *Jade Emperor Scripture*, *Three Caverns Scripture*, *Great Cavern Scripture*, *Dao De Jing*, *Yellow Court Scripture*, *Dragon and Tiger Scripture*, *Yin Conscript Scripture*, and *Scripture of Pure Stillness*—by understanding these one may attain the dao and become perfected truth. You shall transmit these scriptures to those who believe in the dao, urging them to read, recite, and contemplate. Those with aspiration will surely transcend the mundane and become sages.”

The assembly bowed and took leave. The Old Lord commanded Ling Lun and others to escort them out of the mountain, each ascending the cloud path.

---

The Old Lord knew of the great plague in the Two Rivers region. Though Feng Chang and others were there, their aid was insufficient. He wished to go assist. Li Ningyang also desired to accompany him.

---

Meanwhile, in Hedong, Feng Jian—formerly Feng Chang in another life—had initially entered office through mastery of the classics but found his nature at odds with the world. He abandoned office to dwell by the Yi River, treating plagues with medicine. At that time, a Daoist named Li Jun practiced his arts in the Jin domain, especially skilled at seeing ghosts. Li Jun greatly respected Feng Jian, and when Feng Jian’s name was invoked, ghosts fled. Li Jun taught afflicted families to write the character “Jian” on their doors; ghosts seeing it would avoid them.

---

Li Ningyang departed for Chang’an, calling himself Li Ke, often clad in a straw raincoat and bamboo hat, girded with a gourd, selling rat poison in the city, marking his shop with a wooden rat. When customers bought the poison, he said, “This poison not only kills rats but cures diseases.” Zhang Zan, a bookseller, bought some poison. By lamplight he saw several large rats fighting over the poison, then suddenly the rats sprouted wings and flew away. Amazed, Zan asked Li Ke for more poison. Li Ke said, “The poison is all gone.” Zan returned home and told his father, who was over seventy and long afflicted with wind ailments. The father licked the leftover poison the rats had eaten and was immediately cured.

Ningyang went to Zhongnan to meet Zhengyang and Chunyang. Just then Wang Chongyang arrived, bowing to thank his master and recounting in detail how his wife and Yu Shan had attained the dao. Zhengyang said, “Your wife was originally the spirit of the Blue Bird guarding the flowers of the Jade Pool, descended to the mortal realm. Because of her long-standing clarity, you transmitted to her the way to attain the dao’s fruit. She also accumulated功 and practiced deeds. One day she will attain the rank of Golden Immortal, no longer burdened by feathers.”

The three immortals were laughing and chatting when Ningyang arrived. Zhengyang and Chunyang came out to greet him and ordered Chongyang to pay respects to the Dao Ancestor: “This is the transcendent immortal of strange form, Lord Li Ningyang.”

Chongyang bowed deeply. Ningyang hurried to detain him, saying, “You are the incarnation of the Perfected Tongcheng Wang Sheng, not forgetting your past causes. Fortunate to be transformed by the two immortals Zhong and Lü, you have attained the dao and perfected truth. Your long-cherished wish is vast, your heart eager to save others. One day when功 is full, your immortal rank will be high indeed.”

Hearing Ningyang’s words, Chongyang recognized his true origin. He again bowed to Ningyang, saying, “Were it not for the two masters’ transformation, how could I have beheld the Dao Ancestor’s immortal visage? Now, by grace and guidance, I vow to wholeheartedly aid and save others.”

He then bade farewell to the three immortals and returned eastward to the Eastern Sea. The three immortals also saw him out the cave gate and parted. Ningyang roamed Zhongnan with the two immortals Zhong and Lü. Their story is not told here.

Meanwhile, Ma Yifu married Lady Sun, a woman of talent and beauty. The couple were like fish and water, reciting poetry and answering each other morning and evening—their joy was evident. Later, Yifu served as a Gentleman of the Yellow Gate, not seeking promotion or fame. They had three sons: eldest named Tingzhen, second Tingrui, third Tinggui. The sons grew and married. Time passed swiftly; Yifu was now forty-five, and Lady Sun had passed four springs, aged forty-nine.

One day, while napping, Yifu dreamed a Daoist carried him to the heavens, touring sacred realms of extraordinary scenery. Upon waking, moved, he composed a poem:

*Dreaming of Huaxu reaching the Nine Heavens,  
Amidst the heavens dwell countless immortals.  
Fragrance drifts from the Purple Palace where dragons and phoenixes dance,  
Auspicious light shines on the Red Terrace where lions rest.  
The mortal realm is not true joy; the human body cannot match the steadfast dharma body.  
Wealth and honor in the red dust last not long;  
Leap beyond the cage and live ten thousand years.*

Lady Sun saw the poem and marveled silently, then asked her husband the meaning. Yifu said, “Dreaming of the heavenly palace moved me to write this poem. I think life in the world cannot last long. The longest live a hundred years, the middle eighty, the short sixty. The sages say: at fifty one knows Heaven’s decree. You and I have reached that age; the sun is setting near the western hills. If we do not hasten to turn back and deeply reflect, old age and impermanence will be hard to avoid. While our bodies are still strong, we should seek a wise master, early pursue the method to save the world, cultivate the immortal of longevity and deathlessness; roam carefree beyond things, become immortals equal to Heaven’s lifespan. The Ten Continents and Three Islands appear at thought; the Great Thousand Worlds invite us freely to travel. When that time comes, how joyous it will be!”

Lady Sun said, “Your talk of cultivating immortality is wonderful. But you and I are mere mortals—how can we rashly hope for such? I fear trying to paint a tiger and ending up like a dog, inviting ridicule.”

Yifu said, “Since ancient times, tens of thousands have attained the dao; hundreds have uprooted their homes to become true immortals. Have you not heard the ancient poem:

‘Through myriad kalpas and countless lives to this birth,  
This life is always a preordained fate.  
If this life does not save this body,  
In vain will one compete for fame in the world.’

Look closely at the immortal transmissions: many with shallow roots face a thousand demons and myriad hardships, cultivating the body with bitter resolve. If not attained in this life, they seek the next. Those with deep roots meet true masters early, receive the supreme dao, and in three or five years transcend the Three Realms. As for roots, you and I are not the best, but better than some. In this life we have wealth and honor, a heart to aid the world, children and grandchildren abound, and no illness afflicts us—this is a great root. I intend to travel abroad seeking masters of dao and virtue, to receive the method of longevity, and cultivate a heavenly immortal. This will fulfill my lifelong wish.”

Lady Sun laughed, “The ancients said: husband’s honor is wife’s glory. If you become an immortal, how can I as wife not be immortal?”

Yifu said, “The word ‘immortal’ is heavenly honor, not comparable to the mundane. Husband’s honor and wife’s glory are mortal talk. In cultivating immortality, the saying goes: ‘Husband cultivates, husband gains; wife cultivates, wife gains; each cultivates their own body and each attains their own result.’ It means: ‘Each eats their own fill.’ The food is in my belly—how can you be full? Moreover, in the world, father and son, husband and wife, brothers and friends—when great calamity strikes, the son cannot follow the father, nor the wife the husband. Each flees their own path; birth and death separate all in time.”

This talk awakened Lady Sun as if from a dream. She asked, “If you find a wise master, is it possible for wife and husband to cultivate together?”

Yifu said, “If hearts are united, outsiders become close friends; if hearts differ, even closest kin are strangers.”

A few days later, Ma Yifu had business in the city and went to the city gate. Because of the summer heat, he sat briefly and bought a melon to quench thirst. An old Daoist approached and also sat down. What did he look like? Behold:

He wore a clear breeze kerchief on his head, straw sandals with many ears on his feet; holding a dust-cleaning whisk, draped in a thousand-needle sleeved robe. His eyes sparkled brightly, two golden beams flashed like lightning; silently containing spirit, a harmonious aura like a turtle’s shell. Large ears and prominent nose, face glowing golden; high forehead and broad brows, tongue patterned like brocade. Sitting like a rock, stepping like a light wind. Truly:

“No one, no self—the true thusness body;  
Unborn, undying—the free and easy heart.”

Ma Yu saw this ancient and extraordinary figure and bought a melon, saying, “Master, I see you wear a sleeved robe in this heat—are you not afraid of the steaming warmth? I buy this melon to form a bond with you.”

Chongyang said nothing, took the melon and ate it from the stem end.

Ma Yu said, “The stem end is bitter; why not discard it?”

Chongyang said, “Fragrance comes from the foul; sweetness arises from bitterness.”

Ma Yu asked, “Master, where are you from? What brings you here?”

Chongyang said, “I have come a thousand miles, specially to aid a drunken man.”

Ma Yu was amazed, knowing this was a man of dao. He bowed deeply and said, “Disciple sees your extraordinary form and unusual words, with intent to save others. Please come to my home to rest a few days. What is your honored wish?”

Chongyang saw his sincere reverence and recognized him as a vessel of dao. They went together to Ma’s home. Seated in the hall, Ma hurried his servants to brew tea and prepare vegetarian offerings.

Chongyang said, “This poor daoist has left the mountains, long avoiding smoke and fire.”

Ma Yu heard this and grew even more respectful, hastening to call forth Lady Sun. “Today in the city I met this true immortal. He has not eaten smoke or fire for many years. This man surely has the dao.”

The couple came forward to pay respects. Chongyang saw the woman, though near the age of knowing Heaven’s decree, her form was extraordinary. She would surely become a great vessel, but her dao heart was not yet firm. He resolved to carefully cultivate her.

Ma Yu invited the master to the flower hall to rest in quiet. Each day he bought melons and fruits to offer. Chongyang renamed Ma Yu as Chu Yu, styled Tongbao, and called him Danyang.

Danyang bowed and thanked him, asking, “What is the dao?”

Chongyang answered, “The dao is the empty and void body, forcibly named Pre-Heaven. It is where the Five Phases do not reach, before father and mother were born.”

Danyang instantly grasped the general meaning and served the master tirelessly, daily discussing the mysterious and profound dao. Chongyang shared pears with Danyang, composing poems to reflect on them. One poem said:

*This fruit is round outside yet firm within,  
Containing a single point of Pre-Heaven.  
Gathered and tasted with condensed flower dew,  
Released it looks like a lotus emerging from water.  
Splitting open the primordial chaos to cultivate the wondrous dao,  
Cleaving the Great Ultimate to select the true lead.  
People today do not know the profound origin,  
Who would guess eating pears holds secret transmission?*

Each pear was divided ten times, each time accompanied by a poem to transform it, pointing out many directions. Yet Danyang had not fully awakened. The story is not told here.

In Dengzhou Prefecture’s Ninghai District lived a man surnamed Tan, named Yu, styled Boyu. His ancestors hailed from Luoyang County in Henan. When the Jin armies crossed south and attacked Bianjing, he fled with his father to Shandong’s Dengzhou Ninghai to lodge. Because the Deng, Lai, and Qing prefectures lie near the sea, off the main roads, though the Jin reached this place and took the city, the people submitted and there was no great warfare. Refugees entered the land.

Tan Yu was born in the first year of the Jin Taizong’s Tianhui era, on the first day of the third month of the Guimao year. At birth, auspicious colored clouds illuminated the room. He was quick-witted but encountered the Jin chaos, fleeing with his father to Ninghai and opening a shop to make a living. After his father’s death, he lived simply and favored purity and emptiness, never thinking to marry or continue the line, only guarding his primal essence.

At forty-two, he suddenly suffered from wind-bi disease. Seeking doctors was futile; medicines had no effect. For three years he struggled to walk. He heard that Ma Yifu’s household had a true immortal who wore single garments year-round, not eating smoke or fire food. “If he is effective and can cure my illness, I will beseech to become a monk.” Resolute, he took a sedan chair to Ma’s door and disembarked, entering to inquire. Ma’s family led him to the flower hall to meet.

Danyang asked his reason for coming and introduced him to the master. Tan Yu saw Chongyang, brilliant and extraordinary, and knew a celestial had descended. He bowed deeply, begging for healing of his chronic illness.

Chongyang examined his spirit and form, seeing his prior affinities and uncommon root and vessel. He took from his gourd three elixir pills and said to Tan Yu, “You must decoct these with rootless water and drink. After a deep sleep, your body will be immediately healed.”

As the verse says:

*Prior affinity and seed meet this life,  
Attaining the dao and cultivation depend on the person.  
If Tan had not labored with earnest will,  
How could he see the true Heaven in days to come?*

To learn what befell Tan Yu next, listen to the next chapter unfold.
