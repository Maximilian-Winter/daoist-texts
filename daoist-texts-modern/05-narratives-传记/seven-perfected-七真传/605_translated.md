# Chapter Six: Wang Chongyang Projects Spirit to Test True Heart — Sun Bu’er Sacrifices Beauty to Seek the Ultimate Dao

**Verse:**

To truly aspire to learn the immortal dao,  
One must earnestly seek within this path.  
With diligent cultivation and bitter resolve,  
Refine and temper, harmonize lead and mercury, forge the Golden Elixir’s head.  
Transform and soar with ease and grace,  
Three trials test the true heart of the maiden’s race.  
Sacrificing beauty to pursue the dao, dustly passions erased—  
Dustly passions erased, revealing profound power to refine soul and spirit’s base.

Now, Danyang hurriedly bade his servant fetch water from the Rootless Spring to brew tea, which he gave to Tan Yu to swallow; then he led him to the bedchamber, commanding deep sleep to come upon him. Having taken this elixir, Tan Yu slept and upon waking found his illness healed, his spirit refreshed and clear. He then approached Chongyang, bowing and pleading for salvation of the world. Chongyang said, “For all who cultivate the dao, entering the path is easy, but hearing the dao is difficult; hearing the dao is easy, but guarding the dao is difficult; guarding the dao is easy, but accomplishing the dao is difficult; accomplishing the dao is easy, but perfecting the dao is difficult. You are already over forty years old; your spirit is spent and cannot be restored easily. Though you must set a brave heart and firm resolve, first sweep away every thought, then guard your mind against worldly dust, until not a single thought arises, not a speck of dust remains. Only then can the true dao be heard and the true method cultivated. I now accept you, but you must change your guise and appearance, take the name Chuduan, the courtesy name Tongzheng, and the sobriquet Changzhen.” Changzhen bowed in thanks to his master, then again to senior brother Danyang. Returning to the inn, he sold off his belongings and came to serve Danyang. We shall not dwell further.

Meanwhile, Chongyang had stayed at the Ma household for over four months. Madam Sun remained unconvinced, though Danyang came and went with messages, she did not quite understand. It was now the tenth month, the weather turning crisp with a slight wind, frost and dew beginning to fall. Golden chrysanthemums bloomed by the fence, lotuses blazed in the garden’s splendor. Chongyang’s heart blossomed like a flower as he composed a poem:

> Entering the realm, I once beheld jade lotus fair,  
> Graceful and fragrant, emerald hues dense and rare.  
> Beauty fully owed to the midnight moon’s glow,  
> Attentive, as if sudden winds softly blow.  
> Flowers fade, leaves fall, time’s splendor flees,  
> Trees age, branches wither, frost and snow seize.  
> To keep the root eternal, never to die,  
> I urge you swiftly seek the Golden Elder on high.

Having finished his verse, Chongyang sat down with brows lowered. Danyang entered and, perceiving the poem’s meaning, sensed it might touch Madam Sun’s heart. Yet she remained lost in confusion; only gentle and gradual guidance could help. So he copied the poem and took it back to his own chamber to nurture quietude. We shall not dwell on this.

Seeing Madam Sun’s stubborn ignorance, Chongyang projected his yang spirit and entered her room, embracing her. Madam Sun struggled and pushed him away with all her might, breaking free and rushing out to tell Danyang. She thought, “My lord treats this man as a living immortal, yet this man’s lustful heart is not severed—where then is the dao? Surely my lord is deceived. He has been here over four months without eating cooked food; how can his lust be unbroken? Suspicious indeed. If I tell my lord, he may not believe me and it would be shameful. I must endure.”

Several days passed, and Chongyang again entered her room. She hastily avoided him, turning her face with scorn: “You madman, shameless beyond measure! Since you came to my house, my husband has regarded you as a living immortal. After months, you come to my chamber to harass me. If I tell my lord, where will your face be? Leave at once!” Chongyang replied, “When I cultivated the dao in Zhongnan, I tasted blandness and detachment, and my desires vanished. Now, after months here, my spirit is full and strong. There is a saying: ‘When full and warm, desires arise; when hungry and cold, one guards nature.’ I only ask for a chance to form a bond.” Hearing this, Madam Sun was deeply vexed and hurried to Danyang’s room, recounting the master’s repeated advances. “You treat this man as a living immortal, yet he shamelessly acts thus. Luckily I have not been ensnared. If I had been, and cried out, the household would have seen and we would be disgraced. If not, I would be forever sullied. In my view, send him away quickly to avoid further trouble.”

Danyang heard this and felt some resentment. “You ignorant woman, so uncomprehending! My master has sat in meditation in the flower hall day after day, never stepping outside. You yourself are confused and refuse to turn to the dao or believe in virtue. That is why your root is shallow and you disbelieve. Fine, but to accuse my master of harassment is slanderous and sinful!” Madam Sun said, “So you say I lie?” Danyang said, “If it is true, next time you catch him in your room, call me to see for myself, then I will believe you.” Madam Sun lowered her head in silence, puzzled. Returning to her chamber, she thought, “If he never comes again, my lord will think I lied. If he does come, I will lock the door and call him to witness, so my grievance is clear and my lord will believe me.”

Days later, Chongyang entered her room again. Madam Sun quickly locked the door with a bolt and called out, “My lord, come quickly! Today I have locked the daoist in my chamber.” Danyang hurried with her to the door. Madam Sun unlocked it, and Danyang entered, looking around but finding no sign of anyone. He asked, “Where is the master?” Madam Sun searched everywhere—on the bed, under it, every corner—but no trace appeared. She was dazed and bewildered, as if in a trance. Danyang said, “You said you locked the master in the room; where is he now? Such lies and nonsense! If you find him, fine; if not, I will punish you so you dare not lie again!” Madam Sun, ashamed, lowered her eyes and wept: “Have I seen a ghost in broad daylight? If not a ghost, then no one was in the room. I locked the door for you to see; how could I invite disaster upon myself?”

Danyang pondered and hurried to the flower hall, where he found the master sitting with eyes closed behind the curtain. Returning to Madam Sun’s chamber, he said, “You have been mistaken. I spoke with the master, who said: ‘When the Great Dao is perfected, the yang spirit appears. A body beyond the body, adapting to circumstances, with wondrous powers beyond measure. Passing through metal and stone without hindrance, stepping on sun and moon without shadow. Able to ride cranes and cross phoenixes, to drive the light and soar through the void.’ Just now, entering your chamber was the master’s spirit projecting and transforming, testing your true heart. Some days ago, the master composed a poem on the lotus, whose meaning contained a heart to guide you.”

Hearing Danyang’s words, Madam Sun awoke as if from a dream: “Since the master’s poem contains meaning, why did my lord not say so earlier?” Together with Danyang, she went to her chamber and took out the poem. Seeing it, her heart was enlightened. She said to Danyang, “This poem uses the lotus as a symbol, its meaning clear and revealing. Though the lotus is charming and beautiful, it cannot escape the sorrow of aging and falling petals. I am nearly fifty, my qi and blood withered. If I do not cultivate swiftly, I will surely sink into suffering. Who knew the master’s wondrous transformations came to my chamber several times to test my heart? Luckily, my mind remained unmoved. Though I spoke harshly at times, I meant no harm. I trust the master will not blame me. I beg my lord to express my heart to the master, to ask him to instruct me in the way of cultivation, so that the human path may open and the true path be found.” Danyang said, “Fortunately, when the master tested you, you bore no offense in your heart. If you had spoken rudely, he would not have accepted you. Though his spirit tested your heart, any harsh words were not blameworthy. I will inform the master and await his decision.”

He went to the flower hall, where the master and Changzhen were discussing the dao. Danyang approached and bowed: “I humbly thank the master for his great grace in enlightening Madam Sun. If she spoke ignorantly or offended, I beg your pardon.” Changzhen said, “Where did senior brother Ma say this? I have seen the master sitting here, never going outside, how could he have gone to enlighten Madam Sun?” Danyang said, “Your affairs are beyond your knowledge.” Chongyang overheard but feigned ignorance. Danyang continued, “My wife Madam Sun, now seeing the master’s wondrous transformations, feels deeply ashamed and wishes to come before you to seek salvation. I do not know how you will respond; please instruct.” Chongyang said, “Since Madam Sun has awakened, you may bring her here; I will have words to instruct her.”

Danyang obeyed and summoned Madam Sun. Before the master, she prostrated herself: “I, a disciple with worldly eyes, do not recognize the descent of a celestial immortal. Forgive my blindness and grant great mercy. I dare to plead for acceptance. Please grant me a thread of true opportunity to open the path of awakening in this lifetime. If I gain your great compassion and Heaven’s pity, to cultivate long life and immortality, I will never forget my master’s grace.” Chongyang said, “The Great Dao perfected is not only about long life and immortality; it can transcend even the heavens beyond Heaven. Though you are nearly fifty, your appearance is still fair. I fear your dao heart is not firm, and that you may harm fellow practitioners. Moreover, your qi and blood are depleted; refining the elixir will be difficult. You must accumulate abundant hidden merit and seek the cause and effect of future lives, to be reborn in a male body, not forgetting past karma. When Danyang attains the dao, I will command him to come and save you. Cultivate the dao fruit, and you may enter the ranks of immortals.”

Hearing the master’s words that she could not attain the dao in this life but must await rebirth as a man, and that Danyang’s attainment would bring her salvation, Madam Sun pondered. She thought, “Though birth and death’s cycle is fixed, and hidden merit’s retribution is certain, I have now realized past errors and met a true master, yet still cannot save the world. Will I awaken in the next life? If not, will I fall forever into suffering? I have heard all creatures, even insects and birds, can cultivate to become spirits and fruits; how much more so one who has gained human form? Yet the master fears my heart is not firm, lest I harm the dao friends. Thus I must set a resolute and brave heart.” She bade farewell to the master and returned to her chamber. Taking an iron lamp bowl, she sealed it tightly with a fire bell, filled it with oil, and placed it on the stove to boil. Closing eyes and mouth, she poured the boiling oil over her face. The scalding burned her skin raw. She wiped away the oil and looked in the mirror—her face was like a painted mask from the opera. She then went to the flower hall.

Danyang saw this and was greatly shocked, unable to hold back tears. Changzhen saw and sighed: “Where in the world is there such a woman? With such resolve, what fear is there that the Great Dao will not be attained? Rare through all ages, truly hard to find!” Madam Sun knelt before the master: “With this visage, may I still cultivate?” Chongyang looked up, astonished: “Since you have such determination, what fear is there that the Great Dao will not be attained? Truly rare in the world! Such steadfast will may be called a man among women. I will name you Bu’er, to strengthen your resolve.” Then he composed a poem in praise:

> Envy the worthy whose fates long entwined,  
> Today we ride the lotus boat aligned.  
> Sacrificing beauty and body to seek the true way,  
> Firm will and strong heart refine lead and mercury’s play.  
> Like Magu descending to earthly lands,  
> Like wondrous forms from jade heavens’ strands.  
> When merit is full, the imperial edict arrives,  
> Truly the foremost immortal among women thrives.

Chongyang said to Bu’er, “Though you have true resolve to cultivate, do not cling too tightly, lest you fall into demonic realms. You are nearly fifty and have borne sons and daughters; your primordial potency is diminished. Cultivation has no fixed limits; you must set a steadfast and unremitting will, always watchful and cautious. Fortunately, your past affinity remains; your prenatal essence is not yet exhausted, thanks to your family’s wealth and your peaceful heart. Men, when cultivating, first subdue the White Tiger; women must first sever the Red Dragon. Once the Red Dragon is cut, the elixir foundation is built. Men find it hard to subdue the White Tiger; women find severing the Red Dragon even harder. To cut the Red Dragon, one must eliminate desire. When desire is removed, the primordial spirit settles. With spirit settled and heart clear, the original qi rises again. Gathering and refining it fills the five organs and blends the five energies, forming the embryonic fetus. When the spirit fetus is full, it journeys through dark and mysterious realms, nurtured and refined again, ascending to pay homage to the Three Pure Ones. I now transmit to you the Heavenly Talisman Spirit Record and the Secret Method of Lunar Refinement. Diligently cultivate and refine, and together with Danyang exhaust the subtle meanings. You may all change appearance and guise, calling each other senior brother and junior brother. Naturally, the day of attaining the dao will come. But be careful to guard and hold fast; do not waste sun and moon, nor fritter away time. Life is brief, a fleeting moment. Be cautious, be vigilant!” Bu’er bowed thrice and rose, then respectfully bowed to Danyang and Changzhen, who returned the salutes. Bu’er then returned to her chamber.

Several days later, Bu’er and Danyang discussed: “Since we have received the master’s secret instructions, we must begin earnest practice. But household affairs are not yet settled. I think with the master here, guests coming and going, there is no quiet. Moreover, with senior and junior brothers coming and going, it is inconvenient. Perhaps you should discuss with the master about building a separate temple, where the master and fellow daoists can dwell in peace. What do you think?” Danyang said, “What you say is exactly my thought. This must be done for peace and order.” Danyang then went to the flower hall to discuss with the master, explaining Bu’er’s proposal in detail. Chongyang said, “What you say pleases me. But you must choose a quiet place and spend several thousand taels of silver to build a fine temple. Later, when many dao friends gather, it will be useful.”

Danyang took the order and selected a most wondrous site about two li from the house. They chose an auspicious day to begin construction. In less than two months, the work was completed, with more than eighty rooms large and small, costing over ten thousand taels of silver. They asked the master to name the temple. Chongyang said, “Since this temple is built for the Quanzhen dao friends to dwell, it may be named Quanzhen Hermitage.” The master and disciples rejoiced and chose a day to move in.

Chongyang and Changzhen entered Quanzhen Hermitage to reside. Danyang entrusted household affairs to his son Tingzhen, and husband and wife devoted themselves to learning the dao. Chongyang transmitted to Danyang five chapters of the *Golden Elixir Secret* along with the formulas. Danyang mastered the formulas, changed his appearance and guise, tying his hair in three buns to show eternal remembrance of the master’s grace. Day by day, he and Bu’er cultivated and pondered the profound meaning, diligently refining. By day he managed affairs at Quanzhen Hermitage; by night he returned home to nurture quietude. Truly:

> The Great Dao knows no male or female divide,  
> All depends on the heart where roots abide.  
> Past affinities planted in this life’s soil,  
> Turn back swiftly, lest you miss the toil.
