# Chapter Seven: Qiu Qi Seeks the Dao and Finds the True Master; Hao Tianran Pursues Profound Rumors to Attain the Ultimate Dao

Verse:

With true resolve he seeks the dao,  
Steadfast heart endures all pain—no retreat, this is strength.  
Coldly detached from worldly ties,  
Letting go of fame and gain—beyond the field of right and wrong.  
When thousands of demons and myriad trials are overcome,  
Naturally the whole body exudes fragrant grace.  
Merit perfected, dao complete,  
At ease and joyous, fully drinking this celestial nectar.  
(From the tune “Youthful Wanderer”)

It is told that in the region of Bindu, Qixia County, Dengzhou Prefecture, there lived a virtuous gentleman named Qiu Deshu. His father was Wenjie, his mother Lady Yang, and their ancestral home was in Yanjing. Due to the upheavals across the realm, they relocated to Shandong. His parents passed away early. He married Lady Ou, and the household was prosperous; the couple practiced kindness and delighted in the dao. They bore three sons and two daughters: the eldest son Qiu Qichong, the second Qiu Qishu, the third Qiu Qifa; the eldest daughter named Yulan, the younger daughter Lanying. Only the third son, Qiu Qifa, was born on the nineteenth day of the first month in the year Wuchen, the eighth year of the Jin Xizong Huangtong era—corresponding to the eighteenth year of the Song Gaozong Shaoxing reign. At his birth, a rainbow and halo pierced the chamber, and colorful mist filled the skies. Deshu said, “This child will surely be no ordinary vessel.”

Qiu Qifa was fond of the dao from youth, quick-witted with a strong memory, endowed with exceptional nature. He did not envy worldly splendor, but cherished tranquility. At sixteen, he abandoned home to seek the dao, journeying to the Three Officials Hall on Mount Yu, where he took a master and became a monk, changing his name to Fatong. Three years passed; at nineteen, still innocent and diligent in study, he saw that outside the master was true, inside false—truly lacking dao and virtue. Suddenly he heard that at the Quanzhen Hermitage in Ninghai there was a Chongyang master, of lofty virtue, who could foresee the future. He resolved to visit him.

Arriving at the guest hall of Quanzhen Hermitage, he sat down and saw a daoist friend, his hair tied in three buns, three slight wisps of beard, wearing a black robe, holding a feather whisk, who came into the hall. Fatong hurried to bow; Danyang returned the greeting and invited him to sit, then called a servant to bring tea.

After drinking, Danyang saw this daoist friend was not yet twenty, with a clear spirit and elegant bones—certainly no fool—and asked, “Dao friend, from which immortal land do you hail? Which immortal temple claims you?” Fatong replied, “I am a native of Qixia County, now a monk at the Three Officials Hall on Mount Yu.” Danyang said, “Pray tell me your master’s name.” Fatong answered, “My master’s surname is Zhang, transmitting the dao from above to below.” Danyang asked again, “And your own surname and dao name?” Fatong replied, “My surname is Qiu, styled Fatong. May I respectfully ask your surname and dao name?” Danyang answered, “My common surname is Ma, styled Danyang. Pray, what brings you here?” Fatong said, “Yesterday I heard that at the Bao Hermitage there is a Chongyang master, of great virtue and learning, who can foresee the future—a living immortal in this world. I, ignorant, wish to be saved and seek to join his school, waiting daily for instruction. I do not know if he will accept me. I beg Master Ma to be my introducer; what is your honorable opinion?” Danyang said, “If so, cultivate yourself here and study the dao. If fate allows, I will accompany you to meet the master.” Fatong said, “Many thanks, Master Ma.”

The two walked to the Chongyang alchemical chamber. Fatong knelt and said, “I come specially to join the school and learn the dao. I hope Master will show great mercy and save me. I will never forget the master’s grace in this life.” Chongyang opened his wise eyes to look, seeing the deep roots from past lives, and thought, “This child will surely become a great vessel; we are all outmatched. I must fully temper him.” Then he closed his eyes and chanted:

Delicate golden scales play in jade streams,  
Able to find fragrant bait and swallow the hook.  
By my gentle hand the fishing line is drawn,  
Pulled into Penglai, where freedom is won.

Having finished chanting, he closed his mouth like a curtain. Danyang, knowing the meaning of the master’s poem, could understand the salvation implied, but wondered why the master closed his eyes and ignored Fatong. Fatong knelt for a long time, until his feet went numb and knees ached, tears streaming from his eyes. Danyang felt pity and pleaded, “Master, this Dao friend Qiu has knelt too long. Please open your heart and accept him.” Chongyang said, “You take me, but I do not want him.” Then he closed his eyes again and said nothing. Fatong begged and pleaded in vain, but no word came.

Danyang said, “Could it be that my master has no fate with you? You might as well return and seek another master with the dao. Since he will not accept you, kneeling here to death is futile.” Fatong rose, weeping bitterly, and said to Danyang, “It is not that I have no fate with the master, but that my roots are shallow and blessings thin. Now meeting the true master yet not being saved, what use is my meager fortune in this world? Perhaps I should seek a path to death.”

At this, Danyang and Changzhen and others listened with heavy hearts, unable to bear the sorrow. They said to Fatong, “Stay here; we will try to persuade the master. Perhaps he will accept you.” Fatong kowtowed to Changzhen and Danyang, saying, “Now I am deeply grateful for your great mercy, a kindness hard to repay.” Danyang said to Changzhen, “At first hearing the meaning of the master’s poem, I thought he would accept him, but why then did he reject him?”

Several days passed. Danyang again spoke to the master: “I see Dao friend Qiu is sincere in seeking the dao. I beg you to accept him.” Chongyang said, “My thoughts are not known to you. If you pity him, you may accept him yourself.” Danyang, helpless, consulted with Changzhen and others. Changzhen said, “The master firmly refuses him; there must be a reason beyond our understanding. Why not you accept him on the master’s behalf? Would that not be the same? He can take you as his introducer master—would that not be fine?” Danyang said, “You speak wisely. Please explain this to Fatong.” Changzhen then said to Fatong, “The master absolutely refuses you. I ask Master Ma Danyang to accept you on his behalf; it is the same. You may take Master Ma Danyang as your introducer master.” Hearing this, Fatong bowed to Ma Danyang four times, then saluted the senior brothers.

Danyang said to Fatong, “The master will not accept you. Now, hearing Senior Brother Changzhen’s words, I will temporarily accept you on the master’s behalf. From now on, I will change your name to Chujī, styled Tongmi, dao name Fuyang. Henceforth, you must strictly observe purity and clarity, diligently cultivate the dao; before the master, be even more attentive and never disobey. If in time the master and disciple’s feelings align, the great dao may be heard.” Chujī bowed to Danyang, saying, “I will follow Master Ma’s commands and dare not disobey.” Danyang said, “You err; we are brothers, not master and disciple.” Chujī said, “All is mercy; I dare not forget your grace.” Danyang said, “For now, we are brothers; no need for formality. May you establish a brave heart, a firm and steadfast resolve, and cultivate to become a Great Luo Heavenly Immortal—that is my joy.”

Several days later, Chongyang and the dao friends discoursed on profound mysteries. When Chujī approached, the master fell silent, not speaking—not once, but often so. All said the master had no fate with Chujī. Chujī served the master daily with diligence and care, yet was unnoticed.

Meanwhile, in the autumn of the year Dinghai, the seventh month, a great drought struck Jianghuai and Shandong; the people were terrified. Officials in every prefecture and county set up altars to pray for rain, commanding monks and daoists to perform rituals and offer vegetarian feasts, but all was in vain. The villagers of Ninghai knew that Ma Yuanwai had brought a living immortal who could foresee the future. The people discussed: why not go to Quanzhen Hermitage to pray for rain? If there was a response, the people would rejoice; it was worth trying. So seven or eight local gentry elders came to Quanzhen Hermitage. Danyang came out and asked their purpose, learning it was to pray for rain. The people saw Ma Yuanwai now dressed as a daoist, hair tied in three buns, and admired him greatly. They said, “It has not rained for a long time; the people are anxious. Our prefectural lord asked monks and daoists to perform rituals, but nothing worked. We heard that at Bao Hermitage there is a living immortal who can foresee the future. We have come to pray and beg your guidance, that we may petition him. If there is a response, all the people will be grateful.” Danyang said, “Praying for rain is a great matter. I do not know if my master can respond. I will take you inside to ask.”

Danyang went first, the people followed, arriving at the Chongyang alchemical chamber. They knelt and earnestly begged for rain. Chongyang lowered his head in silence, sat a while, then spoke: “At noon tomorrow, there will be great rain.” The people all kowtowed and left. Some believed the immortal’s words would surely come true; others doubted, saying the immortal merely said what was expected to appease the crowd. Voices were mixed and confused.

The next morning, the red sun rose brightly. By noon, suddenly thunder roared and lightning flashed; heavy rain poured for half a day. Truly:

After long drought comes sweet rain,  
All things revive and breathe again.

The entire prefecture praised and rejoiced, saying this was indeed a living immortal descended. The crowd admired and praised him. The story pauses here.

---

In Wendeng County of this prefecture, there was a lord named Hao Lin, styled Bu’ao, dao name Tianran, born in the year Gengshen of the Jin Xizong Tianjuan era, on the third day of the tenth month. From youth he loved the dao, his wisdom innate. He had a younger brother named Jin. His parents passed away in turn. The family was wealthy and hereditary military officers. He delighted in reading the Book of Changes and was skilled in divination. At that time, he served as a guard captain in the city. Leading troops to pursue bandits, he fought a battle at Haikou, losing many soldiers. Hao Lin fled alone in panic; the bandits pursued fiercely. Suddenly a black mist rose, enveloping the area, obscuring all forms, enabling him to escape back to camp. Returning, he thought, “This time it was Heaven’s mercy that raised this black mist; how else could I have survived?” Seeing the dangers of officialdom, the illusions of the dusty world, the vanity of wealth and honor like a fleeting dream of the southern branch; princes and generals like bubbles floating on water—he saw through worldly feelings, resigned his post, and entrusted family affairs to his brother Jin. At twenty-five, he abandoned home to seek the dao, carrying two hundred taels of silver, bidding farewell to his brother, and hiding in the forest of divination.

He searched for three years without meeting a clear master. Then he came to Ninghai city and sat in a teahouse, suddenly hearing everyone praising, “What a living immortal descended!” Hao Lin asked the reason and learned of the origins of the Chongyang Zhenren. He thought, “I have searched for three years without meeting a clear master. Now here is such a high person; if I do not visit him, would I not miss my chance?” So he left the teahouse and came to Quanzhen Hermitage. Entering the hermitage, he looked up and saw a grand temple. He walked to the guest hall and sat down. A young dao boy came out with tea. Tianran asked, “Who is in charge here?” The boy answered, “Master Ma is in charge.” Tianran said, “Please ask Master Ma to come out and see me.” The boy went inside briefly, then a daoist came out, hair tied in three buns, wearing a crane cloak, three slight wisps of beard, about forty years old, clearly the one in charge, and quickly stood.

Ma Danyang came to the guest hall and saw a man not yet thirty, with clear brows and bright eyes, a face full of kindness. He thought, “This man surely comes seeking the dao.” He stepped forward and bowed, saying, “Sir, from which noble household do you come? Your honorable surname and given name?” Tianran hurriedly returned the bow and said, “I humbly come from Wendeng County, surname Hao, given name Lin, styled Bu’ao, dao name Tianran. May I respectfully ask your surname and dao name?” Danyang said, “I am a poor daoist surnamed Ma, styled Danyang. Pray, sir, what brings you to this humble hermitage?” Tianran replied, “Not hiding from Master Ma, I have loved the dao since youth and enjoyed reading the alchemical scriptures. Now perceiving the vanity of worldly affairs, I abandoned home to seek the dao, traveling for three years without meeting a true master. Those I have seen are all false outside and inside, fame and profit seekers, dao pretenders—unworthy of the dao. Now in Ninghai city I have heard that at Bao Hermitage there is a Chongyang master, of great virtue, who can foresee the future. I have come specially to seek him. I do not know if I may be received.” Danyang said, “My master has always disliked noise and clamor. Seeing you are a distant visitor seeking here, how could he refuse? I will go with you to see the master.”

The two went to the Chongyang alchemical chamber. Danyang pointed and said, “This is the one.” Tianran looked up and saw an old daoist with a broad forehead, wide brows, prominent nose, square mouth, full black beard, imposing appearance, sitting like Mount Tai, body like an ancient pine, lips like vermilion, eyes shining with divine light. “This is surely not a mere Peng Island immortal, but a celestial guest of the Ten Continents. I have searched for three years without meeting such an immortal wind and dao bone. To meet him today is a blessing of three lifetimes, a good fate from before. If I do not join the school, then when?” Turning to Danyang, he said, “I have come to seek to join the school, not for idle wandering. I hope brother will be my introducer and explain to the master.”

Danyang said, “If so, wait here a moment; I will go inside to report to the master.” He went before the master and kowtowed, saying, “Master, a gentleman from Wendeng County named Hao Lin, styled Bu’ao, has come specially to join the school and become a monk. I beg your mercy to accept him.” Chongyang said, “Tell him to come in.” Danyang called out, “Mr. Hao, my master commands you to enter and see him.” Tianran obeyed, entered the alchemical chamber, knelt, and said, “I sincerely abandoned home to seek the dao, searching for a clear master for three years without success. Today to see your honored presence is my fortune of three lifetimes. I beg Master’s great mercy to save me; I will never forget your grace in this life.”

Chongyang looked at him and saw traces of immortal bone: this man would one day reach true immortality. He spoke, “Cultivating the dao is indeed a bitter road; without true resolve, it is not easy. I see you are a former official, accustomed to wealth and honor, riding high carriages and fine horses, eating delicacies, wearing silks and brocades, dwelling in red chambers and warm pavilions. The life of a monk is full of a thousand hardships and a hundred demonic trials, not to be taken lightly. I think you cannot bear such suffering. Return home to enjoy your honors and wealth, accumulate merit and virtue for the next life—this too is a path of cultivation. Why insist on becoming a monk and suffer these troubles? What benefit is there?”

Tianran said, “If I were greedy for wealth and honor, I would not have abandoned office and home, nor traveled for three years without meeting a master. Now that I have come to join the school, I seek the great dao of longevity and eternal vision, the secret formulas of golden liquid and returning elixir. I fear no hardship; my heart is willing.” Chongyang said, “If you insist on becoming a monk and enduring hardship, you must establish a great and firm resolve, and never slacken. You must not violate my strict rules, but carefully observe the Most High’s laws, vigilant and mindful at all times. Clear and pure, you must understand your original true nature. Do not exhaust your body, do not shake your essence, do not let your thoughts wander—only then can you attain longevity. To live long, you must first cultivate the Three Refuges, then observe the Five Precepts, only then can you hear the dao. I will change your name to Datong, styled Taigu, dao name Guangning. On an auspicious day, you will change your dress and appearance to daoist robes, then you will truly be a disciple of the immortals.”

As the verse says:

To cultivate the self, one must rely on external practice;  
Inner and outer cultivation together bring the dao within reach.  
Refine until the heart holds not a single thing,  
Moonlight shines all day upon Mount Sumeru.
