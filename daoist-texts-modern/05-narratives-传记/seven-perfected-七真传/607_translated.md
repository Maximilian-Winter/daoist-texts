# Chapter Eight: Master Chongyang’s Southern Journey Encounters the Dao — Wang Xiaoxian’s Northern Turn Meets the True Master

**Verse:**

Life’s busy affairs, like lost dogs, run wild,  
The world’s cold and harsh, soon nothing remains.  
All chase after fleeting crows in flight,  
But I shall not fall to impermanence’s hands.  
Why drift in this bitter sea of flesh?  
Wealth, honor, and glory—how long can they last?  
Now that I see through the gate of right and wrong,  
At last, I shall not lag behind others’ steps.  
*(To the tune of “Butterfly Loves the Flower”)*

It is told that Master Hao Taigu, having heard his teacher’s words, asked earnestly, “Disciple has heard the master say that to cultivate the proper dao, one must first take the three refuges, then observe the five precepts. Yet I do not know what these three refuges and five precepts are. I beg the master to instruct me.” Chongyang replied, “The three refuges—Buddhists say they are Buddha, Dharma, and Sangha; Daoists say they are the Dao, the scriptures, and the master. In short, they are the essence, energy, and spirit within oneself. To take refuge in the dao is to sever desire and respect it, thus forever escaping the wheel of rebirth. Those who cultivate the dao always guard their original nature and primordial spirit, dwelling in the ground of their nature, not allowing thoughts or wild imaginings to disturb the sovereign of the heart. The outward forms do not enter, the inward forms do not exit; thus the conscious spirit naturally transforms into the undying primordial spirit, which is nurtured and preserved for long, finally freeing one from the sea of love and waves of desire’s torment. When the fruit of the dao is perfected, one can escape the cycle of death and birth in the six paths—how noble is this transcendence beyond desire’s sway!

To take refuge in the scriptures—the two venerable feet—one gains hearing of the true dharma. Those who truly cultivate the great dao fear that the primordial spirit has no firm support and falls into illusion and emptiness, unable to firmly stand on the ground. Hence, the Most High Patriarch transmitted thirty-six revered scriptures, the treasury of the true dharma eye, so that one may reach the path of genuine cultivation, have something to practice and verify, not be deluded by external teachings or false paths, and naturally refine and nurture primordial energy to assist and transform the primordial spirit. This is the nobility of the two venerable feet of spirit and energy, granting the great dao of longevity and enduring vision. Therefore, there is true dharma to be heard.

To take refuge in the master—the honored among the crowd—means not falling into wrong views. Nowadays, many heterodox paths abound, many side doors of various kinds: some carry and move essence, opening gates and supplementing the brain; some swallow saliva and absorb qi, ingesting qi and feasting on mist; some use battle arts; some employ arts of taming women; some point to the mountain root cavity as the mysterious gate, calling the two eyes yin and yang; some treat five metals and eight stones as supreme treasures, claiming them to be lead and mercury within the body; some chant spells and recite Buddha’s name, striking seven times to refine demons; some preserve spirit in silent contemplation, guiding out the yin spirit; others fast without grain or food, burn reeds to refine mercury—countless strange and heterodox side doors impossible to enumerate. All belong to illusionary bodily knots, difficult to transcend for ordinary or holy persons.

Therefore, one must obtain the true master’s secret instructions: refine essence into energy, refine energy to nurture spirit, refine spirit to return to emptiness; when the yang spirit appears, it leaps beyond the heavens outside heaven, becoming one with the Great Void, shining as brightly as sun and moon. Though heaven and earth decay, our body does not; thus it is called the golden immortal unbroken through myriad kalpas. This is called sage, immortal, Buddha—how could it not be the honored among all?

Thus, not falling into false and deluded views, one comes to know there is a true dao to cultivate. All who cultivate the dao always keep the three treasures within the body ever-present, never allowing them to dissipate—this is called the ‘ever-present three treasures.’ Nowadays, ordinary monks and laypeople do not understand the function of their own three treasures, mistaking temples and monasteries as the ever-present, and the three Buddhas and three Pure Ones as the three treasures. Who knows that the three Buddhas and three Pure Ones are also other names for one’s own three treasures? Revering one’s own three treasures is revering the three Buddhas and three Pure Ones. To recite Buddha and heavenly venerables is to recite one’s own heart. If one’s own heart is not upright, even reciting a hundred thousand times a day is like a fish chewing water—what use is it? As long as one honors the three treasures within and does not raise any thoughts, even reciting ten thousand scrolls of scripture is not as good as sitting in stillness for one moment.

Having taken refuge in the three treasures, one must remove the five precepts: killing, stealing, lust, wine, and falsehood. Holding these three refuges constantly and carefully guarding the five precepts, only then can one discuss the dao.”

Hearing this, Taigu trembled with awe and dared not disobey. He bowed to his master and fellow brothers and friends, then returned to the alchemical chamber to quietly nurture himself. No more is told here.

It is said that since Chongyang’s rain prayers were fulfilled, news spread far and wide, and many came to seek his instruction. Among them were Fang Demao of Yanjing, Nie Daoming of Yangzhou, Han Xiudao of Laizhou, Bai Yuanliang, and many lay followers, numbering several hundreds. The master, weary of the crowd and bustle, wished to journey to Zhongnan Mountain for a tour, intending to take Danyang to Kunlun. Fearing the temple would lack peace, he ordered Danyang and others to manage temple affairs. Danyang and the others bowed farewell, asking when the master would return. Chongyang said, “I shall return in the twelfth lunar month.” With that, he departed lightly.

Arriving at Mount Hua of the Western Peak, it happened that Xue Zixian wished to return to Tiantai and sat in transcendence on Jade Maiden Peak, leaving behind a verse:

Iron horses gallop through the sea of men,  
Mud dragons soar up to the heavens.  
The road to the three isles of Penglai  
Was never to the west.

Chongyang and his disciples placed his remains in a shrine and set fire to them, finding countless solid seeds among the sand and gravel.

Chongyang wished to ascend Zhongnan and, upon reaching Chang’an, met He Yuyan. They spoke of cold and warmth and together ascended Zhongnan. At that moment, the two masters were inside a cavern refining medicine. Chongyang led Yushan to pay respects to the immortal masters. The immortals Zhong and Lü rejoiced, saying to He Yushan, “You two are deeply rooted; to attain the great dao, you must accumulate merit and deeds. One day you shall ascend to the immortal rank.” Yushan said, “I wish to accumulate merit, but do not know what merit to accumulate. Please instruct me, master.” Lü Patriarch said, “This coming spring of the Southern Song will bring pestilence. I shall teach you methods to dispel the plague; go there to aid people and accumulate merit.” Yushan bowed in thanks. Chongyang recounted the affairs of Ma, Sun, Tan, and Qiu in detail. Master Zhong said, “You must cross the seven golden lotuses to respond to the summons and ascend.” Chongyang and Yushan bowed farewell and returned; Yushan went to Wuyue to aid and save. No more is told.

Chongyang bade farewell to the two immortals and returned to the Quanzhen temple, where the crowd welcomed him. After the new spring, Chongyang again ordered Danyang and others to watch the temple, commanding Changzhen and Taigu to accompany him on a southern journey. At this time, Chujī wished to follow and serve the master, stepping forward to report, “Disciple wishes to accompany the master on the journey and serve closely. I do not know the master’s intention.” Chongyang did not reply but called Changzhen and Taigu to prepare and depart. The disciples all escorted them five li before stopping.

Changzhen and Taigu traveled with the master, Chujī following behind. After twenty li, they rested at a pavilion. Chongyang saw Fuyang approaching and called Taigu to fetch the disciplinary rod. Taigu asked, “Master, what use for the rod?” Chongyang said, “Chujī has violated my clear rules; strike him forty times.” Changzhen and Taigu knelt together pleading for mercy; Chongyang struck twenty times, then they rose and continued walking.

After another five li, Chongyang said, “I feel some hunger in my belly and dryness in my mouth. There is nothing to buy along this stretch; fetching water to quench thirst will do.” Fuyang heard and hastily took a gourd dipper to seek water. But this road led toward Yanzhou’s main route; after going far, he found no water and returned to the master. Chongyang angrily said, “This fellow is lazy and weary, not knowing where to fetch water or not?” Raising a branch and pointing, he said, “Is this not water?” Changzhen and Taigu saw a pond by the roadside and hurried to fetch water for the master’s thirst. Chongyang drank, then raised his staff and struck Chujī’s head. Changzhen and Taigu intervened, and only then could they continue.

Fuyang thought to himself, “I searched everywhere and found nothing, yet there is water by the road—how strange.” He went to fetch water and suddenly vanished. He understood in his heart, “This is water my master conjured; when I went to fetch it, I disappeared.” Seeing them walk away, he hurried after. Along the way, things were not as they seemed; surely something was amiss. For over a month, Fuyang was constantly diligent, never leaving the master’s side.

At Jiangning, they rested overnight at Santai Cave, when suddenly heavy snow fell from the heavens. Chongyang said, “These days are cold with snow; you all should gather plenty of dry wood for the fire.” The three obeyed, climbing mountains and digging ridges to bring much dry wood to the cave. They went to the street to exchange money for rice and buy small vegetables, then cooked meals in the cave and ate. Chongyang ordered a fire to be lit and sat down. The three burned wood, the heat was fierce, the smoke suffocating, yet Chongyang sat upright, majestic and unmoving. Fuyang and Taigu opened the door to cool off; Chongyang ordered Changzhen to close the door, forbidding the two to enter. Outside, the two froze miserably, yet dared not disturb the master. They sat back to back, enduring the night’s hardship. At dawn, Changzhen opened the door and saw the two frozen and pitiful. He said, “I wished to open the door, but the master forbade it. You two froze yourselves outside; I nearly choked inside from smoke.” The three brothers then cooked food. After eating, Chongyang ordered them to set out. Seeing the heavy snow made travel impossible, yet fearing to disobey, they packed and left. By then, the three were bewitched and disordered, yet bore no resentment, braving the snow toward Suzhou. No more is told.

Meanwhile, within Changmen of Suzhou Prefecture stood the Tianqing Temple, where lived a Daoist named He Zhongli, of outstanding virtue and morality. Formerly a scholar from Huaiyang, he once came to Suzhou, lodging in the temple. His speech seemed mad, yet over time all accepted him. The sick sought healing; he brewed a decoction from a single stem of suoyi grass, and the sick recovered. Those who refused did not recover. The people called him “True Man of Suoyi.” In the spring of the Wuzi year, the emperor sent an inner attendant with fragrant tea to Suzhou, saying only that the court had matters to inquire. He True Man shook his head, saying, “Where there are Chinese, there are barbarians; where there is sun, there is moon.” The attendant reported back. The emperor said, “He truly knows my heart.” Thus he was granted the title “Master of Communicating Spirits.”

At this time, Chongyang and his three disciples arrived in Suzhou to tour and heard of He Zhongli’s dao. They went to visit him. Chongyang discussed the subtlety of returning spirit and restoring emptiness; He True Man also knew Chongyang’s root and they mutually revered each other. He True Man saw Changzhen and others and said, “You all are of superior root and great capacity, your merit and practice complete. Why worry about not becoming heavenly immortals?” The four stayed in the temple. The next day, He True Man sat in transcendence and appeared in the flesh. The locals lacquered and gilded his body. The sick burned incense and prayed, all receiving response.

That summer, in the reign of Emperor Song Xing of the Qiandao era, the emperor aspired to restore the Central Plains and constantly practiced archery and horsemanship in the palace. In the summer of the Yichou year, his crossbow string broke, injuring his eye. Chongyang heard and sighed, “Alas! A wise and enlightened ruler; his ambition is about to fade.” Chongyang led three disciples back to Shandong. No more is told.

Meanwhile, in the military officer’s manor of Yexian, Laizhou Prefecture, lived an elder surnamed Liu, named Jiacheng, a scholar who had passed the civil service exam and now served as prefect of Guide Prefecture. He had a wife surnamed Zhang and a son named Dacai. In the seventh year of Emperor Jin Xizong’s Huangtong era, that is the eighteenth year of Song Gaozong’s Shaoxing reign, on the twentieth day of the seventh month in the year of Mao, Zhang dreamed of a red glow covering her body. Upon waking, she felt labor pains and gave birth to a son, named Dade. When Dade was five, Zhang passed away. Liu remarried a wife surnamed Liu and had another son, named Dayong.

Only Dade, from a young age, loved the dao, was intelligent and wise, unmarried and frugal, fond of reading daoist scriptures. At fourteen, his father fell ill and died. Returning to Yexian, he daily longed for the alchemical scriptures. At twenty-two, he abandoned his home to seek the dao, carrying a hundred taels of silver, traveling far and wide to seek teachers and have his face read.

After five years abroad, now aged twenty-seven, he roamed Wuyue and returned to Yangzhou. One day in a restaurant, four Daoist masters passed by on the street. Among them was an elder, tall and large-bodied, with a majestic appearance and unparalleled character, eyes bright and radiant, shining forth light; the other three were also clear and spirited, dignified in appearance, with an otherworldly bearing and immortal demeanor. Thinking, “In five years of seeking, I have never met such people. These are men of the dao. I must approach and ask their origins and whereabouts, and beseech to become their disciple.” Hastily he hurried after them.

Entering the city, he bowed deeply and said, “Please, venerable masters, come to the teahouse; I wish to form a connection with you.” Chongyang saw that this man bore some immortal bone and could not help but test him once. He said to Changzhen and others, “This honored brother wishes to form a bond with us; very well, let us form a bond.”

The five entered the teahouse. Chongyang took the upper seat, the others sat accordingly. Dade asked, “Please tell me, venerable master, where is the immortal land? What is your surname and dao name?” Chongyang replied, “This poor daoist is a commoner from Xianyang, Shaanxi, surname Wang, styled Zhiming, dao name Chongyang.” Pointing to Tan, Hao, and Qiu, he said, “These three are all from Shandong, all my disciples. May I ask your honorable place of origin and your full name?” Dade said, “I am from Yexian, Laizhou, Shandong, surname Liu, styled Dade. My late father once served as prefect of Guide. Unfortunately, my father passed away, leaving one younger brother. Seeing how swiftly time passes and how worldly affairs are empty and fleeting, I abandoned home to seek the dao. For five years I have sought teachers but never met a true master. This morning, I met the master, whose conduct is pure and lofty, whose appearance is transcendent—surely a man of the dao. I wish to join under your tutelage. I beg master’s great mercy to save me; I shall never forget the master’s grace in this life or beyond.” Chongyang said, “You are a scion of a noble family; how can you bear to leave home and suffer hardship?” Dade said, “I wish to seek the Golden Elixir and great dao; even death by hardship is gladly borne. I have studied the past true immortals who diligently cultivated the great dao. Who among them was not steadfast in hardship, thus attaining the supreme wondrous dao and leaping beyond the cage?”

Chongyang said, “Since you are willing to endure hardship, come with me on a journey to Ninghai, Dengzhou.” Seeing the master’s consent, Dade kowtowed several times, then turned to bow to the senior brothers. After the greetings, he went to buy vegetarian snacks to offer. Chongyang said, “I have long abstained from cooked food.” Hearing this, Dade showed even greater respect and went to buy fruits and such, saying to the master, “Please wait a moment; I will go to the restaurant to fetch my travel bag and accompany you.” Dade took leave and left the city. In a moment, he returned with his bag, and the five set off together. No more is told.

Meanwhile, in Wendeng County, Dengzhou Prefecture, lived a virtuous gentleman surnamed Wang, named Xiaoxian. He lost his father young. His mother, Lady Tian, was devoutly vegetarian and fond of reciting immortal scriptures. Master Xiaoxian was born in the second year of Emperor Jin Xizong’s Tianhui era, the Wuwu year, on the sixteenth day of the third month at the hour of the tiger. He was born with heavenly grace and jade-like bones, extraordinarily intelligent from youth. He ate vegetarian with his mother and disliked worldly splendor. The family had an elder brother named Xiaochuan, who managed household affairs. Xiaoxian and his mother first entered heterodox paths, but cultivation bore no fruit. At age thirty-three, his mother ordered him to seek a true master outside, for only then could he cultivate the great dao. If he remained trapped in side doors, he would grow old and die without benefit.

Thus, Xiaoxian bade farewell to his mother and brother and set out to seek the supreme dao. First, he went to Bianjing in Henan and lodged with a layman, but it was a heterodox path. Then to Caozhou to visit a monk, but it was empty Zen sitting. Next, he went south to visit a Daoist, but it was the method of feasting on mist and ingesting qi. Over three years, he sought many teachers, none of true dao.

Turning to Dengzhou, he heard that the Quanzhen temple housed hundreds of Daoists, with strict rules and solemn rites, and a venerable elder from Shaanxi named Wang, dao name Chongyang, who could foresee the future and did not eat cooked food, renowned across many lands. Xiaoxian thought, “Searching far is not as good as searching near; there must be truth here. I obey my mother’s command to seek a master. These years I have met many false teachers but was not deceived. Who knew my own prefecture had such a great man?” Hastening to Ninghai, he arrived at Quanzhen temple within two days. There he saw a grand temple:

Palace towering, sparrows come and go,  
No filth runs ‘tween beams where dragons and snakes flow.  
Wayfarers like immortals come and go,  
Called Quanzhen, no error in the name they show.

To learn what becomes of Wang Xiaoxian, listen to the next chapter unfold.
