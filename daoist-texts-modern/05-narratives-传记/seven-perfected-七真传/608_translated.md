# Chapter Nine: Wang Chongyang Establishes Teachings and Practices the Dao of Virtue; Sun Bu’er Feigns Madness to Learn the Way of the Immortals

**Verse:**

With single heart intent to cross the seven golden lotuses,  
The teachings of the Perfected spread, revealing Nature’s form.  
From mouth to mouth flows the unsurpassed Dao,  
Connecting to later sages.  
The great Dao clearly lies before your eyes,  
Seek not the primordial in the secret of non-action.  
Within the crescent furnace, seize the jade soul,  
Refine the true lead.  
—(Right tune to *Washing Creek Sands*)

Now it happened that Wang Xiaoxian arrived at the mountain gate of the Quanzhen Hermitage, where on either side was carved a couplet that read:

*“See through worldly passions, and to ascend the nine-grade lotus platform,  
One may seek the path of awakening at our gate;  
Comprehend the emptiness of worldly affairs, and to avoid the suffering of the Three Paths,  
You must come here to ask for the crossing over.”*

Xiaoxian thought to himself, “This couplet truly expresses a heartfelt truth to save souls.” Just then, a Daoist elder emerged from within, his head bound in three topknots, long beard flowing in three strands, bearing an extraordinary demeanor and lofty spirit.

Meanwhile, Ma Danyang, since his master’s southern journey, came daily to the hermitage by day to manage affairs, returning home by night to cultivate the profound arts with Bu’er. At this moment, he was about to leave for home when a visitor appeared, no more than thirty years old, born with heavenly grace and jade-like bones, of refined and surpassing character. Approaching, he inquired, “Sir, may I ask the location of your esteemed abode? What noble purpose brings you to this humble hermitage?”

Xiaoxian hastened to bow and replied, “I am a humble man from Wendeng County, surname Wang, given name Xiaoxian. Having long heard that this treasured hermitage houses Master Chongyang, a man of the Dao, I come by my mother’s command to seek the master’s guidance. May I ask the master’s immortal surname and dharma name?”

Danyang answered, “I am a poor Daoist surnamed Ma, styled Danyang. Hearing your words, a traveler from afar coming to seek the Dao is indeed rare! Please enter the hermitage. However, my master has journeyed south and his return is uncertain. For now, rest here in this small hermitage for a few days, then we shall discuss further.” So he led the guest into the hall, instructing the steward to make Master Wang comfortable. Danyang then returned home. The story pauses here.

The next day, near noon, word came that the master had returned to the hermitage. All hastened to dress and don their caps, going out to greet him. A great throng surrounded the master, men and women alike, countless in number. You ask, whence did all these people come? It was because Master Chongyang, here in this hermitage, preached the Dao and saved souls, his fame vast and far-reaching. Men and women of all four quarters, all lovers of goodness, came to take refuge under his banner. Hearing of the master’s southern journey, they came out along the way to welcome him. Danyang and others stepped forward to bow, escorting the master inside, then paid respects to the elder disciples, sharing the hardships of the journey through wind and frost.

Danyang then introduced Wang Xiaoxian, who stepped forward to pay respects to the master and explained his story. Chongyang said, “Since you have true heart toward the Dao and wish to join our gate, you must first establish a great vow. As the ancients say: ‘Those who cultivate have no path without a vow; no vow, no accomplishment.’”

Hearing this, Xiaoxian swore by Heaven, “I, Wang Xiaoxian, submit to the master and embrace the Dao. Should I ever betray my master or the Dao, break precepts or violate rules, may I suffer a cruel death, fall into hell, and never find release.”

Seeing his sincere resolve, Chongyang said, “I now rename you Chuyuan, styled Tongjing, and you may be called Yuyang.” Then he ordered Liu Dade to come forward and pay respects to the senior brothers, instructing, “I rename you Chuxuan, styled Tongmiao, and grant you the title Changsheng. You two may choose an auspicious day to change your clothes and wear your hair in topknots.”

Liu and Wang bowed to the master, then to their fellow disciples, and returned to their alchemical chambers, single-minded in self-cultivation. The story pauses here.

---

As for Chongyang, upon returning to Quanzhen Hermitage, he recalled his master’s words and vowed to universally transform the Three Continents, all converging at the Five Assemblies. The Five Assemblies are: first, Equality; second, Golden Lotus; third, Jade Splendor; fourth, Three Luminaries; fifth, Seven Treasures. He then posted a proclamation wherever he went, which read:

*“I hold that Equality is the ancestor of Dao and virtue, the source of purity, the root of the Golden Lotus and Jade Splendor, the origin of the Three Luminaries and Seven Treasures. It universally aids all beings, illuminating the mundane world. Silver flames fill the Eight Extremities, colorful clouds steam across the Ten Directions. Everyone wishes to spit out the yellow sprouts, none wander the black path. Jade Splendor is the ancestor of spirit; Golden Lotus is the root of qi. Spirit and qi intertwine, called the numinous immortals. When the mind forgets thought and worry, it transcends the realm of desire; when the mind forgets attachment to conditions, it transcends the realm of form; when the mind does not cling to emptiness, it transcends the formless realm. Beyond these three realms, spirit dwells in the domain of immortals and sages, nature lies in the pure void. May all reach this, may each enter this realm.”*

When Chongyang posted this proclamation, a wandering elder saw it and sighed, “Such vast vow and depth—truly worthy to be called the reincarnation of Wang Sheng.”

In the summer of the year Xinmao, the reign title changed to Qianyou. The court official Fan Chengda returned from Jin, learning that Emperor Qinzong had perished to the Jin.

In the year Renzhen, Yu Yunwen was appointed Left Prime Minister. In the twelfth month of winter, Zhu Peng completed the *Outline and Details of the Comprehensive Mirror for Aid in Government*, clarifying rites and righteousness, carefully studying scholarship, yet avoiding mention of the two schools of Buddhism and Daoism, fearing to disturb ruler and people’s hearts. At that time, the Patriarch Lü saw the Song emperor revering Heaven, diligent to the people, fond of the Dao, and thus joyfully traveled and preached: passing Huating, he revived a camphor tree with elixir; roaming Jiangling, he spoke of restraining Fu Sheng. The Grand Minister Wang Lun guarded Yuezhou; a wandering Daoist came to visit, saying, “You are a mad monk of Jingzhou, named Xie, who has been reborn several times as you.” Lun was startled, “To know the causes of several past lives—that is immortal indeed.” He wished to speak more but suddenly lost his place. Lun then feigned illness and returned home, deeply pondering the Dao. Later he met Immortal Liu who taught him the alchemical way and the secret of corpse liberation; later he passed beyond by corpse liberation. The Grand Minister Liu Hong recommended Zhu Xi as editor at the Privy Council, but he did not come. The Song emperor praised his integrity and retirement, ordering him to oversee the Chongdao Temple in Taizhou. Zhu Xi heard that Zhang Pingshu had attained the Dao and ascended in Chongdao Temple, and greatly admired him. Pingshu had once worked with Xiang Chuanweng in the same trade but failed the imperial exams; now Xiang was prominent, Pingshu had ascended. Xi sighed, “The prominent are sunk in the bitter sea; the failed attain the Dao and ascend. Worldly wealth and honor—how can they compare to the Dao of immortals!” At that time, there was Sun Baoguang, styled Yuanming, who deeply studied the learning of nature and life. During the Yuanfeng era, he met Guang Mengzi who taught him the secret of returning elixir; he called himself the Nameless One. He roamed Ying Prefecture, farming vegetables, also called the Old Gardener of Shangqiu. He chose people to save.

In the spring of the year Jiawu, the Song changed the reign title to Chunxi. Yu Yunwen passed away. The Annam king Li Tianxiang died; his son Longhan succeeded him and reported the mourning to the Song emperor, who sent envoys to confer titles. Zhu Xi was summoned as Secretary Gentleman but did not come. He was assigned to oversee the Chongyou Temple on Mount Wuyi and again ordered to govern the Nankang army, gathering scholars for discussion. That autumn, the Song emperor established Consort Xie as Empress.

---

On the day Dingyou, the Chunxi calendar was adopted. Chongyang saw the Song emperor’s investiture of the empress and calendar reform, admiring his reverence for sages and love of scholars, fulfilling the way of the ruler. Yet he felt uneasy in his golden land. At this time, Daoist followers gathered to lecture scriptures and discuss the Dao; Daoists and laypeople alike assembled.

One day in the lecture hall, Chongyang broadly proclaimed, “Since you have entered my gate to cultivate the self and learn the Dao, you must first refine your nature before cultivating your life. Nature belongs originally to wood; when pierced, it produces smoke and fire. Fire is the heart. When the original nature is tranquil, the heart-fire extinguishes itself. Hence the *Yinfu Jing* says: ‘Fire born of wood, calamity arises and must be overcome; treachery born in the state, when stirred, must collapse.’ To know this and cultivate is called sagehood. Therefore, cultivators first refine the nameless primal fire, using the heart to govern the heart, extinguishing all greed, ignorance, jealousy, harm to others for self-benefit, arrogance, stubbornness, violence, and all manner of evil thoughts. Then sweep away the three minds of past, present, and future. When the human heart is pure and empty, the Dao heart naturally reveals itself. The Dao heart is the original spirit of the void and numinous, the awakened illumination of the self, refined to perfect clarity, allowing no dust of thought to disturb. When encountering conditions, no smoke or fire arises; purely and simply, no matter if the void shatters, my nature remains clear and alone. When the nature is perfected, the foundation of the elixir is firm. If the nature is not solid, the great Dao may be formed but also destroyed. To cultivate the great Dao, one must cultivate both nature and life, crossing from the manifest to the unmanifest, and from the unmanifest controlling the manifest. Thus the numinous is spirit, longevity is qi. Without nourishing the primordial spirit, one cannot penetrate numinous transformations; without subduing the primordial qi, one cannot extend life and years. Life does not depart from nature; life without nature cannot stand; nature does not depart from life; nature without life cannot exist. Nourish spirit with qi, contain qi with spirit; naturally metal and wood unite, water and fire complete each other, forming the embryonic fetus, called the Golden Elixir, also named the Mysterious Governor. Then use the union of Heaven and Earth to form the fetal immortal. Three years of warming and nurturing is like nursing an infant; nine years of great settling is like mastering comprehensive learning. Then one enters and exits without gap, transforming and manifesting powers—all sought within oneself.” 

---

At this time, Sun Bu’er received the master’s transmission and diligently cultivated without slackening. For seven years she broke through obstacles, returning again and again to the three fields, all hundred orifices flowing freely. She called herself the Quiet Recluse. She also listened within and came forward to pay respects. Chongyang descended from his seat, called Bu’er to the alchemical chamber, and further taught her the way of the Golden Elixir’s return, the nurturing of the fetus and emergence of spirit, and the methods of ascending on cranes. After instructing her thoroughly, he said, “Your fate is to attain the Dao in the region of Luoyang, Henan. You may go there and feign madness to temper yourself, begging by day in the bustling market, lodging by night in a broken kiln, polishing body and mind. When the Dao fruit is complete, you will naturally shed the old body and transform spirit. Then you may accumulate merit and practice; at that time, I will come to lead you to worship at the Golden Palace and enter the Western Pool.” Bu’er thanked the master, saying, “If I attain the Dao, I will never forget the master’s grace.” She then took leave of Danyang, telling him all the master’s instructions and her mission to Luoyang. She also bade farewell to the fellow disciples and returned home, agreeing to set out the next day. That evening Danyang returned home, giving many words of advice.

---

At dawn, after breakfast, Bu’er went to her room, let down her hair, rubbed dust and grime on her face, changed into a tattered sleeve robe, and disguised herself in the manner of a madwoman. In her hand she carried a broken cattail fan, on her shoulder a tattered hemp cloth, and wrapped a gourd ladle. Laughing loudly, she clasped Danyang’s hand and said, “Farewell! May we meet again by fate!” Then she ran out. Seeing this, Danyang’s eyes filled with tears. Tingzhen, Tingrui, and the whole family rushed out, and seeing her like this, each burst into loud sobbing. Tinggui asked, “Why has mother suddenly gone mad like this? Where is she going?” Danyang replied, “Your mother now follows the master’s command to go to Luoyang to temper body and mind. But the matters of cultivation are not for you to know, nor need you worry. Go on with your own affairs.”

All the Daoist friends of Quanzhen Hermitage came to see her off. Danyang said, “Bu’er has already gone.” The Ma family, big and small, all held back tears. The story pauses here. Danyang and the Daoist friends praised Bu’er’s steadfast Dao heart, each sighing as they returned to the hermitage.

---

Now Sun Bu’er, disguised as a madwoman, begged alms along the road to live. After more than two months, she finally reached the borders of Luoyang. She sought out the Henan Prefecture, and beyond the city, behind Yunxi Temple, found a broken kiln and took residence there. By day she begged in the city, by night she lodged in the broken kiln to cultivate herself. Not long after, a mad old woman often came to accompany her. You wonder, whence came this madwoman? It was none other than Immortal Lady Geng, who had attained the way of Magu, cultivated to transcendence, and now manifested to guide disciples. Seeing Bu’er’s firm Dao heart and her tempering here, fearing she might suffer harm from ill-intentioned ones, she often accompanied her in the kiln. Bu’er secretly rejoiced, “I am a fake madwoman, tempering here. A true madwoman comes to accompany me—truly rare!”

---

Several days passed. One day, Bu’er went to the street to beg alms and met two proselytizers. Though Bu’er was mad, her age was not old; she looked like a wealthy lady, fair-skinned and well-formed, endearing to behold. The two conspired, “This madwoman lodges in the kiln behind Yunxi Temple at night. If we live there with her, will we not benefit for life?” United in purpose, that night they went to the kiln, laid down their belongings, and began to stir desires. They lit a fire to illuminate the madwoman. There sat Bu’er meditating, beside her an old woman asleep. The two said, “This madwoman even speaks of cultivation, sitting in meditation.” As they prepared to approach, Bu’er, steadying her spirit, suddenly heard voices and opened her eyes to see the two proselytizers coming forward. Knowing their ill intent, she quickly stood and dodged behind the old madwoman.

The two shone their firelight and advanced. The old madwoman rose and said, “This is our immortal’s den. What sort of people come here to wander?” She stood and seized the two, beating them until their heads were broken and eyes dazed. They tried to flee but could not move. They struggled desperately, but the old madwoman pointed at them, and their own companions pulled them back and beat them. The two were driven out of the kiln, fighting all the way to the gate of Yunxi Temple, crying out to Heaven and Earth. The Daoists in the temple heard and opened the gate to see the two proselytizers beaten, bleeding and battered. The Daoists persuaded them apart. The two regained their senses and saw it was their own companions who had fought all night, leaving them sore and bleeding. The Daoists asked, “What quarrel brought you to such a state?” The two could not answer and only wept. The Daoists closed the door and left.

---

The two proselytizers dared not return to the kiln. They conferred, “What magic does that old madwoman wield to treat us so? She said, ‘This is our immortal’s den,’ forbidding us to lodge here. That’s one thing, but to beat us so badly, bleeding all over, pain unbearable.” Helpless, they slept outside the mountain gate for one night, then at dawn returned to the city.

---

Bu’er saw the two beaten and crying out, driven away. She thought, “This madman came to harm me. If not for the old madwoman driving him off, I would have suffered greatly. Truly the gods protect me; such marvelous aid! I must look to Heaven and give thanks.” She knelt on both knees, kowtowing, and saw the old madwoman laugh heartily before departing. The story pauses here.

---

As for the two proselytizers, after recovering, they plotted again, “This young madwoman is surely a fish in our net, a bird in our cage, and we can surely capture her. Only the old madwoman frightens us.” One said, “I have a plan. The madwoman begs daily near the northeast second gate. I will go with you to a deserted village, where no one lives, and wait for her. We will surely clip her wings so she cannot fly.”

Their plan fixed, they went to the deserted village to lie in wait. From afar, they saw the madwoman coming and rejoiced.

---

But Immortal Lady Geng, knowing Bu’er was in danger, urgently sent mountain gods and local spirits to secretly protect her. Bu’er was walking in the wilderness when she looked up and saw the two proselytizers rushing toward her. Knowing their ill intent, she hurried to flee. Bu’er was a woman, and a wealthy beauty by birth; how could she run far? The two soon caught up. At this moment, Bu’er had no means to resist and thought, “My fate is ended.” The two were about to strike when suddenly a great wind arose, blowing sand and stones, knocking the two proselytizers to the ground. Their heads were smashed in several places, blood flowing over the earth. Seeing the great wind, Bu’er hurried back to the kiln. It was truly:

*With righteous heart, immortals always protect;  
A thousand demons vanish from here.  
Free and untroubled, body unharmed,  
At last I believe the profound功 is truly blessed.*
