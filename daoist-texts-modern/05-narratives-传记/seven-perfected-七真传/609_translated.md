# Chapter Ten: The Assembly of the Seven Golden Lotuses of the Profound Teaching — The Six Immortal Friends of the Flourishing Tradition Bear the Funeral

A Poem:

Gathered, the Golden Lotuses return to their homeland,  
Squarely guiding the assembly of the worthy and good.  
The teaching spreads across the great earth, revered for a thousand autumns,  
Its merit shines in the elixir heavens, exalted through ten thousand ages.  
Abandoning the world, deaf to its illusions,  
Casting off dust—why heed the vast mundane haze?  
Perfect and clear is the original nature, the true thusness of being;  
Transforming in stillness, passing rightly, the sovereign of the true dharma.

Now, those two disciples of the teaching waited for the wind to die down, then rose and said, “That mad woman wields sorcery; never again shall we be tainted by her.” The two embraced their pain and returned. No more shall we tell of this.

In the spring of the year of the Rooster, the Golden Lord Yong passed away. The Grandson Jing ascended, becoming Emperor Zhangzong. Since the passing of Emperor Gaozong of Song, the emperor had wished to abdicate and conclude mourning. Now he retired to the Chonghua Palace, and the Crown Prince Zhun took the throne as Emperor Guangzong, honoring the retired emperor as the Longevity Sovereign and establishing Li Daozhi’s daughter as Empress.

In the year of the Dog, the era name changed to Shaoxi, while Jin changed its era to Mingchang. Emperor Guangzong fell ill, and governance was decided by the Empress, forbidding the retired emperor from attending court at Chonghua Palace.

Meanwhile, Wang Chongyang had already gathered Qiu, Liu, Tan, Ma, Hao, Wang, and Sun—seven blossoms of the Golden Lotus complete. Suddenly he summoned the disciples and said, “The Ancestor Master once gave me a verse, saying that people should be born in an age of loyalty and filial piety. Now the sovereign does not practice filial way; I shall go to meet my appointment at Penglai.” Then he imparted the way of returning the golden liquid to the elixir to Tan Changzhen, Wang Chuyi, Liu Changsheng, Hao Taigu, and others, and spoke to Danyang: “Among my disciples, men and women number over one thousand; those who have attained my way number several dozen; only Qiu, Liu, Tan, Ma, Hao, Wang, and Sun have truly completed the way. Each of you has gained something, but Qiu Chujie has not uttered a single word. This man’s root is deep and firm; he will surely become a great vessel. We all fall short of him, so I have devoted myself to tempering him. After I pass, you must transmit to him the essence of the elixir; then I shall have no further worries.” The disciples said, “We beg Master to remain long in the mortal world, universally saving all our foolish selves, that we may all reach the shore of the way and emerge from the sea of confusion.” Chongyang said, “Heaven’s decree is fixed; it cannot be forced otherwise. Only since Danyang entered the way has his family, though wealthy, spent much creating temples and receiving masters and friends, consuming most of his fortune. His merit ranks foremost among the Golden Lotus leaders.” Then he turned to Qiu Chujie and said, “You have entered my gate for more than twenty years, suffering many trials, yet not a word of the way’s dharma have you spoken. After I pass, you must seek Ma Danyang’s profound instructions, then accumulate merit and practice; the great way can be fulfilled.” He summoned a carpenter and ordered him to build a wooden shrine, with outer doors and handles for four to carry. It was to be made swiftly, ready for use. Having given these instructions, he sent everyone back to the elixir chamber.

That night, Chongyang’s body suddenly transformed; his whole form was covered with foul sores, and he cried out without cease. Chujie, Danyang, and the others heard their master’s wild cries and hurried into the elixir chamber, asking, “Master, why are you thus?” Chongyang said, “Suddenly my body is restless, breaking out in sores that burn with unbearable pain.” Seeing their master’s extreme suffering, each grieved deeply. Outside, the crowd debated: some said, “Master is a Great Luo Heavenly Immortal; why this strange transformation? Perhaps he is testing our resolve; it cannot be judged yet.” Others said, “Master lacks true inner skill; he only feigns appearance and reputation, so this affliction comes upon him.” Opinions varied. Only Danyang understood and thought, “My master desires transcendence, changing his form thus to test us.” Only Chujie and Chuyi attended him diligently day and night. After several days, the sores burst and festered, emitting a foul stench. Some disheartened ones, seeing Chongyang’s condition, dispersed.

It was the first year of Shaoxi under Song Guangzong, and the first year of Mingchang under Jin Zhangzong, the year of the Dog, in early spring on the full moon day. At seventy-nine years old, Master Chongyang was about to return to the True. He summoned his disciples and instructed, “After I depart at noon today, you must carry my shrine to Guanzi in the west. At the place where the cords break, bury me there.” The disciples, fearful, begged for parting words. Chongyang declared:

The earth’s lungs, Chongyang’s son, forcibly calls upon wind and harm.  
Coming with sun and moon, departing to west and east at will.  
Companioned by clouds and moon, neighbors to void and emptiness.  
One numinous true nature remains, not following the world’s sameness.

The disciples hurried to take brush and ink to record this. Chongyang then chanted:

Since receiving the mandate to descend to the mortal realm,  
I have dwelt in dust and ashes, self-cultivated.  
Repeatedly the immortal breeze urges awakening from dreams,  
Several calls of the fish drum summon the heart’s return.  
Three threes complete the divine embryo’s formation,  
Nine nines fulfill merit, opening the eye of the way.  
Seven golden lotuses have now united,  
Leaving a special cloud path to Penglai.

Having finished chanting, he suddenly returned to the True. White cranes and azure phoenixes, celestial attendants in procession, rose slowly into the blue heavens. Near and far, scholars and commoners alike gazed and cried out in reverence and worship, all knowing that Master Chongyang had ascended to Heaven.

---

Meanwhile, Danyang and the others, seeing their master return to the True, each bowed, weeping and kneeling to send him off. They purified his body, changed his clothes, placed him in the shrine, sealed the doors, and affixed the sealing strips. Danyang said, “Master’s last words are known to all. After Master ascends, his physical body must be sent to Shaanxi. Those willing to escort it, step forward.” Only Qiu Chujie, Hao Taigu, Tan Chuduan, Liu Chuxuan, and Wang Chuyi stepped forward, saying, “We are willing to escort.” Danyang nodded, “Among our one thousand plus brothers, only these true aspirants remain: Qiu, Liu, Tan, Ma, Hao, Wang, and Sun. I am a fellow wayfarer; these decades have cost me much effort. Now seeing through it all, only five remain. Together with you six, we can carry it to Shaanxi. Let us set the date and begin.”

Danyang left a few trusted wayfriends to watch the temple. He wished to hire some workers to help carry, but all said the journey was long and it would be better for the brothers themselves to bear the burden. Danyang agreed, saying, “To endure the hardest of hardships is to become the best of men. The road is long; we cannot bring much white money, only one hundred taels of silver, to be used and supplemented along the way by alms.” All agreed, so they arranged a simple vegetarian meal, performed rites, and set out.

---

At first, others carried the shrine for them. After five li, only forty or fifty remained. After ten more li, the crowd dispersed, leaving only the six. Suddenly a foul stench rose from the shrine, but the six united in spirit, feeling no disgust. Traveling by day and night, leaving the borders of Dengzhou, the shrine suddenly emitted a fragrant scent and became light as if empty. Crossing Henan, their money nearly spent, they reached between Linbao and Kuoxiang in Shanzhou, where people provided meals along the way. After eating and opening their funds, one said, “I do not sell food here. But because an old Daoist ahead asked for alms, you need not pay.” Danyang and the others thanked them and continued.

The six were puzzled and unaware. Danyang said, “Could it be that Master is ahead, manifesting alms?” The others believed him. From then on, whenever they reached places without inns and felt hunger, someone always prepared vegetarian meals.

Passing Tongguan, Chujie said, “Whenever we feel hunger, there is food—buns, pies, noodles, or dumplings. Surely Master is ahead, manifesting alms. I will hurry forward to see and understand.” Changzhen and others said, “A fine plan!” So Fuyang hurried ahead to the village to observe.

---

Meanwhile, Master Chongyang, astride a white crane in the sky, saw that from Tongguan to Huayin inns were sparse. Fearing his disciples’ hunger, he descended to the village to manifest alms for them. While gathering alms there, Chujie hurried up and, unable to avoid him, was seen. He quickly knelt and said, “We discussed behind, knowing Master is ahead manifesting alms. Now seeing you, we beg your compassion and salvation.” Men and women of the village all witnessed this. Chongyang could not escape and said to Chujie, “You wretched obstacle, today you leak Heaven’s secret; your crime is grave. Though you may sincerely cultivate the way, you cannot escape the great demon’s retribution.” Then he pointed to the sky, “Danyang and the others are coming.” The crowd looked up, but Chongyang brushed his sleeve and vanished like a clear wind, leaving no trace. Suddenly the old Daoist was gone, and all were astonished. Chujie knelt on the ground, seeing his master transform into wind and depart, he wept and bowed deeply, then left the village. The elder brothers had already arrived.

---

Meanwhile, Danyang and the others saw Fuyang rushing into the village. The five hurried to shoulder the shrine, arriving before the village gate. Seeing Fuyang come out in tears, they asked, “Did you see Master?” Fuyang recounted the story of the master manifesting alms but said the master declared that though he sincerely cultivates, he cannot escape the great demon. “I wonder what great demon I shall face later?” Liu Changsheng looked at Fuyang and said, “No wonder Master said you cannot escape the great demon. Looking at your face, you have two snake-like lines called ‘Soaring Serpent Locks Mouth’—you will starve to death later.” Fuyang asked, “Brother Liu, can you truly read faces?” Liu said, “In youth I loved physiognomy. Though not fully learned, I know six or seven principles. Everyone’s wealth, children, and rank are certain; lifespan, fortune, and hardship vary. Moreover, Brother Qiu’s physiognomy is clear; who would not know it?” Fuyang asked, “Can the ‘Soaring Serpent Locks Mouth’ be resolved?” Liu said, “What resolution? Emperor Liang Wu had that mark and starved to death in Taicheng. He was an emperor; how could we mere mortals avoid it?” Hearing this, Fuyang sighed, “I was young and fond of the way, abandoning home at sixteen, meeting Master at nineteen. Over twenty years I suffered many trials, relying on shallow roots but steadfast will, serving Master diligently. Yet I received no word of the way. Now Master has transcended, and today I encounter this again, begging and pleading, only to be told I cannot escape the great demon, then transformed to wind and gone. Now hearing Brother Liu’s words, that I will starve, what use is my cultivation?” He burst into bitter weeping.

---

Changzhen and the others heard Fuyang’s words and were also saddened. Danyang said, “Brother Qiu, do not grieve. Brother Liu’s physiognomy is quite accurate but only for ordinary people’s lifetimes. You and I are monks; such judgments do not apply. I have heard Master say your root is extraordinary. Though you suffer some trials now, when your merit is complete, none of us will compare.” Hearing Danyang’s words, Fuyang stopped crying. The brothers lifted the shrine and continued. From then on, no one offered alms; the brothers had to manifest alms themselves to satisfy hunger.

Passing Huazhou, they reached the border of Lintong, where there was a warm spring, its waters naturally hot—warm in summer, hotter in winter. The brothers stopped to bathe. Danyang said, “This place is the vein of Mount Li, internally bound with sulfur, making the water hot. Such waters are rare in the world. This water can wash away sores, scabies, and eczema, cool skin fires, and dispel filth and miasma. I shall later gather alms here in Qin Chuan to nurture the way, often cleansing in this spring.”

After bathing, they carried the shrine past Chang’an to twenty li west of E County. Suddenly all the ropes broke. Danyang said, “Master’s last words instructed that after passing Guanzi, at the place where the cords break, we should bury him. Now we have arrived; the cords have broken. What place is this? Whose land is this?” He sought to ask, and a passerby replied, “This place is mostly Liu and Jiang families, called Liujiang Village. This land belongs to Liu Yuanwai.” Hearing this, Danyang and Changzhen went to Liu Yuanwai’s home.

---

Meanwhile, Liu Yuanwai was at home playing with his grandson in his arms. Danyang and Changzhen entered, saw the elder holding the child, and respectfully asked, “May we ask if this is the residence of Liu Yuanwai?” The elder quickly put down the grandson and replied, “This is my home. What business do you two masters have?” Danyang said, “We carry our master’s spirit shrine here. Before Master’s transcendence, he instructed that his shrine be carried to the place where the cords break and buried there. Now the cords have broken here, and this is your land. I humbly ask the great benefactor to show mercy.” The elder said, “I hear your accents; you are not from here. Why bring your master to be buried here?” Danyang said, “To be frank, we are from Shandong. Our master was born in Dawei Village, Xianyang County, surname Wang, given name Jia, style name Zhiming, Daoist title Chongyang. We carry out his last instructions to move his remains here for burial.” The elder laughed heartily, “Do not speak nonsense! Master Chongyang was a Great Luo Heavenly Immortal; how could he die? He dwelt in a cave for twelve years without eating grain or water and never died. You say he died? I do not believe it. It is said: when the great way is fulfilled, one refines an adamantine undying body, called the Golden Immortal. If your master is truly Master Chongyang, his mortal body must be intact. You may open the shrine and see. I have met Master Chongyang several times and know him well.” Danyang said to Changzhen, “We carried the shrine through Henan; it was like an empty shrine. Now hearing the elder’s words, opening it would suit me well. Please, elder, come open the doors and see.” Liu Yuanwai joyfully agreed and went with Danyang to the shrine.

Danyang repeated the elder’s words to the group, who all rejoiced, saying, “This makes sense.” They opened the shrine doors and saw only an empty shrine, with only clothes, hats, and socks remaining. The group was amazed and delighted, restored the garments inside, closed the doors, and said to Liu Yuanwai, “Since our master has transcended, we shall bury this shrine here to honor him.” The elder said, “This indeed shows Master Chongyang’s immortal trace. Let us bury him here; we too shall share in his immortal blessing. Please, masters, come to my home for a meal while I call workers to bury the immortal shrine.” All bowed in thanks.

The elder and the group went home, where the steward prepared a vegetarian feast. Workers were sent to dig the grave, and a vegetarian banquet was offered before the spirit. After the meal, Danyang and the others went to oversee the burial, kowtowing several times and offering some money. Then all returned to Liu Yuanwai’s home. After the meal, Danyang bowed in thanks, and Liu Yuanwai saw them out the great gate. The six disciples then took their leave.

Thus:

Using this mortal body to refine the dharma body,  
When merit is complete, the original truth is revealed.  
The void itself manifests the primordial spirit,  
Not separate from the world, yet not following it.
