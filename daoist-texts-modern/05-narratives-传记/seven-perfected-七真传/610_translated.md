# Chapter Eleven: The Six Immortal Friends of Da Wei Village Are Scattered — The Two Brothers Meet at the Little Hua Temple

**Verse:**

The dust of the world is brief, the path is long,  
Without true resolve, merit is hard to fulfill.  
Do not look back, follow the flowing stream—  
Life and death’s wheel is like a boat adrift.  
Rest, rest!  
Urgently and fiercely examine yourself,  
Do not wander idly.  
Life does not linger long;  
Seek the true lead with care.  
Be cautious in cultivation,  
Set the furnace and establish the cauldron,  
Forget the passing seasons.  
Leisurely, leisurely.  
*(Right tune: “Cherishing the Hairpin”)*

Now it happened that the six brothers of Ma Danyang parted ways from Liu Jiang Village. Along the road they discussed among themselves: “Since we have arrived here, we must make a journey to Da Wei Village. One, to meet our senior brothers; two, to report our master’s ascension to Heaven, so that his household may know.” United in purpose, they set out for Da Wei Village.

Meanwhile, Wang Jinyu and his brother Jinbao, ever since their parents had gone abroad to cultivate the dao, were regarded by the clan as having become immortals—Wang Chongyang and Heyu Shan ascending to transcendence. Thus, they built a temple, fashioned immortal statues, burned incense morning and evening, prayed at dawn and dusk, and every request was answered, displaying great numinous power.

Jinyu had begotten one son and two daughters; Jinbao had two sons. Jinyu had long since passed away. At that time, Jinbao was over fifty years old, generous and joyful in charity, respectful of monks and the dao, and his household remained wealthy. As he was admiring flowers before the hall, six Daoist friends entered from outside. Jinbao hurried forward to greet them, inviting them to sit in the hall, and immediately ordered the household to brew tea and prepare food.

Ma Danyang and the others stepped forward with bows, saying, “Might this be Senior Brother Wang?” Jinbao returned their salutations and asked, “I am surnamed Wang. May I inquire from which place you all hail, and what brings you here?” Danyang replied, “We are all from Shandong, disciples of Master Chongyang. We have long heard that our master was from Da Wei Village in Xianyang, named Wang Jia, styled Zhiming. There are two senior brothers in your household: the elder is Jinyu, the younger Jinbao. Is this your residence?”

Hearing this, Jinbao and the others bowed again, saying, “Since you brothers have come, I was truly unaware and failed to welcome you properly—please forgive our disrespect.” The group replied in unison, “We came hastily to pay respects; we dare not ask for forgiveness.”

Jinbao asked, “Since you have come from afar, surely you know the whereabouts of my father. We beg you to enlighten us.” Danyang then recounted the master’s teachings in Shandong, his passing on the full moon of the third month this year, and the instructions he left behind, detailing the manifestations along the way. Jinbao listened with great joy and said, “Now hearing from you brothers, I know my father has ascended to immortality. But what of my mother’s fate?” Danyang answered, “I have heard from the master that your mother has already attained the dao and now accumulates merit in the mortal realm, awaiting summons. It will not be long before she too ascends. How is everyone in your household?” Jinbao then related his family affairs and invited them to stay for a meal and lodging.

The next day, after accompanying them to the temple and performing incense offerings and bows, all sat down. Danyang said, “Brothers, since we are here in this temple, let us consider it as if before our master himself. When the master was about to transform, he gave instructions known to all. Elder Changzhen has already heard the great dao and may now begin work, accumulating merit; Taigu, Changsheng, Yuyang, and others have all gained something. We must press forward with courage and refinement, tempering our nature and heart, each accumulating great merit, so that the day of transcendence will come. Only Brother Qiu alone has neither external merit nor internal dao arts. What shall be done?”

Fuyang, hearing Danyang’s words, hastened forward and knelt, lamenting: “All you brothers have attained the dao, but I alone have heard nothing. I beg Brother Ma to have pity and take me along. Even in death, I will not forget your kindness.” Danyang quickly helped him up and said, “When the master transformed, he entrusted me with the words: as long as you diligently cultivate without slackening, I will transmit to you the supreme dao. If you advance in practice, you will naturally become true one day.” Fuyang kowtowed again and rose. That day all returned together to Jinbao’s home.

After three days, after breakfast, they discussed plans. Changzhen wished to go west to Shu, to accumulate merit and nurture the dao; Wang Yuyang desired to return to Shandong to visit his mother. Danyang said, “Brother Qiu and I will remain here in Qin Chuan, cultivating and passing the days. Brother Wang, since you return to Shandong, please take care of the Quanzhen Monastery affairs.” Yuyang replied, “Since Brother Ma does not return to Shandong, I will pass by Quanzhen Monastery. Though I will not manage affairs, I will inform everyone of Brother Ma’s whereabouts and appoint a new head to ensure stability.” At this, the group bade farewell to Jinbao, who tried hard to keep them, escorting them to the great gate. Each then went their separate ways, parting here. Hao Taigu withdrew to divination among the thickets, inviting travels across the land to guide the lost and cultivate the dao. Liu Changsheng remained among the fortune-tellers, concealing his light and refining body and mind. Tan Changzhen journeyed south.

Only Ma Danyang and Qiu Fuyang remained together in Qin Chuan’s Riqi Village, lodging in an ancient temple. Sharing a single mat, they sat in meditation. Danyang carefully instructed cultivation methods one by one, and Fuyang accepted them wholeheartedly. Danyang said, “Those who cultivate the dao must first eliminate the seven emotions. Without removing the seven emotions, the eight consciousnesses cannot return to the primordial. The primordial spirit unsettled, original nature dimmed, dao work unaccomplished. Once the seven emotions are removed, the six thieves self-extinguish. Without slaying the six thieves, the Five Phases cannot cluster. Primordial qi does not arise; the foundation of the elixir cannot be built. One must refine oneself thoroughly, so that the inner aspect does not emerge, nor the outer aspect enter. Outside, do not be bound by fame or profit; inside, do not be dragged by lust or desire. Purge all thoughts and delusions; naturally the nature of Heaven’s mandate will appear. Empty and await it; naturally one yang will return. Gather and refine it, forming a knife-like jade—this is called the Golden Elixir. If you fail to remove delusions, I cannot be your friend.” Fuyang respectfully obeyed and diligently practiced day and night. This is not recorded further.

Now after Wang Chongyang’s transcendence, beneath Junyi Bridge he discoursed on the mysteries, enticing the heart of Elder Zang; at Liu Jiang Creek he bestowed medicine, curing Lord Zhang’s illness. Sometimes he danced on the right side of Kunming Pond, sometimes chanted in the Zhongnan realm. His divine transformations were boundless, his spiritual communication unfathomable, beyond record. East Sea and Western Qin, he exhorted both Daoists and layfolk, everywhere saving people and accumulating merit.

Meanwhile, Wang Yuyang, having parted from his brothers, traveled over twenty days to the borders of Luoyang. Suddenly he recalled his senior brother Sun Buer, who once, by the master’s command, feigned madness to refine his nature in Luoyang. “Though I have followed the master for twenty years and heard the dao, I have not yet fully understood. I have heard that Sun Buer deeply grasps the master’s subtle meaning. I must seek him out—to report the master’s transcendence and to respectfully request the dao essentials.” Thus he journeyed on.

At the eastern gate of the city, he overheard people speaking of a madwoman’s whereabouts. Yuyang knew this must be Buer’s guise and asked, “Just now I heard the layfolk say, where does this madwoman live? Please point the way; I wish to see her.” An old man replied, “This madwoman has lived here for years, always begging alms nearby, and at night dwells in a broken kiln behind Yunxi Temple.” Yuyang asked, “Where is Yunxi Temple?” The old man said, “Just outside the northeast corner of the city, no more than two li away, a large temple it is.” Yuyang bade farewell to the crowd and set off toward Yunxi. Seeing evening approaching and his belly hungry, he stopped at a village to buy some steamed buns for alms. From afar he saw a great temple and knew this was Yunxi Temple. Approaching the temple, he saw the broken kiln behind it and went inside.

Sun Buer was then in the midst of regulating spirit and releasing the fetus. Having foreseen Yuyang’s arrival, she hurried out to greet him. Yuyang, upon seeing Buer, quickly bowed, saying, “Since we parted years ago, I have thought of you day and night. Now to see you again is like a parched fish meeting water—I cannot contain my joy.” Buer returned the greeting: “I am deeply grateful for your kindness in coming to see me. Pray tell, how are Master and our brothers?” Yuyang recounted the master’s transcendence, the funeral, the manifestations, and so forth in detail: “We parted at Chang’an; now Danyang and Fuyang are companions in Qin Chuan refining. Changzhen, Taigu, Changsheng have each wandered afar. I now intend to return to Shandong to visit my mother. Passing here, I thought of you, Brother Sun. One, to pay respects and congratulate your success; two, to beg your compassion to transmit the Golden Elixir formula, so I may never forget your kindness.” Having spoken, he prostrated himself. Buer hastened to detain him, saying, “Brother, no need for such humility. Since the master has transcended, and all brothers cultivate profound功, hearing your words that the Golden Elixir dao is not yet clear to you, how could we brothers withhold it? But I am now nourishing the fetus and releasing the spirit, and ask you to guard my quietude for one year. What say you?” Wang Yuyang replied, “Grateful for your support, Brother, I will guard your quietude and serve you.” Thus the two rested in the kiln.

At this time, Buer’s fetal yuan was firm; she no longer thought of food. Wang Yuyang went out to beg alms, and in leisure guarded the quiet. Moreover, Buer’s elixir dao returned to completion; the void itself had divine protection, naturally clearing inside and out. Using spirit regulation to release the fetus, gradually spiritual transformations occurred. After one year, the yang spirit appeared, freely emerging without hindrance, six penetrations attained, and insight into the future reversed.

One day she said to Yuyang, “Now my spirit is fully enlightened, and my profound功 complete. For more than a year, all thanks to your support, which I cannot repay. Now I will transmit to you the Golden Liquid and the Great Dao of the Elixir, to repay your kindness.” Yuyang quickly knelt. Buer helped him up and sat beside him, whispering the formulas one by one, instructing: “I now transmit to you the true secrets of refining the elixir, nourishing the fetus, spirit regulation and release, and all the fire-timing techniques. You must diligently cultivate, increase功 and accumulate merit, so that one day you will become true. But this dao must not be lightly given to the unworthy—be cautious! Brother, you may now go to Shandong, your fate lies at Mount Yu; choose a place and cultivate diligently. You may go now.” Yuyang bowed and said, “Having received your teaching, Brother, when shall I repay this debt?” Buer said, “Brother, go forth and cultivate diligently; when功 ripens, we shall meet again.” Escorting him outside the kiln, they parted.

Wang Yuyang bade farewell to Buer and headed for Shandong. Within less than a month, he arrived at Ninghai Quanzhen Monastery. The assembly came out to welcome him. Among them was a local named Cao Jiande, managing affairs at the monastery. Everyone asked about his journey. Yuyang greeted all and recounted the above events in detail. Hearing of the master’s divine transformations, all praised and rejoiced. Yuyang also told of Sun Buer’s guarding quietude and spirit release, and all acclaimed, “Truly a great man among women!”

Yuyang stayed three days at the monastery. Seeing all affairs settled, he said to the assembly, “I see Brother Cao managing well here, better than Danyang; I have no worries. I wish to visit my mother in Wendeng.” Jiande said, “Brother’s return home to visit mother is filial and proper; I dare not detain you. But you must go early and return soon, so we do not worry.” Yuyang replied, “With brothers here and your protection, the monastery will not lack residents. Besides, I intend to find a quiet place to live and cultivate for a few years. I now take leave; we shall meet again.” All accompanied him for a li beyond the mountain gate before turning back.

Wang Yuyang then journeyed to Wendeng County. Within days he reached his family home. Seeing the white mourning couplets on the door, he hurried inside. At the ancestral hall he saw the filial mourning shrine and knew his mother had passed. He bowed deeply and wept aloud. The household servants saw this and hurried inside to inform the master: “Outside is a wandering Daoist, bowing and weeping before the late lady’s spirit—who might he be?” The eldest brother hurried out and recognized him, embracing and weeping together. He said, “Since you left, mother waited daily for you. Later she fell ill and for over ten years never ceased longing for your return. On the thirteenth day of the second month this year, she passed away. Why did you leave for so long without word?” Yuyang said, “I left at mother’s bidding to seek masters and the dao. For years I sought everywhere, but only found false paths, no true transmission. Returning to Dengzhou, I met Master Chongyang, became his disciple, and served him diligently without pause. After the master’s ascension and funeral in Shaanxi, I intended to visit mother, but met Brother Sun and guarded quietude with him for over a year, finally receiving true transmission. Now I return to cultivate the wondrous dao with mother—how could I have expected her to have passed?” Having spoken, he wept bitterly, revived and wept again, for half a day. The eldest brother, feeling pity, came forward to comfort him: “Mother is gone and cannot return; your weeping to death would be in vain. I only hope you succeed in true fruition, so that even if mother dwells in the Nine Springs, she may be saved.” Hearing this, Yuyang ceased weeping. Family and relatives came to pay respects. Yuyang stayed at home to observe mourning, also nourishing dao and cultivating body and mind. His brother rejoiced greatly. This story is not further told.

Meanwhile, Danyang and Fuyang continued refining in Qin Chuan. Danyang was a long-cultivated adept; now his Golden Elixir was complete. No longer fearing wind, cold, heat, or damp; no longer worrying about water, fire, hunger, or famine. Now with Fuyang as companion, he strictly followed the master’s orders, intending only to save Fuyang. One night, lodging in a temple named Little Hua Temple near Huayin, a great snow fell from Heaven, covering the ground over three feet deep, making half a step impossible. The two were trapped in the temple, suffering unbearable hardship. Fuyang was hungry and cold. Though he struggled on, by the third night he could bear no more. A thought arose: “These days the great snow blocks all from begging alms. I am frozen and starving. If tomorrow someone would bring me some noodle soup, it would ease hunger and cold.” The moment this thought arose, it was as if a person truly focused on cultivating the dao. He hastened to kill the local earth dragon god. The temple’s earth god then appeared in a dream to a villager.

This man lived in Beizhuang of Huazhou, surname Zhang, styled Erlao. He was sixty years old, childless, and devoted to monks and Daoists. The earth god appeared in his dream, saying: “In the Little Hua Temple are two true immortals, trapped by snow, starving and suffering. Tomorrow morning, bring them some noodle soup and you will gain boundless blessings. Remember this upon waking; I, the god, depart!” Zhang Erlao awoke and told his mother: “I had a strange dream. An old man said: ‘In the temple are two true immortals, trapped by snow, starving and suffering.’ He told me to bring them noodle soup tomorrow morning to gain infinite blessings.” His mother said, “My dream was the same.” They agreed, “At dawn I will go to the temple to see clearly. You prepare noodle soup. If there are truly people, I will bring it; if not, we shall eat it ourselves.” His mother agreed.

At dawn, the two went out, walking through the snow. Upon reaching the temple, they saw two Daoist priests—one sitting with eyes closed in meditation, the other sleeping beside him. They hurried home and told the mother, who rejoiced greatly. Truly:

> Dao and virtue have no cause,  
> Cultivation depends on the person.  
> Without steadfast will and guarding,  
> How can one become a true immortal?

To know what befell Ma and Qiu, the two true immortals, await the next chapter’s unfolding.
