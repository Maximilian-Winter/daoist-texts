# Chapter Twelve: Qiu Fu and Yang Pan Crossing the Creek in Bitter Resolve — Sun Bu’er and the Three Wells Manifest Divine Power

Verse:

Two friends part ways, each tending their former causes.  
Six years in Pan Valley endure hardship and pain.  
Battling retreating sleep demons, tireless in spirit,  
With bitter resolve they cultivate their bodies.  
Truly fulfilled, they leave the red dust behind,  
A body beyond the body they now possess.  
Riding phoenix and crane, they pay homage to the Maple Throne.  
Feigning madness in practice, few can recognize them,  
Broadly ferrying lost souls across the bewildering ford.  
(Right tune: "Waves Washing Sand")

The story goes that the two elders Zhang returned home to inform their mother. The mother said, “These two must surely be great cultivators, secretly guarded by divine powers, hence they came to entrust dreams to you and me. Old one, take this bowl of noodles to them to eat. I see the snow has not yet melted these days; why not invite them to our home, wait for clear skies and the snow to vanish, then allow them to depart? Would it not be that you and I gain some blessing and grace thereby?” Zhang the elder heeded his mother’s words, took up the bucket of noodles, and brought it to the temple, calling out, “Two honored immortals, please accept this vegetarian meal.”

Fu Yang, hearing someone call for vegetarian food, hurriedly sat up and looked. He saw an old man holding a bucket of noodles standing nearby, and called to his senior brother. Dan Yang, gathering his spirit, heard the voice and opened his eyes to see the old man delivering the meal. The two quickly rose and bowed. The two elders set down the bucket and bowed deeply. After the two had finished their bows, the elder said, “These past days the heavens have sent such heavy snow, causing hardship to you two immortals. This poor old man has no fine offerings, but early this morning my mother made some noodle soup to offer you immortals against the cold.” Dan Yang replied, “We two are of thin fortune and shallow roots; how could we accept the offerings of an old benefactor? We dwell in the temple—how could a good person know of us?” Zhang the elder then recounted in detail the dream received last night. Dan Yang said, “We truly have no fortune to accept. Now, moved by the compassion of a good person, we must eat.” The two then ate the noodle soup.

Zhang the elder said, “You two immortals are here in this temple, but I see your garments are plain and your bodies chilled. Please come to this poor old man’s home to rest for a few days. When the skies clear and the snow melts, then you may continue your way.” Dan Yang said, “Having received the meal from a good person today, the kindness is beyond repay; we dare not accept more!” The elder said, “You two immortals need not be so modest. At my home, only my mother and I live—no elders or children besides. Moreover, we have always favored monks and Daoists. Though poor, we can support you two; even if for a month, it is manageable. Please come to my home; it is warmer than this temple, and I need not trouble myself to bring meals. Would that not be convenient for both?” Thus, the two listened to the good man’s words and reluctantly went to his home. The mother had long been watching and waiting; seeing the two Daoist masters arrive with the elder, she rejoiced greatly, prepared the kang bed, and welcomed them to rest. Three meals a day of tea and rice were served with earnest hospitality, constant as one.

The two rested for five days, watching the snow melt, then prepared to take their leave. The elder would not permit it. After urging, they stayed three more days. Dan Yang, seeing the elder’s great kindness, taught him the methods of guiding breath and extending life, then took leave and departed. The elder wished to keep them longer and made some steamed buns for them to take, but the two earnestly declined. Zhang the elder accompanied them two li on the road, then returned home. The elder couple cultivated the Way together and both lived beyond one hundred years, passing away peacefully without illness. But that is another story, not told here.

---

Meanwhile, Dan Yang and Fu Yang parted from Zhang the elder on the road. Dan Yang asked, “Brother Qiu, we froze and starved in that temple for three days, then a divine being came in a dream to his home—this is strange indeed. Could it be you harbored a deluded thought?” Fu Yang replied, “I will not hide it from you, senior brother. In the temple, starving and freezing for three days, my heart was truly hard to bear. I gave rise to a deluded thought: ‘If tomorrow someone brings me some noodle soup to eat, I could at least stave off hunger and cold.’ Who knew that secretly a divine being knew and went to the Zhang household to entrust the dream? I myself did not believe it.” Dan Yang angrily said, “I warned you before: those who cultivate the dao must not give rise to deluded thoughts. You now have stirred the void and the divine spirits, causing them to entrust dreams to that household. We have made no inch of progress day by day, yet receive such offerings—what merit do we have to accept? If I were to act as you do, I would become ox or horse to repay debts. Better we part ways now; I will return to Shandong to cultivate, and you may follow your own path to heaven or hell as you wish.”

Fu Yang heard Dan Yang’s words, and his heart was pierced as if by knives. Tears streamed from his eyes as he knelt before Dan Yang, weeping bitterly: “Since I came to the Quanzhen Abbey to seek the master, I was introduced and recommended by you, senior brother. For over twenty years following the master, I suffered many trials from demons but never received a word of instruction. Suddenly the master ascended to immortality. Now, by your mercy, you guide me on the true path. I have just heard the great Dao is rare and obscure; this kindness is beyond repayment. In the temple, starving and freezing, I gave rise to a deluded thought. I beg senior brother to open your heart and forgive my sins. I will not dare again.” Dan Yang said, “Your karmic roots are deeply heavy; trials from demons are inevitable. When the master manifested the meal, he said that though you have true resolve and cultivation, great demons are hard to escape. Changsheng also said you would later starve to death. Since you came with me, I have admonished you many times, but you have not listened. Now I must withdraw my spirit and return to Shandong. If you have true resolve to cultivate and perfect the dao fruit, we shall meet again. If your heart is not firm, once we part, you will not see me again.” Having spoken, he took from his side a small paper-cutting knife, split the meditation cushion in two, took half in hand, and headed east to Shandong. Fu Yang pleaded bitterly but said no word, drifting away.

After Dan Yang left, Fu Yang wept by the roadside for half a day before stopping. He thought, “My senior brother says I lack resolve and so parts from me. My master Liu once said my face bears the mark of the Soaring Serpent locking the mouth, and I am destined to starve to death. Now here I kneel on the earth, burning incense, beseeching Heaven, Earth, Sun, Moon, and the spirits of the void, making a solemn vow, leaving fate to Heaven.” He knelt on both knees and set a grand vow. A poem attests:

> Forget wine and lust, rid wealth and greed,  
> Ignorance arising casts one to the Three Paths.  
> Hoarding grain in secret breaks the heart,  
> Silently amassing silver withers the bones.  
> Selfish gain harms others, struck by lightning’s lash,  
> Defying master and dao, Heaven’s punishment descends.  
> If I do not guard my heart truly now,  
> Eternal kalpas I shall roam as horse or donkey.

Having sworn, he bowed to the void several times, then rose and set out toward Chang’an.

Meanwhile, the Venerable Lü Chunyang passed through Huazhou in the clouds. Seeing Chujī’s grand vow, fearing for his life, he sent protective divine attendants to accompany Chujī, so that in time he might perfect the dao fruit. From then on, Qiu Chujī was ever mindful, moment by moment. Whenever in difficulty, celestial spirits came to his aid.

Fu Yang arrived in Chang’an city and stayed several days. Weary of its bustle, he ascended Zhongnan Mountain. Seeing an ancient temple, he sat in meditation there. That night great snow fell, continuing five days without cease. Fu Yang thought, “Changsheng said I am destined to starve to death; now that time draws near. I have heard Dan Yang say that though one dies, if one embraces the dao and preserves spirit and nature unblemished, the next life will also seek the dao. I now gather spirit and guard breath, simply waiting.”

---

Meanwhile, the protective deity of the temple land took the form of a mortal that night and brought some steamed buns. At dawn, the earth deity appeared before Fu Yang with the buns, calling out, “Immortal, please accept this meal.” Fu Yang, deep in meditation, suddenly heard the call, opened his eyes, and saw an old man holding buns before him. He asked, “Good old man, I see this weather, heavy snow swirling—why do you come to this temple?” The earth deity said, “My home is near this village, not far from here. Last night I had a dream that an immortal here in this temple was starving and freezing, so I specially brought some buns to fill your hunger.” Having spoken, he placed the buns before Chujī and turned to leave. Fu Yang wished to ask his name, but the figure vanished from the temple. Rushing outside, he saw no trace—no footprints in the snow. Returning inside, he thought, “This old man must be the earth deity of this temple in disguise.” He ate some buns and thought, “I thought my time to starve was near, yet a divine being clearly manifested to send food. Could it be my yang life is not yet spent, and I am not to die?”

Two more days passed. When the skies cleared and snow melted, he descended the mountain and traveled west. Reaching the southern foot of Nan Mountain in Baoji county, there was a great creek named Pan Creek, over ten zhang wide. This was the main road to Chang’an. When the water rose, the current roared, and no bridge could be built; when the water receded, it was less than a chi deep, and rafts could not be used. Travelers all had to cross barefoot. Fu Yang thought, “My roots are shallow; how can I attain the dao? I will ferry people across this Pan Creek to accumulate merit and cultivate my foundation for the next life.” Resolute, whenever a person came, he called out, “Do not take off your feet; I will carry you across.” From then on, all travelers, regardless of age or gender, he carried on his back.

By the creek stood an ancient temple. Fu Yang ferried people by day and meditated in the temple by night. Nearby, kind people brought food to sustain him. Through bitter cold and hardship, he did not shirk labor. When floods and torrents came, he rested quietly in the temple. At night he would sometimes lose consciousness, dream troubled, and sit suspended on wood, battling sleep demons. Whenever he fell to the ground, he was unharmed—secretly protected by divine powers. When storms blocked the way and hunger nearly ended his life, help always arrived. Thus he diligently cultivated with no slackening; dying and reviving, he bore no fear. In the spring of the second year, once crossing the creek carrying a person, he was swept away by the water, drifting over twenty li. The Dragon King appeared and saved him, returning him to life. This only made him more courageous and diligent in cultivation.

Meanwhile, Ma Dan Yang, having parted from Chujī, returned to Ninghai in Shandong and resumed cultivation at Quanzhen Abbey. He saw that Li Dacheng of Shenyang, Zhao Penglai of Laizhou, Han Qingnan of Jiangnan, and Song Piyun of Haizhou all had deep roots and took them as disciples, teaching them the dao. Dan Yang relied on these four to guard his stillness for three years before he could transcend the body and spirit. He reflected that immortals never leave the mountains; though his spirit transformation was without form, transcending the heavenly gates, he ultimately returned to the blessed lands of grotto heavens, the ten continents and three isles. He composed twenty characters of poetry, naming it the Daily Tongshan School:

> From primordial origin comes true resolve,  
> Vitality and longevity form the immortal elixir.  
> Loyalty and tranquility bring rites and righteousness,  
> Clearly one sees the court of Heaven.

By this lineage and his writings—*Golden Jade*, *Gradual Awakening*, *Subtle Essence*, *Ten Directions*, *Three Treasures*, *Collected Sayings*—his teachings spread to later generations.

At this time Ma Dan Yang was seventy-one years old. In the fourth year of the Shaoxi reign of Emperor Guangzong of Song, that is the fourth year of the Mingchang reign of Emperor Zhangzong of Jin, the year of the Gui Chou, on the first day of the first month, he suddenly told his Daoist friends, “On the fourth day of this month, Sun Bu’er will return to the True, and I too shall depart now.” The crowd begged him to stay in the immortal carriage, to remain in the world for a few more years to guide later students on the path of cultivation. Dan Yang said, “From now on, Wang Yuyang will bring transformation on Mount Yu, Hao Taigu will spread the lineage on Mount Hua, Tan Changzhen will propagate teachings in the south, Qiu Chujī will teach and raise the great earth, Liu Changsheng will follow the mountain winds. In the future the great school will flourish. Those with aspiration will each establish great merit; the southern and northern lineages will stretch far, the eastern and western paths will be long. Rest where you please, walk whichever road you will. Cultivate and attain true fruit; one day we shall meet.” Then he left a verse and sat in transformation. The verse reads:

> Originally true emptiness,  
> Identical with the Great Void.  
> Today finally returns to the beginning,  
> Dwelling forever in the Palace of Penglai.

News quickly spread to the Ma family. Ting Zhen, with over ten family members, came to the abbey to mourn, urgently preparing a wooden coffin for burial and selecting an auspicious day for the funeral. On the day of the funeral, Song Piyun moved the coffin, which seemed empty. The crowd was amazed; opening it, only clothes and shoes remained. Joyfully they knew he had transformed away. They buried the coffin and garments to honor kinship. The abbey’s affairs are not told here.

Meanwhile, after Wang Yuyang’s passing, Sun Bu’er’s spirit transformation was without form, mysterious and unpredictable. In Luoyang city many good people saw that though Bu’er seemed mad and wild, he appeared to have the dao. His words on fortune and misfortune all came true, and many men and women later came to revere him as master. He left twenty characters of poetry, founding the Qingjing School. The poem reads:

> Quanzhen penetrates profound principle,  
> The great Dao attains non-action.  
> Nature merges with the grey corpse’s release,  
> Only this hundred efforts.

Bu’er was seventy-five years old. On the fourth day of the first month of Gui Chou year, he suddenly told his disciples, “The master’s true command calls me to the Jade Pool.” The disciples bowed and begged him to stay, but Bu’er said, “Heaven’s decree is fixed and cannot be disobeyed.”

---

Meanwhile, the Immortal Lady Geng often appeared in her original form after Sun Bu’er’s attainment, lingering and coming and going with Bu’er. Now knowing Bu’er’s cultivation was complete and he had returned to the True, she came to invite him to the Jade Pool, then to return to the mortal realm to accumulate merit. By this time Dan Yang had arrived. Bu’er knew Dan Yang had transcended form and said, “Now he comes to invite me to see the true master.” The three immortals manifested, each mounting a white crane, soaring through the kiln’s roof and out, circling and dancing in the sky. People saw this and hurried to inform the prefectural lady. The prefect’s magistrate quickly arranged incense tables, presented offerings, and held gold and jade in tribute, praying toward the sky. Suddenly the three immortals each descended on white cranes, clouds swirling, circling above the government office. Officials, soldiers, and commoners all saw clearly and bowed down. Bu’er left a poem:

> Spirit soaring through azure skies,  
> Power lingers in the mortal world to receive the rare.  
> Foolish disciples do not recognize the guest of mist and clouds,  
> Ten thousand taels of gold, I am too lazy to bow.

Having finished the chant, the cloud cranes slowly ascended to Heaven and departed. All present were full of earnest prayer. The magistrate inspected the ground and saw three kiln holes shaped like wells, naming them the Three Wells Grotto. Inside were statues of the three immortal sages, with incense burning unceasing through the generations. But that tale is not told here.

---

Meanwhile, the three immortals Ma, Sun, and Geng each rode white cranes to the True Grotto of Zhongnan’s Pole. At that time, Chongyang and Patriarch Zhong were out traveling, only Patriarch Lü remained in the grotto. The three immortals bowed to Lü, who rejoiced and ordered the cloud kitchen to prepare a feast. Dan Yang recounted his and Bu’er’s cultivation story. Lü said, “Your dao achievements are high, but your external功 are not broad; thus you cannot yet respond to the summons. You must establish greater功, waiting until the Seven True Ones gather, then all proceed to the Jade Palace. Only功 is honored in the heavenly registers;功 not broad, dao though high, ranks lower. Cultivators, like worldly men, though talented as the Northern Dipper and strong as Mount Tai, cannot receive salary without功. So too with immortals. Those with high功, though dao insufficient, ascend the upper realms. Those with high dao but no功 become scattered immortals of the Peng Isles.” Hearing this, Dan Yang and the others bowed farewell to Lü and returned to the mortal realm to accumulate功. Lü saw them out the grotto gate; the three immortals took leave and rode their cranes away. It is truly:

> Without功, dao cannot endure long;  
> Without dao,功 is insufficient for immortality.  
> Dao complete and功 high bring spirit transformation,  
> Surely one will soon step into Jade Heaven.

To learn of the three immortals’ later affairs, listen to the next chapter unfold.
