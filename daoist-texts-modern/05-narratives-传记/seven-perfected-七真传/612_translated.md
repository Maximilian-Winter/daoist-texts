# Chapter Thirteen: Wang Chuyi Performs Daoist Arts in the Imperial Prison — Qiu Changchun Saves a Maiden on the Long Plateau

**Verse:**

The alchemical scripture fades, the numinous secret is obscure,  
How many true aspirants find the dao hard to grasp?  
Time hastens, a candle before the wind,  
The throat’s breath breaks—golden life cannot be prolonged.  
Poison, poison, poison!  
Urgently must one refine, tireless in the moment,  
When功 is perfected, hasten to the Peach Banquet.  
Enter the grotto heavens, meet the assembled immortals,  
Carefree and joyous, leaping beyond three thousand realms.  
Sweet, sweet, sweet!  
*(Right tune: “Phoenix Hairpin”)*

The tale begins with the three immortals Sun, Ma, and Geng each riding white cranes, departing from Zhongnan Mountain, each taking separate paths to accumulate功 through diligent progress. Their journeys are not recounted here.

In the autumn of the year of the Gui Chou, the Song Emperor decreed that Zhu Xi be assigned to govern Tanzhou. The Shou Emperor fell ill; the Prime Minister Liu Zheng led the ministers to petition the Emperor to inquire after his health. The Emperor refused, and the ministers all wept bitterly as they withdrew.

In the summer of the year of the Jia Yin, the Shou Emperor passed away. The Emperor, citing illness, declined to appear, and Liu Zheng feigned sickness to escape. The Emperor, while presiding over court, suddenly collapsed and died. The Grand Secretary Zhao Ruyu and others petitioned the Empress Dowager to issue an edict appointing Prince Jia, the third son of Emperor Guangzong, who then donned mourning robes and ascended the throne as Emperor Ningzong. Ruyu requested the return of Liu Zheng, who installed Consort Han as Empress and made Ruyu the Right Prime Minister.

In the year of the Yi Mao, the era name changed to Qingyuan. The Empress Dowager’s maternal uncle, Tuo Zhou, wielded power, suppressing upright scholars and promoting the wicked. He placed officials in the Court of Judicial Review. Lü Zujian was in Shaozhou; his cousin Zu Gong, a commoner, impeached Tuo Zhou. The brothers were famed for their loyalty and righteousness. In the tenth month, Ruyu was exiled to Yongzhou, and upon reaching Hengzhou, he suddenly died.

In the year of the Bing Chen, the Jin dynasty changed its era name to Cheng’an. The Song appointed Jing Tang as Right Prime Minister. Ye Zhu and Ni Si, who oversaw the imperial examinations, dismissed those with partial understanding of righteousness and principle. Zhu Xi was stripped of office, and Cai Yuanding was exiled to Daozhou. Cai Yuanding was a friend of Zhu Xi and traveled with his son Shen for over a year on the road. Suddenly, Cai said to Shen, “It is time to bid farewell to the world; I wish to return to tranquility and follow the course of creation.” Three days later, he died. Later he was honored as Master of the Western Mountain.

In the year of the Ding Si, false teachings were registered, and Liu Zheng, Zhu Xi, and fifty-seven others all wrote books.

Now, Wang Yuyang had completed three full years of filial mourning at home. He bade farewell to his elder brother and sister-in-law and left the mountain to cultivate功. His brother Xiaoqian earnestly urged him, “Since you have resolved to pursue the dao, why leave the mountain? Stay home to nurture stillness for a few more years. Your sister-in-law and you can guard quietude together—would that not be splendid?” Wang Yuyang replied, “I am an unfilial and unrighteous man. If I do not respect and obey my brother and sister-in-law at home, yet seek peace by leaving, I fail to assist my brother and lose human decency. Moreover, to idle at home would burden my sister-in-law. This I cannot bear.” Xiaoqian urged him repeatedly, but Wang Yuyang was resolute. Xiaoqian, helpless, went to his room, took out two hundred taels of silver, and handed it to Yuyang, saying, “Since you insist on leaving home, I have no choice. Take this two hundred taels as your dao capital.” Yuyang earnestly declined but accepted one hundred taels, then tearfully bade farewell. Xiaoqian accompanied him three li, weeping bitterly. Wang Yuyang parted with tears, reluctant and sorrowful, then sadly departed. Xiaoqian stood by the roadside until his brother disappeared, then returned home.

Wang Yuyang left his brother and traveled to the borders of Ninghai, where he saw Mount Yu rising with elegant spirit. Recalling Sun Buer’s words that his destiny lay on Mount Yu, he ascended the mountain to seek it. There he found a stone chamber, serene and refined, with the words “Cloud Radiance Grotto Heaven” carved above. Wang Yuyang took residence there to cultivate. After several months, by the grace of his guardian spirits and natural protection, several virtuous seekers came to visit. Wang Yuyang accepted them as disciples, his guardian spirits accompanying him. He then began earnest practice, refining for three years until the Golden Elixir was formed and his yang spirit appeared. He further practiced the art of refining emptiness and harmonizing with the dao for three more years, achieving divine transformations, appearing and vanishing at will, wondrous and unfathomable. He wrote a collection titled *Cloud Radiance Anthology* and established forty lineage characters called the Yu Mountain Sect, passed down to later generations:

> The dao of pure stillness and non-action,  
> Sincere and true in nature and name.  
> Skillful in the work of gold and jade,  
> Mastery here grants earthly immortals.  
> The profound doctrine of the mysterious void’s virtue,  
> Flourishing teachings grand and primal.  
> The true method of harmony eternal,  
> Wisdom preserves the spirit whole.

At that time, the Jin ruler heard that Wang Chuyi of Dongmu possessed the dao and sent envoys to invite him. Chuyi responded to the summons and arrived at Yan. The Jin ruler tested his arts by placing a gecko beneath a basin and asked what was inside. Yuyang said:

> Like a tiger but not a tiger, like a snake but not a snake.  
> Four feet, long tail, making the wall its home.

The Emperor then covered it with a coin and asked again. Chuyi said:

> Round outside, square inside, shining when seen.  
> Called the supreme treasure by men, deeply hidden, not to be revealed.

The Emperor was deeply convinced. Jealous rivals offered him poisoned wine, but he did not die. Taking leave, he traveled widely, performing功, saving people, banishing ghosts, wielding talismans to rescue from calamity.

Arriving beneath Mount Tai of the Eastern Peak, he saw a great stone blocking the road. Raising his iron whip, he unleashed his wisdom power, shattering the stone to clear the path. Passersby recognized him as a divine immortal and bowed deeply. The True Man flicked his sleeve and went on.

At the northern city of Hanjun, he saw a severe drought and rampant disorder among the people. Knowing that beneath Mount Sumen was a great spring source, he commanded people to dig, uncovering a vast spring that irrigated hundreds of li, blessing the common folk. He healed invisibly, saved people in peril, then withdrew to Zhongtiao Mountain, standing alone on a perilous cliff for nine years, awaiting the summons to ascend. This is not further told.

Meanwhile, Qiu Chujing was at Panxi, accumulating功 by day and meditating by night. Over six years, he refined body and mind, died seven times and revived. He suffered countless minor deaths battling demons, unknown in number. Resolute in苦修, he repelled the sleep demons. Though afflicted by some demons, his heart remained clear in the dao, calling himself the Master of Longspring. In leisure, he wrote a collection titled *Panxi Dao Awakening Anthology*, circulated in the world.

One day, the three True Officials of the Three Origins—Tang, Ge, and Zhou—rode clouds past Panxi. Seeing a white light shooting to the sky above Qiu Chujing’s head, they knew his功 was complete and his fate lay at Dragon Gate. The Three Officials transformed into three constables, each bearing three human heads on their shoulders, and waded barefoot across the water at Panxi. Longspring saw them and said, “You three need not remove your feet. I will carry you across.” The Three Officials said, “We have three heads here; how can you carry us?” Longspring said, “Let me send these three heads ahead, then I can carry you.” They said, “These heads are vital; not one can be lost. If even one is lost, our lives are at stake. We must be careful!” Longspring said, “Rest assured, I have carried them for six years and never lost a thing.” He sent the three heads across the stream, hanging them on a tree branch, then returned to carry the men.

Crossing the stream, a great eagle swooped down and snatched one head. Longspring was terrified. The Three Officials feigned alarm and said, “I warned you the heads are precious and none may be lost. Now the hungry eagle has taken one, endangering our lives. That head belonged to a notorious bandit who betrayed his superiors. Without it, even our three lives are in jeopardy.” Hearing this, Longspring could not bear it and asked, “Can another’s head substitute?” They said, “When a person dies, their appearance changes; another’s head can substitute. But where would we find another’s head now?” Longspring said, “If another’s can substitute, I have knives—cut off my head to replace it.” They said, “Since you are willing to sacrifice yourself, no need to kill your head. We will accompany you to meet the superiors and explain that a cultivator lost a head while carrying us across the water. If the superiors show mercy, you may be spared death.” Longspring said, “If so, come with me to the temple. I will cook rice and we will eat our fill before setting out for Chang’an.” The Three Officials agreed.

The four entered the temple. The Three Officials sat; Longspring hurried to boil tea and prepare food. Seeing them transform into celestial beings, he bowed deeply, pleading for salvation. The Three Officials said, “We are none other than Tang, Ge, and Zhou, True Officials of the Three Origins. Seeing you practice功 here for six years, your功 is sufficient. You are willing to sacrifice yourself for our heads; your nature is pure and sincere. Your fate lies at Longmen Cave in Longzhou. There you will quietly refine the inner elixir. When your inner elixir is complete, you will travel and save others. When your功 is fulfilled, you will ascend the Golden Palace and meet us.” Saying this, they vanished on the wind.

Longspring looked to the sky and bowed in thanks, then packed to journey to Longzhou. Along the way, he gave alms. Arriving at Mingjiao’s slope near Zijia Post in Longzhou, he stayed overnight in an ancient temple, meditating amid continuous rain that made travel impossible.

In this post lived a wealthy man named Wang Cunfu, with a fortune of millions and dozens of family members. Wang Cunfu was hot-tempered and cruel, never aiding the poor and miserable, but instead insulting them harshly. Whenever monks or Daoists came to seek alms, he always drove them away with beatings and curses. The local villagers nicknamed him “Heaven Does Not Forgive.” His household was rebuilding a house with over one hundred workers. Before meals, they struck a resonant stone as a signal.

Longspring, meditating in the temple, grew hungry and heard the stone struck. Taking a melon ladle, he went to Wang’s gate to offer alms. The workers, seeing a master seeking alms, gave him some bread. But Wang Cunfu saw this, rushed out, beat and scolded Longspring, seized the bread, and threw it to the dogs. Longspring bowed apologetically without anger and returned to the temple to nurture stillness.

Wang’s household had a maid named Li Chunhua, twenty years old, with a latent root of cultivation. That day, seeing her master beat and scold a Daoist and seize his bread for the dogs, yet the Daoist smiled and apologized, she recognized him as a man of dao. Knowing he was trapped by rain in the temple, she secretly sent him some bread to stave off hunger. This is not further told.

Meanwhile, the official on duty early reported Wang Cunfu’s great evil deeds and his mistreatment of the virtuous man, seizing bread to feed dogs, to the Heavenly Court. The Jade Emperor then commanded the Wind Earl, Rain Master, Thunder Department, and Dragon Kings to instruct the Celestial Master to proclaim the imperial decree:

> “Wang Cunfu of Longzhou, full of evil deeds, with vast wealth, has not performed a single act of goodness for generations. Now he abuses a man of dao, seizing food to feed dogs. His crime is grave and he shall suffer a water calamity. However, one maid in his house, Li Chunhua, has a predestined root of immortality. Because of her prior good deeds, she shall not suffer this calamity. No mistake shall befall her!”

The Thunder God and Rain Department received the decree and sent the Wild Dream Spirit to Wang’s household to dream-visit Li Chunhua:

> “Your master’s evil is great. Tomorrow at the hour of the dragon, he will suffer a water calamity. Because of your good roots, you are exempt. At the hour of the tiger, go to the temple and seek the Daoist; he will save you. Remember this upon waking. I depart.”

Chunhua awoke, knowing it was but a southern branch dream. Reflecting on the words, she found them neither fully false nor fully true. She rose early, waited for dawn, and went to the temple. Seeing the master sitting on a mat, she knelt and said, “I am Li Chunhua, a maid of Wang’s house. I beg Master to save my life. I will never forget this great kindness.” Longspring opened his eyes, saw Chunhua kneeling, helped her up, and asked her story. Chunhua related the dream in detail. Longspring hurried outside and saw dark clouds gathering. He could not bear the thought of the workers suffering calamity and took Chunhua to the worksite, warning the workers to flee quickly. The workers believed him and escaped. Longspring took Chunhua up to the southern mountain, five li away, where they hid in a rocky cave. Suddenly thunder roared, lightning flashed, rain poured in torrents, wild winds rose, and black mists spread. After about an hour, the wind ceased, rain stopped, mist cleared, and clouds dispersed. Wang’s house was left a desolate ruin; all its people had gone to Fusang.

Longspring said to Chunhua, “Your master committed a crime against Heaven and thus suffered this calamity. Because of your good roots, your life was spared. This shows Heaven’s utmost impartiality and perfect justice—truly to be believed. Yet dozens of his family perished in an instant, alas, how grievous!” The two mourned deeply.

Chunhua knelt and wailed, “Now I have been saved by Master and escaped death. You are my rebirth parents; how can I ever repay such great kindness?” Longspring asked, “Have you now seen through worldly attachments?” Chunhua replied, “I lost my father young and my mother at seven. Because of poverty and no support, my uncle sold me for ten taels of silver to bury my mother. I have served Wang’s house as a maid for thirteen years. Morning and evening I longed for the dao but could not escape. What else could I do? My life was spared by the dream spirit’s guidance to seek Master’s help. Now seeing Wang’s house vanish with all its people and riches, where is glory and wealth? I see the red dust as illusion, love and hate as dreams. Why should I cling? I beg Master to save me and grant grace upon grace; I shall never forget.” Hearing this, Longspring knew she had a good root and resolved to guide her. He said, “Since you have true heart to cultivate dao but lack training and are female, you risk demon affliction. Come with me to Dragon Gate and take a walk.” Chunhua kowtowed and said, “I obey Master’s command without hesitation.”

Thus Longspring took Chunhua to Dragon Gate Cave. Along the way, he gave alms. After several days, they arrived. From afar, they saw the mountain and water serene and secluded, a wondrous sight:

> Horses neigh, apes cry, mountain ridges shake the heavens;  
> Peach blossoms red, willows green, pheasant chicks compete by the ravine.  
> Shepherd boys joyfully play wild flutes, their notes piercing the skies;  
> Woodcutters sing wild songs, their voices heard in clouded valleys.  
> Green trees cast dense shade; magpies and hawks vie in graceful dance;  
> Spring’s brilliance shines; foxes race, their feet pattering.  
> Rare herbs and strange flowers perfume the air—truly a blessed land of Longxi;  
> Purple mists and colorful clouds spread, worthy of Zhongnan’s grotto heavens.  
> The brushwood gate blocks worldly dust afar,  
> Winding paths deep and secluded, human traces rare.

The two walked and observed, asking along the way, until they reached Dragon Gate Cave. Longspring looked up and saw the cave indeed serene and elegant, about seven or eight li from human dwellings, sparsely visited—just right for cultivating dao. Together with Chunhua, he lived there, begging alms by day in the village, and nurturing stillness in the cave by night. One morning he said to Chunhua:

“Leaving the world is easy, but cultivating the body is hardest. You are female, with the five leaks of the body, unlike men. Fortunately, you have not lost your chastity; the Golden Elixir is easier to form. But leaving the world depends on cultivating the body. To cultivate the body, one must refine the nature. If the nature is impure, the life foundation cannot be established. To refine nature, first eliminate the seven emotions, then cut off the six thieves. The seven emotions are joy, anger, sorrow, pleasure, greed, love, and hatred; the six thieves are the eyes, ears, nose, tongue, heart, and mind. The eyes must not behold the five colors, lest they blind the eyes; instead, turn inward to reflect, preserving the spirit. The ears must not hear the five tones, but listen in the void, where true water condenses. The nose must not smell the five fragrances, so the primordial qi is undisturbed and the true breath balanced. The tongue must not taste the five flavors, licking the upper palate, so the primordial qi rises. The heart must not cling to myriad attachments, so the primordial spirit is calm and wisdom arises. The mind must not dwell on falsehoods, so body and mind rest in ease. Without craving fame or profit, the six thieves vanish, the six desires do not arise, the three poisons are extinguished. When the seven emotions are removed, nature and wisdom are complete; when nature and wisdom are complete, the light of wisdom shines. The art of cultivating life is attained, and the dao of longevity and eternal life is fulfilled. Once the dao of longevity is attained, the Golden Liquid and Elixir are not far off.”

Truly:

> The dao’s essence is non-action, natural law;  
> Dusty hearts cleansed, return to primordial.  
> Refining the original nature bright as the moon,  
> One may become an immortal of Penglai and Langyuan.
