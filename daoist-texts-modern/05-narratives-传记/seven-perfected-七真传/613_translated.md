# Chapter Fourteen: Qiu Chuji Attains the Dao and Transforms the Barbarian Lands; Tan Changzhen Emerges Divine to Exorcise Demons

A Poem:

The Ninefold Elixir perfected, one returns to the Great Void,  
Pure and radiant, original nature is true thus.  
The yang spirit freely enters and leaves the body unbound,  
At will wandering carefree, delight overflows.  
Westward transforming the barbarians, hailed as Dawn’s domain,  
Eastward roaming myriad lands, learning from Huaxu’s dream.  
Square by square, guiding cultivators,  
Together journeying to Penglai and the Orchid Pavilion’s abode.

Now it happened that Qiu Changchun imparted the art of firm foundation and eternal life to Li Chunhua. They dwelt together for several months—by day fasting or gathering herbs; by evening discoursing on the dao or nourishing the spirit. Because man and woman lived together, fearing to stir confusion among the folk, he had Chunhua feign madness, wandering the countryside to gather alms, tempering body and mind. Chunhua bowed farewell to his master and descended the mountain.

Each day, Changchun rose early and retired late, fixing his alchemy with seven families, living by fate without concern for abundance or lack, following convenience. After several months, he sighed, saying, “Time flies swiftly, the dao’s work is hard to complete. To cultivate the Golden Liquid Reverted Elixir, one must rely on method, wealth, companions, and place. Now method and place are obtained, but wealth and companions are lacking—difficult to begin the work.”

While pondering thus, a man appeared, no more than thirty years old, with a broad forehead and wide eyebrows, a commanding presence, spirit extraordinary. Changchun thought secretly, “If this man would join my mysterious gate, he would surely become a pillar in the midst.” The man entered the cavern, bowed to Changchun as disciple, prostrating deeply. Changchun hastened to return the bow, saying, “Sir, you mistake! This poor Daoist sees you as a Confucian disciple—why raise such great ceremony? Is it not excessive?” The man replied, “Master need not be so modest. I come seeking the dao. Before arriving, from afar I saw this cavern wrapped in colored clouds, white vapor soaring to the heavens. Now seeing your eyes bright with spirit, I know you are no ordinary man, and so I come to serve as disciple. I beg your mercy to accept me, guide me from confusion, that I may never forget your grace.” Changchun asked, “From what place do you hail? Your noble surname and given name? And why come here?” The man answered, “I am Zhao, named Yuantong, from Xinye County, Nanyang Prefecture, Henan. From youth I studied poetry and books, abiding by Confucian rites; villagers call me ‘the ancient one.’ Yet I love the dao’s scriptures, not the fame of Confucianism. My father and brothers say I am a rotten Confucian. Seeing fame and profit as vanity, the red dust cold and indifferent, glory and wealth but a dream of a southern branch, time fleeting, momentary and unstable, I abandoned home to seek the dao, striving earnestly for the mysterious. If by your grace you pity and save me, it would be a blessing for a thousand lives.”

Changchun said, “Hearing your words, your heart truly leaves the world to study the dao. I have one thing to say—will you hear it?” Yuantong said, “Master speaks, I shall obey.” Changchun said, “This morning I was pondering. You say: ‘To cultivate the supreme mysterious功 (gong), one must rely on method, wealth, companions, and place.’ Now I have method and place, but wealth and companions are incomplete. Fortunate to meet you—can you help me complete the elixir?” Yuantong replied, “Now that Master shows mercy and accepts me, protecting you is my duty.” Changchun said, “If so, burn incense and bow to the Patriarch. I will rename you Daojian, styled Xujing.” Yuantong burned incense and held candles, bowed to the Patriarch, then before his master eight times. Then he took out two hundred taels of silver, handing it to Changchun: “This silver is for you to make a dao foundation.” Changchun said, “One who leaves the world should not covet wealth nor love beauty. Now you truly protect me—this is the same.” He accepted the silver. Thus with wealth and companions supporting, internal功 advanced day by day.

Zhao Xujing saw his master single-minded in cultivation and took up true resolve to protect the dao, never leaving his side. Good Daoists from Longzhou, hearing of Changchun’s way, all came to follow and support him—some bringing grain, some vegetables, some chopping wood, some carrying water. Changchun refined the inner elixir for several months; the great medicine was about to be perfected.

One day, a local commander came to the cavern to offer a feast, inviting the master to speak on the dao and virtue. Changchun reluctantly lingered with him for half a day. That night, mercury fled and lead flew, the elixir lost, all previous功 wasted. The next day he told his disciples, “When you labor hereafter, you must be cautious and vigilant. My great medicine was near completion, but yesterday I lingered half a day with the commander, disrupting my inner功. Last night the elixir vanished without a trace, all功 abandoned. Is it not sorrowful? When you come to this realm, you must be careful. The dao cannot be left even for a moment. If it can be left, it is not the dao.”

Changchun began anew, ever watchful. After three months of cooking and refining, the great medicine was finally accomplished. He then practiced the grand circulation of the Great Perfection, refining the Golden Liquid Reverted Elixir. Ten months gestating the embryo, three years nursing it. While in quiet meditation within the cavern, suddenly he saw mountains collapse and rocks tumble, yet his mind did not waver. He saw offerings of wealth and food, but accepted not a whit. He saw beauties and fine things, yet clung not at all. All manner of strange transformations and myriad illusions, he remained unstained and unattached. He saw tigers, wolves, snakes, and insects, yet was neither startled nor afraid. Only then did the yang spirit appear.

---

The master said to the assembly, “For all who cultivate the dao, when功 reaches this stage, many demonic obstructions arise—you must be vigilant. Sometimes Heaven sends trials to test the dao path; sometimes fox demons, goblins, mountain spirits, and stone monsters consume spirit energy; sometimes resentments from past lives and karmic entanglements of this life cling unyielding; sometimes yin demons cause dreams and confusion; sometimes yang demons afflict kin and family. No matter the myriad illusions or ten thousand transformations and temptations, do not cling to a single one. If you do, the great dao will not be attained. As the saying goes, ‘The dao rises one foot, the demon rises ten.’ Each time the demon passes, my heart grows clearer; ten times, tenfold clearer. I warn later students: when the demonic realm comes, you must be cautious!”

Qiu Changchun cultivated in the Dragon Gate Cavern for seven years, diligent without slackening, seeking mystery in stillness, creating something from nothing, unburdened by worldly dust and passion, unafraid of cold or heat. Carefree, forgetting years, awakening to the dao—how could he know spring or autumn? Still fearing the yang spirit’s aging, he applied three more years of great stabilization, silently nurturing the primordial spirit, finally perfecting form and spirit, merging with the true dao.

At this time, Li Chunhua also came seeking the dao. The master taught him the way, instructing, “I now rename you Zhen Duo. I impart to you the dao of the Golden Liquid Reverted Elixir. Be cautious and diligent; the elixir path can be completed. When功 is full and fruit ripe, you must add external功 to cultivate. When the dao fruit and功 are complete, we shall meet again. But this dao must not be passed to the unworthy, lest it bring great calamity. Be careful, be cautious!” Li Zhen Duo bowed thanks and departed, later attaining the dao fruit. Not detailed here. Changchun then passed on the art of longevity and eternal life to Zhao Xujing. At this time, a man from Longxi, surnamed Song, named Dao’an, also received the true master’s teaching.

The true master wished to roam westward among many lands, to save the lost and accumulate功 awaiting summons. He thus composed a single regulated verse:

Cultivate the self, choosing neither fool nor sage,  
Only heart sincere and will steadfast engage.  
Cut desires, remove attachments, walk dao and virtue’s way,  
Benefit others, harm none, learn the immortal’s sway.  
Six years in the curled valley, a thousand demons gone,  
Seven years at Dragon Gate, myriad practices done.  
Await the elixir scripture’s imperial decree,  
Then mount the crane to jade heavens free.

Having chanted, he instructed his disciples, “I now journey westward through many lands, to save all beings. You must diligently cultivate, never disobey my instructions.” The disciples knelt to see him off, begging for a return date. The master said, “This westward journey has no fixed return. When you smell the incense breeze from the west, that will be my return.” With that, he took a small shovel in hand, a mat on his back, descended the mountain, and went west. The disciples accompanied him for ten li before returning.

Zhao Xujing, seeing his master depart westward, cultivated virtue diligently, strictly observing the pure rules, gathering alms to build a dwelling. Within a few years, the Dragon Gate Cavern was transformed into an immortal’s palace of jade. This matter is not detailed.

As for Tan Changzhen, after parting with his brothers in Xianyang, he traveled west to Shu. Along the way, he gathered alms for over two months before entering Chengdu. One day, walking the street, he saw a mad woman coming. Changzhen recognized her as a person of the dao and hurried to salute. The mad woman raised her hand and struck him with a fist, knocking him to the ground, breaking two front teeth, blood pouring from his mouth. Changzhen rose, repeatedly apologizing, without anger. The mad woman laughed, “One punch drives away many past lives’ sins. We shall meet again; your true attainment is near.” She clasped her hands and left.

Readers may wonder who this mad woman truly was; it must be explained. She was none other than the immortal who had attained the Way with Yu Chan, having parted from Zhongyang, roaming to accumulate功 and guide the lost. At that time, passing through Emei and Qingcheng regions, she came to Chengdu. Seeing Tan Changzhen, knowing him as Zhongyang’s disciple, she struck him to test his nature and功. Seeing him lose two teeth yet bear no anger, she knew this youth would surely attain the great dao, and thus left a verse to be continued when Changzhen attains the dao. Passersby saw Changzhen struck by the mad woman, teeth broken, and rushed forward to bow and apologize. Not knowing the mad woman was an immortal, they all called Changzhen a Buddha, praising him endlessly.

In Chengdu city, Changzhen once wandered to the northeast corner and found an ancient temple, quiet and serene. He sat in meditation there, cultivating功. Many faithful and kind-hearted people in the city, seeing him at the temple, sometimes brought a meal after a day’s alms, sometimes after several days a visit, sensing his dao presence, often gave money and rice to protect his practice. Changzhen wished to refine a great elixir; though protected externally and never lacking money or rice, he lacked sincere companions and protectors within, making it difficult to begin the work.

One day, suddenly a young scholar came forward to pay respects and seek the dao, wishing to become a disciple. He was Li Henian, from Mianzhu in northern Sichuan, from a family of schoolmasters. Henian was quiet from youth, disliking bustle, abiding by filial and fraternal duties, fond of reading elixir scriptures. At twenty-four, unmarried and frugal, single-hearted in dao study, he toured Qingcheng seeking the dao but found no wayfarers. Coming to Chengdu, he heard talk of a daoist in the ancient Guan Di temple in the east city who was said to have the dao. He found the temple, saw Changzhen’s dao aura, and wished to leave the world. Changzhen saw his sincerity and accepted him as disciple.

Soon after, another came to join—Zhang Shoudao from Chengzhou, thirty-two years old, selling salt near Liugong Well in eastern Sichuan, already intent on leaving the mundane. Traveling in Chengdu, seeing the master’s dao, he took Changzhen as teacher. Changzhen renamed him Daoqing, and renamed Li Henian Daojing.

With two disciples protecting him, Changzhen began his功. After three years, the embryo was full, spirit emerged, adjusting spirit and transformations, wondrous and unfathomable, a body outside the body. One day, going out to talk dao and virtue with guests, disciples marveled: “Our master has rested three years without going out—why now speak with guests?” Returning inside, they saw the master sitting on the elixir bed. Rushing out to look, outside was another master. Zhang Daoqing invited all to see; it was the same. They dared not question. After guests left, seeing the master send them out the door, suddenly he vanished. Returning inside, they asked the master. Changzhen said, “The great dao returns complete; spirit transformations appear and vanish at will. The one outside is my spirit. When the dao is high, one body transforms into many, pervading the Ten Directions, manifesting and hiding—not just one person alone.” The disciples then understood the master’s yang spirit went out, body outside the body, and praised him. Not detailed further.

Meanwhile, the Chengdu prefect Yan Bangfu had a son, Yan Yan, bewitched by a fox spirit, long ill and incurable by all means. Hearing that the ancient Guan Di temple’s Tan Daoist had the dao, the prefect personally went to the temple, lit incense, and invited Tan Xian to exorcise the demon. Changzhen had Zhang Daoqing accompany him to linger, then sat in meditation a while, writing two talismans which he gave to Yan Bangfu: “Sir, take these two talismans—one to paste above the door, one for your son to wear on his head. After forty-nine days, this demon will never dare return. Burn the talismans and have your son take the ashes; not only will it expel evil and repel spirits, but also cure illness and prolong life.” Bangfu said, “If my son’s demon is gone and illness healed, I will have him join the immortal master’s gate. This prefecture will protect you and rebuild this ancient temple.” He took the talismans back to the office. Changzhen saw him off at the mountain gate. Not detailed further.

Back at the office, family reported, “Shortly after you left today, a daoist arrived claiming to catch a demon for your son. Asked his name and residence, he said you invited him, so you must know. He went to your son’s room and struck a thunderclap. Suddenly a fox ran out of the room. The daoist chased it out, and the fox vanished without trace. This is strange!” The prefect wondered, “Could this be Tan Xian manifesting? Truly very strange!” He placed the two talismans as instructed, and indeed the demon was expelled and illness healed. Not detailed further.

---

That day when Bangfu came to the temple to plead with Tan Xian, the master sent forth his yang spirit, arriving early at the prefecture to strike a palm thunderclap. The fox demon fled in fright. Later the fox spirit returned to the gate, but seeing the talisman guarding it, transformed into a sparrow to fly through the window. At the bedside, seeing Yan Yan wearing the talisman and guarded by divine generals, it dared not approach. Several times it tried, but dared not act rashly. The fox spirit wept and left. After taking the talisman ashes, true qi returned to the body, and it never dared come again.

The prefect, seeing his son cured and demon gone, took Yan Yan to the temple to bow to Tan Xian and ordered temple repairs. From then on, his fame spread far and wide; converts to the gate were countless. Tan Zhenren painted a “Turtle and Snake Diagram” for the prefect, saying, “There is a nearby fire hazard here. Hang this picture to extinguish fire; treasure it well.” Bangfu opened it and saw a turtle and a snake; from the snake’s mouth came fire, from the turtle’s mouth came water, water overcoming fire. Soon a great fire raged in Chengdu city. The prefect hurriedly took the picture to fight the fire, hung it up, and the fire extinguished itself. The prefect rejoiced, believing it a supreme treasure, knowing Tan Xian’s dao power was profound.

Seeing the sect’s spirit flourishing and affairs many and complex, Tan Zhenren bade farewell to all, roaming and saving beings, accumulating功 and departing. He passed the Golden Elixir dao to Zhang Daoqing. The disciples sent him off for ten li, begging for a return date. Tan Zhenren said, “You must cultivate diligently without slackening; when功 is full and fruit ripe, we shall meet again.” With a wave of his sleeve, he departed. Leaving a sect poem called the Namo Sect:

The dao’s root venerates true principle,  
Profound and subtle, the immortal’s marvel.  
The method ascends beyond the clouds,  
功 complete, fame is certain.  
Great teaching shines pure and clear,  
Broadly unfolding virtue alone.  
Awaken primordial light and nature,  
One will returns to perfect harmony.

---

Tan Zhenren’s disciples numbered dozens; only Zhang and Li attained the dao, later completing the dao fruit. Not detailed further.

---

Tan Zhenren roamed everywhere, accumulating功 awaiting summons. At Mount Da’e in Jiazhou, he emerged divine and played in realms, carefree and at ease. Suddenly recalling when first arriving in Chengdu and meeting the mad immortal woman, he composed a final poem atop Mount Emei:

When I left dust behind to seek the dao,  
The immortal woman saw through the narrow rules.  
One punch drove away many past lives’ sins,  
Leaping forth, the yang spirit dwells alone.
