# Chapter Fifteen: Liu Chuxuan Imprisoned in the Prince’s Jail Prays for Rain; Hao Taigu Cultivates at Zhaozhou Bridge

**Verse:**

Immortals are easy to seek,  
Yet without cultivation, none; with cultivation, some.  
One day, when功 is fulfilled, astride a crane you soar,  
Your yang spirit free, carefree and pure.  
Beneath the bridge, serene and slow,  
Nourishing spirit day by day,  
Saving living souls and ghosts alike, no enmity grows.  
Guiding young maidens to the Isles of the Immortals,  
功 and conduct endless, through all ancient days unceasing flows.  
(*Right tune: “New Moon Sinks the Hook”*)

It is told: Master Tan Changzhen, the Perfected One, after composing poems in the wondrous realm of Emei, descended the mountain, intending to roam and enjoy Yuzhou. Upon reaching the borders of Huzhou, at night he saw the Water Star shining bright, yet the Fire Star dimmed, the Earth Star without light, all among the well ghosts. He pondered: surely this place would soon flood greatly. Unable to bear the thought of the lowly people drowning, he spread warnings far and wide to flee early. Within three days, indeed a great flood came. Countless common folk were grateful for his blessing. From then on, his功 and merits accumulated widely. This story is not told here.

Meanwhile, Liu Changsheng, free and at ease, bade farewell to his elder brothers in Shaanxi, consulted physiognomy to dispel confusion, and roamed the Zhongnan Mountains. There he met Master Lü, who again imparted the essential dao. Later, at Wudang Mountain, he quietly refined the elixir to completion. He then traveled to Xiangzhou, gaining the tutelage of the guardian Natural, quietly nurturing for four years until he achieved脱胎神化—transformation of body and spirit. Having realized the dao, he wished to cross the Xiang River but found no boat. So Liu the Perfected flung his umbrella, soaring through the air, crossing the river. The crowd witnessing this knew he was a true immortal, burning incense to pay homage. This tale is not told here.

After crossing the Xiang River, Liu the Perfected invited himself to the land of the swimming chapter. There he saw an old woman holding a dead child, weeping until the child seemed to come back to life; beside her stood a middle-aged woman, also crying ceaselessly. The Perfected One asked the cause. An elder said, “These two, mother-in-law and daughter-in-law, are both widows. Their family’s five branches lack heirs, with only this child, who died of smallpox. Their ancestors for generations were known for accumulated善—goodness. Why then suffer this retribution of extinction? How can one not grieve and lament?” Hearing this, Liu Changsheng’s heart was moved with pity. He pitied the five branches without descendants, the lonely mother-in-law and daughter-in-law, and the family’s long history of善, believing he could rescue the child back to life. Approaching, he called, “Mother, do not weep so. Bring this child to me; I will see if he can yet be saved.” The two women, hearing the daoist say “can be saved,” hastily brought the dead child forward. Liu the Perfected examined him and said, “He can be saved, he can be saved. Go fetch the ‘rootless water.’” The women did not know what rootless water was. An elder nearby explained, “Rootless water is water fallen from Heaven. It has not yet touched earth, thus called rootless.” The old woman hurried to find the water.

This word stirred all the old and young in the region to come watch. Soon the old woman returned with the rootless water. The Perfected One placed his refined yang elixir into the child’s mouth, pried open his jaws with a hard object, and poured the rootless water down his throat. Then he took the true qi of the Five Directions and blew it into the child’s abdomen. In a moment, the limbs grew warm, breath faintly stirred at nose and mouth. Seeing the child gradually revive, the mother-in-law and daughter-in-law prostrated themselves, saying, “If not for a celestial immortal descending to the mortal realm, how could this child live again? Truly he is our grandson reborn as our son. Were it not for the immortal’s rescue, we two would have followed him to the Nine Springs!” Liu the Perfected hastily supported the two and said, “Today you have taken my elixir pill. Not only does it restore life from death, it guarantees lifelong health and grants long life. Meeting me today to save him is the fruit of your ancestors’ accumulated善功.” Having spoken, he vanished like a fluttering sleeve. The two women wished to keep him but could not; helpless, they painted an image of Immortal Liu and worshipped it day and night. All who saw marveled, saying truly he was a celestial immortal. Later generations built a temple to Immortal Liu here, and those who prayed received spiritual responses. This is a later tale, not told here.

Meanwhile, Liu the Perfected journeyed north to Haizhou. At that time, the weather was fiercely dry, and the people were unruly. The prefecture set up an altar, ordering monks and daoists to pray, but no response came. The prefect grew angry and ordered strict arrests of all monks and daoists, capturing every one they saw and imprisoning them in the Prince’s Jail, numbering over three hundred. Liu the Perfected was also detained within. The prefect commanded, “Keep these monks and daoists locked in the Prince’s Jail, do not feed them. Only when rain falls shall they be released. If Heaven does not send rain, let them starve to death, to prevent their heretical words from misleading the people. Keeping them alive is of no benefit to the world.” The monks and daoists, imprisoned three days without food, wailed to the heavens, desolate and despairing, saying, “If no rain falls within seven days, we shall all die starved ghosts!” Each cried out loudly, tears streaming.

Liu the Perfected’s heart was moved with pity. He thought, “Though these monks and daoists do not keep pure precepts and have corrupted the teaching’s appearance, they deserve this tribulation. Yet to treat jade and stone alike—this official is too harsh on the dao! I shall accumulate功德, both for the people and for these monks and daoists.” That night, he sent forth his yang spirit, went to the temple, took a large wooden fish, and carried it to the prefect’s rear office, where he began to strike it. The sound made fire blaze in the prefect’s eyes and smoke rise from his mouth. Hastily he ascended the hall and ordered arrests.

The officers searched all directions but only heard the wooden fish’s sound in the rear office, seeing no one. They reported back. The prefect himself heard it and was equally baffled. Helpless, he shouted, “Who among you monks or daoists uses invisibility to strike this fish? What form have you taken? Show yourself and explain!” Liu the Perfected answered from the air, “I take no other form; I am but transforming those monks and daoists imprisoned in the Prince’s Jail.” The prefect said, “If you have invisibility, you must have the method to pray for rain. Why not come pray and save the people’s suffering, accumulating great功?” The Perfected said, “To pray for rain is not difficult. If you obey three matters, I guarantee a great downpour, and the people will rejoice.” The prefect asked, “What three matters?” The Perfected replied, “First, tomorrow morning release all monks and daoists from the Prince’s Jail and provide them with a vegetarian feast; second, set up a pure altar three zhang and six chi high in a wild place, with incense and offerings complete; third, you and your wife personally lead the local gentry and these monks and daoists to the altar, all bowing on both sides. When the rain begins, do not scatter or cover yourselves; wait until the rain ceases before leaving. If anyone leaves early, they will be struck by lightning; if people scatter, the rain will stop, failing to nourish the land and wasting the prayers. Be careful, be cautious!” The prefect replied, “If the Master can pray for sweet rain to fall and bless the people, we shall obey these three matters.” Liu the Perfected returned to the jail. This story is not told here.

The prefect, surnamed Liu, given name Bangzheng, was a native of Bianjing in Henan. He had passed the imperial examinations with distinction. As official in Haizhou, he cared for the people. Hearing the Perfected’s words that during rain one must not avoid or cover oneself, he thought, “Though the sky is dry and the summer hot, a cool rain wetting the body will do no harm.” He sent orders to the gentry and elders and commanded the altar be built and vegetarian feasts prepared. By dawn the next day all was ready, the city’s gentry and elders assembled. The prefect ordered all monks and daoists in the Prince’s Jail to be released for the feast.

These monks and daoists, starved to weakness, suddenly called out of prison to eat, each thinking, “This old master must want to starve us to death, yet now he releases us and feeds us. Could it be a Bodhisattva enlightened him last night?” The officers said, “You are fortunate! Last night a formless immortal came to the rear office, striking a wooden fish to raise funds to free you from suffering. The great master ordered him to pray for rain to save the people, so you have been given life.” The monks and daoists then knew the story and discussed, “Which patriarch descended to save our lives?” Joyfully they finished the feast and all bowed in gratitude in the great hall.

The prefect ordered, “You gentry, elders, monks, daoists, soldiers, and common folk, all gather around the altar. Await the Master’s ascent to pray for rain, each with sincere heart bowing, no idle thoughts. When the rain falls, do not avoid or cover yourselves, nor leave early lest you be struck by lightning. If people scatter, the rain will stop, and life cannot be revived. Those who violate this will be punished!” All obeyed and gathered at the altar. The prefect and his wife arrived in sedan chairs beneath the altar, seeing all assembled but no Master yet, called out loudly, “All three matters are ready; please invite the Master to ascend.” At that moment a daoist stepped onto the altar, dressed thus:

A lotus-leaf kerchief crowned his head, a full moon shining bright;  
A crane’s feather cloak draped his shoulders, sleeves flowing like the pure breeze.  
In hand a dust-cleaning whisk, majestic as a fairy from Penglai;  
On feet, many-eared shoes, surpassing the perfected of the Azure Palace.  
Lips like vermilion paint, eyes flashing golden light in all directions;  
Face powdered white, the whole countenance like jade, smooth and lustrous.  
His tally struck, startling thunder gods with booming thunderclaps;  
His incantations summoned rain spirits to pour down sweet nectar.  
Truly: if not for Immortal Liu’s dao power, how could all things be revived?

The prefect, seeing this Master ascend, with immortal aura and daoist bone, bowed deeply with his wife. The gentry, monks, and daoists on both sides bowed with devoted hearts.

Liu the Perfected ascended the altar, burned a talisman, recited sacred words, and struck his tally once. The Dragon King hastened to stir clouds and spread mist. The Master burned two more talismans, struck the tally twice more; thunder roared and lightning crashed. He recited spells again, burned three talismans, struck the tally thrice; thunder and lightning intertwined, heavy rain poured like a waterfall. The officials, gentry, monks, daoists, soldiers, and common folk dared not avoid it, enduring the deluge for a long while until the rain ceased and clouds dispersed, the ground flooded a foot deep. Seeing the Master descend, his robes dry, all bowed with heartfelt reverence.

Liu the Perfected addressed the crowd: “Today you prayed for rain here; I have cleansed your faults and errors. You, having taken monastic vows, entered the empty gate, yet refused to cultivate the dao and still created karmic obstacles, thus this tribulation befell you. Fortunate that I came to save your lives. From now on, each must generate善念, reform past and cultivate future. This rain washes your hearts and bodies; do not repeat former wrongs, so you may escape the苦趣 of reincarnation.” Turning to the prefect, he said, “You are a disciple of Confucian teachings, versed in poetry and rites. Now as ruler of this prefecture, managing affairs above and sharing burdens with the people below, how can you not understand the principles of the three teachings? Your failure to bring rain by altar prayers is your fault. You should have observed vegetarian feasts, practiced善, guided the people to reform evil and cultivate善, so human hearts move Heaven’s heart. When Heaven’s heart is pleased, rain flows freely, and all things thrive in peace. This is your official duty. Yet you did not practice善, instead imprisoning monks and daoists in the Prince’s Jail to starve. Had I not come, over three hundred would have died unjustly, their grievances unresolved, endlessly repaying. You have committed this great罪. Hurry to repent and awaken. Today I cleanse you, so you do not become further defiled and sink into the sea of苦. With this, I take my leave.” With that, he flicked his sleeve and departed. The crowd bowed and wished to keep him, but he would not stay; all bowed and thanked him as he left.

This region, having received this rain, prospered with peace and abundance. The prefect then submitted memorials to build a temple to Immortal Liu, where incense smoke never ceased through generations. This is a later tale, not told here.

Meanwhile, Hao Taigu, having parted from his elder brothers at Xianyang, traveled throughout the world. Arriving at Jiangzhou, he visited Kuanglu Mountain, met a strange person who spoke of the dao and taught him the principles of the Yi, sharpening his divination. Later he went to Yangzhou to guide the confused, staying more than a year, his fame spreading far. Yet he pondered the swift passage of time, fearing that without urgent cultivation, he would not escape the苦趣 of reincarnation. He wished to choose a place and employ workers, but fate was unkind, so he traveled north.

At the borders of Zhaozhou, he saw a great bridge, towering and wide beyond measure. In times of drought, the riverbed lay bare; in floods, only half the river was submerged. To the south was a small cavern, enough for three to sit, neither wet nor dirty, peaceful and quiet. This bridge was called Zhao Bridge, built long ago by the master craftsman Lu Ban. When the bridge was completed, the immortal Zhang Guolao once crossed it riding a mule with the fairy Han, stepping outward to topple two layers of bridge stones. On the bridge were several mule hoofprints, deep several inches—these immortal traces remain to this day. North and south of the bridge were dense villages and hamlets. Hao Taigu settled beneath this bridge to quietly cultivate, going out to beg vegetarian food when hungry.

In the southern village by the bridge lived a girl surnamed Teng, named Yungu, aged fourteen. Her family had parents and brothers, known for善行. Yet Yungu had a karmic root from before, having eaten vegetarian and studied scriptures since childhood, disliking worldly bustle. Seeing Taigu living beneath the bridge for over a month, silent and speechless, sitting in the cavern, people knew he was extraordinary. Yungu and her mother agreed to bring him food daily and often accompany him. Taigu knew she had a latent root and sometimes spoke words of self-cultivation. Yungu awakened and bowed to Taigu as her master. Taigu said, “Your heart’s source is clear and deep, with a karmic cause from before; you shall have a share in ascending to immortality. Now, fortunate that your Heavenly Stem is Wei and your passions have not yet awakened, cultivation is easy. I now teach you the dao of the Three Ones. Cultivate it, and your body will not leak. But I now wish to nourish the胎 and调神—foster the embryo and harmonize the spirit. This requires a companion. I appoint you as guardian for three years; when my功 is complete, I will then渡 you.” Yungu said, “May the Master’s dao be fulfilled; your disciple shall guard as commanded.”

Taigu rejoiced and began his功. Yungu diligently served him morning and evening for three years. Taigu’s Golden Elixir was completed; he neither hungered nor thirsted, transformed body and spirit, and gained reverse knowledge of the future.

One night, beneath the bridge, two ghosts spoke: “Tomorrow at noon, a man wearing an iron hat will come to relieve my suffering.” One ghost congratulated and departed. At noon the next day, rain fell. A man with an iron pot on his head came down the bridge to wash his feet. Taigu stopped him, and the man left. That evening, several ghosts gathered. One asked, “You said at noon someone would relieve your suffering; why did you not go?” The other replied, “When he came, this gentleman stopped him, so he could not take my place.” The ghosts grew angry: “This man is unreasonable! He sat beneath this bridge for years; we never harmed him, yet he harms us! Now we will seize him to take his place.” The ghosts swarmed to seize him but found no trace. They said, “Just now he was sitting here meditating; why is he gone so suddenly?” The ghosts sighed and departed.

Taigu said to Yungu, “Ghosts are pure yin in nature; immortals pure yang in body. One who attains the dao has myriad gods to protect him. Immortals can easily destroy ghosts, but ghosts harming immortals is difficult.” The ghosts searched in vain; Hao the Perfected had returned to emptiness, his body shrouded in golden light—how could ghosts see him?

At this time, the people of Zhaozhou all believed Taigu had the dao, coming to guard and follow him in growing numbers, wishing to build temples with their master. Taigu, weary of the fuss, departed with Yungu to Mount Hua. Yungu bade farewell to her parents and brothers, following her master to the Western Peak, begging vegetarian food along the way, refining heart and nature. Truly:

One heart yearns for the dao, learning immortality,  
Forgetting the countless苦 of life before.  
Laughable are those who now feign the way,  
Yet think sitting still will raise them to Heaven.
