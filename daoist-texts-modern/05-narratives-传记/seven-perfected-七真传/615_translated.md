# Chapter Sixteen: Bai Yuchan’s Resolute Heart Seeks Dao and Virtue — Qiu Changchun Saves the World in the West

**Verse:**

Profound merit brings natural retribution,  
When deeds are full, ascent to flight is fated.  
Steadfast heart and bitter will never cease,  
All depends on a humble self to seek.  
The *Journey to the West*’s path is deep and dark,  
The *Investiture of the Gods*’ fiery nature not yet quenched.  
If taken as mere common tales,  
One cannot glimpse the immortal’s gate.

*(Tune from “Drunken Song of Lofty Spirit”)*

Now, it is told that Hao Taigu, accompanied by the cloud maiden, journeyed by fate’s guidance, passing through Shanxi, crossing the Yellow River, and ascending the Western Peak, Mount Hua, to cultivate. Employing divine craftsmanship, he carved a cavern in a sheer cliff behind the summit of Mount Hua. Outside, iron stakes were driven into the rock, joined by nine interlocking wooden beams, forming a passage for travelers to come and go. He then entrusted the dao to the cloud maiden.

The two abstained from cooked food, living on the mountain by gathering herbs such as polygonatum, Chinese yam, and lily bulbs for sustenance. Hao Zhenren commanded the cloud maiden to dwell inside the mountain cavern, cultivating until her dao was perfected. Her body grew covered in hair, her steps swift as flight. Those who saw her would shudder and retreat up the cliff face. Later generations called this cave the “Hairy Maiden’s Cavern.”

Hao Zhenren then opened seventy-two more caverns to facilitate future generations in nourishing the dao. At that time, seekers of the dao climbed the mountain in increasing numbers. Hao Zhenren descended to wander the world, accumulating merit, awaiting the imperial summons to ascend. Before leaving, he left a poetic lineage teaching known as the Mount Hua School:

> Attain the One, the unsurpassed dao,  
> Uphold teaching, perfect the whole truth.  
> Harmony and virtue are the root,  
> Benevolence, righteousness, propriety, wisdom, and faith.  
> Auspiciousness blesses the grand cosmos,  
> All principles return to primal success.  
> Pure stillness penetrates mysterious transformation,  
> Realize nature, awaken sincere clarity.

Meanwhile, in Qiongzhou lived Bai Yuchan, originally surnamed Ge, a native of Minqing County in Fuzhou, a disciple of the Dong teaching in Qiongzhou. His father was named Zhenye. In the third year of Shaoxing during Emperor Gaozong’s reign of the Song dynasty, on the fifteenth day of the third month in the year of the Wood Tiger, his mother dreamed of a daoist who bestowed upon her a jade toad, and thus she bore a son, named Yuchan. As he grew, he was also called Chang Geng.

His grandfather and father passed away in succession; his mother remarried, so he changed his surname to Bai and styled himself Qiongguan. From childhood, his nature was keen and bright. At ten years old, he sailed alone westward to Guangzhou, taking the boy’s examination. He was assigned the role of Master of Fate, composing a poem on the loom:

> The vast earth and mountains form the loom,  
> Hundred flowers like brocade, willows like silk.  
> In the void’s white space, a bolt is made,  
> Sun and moon double shuttles fly beyond the heavens.

The examiners deemed his mind wild and did not record him, so he turned away in frustration and returned home.

At sixteen, he devoted himself to learning immortality, resolute in his dao. With only three hundred coins in his pouch, he left home, not knowing where to lodge at night. As dusk fell and crows cried, he hurried to find shelter. After several days, he reached Zhangzhou city, having sold all his clothes, with no kin in sight. He lodged alone in a riverside village inn. At dawn he set out again, carrying only a single umbrella.

He barely made it to Xinghua’s borders amid wind and rain, in the midst of spring. Unable to return, he begged for food to stave off hunger. After more than ten days, he reached Luoyuan and the Temple of Blessings, offering himself as a servant. Within half a month, he parted with the head monk. Under scorching sun, he ran barefoot, flesh bleeding with sweat, pain beyond words.

At Jiangpu, autumn rains fell drearily; with no umbrella or hat to shield his head, he looked about in despair. Hearing that the people of Jianning Prefecture were kindhearted, he sought life there. Stretching out his hands on the broad streets, who would pity a begging child? He entered the House of Compassion, mingled with the poor, and rested briefly.

Later, he ascended Wuyi Mountain, where daoists scorned his poverty, disgracing their sect’s reputation. He wept and descended. He visited the Shangqing Palace on Mount Longhu, paying respects to his successor master, but the guest attendant despised his ragged clothes. He journeyed northeast, passing Raozhou, crossing Poyang Lake, reaching Jiankang where soldiers crossed the river. At that time, the Huai and Si armies were ablaze with war, corpses piled on the roads, no grass or grain in the fields.

He turned to Jiangdong amid the dog days of summer; families hid in valleys and caves. Travelers passed through the Two Zhe regions, where autumn’s chill deepened. One night in Wulin, he lodged in an ancient temple as heavy snow fell for seven days. Fortunate that his childlike spirit was not extinguished, he died and revived.

Feeling desolate, he wished for death, but comforted himself thus: “The great task of cultivating the dao must not be met with complaint. My life surely bears the fate of immortals; my future path will be guided by a master. Heaven graciously grants me this remnant life to endure hunger and cold—what is there to grieve?”

---

Bai Yuchan endured hardship without complaint, braving cold and heat, seeking the mysterious dao everywhere. Blessed with innate wisdom, broad knowledge, and discernment of truth and falsehood, he avoided the snares of heterodox sects. All the monks and daoists he met chased fame and profit, none truly rooted in life’s essence. For more than twenty years, he never encountered a true master.

At forty-two, in the third year of Emperor Xiaozong’s Chunxi era, he traveled to the eastern shore of Ningbo, where he met Chen Niwan Zhenren. Seeing him, the master took pity and recognized his dao potential, bringing him to Luofu Mountain to teach him the secrets of the Golden Elixir.

After one year, Niwan saw signs of laziness and sent him down the mountain, saying, “You must strive diligently outside for several more years; I shall await you here.” Bai Yuchan, helpless, wept and bade farewell.

At Limu Mountain, he met a divine being who bestowed upon him the Supreme Clarity’s dharma records and the Thunder Secrets of the Cavern Mystery. He traveled to Wudang Mountain, where the Left Judge of the Northern Pole’s Exorcism Court—none other than Lu Su from the Three Kingdoms era—taught him talismanic methods to aid people and accumulate merit.

He journeyed to Qingcheng in Western Shu, visiting the Golden Hall, where an elder daoist gave him the *Scripture of Deliverance*. Later, in Baling, an epidemic struck the people. Using talismanic water, he saved the sick, exorcised demons, and healed diseases, all with perfect efficacy. He used the scripture to guide wandering spirits, all of whom attained transcendence.

From then on, he summoned thunder and rain, captured demonic spirits, performing rituals everywhere, accumulating merit in every place. After seven years, he returned to Luofu to report his progress.

Niwan rejoiced, saying, “To learn the dao requires such diligence; only then are you a true vessel.” He then taught Bai Yuchan the Way of the Taiyi Daoist Blade and Seal, saying, “I now intend to refine the spirit’s birth from the embryo and must rely on a companion’s merit. You shall guard the dharma here for several years. How does that sound?”

Bai Yuchan bowed and replied, “Master’s efforts are great; I should guard the dharma. This is my duty. I wish to protect and serve my honored teacher.” Thus, Niwan, assured by Bai Yuchan’s sincerity, began his own work, refining the spirit’s birth from the embryo. For three years he nursed it, then six years of great stillness followed, his divine transformation boundless, hidden and manifest beyond measure.

---

Bai Yuchan served his master on the mountain for nine years. One day, before his teacher, he bowed again and asked, “May this life of mine attain immortality?”

Chen Niwan replied, “Everyone can become immortal; all can achieve the dao—how much more so you?”

Bai Yuchan bowed and earnestly begged, “Without fearing your august dignity, I dare ask this presumptuous question: in my cultivation work, I wish for a word of enlightenment.”

Niwan, moved by his sincerity, explained the stages and timing, the wondrous principles of the Golden Elixir, and the work of refining the spirit’s birth from the embryo, instructing step by step:

“Now that you have the profound essence, you must begin your work without delay. Time flies swiftly, a moment is impermanent. Cultivate carefully—this is Heaven’s secret, not to be lightly shared with the unworthy. In former days, Zhang Zuziyang Zhenren passed on his teachings thrice to unworthy men and was thrice punished by Heaven. You must be cautious!

“I have refined the inner elixir; you may now accompany me northward.”

Bai Yuchan thanked him and prepared to depart. The master and disciple parted ways down the mountain, with many disciples seeing them off. The tale does not tell of their departure.

---

Chen Niwan reached the Xiang River and said to Bai Yuchan, “I will travel north and be delayed for some time. I fear this might hinder your cultivation. It is better you attend to your affairs. But you have no dharma guardian; you may support yourself with wealth. Go buy some mercury— the more, the better.”

Bai Yuchan asked, “Master, what use have you for mercury?”

Niwan replied, “Go buy it; it will be of use.”

So Bai Yuchan obeyed, purchasing two pounds of mercury and handing it to his master. Niwan rejoiced, “These two pounds will suffice for several years’ nourishment.” He placed the mercury in his mouth, and after a moment, spat it out, transformed into gold.

Bai Yuchan was amazed and exclaimed, “My master possesses such divine power! I have heard in the *Alchemy Scripture*: ‘After the dao is achieved, the body transforms to pure yang; it can enter water without drowning, fire without burning, metal and stone without obstruction, and walk the sun and moon without shadow.’ But never heard mercury swallowed and turned to gold. This dao is truly wondrous.”

Niwan said, “This Golden Elixir’s great Way of cultivation, when gathered, forms shape; when dispersed, has no substance. It can make dry bones stand on earth, rotten wood sprout in moments. Mercury turning into gold is no marvel.”

---

Bai Yuchan asked, “Once transformed to gold, does it revert?”

Niwan said, “Immortals, using the Golden Elixir’s alchemy, can keep it unchanged for five hundred years. If it is mere illusionary alchemy, it may last a year or half, rarely three or five years without change. Now I give you this gold to take with you as your dao foundation, so you may begin your work.”

Bai Yuchan said, “Now I hear your words. If this gold reverts after five hundred years, would it not harm people? I dare not use it.”

Niwan said, “Hearing your concern for what happens after five hundred years shows your dao heart; you will surely attain the celestial immortal’s fruition. But even if this gold changes after five hundred years, it will not harm. Those who hoard gold are officials and wealthy households; these two pounds of gold, divided into eight pieces, will not be kept by one family. What harm is there? You may live hidden in the bustling market, diligently cultivating. I will cross the river and travel north. When your merit is full, we shall meet again.”

Bai Yuchan tearfully bowed farewell. At the Xiang River’s shore, he saw the river’s mighty waves. Chen Niwan placed his bamboo hat on the water, stepped upon it, and crossed the river. Onlookers saw this living immortal and all were amazed, bowing in awe.

---

Seeing his master cast the hat across the river, Bai Yuchan knew his master had attained the dao. He then diligently cultivated in a temple in the bustling town of Xiangxiang. After three years, he achieved the union of lead and mercury. Two more years of cultivation followed. When the Great Elixir was about to form, he was seduced by external desires, his mind careless. Suddenly, mercury fled and lead scattered; all previous work was lost. He lamented his shallow foundation and wept bitterly.

Some companions persuaded him to give up. He then traveled eastward, using talismanic water to relieve people’s suffering, cultivating merit and virtue.

He visited Tiantai, paying respects to Patriarch Zhang Ziyang Zhenren, who taught him the four hundred characters of the Golden Elixir, instructing strict vigilance and defense against demonic invasion. Bai Yuchan bowed farewell and went to Wuyi Mountain, building a hut to dwell and cultivate the elixir to completion. He was then sixty-four years old.

By fate of dharma guardianship, he again used great stillness to concentrate the spirit, sitting in forgetfulness for nine years, transcending the embryo and spirit transformation, finally attaining exquisite form and spirit, harmonizing with the dao and realizing truth.

Then he emerged from the mountain, practicing merit and virtue, awaiting the imperial summons to ascend. He styled himself Yunwaizi, skilled in cursive calligraphy and painting. He praised himself:

> For a thousand ages, wild-haired, barefoot,  
> A lifetime breathing in the rosy clouds.  
> Laughing, I point beneath Wuyi’s peaks,  
> My home deep within the white clouds.

From then on, he roamed freely, aiding people and benefiting all beings. He also called himself Ziqing. Later, he compiled a collection of writings called *The Collection of Awakening to the Dao*, which circulated widely. Traveling the world, practicing the dao and accumulating merit, he painted plum blossoms and bamboo for amusement. He guided many seekers, drinking and chanting without weariness, lifting countless beings. Barefoot and disheveled, free and graceful—his story is not further told here.

---

Meanwhile, Qiu Changchun Zhenren, having parted from his disciples at Dragon Gate Cave, crossed the snowy Congling Mountains, westward over the flowing sand river, visiting many lands to save beings.

He reached the land of Tianzhu, also called Zhujian, now known as India. The king saw Qiu Zhenren often surrounded by clouds and mist like a precious canopy above his head, calling him the “Precious Canopy Buddha,” also “Living Buddha of the East,” and to this day every household in the West worships him. This tale does not elaborate further.

Qiu Zhenren traveled through the kingdoms of Yuezhi and Huihui, guiding lost disciples and converting beings everywhere. Returning to the snowy mountains, he stayed at the Lingjiu Monastery, lodging there. He met an old monk named Baiyun, who held a copy of the *Investiture of the Gods*. Together, they read it carefully. Though the text’s meaning was wondrous, its fiery nature was not extinguished, insufficient for the dao.

Qiu Zhenren lingered in that temple for over a year, composing the *Journey to the West*, a work of one hundred chapters recounting ninety-nine magical tribulations, infinitely marvelous transformations—an arcane secret for cultivating the dao, subduing demons, and relieving calamities. When the book was finished, he entrusted it to Monk Baiyun.

The monk studied it quietly for a month. One day, he invited Qiu Zhenren to the abbot’s hall, laid a grand feast, seated the master in the place of honor, and bowed deeply in the disciple’s manner, saying:

“Your disciple is ignorant and shallow, with little virtue and heavy sin, having no success in the dao. Now meeting the master here in this humble temple is the fortune of three lifetimes. I humbly beseech you to reveal a thread of insight so this unworthy one may find a path of progress. If in the future I attain the dao, I will not forget the master’s kindness in guidance.”

Qiu Zhenren hastened to return the bow, saying, “The abbot’s virtue is like a hill, nature like the autumn moon—why worry about not attaining Buddhahood? Why such humility?”

They clasped hands and sat. The abbot said, “Were it not for your arrival, I would be like the River God, with water in excess of myself. Now seeing your dao, I realize my ugliness, like climbing a hill to see the Han stele—lofty when looked up to, firm when examined, like a small stone or twig before a great mountain, a speck before a horse’s body.”

Qiu Zhenren asked, “Why do you humble yourself so?”

The monk replied, “Not humility, but seeing your *Journey to the West*, every word a mystery, every sound a wondrous truth, containing secret profundities, infinitely subtle. You possess the talent to govern heaven and earth, to ride the light and command the wind. If you are willing to save the ignorant, I wish to join your school. What say you, master?”

Qiu Zhenren said, “You are a disciple of the Buddha’s school, destined to be a patriarch of Western Chan, not a vessel of my mysterious lineage. I see in your *Investiture of the Gods* some wondrous methods, but the fiery nature is not extinguished. You must utterly quench the fire nature to realize bodhi. Only then can we speak of the dao. When desire is removed, one leaves the realm of desire; when worldly attachments end, one transcends the form realm. When the heart is not attached to emptiness, it surpasses the formless.

“You should carefully study my *Journey to the West*, and when eighty kinds of magical obstacles are extinguished, you will naturally obtain the true scripture and return to your land. Scripture means gold—the Golden Elixir in the human belly—the great dao naturally accomplished.”

Monk Baiyun bowed in thanks, saying, “I am deeply grateful for your enlightening words. When may I repay the master’s kindness?”

Qiu Zhenren finished his meal and took leave, saying, “I set out tomorrow to return to my homeland. This is farewell for now. As long as you diligently cultivate the great dao and your merit is full, we shall meet again at the grand assembly of Longhua.”

The abbot earnestly begged him to stay, saying, “I beg your pardon for my blindness. I have dwelt here over a year and only now understand your virtue. Forgive my ignorance. Please stay a few more days and instruct me in the hidden words and secret phrases of the *Journey to the West*. I would be eternally grateful.”

Seeing his sincerity, Qiu Zhenren consented to stay half a month and imparted some teachings. Then he took leave, saying, “I should have stayed longer, but many great matters call me home to China. I cannot linger.”

Monk Baiyun could not bear to let him go, but had no choice. He presented one hundred taels of gold and fifty of silver, bowing and saying, “This humble gift, please accept as travel funds.”

Qiu Zhenren said, “I have dwelt here over a year and been deeply cared for. I dare not accept such generosity.”

The monk said, “Now that you have saved me, master and disciple need not be modest. Moreover, your *Journey to the West* says: ‘To seek treasures in Heaven, one must use worldly wealth.’ Tang Sanzang did not part with his golden alms bowl, yet the true scripture was not attained. Though this is a secret of the dao, worldly propriety is also natural.”

Qiu Zhenren replied, “Greed for wealth is not for those who leave home; those who leave home do not covet wealth. If one loves riches, he is not a true cultivator. But as I journey, I intend to build monasteries, and wealth is necessary.”

Thus it is said:

> The benevolent give wealth and gain blessings;  
> The unkind hoard riches and perish.  
> If one loves treasures and covets wealth,  
> How can he cultivate and learn the dao?
