# Chapter Seventeen: Mystical Discourse Upon the Stone, Flying Canopies in the Air — Ritual Altar’s Magic Bewilders the Illusory Market

**Verse:**

To cultivate the dao and seek the True,  
Lead the primal course through void’s extreme.  
At nine and two, the dragon’s beard appears —  
Profound indeed!  
With cleaving clarity, the sage imparts.  
At noon and midnight, fire is stirred and brewed,  
Examining the forward and the backward strings.  
At rabbit and rooster, bathing is befitting —  
Softly, softly.  
The patterns of strength and gentleness are honed in turn.  
*(Tune: “Southern Village Child”)*

It is told that Master Qiu Changchun spoke to the monk Baiyun, saying, “I now intend to establish several monastic groves. Since you, Chan Master, possess true heart and earnestness, temporarily receive these funds, and together we shall nurture the root of the dao.” Hearing the master’s words about building groves, the monk fetched one hundred taels of gold and said, “Disciple has heard your intention to build groves; this is my original vow. Here is another hundred taels of gold. I beg you, master, to take it and seek some repentance rites on my behalf.” Thus, Master Qiu accepted two hundred taels of gold and fifty taels of silver in total. The monk commanded two monks to escort the master down the mountain. The assembly of monks saw him off beyond the mountain gate, kneeling and bowing for five li, only turning back when the master was out of sight. The two monks accompanied him for a day, resting overnight at a foot hall at the mountain’s base. The next day, the two monks returned to the temple, while Master Qiu returned to his homeland. This is not recorded further.

Meanwhile, at Longmen Grotto, Zhao Xujing, since his master journeyed westward, maintained strict discipline and austere conduct, observing the pure regulations with utmost care. The community of cultivators flourished all the more. One day, he spoke to fellow dao friends, “Our master journeyed westward, and now seven years have passed without return. When he descended the mountain that year, I once asked him about his return date. He said it would be when the fragrant western wind arrives. Fellow dao friends, remember this well.” As they spoke, suddenly a strange fragrance wafted in. Xujing said, “This fragrant wind comes differently. Let us go out of the grotto to see what wind it is. If it is the western wind, then our master has returned.” All went out to look, and indeed the fragrant wind came from the west, waves of sweet scent filling the air. Xujing said, “Friends, let us go together westward to welcome him.” There were more than ten in all, all joyful as they went, leaving one behind to watch the grotto.

After ten li, they saw their master approaching from afar. Overjoyed, they thronged around him, bowing and welcoming him. Each seized a bundle from the master’s pack to carry. Master Changchun went ahead, the disciples following behind, until they reached the grotto and sat down. After all had paid respects, Zhao Xujing said, “Our honored master journeyed westward for seven years and has now returned this morning. The hardships of the road must have been great. We have long awaited your return. On your journey to the western lands, were the peoples there able to be transformed?” Master Changchun briefly recounted the states of the western countries, then related the story of the White Cloud Chan Master at the Spirit Vulture Monastery composing the *Investiture of the Gods*, and his own composition of the *Journey to the West*. He then opened his pack and took out the draft of the *Journey to the West*, entrusting it to Xujing: “Have this carved into blocks and circulated for future generations; it will benefit those who cultivate themselves.” He then ordered a day to be chosen to begin construction of buildings, thus opening Longmen Grotto as a monastic grove to gather the worthy.

Master Changchun dwelt at Longmen for more than a year. He instructed Dao Jian to entrust their household affairs to Song Dao’an, and took with him Zhao Daojian, Zheng Zhixiu, and three others, five in all, to journey eastward. Passing Tong Pass, they reached the territory of Dengfeng County in Henan. There they beheld two great mountains, crowned with veils of colorful clouds, exquisitely beautiful. The eastern was called Taishi, the western Shaoshi. Taishi was the Central Peak, Mount Song. Master Changchun said, “Among the famous mountains under Heaven, the Five Peaks stand foremost. Among the Five Peaks, Song Mountain is central. I intend to widely spread the profound wind; this must be established as foremost, then other places may follow.” The disciples all said, “Master, your words are most excellent.”

Thus, master and disciples came together beneath the mountain, surveying all four directions. At the southwestern foot of Xuanyuan Peak, not far from the Central Peak temple, stood an ancient temple named the Palace of Longevity. The master and disciples took residence there and began reconstruction. Benevolent donors from the Ten Directions gathered, joyfully assisting and offering. Within several years, the work was completed. They built over one hundred rooms and thirty-six halls, renaming the Palace of Longevity as the Palace of Revered Blessings. You may wonder how Master Changchun and his disciples could raise so grand a temple in just a few years. The truth was that after Master Changchun attained the dao, he was constantly guarded by one hundred thousand heavenly soldiers. The eight great primordial masters—Zhu, Wang, Yin, Pan, Yue, Wen, Ma, and Zhao—never left his side. Moreover, mountain gods, earth spirits, city gods, dragon spirits, and many others secretly supported him. Within a few years, the Palace of Revered Blessings was built like an immortal’s abode, its towering halls majestic as jeweled palaces, its vast temple appearance like the celestial realms of Langyuan and Penghu. Above the mountain gate were carved seven great characters: “Palace of Revered Blessings, Monastic Grove of the Ten Directions.” From then on, dao companions came by the thousands, worthy scholars from all under Heaven flowed in. The sect’s spirit flourished, the profound teaching rose day by day. The thirty-six pure regulations were each strictly observed; the eighty-one ranks of officials were all qualified. The residents’ every movement—walking, standing, sitting, lying—was like that of immortal beings from Peng and Ying. Young and old, wise and foolish, all were transformed by the dao upon hearing the wind. The strong, violent, and wicked—all who spoke ill found no reply and turned their hearts.

One day, Master Changchun, at leisure with the assembly, wandered through the mountain realm, enjoying every corner. They came upon a great stone, flat and even, large enough for dozens to sit upon. Master Qiu ascended and sat. It was the third month, the weather mild; a gentle breeze brushed their faces, fragrant scents pressed close; fish leapt, kites soared, waters flowed, flowers bloomed. The master’s mysterious insight stirred, his heart blossomed like a flower. He said to all, “Such splendid scenes are rarely met in the world. Life in this world is just the same. You have been born in China and entered the Profound Gate; if you do not hasten to turn your heart toward the dao, you will waste your chance in the world. Time swiftly passes; fine scenes are seldom encountered. Flowers fall but will bloom again; but when a person dies, few return to life. Once breath ceases, life is no more. Flesh dissolves into clear wind, bones turn to foul mud. Glory and wealth all become illusions.”

At this, disciple Wang Zhiming knelt before the master and asked, “Master, I have heard your words: flowers fall but may bloom again; people die but few return to life. Is there in the world anyone who lives forever, who dies and is reborn? Is this truly so?” Master Qiu said, “Excellent question! Sit again and listen closely, all who delight to hear, cleanse your hearts and listen carefully. Do not entertain other thoughts; sit upright and still your minds; hear my explanation. Since the time of the Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors until now, no one has escaped death. Only immortals and Buddhas do not die. Those who die yet retain spirit are gods or ghosts. When a person lives in the world, acts justly, holds a whole heart, embraces loyalty, filial piety, chastity, and righteousness, their original nature is not utterly lost. After death, they may become gods. This is because their spirit is clear and not dimmed, their righteous energy not scattered. Those who become gods or ghosts are pure yin without yang. Because in life one acts foolishly, indulges in lust, speaks lies, steals, cheats, harms others for self-benefit, greedily covets, and acts against Heaven’s principle, various evil thoughts arise, consuming spirit, energy, and the three treasures until death. Their conscience is ruined, spirit lost. Such are ghosts. The dark officials of the underworld examine their sins and punish accordingly; some fall into the Three Paths, some become beasts; their retribution is exact and cannot be fully told. Immortals and Buddhas are pure yang without yin. A single orb of clear spirit and original nature, like the bright moon, when clouds are brushed away, a solitary moon hangs high in the sky, illuminating earth, mountains, and rivers. This is called nature, the sun; the beautiful maiden, the azure dragon; called mercury, called cinnabar—different names but one truth. In sum, a single point of clear original nature: when thought arises, it is the conscious spirit; when contained, the primordial spirit; when nurtured, the embryonic spirit; when expressed, the yang spirit. It is east in direction, thunder in the trigram, wood in the Five Phases. Wood generates fire; fire is the heart. The heart is the child of nature. Those who know how to cultivate themselves sever emotions and desires, extinguish false thoughts and worries, and the true nature reveals itself. Those who do not cultivate indulge desires, greed, and false thoughts, wasting themselves day by day; their heart reveals no nature, growing dim and confused; thus the dead become ghosts in the netherworld. Cultivators of the dao must achieve no-mind. No-mind is Confucius’ ‘no intention, no necessity, no obstinacy, no self’; Yan Hui’s ‘sitting in forgetfulness’; Zi Qi’s ‘losing the self’; Zhuangzi and Laozi’s ‘land of no-thingness.’ All these point to the doctrine of no-mind.”

Wang Zhiming further asked, “Master, I have heard you say that with no mind, the dao’s marvels are boundless. Yan Hui had the power of sitting in forgetfulness, yet why did he die at thirty-two?” Changchun replied, “Have you not heard the words of Master Ziyang: ‘The Eastern Flower, the old immortal, sits alone in an empty room with no accomplishment. Suddenly he meets the Golden Holy Mother of the Western Pond; one elixir sends him soaring.’ Gold is the ancestral energy of the West. Within the human body, nurturing it is primordial qi; refining it is true lead; expressing it is the true seed, sun and moon, white tiger, infant. It is west in direction, lake in the trigram, metal in the Five Phases. Metal generates water. Water is the yang essence of metal, the yang essence in the kidneys. The great cultivator knows how to nurture water to generate metal, nurture fire to generate wood. Thus the path of reversal can produce Buddhas and immortals. Water generates wood and controls fire. Human nature is originally fiery; without water to restrain it, it cannot remain; water is moist below; without earth to restrain it, it flows unchecked. Metal without fire’s forging is not strong; wood without metal’s carving cannot become a tool. Earth without fire does not produce; wood without earth has no root. The Five Phases mutually use one another. Yan Hui only knew to follow the Five Phases and return to the root, not to reverse the Five Phases and master creation. How could he know the principle of accumulation in the Five Phases, or the interpenetration of the Eight Trigrams? Thus he died. Cultivators seize the creation of Heaven and Earth, observe the waxing and waning of the new and full moons, discern the decline and growth of yin and yang, exhaust the same kind and then act. The golden crow and jade rabbit are medicines within our bodies; Heaven and Earth, Heaven and Earth, are but the cauldron and furnace within the compass. Those who understand this can exhaust the mechanisms of myriad transformations; those who cultivate this dao can step into the great void; those who grasp this method can assist the foundations of emperors; those who comprehend this dao can ride whales and phoenixes, mount dragons and tigers, roam and feast in the Jade Capital and Golden Palaces, and ride alongside the Void Sovereign. But the dao has three vehicles, immortals nine ranks, methods eight rules, and five gates of entry. The five gates are lineage, precepts, teaching, method, and ritual. The precepts gate is to receive vows and keep rules, manifest form to cultivate the formless, use existence to realize non-being. The teaching gate is to first accumulate external merit and then nurture internal fruition, instructing the ignorant and opening the path of awakening, leading to virtue and entry into the gate of virtue. The method gate is to use talismans to cure illness, expel demons, bind spirits, aid people with techniques, rescue from disasters, with merit as proof. The ritual gate is to recite scriptures, perform repentance, offer morning rites to the True, pray for blessings and dispel disasters, save the dead and relieve calamities, all for the benefit of others. These four gates each have their proof, all within my teachings, not beyond the three vehicles. Our sect values above all the seeing of nature, with water and fire combined next. The essence is to quiet the heart and condense the spirit as the initial step, to illuminate nature and see emptiness as the real ground, to forget consciousness and transform obstacles as the function, turning to view the dragon, tiger, mercury, and lead—all are dharma images not to be clung to. To cling to dharma images is the way of outsiders, not our disciples. You who study the dao, having entered the path, should retreat and hide in secrecy, cleansing your thoughts from the very first moment. The subtler the heavenly principle, the harder it is to conquer the human heart; the purer the human desire, the more obscure the heavenly heart seems. You may reflect on this.”

The disciples, hearing the master’s words, each stepped forward to kowtow and express thanks. Suddenly, a hundred birds flew together above, forming a canopy like a jeweled umbrella. The assembly said, “How strange! Our master speaks the dao here, and these feathered creatures come to listen. When he finishes speaking, they gradually disperse.” Master Qiu said, “All beings born of womb, egg, or moisture have spirits. Those with long life may cultivate to become essences and fruits. Today, having come to hear my words, they gain endless benefit and after death will surely be reborn as humans. Only those born of transformation who have consciousness but no nature cannot return to human form.”

As the master spoke with the assembly, a dao friend reported, “A messenger from the Song emperor has arrived.” The master and disciples returned to the palace. Outside the mountain gate, horses were tied. Master Changchun said to the disciples, “You go meet him. I will return to my chamber and say I am ill, unable to receive the decree. Ask him to take the decree back.” The disciples did not understand but obeyed.

Zhao Xujing went to the guest hall, and after greetings, all took their seats. Xujing asked, “Sir, may I ask your honorable origin? What brings you to this old palace?” The envoy replied, “I am Liu Zhong, imperial commissioner before the Song emperor’s carriage. My lord is a wise and virtuous ruler, issuing edicts to seek the worthy and secure the realm. Yesterday, the court reported that there is a Master Qiu at the Precious Temple, a man of high dao and great virtue, possessing talents to govern Heaven and Earth, strategies to stabilize the nation. Hence I was sent to summon the master to the imperial capital, to pacify the people and stabilize the state, so that lords and ministers may rely on him and all the people receive grace.” Xujing stepped forward and bowed, “We did not know the imperial commissioner had arrived, and so did not come out to welcome you. Please forgive our ignorance.” Liu Zhong said, “Sir, no fault lies in ignorance. Please have the master come out; we wish to pay respects.” Xujing replied, “The commissioner holds the Song emperor’s decree to summon my master, who should serve the state and relieve the people’s burdens. But we are all rustic mountain folk, unworthy of the dao. Moreover, my master is ill in bed and cannot receive the decree. Please take the decree back and report to the emperor that another worthy should be chosen. We have no dao virtue within, no talent without; we are but named without substance, unfit for use.” Hearing this, Liu Zhong thought, “These Daoists seem all name and no reality.” He took the decree back. Xujing saw him off beyond the mountain gate. No more is recorded.

Meanwhile, Master Qiu in the palace lay long, seldom rising. The disciples could not fathom his intent. One day he said to them, “You must diligently spread the teaching and not slacken your cultivation. I intend to journey south on some matter.” Then, bidding farewell, he vanished like a drifting cloud. The disciples escorted him for five li, then returned. No more is told.

Elsewhere, the thirty-third generation successor Zhang Bojing was summoned by the Wei prince, governor of Mingzhou, who was ill and requested a ritual to pray for peace. At that time, Master Liu Changsheng was traveling in Mingzhou. Seeing the Wei prince’s palace setting a ritual in the flower hall, and noting the successor had not yet arrived, the garden was quiet. Master Liu began to perform the ritual, manifesting a mirage upon the altar like an immortal palace on a floating isle. Tens of thousands of people beheld it daily. The Wei prince heard of this and doubted, unable to come out due to illness. Master Liu gave him talismanic water to drink, and immediately he recovered. The prince came out to see and knew the master’s magic was genuine, joy beyond words. When the successor arrived and saw the ritual altar, he thought he had mistakenly entered an immortal realm and dared not speak. Soon after, Master Liu came forth and greeted Zhang Bojing. The heavenly master hastily bowed, “Disciple has mistakenly entered the immortal palace; I beg the master’s forgiveness.” Master Liu said, “This place is indeed the mortal realm; why would the heavenly master mistake it?” Bojing said, “How can the mortal world have such an immortal scene?” Master Liu said, “This is but an illusion I set; not a true realm.” Thus, master and successor grew mutual respect and faith, invited to stay seven days. After the ritual was complete and magic withdrawn, they took leave of the Wei prince. Master Liu and the successor parted ways at Hangzhou.

Master Liu traveled through Minzhong, residing at the Huishan Hall in Fuzhou. Knowing his dao, many came to join him, numbering over two hundred. The master chose days to lecture on the *Dao De Jing*’s meaning, gathering lay and cleric alike, spreading the sect’s spirit and universally saving those with affinity. Truly:

When the great dao is fulfilled, the dharma flows,  
Spirit perfect, transformations bring endless joy.  
Teaching everywhere, meeting people to save,  
Through endless ages dwelling in the great void.

To learn of Master Liu’s later deeds, await the next chapter’s telling.
