# Chapter Eighteen: Liu Changsheng Abandons Illusions in Fuzhou — Changchunzi Returns from the Snowy Mountains

**Poem:**  

Once recalled, the old herb-gatherer sought the mysterious,  
Pursuing the dao, awakening to true emptiness.  
Transforming fate, the restless mind finds stillness,  
Subtle principles merge, taming the wild steed of thought.  
Dispelling shadowy demons, transcending the mundane,  
Refining yang essence, breaking free from the cage.  
Henceforth shattering Heaven’s net,  
Joyful and carefree, mounting cranes to soar.

Now it is told that the Perfected One Qiu Changchun, having taken leave of the gathered disciples at Chongfu Palace, journeyed to the borders of Muzhou. There he encountered Song Piyun and Li Lingyang. Though strangers, they recognized each other as fellow seekers of the dao, and exchanged names. It was then revealed that Lingyang was a friend of Zhongyang, and Piyun a disciple of Danyang. Li Lingyang had once dwelt with Yu Shan and Wang Zhongyang, forming a hermitage to cultivate together. After their elixir was complete, each went forth to establish merit, wandering the clouds far and wide. Unexpectedly meeting Changchun and Piyun here, the three showed mutual respect.

Song Piyun, knowing Changchun was his senior uncle in the lineage, bowed and said, “Disciple has long heard your teachings, uncle’s name graces the Purple Register, your virtue weighs heavily between Heaven and man. Only now do I have the honor to meet you.” Changchun hastened to detain him, inquiring, “Your master Danyang, with Buer, ascended on cranes in Luoyang of Henan. I hear you have all received Danyang’s true instructions, and your dao fruits are near completion.” Piyun replied, “My master taught the dao to Li Dacheng, Zhao Penglai, Han Qingfu, and others. They did not succeed, but I, through diligent cultivation and bitter refining for twelve years, finally shed my mortal shell and attained spiritual transformation. I owe my master great grace, and your uncle’s blessing as well. I have heard of Lanqiao in Longchuan, who failed the imperial examination, retired to Mount Huo, and once played an iron flute. There he met a wild singer of foot songs, who carried him off to ascend.” Changchun said, “Do not envy others’ beauty; accumulate your own merit and deeds, awaiting Heaven’s talisman. When your功成行满, your splendor will surpass theirs manyfold. Now that Liu Changsheng’s功圆 has returned to the void, I desire a journey to Fuzhou.”

Lingyang and Piyun gladly accompanied him. The story pauses here.

In the year of Gengshen, the Song emperor issued an edict retaining the Right Junior Protector, who then retired and passed away. In the third month, the late scholar-official Zhu Xi died at seventy-one. On that day, great winds uprooted trees and floods burst mountains. Zhu Xi had expounded the Four Books and compiled the Outline and Details of the Comprehensive Mirror. In the eighth month, the retired emperor passed away. In winter, Empress Han also died.

In the year of Xinyou, Song changed its reign title to Jiatai. A great fire broke out in Lin’an, lasting four days before being extinguished. At that time, Zhang Daoqing in Western Shu received the dao from Master Tan. Tan had gone wandering, and Zhang bade farewell to his elder brothers. Later, he refined himself for over ten years on Mount Jiugong, achieving dao and wondrous numinosity beyond measure. The Song emperor, afflicted with illness, summoned him repeatedly. Using talisman water, Zhang cured the emperor’s sickness immediately and was granted the title “True Lord.” At this time, he petitioned, “This autumn brings great drought; the ban should be lifted to restore Heaven.” He also said, “The Yelü clan will perish; this is due to their wild recklessness, a lesson to heed.” Meanwhile, the Western Liao’s Zhilu Gu went hunting, but was ambushed and captured by barbarian forces. Liao fell.

In the spring of Renshu, Jing Tang died. Tuo Zhou was promoted to Grand Preceptor. Hearing that Liu Chuxuan was lecturing on scriptures in Fuzhou, he wished to seek the dao. On the sixth day of the second month that year, Liu the Perfected sounded his drum to gather the crowd and announced, “Han Zi Tuo Zhou’s murderous intent blazes fiercely; he comes seeking the dao. Can such a man be worthy of hearing the dao? I intend to meet the Immortal Master’s appointment; you must not slacken your true cultivation. I am about to depart!” At that time, Changchun, Piyun, and Lingyang were arriving. Seeing them, Liu bowed in farewell, saying, “Your功圆 and dao备, your ascension is certain. I now take leave; we shall meet again.” Then, folding his arms, he suddenly dissolved. He had authored six volumes: *Immortal Music*, *Great Void*, *Panyang*, *Common Dust*, *Ease and Leisure*, and *Cultivating the True*. He also left behind a forty-character poem for posterity, known as the Suishan School:

> Reflect on the dao, bright with benevolence,  
> Restoring original nature to its norm.  
> Lofty radiance harmonizes rites and justice,  
> Successors uphold faith, loyalty, and goodness.  
> Generous humility blesses the virtuous host,  
> Clan and friends flourish with auspiciousness.  
> Great benefit seeks sincere simplicity,  
> Profound origins endure through the ages.

The disciples prepared their master’s body for burial. After three days, they opened the coffin to inter it. The coffin was as light as if empty. Upon lifting the lid, only his garments, hat, and shoes remained. Changchun said, “Brother Liu has already shed his corpse and departed. We shall bury these clothes and belongings as traces of his immortality.” After the burial, the disciples dispersed to their own paths of transcendence. Officials reported to the Song emperor: Liu Chuxuan has transformed and departed. He was granted the title “Perfected One Assisting Transformation.” At this time, Tuo Zhou petitioned to posthumously ennoble Yue Fei as King of E.

On the day of Yichou, Song changed its reign title to Kaixi.

In the summer of Bingyin, Wu Xi, commander of Xingzhou, rebelled and surrendered four prefectures to Jin. At that time, Li Anquan of Xia overthrew the ruler Chunyou and declared himself Xiangzong. In October, Jin established Wu Xi as King of Shu. That winter, the Mongol Qiwo Wen Temujin proclaimed himself Genghis Khan, founding the reign title Shengwu. Long ago, the Mongols had a daughter named Arlan, widowed in the northern steppes. Heaven’s light often shone upon her belly, and she bore three sons in succession: the eldest was Bo Wanhedaji, the second Bo Jisachi, the third Bo Duancha’er. Only Duancha’er was strange in appearance, heavy and taciturn, called “foolish” by others. His mother said, “This child is not a fool; his descendants will surely be greatly noble.” Their tribe paid tribute to Liao and Jin but was chiefly loyal to the Tatars. Nine generations later, Su Gai attacked the Tatars, protected their leader, and returned to the Iron Warm Pan Tuo Mountain, where he fathered a son named Qi Wo Wen Temujin. After Su Gai’s death, Temujin was young, and many followers joined the Taichiwu tribe. When Temujin grew up, wise and cunning, he and his mother Yuelun gathered their forces and defeated the Taichiwu tribe. Then he attacked the Naiman; the Sun Khan was defeated and died, and all his followers surrendered to Temujin. Seeing his wisdom and courage, all tribes submitted. They held a grand assembly on the plains of the Onan River, where Temujin ascended the throne as emperor.

In the spring of Dingmao, Jin generals planned to attack Song, just as Song executed Wu Xi. That winter, Shi Miyuan killed Tuo Zhou and presented his head to Jin. On the day of Wuchen, Song changed its reign title to Jiading. Shi Miyuan was appointed Right Prime Minister. That year, Jin’s ruler Jing died, succeeded by Wei Wang Yongji, who changed the reign title to Da’an. In the fourth year of Mongol Shengwu, Temujin conquered the tribes and invaded Jin lands.

In the year of Xinwei, Xia ruler Anquan died; his cousin Zunxu ascended as Shenzong, changing the reign title to Guangding.

Meanwhile, Perfected Qiu Changchun, having returned from Fuzhou to Chongfu Palace, repeatedly received envoys from Song and Jin, but refused all summons. He told his disciples, “I fear the Song envoys will come again, which would be inconvenient. I observe purple qi shooting eastward; I intend to journey eastward.” He then took several disciples and went east. The Daoists of the palace wept and knelt, pleading for his return. Seeing their sincere grief, the master said, “Do not sorrow. I shall return within three years. You must strictly observe the pure rules, advance in virtue and deeds, and not disobey my instructions. I now depart.” The disciples escorted him for ten li before returning.

The master and his followers reached the provincial city of Shandong, where an ancient temple named Taichu Palace stood. The Perfected dwelt there. After three years, through the protection of the Dharma Guardian Tianran, the temple was rebuilt and renamed Tianchang Temple. Suddenly, Jin envoys came with tribute and summons. The master, knowing Jin’s end was near, refused to answer and returned to Chongfu Palace in Henan. The disciples greeted him joyfully. Zhao Xujing said, “After the master’s eastward departure, Song envoys came twice, but we all declined, saying we wandered beyond the world.” Qiu Changchun said, “While at Tianchang Temple, the Jin envoys also came with tribute and summons. How could I consent?”

While the master and disciples discussed affairs of state, a Tibetan monk arrived to pay respects. Qiu asked his purpose; it was the envoy of the Chan Master of the Snowy Mountains and White Clouds. The monk presented a letter. Qiu unfolded it, reading a request for the dao, explaining his own old age and weakness prevented him from personally seeking the immortal’s face. After reading, Qiu kept the envoy for several days, then wrote a reply to take back to the Snowy Mountains. It read:

> I have secretly heard that Shijia came east to seek the dao, and the West Indian attained perfection; Kasyapa crossed the Ganges to save beings, reaching the garden to hear the dharma. All followed bitter asceticism through the human gate, thoroughly realizing non-action and thus completion. The Golden Elixir and śarīra are essentially the same, differing only in name; to become Buddha or immortal, the words differ but the dao is one. The *Lotus Sutra* records the technique of the three carts crossing the pass, worthy of detailed study; the *Zhou Yi* reveals in hexagram ninety-two the secret of seeing the dragon, its principle clearly discerned. Even in my *Journey to the West*, yin and yang wax and wane, water-men return, lead and mercury unite, the cauldron and furnace’s fire timing—all are fully recorded. Now you are naturally skilled and able to verify, with some knowledge of fate and principle, best able to exhaust the elixir scriptures and further cultivate virtue and deeds. When功圆 and dao备, you will know that ultimate bliss is not far; when nature is seen and mind is bright, you will recognize that the humble hill is not distant. Reflect, reflect.

On the outside were the four characters “Written by Changchunzi.” The Tibetan monk was sent back to his country. The story pauses here.

Now it is told that Perfected Chen Cuixu, after parting with Bai Yuchan, journeyed north to Jiangyin. There was a farming family surnamed Sha, who delighted in charity and good deeds, accumulating dark功. Cuixu disguised himself as a mendicant and entered their home. Seeing someone inside turning a wheel, he composed this verse:

> All day turning round and round,  
> A path through the mud ball found.  
> Grinding on and on, who can say,  
> No axe or drill within its way.

After singing, a young man emerged, hurried forward, and bowed deeply. He said, “I am ignorant but have sought the dao sincerely for long. Today, meeting the Immortal Master here is my triple lifetime fortune. I beg the true master to save me; I shall never forget your grace.” Cuixu asked, “How do you know?” The youth said, “The master’s words are each a mystery; your spirit is clear and fresh, your eyes bright with essence. You cannot be the Pengying Immortal; you must be a celestial from the Jade Palace. How could you hide yourself?”

Cuixu knew he was a vessel of the dao and stayed two months, naming him Zhexu. First, he transmitted the dao of returning to origin and restoring fate, then taught the secret of the golden liquid and returning elixir. When parting, he said, “Jin will fall; Song will return to the mixed primal qi. Then you may go forth to walk the dao.” Zhexu begged for a future meeting. Chen said, “When your elixir is complete, go south; we shall meet at Mount Luofu. I will enter the Zhang River and dissolve.” Zhexu bowed and left, returning five li, then diligently cultivated the true dao at home, determined and unremitting. After five years, he naturally achieved the union of lead and mercury. The story pauses here.

In the summer of Guiyou, Jin changed its reign title to Zhenning. Yelü Liugo took the Liaodong prefectures and declared himself King of Liao. In May, the Mongols defeated Jin troops at Mount Jin. That autumn, Jin general Hushahu assassinated ruler Yongji, installed Prince Sheng to die with him. Sheng was the elder brother of Zhangzong, who became Xuanzong, changing the reign title to Zhenyou.

Now it is told that Perfected Tan Changzhen, after manifesting wonders in Western Shu, traveled widely to accumulate功. At this time, he came to Lin’an and saw a great fire burning half a day. The Perfected pitied the city and applied great wisdom-power to rescue it, reversing the wind and quenching the flames. Seeing the Song’s fate was near, he turned south to tour Jiangnan. Hearing that Qiu Changchun was teaching in Henan, widely spreading the sect’s style, and that his dao and virtue were renowned in many countries, Song and Jin had each summoned him several times, but he lay in deep repose and did not rise. Knowing the southern dynasty was to decline, he wisely refused the summons, truly a man who knew the moment, worthy to be a teacher for all ages. He wished to meet in the Central Plain, and so went to Chongfu Palace.

Qiu Changchun, having foreseen Tan’s arrival, sent disciples five li out to welcome him. Tan, knowing Changchun’s dao was lofty, came with his retinue to Chongfu Palace. Changchun came out to greet and led him into the abbot’s chamber. After mutual salutations, the assembly came to pay respects. Changchun said, “I have heard elder brother already attained dao and is a celestial immortal. Today your immortal carriage arrives here; truly rare indeed.” Tan then recounted his encounter in Western Shu, his attainment of dao, his travels and功, and waiting for summons. “Now hearing your dao and virtue surpass all, renowned in many countries, I am overjoyed and have come specially to meet.” Changchun said, “Brother’s功圆 and dao备, your ascension is certain. I, with thin virtue and deep sins, have no success in dao and fear the bitter rounds of reincarnation.” Tan laughed, “Brother’s功高 and purple mansion, virtue crowns Heaven and man. You convert the western barbarians, all call you the Living Buddha of Zhendan; you expound eastward to Jin and Song, all hail you the Perfected of Complete Virtue. Great vessels mature late; how can small功 and small行 compare?” Changchun said, “I am humbled by your praise; how dare I accept? I imagine your outward practice is complete and your inner fruit ripe. You need not toil or strain, and may stay here awaiting summons to ascend. What do you think?” Tan said, “I intend to go to Zhongnan to gather masters and friends; I cannot linger here. When brother’s功圆 and果满, we shall meet again. Now we part.” Changchun said, “You have just arrived; how can you leave so soon? Stay a few days. We have not seen each other for many years; there are many important words to discuss.” So Tan rested at Chongfu Palace for several days.

---

Tan took leave; Changchun wished to detain him but could not. He said, “Brother, on your journey you will surely see our master and elder brothers. Convey my many bows. Also, on your way you must pass the Western Peak. I have a disciple, Yin Qinghe, who dwells on Mount Shaohua in Huazhou. Please deliver a letter, and entrust him a few words for me.” Tan took the letter and bade farewell, heading toward Qin Chuan. Changchun and company escorted him for three li before returning.

The story pauses as Tan parted from Changchun and went west.

Now it is told of Yin Qinghe, a native of Longxi, who studied at home. One day he awakened to the illusory nature of worldly feelings and the vanity of affairs, and so abandoned his home to yearn for the dao, diligently seeking the mysterious. He came to Longmen Cave, where Changchun had just returned from the west. Qinghe sought instruction and gained a glimpse of the mysterious. He then traveled east to Chang’an, reaching the borders of Huazhou. Seeing Mount Shaohua’s pure and quiet beauty, he built a hut and cultivated bitterly, his nature and ground becoming clear.

One day, at leisure, he strolled about. Suddenly a Daoist friend floated down, his bearing immortal and spirit extraordinary. Qinghe thought, “This man is no Pengying celestial; surely a divine from the Three Isles.” He hurried forward and kowtowed, saying, “I have long observed the Perfected’s descent on the wild mountain, but come late to receive him. I beg forgiveness, master.”

Tan Changzhen saw this Daoist’s clear spirit and some immortal bone, and asked, “Are you not Yin Qinghe?” Qinghe replied, “To meet so suddenly, you know my name! Master, you truly are a Golden Immortal!” He quickly prostrated, “How fortunate I am to meet the Perfected today. I beg you open your heart to universal salvation and save me from suffering. Please point out a thread of mystery so I may advance on the true path. If I attain the great dao in the future, I shall never forget your grace.”

Tan stepped forward, helping him up. “You have already received Changchun’s instructions. Though you have not attained the dao, the returning elixir is in sight. Yesterday I passed through Songshan’s Chongfu Palace and met your master, who entrusted me with a letter for you. You should open it; it will surely benefit you. If mysteries remain unclear, you may seek the master’s guidance another day. Do not worry; your attainment is certain.” He then took a letter from his bosom and gave it to Qinghe. “I should stay here to discuss the dao with you and exhaust the mysteries, but I must go to Zhongnan on urgent business and cannot delay. You must diligently cultivate and accumulate功勋. We part here; we shall meet again.” Then he floated away.

Qinghe wished to stay but could not. He bowed and escorted him for three li, then silently turned back to his hut, filled with sorrow and loss. Truly:

> If your will is not firm, do not speak of the dao,  
> If your dust-laden heart is unclean, do not discuss the mysterious.  
> If you desire fame and profit as real,  
> How can you ascend to the Nine Heavens?

To learn what became of Yin Qinghe, await the next chapter’s unfolding.
