# Chapter Nineteen: The Mongol Emperor Issues an Edict Seeking the Dao and Virtue — Qiu Changchun Speaks Before the Court on the Profound

A Poem:

In times when men forsake the mundane, seeking depths profound,  
One ought to fix the mind and delve with earnest care.  
Set your will not on treasures beyond the flesh,  
But keep the heart to grasp the lead within the water’s lair.  
功 without 道, a guest of dusty realms;  
道 without 功, an immortal bound to earth’s fields.  
If you refine the elixir and accumulate virtue both,  
What fear to ascend the Great Luo Heaven’s folds?

Now it happened that Yin Qinghe, after seeing the Immortal Tan depart, turned back to his humble cottage, as if entranced and intoxicated. Sitting a while, he unfolded the letter from his master and read:

“Generally, to cultivate the self and discern the dao, one must rely on accumulating deeds and gathering功. Without a bitter and steadfast heart, it is hard to transcend the ordinary and the sage. Some apply功 within teachings, stirring up worldly toil; others begin within the heart’s depths, casting away all worldly affairs. Yet, if one can master self-restraint and keep the heart on the dao, this is the very foundation of blessing.

But the dao encompasses Heaven and Earth, vast and unfathomable; small virtues and功 are difficult to show effect. Thus, the dao is grasped in a flash of awakening, yet must be forged through long kalpas of refining; sudden enlightenment of one heart requires perfecting myriad practices. Today’s awakening is but the fruit of功 from former lives. Yet those unaware of past causes see only the long years of bitter striving without success, deem the profound功 false, and so fall into retreat—how regrettable! They do not know that in walking, standing, sitting, and lying, keeping the heart on the dao, though the moment’s mind is not yet revealed, it is because功 and deeds have not yet accumulated enough. The incompleteness of the dao is like a man holding a precious bright pearl worth a million coins, yet lacking sufficient money to buy it; one must labor day and night, be frugal and diligent, gathering wealth little by little. Even when reaching thirty or fifty thousand coins, still not enough; only when the full million is amassed can the pearl be purchased. The gathered money is but a means for use in urgent times. Compared to a poor household, the gap is as cloud to mud. So it is with accumulating功 and deeds. Though the dao is not yet attained, the roots of goodness are deep and heavy; whether in this life or the next, surely sages will raise you up, and naturally the day of attaining the dao will come. Without such past affinities and roots of goodness, how far is the seeking? Only when encountering hardship does one lose heart; seeing wealth and honor, greed arises—though one be a god or immortal, they cannot save you. But if one bears bitter resolve and practices diligently without slackening, with unwavering heart, if not attained this life, then in the next, through many lives of cultivation, the immortals will surely aid, until complete realization.

I have no past bones of affinity; though meeting bright masters, through myriad hardships I remain unresolved. The likes of Danyang Changzhen and others all possess such past affinities; thus within ten or five years they soar freely beyond Heaven. Though I remain unresolved, the hardships I endure differ from ordinary men. The Patriarch said: ‘All who pursue the dao first abandon family, then abandon body.功 incomplete, illness befalls and teaches another illness; dao not perfected, death comes and teaches another death. At death’s final moment, embrace the dao and depart, leaving fate to Heaven, unable to rely on self-strength.’ These are the highest words; students should examine them carefully.”

When Qinghe finished reading, he sighed deeply. From then on, his thoughts of the dao increased,功 and merit accumulated, morning and evening he practiced diligently, seeking the proof of profound功; never forgetting the furnace of refining the elixir. He opened the single gate to receive the many, guiding earnest seekers; gathering herbs to aid the world, broadly benefiting the sick. Coming and going through bustling markets or remote mountains, he held only a heart to benefit people and things, unafraid of hardship; only the will to cook lead and refine mercury, pondering the vanity of the dusty realm. Thus he practiced for over ten years, never claiming a seat, eating no delicacies. Later he met Immortal Lady Geng, who saw his complete austerity and imparted the supreme dao; sitting in stillness three years, he saw his original nature. The alchemical dao was perfected, and he traveled to convert all according to their capacity. No more to relate here.

Meanwhile, the Mongol Temüjin, in the autumn of the Guiyou year, advanced his troops to Yanjing, taking Zhuozhou, and stationed his forces at Yan. Having long heard the name of Qiu Chuji, he wished to summon him to inquire of the dao. After fasting and purification for seven days, he issued an imperial edict, thus:

“An edict: Heaven loathes the Central Plains, disdainful of the nature of the Great Ultimate; I dwell in the northern wilds, cherishing the unarisen feelings of desire. Returning to simplicity and purity, abandoning extravagance for frugality, each garment and meal I share with oxen, herdsmen, and stable hands alike. I regard the people as newborn babes, nourish the soldiers as brothers. I plan for lasting peace, think of steady accumulation. I train my myriad masses, leading them by example; before a hundred battles, I think not of myself last. Within seven years great achievements are made; within the six directions, all is unified. If not by my virtuous conduct, then the governance of the Jin would not be constant. Thus I receive Heaven’s favor and attain respect. To the south, the Manchu Song; to the north, the Huihe; east, the Xia; west, the barbarians—all pay tribute and serve. I think of my Khanate, for a thousand generations never before such.

Yet to entrust great governors and maintain peace, I still fear gaps. Like hollowing a boat and carving oars to cross rivers, or selecting worthy aides to pacify the world. Since I took the throne, I have labored diligently in all affairs, yet among the three nine ranks, no fitting person appears. I have heard of Master Qiu, a man of true essence who walks the rules, broad in knowledge, probing mysteries and exhausting principles; his dao is pure and his virtue manifest. He holds the solemn spirit of the ancient sages, embraces the refined conduct of the true immortal, dwelling long in mountain valleys, hiding voice and form, expounding the Patriarch’s legacy. Daoist worthies gather along the immortal path, countless beyond number. Since the wars, I know the master still hides in the old lands of Shandong; my heart reveres him endlessly. Have I not heard of the shared carriage at the Weishui and the thrice-visited thatched cottage? Yet the mountains and rivers are vast, and I have failed to pay proper respects in person. I but avoid my position and step aside, fasting and bathing, selecting the attendant Liu Zhonglu to prepare light horse and plain carriage, traveling thousands of li without complaint, respectfully inviting the master, humbly asking him to set aside immortal ease, not minding desert and distance, whether out of concern for the people’s present affairs or solicitude for my own safety. I will personally attend the immortal seat, earnestly hoping the master will, with but a cough or a word, grant a single teaching—that will suffice.

Now I send forth this faint intention, hoping the master will understand this edict, and sincerely hope the master will expound the great dao’s essentials, responding well to all, and not deny the small wishes of all beings. Thus I issue this edict, that it be known.”

Dated the first day of the fifth month.

Having completed the edict, he commanded Liu Zhonglu to bear it and depart. The journey’s dust and wind are not recounted here.

Meanwhile, Master Qiu resided at Chongfu Palace, seeing the numinous wind grow strong and the religion flourish. One day, upon ascending the hall to lecture on dao and virtue, he addressed the multitude:

“Life in this world is like fish swimming in water, carefree and at ease; yet seeking fame and profit is like fish swallowing a hook, unaware of illusion. Once caught on the hook, when the knife strikes and the cauldron boils, regret comes too late! If you do not quickly turn back and examine yourself, time flies swiftly, and in a moment all is impermanent. Now I see you have already left the world, yet refuse to practice功 and cultivate the dao, sitting idle giving alms, not speaking of failure in this life’s dao, and the debtors of the next life hard to repay. There is yet another kind, who do not believe in the cause and effect of sin and blessing, who leave the world only to create more faults, falling ill and suffering, yet never awakening repentance, instead slandering others—their guilt is heavier still. Such will fall into hell at death with no release.

Those who cultivate the self must first broaden learning then restrain principle; first collect the heart then release the heart. Broad learning means seeing widely, understanding human relations and worldly ways; restraining principle means purging selfishness, grasping the source of nature and life’s creation. Collecting the heart means cutting off passions and desires, cleansing杂念, so thoughts do not arise; releasing the heart means not letting the mind fall into illusion or emptiness, lest it be bound and caught by the demon of attachment, but letting it enter the realm of great void, awaiting the work of creation. The saying goes: exhaust principle and nature to reach life’s mandate, then one can nourish life, protect the body, roam the Jade Capital and Golden Palace, and ride alongside the Void Sovereign.

Today’s people do not understand human relations and worldly ways, yet seek the heavenly dao; this is like the blind refusing a staff, the deaf listening to music, entering water to catch rabbits, climbing mountains to seek fish—how can they succeed? The way of human relations is no more than what Huang Shigong said: ‘Dao, virtue, benevolence, righteousness, and ritual are one body.’ Dao is the path humans tread, making all things unaware of their source. Virtue is what humans gain, letting all things obtain their desires. Benevolence is what humans cherish, with a heart of kindness and compassion to fulfill creation. Righteousness is what humans ought to do, rewarding good and punishing evil, establishing功 and affairs. Ritual is what humans observe, rising early and sleeping late to form the order of human relations. To be the root of humanity, none may be lacking.

The wise and superior person understands the way of rise and fall, the numbers of success and failure, the forces of peace and disorder, the principles of coming and going. Thus they dwell hidden, embracing the dao, awaiting their time. When the time comes to act, they can reach the highest rank of minister; seizing the opportunity, they can achieve peerless功. If not encountered, they perish. Therefore their dao is lofty and their name honored by later generations. Such words reveal the way of human relations. Once human relations are clear, the heavenly dao is not far.”

As Qiu Changchun spoke, suddenly a messenger entered: “A Mongol envoy has arrived.” The master descended and welcomed him. Liu Zhonglu, seeing the master’s extraordinary bearing, hurried forward to pay respects, and together they entered the guest hall, seating host and guest separately. Qiu asked, “May I ask your lordship’s origin? What noble business brings you to the old capital?” Liu Zhonglu replied, “Your servant’s surname is Liu, given name Zhonglu. I now bear the imperial edict of our lord, Emperor Genghis Khan, summoning Master Qiu to journey north. Our lord sincerely seeks the dao and wise men, having long heard of Master Qiu’s lofty dao and virtue; thus he specially commands me to bring this edict here. I humbly beg Master to grant consent, so as not to disappoint our lord’s earnest intent.” Then he presented the imperial edict.

Master Qiu took the edict, opened and read it through, then said to Liu Zhonglu, “I am but a rustic man of the mountains and fields; now honored by the sovereign, I feel ashamed and wonder how I might bear this?” Liu Zhonglu said, “Master’s dao crowns the three powers, virtue surpasses nine ranks, your name spreads through many lands,功 shines among the masses. Your servant has long admired you; now to behold your immortal countenance, why should Master modestly decline?” Changchun said, “Though my empty fame spreads throughout the realm, I truly feel ashamed. Previously, the three embassies of Jin and five of Song all went unanswered. Now, seeing the sovereign’s sincerity and your high rank’s descent, I cannot disobey. Please rest three days in the open palace; I will respond to the edict and accompany you to Yanjing.” Liu Zhonglu rejoiced at the master’s consent and stayed at Chongfu Palace awaiting the journey. No more to relate.

Master Qiu arranged all affairs at his residence clearly, inside and out. Unconsciously, three days passed. Liu Zhonglu urged the master to depart. Previously, the three embassies from Jin and five from Song had lain dormant; the disciples asked the master why. The master said, “My coming and going is Heaven’s will, not for you to know. One day there will be a time when I cannot be held back.” So, answering the edict, he journeyed north; the disciples wept, sending him off for ten li before returning. It was the height of summer’s wavering heat, a dusty road. No more to relate.

In the sixth month, Jin Qihe in Mongolia and Temüjin’s troops withdrew to the desert, leaving Yanjing. Master Qiu and Liu Zhonglu traveled together, arriving at Yanjing in the seventh month. Suddenly they heard the sovereign had returned north. Master Qiu discussed with Liu Zhonglu: “I see the sovereign has already returned north; the road is long and several days will pass before I can meet him. Moreover, the weather is hot; I am old and weak, unable to travel. Let us stay in Yanjing until autumn cools before heading north. What does your lordship think?” Liu Zhonglu said, “Our lord thirsts for the wise as if parched; how can he wait?” Qiu said, “Since you will not allow delay, I truly cannot go; I must submit a memorial myself.” So he wrote a memorial and gave it to two palace attendants, then departed north. Liu Zhonglu, seeing the master submit the memorial, dared not obstruct or urge, but left him in Yanjing awaiting reply. No more to relate.

Meanwhile, Emperor Genghis Khan, having accepted Jin’s peace, withdrew his troops to the Xilingol League, stationing to raise horses. One day, two attendants brought Master Qiu’s memorial to the emperor. The emperor opened and read:

“Emperor Genghis Khan’s heartfelt words: Qiu Chuji of Qixia County in Dengzhou, respectfully receiving the imperial command, summoned from afar, a humble man of the sea’s edge, whose heart is all confusion. Chuji reflects on his poor skill in livelihood, no success in the dao, bitter hardships without end, old yet not dead. Though his name spreads among nations, the dao does not increase among the masses. Looking inward, he grieves; who can fathom his heart? Previously, multiple summons from Nanjing and the Song kingdom went unanswered; now, a single call from the Dragon Court and he comes—why so?

I hear the emperor is Heaven-bestowed with courage and wisdom, unmatched past and present, dao aligned with numinous power, all Hua and Yi submit. Therefore he wishes to flee to mountains and seas, unwilling to disobey. Often braving snow and frost to seek but a glimpse, also hearing the carriage is only north of Huanfu. Upon arriving at Yanjing, hearing the carriage returned, far off thousands of li of dust and wind, and with weather yellow and wan, old and weak, unable to arrive, he defers to the emperor’s military affairs beyond his ability. The heart of dao and virtue warns against desire; all is difficult. Thus he and Liu Zhonglu conferred to stay awhile in Yanjing, first sending word ahead. Liu Zhonglu did not agree, so the master submitted the memorial himself. Considering Chuji’s empty fame, haggard face, and withered form, I humbly seek your wise judgment.”

The emperor finished reading, knowing Master Qiu had come to Yanjing but was hindered by heat from going north. He then issued another edict, selecting attendant Gu Yuan to bear it to Yanjing. Gu first met the master and presented the reply. Master Qiu unfolded and read:

“Emperor Genghis Khan’s edict to Master Qiu: Your memorial and arrival in response to the summons are fully known. Your dao surpasses the three powers, your virtue weighs on many sides. I command my ministers to carry your profound radiance, swiftly searching the seas. When wishes align, Heaven does not oppose man. Though summoned many times by two courts, you did not go; but a single invitation made you rise. This shows my heavenly mandate, so I may return in person, not fearing exposure to wind and frost, willingly crossing the desert. Your memorial brings joy and comfort beyond words! Military affairs are not my concern; the heart of dao and virtue is truly to be honored. I, faced with rebellious chieftains, have employed generals; tested troops and pacified borders. Coming and going depends on strength; long rest and brief toil, hoping for submission before stopping. Thus I spread my mighty virtue, briefly halting my carriage. I deeply consider that the cloud pavilion set forth from Penglai, the crane carriage can roam to Tianzhu. Bodhidharma went east, transmitting the mind by the original seal; Laozi went west, perhaps transforming barbarians and attaining the dao. Though the road through Sichuan is broad, looking to my staff, it is not far. Awaiting your reply, to clarify my intent. In the autumn heat, may the master be safe in Beiping; no more words. Dated the fourteenth day of the eighth month.”

Master Qiu read this and said to Gu Yuan, “Now it is the Double Ninth Festival; the heat has passed and delay is no longer possible, lest the cold wind suddenly arrive. I choose the full moon day of the ninth month to depart. Please inform Liu Zhonglu.” Gu Yuan took leave of Master Qiu and went to Liu Zhonglu, arranging the date to travel north together. They traveled by day and rested by night, arriving in the capital in early winter. Liu Zhonglu first reported back and settled Master Qiu in lodgings. It was said:

The dao is lofty, all under Heaven gaze in admiration;  
Virtue is weighty, ten thousand people enjoy great peace.  
Westward transforming barbarians, eastward proclaiming teaching,  
The numinous wind henceforth stirs the great capital.
