# Chapter Twenty: Sun Geng of Gezao Mountain Refines the Elixir — Baisha of Chongxu Monastery Escorts Ni

Verse says:

To learn the dao, profound and more profound;  
To reach the ultimate way, refining mercury and lead.  
Emperors repeatedly ask the secret of longevity,  
Breath flowing unceasing, continuous and long.  
Inner and outer elixirs ascend to the Nine Heavens,  
Merit perfected, all hasten to the Peach Banquet.  
From then on, the assembly of immortals at Penglai and Ying,  
Naturally leap beyond the Three Thousand.

(The tune: “Descending Mountain Tiger”)

Now, as for Master Qiu Zhenren resting in his quarters, when the full moon day arrived, the Emperor summoned him to the traveling palace. The Emperor, with care, said: “Master, having journeyed far, do you possess any elixir of longevity to offer me?” Master Qiu replied: “I have no elixir of longevity, only the dao of nurturing life.” The Emperor praised his honesty and arranged to inquire further on the eighth day of the twelfth lunar month. Master Qiu then retired to his quarters.

At this time, the Emperor wished to personally campaign against the mountain bandits.

On the full moon day of the first lunar month, the Emperor held a banquet in a side hall, setting a vacant seat in front to honor Master Qiu’s place. The Emperor descended the steps himself, bowed deeply, and respectfully asked about the dao of nurturing life. The Master invited the Emperor to sit again and listen attentively. Master Qiu said:

“The Great Dao gives birth to Heaven and nurtures Earth; the sun, moon, stars, ghosts, spirits, and all beings arise from the dao. Heaven is yang; Earth is yin. Humans dwell between, carrying yin and embracing yang. Therefore, those who study the dao abandon extravagance, frugality, and desire; they firmly conserve essence and calm the spirit. As yin diminishes and yang remains whole, they ascend to Heaven and become immortals.

“The foolish take falsehood as norm, drink wine as nectar, indulge their desires, wasting essence and harming spirit. Yang declines while yin flourishes; at death, they sink into Earth and become ghosts. Cultivators of truth are like rolling a stone uphill—the higher the mountain, the harder the ascent. A single misstep undoes all progress. Because of this difficulty, the world scarcely dares to undertake it.

“Originally, true nature is still like unmoving water. But when the eye delights in colors, the ear in sounds, the tongue craves flavors, the mind clings to affairs, thoughts arise in confusion like winds stirring waves. Those who learn the dao refine their hearts, attaching to nothing, diminishing again and again until reaching non-action, resembling the vast empty still water.

“The body of the daoist is but a vessel; governing the heart is most difficult. Heaven governs the vast seas; the sun commands myriad affairs—how easy is it to govern the heart? Ancients, upon establishing heirs and taking wives, warned to restrain desire. For life beyond forty, blood and qi gradually decline; thus, restraint is fitting. Now Your Majesty is advanced in years; you should cultivate virtue and preserve your body to prolong your days.

“Taking medicine is not as good as solitary rest. Medicines are herbs; their essence forms bones and marrow. To dry bones and marrow and add herbs is like storing gold in a pouch and exchanging it for iron—over time, the gold is gone, leaving only iron. What benefit is there? Eating, drinking, rising, and resting, as well as treasured goods, should all follow moderation, not exceeding limits.

“All the beautiful lands under Heaven belong to Your Majesty, yet wars follow one after another, scattering the people. Select the pure among officials to plan and manage, measure and exempt taxes, so the army and state have sufficient silk and cloth, the common folk may revive and rest. One effort yields two gains. This is the great essence of praying for blessings and long life.”

The Emperor was greatly pleased, ordered the attendants to record these words on a tablet, and respectfully thanked the Master before retiring.

The next day, the Emperor asked about thunder and lightning. The Master replied: “I have heard that among the three thousand sins, none is greater than unfilialness; Heaven thus warns us. Now hearing that many in the realm are unfilial, Your Majesty, riding on your majestic virtue, can admonish the people.” The Emperor was delighted and spread the Master’s words throughout the land.

---

On the seventh day of the second lunar month, Master Qiu prepared to take leave. The Emperor said: “Please wait a few days. Some of your teachings I have yet to understand; when I have comprehended them, I will permit your departure.” That month, the Emperor went hunting on the Eastern Mountain, shooting a great boar. His horse lost control of its hoof; the boar stood nearby, not daring to advance. The attendants urged the horse forward, and after the hunt, they returned.

Master Qiu heard this and advised: “The Way of Heaven loves life. Now that Your Majesty’s sacred years are advanced, you should hunt less. The fall from the horse is a heavenly warning; the boar’s hesitation is Heaven’s protection.” The Emperor said: “I have deeply reflected.” Then he turned to his ministers: “Since the immortals advise me thus, I will follow from now on.” From then on, he ceased hunting.

---

Master Changchun’s heart was settled. On the seventh day of the third lunar month, he again took leave at court. The Emperor said: “Master’s heart is not yet at rest; I dare not detain you. But the principles of self-cultivation and governing the realm I have not fully grasped. I beseech you to instruct me in a few points. If the body is cultivated, it will be free from suffering; if the realm is governed, the people will enjoy peace. Heaven’s heart in accord, all things flourish. When the people are safe and the land abundant, the realm is at peace; when body and mind are at ease, the spirits are tranquil. How then shall I govern?”

Master Qiu replied: “To cultivate the body is to nourish qi for longevity; to communicate with the numinous is to nurture the spirit. Without nourishing primordial qi, one cannot live long; without nourishing primordial spirit, one cannot communicate with the numinous. To cultivate the body, one must preserve essence, nurture qi, and embrace spirit. Only then can essence be sufficient without lust, qi sufficient without craving food, spirit sufficient without sleep. With these Three Treasures complete, wind, cold, heat, and dampness cannot enter; epidemics, evil spirits, and calamities cannot harm. When body and mind are at ease, disease does not arise; when spirit and qi intertwine, disasters cannot invade. With deep roots and firm foundation, one attains the dao of long life and enduring vision.

“To govern a realm is the same. Regard spirit as ruler, qi as ministers, essence as the people, and the body as the state. When the ruler understands Heaven’s heart and follows its course, officials are pure and the people at peace. When the people are safe, the realm is rich; when ministers are virtuous, the realm is strong. Nothing surpasses governing the realm and cultivating the body thus.

“Now Your Majesty dwells in the seat of ten thousand chariots, always putting yourself first, braving arrows and stones. Thus your body is lighter than all under Heaven. This is what it means to preserve the body—not to dwell in harm. You must be cautious.”

The Emperor was greatly pleased and said: “Master’s words are all gold and jade. I have deeply reflected.” He bestowed abundant gifts, which Master Qiu declined. The Emperor ordered Ali Xian to escort the Master eastward; those who saw them off wept in farewell.

---

On the road, Master Qiu passed through Juyong and encountered a swarm of bandits. Ali Xian wanted to draw his sword to fight, but the Master stopped him: “No need for weapons; I fear harming life. I will transform them with words—that will suffice.” Sitting atop the carriage, the Master cupped his hands and said to the bandits:

“I am a daoist from the south, sent by imperial edict into Mongolia, now returning south. I have no gold, silver, or treasures, only the escort of officers. They wish to fight on horseback but fear harming life, so I have stopped them.

“I have heard that to be a bandit requires seven qualities: dao, virtue, benevolence, righteousness, propriety, wisdom, and faith. Only if all seven are complete can one be called a great bandit. Lacking even one, one is not truly a bandit.

“To live without dao, this body will not last; to act against virtue, gods and men alike will despise you. The gods hate those who rebel; Heaven’s heart is not pleased; life is hard to keep. Why be a bandit?

“A great bandit establishes himself on the dao, follows Heaven’s heart, cultivates the people with virtue, and never turns his heart away. He harms no innocent, regards all beings as infants—this is benevolence. He rescues those in distress, treats strangers as kin—this is righteousness. He rewards and punishes clearly, upholds chastity and human relations—this is propriety. He faces many with few, wins in danger—this is wisdom. His words fly like arrows, promises kept without delay, never regrets—this is faith.

“All bandits who embody these seven words can preserve themselves and establish a name, careful to the end as at the start, and will not fail. Robbing the rich to give to the poor accumulates merit; striking down the violent to aid the needy cultivates virtue. Living without a foul name, dying as a just spirit, all will respect and admire you, your fragrant name lasting ten thousand generations. Is this not joyful?

“You all should emulate this—why alone not?”

The bandits heard the Master’s words, bowed their heads in praise, and said: “This is a man of the dao, whose words are like gold and jade; all should believe them.” They thanked him and departed.

Master Qiu journeyed south to Shandong’s Qizhou at Tianchang Monastery to reside, then sent Ali Xian back north to submit the imperial edict. No further record.

Meanwhile, Ma Danyang, together with Sun Bu’er and Geng Xiangu, had parted from Master Lüzu at Zhongnan Mountain. Danyang used thirteen needles to treat illnesses, restoring youth and saving lives, traveling widely to perform merit and transform according to circumstances. No further record.

Geng Xiangu and Sun Bu’er often gathered herbs in the mountains to aid the world. Once, while roaming Mount Heng of the Southern Peaks, gathering herbs at Huiyan Peak, they met Lady Wei, who led them into the Great Void Cavern of Heaven, where they paid respects to Lord Wei, the Guardian True Spirit. Lord Wei commanded Lord Cui Yu of the Support Calamity Mansion to host a banquet, inviting the Immortal Consort Zhu Ling and Lady Ding Shuying to accompany, and ordered the fairy maidens to play music.

Sun and Geng stepped forward to bow and thank, saying: “We are ignorant and lowly, newly entered the ranks of immortals. Thanks to Lady Wei’s guidance into the immortal mansion and the chance to see the Supreme Truth, we are deeply grateful. To be further honored with this grand feast and seats, we dare not accept!”

Lord Wei said: “Though you are newly entered into the sacred stream, you will surely become leaders among the female immortals. Your inner elixirs are complete, but your outer practices are insufficient. You must rely on the outer elixir to assist; only then will the elixir be perfected, merit fulfilled, and you may respond to the summons to ascend.”

The two immortals earnestly requested the secrets of the outer elixir. Lord Wei pointed and said: “The outer elixir’s workings and timing are the same as the inner elixir; they must correspond inside and out, differing only in the weights and measures of the ingredients and their refining. For those whose inner elixir is incomplete, cultivation is difficult. Now that your inner elixirs are complete, cooking the outer elixir is easy.” He then bestowed the weights and measures of the ingredients and the methods of extraction, addition, and refining.

Sun and Geng bowed to thank Lord Wei, Lady Ding, Lady Wei, and others. Lady Wei escorted them out of the cavern, awaiting their elixir’s completion for reunion.

---

Sun and Geng bade farewell to Lady Wei and gathered herbs on Mount Heng. Descending the mountain, they forged furnaces and cauldrons. Upon reaching the territory of Linjiang Prefecture, they saw Gezao Mountain, clear and elegant, the thirty-fourth blessed land under Heaven, the immortal capital of the Nine Provinces, the exalted mansion of the Great Historian Xu Xun, the Mysterious True Lord of the Middle Profundity.

Sun and Geng ascended the mountain, selecting a day of pure yang and correct fire, setting up the furnace and cauldron. Arranging the ingredients according to the Eight Trigrams and cardinal directions, they started the fire and refined. Adjusting the fire’s timing, after forty-nine days, the elixir was perfected.

After consuming the elixir, the two immortals felt their inner and outer passages clear. They stored the remaining elixir in a pot, descended the mountain, and continued accumulating merit wherever they went, again encountering Lady Wei in Xiangzhou.

The two immortals greeted her with bows. Lady Wei said to Sun Bu’er: “You may accumulate merit and await summons. Geng Xiangu may accompany me as a companion to tour Mount Jiuyi.” Sun Bu’er bowed and saw them off. Lady Wei said: “You will meet Ma Danyang and others at Zhongnan, gather the seven golden lotuses, and follow the Master’s orders. In the future, you shall meet at the Jade Pool.” Thus they parted.

Master Bu’er, seeing Lady Wei take Geng Xiangu to tour Jiuyi, then journeyed east to accumulate merit. No further record.

Meanwhile, Bai Yuchan, having received four hundred characters from Master Ziyang, journeyed to Mount Wuyi to cultivate. Upon attaining the dao, he wandered clouds and mists, accumulating merit for several years, and now returned to dwell at Wuyi.

The common folk on this mountain knew nothing of Bai Yuchan’s attainment of the Purple Azure Clear Dao. Only Zhan Yanfu of the southern mountain knew, and he rebuilt the Zhizhi Hermitage, hoping to invite the Master to reside. The Master wrote a record, citing unfinished travels as excuse, promising to return in five years.

At first, when Master Bai entered Wuyi, he had no protector or companion. Suddenly, a virtuous gentleman named Peng Lü, styled Jiyi, appeared. He was from the Three Mountains region, sharp and wise from youth, fond of daoist books. At thirty-two, after passing the imperial examination, he abandoned home to pursue the dao, diligently exploring the profound. He disliked the court’s finery and pomp, preferring purity, emptiness, ease, and freedom.

He roamed Wuyi, saw the Master’s dao, and served him for several years. After Bai Yuchan’s elixir was complete, the dao passed to Peng Lü. After receiving the Master’s transmission, he parted ways and dwelled in the Crane Forest Daoist Monastery, renaming himself Crane Forest. After years of cultivation, he attained the dao and passed the elixir teachings to Xiao Tingzhi, styled Tianlai, a native of Minzhong. Having received the Crane Forest dao, he called himself Zixu.

Peng Crane Forest thereafter manifested wonders everywhere, his marvels unfathomable. Later, weary of the world, he passed away seated in Fuzhou, with Xiao Zixu attending. This is a later tale, not recorded here.

In the year of Jiaxu, the Jin ruler moved the capital to Bianjing and requested tribute from Song. Song minister Liu Shan refused the gold tribute. That year, Yue Ke, grandson of Yue Fei and son of Yue Lin, wrote the “History of Cheng,” “Collection of Refutations,” and “Records of Heaven’s Decree,” presenting them to the Song Emperor.

In the summer of Yihai year, Mongol Temüjin reentered Yanjing. Song appointed De Xiu as Deputy Transport Commissioner of Jiangdong; he was from Pucheng. His eldest son, named Jingyuan, was fond of the dao from youth, once dwelling in a hut on Jiahe West Mountain, dreaming of the Purple Mansion, paying homage to the Great Emperor of the Supreme Pole, and receiving the record of merits and faults. Upon awakening, he recorded it and styled himself Youxuanzi, naming his hut Huizhen, with a hall called Wuyouxuan. Later, he authored “Expanded Meanings of the Great Learning,” which circulated widely.

In the year Dingchou, Jin changed the era name to Xingding.

In the year Wuyin, Jin raised troops to attack Song. Song generals Meng Zongzheng, Hu Zaixing, and Xu Guo fought together, causing the Jin army to rout. The Jin feared Meng Zongzheng’s reputation, calling him “Grandfather Meng.”

In the year Jiǎmǎo, Song envoy Zhao Fang led Meng Zongzheng, Hu Zaixing, and Xu Guo in divided attacks on Jin. Mongol commander Muhuali received orders to seize Shandong, Shanxi, and other places.

In the year Gengchen, Mongols appointed Shi Tianni as acting commander of Hebei’s western forces. Shi Tianni had studied under Master Qiu Changchun and still cherished love for the people. Meeting with Muhuali, he said: “These past few years, soldiers and bandits have followed one after another; the people have no place to dwell. Now the Central Plains are roughly pacified, but the army plunders again. This is not the king’s duty to remove violence and save the people. The Great Commander must consider this carefully.” Muhuali heeded Shi Tianni’s words, felt ashamed, and ordered a ban on plundering; violators were executed on the spot, and old and young captives were sent home. The army’s advance saw all prefectures, districts, and counties surrender. This was all due to Master Changchun’s daoist transformation.

---

Meanwhile, the Mongol ruler sought the dao, searching for sages and talents. He found Liao man Yelü Lü’s son, Chucun, and appointed him close at hand for consultation. Yelü Chucun was versed in arts and numbers, especially in astronomy and calendars, establishing the Gengwu Yuan calendar. He often said: “Song’s qi and fortune humbly receive Heaven’s mandate; virtue shines and will rise again.” He also said: “Northern and southern worthy commanders and the rulers of Xia and Jin will suffer disaster.” This was later fulfilled.

In the year Xinyi, Song generals Zhao Fang and An Bing died.

In the year Renwu, the Mongol ruler personally campaigned against the Western Huihui, destroying their state. The army reached Xindu, broke the Iron Gate Pass. The guards saw a beast—deer-shaped with a horse’s tail, green with a single horn—speaking human words: “Why do you not return early!” Having spoken, it vanished like the wind. The Emperor was perplexed and asked Chucai, who said: “This beast’s horn tip travels one hundred and eight thousand li daily and understands the languages of the four barbarians. Its words portend killing and destruction; Heaven sent this beast to warn Your Majesty. You should pardon these several peoples’ lives to accumulate boundless blessings.” Hearing this, the Emperor immediately withdrew his forces.

In the year Guiwei, Mongol commander Muhuali died. The Xia ruler Shenzong passed the throne to Crown Prince Dewang, becoming Emperor Xianzong, changing the era to Qianding. That year, the Jin ruler died; his son Shouxu ascended, becoming Emperor Aizong.

In the year Jiashen spring, Jin changed the era to Zhengda. Hearing of Jin’s ruler’s death, Song generals planned to attack Jin during mourning. Minister of Rites Cui Yuzhi advised: “The southern transport is not yet smooth; attacking now may bring misfortune.” So they halted. Cui Yuzhi, knowing the Emperor’s end was near, resigned and returned to Guangzhou to live in seclusion.

Meanwhile, Chen Niwan Zhenren journeyed north and returned to reside at Mount Luofu in Huizhou. One day, he sighed deeply: “Emperors and ministers all have their end. I have dwelt long in the world—what benefit is there?” At this time, Bai Yuchan and Sha Zhexu came to pay respects. Niwan joyfully said: “You two know me as well?” Bai Sha replied: “Master having completed his journey and ascended, we two disciples met unbidden, coming specially to bid farewell.” Niwan said: “Your immortal ranks are already high; soon you will meet at Penglai.” After speaking, he invited the two to ascend the mountain to observe the sun. At midnight, a golden radiance and rosy clouds appeared; the sun revolved forth—a wondrous spectacle. Returning to the pavilion, Cui Xu sat upright and composed a hymn to the sun:

“Thunder crashes atop the head,  
Primordial chaos falls to earth without trace.  
Today the path is found,  
Riding a hornless fire dragon.”

Having finished the chant, he transformed. Bai Yuchan and the others heard celestial music in the void, saw splendid retinues, and ascended to Heaven. The crowd bowed in farewell. The next day, their mortal forms were gone, transformed into twelve elixir pellets of mud. No one dared bury them. Later, those who fell ill scraped and took them, all recovering immediately. The Master’s work “Collection on Awakening to the Dao” circulated in the world.

---

Bai Yuchan and Zhexu, seeing their Master’s transformation and the marvels beyond measure, took leave of the crowd and descended the mountain. Zhexu bowed farewell to Bai Yuchan and journeyed west to Mount Emei and Qingcheng, renaming himself Daozhao, practicing merit and aiding the world.

Truly:

Ascending in broad daylight is no difficulty;  
I urge you to hasten in refining the Golden Elixir.  
With firm heart and earnest will, study diligently,  
And carefully preserve the true constant.
