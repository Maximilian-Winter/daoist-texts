# Chapter Twenty-One: Zhang Daoqing of Jiugong Mountain Transcends by Sitting; Changchunzi of Baiyun Temple

Verse:  
To sit and transform, immortals wander by fate’s design,  
Let none obscure the original truth divine.  
In emptiness and nothingness, the profound primordial principle is grasped,  
In void and stillness, clarity and freedom of the self are clasped.  
Countless heavenly spirits ever guard and attend,  
Through the vast cosmos, they freely roam and wend.  
Worldly dust draws many seekers to the path,  
Truly, they transcend the mundane and enter the sage’s craft.

Now, it is told that Bai Ziqing departed from Luofu, inviting companions to roam Lin’an. The Song Emperor, hearing this, summoned him and assigned him lodging at the Taiyi Palace. Before half a year passed, in drunken revelry, he fell into the waters of West Lake and departed. Later, he appeared again in Haifeng County. Subsequently, at Gusu Terrace, while chanting to the plum blossoms, he was met by Niwan, who invited him to return once more to Wuyi Mountain, fulfilling the five-year pact made with Zhian Zhan Yanfu.

At that time, the Daoist Shi Zongshi of Wannian Palace arrived, sincerely cultivating with utmost diligence, and became a disciple under the White Perfected One. The Perfected One bestowed upon him the Nine Numinous Flying Steps Chapter, the Supreme Purple Pivot Jade Morning Dongyang Flying Talisman, along with the Sanskrit incantation refining methods and the secret arts of the Five Thunders. He personally performed confession of faults and presented a memorial to Heaven’s Court.

The Perfected One then commanded all disciples: “Since I was sixteen, I abandoned my home to seek the dao, enduring bitter trials and penetrating mysteries. I died thrice and revived each time. My will never wavered, gladly bearing hardship and vexation. At forty-two, I met my true master and grasped the secret of self-cultivation. Only at sixty-four did I attain the elixir’s completion. Now at ninety-six, I have realized the dao. From this moment, we part. Those of you with aspiration, emulate my resolve—why fear virtue’s absence or the dao’s failure?” Having spoken thus, he sat and his body dissolved. The assembly beheld the Perfected One riding a crane ascending into the void. They bowed and sent him off without further words.

The Song Emperor Ningzong, upon hearing this, decreed the title “Haiqiong Ziqingming Dao Perfected One” and ordered the construction of Wuyi Palace to honor his virtue. The Perfected One’s disciple, Peng Helin, compiled his writings into forty volumes and recorded his deeds, truly illuminating the essential pivot of the daoist methods.

As for Zhang Daoqing, the Perfected One, after responding to the imperial summons, returned to Jiugong Mountain. There he used talismanic waters to relieve people’s suffering, performing marvels beyond measure. Clouds of disciples gathered, and he greatly expounded the profound dao. One day, ascending the hall, he revealed to the assembly:

“In former days, my master, Perfected Tan Changzhen in Shu, told me: ‘All beings revolve through birth and death without cease, only because of the mind’s presence. When mind arises, myriad demons arise; when mind ceases, myriad demons vanish. If one can cause not a single thought to arise, then birth and death are transcended. What is this ‘mind presence’? It is because sentient beings harbor the three poisons of greed, anger, and delusion. To learn the dao, one must purify these three poisons and leap beyond the Three Mountains. What are the Three Mountains? They are the Mountains of Ignorance, Flames, and Abyss. One must sever attachment and abandon love, crush strength and blunt sharpness, remove all unwholesome thoughts. Only when the selfish desires are utterly cleansed can one see the true nature before father and mother were born—that is the original true face.

“What are unwholesome thoughts? They are all those arising above all things—nameless stinginess, greed, jealousy, envy, lust, and various scheming thoughts, endlessly arising and perishing, trapped by karmic obstacles and familiar surroundings, obscuring the true source, unable to be freed. One must utterly extinguish all seeds of thought to see one’s own nature. What is one’s own nature? It is the innate endowment of Heaven, not the nature of temperament. Throughout the twelve hours, each moment must be pure and still, not defiled by any old tainted surroundings or obscured true source. The mind dwells in emptiness, roaming freely and at ease. Spirit and qi naturally mingle, the will harmonizes as one, perfectly free and clear. Like the bright moon high in the sky illuminating the vast earth, shining everywhere without exception. Do not let a single thought shake or cloud its radiance. Then there is no fear of birth and death, no karmic bonds to bind.

“If even a single thought arises, the mind is not pure and still, and obstacles arise, blocking entry to the dao—how can one see the original? Only if your will is as firm as a mountain, unmoving and unshaken, meeting demons with fearless heart and unwavering resolve, will those demons vanish by themselves. If you see demons and retreat in fear, you will fall into the worldly net—how can you leap beyond the sea of suffering? With a clear mind and settled intention, the path to Heaven is open; with confused will and disturbed nature, one enters the gates of hell. Reflect on this.

“Therefore, those who communicate with spirits are divine; those who live long are qi. I have received the master’s transmission, always abiding in the dao, never forgetting a single moment, preserving the one spirit, nourishing the one qi, thus able to communicate with spirits. Using talismanic waters to aid people, all respond without fail. How am I different? Only by preserving spirit and qi and guarding the upright heart. Now I am long wearied of the dusty world and wish to journey to Zhongnan to gather with masters and friends, answering Heaven’s decree.” He then retired to his alchemical chamber. Three days later, he summoned his disciples and composed a verse, departing peacefully. The verse reads:

I have wandered the great earth for many years,  
Letting go at the precipice, freeing nature and Heaven.  
Laughing, I point to the three isles of Peng and Ying,  
Turning back, they lie just before my own body.

When the time came for his burial, his body shed like a cicada’s shell. The disciples knew their master had dissolved his form and departed, and so they laid him to rest.

Meanwhile, the Mongol ruler returned from the Western Regions. The provincial governor of Yanjing, Shi Mo Gong, the envoy Liu Zhonglu, and other officials each presented petitions to the emperor. They summoned Master Qu Chiji of Shandong and appointed him as the Great Envoy of Pucha, overseeing the Taiji Palace Temple in Yanjing and supervising Daoist affairs. Master Qiu consented and journeyed to Yanjing, residing at Taiji Palace. He petitioned to rename Taiji Palace as Baiyun Temple. Daoist companions gathered, and the teachings flourished daily. Master Qiu established eight assemblies: Equality, Longevity Spring, Spirit Treasure, Long Life, Clear Truth, Peace, Disaster Elimination, and Golden Lotus. The number of those seeking dharma names grew daily, near and far, all heeding the dao’s influence. At this time, the sect’s teachings flourished widely; nobles and officials alike came to take refuge, disciples innumerable.

Nearby, some worldly monks, seeing the great spread of the daoist wind, harbored resentment. About two li west of Baiyun Temple, they built a Western Wind Monastery, intending to evoke “When the west wind rises, the white clouds scatter.” Master Qiu used a great bell to suppress it, so the west wind could not stir, for wind belongs to wood, and metal restrains wood. All temple bells and drums in the world are east metal, west wood—reversing the Five Phases—but Baiyun Temple’s bells and drums are east wood, west metal, thus they remain still and silent.

In the ninth month, the pacification official Wang Ji reported: “Mars invades the Tail Constellation, portending disaster in Yanjing. It is fitting to perform the Qingzhan ritual to avert it.” He asked Master Qiu the cost. Master Qiu replied: “One’s own loss is already hard to bear, let alone the whole realm. These past years, the people have suffered greatly, public and private funds are empty. I shall provide from the temple’s usual supplies.” Thus, a great jiao ritual was held for seven days. When the southern rites concluded, the pacification official bowed and congratulated joyfully: “Master’s dao heart moves Heaven’s heart; Mars has retreated several zhang; now there is no worry.” Master Qiu said: “Heaven’s response is like sound echoing in the valley, swift and true. How can the world’s people turn their backs? Good and evil are clear, retribution evident—how could it be false? Alas, how few believe in these times! How sad and reverent!”

---

While at Baiyun Temple, Master Qiu established an altar to transmit precepts, using the Vinaya to guide people. Initially, he taught the Initial True Faith Precepts, practiced for one year, fulfilling the Ten Precepts. He donned the Initial True Faith robe, explaining the “Merit and Demerit Record” and “Treatise on Response and Retribution,” clarifying the causes and effects of sin and blessing, and instructing proper conduct and demeanor. The next year, only then was one permitted to receive the Intermediate Pure Precepts, three hundred rules, practiced for one year. He expounded the “Four Grades Scripture,” “Clear Heart Sutra,” “Daily Use,” and other scriptures, elucidating principles of self-cultivation, fulfilling precepts and conduct. The following year, only then was one permitted to receive the Heavenly Immortal Great Precepts, studying the “Awakening to Truth,” “Harmony of the Three,” “Nanhua,” “Dao De,” and various alchemical scriptures, upholding the Heavenly Immortal Great Precepts. Afterward, there were no precepts not observed; the unobserved became self-observed, that was true precept. At this stage, in movement one accords with the dao, in stillness one accords with the dao; in walking, standing, sitting, lying, speech, and action, all are perfectly penetrated, all matters are in the dao—how could there be anything not in accord with the dao?

One day, Master Qiu ascended Baoguang Hall to preach, universally declaring:  
“You who have left home to learn the dao, seeing through the red dust by cause and condition, have come to take refuge in the Three Treasures. Entering this dao gate, yet unwilling to truly cultivate and work the dao, unwilling to labor the body and accumulate merit, inwardly lacking pure and still mind and body to cultivate the dao’s fruit; outwardly unwilling to endure hardship for others, to nurture the root foundation. Only seeking ease and comfort, sitting to consume faith and offerings, committing sins and creating offenses, adding to transgressions. When blessings end and sins fill, death falls to hell, suffering fully; or rebirth as six beasts, repaying labor with strength, settling old debts; or repaying with flesh, feeding mouth and belly. When that time comes, regret is too late.

“Seeing this, why not urgently set firm footing, grasp the main intent, with bitter will and steadfast heart, cultivate the body and work the dao? Reflect on worldly affairs—everything is false; the void nature is the dao in all things. As for me, when I was sixteen, I abandoned home to seek the dao; at nineteen, I met my true master; following him over twenty years, never hearing a single word of the dao without enduring many tribulations. My heart bore no resentment or grievance. Only when my master realized the dao did he entrust me with the elixir’s yang; only then was I granted the dao’s essence. Had I harbored even a trace of anger or laziness, I would have long entered the ghost realm, transformed into a strange being—how could I have attained the dao today?”  

---

At Qingfeng, bowing respectfully, he asked: “Some say, ‘No mind, no attachment, single intention never leaving the heart, guarding it until old age without success, never meeting a master’s enlightenment.’ Why is this?” The master replied: “No mind, no attachment, falls into illusion and emptiness. Single intention never leaving the heart is clinging to mind. Not yet reaching the realm of true emptiness and actuality, how can one move the true sage? Hence, old age and death without success. True emptiness is hard to speak of. When you remove even one part of desire from the mind, you gain one part of merit; remove ten parts, ten parts of merit; remove nine thousand nine hundred ninety-nine parts, leaving only one part unremoved, that is not true emptiness. You must remove it all. Then the true immortal will come to check your heart, and naturally a true master will come to save you.

“If you dwell amid the dusty world, how can you always be without affairs? If some small matters arise, they are external and must be dealt with. But once the matter passes, do not seek it; when it comes, do not avoid it. Thus, Lüzu said: ‘True constancy must respond to things; responding must not be confused. When matters come, respond; when matters go, stop.’ Practicing thus, daily responding to myriad affairs, the mind remains untroubled. In leisure, calmly settled, what attachment is there?”

---

A disciple asked: “For those cultivating the dao, is it better to be in quiet places or in bustling ones?” The master said: “When the beginner’s mind is not settled, and desires are not yet extinguished, it is best to avoid quiet places, gradually severing desires. If one has true resolve and the dusty heart is pure, bustling places are better. As for me, in Panxi, six years of bitter resolve equaled six lifetimes of effort for others.”

---

Someone asked: “I single-mindedly pursue the dao, yet my body still has leakages. How to treat this?” The master said: “Your mind is not truly quiet and pure, hence the leakage. When you reach the mind’s source, clear and still, the primordial spirit calm and settled, spirit and qi mingled, the six thieves cannot invade, essence transforms into qi, spirit and qi conjoin, refining the supreme treasure; the essence path naturally seals forever—how could there be leakage?”

---

Someone asked: “I have heard that cultivation depends entirely on will and vow. What are will and vow?” The master said: “Will is holding the mind to refine oneself, not shifting a single thought, removing emotion and extinguishing desire, not arousing greed or anger. Not disturbed by wealth, honor, or glory, not moved by hardship or suffering, not attached to a speck of dust, not raising a single thought—this is true will. Vow is often to benefit others and things, all acts of merit and virtue, saving people and aiding the world—these are vows.”

---

Someone asked: “How to regulate breath?” The master said: “Turtle breath, soft and continuous, is the daoist’s livelihood, but do not fixate on it. The Chan school does not speak of breath regulation as self-refining skill, only saying ‘pure, quiet, extinguished’—these four words are double dung heaps. Thus it is said: The physical body’s origin is limited, desires boundless. Delusion is like bees craving honey, madness like butterflies loving flowers.

“In general, the daoist path has many gates. Without meeting a clear master’s guidance, it is hard to fathom. Worldly methods may involve spirit concentration, shaking sinews and bones, breathing exercises, swallowing clouds and taking qi; or using divination to add and subtract; or using furnace fire to burn herbs and refine mercury; or acquiring sideline skills to deceive fools; or employing war tactics to exhaust essence and ruin virtue; or false teachings to mislead commoners, slandering the true teaching. Such people are sinners within the teaching, destined to fall to hell or be reborn as beasts—too many to list. The scripture says: ‘To live long, be cautious in the chamber; why die and make the spirit weep?’ People who indulge desires have not died physically, but their spirit is lost already.

“The dao is to cultivate the formless form, to be without person or thing, containing being within non-being, preserving one point of empty spirit and unclouded true nature. Thus the vast six directions, the brightness of the three lights, are forms of Heaven and Earth. I therefore nurture the formless; the form remains constant; containing the no-mind, the nature is bright and unclouded. Thus, refining into immortal truth, spirit united with emptiness, body abiding in the dao, form and spirit both wondrous, united with the dao’s truth. Hence my body can ascend to the Jade Capital, can invite journeys to the Golden Palace, able to be and not be, neither ending nor perishing. Thus no descent or exile occurs, no worry of kalpa or fate.

“If one only seeks to see one’s nature, not knowing the importance of refining the form, one dies as a clear spirit ghost—how can one ascend into the void, how compare with high immortals and supreme sages? If the body does not perish but spirit departs, the body remains in the world, flesh not decayed; if nature does not perish, even hungry ghosts and beasts have this nature, only differing in spirit’s presence or absence, clarity or obscurity.

“The mind can create form, the mind can retain form. The law includes those who love to dwell in the world, moving through thousands of kalpas; the mind is the cause. If the mind’s root is damaged, in an instant one turns to the dark path. Form lost but mind preserved are sages; form preserved but mind changed are beasts.

“Now, people desire long life but do not seek it in their own original life; instead, they beg before immortals, Buddhas, and spirits. Foolish indeed! Abandoning the root to seek the branch—what benefit is there? Our sect does not speak of long life, not because it does not exist, but because it transcends long life. This is the supreme great dao, not petty arts of extending years. Cultivators must understand literature and principle, then penetrate mysteries and grasp profundities before applying effort. A slight misunderstanding, a hair’s breadth off, and the elixir is incomplete.

“Nowadays, people seek masters to cultivate, expecting to become immortals or Buddhas in a year or two; if after three or five years no success appears, they lose heart. Even human nature is not understood—how can they understand dao? If one can grasp one principle, one can shed one shell; if all principles are grasped, shedding myriad shells, the heart is unblocked, the great dao shines. If one thing or principle is not understood, obstacles arise, and that layer of shell cannot be shed. In Confucius’ school, are there not sages who understand principle? Under the Most High Patriarch’s lineage, are there not true immortals who reach the dao? If you wish to understand the dao, you must first understand human nature and worldly affairs, grasp the one source, then all things are known, all matters clear. Once human principle is understood, dao principle is not far. One root can scatter into myriad forms; myriad forms can return to one root.”

A disciple asked: “The Northern Sect’s daoist methods flourish greatly under our master. Can the master perform divine transformations?” Master Qiu said: “The great dao is extremely ordinary, not making strange wonders. As long as the heart is true, what cannot be done? I first suffered bitterly, enduring decades of tribulations, my resolve unshaken, never slackening, guarding the one heart alone. Since leaving the mountain, emperors and officials have honored me, the emperor decreed me Grand Patriarch, yet my heart has never moved. Yellow children, white beggars, lowly ones—I have never looked down on them. All are equal, no high or low. The Western Regions call me the Living Buddha of Zhendan. Since the rise of Quanzhen, none have matched this. How could I claim achievement? I am but a bubble floating on the sea of nature.

“There was a demon in the palace; all methods failed; Zhang Tianshi gave up. The emperor summoned me. I was in the mountain, quietly moving a single thought; the demon left by itself. I did not use talismans or generals; the evil fled in fear. Why? Because evil cannot overcome righteousness. This is the principle. I preserve this principle, and Heaven and humans naturally respond.”  

Truly:  
The one nature perfectly clear is our sect’s root,  
Nurturing the hidden dragon in the mind’s gate.  
Refining yang essence, golden light shines through,  
What need have I of favor or rank to seal my decree?
