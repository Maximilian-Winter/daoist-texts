# Chapter Twenty-Two: Immortal Liu in Luoyang Inserts the Peony — Master Huangshi’s Legacy of the Purple Cypress

**Verse:**

To attain the Dao is to be without attachment,  
All things unfold as will and heart decree.  
Planting flowers grows lush and dense,  
From withered wood sprouts shoot and branch.  
Transformations soar through azure skies—  
Why be bound by noisy towns or wilds?  
A thousand-year pine cone is easy to find—  
Not in worldly dust do such treasures ride.  
*(To the tune of “West River Moon”)*

The tale tells of Master Qiu, who at the White Cloud Temple in Yanjing grandly spread the sect’s teachings, dispatching disciples like Song Dao’an, Zheng Zhixiu, Yu Qingfeng, and Yin Zhiping to teach afar. Their stories are not told here.

Now, Immortal Liu Changsheng, having transcended in Fuzhou, roamed the blessed grottoes and sacred mountains—the Three Peaks and Five Sacred Mountains—paying homage to immortals and perfected ones. Sometimes appearing, sometimes hidden, he gathered merit wherever he went, awaiting the summons to ascend. At one time, wandering Luoyang, he recalled how Sun Bu’er nurtured the Dao within a broken kiln; after the Dao was attained, along with Dan Yang and Geng Shi soaring on cranes, they named their place the Three Wells Grotto. At this time, incense and offerings flourished there, and he wished to visit and admire it once more.

Thus, with a flick of transformation, he became a Quanzhen Daoist companion, appearing about twenty years old, his bearing strikingly unlike ordinary folk—free and unrestrained beyond the mundane. How was he adorned? Behold:

He wore a silk kerchief, two flowing ribbons fluttering;  
A crane’s cloak draped his form, embroidered with blooming brocade.  
His face was like a full moon, flushed with peach blossoms;  
Lips as if painted vermilion, eyes veiled autumn waters.  
No brush nor paint could capture such beauty,  
No famed courtesan’s rouge could compare.  
Ten fingers like jade shoots gleamed with light,  
His body like congealed cream, smooth and radiant.  
Truly: elegance rivaling Lady Pei, grace no less than Song’s famed beauty.

It was the fifteenth day of the second month, the day the Azure Ox appeared to celebrate the Most High Patriarch of the Dao’s sacred birthday. All across Luoyang’s towns and villages, men and women flocked to the Azure Ox Temple to burn incense. Immortal Liu first toured the Three Wells Grotto, then proceeded to the Azure Ox Temple to offer incense.

Young women, seeing Liu’s extraordinary visage, each felt a thrill through their limbs and whispered, “Where in the world is such a handsome man? Why would he renounce the world to cultivate the Dao?” Some said, “His past lives must have been filled with immense effort; now reborn with such beauty, if he cultivates again, surely he will become an immortal!” They talked and gazed, each heart filled with longing.

Liu saw a maiden with a budding peony in her hair and approached, saying, “Miss, though this peony is radiant, it is a pity it cannot be admired by all. If you would give this flower to me, I guarantee all will share in its beauty.” The maiden, pleased by his words, plucked the peony from her hair and handed it to him.

Liu took it gently, breathed upon it with immortal breath, drew a talisman of revival, then summoned the primordial True One’s water to nourish the flower. He planted the peony in the wild mountain soil, intoning sacred words, marking the talisman, and sprinkling water. In moments, shoots sprouted, branches grew, buds formed, and blossoms opened. The flower shone with even greater splendor and exuded an extraordinary fragrance.

Liu addressed the crowd: “This flower is unlike those in your gardens—cut flowers wither by the day. If you wear this peony in your hair, it will last seven days without fading, growing ever more fragrant. Those who love it may pluck freely.” People swarmed like a dense hive, men and women pressing close, gathering flowers. As soon as they were picked, new blooms sprang forth. Word spread far and wide; crowds came to see. Truly:  
*News of Luoyang’s beauty grows,  
Out the door, all come to see the flowers.*

Amid the lively scene, Liu transformed into a breeze of the Dao, vanishing without a trace. The crowd, astonished by his sudden disappearance, saw on a peony leaf the five characters: “Changsheng Liu’s Handwriting.” They realized the immortal had revealed himself, and all hailed him as “Immortal Liu the Flower Inserter.” Later generations built temples and statues in his honor, naming the shrine Liu Immortal’s Temple, where incense burned unceasingly through the ages. But that is another tale, not told here.

After his miraculous display in Luoyang, Immortal Liu wished to journey to Zhongnan Mountain. Passing through Chang’an, he reached Mengzhi County and suddenly recalled: here stood the ancient Grotto Temple, a place where the Most High Patriarch once transmitted the Dao and Virtue—a sacred relic of ancient sages. He must visit.

Climbing the mountain, he beheld:

Layer upon layer of rugged peaks, sheer cliffs uneven and steep.  
Rosy clouds pierced the azure sky, like jade and crystal shining bright.  
Purple mists curled around the mysterious gate, surpassing any immortal’s abode.  
Tiger roars and dragon cries contended in might,  
Willows blushed red, peaches and plums vied for spring’s light.  
The Sutra Platform resembled the heavenly palace of Doushuai,  
The Dharma Hall like the shell palaces of Pengling.  
Sacred traces lingered on ancient stones,  
Immortal footprints beside the Transforming Maiden’s spring.  
Under Lüxian Rock, thoughts turned to Tang and Song immortals;  
Within the Five Elders’ Cave, memories of Laozi from Shang and Zhou.  
Riding the Azure Ox, purple clouds crossed the Eastern Pass;  
Passing Hangu, they crossed the Western Sands, transforming barbarians.  
Reflecting on past and present, truly Zhongnan is a blessed land;  
Tracing its traces, one may boast of the Grotto Temple immortal palace.  
Indeed: five thousand wondrous truths flow down through time,  
Ancient winds and customs endure forevermore.

Immortal Liu, admiring the sacred relics of the Grotto Temple, was filled with envy and awe. From afar, white clouds drifted westward—he knew immortals were passing by. Soon, Wang Yuyang and Tan Changzhen arrived, touring Zhongnan Mountain.

---

Wang Yuyang had long dwelled in Zhongtiao Mountain, standing alone on a perilous cliff for nine years, transcending his body to ascend, accumulating merit while awaiting summons. Once, wandering Xiong’er Mountain, he met Tan Changzhen, who was also transcending there. The two immortals agreed to journey together to Zhongnan.

At Zhongnan Town, they saw purple clouds coiling over the Grotto Temple, signs that a true immortal lingered there. The two ascended to tour and found Liu Changsheng present. The three immortals met, overjoyed beyond measure, greeting one another and recounting their paths to Dao attainment.

Changzhen said, “Today the three of us meet by chance—truly rare. Dan Yang and Bu’er long ago transcended and still accumulate merit in the south, soon to meet at the Southern Mountain. After Hao Taigu attained the Dao at Zhao Prefecture Bridge, he dwelt with Lady Teng at Mount Hua, carving seventy-two stone chambers to benefit later sages in their nurturing. When Lady Teng’s elixir was complete, they roamed the world, accumulating merit and saving beings. Only Changchun’s name spreads through the lands, his virtue surpassing all perfected ones. Now he serves as northern prime minister, grandly spreading the sect’s teachings—truly a late bloomer of great stature, beyond our reach.” Wang Yang said, “Qiu Changchun abandoned home to seek the Dao for over forty years, enduring countless hardships, dying and reviving, unwavering in purpose. Upon Dao attainment, all directions revered him, nations praised. Since ancient times, none have sought the Dao with more bitter resolve than Qiu Changchun and Bai Yuchan. If others emulate such cultivation, with such resolve and single-heartedness, all may attain the Dao and ascend to truth.” The three immortals praised and admired him deeply.

Immortal Liu said, “Since the four of us have met here, shall we journey to the Ultimate True Grotto to pay respects to our Patriarch?” Wang and Tan gladly agreed, each manifesting their divine powers. Wang Yuyang summoned a tiger, Liu Changsheng called forth a deer, Tan Changzhen brought a leopard; each mounted their steed, and before long arrived at Purple Cypress Mountain.

There they saw the Ultimate True Grotto Heaven, clouds of auspicious radiance swirling, orioles singing and cranes calling, phoenixes dancing and luan birds soaring. The three immortals dismounted and entered the grotto, where fragrant jade grasses and strange flowers bloomed, and the mountain’s rare fruits perfumed the air. Inside, immortal youths announced their arrival. Soon, many perfected immortals emerged. Liu, Tan, and Wang hurried forward to bow deeply.

Lüzu led the three to the inner grotto. Chongyang pointed to He Yuchan, saying, “This is your teacher’s consort, He Yuchan.” The three immortals bowed again and then sat. Tan Changzhen said, “In the past, while in Western Shu, a mad woman struck me once, saying ‘One punch repels many lifetimes of sin.’ Was this your teaching, Master?” He Yuchan smiled, “I knew your nature and cultivation would succeed, so I left that saying, awaiting your Dao attainment to continue the poem.” Tan bowed, “Thanks for your grace and instruction, which brought me to this day. I wish to accumulate merit in the mortal world for several years to repay my master’s kindness.” Master Chongyang said, “With such heart, no merit is too much, no path too broad. The more you accumulate, the higher you rise, and the greater Heaven’s blessings. Go forth to perform great deeds; when Changchun’s merit is complete and his Dao perfected, we shall all journey to the Immortal Capital to pay homage at the Golden Pavilion.” Liu Changsheng and Wang Chuyi each recounted their own paths to Dao attainment and salvation. The immortals praised them without end, when suddenly a radiant light shone from outside the grotto—an exalted immortal had arrived. The immortals hurried out to welcome him.

---

A celestial figure rode in on a red dragon-serpent, followed by an immortal youth carrying a gourd on his back, descending from the sky. Zhengyang knew this was the Red Pine Elder descending and quickly led the immortals to bow and welcome him into the grotto.

The immortals had not yet met when Zhengyang Emperor raised his fist in salute. All present dared not be disrespectful and stepped forward to bow. Zhengyang spoke, “We did not know the Elder would descend to this wild mountain and failed to welcome him from afar—please forgive our neglect.”

The Great Red Pine Elder said, “Yesterday at the Southern Pole meeting, I heard Master Xu’s words and learned the reason for Jingwei’s descent. Now, by the grace of Zhengyang, Chunyang, and Chongyang, he has attained Dao and entered the ranks of immortals. Thus, by their favor, I escort him. Also, due to his old karmic causes, I now bring him to Kunlun to meet the Queen Mother, then await summons for his assignment.” He Yuchan heard this and hurried forward to kneel, saying, “I now hear the Master’s words and understand my origin. Without the Master’s grace, I would have almost lost my true self.” Red Pine Elder said, “You were once the daughter of the Flame Emperor, who studied under me. At that time, you had not heard the Dao and sought truth on Penglai Isle, drowning at sea. Your true spirit transformed into a blue bird named Jingwei, filled with wrath, seeking to fill the Eastern Sea with wood and stone from the Western Mountains. I saw you then and brought you to the Jade Pool, where the Queen Mother took you in, assigning you to the Orchid Garden to accumulate merit until your wrath was cleansed, so you might return to the mortal world and cultivate the Dao. Now you have shed your feathers and attained the golden immortal rank forever.”

Having spoken, he took out several pine nuts and said to the immortals, “Yesterday at the Southern Pole meeting, I brought these pine nuts, produced by the Divine Farmer, a fruit once in a thousand years. Mortals who eat these may live long and not age; immortals who eat them may greatly increase their spiritual powers. Distribute one to each disciple to eat. I keep one to plant here on this mountain, so future Dao aspirants may eat and extend their years. Long-term use and cultivation will grant longevity and immortal status.” This is the origin of the pines on Purple Cypress Mountain. But that is another story, not told here.

---

The immortals each took a pine nut and ate it, finding the taste sweet and fragrant beyond compare, praising it endlessly.

Red Pine Elder commanded Huo Lu to go to Western Shu to warn the people, taking He Yuchan with him. They rode the red dragon-serpent and journeyed to the Western Pool. The immortals saw them off outside the grotto; the red dragon-serpent faced west and departed.

Returning to the grotto, Zhengyang and Chunyang wished to descend the mountain to accumulate merit and save beings. Tan, Liu, and Wang also wished to follow. Only Master Chongyang remained in the grotto, awaiting the completion of the disciples’ merit and the gathering of the seven golden lotuses, when he would be summoned to ascend. The immortals left the grotto; Tan Changzhen and the other three bowed farewell to their master and patriarch, then each went their separate ways to save beings. Their stories are not told here.

---

Meanwhile, immortals Zhong and Lü left Zhongnan and traveled to Lin’an, where they met Cui Yuzhi. After Cui Yuzhi had freely served before the Song emperor’s carriage and retired due to illness to Guangzhou, he met Master Bai Ziqing, who recognized his Dao potential and taught him methods for longevity and eternal life. Now traveling in Lin’an, he met immortals Zhong and Lü, who transmitted to him the Dao of Three and Five Returning to One.

In the autumn of the Jia Shen year, Emperor Ningzong of Song passed away. Shi Miyuan forged an edict to enthrone Prince Gui Cheng of Yi as Emperor Lizong, renaming him Jun; the Empress Dowager was honored as Grand Empress Dowager and co-ruled. The imperial prince Hong was granted the title Prince of Jiyang. Ningzong had no sons, so Hong was made heir—he was Lizong’s elder brother but was killed by Shi Miyuan.

In the Yi You year, the Song changed the era name to Baoqing. At that time, the holy monk Dao Ji passed away. This monk was from Tiantai, gifted from youth, fond of studying Buddhist scriptures. After his parents died, he abandoned home to seek the Dao. He visited Lin’an, stayed at Lingyin Temple, and took the blind elder monk Yuan Xiangtang as master. Later awakening to his true nature, he feigned madness to confuse the world, drank wine, and ate meat. The monks saw his wild ways and despised him, calling him “Dao Ji the Mad.” After Yuan Xiangtang passed, Dao Ji left Lingyin Temple, feigning madness in the city. Sometimes he healed palace disasters, sometimes cured grave illnesses in brothels—his words were always efficacious, correcting evil. Later, he lived at Jingci Temple as a record keeper. Once, in a dream, he appeared to thank the Empress Dowager for rebuilding the main hall. He also gathered wood from Mount Sian to the temple’s well, where water suddenly gushed forth. When reproached for eating meat and drinking wine, he would vomit the food, which would fly away; fish and water creatures would swim freely. At age sixty, he suddenly ceased eating meat and wine. When court officials invited him to drink, he always said, “Release life.” Burned and maimed creatures revived when released into water. People respected and believed him more and more. That autumn, he passed away. The monks cremated him and found countless relics. The next day, a monk brought a letter to Jingci Temple, saying, “Yesterday on the road I met Dao Ji, who sent this letter, saying the Mongols ravage the land, the Buddhist realm is destroyed, and he wishes to return to Taizhou.” Later generations said Dao Ji was the reincarnation of the Purple Gold Arhat of Guoqing Temple.

---

At that time, the Mongols invaded Goryeo and the Western Regions, the Quan, and Xia, dividing their forces to conquer. The Xia ruler Dewang died in fear; his nephew Ni took the throne.

On the Ding Hai day, the Mongols captured Xia ruler Ni and Xia was destroyed. Generals fought over gold, silk, and women, but only Chu Cai took several books and large quantities of rhubarb, loading them on two camels. Soon after, soldiers fell ill, but the rhubarb cured them. Thanks to this rhubarb, thousands of lives were saved, and the army remained intact. They then broke through three passes; the Jin only held Henan.

That year, Mongol ruler Temujin died; his four sons were overseen by Tolui as regent. They captured Western Hezhou. The prefect Chen Yintong’s wife, Madam Du, drank poison and died standing, unable to fall. Tolui said she was loyal and allowed her temple rites, so she could rest. She was buried with the honors of a great official. The Mongols pressed their troops, but the monk Chen of Taichang led four hundred cavalry to defeat them.

That autumn, the Mongols enthroned their third son, Ögedei, as Taizong. He employed Chu Cai, and under his rule, the land prospered and armies roared. Taizong issued an edict renaming the Northern Palace Immortal Isle as Wan’an Palace and the Tianchang Temple as Changchun Temple. He appointed Qiu Chuji to oversee all monks and Daoists across the realm; all good people were subject to him. He bestowed a golden tiger plaque; all teaching matters were to be handled by Immortal Qiu.

Wang Zhiming, the pacification commissioner of Shandong, returned and delivered the edict from Taizong to the White Cloud Temple in Yanjing.

On the twenty-third day of the fifth month, during the si and wu hours, thunder and rain roared fiercely. The southern bank of Taiye Pool cracked open, water rushed into the East Lake, the sound heard for tens of li, fish and turtles vanished, and the pool dried up. The North Mountain pass also collapsed. The master sighed, “The mountain falls and the pool dries—shall I perish with them?”

On the fourth day of the seventh month, the master said to disciples Song Dao’an and Yin Zhiping, “In the past, senior brother Dan Yang once foretold to me: after my passing, the teaching will flourish greatly; all directions will often transform into Daoist villages, Daoist temples will be granted official names and quotas. You must preside over the great palaces and grand temples, and there will be messengers bearing talismans and riding swift transmissions to manage the Daoist gates. My master Chongyang’s words—all have come true.”

Truly:  
*Now the great earth dons spring’s hues,  
The wind blows fair, joy and peace abound.  
The mysterious sect revives forever,  
The Dan Platform and Purple Mansion record immortal names.*
