# Chapter Twenty-Three: Master Qiu Changchun Ascends to Truth at the White Cloud Hall — Pure Yangzi at the Azure Mist Cavern

**Verse:**

The dao I speak of has its origin,  
Not for idle roaming, nor to mark spring and autumn.  
Swiftly boil and refine, sever desire, cut off passion;  
Beside flowers and willows, silently nurture, diligently cultivate.  
Gather the Three Treasures, preserve the void, guard the manifest;  
Capture the Six Thieves, strict laws firmly enforced.  
Do not cling or linger, unceasing all day long.  
Forget not, aid not—what joy, what sorrow?  
*(Right tune: “Breaking the Laurel”)*

Now, it is told that Master Qiu, the Perfected One, was about to transmit the precepts and laws to Zhao Daojian, saying:  
“This precept and law is for those of the highest aspiration. In movement and stillness, speech and silence, all matters lie within the dao; in walking, standing, sitting, and lying down, one naturally accords with the proper rite. There is no precept to be precepted, no law to be lawed—why then need precepts at all? For those of middling aspiration, they rely on precepts to restrain themselves; with dignity and discipline they teach and act outwardly, and with precepts and laws they stabilize their great vows within, so that inside and out none dare act rashly. At first, it is forced; with habit it becomes pure and familiar; in the end, it returns to nature. From precept arises stillness; from stillness arises wisdom. Wisdom flourishes, passions are cleansed away, the foundation of the elixir is built; movement and stillness accord with rite, the dao is not lost, the immortal rank is established. What is called precept is to cease evil and pursue good, the great root of creating blessings and eternal life, which future generations must not neglect. I have five verses on the Market of Searching to entrust to you.” The verses say:

Respond to Heaven with sincerity, not with flowery words;  
Worldly affairs are but a tangle of confusion.  
Since the primordial abundance stirred spiritual response,  
A hundred years, different eras, none heard the same.  
The Protector of Shandong’s heart loves the dao,  
Once passing Penglai, asked about the immortal herbs.  
Deeply hoping in trance to commune with celestial spirits,  
Yet no auspicious sign embraced his bosom.  
At that time, the great sea’s winds and waves ceased,  
Ten thousand miles of sky reflected the azure heavens.  
At the horizon, harmonious air gave rise to purple smoke,  
Beneath the sea, clustered mountains carved green cliffs.  
Layered cities and strange trees appeared at the forefront,  
Armored horses and divine soldiers followed in transformation.  
Empty banners and canopies emerged atop the mountain peaks,  
Treasure pavilions and jade towers floated on the water’s surface.  
The boundless void resembled the Penglai Palace,  
It moved itself beyond the Three Mountains east of the sea.  
Crane steeds drifted near the western shore,  
Coming at a clear time to stir the dao wind.

Zhao Xuijing accepted the precepts and laws, bowing to thank his master. Master Qiu then addressed the assembly:  
“Among my disciples, some expound the dao and discuss virtue, some cultivate body and refine nature, some practice merit to aid the world, some endure hardship to accumulate功. Within the dao gate affairs, both internal and external, all are present. I depart with no regrets.”

On the seventh day of the seventh month, the assembly requested the master to ascend the hall. Master Qiu said, “I shall ascend the hall on the ninth day.” The disciples entreated, “Please remain in the world a few more years. We all feel your protective grace, which greatly increases our radiance.” Master said, “I am eighty years old. My brothers and sisters have all already attained the dao. Wait for me to go together to respond to the summons, fulfilling the seven golden lotus number; it must not be forcibly opposed. Those of true aspiration among you, we shall meet again. Those who turn away from my dao will never see me again.” With these words, he gathered his spirit and sat calmly, closing his mouth in silence.

At noon on the ninth day, he ascended the hall after the meal, leaving this hymn:

Life and death, dawn and dusk, matters the same;  
Illusory bubbles appear and vanish, water flows long and free.  
Where faint light is seen, the black rabbit leaps;  
When the primordial measure opens, it embraces sea and mountain.  
Waving eight arms as though near at hand,  
Blowing and puffing all things as if a mechanism.  
Mad words fall from the brush as dust and grime,  
Entrusted to today’s people’s reckless hearing.

At that time, he sat in the Hall of Precious Light and returned to truth. In the sky, cloud cranes flew in soaring dance, a white rainbow pierced the auspicious forest; near and far, people were amazed and frightened, all eyes witnessed together. The strange fragrance lingered for days without dispersing. Before, the master’s appearance was humble; upon the fruition of the dao, he transformed into the celestial form of a heavenly being. Disciples and virtuous folk gathered in great numbers, Daoists and laypeople from all directions rushed to attend. Those who came to mourn numbered tens of thousands, their grief as if they had lost their own parents.

The master dwelt in the world for eighty years. His disciples encoffined his physical body and buried it at the White Cloud Temple, placing him seated within a jar. The master’s works, including the *Panxi Mingdao Collection* and *Journey to the West*, circulated in the world. He left behind a sect of forty characters passed down to later generations, called the Dragon Gate Sect:

The dao and virtue penetrate mystery and stillness,  
The true constant guards the Great Clarity.  
One yang returns to its root,  
Uniting teachings eternally bright and complete.  
Ultimate principle, sect of sincerity and faith,  
Exalted and noble, continuing the flourishing law.  
The world’s prosperity depends on diligent effort,  
Subtle and rare, spreading peace from within.

Not long after Master Qiu’s burial, some saw him at Fangshan, dressed as before. The village of Chu reported the spirit of Qiu Changchun’s miraculous silent protection. Emperor Yuanzong posthumously honored him as the Great Perfected Master, Chief Teacher of Changchun’s Dao, ordering a statue to be erected above his tomb, incense smoke swirling unceasingly through generations. Every year on the nineteenth day of the first month, his sacred birthday, incense offerings grew ever more fervent. Later generations called this the Yanjiu Assembly, a grand gathering lasting twelve days. Each spring and autumn, imperial sacrifices were held to repay his功. The number of disciples under Master Qiu is unknown; among them, eighteen received his true transmission, the foremost being Yin Qinghe, Zhao Xuijing, Wang Zhiming, and Li Zhenduo. This is idle talk, not to be detailed here.

---

Now, Li Zhenduo, having received secret instructions at Dragon Gate Cave, later met Magu who further bestowed wondrous teachings. He entered Mount Huo and perfected the true fruit, his six senses free of leakage, calling himself the “One Without Leakage.” At forty-eight years old, he first achieved spiritual rebirth and transformation, then emerged from the mountain to accumulate功. When he learned of his master’s return to truth, he went to Yanjing to attend the funeral, though none recognized him. Only Zhao Xuijing knew him, noting he appeared about twenty years old and, seeing his dao perfected, grew even more respectful.

The crowd asked Brother Zhao, “Who is this female dao companion? She looks so young; how do you know her?” Xuijing replied, “This is Brother Li, the foremost disciple of our master. He once received the elixir instructions at Dragon Gate. Since parting, decades have passed, yet his countenance has grown youthful; Brother Li’s great dao is complete.”

Hearing this, all came to pay respects. Li Without Leakage returned their bows. Zhao Xuijing asked, “Brother Li, where have you cultivated dao these decades? How did you change so swiftly? We have all not kept pace.” Li Without Leakage answered, “After bidding farewell at Dragon Gate Cave, I cultivated for several years in Guandong, wandered the Danxia Cavern of Magu Mountain, where Immortal Maiden Magu granted me the elixir and teachings. Later, I cultivated at Mount Huo, barely attaining the art of longevity and spiritual communication, insufficient for the high dao. It cannot compare to the great dao and virtue of elder immortal brothers. In the future, I shall become a leader of the Mysterious Gate, a compassionate ferry to save the world. How could this be compared to petty minor arts? Now I intend to journey south to Wu and Yue; we shall meet again.” The crowd wished to keep him but could not; they sent him off at the mountain gate, watching Li Without Leakage drift away like a breeze.

The assembly returned to the temple to discuss: “Our master has now ascended, the funeral is complete, and the temple is without a leader. Only Brother Zhao has high dao and virtue, fit to ascend as chairman.” Xuijing demurred, “There are hundreds of Daoists here, many with virtue and talent; another should be chosen. I am of shallow virtue and deep faults, lacking skill and learning; how could I undertake such a great task?” The assembly said, “None but Brother Zhao is suitable. Moreover, the master once transmitted the precepts to you; you should ascend as chairman.” They summoned the heads of each hall to burn incense and hold candles; the crowd pulled and pushed, ascending the hall to incense, ringing bells and beating drums. After all the halls paid respects, they escorted him to the abbot’s chamber. The kitchen was ordered to prepare offerings, welcoming the new abbot to the seat. Daoists and laypeople alike came to pay respects and congratulations. The next day, civil and military officials, gentry, townsfolk, and soldiers all gathered to congratulate, bustling for over ten days.

Since Zhao Xuijing ascended as chairman, he followed the master’s model, with dignified teaching and discipline. Furthermore, after the decree of Master Changchun, incense flourished and the teaching prospered daily. The body of Master Changchun sat in the jar; later caretakers repaired the tomb and found the jar broken but the body uncorrupted, his countenance as if alive, clothes torn revealing flesh, skin like jade, fingers and nails grown several feet long. It was known then that the Perfected One’s spirit had ascended to the upper realms, leaving form behind to dwell in the world—a marvel of form and spirit, united with the dao in truth. This is later history, not told here.

Meanwhile, Master Qiu’s disciples scattered, residing in various places, presiding over the Profound Teaching, spreading wondrous methods, each accumulating great功. The ancestral branches of Master Qiu and the Seven Perfected sects flourished everywhere, opening seventy-two monasteries, widely propagating the great sectarian spirit. Truly:  
The world transforms into an immortal realm,  
Worldly customs turn into daoist winds.

At that time, Patriarch Lü traveled to Lin’an, converting Huang Deyuan and Zhao Xiaoxian. Huang Deyuan was a man from Yue Commandery, sharp and wise from youth, growing to admire the dao, abandoning family to pursue the path. He searched famous mountains, earnestly probing mystery for over ten years, gradually gaining some attainment. Later he lived in seclusion at Qingxia Cave on Wu Mountain in Lin’an. Before the cave was a banana pond, its scene serene and secluded. Deyuan dwelt there, closing his door to quietly nurture himself. Later, a man from Chu, Zhao Xiaoxian, also came to live there by the pond, sharing the same dao, quietly cultivating, companions in stillness and purity.

Patriarch Lü came here, knowing the two had roots of immortality and wished to convert them. Unexpectedly, the two left and lingered at Tianqing Temple. At that time, banana flowers bloomed before the abbot’s quarters. Lü left a poem on a banana leaf:

At midnight, playing moon on Jun Mountain,  
West neighbor’s small garden, green lotus blooms.  
Heavenly wind, fragrant mist, cold azure splendor,  
Ask me your name and origin.

After writing, Lü departed. Several days later he came again but did not meet them, leaving another poem:

White snow and red lead stand as holy embryo,  
Golden flower must fully bloom.  
Let us go together to see Yingzhou,  
Clouds in the blue sky, cranes not yet returned.

Huang and Zhao returned to the cave to roam and enjoy, seeing the two poems on banana leaves, knowing them as divine writings, regretting not having met. Several years later, a guest suddenly arrived, graceful in appearance and extraordinary in speech. Huang and Zhao warmly received him, humbly requesting teachings. The guest gave two poems:

To awaken the heart is easy; to still the heart is hard,  
Once stilled, the heart’s source is free everywhere.  
Stars shift and heavens near dawn,  
White clouds still cover green mountains.  
A day of leisure is a day of immortality,  
Six spirits harmonize and naturally rest.  
The elixir field holds treasure—seek no dao,  
Facing conditions with no mind, ask not of meditation.

Huang and Zhao were amazed, saying, “These two poems resemble those on the banana leaves years ago. Could this be Master Dongbin?” They hurriedly kowtowed, begging for conversion. Patriarch Lü gave this verse:

Nourish qi, forget words, guard,  
Lower heart to non-action.  
Know movement and stillness as ancestors,  
With no matter, seek no other.  
True constant must respond to things,  
Responding without confusion.  
Not confused, nature abides,  
Nature abides, qi returns.  
Qi returns, elixir self-forms,  
Within the vessel matches Kan and Li.  
Yin and yang generate return,  
Universal transformation with a single thunderclap.  
White clouds at the crown,  
Sweet dew sprinkles Sumeru.  
Drink the wine of longevity,  
Who can know carefree freedom?  
Sit and listen to the stringed tune,  
Clearly understand the mechanism of creation.  
All come in twenty lines,  
Truly the ladder to Heaven.

He also composed four quatrains:

To scoop the moon’s heart from the North Sea waves,  
First bind the clouds atop South Mountain ridge.  
If someone knows this meaning,  
They may fly as birds to see the Primal Lord.  
Half a moon shines over the West River,  
A crow flies north to the sea’s head.  
Moon sets, crow flies, seeking unseen,  
In the Palace of Vast Cold, riding a cow backwards.  
The mysterious northern gate opens all day,  
In the middle, a cavity, the mixed spirit platform.  
No lock, no guard, no keeper,  
Sun and moon freely come and go.  
Gather herbs by the moon above Heaven,  
Cultivate knowing the gold in water.  
Moon lacks geng qi, gold lacks water,  
Even with true lead, the heart is in vain.

He then pointed out the profound alchemical cultivation formula and departed. The two bowed and sent him off. The dao transformed into a pure breeze, leaving no trace.

The two devoted themselves to cultivation, avoiding contact with external things, practicing for over twenty years until the elixir was complete. They carved the prior hundred characters on stone, later called the Hundred-Character Stele. One day, a cloud crane circled above the cliff. Zhao Xiaoxian bathed and changed clothes, bidding farewell to the crowd: “The immortal master has come to receive me; I shall depart.” He sat down and spoke this verse:

Treading Wu mountains and Yue waters,  
A lifetime of drifting hat and pure breeze.  
Suddenly at the third watch, thunder arises,  
Clear and breaking through the void.

He then closed his eyes and transformed. Later, Huang Deyuan lived to one hundred and sixty-four years, also shedding his corpse to depart. This is later history, not told here.

In the year of Jichou, Monk Kou Yan of Tingshao practiced demonic arts, raising troops to plunder prefectures and counties; his army invaded Jianning. Song generals Chen Xue and military inspector Liu Chun led forces to defeat him. Liu Chun was a descendant of Liu Bei, admiring technique from youth, entering Mount Longhu where he met a strange man who taught him magic arts; now he used these arts to defeat Kou Yan. From then on, Buddhist influence waned; monks were persecuted, temples destroyed, monks suffered greatly. That winter, Song Emperor Lizong established Empress Xie, who was from Tiantai. She had one eye covered, her skin dark; she was filial and humble. When selected, she fell ill with a rash; upon recovery, her skin peeled revealing white jade-like flesh. She met a divine doctor who used medicine to remove the eye covering. Entering the palace, she was dignified and favored by the Empress Dowager, thus made empress.

In the year of Xinmao, the Jin changed its era name to Tianxing. The Mongols attacked Bian in May; a great plague struck Bianjing, killing countless people. Tolui died under his master; the army retreated. Mongol envoys came to Song, proposing to attack Jin, promising to return Henan to Song. Song then mobilized troops. The Mongol leader Qan’s brother Subutai led forces to join Song troops to attack Jin, besieging Bianjing.

In the spring of Guisi, the Jin ruler fled to Caizhou. Subutai took the Jin empress north. The dao was difficult and bitter; Subutai wished to slaughter Bian’s people, but Chu Cai hurried to plead, saving the people though the Wanyan clan was exterminated. In September, the armies again besieged Caizhou.

In the spring of Jiawu, Jin changed its era name to Wuduanping. The Jin ruler Aizong passed the throne to his son Chenglin. Song general Lingxia Meng Gong entered Cai, capturing the city; commander Shou Xu hanged himself. Chenglin died in battle; Zhang Tiangang was captured and taken to Song; Jin fell.

The Song emperor ordered the arrest of Tiangang in the Dali court. Lin’an prefect Xue Qiong said, “How do you have the face to come here?” Tiangang replied, “What dynasty has not risen and fallen? Now Jin has fallen; how are you two emperors better?” Xue Qiong reported his words; the emperor summoned him, saying, “Are you truly unafraid of death?” Tiangang said, “I fear only disloyalty; what is there to fear? I ask for death.” The emperor spared him. Later he met Patriarch Lü, who pitied his lonely loyalty, bringing him to Mount Siming to serve Master Ziqi as disciple, after which he attained the dao fruit. This is later history.

Meanwhile, Zhen Dexiu served as Song deputy prime minister, serving less than ten years, submitting hundreds of thousands of memorials, all addressing urgent affairs. He was the old daoist of Zhongnan who had left the spirit and not returned, his body burned by disciples, reborn in a new womb. Scholars called him Master of the Western Mountains. At that time, the Song emperor appointed Jia Fei’s younger brother Sidao as land registrar, who abused his favor. There was a man from Nanfeng, Yuan Shengsheng, styled Qianli, who possessed the law of cutting and thunder investigation. He traveled Jiangxi, exterminating demons and suppressing evil, residing in the city at the Dai family. One day he said to Dai, “After I die, burn my body.” After speaking, he died at over one hundred years old. His corpse was burned; in the smoke appeared a golden banner inscribed “Second Judge of Thunder and Lightning, Yuan Qianli,” ascending with the smoke. Truly:

Immortals descend to the world with cause,  
Returning without care for body beyond body.  
Untouched by fleeting fame and profit,  
Carefree and at ease, rejoicing in true nature.
