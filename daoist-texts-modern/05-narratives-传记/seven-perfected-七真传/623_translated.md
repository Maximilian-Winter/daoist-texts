# Chapter Twenty-Four: The Primordial Fate Rouses the Generals to Uphold the State; Imperial Edict Summons the Assembly of Immortals to Receive Their Ranks

**Poem:**

> Invited to roam the vast earth through springs and autumns,  
> Urging the present world to cultivate, yet none comply.  
> The mechanism of nature and life is worth guarding,  
> Do not entangle yourself in the snares of profit and fame.  
> A hundred years are limited, time hastens on,  
> In an instant, impermanence ends all affairs.  
> Turn back early and diligently refine your being,  
> That I may ascend with you to the Isle of Phoenix and Qilin.

Now, as the tale unfolds, there was Sa Shoujian of the Western River, born in the year of the Gengchen of the Yuanfu era, on the twenty-third day of the ninth month. At his birth, a red glow enveloped the chamber. From youth, he was steadfast and keen. At first, he studied medicine but mistakenly used drugs that caused death. Afterwards, he abandoned the household and pursued the dao, journeying far and wide to famed mountains. There he encountered the True Man Master Tie, who imparted wondrous teachings. Cultivating to fruition, he took the title Quanyangzi.

He once received the record of judiciary affairs for the nine provinces, overseeing the merits and faults of ghosts and spirits across the world, manifesting great divine power. Passing through Xiangyin’s Floating Bridge, he saw people offering sacrifices to temple gods using children, both boys and girls. Sa Shoujian said, “These are licentious spirits; their temples deserve burning.” As he spoke, thunder and fire soared into the sky, and the temple was instantly destroyed.

The venerable Sa then traveled far and wide to rescue and aid others. Over twelve years, he accumulated merits numbering in the hundreds of millions of billions. At the riverbank of Longxing, he washed his hands, holding water in his mouth and spitting it to cleanse. Suddenly, he saw a divine image reflected above his head in the water. Sa asked, “What spirit is this?” The spirit replied, “I am the Primordial Heavenly Commander, the Spirit Official of the Fire Chariot. For long I have dwelt in the Lingxiao Palace, receiving the Jade Edict’s temple offerings from Xiangyin, to punish the evil deeds of this region. Since the True Man burned my temple, I have followed him for twelve years, awaiting any misdeed to exact revenge. Now that the True Man’s功 (merit) is high and he is appointed to the Heavenly Pivot, I wish to serve as a subordinate general to aid in command.” Sa Shoujian swore an oath and expressed his feelings.

Later, arriving at Zhangzhou, one morning the generals appeared in their true forms, surrounding and attending him. The Heavenly Edict summoned him to the Heavenly Pivot. Sa received the edict, appointed as the chief of the Celestial Sect, the One-Origin Supreme True Lord. His banners, pennants, and canopies fluttered; celestial youths guided him upward to Heaven. Subsequently, he commanded the Spirit Official Wang to guard the dao gate. In the mortal world, those with true resolve who cultivate the dao and perform功 (merit) shall be protected by him. Should famine, tigers, wolves, ghosts, demons, evil men, or all manner of weapons, fire, and water arise, none shall harm their bodies.

He commands three thousand generals with silver teeth and phoenix beaks, a million tiger-headed soldiers, to protect the Profound Sect. This is not recorded here.

In the year of Bingshen, the Mongol Kuo Duan broke through Chengdu. The defenders of Wenzhou, Liu Rui and Zhao Ruxiang, held firm but reinforcements did not arrive. Liu Rui gathered his family and drank poison to die. When the city fell, Liu Rui and his two sons’ bodies were taken away. Zhao Ruxiang was captured and executed. The Mongols then invaded Jiangling. Meng Gong consecutively took twenty-four fortresses. They again invaded Zhenzhou, where Qiu Yue defeated them.

In the year of Dingyou, the Song dynasty changed its era to Jiaxi.

In the year of Jihai, the waters flooded the Gen Mountain Gate.

In the year of Xinchou, the Song changed its era to Chunyou. At this time, the Mongol ruler was fond of wine. Chu Cai admonished him, but the edict was to drink three measures daily. In the second month, the emperor fell gravely ill and his pulse ceased. Chu Cun said many prisoners were unjustly condemned and should be pardoned to seek Heaven’s favor. The emperor ordered a pardon, and his pulse returned. In the month of Zi, Chu Cai calculated the Taiyi numbers and advised the emperor not to go hunting. The emperor did not heed this and went out for five days, then died on the dao path. At this time, the Mongols’ Ma Zhen clan seized power. Chu Cai, frustrated by ignored counsel, died in sorrow. He had been prime minister for twenty years, leaving behind only qin and books.

In the year of Jiawu, the Mongols entered the Lianghuai region. Lü Wende defeated them soundly. They again invaded Shu, where Yu Jie defeated them. After the death of the Great Ancestor, six empresses ruled for five years. Chu Cai died, laws were inconsistent, and internal and external hearts divided. That autumn, Guiyou ascended as Dingzong, the eldest son of the Great Ancestor. That winter, news came of Meng Gong’s death in Song; the Mongols split their forces to attack Jianghuai.

In the year of Dingwei, the Song appointed Zhao Kui to command Jianghuai’s troops against them.

In the year of Jiyou, the Song’s Consort Sun gave birth to a son who did not cry but was dull, hence named Min.

In the year of Gengxu, Jia Sidao was appointed to govern Lianghuai, dismissing Zhao Kui. The Mongol ruler Dingzong died.

In the year of Xinhai, the eldest son of Tolui, Möngke, was enthroned as Xianzong. The younger brother Kublai was ordered to oversee Mongol and Han territories. Hearing of Yao Shu’s dao, he summoned him, who humbly accepted counsel. They divided their forces to take Huai and Shu. The Song appointed Shi Tianze to manage Henan, where military and civilians were greatly pacified.

In the year of Renzi, the calendar was adjusted to Tianli, and Prince Min was titled Yi Wang.

In the year of Guichou, the Song changed its era to Baoyou. The emperor worried about Sichuan, hearing that Yu Jie had lost military spirit, so he replaced him with Yu Hui. Yu Jie, hearing this, was uneasy and died suddenly one night. Later, some saw him at Qingcheng Mountain, sitting on a rock with a purple-bearded daoist, saying, “I was overwhelmed with worry and despair, suddenly met Elder Yao who, by order of Zhongli Elder, awakened me here.” The old man bowed twice, then vanished. Returning to Yu’s residence, he reported the vision and was ordered not to speak further.

In the year of Jiayin, an edict confiscated Yu Jie’s family property to reward the army. Yu Jie’s son, Rusu, was poor and unable to repay debts. He met the True Man Tang, who gifted him ginger that transformed into gold. Rusu sold it in the market; a merchant named Hu bought tens of thousands, saying, “This gold is Tang True Man’s elixir gold, able to repel water and fire, ensure good harvests, and is revered abroad as a supreme treasure.” Rusu thus repaid debts and established his household. This is not recorded here.

Meanwhile, Yu Hui repeatedly suffered defeat in Shu and was recalled. Kublai recommended Xu Heng as the chief scholar of Jingzhao, but he did not come. Hearing that Liu Bingzhong of Xingtai had dao, living reclusively on Mount Wuan, Kublai summoned Monk Haiyun and Bingzhong together. Kublai saw their talents and recommended Bingzhong as prime minister, founding Kaiping Prefecture. The Mongol ruler wished to personally campaign against Song and sought divination. Bingzhong said, “The Song’s national strength is waning, but the ruler’s southern expedition is inauspicious.”

In the year of Dingyi, the Song appointed Zhao Kui as junior protector. Jia Sidao accused him of embezzling military funds; Kui was dismissed and died of illness.

In the year of Jiwei, the Song changed its era to Kaiqing. The Mongol ruler heard of Zhao Kui’s death and personally led troops to replace Shu, but died in camp. Kublai crossed the river; Jiang and Huai prefectures surrendered. The Song was greatly alarmed, appointing Wu Qian as left prime minister and Sidao as right prime minister. Sidao secretly sent envoys to seek peace; Kublai withdrew his forces.

In the year of Gengshen, the Song changed its era to Jingding. Kublai ascended as Yuan Shizu, establishing the era Zhongtong and founding the Great Yuan. Hearing that Song Piyun had dao, he was titled Tongxuan Hongjiao Piyun Zhenren, overseeing daoist affairs throughout the realm. The monk Sima was made national master, overseeing all Buddhist affairs, honored alongside Song Piyun. Envoys were sent to Annam and Goryeo, both requesting surrender. At this time, the Song dismissed Wu Qian from Xun Prefecture; Jia Sidao again sent poison to kill him. Wu Qian had attained the dao under Peng Helin. Upon poisoning, he told his family, “I shall die. If there is wind and thunder at night, do not be alarmed.” That night, indeed, great wind and thunder roared, and his body was never found.

In the autumn of the year Jiazi, a comet appeared near the willow. Liu Bingzhong told the emperor, “The Song ruler is about to perish.” Yuan changed its era to Zhiyuan. Bingzhong was appointed grand protector. In the tenth month of winter, the Song emperor died; the crown prince Ji ascended as Duzong. In the year Yichou, the era changed to Xianning. On the day Dingmao, Consort Quan was made empress. On the day Jisi, Lü Wende died of a back ulcer. In the spring of the year Gengwu, the assistant chancellor Jiang Wanli urgently requested troops to relieve Xiangyang and Fancheng. Sidao did not respond; Jiang Wanli requested to leave. At this time, the Mongol prime minister Lian Xixian managed affairs with moderation. Jia Sidao, unconcerned with the court, spent days sitting on Geling, building towers, entertaining courtiers, and sculpting his own likeness inside. He built the Duobao Pavilion, storing treasures and antiques. He established the Yunshui Studio, with two daoists always seated, drinking excessively. When family tried to remove them, they were found with sword and qin bags.

Soon, two daoists came to visit, saying, “We have heard the prime minister’s conduct is reckless; tolerance is a virtue, why resist? We come as old acquaintances and offer a poem:”

> The prime minister’s power and might are extreme and cruel,  
> The state is on the brink, yet you remain at ease.  
> The cricket’s fight is half done,  
> The north wind blows through the cottonwood cold.

The white-robed daoist said, “Favor breeds harm, soon half the realm will be stained with blood and filth; you cannot escape the dark retribution, yet you dare to be so arrogant! I am Wu Commander Zhou; this is Guannei Marquis Ge.” The yellow-robed daoist said, “When fortune ends, one faces the tiger’s mouth; only pity is the defilement of my sacred mountain.” They clasped hands and departed proudly. Sidao asked a scholar, “These are righteous men.”

In the year of Guiyou, Yuan captured Fan and Xiang.

In the year of Jiaxu, Jiang Wanli resigned and lived in Rao. That autumn, the Song emperor died. Sidao installed Duke Jiaguo Liang as Emperor Gong, aged four, with Empress Dowager Xie as regent. His elder brother Gang was titled Prince Ji, and younger brother Ang Prince Xin. Liu Bingzhong resided in Nanping Hermitage and died without illness. The Yuan ruler mourned and ordered Boyan to invade south, attacking Ezhou. Commander Zhang Shijie fought fiercely, repelling them. Boyan left, besieging Ezhou and taking Jinghu. The young Song emperor was frightened and fell ill. The physician Li Lizhi was summoned and his illness cured.

---

In the year Yihai, the Song changed its era to Deyou. Sidao arrived at Wuhu to request peace, but Boyan refused. The prefect of Chizhou, Zhao Ang, died with his wife; Boyan ordered their burial. One night, a violent storm broke their tomb, and their bodies vanished. Jiang Wanli drowned. Various southern counties either surrendered or fled. Jiangxi commander Miyou died in battle. Zhang Shijie recaptured Rao Prefecture. Eastern Jiangsu counties all submitted to Yuan. Commander Meng Ji took Shashi; Sima Meng sought death. In the sixth month, an edict ordered Jia Sidao to be settled in Kuaiji; Zheng Huchen was assigned to guard him. At Mian’an Temple in Zhangzhou, he was killed, fulfilling the omen of the earlier poem.

In the year Bingzi, Tan Prefecture was taken; the judge Li Fu and his entire family remained loyal. The prefect of Hengzhou Gou set fire to his home, killing his family. Hunan’s army fell. Wen Tianxiang begged Princes Ji and Xin to guard Min and Guang; the empress dowager consented and appointed Tianxiang right prime minister to protect the two princes’ southern retreat. Boyan’s troops reached Lin’an, confiscated records, sealed the treasury, and detained the empress dowager and Song emperor northward.

In the year Bingzi, Tianxiang reached Wenzhou, escorting Prince Gang to open the government in Fuzhou. That summer, Prince Gang ascended as Emperor Duanzong, changing the era to Jingyan. Prince Jing was titled Prince Wei. The Yuan ruler deposed Emperor Liang, making him Duke of Yingguo, who soon became a monk. The empress dowager became a nun, residing together at Zhengzhi Temple.

Yuan divided forces to take Min and Guang. Zhang Shijie escorted the emperor by sea, fleeing to Chaozhou. The Yuan ruler appointed Zhang Hongfan as marshal. On the day Wuyin, he led troops into Min and Guang.

In the fourth month of summer, Emperor Duanzong died at Gang Prefecture. The ministers wished to disperse. Lu Xiufu urged to enthrone Prince Wei, changing the era to Xiangxing, making him Emperor Jing. Lu Xiufu was appointed left prime minister, sharing power with Zhang Shijie. The emperor was moved to Yashan. A great star flowed south, falling into the sea, followed by over a thousand smaller stars, their sound like thunder. Tianxiang was made junior protector and Duke of Xinguo. At this time, a great epidemic struck the central army; Tianxiang’s son Daosheng died, and Fosheng was captured. In the sixth month, Zhang Hongfan captured Tianxiang, who firmly requested death. Shijie fought fiercely but was defeated. Lu Xiufu carried Emperor Liang to the sea and died. The emperor raised a white pheasant, striking and wailing, then drowned in devotion. Hongfan’s troops retreated; Shijie recovered the emperor’s body and buried him with Duanzong. The scattered forces gathered somewhat. Hearing that Prince Yi’s son was in Guang, they plotted to enthrone him. Suddenly, a fierce storm arose. Shijie climbed the helm tower, burning incense and praying, “Does Heaven intend to destroy the Zhao clan?” The wind and waves worsened, capsizing the boat and drowning him. The generals abandoned his body at Xiangshan, and the troops dispersed. The Song fell; Yuan unified the realm.

Yuan Shizu, recalling his ancestors’ founding of the realm, revered the dao and exalted immortals. Now having established the Great Yuan and unified the world, all depended on the protection of the immortals and true beings. Thus, he issued an edict:

All these true ancestral masters have been further honored and their treasures widely proclaimed. It is decreed throughout the realm: Tianqing Temple shall be renamed Xuanniao Temple; all palaces and temples shall be granted plaques and edicts for construction. The profound dao’s wind blows mightily, and the transformation of the dao flourishes.

Meanwhile, the True Man of Changchun, having completed the dao, wandered in Fang Mountain, then journeyed to Wangwu Mountain, where he met Wang Yuyang. Together they went to the True Cavern of Zhongnan to pay respects to their master. Chongyang joyfully said, “Your功 (merit) and cultivation are high; there is no need to go out to practice功 (merit). Stay here awaiting the summons to ascend. We shall wait for the gathering of all dao friends and together journey to Penglai and Yingzhou.”

---

Meanwhile, Ma Danyang practiced功 (merit) in southern Min. Seeing the Song dynasty had fallen, he returned to the Primordial Unity, knowing Changchun had long completed the dao and wished to return to Zhongnan. Passing by Jun Mountain on Dongting Lake, they saw a tavern shrouded in white clouds, knowing a high immortal dwelled there. The two immortals entered and saw the two ancestors Zhong and Lü transformed into two wandering dao companions, drinking with a certain ragged dao friend. The two immortals recognized them and bowed. The three feigned madness and laughed, leading Danyang and Bu’er to Zhongnan Cave. Chongyang led the sons to pay respects to the patriarch. The next day, Immortals Tan and Liu also arrived. Soon after, Hao Taigu brought Teng Gu into the cave to pay respects to the patriarch and the other immortals.

At this time, the assembly of immortals gathered, discussing功 (merit) and deeds. Suddenly, a cloud crane circled the sky, celestial music resounded, banners and standards fluttered, and from a cloud chariot emerged an immortal official—none other than the Heavenly Master Xu Jingyang. By the Jade Edict, he descended and proclaimed:

---

> On the path between humans and heavens, doing good comes first;  
> In the immortal registry,功 (merit) ranks supreme.  
>功 (Merit) high and virtue broad, immortal names are inscribed;  
> Complete in dao and spirit, the Jade Capital registers you.  
> Lord Wang True Man once received the Jade Edict, descended to accumulate功 (merit),  
>玄功 (Profound功) well established, ordered Zhengyang and Quanyang to lead their sons,  
> Early to ascend Lingxiao to receive their offices.  
> The imperial decree is issued; all should heed this.

---

The immortals bowed and, in an instant, each mounted cloud chariots, ascending to Heaven as commanded. Banners and ceremonial guards, golden youths and jade maidens, paired as guides, led them upward to Lingxiao.

Zhengyang and Quanyang led the immortals first to pay respects to the Four Great Kings and the two classes of heavenly saints, immortals, and officials; next to the Four Emperors and Four Heavenly Masters; then to the Tongming Hall to pay homage to the Supreme Jade Emperor. Upon seeing them, the Jade Emperor’s face lit with joy. He issued an edict bestowing titles: Zhengyang as Supreme Minister of the Golden Palace; Quanyang as Inner Minister of Jade Purity; Sa Shoujian as Inner Minister of the Heavenly Pivot; Liu Haichan as Right Minister of Heavenly Mechanism; Zhang Boduan as East Flower Attendant Immortal; Wang Zhiming as Flying Rain, Wondrous Transformation, Assistant Supreme True Man; Qiu Chuji as Heavenly Immortal Top Scholar; Sun Bu’er as Leader of the Female Immortals and Supreme Immortal. The other immortals were each granted True Man offices and assigned to famous mountains, blessed lands, and wondrous caverns to reside. When功 (merit) was achieved, further rewards would be granted.

The immortals accepted their offices, bowed in thanks, and respectfully withdrew. Each returned by cloud journey to their cavernous blessed abodes, living joyfully and freely, continuing to accumulate功 (merit) and guide others. Truly:

>功 (Merit) perfected, dao complete, the day of true realization;  
> Obedient to the edict, they ascend as immortals to the upper realms.  
> The heavenly roster marks them high for all ages to admire;  
> The Golden Lotus History records their deeds without falsehood.

**Postscript**

The world’s people often deride the Profound Sect, saying that cultivating immortality and realizing the dao are all baseless tales. Yet, upon reading the *Golden Lotus Immortal History*, one finds dynasty, place, year, and family names all clearly verifiable. Is this not sufficient to call it a trustworthy history? The *History* records the traces and paths of immortals and the dao, not only emphasizing arduous cultivation but especially the accumulation of功 (merit) and deeds, described in great detail. The subtle and profound mysteries are for each reader to grasp intuitively—what can be taught by intention but not by words. Though sects are named, their source is one. The Three Treasures and Five Phases are especially crucial.

Speaking of the easy, the Great Dao is fundamentally ordinary, not in dazzling marvels or prideful strangeness; speaking of the difficult, it is like climbing a stone mountain, higher and more perilous, with every step a struggle, risking all prior功 (merit). If people could neither neglect the easy for endurance nor fear the difficult for steadfastness, perhaps they could truly discuss the Profound.

In the autumn of the year Wujia, the Fire Daoist received this *History* and was instructed to print and circulate it in the world. I received and read it, feeling a wondrous stream of inspiration, unceasing and abundant. It is truly of great功 (merit) for those in the yellow cap class. Thus, I entrust it to pear and jujube trees to nourish the awakened multitudes, serving as a guiding beacon for later learners.

Respectfully inscribed in the autumn month of the thirty-fourth year of Guangxu by Chang Baozi.
