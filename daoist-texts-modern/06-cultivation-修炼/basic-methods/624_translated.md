# Preface

I have often pondered that the source of the dao springs forth from a true and unbroken lineage; myriad methods do not stray beyond the one mind. Extending this thought broadly, the *Dao De Jing* unfolds in five thousand words; condensing it further, the oral transmission distills into sixteen characters. All those who branch into separate schools and open distinct gates, for the most part, are but different roads converging upon the same destination.

Yet in this world, those who yearn for the dao merely journey to Kongtong Mountain to seek it out, striving to strip away flesh and cleanse marrow, hoping to transform their mortal bones without the Golden Elixir. They set their fate and seek the true, speak of profound mysteries, yet fail to awaken. They have not grasped that the principle esteems a focused heart; the method demands a single thread; to attain the core of its essence, one must rely on the mutual transmission of guidance.

In my leisure time, having devoted many years to the dao, I have long preserved the scripture *Dragon Gate Heart Method* by the Venerable Wang, the founding immortal of the White Cloud Temple at the dawn of the dynasty. Morning and evening, I exhaust myself in its substance and function, and suddenly a faint light dawns upon me.

Later, I sought out my kindred spirits: Abbot Zhang Gengyun of the White Cloud Temple and the alchemist Qin Yunqiao—three comrades united in purpose. We lamented that this manuscript remains but a private copy, unavailable to the world. Yet the two gentlemen said, “The Venerable One’s name is immortalized in the Purple Mansion, revered in the Divine Capital. Since this text exists, if scholars wish to delve deeply, they can set foot firmly on the ground. Truly, the benevolent see it as benevolence; the wise see it as wisdom.”

Now, as the altar is opened and the precepts transmitted, brave seekers of the dao from all under Heaven gather here. This is the moment to proclaim it far and wide, then to entrust it to the printing press.

I gladly dare not keep it secret. As a permanent resident, I offer funds, wishing it to be engraved and circulated. Recalling back to the early years of the Shunzhi reign, extending to the beginning of Tongzhi, the Venerable One’s hidden virtue accumulated long ago; today, to illuminate this subtle radiance is truly a cause for boundless rejoicing.

I only hope that those who are divine and enlightened need not seek the wondrous medicines of Penglai or the celestial vessels of the heavens, nor yearn for the brilliance of feathered wheels and jade trees. If so, then my humble fortune is fulfilled.

Thus, I compose this preface.

Respectfully inscribed on the first day of the fifth month, summer of the tenth year of Tongzhi, Great Qing.
