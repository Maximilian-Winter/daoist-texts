# One, The True Words of the Mind Method

In the second year of the Kangxi reign, the year of the Gui Mao, on an auspicious day in the tenth month, Master Kunyangzi delivered the precepts at the Jade Garden in Jinling. He spoke to Master Ningzhenzi Shao Shoushan and Master Fuyaozi Zhan Shouchun, saying:

“Since my childhood, I have yearned for the dao, discerning the illusory nature of fleeting life, the ever-shifting phantom realm. To escape the wheel of rebirth, one must early cultivate the supreme dao. Though Kongtong is near, Master Guangchengzi has not yet permitted our meeting; though Penglai Isle is not distant, how can a mortal body truly attain it? One must resolutely avoid all defilement, sweep away every mote of dust, cleanse the heart and chest, purify the faintest thoughts and intentions, wear away the knots of habit until worldly notions turn to ash, and purge the body’s desires so that the roots of delusion are severed. All attachments cease at once, arising step by step from the foundation of precepts and concentration; myriad worries return to emptiness, each layer revealed through wisdom’s own light. When one can break free, the child of the Way finds tranquility; when one sees through it all, patience naturally arises. Thus, raise your brows, and with your hand draw the knife that severs passion; loosen your steps and ascend straight to the ferryman who crosses the world. Turning over your body means liberation from the wheel of rebirth; turning your thoughts means transcending the net of snares. Compassion does not fade; as the ancients say, ‘Save yourself to save others.’ Benevolence and vow endure always: ‘I desire to save myself and thereby save them.’”

“Remembering those past years of seeking truth and visiting the dao, I once ascended Wangwu Mountain and encountered an enlightened master. Above, I received the vast grace of the Three Treasures and personally heard the dharma treasure; below, I relied on the strength of my own body, enduring hardship to cultivate myself. I took refuge in the supreme Dharma King and practiced the wondrous dao of the Great Vehicle. Such fortune comes only in a flourishing age of peace and joy, rarely heard in ten thousand kalpas, seldom seen in a thousand lives. How dare I not spread the Three Treasures and repay the fourfold kindness! Though my wish is but a tiny mote, I offer the brightness of my heart.”

“Therefore, not forgetting my presumptuous faults, I open this altar to preach the precepts; I do not shrink from mockery or slander, but expound the teaching and discuss the scriptures. This is not for fame or vanity, but to dispel error and resolve doubt. Heaven’s laws do not tolerate flowery words; the supreme dao lies only in straight speech. I carefully present the family tradition of the seventh generation of the Dragon Gate lineage to all the people. Reverently recording the candid words of the Jade Garden, may they universally benefit humans and heavens alike. I dare not use empty phrases—why not speak plainly? Now I shall transmit to you, precisely to guide the ignorant and clarify the true dharma.”

“If there be among you those bright-eyed masters of the highest vehicle, this humble daoist is fortunate indeed and wishes to humbly request your kind instruction, to verify what I have heard—this is my sincere desire.”

Upon hearing these teachings, the two disciples bowed and withdrew, standing in order to the east and west.

Then, disciple Shi Shouping of Guangling bowed his head and chanted:

“The dharma’s origin is no-dharma, for the mind has it;  
The mind is originally no-mind, thus the dharma is emptiness.  
When the mind manifests the Dharma King, the mind manifests form;  
The dharma returns to the mind’s lordship, the dharma returns to emptiness.  
To truly understand the fixed dharma is not to see a perfect form;  
One must awaken that the ordinary mind is the sacred mind.  
Mind is dharma, dharma is mind, mind is dharma and dharma is dharma;  
The dharma mind’s liberation is the true confidant.”
