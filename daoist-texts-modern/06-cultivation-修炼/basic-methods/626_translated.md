# Two: Taking Refuge in the Three Treasures

The Three Treasures are the Dao, the Scripture, and the Master. The Dao itself is originally empty space—formless and nameless. Without the scripture, the Dao cannot be made clear. The Dao dwells within the scriptures, deep, subtle, and wondrous; without a master, one cannot grasp its principle. If one does not take refuge in the Three Treasures, one is bound to sink into false paths, turning upside down in confusion and bewilderment. All who cultivate the true path of the Dao, those who sincerely vow to submit themselves, must cherish the thought that such an encounter is rare and precious.

First, take refuge in the unsurpassed Treasure of the Dao, wishing that all beings may forever serve the Heavenly Venerable and escape the cycle of rebirth.  
Second, take refuge in the unsurpassed Treasure of the Scripture, wishing that all beings, through countless lives and generations, may hear the true dharma.  
Third, take refuge in the unsurpassed Treasure of the Master, wishing that all beings may learn the highest vehicle and never fall into false views.

These three refuges are the first step on the path that sages of old used to guide people into the Dao, the foremost gate to enter virtue. To become immortal, to realize the Dao, to become sage or worthy—none do so without beginning here, with the Three Refuges. Why is this so? Because life and death, the great matter of existence, depend on causes and conditions that are subtle and secret, difficult to see or hear. The supreme vehicle’s wondrous method of liberation, without a true master’s compassionate revelation and guidance to awaken the spiritual mechanism, how could one suddenly comprehend the great vehicle’s orthodox essence, gradually enter the wondrous path of emptiness, and not fall into false views or stray into side paths?

Therefore, those who have not yet understood the Dao first take refuge in the scripture. Those who have not yet understood the scripture first take refuge in the master. If one can take refuge in the master’s treasure, then the scripture’s treasure can be heard amid silence. If one can hear the scripture’s treasure, then the Dao’s treasure can be seen amid invisibility. What was once unseen and unheard suddenly becomes clear and penetrating—all thanks to the power of taking refuge in the master’s treasure. Naturally, one awakens to the true text, understands the correct dharma, transcends life and death, and escapes the wheel of rebirth.

But the method of taking refuge in the Three Treasures that I speak of requires taking refuge in the true Three Treasures. Why so? People nowadays treat the Three Refuges as something ordinary—morning and evening, before the sacred images, they recite and bow, yet never truly chew over the essence of refuge, never ask why they come. Thus, they inevitably sink into false teachings and cannot escape the wheel of rebirth. How then can they understand the great Dao and be freed from life and death?

Taking refuge in the Three Treasures means:  
Taking refuge with the mind, so that thoughts are free from birth and death—then the Dao treasure can be made clear;  
Taking refuge with the heart, so that the mechanism is unobstructed—then the scripture treasure can be realized;  
Taking refuge with the body, so that the eyes see no sights, the ears hear no sounds, the nose smells no odors, the tongue tastes no flavors, the hands move not in folly, the feet walk not in error; free from evil, lust, cunning, and impurity; practicing austerities, wearing down sinews and bones, starving the flesh, subduing limbs, abandoning the physical form—then the master’s treasure can be moved and felt.

If one can move the master’s compassion and transmit the scripture and the Dao, one must first take refuge in one’s own body, heart, and mind as the true Three Treasures. If the ears and eyes of the body have not forgotten their seeing and hearing, one is not lost in color nor attached to emptiness. As long as sound and color remain, the body is not true. If it is not true, how can it move the master? If one can hold the body upright, practice nourishing the root, and align the mind with the true constant, then moment by moment emptiness is clear and serene—this is called taking refuge in the Three Treasures. If the body is free from evil lust, then the master’s treasure can be moved; if the heart is not darkened, then the scripture treasure can be realized; if the mind is not divided, then the Dao treasure can be made clear. When the body is firm, essence is full and the form strong; when the heart is spiritual, qi is pure and wisdom flows; when the mind is sincere, the spirit condenses and the nature manifests. When essence and qi are sufficient, spirit and intelligence transform into primordial wonder beyond measure—all arise from taking refuge in one’s own body, heart, and mind as the Three Treasures. From these arise the Dao, the Scripture, and the Master.

Now, how does one take refuge in the Three Treasures of body, heart, and mind? Listen carefully, all of you who set your hearts sincerely. I now explain the method of taking refuge in the Three Treasures of body, heart, and mind, to help you break through darkness and remove doubt.

All of you, this body is formed from the father’s essence and mother’s blood, joined and shaped; emotion, nature, appearance, and limbs all grow from the womb. A mass of filth enclosed in the four great elements’ skin bag—eyes see, ears hear, feet move, hands wave, mouth speaks, tongue tastes—none of these are lasting or truly good. If used well, one becomes immortal or Buddha, sage or worthy; if used poorly, one becomes demon or monster, ghost or beast. Turn upward and one may ascend to Heaven; turn downward and one may fall to Hell. Those who receive blessings treat this as an external object; those who suffer evil treat this as their foundation. How much more so, you who have left the world to transcend life and death? You must take refuge in this body to be proper. Otherwise, the six roots act outwardly, the three poisons arise within; myriad calamities and countless disasters, nine demons and ten trials—all arise from the body. How can one cultivate and enter the Dao?

If you wish to take refuge, there is only one method to control this body: you must observe the precepts, restrain the wild form. Use the four great dignified manners as your guide—walking, standing, sitting, lying—restrain yourself with uprightness. Let the ears not hear sounds, the eyes not see colors; maintain a dignified and wondrous appearance, upright and compassionate, so that people see and rejoice, and reverence arises. The precepts restrain the wild body, transforming it into the Dharma form, and then the master’s treasure can be taken as refuge. All of you, this first stage has been made clear: you must take refuge with the heart.

Now, the heart is different from the body. It is perilous and ever changing, beyond measure—like wind blowing over the deep sea, the waters surge violently, waves and tides rise and fall unpredictably, tossing and turning without rest. Since kalpas past, there has been no day to emerge, no shore to reach—an endless sea of suffering. Now, if you wish to take refuge in this heart, understand that it is a mass of flesh and blood, not lasting or truly good. It craves sound and color, disregards law and punishment; it loves sweet food, heedless of losing body and life. It sinks into hungry ghosts and beasts without fear, walks into mountains of knives and fires unafraid; it flows into plagues and pestilence without complaint, stirs up falling stars and collapsing mountains without avoidance. All manner of calamities arise from this heart’s summons and lead the way. The six thieves are its vanguard, the seven emotions its commanders. If one wishes to cultivate but does not first take refuge in this heart, how can one subdue demons and monsters, remove the seven hindrances and dispel evil, penetrate the primordial mechanism, understand the true dharma, and deeply grasp the essence to enter the highest vehicle?

Yet to control this heart, one must observe the precepts and enter meditation, rein in the horse and wield the whip, turn back the wind and extinguish the flame. When the heart’s fire of ignorance is quelled, patience’s water overcomes it. Transform fierce flames into the wind of wisdom, change ignorance into great intelligence. Turn evil causes into good fruits, resolve sorrow and resentment into joy and delight. Dispel sound and color as floating dust, convert laziness and neglect into reverence and respect. Let no dull grime arise, no confusion over right and wrong, no battle of coming and going, no rise and fall, no shifting of gain and loss, no turning and tossing. Naturally, qi settles and the heart calms; heart calm, qi settled—and then the scripture treasure can be taken as refuge. All of you, once you have the power of concentration, subdued the wild heart of flesh and blood, the waves quiet, the wind still, the water smooth, the moon rises, pearls shine with light, wisdom penetrates the scripture’s essence, intelligence reaches the scripture’s meaning.

You must also take refuge in this intention. This intention is even harder to control than the heart. The heart seeks correctness; the intention seeks sincerity. Sincerity means carefulness and subtlety. In concentration, it is subtle and clear, fully distinct, not hiding the slightest trace, neither dual nor ceasing, movement and stillness as one, light shining everywhere. Therefore, before taking refuge in the intention, one still fears the heart’s calmness. Secretly grasping control, the mechanism twists and deceives; illusions and confusion multiply, coming and going. Many paths of creation arise, vanishing and appearing suddenly; waves turn into clever shapes, like dragons and tigers. Impossible to capture, like shadows and wind; though one may try to grasp, no form can be seen. An inch of mechanism shoots a thousand pounds, silent and unheard; a drop of water carries ten thousand bushels, plotting ten thousand schemes. Unfathomable divine powers, stealing the sun and sky, boundless trickery—all this, once the intention takes refuge, dissolves like water and crumbled tiles, myriad phenomena return to spring. One may enter sagehood and true realization, ascend to immortality and perfect the Dao. In mundane affairs, one guides transformation; the nation governs, the people are at peace; times harmonize, years are abundant; loyalty, filial piety, chastity, righteousness, humility, purity, and integrity all arise sincerely from the intention. The Three Bonds and Five Relationships emerge from sincere intention; the Nine Schools and Three Teachings arise from sincere intention. Between sincerity and insincerity lie fortune and misfortune, calamity and blessing, good and evil, prosperity and decline—all depend on this intention. It is the cause and condition of life and death, the fruit of the wheel of rebirth.

All of you, if you do not take refuge in this intention, the heart will be hard to settle. If you wish for calm and stability, take refuge in this intention. The light of wisdom naturally shines brightly; awakening allows each thing to be clearly understood. Before this thought arises, the mind is pure and clear. At the first sprout of thought, it may be good or evil. Not darkening the spiritual light, the mechanism turns on its pivot, stars follow the Dipper’s movement. If the intention is sincere, one holds the power of life and death. If the intention is not sincere, who wields the handle of the wheel of rebirth?

All of you, your own mind’s treasure of intention—one sincere pure thought—can reach Heaven above and strike through the Underworld below. Ghosts and gods lose their color because of this intention; sun and moon lose their brightness because of this intention; creation loses its power because of this intention; yin and yang lose their order because of this intention; demons and monsters flee because of this intention; people vanish because of this intention. Within and beyond the Three Realms, only intention is supreme. Let it go and it exists; draw it in and it vanishes. Free and unfettered, nothing is not this intention. Above, it ascends to the Primordial as ancestral qi; in the middle, it returns to the Numinous Treasure as Brahma qi; below, it relies on the Most High as true qi; it extends broadly as vast qi; condenses warmly as primordial qi; compassion and kindness as yang qi; sorrow, anger, and punishment as yin qi; greed, hatred, restlessness, and violence as blood qi; lust, killing, stealing, and lies as evil qi; attachment and obstruction as demon qi; cruelty and darkness as monster qi; calamity and oppression as resentment qi—all arise from you.

If the body does not take refuge in the master’s treasure, it indulges the fierce and strong. If the heart does not take refuge in the scripture’s treasure, it grows confused and dark. If the intention does not take refuge in the Dao’s treasure, it becomes mixed and troubled. Partial and insincere, insincerity loses the center; losing the center, the light of wisdom does not arise; concentration is unstable; precepts are not strict; spirit cannot condense; qi cannot gather; essence cannot transform. Therefore, the body cannot cultivate, the heart cannot settle, the intention cannot be sincere.

All of you, I now clearly point out the great Dao, directly to the human heart. If you do not quickly subdue your body, heart, and intention, transform them into the true Three Treasures, and thereby cross beyond the wheel of rebirth, then taking refuge in the Three Treasures of the world’s first awakeners, the first teachers of the Dao and scriptures, will be in vain—wasting the precious cause of leaving the world. If there is one who can rely on the three great methods of precepts, concentration, and wisdom, practicing with sincere faith, never wavering or retreating, know that this person will surely attain the Dao. If there is even a slight deviation, unable to hold fast, lazy and negligent, know that this person’s sins are deep and blessings thin, unable to understand the Dao, not accepted by heavenly spirits—how could they hear the unsurpassed, most true, pure, serene, and liberating Dao? If you meet such people, do not scold or rebuke; instead, show compassion, use skillful means, and gently guide them into the Dao—this is called taking refuge in the Three Treasures.

Then the disciples of the precepts bowed their heads and took refuge, composing this verse:  
“The great Dao is pure and empty, beyond naming;  
Through scriptures’ subtle mysteries it is revealed in writing.  
If not for the master’s unveiling of the primal principle,  
How could the muddled and foolish ever understand?  
Bright and continuous, called the Complete Reality,  
Fully attaining the true primordial, escaping life and death.  
Foreknowing, foreawakened, compassionate and earnest,  
Endlessly virtuous and good, leading into the gate.”
