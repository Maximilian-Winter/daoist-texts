# Three: Repentance of Sins and Karmic Offenses

Beloved assembly! Having already taken refuge in the Three Treasures, you must faithfully cultivate the wondrous path. The Most High declares: “Misfortune and blessing have no fixed gate; only people themselves summon them. The retribution of good and evil follows like shadow chasing form.” Therefore, Heaven and Earth appoint deities to oversee offenses, who, according to the weight of one’s transgressions, subtract from one’s allotted lifespan. If the offense is slight, numbering in the hundreds, those who seek longevity must first avoid them. Sins and karmic offenses are what we call faults and failings. Nowadays, those who cultivate the dao often obscure their own clear knowing, deceive their own true nature, seeing only the faults of others but not their own errors. To be unaware of one’s own faults is already to deepen sin and burden karma. To hide one’s heart and cloud oneself—how can such a one enter the dao? Thus, one must repent. Repentance means respectfully facing the holy and numinous, daring not to conceal past faults, painfully establishing vows never to repeat former mistakes. Only thus can one advance upward.

Now I shall not spare harsh words, to instruct those who hide their hearts and cloud themselves, explaining clearly and plainly. Everyone, listen well, so that you may understand for yourselves. Let us speak of what it means to hide the heart and cloud oneself. With mouth wide open, one speaks grandly and boldly, yet in the heart covets goods and wealth; outwardly one acts with propriety and rank, inwardly scheming mechanically; taking precepts but not following the rules, urging others not to fear fault; by day a daoist, by night a secret rogue; speaking among peers with disbelief, always excusing oneself; hearing the dao but not practicing it, knowing the law yet deliberately offending; using cunning to deceive the foolish, taking advantage as a natural course; habitually arising in ignorance, often stubborn and unyielding; turning nothing into something, and something into nothing; mistaking falsehood for truth, and truth for falsehood; calling a deer a horse, selling a dog and hanging a sheep; scheming in dark chambers, stirring mischief under clear skies; plotting in the belly, hiding knives behind smiles. Such myriad evil deeds, each one against the dao, none unknown to oneself. Those who do not know are fools, ignorant ones, deluded and reckless. Those who know yet deliberately offend are called by the briefest terms: knaves, evildoers, villains, scoundrels. Is this not hiding the heart and clouding oneself? Their sins and karmic offenses are even deeper and heavier than those of the foolish and deluded. Why so? The foolish and ignorant lack wisdom, err unknowingly, can only harm themselves and not others; if they harm others, they will ultimately be harmed in turn. Only the knavish and evil are sly and cunning, harming others to benefit themselves, then clouding their own hearts to deceive, striving that Heaven and Earth not know their treachery, that ghosts and gods not perceive their wickedness. Crafty illusions and devices, always concealing their ways; plotting deeply and intricately, weaving crooked and extensive nets. Setting traps for others, who do not perceive whence the nets are cast; pushing others into wells, whose opening no one can guess. Such people abound in the world. Yet those who cultivate the dao must not be such. As before taking refuge in the Three Treasures, if one harbors such a heart, now having received the precepts, one must change one’s face and hasten to repent.

In recent days, the primordial wind has faltered, precepts have grown lax, the dao’s transformation declines, the yellow crown loses its teaching, repeatedly the disciples err and violate the rules. I now, without sparing harsh words, admonish and urge the assembly. Not only must one repent sins and offenses accumulated through kalpas of drifting and sinking, but also sins against one’s many lifetimes of parents, and sins against the nine primordial and seven ancestral parents now. Even one’s own past sins must be swiftly and secretly cleansed from the heart and mind. Every improper deluded thought, every slightest false notion, must be repented for past faults and regretted for former errors. Only then can one attain the rank of the dao; otherwise, it is like covering one’s ears while stealing a bell—how can one be freed? The great dao is far away! I now compose a repentance and vow text, which the assembly shall recite morning and evening.

## Repentance and Vow Text

Disciples all, since receiving the precepts until now, have only indulged in the empty fame of taking precepts, failing to uphold true matters. Wearing robes carelessly, passing the bowl in vain. Neither able to advance in the original truth, nor able to avoid grievous faults. The heart lacks wisdom, unable to earnestly inquire of enlightened masters; the nature is clouded by ignorance, often unable to endure insult among peers. Narrow-minded, unable to tolerate feelings; consciousness biased and perverse, causing many offenses. Not understanding true awakening, mistaking illusion for reality; not examining causes, recognizing thieves as sons. Taking the virtuous as bandits, confused and hard to discern; mistaking gentlemen for villains, unable to distinguish right and wrong. Sometimes collecting mistaken causes and effects, money and grain all entering private pockets; sometimes reciting scriptures with errors in words and names, completely unaware in thought. Sometimes moved by beautiful forms before the eyes, stirring lustful roots in the heart; sometimes hearing sacred words but harboring doubts in the belly. Various corrupt deeds, forever sinking into the mortal stream. If from now on one does not renew oneself, in the future at dusk and on a lost path, one will surely sink like a stone into the sea’s depths. If thereafter one still acts at will, when the bell tolls and the water clock runs out, one will know the sword tree and knife mountain. Therefore, here now, with heartfelt incense, heart lamp, and heartfelt offerings, exhaustively take refuge in body, spirit, and life with sincerity. At all times murmuring, gazing toward the cinnabar heavens and calming life; morning and evening diligently, looking up to the golden palace and paying homage with sincerity. Using fasting and bathing with reverence, not fearing hardship and toil. Turning over and again bowing to the master’s compassion. Setting up offerings, pleading for Heaven’s pardon! From this moment, remove all evils, forever be a person of goodness; from now on, strive to serve the truth, painfully guarding the precepts of original truth. If by chance one again violates former rules, one will suffer Heaven’s punishment in life, and in death fall to Fengdu; if violating the laws of the sun’s course, by day endure extreme punishment, by night be buried in the endless hell. Only wish that after repentance, sins be extinguished and blessings arise, disasters dissipate and calamities release, ice melts and the awakened earth opens, the waxing moon shines forth. The lacquer chamber brightens again, the sun of wisdom illuminates the dark night; good sprouts grow, sweet dew drips upon withered branches. The primal thread flows with the mercy of rebirth, the dharma rain abundantly revives the withered grace. So that the black books of condemnation are erased, names inscribed on azure slips. Diligently cultivate great stability, firmly protect the true body. The eight consciousnesses all diminish, the hundred hindrances and thousand demons are cloud-cleared; three lifetimes fully understood, nine clouds and seven ancestors ascend in rosy light. The numinous wind blows afar, myriad energies spread their ferry. Continuously greatly invigorating the ancestral wind, the lineage streams to the ancestral seat. Conduct and concealment guide auspiciousness, quelling worldly storms; hidden and manifest, rising and peaceful, the sun and moon within the peaceful pot. Again, I vow that masters, teachers, fellow students, kin and clan, all beings of the great earth, all faithful under Heaven, may each open their heart-mind clearly, each nature shine brightly as Heaven illuminates. With timely gentle winds and abundant harvests, the nation peaceful and the people secure. Arms and weapons laid to rest, water and fire in balance. The imperial plan solidified, the emperor’s enterprise far-flourishing. The holy emperor’s longevity, ministers virtuous and wise. All peoples united in sincerity, all nations rejoicing in the dao. Together with all beings, returning to purity and stillness. Humbly beseech! The holy compassion bends down to aid and save.

Recite the above repentance and vow text devoutly morning and evening. One must rely on one’s own dharma body, toward the Overlord Emperor of Heaven, with every thought cast in sincerity, with every heart filled with shame, every phrase clearly and brightly recited, every word repentant and resolute, courageously and diligently advancing. Life and death, survival and extinction, hardship, hunger, and cold—all must be let go together. Only by embracing precepts and concentration will there be a future.
