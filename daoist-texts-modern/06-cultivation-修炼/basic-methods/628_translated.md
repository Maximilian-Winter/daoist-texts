# Four: Removing Obstacles

For those who cultivate the dao, if obstacles remain uncut, then the path is blocked and one falls into dull confusion; if hindrances are not removed, then one remains foolish, stubborn, and benighted. The heart’s essence is originally the same as Heaven and Sun, yet false emotions are but drifting clouds. When fog obscures the blue sky, how can the bright sun shine clearly? When passions cloud the numinous orifices, how can the true mechanism attain perfect penetration? Is this not the great illness of every practitioner? Now I shall point out the root of this sickness. These obstacles in the dao tradition come in two forms: one called the obstacle of principle, the other the obstacle of affairs. Without understanding affairs, true and false cannot be distinguished; without understanding principle, right and wrong cannot be discerned. If one clings to principle but judges by affairs, stubborn and pedantic, that is the heart obstructed by principle; if one acts by affairs but harms principle, perverse and contrary, that is the affairs that betray one’s nature. Whether principle or affairs, any attachment is an obstacle.

Now I shall carefully explain these two words, “obstacle” and “hindrance.” The masses, through thousands of scriptures and myriad classics, are taught by those awakened and enlightened before, so that later generations may do good, learn well, realize the Dao, and cultivate the true. Yet living beings do not do good but do evil instead; do not learn virtue but learn vice; do not cultivate the true but play with the false; do not awaken to the Dao but ruin the teaching—this is called the affairs that obstruct the original heart. Then there are those who leave the world, who do good and cling to goodness, learn virtue and cling to virtue, cultivate the true earnestly, awaken to the Dao but become attached to forms and perish with traces—this is called the principle that obstructs the original heart. Yet these two obstacles of principle and affairs still belong to the higher order of practitioners. There is an even higher order of cultivators whose mind and ground are not yet clear, whose heavenly mechanism has not yet turned, who everywhere give rise to obstacles. When they see those above them lecturing on scriptures and expounding precepts, they outwardly praise but inwardly stir ignorance, giving rise to obstructing hearts and moving thoughts of ignorance.

O masses, if this obstructing heart is not removed, how can one emerge from the sea of suffering? Even with boat and raft, sail and oar, clearly able to cross the sea, yet one cannot cross, dares not cross—why is this? Know that this tiny obstructing heart is like a sudden black cloud rising in the sky, vast and spreading, threatening wind and rain, surely bringing great waves and fierce billows—thus one dares not cross, cannot cross.

O masses, the sea of suffering is boundless; turning back is the shore. The obstacles of the cultivator’s path are like black clouds rising, a turbulent veil that blinds Heaven’s face. When finally cut away, it is like the waves calming and the wind resting, peaceful and at ease—only then can one ferry across the sea of suffering. Have you not heard the *Supreme Jade Emperor’s Fundamental Practice Collection Scripture* say: “Only because living beings’ obstacles are heavy can they not behold the compassionate face of the Highest Emperor”? And again: “Such obstacles, each of you must sever and remove.” The *Imperial Scripture* begins by proclaiming the cutting of obstacles.

The method to cut obstacles is to generate great wisdom: arise no doubt, no greed or anger, no lust, no jealousy, no killing, no mundane heart, no worldly thought, no dull grime, no sounds or colors, no right or wrong, no hatred or love, no discrimination, no arrogance, no attachment. Concentrate the spirit and clear the mind; all spirits subdued and harmonized; the heart like the great void, pure inside and out. Nothing is excluded, nothing denied. Do not let external evils disrupt the supreme dao, lose the true lineage, ruin the numinous root, or steal the supreme treasure. Otherwise, you will fall into the mortal stream for myriad kalpas, ensnared in worldly nets, attacked by ten thousand demons, for hundreds of thousands of kalpas, never hearing the wondrous dharma, seized and punished by ghosts and spirits, cycling from birth to death. Therefore, you must with devoted heart guard the true lineage, never losing it. As said before, each must sever and remove these obstacles—these teachings are the very clauses of obstruction. If not cut away, then the six roots become stained, the three karmas entangled, and purity cannot be attained. Without purity, how can one behold the compassionate face of the Highest Emperor? The seventeen great lights, the thirty kinds of merit—whence do they come? It is because the Highest Emperor’s luminous merit, the Buddhas and holy teachers, the myriad heavenly sovereigns, the three volumes and five grades of wondrous scriptures—all arise from cutting away obstacles.

O masses, worldly obstacles are many. The *Imperial Scripture* only points to their manifestations and events, so you may know their broad outlines and understand the heavenly principle’s gateway. You must understand: the subtle worldly obstacles, myriad and countless, arise with every thought and movement of mind—hard to enumerate. Like reading scriptures and chanting classics, their profound and hidden meanings, your own brilliance limited, unable to comprehend and awaken—thus you know your orifices are not numinous, your wisdom light is small. Yet you refuse to humble yourself, to ask the wise—this is dull grime. When you do ask, doubts arise, fearing the teacher’s words are false; you ask another, their words differ, and your heart grows vexed. A thousand paths, myriad scriptures—is this not obstruction? If companions read scriptures together, one more familiar, the other less, the heart grows restless—is this not obstruction? If I am familiar and my companion is new, joy arises—is this not obstruction? If I am talented and others dull, I deceive and cheat—is this not obstruction? If I see others good and virtuous, giving alms and merits, they rich and I poor, jealousy arises; I rich and they poor, pride arises—is this not obstruction? If reading scriptures, suddenly enlightened, grasping a principle and clinging to it as truth, then teaching others, but they are more enlightened and my heart resists—is this not obstruction? If hearing wondrous principles, clinging only to one, not knowing change and flexibility—is this not obstruction? If cultivating meditation, occasionally tasting marvels, then boasting—is this not obstruction? If fellow practitioners gather, hearing the master say one is enlightened and another dark, not self-blaming but envying the other’s advance—is this not obstruction? Even hoarding wealth, unwilling to part with a single coin at death. All attachments, greed, indulgence, uncut and unremoved—whether fondness for zither or books, chess or painting, all such fixations are obstacles. Some rely on talismanic arts as wondrous powers; others see talismanic arts as inferior methods; some delight while others detest, some favor while others oppose—all are obstacles.

O masses, since you seek to transcend the world, to escape the wheel of rebirth, you must do the work of transcendence, cherish the dao of transcendence. These obstacles are all blockages of the numinous pass, the miasma that confuses awakening and delusion—how then can you transcend? If you are willing to cut away these tangled obstacles one by one, sever all kudzu roots, dispel all杂虑, your chest vast as the great void, then your heart-spirit will be lively, endlessly turning in perfect clarity; wisdom will arise naturally, your nature and Heaven will shine bright. Within this arise a thousand marvels, all the mechanisms of birth and death, the union of Heaven and Man. Naturally, not by mere recognition, but by true knowing!

Ha ha! Obstacles, obstacles! They lie only in whether the masses can cut them or cannot. Thus the master then spoke the dharma: “From the moment the heart descends, the bright destiny is no illusion. Illuminating the numinous platform, not even a hair’s tip can be hidden. Once the chest is cleared and vast, the eyes’ light instantly becomes pure and clear.”
