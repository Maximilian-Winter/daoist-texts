# Five: Renouncing and Severing Attachments of Affection

Beloved assembly, the harm caused by obstacles has already been made known. Yet the harm of attachments of affection is even more fierce than that of obstacles. How can this be seen? The heart of obstacles arises only when encountering circumstances; once the circumstance passes, it empties away, its harm coming and going in turn. But as for the two words “attachments of affection,” these are the karmic roots sown from before the beginningless kalpas up to this very life. Therefore, the sages, immortals, and Buddhas all urge sentient beings not to cling to appearances, not to bind themselves, not to crave or yearn. The scriptures of the three teachings all advise the world’s future generations: do not let attachments of affection entangle you. These attachments are the ancestors of all demons, the root of myriad harms. Through countless kalpas of delusion, through many births of downfall, all because of attachments of affection. The path of liberation remains undiscovered, the principle of true emptiness remains unknown, all because of attachments of affection. Life brings official punishments; death plunges into hell—all because of attachments of affection. Floods and fires, calamities and slaughter, knives and spears—all because of attachments of affection. The destruction of lineage and severing of descendants, breaking precepts and violating rules—all because of attachments of affection. The nine ancestral generations suffer calamities, incense offerings decline—all because of attachments of affection. Birth, aging, sickness, death; nature and mind grow perverse; the body grows weak; the dao and its methods become difficult to advance—all because of attachments of affection. The six roots become impure; the six thieves run rampant; the six senses discriminate; the six paths revolve—all because of attachments of affection. Within Heaven and Earth, among the Five Phases, the birth and decay of myriad things, the arising and ceasing of countless kinds—all because of attachments of affection. If one wishes to transcend the world, to escape birth and death, but does not seek to sever and cast off attachments, to renounce and abandon affection, and yet hopes to be clear and bright, pure and tranquil, liberated and free—such a one has never been found.

Now I shall first take the attachments of affection among the worldly lords and ministers, fathers and sons, husbands and wives, brothers and friends who remain in the home. The ancient sages have already spoken of the five existences, the five cessations, the five deviations, and the proper measure within all arising. The love of kin and respect for the worthy—these are all cut and shaped according to the subtle spiritual essence inherent within, to align the nature and life rightly, preserving a universe of perfect harmony. The primordial qi in its undifferentiated chaos needs no more attachments of affection to be severed. Purely by the path of naturalness, clarity, and liberation, we shall speak of this slowly again.

Now, speaking solely of those who have left home—such as the assembly of faithful listeners here today in the courtyard—it is also good to cleanse away extraneous attachments of affection. All that is lovable within one’s portion need not be loved; attachments that seem to have limits and ends must be examined one by one, regulated and passed beyond. Beloved assembly, attachments of affection are a bewildering snare, and you are utterly unaware. How so? The thoughts of people swiftly delight, and this is called attachments of affection. All manner of subtle and coarse things; all relatives and friends near and far; all matters inside and outside, right and wrong, good and evil; all teachings of sages and the three religions—Confucianism, Buddhism, and Daoism; all scriptures, writings, and literary works; all the marvels of Heaven and Earth, yin and yang, and creation’s wonders; all the numinous and mysterious arts; all the pure, subtle, spiritual treasures and the complete, true path. Even the famous mountains and grottoes, the celestial palaces and sacred realms; even the seven treasures and eight rarities, the River Chart and Tortoise Omen. And one’s own body and mind, the five organs and six entrails, teeth, tongue, and vital energy; the mountains, rivers, great Earth; grasses, trees, birds, beasts, and insects—if one’s thought covets them, one’s intention dwells upon them, one’s heart contemplates them, one’s spirit and qi focus upon them, one’s feelings cling to them, one’s nature delights in them, one’s mouth desires them, one’s body enjoys them, one’s dreams wander among them—all are bound by attachments of affection. If even one thought remains, one is ensnared and cannot attain the path of clear and tranquil liberation, ultimately becoming a person sunk in delusion and suffering.

Beloved assembly, when one is deluded and attached, attachments of affection arise; when one awakens and is clear, attachments of affection vanish. It is necessary to be constantly awakened, to bear this moment by moment. If the heart clings even a fraction to any beloved thing, it must be immediately renounced and severed, not allowed to arise again from causes and conditions. Those who love to sleep should sit; those who love to sit should walk; those who love to abandon find their spirit naturally lively; those who love having nothing find their numinous nature naturally empty. Not a thread clings, not a myriad conditions arise. The awakened heart shines with brightness, unmoved by circumstances, unshaken by things, undisturbed by affairs. Over time, wondrous states arise without cause; the primordial orifices open and communicate. But if today one does not remove them, and tomorrow does not cut them off; if one abandons but does not sever, still entangled as before—then the robe and bowl, the meditation mat, all become nets; the straw sandals and bamboo staff, all become ropes; the famous mountains and sacred realms, all become prisons; fellow disciples and Dao companions, all become enemies. Even the incantations and mantras must be transformed into poison and arsenic; the original Dao mind and nature end up turned into the karma of Asuras. Can one not be cautious? Can one not grieve? Can one not bear to renounce and sever them utterly?

Once there was a Daoist who sat long in meditation, and his spirit manifested. He saw a radiance shining above his head, five-colored and vivid, like rosy clouds and brocade. Within that light, the mountains, rivers, and great Earth, all things were fully visible. The Daoist’s heart rejoiced, thinking he had attained the great unobstructed light of the Supreme Emperor. Day and night he sat upright, meditating on the light, but the light never appeared again. The Daoist did not realize this was an illusory vision, not the truth. Using intention to observe, all thoughts were forgotten, only the light was thought of. Holding this thought for a long time, he became foolish and stupid, his body like earth and wood. People thought he had entered the supreme Dao. The Daoist sat for six years; his spirit congealed, his form changed, yet he did not perceive it. One day, his breath grew coarse and rapid; companions kept watch, hoping he would open his stillness to seek the Dao. Among them was one practitioner who knew he had been possessed by demons. At midnight, the meditator suddenly spread his hands as if flying. The crowd offered lamps, incense, and flowers in worship. The man then died, and from his mouth flew a moth, which fluttered toward the lamp’s firelight and perished. The practitioner took the moth and told the Daoists and the assembly: “This is the body of a Daoist who clung to imagined light. The light of attachments of affection is like the moth; when the attachment reaches its form, it transforms into a strange kind. If attachments of affection are not removed, all are like this. Can one not weep? Can one not sever them?” Beloved assembly, when the heart loves, that is attachment; attachment arises from love, love follows attachment, attachment and love entwine, never to be fully resolved. Fathers turn into sons, ancestors into grandchildren, men into women; faces change, forms alter; names shift, surnames exchange; ordinary folk become upside down and believe it real—how dreadful, how pitiable! Beloved assembly, know this well.
