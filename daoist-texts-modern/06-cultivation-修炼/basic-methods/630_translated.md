# Six: Rigorous Observance of the Precepts

For those who cultivate the Way, having already severed attachments and cast aside worldly ties, sincerely seeking to transcend the mundane and resolve the cycle of birth and death—if the bonds of love and desire remain unextinguished, if cravings are born anew, then the heart remains entangled, once more caught in nets and snares, and thus liberation is forever beyond reach. One must, before the first sign appears, prepare defenses and precautions. Otherwise, all past efforts are in vain, and future demonic obstacles cannot be escaped. Therefore, one should follow the example of the ancient sages, who held their hearts fast within the precepts.

This character *jie* (precept) is the pestle that subdues demons, capable of suppressing all manner of evil spirits; it is the talisman that guards life, able to extend blessings and longevity; it is the ladder to ascend Heaven, enabling one to pay homage to the Three Pure Ones and transcend the mundane to enter the sacred; it is the guiding lamp, dispelling the six desires, breaking through darkness and banishing confusion; it is the immortal’s precious boat and raft, ferrying beings across the sea of suffering; it is the compassionate bridge and ferry, saving all beings from the river of attachment. Truly, it is the safeguard of those who cultivate, the essential outline for advancing on the dao. Immortals and sages have no other gateway than through the precepts; the superior person’s path is always through precept observance. Indeed, it is the vital thoroughfare for the perfected immortals, the central and proper road for the wise and virtuous.

Great multitudes, having in previous lives planted causes and conditions, now in this life hear the teaching of the precepts—this is the greatest fortune. Yet if one does not act in accordance with the precepts, with rigor and diligence, then this great fortune turns into the greatest sin. These precepts are the primordial capital’s strict prohibitions, the rules ordained by the Most High Primordial Numinous Treasure, constantly inspected by the Heavenly Youth Bureau, guarded by divine soldiers, patrolled by celestial generals. Those who honor them have their elixir tablets refined; those who violate them have black books recording their offenses. Not a hair’s breadth is missed, not a needle’s point overlooked. Today’s disciples who receive the precepts are all ignorant folk. Why call them ignorant? Because they do not understand the principle. If one truly understands this principle, one would be rigorous and not violate it. To break the rules is truly ignorance.

Therefore, among the multitudes, those who have received the precepts must carefully contemplate this character *jie*. How does one make precepts? Precepts are prohibitions—what is prohibited? And why did you receive them in the first place? If you received them for the sake of the precepts, then you must observe them daily. If you do not observe them daily, why receive them at all? Such a thought is not for the precepts, but for the empty fame of a daoist receiving precepts, seeking only the title and the robe. Otherwise, why not keep the pure regulations? Remember, since the Seven Perfected revealed the Way’s teaching, the doctrine has waned. The dignity of the precepts and rites has not manifested in the world for four hundred years. The reason is that no one within the teaching has stepped forward to bear the responsibility. Thus, the heavenly lamp illuminating the Way has never been lit brightly, making it difficult for cultivators to proceed, casting aside their crutches, losing their grip. No wonder the heterodox sects flourish throughout the world, while the pure, liberated, upright, and radiant Way remains silent and unheard. Now, fortunately, the Way’s time has come, encountering a flourishing age. Above, the emperor’s blessing shelters all; the realm is peaceful; the court has many officials and faithful protectors of the teaching. There are also patrons who offer alms, robes, and crowns, ready-made and perfected. This is a once-in-a-thousand-lives opportunity, rarely met across ages—this is all the fruit of your past causes meeting now.

Having received the precepts, you should carefully seek to understand the character *jie*. What is called *jie*? Alas, among those who receive the precepts, the wise and the foolish are not equal. The foolish, when first receiving the precepts, have good intentions, but once received, they hide their original heart, failing to uphold the precepts. Is it not a pity to waste the original heart of receiving the precepts, to treat the precept robe and the precept kerchief as if cast into the Eastern Ocean? Sometimes sold, sometimes turned into ordinary clothes, sometimes patched into sleeves—desecrating the heavenly gods, ruining the daoist place. They even turn the pure alms bowl into an incense burner, storing money and rice. Breaking fast, violating precepts, drinking wine, eating meat—there is no limit. They extinguish their clear wisdom and sever the immortal root. This is no mere tale; it is a present case, clearly attested. Once there was a precept disciple who destroyed the precept conduct, soiled the precept scripture, sold the precept scripture, sold the precept robe, abandoned the alms bowl, and suddenly died. He saw many ghostly soldiers, who bound him with chains and ropes. Upon arriving in the underworld, he saw a government office, most imposing, with many ghostly soldiers lined up on both sides, locking many people—these were all former comrades who had broken their precepts in life and now returned to the netherworld. The precept disciple was startled and asked, “How did you all come here?” Those precept disciples said, “We do not know why, but one after another, we have all gathered here.” On the gate hung a plaque inscribed with three large characters: “Office of Examination and Verification.” He asked the ghostly soldiers, “What is this Office of Examination and Verification?” The soldiers said, “This is a newly established heavenly regulation. There are two judicial offices managing the affairs of monastic and daoist precepts. Whenever someone in the living world vows to receive the precepts, the local earth god registers their name in the ledger. On such and such a day they received the precepts, on such and such a day they practiced merit, on such and such a day they committed faults, on such and such a day someone violated the precepts, someone rebelled against the Way and the master, someone destroyed the precepts and ruined the teaching, someone sold their robe, someone defiled their alms bowl, someone slandered the dharma master, someone plotted against patrons, someone was greedy, someone lustful—all carefully recorded and reported monthly to the various offices of examination and verification. One must pass the examination of this office before being sent to other courts. You precept disciples, except those of lofty virtue and strict daoist heart, do not go to the underworld. But those like you who do not observe the precepts must first be examined and removed from the register here, then within the set time be seized and die. If you do not pass this office’s examination, the other courts will not sign off on you.” Listen well, all precept disciples! This one who died has already returned to life after one and a half days and told this story.

Multitudes, you are quick to see others’ faults, yet when it comes to your own, you do not examine them at all. Day by day, month by month, you forgive yourself for each one, accumulating boundless sins, and still try to hide them—this is called deceiving the heart. Those who have received the precepts must keep watch over their daily deeds and words, holding them in thought day and night. When good, act immediately; when evil, correct at once. Do not allow yourself to excuse or forgive yourself. If you err and have not examined or awakened to it, immediately turn your merit toward the holy perfected ones, mournfully repent, carefully study the precept scriptures, diligently seek wise teachers, and deepen your learning. Respect your teachers as parents, respect your daoist friends as elder brothers, delight in the dharma as a wife, cherish the scriptures as jade. Holding the precepts in the heart is like holding an object in the hand—once the object is dropped, it is lost; once the precepts are dropped, they are broken. Worldly kings have laws and punishments for violations; the heavenly dao has the Youth Bureau’s strict rules, and violations bring retribution. Do not say the underworld is dark and unseen—life and death are all in your heart. Do not say the precept spirits are hidden and obscure—comings and goings are all in your thoughts. The four words “rigorous precept observance” mean: subduing the heart and following the Way is called precept; enduring and practicing is called conduct; without the slightest impurity is called rigor; without the tiniest fault is called strictness; never changing from beginning to end is called holding the precepts; remaining steadfast in poverty is called guarding the precepts. Among you who have received the precepts, many do not even remember the ten rules of precepts—this is having a name without substance, why be so!

But there is one dharma phrase to assure the multitudes in their practice: The heavenly sovereign above originally cherishes life, vast in compassion, saving all beings. If a precept disciple commits offenses but then repents sincerely, discovers the truth of their error, returns to uphold the rules, becoming strict and precise, never daring to offend a second time, and thus mournfully and earnestly repents, the heart of Heaven will also pity and forgive, restoring them to their origin. I now relate a story of cause and effect about one who broke the precepts but then upheld them again, so that all may know. A precept disciple said: after receiving the precepts, suddenly encountering demonic trials, breaking fast and precepts, doing all manner of wrong. One night, he dreamed of the underworld, seeing the court of judgment. There were many ghostly judges, hanging gauze lanterns and arranging incense tables. Soon, the King Yama emerged from the great gate, majestic as a mortal emperor. The judges reported that heavenly envoys had arrived and to quickly set up incense tables to receive the edict, no different from receiving orders in the mortal realm. The envoy was an immortal official, wearing a golden lotus crown, cloaked in five-colored clouds and cranes, holding a yellow scroll, and entered. The ghosts were not allowed to enter. The dreaming daoist also wished to enter. The ghost soldiers shouted, “What wandering spirit are you, daring to enter this solemn hall?” One ghost said, “Looks like a daoist in disguise.” The other ghost said, “The edict from the other day says: all who cultivate and uphold the precepts, at death may enter wearing their robes and crowns. Those with brightness enter the main gate; those with less light enter the east gate; those without light have their precept names revoked and are shackled outside the west corner gate, awaiting judgment. You daoist have no brightness, a black cloud like me, pretending to be a daoist—leave quickly, leave quickly!” He brandished an iron rod. The precept disciple awoke, clearly remembering. He quickly rose, washed his face, took pure fire to burn incense, greatly fearful and sorrowful, repenting bitterly and reforming, rigorously observing the precepts. Another day he dreamed again, wandering the Yama court, the same place as before. He saw ghost soldiers with iron rods and chains running and asked, “May I ask, Immortal Elder, where are you going?” The disciple replied, “I wandered here and dare not disturb the king, I will return now.” The soldier said, “The king has rules: all immortal elders with bright precept conduct must first sit in the tea hall, give their name for registration, so that inspection may be made.” The disciple said, “I have no business, I will leave.” Turning, he suddenly left the scene and awoke to tell the multitudes. The first time he was beaten and scolded by ghosts; the second time he knelt and was asked his name—this is the progress of a single heart, with two ways of seeing and receiving. If not for sincere repentance, one remains in the old state. Seeing the gods as the Way, light and dark are one principle—how can one not fear?

Multitudes, time passes swiftly, and the nature of the heart must be bright. Do not wait until the impermanence arrives, walking in the dark underworld, where the ox-head has no mercy, and the horse-face shows no compassion. If you have faults, quickly reform—this depends entirely on rigorous precept observance. Among the myriad dharmas and countless gates, cultivating the heart is the highest vehicle. Like a boundless, shoreless sea, follow the precepts and the light of wisdom shines bright.
