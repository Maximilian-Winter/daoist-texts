# Seven: Enduring Humiliation to Subdue the Heart

The foremost great ailment of the cultivator, the hardest to remove and mend, is the single word *resentment*. If not caught by the self-image, then caught by the image of others—once the resentful heart stirs, it is called the fire of ignorance and karma. Among the three poisons, resentment’s poison stands foremost. If the resentful heart is not resolved, it burns inwardly; if the resentful mouth speaks, it burns outwardly. A single spark at the numinous gate fiercely scorches and melts; a whole dharma body is consumed alive by the blaze. The six viscera cannot be purified; the five organs cannot find harmony. When the ear hears someone curse me, the fire of resentment rises from the liver, a fierce flame fanned by wild winds, suddenly sealing the ear root that once could perceive. When the eyes behold insult, the fire of resentment springs from the kidneys, a raging blaze whipped by storm winds, suddenly blocking the eye root that once could see. The mouth unwittingly utters resentful words, the heart bursts forth with the fire of anger, the gallbladder surges with poisonous schemes. Above, there is no fear of Heaven, Earth, or divine beings; in the middle, no fear of life or death; below, no fear of boiling oil or sword trees; before officials, no fear of execution or military punishment—yet a single tongue capable of speech creates a thousand karmic offenses. Why do these ears, these eyes, this mouth, this tongue suffer such torment? Only because this lump of flesh called the heart cannot be subdued, relying on some measure of qi and blood to wield fortune and power. But when the time comes to calm the heart, it becomes as cold and tranquil as ice.

All you masses, all beings of the world, this body is formed of blood and qi congealed. This root of resentment, since before beginningless kalpas, this fire of ignorance and karma has long been planted. Thus, when things go smoothly, the heart rejoices; when contrary, joy turns to enmity. When circumstances oppose the heart, resentment and anger arise—this is the root of the endless wheel of kalpas. Since you have already left the household life, originally to transcend birth and death, if the root of resentment does not cease, then a poisonous dragon invades the root of Heaven. Seeking to escape the net of the body, the reason is the deep weight of life and destiny; if this hatred does not extinguish, it fills the lunar cavity with qi. Nature is fundamentally good, yet resentment transforms it into a poisonous dragon; accustomed to the fire of resentment, the fire bursts forth to burn the body. Life itself remains constant, yet resentment becomes a fierce tiger, constantly breeding toxic qi; when the qi is urgent, the true is lost. Birth and death remain unclear because one cannot cherish life. Life and destiny fail to establish because the fire is too strong. Thus the six roots cannot be gathered, the four limbs tremble in vain display, the five orifices cannot function, the fiery nature of the hair pores flies upward, causing a hundred harms, injuring Heaven and hastening fate.

All you masses, to sever resentment, first subdue evil thoughts. What are evil thoughts? Those who cannot endure humiliation—these are evil thoughts. The Great Sage Confucius said: “Teach with gentleness and forbearance; do not repay the unrighteous.” If the heart cannot endure, day by day, one remains an evil person. How can an evil person enter the dao? All you masses, those who cannot endure humiliation, their hearts cannot be subdued; they are like poisonous dragons and fierce tigers, only knowing how to insult others, yet cannot tolerate insult themselves. Proud and competitive, they steal the spotlight before others, making qi their power, speaking with stern voices and harsh looks; selling themselves as heroes, posing as champions; seizing profit and contending for fame, boasting of achievements and wielding power, serving the strong and oppressing the weak. Though sometimes their warm hearts serve the many, not knowing whether they can save others, they certainly can kill others. Beings are lost and unawakened, never deeply pondering or considering; the way of Heaven is subtle and distant, grudges unresolved, all because the root of resentment never ceases. Resentment inevitably desires to humiliate others, unwilling to accept being humiliated oneself. They do not know that receiving humiliation and humiliating others are worlds apart.

All you masses, this word *humiliation* encompasses vast meaning. Suppose a man debauches another’s wife or concubine, disregarding her husband’s humiliation, the children’s humiliation, the ancestors’ humiliation, the clan’s humiliation. But when another debauches his own wife or concubine, resentment and anger arise, great evil stirs: recalling how this man defiled my wife or concubine, what remains of my dignity? If others hear, not only am I shamed, but the merits of my parents and ancestors, the family traditions of children and descendants, are all sullied and ruined. How can I let him pass? Then one seizes knife and cudgel, kindles fire and fury, instantly rising with murderous intent—no longer thinking of his insult, but rather, “If I am not insulted, how could he be?” When one’s wife or daughter is defiled in this life, it is surely due to evil causes from past lives. Past-life sins of debauching wives and daughters bring about present-life defilement of wives and daughters. This is the inevitable cause and effect among humans. You all, hearing these words, must never harbor lustful thoughts. I speak plainly to you: these beings’ lives all arise from lust. If lust is not removed, the root of birth and death remains unbroken. Because of lust arises the colored body; to escape the colored body, wash away lustful thoughts. When lustful thoughts are removed, then within the decaying colored body, the dharma body can arise, and only then can one transcend birth and death. This is our true word—do not treat it as idle talk and let it pass.

Recently, a disciple, usually filled with great dao thoughts, one day went out to collect vegetarian food, begging at a rice shop. The shop owner, fond of the dao, joyfully invited the disciple into the main hall to sit, kowtowed and offered food, then placed a coin of broken roots into the begging bowl. As the disciple was leaving the hall, he suddenly encountered his wife passing through the corridor. At their glance, she turned away hastily; the disciple thanked for the food and departed. After seeing his wife, at night during meditation, his mind raced, recalling her face, tracing her features, and then suddenly rose, kneeling to incense and repent before lying down. Suddenly he knew he was dead, embraced in the womb, growing up to marry, his complexion fair and harmonious with his wife. Walking outside by the roadside, he saw a Daoist begging for food, and his heart rejoiced. Returning home, he offered food and blessings, called his wife out, and kowtowed. Turning, he beckoned the Daoist with his hand, but his heart suddenly flared with great anger. He ran straight into the kitchen, seized a vegetable knife, and rushed to strike the Daoist. Losing his footing, he stumbled and awoke, sweat pouring from his body. Reflecting on the Daoist, his face was that of the rice shop owner who offered food; his wife was the woman he met in the corridor. All you masses, this disciple, just beginning his practice, though his precepts were firm, his concentration was not yet solid, so day and night his thoughts wandered, suddenly giving rise to false visions and deep delusions, entering dreams that became reality.

Another cultivator, firm in precepts, never uttered false words, never let thoughts wander falsely, when insulted bore no resentment, did not strike back when hit, did not answer when cursed, only thought himself at fault, never blaming others. One day, carrying a load along the road, he met a donkey rushing forward. He yielded his body to the donkey, but the donkey suddenly butted him with its head; he could not avoid it and fell to the ground. The donkey bit his clothes, tearing them, and ran off. That night, during meditation, in a hazy trance, a white-robed person appeared, thanking him: “I am the donkey that charged you on the road. In a past kalpa, we had enmity and retribution, but now the grudge is released, both freed. From now on, you shall escape suffering and rebirth among humans. I come to inform you: on the fifteenth day of the month, seek me at such and such place to attain transcendence.” Having spoken, he left. The cultivator clearly saw, heard, and understood, as if dream yet not dream, then arose and continued meditation as usual. On the appointed day the next month, he sought the place; the household was full of joy, as if a great event had occurred. Asking neighbors, all said a child was born that night. The cultivator was greatly shocked, secretly memorized the name, vowed to save himself first, then save others. All you masses, such people have past roots of enmity to settle in this life.

Disciples, you must awaken your own heart: endure humiliation, release resentment, bear suffering and hardship, forget shame and accept loss, resolve grudges and submit to calamities, subdue this heart, and accept all. Hold firmly the precept blade, constantly slay the fire of ignorance, moment by moment wear the robe of endurance. Hear others strike and curse, gladly endure insult and injury, allow slander and shame, follow humiliation—none can break your precept heart. Even when falsely implicated, facing royal laws and punishments, thunder and lightning, fire and storm, floods and bandits, wolves and tigers, poisons and snakes, demons and ghosts, evil spirits and malevolent beings, worldly desires with twisted words, ruined reputations, enemies’ curses and abuse, harm to kin—sometimes no escape, limbs cut, no dodging, body broken—these all stem from past causes and fixed kalpas, difficult to evade fate’s decree. Only calmly accept, harmonize with Heaven’s heart, repay old debts, answer past causes. Do not stir rebellious thoughts to harm your precepts. Rather, reflect: those who harm me, I once harmed; those who trap me, I once trapped; all demons, calamities, harm, and disaster stem from past deeds, self-made and self-borne. From now on, after taking precepts, all evil karma will dissipate with the heart. Naturally, the six desires will not arise, the three poisons will vanish, body and mind will be light and healthy, temperament and nature peaceful and harmonious, suffering and vexation healed, grudges and hatreds resolved. All you masses, from before beginningless time’s accumulation of resentment until today, now is the moment to awaken conscience. Wherever there are grudges and debts, be willing to accept and repay each one, harming oneself to benefit others—this is true liberation. From here on, forever return to purity, abiding in the steadfastness of the great void, the root of confusion, preserving spirit and guarding silence, brewing the perfect retribution body. Otherwise, debts from past kalpas unpaid, and present-life humiliations unyielded, naturally the retribution of future lives will not spare you. How then can this body transcend? How can this heart be emptied? How can this dao be cultivated? Now, if you cannot endure words and speech, how can you reach the end of birth and death, and become utterly pure?

All you masses, endurance quenches the fire of ignorance; naturally the five organs cool and refresh. Endurance causes the waters of the Flower Pool to arise; naturally the six viscera harmonize and regulate. Endurance fills others’ hearts and desires; naturally resentment dissolves and peace prevails. Endurance broadens my capacity for tolerance; naturally the chest and mind expand. Whenever insulted, I do not feel insulted; the insult returns to the other. When I insult others, they receive my insult, and surely repay insult to me. Those who can endure have peaceful heart qi, so liver fire does not blaze, transforming into the Southern Dipper to dispel disaster. Those who can endure have moist lungs, which moisten the stomach, transforming into the sweet dew of the Jade Pool. Those who can endure preserve kidney essence, which uplifts and relieves calamity, transforming into the Martial Spirit Spring. Those who can endure keep the spleen earth from drying, making the body light and healthy, transforming into white snow and yellow sprouts. Those who can endure have an unblemished dharma body, attaining dao qi to communicate with spirit, transforming into a solemn and wondrous form. Those who can endure in the country will surely benefit the court; those who endure in the family will surely benefit kin; those who endure in the body will surely benefit spirit; those who endure in the heart will surely benefit life; those who endure in the teaching will surely benefit the dharma retinue. Such are the benefits of endurance.

If one cannot endure humiliation and bear burdens, then the heart is not empty, the spirit not numinous, the qi not strong, the capacity not vast, the chest not open, the wishes not great, the merit not complete, the practice not full, the vision not clear, the thought not deep, the wisdom small, the virtue shallow, the root foundation thin; hearing the dao unclearly, practicing the dao with obstacles, hated by others, envied by others, despised by others, causing annoyance, treated with disdain, haunted by many ghosts, startled in dreams, clearly afflicted by spirits, suffering from scabies, leprosy, and rashes—these are the unresolved grudges of many kalpas, the ever-deepening retribution of future lives; the sea of suffering never ceases to rise waves—what can one rely on to calm the storm?

All you masses, have you not heard: virtue is fundamental; great virtue comes from tolerance. The Sovereign Heaven shows no partiality; only virtue supports. Among you, wise and foolish differ. Some lose virtue through greed for wealth, some through lust for beauty, some through pride in qi. Though the external causes differ, humiliation is the same. The sage said: “A moment’s anger forgets oneself and one’s kin.” He also said: “Anger is hard to think through.” Zengzi said: “If the heart harbors anger and perversity, it cannot find rightness.” Is not this precept of enduring humiliation weighty? Is not the harm of resentment and anger poisonous? Therefore, the primordial ancestors of the true ones take the precept against resentment as the gateway, forgetting resentment as the path; taking endurance of humiliation as killing the heart, forgetting humiliation as fulfilling wishes. The Scripture of Salvation, the Heavenly Venerable of Great Unity said: “Fire’s haze becomes clear heat, sword trees bloom fragrant groves. To transcend the Three Realms’ suffering is difficult, yet one ascends to the Primordial Heaven.”

All you masses, awaken swiftly and sharply, hear my verse:

“Early remove the self-other image,  
Urgently awaken to birth and death’s cause.  
Endure humiliation, quell the fire of resentment,  
In emptiness reveal the dharma body.  
Seven emotions vanish with thought,  
Hundredfold endurance praised by ancients.  
Sweetly accept karmic offenses,  
Only then one is beyond kalpas.  
Countless karmic obstacles are past ties,  
Debts owed and repaid all the same.  
Foolish and dark suffer losses, resentment flares,  
A tangled mass of grudges black and vast.  
Cultivation must shun taking advantage,  
If I take advantage, others will not comply.  
Through kalpas drifting, grudges unresolved,  
In pure halls many disputes arise.  
Right and wrong have no place, Heaven is vast,  
Immortals and asuras differ in kind.  
Cool blessed lands arise from much endurance,  
Repaying humiliation perfects the dao’s merit.  
This mortal body comes to the dao,  
Why then refuse to bear losses?  
Raging anger scorches skin and hair,  
No true person stands amid starving ghosts.”
