# Eight: Purifying Body and Mind

Beloved assembly, once you have accepted the precepts and taken refuge, you must single-heartedly seek liberation from the world, transcending birth and death. Yet those lofty ones who transcend birth and death and depart the world possess the supreme path of no death and no birth—the highest vehicle. This path is none other than the turning of worldly methods; fundamentally, there is no fixed method at all. Worldly methods and transcendental methods differ only in the mind’s use, employing contrary or harmonious means; in truth, they are but one method. The method is not merely to be used in harmony or opposition. When harmony employs opposition, myriad methods all return to the effortless Way; spirits and demons cannot fathom its workings. When opposition follows harmony, one method scatters into myriad methods; yin and yang cannot escape its calculation. It is not by deliberate intention that this operates, nor by mental speculation. Rather, it is the luminous wisdom of spirit and clarity, the principle and nature as they are from the start—there is originally no other transcendental method besides this. Nevertheless, who truly transcends the world? Ultimately, one must escort this person beyond the world, beyond the world’s bounds—that is transcendence. Yet even this is not so.

Now I speak to urge you to bring this body beyond the world. Heaven and Earth are vast, the world immense—where could one find beyond the world? Listen closely, all of you: beyond the world means beyond worldly methods. To see through worldly methods as unreal, illusory feelings as false, all conditioned functions as but a dream; things have no substance, events are not real—only by purifying this mind can one depart beyond the world. How can we know this mind can transcend the world? Now, the heavens have their cycles of yin and yang, unable to transcend; the earth cracks and crumbles, unable to transcend; sun and moon wax and wane, unable to transcend; stars fall from distant constellations, unable to transcend; wind, clouds, thunder, rain, frost, snow, mist, and dew all have their limits, unable to transcend; mountains collapse, stones are carved away; waters dry up, springs cease; grasses wither, trees rot; gold is forged, jade is shattered—all unable to transcend; humans have birth and death, unable to transcend; things grow strong and old, unable to transcend; feelings wax and wane, unable to transcend; breath flows in and out, unable to transcend; the mind stirs and rests, unable to transcend; essence leaks away, unable to transcend; spirit dims and scatters, unable to transcend; power rises and falls, unable to transcend; profit rides and falls, unable to transcend. All conditioned things are bound by arising, abiding, emptying, and dissolving—birth, aging, sickness, death—how could one draw beyond the world? Beloved assembly, you must awaken within worldly methods to the transcendental method. This transcendental method is not found in many words; it lies only in the mind’s return. Once you know that Heaven, Earth, myriad things, human feelings, and worldly affairs are not transcendental methods, you will know that all these are but traps within the world’s circle. If you can awaken to this point in your heart, breaking through the impermanence of all things, seeing worldly methods and human feelings as illusions—what then is the true numinous? This true numinous is formless and without shape, without scent or sound; it is said to be within, yet not confined within; said to be without, yet not truly outside. Everyone possesses it; all things correspond to it. It is the sovereign method that can transcend the world.

Beloved assembly, this sovereign method of true numinousness pervades the universe from ancient times to now; nothing exists without it, no time passes without it. It is no trivial matter. In Buddhism, it is called the wondrous bright true mind; in Confucianism, the bright virtue and utmost goodness; in Daoism, the perfectly bright Dao mother, also called the ancestral qi. Countless other names exist, impossible to exhaust. Those who understand Heaven, Earth, myriad things, human feelings, and worldly methods—where do they seek it? It is found in the *Great Learning*: “Illuminate your bright virtue, and stop at utmost goodness.” This bright virtue and utmost goodness dwell within arising, abiding, emptying, and dissolving; birth, aging, sickness, death; the true numinous without sickness or death. From time immemorial to the present, it remains ever clear and unclouded. It penetrates Heaven and Earth, enters the hidden and the dark. Neither born nor changed, neither more nor less; without deficiency or surplus, without coming or going. It can move yin and yang without being obstructed by yin and yang; can command spirits and demons without being constrained by them; can employ myriad things without being discriminated by them; can transform human feelings without being swayed by them; can respond to worldly methods without being drowned by them; can transcend beyond the world and abide within the world. Roaming freely through the Three Realms, coming and going without restraint; commanding myriad spirits, transforming mysteriously and unfathomably. Above Heaven and below Earth, it alone is honored, unmatched by any. This true numinous, everyone has it, yet few understand it. All methods and myriad gates, the Three Vehicles and the One Treasury, all arise from it. Every subtlety and every mystery, awakening to it is before your eyes; losing it is sinking to the ocean’s depths.

Beloved assembly, to know transcendence and cultivation, do not go beyond the two words: body and mind. The body is false, the mind true; the mind is false, the nature true. You must realize to use the false to cultivate the true. The outer is false, the inner true; outer form is empty, inner emptiness. Without relying on the outer conditioned form-body, it is difficult to cultivate the inner unconditioned dharma-body. Without the outer body subject to birth, aging, sickness, and death, it is hard to understand the inner serene and perfect mind. Without the lively and nimble mind, it is hard to transcend and realize the vast and boundless nature. Yet this nature comes from Heaven’s mandate, from the very beginning of life, unstained, sharing substance and measure with the Great Void. Hollow and empty, possessing nothing; whole and complete, containing all.

Beloved assembly, now if you seek transcendence, first you must all purify body and mind. What is the practice of purifying body and mind? The body is formed from blood and qi; blood and qi are not indestructible things—they are the root of birth and death, the source of calamity and trouble. They entangle my mind and harm my nature. Lust for beauty and greed for pleasure arise only for this body’s enjoyment. Striving for fame and profit is only for this body’s benefit. Breaking laws invites punishment; causing disasters brings illness—all arise from this body. The Most High says: “If one has troubles, it is because one has a body; if one has no body, what troubles remain?” The ancients said: “If a person is not burdened by form, before their eyes is the Great Luo Immortal.” Clearly, this body is no small calamity. Now you must see through the skin and flesh as false things, formed from earth, water, and wind. If you do not speak of thorough cultivation, but only urge filial piety, you say the body’s skin, hair, and flesh are received from parents and must not be harmed. Father’s essence and mother’s blood combine in the numbers two and five, holding Heaven and Earth’s refined qi, endowed with yin and yang’s numinous power. The head is round to model Heaven, the feet square to model Earth, positioned between Heaven and Earth, among the Three Powers; among myriad things, humans are foremost. Above, they can match Heaven and Earth; below, praise spirits and demons. Learning can aspire to sages and worthies; cultivation can achieve immortals and Buddhas. How could one regard this precious and wealthy body as foul, rank earth? I only urge the disciples not to fall and be lost, not to be confused by worldly waves. Do not seek comfort for the form; seek only the true nature’s return to true constancy. Will and qi desire to govern yin and yang; form and spirit desire to adorn the dharma realm. If the dharma body has leaks, then form and spirit cannot be both wondrous and true, nor united with the Dao.

Beloved assembly, now I explain to you the practice of purification. If you want this body purified, first cast away worldly things, sever dusty feelings, be utterly unlike worldly methods. Sweetness and richness are abandoned for lightness and leisure; forsake rich flavors and noisy clamor. Take refuge in the Three Treasures, steadfastly guard the One Truth. Nurture peaceful nature and temperament; hands and feet upright, dignified and proper; eyes and ears not biased or perverse; thoughts not scattered or confused; the heart not clinging to thoughts or attachments; the mouth not shouting or raising voice. Gather the spirit light of the two eyes, illuminating the inner bright spirit platform; return the essence apertures of the two ears, always listening to Heaven’s melodies. Speak little and open silence, returning to natural stillness. Expect no regrets or stinginess; thoughts do not wander; spirit is free from vexation; Heaven’s mechanisms clear and smooth; profound principles fully realized. The mouth cuts off meat and fish, secretly consuming the many karmic calamities of killing. The body follows precepts, diligently practicing the majestic rites of the Four Great Elements. Feet do not stray, so the heart is not flurried; hands do not move recklessly, so the heart is not agitated. When sitting, maintain uprightness, forbidding leaning or crookedness; when lying down, be alert and watchful, guarding against excessive sleepiness; when eating, take bland foods, reduce flavors, so the five organs are clear and peaceful; when speaking, be cautious and calm, voice harmonious and smooth. This is called the coarse practice of bodily purity. As for the subtle practice, you must investigate the two words “purity” and “stillness.” I fear you cannot enter the heart and penetrate deeply; I do not fear that you will practice earnestly but fail to attain the Way.

Beloved assembly, a mind without two thoughts is called pure; thoughts without confusion are called still. The heart not attached to forms is called pure; thoughts not stagnant are called still. Each thought perfectly clear is called pure; bright and unobstructed is called still. Not stained by a speck of dust is called pure; all worries emptied is called still. All things cannot escape their shape is called pure; spirits and demons cannot fathom their workings is called still. The heart like flowing water is called pure; nature like the bright moon is called still. Sins erased since beginningless time is called pure; causes exhausted from many kalpas ago is called still. Looking inward at the heart and finding no heart is called pure; looking outward at things and finding no things is called still. When both are realized, it is called pure; only seen in emptiness is called still. Observing emptiness as emptiness is called pure; emptiness without anything to be empty is called still. What is emptied is nothing; nothing itself is also nothing, called pure; serene and ever tranquil, tranquility without anything to be tranquil about is called still. True constancy responding to things is called pure; constant response and constant stillness is called still. Clear and unclouded is called pure; entering the myriad wondrous gates is called still. Transcending the Three Realms is called pure; liberation from the Five Phases is called still. Void shattered is called pure; shattering the void is called still. Light encompassing all heavens is called pure; universally ferrying all beings is called still.

Beloved assembly, I have briefly spoken to open your understanding. The sages of the Three Teachings, the great treasury of scriptures; myriad methods and thousand gates, the wondrous appearances of the heavens; thirty-six thousand paths, eighty-four thousand dharma gates; sands of the Ganges in number, bodhisattvas countless; golden immortals innumerable—all cannot transcend the wondrous method of purity, stillness, concentration, wisdom, and non-action. Beloved assembly, the supreme, unsurpassed, great vehicle, highest grade, truest wondrous Way, giving birth to Heaven, Earth, humans, and all beings, all arise from purity and stillness. The Most High says: “If a person can always be pure and still, all Heaven and Earth will return.” Again he says: “When pure and still, the world is correct.” Thus you see, purifying body and mind swiftly leads to awakening. Beloved assembly, from this day forth, you must cast away all your daily delusions—the lead and mercury, dragons and tigers, yin and yang, all the various metaphors of refining and forging. Only follow the gate of purity and stillness, extinguish false thoughts, cease evil intentions, steadily and calmly walk the great middle road. Do not fear being called slow; better slow than wrong. If there is a path, do not board the boat. If I speak deceitfully or deceive, may I fall into hell.

At this moment, the Dharma Master recited a verse:

> “Thoughts mixed, the mind is not still;  
> Dust many, the body not pure.  
> Not pure, hard to see nature;  
> Not still, how can there be feeling?  
> Inward illumination, body is illusion;  
> Turning light, mind is also empty.  
> In emptiness, spirit sees itself;  
> Concentration and wisdom are true lineage.  
> Observe sun and moon;  
> In daily life, embody and practice.  
> Move against the grain, holding the Dipper’s handle;  
> Purity and stillness unite with Heaven’s heart.”
