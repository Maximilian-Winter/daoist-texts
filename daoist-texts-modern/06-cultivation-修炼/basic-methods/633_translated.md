# Nine: Seeking Teachers and Inquiring the Dao

Since ancient times, sages, immortals, and buddhas who have realized fruition and attained true realization have never crossed the path without a teacher. Thus, teachers instruct teachers, mouths pass down to mouths, hearts imprint upon hearts. Within this, the dao’s principle runs straight and through. Like milk transforming, like glue and lacquer joining, those of the same breath seek each other, those of the same voice respond; water and sky blend in one hue, lamp flames mingle in radiance—only then can the path of teacher and disciple be fully fulfilled.

My fellow seekers, I see that among the world’s people, many seek teachers and inquire of the dao, yet often they err. They bear the name of discipleship, but lack the reality of following the dao. Therefore, today, I spare no teeth nor shun reproach, to lay bare the principle of seeking teachers and inquiring the dao for you all. You must keep this in your heart: when the day comes, first be a disciple to others, able to observe this propriety; then when you become a teacher, your disciples will imitate the ancients and follow the path, honoring the teacher because they honor the dao.

My fellow seekers, among the fools and blind in the world, they fail to recognize their own heart, turning with external things. Though they have thoughts of the dao, they do not know the gate of right and wrong; though they have a dao heart, they do not know the method of cultivation. They hear people say, “Nature is understood by oneself; destiny depends on the teacher’s transmission,” and so they follow these two phrases. Or they encounter some wandering daoist, clad in tattered robes, feet shod with straw sandals, hand waving a palm-leaf fan, shouldering a meditation mat, passing through the city streets. Or sitting by the roadside, holding a gourd bowl for alms; or strolling leisurely on the path, carefree and unbound. Encountering a palace or temple, they settle in; meeting a shrine, they lodge for the night. Their mouths chant formulas; their tongues drum with flutes and reed pipes. How could they grasp the mysterious gateway, the tailbone’s sea bottom, ascending to the mud pellet palace, descending to the bubbling spring cave? Guarding the center, raising the qi, setting the cauldron, fixing the furnace. Extending life and dispelling illness, massaging and guiding energy. Six-syllable formula, Eight-Section Brocade, Awakening to the Truth, the Seal of Unity. Along with alchemical scriptures, arm metaphors, lead and mercury dragons and tigers, silver sand couples, sun and moon hexagrams, turtle and serpent nurturing warmth, bathing and forming the embryo, entering the chamber to sit in circle, releasing the yin spirit, releasing the yang spirit. Endless are the three thousand six hundred side doors, eighty-four thousand magical arts. How could one count them all?

My fellow seekers, these fools and blind, their hearts lack wisdom; how could they discern true from false, recognize right from wrong? They simply listen to this daoist. Worse still are the hateful sort—those who speak of cauldrons and vessels, charlatans refining grass and silver, beguiling people with beauty and wealth. Let alone having a genuine path or method, even if such a method were true, could ordinary men turn lead to gold, or licentious men prolong their lives? Thus, those who speak of cauldrons, upon seeing beauty, stir desire; facing circumstances, their thoughts move; souls scatter, spirits wander; true mercury flows downward; primordial nature collapses; the precious treasure vanishes; many fall ill with consumption, never continuing their fate, severing even the thread of life. Is this not hateful and grievous? As for the grass-and-silver charlatans, speaking of sand and ore, turning this way and that, nurturing and opening points, endless are their deceptions and tricks to cheat and escape. The foolish and greedy often ruin their families; compared to those daoists above, their sins multiply manyfold. I do not bear to speak in detail, lest I invite slander. But those who have taken the precepts must listen as I outline the essentials of seeking teachers and inquiring the dao.

My fellow seekers, this august Dao of the Sovereign Heaven is hazy and elusive, dark and obscure; vast beyond measure, great and supreme; profound and hidden, quiet and faint. Its greatness has no outside, its smallness no inside. It can traverse Heaven and weave Earth; it can enter the hidden and the dark; seeming to exist and not exist; entering water yet not wet, entering fire yet not burned; before there was ancient, after there is no now; giving birth to Heaven and Earth; moving the sun and moon; nurturing all things; giving birth to sages and worthies, immortals and buddhas. Stirring and containing spirit, insects and plants, no one is without it, nowhere does it not abide. Used daily and ordinarily, all is the wondrous dao. Only because common folk use it daily yet do not know, the lowly heart is confused and does not awaken; thus one true is lost, and for ten thousand kalpas it is hard to illuminate. Before parents are born, the true spirit does not know its beginning; after the spirit has departed, this body does not know its end. Reversed and spinning in the wheel of rebirth, suffering birth and death’s torment.

Therefore, I point out the source and root, teaching people to urgently seek true teachers, to early hear the august dao.

Yet true teachers are hard to find, high disciples hard to meet. Know this: if a disciple lacks a transcendent true heart, blocking and closing their wisdom nature, even if they meet a true teacher, spirits will not allow them to see, will veil their wisdom nature, so that seeing they cannot recognize the true. If a teacher lacks the heart to save the world, even if they meet a high disciple, spirits will not know to reveal them, will veil their dharma eye; seeing no affinity, the teachings given face to face are often missed. My fellow seekers, teachers seeking disciples is like rolling a mustard seed and throwing a needle into it; disciples seeking teachers is like catching the moon in water. True teachers are rare, high disciples hard to find—not among treasures or wealth, but within the single sincere thought of the heart. Have you seen any dao master who would recklessly pass on to unworthy people? Have you seen any high person seeking the dao who would rashly bow to a teacher? My fellow seekers, since teachers do not randomly transmit, such teachers hold the august dao in their embrace, seeking high disciples. Since disciples do not rashly bow to teachers, such persons are discerning and wise, watchful and attentive. Suppose these sorts do not lightly cast themselves to teachers nor rashly bow to daoists, their hearts are free of obstruction, their aspirations beyond dust and entanglement, their vision wide, their chest broad; when they meet a true teacher, naturally the eye distinguishes clearly; words can be spoken, understanding penetrates; a mustard seed thrown at a needle, the needle’s eye receives it. Suppose these sorts do not rashly take disciples nor recklessly transmit to unworthy ones; meeting such discerning disciples, would they not gladly question and answer, speak at length, reveal wondrous formulas and true expositions, secret celestial mysteries, profound and subtle truths, heart-transmitted august dao, mouth-bestowed heavenly scriptures?

My fellow seekers, true teachers are not few, disciples are many. Now I tell you, how is it that true teachers are not few? My fellow seekers, all your six roots receive teachers: if your ears hear good words, and you sincerely accept these good teachings, then your ear root becomes the teacher who leads you in, and these good words become the teacher who transmits the dao; the other five roots are likewise so. My fellow seekers, learning has no fixed teacher; only the dao is teacher. Whenever your ears hear good words and kind speech, you must keep your spirit silently listening, like sweet dew dripping into the heart, like clarified butter poured upon the crown; keep your heart silently moved by these persons, opening your foolish confusion, with compassionate skillful means, wishing that those who proclaim good words early realize profound achievement and attain the supreme dao—are these not teachers and disciples? Suppose your eyes see all the scriptures, the three teachings’ writings, true words and secret formulas, and your heart opens to awakening, then you should bow and praise; such writings are what you recognize as true, trust to the utmost; naturally teacher and disciple meet. Yet the compassionate ferry and dharma bridge of the teacher’s family is not a single method. Mencius said: “Teaching has many methods: some perfect virtue, some develop talent, some answer questions, some instruct privately—these are all teaching.” Therefore, some meet and rejoice like old friends; some bow and submit like new converts, neither slighting the other; some kowtow and bend knees to transmit; some offer fasting gold and swear oaths before transmission. Respectful ones have not yet reached full propriety; respect without substance is not respect. It depends on observing the disciple’s sincerity and earnest practice, honoring teacher and valuing the dao. Thus some are tested repeatedly before transmission, like the ten trials of Dongbin in Yunfang; some bow low before meeting, like Liu Xuande’s three visits to the thatched cottage; some follow the teacher for many years without their heart wavering; some knowing sincerity are nevertheless tested with many hardships. This transmission of dao and receiving of teaching—is it a small matter? Is it easily obtained? Hence there are the three mouths that do not speak, six ears that do not transmit the dao. For the highest dao methods cannot be transmitted to middling or low persons; middling and low methods cannot be transmitted to the highest wise. Only teaching according to person. Like Confucius’ disciple Ran You asking, “When hearing, do you practice it?” The Master said, “When hearing, practice it.” Zi Lu asked, “If father and elder brothers are present, how then practice what you hear?” Seeking is retreating, thus advancing; yielding is also person, thus retreating—this is why they cannot listen to each other. Thus Gongxi Hua and two others heard it and were puzzled. As for the Master and the many asking about benevolence, the Master’s answers differ—this is so. Some have one faith, some hear by chance; the one with faith can be spoken to, the chance hearer cannot. Hence it is said, “Do not treat what is easily obtained as trivial.”

My fellow seekers, some transmit the dao among thousands and hundreds, yet among them the wise grasp it easily, the tasteless find it hard to practice. Loudly chanting, revealing the mysterious secret, those with heart receive the record; those with heart but no affinity, the wind blows past the ear, heard as trivial. My fellow seekers, Shakyamuni Buddha, holding up a flower before the crowd, said: “I have wondrous bright true nature, nirvana’s wondrous heart, the treasury of the true dharma eye—can others see it?” Only Kāśyapa smiled faintly holding the flower. My fellow seekers, Kāśyapa and Shakyamuni, openly building plank roads, secretly crossing Chen Cang; before the great assembly, secretly transmitting the secret dao, heart to heart, mouth to mouth. Those seated here, the crowd, do not know what is transmitted, what is received. Likewise, Confucius the Great Sage, before the array of sages and wise sons, said to Zengzi, “Zeng, the dao I teach is one thread running through all.” Zengzi said, “Yes.” At that time many disciples were present; is it not that the sage transmitted the dao before the sons, and Zengzi measured the dao among the disciples? When people do not recognize their own heart, they meet yet do not meet, and do not know what is transmitted or what is measured. Zengzi deeply understood his own nature, naturally harmonizing with the sage’s heart. Long ago, the Yellow Emperor Xuanyuan went to Mount Kongtong to seek the dao from Guangchengzi. Repeatedly he entreated, but Guangchengzi did not respond. The Yellow Emperor withdrew to cultivate fasting, dwelling quietly for three months, then returned to invite him downwind, crawling on his knees, humble and deferential, asking the essentials of the august dao. Guangchengzi then answered: “The essence of the august dao is profound and dark; the utmost of the august dao is dim and silent. No seeing, no hearing, embrace spirit in stillness, the form will correct itself. Must be still and clear; do not trouble your form; do not let your thoughts busy themselves; then you may long live. Guard your outside, close your inside; too much wisdom leads to ruin. I keep to the one, dwell in harmony; thus for twelve hundred years I have not aged.” These few words, spoken straightforwardly to the Yellow Emperor, ended the discourse. Whether you follow them or not, that is up to you. This is called each fulfilling their own dao.

My fellow seekers, in our dao gate, the dao and virtue of Nanhua hold many wondrous meanings; the Chongxu text begins with numerous true words. Along with the Three Caverns and Four Auxiliaries, the thirty-six marvels, countless scriptures! Who can sweep clean the ear root, respectfully listen to the wondrous words of the sacred scriptures; open the vision, transcend and awaken to the great dao beyond words? Without awakening, the heart is not bright; even meeting a sage teacher, one will not recognize.

My fellow seekers, before seeking a teacher, first seek yourself. Before inquiring the dao, first question your heart. If you do not act according to precepts, it is exceedingly difficult to find a teacher and receive the seal of the dao. The crucial point is this: you must be humble and lowly, first root out all pride and arrogance, soften and yield. Cut off thoughts of slander and jealousy entirely. When meeting others, do not boast of your ability; only fear someone might be like you. If you meet a discerning high person, an empty-hearted aspirant, who with a word or two cuts you in half, how will you struggle free? Naturally, like snow melting to reveal a corpse, you cannot escape the discerning. Now I earnestly advise all: seeking teachers and inquiring the dao is not something to do hastily. Before asking a teacher, bow down several times; listen to a few words of “teacher” spoken. Nowadays, disciples lightly regard teachers and disdain the dao—this is everywhere. My fellow seekers, you must urgently turn inward and reflect, repent before the ancestral teachers of old, transform old habits, respect the dharma treasure. If your heart is truly earnest and sincere, keep your eyes open in search of a teacher; Heaven will not forsake you, immortals and true ones will come without seeking, no need to limit by distance, time, or speed. Hear my verse, the verse says:

“Seeking teachers requires conquering self,  
Inquiring the dao demands sincere heart.  
Only with sincere heart can the dao be realized,  
With earnest thought one meets good causes.  
Ten thousand kalpas hard to encounter,  
A thousand lives to reach this moment.  
If you can understand my words,  
Suddenly awaken before roots arise.”
