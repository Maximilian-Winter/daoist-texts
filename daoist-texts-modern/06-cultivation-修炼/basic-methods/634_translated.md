# Ten: The Equal Holding of Concentration and Wisdom

The assembly, those who have only received the Initial True Precepts, when advancing to receive the Middle Ultimate, must first thoroughly and meticulously practice the subtle and wondrous conduct of the Initial True Ten Precepts, holding them closely and carefully; only then may they proceed to receive the Three Hundred Great Precepts of the Middle Ultimate. 

Now, assembly, what difference is there between the Middle Ultimate Precepts and the Initial True Precepts? The one precept forbids nothing without exception; the True One comprehends all without remainder. Why then, after the Initial True, comes the Middle Ultimate, and after the Middle Ultimate comes the Celestial Immortal? Why this order of distinction and sequence? Assembly, this principle is exceedingly clear and easy to see. I shall draw this principle from the void itself and reveal it to you.

Great assembly, the precepts you first receive—the Initial True Ten Precepts—are meant to teach you to restrain the colored body, to ride the wind and break the waves, forbidding reckless movement and wandering, the arising and ceasing without constancy. The Middle Ultimate’s Three Hundred Great Precepts instruct you to subdue the stubborn heart, forbidding wild thoughts and reckless imaginings, the seven minds and eight intentions. The Celestial Immortal’s wondrous precepts teach you to liberate the true intent, forbidding clinging and binding attachments. Assembly, the Initial True Ten Precepts are coarse; the Middle Ultimate Three Hundred are refined. The Initial True Precepts govern the external six senses; the Middle Ultimate Precepts sweep away the internal six dusts; the Celestial Immortal’s wondrous precepts cause the three bodies to be liberated, the eight consciousnesses to vanish, and the nine demons and ten tribulations to dare not infringe.

Assembly, the Initial True Precepts arise because you suddenly awaken to past faults, deeply pursue old errors, and reflect that life in this world is limited by time, birth and death are impermanent. Since you have left home and become Daoists, you are called Quanzhen, the Complete Truth. But consider carefully: since leaving home until now, when have you truly been complete and true? Year after year, you have idled away your days, growing old just like the worldly folk. From dawn to dusk you wade waters and climb mountains, fleeing south and north; though you have paid respects at several famous mountains and seen more stones and trees than common folk, in the end you suffer the same hardships as merchants and travelers. Eating wind and lodging water—what use is that? When have you met an immortal? The secret formulas you recite are but the dealings of worldly men, eyes clouded by mortal dust. You mumble a few alchemical scriptures, memorizing them rigidly, swallowing stones without knowing their taste. Thus, you are no different from the common folk; how can you transcend the world and surpass the mundane? 

Today, having received the Initial True Precepts, this heart that knows fault still retains its original face. Why not transform your usual false heart into a true heart, your usual false intention into a true intention, your usual false visage into a true visage? Reveal your true heart and extend repentance. Let the day you receive the precepts be called the day of the Initial True Precepts. These Initial True Precepts require practicing the four great dignities, adorning the body’s appearance, but they have nothing to do with the Dharma body, nor with concentration and wisdom. Know that because you are so restless and unsettled, these ten precepts restrain the body. If you can hold to these precepts, then the body will be calm and settled, ready to advance to the Middle Ultimate Precepts.

Assembly, the Middle Ultimate Precepts are the功 of concentration, unlike the Initial True Precepts. The Initial True is the character for precept; the Middle Ultimate is the character for concentration; the Celestial Immortal Precepts is the character for wisdom. At first, the Heavenly Venerable, out of compassion for all beings, established these precepts, concentration, and wisdom to subdue the功 of body, mind, and intent. This is the path to transcend the world and become extraordinary, the wondrous treasure of the Golden Elixir. Beyond these precepts, concentration, and wisdom, there is no other method. Though there are eighty-four thousand methods outside, none can surpass these two characters: concentration and wisdom. Whether you take divine pills, consume golden fluids, ascend to the heavens by day, uproot and fly through houses, wield divine powers to transform, fully empty the corpse and escape, manifest transformations while sitting or vanish, or reincarnate and seize another’s body—these many immortal arts—yet the light of concentration and wisdom stands firm and unmoving. It reflects these divine powers and magical arts like a bright mirror in the courtyard; every coming and going reveals its own form, all still within concentration and wisdom, unable to step beyond them.

Assembly, the middle character of Middle Ultimate is the Heavenly Pivot of the Dǒumǔ, majestic and unmoving; the ultimate character is the extreme of the Southern Pole that births, and the Northern Pole that governs death—the great mechanism of life and death depends entirely on the silent turning of the Dǒubǐng’s numinous pivot. The two characters of Middle Ultimate hold the authority of Heaven and Earth, grasp the handle of life and death. This middle character is neither inside nor outside, neither left nor right, neither front nor back; it is impartial and balanced, neither excessive nor deficient. To truly hold to the center and achieve harmony—many words exhaust themselves compared to guarding the center; the gentleman walks the middle path, stands upright without leaning. The mysterious pearl, the millet grain, the great ultimate Golden Elixir—many false names and aliases—all in truth do not go beyond this wondrous, clear, and unclouded true nature. Assembly, what then is the equal holding of concentration and wisdom?

Assembly, this one point of spiritual mechanism, since beginningless time, has been entangled by the three karmas, stained by the six dusts, bewildered by the seven emotions, invaded and deceived by the six desires, steamed by the three poisons, and overpowered by the ten demons. It stealthily steals your spiritual mechanism, neither daring to die nor daring to live immediately. Above, it cannot observe the dao of Heaven, nor grasp the workings of Heaven. Assembly, this point of spiritual mechanism is a treasure of the法, only to be reversed, never to be followed forward. To follow forward is to move with things, to be stirred by circumstances, to invite demons and gather monsters, to cause harm and suffer disaster, to enter and exit the wheel of rebirth, the four births and six paths, wandering and drifting. Those who receive the Middle Ultimate Precepts must reverse this course. Reversing means not turning with any thing, not turning with any circumstance; demons, monsters, and disasters dare not violate, the wheel of rebirth can be exited, wandering can be transcended.

Now, what is called following forward? In worldly law, to bear sons and daughters, to take wives and buy concubines, children and grandchildren, fathers and sons, fame and wealth, to scramble for family and property, to buy fields and lands, to wear fine silks and brocades, to don embroidery and trailing robes, to covet lust and pleasure, to kill and harm life, to fill mouth and belly with delicacies—all these are but convenient enjoyments of the colored body. This colored body is originally earth, water, fire, and wind, temporarily combined as the human skin bag; because of father’s essence and mother’s blood, coupling and lust, the essence qi responding, gathering blood into a mass, spirit consciousness entering the soul, establishing the fetus and fixing life—all arise from the transformation of two qi into the body, ultimately impermanent, finally returning to the earth. Yet these two matters of功 and罪 do not concern the colored body, but rather the法身 suffers.

Alas! Assembly, you do not believe and instead say the法身 is originally within the colored body; when the colored body dies, the法身 is empty; when the person dies, the spirit qi returns to emptiness and disperses. How then can there be talk of Heaven and Hell, hungry ghosts and beasts, the法身 receiving retribution? Now I ask you: when the human body dies and the qi disperses to emptiness, why do people’s parents, after their passing, set up offerings at the four seasons and eight festivals? If after death this spirit qi is not taken by the underworld to be examined and judged, the good and evil, fierce and gentle, debts and thefts, killings and cuts, all kinds of grievances from life before—then this spirit qi would not come to receive the offerings of descendants in the world. If it does not come to enjoy the offerings of the world, then the ancient Zhou rites and other books should not falsely speak of many sacrificial texts, vessels, ceremonies, and rites; Confucius the great sage should not say that treating the dead is like treating the living, that serving the departed is like serving the present, that offerings are as if present, offerings to spirits as if the spirits are there; the dignified and splendid attire for offerings, grand and magnificent as if the spirits are above or beside; the poems say the spirits’ character and thoughts are beyond measure, King Wen is above, clear as Heaven itself. Assembly, since these sayings have been passed down—“as if above,” “King Wen above”—my heart already holds the sincerity that ghosts and spirits come and visit. Since my heart holds this sincerity, then on that day the Duke of Zhou, Confucius, and these great sages must have deeply known the conditions of ghosts and spirits, and thus established these sacrificial texts, vessels, ceremonies, and rites, to teach countless generations for eternity. How could sages tell lies and fabricate monsters?

Moreover, today, officials and gentry who are granted posthumous titles and added ranks—if the spirit qi after death disperses and knows nothing, then the posthumous honors are already excessive. Who then receives the golden seals and purple edicts, the grace and favor to ascend to Heaven? If receiving blessings means there are ghosts and spirits, and receiving punishment means there are no ghosts and spirits, then this person’s heart is still unclear, their spiritual mechanism unenlightened. The foremost villains and fools only know greed for wine and lust, confusion over wealth and power, have not realized the karmic roots after death, only recognize the present blood and qi, and weakly recite a few lines of poetry saying: “Do not think of endless matters after death, just drink one cup of wine in life.” Yet they do not recite the other two lines: “When the body dies, a myriad things cannot follow; in the dark below only karma accompanies the self.”

Assembly, karma has three kinds. The first karma is unwholesome karma, all its branches and leaves unceasing and endless, without end or cessation; cause and effect, effect and retribution. If one does not believe in ghosts and spirits, does not revere Heaven and Earth, does not fear royal law, is disloyal to the sovereign, unfilial to parents, breaks the three bonds and the five relationships, slanders sages and worthies, kills, steals, and commits evil lust, is crafty and cruel, acts recklessly and falsely, causing fear in the family gate and bullying in the village—after death such a fate falls into Hell, moving from prison to prison, suffering endless torment, then reborn into the human world as a beast. After the beast’s retribution, again reborn as a human with incomplete senses, foolish and dim, unaware of human affairs, hated by all, despised and vile, body forced into servitude. Then becoming a beggar, covered in sores and filth, stinking with lice, clothes insufficient to cover the body, food insufficient to fill the mouth, hungry and cold without complaint, suffering ten thousand pains. Dying in the wilderness, eaten by ants and dragged by dogs, a faint and lonely soul, sinking again into Hell.

The second karma is wholesome karma: intelligent and upright, honest and fair, relatives joyful, village peaceful, reverent to parents, respectful to spirits, honoring Heaven and Earth, valuing the sovereign, respecting teachers and elders, loving friends, pure in body and transforming desires, not greedy when facing wealth, not covetous when seeing beauty, five relationships unbroken, all affairs proper. Including those in the mountains like hermits, old Daoists in caverns, sweet and plain, enduring shame, with concentration not yet firm, Dao practice incomplete—after death, reborn as humans, becoming officials and dignitaries, becoming respected teachers, enjoying existing wealth and honor, or attaining both blessings and longevity, peaceful and glorious, joyful all life.

The third karma is pure karma: aspiring to sages and worthies, wishing for immortals and Buddhas, holding good thoughts, speaking good words, acting in good deeds, meeting good people, treading good lands, holding good things, dignified and solemn, body unmoved falsely, heart not wandering falsely, aiming for a clear heart, aiming for a still heart, with long and profound功, primordial spirit calm and settled, always dwelling within the Scarlet Chamber, inside the Yellow Court, the Golden Palace and Jade Hall, all attachments cease, all thoughts empty, only seeing the true spirit, forgetting form and things, forgetting境 and機—this is called concentration. This is no small matter; it is the realm of the Three Pure Ones, surpassing the thirty-six heavens above, penetrating the seventy-two earths below, roaming freely beyond the Three Realms, turning and moving within the Five Phases. This realm of concentration is vast and obscure, dim and silent, spinning Heaven and Earth, returning again to chaos, forming one qi, neither Heaven above, nor Earth below, neither human in the middle—unspeakable, unutterable, inconceivable. Suddenly it emits divine light, surging forth a wheel of wisdom nature. It separates the clear as Heaven, the turbid as Earth, the harmonious principle qi as the法身. Wisdom pervades the Three Realms, shining the Great Mystery, no thing can escape its form and trace, no matter unknown in its coming and going, no slightest hindrance, no thread of obstruction, no speck of dust. All heavenly dragons, ghosts, spirits, demons, and monsters all surrender. When the King of Hell appears, he dares not raise his voice; ox-heads and nightchasers hold fists and bow in submission. Holding the thin, nameless death register without surname, one may live long in the world. Speaking the法 to save people, one may fly with divine feathers and transform. Finally entering pure emptiness, attending the Primordial, forever escaping the wheel of rebirth.

Assembly, the crucial heavenly secret lies only between true heart’s movement and stillness. Great stillness is called concentration power; true concentration is named the light of wisdom. If one does not first die to the false heart, calm the spirit and settle the qi, how can one attain great concentration? If one cannot always be clear and still, how can one enter concentration? If one cannot enter concentration, how can one be born into wisdom? Assembly, when the heart is empty, the spirit is settled; when the spirit is settled, light arises. If there is concentration without wisdom, it is called yin spirit surpassing yang spirit. One must have wisdom born within concentration. Wisdom is the法身; concentration is the Buddha practitioner. Assembly, concentration is the home, precept is the path, wisdom is the living person; all things, all realms, all affairs in the world are but guests. If concentration and wisdom mutually generate and arise, entering the myriad wondrous gates, then the true Lord’s divine power and wisdom are fully nurtured, manifesting brightness. Able to respond to all things and affairs without being bound by them; able to turn the world’s myriad realms without being confused by them; able to transcend yin and yang, birth and death, and the wheel of rebirth.

Assembly, first you must understand the two paths of guilt and blessing, cause and effect, and hold to the precepts one by one, never daring to deviate even slightly. After long contemplation and understanding, naturally you will be clear and bright. Then you may enter quiet observation and concentration. Within concentration, the original nature is perfectly bright, the light of wisdom shines clearly, spirit and qi suddenly awaken. Then mountains, rivers, and earth are no more than one body; all things, life and death, no more than one thought. From the true Lord’s spiritual brightness comes the handle that does not enter the wheel of rebirth. This功 of the middle character cannot be replaced by father or son, cannot be known by gods or ghosts; only you yourself must manage and practice it.

Assembly, I set the heavenly ladder firm; I do not know who will ascend it. The raft of the dao is pushed; I do not know who will board it. Hear this poor Daoist’s verse:

> The river of love vast and boundless, no one ferries it across;  
> The sea of suffering vast and obscure, few have the法 bridge.  
> Assembly, quickly hold the Three Hundred Precepts,  
> With ease, concentration and wisdom will emerge from the waves.
