# Eleven: Secret Practice of Cultivating Reality

Beloved assembly, since you have vowed to cultivate reality, aspiring to become a perfected Daoist of the Complete Reality School, you must first clearly distinguish the two words “true” and “false,” see through them with perfect clarity, and only then set to diligent effort. To exert oneself to transform the false utterly into the true — this is the essential task of the cultivator.

Beloved assembly, listen as I speak of the false, so that you may diligently cultivate the true. This body of yours is itself false, a phantom form named impermanence. The six roots will surely decay; the six consciousnesses will ultimately return to emptiness. The breath at the throat serves a thousand uses, yet once impermanence strikes, all affairs cease. Beloved assembly, have you not seen how worldly people are born? Their bodies grow nine feet tall, their waists encircle ten spans; their faces like full moons, their lips like red dots; eyes black as lacquer, skin soft as cotton fat; countenances dignified, bearing awe-inspiring presence; capable of speech and discourse, clever and cunning; a thousand stratagems, myriad devices; intelligent in letters, strong in arms; high officials and fierce generals, artists and talented men; trading and commerce, grasping profit and fame; greedy for glory, expanding wealth and family. In painted halls, twelve golden hairpins; on jade steps, three thousand bejeweled shoes; advancing and retreating, flattering and courting favor. Gold and silver surpassing the Northern Dipper, treasures like the Southern Mountains. Jade food and brocade robes, when eating, a hundred delicacies; among friends and heroes, everywhere proper etiquette. Wives half aged, discarded for new ones; concubines in throngs, forgetting that spirit and essence are exhausted. Property rich and vast, good fields of ten thousand acres laid as foundation; sons and daughters flourishing, official ranks of the highest grade still deemed insufficient. Day and night without rest, lost in flowers and beauty; craving and greed, weariness of body and mind. Heat, dampness, wind, and cold, the six pulses of yin and yang confused and reversed; driven on in pursuit, the three souls scattered and flying. A hundred illnesses attack, birth, aging, sickness, and suffering; a thousand calamities unrelenting, fatigue and distress. Taking ginseng and poria without cure, calling on Heaven and Earth without spirit; pain of a thousand kinds beyond words, one day breath breaks and descends to the underworld. Dignified countenance, yet before the turn, people cover their noses; awe-inspiring presence, yet once eyes close, the face turns heavenward. Limbs folded like wood in a coffin, the image only on paper; children do not come to replace the dead, wives and concubines do not follow. The corpse not yet cold, the living’s thoughts already arise; brothers divide wealth, wives and concubines hide treasures and fine clothes. Those with children think only of passing on the household; those without sons consider marrying off daughters. Guests and carriages grow scarce at the gate; common saying goes, “When the person is gone, so is affection.” Servants at home begin to steal; one wishes to say, “When power falls, slaves oppress.” Walls and gates collapse—who cares? Family fortunes scattered—who knows? Wives immoral, children unfilial, each minding only their own future. How many have died and not returned? Who has gone and come back again? Born with empty fists, dead with bare hands. The colored body returns to earth, the name returns to emptiness; the two paths of good and evil clearly receive their retribution.

Beloved assembly, see that these forms and appearances are illusions, are they not false? Yet if they are false, then those who seek wealth, status, wives, children, enjoy honor and riches — their one spark of true spirit is indeed not false. Where does this one true spirit go? Clearly, it dwells in the dark. If it clearly dwells in the dark, then why still crave wives, children, riches, and honor? Beloved assembly, these two causes of good and evil, these two retributions of guilt and blessing, these two fruits of suffering and joy follow as surely as shadow follows form. The colored body suffers pain and punishment; is there the slightest escape? Therefore, it is necessary for you all to regard the colored body lightly and the dharma body highly, to use the false to cultivate the true, to preserve the true and abandon the false, in order to seek liberation from the sea of suffering. Yet without this colored body, there is no place from which to cultivate; the one spiritual dharma body cannot act independently, falling into the Six Paths of reincarnation — what a waste of effort! Since we have already received the human body and entered the Dao’s gate, we must resolve to escape the wheel of rebirth, while this eye of vision has not yet closed, diligently cultivating reality.

How then is the method of cultivation? Beloved assembly, you must sweep clean the dust from the six root gates, harmonize the five organs and five qi, keep the master ever dwelling in the numinous platform, so that demons and thieves cannot invade, and frequently perform good deeds to uproot the seeds of sin.

But within this method of cultivating reality, there are two paths. Within these two paths, there is true and false, there is action and non-action. The Diamond Sutra says: “All conditioned dharmas are like a dream, an illusion, a bubble, a shadow, like dew or a flash of lightning.” The Scripture of Purity says: “The reason sentient beings do not attain the true Dao is because of their deluded minds.” From these two scriptures, we know that within cultivating reality, the path of action is not good. Yet there is a school that moves essence and circulates qi, connects life and death, reverses aging and returns youth, achieving longevity and immortality, practicing outward forms. There is also the practice of ascending lead and descending mercury, striking the cauldron and burning herbs, taking elixirs, swallowing talismans, and absorbing qi. All these count as using the false to cultivate the true, all are various false methods of action. How can one thereby see one’s nature, establish one’s life, and escape the wheel of reincarnation? To be born beyond birth and death, it is certainly not by these means.

Beloved assembly, to use the false to cultivate the true, you must carefully investigate the great matter of birth and death, and truly understand the genuine path. Where is this path? It lies solely in the single mind’s accord or discord. Accord means yielding to others; discord means following the self. The human colored body, whether cultivated or not, must die; even if it lives a thousand years, it will return to dust in the end — but why come at all? Beloved assembly, where there is form, there is decay; where there is beginning, there is end; where there is creation, there is transformation; where there is gathering, there is scattering; where there is coming, there is going; where there is growth, there is aging. Since this body is born, it must naturally die. The birth and death I speak of do not concern this body, but only borrow it as a dwelling place, cultivating my heavenly mandate dharma body. Outsiders do not understand this principle, and thus mistake the false for the true, clinging to form, trying to cultivate the flesh and blood body to be indestructible and deathless — is this not laughable? The birth and death I speak of lie only within the true heart in this body, in the thoughts moved and deeds done. When deluded thoughts cease, the dharma body arises; when the dharma body is still, the heavenly mechanism stirs; when the heavenly mechanism stirs, the true light appears. Originally, this true light cannot be perfected; it borrows this colored body to perform many good deeds. Good deeds themselves have true and false: to cling to form is false; to not cling to form is true. See how the Tathagata gives without attachment, merits without form, teachings without form, cultivation without form. Not clinging to form, he transcends the world; able to transcend the world, he escapes birth and death. The Scripture of Purity says: “The highest virtue is non-virtue.” This means non-attachment; otherwise, there is no liberation, no escape from birth and death — only a few more years of life and some blessings. When blessings are exhausted, one still cannot transcend the wheel of rebirth. Beloved assembly, I urge you to follow the Most High’s teaching: when the body is outward, the body exists; when the body is inward, the body leads — only then can one die without perishing. Beloved assembly, put the body aside; do not obsess over shaking essence and stirring qi, craving the rising and falling of essence and qi, opening orifices, unblocking vessels, extending years and curing illness. Loving these things, you instead cling to the colored body’s solidity and carefree ease, foolishly neglecting your true nature, day after day without care. You do not know that one day, little demons will catch you unawares and suddenly snatch you away. At that moment, where will your dharma body drift with the waves? Your colored body will be consigned to the mud pit — all will be emptiness in the end. I urge beloved assembly to secretly and diligently practice the power of calming the mind and enduring patience, so that early you may see your nature — how then could you fear that life will not be established? Beloved assembly, I remind you: the colored body is a house; the dharma body is the master of the house. If the master has treasure, why fear the house not being orderly? If the master is ill or troubled, or invites calamity and disaster, and is taken away, then who will live in that orderly house? To raise this one step further, to awaken you: the colored body is a rented house, not one bought. When the master departs, it returns to dust; earth, water, fire, and wind separate and return to the four great elements. If you can secretly cultivate a true dharma body that does not cling to form, why fear the colored body will not be settled in a good place?

Beloved assembly, I have a humble verse or two, listen as I recite:

“The colored body is originally the dharma body’s house;  
When the inside is bright, the outside naturally shines.  
Only wish the master cultivates blessing and wisdom,  
Why would the house fail to glow splendidly?  

Complete Reality first must eliminate falsehood;  
True dharma must reject false dharma and delusion.  
No boasting, no clinging to form,  
Dual cultivation of nature and life escapes impermanence.  

Only by calming the mind to seek liberation,  
The phantom body laid down reveals the true body.  
Greedy for life, afraid of death, in the end must die;  
Clinging to form to cultivate truth — how can it be true?  

The Tathagata cut off body and form;  
The Jade Emperor once endured insult.  
Forgetting body and losing life for three thousand kalpas,  
Abandoning state to return to mountains for eight hundred decades.  

Daoists cling to a false skin bag,  
Through myriad kalpas and births, never leaving dust.  
Do not use mind, do not waste spirit;  
Form must return to yin in the end.  

If still lost in true nature,  
The sea of suffering is vast and nowhere to seek.  

Alas, pitiful, false within false, layer upon layer,  
In vain to study Complete Reality to attain truth.  

Birth, aging, sickness, demons, sorrow, death, suffering,  
At death, how different from worldly people?  

Wearing yellow crowns and feathered robes in vain,  
Never knowing the secret of life and death.  

Seeking clothes and food, wandering to the ends of the earth,  
Sin and karma upon the body, man turns to mud.”  

If one does not understand that guilt and blessing are originally empty, birth and death’s wheel will not cease; if one has not realized that false and true originally lie within oneself, who will open the light of wisdom?

Beloved assembly, each of you contemplate carefully: birth and death are impermanent and swift. What I have spoken of secret practice has three hundred rules, among them the Great Precepts of the Middle Extreme, three hundred subtle points. Cultivate the body and the body becomes upright; cultivate the mind and deluded thoughts vanish. Inner use makes one sage; outer use makes one king. One may transcend the world, attain the fruit of clear emptiness, save others from suffering, and resolve the wheel of birth and death. The first and most urgent is the word “secret.” Without secrecy, there is no Complete Reality; without Complete Reality, the mind is unclear; without clarity of mind, nature cannot be seen. Beloved assembly, how to be secret? The sages cleanse the mind and retreat into secrecy. Secrecy means utmost vigilance. Precise secrecy is hidden and concealed, the utmost of secrecy. Beloved assembly, all who accept the Great Precepts of the Middle Extreme, from the first to the hundredth precept, is the great divine spell for purifying the body. Carefully observe and hold this spell; it is necessary to remove all restlessness from this body, turning it clear and calm, casting away frivolity, replacing it with steadiness. In the four great dignities and manners, when walking one must walk the middle way; when sitting, do not lean aside; when standing, stand straight; no leaning on walls or pillars, no propping on tables; when lying down, bend the body and lie on the side; no lying flat on the back snoring. Even the breath’s slightest sound must be regulated, cultivating a respectful and courteous bearing called external dignity. From the hundredth to the two hundredth precept is the great divine spell for purifying the mind. Meditate deeply on this spell in accord with the Dao; every thought returns to truth; every point accords with the Dao; not a word is relaxed. Contemplate again and again, awaken again and again; observe things from afar, apply them closely to the body; restrain and remove the wild, chaotic, and perverse mind completely. When the true heart is calm and settled, then from the two hundredth to the three hundredth precept is the great divine spell for purifying intention. Not a trace may be lost; within it are the secrets of messages, the principles of coming and going; hidden in the mysterious capital’s palace, obscure and subtle, inconceivable, beyond form and image; known by divine insight, not by words; the supreme, most honored, non-action wondrous Dao is fully expressed.

Beloved assembly, this is the secret practice of cultivating reality. Listen once more carefully and remember well: the supreme Dao must not be revealed recklessly. Beloved assembly, originally to cultivate reality and escape birth and death is no ordinary small matter. If the heavenly mechanism is not secret, it leaks to thieves; thus, the True Man Zhang of Purple Yang’s teachings leaked to thieves thrice and was struck by heavenly punishment thrice — therefore it must not be disclosed. Moreover, to transcend the wheel of rebirth, to leap beyond the world, to become a true man indestructible through myriad kalpas — is this not hated by Heaven, Earth, ghosts, and spirits, and resented by yin-yang creation? Furthermore, your turning the course backward and acting contrary to worldly ways is like ice and fire. You must be cautious and thorough; otherwise, kin will not rejoice, nine clans become enemies, wives will not love, friends will not trust — all because you fail to arouse bold and vigorous aspiration, thus giving rise to thoughts of abandoning the Dao.
