# Twelve: Repaying Gratitude and Dispelling Calamities

Beloved assembly, since you have renounced the world and taken up the path to seek transcendence, all the karmic debts forged through a thousand lifetimes, the grievances piled up through countless generations—these must be sincerely repented, utterly erased from this moment forth, never to arise again. Only then can one truly understand the bitter toil of repayment and retribution. Yet this teaching still belongs to the lower path of inferior retribution, meant for those who flee their debts and grievances, those who fear death and cling to life, the small-minded and incapable among the lesser practitioners. Such a person’s heart is clouded, their innate nature unmanifested; they only seek what is immediate, heedless of the life to come. For now, I will speak to the assembly about this kind of external path, so that you may understand, understand well.

There was once a Daoist who entered the path halfway through life, wandering and visiting masters. Along the way, he met several companions who together vowed to settle in a hermitage on Mount Lao in Shandong to cultivate. Later, due to the chaos of war, they descended the mountain and took up residence beneath King Wu’s mountain in Henan, meditating alone. Six men lived there, sharing the same place but differing in spirit and aspiration; each had their own practice. After one year, three departed, leaving only three. They renewed their vows, jointly seeking transcendence. Among these three, one first passed into sitting transformation; this inspired the remaining two to greater resolve. Then another also passed into sitting transformation, leaving but one to cultivate alone. While meditating, this last one entered samadhi and his soul wandered to Mount Tiantai, where he unexpectedly encountered one of his departed companions. The two rejoiced greatly.

The departed one said, “Fortunate to meet a kindred spirit! I was just about to tell you: you should revise the vow you made the year before last. At that time, I vowed to cultivate, to repent grievances and seek liberation. But who knew that just the other day, when the dust of my karma was exhausted, I arrived before the Three Heavenly Gates. The examining officials loudly commanded: ‘This person’s root of grievance still remains; the kalpa of tribulation cannot be escaped; no name on the Heavenly Register, no place on the Elixir Platform; advancement is forbidden. He may go to Mount Yuntai, to the Three Primal Assembly Office, to receive an appointment.’ Suddenly, a fierce wind and cold air obscured the Heavenly Gate, hiding it from sight. My body was carried to the Three Primal Office, where I met the Three Officials, Great Emperors. They examined my record and said: ‘You are a lower path, small-minded, a side door practitioner, deluded in vain hopes of transcendence. For now, we pity your ignorance and misguidance. The mountain god of Tongbai Palace on Mount Tiantai is vacant; you shall go there to temporarily take up the post. When the Underworld vacancy opens, you will be officially appointed.’ I begged for instruction to aid my yin cultivation. The Three Officials, with compassionate faces, commanded: ‘When you sit on your meditation mat, your thoughts are not pure, your mind not empty. You have not seen through that the colored body is empty, that the nature and spirit are real; you have not realized that emptiness is not empty. You only know to repent the grievances of a thousand lifetimes, to erase the grudges of countless generations, believing that after leaving the home-life, grievances and debts will never again arise. Yet you have never deeply penetrated or fully understood how in the nature and spirit grudges are extinguished, how grievances are truly repented. Who says that the grievances and sins accumulated through kalpas and lifetimes can be dispelled by mere words or fleeting thoughts, blown away like wind? You must enter the gate, set your resolve, and learn the supreme path with great roots and great capacity, embracing universal salvation. The supreme capacity is when the mundane mind is instantly extinguished, when heaven and earth are empty, illusions turn to ashes, and self and other become one. Yet even then, lingering karmic debts and deep grievances cannot be undone lightly; bearing wealth and life debts cannot be taken lightly. That is why the ancient Buddha King Ari cut off his own limbs to repay past karma, without a trace of attachment, thereby attaining Shakyamuni. The Sixth Patriarch Master purified deep grievances, endured subtle sufferings, and thereby realized the Great Mirror of the Western Heaven. Now your resolve is small and your roots weak; you refuse to repay your debts and grievances, only seeking to escape suffering. You take the colored body as truly real, fearing only the coming of enemies, punishment, beatings, death, and pain. Your single-minded wish is for the body’s constant pleasure. This fear of repayment is selfishness of the lowest kind, a mark of the lower path. If the root of grievance is not empty, after rebirth through kalpas the cause of sin remains, and in the next life you meet again. This is called leaving the home-life, but in truth it is fleeing suffering. You cannot escape suffering; kalpa after kalpa you are entangled, generation after generation you are bound, all because your initial vow was thin and your aspiration not grand. This life’s leaving the home-life is merely called cultivating blessings, not cultivating the Dao. You should return to the wheel of rebirth, turning the great wheel of blessings. Only because you once recited a hundred scrolls of the Imperial Dharma and intoned the Miraculous Treasure Name for three years, with sincere and earnest heart, were you appointed as a True Person of rank. You should be truly granted the office of the Underworld Registrar. Now, since you are in the world, serving as a fasting master reciting scriptures, you have not failed in your assigned tasks. As for receiving others’ wealth, you have already given it all away. It is proper to add merit and promote you one rank. You shall be registered and appointed as deputy mountain god of the Grotto Heaven, swiftly managing affairs, cultivating in the yin realm without neglect.’ I then suddenly awakened in understanding, regretting my small resolve. I realized that small cause yields small effect; great vow yields great reward. Now I regret too late. I was about to enter your pure and numinous realm to speak to you. But because each must guard their post, I dare not leave the mountain boundary to wander. Daoist friend, your arrival is timely; you should go and renew your vow. For all grievances and enemies, do not shrink from repayment; with single-hearted resolve without retreat, only then can the fruit be great. If you harbor even slight attachments or fearful thoughts, there will be tests of escape, and even if you succeed, your fruit will not be great.’ Having spoken, he vanished.

The Daoist emerged from meditation, and only then realized this was a lower path externalist who cared only for his own salvation, destined to remain a mountain ghost in the future. Urgently, he burned the grass hermitage, took up his meditation mat, gourd, and staff, and began anew to cultivate the heart-mind. He endured all insults, accepted all sufferings, practiced all deeds. He drove out distracting thoughts and tempered body and mind. He vowed that if any grievances remained, he would not avoid sword or axe. He regarded this flesh-and-blood body as finite; he held the nature-heaven life pure and sacred. Without attachment or obstruction, unperturbed and unshaken, bare and shining bright, perfectly round and utterly pure, free and at ease. Blessed, he wished not to receive blessings; suffering, he did not refuse. With this resolve, many years passed.

Suddenly, one morning in quietude, he saw a Daoist approach to pay respects. Looking closely, it was the previously departed companion. His appearance was as before, but his face was ashamed, not daring to look up. When asked of his origin, he said he had fallen under a heretical path from his master, failing to understand the central principle. He constantly focused his spirit and breath on the elixir field; after long practice, he became a corpse-guarding ghost. His light was but a foot long, illuminating only his own corpse shell; beyond his body was still darkness, nothing visible. Now, because this Daoist entered meditation, his light grew bright and absorbed this departed companion into his quiet realm. After a short while, he too vanished! Only because this later surviving Daoist increasingly understood the nature and principle. Life lies in the nature; with each increment of understanding, there is more light; with more light, more wisdom; with more wisdom, more virtue; with more virtue, a higher fruit. Thus he emerged from meditation.

This Daoist asked himself: “My six senses have been cleansed, the eight consciousnesses dissolved, the five aggregates all empty, the seven emotions severed. I have fully taken refuge in the Ever-Pure, Ever-Quiet Great Heavenly Venerable.” Yet alas, parents gave birth, Heaven and Earth nurtured, mortal body and breath reached their limit. The next day, he descended the mountain and guarded the gates, saying: “Now I must bid farewell to all and return.” The assembly asked: “Why depart so swiftly?” The Daoist said: “My three karmas have been repaid, but four debts remain unfulfilled. I must be reborn once more to complete this one thought.” Having spoken, he cupped his hands, bowed to the void, and then completed sitting transformation.

Beloved assembly, listen well: their paths differ in right and wrong, their vows vary in magnitude. Looking back on these three, their fruit and rank are not the same. Assembly, those with great resolve are great persons; those with small resolve are small persons. When resolve is not great, the heart is not broad; when the heart is not broad, the mind is not spacious. When vows are not universal, the mind is narrow and the vision limited; the qi nurtured cannot be vast and expansive. When qi is not vast, it only fills a fragile illusionary skin bag, unable to fill the great void, to stand between Heaven and Earth, to pierce sun and moon, to penetrate myriad beings. How can this be called the Great Dao, the Ultimate Way?

Assembly, human life is borne by Heaven and Earth, illuminated by sun and moon, nurtured by parents, taught by sovereign and teacher—these are the Four Graces. These Four Graces are vast and profound, endless and inexhaustible. If one cannot repay them, one falls again into the colored body, the five aggregates of calamity and suffering, still unliberated. Cultivating blessings and wisdom together is still difficult to endure eternally. Assembly, now that you have taken refuge under the Three Treasures, why do calamities and sufferings still not cease? Blessings and wisdom are the sea of desire, wealth, and honor. The ancient sages said: “The river of love has waves a thousand feet high; the sea of desire has billows ten thousand layers deep.” One must wait until the waters dry and the waves cease, until the nature-source is clear and pure. You must realize that all ancient and modern figures share this same nature-source, born from egg and womb, moistly transformed, without conscious awareness. Recognizing that self and thing share the same source is repaying Heaven, endlessly giving birth, vast compassion, embracing defilement and enduring insult. Who is not of this same breath and spirit, flying, diving, moving, growing plants and animals, relying on it for nurture? This is repaying Earth. The nature-ground is bright; nature-heaven is round and clear. When encountering the dark and obscure, true words open the way, pointing out the lost path. When meeting the confused and drowning, one delivers the teaching of life, clearing away obstacles. This is repaying sun and moon daily. Carefully following the master’s instructions, strictly observing the nation’s laws, respectfully serving the sovereign’s edicts; not overstepping bounds, not violating virtue or order; guarding pure rules and following the scriptures; praying for sacred longevity and preserving the imperial plan; transmitting to future generations, flourishing the right path—this is repaying sovereign and teacher. The body is received from parents; hair and skin must not touch defilement. Eliminating selfishness between self and others, repenting and removing the suffering of the netherworld; the past toil of parents, resolving karmic knots of many lives; the present hardships of kin, repaying the burdens of vexation—only by fulfilling filial piety to the end of this colored body, without transcending parents, can one ascend to the true. Respecting all others’ parents as one’s own, honoring them with filial heart; protecting all children as one’s own, loving them as oneself; thus raising the seven mysteries, elevating the three generations—this is repaying parents.

Assembly, if this heart harbors even the slightest obstruction, how can one behold the Three Pure Ones, the Supreme Jade Emperor, the Three Officials and Four Saints, the Five Elders and Seven Perfected? You now constantly divide self and other, habitually spawning ignorance. Your heart and chest are narrow; you cannot endure a single matter. Your mind is shallow and small; you cannot contain a single person. You do not discern origins, erring in right and wrong. When honored, you rejoice; when insulted, you rage. Your resolve is not firm and deep; your thoughts are not bright. Your heart lacks tolerance; your body is often lax. You treat small faults as irrelevant, and pieces of length as your pride. How then can you call upon repaying Heaven, Earth, sovereign, teacher, and kin?

Assembly, to repay the grace of Heaven and Earth, you must understand the Dao of Heaven and Earth, embody the heart of Heaven and Earth, penetrate the principle of Heaven and Earth, and attain the virtue of Heaven and Earth. In a dark room, do not deceive; all false emotions must be cut away. Let the light of wisdom shine everywhere, truly embracing all filth and defilement. Accept losses without a trace of self; endure suffering without any theft of heart. When practice is genuine, the realm is bright and harmonious. When virtue is weighty and Dao high, ghosts and spirits respect and obey. Spirit clear, wisdom aroused, beings transform and humans return. Above, one may communicate with the imperial throne; below, command thunder and lightning. In drought, pray for rain to nourish all beings; in flood, pray for clear skies to dispel water calamities. Demons and evil hide; spirits and goblins flee. Above, pray for eternal fortress and boundless sacred life; below, pray for songs and joy throughout the land, for all people to prosper. This is indeed to elucidate the ancestral customs, to promote the Dao’s transformation.

Moreover, our assembly’s parents bore us for ten months, nursed us for three years, enduring countless hardships, their grace profound and boundless. When grown, we hope to care for them in old age and send them off at the end, bringing honor to the family gate. The sovereign toils day and night; the six ministries and nine ministers administer and promulgate, remove traitors and pacify the people, suppress evil and stop wrongdoing, honor the worthy and value virtue. The teacher deafens the deaf and opens the blind; thus Earth follows Heaven’s law; the three bonds clarify, the five constants fully known; good and evil distinguished, human and beast separated—how shallow is virtue? Now, you at home cannot support your parents; in office you cannot promote the state’s plans. Your clothes depend on a thousand doors’ alms; your food relies on the toil of ten thousand households. You merely drift with waves, muddle through the day, wander and play, mumbling empty words, neglecting Dao and virtue, ignoring precepts. When moving, you violate rules; spirit dim and heart scattered. When ascending the altar to pray for the nation, ghosts and spirits do not descend. When expelling demons and clearing pestilence, calamities do not heal. Talismans and methods are ineffective; prayers and rituals empty. The lowest, when encountering yin or flood, only meet curses and scolding winds and rains, hating Earth and blaming Heaven, wandering recklessly, even opposing kin and offending clan, breaking rules and cursing others. Assembly, you see oxen, horses, donkeys, mules, pigs, sheep, dogs, and swine—all possess five senses and six eyes, yin and yang, female and male, perception and spirit. Only now, they have one more mouth to speak. Alas!

At that time, the preceptor again showed a verse:

> “Cultivate both samadhi and wisdom, perfect the precepts with care;  
> Heaven and Hell are clear by one’s own division.  
> Not a thread of attachment, light ever pure;  
> Ten thousand burdens dissolve, heart thus clear.  
> Fate decreed by Heaven, unchanging;  
> To end birth and death, sincerity is key.  
> Side doors and strange paths, many divergent ways;  
> I universally urge comrades to awaken to truth and purity.  
> Four Graces not repaid, heart ashamed;  
> Three karmas remain, Dao not achieved.  
> To repay Four Graces, first guard precepts;  
> To erase Three Karmas, fully cultivate truth.  
> Guard precepts and naturally walk the right path;  
> Cultivate truth and ultimately realize life’s fleetingness.  
> Once fleeting life is realized, impermanence revealed;  
> Three karmas empty, Four Graces repaid.  
> Avoid the world, leave home, seek to transcend dust;  
> Greed, anger, and ignorance make true cultivation difficult.  
> When all passions end, heart is pure;  
> When nature is bright, Dao is close.  
> See through the colored body—who is real?  
> Observe all things—who is eternal?  
> Not a trace of attachment, three minds ended;  
> Ten precepts fully embraced, freely walk.”
