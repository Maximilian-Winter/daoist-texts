# Thirteen: Setting the Resolve and Making the Vow

Beloved assembly, from ancient times the sages, immortals, and Buddhas have all seen through the affairs of the world—everything conditioned, all forms and appearances, are but illusions. They yearned to transcend the mundane, to break free from the cycle of birth and death, retreating deep into mountains and forests, forgetting body and life, all to seek the supreme Dao.

Beloved assembly, you know only the names of these sages, immortals, and Buddhas, yet you do not know their true reality; you all harbor the heart to become sages and Buddhas, but you have not truly set the resolve of sages and immortals; you all desire to realize the fruit of sages and immortals, yet you do not cultivate the causes of sages and immortals; you all want to reach the status of sages and immortals, but fail to generate the vow-power of sages and immortals. Thus, words are spoken but deeds are not done—this is because the mouth is clear but the heart is unclear. The reason the Dao remains unclear is that one does not meet those who illuminate the Dao; and the reason the Dao is not practiced is that one does not find those who walk the Dao. Those who bear the name “Daoist,” have they ever truly grasped the subtle essence of the Daoist? Those who call themselves “Quanzhen,” who among them truly practice the reality of Quanzhen? No wonder filial piety declines and the ancestral Dao withers away. Now that you have taken refuge in the Three Jewels and uphold the precepts, you may be said to have met those who illuminate the Dao. But you must follow my true words and carry out the affairs of sages, immortals, and Buddhas—only then can you be called those who walk the Dao.

Beloved assembly, before sages, immortals, and Buddhas attained the Dao, they were just like you—ordinary mortals, no more eyes or hands than you possess. Only because they could set their resolve, seeking the method to transcend the world, understanding the mechanism of birth and death. This resolve is a hundredfold brighter and ten thousand times broader than that of ordinary mortals. Though the body remains mortal, the mind and thought already possess the sacred form. But a sage does not merely speak empty words about transcending the world; truly, in the heart is stored the will to act upon that transcendence. Hence they are called those with great heroic power, harboring great compassion. A great man, a teacher of Heaven and humans, is always one who sets a resolve beyond the ordinary. Therefore, in action, they do not act small. With thunderous vigor, a wisdom sword slung across the shoulder, eyebrows raised like flashing lightning; majestic and awe-inspiring, a precept blade at the neck, eyes wide open stirring thunder and lightning. The hearts of outsiders grow cold and flee afar; evil winds tremble and all wish to take refuge. Ascending the nine-grade lotus platform, straight to the throne of the Dharma King. Words issued forth with pure and clean Dharma sounds, all who hear are bathed in the pure Dharma voice. All heavenly beings are refreshed as if receiving ambrosia poured upon their heads. The body exhales the wondrous fragrance of Brahma qi; all who see it receive universal liberation. Countless multitudes become rivers of butter and cream. After attaining the Dao, great resolve fulfilled, they issue forth great vows—no longer concerned with self, appearance, sentient beings, or longevity. They do not wish to save themselves alone, but only to save others. Using the method of self-liberation, they universally liberate sentient beings, without reproach or judgment. Taking the heart of the common people as their own. The common people are simply another name for sentient beings. Sentient beings are our own kind. Using the method for one’s kind, to save one’s kind. Without liberating sentient beings, one does not truly wish to attain the Dao. The Scripture of Purity says: “Though named as attaining the Dao, one truly attains nothing; for the sake of transforming sentient beings, one is called to have attained the Dao. Those who can realize this may transmit the sacred Dao.”

Beloved assembly, sages, immortals, and Buddhas are no different from people. The difference lies only in the two words “public” and “private.” The sage is simply fair and upright, acting for others, not for self; the mortal is partial, deceitful, acting for self, not for others. The sage is clear and tranquil; the mortal is turbid, dark, and restless. The sage uses firmness within to govern the body, softness without to subdue others; the mortal uses softness within to excuse self, hardness without to blame others. The sage always fears that they may be wrong; the mortal only blames the faults of others. The sage, wherever entrusted, is always careful and attentive; the mortal, the more dangerous the task, the more careless and reckless. The sage has never died, yet understands the mechanism after death; the mortal dies before their eyes yet still only seeks livelihood. The sage seeks the method to transcend the world, refining the worldly methods of the heart—being a filial child, fulfilling filial piety; being a loyal minister, fulfilling loyalty; the mortal not only does not know the method to transcend the world, but does not even know the worldly methods—how then could they know loyalty to ruler or filial piety to parents? Pitiful are these confused and unawakened masses, knowing neither worldly law nor the law beyond the world. Drunk all day, dreaming all night, living in vain and dying in vain, born in the morning and dead by evening, stealing life and fearing death, blind in birth and blind in death. They bury the tiniest spark of true numinous nature inside the foul skin-and-bones, drifting through kalpas without end, unaware of inversion, turning over and over, changing faces and heads, revolving endlessly in reincarnation—who knows when they will finally break free?

Beloved assembly, having already taken the precepts, you have already broken through the head of the snake. Having broken through the head, you can break through suffering. Breaking through suffering, you can break through the world. To break through suffering, first you must endure suffering. Without enduring suffering, it is hard to break through suffering. You must rely on the true words of sages, immortals, and Buddhas; do not seek the empty fame of sages, immortals, and Buddhas. You must set the resolve of sages, immortals, and Buddhas; do not speak empty words of their fruit. You must plant the root of sages, immortals, and Buddhas; naturally, their retribution will come. You must accumulate the virtue of sages, immortals, and Buddhas; naturally, you will obtain their Dao. You must carry out the deeds of sages, immortals, and Buddhas; naturally, you will realize their position. If you act without regard to words, or speak beyond the truth, you are but a mortal who does not advance. To falsely imagine the Dao of sages and immortals—how could such a person without resolve ever walk it?

Beloved assembly! You must set a great resolve and issue a great vow, only then can you transcend the world. I now recite a verse:

Beloved assembly, the bitter resolve you have set, the great vows you have issued—I now command each one, urging every step. You, the high disciples who transmit the Dao and transform it, the immortal maidens who reveal the lineage’s style, the spiritual children who continue the Dao’s pulse, the Daoists who break through Heaven’s gate—across the ten continents and three islands, all have heard and all know. Each one must consider and early prepare a cultivated resolve—that is the true advantage. Hark! If this body does not transcend in this life, then in what life will it transcend? Time flies like an arrow, sun and moon like a shuttle; from your leaving the home to now, you have wasted years, delayed your time; hair like frost, skin wrinkled, teeth falling, sinews stiff and skin slack. Alas! When bones soften, one cannot travel far; when blood is spent, strength cannot bear weight. Essence withers, kidneys fail, eyes dim; spirit weary, heart wild, one spirit unsettled. Soul fades, spirit strong, ears droop to listen; stomach strong, spleen weak, appetite declines. Beloved assembly, know that this body is originally illusion—no matter how strong, death’s day will come, only differing in sooner or later. Like deaf ears, dim eyes, dry tongue and mouth, teeth loose and shaking, aching waist and curved back, white hair and scorched temples, stiff sinews and bones, numb hands and feet, short resolve, heart cold and thoughts frozen—all are the summons sent by King Yama, awaiting your early arrival. Do not only care for wife and child’s hearts, tofu business, petty knowledge, beastly delusion; only care for the present, not the next life. If today the ghost comes to fetch you, and you cannot endure, you must go. How can you be called a Daoist, having left the world and transcended the mundane? Can you escape or avoid it? Why not look through carefully and liberate early? A single step in vigilance, withdraw your hand and act—only then are you a great man, a wondrous hero. Set your resolve, have your means, leave home and cultivate. Otherwise, you will be timid in spirit, soft and weak in countenance. The four great elements—wind, fire, earth, water—each rushes to scatter; the senses of a lifetime disperse. Mumbling and muttering, drifting and wandering, floating and soaring, sinking down into hell. Alas! Beloved assembly, cultivation without resolve is like a puppet show—when the drums and gongs end, where will you go? Only by setting resolve can you transcend the world; without resolve and vow, it is exceedingly difficult. Only by setting resolve to cultivate the true Dao can the mighty spirit not be taken lightly.
