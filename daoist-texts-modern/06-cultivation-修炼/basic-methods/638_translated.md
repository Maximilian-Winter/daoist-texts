# Fourteen: Verification and Efficacy

Gentlemen, if you wish to cultivate the wondrous dao of pure stillness, non-action, and freedom, you must first possess resolve—a heart set on being truly free. If one can walk the path of freedom, then naturally the dao of nature itself lies within. But if freedom cannot be attained on high, can such a person truly be natural? When one cannot even manage worldly affairs properly, how can one claim to be free? The Immortal Master once said, “To cultivate the immortal dao, first cultivate the human dao. Without cultivating the human dao, the immortal dao remains far away.” The Confucian school says, “First bring order to the family, then you may govern the state.” Bringing order to the family is like cultivating the human dao; governing the state corresponds to the immortal dao. If the family cannot be governed, how can one govern the state? The Buddhist teaching says, “One must exhaust all worldly mind; there is no other sacred understanding.” This worldly mind is the principle of the Three Bonds and Five Constants. If one follows these fully, the human dao is complete, and cultivation of immortality is not difficult. Even if one cannot become sage, perfected, or Buddha, it is still an easy path.

How then to advance in cultivating the immortal dao? Gentlemen, when you first enter the mysterious gate, learn to be Daoists, bow to masters to receive secret formulas, then go sit in meditation, quiet your mind, and think you have exhausted the worldly human dao—believing the immortal dao is just around the corner. Little do you know, your reverence for the master is not yet complete; the secret formulas passed down are barely understood; yet you rush to strike at emptiness. As soon as you begin, you seek results. Sitting for three days, two days, seeing no visions, you abandon it. Then you seek another master, receive a few words, and go sit again. This craving for the dao lasts no more than two or three days before you seek results again, unable to still your thoughts. Such a confused mind and shallow wisdom, with scant cultivation, endlessly pondering, the spirit cannot settle—this is but a dream. Sitting for twenty or thirty years, you remain an ordinary mortal. When death comes, you do not even realize it. What a pity to waste time, to prolong years in vain—like scooping the moon from the water, or grasping flowers in a mirror. Where is the principle of ready-made immortals? Pitiful are those blind masters who manipulate, those external ways that deceive. I shall say no more. I only urge you to take the chapter on strict precepts and conduct, set your resolve to repay kindness, and repeatedly contemplate these. First correct your thoughts, remove vexations and ignorance. With a single heart turning to the dao, take refuge in the Three Treasures, recite the true scriptures by mouth, act according to the precepts. Sit in the Hall of the Ten Directions for one hundred days. Your outward appearance will be dignified, your physical form steady; nothing will be disorderly; your body upright. Then rise and perform prostrations, invite the true master, vow not to study the inferior or middling vehicles, wholeheartedly take refuge, and wish to hear the unsurpassed, ultimate, supreme, pure, and free wondrous dao of liberation—understanding birth and death, forever escaping the wheel of rebirth. Only then may you receive the initial ten precepts of the True.

People, how can it be otherwise? The dao begins with transforming one’s temperament and qi. After hearing the dao, you may sit on your meditation cushion, darken your mind, quiet your thoughts, sever worries, forget emotions, apply your heart fully, cast away worldly affairs. Then you receive the three hundred great precepts of the Central Pole. Reflect carefully, understand thoroughly, then you know the great cause and conditions lie within the body, not outside the mind. Delve deeply and truly in secret, perfect your wondrous practice, verify the void and naturalness. On the hundred-foot pole, there is still progress. Do not twist crooked into straight, nor ignorantly argue. Recognizing a few daoist sites, or gaining a small hermitage, taking in one or two disciples, you become content and proud, neglecting the precepts, concentration, and wisdom in your heart. You do not emulate the strict precept masters, whose demeanor is solemn and rigorous, nor do you harmonize with fellow disciples. Illiterate, half-understood, your person not yet transformed, you arrogantly claim your practice is superior. You hold a fan, write a few lines of alchemical verse, hang a pouch, carry a few alchemical scriptures, fiddle with gourds, gather many herbs inside, sell and cheat the common folk, claiming secret sea-born elixirs from mysterious masters. With the silver gained, you buy wine and meat. Mouth full of wild boasts, utterly ignorant of pulse and yin-yang principles, you randomly pick a few formulas and falsely claim achievement.

All day long you chatter about heaven and earth, run east and west seeking clothes and food. You ruin the Most High’s cosmic calculations, tarnish the reputation of the Perfected. Those who break precepts and violate discipline sow seeds of sin; in the future, their evil will be full, and the heavenly officials will surely punish them. They will fall forever into hell—pitiful and grievous! There is yet another kind: those just entering the dao gate, with small resolve and narrow wishes, who only want to sit and steal comfort. They refuse to humble their hearts and subdue their qi, refuse to sever attachments and emotions, dragging along muddled and clinging thoughts. They only seek quick results in their cultivation, manipulating qi and jing, opening or closing energy centers in confusion, mistaking thieves for sons, long unawakened. Unwilling to seek proof with humility, to observe and contemplate, they accumulate illusions until incurable. Many harm themselves and their destiny, falling into the wheel of rebirth. They treat the boundless great dao as flesh and blood lumps, mistake the conscious spirit for the primordial spirit, wandering aimlessly—how can they understand birth and death?

Gentlemen, you must heed my words: sweep away all these side doors, heretical methods, and deviant branches as soon as possible; boldly cast them aside. Temper your body, mind, and intention in the mandate of Heaven and your nature. Do not covet immediate results. Only seek insight in your heart. If you are determined to carry this heart straight on, even a wall of bronze and iron you will break through. Naturally, there will be a day of breakthrough, a moment when the fruit ripens and falls, your spirit suddenly enlightened, communicating Heaven and piercing Earth. If your blessings are thin and your affinity shallow, you must accumulate virtue and merit, be brave and diligent. Perhaps you will not awaken in this life, but awaken in the next; if not in the next, then in a thousand or ten thousand lives, awakening is inevitable. Set this vow, let the heart to realize the dao never retreat through kalpas. Surely you are a sage of great compassion and great vow, destined to attain the dao. Yet great blessings are easy to cultivate; pure blessings are difficult. If you aspire to transcend the world, this is the true dao—not the external ways that schemed and cooked, seeking immortality and unending life. Those are ghosts who watch mountains and guard corpses for ten thousand generations. This boundless pure and still true dao does not expect swift results, does not seek near merit, does not fix three years or nine years, but focuses on seeing one’s nature. Results appear daily, change moment to moment: moistening the mouth with fragrant saliva, strengthening hands and feet, the head forming a round image, the brain opening the heavenly gate, fire steaming in the abdomen, the whole body’s bones creaking. Yet these are middle or lower cultivation achievements, requiring step-by-step returning to the dao body. For the dao is originally utmost emptiness, the body originally utmost non-being—thus it is boundless. If one’s功 (gong) loses its proper place and mistakes apparent gain for true gain, this is a side door, an external path, losing by a hair’s breadth and erring by a thousand miles.

As for clinging to names and grasping forms, setting up stoves, raising lead at midnight, lowering mercury at noon, advancing yang fire, retreating yin talismans, practicing according to hexagrams, taking results by time—those who do not recognize returning to the dao body are all lower vehicles, small paths. But pure stillness and non-action is the wondrous dao of natural return, vastly different from these. Suppose the imperial classic issues a resolve and vow to transcend the mundane; this original heart is like the Jade Maiden releasing fragrance. Once the heart’s fragrance is released, it revives the six paths; those who smell this fragrance universally attain liberation. This releasing of fragrance is功 (gong); this smelling of fragrance is efficacy. Likewise, when the Jade Emperor emits light, all heavens and earths, the boundless worlds, are gathered into the light, like infinite bright mirrors mutually containing each other—this is efficacy. Likewise, breaking obstacles is功 (gong); the seventeen lights and thirty kinds of merit are efficacy. The merit and retribution chapters are the efficacy of reciting scriptures’ sins and blessings.

If you were formerly frivolous and reckless, your mouth never still, speaking nonsense; your hands never idle, only busy; your feet never resting, blindly wandering; sitting never still, only crooked; sleeping uneasy, body restless; eyes wide, looking east and west; walking about like a gust of wind—not the conduct of one cultivating the dao. Like an un-nosed ox, a bridleless horse, not following the central path uprightly. Now having received precepts, wearing the robe and sash, carrying the alms bowl and shoes, your body takes on the full perfected appearance. Learning from others, heeding words and example, you transform from crude haste to composed propriety—this is the功 (gong) of holding precepts. Transforming temperament and qi, changing into the dao’s appearance, causing others to respect you at first sight—this is the outward form of holding precepts. If you can hold wondrous conduct, think finely and conform to the dao, seeking only to illuminate the mind and see nature, not craving efficacy, only worrying功 (gong) is insufficient, not efficacy lacking—naturally, when the great time ripens, you awaken thoroughly.

If conduct is not secret and dense, only two or three thoughts, interrupted doubts, the heart not true so the spirit not numinous, the mind not pure so qi not gathered, spirit wandering and qi floating, thoughts not focused—whence comes efficacy? Today, since you have great resolve to escape the wheel of rebirth, widen your measure, focus on功 (gong), put efficacy behind—that is wondrous. Like a skilled physician administering medicine, seeking harmony; a mediocre doctor seeks quick results, ignoring the root cause, only craving early effect. Though seeing near effect, ultimately injuring original qi, the root essence temporarily lost, always many complications, the patient unaware, regret too late.

People, if you truly every morning and night act according to precepts, cultivate according to rules, always raise your mind, constantly seek, how can you fear no efficacy? Though your chest may expand and your vision clear, you still must calm your will and humble your heart, draw near the virtuous, then verify the high and brilliant. Never cling to the “I” form and forget the “person” form; nor cling to the “person” form and forget the “I” form. When both hearts do not arise, all four forms are empty—virtue, blessing, and efficacy naturally follow.

People, cultivating the dao depends entirely on one point of the heart: the heart true, the thought earnest, the dao close. If you understand the heart as empty and still, where is功 (gong) that does not become numinous? The heart must be cold, the thought ashen; cold ashes draw forth the towering fire. True fire qi can illuminate things; the sun in the heavens radiates brilliance. Holding precepts and功 (gong) tightly, in concentration efficacy and wisdom light arise. Inside, a millet seed contains heaven and earth; to tell others is folly. Gentlemen, listen carefully to these dharma words: how can a coarse, floating qi become immortal? Quickly follow precepts and rules to cultivate功 (gong), firm resolve, steadfast heart, cut off wandering thoughts. Secretly cultivate in dense mountain meditation, close the mountain gate, keep the heart refined. All four forms empty, heart quiet, two hearts not arising, dao harmonized and connected. Now I reveal the heavenly secret to you: seeing功 (gong) depends only on the effort of the heart. Diligent功 (gong) and bitter cultivation bring many efficacies, every moment dense and deep. Quiet inside, think for yourself, allow no one else to know even a bit. Do not cling to many states of mind; this is the moment of great awakening in the heart.

A foolish cat guards its den, moving with ignorance; deluded thoughts gestate a holy infant. When will Master Jin ride the blue tiger? Which family’s Wood Mother mounts the white dragon? The crown reveals three splendid lights blazing; the body hides five qi surging. Pitiful those who do not know true news, closing the spirit platform, nature not open. I tell you, do not slander the precept gate as low; precepts are the foundation of non-action entering the dao. A raft sails over waves, a ladder rises in empty air to heaven. Do not boast of your birth with arrogance; do not slander others debating right and wrong. If you do not accept the time, it controls you; why obstruct and cause others to doubt? Praise with the mouth, joy in the heart—this is to inspire the mysterious, protect the teaching. If you slander and invite heavenly punishment, cause and effect come true indeed.

Alas! Leave good people alone, do not speak good words, abandon the great dao and do not cultivate, only seeking clever tricks and making mistakes. Without following precepts, concentration, and cultivation, how can you obtain the Most High’s robe and bowl? Without cultivating both blessing and wisdom, how can body and mind be liberated? Without understanding principle, how can you untie the knots? Without removing obstacles and ignorance, how can your heart’s measure expand? More sin is worse than less; reckless speech worse than silence. The supreme dao differs from external paths; you treat it lightly, playing with your tongue. Everywhere selling secret formulas for money—sin and blessing, high and low are clear. If you are confused and do not awaken, in the future you have death without life. Turning around you become pig or sheep, your karmic retribution slaughtered by others. Hard to escape Heaven and Earth’s light and dark, the Five Calendars and Three Origins’ inspection. Know that sun, moon, yin, and yang are not muddled ink black. Naturally it is clear when a person is lost; everyone knows, do not slander falsely. With deep compassion and mercy, I urge you: take refuge early in the three thousand great precepts. When the heart has no obstacles, right and wrong are empty, sitting, lying, walking, and acting are all unobstructed. The fire of sin now turns to empty flame; night light reports the red of the dharma hall. From precepts, concentration, and wisdom arises liberation; guarding precepts with sincere resolve brings close transcendence.

If you doubt the precepts are false and spread lies, Heaven’s disgust will surely cut out your tongue. Those who learn and awaken have no doubts, do not stop the floating clouds, the wind sweeps them clear. Beyond kalpas, roaming free and at ease, suddenly cutting off idle vines and brambles. Following rules to cultivate and serve the heavenly venerables, voice not raised, head not bowed. Inside and outside one, spirit unerring; though an ordinary body, the dao is complete. Dao attainment is neither easy nor hard; holding precepts and precepts lies in the heart. Life and death, death and life arise from precepts and concentration; having taken refuge, do not neglect precepts as stubbornness.
