# Fifteen: Preserving Life and Extending Longevity

Disciples, when I, this humble Daoist, took the seat of honor the other day, I repeatedly urged you all to summon courage and make great vows, seeking above all to swiftly awaken to life and death. Do not belittle your resolve by learning the two vehicles of greed for life and fear of death. Yet today, I speak again of a heart-method for preserving life and extending longevity—does this not seem like double-tongued falsehood, a snare to bewilder the masses? Disciples, the heart-method I speak of for preserving life and extending longevity is not about clinging to the body’s form, nor merely about jing and qi; it is about guarding the postnatal lifespan, prolonging this fleeting life of the present.

What I mean by preserving life is the destiny of Heaven, the nature of fate—guarding the life bestowed by the Supreme Heaven, dwelling in ease and awaiting its time. The so-called destiny of Heaven is the nature of being, the wisdom-life of the Buddhist, the original life star of the Daoist path. This character for life (ming 命) signifies a deathless longevity. As the Diamond Sutra says: “How can one attain long life? The adamantine body is indestructible.” Destiny and Heaven are not two; cultivate body and mind and await it. Exhaust principle and fulfill nature to reach destiny—this is the essential principle of establishing life.

What is spoken of as extension is not curing illness to prolong years, nor immortality without death. It is the true, eternal body that is never destroyed through myriad kalpas, the law-body that endures from ancient times, the form that nurtures and transforms all beings—an extraordinary body indeed. If one means the skin bag, cultivating it may add a few years, but it only delays death; this is not the true Way. Now, when I say cultivate to preserve life, I mean the one who, like Heaven and Earth, is equal to all things. Though Heaven and Earth undergo change and movement, my original nature does not move or change. All things have an end, but my original nature has no end. Heaven and Earth and myriad things all have kalpas of coming and going, cycles of primal gatherings and world-turnings, but my serene truth is constant, empty and numinous without obscurity, transcending images and forms, unbroken by ruin or transformation. This is the life preserved, the life extended—namely, the true, eternal Way of Heaven’s principle flowing ceaselessly in birth and rebirth.

This section is spoken only out of utmost necessity, revealing the heart’s words. Those with discerning eyes who awaken to the profound seat of teaching, silent and wordless, will know the message within. The Great Dao is boundless, encompassing Heaven and Earth; nowhere can it be left out, no time is it absent, no thing is without it, nothing is not in accord. In daily use, in every detail, the Way is present. What the eyes see and ears hear, walking, standing, sitting, lying down, eating, breathing, advancing, retreating, dressing, and dining, sunshine and shade, cold and heat—all are the Way. Yet alas, you are obscured by things and constrained by qi, unaware in daily use. Within the void and non-being, brightness responds; before influence, step by step you are lost. Now I rely on the three teachings’ patriarchs, on the merciful heart of universal salvation, on the compassionate vow to benefit life, so I must speak at length to you. Therefore, I broadly proclaim to all beings: there is no second method; if there were two, it would not be the great vehicle of true awakening.

Your little spark of numinous spirit is another name for wisdom-life, originally one thing. This wisdom-life is the borrowed name of the Dao’s body, originally arising from one family. Because it springs from the same source yet differs, it contains three and bubbles into one. This wisdom-life appears constantly, yet you see no form; it hides every moment, yet you know not where; it speaks daily, yet you hear no sound. Are you not like fools searching for fire by the lamp, riding a cow while seeking the cow itself?

Disciples, why do I teach you to preserve it? I fear you do not recognize this wisdom as the numinous treasure. I know well that you often rebel against it, not being old cultivators who have seen nature, nor seasoned Dao elders who understand intention. Moreover, even when you see it, you do not use it. And when you do use it, you cannot use it fully. When this bit of life departs, it is like the Primordial Heavenly Worthy leaving his dharma seat, like the Yellow Emperor losing his mysterious pearl, like the Iron Ancestor leaving his staff, like the Transcendent Zhang Guo on his young donkey. Having a mouth but no words, blindly feeling one’s nostrils, having a heart but no aperture, lacking subtlety, gone in darkness. Now, I take up the holy heart of the Primordial to speak the Way, reverently embodying the great virtue of Patriarch Qiu’s love of life, to awaken you as with fresh nectar. Hurry, go and seek out the wondrous principle of preserving life and extending longevity.

Have you not heard of the *Most High Profound Numinous Treasure Scripture on Dispelling Calamities and Protecting Life*? Disciples, if you can turn and awaken to this scripture, you can continue wisdom-life endlessly, living and living without ceasing. If you merely recite the scripture’s name as an offering, that is not awakening. Those who offer it recite and then depart, unable to savor it deeply. Does not the scripture say: “You beings, since beginningless time, your mind has been servant to form, your thoughts follow shifting conditions. Only by attachment and love are you confused, without rest, drifting in the river of love, sinking in the sea of desire, clinging to illusory forms and appearances, obscuring your original face. The Dao is originally formless; clinging, it is taken as form. The Dao is originally not empty; attachment, it is taken as emptiness. Confused by emptiness and form, reversed in being and non-being, you cannot illuminate yourself. How can you escape the path of birth and death, leap beyond the karma of reincarnation? If one knows emptiness is not emptiness, form is not form; does not cling to emptiness views, and is free of all doubts and leaks, that person can purify the six roots and cut off obstacles. This is the essence of our gate. We speak the dharma to entrust it, the scripture named: Protect Life to Obtain the Way, Universal Salvation of All Beings, Teaching the World, Circulating and Reciting. Those who can read, recite, and transmit it will have flying celestial kings, diamond-breaker guardians, dharma-protecting spiritual children, saviors from suffering, golden-eyed fierce beasts, each with millions of hosts, guarding this scripture so that all may leave these defilements.”

O crowd! How can the colored body know emptiness and non-emptiness, know form and non-form, recognize the law of no-emptiness, penetrate without obstruction, enter the myriad wondrous gates? Therefore, I first explain the scripture’s subtle truth: to protect the wisdom-life of the masses. The great ancestor’s compassion fears that disciples mistake the colored body for the true body, but one must not be trapped in neither no-ness nor non-no-ness, neither form nor non-form, neither being nor non-being, neither emptiness nor non-emptiness. Being yoked and manipulated by this blood-and-flesh illusory colored body, you are made restless without rest, confused about the true lineage, losing the treasure of wisdom. Therefore, this scripture urges each disciple to protect the spiritual root, to nurture the primal origin. When the root is firm, the Way is born. The gentleman delights in Heaven, thus preserves life; premature death and longevity are not two, that is extending life. The gentleman serves Heaven, thus wisdom-life endures; therefore, birth after birth without ceasing, transforming and circulating, realizing the adamantine indestructible body, accomplishing the true, eternal, non-leaking dharma body.

O crowd, the scriptures of the Three Caverns and Four Palaces, five thousand three hundred true texts, all point to extending life and preserving life, only then can one emerge from kalpa and transcend dust. Clinging to form is not preserving life; true emptiness is extending life. Wisdom nature does not separate from wisdom life; wisdom light is the wisdom lamp. If you want wisdom light to shine always, wisdom life must surely endure. Enduring always does not leave stillness; the lamp’s light naturally remains bright. Realizing the true thus the lamp always shines, illuminating oneself and skillfully saving all beings. The light truly has no visible light; the brightness truly is not brightness to name. It is only originally present in life; wisdom opens and borrows the name of light. Form and emptiness, the world of birth and death; emptiness and form preserve life and extend longevity. Extending life is transcending beyond kalpa; beyond kalpa, what death or name is there? Beings only because of confused wisdom, birth after birth, kalpa after kalpa, drift and sink. The wisdom lamp and wisdom light shine everywhere; you all quickly awaken to the causes of precepts. Try to grasp the wondrous method of preservation and extension; in still emptiness, I point it out to you all.

Disciples, disciples! The scripture says: “When used but unseen, then life can be preserved; when seen but unused, then life can be extended. Only by extinguishing the moving mind, not extinguishing the illuminating mind, can life be extended. Only by extinguishing the abiding mind, and condensing the empty mind, can life be preserved. If life can be extended, wisdom life is unbroken, and the great medicine is perfected; if life can be preserved, no birth can be realized, and the great elixir is accomplished.” “Only life is not constant; if the Way is good, it is attained; if not good, it is lost.” “Receiving life from Heaven, attending to Heaven’s clear life; though the state is old, its life is new.” All these are the true principles of preservation and extension—this is called the great Way of establishing life.

Disciples, if you can awaken to this point and fully grasp this subtlety, I will not withhold the supreme treasure, but pour out all my store, revealing the profound mystery. There is a four-line verse; all, carefully ponder it:

“Life short or life long is originally fate;  
Born and dying, fundamentally no birth.  
To extend and preserve, no need seek great methods;  
The Way returns to no-Way, the King City of Dharma.”
