# Sixteen: Expounding the Grand Dao of the Revealed Teaching

Disciples, yesterday the venerable master spoke of the dao, saying: Though the dao’s essence is non-action, and the dharma body is the ultimate reality, one must understand that the essence of the dao does not depart from the ordinary form; the dharma body dwells within the colored body. The colored body is firm and solid—that is the outer aspect adorned by the merit of conditioned existence; the dharma body is clear and tranquil—that is the inner aspect adorned by the merit of non-action. When both inner and outer are pure and clear, and one has awakened to both, then spirit and brightness are liberated: the unsurpassed, supreme, indestructible true void shines forth, vast radiance, great perfection, none can overcome it. All myriad spirits pay homage, wielding thunderbolts as their servants; the Three Realms stand guarded; the Five Emperors oversee the welcoming. The cavernous wisdom flows through and through, fully comprehended. Yet this is not something cultivated by merit of conditioned action.

Disciples, if one firmly refines essence and nourishes qi, then qi dwells and essence condenses. When the fire of breath ceases and the wind returns, essence transforms into qi, steaming the Four Great Elements, harmonizing the myriad spirits. True fire without smoke means qi is pure; spirit water without leakage means spirit is still. When qi is pure, it transforms spirit; when spirit is still, it merges with emptiness. At the utmost emptiness and profound stillness, primordial truth revives; the nine returns and seven reversions occur, life returns to root. Returning to root means life is established and true nature preserved. When true nature is preserved, the essence of the dao manifests. When the essence of the dao manifests, the dharma body appears.

Disciples, here lies the dao essence cultivated from within the realm of conditioned action, and the dharma body cultivated from within the realm of non-action. The colored body has lifespan; the dharma body has wisdom-life. Lifespan depends on Heaven, not on oneself; thus the colored body undergoes reincarnation, birth and death, cycles of kalpas. Wisdom-life depends on self, not on Heaven; thus the dharma body wields authority freely, liberated and unobstructed. Disciples, the lifespan of the colored body is limited, fixed by destiny, hard to escape; when Heaven wills death, death is unavoidable. The wisdom-life of the dharma body is boundless, its spiritual powers vast, eternally realizing birthlessness—only then is long life attained.

Disciples, even if the colored body lingers ten thousand years, it is but a demon, not the dao. The dharma body comes and goes constantly; to hear the dao in the morning and die at dusk—this is the true word of the utmost sage. The dharma body dies but does not perish, hence it is called longevity. The colored body dies and dies again, hence it is impermanent. If disciples awaken to the dharma body, then even those short-lived and impermanent can all become long-lived. If one clings to the colored body as form, then even those of immeasurable longevity fall into the cycle of reincarnation.

The essential secret in one phrase: see through the colored body, all worries vanish; with true sincerity, refine diligently, remaining unstained by a single speck of dust. Do not let the dharma body be trapped by the colored body; only see through the colored body and let the dharma body be liberated. Is this not the great turning of the dharma wheel, the flourishing and movement of the dao? What I now teach is the grand expounding of filial piety and the vast dao, all relying on the constant turning of the dharma wheel. To restore the ancestral dao’s radiant brilliance, if one does not point out the dharma body to living beings, who will protect and cover it? It is said: if the teaching is not grand, the dao is not clear; if the dao is not clear, the dharma cannot be practiced; if the dharma cannot be practiced, the dao cannot be grand.

The utmost sage said: “If a person can magnify the dao, it is not the dao magnifying the person.” You only need each to recognize the person who magnifies the dao, practice the dharma of that grand dao, and speak forth the mechanism of clear dao—why fear the dao lineage not flourishing, or the ancestral spirit declining?

When I was young, I studied little; my books were not widely read, nor did I understand Confucianism or Buddhism. Dumbly I sought the dao, wandering within its realm for decades, striving to exhaust the source. What I sought was to seek my own innate knowledge; what I asked was only about the original wisdom-nature. After long inner seeking, innate knowledge alone revealed itself at the cinnabar field; after deep inner inquiry, wisdom-nature shone white in the empty chamber. When the inner master is present, why fear receiving guests? When the inner true ancestor dwells, one desires to expound the teaching and grand dao.

Disciples, I am not skilled in letters, and ashamed before the three caverns’ jade script. I read few alchemical scriptures, and have no access to the true immortal’s treasured secrets. Because my nature loves laziness, cherishes leisure and quiet, I often contemplate wisdom-life, delving into mystery and obscurity, casting aside all affairs, embracing true primordial essence. Where is the time to read Confucian books or alchemical scriptures? Thus, until now, I cannot write well, my speech is clumsy and dull. I only roughly and plainly speak some unrevealed secret words of the utmost great true word, for you to hear. Yet the dao itself is wordless—why must one speak dharma? The scriptures originally require no learning—why open halls? The teaching is still non-action—why trouble oneself with many affairs? This dao, everyone has a share; not a moment can one depart from it. Whether bound to the mundane or to the dao, one may awaken and seek; why must one renounce the world, become a recluse, seek masters and friends? Only because of this matter of birth and death, the heart does not understand, so one hungers and searches, hastening east and west, to the ends of the earth, seeking the method to return life to root.

Fortunately, there are the Jade Pure, Supreme Pure, and Grand Pure, who bestow scriptures, speak dharma, establish teachings, open altars, expound and transmit the lineage, passing down to this day. Among the Confucian gates, there are Zhouzi, the Two Chengs, Zhangzi, Zhizi, who received the secret of the sacred scriptures, revealing the essentials of mind-dharma. Then there are the Diamond Sutra, the Surangama Sutra, the Heart Sutra—these are the true meanings of the Buddha’s teaching, the profound mysteries of quieting body and freeing desire. The three teachings share one path of nature and life, all embodying compassion to save beings from suffering, the heart-dharma of salvation.

Now there is me, who humbly stands beneath the venerable Qiu Patriarch’s gate from the Yuan dynasty, following precedent to propagate the dharma treasure, receiving the transmission to expound and promote it. Disciples, I am but a mere mortal, lacking spiritual powers, knowing only the ordinary daily practice. Teaching awakening is merely for those who hold and observe the precepts within the dao gate. Not like those who sell formulas for alms, idle and lazy, eating for free and clothing themselves with empty hands—how could they understand birth and death?

Therefore I only rouse my own spirit, for the plan of universal salvation. Above, to promote teaching and appearance; below, to benefit the masses. It is all for living beings, not for myself.

Our Dragon Gate lineage began with Patriarch Qiu of the Yuan dynasty, flourishing in mystery and expounding transformation. For four hundred years, sages are rare, resolute ones hard to meet. Now, at the end of the dao, I have kept precepts for thirty years, abiding by rules and regulations, seeking truth through inquiry. Heaven follows my will; I met masters at Wangwu; received dharma at the Nine Palaces; for over twenty years, Heaven opened the dao’s movement. Joyfully I encountered the imperial court, met a flourishing age; gentry and officials love goodness; scholars and merchants delight in charity; comrades with affinity take refuge and cultivate in time. Because I am in the capital, I opened an altar and established precepts. Through eight seasons of cold and heat, winds stirred a thousand true ones; those of mundane and immortal affinity all took refuge in precepts and concentration, entering directly into the clear void and wondrous dao.

I rely only on this one spark of spiritual opportunity, sincerely and silently moving, touching Heaven’s grace, attaining true encounter, presumptuously ascending the dharma seat, foolishly acting as the dharma master alone. As for the great expounding of the mysterious gate, the universal grand dao hall, this is my utmost simple wish. Disciples, do not believe those suspicious, slanderous, sinful words—those who die clinging to meditation cushions, clenching teeth and closing throats, feigning dao appearance, only deceive themselves in time. If such people speak, they should always respond with stillness. Respond to what? When they cannot even care for their own life, how can they care for others’ lives?

You must listen well: “The precepts and scriptures come from the Daozang; transmission of precepts according to the rules is no falsehood. Only because the revealed teaching saves living beings, I wish you lost disciples cease slander. I urge fellow travelers to open your minds, endure humiliation, cultivate truth, and magnify the teaching’s appearance. Cultivate both concentration and wisdom, deepen blessings and virtue, universally save living beings from the ocean of suffering. Those who receive precepts first sever obstacles; when obstacles are removed, light shines bright. Why fear little radiance of wisdom-nature? Only worry about radiance ten thousand fathoms long. Conceal the flame to protect life; wisdom then endures long. Do not cling to prolonging life or leave illusion’s form. Embrace purity, nourish simplicity, learn non-action; wisdom-life lengthens and returns vast. If you cling to the colored body, not knowing who is long-lived after death, unwilling to save others but only self—how can immortal masters save us? Ready clothes, free meals, who prepares one mouth and one body? Mountain Qiu and Face Mountain cannot be consumed; a drop of water in a great flood cries out in hell. Fooling people to offer and seek ease, warm clothes and full meals yet no thirst. Clever words and flowery speech, the dao is already formed; flying ascent saves you, carrying you along. Outer protectors hear and offer more diligently, foolishly hoping for gold in water. How many mortals can awaken by themselves? Who, in which year and month, will ascend? Those who awaken in wisdom have no jealousy; stillness means non-action, first saving self. When moving, magnify the dao to save fellow beings. Ten thousand words, a thousand sayings—all is one awakening. One awakening leads to universal salvation; universal salvation requires a sincere, firm heart. The dao is grand, teaching is vast, ancestral spirit rises; liberation is true void, heart and nature harmonize.”
