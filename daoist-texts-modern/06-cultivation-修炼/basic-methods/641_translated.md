# Seventeen: Delivering and Saving Life

Disciples, the grand dao I expound in the orthodox teaching is neither for myself alone, nor merely for instruction. It is solely to embody the dao, uphold the law of Heaven, and deliver and save all sentient beings. In times past, the sages of the Three Teachings—if not for the sake of all beings—how could they have established teachings, transmitted scriptures, proclaimed the altar, revealed the truth, and patiently offered expedients with utmost compassion?

Disciples, the Confucian school is that of the Most Sacred Former Teacher. Its virtue partakes in the Great Ultimate; its dao gathers the great accomplishment. Neither rigid nor absolute, neither self nor other; it edits the classics, sets the music, praises the Book of Changes, and holds fast to rites. Everywhere it carries out the transformation of the Spring and Autumn Annals; squarely it expounds the classic of filial piety and righteousness. The dao was passed down from Zengzi and Mencius, shouldering a heavy burden; they became the teachers of Confucianism for ten thousand generations, the instructing lords of the living people. Without Zengzi receiving transmission in the Zhou dynasty, without Cheng and Zhu elucidating and guarding it in the Song, how could it be as it is today?

The Buddhist school comes from the West, from the Buddha Shakyamuni, who endured austere practice in snowy mountains, renounced kingdom and family, subdued body and mind, perfected his merit and fulfilled his conduct; the five aggregates are all empty, the six roots serene and pure; manifesting wondrous marks, he transformed and appeared in the Ten Directions. In the Han under Emperor Ming, a golden man appeared in a dream, a white horse came from the West, transmitting five thousand and forty-eight volumes, the Diamond Prajñā True Scripture; the teaching spread among Eastern scholars, the title "Thus Come One" was given, the dharma passed through six patriarchs, venerating the Brahma monastery and golden immortals, the supreme compassion of the Great Vehicle. If not for our Buddha transmitting the scriptures, how could today all revere the golden-bodied Arhats?

The Dao is established by the Three Pure Ones, lofty and difficult to name, majestic and unfathomable. The scriptures are wondrous and secret, passed down saint to saint. Manifesting in the flesh to expound the dharma, enduring kalpas to polish the mind. Delivering beings from the sea of suffering, saving the world through successive dynasties. It is the Three Officials who transmit, the Five Extremes who open the altar. Pure Yang Lüzu presides as master of the Three Teachings, commanding the Five Thunders’ decrees; squarely manifesting traces, opening mysteries without end; great compassion and great mercy, great benevolence and great filial piety—forgetting fame and fortune, leaving behind incense offerings. Passing down to our Qiu ancestor, diligent in the dao and preserving benevolence, bowing to the alchemical scriptures at the Phoenix Gate; founding the lineage and transmitting precepts, reviving pure discipline at Dragon Gate. Through a thousand hardships and ten thousand pains, vowing to deliver beings. Honored as the Venerable True Lord of Eternal Spring, repeatedly exalted as the Illustrious Respondent Heavenly Venerable. Illuminating all dharma realms, equally sharing vast grace. Performing merit and establishing virtue, manifesting myriad spiritual powers—all for the sake of delivering beings, together attaining the great dao.

Disciples, to deliver and save, one must be earnest and intense—first deliver oneself, then deliver others. Nowadays, the teaching’s appearance does not flourish; the mysterious and secluded sects precisely suffer from not having removed this great sickness. Why does the great dao not flourish, why is the teaching pitiful and thin? Disciples, it is because the orthodox Quanzhen school’s fatal flaw is “cannot deliver oneself, only wants to deliver others”—these eight characters are the root of great sin, the case that ruins Quanzhen’s entire teaching appearance. Disciples, if you expound the orthodox teaching but cannot follow it yourself, yet first urge others to follow it, who would believe and submit? How can it be said Quanzhen cannot deliver itself? Disciples, those who deliver beings deliver the beings within themselves. What are these beings within oneself? Disciples, the myriad distracting thoughts and delusions are the beings within one’s own original mind. Within Quanzhen’s belly are eighty-four thousand delusions and distractions—that is eighty-four thousand beings. Within a single day, within the twenty-four hours, sitting on the meditation cushion, the mind roams the world; just as one delusion ceases, another arises. The seven emotions never cease, the six desires linger; the three poisons entangle, the eight consciousnesses turn upside down. Like floating clouds obscuring the sun, drifting east and west; wild waves driven by the wind, rushing westward and swaying eastward. From dawn to dusk, when is there ever a moment of stillness? Through months and years, unable to settle a single thought. Not only when sitting on the cushion, but even when walking the roads, and in dreams—at what moment can one cast aside delusions and hold right mindfulness? If the mind does not rest, the body cannot be delivered; if the thoughts are not unified, the dao cannot be clear. Therefore, within the Quanzhen gate, one must stop thoughts and rest the mind to allow the heavenly mind to appear, the light of wisdom to shine forth. Fellow practitioners, if Quanzhen is like this, then it can be called comrades indeed. Thus it is said: first deliver oneself, then it is not late to go deliver and transform others.

How then to deliver oneself? With resoluteness, courage, diligence, renunciation, generosity, clarity, humility, liberation, and naturalness. Disciples, you must use undivided will, concentrate spirit, and clear your thoughts. Those comrades who have the affinity, listen wholeheartedly to me as I point out these nine essentials of the dao one by one.

Ah, what is resoluteness? This worldly and otherworldly law are fundamentally opposed, their directions contrary, their forms incompatible. To practice the otherworldly law in the dharma body, one must first see as false the illusions of the world and the fantasies of the physical body—children, spouse, kin, and affections must be severed; fame and wealth, delicious food and fine horses, lingering attachments and vines—all must be jumped beyond, the will cleansed and not floating; this is called resoluteness. It is also called the demon-subduing pestle, or the demon-slaying platform.

What is courage? Hesitation and indecision, wandering thoughts coming and going; the handle slips away, light opens or is obscured. The mind is unlike the autumn moon, always bright and clear; the spirit does not ascend the morning glow, yet shines brilliantly in reflection. Delay and slackness, chasing waves and following currents; neglect and idleness, changing like morning and evening. Unable to attain a single day of open chest and clear vision; unable to see clearly with eyes set firmly on the ground. Add effort to the mind, cast away body and world; in the dao, endure hardship, crush evil demons. This fleeting, swift matter of life and death, confused and unexamined—penetrate iron walls and bronze barriers, realize this is heaven and hell. Disciples, after resoluteness, one must add courage.

What is diligence? Resoluteness cuts off enmity and affection, cultivates the mind and establishes destiny. Courage subdues scattering and disorder, arranges and searches wandering, calms the spirit. What is further diligence? The scholar contemplates life and death: before this body existed, where were you? After this body perishes, where do you go? The world, Heaven, Earth, and all things, daily and ordinary, are all the dao. What the eye sees, what the ear hears, nothing is outside the dao; nothing can escape the dao. Things have beginnings and ends—that is the birth and death of things; affairs have starts and finishes—that is the birth and death of affairs. If one uses the mind to contemplate, with bitter resolve and careful searching, one can understand the beginnings and ends of things, thus understand the birth and death of the body; understand the ends and beginnings of affairs, thus understand the arising and ceasing of the mind. From things, carefully attend and truly comprehend; from one thing to myriad things, from one affair to myriad affairs, all reveal the mechanism of birth and death, the principle of arising and ceasing. Then beginnings and ends, birth and death, arising and ceasing, all become a continuous practice; only then can one approach the dao. Then, with obscured mind, pursue the great dao subtly and finely; penetrate the hidden and secret, understand the mysterious mechanism; silently recognize the heavenly mind, closely connect with the essence; enabling this one point of empty spirit to remain unclouded, advancing through source and flow, responding to myriad things without confusion, understanding myriad affairs without doubt. If one is unwilling to be diligent, lax and negligent, that is self-destruction and abandonment, gladly becoming a lowly ghost with no true aspiration to cultivate. Even if sitting cross-legged for a hundred years, extending life a thousand times, in the end impermanence returns, still falling into the cycle of rebirth.

What is renunciation? It is to abandon former coarseness, eliminate all side doors and heterodox paths, and from now on walk a new path, sincerely aspiring upward. This one point of empty spirit, unclouded true lineage, is the primordial treasure, ever-changing and transforming, without fixed form. Touching things and encountering affairs, using different methods, responding variously. Every moment sees shadows, every instant loses track. Following wondrous spiritual mechanisms, layer upon layer penetrating deeper, ever more difficult to exhaust the profound. The more one moves, the more emerges; taking endlessly, using without ceasing. The enlightened gain it, the unenlightened remain distant. I fear that if you grasp even a fraction of the principle, then cling to it and refuse to abandon it for another insight, that is impermanence indeed. One must turn the unchanging, immutable spiritual mechanism to transform the impermanent, changing phenomena; then principle becomes clear, nature is revealed; abandoning the old and taking the new, layer by layer penetrating to the highest peak. Without reaching an independent and outstanding state, how can one fathom deep mechanisms, illuminate life and death, transcend the world, and escape the root of doubt through kalpas?

What is generosity? Like yesterday’s awakening, former wondrous principle—what is realized and obtained may be given to beings, or stored in millet and rice, not to be hoarded, not to confuse my spirit platform. The so-called past mind cannot be grasped, future mind cannot be grasped, even this present mind cannot be grasped. Within this ungraspable, seeking a self-attained subtlety, then the light of wisdom is complete. Giving wealth is called cultivating blessing; giving dharma is called cultivating wisdom. Giving wealth has a limit; my giving of dharma is boundless. Giving wealth can aid people in worldly affairs, nourish the physical body’s clothing and food, adorn the outward appearance. When wealth is exhausted, one remains bare-handed. My giving of dharma can be practiced in worldly law and transcendental law. Moreover, giving dharma can open people’s confused orifices, elevate spiritual roots. Yet giving wealth is not the worldly wealth of this world. Ordinary people nourish life and save others, aid the urgent and support the endangered, repel disasters and guard against calamities, bless the country and strengthen the people, in movement and stillness, water and fire, dispel disasters and resolve hardships, variously acting as Heaven’s emissary, commanding yin and yang, penetrating Heaven and Earth—this wealth is the true treasure, the child talent of the Southern Ocean Bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara. Ah, you know, to seek heavenly treasures, one must use worldly wealth. This worldly wealth is not the mundane wealth of the world; this wealth is the dharma wealth of self-delivering others, called the divine treasure, thus able to evoke heavenly treasures. Daily use is called giving dharma. Whoever can realize this is a sage of primordial wisdom from countless kalpas ago.

What is clarity? Having given wondrous dharma and delivered beings, one must see true clarity, true wisdom, truly penetrating. Heaven and Earth, myriad things, all possess this spiritual nature. If I treat dharma as dharma, that is clinging to dharma. Clinging to dharma as dharma is dead dharma, not called living dharma; that is lack of high clarity. Therefore, if I take the dharma I use to teach others, the fixed principles to respond to things, that is dead dharma and dull mechanism—like driving nails into a tree or shaking an oar, gluing pillars and drumming a zither. One must not regard my dharma as right and others’ as wrong; be upright and bright, open guidance as occasion demands, move according to conditions, and proclaim flexibly. If delivering the perfect and complete, one cannot turn or rotate; delivering the foolish with wisdom is not fitting. One must discern the foolish and speak their dharma, so the foolish understand clearly and can practice accordingly, slowly coming to realization. If one speaks foolish dharma to the wise, that too is not fitting. One must understand both self and others, elegant and vulgar both partake, round and harmonious, lively and flexible; the wise see it as wisdom, the benevolent see it as benevolence. Blockages can be cleared, doubts settled; the doubtful are resolved, the dull become sharp, the deaf hear, the blind see—only then is one truly clear and capable to lead in delivering and giving.

What is humility? When true cultivation reaches this, encountering those with clear eyes, great wisdom and empty heart, all external things and worldly affairs are utterly empty. Shaking the heavenly gates above, rocking the Earth’s axis below; transcending the human world, the spirit enters the void. Where then is any being before one’s face? From ancient times until now, the two vehicles’ Bodhisattvas, the lower vehicle immortals, all suffer from this illness. The sickness reaches the highest point, yet they remain unaware. Hence called the inferior root of the lesser vehicle, side-door heterodox teachings, evil paths and demonic magic. If so, they do not understand the formless, unfathomable spirit transformation—how could you limited beings grasp or hold it? How can finite things arrogantly claim themselves? Have you not heard the Most High dare not lead the world? Not seeking blessings first, not boasting of his merit, not showing off his dao. Advancing by taking retreat as principle, towering by making humility the foundation. Putting the self last yet the self remains; placing the self behind yet the self leads. All contend to go first, I alone retreat behind. The highest virtue is non-virtue; the superior person does not contend. Seeing me not, not arrogant, not self-exalting, not self-asserting. Giving to others, oneself gains more; benefiting others, oneself is enriched. I do not know its name, forcibly called the dao. So the higher one reaches clarity, the more one practices humility and retreat. Humble and gentle to preserve the great dao; one part widely practices compassion and wisdom, another part preserves and stores radiance. The nation’s sharp weapons are not shown to others; I do not seek to subdue others, yet others naturally submit to me. At this point, the principle of liberation cannot be unknown.

What is liberation? Disciples, those who cling do not understand dao and virtue. Free and unbound, not entangled by dharma; bare and naked, not burdened by things. Round and complete, teaching according to conditions; shining brightly, delivering beings through kalpas. Entering the myriad wondrous gates, the mother of all beings. Compassion can love things, yet does not regard loving things as compassion; goodness can aid beings, yet does not regard aiding beings as goodness. Wondrous dharma can deliver beings, yet does not regard delivering beings as wondrous dharma; the supreme dao can transcend the world, yet does not regard transcendence as the supreme dao. Able to both escape suffering and endure suffering. Above, transcending Heaven, yet does not regard the heavenly palace as a place of joy; below, universally saving hell, yet does not regard hell as a place of suffering. Encountering suffering, one saves beings from suffering; encountering joy, one rejoices with all beings. In joy, one can point out beings’ suffering; in distress, one can reveal beings’ joy. In Heaven, one delivers heavenly dragons, ghosts, and spirits, enabling them to hear true awakening and transcend to immortal功. On Earth, one delivers sinful departed souls, enabling the shades to see light and be reborn in the human realm. In the human world, one delivers all good men and faithful women, universally cultivating daily ordinary practice—non-action, uprightness, loyalty, faith, fairness, and goodness of the great dao. Not leading scholars, farmers, artisans, and merchants into lower vehicle small dharmas, playing with spirits, falling into demonic evil realms, or warring in the realm of asuras. Within this liberation, one must attain natural function—that is the dao of freedom.

What is naturalness? Disciples, this wondrous naturalness is as the Heart Sutra says: Avalokiteśvara Bodhisattva, the one who observes freely, is Avalokiteśvara, who observes the sounds of the world. To attain the wondrous naturalness is to be self-free Avalokiteśvara. That is the Bodhisattva upon my mind, Avalokiteśvara of the Southern Sea. It is to observe the wondrous marks of the other shore’s pure still true emptiness, the principle of void and naturalness. Able to observe the wondrous marks of true sound. Without a true teacher pointing it out, can one realize the wondrous marks of true emptiness? Ah, disciples! Form is emptiness, emptiness is form; not empty, not form, the dao is not true. True emptiness and wondrous marks, true constant dao; not empty, not form, wondrous and boundless. One with the void of space, void and it have no division or self. Entering metal and stone without obstruction, entering water and fire without injury. Disciples, carefully contemplate the nine essentials of the dao, firmly guard the thin pellet, realize the wondrous marks, one rule of naturalness. The Three Families have already verified it, perfectly delivering beings, merit vast beyond measure, virtue subduing ghosts and spirits, evil demons bound hand and foot, monsters and spirits cast down—what fear is there that the world will not believe and return their karma? It is precisely the universal merit of delivering and benefiting, diligently contemplating delivering oneself, the later Heaven and human. One sincere aspiration to the true constant dao, naturally Bodhisattvas protect my path. The nine chapters of wondrous canon transcend the dusty world, a piece of perfect truth carved deeply. Giving subtle words of true wondrous principle, practicing both nature and life without sparing hardship. Seeing clearly and wisely, speaking many dharmas; benevolent, gentle, humble, not boasting of ability. Renouncing outward forms, forgetting you and me; true thusness, heavenly mind, great dao in practice. Free and unbound liberation expounds profound mystery, supreme true emptiness, mysterious mysterious dao. Small fire harms not the three surnames united;功 perfected,行 fulfilled, stepping on clouds to the heavens.
