# Eighteen: The Radiance of Wisdom

Disciples, you have received the three hundred great precepts of the Central Pole, practicing secret conduct and subtle demeanor—yet these cannot compare to the primal precepts of the Former True. These rules are delicate and profound; their essence lies solely in diligent effort upon your own heart-mind. Whenever a thought or impulse arises, you must hold sincerity as master and reverence as lord, quietly examining, reflecting, and uplifting with great uprightness and rectitude. Sweep these thoughts from your heart until it is pure and spotless—like the clear sky and bright moon, without a trace of cloud or shadow; like crystal and glaze, without the slightest flaw or blemish; like a boundless bright mirror, without a speck of dust or stain; like a luminous pearl in the night, without a hint of confusion or darkness. Only when it is perfectly round, steady, and brilliantly radiant can one speak of the dao.

Wisdom’s radiance—the wondrous aspect of true emptiness—arises originally from precepts and meditation. By enduring insult and cutting through obstacles, with strict and refined discipline, self-restraint, and rigorous forging, aided by the medicine of the dharma, one can reach this state. Yet among those who hold precepts, few can truly maintain them; their practice is neither subtle nor strict, deceiving themselves and others, utterly unable to cease their faults. Why so? Ah, disciples, careless practice is called the cause of defilement—how then can one attain the fruit of non-action?

The phrase “wisdom’s radiance” is a supreme treasure for those of keen root. For those of inferior root, it cannot be comprehended. One need only focus the will without distraction, condense the spirit into the energy centers, cultivate the ancestral breath, nurture the primordial nature, reach the utmost void, guard the steadfast stillness, be pure and undivided, with spirit concealed without limit, culminating in the Great Ultimate—then naturally wisdom’s light arises. With the return of yang, one finally sees one’s original face. To know the moods of ghosts and spirits, to penetrate the pivot of creation and transformation, this is called wisdom; to participate in the transformations of Heaven and Earth, to share the alternations of sun and moon, to move with the intricate dance of the four seasons, this is called insight; to universally manifest the dharma body, to encompass the dharma realm, never departing from the illumination of awareness, all returning to the bright center, this is called radiance; to connect with all things without form, to see all affairs before their signs appear, to traverse the void without trace, to surpass sun and moon without shadow, this is called clarity.

If one’s precepts are not precise and refined, one cannot be serene and settled. Without serenity and settlement, wisdom does not arise. Without wisdom, radiance does not manifest. The single scroll of the *Jade Pivot Precious Scripture* speaks solely of original nature, directly pointing to the human heart; the truth of nature shines clearly, the heavenly secrets fully revealed, enabling sentient beings to turn the wheel and awaken to the dao. Alas, many are lost, few awaken. They recite the words with their mouths but cannot hold them in their hearts; though sincere in heart, their strength cannot transform. What a pity to betray the sacred heart and merely point to the dharma treasures in vain. Now I must, on behalf of the scripture, proclaim the marvelous, point to the true pivot, so that you disciples may suddenly awaken. Each of you, with reverence and wholehearted attention, listen carefully.

The scripture says: “Long ago, before fifteen kalpas, my heart encountered this dao and I attained the position of the Supreme True; my intention brewed this accomplishment and I wielded great transformation.” It also says: “With a pure and tranquil heart, I vow vast aspirations; with the power of wisdom, I subdue all demons.” Again: “You, heavens and humans, desire to hear the supreme dao. The supreme dao is deep and unfathomable, not found elsewhere. Since you desire to hear, it is the without-interval. Without interval and without seeing, that is the true dao. Hearing and seeing then vanish, only you remain. You are not yet existence itself—how much less the dao? To hear without hearing, what dao can be spoken of?” Further: “The dao is entered by sincerity, guarded by silence, employed with softness. Using sincerity seems foolish, using silence seems slow, using softness seems clumsy. Thus one can forget form, forget self, forget forgetting. Those who enter the dao know stopping; those who guard the dao know caution; those who use the dao know subtlety. Knowing subtlety, wisdom’s light arises; knowing caution, sacred wisdom is complete; knowing stopping, one is serene and settled. Serene and settled, sacred wisdom is complete; sacred wisdom complete, wisdom’s light arises; wisdom’s light arises, one is one with the dao. This is called true forgetting. Only by forgetting without forgetting—forgetting what cannot be forgotten—is the supreme dao. The dao dwells in Heaven and Earth, yet Heaven and Earth do not know it; with feeling and without feeling, it is one and not two.” Again: “Those who attain awakening ascend to the immortal throne.” Again: “The foolish can become wise, the turbid can become clear, only by fate’s decree. The foolish are dim and muddled, the turbid are dark and obscure, yet these are the gifts of wind and earth. Heaven and Earth divine their mechanism, making humans unaware—this is called nature. To know one’s ignorance is also called nature. The subtlety of nature, though wondrous to knowledge, is wondrous because of ignorance. Yet in the dao, there has never been foolishness or turbidity.” Again: “Those who receive this teaching, the supreme person who accepts the scripture, must all dig up gold and place coins, swearing by Heaven to transmit it.”

Disciples, this is the true profound secret within the *Jade Pivot Scripture*, the unsurpassable and inconceivable, the supreme and subtle treasure of pure tranquility and liberation. You only know to recite the scripture all day, but do not understand its wondrous meaning. If, when you recite it, you realize the secret within, then sacred wisdom is complete and wisdom’s light arises. The supreme dao spoken of is deep and mysterious, beyond seeing and hearing. Were it not for the Heavenly Venerable who, fifteen hundred kalpas ago, opened the pure and tranquil heart and made vast vows to save all sentient beings so that all might attain the utmost marvel—then spoke again of the original void and nothingness, of no sound to hear and no color to see. Since there is no sound to hear, one must forget the ears; since there is no form or color to see, one must forget the eyes. When ears and eyes are forgotten, hearing and seeing also vanish. Thus ears and eyes have form and color, leading the six roots; hearing and seeing grasp appearances and thoughts, the very source of the six roots. How can this accord with the dao? If one can purify the six appearances and sweep away the six consciousnesses, then one does not hear with the ears but hears with the heart; does not see with the eyes but sees with the spirit. Thus one hears without hearing, sees without seeing. Without hearing and seeing, this accords with the dao.

The *Ancient Scripture of the Red Text Cave* says: “Forget the eyes and light overflows without limit; forget the ears and the heart’s consciousness is ever deep. When both mechanisms are forgotten, one enters the myriad wondrous gates. Seeing without seeing me, hearing without hearing sound, departing all boundaries—that is called the wondrous dao.” The *Southern Flower Scripture* says: “Qi stops at the ears, the heart stops at the talisman.” Therefore the *Jade Pivot Scripture* says: “Forget form and forget self—this is the gateway to the dao. Enter with sincerity—this word sincerity is precept. Guard with silence—this word silence is holding precepts and subduing body and mind. Using silence seems slow—this is entering samadhi, forgetting ears and eyes. Using softness seems clumsy—this is wisdom concealed within secrecy.” It also says: “If you seek within your own colored body for hearing and seeing, you will never find it; it cannot be seen or heard.” The *Diamond Sutra* says: “Those who seek me by form and sound walk the wrong path and cannot see the Tathāgata.”

Those who desire to enter the dao must receive precepts and enter samadhi, diligently cultivating wisdom, dispelling delusion with clarity, and hearing without hearing, seeing without seeing. Thus, those who enter the dao know stopping—this is the effort of holding precepts and halting thought; know caution—this is the effort of careful solitude and earnest progress; know subtlety—this is the effort of transcending sages and abandoning intellect. Halting thought cannot be without precepts; careful solitude cannot be without samadhi; knowing subtlety cannot be without wisdom. Truly holding precepts, entering samadhi, and cultivating wisdom brings body and mind to serene settlement; sacred wisdom becomes pure and complete; wisdom’s light shines universally. When wisdom’s light shines through, one is one with the dao—this is called true forgetting. This true forgetting is not the dull emptiness of sitting in stubborn void; it is true emptiness. Within this true emptiness dwells the wondrous aspect of purple-gold—an exquisite fruit of non-emptiness within emptiness. Able not to fall into dull emptiness, non-emptiness within emptiness, the wondrous essence naturally reveals itself. Only by forgetting what cannot be forgotten is the supreme wondrous dao attained.

It is also said: Foolishness and wisdom differ, thus clarity and turbidity vary. Though both are bound to the gifts of wind and earth, all are mechanisms of creation and transformation, the divine workings of nature, the principles of fate already fixed. Yet the foolish remain foolish, the wise remain wise—how can Heaven and Earth compensate for foolish wisdom? Only by arousing a pure and tranquil heart and establishing vast vows—vows to leave the world and save others—must one hear the dao and thereby save oneself. Self-saving means taking refuge in the Three Treasures, receiving precepts, entering samadhi, cultivating wisdom to radiate light—then the foolish become wise, the turbid become clear. If one cannot hold precepts and enter samadhi, wisdom will not flow, no light will shine; thus clarity may become turbidity, wisdom may become foolishness. The *Diamond Sutra* says: “The dharma I speak has no fixed form.” This is what it means.

The wisdom and radiance spoken of are dazzling, supremely profound, illuminating the dharma realm—how could this be outside the *Jade Pivot Precious Scripture*? The Jade Pivot is the true pivot. Those who wish to turn the scripture must first turn the true pivot, diligently cultivating merit and wisdom. Only fearing that the radiance remains hidden, unable to open or be seen. How then can one discern the forms of ghosts and spirits, grasp the pivot of creation, participate in the transformations of Heaven and Earth, govern the movements of sun and moon, encompass the dharma realm within a grain of millet, determine affairs at their faintest beginnings, be called master of the wondrous dao, and advance to the realm of celestial immortals? Truly it is: “Seeing the hidden radiance, able to hear the root of the supreme dao. Without cultivating precepts and samadhi, how can wisdom’s light be deep? Clinging to appearances is not the true appearance; forgetting hearing is the beginning of hearing. Hearing, thinking, and cultivation enter the wondrous, like the free sound of ocean tides.”
