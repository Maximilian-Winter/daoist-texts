# Nineteen: The Marvelous Function of Spiritual Powers

Gentlemen, the path of luminous wisdom spoken of above — the *Jade Pivot Scripture* merely uses hearing and seeing as its fading traces. When there is neither hearing nor seeing, then the marvelous function is fully spoken, and the spiritual powers manifest in their fullness. Gentlemen, the *Scripture of the Hidden Talisman* says: “The deaf see with their eyes; the blind see with their ears.” The ancient immortals say: “In stillness, one hears no thunder; in deep gaze, one sees no Mount Tai.” The *Doctrine of the Mean* states: “The virtue of ghosts and spirits is at its height! Seen but unseen, heard but unheard.” The *Southern Flower Scripture* says: “Without seeing or hearing, embrace the spirit in stillness.” The *Kinship of the Three* teaches: “The three treasures of ear, eye, and mouth—close and block them, do not let them open; the true person sinks deep into the abyss, floating and wandering while guarding the rule.” Among all the scriptures, the marvelous words are countless and cannot be fully told. The Great Bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara, through hearing, reflection, and cultivation, enters samādhi.

Now, the ear’s root is the orifice through which essence leaks—not the essence of the later-born floating desires, but the primordial qi of the Great Unity containing the True; the essence of true primordial potency manifesting response. If one listens inwardly and blocks its cleverness, then essence does not fly away and wisdom is born. The eye is the orifice through which spirit leaks—not the spirit of later-born thoughts and deliberations, but the innate wondrous form, the spiritual awareness of good knowledge, the primordial spirit of the Great Element’s misty vapor. If one looks inward and returns its brightness, then without wandering outward, wisdom arises. One who can hold precepts and enter meditation, wisdom is born. Wisdom born, then water and fire mingle. Water and fire mingle, then Kan and Li unite. Kan and Li unite, then Heaven and Earth are at peace. Heaven and Earth at peace, then metal and wood combine. Metal and wood combine, then soul and spirit meet. Soul and spirit meet, then essence and qi transform. Essence and qi transform, then spiritual powers manifest. Spiritual powers manifest, then light radiates. Light radiates, then merit and virtue are complete. Merit and virtue complete, then the dharma body is formed. Dharma body formed, then the dao body shines forth. Dao body shines forth, then marvelous function moves. Marvelous function moves, then sentient beings are saved. Sentient beings saved, then vow power is fulfilled. Vow power fulfilled, then great matters are accomplished. Great matters accomplished, then position and fruit are realized. Only this one vehicle of the dharma is true; the other two are not genuine. From beginning to end, it never departs from the single word *sincerity*.

The *Doctrine of the Mean* says: “Without sincerity, there is no thing.” The thing is like a misty, elusive presence—within it, there is substance; deep and dark, within it there is essence. Its essence is most true; within it there is trust. Trust is sincerity. This is what the *Book of Changes* calls the essence and qi as the thing; the *Great Learning* calls it the investigation of things. Essence is the essence of oneness in the *Book of Documents*. The center is the very midst of the midst. The *Lotus Sutra* says: “There is one treasure, hidden in the Form Mountain; the sages use this to wash the heart and retire into secrecy. None but this thing.” An ancient song says: “If you gain this heart with nothing else, before your eyes is the time of Fuxi.” Why then need marvelous powers or wondrous light? This marvelous function is the true person who guards the precepts and the dao manifesting in person to teach and save sentient beings, drawing the false back to the true in marvelous function. Thus, within great wisdom and light, the golden arms of compassion reach out, rescuing all beings, leading them out of suffering into stillness. Able to command fate to hasten longevity for beings, able to turn disaster and suffering into peace and joy. Bringing the land to purity and peace, all gain extended life and preserved destiny. Making sentient beings pure, upright, and correct, banishing demons and evil, driving away the violent and rebellious, exterminating monsters and fiends. Making sentient beings kind and benevolent, refraining from killing and harming creatures. Able to preserve beings through kalpa cycles, dispelling grievances and resolving knots. Able to break darkness and bring forth light. Able to heal all diseases and dispel chronic ailments. Able to turn ignorance into wisdom, return to correctness and abandon evil. Able to lessen desires and purify the heart, gather emotions and return to nature. Able to liberate without hindrance, transcend the mundane and enter the sacred. Able to gather blessings and dispel calamities, bring forth auspiciousness and eliminate guilt. Able to transcend the world and attain the dao, leave suffering and ascend to truth. Able to cultivate the supreme vehicle, ascend to Heaven, universally lead sentient beings, spirit-travel the Eight Extremes, surpass the celestial palaces.

May all my sentient beings in mortal bodies become the dharma king’s body, reaching places beyond measure, called spiritual powers. Never revealing their mechanism to the world, called marvelous function. Therefore, the spiritual powers of the gate of precepts, meditation, and wisdom are the spirit that is not spirit—transforming the six consciousnesses into six penetrations, penetrating Heaven and Earth, spirits and ghosts, humans and things—this is called spiritual power. This marvelous function has the marvel without marvel; operating one mechanism to display myriad directions and myriad transformations. Transforming heavenly demons, transforming earthly fiends, transforming myriad ghosts, transforming evil men, transforming monsters—called marvelous function. Within the gate of precepts and meditation is entering stillness; meditation and wisdom generate light, the primordial one qi perfectly bright and auspicious. Above it penetrates the celestial palace, greeting the ancestral qi above the Three Pure Ones; below it penetrates the underworld, pardoning souls at the bottom of the Nine Springs. When preaching the dharma, the heavenly spirits are subdued; the Five Emperors attend the throne; myriad gods serve and guard, arrayed in solemn order. Those who wish to hear the correct dharma and refine spirit to return to emptiness, having already attained liberation, with compassionate heart and mercy, rescuing the suffering and the cold and dark, then the pure net praises and exalts, Kṣitigarbha opens light, ghost judges comply and obey, the underworld is subdued, pardons sins and transcends birth, hearing the correct dharma, escaping the ghost registry, all turning to ultimate bliss. Thus, self-liberating and liberating others, making great vows, wishing all to universally hear the supreme dao, using dharma medicine to universally save sentient beings, including the smallest sentient and all containing spirit, all receiving liberation. Earth, wood, tile, and rubble all feel the connection. All things and feelings, none are not thoroughly penetrated. Operating spiritual powers in unknowing and unconsciousness, Heaven, Earth, and myriad things are within my body; manifesting marvelous function naturally, mountains, rivers, and stars return within the dharma. Heavenly demons all respectfully submit, bowing their heads in reverence. Earthly fiends all transform to kindness and harmony, reverent and subdued. Fierce and cruel ghosts, hearing transformation, ascend beyond, forever renouncing blood offerings. Asuras and heterodox paths submit to the dharma and return to correctness. Wars cease forever, injustice is righted, grievances and hatreds dissolve. By virtue’s transformation, not by force’s subjugation, evil men all become good men; by sincerity’s influence, not by magical arts’ oppression, evil men all turn to upright men. Reversing the dipper’s handle to operate yin and yang, spirits and ghosts are unfathomable; overturning the mechanism of transformation to transcend worlds, Heaven and Earth are unaware. Universally manifesting spiritual brightness, firmly establishing the dharma body, yet no form can be seen. Broadly proclaiming the supreme vehicle’s one marvelous dharma, yet no sound can be heard. The void is my dharma realm, and I am the dharma body of the void. Muddled and indistinct, merged as one with Heaven’s body; upright and grand, one heart with immortals and Buddhas. Master Cheng said: “When released, it fills the six directions; when rolled up, it retreats and hides in secrecy.” This is what is meant. The so-called parents of sentient beings, the dharma masters of the dao gate—are they not the spiritual powers of stillness and liberation, the marvelous function of non-action and naturalness?

Gentlemen, do not cling to form, then wisdom penetrates vast and wide; follow the natural course, then marvelous function is endless. It depends only on daily use, ordinary and without neglect; hurried and urgent, yet not abandoned—this is the two words of dao and virtue. Why then abandon precepts and discipline to study talismans and spells, forsake jade tablets to cling to coral and jade? Willingly be a fool, not learn the highest vehicle’s dao?

Alas! Gentlemen entering the mysterious gate, seek the supreme vehicle. Everyone contains the wondrous orifice; each one is bright. Only because of many obstacles do they see precepts as empty words. Even if holding much, if interrupted often, wandering and shifting, meditation is never deep. When meditation power is deep, precepts and vows are earnest, do not help nor forget—this is the standard. Hold it every moment of the twenty-four hours, for three years or five without fail or reversal. When meditation and precepts are familiar, spiritual powers naturally open; spirit naturally penetrates, marvelous function is true. Operating spiritual powers, gaining marvelous function, gentlemen must rely on advancing sincerity. If foolishly clinging to form in seeking, living in ghostly caves is no proper path. Heterodox and side gates dwell much on form; clinging to emptiness or form is also not cultivation. Do not cling to emptiness, do not cling to form; in meditation there is no form, in feeling there is penetration. Use it and it is numinous and bright; spirit naturally distinguishes. How many daoists lose their middle achievement! I now do not speak much; ah! I directly reveal the heavenly secret. Spiritual powers manifest, marvelous function shines forth, traversing earth and sky, the great dharma king. It does not depart from constant stillness and true constant dao; demon teachings return heart and evil turns good. Disobedience and rebellion, once they understand filial piety and brotherhood, the stubborn and cruel all become kind and gentle. Wisdom is like a mirror, insight like a god, one bright spiritual platform blazing clear. The six penetrations mutually used leave no trace of dust; the great earth, mountains, and rivers are all gold. Gentlemen, do not be negligent or lightly hold precepts; this is the heavenly ladder, step by step ascending. Spirit is hard to fathom, marvel hard to measure; do not leave precepts, meditation, and true constant use. The gate of thusness has a heavenly penetration; in the non-dual fasting, the sacred incense is emitted. Gentlemen, sincerely cultivate and do not abandon yourselves, following the ancient immortals’ great dao place.
