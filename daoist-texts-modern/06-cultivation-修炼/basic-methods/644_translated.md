# Twenty: Enlightenment on Life and Death

Gentlemen, from ancient times until now, sages, immortals, and Buddhas have all, for great matters and karmic causes, spent nine years facing the wall—solely driven by the urgent quest to transcend life and death, to renounce the world and humble the heart. Have you not heard how fleeting is the flash of stone fire, the lightning’s gleam, the falling flower, the flowing water? Impermanence arrives swiftly; a single moment cannot be held. Guilt and merit follow the body, revolving through endless cycles of retribution. Before words are finished, the breath in the throat breaks off; before speech is spoken, the tongue curls back, silencing the voice. Naked and bare, where can one find a resting place? Dark and vast, who can firmly establish their fate? Great blessings bring a return to the human world; evil karma plunges one into the depths of Fengdu. When blessings run out, one re-enters the wheel of rebirth; when karma’s rewards end, one is reborn among beasts. Endless kalpas of grievances bind without release; a thousand lifetimes of sins refuse to wear away. Life after life, lost in delusion, drunk on existence, dreaming through death. Grudge upon grudge, horned and furred, they repay each other. Speaking of it brings pain and sorrow; telling it evokes pity and dread.

If one does not firmly set their resolve, clenching their heavenly conscience like a vice, tearing up earth and overturning heaven, awakening to what comes after death; if one does not give heart and life, piercing through all the foolish delusions of past existence—should one meet a resolute hero, eyebrows bristling straight, wielding the magic sword that slays demons in hand—then indeed, a true man will unleash his vast spirit, cleaving evil with a sharp blade that cuts the heart. One must thoroughly see through the time before one’s parents conceived me, where my life was established, and utterly comprehend the workings of creation. After my death, where can I rest? Enlightenment of the three bodies—past, future, and present—pursuing the three lifetimes as though they were but yesterday, the coming morning as this very dawn. Thus, all worldly worries vanish and are forgotten, leaving only this single point of numinous light, sweeping away all attachments, preserving solely that little spark of wisdom-nature. Entering the profound gate, one aperture opens and all a hundred apertures open; seeing the true lineage, the three times shine clear and the Three Realms are transcended. Liberation means the Five Phases no longer cling; emptiness means the Four Great Elements return to void. Enter the myriad wondrous gates, ascend the land of the Three Treasures, coming and going freely, transformations without limit. Gently turning the heavenly mechanism, ghosts and spirits cannot fathom its marvel; majestically grasping the handle of the dipper, yin and yang cannot control its power. Roaming freely in the Brahmanic breath of Maitreya, attaining position in the clear and vast emptiness. Forever departing the dust and kalpas, transcending the cage. The great matter of Complete Reality is accomplished; one walks the great path step by step, right and wrong unpracticed yet suddenly arrived. This wondrous dharma-body arises entirely from wisdom’s insight; each stage of secret功 is carried out—how could one not awaken and thus achieve perfection?

Gentlemen! The dao is transmitted by sages, cultivation depends on oneself; virtue is accumulated by people, discernment granted by Heaven. Have you not heard that Heaven divides creation at the One, and people establish the scriptures and ethics from the heart? Each person must strive swiftly and diligently, pressing on with urgency. Those not yet enlightened do not lose good causes; those fully enlightened return to the azure sky; those unenlightened do not fall into hell.

Gentlemen! Yet if you knock on the gate with a golden brick, and the gate does not open, the golden brick remains. If precepts and conduct in cultivation are not yet enlightened, but precepts and conduct still exist, one will surely not sink into the underworld but be reborn in the yang world. Past causes not forgotten, the fruit is naturally formed; one only turns things over a bit, still holding a handle in hand.

Gentlemen! If you would understand life and death, do not seek outside your body. When life and death are realized, then you know the true primordial within the heart. Though I speak many words, they are not the ultimate method. If you embody the heart thus, you will find that dao yourself. Death’s principle contemplates life; life’s insight penetrates death. This death-life mechanism turns at the crossroads of the road, controlled by you, not by me. Seeking stillness amid movement, seeking movement amid stillness—thus the pattern of movement and stillness depends entirely on the inner illumination of good conscience. Ask the heart; do not ask the teacher. Remember my words carefully; they will not mislead. If you do not rely on my words, you will ultimately falter. This faint lamp of my dark path has guided countless lost travelers. This raft of mine crossing the bitter ocean carries guests of the Ganges. Gentlemen, do not harbor doubt; when you recognize the truth, travel through the night.

Then, throughout the silent garden, a chant was heard:

“Where was home before life?  
Where do we return after death?  
Now the dharma-body should be realized early;  
Do not pass through the fleeting years empty-handed.  
Death and life, life and death, interpenetrate each other;  
Great matters and karmic causes are not trivial.  
Before death, first resemble death;  
The breath of life is sought within death.  
Not in water, not in mountain,  
Why seek northwest or southeast?  
Look, it does not lie outside my body,  
Only within this tiny square inch.  
Precepts, concentration, wisdom—enter the profound gate,  
Do not let功 fall short by two or three.  
With one heart only realize life and death;  
Iron walls and bronze ramparts are not hard to break.  
Indeed it is bitter, indeed it is difficult,  
Yet like a boat sailing shallow waters.  
Suddenly meeting the river tide and wind,  
In a moment flying past the Nine Dragon Bay.  
Recognize the truth, travel through the night,  
Seeking the staff, none possess it.  
Empty and vast, practicing alone,  
Neither thirsty nor hungry, enduring the heavens and earth.”
