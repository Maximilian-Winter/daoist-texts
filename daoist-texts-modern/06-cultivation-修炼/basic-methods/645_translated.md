# Twenty-One: Completion of Merit and Virtue

Gentlemen! The void is vast and boundless; within the gate of precepts and concentration lies the ladder ascending to Heaven. The sea of suffering is endless; within the light of wisdom shines the ship that ferries across. If you do not loosen your steps and press forward, the ninety thousand li of journey remain unreachable. If you do not straighten your spine and set out, the true teaching will be unheard for countless kalpas. Should your practice lack meticulousness and your resolve falter, how can merit be perfected and virtue fulfilled?

Gentlemen, let no thought in your heart leak even a single thread; then the primordial qi within your body will naturally fill and harmonize. With virtue commanding ghosts and spirits, you may escape the retribution of reincarnation; with the Dao connecting Heaven and Earth, you may transcend the path of birth and death. Ascend high to the shore of the Dao, and turning over is returning home; delve deep into the mysterious and obscure, and in a blink you return to your original aspect.

Gentlemen! Who among you does not face death? Who has seen eternal life? The undying are not of mortal flesh; the long-lived have no concern with form or substance. Where is Pengzu today? Where is Yan Zi after myriad kalpas? The undying are my dharma body; the long-lived are my primordial qi. Even the Tathagata has a time of silence and extinction, entering the realm of Nirvana; Lao Dan has his day of ascension, soaring to the great red heavens. Where the Dao remains, there the person remains; where the dharma exists, there the body abides. To die without forgetting is longevity—the nameless name unbroken through ten thousand kalpas; to live without possession is form—the formless form unharmed through hundreds of lifetimes.

Countless sages as numerous as the sands of the Ganges— which one does not pass through this mysterious gateway? Incalculable immortals and Buddhas beyond thought and measure—which one does not travel this great road? The clear and bright heavenly thoroughfare—alas, how many are lost in doubt and disbelief? The pure and tranquil Buddha realm—alas, how many commoners are blocked by their own obstacles? It is only that blessings are thin and sins deep; though they have eyes, they are worse than the blind. Many, weighed down by deep grievances and heavy karma, though alive, are already counted among the dead. Flesh walks, corpse moves—more than beasts only in speech and language. Sleeping by day and dozing by night, less than plants yet standing stiff and stretching branches. One day, when the ghosts come to claim you, what care have they for your being a fully realized Daoist? Not a word amiss, they check the records of your crimes and still condemn you as a person without virtue, steeped in evil.

Gentlemen! All must die, but it is a matter of dying well. Pure and clean, neat and spotless, coming and going freely without restraint. All must scatter, but it is a matter of scattering skillfully. Clear and bright, unbound and free, transforming with perfect penetration beyond measure. Before returning, bid farewell to the multitudes everywhere. When the time comes, release your grasp and go. Naked and bare, you emerge as a newborn babe, from the crown of your head a vast aura of auspicious light radiates in myriad beams; round and full, you ascend in wondrous form, amidst half the sky, colorful clouds and white cranes soaring high. Many immortal scenes unfold, your primordial spirit returns to pure emptiness; a stream of auspicious light, your true bones rest hidden in the grotto. A great man, his work done! Leaving behind an immortal name among men, passing down a scripture of the Dao within the world. So that after hundreds and thousands of years, people know that such a one existed. This is to die without perishing—that is longevity. So that after countless kalpas the path remains open, that is the body of great completion, great merit, and great blessing.

Gentlemen, your nature and life are in your own hands; you cannot entrust them to others. If you do not cultivate yourself, no one else can do it for you. Thoughts arise and vanish—you may not grasp them. Illusions and selfishness—you may not sweep them away. Deep attachments—you may not relinquish them. The dharma body is formless—you may not recognize it. Precepts and rules—you may not observe them. Afflictions and ignorance—you may not extinguish them. Habits and worldly dust—you may not dispel them. Many obstacles—you may not remove them. True words and wondrous methods—you may not rely on them. Karma and retribution—you may not believe in them. Mundane mind and worldly ways—you may not forget them. Desire for appearances—you may not empty them. Heterodox paths—you may not distinguish them. Conditioned illusions—you may not penetrate them. Every matter and thing—you may not respond to them. Every realm and boundary—you may not transcend them. Perfect persons and enlightened masters—you may not seek them. The vast Dao of emptiness—you may not enter it. All beings in this life—you may not save them. Original aspiration and vow—you may not fulfill them.

Gentlemen, why is this so? Because you disciples are proud and arrogant, and thus transformation eludes you. Sweet words and kind speech—you cannot accept. Doubt or disbelief—you cannot examine. Heavy sins and deep offenses—you cannot uproot. Anger and slander—you cannot restrain. Joyful flattery—you cannot bend. Base nature and violent rage—you cannot reverse. Crafty schemes and perilous plots—you cannot abandon. Loyal admonitions and bitter words—you cannot hear. Confusion and folly—you cannot break. Sightless and blind—you cannot point out. Rampant and unruly—you cannot forbid. Illness and suffering—you cannot heal. Fate and calamity—you cannot pardon. In cycles and kalpas—you cannot spare. Reincarnation and retribution—you cannot escape. Imperial law and secret punishments—you cannot avoid. Mountains of swords and forests of blades—you cannot regard. The compassionate ferry and wise raft—you cannot cross. The golden elixir and wondrous treasure—you cannot receive. Though there is heavenly secret—you cannot turn it. Though there is divine power—you cannot transcend it.

Gentlemen, you must truly cultivate with bitter resolve and bitter effort, uphold the precepts without violation. Seek unity in concentration, one sincerity without duality—that is truly turning the heart toward the Dao. Gentlemen, turning the heart toward the Dao, repentance naturally washes it clean. Returning to the great Dao, entanglements naturally sever. The mysterious gateway of Heaven, pure emptiness naturally approaches. The darkness of the underworld, light naturally opens. Great calamities and tribulations, reincarnation naturally escapes. Birth and death’s impermanence, the handle firmly grasps. The boundless great Dao, hearts naturally unite. The supreme dharma body, clear and bright naturally attains. Infinite blessings, naturally peacefully receive. Countless beings, one by one naturally save. Great vows and solemn oaths, profound and deep naturally fulfill. Earth endures and Heaven lasts, lifespan naturally matches. Only by illuminating the heart, obstacles naturally clear. Only by sincerity, metal and stone naturally penetrate. Only by humility, not a speck can stain. Only by perseverance, ten thousand demons cannot seize.

Only by resolving the heart, immortals and Buddhas may be attained, naturally enlightened. Only by empty heart, wondrous principles may be seen, naturally penetrating deep.

Only by mighty heart, fierce evil may be subdued, naturally without fear. Only by patient heart, nothing may be abandoned, naturally broad and magnanimous. Only by empty heart, formlessness may be retained, naturally ascending to illumination. Only by forgetting heart, formlessness may be divided, naturally no self or other. Only by motherly heart, no one is unknowable, naturally self-saving all beings. Only by no heart, no realm may abide, naturally fully alive. Only by perfectly penetrating heart, the Three Realms cannot bind, naturally without hindrance. Only by beneficial heart, no kalpa cannot be crossed. Only by pure and tranquil heart, boundlessness may abide, naturally great completion.

Gentlemen, now I have finished expounding the dharma; the ritual is complete. But I think of you, father and son ascending the mountain—father cannot pass it to son, son cannot replace father. Fellow travelers on the path, each knows the cold and warmth for themselves, each comes and goes as they will. Thus, in teaching, there is no single method—only prescribing medicine according to the illness, applying the remedy to the symptom. When the illness is cured and the symptom removed, there is no need to use the remedy again. Like crossing a river, one must use a boat; once ashore, one must not think again of the boat. Like threading a needle, once the garment is sewn, there is no need to seek needle and thread again. Do not paint a snake and add feet, do not pull grass and seek snakes. Only by each one striving forward honestly and earnestly, holding fast to the precepts, forgetting the precepts within the precepts, adding discipline beyond discipline, with deep skill and ripe timing, will the ancestral masters surely raise you up and guide you to true penetration. Do not be without purpose, relying on teachers or fellow practitioners, clinging to names and forms, blindly following others’ footsteps day and night and year after year. You must fix your heart firmly, without doubt, single-minded and unwavering, dying without regret. When the time ripens, have you not heard that the Sovereign Heaven does not disappoint the earnest? The great Dao is still and unmoving; if one can respond, then one naturally penetrates.

Gentlemen, if you are willing to forge a fierce heart, pressing straight forward without looking back, aspiring without turning away, this is to have lofty ambition and spirit—then you are truly a seed of the Dao school. The Patriarch Qiu left behind silent verses, not lightly shown to the crowd. Now I recite them for you; listen carefully and accept. The verse says:

“Birth and death are impermanent; you must awaken yourself.  
When dying, your own kin will not look after you.  
Do not rely on others; even gods and immortals save themselves.  
Not stopping at the six dusts nor the six consciousnesses,  
Not depending on any method, the mind abides always.  
The always abiding is impermanent; the always abiding is not.  
Knowing causes without obscuring the countless causes.  
From the cause-ground, clearly see your own nature is emptiness.  
Who illuminates the fruit position of enlightenment?  
From now on, resolve the mechanism of birth and death,  
From here on, erase the book of reincarnation.  
If someone searches for practice according to the rules,  
The heavenly gods will silently know.  
The heart method of the Dragon Gate has no original dharma,  
Bitter and straightforward words speak only one scripture.  
No need to cling to laws; sweep them away,  
Then you see the verse’s true place.  
Carefully study my words explaining the dharma body,  
Emptiness is the treasure trove of many jewels.  
When moving and thought arise endlessly,  
The Dao stored within the body extends blessings.  
The heart method harmonizes; dharma is the heart,  
The dharma heart is endless, the great crossing eternal.”
