# Twenty-Two: Contemplating the Primordial Mechanism

Disciples, this point of empty numinous clarity that does not darken—that is my True Person of Primordial Life. Is such a being easy to behold?

Since ancient times, sages, immortals, Buddhas, ancestral worthies, and myriad perfected ones have sat facing the wall for nine years, seated in the round for six cycles, three by three, seven by seven—diligently seeking and striving. They have traversed famed mountains, wandered blessed lands, sought masters and friends, inquired of the dao and listened to scriptures, endured bitter hardships and profound功, given alms and accumulated virtue. All these various cultivations are but for this body’s birth and death, nature and life—the great matter of cause and condition. Not knowing whence we came, nor whither we go, wandering and sinking, hard to escape the wheel of rebirth. Thus they vow solemnly, establish功 and carry out practice.

Some cut off thought and forget emotion, deeming this the path to transcendence. They sit in meditation for three years, five years, breaking countless mats, yet how often do they truly cease thought or forget feeling? At most, half a moment’s forgetfulness, then two and five return to ten again. Others boil lead and refine mercury as their way out of the world, working功 from dawn to dusk, retreating talismans, advancing fire—how often do they glimpse the jade elixir’s seven returns, the golden liquid’s nine reversions? They seize the thief, then release the thief. Some preserve thought and visualize, silently facing the Emperor on High in the Three Heavens. Others refine and ferry souls, uplifting lost spirits in the Nine Earths. Some call spirits and summon generals, wear talismans and invoke True Persons. Some raise qi and open gates, circulate essence and breath to name the wondrous dao. Some chant scriptures, laboring in worship. Some concoct elixirs to heal sickness and cure sores. Some refine and ingest medicines hoping to ascend. Some imitate yin and yang in gathering and dispersing. Some breathe in gourds and flutes within cauldrons, using spirit to move true lead, extending life and connecting fate. Some add and draw fire and sand inside furnaces to refine grass roots, establishing功 and spreading virtue. Some endure bodily hardship, clutching the Golden Elixir’s dao, awaiting transmission to the fortunate. Some, with shallow cause and condition, undertake difficult paths and fall off cliffs. All these various obscurations of the self-nature, these illusory cultivations, are but side doors.

Disciples, to cut off thought and forget emotion, you must first contemplate where thought arises, whence feeling comes, grasp it firmly, steady it swiftly, recognize the real, point to the actual—only then can you begin to cut off and forget. But tell me, what is this thing you grasp, catch, recognize, point to, act upon, cut off, starve, and forget? No matter how you cut off thought and forget feeling, mats break, but thought remains thought, feeling remains feeling. People call cutting off thought “resting the head upon the head”; forgetting feeling “catching the thief and releasing the thief.” Better yet, forget even the method of forgetting feeling, cut off even the method of cutting off thought—forget both mechanisms and enter the myriad wondrous gates. That is the supreme path indeed. Disciples, I say: the method to cut off thought is itself thought; the method to forget feeling is itself the seed of feeling. Better to have thought cut off than to cut off thought; better to forget feeling than to forget feeling itself. This is called seeking others but better to seek oneself.

Disciples, those who boil lead and refine mercury, who add and draw fire, who imitate hexagrams and lines—these break the Great Ultimate’s primal unity, piercing and shattering it. They mistake false names for real use, point to metaphors as功. They blindly discuss the three fields, guess at essence and breath, the seven emotions’ machinery, the nine orifices’ pivots. They take the seven and nine characters, the return and reversal characters, as seven times nine, seven returns nine returns, seven segments nine segments, seven years nine years, seven transformations nine transformations. This drawing here, that image there. Standing upright are the spine, the mud pellet, the tail gate, the cinnabar field, the scarlet chamber, the yellow court, the flower pool; water rises, fire descends; warming, nourishing, bathing, sealing and solidifying—today it is Kan and Li in union; tomorrow it is Earth and Heaven in harmony; the day after, soul and spirit conjoin; this year still a baby, next year still a baby; after nine years, still an old sinner who does not know death. He does not know his error, yet still shakes his head, bends his fingers, babbles nonsense to outsiders: “On what day did I form the sacred embryo? The warming and fire timing was not wrong, the bathing season was not off—why, after ten months, no baby is born? Is it that our blessings are thin and sins deep, and ghosts and spirits refuse our success?” He still cradles his belly, old-faced, eyes probing, tears falling empty. You see this base and foolish person, ignorant of his own heart, unclear of his own nature, clouded by karmic darkness—what dao can he know? Yet he still has a heart to ascend, but is lost in confusion, unawakened to the upward opportunity.

Within you is essence and breath, originally innate primordial qi and primordial essence, a treasure neither increased nor diminished. If you meddle with it, you see no addition; if you do not meddle, you see no loss. This empty numinous undarkened true primordial is the primordial spirit. Since it is called the primordial spirit, why speak of a baby? Long ago, before many kalpas, with sins unremoved, obstacles uncleared, the source of the heart unclean, the root of nature unnuminous—if you do not repent early and change your temperament, seek masters and awaken to the dao, you instead use that useful true heart for useless false matters, wasting limited time waiting for a shadowless baby, what for?

Disciples, within your body you know good and evil, right and wrong, crooked and straight, birth and death, self and other, true and false—that is the baby. Yet this baby originally does not know good and evil, right and wrong, crooked and straight, birth and death, self and other, true and false. This baby does not fix on form; from circumstance arises the heart; from heart arises wisdom; from wisdom arises knowledge; from good arises knowing evil; from right arises knowing wrong; from straight arises knowing crooked; from birth arises knowing death; from self arises knowing other; from straight arises knowing false. Originally no self-image, nor empty image—this point in the world’s perceptual movement responds to myriad affairs. If you speak of the Great Ultimate’s primal unity, then this knowing may also be unknowing. But this knowing is good knowing; Buddhists call it good knowledge; Daoists call it the baby primordial spirit. In sum, all people are but a point of empty numinous undarkened nature-body.

You see Daoists enter the round and sit in meditation, speaking of gestation, ten months in the chamber—have you ever seen a Daoist manifest a baby’s form, radiating light? Such people, before entering the round, do not know Heaven and Earth, ghosts and spirits, yin and yang conditions, human calamity and blessing, future fortune and misfortune, birth year and death day. Even after emerging from the round, they still do not know. Their own birth and death unclear, unable to save themselves, how can they save others? Their own birth and death unknown, fortune and misfortune unpredicted, bound by Heaven and Earth, living like common folk, dying like ordinary men—clothed in pain and food, buried in stench and rot. Is this sitting in the round not a needless affair?

Disciples, first die and forget the heart before entering the round; first resolve attachments, then sit in meditation. When lustful heart ceases long, the kidneys are sufficient and true lead rises. When angry heart ceases long, the heart empties and true mercury descends. When diet is regulated in accord with season, the spleen is strong and mercury and lead are sealed. When feeling is empty, the lungs moisten and nature settles; the liver flourishes and kidney water thrives; the eyes shine bright and pupils are like lacquer. When heart fire is extinguished, mouth fluids fill and taste and swallowing are like sweet wine. When soul is clear, liver qi flows smoothly and muscles and bones are light; when spirit is at peace, lung fluids circulate and hair and beard are black. When spleen is strong and stomach harmonious, tongue and throat are clear and voice resonant. When orifices open and blood flows richly, all diseases retreat; when five flavors are bland, right qi arises. By observing four seasons and eight festivals, guiding and leading, wind, cold, heat, and damp cannot invade. Guarding six desires and seven emotions, restraining nature and lowering heart, demons, ghosts, and spirits cannot harm. Seeking the great dao, conscience appears and true nature shines; children awaken to true thusness, body empties and dharma body appears. Saving oneself before saving others—that is still saving oneself.

Disciples, at this stage you have taken the first step into the great gate. Then entering the round, sitting in stillness, you may connect above to Heaven, below to Earth, know the conditions of ghosts and spirits, the pivots of Heaven and Earth—how can breath and spirit not be called forth, creation not emerge beyond the palm? All this comes from戒 and定. Thus, when entering the round, one is mortal flesh and bone; when emerging, a sacred body and dharma body. Knowing the great dao, the eye’s view is high, seeing through all conditions as illusion and falsehood; with a staff in hand, the heart is broad, embracing Heaven and Earth into emptiness. Before the human heart moves, I know first; before things come to pass, I foresee. This is the six penetrations, wisdom without end; all heavenly demons bow and submit, secretly protecting and aiding. All outside paths turn to faith, all fear and respect. Within a mustard seed, Mount Sumeru fits unnoticed; within a grain of millet, the Ten Directions’ worlds hide unperceived. When expanded, the great earth, mountains, and rivers are my carefree roaming; when concealed, the body is but dust and grain, resting on me.

Disciples, this upward path of non-action, utmost truth, and wondrous dao first lies in contemplating subtle principle and awakening to Heaven’s mechanism. Therefore, you must cast aside blind cultivation and blind sitting, boiling lead and refining mercury, preserving thought and visualizing, refining and ferrying souls, taking office and receiving records, raising qi and waving fans, chanting scriptures and reciting proclamations, mixing medicines and burning grass, ingesting and gathering herbs, yin-yang furnaces and cauldrons—these many fruitless matters are not urgent; set them all aside. With utmost sincerity, vow to Heaven. From today and henceforth, only wish to quickly understand the mechanism of birth and death, coming and going; to free oneself from the suffering of the wheel of birth and death; to leave all boundaries behind and hear the wondrous dao. Ah! This phrase “leave all boundaries behind”—truly for you, is the great convenient gate to contemplate subtle principle and awaken to Heaven’s mechanism.

Disciples! What are these “all boundaries”? They are blind cultivation and blind sitting, all side doors. What are boundaries? These side doors are neither central nor correct, like a table—these side doors are always at the edges, unable to enter the heart; even if they reach the heart, they do not leave the table. Little do they know that leaving the table is the empty dao; not leaving the table is still things, not the dao—is this not boundary? Boundaries are seeking, error, limits, shores. Side is not center; error is not correct. Where there are boundaries, there is no vastness; where there are cliffs and shores, there is no great clarity. Clinging tightly to this meat bag, mistaking it for a thousand-year-old cypress or ten-thousand-year-old pine, living and dying, trapping the master. Instead, abandoning the lamp to seek fire, loving the false and discarding the true—is this not falling to one side? Even if successful, it is but self-realization. Not yet seeing nature, though having fruit position, repaying all karmic debts and returning to the wheel, hard to surpass the Three Realms—what benefit is there for these beings?

Disciples, to become immortal, Buddha, sage, or worthy, all depends on abandoning self and following others, to save sentient beings, to vow great vows. Now these sitting people cannot even save themselves—how can they save others? Called self-realized, how have they truly known the great dao or immeasurably saved others? Falling to side cultivation, deeply pitiable! The True Lord spoke a verse, revealing the true mechanism, teaching all to abandon self-interest and also abandon side methods. Let side doors return to the center and act; let heretical teachings enter the right dharma. Expand limited boundaries without obstruction or cover. Stretch the vast world to connect Heaven and Earth. Widen cliffs and banks to be boundless and shoreless. Extend the unfathomable dharma body to be no one and no self. The scripture says: “Seeing not me, hearing not me, leaving all boundaries behind, this is called the wondrous dao indeed.”

All, the gate to contemplation and awakening requires first opening heart and mind. From where does life come? To where does death return? Draw near to those high and wise masters, friends of wisdom and sincerity. Broadly harbor good heart, carefully investigate. Life is like a cup of tea, confined by form and image, water already flavored. Pour it into the Eastern Ocean, scattered as great waves and floods. If you seek the original self, adding tea flavor and calling it water, then there is color and form. Yet ultimately within this ocean dwells my original source—what is my original source? Carefully seek and analyze, ultimately seeing without seeing, hearing without hearing. After long功, naturally the chest clears one morning, the eyes become pure and clear, seeing my original face and wondrous heavenly mechanism, manifesting this point of true nature, then believing the great dao, not failing people!

Disciples, sages, immortals, and Buddhas have long since attained the dao and ascended to Heaven. To see their hearts, first understand their principles. To understand their principles is to awaken to their methods. To awaken to their methods is to carry out their deeds. To carry out their deeds is to be their body. Disciples, where is the heart of sages, immortals, and Buddhas? Only within one’s own square inch platform. Where are their principles? Only before each person’s eyes. Where are their methods? Only in the gathered scriptures and histories. Where are their deeds? Not beyond worldly methods, only within worldly methods. Their bodies are within their hearts. If you know the heart of sages, immortals, and Buddhas within the square inch, then you can understand their principles. If you understand their principles, you can awaken to their methods. If you awaken to their methods, you can carry out their deeds. Understanding their principles preserves the right path. Awakening to their methods awakens all conditions. Carrying out their deeds establishes功 and achievement. And Heaven’s mechanism never ceases, lasting through myriad kalpas. Know that this person’s spiritual penetration and wisdom already possess the body of sages, immortals, and Buddhas—that is their heart. Then advance to receive the central utmost戒, open and clear the nature-spirit, making the mysterious gate transparent, thus able to understand their principles. Then advance to receive the heavenly immortal戒, deeply study wondrous meanings, making wisdom perfectly thorough, thus able to penetrate their dao. Then liberated without obstruction, able to be round or square, great or small, moving or still, forward or backward, born or dead, yielding or stretching, entering or exiting, saint or worthy, immortal or Buddha; able to live four lives, traverse six paths, enter Heaven’s void, enter hell. Teaching according to place, saving people through kalpas. Transforming beyond measure, manifesting form to expound the dharma. Like a boundless bright mirror reflecting all forms and shadows, mutually interpenetrating. Then able to carry out deeds of sages, immortals, and Buddhas, become their body, and realize their fruit!

All, reaching this stage is called contemplating subtle principle and awakening to Heaven’s mechanism. Long ago, the Yellow Emperor left his mysterious pearl in the Red River, sending the Li Zhu rope to seek it—Li Zhu rope could not find it; then sending the Qi Gou rope to seek it—Qi Gou rope could not find it; then sending the Wang Xiang net to seek it—Wang Xiang net found it. That Li Zhu is the Li Palace’s vermilion color, the human postnatal flesh lump heart—thus it could not be found, like those who use the mind’s edge to see. That Qi Gou is human love and attachment, pure mouth and pure body, relying on fasting—this heart is also pure but cannot find it. As for Wang Xiang, how can it find it? Disciples! Wang means nothingness, Xiang means form and color. Wang Xiang means formless and colorless. Therefore, it is not called a bright pearl, but a mysterious pearl. Even the Most Holy First Teacher Confucius said: “That which is above form is called dao; that which is below form is called vessel.” The Most High Patriarch said: “Look inward at the heart, the heart has no heart; look outward at form, form has no form.” Disciples, the ultimate principle is original true form. Sages and sages, immortals and immortals, Buddhas and Buddhas—all hold to non-attachment to form. If one cultivates attachment to form, then even the Yellow Emperor, using wisdom to fast and seek the mysterious pearl, would have failed. Disciples! The Yellow Emperor lost the mysterious pearl and found it in formlessness; ordinary people’s wondrous principle is found in the no-heart multitude. I have revealed all Heaven’s mechanism, clarified the heart seal. You must carefully examine and tightly guard this mysterious pearl lost in the Red River, lest you know not whence it returns!

Then the戒 disciples all bowed their heads, took refuge, and listened to the verse:

“Ten thousand volumes of immortal scriptures cannot exhaust it; one chapter directly points and reveals without remainder.  
I urge you not to meddle with many methods; the dao lies in the heart, not in books.  
Fixating on form and pondering mysteries breeds many thoughts; with a heart, sitting in meditation becomes demonic.  
Many stray on evil roads; no one can oppose the right path.  
True Persons have no form nor shape; a segment of Heaven’s mechanism is everywhere displayed.  
Ignoring the many dark searches before your eyes, cease abandoning the right path for side doors.”

At that time, Master Kunyangzi, together with the multitude, dedicated merit and completed the volume. The戒 disciple Shi Shouping compiled it into a book and submitted it for the master’s inscription for future students. The master said: “No need; you only need to pass it from person to person. After reading for one hundred seventy years, it shall be established as the ‘Scripture of the Jade Garden Altar.’”
