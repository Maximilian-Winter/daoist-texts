# Appendix One: The Repentance Petition of Patriarch Qiu

The merit of the scripture’s功 is vast and boundless beyond thought,  
Its merit is dedicated to all the holy assemblies in the Ten Directions.  
May those who truly seek with sincere hearts to repent,  
Have their sins and obstacles as countless as river sands wholly dissolved.

We repent: from ancient kalpas long past,  
Up to this present life, we have taken shape through borrowed fire, wind, earth, and water,  
Clinging to fragrant tastes, colors, and sounds, thus touching the dharmas.  
Greed, anger, jealousy, slander, and false speech;  
Killing, stealing, illicit lust, unrestrained desires.  
Rebelling against and insulting our parents,  
Betraying and defying sovereigns and teachers.  
Disrespecting Heaven, Earth, and the numinous gods,  
Scoffing at wind, cursing rain.  
Disbelieving in the justice of sin and merit, cause and effect,  
Obscuring principle and deceiving the heart.

Thus we bring about retribution’s rise and fall,  
The wheel of rebirth endlessly turning,  
Enduring all manner of suffering and vexation without rest or pause.  
All because of a single mistaken thought,  
Obscuring and confusing our true nature,  
Falsely recognizing the illusions of the six dusts,  
Drowning in the river of love and attachment.  
Now that we have obtained the human body,  
Blessed to receive the orthodox teachings from our parents,  
Is this not a blessing of a thousand lives?  
Having met this once, we should naturally examine our hearts,  
Early seek to save the world.  
But if like before we wander astray,  
Ultimately losing the original,  
One falls into the dark path,  
Transforming into strange and alien forms.

Therefore, reflecting on the suffering of sinking and drowning,  
We awaken a pure and tranquil heart,  
Turn to the holy and true,  
Especially seeking repentance,  
Begging pity for our foolish ignorance.  
May our sins be forgiven, grievances resolved,  
May all demonic obstacles be dispelled,  
May the life we long for meet with flourishing fortune, our names inscribed on the Elixir Platform.  
May we encounter true masters,  
Hear firsthand the ultimate dao,  
Diligently cultivate wondrous practice,  
Grow the shoots of goodness,  
Fully observe the profound gate,  
Delight in the numinous true realm.  
One day, when fate calls for extinction and liberation,  
Our true nature will not be confused or lost.  
We will be born into a family of ten virtues,  
Able to penetrate past destinies,  
Returning to verify the highest path,  
Serving the Sovereign of Emptiness.

Still, we wish for the country’s peace, the people’s abundance, harmonious times, and bountiful harvests;  
We wish for the true winds to widely spread the dao’s transformation and flourishing;  
We wish for evil to turn to goodness, and demons to return to righteousness;  
We wish for war and punishment to cease, prisons to empty and lie fallow;  
We wish for grudges and resentments that weigh down to be lifted and reconciled;  
We wish for those who study the profound learning to enter the dao and become true;  
We wish for all ancestral clans through kalpas to be transcended;  
We wish for all teachers and friends across lifetimes to jointly verify the eternal truth;  
We wish for all kin and attachments to increase in blessing and wisdom;  
We wish for all harmed beings and lives to soon be born into Heaven;  
We wish to cut off food, wine, and flesh that kill and harm;  
We wish to hold the body upright and not tread the path of illicit lust;  
We wish to utterly break stinginess and greed, and remove all dangers and steep cliffs;  
We wish for speech without arrogance, and conduct honored for sincerity;  
We wish to humble ourselves, be generous to others, and quietly endure anger;  
We wish for hearts of compassion, humble spirits, and reverence toward all;  
We wish not to fall into barbarian lands nor follow false views;  
We wish to make friends with immortals and gather in pure emptiness;  
We wish for wisdom to open and brighten, and numinous powers to expand boundlessly;  
We wish to widely practice skillful means and universally aid all beings;  
We wish to forever sever attachment and confusion, all returning to the supreme dao.  
When the kalpas of dust come to an end, my wish is endless;  
When the kalpas of dust come to an end, my wish is endless;  
When the kalpas of dust come to an end, my wish is endless.
