# Appendix Two: The Teachings Left by Patriarch Qiu

Let all disciples of our teaching, the enlightened ones, be fully aware: since you have entered the true teaching of the mysterious gate, your hearts connect with the good roots sown in past lives. First, you verify the blessings and fruits of this present life; second, you cultivate so as not to fall in the coming kalpas. If one holds a sincere heart toward the dao, one must always abide by the Most High Patriarch’s laws.

Alas, the disciples do not awaken to this truth. They only seek to pass their days through Daoism, unaware that the profound methods contain prohibitions and precepts. Every grain of rice and every coin of copper is bound up with these—they are the very essence of the world, the sweat and blood of farmers. Without effort, how can they be consumed? How can one receive blessings without merit?

You fools, lost and confused, do not reflect within, nor are you willing to cultivate and uphold the Way. Instead, you say our teaching has no merit, and turn your hearts toward the outer paths. Thus arise thieves and evildoers, who harm others to benefit themselves. Some indulge in meat, wine, and gambling, destroying the teaching and ruining the lineage; some burn weeds and refine mercury, deceiving and misleading people; some trust in side schools, slandering the orthodox teaching. Such rogue and shameful conduct—how could it be the work of Daoism?

Moreover, do not say that you later learners can escape retribution. Even the heavenly gods, if they err, are stripped of their stations; the earth spirits, if they err, are demoted; immortals, if they err, fall into dust; ghosts and spirits, if they err, vanish utterly; kings, if they err, lose their realms; ministers, if they err, suffer punishment; scholars, if they err, lose their reputation; commoners, if they err, forfeit their blessings. Every evil has its due consequence. How much more so for those of you who commit evil—can you escape retribution?

Therefore, disciples of our teaching, you must examine your own hearts. Why did you leave the world behind? It was to see through the dust of worldly ties, the suffering of the wheel of rebirth, and thus begin to advance on the dao. How can you then turn back to wrongdoing, adding sin upon sin? The law has three vehicles: follow the original teaching and act accordingly, measure your strength and advance steadily, set your resolve and guard it, endure hardship and cultivate diligently—this is the true path of those who have left the world!

The highest vehicle cultivates the true nature and nourishes the essence, bitterly striving to penetrate the profound, to realize the wondrous dao of emptiness and non-being, to awaken the correct qi of Heaven and Earth. It removes the grievances of the dusty world, widely practices benevolence and righteousness, and amasses vast stores of hidden merit. Only when three thousand merits are fulfilled and eight hundred practices perfected does the body transcend the Three Realms and take its place among the ranks of immortals! Some mount phoenixes and cranes to court the Golden Palace; others ride colorful birds to attend the Jade Pool. A thousand spirits revere them, ten thousand sages protect them. They share the same body as Heaven and Earth, shine with the same light as sun and moon. Are they not the great men who have truly left the world?

The middle vehicle holds the heart and expounds the teaching, performing rites of repentance and reciting scriptures. They chant the Most High’s ritual texts, honor the precious titles of the Heavenly Venerables, pray with sincere faith before the gods, and observe pure fasts within the temple. With a clear and tranquil body and mind, they manifest the great dao. One thought pure and true, always preserving the orthodox law. When the time comes for the dharma to fade, benevolent spirits will naturally offer protection. Some are sent to the imperial court, some born into official households, some rise to ministerial rank among the Three Terraces, some become kings and their names ascend to the Nine Five. At such times, the ten thousand people revere them, the four seas submit, and among men they stand distinguished—how exalted is this!

The lower vehicle builds palaces and temples, prints scriptures and carves images, repairs bridges and mends roads, forbids killing and practices release of life, offers tea and medicine, promotes the root of compassion, and cuts off the mind of stinginess and greed. Some aid the poor and destitute, humbling themselves in heart; they honor teachers and respect friends, receive guests with kindness, cherish the old and pity the poor. When their merits and practices reach fullness, golden youths come to guide and transform them into humans born into wealthy and noble families, enjoying endless benefits throughout their lives. Is this not joyful?

Thus are the three vehicles of cultivation and practice clearly distinguished in every phrase. If one does not awaken, does not eliminate wine, lust, wealth, and anger, it is better to return to secular life and go home! To take suffering as pleasure, to follow desires at will, to act arbitrarily—is this not the way of profit and delight? Yet you linger long in the mysterious gate, lost and unawakened, creating boundless sins, and the retribution is hard to escape! Those with true aspiration may deeply enter; those without past affinity may quickly retreat. Otherwise, sins multiply, and I am deeply compassionate! For this, I instruct you.

If anyone sees this teaching and returns their heart, hears this instruction and changes their mind, resolutely reforms their will, bitterly corrects past faults, and advances with courage and diligence—those who hear will awaken, those who see will be enlightened. Awakening is the turning of the light within the heart; enlightenment is the reflection back upon the mind. If one does not awaken early, one will forever lose one’s true nature, fall into the dark path, sink in the sea of suffering, transform into strange beings. When that time comes, how late for regret! Wise and intelligent ones, ponder carefully: if you miss this life, the great dao is hard to encounter!
