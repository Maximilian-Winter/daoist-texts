# Appendix Three: Song of Master Qiu’s Azure Heaven

### Song of Master Qiu’s Azure Heaven  
Let not floating clouds arise to bar the azure heaven;  
When clouds arise, the azure heaven veils myriad forms.  
Myriad forms arrayed in solemn ranks suppress a hundred evils;  
Where light does not shine, demons thrive and swell.  

When first I opened wide the clear heaven and earth,  
Ten thousand households, a thousand gates, sang peace profound.  
Yet sometimes a patch of black cloud would rise,  
All nine orifices, a hundred bones, stirred uneasily.  

Therefore long I urge the keen wind of wisdom to blaze,  
Through the Three Realms and Ten Directions to drift and cleanse.  
When clouds disperse, the void body reveals its truth;  
Naturally appears the moon in every home.  

Beneath the moon, one may lift the flute and blow—  
A single clear note rings, shaking Hua and Yi.  
Startled, the Jade Youth of the East awakes,  
Riding backward on a white deer, swift as a shooting star.  

Circling, turning, a joy alike no other,  
Neither sheng nor horn, neither sound nor form.  
Three feet of cloud jade, twelve emblems bright,  
Through kalpas and years, the primordial whole is wrought.  

Jade tones ring out, surpassing Zheng’s music,  
Light and pure, pervading the hearts of adepts.  
From one point I gained the aid of ghosts and gods,  
Entering earth and heaven, transcending ancient and now.  

Freely roaming, unbound and unshackled,  
Heart ungreedy for fame, body untainted by shame.  
Leisurely I sing the white snow song within my gourd,  
Quietly tuning the spring melody beyond the world.  

My home’s song is all of nature’s own making,  
No holes in the pipe, no strings on the zither.  
Awakened, I startle from the dream of fleeting life;  
Day and night, pure music fills the cavernous heavens.  

### Song of Master Qiu’s Azure Heaven: Annotations by Master Hunranzi  

Title of Scripture: Annotations on the Song of the Azure Heaven, also called Annotations on the Song of the Azure Heaven by Zhi Changchun. Yuan Wang Jie’s commentary in the Zhengtong Daozang, section of Cave Truths, category of Jade Secrets.  

Annotations by Master Hunranzi:  

Let not floating clouds arise to bar the azure heaven—The Great Dao is originally non-action.  
When clouds arise, the azure heaven veils myriad forms—All action is error.  
The azure heaven here refers to human nature; floating clouds signify the杂念, the tangled thoughts of man. These two lines are the outline for the cultivator. In daily life, throughout the twenty-four hours, the mind must be pure and the intention clear, not allowing the slightest selfish thought to arise, which would block the true nature’s natural flow—like the azure heaven without cloud barriers. If the mind cannot govern itself, responding to external objects and shifting with passing thoughts, the clouds arise to veil myriad forms.  

Myriad forms arrayed in solemn ranks suppress a hundred evils—When nature is still, emotions at ease.  
Where light does not shine, demons thrive and swell—When the mind moves, the spirit tires.  
This means when the one nature is rightly placed, all evils return to their root, and within the body, heaven and earth, myriad qi becomes one qi, myriad spirits become one spirit. Naturally, the mind-lord is calm and steady, suppressing a hundred evils. If anger cannot be restrained, desire not checked, emotions run wild and do not return, one is seized by demons; thus our light does not shine, and evil spirits flourish.  

When first I opened wide the clear heaven and earth—Mastering self and restoring ritual.  
Ten thousand households, a thousand gates, sang peace profound—The world returns to benevolence.  
This means the one who attains the dao sees through the birth-body’s emptiness, simply maintaining clear stillness and preserving truth, always like a newborn child. Nature is empty, life firm; the four great elements and eighty-four thousand pores flow freely, blood and qi circulate unhindered. As the Yi Jing’s Kun hexagram says: “Yellow center penetrates principle, proper place occupies the body, flowing through the limbs, beauty lies within.” Is this not the clear heaven and the peaceful ten thousand households?  

Yet sometimes a patch of black cloud would rise—Anger unrestrained, desire unchecked.  
All nine orifices, a hundred bones, stirred uneasily—Water and fire fail to harmonize.  
This means when evil thoughts stir, it is like black clouds rising. At such times one must urgently awaken, turning the light inward, nurturing the good heart. Without restraint, following the leaks of eyes, ears, nose, tongue, and body, enslaved by form, nature’s heaven becomes locked in black clouds, the sea of suffering churns with lustful waves; thus all nine orifices and hundred bones are restless. The Dao De Jing says: “Open its gates, aid its affairs, and the body will not wear out.” The Zen school says: “Do not fear evil thoughts arising, only fear slow awareness.” Mencius said: “Losing chicken and dog yet knowing to seek; letting the heart loose and not knowing to seek—alas!” Cultivators must be vigilant.  

Therefore long I urge the keen wind of wisdom to blaze—Spirit once out, then recalled.  
Through the Three Realms and Ten Directions to drift and cleanse—Washing heart and clearing thought.  
This stanza warns the learner: the mind must always dwell in the chest, in movement and stillness, with firmness and purity, never opposing the myriad conditions. When encountering forms, one must resolutely strengthen the will, cautiously avoiding stirring thoughts. Master Yin Xi said: “When things come, I respond with nature, not with mind.” The Diamond Sutra says: “Do not let color give rise to mind; do not let sound, smell, taste, touch, or dharma give rise to mind; let the mind arise without attachment—thus subdue the mind.” Confucius said: “The gentleman stays in his place and acts, not longing for what lies beyond.” Hence if the mind-lord governs rightly, wisdom naturally becomes perfect and thorough; then the three treasures within return to their source, and the Ten Directions are pure and clear, without obstruction.  

When clouds disperse, the void body reveals its truth—One truth ever present.  
Naturally appears the moon in every home—The whole body is the Dao.  
Following the above, having cleansed through the Three Realms and Ten Directions, no thought arises, and the true nature remains ever present. Its subtlety pervades the body; stars and moon both shine forth—this is the inner scene of sitting in forgetfulness. As the Scripture on Deliverance says: “All heavens return to their place.” Like Master Yan repeatedly emptying himself.  

Beneath the moon, one may lift the flute and blow—The Gui hour must be seized swiftly.  
A single clear note rings, shaking Hua and Yi—Returning wind, blending all.  
Now speaking of life cultivation work: “beneath the moon” means the winter solstice’s Zi hour, where yang first stirs—the Gui hour. At this time, one must quickly act, calling forth spirit and breath, directing qi to the orifices, closing their gates, harmonizing pitch and tone, blending the myriad spirits. This is to blow the flute within the body’s no-hole pipe, producing a clear note that vibrates Hua and Yi. Without a true master, the secret words cannot be known.  

Startled, the Jade Youth of the East awakes—Seeking the mystery in the water palace.  
Riding backward on a white deer, swift as a shooting star—Taking Kan to fill Li.  
“Startled” means steaming up, rising from below. The East is the wood that generates fire at the Yin position. The Jade Youth is the flowing intention and flying spirit. Riding backward means reversal. The white deer is refined essence transformed into white qi. In sum, when entering the alchemical chamber, the nature-lord governs the inner flowing intention, sinking to the water palace to steam, preserving the root, awaiting the fire’s growing heat. The movement rises to the head’s gates, turning from Yin to Ji, flowing through Wu earth, supervising the advancing fire, forcing out metal essence, piercing the three gates, entering the southern palace, supplementing the Yin within Li—thus forming the Qian trigram, moving as swiftly as a shooting star.  

Circling, turning, a joy alike no other—Out goes what comes in.  
Neither sheng nor horn, neither sound nor form—The form of no form.  
“Circling” means closing off, descending from above. “Turning joy alike no other” means the six yang gather Qian; yang has no end. One yin is born beneath five yang; following this, closure must come. From Wu to Hai, using Ji earth to retreat the Yin talisman, descending from the metal gate to the magpie bridge and flower pool, pouring down in torrents, entering the multi-storied scarlet palace, straight to the Kun earth cauldron and stopping. Producing a bright pearl like the full moon, unlike any sheng or horn.  

Three feet of cloud jade, twelve emblems bright—Three flowers gather in the cauldron.  
Through kalpas and years, the primordial whole is wrought—Five qi greet the origin.  
Following the above meaning of turning joy alike no other: “three feet of cloud jade” means the three great medicines returning to the cauldron, marvelously merging to condense truth. In a single breath’s work, one seizes back the year, twelve months of creation. The alchemical scriptures say: cluster years return to months, months to days, days to hours; within one hour, only two phases are used, cycling the celestial fire, gathering medicine into the chamber, conducting inner work, blending, melting, refining, forming the sacred embryo—thus “through kalpas and years, the primordial whole is wrought.” The Scripture on Deliverance says: “Centering the five qi, blending myriad spirits, ten turns returning spirit, myriad qi united in immortality.” The Master of True Understanding says: “The great medicine’s three essences—essence, qi, spirit—are naturally mother and child, mutually intimate. Returning wind blends to true form; refining work daily renews.”  

Jade tones ring out, surpassing Zheng’s music—Heaven without floating veil.  
Light and pure, pervading the hearts of adepts—Four qi bright and clear.  
Following the above meaning of primordial blending and refining: “jade tones ring out” means having attained the true fire’s refining power, shedding old stains and filth, achieving harmony of spirit and qi, like Shun’s pure music. Thus surpassing the licentiousness of Zheng’s tones, awakening the body’s earth into jade, without strange colors, naturally pervading and reaching the human heart. The Scripture on Deliverance says: “Golden truth bright and rich, flowing sound cloud-encamped, jade tones capturing qi, numinous wind gathering smoke.” Without true transmission and practice, how could one know such subtlety?  

From one point I gained the aid of ghosts and gods—Demons dare not offend.  
Entering earth and heaven, transcending ancient and now—Transformations follow me.  
This means the alchemical way perfected, transformation free and easy; the cosmos is within me, myriad changes return to the body. At this level, yin and yang move by my will, Five Phases serve my command, wind and rain I summon, thunder I call. Thus manifesting the great body, pervading dust motes, hiding the small body, carrying Mount Sumeru. Ghosts and gods cannot fathom its workings, naturally bowing heads to serve, entering its earth and heaven, transcending ancient and now, transformations endless.  

Freely roaming, unbound and unshackled—Not bound by form.  
Heart ungreedy for fame, body untainted by shame—Inside and out, both forgotten.  
Following the above meaning of transcending ancient and now: “freely roaming” means only the Dao is the body, not following worldly change, but turning and grasping at will, transformation by me—how could there be restraint? Wealth and glory, at this time, are utterly overturned; how could the heart still crave fame or the body be disgraced? This is the living path; if not a resolute great man with fierce methods, how could one reach this?  

Leisurely I sing the white snow song within my gourd—The great Dao vast and empty.  
Quietly tuning the spring melody beyond the world—Surpassing the Three Realms.  
This means leisurely singing is to find one’s true joy. Then the body has its own gourd heaven scene, always with drifting white snow flying, clear and bright, utterly free of dust. As Zhuangzi said: “An empty chamber births white; spirit and brightness come of themselves.” Master Yin also said: “One breath calms feeling, and the great Dao is reached.” Thus the nine harmonies and ten unions, one qi pure yang, transcend beyond the Three Realms—surely singing the spring melody.  

My home’s song is all of nature’s own making—Form and spirit both subtle.  
No holes in the pipe, no strings on the zither—In accord with the Dao and true.  
This means the nine-turn elixir formed, shedding birth and transforming spirit, is the way of nature; its essence like the void, no form to behold. The Primordial Heavenly Worthy said: “Seeing me not, hearing me not, free from all boundaries, this is called the marvelous Dao.” How could there be pipes with holes or zithers with strings? These truths can be silently grasped by the ancients. The Dao is originally formless; I am not I; iron walls and silver mountains, suddenly pierced through. If the learner gains this one phrase, then study is complete—what doubt remains?  

Awakened, I startle from the dream of fleeting life—Void shattered to powder.  
Day and night, pure music fills the cavernous heavens—Revealing the golden truth alone.  
This stanza concludes the marvel from start to finish. “Gained” means having attained the true Dao, eternally proving the adamantine indestructible body, awakening to the dreamlike nature of all conditioned things. Having attained today’s supreme wonderful Dao, within the body day and night there is always immortal music, filling the cavernous heavens. This also warns later learners: even if one gains fame that covers the world, or writing surpasses others, without true transmission to the Dao, in the end all is vanity, not real. If one only greedily clings and fails to awaken, drifting into the dream of fleeting life, endless reincarnation, how can one escape birth and death? Only a resolute great man can trust, penetrate, sever, and upon one awakening turn back, directly transcending the formless realm, turning toward our great Dao to cultivate—within preserving spirit and nourishing qi, without blending with worldly dust. This is to be in the world yet beyond it, riding alongside immortals and Buddhas—how could this be empty words?
