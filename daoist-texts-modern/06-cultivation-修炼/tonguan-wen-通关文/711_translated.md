# Scripture on Passing the Barrier

## Preface to the Scripture on Passing the Barrier

The great Dao of cultivating Reality—secretly harnessing yin and yang, wresting the power of creation, mastering life and destiny, escaping birth and death—is the grand endeavor of transcending the mundane to enter the sacred, of becoming immortal and founding the lineage of transcendent sages. This is no petty matter like the fleeting frost on grass, the bubble on water—things that appear and vanish, empty and insubstantial. Yet alas, the Daoists of the world peer through a gourd and measure the sea, mistaking great matters for trifles and trifles for great matters, esteeming the false and belittling the true.

The Dao is not far from people; it is only that people, in pursuing the dao, distance themselves from the Dao. Hence the ancients said: those who study the dao are like cow’s hairs, while those who attain the dao are like the horn of the qilin. I say: nowadays, those who study the dao are like cow’s hairs, but those who hear the dao are like the qilin’s horn. What do I mean? In ancient times, many heard the dao, but few attained it; today, many study the dao, but few truly hear it. The number of those who study the dao today far exceeds that of the ancients, yet those who hear the dao today are fewer than those who attained it in antiquity. Thus, today’s seekers of the dao are like cow’s hairs, while those who hear it are like the qilin’s horn.

The root cause lies in the fact that practitioners are each afflicted with a partial illness in their own body, filled with pernicious qi, so they fail to resonate with their teachers and friends. Thus, they waste years in vain, laboring and trudging with empty hopes. They pour what little they receive from their masters into books with titles like “Revealing the True,” “Gathering Essentials,” “Direct Pointing,” “Meeting the Heart,” “Original Meaning,” “Guiding the Way,” “Awakening to the Dao,” and “Breaking Doubts,” hoping to find kindred spirits—and I am content with that.

Yet I still fear that learners forsake what is near to seek what is far, failing first to exhaust their own affairs, and instead rashly imagine the affairs of others. Therefore, I offer this Scripture on Passing the Barrier as a single torch of clarity to aid the learner. First, cultivate to be a person without illness; humbly ascend from the low to the high, from the near to the far. Perhaps then one will meet a wise master, encounter good friends, and hear the great Dao. Though the chapters within this book are few, the matters they concern are vast; though the words are humble, they benefit many. Though it is called “Passing the Barrier,” the功 (merit) of cultivating one’s nature and life cannot be achieved without this step. Those who see it, please do not abandon it for its plain speech.

As for the highest sages of great wisdom, who have already opened the broad road and, upon meeting a bright master, find the true without difficulty, the功 (merit) of passing the barrier is of no use to them.
