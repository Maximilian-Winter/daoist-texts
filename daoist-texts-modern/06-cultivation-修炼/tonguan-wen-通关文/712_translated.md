# The Gate of Lustful Desire

Master Lü said:  
“The form of a maiden at sixteen is like softened butter;  
At the waist she wields a sword to sever foolish men.  
Though no head falls before your eyes,  
In secret she teaches you until your marrow withers.”  

Master Qiu said:  
“To cultivate rightly, one must be cautious,  
Sweep away lustful desire and return to the true.”  
He also said:  
“Cut through the tangled vines that bind the golden sea,  
Unlock the jade lock and break free from the cage.”  

These are the great compassion and mercy of the Patriarchs,  
Teaching people to abandon lustful desire and seek the path of life.  

For lustful desire is the foremost crucial gate of life,  
The most evil and poisonous of all.  
How do we know it is the gate that threatens life?  
Whenever an ordinary person beholds beauty,  
Their soul and spirit scatter and fly away,  
The lustful heart immediately stirs.  
Once lust arises, the fire of desire ignites,  
Qi disperses and the spirit wanders.  
Though forms have not yet joined,  
The primordial essence secretly leaks away,  
Nature becomes obscured, and life begins to falter.  

How much more so in the realm of lust,  
Where day and night one craves pleasure,  
Taking suffering as joy, harm as delight.  
One day, the oil dries and the lamp is extinguished,  
Marrow exhausted, the person perishes.  
Though desire remains, death cannot be avoided.  

Therefore, those who cultivate the dao  
Must take guarding against lustful desire as their foremost concern.  
Yet lust is the hardest to eliminate, and the most difficult to guard against.  
Since time without beginning,  
People have been born from the path of lust,  
And die by the path of lust—  
Life after life, death after death,  
Mostly the calamity wrought by the demon of lust.  

This demon of lust moves both in Heaven and among men.  
Its movement in Heaven is the root dust of kalpas,  
Arising in ignorance and unconsciousness,  
Sprouting in moments without thought or care;  
Its movement among men arises when beauty is seen and passion is born,  
When circumstances are met and the spirit is carried away.  

How many heroes and mighty men of old and new,  
Facing all manner of great dangers and hardships,  
Have been able to overcome the past,  
Yet at the single gate of the demon of lust,  
All have been stopped and blocked.  
The Four Great Elements are powerless,  
Unable to struggle free or leap beyond.  
Unless one is a diamond-hard iron man, a heroic warrior,  
One cannot set it aside or cast it off.  

Those who cultivate the dao must know:  
The demon of lust is the death-demanding Yama King,  
And must be fiercely exterminated.  
Even if as beautiful as Xishi, as charming as Yang Guifei,  
They are but foul skins and bones.  
See them without stirring or wavering,  
Neither confused nor obscured,  
Meet them as if not meeting,  
See them as if not seeing,  
Ever watchful, always reflecting inwardly,  
Not allowing even the slightest desire to arise,  
Hidden deep within the heart-mind.  

Like a farmer tending fields and weeding,  
Gradually uprooting and removing.  
When the old roots are all cleared away,  
No chance remains for them to grow again.  

If indeed the root of lust is completely removed,  
Then naturally the numinous sprout will arise.  
How do we know it is completely removed?  
If truly the root of lust is gone,  
Even when encountering beauty, one does not know it as beauty;  
Even when seeing a woman, one does not recognize her as woman.  

If upon seeing beautiful women one still knows them as beautiful women,  
Even if one can forcibly suppress desire in the moment,  
There remain old roots not fully uprooted,  
And over time desire will inevitably arise again.  

Among the world’s stubborn ascetics who guard stillness and emptiness,  
They boast before others, claiming to have cut off desire,  
Yet often in dreams they leak essence, powerless to control it.  
They have eaten the food of deluded hearts, deceiving themselves and others.  
Little do they know: though they claim no desire is born,  
Desire is born within, harboring secret cravings—  
Is it so easy to cut off?  
Only because the root dust is not yet exhausted.  

Though not easy to exhaust,  
One must exert fierce, brave, and resolute effort,  
Undertaking a death-defying labor.  
If one cannot remove it but forces removal,  
If one cannot abandon it but forces abandonment,  
With deep merit and long days,  
There will come a time when it is finally removed.  

If the root of lust is uprooted,  
Then the lustful body becomes firm and strong,  
And the dharma body is easy to cultivate.  
Other gates become easier to overcome.  
If the root cannot be uprooted,  
And this gate is not passed,  
Then all other gates cannot be passed either.  

I urge those who truly seek the dao,  
Quickly open the gate of lustful desire,  
Fear lust as one fears a tiger,  
Guard against desire as one guards against a scorpion.  
Outwardly, face scenes with forgetfulness of feeling;  
Inwardly, let no desire arise.  
Guard against danger and peril,  
Nourish and maintain the spirit,  
Then hope for the dao is assured.  

Not only should those who leave home be so,  
But even those who remain in the world,  
Though involved in human affairs and extending descendants,  
Should also reduce lustful desire.  
Those who can lessen lustful desire,  
With essence strong and qi abundant,  
Their postnatal constitution is full,  
Able to ward off illness and extend life,  
And also to widely sow descendants.  

In ancient times, the Yellow Emperor and King Wen had many sons,  
All the effect of reduced desire.  
Whether at home or having left home,  
One must take guarding against lustful desire as the foremost concern.  
Otherwise, if the heart of lust is not completely removed,  
One’s false images will obscure the bright dao—  
And it will be difficult indeed.”
