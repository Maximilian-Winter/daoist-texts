# The Gate of Affection and Attachment

The *Awakening to the True* says: Though life grants a span of a hundred years, early death or fortune’s favor no one can foresee. Yesterday, one still rode swiftly through the bustling streets; today, already resting within the coffin’s embrace lies the lifeless form. Wife and wealth abandoned are not truly yours; sins and karmic debts advance, no self-deception can avail. The great elixir is not sought by chance; to encounter it yet fail to refine is folly indeed. It also says: To follow the dao, one must be fierce and resolute, a heart unyielding as iron and devoid of sentiment. Even if one has spouse and concubines, what difference is there from others? All this teaches one to view worldly affairs—affection and attachment—with detachment, to hasten the cultivation of one’s nature and life.

In this mortal world, all things are but illusions; only nature and life are real. The masses mistake the false for the true, casting aside the precious words “nature and life.” Affection and attachment bind them like garments and food. A hundred worries stir their hearts; myriad affairs exhaust their bodies. Day and night they rush about, weaving countless schemes, harming others to benefit themselves, insatiably greedy. They flee places of fire, water, and blade; they avoid tiger, wolf, smoke, and pestilence. Yet heedless of life and death, indifferent to survival or ruin, they live a busy life without rest, making long-term plans for children and grandchildren. But when spirit is spent, qi and blood decline, great illness descends, and they lie bedridden, unable to rise. Though filial sons and worthy grandsons stand by, they cannot relieve the suffering; though beloved wives and favored concubines remain, they cannot share the pain. All the lifetime’s affection and attachment come to naught here. When the three inches of breath cease, the spirit does not return. Who then was he, and who am I? Reflecting thus, what real help is there in all the lifetime’s affection and attachment?

Since there is no real help, one must know that affection and attachment are the great suffering of life, and must be seen through early. To see through them, one must first secretly probe the harms and benefits of this affection and attachment. Probe once, probe twice, and one discovers sweetness mingled with bitterness, affection laced with harm. This is the true knowledge: affection and attachment are false affairs; understanding affection and attachment as troublesome matters, one naturally no longer sets foot in the muddy mire nor rests in the fiery pit. Another master view arises within, no longer entangled by affection and attachment.

If one truly probes out the bitter flavor within affection and attachment, desiring to leave the world, then great liberation and release are attained, enabling the cultivation of nature and life without fetters or bonds. Even while dwelling in the world, one remains bright and clear, responding smoothly to all things, unharmed and unblemished. For the awakened, affection and attachment are suffering; thus, one can treat life as a grand play, free and sovereign, no longer harmed by affection and attachment.

Yet since father and son, brothers, husband and wife gather together in one grand drama, the father must enact the father’s role, the son the son’s, the elder brother the elder brother’s, the younger brother the younger brother’s, the husband the husband’s, the wife the wife’s. Each must fulfill their role, their proper part, but with the heart clear that this is but a play, a shared performance. All cooperate to bring this single drama smoothly to its conclusion, each releasing the other. In doing so, one neither harms the bonds of Heaven and Earth nor obscures one’s true nature. This is being at home while transcending home, in dust yet beyond dust—how much joy and benefit there is in this!

In ancient times, the lay cultivators Pang, Chuan, Ge Xianweng, Master Xu, Master Zhang, and the Three Mao Lords all dwelled at home yet achieved great realization of the dao. Those who dwell at home should follow thus. But for those who leave home, except for matters of serving parents, nurturing life, and accompanying death, all other affection and attachment must be severed cleanly, cast off like ropes and bonds—no trace of clinging or entanglement may remain. Even the slightest trace of attachment ruins the great work. Not only can one not cultivate the dao, one cannot even understand it. For the heart troubled by affection and attachment is disturbed. Where attachment stirs, one cannot see through affection and attachment. Where one cannot see through affection and attachment, one is blocked at the Gate of Affection and Attachment—how then to rush forward on the path?

I urge all sincere seekers of the dao: swiftly open the Gate of Affection and Attachment, free from ties and entanglements, carefree and unburdened, single-hearted in dao practice, and progress will come naturally. Otherwise, if affection and attachment cannot be relinquished and cling constantly in heart and mind, to vainly hope to understand the dao is difficult indeed.
