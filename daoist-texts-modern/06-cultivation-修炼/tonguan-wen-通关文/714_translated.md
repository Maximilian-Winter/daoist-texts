# The Gate of Honor and Nobility

The *Dao De Jing* says:  
“Though one may have jade disks to precede a team of four horses, it is not worth sitting still and advancing on this dao.”  

The Most Sage declared:  
“Wealth and honor are what people desire. But if they are not obtained by the dao, one should not dwell in them.”  

The *Awakening to the True* teaches:  
“To seek the Great Dao is to emerge from the path of confusion; even if burdened with talent and virtue, how can one be a true man without it? A hundred years of bright time flash like a spark on stone; a lifetime’s body and fate float like a bubble on water. Yet men only crave profit, salary, and seek honor and fame, neglecting their form and visage, darkened, withered, and exhausted.”  

Pause and ask:  
“If one piles up gold as high as Mount Tai, can the impermanence of life be bought and kept?”  

Master Qiu said:  
“When the heart is at peace, one does not covet the seats of the Three Dukes; when nature is settled, one is stronger than a city ten li wide.”  

All this instructs people to value dao and virtue above all, and not to be ensnared by honor and nobility.  

Honor and nobility come in two kinds: the honor of the Heavenly Rank, and the honor of the Human Rank.  
The Heavenly Rank is the honor of dao, virtue, benevolence, and righteousness;  
The Human Rank is the honor of merit, fame, salary, and official position.  

Those who seek human rank endure bitter study: ten years of cold windows, day and night exertion, forsaking sleep and food, unaware of how many thoughts are exhausted, how much spirit is consumed, before merit and fame come within reach.  

Yet even when fame is gained, its greatness or smallness is not guaranteed.  
Some bloom in talent but cannot pass the exams;  
Some pass exams but cannot advance further;  
Some advance but cannot enter office;  
Some enter office but cannot preserve life or death from loss.  

Such hardship drains spirit, dissipates qi and blood, exchanging the true for the false, all for this empty name. Where is the honor in that? Where is the nobility?  

Moreover, some fail to gain fame yet fall ill early with consumption, phlegm, asthma, breathlessness, moving with difficulty, life itself not preserved—how grievous and lamentable!  

What is called honor and nobility is but the sedan chair one sits in, the horse one rides, the silk and brocade one wears, the lamb and delicacies one eats—merely to adorn the body and fill the belly, dazzling others’ eyes and ears.  

In the end, body and mind suffer greatly, blessings are few, the great limit approaches, and at the moment of death, honor and nobility vanish as if never held, extinguished like those without honor or nobility. What honor is there in honor? What nobility in nobility?  

Those who cultivate the Heavenly Rank fill themselves with benevolence and righteousness, savor the dao and virtue, gather away flamboyance and return to simplicity, store spirit and nourish upright qi, honor virtue and dao learning.  

They refuse to exchange the true for the false, refuse to take hardship as pleasure, respect themselves and their worth, suffice and content themselves, untouched by favor or disgrace, immune to blame or praise, beyond the grasp of creation, unmoved by yin and yang, untouched by fortune or calamity.  

They complete their original nature without face or form; Heaven and Earth rejoice; ghosts and spirits revere them. Only then do they don the celestial robes, eat the heavenly salary, enjoy the heavenly lifespan—their honor and nobility enduring forever.  

Compared to the frost and dew of worldly honor and nobility, how vastly different, like clouds and mud!  

I urge those who sincerely study the dao to swiftly break open the worldly gate of honor and nobility, so as to accomplish the truly transcendent work of honor and nobility.  

Breaking open the worldly gate of honor and nobility is not to avoid honor and nobility, but to, amid the circumstances of honor and nobility, cultivate genuine effort that does not covet honor and nobility.  

Some dwell in honor and rely on honor; some live in honor and greed for honor; some leave honor yet do not forget honor; some see honor and know it as honor; some meet honor and flatter honor—all these have not truly broken open the gate.  

If one truly realizes that honor and nobility can disorder one’s nature, confuse one’s heart, inflame one’s arrogance, ruin one’s virtue, indulge one’s evil, harm one’s body, and send one’s life away—then honor and nobility are great suffering, a fiery pit, a mire.  

Only then is the gate truly broken open. One may enter honor and nobility without being harmed by honor and nobility.  

In old times, there were those who attained the dao amid honor and nobility: like Bao Qian, Huainanzi, Dongfang Shuo, Xu Jingyang, Master Mei, Immortal Elder Ge, Baopuzi, and Scholar Luo—all great recluse officials who accomplished great deeds.  

This was because they had long since seen through it, understood it thoroughly, thus planting lotuses in great fire, casting boats in muddy waters, borrowing worldly methods to cultivate dao methods, manifesting brightness and obscurity, reversing and yielding, beyond human reckoning—not out of greed for honor and nobility.  

Not only those who leave the world must see through honor and nobility, but those who enter the world and see through honor and nobility naturally have a different principle.  

If successful, they loyally serve their lord and love the people, exerting heart and strength to accomplish great governance. They are never the same as those who hold empty titles and eat without work.  

If unsuccessful, they cultivate themselves, establish virtue, and their conduct is lofty. They are not equal to the mediocre and foolish who muddle through the world.  

In old times, Yi Yin served Tang not for honor and nobility, but to awaken the people with this dao.  

Confucius traveled the states, Mencius dined with lords—not to seek honor and nobility, but to practice their dao and seek the world.  

As for Zhou, Cheng, Zhang, and Zhu, all did not covet honor and nobility; they served when able, stopped when necessary.  

Since ancient times, great sages and worthies have all valued the dao above honor and nobility, never fixating on honor and nobility.  

Foolish worldly learners cannot see through honor and nobility; some dwell in honor and cannot give it up; some lack honor and envy honor; some associate with powerful families for profit; some frequent officials’ gates as if that were honor.  

Coveting honor and nobility yet hoping to cultivate the dao, confused and muddled, with errant thoughts and scattered efforts, grasping east and fishing west—no wonder they live a busy life yet accomplish nothing by old age.  

I urge those who sincerely study the dao to swiftly break open the worldly gate of honor and nobility: those in honor forget their honor; those without honor do not envy honor.  

Value clarity of the dao as precious; regard attainment of the dao as true honor and nobility. Thus, the mind and will return to the true, and the future holds hope.  

Otherwise, the phoenix’s borrowed honor is mistaken for true honor; a single thought of honor and nobility binds the chest, blocking the spirit’s orifices, deluding oneself about the dao—how difficult that is!
