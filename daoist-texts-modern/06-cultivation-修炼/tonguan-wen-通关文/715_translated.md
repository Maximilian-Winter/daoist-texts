# The Gate of Wealth and Profit

The Most Sage declared: “The superior person understands righteousness; the petty person understands profit.” The Venerable Ancestor said: “Do not prize goods that are hard to come by.” He also said: “Do not behold what is desirable, so that the heart remains untroubled.” Master Lü said: “Piles of gold and heaps of jade fill the mountains and rivers, yet the immortals coldly laugh and surely will not gather them.” All these teachings instruct people not to covet wealth and profit, for such desires ruin great undertakings.

Yet wealth has distinctions: there is worldly wealth and there is dharma wealth. Worldly wealth consists of gold, silver, pearls, and jade; dharma wealth consists of merit, virtue, and sincerity. Those who pursue worldly wealth prize gold and silver but belittle merit and virtue. They scheme a thousand ways, plot a hundred plans, openly seize and secretly steal, harming others to benefit themselves, spending lightly while earning heavily. They lament not possessing all the wealth under Heaven for themselves alone, nor all the profits of the world for their sole enjoyment. No wealth is left unseized, no profit unsearched; they risk life and limb without care, deceive their own hearts and darken their conscience without concern.

Having ten strings of cash, they dream of a hundred; having a hundred, they dream of a thousand; having a thousand, they dream of ten thousand. Their greed is insatiable; until death, they refuse to turn back. Little do they know, when the great limit arrives, even if rich as Shi Chong, wealth like myriad mountains, they cannot buy off the Old Lord of the Underworld, nor escape the wheel of birth and death. Only sins cling to the body, borne back in full, not a single coin to carry away. At that moment, what use is regret?

There is yet another kind of deluded fool, who knows only how to hoard wealth—neither willing to spend on food nor to clothe themselves, unwilling to care for orphans and widows, ignorant of aiding the weak and rescuing the distressed. They become nothing but slaves to their wealth, miserly ghosts. Death is at the doorstep, yet they still command their descendants on how to make money, how to amass wealth. “Who owes me less? Where is my money?” Alas! When the three inches of breath cease, all is emptiness; this body no longer belongs to me, let alone wealth—how foolish indeed!

Those who accumulate dharma wealth prize merit and virtue, scorning gold and silver, looking down on all attachments, unmoved by myriad entanglements. They gather merit and accumulate deeds, enduring hardship to benefit others, widely practicing expedient means. They regard their life as precious jewels, benevolence and righteousness as gold and jade, cherishing breath to nourish spirit as their wealth and profit, preserving sincerity to safeguard truth as their riches, and purity and non-action as their family estate. As for the worldly gold, silver, and treasures, they regard them as mere stones and dirt.

For what they seek is the true treasure of the primordial Heaven, while all worldly false treasures are not worth clinging to. If a Daoist cultivator harbors even a trace of greed for wealth and profit, it obstructs the great dao. Though one practices cultivation, if the body has not yet left the dusty world, one cannot wholly abandon worldly wealth, but one should see profit in light of righteousness, follow its natural course, and not grasp greedily beyond measure. Even when encountering wealth by natural means, one must examine its origin carefully—take what may be taken, discard what must be discarded. This is what is called regarding righteousness as profit: externally one may accept, but the heart never truly seizes; what harm is there in taking?

In ancient times, Confucius traveled the feudal states, and Mencius feasted with lords—never did they refuse the gifts of their hosts, all given naturally, not forcibly demanded. Even our Patriarch of Long Spring, at first, dared not greedily seize a grain of rice or a coin; he labored his muscles and bones, starved his body and skin, endured what others could not endure, bore what others could not bear. When hardship was exhausted and sweetness arrived, he rose from misfortune to peace, favored by the emperors of Song, Jin, and Yuan, never refusing their gifts. Yet he received them to pray for rain and relieve drought, to avert disasters and support the nation, to build temples and greatly expand the teaching. All these were proper uses of wealth; indeed, first accumulating dharma wealth, then borrowing worldly wealth to establish merit.

But foolish worldly learners do not know to urgently seek dharma wealth, only valuing worldly wealth. They deceive the Ten Directions for clothes and food, shifting accounts and piling debts, yet perform no merit, accumulate no virtue, and in the next life must repay others. If they cannot even be trusted as human beings, how dare they hope for immortality?

There are yet others, heads of sin, who point east and transform west, deceiving the faithful, never doing a single good deed. Gambling and drunkenness, over mere coins, lead to petty quarrels or violent brawls. There are still false Daoists, mouths full of virtue but hearts full of theft, putting on airs, solemn as immortals. At sight of money, their masks fall away, arguing over amounts, heedless of shame.

I have often said: life and death are worth less than two hundred coins—truly so. I urge those who sincerely seek the dao to swiftly open the gate of wealth and profit, not to see profit and forget righteousness, nor let the heart grow greedy. Know this: piles of gold and heaps of jade cannot buy life or death; more wealth brings more burdens, more profit brings more harm. Better to guard the dao and die than to stray from the dao and perish—there is still benefit in that. Otherwise, when the heart clings to profit and the heart of the dao is light, evil surely prevails; to falsely imagine understanding the dao is most difficult indeed.
