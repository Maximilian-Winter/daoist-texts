# The Trial of Poverty and Hardship

The Most Sage declared: “The gentleman remains steadfast in poverty; the petty person succumbs to it — this is the great failing.” The *Doctrine of the Mean* says: “Born to poverty and lowliness, one must conduct oneself accordingly in poverty and lowliness.” Mencius taught: “Poverty and lowliness cannot move the steadfast.” The Venerable Ziyang said: “A poor man wears pearls within his robes—by nature, they shine round and bright. Yet he does not seek them himself, but counts the treasures of others.” All these teachings urge one to hold fast to the true and good unto death, to dwell in poverty and hardship without letting poverty and hardship sway one’s heart.

The Way of cultivating the true is contrary to worldly customs. Its very aim is to cast off wealth and honor, to embrace poverty and lowliness; to abandon luxury and guard tranquility and simplicity. One must first harden the heart and will, toil the sinews and bones, starve the flesh and skin, leave the body empty and bare, temper and polish oneself, cast away the false and seek the true. Even swords and spears, fire and water, illness and calamity—these are not counted at all. How much less then poverty and hardship!

If one receives poverty that cannot be borne, meets hunger and cold and gives rise to vexation, encounters difficulty and awakens ignorance, then the harm of hunger and thirst becomes harm to the heart. To nourish the petty is to be petty; to recognize the false and abandon the true is to be cut off from the Dao. When then can one reach the shore of the Way?

One does not realize that the matters of nature and life are great, while clothing and food are small matters. To value clothing and food and slight nature and life—how then can one cultivate nature and life? Those who seek clothing and food merely nourish skin and flesh; those who cultivate nature and life preserve primordial innocence. If primordial innocence is lost, though the body be fat and strong, it is like a pig or an ox—form outward, beastly heart within—living yet dead. Is this the person who pursues the Way?

In times past, the Perfected of Longspring dwelt seven years at Dragon Gate, six years by Pan Creek, always enduring hunger and starvation, unchanged until death. The Ancient Perfected of Zhaozhou Bridge sat in fixed meditation, braving hunger and cold, heedless of life and death. The Perfected of Danyang abandoned great wealth to enter Iron Check, forsook fullness and warmth to embrace poverty and plainness, covering his head with thatch, dwelling in caves and hollows. These esteemed masters bore what others could not bear, suffered what others could not suffer, and all attained the Great Way through poverty and hardship.

Yet the muddled learners of the world cannot endure unbearable hardship, cannot withstand hunger and cold; at the slightest difficulty or taste of austerity, they become vexed, resent Heaven and blame Earth, entertain evil thoughts and chaotic imaginings, fail to keep their proper role, and contrive endless schemes. With such conduct, unable to endure poverty and hardship, how could they ever pass through great dangers and grave perils?

Therefore, the learner must regard enduring bearable poverty and hardship as essential. If even a trace of fear or aversion arises, then this one matter becomes a towering mountain blocking the path, a great demon harming the Way, making it impossible to move even an inch.

I urge those with true hearts who seek the Dao to swiftly break through the gate of poverty and hardship. Let your heart be iron and stone, your will like cold ash. Live day by day according to circumstance: if hungry, so be it; if frozen, so be it; even if freezing and starving to death, so be it. Never let the small matter of poverty and hardship cause you to forget the great matter of nature and life.

Walk thus, single-minded and sincere, truly putting into practice the Way as your own charge. Those who have not yet heard the Dao will surely hear it; those who have heard the Dao will surely realize the Dao. The Patriarchs have arranged all in secret—they would never allow freezing and starvation to destroy the true Dao cultivators. Otherwise, with ample clothing and food, free and at ease, enduring some hardship and some poverty, one would vainly imagine understanding the Way—it would be difficult indeed.
