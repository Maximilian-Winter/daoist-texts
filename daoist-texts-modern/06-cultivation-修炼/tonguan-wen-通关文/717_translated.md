# The Fetters of the Corporeal Body

The Old Patriarch said: “The great calamity I suffer arises because I have a body. If I were without a body, what troubles could I have? Again he said: ‘When the body is pursued, the body leads; when the body is rejected, the body remains.’ The Diamond Sutra declares: ‘One cannot see the Tathāgata by means of the body-form.’ The Wandering Elder said: ‘You must know that the Buddha’s dharma body is originally bodiless, yet it manifests as a body adorned with marks of beauty and splendor.’ Master Linji said: ‘The true Buddha has no form; the true nature has no body; the true dharma has no image.’ Zhuangzi lamented: ‘Alas! People of the world think that nourishing the form alone suffices to preserve life. But if nourishing the form truly cannot preserve life, then what is the world good for?’ The ancient immortals said: ‘Do not cling to this body and call it the Dao; beyond this body lies the true body.’ Since antiquity, those who have attained the Dao, immortals and Buddhas alike, have never prized the corporeal body but cultivated the dharma body instead.

All people in the world recognize this corporeal body as a true treasure, and so they love it and cherish it. They desire to prolong their life and cling to it without letting go. They seek honor and fame to glorify this body, amass wealth to nourish it, feast on meat and wine to fatten it, and adorn it with fine clothes and exquisite food. Day and night they scheme and plan, constantly calculating, exhausting their heart and blood, dissipating their spirit, living as neighbors to ghosts. Though they say they cherish life, in truth they harm it.

Little do they know that the corporeal body is but the cast-off form of Heaven and Earth, a temporary union of the Four Great Elements. Once the yang qi is exhausted and the yin qi alone prevails, the soul and spirit scatter; what remains is but a lump of foul-smelling flesh, a mere mound of earth. Where then is the true? Where indeed is the real? Since it is not real, it must be false. Those who cherish the corporeal body only add falsehood upon falsehood.

Foolish students of the world vainly imagine cultivating the true, yet do not exhaust the true; they vainly imagine attaining the Dao, yet do not discern the Dao. Without exhausting the true, without discerning the Dao, without understanding what the true Dao is, they wander lost and confused, taking this corporeal body as real. They fear hardship upon this body, fear toil upon this body, fear hunger upon this body, fear cold upon this body. Warm clothes and fine food protect and cherish this body, seeking comfort and ease, avoiding all exertion and good deeds, yet recklessly engaging in matters harmful and useless on the path of life, sparing no spirit, sparing no effort, but doing what they can.

They mistake the false for the true, the empty for the real, unaware that inside and outside this body all things harm life; not one thing benefits life. The eyes rejoice at pleasant sights; the ears rage at harsh sounds; the nose loves fragrant scents; the tongue craves delicious flavors; the mind desires objects; the body fears contact. Outside are the six gates; inside are the six consciousnesses; inside and outside attack and destroy the true primordial potency.

The root cause is all summoned by the corporeal body. If there were no corporeal body, whence would arise the harm of the six gates and six consciousnesses? Moreover, all things in Heaven and Earth that have form are subject to decay. If one loves this false corporeal body and does not exhaust the true nature and life, when the great limit arrives, who am I and what is the body? The body and I are two unrelated things.

I urge those with true hearts who study the Dao to swiftly break open the gate of the corporeal body, and do not be deceived. Regard the seven orifices as mere holes, the four limbs as wooden joints, the skin and flesh as festering sores, the five viscera as lumps of disease. Abandon this corporeal body beyond the realm, and seek another true body without form, another true form without image. Only then can one extend the nature, illuminate the nature; only by abandoning the false can one seek the true; only by recognizing the false can one see the true.

Right and wrong do not coexist; good and evil do not share the same path. Otherwise, if one recognizes the false but cannot escape the false, how can one seek the true? If one cannot seek the true, how can one cultivate the true? If one loves the corporeal body and does not awaken, vainly imagining understanding the Dao, it is indeed difficult.
