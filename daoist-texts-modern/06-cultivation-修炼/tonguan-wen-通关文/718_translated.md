# The Gate of Arrogance

The *Yijing* says: “The gentleman receives others with emptiness.” It also says: “Be humble and honored, yet radiant; be lowly, yet unsurpassable.” The *Daodejing* teaches: “Not self-seeing, therefore bright; not self-righteous, therefore illustrious; not self-praising, therefore meritorious; not self-exalting, therefore enduring.” All these instruct one to humble oneself and honor others, forbidding any heart of pride or self-righteousness.

Indeed, those who study the dao must first cultivate an open heart and lowered spirit—be self-abased and small, neither full nor overflowing. See only one’s shortcomings, never one’s strengths. Be keen and eager to learn, never ashamed to ask below one’s station. Honor teachers and respect friends, utterly free of arrogance or restlessness; only then can one move the true master to point the way and the good friend to urge and encourage.

Generally, true masters and good friends do not flaunt their brilliance. If one is truly determined, one does not rely on talent nor claim ability; appearing foolish and slow of speech, the discerning eye sees at once and quietly pays heed, unwilling to abandon what is offered. Over time, tested and proven, one will be uplifted and supported.

But those who are self-conceited and self-righteous, though brilliant and learned beyond others, are simply set aside and ignored. Among the muddle-headed seekers of the world, once they enter the gate, they imagine themselves already immortals; upon seeing a master, they demand secret formulas. They do not ponder what the great dao truly is, nor what cultivation truly entails; they treat it with irreverence and disdain, foolishly hoping to pick up treasures along the way. Some dabble in fringe arts, arrogantly claiming to possess the dao. Proud and haughty, they boast of their sanctity and prowess, showing off before others. Even when meeting the enlightened, they refuse to bow their heads, missing their chance face to face.

Others have read a few Confucian texts, grasp a few phrases of meaning, and memorize some alchemical scriptures and treatises, clinging to symbols and muddy words; they fancy themselves fully enlightened, speaking grandly and arrogantly, looking down on all under heaven, refusing further instruction. Rashly they begin, creating chaos and confusion—this not only brings no benefit but invites harm. When great illness strikes, they realize their error, but no cure is at hand; regret comes too late.

There is yet another type—ignorant scholars who lean on their own learning, rashly guessing and privately debating, seeming right but really wrong. When they meet priests and monks, they challenge them with alchemical scriptures; if not answered, they declare them unorthodox. Even when meeting true masters, they show no sincerity or respect, sitting boldly and speaking recklessly without fear. Such as these, lax and self-deceiving, how can they ever catch the fragrant breeze or reach the dao’s shore?

The dao is not something to be stolen by cunning, nor creation’s secret to be seized; it transcends birth and death, escapes the wheel of reincarnation, treasured by Heaven and Earth, hidden by ghosts and spirits. Unless one is a great sage of great virtue, a person of true heart and earnest intention, who would dare lightly reveal it? Who would allow it to be lightly heard?

Moreover, the secret essence of the great dao does not lie in words. *Alchemical scriptures and treatises* are the enlightened teachings of ancestral masters through the ages, guiding later generations, expanding their understanding, so they may verify it with their masters’ eyes. They do not teach one to cling to books as the dao itself.

Those ignorant of learning often hear only the clanging sound, unable to distinguish right from wrong, like the blind leading the blind. Those who grasp some meaning often stubbornly cling to their own views, refusing to bow their heads, compounding error upon error. The root of all this illness lies in arrogance and self-sufficiency. Arrogance and self-sufficiency mean no true heart; without true heart to learn the dao, who would sincerely point the way? Is this not a vain waste of spirit, a self-ruin of great affairs?

I urge those who truly seek the dao to swiftly break open the gate of arrogance, seek out enlightened masters and good friends, and with sincere respect ask for instruction. Sweep away all faults of self-conceit, self-righteousness, self-praise, and self-exaltation; allow a little humility to be buried within, becoming a meek and lowly person. Those who have not yet heard the dao will then be able to hear it; those who have heard it will then be able to realize it.

For only by being small can one become great; only by being low can one become high; only by bending can one be straight; only by emptiness can one be full. Otherwise, with arrogance filling the chest and no one in sight through the eyes, one vainly dreams of understanding the great dao—how difficult that will be!
