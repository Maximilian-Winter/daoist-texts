# The Gate of Jealousy

The *Yi Jing* says: “The superior person cultivates friendship through mutual study.” The *Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra* states: “Before one attains liberation oneself, one should first liberate others.” The *Diamond Sutra* declares: “If a good man or good woman receives and upholds this scripture, even reciting four lines of verse and so forth, and teaches it to others, the merit accrued surpasses that of merely receiving it.” Mencius said: “To be good is to share with others, to set aside oneself and follow others, to joyfully take from others what is good.” All these speak of kindness toward others, forbidding jealousy and selfishness.

Those who cultivate the true path cultivate their nature and life. The two characters *nature* and *life* are possessed by all; each is complete and whole, neither increased by sages nor diminished by common folk. Regardless of wealth or poverty, rank or lowliness, wisdom or folly, who does not have their own nature and life? Since everyone has nature and life, then the great Dao is a common treasure; everyone can illuminate the great Dao, everyone can become immortals and Buddhas. Thus, those of sincere heart and will cultivate and verify themselves alone.

Yet the method of cultivation and verification requires seeking a wise master’s guidance and borrowing the aid of good friends. The wise master is needed to straighten and organize the main principles; good friends serve to expand one’s knowledge and insight. The wise master must be sought sincerely; good friends should be respected. For the benefit from good friends is half the work of a master. Borrowing their knowledge to supplement my ignorance; borrowing their ability to aid my incapacity—such benefit is great indeed, how can it be treated lightly? Hence the ancestral masters taught people to seek masters and visit friends.

For example, when learning the Dao with the same master, all are of one heart and one endeavor, gathering morning and evening; they must respect and love each other. When there is goodness, they encourage it together; when there is fault, they correct it together; in hardship they support each other; in sickness they care for one another. Like companions seeking wealth, pulling the boat together through storms and waves. If one does not know, the other explains; if I do not know, I ask the other to enlighten me. Mutual aid doubles the merit. Moreover, learning the Dao under the same roof is friendship of nature and life, fellowship of Dao and righteousness; it should be intimate, loving, and harmonious. What one gains is as if I gain; what one loses is as if I lose. Such are true fellow cultivators of the Dao.

The *Shijing* says: “If a person has skill, it is as if I possess it myself; if a person is a wise sage, my heart delights in them, as if their words come from my own mouth.” But worldly confused learners, without aspiration or spirit, when friends urge them on, only grow more resentful. When they have faults, and friends admonish them, they become ignorant and rebellious. Not only do they not listen, they harbor hatred. They refuse to probe the Dao’s principles, remaining long in ignorance. Seeing others diligently practice, able to understand and awaken, and the master’s joy, they secretly grow jealous. Deliberately stirring up strife, ruining good deeds. They do not regret their own incompetence, but envy others’ ability. They never consider what it means to learn the Dao.

To learn the Dao is to transform goodness and correct faults. To learn from what is not good is to move toward goodness; to learn from one’s faults is to seek to be faultless. Now, seeing others’ goodness but not knowing how to transform oneself toward goodness, while having no faults oneself yet envying others, one thereby brings about one’s own faults. With a crooked heart and crutch, day by day one declines, learning in the place of the utterly foolish and unchanging. There is yet a worse kind, ignorant of high and low, who laugh openly at others speaking of the Dao, and secretly slander those cultivating practice. Not understanding the Dao, why enter the Dao? Even entering the Dao’s gate, they do not rejoice in the Dao. Wearing the patriarch’s crown and robes, they violate the patriarch’s words and betray the patriarch’s deeds. Unaware of sin and retribution, ignorant of cause and effect—what kind of Daoist are they?

In the past, Bodhisattva Kṣitigarbha wished for all to become Buddhas before becoming a Buddha himself. Lü Dongbin wished to save all the world’s people before ascending. The Seven Perfected Masters all studied under the Emperor of Chongyang; after the emperor ascended to the perfected state, six others—Qiu, Liu, Tan, Wang, Hao, and Sun—all became disciples of Master Ma, each receiving his guidance and accomplishing great matters. Generally, learners must first hold great impartiality and selflessness, a compassionate heart to be kind to others, benefiting both others and oneself, only then can there be progress.

I urge those who truly wish to learn the Dao: swiftly break through the gate of jealousy. Embrace great unity and selflessness. Only by arduously refining and tempering oneself, respecting others’ strengths, revealing one’s own shortcomings, bowing low in action, and advancing sincerely step by step—each step taken is a merit, each deed done is a merit—holding the heart of sages and acting as sages do, will one ultimately complete the sage’s great work. Otherwise, with jealousy filling the chest, the more one learns, the worse one becomes; one cannot even be a good person, let alone aspire to sages, foolishly dreaming of illuminating the Dao—it is difficult indeed.
