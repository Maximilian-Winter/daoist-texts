# The Gate of Violent Impatience

The *Yi* says: “The superior person uses restraint to curb anger and block desire.” The *Yinfu Jing* declares: “Fire arises from wood; calamity will surely be overcome.” Zengzi said: “When the heart harbors resentment, one cannot find the proper path.” Mencius advised: “Hold fast to your resolve, but do not let your spirit flare violently.” The *Song on Understanding the Dao* sings: “Before refining the Golden Elixir, first refine your nature.” All these speak of the fiery, impatient nature—harmful to the dao—and how one must diligently strive to remove it.

Truly, those who earnestly study the dao move with the grace of a virgin, nurturing their qi as tenderly as an infant. They place softness and weakness before all else, root themselves in peace, respond to the world by yielding to things as they are, and cherish generosity and humility above all. Long ago, Shakyamuni endured five hundred kalpas as an immortal of forbearance, finally attaining Buddhahood. The Most High Patriarch of the Dao called me “ox,” and I answered as an ox; called me “horse,” and I answered as a horse—thus he became the Dao’s ancestor. The Perfected Lord of Eternal Spring once tasted human dung, hence he achieved great success. The Perfected Master Zhang Sanfeng bore endless insults from others, thus he accomplished great deeds.

All this is because their hearts longed for the dao; their nature and life were of utmost importance. External evil words, evil deeds, and all manner of adverse circumstances—they cast them all beyond their concern, becoming unaware and unknowing of them. But the muddled learners of the world do not consider why they have left home; who are those wearing the dao’s kerchief and robes? Bewildered and confused, they drift through their days. They delight in flattery, crave praise. They only love those who obey them, never yielding to others. At the slightest clash, their fiery nature flares up. From this anger arises, from this resentment is born.

They pay no heed to water and fire, blades and spears; fear not pits, wells, cliffs, or rivers. Some even fight with brute force to win, wounding each other, plunging into death’s domain, losing their very lives. But not only this: once violent impatience bursts forth, the primordial spirit flees its chamber, a great fire burns the body, fluids dry up, and the upright qi scatters. The Three Treasures are injured, the Five Virtues return to emptiness; within, the true is lost; without, virtue is ruined; nature is thrown into chaos, life’s foundation shaken. Before gaining anything from others, one has already harmed oneself. How great, then, is the harm wrought by violent impatience!

I urge those who sincerely seek the dao: swiftly open the gate of violent impatience. Become a person who can kill with qi, appear as a fool without mind. Be as simple and slow as a child, as deaf and mute as a stone. When others curse, be so. When others strike, be so. When others hate and despise, be so. Let your heart be like cold ash, your nature like frozen ice. Harbor no trace of heat within—only then can you leap beyond the gate of violent impatience. If even a little heat remains inside, though unseen outwardly, its root is truly planted within. When encountering adversity or injustice, there is no one who does not erupt fiercely.

The *Dao De Jing* says: “The highest goodness is like water. Water benefits all things yet does not compete; it dwells in places that all disdain, thus it is close to the dao.” Indeed, only by yielding to others can one rise above them; only by being weak before others can one be strong. Otherwise, if violent impatience remains unremoved, knowing only the self and not others, relying solely on strength and not on softness, acting on impulse and following desire—mistakenly imagining one understands the dao—how difficult it will be!
