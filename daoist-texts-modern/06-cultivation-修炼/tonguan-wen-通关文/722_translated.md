# Gate of Resentment and Hatred

The *Heart Sutra of Prajñāpāramitā* declares: “No ignorance, and also no cessation of ignorance.” The venerable Master Fu says: “To sweep clean the ground of the mind and intention is called the cause of the Pure Land.” Whether it be fortune or wisdom, first one must drive away greed and resentment.

Master Baizhang said: “If within the viscera and bowels there is nothing gained, nothing sought, then no dust arises in that person’s mind; no self or other arises. This is to hold Mount Sumeru within a mustard seed.” To not stir a single trace of greed or resentment is to be able to drink the ocean waters of the Four Great Elements. To not let any joy, anger, or words enter the ear, in all circumstances, neither confused nor disturbed, neither resentful nor delighted, to scrape and shave clean—this is the person of no affairs, surpassing all knowledge, understanding, diligence, and ascetic mastery.

The Knocking Yao Song says:
> If resentment is not removed, the nature does not change,  
> One falls into the sea of birth and death’s turning wheel.

All this speaks of resentment and hatred as obstacles to the dao, which must be removed with fierce effort. The two words “resentment and hatred” are like snakes and scorpions, most evil and most venomous. If they lodge in the heart and chest, accumulating over time, they become a deadly poison. They harm life and diminish vitality, bringing calamity most severe. Outwardly they harm others; inwardly they ruin oneself, yet no doctor can cure them.

The measure of the learner must be as vast and boundless as Heaven’s expanse, as pure and rich as Earth’s all-embracing nature, as tolerant as the sea that gathers all waters in homage. Then one may try to observe Heaven’s vastness: nothing is left uncovered, nothing is left unborn. The sun and moon come and go by their own course; the stars revolve by their own law; clouds and mists veil by their own will. People deceive and lie by their own will; people honor and respect by their own will; people feel gratitude by their own will; people slander and hate by their own will. All good and evil, right and wrong, fierce and dull, ignorant and vile—all proceed without knowing.

Earth’s richness and depth: nothing fails to grow, nothing fails to bear. Mount Tai, Song, and Hua, though weighty beyond measure, can carry all. Rivers, streams, and ravines, though they erode and collapse, still receive all. Trees, grasses, stones, though pressed and trampled, endure patiently. Birds and beasts, though they tread and roam, follow along. Plowing, hoeing, digging, and scraping all proceed smoothly. All insults, abuses, and destructions occur without intention.

The sea’s tolerance: countless waters converge and flow ceaselessly day and night. For a thousand years, ten thousand years, no surplus is seen. Clear water flows in but does not reveal its clarity; turbid water flows in but does not reveal its muddiness. Sweet water flows in but does not reveal its sweetness; bitter water flows in but does not reveal its bitterness. Fish, turtles, shrimp, and crabs swim freely; soft-shelled turtles, alligators, and dragons surge and gallop—this too is by their own accord. It embraces all filth, foulness, stench, and all unclean and impure things without exception.

If the learner of the dao can be like Heaven’s measure, Earth’s depth, and the sea’s breadth, then one is a person of no affairs, a transcendent who preserves the wondrous secret of life, dwelling close to the dao, with great advantage.

The confused learners of the world do not know that resentment and hatred cause the greatest harm. Sometimes resentment arises from unfavorable circumstances; sometimes from thwarted plans; sometimes from loss of possessions; sometimes from jealousy of others’ abilities; sometimes from incompatible feelings and temperaments; sometimes from insufficient clothing and food; sometimes from offenses received; sometimes from remembering others’ small faults and holding grudges; sometimes from unmet requests; sometimes from people not yielding to oneself, accumulating hatred.

All these illnesses of resentment and hatred come from one’s own dullness and ignorance, never from true heart learning of the dao. If one truly learns the dao with sincere heart, one will never be so.

Therefore, the utmost sage is thorough in self-examination but lenient in judging others. Yan Zi was offended but did not retaliate because he had no resentment or hatred—thus he was a sage and a worthy person. The people of the world have resentment and hatred, thus they are ordinary folk. The difference between sage and commoner lies only in presence or absence.

Yet resentment and hatred not only manifest outwardly to harm affairs; even hidden and subtle, if a trace of smoke or dust remains unexhausted, it can injure the true. One must strive to be clean and pure inside and out, as white as snow, as bright as a mirror. In dealing with matters and meeting people, all should be done with a mind of no attachment.

To measure spirit and qi without harm, to keep nature and temperament peaceful—then the great dao is to be hoped for.

I urge those who truly learn the dao with sincere heart: swiftly break open the gate of resentment and hatred; learn to be a person of no mind. Light things pass by, heavy things pass by; low things pass by, high things pass by. Give things to things, respond to matters as they come. Respond but do not take in; pass by but do not linger. How can resentment and hatred harm affairs?

If not so, when resentment and hatred arise, the dark poison thickens and stagnates in the heart-mind; true nature is soon obscured; false thoughts claim to understand the dao—this is difficult indeed.
