# The Gate of Cold and Heat

The Old Patriarch said: "Though one turns outward from the body, the body yet remains."  
Wen Shi declared: "In winter, one withstands the wind without feeling cold; in summer, one endures the fire without feeling heat."  
Master Lü said: "To seek life yet not be born; to learn death before dying."  

All these speak of the dao as forgetting the corporeal form, unshackled by cold or heat. For those who cultivate the dao, the first necessity is to see through the illusory transformed body, placing the colored body beyond reckoning. If one fears not death, how much less should one fear cold and heat?  

Thus, the luminous spirits of Shaolin Temple sought the dao, passing through snow piled knee-deep without a thought. In ancient times, at Zhao Zhou Bridge, the cold was endured in still meditation, even as waters rose to flood, unaware. Shakyamuni cultivated the dao upon snowy mountains, enduring countless hardships. The Patriarch of Eternal Spring, Panxi, tempered his nature, suffering hunger and cold beyond measure.  

Even in recent times, the True Man of Baishi Town, clad in tattered robes and with a soiled face, stood unbowed for years without rest. The Sleeping Immortal of Xining Prefecture lay long in water springs, naked and exposed, forty years passing as if a single day. The Immortal of Suoluo’s riverbank refined himself; the Dogskin Immortal slumbered on icy shores; Master Xianliu suffered beneath the yellow sands—all these did not avoid cold or heat, abandoning the colored body to perfect the dharma body.  

Foolish worldly learners do not know that fragrance arises from stench, sweetness comes from bitterness. They mistake the colored body for reality, cherishing and protecting it, seeking only comfort and ease. When cold comes, they seek warmth; when heat arrives, they long for coolness. Fearing cold and heat, they sever their thoughts of the dao.  

Yet they do not consider that nature and life are the foremost matters of human existence. How could one, over trifling cold and heat, mistake the great matter of nature and life? If one truly cherishes nature and life, then at the gate of birth and death, at the threshold of great calamity, one must pass through with calm detachment. As for cold and heat, what worth are they to be minded?  

Even before attaining the dao, the colored body must not be destroyed. But one may clothe oneself roughly, sheltering the body, and endure as best one can. There is no need to cling to cold or heat constantly in the mind. When cold comes, one must also endure cold; when heat comes, one must also endure heat. Cold and heat simply move in accord with the times.  

To move with the times does not mean one must suffer cold when it is not due, nor must one suffer heat when it is not due. If one insists on enduring cold when one should not, or insists on enduring heat when one should not, this is forced contrivance, stubborn and uncomprehending, bringing needless suffering. What benefit is there in this?  

In general, fear of cold and heat, though a small matter, greatly hinders the dao. If one harbors even a trace of prejudice about cold and heat, infinite evil thoughts and delusions arise. When cold comes, one schemes to avoid cold; when heat comes, one schemes to avoid heat. Mistaking the false for the true—how much harm is done!  

I urge those with true hearts who study the dao: swiftly open the gate of cold and heat. Adapt to the moment, settle your body everywhere. Cold is fine, heat is fine—so long as you do not freeze or burn to death, that is enough. Never let cold and heat give rise to ignorance.  

Otherwise, if cold and heat dwell in the heart, and the heart is filled with fear, it cannot find its proper course; if the heart is troubled with worry, it cannot find its proper course. When the heart does not find its proper course, to dispel delusions and illuminate the dao becomes difficult indeed.
