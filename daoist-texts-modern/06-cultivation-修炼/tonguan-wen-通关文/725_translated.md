# The Gate of Sloth

The *Yi Jing* says: “If one does not maintain one’s virtue constantly, one may suffer shame in due time.” It also says: “The dao of Heaven and Earth endures forever without ceasing.” The Most Sage declared: “The superior person follows the dao and walks its path; if they abandon it halfway, I cannot abide it.” The Sovereign of Double Yang said: “Fragrance arises from stench, sweetness comes forth from bitterness.” All these speak to the disciples that they must be fierce and courageous, diligent and unrelenting—not lazy, nor seeking ease and comfort.

Indeed, the study of nature and life is the greatest matter for human existence, and also the most difficult under Heaven. It demands ardent toil and earnest care, a steadfast and resolute heart; the longer and harder one perseveres, with a clear beginning and an unbroken end, only then can progress be made. For such a great undertaking of eternal constancy, it is only through enduring and unceasing great功 (merit) that it is accomplished.

Some build bridges and repair roads to benefit others; some dispense medicine and offer tea to aid the urgent; some restore temples and erect shrines to encourage goodness; some pity the aged and care for the poor to accumulate virtue; some support the weak and rescue the distressed to relieve hardship; some labor in teaching and in the dao, raising great dust and toil; some devote their hearts and exert功, casting off worldly affairs entirely; some, because the true principle is unclear, exhaust day and night in inquiry; some, lacking a wise master, search east and west; some, encountering disaster and hardship, double their resolve. Whenever they see a single good deed, they immediately do it; whenever they see a single evil, they immediately avoid it. Moment by moment they strive, every instant they apply功. Every inch of time is cherished, never allowing a moment to pass idly.

Naturally, from humble beginnings one ascends to heights, from the shallow to the deep; like a crane standing among chickens, one eventually gains the gaze and regard of the exalted. Yet worldly fools, these muddle-headed learners, establish no功, cultivate no virtue, only seeking comfort and fearing hardship. They shun any task that requires effort, retreat from places where功 is practiced. They gorge themselves all day, with no care or thought; they wander idly, empty and unreal.

When they meet a wise master, they foolishly imagine that a word or two will bring sudden enlightenment, a great awakening. Outwardly they appear honest, but within they harbor a thieving heart. They refuse to carefully probe the principles, nor do they undergo the forging and tempering of the classics. After three mornings and two evenings, failing to obtain the secret, they deem themselves without fate and promptly depart. There is yet another kind, the sinful and blameworthy men, who do not blame their own lack of resolve but instead slander their master as stingy, nursing grudges in their hearts that never cease their whole lives. Such conduct shows neither enduring resolve nor true heart for the dao. Not only is it difficult for them to ascend to Heaven, but they fall into Hell instead.

I urge those who truly seek the dao with sincere hearts to swiftly break through the gate of sloth. Broadly accumulate hidden virtue, measure your strength and perform功 accordingly. Outwardly benefit others, inwardly refine yourself. Morning and evening, hold your nature and life as paramount; keep this ever in mind, treating body and mind as your charge. Step by step exert effort, everywhere move forward, unchanging until death. In time, there will be a day of breakthrough, a moment of success. Otherwise, hesitating and faltering, lazy and muddled, wasting years, small hardships prevent great功 from being carried out. How then can one achieve the rare and great matters of becoming immortal or Buddha? To vainly imagine mastering the bright dao, transcending human and Heaven, and escaping the sea of suffering—that is truly difficult indeed.
