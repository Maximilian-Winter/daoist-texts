# The Gate of Talent and Wisdom

The *Yijing* says: “Labor and humility—when the superior person perseveres to the end, good fortune follows.” The Most Sage declared: “If one possessed the talent and grace of Duke Zhou, yet was proud and stingy, all else would be unworthy of regard.” The Venerable Ancestor said: “Great accomplishment appears as if incomplete, yet its use never fails; great fullness seems empty, yet its use is inexhaustible; great straightness seems bent; great skill seems clumsy; great eloquence seems hesitant.” All these speak of possessing talent without displaying it, having wisdom without employing it—only thus can one perfect one’s talent and complete one’s wisdom.

What is talent? It is cleverness and skillful craft. What is wisdom? It is planning, deliberation, and adaptability. Talent is what the world cherishes most. Especially since fame and rank cannot be achieved without talent and wisdom; wealth and goods cannot be obtained without them. In dealing with the world and meeting others, talent and wisdom are always foremost.

Yet, in truth, everyone is endowed with talent and wisdom but loses their life because of them—only people have not pondered this deeply. For they use talent and wisdom to seek fame and profit, laboring their minds day and night, ensnared by fame and profit. They know only how to advance, not how to retreat; know only blessings, not calamities. They exhaust their essence and spirit, compete fiercely and crave victory, overthink until their vital fluids dry up, and their bodies weaken. Even before gaining fame and profit, their very life is lost. Is this not using talent and wisdom, yet being harmed by talent and wisdom?

Foolish learners of the world do not know that talent and wisdom cause the greatest harm. Every move and action relies on their little cleverness, feigning quickness, boasting before others, thinking none surpass them. Some rely on talent and look down on all; some use wisdom to scramble for food and clothing; some argue fiercely over right and wrong to bully their elders; some speak strange words and commit sins to confuse the masses; some memorize a few legal cases to deceive others; some compose a few poems and songs to pride themselves on having the Way; some learn a few affected tricks and lead the blind to lead the blind.

Some stubbornly cling to their views, taking male and female as yin and yang, leading others into sin and falling into traps; some treat the Golden Elixir as something tangible, wasting money and leading people to burn and refine. All these are relying on talent and wisdom, misusing cleverness, peering through a narrow tube, measuring with a ladle—walking paths in the dark of night, living in a dried-up well.

Little do they know that those who truly yearn for the Dao abandon cleverness and destroy wisdom, conceal brightness and nurture obscurity. They do not seek prominence in worldly ties, nor compete in mundane affairs. With one pure thought, they know nothing of the myriad things. They seek wise teachers, visit good friends, treating life itself as the greatest matter. Honest and simple, plain and sincere, they use not a shred of false talent or false wisdom.

I urge those who truly study the Dao: swiftly open the gate of talent and wisdom. Sweep away the false talent and wisdom used outwardly; turn instead to the true talent and wisdom used inwardly. Erase all partial ailments—striving and competing, self-willed arrogance, wild guessing and private opinions, making something from nothing, filling emptiness with false fullness, and so forth—with a single stroke. Change your face and head, enter with sincerity, use with softness; then perhaps there is hope in learning the Dao.

Otherwise, relying on one’s own greatness, knowing only oneself and not others, trusting talent and using wisdom, scheming and deceitful—though one wishes to advance, one falls behind. To vainly imagine understanding the Dao is difficult indeed.
