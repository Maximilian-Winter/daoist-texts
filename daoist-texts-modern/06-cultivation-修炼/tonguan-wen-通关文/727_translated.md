# The Gate of Yielding to Nature

The *Dao De Jing* says: “Those who see themselves are not enlightened; those who deem themselves right are not distinguished.” The ancient scriptures declare: “Those who cling stubbornly are blind to the Dao and virtue.” Mencius said: “Turning inward with sincerity, there is no greater joy; acting with strong forgiveness, there is no closer pursuit of benevolence.” The *Book of Songs* sings: “With noble virtue and noble bearing, one moves with utmost care and reverence.” All these teachings instruct people to follow feeling and principle in their conduct, not to yield blindly to their own nature or cling stubbornly.

After birth, each person holds within them the innate temperament granted by the later Heaven—wise or foolish, good or evil, pure or turbid, strong or weak—each differing from the other. Only the Heaven-bestowed sage is born with a nature perfectly round and bright, pure white without flaw. Next come those of middling or lower rank, each bearing their own partial ailments within. Truly, these are the great harms to one’s nature and life.

Though great harms, if one can truly know oneself, one can also transform temperament: turning foolishness into wisdom, evil into goodness, turbidity into clarity, weakness into strength. This is to not yield blindly to one’s nature, but to draw near those who follow the dao, humbly seeking instruction. Borrowing another’s brilliance to shatter the web of one’s confusion; borrowing another’s sharpening stone to remove one’s own flaws. Indeed, stones from other mountains can polish jade. Gradually practicing, one rises higher; gradually learning, one grows better. Though once foolish, one will surely become enlightened; though once soft, one will surely become strong. Why fear that the dao will not be clear, or that cultivation will not succeed?

Yet in this world, muddled learners do not know the harm of yielding blindly to nature. They desire to learn the dao, yet indulge their nature, unwilling to improve; they wish to learn the dao, yet yield to their nature, not esteeming the dao. Sometimes they obey their teachers’ instructions in form only, while secretly disobeying; sometimes friends admonish them, yet they agree outwardly while dissenting inwardly; sometimes they work alongside others, yet act arrogantly as if they alone are mighty; sometimes they live with others, yet quarrel over strength and pride; sometimes they rely on their own learning to belittle others’ faults; sometimes they trust their own cleverness to mock others’ foolishness; sometimes they speak harshly, refusing to yield; sometimes they stumble and clash, breeding vexation; sometimes they bully the weak and cannot harmonize with the crowd; sometimes their minds are narrow and petty, unable to embrace others.

All these are the evils of yielding blindly to nature. Not only do they earn others’ dislike outwardly, but inwardly they sow dark poisons. Their lifelong partial ailments remain unremoved; their foolish airs remain undiminished. They think themselves right, refusing to admit error. With such a heart, even if they study the dao face to face with Laozi, or dwell alongside Shakyamuni, what benefit would there be?

If one is truly a man of the dao, one’s heart is wholly devoted to it. Sitting quietly, one constantly reflects on one’s own faults; in idle talk, one does not discuss others’ faults. In all things one is cautious; at every step one inspects carefully; one follows others and follows principle; one adapts to circumstances, neither rigid nor self-centered. Taking retreat as progress, taking gentleness as great strength—how could one not advance deeply in cultivation?

I urge those who sincerely seek the dao: swiftly break open the gate of yielding blindly to nature. Bow your head in action, be soft and gentle in dwelling. Gradually shed all past stubbornness and partial ailments, all self-righteous and self-centered clauses. Learn to be a person without fixed nature, play the fool, the deaf, the mute, the dullard—always attentive to matters of great personal importance. In time, you will surely gain. Otherwise, if you blindly yield to nature, rigid without softness, erring without correction, even if you spend a lifetime in the dao’s gate, vainly you will dream of hearing the dao.
