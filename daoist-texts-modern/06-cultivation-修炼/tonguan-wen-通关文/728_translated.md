# The Trial of Calamity

The *Book of Changes* says: “When beset yet not losing one’s place, there is success. Is this not the mark of the superior person?” The *Doctrine of the Mean* teaches: “One has long been troubled by calamity; one walks steadfastly through calamity.” The Perfected of Eternal Spring declares: “Sickness teaches one how to face sickness; death teaches one how to face death. At the final moment, one embraces the Dao and passes beyond.” All these speak to the truth that one must not alter one’s original resolve because of calamity.

The Dao enfolds Heaven and Earth, secretly seizes the workings of Creation, passes through death into life, transcends the mundane to enter the sacred, becoming Buddha and immortal. This is no task for the faint-hearted, no feat for the weak. Only a man of great courage and mighty strength—one who stands firm beneath Heaven and Earth, a diamond beyond dust and worldliness—can bear it. The ignorant cannot grasp it; the unsteady cannot carry it; the hesitant cannot wield it.

What then is great courage and great strength? It is to remain unmoved by wealth and honor; unshaken by poverty and lowliness; unbent by power and might—this is great strength. It is to be unentangled by affection and love; untempted by fame and profit—this is great strength. It is to rise above sorrow, fear, and dread without a tremor—this is great strength. It is to cast aside joy, anger, grief, and delight utterly—this is great strength.

To be unmoved and unshaken amid hardship and peril is great courage; to accept illness and disaster as nature’s course is great courage; to endure hunger, cold, and starvation, unchanging even unto death, is great courage; to be unaware of shame and insult is great courage.

Thus, when the Buddha Shakyamuni met King Kālī, he cut his own flesh without a flicker of awareness; when the Pure Yang Elder encountered the Patriarch of True Yang, he was tested ten times without flaw; Purple Clarity scolded and cursed but taught without anger; Master Sanfeng wore tattered clothes and worn shoes without regret; the Perfected of Eternal Spring received blows without contesting; the Perfected of Eternal Spring had three ribs broken and did not look back.

These sages and immortals all faced the forge of calamity, enduring boundless suffering, so that in the end they could hear the great dharma, illuminate the great Dao, transcend the mundane to enter the sacred, and accomplish their rare and magnificent deeds.

Yet worldly fools and confused learners do not know that calamity is the great medicine for cultivating truth, the furnace and hammer for achieving the Dao. Instead, they fear calamity and flee from it. They suffer a little hunger or cold and invent other teachings; they encounter some illness and give rise to wild thoughts; they meet danger and think to retreat; they suffer insult and immediately argue.

Little do they know that true gold must be refined in great fire; the lotus flower must grow from the mire. Without fire, gold’s brightness cannot be seen; without mud, the lotus’s purity cannot be known.

What then is calamity? Only through calamity can one see the heights and depths of a person’s station; only through calamity can one test the truth or falsehood of one’s resolve.

I urge those who sincerely seek the Dao: swiftly open the gate of calamity. Firmly recognize the two words “life and death.” Life is this; death is this. All great disasters and calamities, all great hardships and dangers, entrust them to Heaven, meet them with a heart of nonattachment. Over time, misfortune naturally transforms into blessing, disaster into fortune.

Otherwise, when calamity comes and one fears calamity, the mind becomes unsettled, the will shifts. Without calamity one brings calamity upon oneself; small calamities swell into great ones; one’s wild thoughts obscure the bright Dao—how difficult it becomes!
