# The Gate of Guizha (Deception)

The *Yi Jing* says: “Wash but do not present.” The *Shi Jing* says: “The numinous stirs the thoughts; they cannot be measured, much less be pierced.” The *Jade Pivot Scripture* declares: “Enter with sincerity.” The *Cantong Qi* states: “The filial son applies his heart, moving the Supreme Pole.” The Master Shangyang said: “Though Heaven may sometimes seem to turn away, one must seek it with treasures of pure sincerity.” All these speak to the earnest heart at work, forbidding even the slightest trace of guile, deceit, or falsehood.

For those who study the dao, the treasure lies in a true heart and genuine intent. Only by humbling oneself and lowering one’s stance can one move the true master, win the trust of worthy friends, and receive their blessings. When I have a true heart, my teacher and friends respond with true hearts; when I have genuine intent, they meet me with genuine intent. This mutual resonance is a fixed and unchanging principle. But if one cannot bring true heart and genuine intent, and instead deals in cunning deceit and falsehood—appearing one way while thinking another, imagining one can fool the wise—how little they understand! The true master’s clear mirror shines far and wide, instantly discerning truth from falsehood. To deceive others is truly to deceive oneself; to hide from others is truly to hide from oneself. Not only does this bring no benefit, it utterly ruins the endeavor. What good is guile and deceit?

In the world, foolish learners abound—foolish in entering the path, foolish in studying the dao. They treat their very nature and life as trivial, and the pursuit of the dao as a common affair. When meeting a true master, they ask about the primal gate; when seeing fellow seekers, they boast of profound mysteries. Yet they know nothing of honoring the master’s principle or respecting the way of friendship. Some insult with lies and deceitful words; some feign false feelings and hollow intentions to decorate their speech; some craft clever phrases and flattering countenances merely to win favor; some point east while painting west, luring others into revealing secrets; some recline askance, leaning lazily to pose difficult questions; some seek formulas after one meal; some sit opposite and engage in lofty debate; some bear grudges after slight trials; some flee at the first hardship; some skim scriptures, glance at grand meanings, and pass on; some hear the master’s words without tasting their flavor, merely memorizing phrases; some outwardly study the dao while secretly scheming other things; some resolve to cultivate, then turn and entangle themselves in worldly passions. Such ailments are countless.

How then can they move the true master’s guidance or receive the support of good friends? I urge those who truly seek the dao: swiftly break through the gate of guile and deceit, and exchange it for a heart of utmost sincerity. Progress from a place of truthfulness, and never harbor the slightest thought of cunning or falsehood. To deceive others is to deceive oneself, and to mislead oneself is to ruin one’s future. For the single word sincerity can move Heaven and Earth, penetrate ghosts and spirits, and stir all beings. Is there a master or friend who cannot be moved by it? If one can move master and friend, then the great dao is within hope. Otherwise, even a hint of falseness or deceit means the heart is not sincere. When the heart is insincere, a great illness arises within the mind’s chamber; not only can one not seek the true, one actually obscures it. To vainly imagine understanding the dao—how difficult indeed!
