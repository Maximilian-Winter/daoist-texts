# The Gate of Doubt and Speculation

The *Ancient Scripture* says: “If one has no master to point the way, the celestial immortals above have no dwelling place.” The *Awakening to the True* states: “Even if you are cleverer than Yan Hui, without meeting a true master, do not force conjecture.” It also says: “To know where the secret formula penetrates the primordial source, one must discuss it carefully with the immortals themselves.” Master Sanfeng said: “The fullness of the moon lies within the secret formula; when the hour strikes the Rat, the marvel lies in heart transmission.” He further said: “Bow to a bright master, ask about the method; to begin swiftly yet properly is still too slow.” All these speak to the necessity of master’s transmission of the dao—one cannot grasp it by reckless guessing or private speculation.

For the Great Dao is profound and mysterious, vast enough to fill the cosmos, subtle enough to enter the tiniest hair’s tip. Its vastness has no outside, its minuteness no inside. If one can cultivate it, one may seize upon creation itself, transcend yin and yang, understand life and destiny, become immortal or Buddha, enduring as long as Heaven and Earth, shining as brightly as sun and moon. It is prior to Heaven and yet Heaven does not oppose it; it is after Heaven and yet follows Heaven’s timing. No heterodox or sideline path can compare.

Yet the dao has inner yin and yang, outer yin and yang; inner Five Phases, outer Five Phases. There is the true and the false; the false within the true, the true within the false; the true within the true, the false within the false. Cultivation requires the right timing, proper sequence; there is the realm of doing and the realm of non-doing; there is the beginning order and the ending order; there is gathering herbs, combining herbs, forming the elixir, ingesting the elixir, forming the embryo, shedding the embryo. The matters are manifold, the methods not uniform. If not for a clear master to distinguish each step from beginning to end, to instruct carefully and precisely, it is difficult to know by oneself.

Though one may have studied with many true ones, read alchemical scriptures and secret books, learned countless analogies and myriad descriptions, mastered herbs and fire’s timing—all may be complete. Yet the primordial subtlety of the dao, its delicate workings, cannot be fully expressed in words, nor fully grasped in discussion. How much more so when using the manifest to explain the unmanifest, employing images to point to the formless!

Moreover, in later generations, blind fools borrow the names of ancestral masters to fabricate recklessly, slander the sacred dao, confuse the immortal scriptures, mixing truth and falsehood. If one relies on one’s own knowledge and views, thinking one has attained, without verifying with the enlightened, one falls into the net and can hardly escape for a lifetime. Even those clever and talented, discerning right from wrong, gaining some insight, have only a head without a tail, seeming so yet not so. How can they truly know and see clearly, grasping one to understand a hundred?

The muddled learners of the world do not know the depths of the dao, nor the weight of life; with the light of a firefly, they wish to break the net of Heaven’s confusion. They seek no true master, relying only on themselves. Some read heterodox books, memorizing tricks, holding fast for life, unbreakable, wasting their years. Some see the genuine scriptures of the ancestral masters, recite day and night without probing their meaning, recognizing only their images. They see talk of herbs, furnaces, and cauldrons, suspecting mere burning and refining; they hear of male and female yin and yang, guessing it means inner elixirs; they see dragons, tigers, turtles, and snakes, suspecting organs of heart, kidney, liver, lung; they hear of reversed and inverted movements, guessing ascent and descent confused; they see precious pearls, suspecting tangible objects; they hear of the sacred embryo, guessing condensed qi and blood; they hear of purity and stillness, suspecting simply spirit preservation and breath settling; they hear of doing, guessing fabrication; they hear of non-doing, guessing emptiness and silence. Such are countless examples—all striking confusion and wild guessing, ending in emptiness and falsehood.

I urge those with true hearts seeking the dao: swiftly break open the gate of doubt and speculation. Cast away all your pride in talent and skill, seek a true master, and have the mysteries illuminated. Never rely on your own false cleverness to recklessly debate and guess, deceiving only yourself. Otherwise, without verification from others, seeking only within yourself, whether searching outside or fabricating within, your attempt to cultivate the dao will be difficult indeed.
