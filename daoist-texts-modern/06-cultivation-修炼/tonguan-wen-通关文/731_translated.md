# The Gate of Suspended Emptiness

The Confucians say: “Truth lies in genuine practice.”  
The Buddhists say: “When walking deeply the perfection of Prajñā.”  
The Daoists say: “Be courageous, vigorous, and diligent.”  

The sages of the three teachings all prize the true heart and practical use, and none would employ empty suspension to accomplish their tasks. The way of cultivating the true is the study of exhausting principle, fulfilling nature, and reaching destiny. To exhaust principle is to thoroughly investigate this truth; to fulfill nature is to completely embody this truth; to reach destiny is to arrive at this truth. When one has exhausted, fulfilled, and reached—these all being true—then no false or mixed elements may intrude therein. This is clear. Should even a trace of falsity mingle within, the heart will not be focused, and one’s conduct will lack strength.

How then to pierce into the cavern of principle and behold the true treasure?  
How to move the true master to joy and have him point out the path of principle?  

Thus the ancient sages, upon hearing a single good word or seeing a single good deed, were like rivers breaking through dams—unstoppable and overwhelming. The Daoist school has three vehicles of method: those who pursue the highest vehicle are the wisest, quick to comprehend, instantly grasping the essence, born knowing and at ease in practice; those who pursue the middle vehicle are of middling wisdom, understanding through images and meanings, hearing one and knowing two, learning and then knowing, benefiting and then acting; those who pursue the lowest vehicle are of lesser wisdom, laboring intensely in research, only gaining depth through effort, struggling in study, and forcing themselves in action. The three vehicles of method depend on one’s measure of strength to act accordingly.

Yet, though divided into three grades, all must apply effort grounded in reality. If one suspends emptiness without substance, neglecting concern even slightly, not only those of middle and lower rank will gain no progress, but even the wisest will fall into void and futility. In former times, Bodhidharma practiced under the long hut, sitting cold in Shaolin; Huineng labored in Huangmei, enduring the four assemblies of grinding; Patriarch Qiu spent seven years at Dragon Gate, six years at Panxi, purifying body and breaking ribs, doubling his resolve. Like these sages and worthies, all acted with true heart and sincere intention, thus transcending the mundane and entering the sacred, accomplishing great matters.

Yet in this world, foolish learners, having entered the Daoist gate, do not know what they seek, muddling through their days. They always scheme over food and drink, wandering daily amid disputes of right and wrong, mingling with fox friends and dog gangs, mouths uttering idle talk, hearts tangled in trifles. Their eyes do not look upon the Master’s words of the dharma; their ears do not listen to the wise and good speech. Even when reciting scriptures, it is but like a horse running past flowers—never applying heart or thought to seek the deep meaning. Even when encountering a bright master to listen and learn, it is like autumn wind passing the ear, no effort made to savor the taste. Worse still are the rank fools who disdain the elixir scriptures for lacking secret formulas, refusing to look upon them. When they chance upon a wise one, they wish to take the way casually; failing to obtain it, they retreat. Today they seek Wang, tomorrow they bow to Li; suddenly learning this, suddenly learning that, their purpose unsettled, their resolve fleeting. When have they ever regarded nature and destiny as the great matter? Often a lifetime in the Daoist gate passes with no accomplishment—how lamentable, how pitiable!

I urge those with true heart who study the Dao to swiftly break open the Gate of Suspended Emptiness. With dead heart and firm ground, daily keep watch over nature and destiny; at every moment, attend carefully to principle and meaning. One by one, correct all suspended emptiness and unreal actions. First exhaust its principle, then seek its master. Be broadly learned, carefully questioned, cautiously thought, clearly discriminated, and earnestly practiced. What fear is there that the great Dao will remain unclear, or that nature and destiny will not be understood? Otherwise, suspended emptiness and unreality, reckless conduct, wasted years, unfocused heart, unachieved resolve—foolishly imagining clarity of the Dao—will be difficult indeed.
