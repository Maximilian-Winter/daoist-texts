# The Barrier of Delusive Thought

The Awakening to Truth says:  
In the midst of confusion, one seeks form;  
Within the depths of obscurity, one searches for the true essence.  
Being and non-being intertwine and enter each other—  
Yet before seeing, how can one imagine completion?  

It further says:  
The Song of the Treatise on Accord speaks of the utmost truth,  
But does not fix the timing upon mere words.  
To grasp the secret formula fully,  
One must carefully discuss it together with the spirit.  

The Perfected of the Vast Void says:  
What others say cannot be practiced by me;  
What I practice cannot be spoken by others.  

All these speak to the fact that the dao requires true knowing and actual practice—  
It cannot be attained by empty, delusive thought alone.  

For the dao is most supreme and most precious,  
Exceedingly lofty and vast,  
Profound and mysterious beyond measure.  
One must labor with meticulous discernment,  
From the shallow to the deep,  
From the near to the far,  
Deep cultivation will naturally yield realization.  

How could one illuminate it by delusive thought, by fragments of words,  
Or complete it in one or two steps?  
Only a man of utmost greatness and magnitude,  
Engaged in the most exalted and vast endeavor,  
Can accomplish it.  

The dao dwells between Heaven and Earth;  
Everyone has a share of it, yet no one can fully grasp it.  
Everyone has a share because all are born holding the qi of yin and yang and the Five Phases;  
Within the body lies the principle of yin and yang and the Five Phases,  
The head of all things—principle and qi complete.  
Who lacks a dao? Who lacks a nature and life?  

With this dao and this nature and life,  
One can comprehend the dao,  
Perfect this nature and life,  
Become sage and worthy,  
Transform into immortal and Buddha.  
Therefore, it is said that everyone has a share.  

Yet no one can because people are lost in worldly feelings,  
Bewildered by fame and profit,  
Tied by love and affection,  
Recognizing the false and abandoning the true,  
Unable to establish aspiration,  
Unable to raise spirit,  
Unable to wield power.  

They follow their desires,  
Letting the conscious spirit wreak havoc.  
When they try to advance, they retreat instead;  
When they wish to do good, they think to do evil.  
Thus it is said that no one can.  

If one is truly a man of worth,  
One values nature and life above all,  
Earnestly discerns matters,  
Bravely presses forward,  
Consistent from beginning to end,  
Resolute in intention and thought,  
Exhaustively investigates principles,  
Seeks teachers and visits friends,  
Truly walks the path and practices,  
Each step taken is a step forward,  
Each deed done is a deed completed,  
Day and night without slackening,  
Moment to moment with focused mind,  
Only attending to one’s own affairs,  
Not anticipating others’ matters,  
Accumulating merit and practice,  
Bending oneself and honoring others.  

As for illuminating and realizing the dao,  
One listens to its natural unfolding,  
Follows the heavenly conditions,  
Never indulges in delusive thought.  

Even if in this life one has no merit or blessing,  
Though the great dao is hard to know,  
One does not blame Heaven or resent others,  
Persisting until death.  
With such a heart and established aspiration,  
The Patriarchs arrange all in secret.  

The confused learners of the world,  
Who have not yet resolved their own affairs,  
Drift through days, only seeking good food and fine clothes.  
By day they wander idly,  
By night they sleep soundly and deeply.  

They do not practice skillfully,  
Do not create merit,  
Nor are they willing to discern principles,  
Nor willing to seek clear teachers.  

They learn some trivial words and phrases,  
Twist and turn in their efforts,  
Feign cultivation in body and mind,  
Delusively imagining themselves immortal.  

Little do they know that the study of nature and life  
Is a power that steals the workings of creation,  
A method that overturns Heaven and Earth,  
That must be transmitted by heart,  
Not to be guessed at privately,  
Nor to be practiced recklessly.  

Those who truly attain it,  
Hold and cultivate it,  
Can become disciples of Heaven,  
Partners of Earth.  
Is this something easily known or readily understood?  

Since ancient times, the Patriarchs who became true ones  
Do not know how many hardships they endured before meeting true teachers;  
Do not know how many trials they suffered before hearing the dao;  
Do not know how many dangers they passed before realizing the dao.  

Is it that they did not do real work,  
But by empty, delusive thought alone could know and accomplish?  

Empty, delusive thought—  
Just this one thought—  
Is the root of sin that cannot illuminate the dao.  

If the dao cannot be illuminated,  
How can one hope to accomplish it?  

I urge those with true hearts for the dao:  
Quickly break through the barrier of delusive thought.  
Stabilize your footing;  
Whether learning or practicing the dao,  
Put forth effort step by step,  
Apply yourself moment by moment,  
And naturally, bitterness will end and sweetness will come.  

Those who have not yet heard the dao will then hear it;  
Those who have heard the dao will then realize it.  

Otherwise, if real work is not done,  
Words do not heed deeds,  
Deeds do not heed words,  
Delusive thought makes illuminating the dao difficult indeed.
