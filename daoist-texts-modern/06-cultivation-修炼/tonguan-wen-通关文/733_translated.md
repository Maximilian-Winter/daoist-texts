# The Gate of Life and Death

Zhuangzi said: The true men of old neither rejoiced in life nor loathed death. When they emerged, they did not exult; when they returned, they did not resist. They came forth with a light, untroubled ease—and that was all. The Most Sage declared: “To hear the dao in the morning, to die by evening—this is enough.”  

In the Postscript to Awakening to the True, it is said: This dao is supremely subtle and wondrous. Yet the roots and nature of the common people are muddled and dull; they cling to their embodied selves, delighting in life and fearing death, and thus find it hard to truly awaken. All this teaches that in discussing learning the dao and cultivating the dao, one must not harbor a heart greedy for life or afraid of death.  

For life is born with a body, originally a temporary assemblage of the Four Greats—no true creation from nothing, but a conjured phantom form. It is the entrusted thing of Heaven and Earth: where there is birth, there must be death; where there is completion, there must be decline. How could this be something truly eternal and imperishable? Since it is subject to decay, then life and death too belong to the realm of the false.  

The Patriarchs teach those who would understand life and death to bring life and death into unity, reaching a state of no birth and no death—only then. Zhuangzi spoke of “gathering the spirit to prolong life,” and “forgetting the spirit to have no birth.” Thus the way of longevity is still not the utmost achievement of understanding one’s nature and fate. One must come to forget birth and non-birth, neither born nor extinguished—that is the true mastery of life and death, transcending the transformations of birth and death.  

For Heaven and Earth can command the manifest form, but cannot command the unmanifest; can command the qi that has shape, but cannot command the qi without shape; can command the mind that has form, but cannot command the mind without form. Without mind, there is no qi; without qi, there is no form. To have no mind toward life and death, so that life and death cannot bind—this is to approach the dao.  

The confused seekers of this world, who vainly imagine themselves to have attained the dao, all do so because they fear death. To fear death is to have a heart that seeks life. Once there is a heart that seeks life, some fear starving to death, some fear freezing to death, some fear dying of illness, some fear premature death. Some climb lofty mountains, afraid that wolves or tigers will come to harm them; some enter dense forests, afraid that pythons or vipers will bite; some lodge at ancient altars, afraid that ghosts and spirits will invade.  

The heart greedy for life and afraid of death dwells in the secret recesses, trembling and unsettled. Though the body remains, the heart is lost beforehand; the seedling of life’s breath has withered, the root of death’s breath has taken hold. Stone will not dissolve, firewood piles up in the chest; schemes and plots arise in confusion; spirit heads and ghostly faces, a thousand evils and a hundred monsters, swarm and disturb, grinding down the spirit. The true is all lost, the false all arise; day by day, night by night, damage mounts—how can one avoid death?  

I urge the true-hearted who study the dao to swiftly open the gate of life and death, to place the two words “life” and “death” beyond reckoning. To learn death before dying is to live without knowing life. Life is as it will be; death is as it will be. Starving to death is as it will be; freezing to death is as it will be; harmed by wolves or tigers is as it will be; bitten by snakes is as it will be; invaded by ghosts and spirits is as it will be. Even disaster by water or fire is as it will be; even harm by sword or spear is as it will be; even dying of illness is as it will be.  

Like a dead person, not knowing, not recognizing, leaving it all to Heaven’s decree. Only the single word “dao” is always hung before the breast, from beginning to end, never forgotten through long time. The Patriarchs secretly protect and guard, unwilling to let true learners suffer ruin. Otherwise, the heart greedy for life and afraid of death pushes forward and pulls back—this very gate is tightly locked and sealed, allowing no inch of movement. To vainly imagine understanding the dao—how difficult it is!
