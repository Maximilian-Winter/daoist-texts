# The Gate of Self-Satisfaction

The Book of Changes says: “Xun is beneath the bed; employing the shaman’s chaotic rites brings good fortune.” The *Dao De Jing* teaches: “Empty your heart, fill your belly.” Master Shangyang said: “The Dao has three warnings.”  

First, those who study the dao, though their hearts yearn toward it, grow proud of their wealth and honor, refusing to humbly inquire. They seem indifferent and careless—this is called cunning and deceit; warn them and withhold.  

Next, those who study the dao have only heard faint rumors of side-door minor methods, yet insist on arguing fiercely to display their private cleverness—this is called boasting and dazzling; warn them and withhold.  

Third, those who study the dao are half in doubt and half in belief, who do not regard life and death with concern, who value wealth over their own bodies—this is ignorance of destiny; warn them and withhold.  

All these speak to the truth that only by not being full, not being brimming, can one receive benefit.  

The great dao of the sages and worthies is boundless and endless, without edges or shores. It has form and function, root and branch, subtle gradations, and distant undertakings. The higher you gaze, the loftier it grows; the deeper you probe, the firmer it stands.  

One person’s knowledge is limited; the opinions of many are infinite. Without the ability to humble oneself before others, one cannot learn; without the ability to bend before others, one cannot understand; without the ability to show one’s own emptiness, one cannot advance; without the ability to honor others’ fullness, one cannot obtain.  

Only by humbling oneself before others can one rise above them; only by bending before others can one stand taller; only by revealing one’s own emptiness can one receive others’ fullness; only by respecting others’ fullness can one aid one’s own emptiness.  

Thus it is said: “When full, one overflows; when hollow, one is full.” The preciousness of emptiness surpasses fullness.  

In ancient times, Duke Zhou once bathed thrice and grasped thrice, honoring the worthy. The *Huainanzi* records that when meeting the Eight Immortals, one bared his head and feet to bow and greet. Shi Xinglin, upon meeting Ziyang, loosened reins and unlocked shackles to serve him. Patriarch Chángchū first studied the dao with Patriarch Wang, then followed Patriarch Ma to receive teachings and complete his affairs. Master Shangyang first met Yuan Du and gained insight, later sought Qingcheng’s guidance to perfect his功.  

All these sages and worthies attained the great dao through an empty heart.  

Suppose Duke Zhou clung to his status and did not honor the worthy—how could he be sage? Suppose Huainan was self-important and did not revere the Eight Immortals—how could he become immortal? Suppose Patriarch Qiu was self-satisfied and did not follow Patriarch Ma—how could he complete his task? Suppose Master Shangyang was self-sufficient and did not seek Qingcheng—how could he achieve great success?  

Especially in the study of nature and destiny, ignorance in one place leads to confusion in another. A hair’s breadth of error becomes a thousand-mile deviation. What is clear in one matter may be obscured in practice; what is clear in one method may be muddled in doing.  

If one knows the essence but not the function, knows the false but not the true, knows nature but not destiny, knows the beginning but not the end, knows gathering but not releasing, knows advancing but not retreating, knows urgency but not calm, knows fortune but not misfortune, knows greatness but not smallness, knows root but not branch, knows doing but not non-doing, knows the first step but not the outcome—none of these can be called understanding the dao.  

If one knows a little about the gate and immediately becomes self-satisfied and self-sufficient, thinking the dao lies right here, looking down on the four seas, no longer seeking others—how can one penetrate beginning to end, freely traverse forward and backward, unimpeded and unblocked, and directly reach the sacred domain?  

In the world, foolish students rely on their own cleverness, recklessly judging and guessing, trusting themselves and not seeking teachers. Some boast of vast learning, speak grandly and broadly, self-satisfied and refusing to seek instruction. Some grasp minor side-door matters, unable to discern right from wrong, self-conceited and without verification. Some encounter a high master’s guidance, know a single entry, and are content without deeper progress.  

There is yet another sort—those of power and influence, bookish vulgar scholars, who brandish status and puff out their chests, fearing ridicule, unwilling to humble themselves.  

All such people are harmed by self-satisfaction. How could they hear the profound words of a true teacher, enter the broad and open great dao, or advance into the halls of sages and worthies?  

I urge those who truly wish to study the dao: swiftly open the gate of self-satisfaction. Lower your heart and humble your spirit. Appear as one inferior to all others. Regardless of age, wisdom, virtue, rank, or status, show reverence to all without distinction.  

When you see others with even a slight strength, sincerely seek their teaching—do not let the opportunity slip by. Be broadly learned and carefully inquire; everyone is my teacher, everywhere is a place to learn.  

What worry is there that principle cannot be clear, or the dao cannot be accomplished?  

Otherwise, self-satisfaction and fullness, making nothing into something—though true teachers exist, their guidance cannot enter, and the vain hope to understand the dao becomes difficult indeed.
