# The Gate of Fearfulness in Difficulty

The *Yi* says: “The gentleman follows virtue, accumulating the small to reach the great.” The Most Sage declared: “The gentleman abides by the dao and acts accordingly; to give up halfway—I cannot allow it.” Patriarch Qiu said: “In all under Heaven, there is no difficult matter—only those who lack resolve.” All these speak to one truth: to cultivate the dao, one must have a steadfast spirit, and must not harbor a heart that fears difficulty.

For the greatest difficulties under Heaven are surely the greatest matters. The greatest matters demand the humblest and grandest efforts before they can be accomplished. If something were exceedingly easy and done in a single stroke, then surely that thing would be small and not great. The study of nature and life is a grand matter indeed—its scope embraces all existence, transcends humans and Heaven, escapes the Five Phases, and surpasses the Three Realms. It establishes its essence before Heaven and Earth, and manifests its function after Heaven and Earth. To become sage, immortal, or Buddha—is this not a great matter?

When the matter is great and one desires to cultivate this great work, to achieve an everlasting and immortal enterprise, is it not difficult? Yet knowing it is difficult but not fearing the difficulty, regarding life and death as one great matter, setting one’s resolve firm and unyielding, never turning back even in a single thought until death itself—thus one may illuminate the dao, thus one may walk the dao, and what was once difficult becomes no longer difficult.

But if one knows the difficulty and yet fears it, does not treat nature and life as the greatest matter, begins with diligence but ends in slackness, holds a wavering mind of doubt and belief in equal measure, hesitates and does not advance—not only can one not walk the dao, but one cannot illuminate the dao. Then the difficult remains forever difficult.

In ancient times, Divine Light severed his arm in quest of the method, and thus obtained Bodhidharma’s heart transmission. Wang Zhong stood three feet of snow, and at last received Yichuan’s instruction. Patriarch Qiu purified his body and broke his ribs, and was moved to receive a divine message. This is because one who focuses the heart on learning the dao, who is sincere and undivided, can move Heaven and Earth, communicate with ghosts and spirits—how much more so with men?

Yet in this world, foolish learners do not know that nature and life are the foremost great matter of human life. They hope to gain some skill and immediately become immortals; they vainly imagine learning some minor teaching and immediately escape death. When they hear that the sacred dao is profound and subtle, requiring deep probing, they find it difficult; when they hear that the path of cultivation is long, demanding to abandon body and conceal life, enduring hunger and cold without retreat, they falter; when they hear that the dao has a beginning and an end, that merit has layers, that the fire has its appointed time, and that the finest details are subtle and minute, they lose heart.

Such learning of the dao, advancing and retreating without resolve, with the Four Great Elements powerless and spirit flagging—how can one ever taste the flavors within the dao? Is this not a grave misfortune to the great matter?

I urge those who truly seek the dao: swiftly break through the gate of fearfulness in difficulty. Replace your heart with one of iron and stone. Fear not hardship or peril; press forward with fierce strength, forsaking sleep and forgetting food. Whether you gain power or not, whether results appear or not, the longer the effort, the greater the strength; the farther the journey, the more diligent the step. With one heart moving forward, in the end there will surely be attainment. What was difficult will no longer be difficult.

Otherwise, if you fear difficulty and fail to persist, wavering between existence and nonexistence, speaking with the mouth but not acting with the body, desiring to advance but immediately retreating—how can you expect to illuminate the dao? That is truly difficult indeed.
