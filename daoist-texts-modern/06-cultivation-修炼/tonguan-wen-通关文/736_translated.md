# The Gate of Disdain

The Doctrine of the Mean says: “Great indeed is the way of the sage, vast and boundless, nurturing all things, reaching its utmost height in Heaven—majestic and grand beyond measure.” There are three hundred rites and three thousand dignified manners, all waiting upon the person before they unfold.

The Old Patriarch said: “Above Heaven and beneath Earth, only the Dao stands supreme.”

The Treatise on Returning to the Origin declares: “There is a thing that existed before Heaven and Earth, nameless and silent in its solitude. It governs the myriad forms, yet does not follow the withering of the four seasons.” All this speaks of the Dao’s utmost greatness and sovereignty—no person can act contrary to it.

The Dao as Dao is vast and boundless, immeasurable in height and depth, unfathomable in mystery. It contains the utmost non-being while embracing the utmost being; it is utterly void yet holds the utmost substance. Formless, it births all forms; without image, it gives rise to myriad images. It enfolds Heaven and Earth, propels the sun and moon, moves through the four seasons, and nourishes all things. It is everywhere without exception; nothing exists outside it.

Long ago, Confucius grasped it and became the sage of the Confucian teaching; Shakyamuni attained it and became the progenitor of all Buddhas; the Old Lord attained it and became the patriarch of the immortals; the Yellow Emperor attained it and soared on dragons to Heaven; Nüwa attained it and forged stones to mend the sky; Jingyang attained it and uprooted his home to ascend; the Celestial Master attained it and divided humans from ghosts; the Five Patriarchs attained it and took their place as heavenly immortals; the Seven Perfected attained it and transcended birth and death. From ancient times to now, those who have realized the Dao and become sages are countless, beyond numbering.

Such is the honor and dignity of the Dao—how could one treat it with disdain and levity? If one regards it as a trivial matter and treats it lightly and scornfully, then one is not material fit to carry the Dao but rather one who turns against it. Can such a person truly speak of the Dao?

To look down upon the Dao is to take learning the Dao as something easy to know, without delving deeply; to disdain the Dao is to regard practicing the Dao as unworthy effort, lacking the will to toil forward. Unable to enter, unable to advance—on what grounds could one cultivate and accomplish the rare marvels of the world?

Therefore, those who study the Dao must first know that the Dao is the supreme and most precious of all things. It is not something easily grasped or casually obtained. Only then can one summon fierce resolve, apply arduous effort, persevere without weariness, and surely attain the Dao at last.

In this world, muddleheaded learners do not understand that the Dao is secreted by Heaven and Earth, treasured by ghosts and spirits. They treat it lightly and scornfully, utterly lacking sincerity. Some rely on their petty cleverness, thinking they can grasp it by sudden insight; some memorize a few lines of fox-like Zen, believing the Dao is right there; some chase after wind and shadows, thinking they truly know; some call a deer a horse, thinking they truly see; some, when questioned by the enlightened, speak boastfully without shame or sincerity; some, when examined by fellow seekers, stubbornly argue their correctness without restraint.

There is yet another sort—mouthy demons who, upon hearing talk of the Dao, immediately slander it; seeing others read its books, they instantly grow hateful. They regard the sacred classics and teachings as mere outer trappings, and the earnest accumulation of merit as lowly trifles. When they chance upon a master, they refuse to bow their heads and instead set themselves above the master. Even if they bow for a moment, they cannot endure the passage of time or the grinding trials. They do not know that learning the Dao means seeking someone to save one’s own life and nature.

To seek someone to save one’s life, one must be a person who cherishes life. Only then can one be clearly moved and guided by a true master, or in darkness be aided by ghosts and spirits. If one does not cherish life, then one does not hold the great Dao as precious. If one does not honor the Dao’s dignity, how could one ever hear the Dao? Is this not the height of folly?

I urge those who truly wish to learn the Dao to swiftly break through the gate of disdain. When the path is open and firm, treat your life with solemnity. Serve your master with sincerity and respect. Be cautious and vigilant, diligent and earnest, with your feet firmly on the ground, never daring to harbor a heart of levity or scorn.

Like climbing a high mountain, every step requires effort; like crossing a great river, every moment demands vigilance against danger. What fear is there that you cannot reach the shore of the Dao?

Otherwise, not knowing the high and low, noble and base, one treats it as nothing, slackens in effort, herds sheep and gathers firewood, and foolishly dreams of understanding the Dao—how difficult that will be!
