# The Gate of Weakness

The Doctrine of the Mean says: “The Dao is not far from people; if one follows the dao but distances oneself from others, that cannot be called the dao.” The Supreme Sage said: “Is there anyone who can exert their strength in benevolence for even a single day? I have yet to see strength insufficient for this.” The Awakening to the True says: “The great medicine does not seek to compete for encounter; but if met and not refined, that is folly and ignorance.” The ancient scriptures declare: “The Dao never moves in vain; it waits for people and then acts.” All these teach that cultivating the dao requires courageous vigor and diligent progress; weakness and slackness will not do.

Man is born holding the righteous qi of Heaven and Earth, yin and yang, and the Five Phases, standing as the head of all things. Regardless of noble or humble, wise or foolish, firm or gentle, strong or weak, all possess the full merit of Heaven and Earth, and thus can carry the great dao of Heaven and Earth. Therefore, the foolish among husband and wife may be joined with the wise; the unworthy among husband and wife may still walk the path. This is but the difference between having will and lacking will. With will, the soft and weak may transform into the firm and strong; the firm and strong may gradually ascend the shore of the dao. Without will, even the firm and strong become soft and weak; the soft and weak cannot transcend the sea of suffering.

What is called will is firmness and decisiveness. With this firm and decisive will, worldly affairs cannot stain you, affection cannot bind you, selfish desires cannot arise, fame and profit cannot lure you, wealth and rank cannot seduce you, poverty and lowliness cannot sway you, calamity and hardship cannot move you. You know only the dao, and nothing else; you care only for your nature and life, not for other matters. All external things cannot obstruct you. Thus you may hear the dao, thus you may cultivate the dao.

Without firm and decisive will, worldly affairs cannot be seen through, affection cannot be shaken off, selfish desires cannot be swept away. Seeing wealth and rank, the heart stirs; dwelling in poverty and lowliness, the will shifts; encountering calamity, one cannot endure; living in a false realm, one does not know its falsity; trapped in the sea of suffering, one does not know the pain. Even if for a moment the heart of the dao arises, the firm spirit does not rise, and it appears and vanishes in turn. Afraid of wolves in front, afraid of tigers behind; afraid of hunger, afraid of cold; afraid of laboring the body, afraid of failing to learn the dao. Delaying the present, shirking progress, undecided in purpose, weak and timid—by what means can one learn the dao, by what means hear the dao, by what means walk the dao?

Fools in the world who call themselves dao learners do not truly resemble those who learn the dao; they vainly imagine hearing the dao but do not act upon the dao. In the twelve hours of a day, when is there a moment of earnestness on body, mind, nature, and life? They only talk of food and clothing, speak of right and wrong, seek excitement, and contend for victory and defeat. Every move and action is like the common people; sometimes acting, sometimes idle, no different from the vulgar. Seeing advantage, they pry and seek cracks; encountering work to be done, they hide and retreat. Finding joy in suffering, acting in dreams.

They play with illusions, their head full of firmness, yet in doing real work have no strength at all. They never think that wearing the dao’s robe, donning the dao’s kerchief, and eating the grease of the Ten Directions, while doing proper work on themselves, would be the greatest gain. Yet instead they slacken and lack effort, waste years, borrow and accumulate debts, receive salary without merit—how can this be resolved?

Moreover, this matter of cultivating the True does not require your body to exert great strength or to take reckless paths. It is but a single, enduring thought in the heart, a firm and decisive will, and then creation is possible. Shakyamuni Buddha did not descend from the heavens; Laozi did not grow from underground; Confucius was not formed from the wind. They had the same human eyes and ears, the same human flesh and skin, all relying first on exhausting human effort, then attaining the sage’s position.

Therefore Mencius said: “Yao and Shun were the same as others.” Indeed, sages, immortals, and Buddhas all cultivate themselves to become so. Everyone can become sage and immortal; everyone can become immortal and Buddha. The only affliction is weakness and inability, unwilling to establish firm will for oneself.

I urge those with true hearts who learn the dao to quickly break through the gate of weakness. Steady your staff, ignite a fierce and courageous will, strengthen a long-lasting heart, step forward, and charge straight in with a single blade. Every moment keep your mind on nature and life; every step exhaust the dao’s principle. When ignorant, strive to know; when unclear, labor to understand. If you meet a bright master, simply approach with sincere heart to study and learn. Do not vainly imagine secret formulas; do not hastily ask for mind transmission. When taught to suffer, then suffer; taught to die, then die; taught to hunger, then hunger.

As for beating, scolding, and grinding, all are gladly accepted, without a trace of resentment—only then can matters be helped. Only by enduring what others cannot endure can you obtain what others cannot obtain; only by suffering what others cannot suffer can you know what others cannot know. Otherwise, if you are only weak, your firm spirit not rising, you have no strength at all—how can you carry the great dao? To vainly imagine understanding the dao is difficult indeed.
