# The Gate of Impermanence

The *Book of Changes* says: “If one does not maintain constant virtue, one may inherit shame.” The Ultimate Sage declared: “A person without constancy cannot serve as a shaman or healer.” Zi Si remarked: “If one does not reach supreme virtue, the ultimate dao cannot cohere.” Mencius said: “The superior person cultivates deeply through the dao, desiring that it be attained spontaneously.” Yuan Duzi observed: “Those who study the Complete Reality school obtain from their master a rough pointing to the gate and path, yet do not understand the step-by-step affairs; they know that spirit and qi depend on each other, but do not grasp the mingling of lead and mercury; they know the mingling of lead and mercury, but do not comprehend the fusion of nature and life. Recklessly guessing the timing of the fire, advancing and retreating without knowing—these all lead to no accomplishment.”

The *Ancient Scripture* says: “When speech is not understood, they are not kin; when skill is not attained, one is neither square nor round.” This all speaks to the cultivation of the dao and establishment of virtue requiring a long-lasting resolve. The way of cultivating the true is the study that exhausts principle, nature, and life. To exhaust principle means to reach a point where not a single hair’s breadth remains doubtful, not a single detail unknown—only then is there great enlightenment and profound awakening. When knowledge is genuine and perception precise, principle begins to shine clearly; to exhaust nature means to reach a state free of any trace of qi or temperament, free of any selfish desire, so that one becomes empty and hollow. To be bright without obscurity, dark without confusion—only then is nature fully exhausted. To exhaust life means to break free from yin and yang, to leap beyond the Five Phases; only then can one say that merit and power have fully transformed, unmoving and unshaken, free and focused, and life is truly established.

Yet to exhaust principle, nature, and life is no feat of a single morning or evening. One must establish a long-lasting resolve, practice enduring effort, only then can one illuminate principle, exhaust nature, and perfect life—dwelling within creation yet not bound by it. Because this great matter of enduring and unchanging truth requires great effort without ceasing to bring it to completion. Among the past masters of the true, who was there not one who established a long-lasting resolve and used enduring effort to accomplish it? Consider the small, clever crafts of the world: they too require focused attention, listening to the master’s instruction, years of effort, only then can one act with ease and skill, shaping materials according to their nature. How much more so this great matter of nature and life—how could one without constancy know it?

The worldly muddle-headed learners do not know what principle truly is; they study empty forms and grasp appearances, and call this understanding principle. They do not know what nature truly is; some suspect nature lies in the heavenly valley at the forehead’s gate, the spirit residing atop the head, and call this cultivating nature. They do not know what life truly is; some suspect life lies in the elixir field’s sea of qi, settling intention in the lower origin, and call this cultivating life. Alas! To call these principle, nature, and life, and to vainly imagine transcendence, hoping for immortality—this is like climbing a tree to catch a fish, or squeezing one’s eyes to see flowers—what real help is there?

If one cannot even know principle, nature, and life, how can one hope for immortality? Even among a few learners who distinguish right from wrong, discern true from false, they still vainly imagine swift attainment, impatient to see results. Over time they grow lax, lacking a long-lasting heart, with little firmness of thought—now advancing, now retreating, now moving, now stopping. Just as they wish to move forward, they shrink back; suspended in emptiness, unreal, confused and unstable. Such as these, how could they ever see the profound hall or true substance?

I urge those with sincere hearts who study the dao: quickly break through the gate of impermanence, establish a long-lasting resolve, set down enduring effort, and do not be of two minds, abandoning halfway. The longer and harder the effort, the more difficult and bitter the path, yet in the end there will be a moment of joyous attainment. Otherwise, beginning with diligence but ending with laziness, speaking and acting without care, chasing illusions and hearing the dao falsely—this is truly difficult.
