# The Gate of Reckless Abandonment

The Most Sage declared: “To hear the dao in the morning, and die at dusk—this is enough.”  
Yan Zi said: “Who was Shun? Who am I? Even those who act thus are like this.”  
Mencius said: “One who recklessly abandons oneself cannot be spoken with; one who forsakes oneself cannot be partnered with in action.”  
The Old Patriarch said: “I am no sage, yet I have learned and attained it.”  

Master Shangyang said: “When Shakyamuni heard half a verse of the Buddha’s teaching, he was ready to give up his body; the Yellow Emperor, following the downward wind, knelt and advanced to ask Guangchengzi how to govern the body so as to live long.”  
All these are examples of self-regard and self-respect—thus one must not recklessly abandon or forsake oneself.  

Human beings are born bearing the qi of Heaven and Earth’s Five Phases; where there is qi, there is nature; where there is nature, there is destiny. Thus principle, qi, nature, and destiny all dwell within one body. Whether wise or foolish, high or low, all share this same principle and qi, this same nature and destiny.  
Common folk and sages differ originally not in kind; only those who can fully realize nature and destiny are sages; those who cannot are common folk.  
Mencius said that what separates humans from beasts is but a hair’s breadth; the common people lose it, the gentleman preserves it.  

The Immortal Traditions say: since ancient times, those who have ascended by flight number three thousand; those who have uprooted their homes number eight hundred; those who have sat and shed their mortal form, standing and vanishing, are countless.  
All these attained knowledge through learning, achieved success through hardship; none have known or succeeded without learning and toil.  
In the world, born knowing is rare; those who learn knowledge are many. Even born knowing, a single tumble can bring confusion. Without learning, one cannot succeed; only through learning can one succeed.  

Therefore, Shakyamuni also had to study under Ran Deng; Confucius also had to study under Xiang Zhu; Laozi also had to study under Yuanshi.  
As for the venerable masters Yu, Zhong, Lü, Liu, Wang, Zhang, Shi, Xue, Chen, Bai, and others—all are a continuous lineage, passed mouth to mouth.  
It is clear: ability comes from learning; without learning, there is no accomplishment. How small, then, is the power of study!  

Yet in the world, foolish learners do not value their own nature and destiny; they do not cherish their body and mind in cultivation.  
Their body dwells in the dao, yet they do not know they possess the dao; their body rests in a treasure grove, yet they do not know a treasure is present. They mistake the false for the real, and the empty for the substantial.  

Some say: “The length of nature and destiny is fixed; it is not something humans can overcome.”  
Some say: “Immortals and sages are born from Heaven; ordinary people cannot learn it.”  
Some say: “The Great Dao is profound and mysterious; it is not something common folk can understand.”  

Thus they recklessly abandon and forsake themselves, drawing their own boundaries, content to dwell in the sea of suffering, treading the path of sinking and ruin—a wasted human life indeed.  

They do not know that since they are human, bearing yin and embracing yang, they carry the creative transformation of Heaven and Earth. Everyone can be a sage; everyone can become an immortal or Buddha.  
But one must be utmost in sincerity and progress, humble oneself to seek help, move from near to far, and persevere without weariness.  

Consider the foxes, apes, and deer in the mountains—mere beasts, yet they preserve spirit and nourish qi, quietly dwelling in their caverns. Over long years, their功 deepen; they can hide their forms and transform, extending their years and increasing their life.  
How much more, then, humans—the spirits of all beings—could fail to succeed in cultivating the dao?  
If one says humans cannot attain the dao, is it not that they are inferior even to beasts?  

I urge those with true hearts who seek the dao: quickly break through the gate of reckless abandonment.  
Stand firm and unyielding; sweep away all the lingering illnesses and burdens of your postnatal qi and temperament.  
Focus single-mindedly on yearning for the dao; temper yourself through hardship and adversity.  

Those who do not know will surely desire to learn in order to know; those who cannot will surely desire to learn in order to be able.  
Change for the better, correct faults, preserve sincerity and discard delusion, remain consistent from beginning to end, never wavering—then the Great Dao can be hoped for.  

Otherwise, recklessly abandoning and forsaking oneself, not valuing nature and destiny, not esteeming dao and virtue, muddling through the days, drunk on life’s illusions, empty and vain through a lifetime—once the human body is lost, the kalpas of suffering are endless.
