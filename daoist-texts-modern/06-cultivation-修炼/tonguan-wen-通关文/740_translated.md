# The Burden of Debt Gate

The Most Sage declared: “When a scholar sets their heart upon the dao, yet feels ashamed of humble clothes and simple food, they have not yet reached sufficient understanding.” Patriarch Qiu said: “Every grain of rice, every copper coin, is the blood and essence of the farmer—how could one receive these without merit?” These words all teach that the learner must hold the dao as paramount and must not carelessly seek after clothing and food.

For those who cultivate the dao, it is precisely to serve their nature and life. Though this body has not yet left the dusty world, and though clothing and food cannot be abandoned, one must not let clothing and food mislead the great matter of nature and life. Since ancient times, the ancestral masters have taught people to act in their simple station: those born to wealth and honor should walk the path of wealth and honor; those born to poverty and lowliness should walk the path of poverty and lowliness. There is no need to insist on begging for clothing and food from the Ten Directions.

Because the number of the supremely wise is few, while the middling and low are many, there is a division in practice between ease and effort, between difficulty and simplicity, teaching people to measure their strength and act accordingly. The supremely wise possess great status and great power; it does not hinder them to dwell in the marketplace or court, to live amid wealth and honor, yet still accomplish deeds unstained by wealth and honor. They need not borrow others’ strength but ascend straight to the shore of the dao.

As for the middling and low, their status is low, their power small; they cannot grasp the whole at once. Dwelling in wealth and honor, they become bound by wealth and honor, which obstructs the great matter. Therefore, they are taught to break free from wealth and honor, endure humiliation and beg for alms, live day by day following fate, suffer heart and mind’s weighing and measuring, temper and refine their nature and breath, and work from the solid ground of reality, applying effort in hardship.

There are also supremely wise persons who do not love wealth and honor, who cast off attachments and willingly accept poverty and plainness. One robe, one gourd, wandering and eating to sustain the mouth, secretly cultivating and refining, so that others do not recognize them—this makes their功 easier to achieve. All these do not fix their hearts on clothing and food, but only borrow the power of the Ten Directions temporarily to nourish this skin bag.

The confused learners of the world do not know that the sweat and blood of the Ten Directions are not to be lightly received and empty taken. They abandon the great matter of nature and life, instead placing clothing and food as their priority. They gather alms here and there, eat their fill and wear warm clothes, neglect the true work, wander idly and wildly, never once pondering why they left the home of the Way. Unable to repay the kindness of their parents’ nurturing, unable to repay the grace of the sovereigns and the land, they pile up debts with the Ten Directions—how can these be digested?

There is an even worse sort of sinful man, head crowned with the dao, heart hiding a thief like Zhi, scheming for clothing and food, devising tricks and deceits. Some borrow and steal others’ wealth; some feign wisdom to receive offerings; some borrow the building of temples to breed schemes; today entering the homes of the good to seek money; tomorrow begging rice from those who love learning; twisting east and west, cheating and gambling with money; eating wine and swallowing meat, shifting the debts of the Ten Directions—how will they ever repay?

Patriarch Qiu said: “The two horns of flesh may or may not be present, but the one tail is surely fixed.” This is the meaning. I urge those truly sincere in learning the dao to swiftly open the gate of the burden of debt. Guard the mouth according to fate, nourish the body with detachment. Every thread and every line, one must think on the difficulty of its coming; every drink and every bite, one must know the arduousness of accomplishment.

Constantly strive, step by step adding功, hoping surely to reach the dao and complete virtue before ceasing. If one truly reaches the dao and completes virtue, not only will the debts of the Ten Directions be digested, but all the karmic sins from the beginningless kalpas will be erased with one stroke. Only then can one wear Heaven’s clothes and eat Heaven’s blessings—what need is there for the things of the dusty world?

If not, one only knows how to accumulate debts, not how to dissolve them; only knows how to shift accounts, not how to repay them. With no功 and no practice, sins pile like mountains, and vainly imagining knowing the dao—this is difficult indeed.
