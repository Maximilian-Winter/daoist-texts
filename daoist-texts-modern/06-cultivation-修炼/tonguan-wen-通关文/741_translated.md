# The Barrier of Pride and Grandeur

The *Dao De Jing* says: “The rigid and strong belong to the path of death; the soft and weak belong to the path of life.” Mencius said: “Those who respect others will be respected in return; those who love others will be loved in return.” There is a saying: “Those who set out from the world with pride and strength find it hard to move even an inch.” All these speak to the truth that one should humble oneself and lower one’s heart, never harboring pride or arrogance.

Now, what is called pride and grandeur? It is when one boasts of one’s own sanctity and strength, rigid and eager to contend, having oneself but no others. Only those who do not exalt themselves will ultimately reach heights; only those who do not magnify themselves will ultimately become great. How so? Because those who do not exalt themselves can be humble before others; those who do not magnify themselves can be small before others. To be able to be humble and small is to be as if one is nothing, truly as if one is empty. To have talent but not display it, to have wisdom but not use it, to hide one’s abilities and show no skill; to be originally knowing but to appear ignorant—this is how one meets the world, and the world delights in it; this is how one studies the dao, and teachers and friends rejoice.

Long ago, Yu the Great, upon hearing good words, would bow; Zilu, when told of his faults, would be glad. Both were truly humble and lowly, never proud or arrogant. Thus they became great sages and virtuous ones, enduring through the ages without fading. Yet this matter of not exalting oneself requires true heart and sincere intent to carry out, only then can it bear fruit. If one outwardly forces humility and smallness while inwardly harboring arrogance and secret pride, it is like “hiding a spear in the grass”—the inside and outside do not harmonize, the heart is not genuine, the conduct will not endure. Outward respect without inner reverence is what is called “smooth words and flattering looks,” rarely is there true benevolence. Not only does this fail to cure the sickness of pride and grandeur, but it adds the sickness of inviting calamity.

Therefore, those who do not exalt themselves will come to not know what pride is; those who do not magnify themselves will come to not know what grandeur is. Only then are all the ailments of pride and grandeur completely transformed. The patriarchs of past generations and all the perfected ones have walked the path of humility and smallness to cultivate the dao and establish virtue, persevering without weariness. Hence they accomplished great matters, ultimately beyond the reach of all people.

In the world, confused learners—among the common folk, some have wealth, rank, and power but refuse to be humble and small before others; some rely on talent and learning but refuse humility; some lean on age and seniority but refuse humility. Among those on the dao path, some memorize a few scrolls of alchemical scriptures and fancy they have attained, yet refuse humility; some learn a few techniques and proudly embrace the dao, yet refuse humility; some follow their whims and pride, arrogant and unrestrained, yet refuse humility; some are eager for swift gain and cannot endure the long term, yet refuse to humble themselves before others. There are even those cunning tricksters who know nothing of sincere heart or receiving teaching, but instead steal the patriarchs’ words, twisting them here and there, mixing and muddling, leading others astray with exposed speech. Some are self-willed, chasing shadows and catching wind, flaunting their skills before masters, boasting of their abilities.

All such types are proud and arrogant, unable to humble themselves and small themselves, treating their very nature and life as a trivial matter. Little do they know that the great dao of nature and life is a rare treasure in the world—how could one treat it with pride and arrogance and wild fancy? How could one treat it lightly with pride and arrogance? I urge those who truly seek the dao with sincere heart to swiftly break through the barrier of pride and grandeur. Erase all self-satisfaction, complacency, arrogance, and ambition with a single stroke. Step down from the utmost humility and smallness, and learn steadily and solidly.

Not only will this bring no calamity or disaster in the world, but in studying the dao one will receive abundant benefit. Otherwise, with pride and grandeur and refusal to humble oneself, who will speak of greatness? To vainly dream of illuminating the dao is indeed difficult.
