# The Gate of Adornment

The *Dao De Jing* says: “The fields are overgrown with weeds, the granaries are empty; yet one wears embroidered robes and girds a sharp sword, despises food and drink, and has wealth in abundance—this is boasting of the dao, but not truly the dao.” The *Nan Hua Jing* says: “All that is heavy on the outside is clumsy within.” Mencius said: “To seek wide fame and praise for oneself is to disregard the embroidered finery of others.” All these words speak to those who cultivate the dao: one must never labor for the external while losing the internal; to abandon the true and follow the false is folly indeed.

For the study of nature and life, the genuine concerns are matters of real use and substance. Not a trace of falsity or artifice may enter; not a single bit of contrivance may be employed. Even a slight falsehood or affectation not only fails to cultivate nature and life but actually damages the heart’s ground. Thus, since ancient times, the highest adepts of true cultivation have prized nature and life above all. One robe, one gourd; hair uncombed, feet bare; living day by day according to circumstance, with no love for splendor or beauty, without a trace of adornment.

Great wisdom appears foolish; great skill seems clumsy. They harmonize their light with the dust of the world, mingling with the common folk so that worldly eyes cannot recognize them. In olden days, the great sage Huineng hid among the hunters of Sihui; the Chan Master Daoguang abandoned monkhood to return to the world and accomplish great matters; the Sovereign Chongyang lodged in the tomb of the living dead; the Great Awakener of Changchun stirred up dust and toil; Zi Qing wore a thatch roof on his head; Sanfeng wore tattered clothes and worn shoes—all these were for the great matter of nature and life, placing the colored body beyond concern, not fussing over its decoration.

Likewise, the mad immortal Zhang of Xianyang concealed himself among farmers; the sleeping immortal Zhang of Nie rested beside the ice shore; the immortal elder of Baishi Bridge rowed watercraft to blend with the common folk; my immortal teacher Liu carried firewood by the riverbank to temper himself. All these true ones, without exception, attacked hardship openly and practiced secretly. When did they ever adorn their bodies or decorate their appearances? They valued what was within and lightly regarded what was without, attending to the true and abandoning the false.

But the muddled learners of the world prize the outside and scorn the inside. They recognize the false and forsake the true, acting contrary to the ancients in every way. Some fear ridicule and so must wear splendid robes and scarves; some dread the cold and so pile on many garments; some style their hair with elaborate copper hoops; some tuck in ribbons in strange ways, strutting boldly; some dazzle the eyes and ears of others to win offerings; some sit in circles, closing themselves off, selling their names and seeking praise. Such conduct and concealment labor only in false matters, never applying heart or mind to nature and life. They take the false as real and strive after it, vainly hoping to attain the true. It is like fishing the moon from the sea’s depths or plucking flowers from a mirror—always ending in emptiness.

I urge the true-hearted who study the dao: swiftly open the gate of adornment. Gather brilliance to reality; wear coarse clothes and tattered robes; be proper and modest; calm and detached; prize nature and life; esteem dao and virtue; turn from error to correctness; make all matters solid and real—only then is there progress. Otherwise, taking nothing as something, taking emptiness as substance, striving outside while losing inside, abandoning the true to follow the false, and recklessly imagining one understands the dao—this is difficult indeed.
