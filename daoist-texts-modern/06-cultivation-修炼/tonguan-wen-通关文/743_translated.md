# The Gate of False Knowing

The Most Sage declared: “To know that one knows is knowing; to know that one does not know is also knowing.” The Venerable Ancestor said: “Knowing that you do not know is supreme; not knowing that you know is a fault.” The Perfected One of Ziyang said: “Even if one recognizes cinnabar and black lead, without knowing the proper timing of the fire, it is as if idle.” In great measure, it all depends on the power of cultivation and practice; a hair’s breadth of difference, and the Golden Elixir will not form.

Master Yuzi said: “The scholar of the dao who attains the true essence of inner and outer medicines, who completes the full operation of the two phases, and who harmonizes with the great creation, only then obtains what is transmitted. If there is even a hair’s breadth of difference, the heavens and earth remain suspended apart.” All these words emphasize that learning the dao requires true knowing and clear seeing, and that one cannot count ignorance as knowledge—this would be a grave error.

Those who study seek teachers and friends precisely because they do not know and desire to know. To seek knowledge, one must understand what is nature, what is destiny, what is yin and yang, what are the Five Phases, what is prior to Heaven, what is after Heaven, what is the beginning of action, what is rest, what is doing, what is non-doing, what is forging, what is nourishing, what is receiving destiny, and what is realizing nature. From beginning to end, with complete awakening and utter enlightenment, without a single doubt remaining, only then is one truly open in all directions, possessing true knowing and clear seeing, and practicing without error.

If one knows nature but not destiny, knows destiny but not nature, knows yin and yang but not the Five Phases, knows the after Heaven but not the prior Heaven, knows the beginning of action but not rest, knows doing but not non-doing, knows forging but not nourishing, knows receiving destiny but not realizing nature—such a person cannot be said to know the dao. Without knowing the dao, how can one walk the dao?

The study of nature and destiny is such that one part knowing is one part doing; ten parts knowing is ten parts doing. There has never been one who does not know yet can act. Therefore, those who cultivate the dao prize first seeking knowledge. But to seek knowledge, one must first know that one both knows and does not know—this is the true knowing of this one matter. Only then can one say one knows. If there remains even a trace of doubt, seeming so yet not so, that cannot be called knowing. One must again seek a teacher to open the mind and heart, to brighten the ground within, to dispel all doubts—only then can it be called knowing.

Never should one take not knowing as knowing, lest one delay oneself. In the world, muddled learners do not know what nature and destiny are, nor how cultivation proceeds. They learn some side-door tricks, contrive crooked paths, muddle through, and foolishly think they know. Rashly they begin, not only without benefit but suffering harm. There are even those wicked men who take nothing as something, emptiness as fullness, who cannot distinguish right from wrong, nor investigate true and false, who counterfeit the genuine. They harm themselves, knowing well their error, yet still pretend to be masters, and then lead others astray, making them err as well—dark and evil indeed.

There are also those close to enlightened masters who hear a few words and do not carefully taste their flavor, who take mere phrases as knowledge and then show off before others. Or those who have glanced through a few alchemical scriptures, follow some ink marks, guess at will, without head or tail, yet claim to know. Even with a bright master before them, they do not seek verification. Such types all take not knowing as knowing—this is called false knowing, not true knowing. From ancient times to now, countless learners have fallen into this trap.

Alas! What is the matter of nature and destiny that it should be so absurd, deceiving oneself and others? Little do they know, only thorough knowing can lead to thorough doing. One must exert effort to discern carefully, pursue with attentive heart, yet still fear that knowing is incomplete and doing is blocked. One must seek a teacher. How much more so for those who do not know yet pretend to know!

I urge those who truly wish to learn the dao to swiftly break through the gate of false knowing, to sweep away the heart of self-conceit. Those who do not know must urgently seek knowledge; those who already know must seek deeper knowing. The matter of nature and destiny is great, the supreme dao profound and subtle. One must delve to the utmost, the more one knows, the deeper one enters. One must reach the end of waters and the limit of mountains, see the very bottom, and only then be done.

If one pretends to be wise, treating nature and destiny as a child’s play, the ignorant will never know, the slightly knowing will find it hard to deepen, and the reckless desire to understand the dao is indeed difficult.
