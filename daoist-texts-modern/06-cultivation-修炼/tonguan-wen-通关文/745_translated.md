# The Gate of Greedy Drinking

Mencius said: “Yu detested strong wine but cherished kind words.”  
Lüzu said: “Wine, lust, wealth, and qi form four enclosing walls, within which all people hide. Whoever leaps beyond these walls is the formula for long life and unaging. This teaching warns people not to be greedy for wine and thus ruin their proper affairs.”  

Indeed, wine is the foremost of the four harms. Once one becomes greedy for wine, drunkenness clouds one’s nature; lustful desires arise from it; thoughts of wealth are born from it; and the qi-nature flares forth because of it. Wealth, lust, and qi—all spring from wine. Losing virtue and spoiling conduct also stem from wine. Some even act recklessly, plunging into water and fire without knowing; falling into swords and spears without awareness. Since ancient times, how many wise and talented ones, heroes and mighty figures, have met such trials and lost their lives thereby!  

Yet there are those whose nature is kind and who have self-control; though greedy for wine, they do not fall into disorder; lust, wealth, and qi cannot stain them. Even so, their spirits grow dim, their qi short and labored, damp heat smolders within, their fluids dry up, and their qi and blood suffer injury. This brings no benefit, only harm. Therefore, the Buddhist school places wine as the foremost precept, precisely because its harm is greatest.  

But foolish worldly learners, borrowing the words “wine and meat pass through the intestines to the heart” from the Patriarchs, do not shun the dizzying intoxication of wine. They greedily drink without limit, day after day dwelling in the land of drunkenness—dim and drowsy, staggering and tumbling, indulging their nature without restraint. Some, drunk, lose their words and wound others; some, drunk, bear grudges and cause trouble; some, drunk, wield knives and clubs; some, drunk, bare their bodies and speak nonsense; some, drunk, collapse in streets and alleys, abandoning shame; some, drunk, vomit and injure their qi, their spirit and soul unrestful.  

Over time, illness arises; food no longer enters; until death, they do not abstain. There are also those single-mindedly devoted to the dao who, though afflicted with many partial ailments, can cast them all away—except for this dregs-flavored taste of wine, which they cannot give up. Alas! Those who cultivate the true must strive to uproot the dust of kalpas and the seeds of reincarnation. Wine is but a fleeting taste on the tongue, an external thing, not a root carried from kalpas. If this small ailment cannot be removed for life, how can one uproot the seeds of kalpa and reincarnation? Such persons, are they not harming the great by the small, seeking their own death road?  

Moreover, wine is unlike food and drink; if one does not eat or drink for several days, even to the point of starvation, if one never uses wine for life, what harm is there? If one says it quenches thirst, then water and broth are far more convenient—why resort to wine? Ultimately, the disease of greedy drinking is deep and stubborn, unwilling to be cured.  

I urge those truly learning the dao to swiftly break open the gate of greedy drinking, to redirect the fondness for fine wine into wholehearted effort in exhausting principle and practice. Do not be disturbed by the crooked demons. Though wine is a minor matter, it can ruin great affairs. Vigorously eliminate it, and the benefits will be many. Otherwise, greed for wine without satisfaction, living a drunken dream-death, dwelling daily in the land of chaos, always caught in the net of confusion, vainly imagining clarity of the dao—this is most difficult indeed.
