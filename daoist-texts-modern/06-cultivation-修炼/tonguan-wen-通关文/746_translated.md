# Gate of Fearing Hardship

The Doctrine of the Mean says: When others can do something once, I do it a hundred times; when others can do it ten times, I do it a thousand times. Truly, one who can follow this dao will, though foolish, surely become wise; though soft, will surely become strong. In the time of the Great Antiquity it was said: Sleep for one moment, and you die for one moment; sleep for one day, and you die for one day. But if every day you make effort without sleep, then after a thousand days the matter is done. There is a saying: “Without descending into the bitterness of bitterness, it is hard to become a person above all others.” All these speak of the greatest and finest matters, which must be achieved only through diligent hardship.

The greatest matters under Heaven require the greatest efforts of hardship, and only after long days do they come to completion. Especially because the hardship is great, so too is the accomplishment great. How much more so for the great matter of one’s nature and life—could it be accomplished without hardship? The single word “hardship” is the excellent medicine for those who cultivate the dao to cure their sickness. Only by enduring hardship can one temper body and mind, only then can one regulate the great illness. Therefore, one must accumulate功 (merit) and practice outwardly, while refining intention and thought inwardly; labor the sinews and bones, starve the flesh and skin, empty and deplete the body; everywhere perform功 (practice), in all things exert effort.

Build bridges and mend roads, diminish oneself to benefit others, endure humiliation and accept defilement, adapt to local circumstances. When others are good, I am not good; when others love, I do not love; when others suffer hardship, I can endure it; when others face difficulty, I can pass through it. Cast away, once and for all, all the habits and attachments accumulated since birth—this too is a kind of hardship. Within, arrange and straighten the spirit, strengthen the will, remove desires, sweep away false thoughts, all manner of vexations, all ignorance—cut them down fiercely. If you cannot remove them, yet must desire to remove them; if you cannot eliminate them, yet must desire to eliminate them—this is the true heart seeking the dao within, never departing for a moment, accepting nothing else. This is the inner hardship.

When hardship is thus cast away, inner and outer become one; this is true hardship, and only then can the great illness be cured. In the past, Shakyamuni cultivated on snowy mountains; the Sixth Patriarch and the Four Assemblies applied effort; the Patriarch Qiu and Panxi ground their nature—like all the sages and worthies, all born with heavenly gifts, yet they still had to cross through great hardship. How much more so for later generations of learners, all of middling or low rank—how could there be accomplishment without hardship?

Foolish learners in the world do not understand the sweetness born from hardship; they seek to obtain treasures with ease, to become immortal in leisure. Hearing of descending into hardship, they immediately fret; hearing of exertion and toil, they immediately make difficulty. By day they cherish their strength to fatten the flesh, eat their fill and idle away; by night they lie on soft quilts and thick blankets, sleeping long and deep. They do not do a single deed to benefit others, nor exert effort in any place. Countless faults remain uncorrected. Some read a few volumes of alchemical books, or ponder a few scrolls of scriptures, pretending to have the dao; some wander and beg for alms, eat their fill and wear warm clothes, thinking this is skill; some sit in temples or retreats, with abbots burning incense and performing rituals, avoiding hunger and cold, thinking this is cultivation. Such as these never think to cast away parents or abandon wives—what for? If leaving home is just for food and clothing, how is this different from worldly people? Why burden oneself with debts in the Ten Directions? Is this not an extra matter?

I urge those with true hearts seeking the dao to swiftly break through the gate of fearing hardship, to establish a thought of enduring hardship to death without turning back, to set foot firmly on the ground and advance courageously. Stick the two words “nature and life” on your forehead, and keep them in mind every moment. Do all beneficial things with all your strength; abandon all useless things with all your strength. Beyond your own hardship in practice, listen to your master’s instructions and follow them one by one as ordered; do not give rise to laziness; labor day and night without ceasing; after long time without abandoning, you will finally gain real benefit. Otherwise, if you fear hardship, hesitate and fail to act, dragging out the years with false hopes of hearing the dao—this is difficult indeed.
