# The Gate of Faithlessness

The *Dao De Jing* says:  
“The superior person, upon hearing the dao, diligently puts it into practice;  
The middling person, upon hearing the dao, seems to hold it, yet seems to lose it;  
The inferior person, upon hearing the dao, bursts into loud laughter.”

The *Diamond Sutra* says:  
“Good men and good women, when they arouse the mind of Anuttara-samyak-sambodhi, should abide thus, and thus subdue their minds.”  
The mind of Anuttara-samyak-sambodhi—this is the supreme, perfect, and equal enlightenment, the mind of faith.

The *Yi Jing* says:  
“Central sincerity, like the sow and fish, brings good fortune.”  

The *Doctrine of the Mean* says:  
“Sincerity is the beginning and end of all things; without sincerity, nothing exists.”  
Therefore, the gentleman esteems sincerity above all.

The sages of the Three Teachings have all left instructions, teaching that sincerity and faithfulness form the root of cultivating the dao. Yet faith is not mere trust in words, nor belief in information; it is the faith of true heart and genuine intention. The single character 信 (faith) embodies the truest principle and the greatest potency. It can move Heaven and Earth, connect with the numinous, reverse life and death, turn the wheel of birth and killing, and transform one into sage and worthy, Buddha and immortal. For those who cultivate the dao, it is the foremost and most precious treasure.

The learner who firmly grasps this one character, clutching it close to heart and chest, never letting it depart for a moment—thus the great root is established, unmoving and unshaken, unchanging and unaltered. From here, progress follows: one can hear the dao, one can walk the dao; one can understand one’s nature, one can comprehend one’s destiny. Since ancient times, which immortal or perfected being has not taken faith as their foothold? Which has not attained the dao through faith?

But faith is not idle fantasy, nor idle chatter in a group; it is a single-minded focus on the dao, with no second thought, ever mindful of this moment, morning and evening, never forgetting even for a breath. Those who do not regard their nature and life as the greatest matter cannot have faith; those who do not see the world as tattered rags cannot have faith; those who cannot remain unmoved by wealth and honor, by poverty and lowliness, by power and force, cannot have faith; those who do not look down upon all things, seeing all existence as empty, cannot have faith; those who do not remain unchanged until death, placing good and ill, fortune and calamity beyond their concern, cannot have faith.

If within the heart’s chamber there lingers even the slightest doubt, if there is the faintest slackening, this cannot be called faith. Thus it is known: true faith is sincere, singular, advancing with the sun, moving with the times. Those who can do this advance daily; those who do the opposite waste their years in vain.

Yet faith must also discern right from wrong, distinguish true from false. In the world, many wander into side doors and outer paths, holding fast their faith for a lifetime, stubborn and unchanging until death—are these not also faith? But faith that is not right becomes faith’s own harm. Therefore, those who study the dao prize faith, but prize even more the faith that is rightly obtained; only then is it true faith in the dao.

Among the muddle-headed learners of the world, none are steadfast in the dao. In the twelve hours of a day, countless thoughts arise and vanish; they let the demons run riot, never once placing the dao in their hearts. Sometimes, when idle, they suddenly think to toy with the scrolls of scripture, never savoring them, then their minds are torn away by ghosts and monsters. Some learners, for a time, gather their fierce spirit, advancing bravely and diligently, discerning principle and meaning, seeking teachers and friends; but when long without success, their hearts grow weary. Some hear a faint fragrance of incense, see no swift effect, and so begin to doubt, hesitating and not moving forward; some enter crooked paths, creating illness and error, never repentant, instead condemning the alchemical scriptures as falsehoods. Such cases are too many to count.

Unable to penetrate the dao, how can they understand the dao?

I urge those with true hearts who study the dao: swiftly break open the gate of faithlessness. Firmly establish your nature and life; sweep away all evil thoughts and affairs; erect a diamond-like resolve, solid and steadfast, pressing forward—no matter whether you gain power or not, whether you succeed or fail in your study—persist until death. In the dark, spirits and gods will support you; in the end, good fortune will come. Otherwise, today you do this, tomorrow you do that, now forward, now back, sometimes believing, sometimes doubting, your master uncertain, your thoughts wandering—how can you hope to illuminate the dao? It is difficult indeed.
