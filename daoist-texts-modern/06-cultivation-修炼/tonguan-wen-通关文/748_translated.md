# The Gate of No Mastery

The *Yi Jing* says: “Consider carefully before speaking; deliberate before acting; through such consideration and deliberation, transformation is perfected.” The *Doctrine of the Mean* states: “If words are settled beforehand, there will be no stumbling; if affairs are settled beforehand, there will be no confusion; if conduct is settled beforehand, there will be no regret; if the dao is settled beforehand, it will never be exhausted.” All these teachings emphasize that in any undertaking, the precious thing is first to have a sovereign master within—one who governs and determines.

For those who seek the dao, the first necessity is to possess this sovereign master within oneself. To have a master is to firmly recognize one’s nature and life; then the true heart reveals itself. When the true heart is revealed, worldly affairs cannot stain it; favors and attachments no longer cling; fame and profit no longer entice. All matters outside the body do not weigh upon the breast; the mind is focused and devoted. Hardship can be endured; suffering is unknown. With this, one can exhaust principle, and principle can indeed be exhausted; one can listen to teachings, and teachings can indeed be heeded. This is because the master resides within, and external things cannot deceive.

Yet, in establishing this master, one must discern between the two paths of true and false. The true master benefits nature and life; the false master harms nature and life. If one does not distinguish true from false, one will mistakenly stumble into side paths, enter false ways, seek hidden and strange acts, and engage in all manner of contrivances—none of which bring benefit, only harm. Ultimately, this is no master at all, and cannot be called mastery.

Therefore, one must first carefully and attentively distinguish, truly and earnestly recognize the correct path; then, upon the correct path, firmly establish the master. With one heart and one mind, proceed step by step, each step beneficial, daily witnessing achievement. This is what is meant by being cautious at the beginning and preserving oneself to the end.

The *Yi Jing* says: “Without leaving the courtyard or door, no fault arises.” This speaks of having a settled and determined view beforehand.

But in the world, muddled learners, though they say they seek nature and life, in truth do not understand the weight of nature and life. Nor do they know what matters of nature and life truly are. They look lightly, regard easily, vaguely and confusedly, yet rashly want to resolve nature and life. Without a fixed master, they only heed the sound of the drum. Today they study this, tomorrow that; in the morning they bow to Li, in the evening to Wang, filling their belly with a jumble of ancient and miscellaneous wares. They act at will, and when injury comes, there is no cure; regret comes too late.

Some encounter illusions and false images, take them as proof, fail to distinguish right from wrong, and thus lose their future. Some meet a true teacher, but have no lasting thought, coming and going like a passing cloud. The root cause is all the same: no genuine master within. Thus, they hang suspended in emptiness and unreality, wasting away the years, an empty lifetime.

I urge those with true hearts who seek the dao: swiftly break through the gate of no mastery, firmly seize the master. First exhaust its principle, day and night apply your heart, delve into the true meaning, and taste its flavor. Do not bind yourself by years or months; the longer, the more effort. Delve and delve again, until a clear outline emerges, a true knowing arises. Naturally, the master grows firmer, and wisdom opens wider.

From then on, grasp this master firmly, never let go. Seek a teacher’s verification, carefully adjust the timing, receive guidance for application—only then can truth be attained. Even if you stray onto a wrong path, act improperly, or harbor doubts, do not hesitate to seek the wise, speak openly without concealment, inquire thoroughly to dispel doubts. Though truth may not be immediately found, calamity can be avoided.

Otherwise, without a true master, chaos and ruin follow; one cannot distinguish right from wrong, true from false; without a fixed master, though one seeks life, one hastens death; vainly imagining clarity of the dao—how difficult it is!
