# Gate of Swift Efficacy

==From the Great Learning== it is said: “Investigate things thoroughly, and then knowledge will reach its utmost; when knowledge reaches its utmost, the will becomes sincere; when the will is sincere, the heart is set right; when the heart is set right, the body is cultivated.”  
==From the Dao De Jing== it is said: “Great vessels take long to complete.”  

Master Shangyang said: “The great cultivator casts aside all the worries, sorrows, and hardships that cling in ordinary times; he lets go of all attachments and desires, calmly and effortlessly, without a single thread of clinging thought. Truly, one’s form becomes like withered wood, the heart like ashes cold and dead.”  

The ancient immortals declared: “If speech does not flow, one is no kin; if effort is lacking, one cannot be square and round.” They also said: “The return to the elixir is but a moment, yet refining oneself requires ten months.”  

All these words teach that the Way of cultivation must proceed step by step, gradually applying effort, day by day, until the fruits are attained. One must not leap ranks in haste, nor seek swift results with impatience. For the study of one’s nature and life—the path to long life and enduring vision—requires enduring resolve and persistent practice, deep years and distant days, with unceasing merit and power to bring matters to fruition. It cannot be achieved in a single morning or evening.  

Since time without beginning, human beings have piled up sins like mountains, and their offenses are as deep as the sea. In this present world, they carry with them the root-dust of kalpas past, seeds of reincarnation, and the inherited partial qi of the Five Phases. They are steeped in dust and defilement, tangled with a thousand demons and myriad monsters, all in chaotic confusion. These delusions bewilder the primordial spirit, exhaust the primordial qi, and steal the primordial essence.  

This consumes the true substance of the prior heaven until it is all digested and worn away, leaving the body pure yin. What remains is but a trace of subtle yang, hidden and unmanifest. If one wishes to uproot completely the root-dust seeds of kalpas and reincarnation, to transform and dissolve the partial qi of the later heaven, to clear away accumulated habits and old stains, this cannot be done without patient years and bitter effort.  

For as long as a single hair’s breadth of yang qi remains, there is no death; as long as a single hair’s breadth of yin qi remains, there is no immortality. Thus, the ancestral masters established the path of return, teaching disciples to work from the ground up. Step by step, exerting effort, moment by moment diligent in practice, gradually applying skill, until surely the yin qi is transformed and exhausted, and the yang qi pure and complete.  

What is called yin qi is the root-dust, partial qi, and habitual defilements of yin; what is called yang qi is the primordial spirit, primordial qi, and primordial essence of yang. Consider: to remove this yin and restore this yang—is this an easy matter, something one can cast off lightly or restore casually?  

This Way is not only difficult to practice and maintain, but even to clearly understand yin and yang is no simple task. Foolish scholars of the world, just entering the gate, already crave secret formulas; before learning the work, they dream of attaining the Way. Without thoroughly studying the scriptures or practicing merit, even when meeting a wise master, they foolishly imagine plucking treasures at will.  

They do not realize that the walls of a city worth a fortune are not easily taken; the pearl of mother and child is the hardest to seek. The wondrous Way of true cultivation is like those walls and pearls—one must invest effort and endure the years to see results. How could it be gained by chance?  

There are those who gain it by chance, but these are not from the main gate; they are crooked paths. Crooked paths and side doors yield quick results but success is hard to hold; in time, harm surely follows.  

As for the genuine great Way, it cultivates the formless qi of prior heaven; its results are hard to see but success is easy to attain, and in the long run, benefits are certain. Moreover, those who hear the Way are minor sages; those who attain the Way are great sages. To become a sage, one must have great virtue in ancestors, merit and practice in past kalpas, meet a wise master early in this life, and hear the great Way.  

If ancestors lack virtue and one’s own practice is scant, how could one hear the Way of the sages, or attain the position of sage? Yet, as a student, one must first exhaust human effort, with sincere will and bitter endurance, truly listening with the heart. Every step of practice brings its own benefit; ten steps bring ten benefits.  

Even if in this life one does not understand great matters, the roots are already planted, and hope remains for the next life. I urge those who truly wish to learn the Way: swiftly open the gate of swift efficacy. Set up a resolve that lasts without end; whenever you hear a good word or see a good deed, take it to heart and adopt it.  

Practice the elixir scriptures, draw near to a wise master, and apply effort in the present moment of your own body and life. Even if you cannot complete the great Way, you will become extraordinary, no longer a mere worker in the sea of suffering. Otherwise, without establishing long-lasting resolve, without holding eternal mind, rushing to see results, scorning diligence, you intend to ascend to Heaven but instead fall into the pit; you vainly imagine the bright Way, but it is difficult indeed.
