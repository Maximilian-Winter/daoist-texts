# Gate of Carelessness

The Most Sage said: “To learn without reflection is to be bewildered; to reflect without learning is perilous.” Again he said: “Review the old to know the new.” Mencius said: “The mind’s official is thought; when it thinks, it attains; when it does not, it fails.” The Awakener of Truth declared: “Common sayings often claim to harmonize with the sacred Dao, yet one must search carefully within.” If one seeks by inverting daily use, the dust and sand of the great earth all turn to treasure.

The ancient scriptures say: “To recognize the One, all affairs are complete; to wield the Two, the place of departure is known; to acknowledge the Three, no need to seek further.” These are all teachings urging the diligent to probe the principles with fine care—true knowledge and clear insight are essential; one must not be careless and dismissive.

The study of nature and life is weighty and vast, unlike the ordinary trifles of the world. It cannot be done by approximation or casual effort. A single error, however slight, when seeking longevity, may hasten death instead—how could one treat it lightly? Therefore, to comprehend nature and life, one must first thoroughly understand their principles, then proceed to act upon them.

The principle of nature and life is neither a tangible substance within the body, nor the heaviest or most turbid thing outside it. Here, both heavens and humans should be startled and doubtful. Those startled and doubtful ask: “If it is neither inside the body nor outside, where can it be grasped?”

Since ancient times, there have been three thousand six hundred side paths and three hundred sixty winding trails, each branching and dividing, each claiming its own gate. Passed down through errors, led by the blind guiding the blind, branches and twigs multiply ever more with time. Strange and bizarre, the ears are filled with clanging bells, and the eyes are veiled by buzzing bees and gnats.

There are matters utterly unseen and unimaginable, beyond ordinary entrance and exit; there are teachings utterly unlike the Dao, which only deceive the foolish and bewilder the lost, but cannot fool the wise. As for those seeming right yet false, seeming Dao yet not Dao, not Dao yet seeming Dao—these deceive not only the foolish but also the wise. Once caught in this net, one can never escape for a lifetime.

For example, the alchemical texts speak of yin and yang, the Five Phases, primordial essence, and primal qi. The strategists equate yin and yang with male and female—fools believe this, the wise do not. The cultivators say one breath out is yang, one breath in is yin—both fools and wise believe this. Some say the Five Phases are the heart, liver, spleen, lungs, and kidneys—fools believe this, the wise do not. Others say the Five Phases are spirit, soul, ethereal soul, and intention—both fools and wise believe this. Some say the primordial spirit is the god of thought, primordial qi is the breath, primordial essence is the essence of intercourse—fools believe this, the wise do not. Others say the primordial spirit dwells in the Heavenly Valley, primordial qi in the Sea of Qi, primordial essence in the Elixir Field—both fools and wise believe this.

Likewise, alchemical books mention the images of nature and life, the primal female and the Yellow Court. Some say kidney qi is life, heart spirit is nature—fools believe this, the wise do not. Some say fortune and misfortune, longevity and premature death are life; wisdom and folly, good and evil are nature—both fools and wise believe this. Some say the primal female is at the birth gate, the Yellow Court in the head—fools believe this, the wise do not. Others say the primal female is the throat, the Yellow Court at the navel wheel—both fools and wise believe this.

Again, alchemical texts speak of purity, emptiness, and the refining of the Golden Elixir. Some say inner alchemy must be cultivated in perfect purity and emptiness; outer alchemy requires gathering medicines, refining and ripening. Inner alchemy cultivation perfects nature; outer alchemy ingestion prolongs life—both fools and wise believe this.

All these side paths, seeming right but false, are the easiest to confuse people. How many brilliant talents and heroic spirits of old and new have been deceived? Their whole lives spent in vain, ending with no resolution.

Little do they know, the great Dao of cultivation is to cultivate the ancestral qi of primordial oneness. This qi is vague, obscure, and mysterious—called rare, called obscure, called subtle. It cannot be seen, cannot be heard, cannot be grasped. Yet though unseen, unheard, and ungraspable, it is truly the utmost void containing the utmost fullness, the utmost emptiness containing the utmost substance. It births Heaven and Earth, contains yin and yang, embraces the Five Phases; all principles are complete, all phenomena included.

It cannot be sought inside the body, nor found outside the body—it comes from the void and non-being. Nature and life dwell here; birth and death rest here; immortals and Buddhas are formed here; furnaces and cauldrons are settled here; medicines are gathered here; the fire’s timing is moved here; the Four Symbols harmonize here; the Five Phases gather here; the Golden Elixir is formed here; the sacred embryo is conceived here.

The reversal of yin and yang happens here; the secret theft of creation happens here; transcendence from the mundane to the sacred happens here. As for the primal female gate, the primal vital apertures, the Yellow Court, the earthen cauldron—all are here. The saying “to attain the One is to complete all affairs” refers to this.

This heavenly secret, this mystery of Heaven, Earth, ghosts, and gods, cannot be measured or fathomed. How could it be known by the ordinary or understood with ease? Only the greatly wise and greatly sagacious can know it; only those of great merit and great virtue can understand it; only those of great strength and great hardship can learn it; only those of great ambition and great breadth can advance; only those who pursue with fine care, endure long and deep, and lay down true effort can attain it.

Moreover, cultivation follows laws; its function depends on timing; its work has order; step by step it differs, changing and adapting with the times. Though one must delve on one’s own, one still seeks the guidance of a clear master.

As for the myriad volumes of alchemical scriptures, most use the manifest to compare with the unmanifest, the tangible to illustrate the intangible. How could carelessness grasp this? How could heedlessness see the truth? The muddled learners of the world cannot apply their minds, cannot endure hardship, cannot bear the passing years. A word or phrase, and they want instant enlightenment; seeming right but false, they wish to become Dao at once.

They accept the comparisons but do not probe the true meaning; they remember the phrases but do not savor the subtle taste. No wonder they see false books and perform false deeds; encounter side paths and take detours. They cannot distinguish true from false, right from wrong; they only say every gate has a way, every book unfolds truth. They rashly create chaos and bring disaster upon themselves. All this arises from carelessness and lack of fine attention.

I urge the true-hearted seekers of the Dao: swiftly open the gate of carelessness! Diligently probe, strip away layer upon layer of principle, awaken one insight and advance one step. You must separate the false from the true, discern right from wrong, see the essence of principle, know the crucial hinge of the Dao. When your own heart is clear and truly trustworthy, one principle runs through all; you see that all things under Heaven and Earth are thus.

Left and right, front and back, the Dao’s qi fills and overflows. This is true knowledge and true vision, great awakening and great clarity, no longer deluded by attachment to form or emptiness. Otherwise, without fine probing, careless and dismissive, knowing thus but not truly seeing thus, you remain in confusion and doubt, vainly imagining you can leap directly to the shore of the Dao—it is difficult indeed.
