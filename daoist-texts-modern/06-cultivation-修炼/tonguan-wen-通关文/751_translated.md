# The Gate of Wasted Time

The Most Sage declared:  
“Young ones are to be feared—how can one know that those yet to come will not surpass them? But those who reach forty or fifty years without renown—these too are no longer to be feared.”  

The Perfected One of Ziyang sighed and said:  
“Alas! The human body is hard to obtain; the flow of time is swift and unrelenting. One cannot fathom the length or brevity of life—how then can one escape the retribution of past deeds? If one does not awaken early, but only sweetly awaits the end, then at the crossroads, a single errant thought will cast one down into the Three Paths of evil destinies. There, through countless kalpas of dust and suffering, no release shall come.”  

The Perfected One of Sanfeng said:  
“Bow before a wise master, inquire of the methods, and begin swiftly to cultivate—yet even this may be too late.”  

All these words urge the seeker: in youth, seize the moment and diligently study; do not waste the years in vain. The sun and moon pass swiftly, time flies like an arrow; a hundred years of life vanish in the blink of an eye. In this world, all things are but illusions—only one’s nature and life are real.  

Those who cherish life must, while still strong and vigorous in youth, set their resolve firmly, press forward with courage and vigor, with a single pure thought, seeking masters and friends. With sincere will, learn and learn again, until you find the saving method that frees life and resolves the causes of worldly entanglement.  

Do not wait until breath fails, spirit dims, muscles and bones grow weak—then you cannot return to the origin, nor regain the root. When the great transformation of the times comes, would it not be a tragic waste of this mortal journey?  

For in youth, when strength is abundant, one can endure hunger, cold, and hardship; the spirit is swift, the vital energy abundant, making effort easier. The path ahead is long, full of potential. One must never waste the years, muddle through days, and thus err in preserving life.  

Therefore, the ancients treasured every inch of time, vigilant from dawn to dusk, never letting a moment slip away empty. Yet foolish learners of the world do not know how to set their will upon cultivation. They cling to worldly affairs, cannot see through fame and profit, cannot let go of their salary and clothing. They mistake the false for the true, scheming day and night, drunk on life’s illusions, inviting their own troubles and suffering.  

They carry all emotions—joy, anger, sorrow, and delight—and fully embrace greed, hatred, delusion, and love. They waste effort on what is useless, neglect what is beneficial. They neither discern principle in the sacred scriptures nor listen to teachings from wise masters and good friends, only seeking abundant clothes and ample food.  

They gather in groups, speak idle talk, birth tangled thoughts in their hearts, act in confused ways—thus foolishly missing the passing of time. When the day comes that the King of the Underworld demands his due, what will they offer in payment? They never think that time does not wait for them; once gone, it will not return.  

Not valuing the great matter of life, they instead harm their bodies, injure their lives with external affairs. Thus, the years that could be used are cast into uselessness—how lamentable!  

I urge those who truly seek the dao with sincere hearts: swiftly break through the Gate of Wasted Time. Keep your nature and life always in your heart. Every movement, every word, never forget them. When you meet a master and receive instruction, when you encounter friends to study with—even if the great dao remains unclear—do not squander the years. In the end, you will become a good person and avoid creating karmic offenses.  

If you concentrate your spirit and will, endure great hardship, and establish great merit, the divine spirits will silently protect you, true masters will recognize you, and the great dao may be hoped for. Otherwise, if you do not cherish life, if your spirit flagging, wasting your years in vain and vainly dreaming of immortality, it will be difficult indeed.
