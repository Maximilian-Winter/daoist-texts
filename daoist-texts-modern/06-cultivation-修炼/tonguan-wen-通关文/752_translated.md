# The Gate of Retreating Resolve

The *Yi Jing* says: “The great fruit is not eaten; the gentleman gains the carriage, the petty man strips the hut.” The ancient immortals say: “At seventy or eighty, if even a single breath remains, one can still return the elixir.” Master Sanfeng declared: “Grafting plum onto willow, mulberry onto pear—these are methods handed down to cultivators of truth to set the pattern. Since ancient times, the immortals have known the art of grafting; when old age comes, there is always medicine to heal.” All these words teach that the elderly must not lose heart or retreat in resolve, nor abandon halfway. One must cherish learning in old age, grow ever more diligent with passing years, and labor until death itself.

The way of the Golden Elixir is to return to root and restore life, to reverse old age and return to youth, to repeatedly graft and reconnect life. Returning to youth is not merely about changing shape or appearance, nor about a face like a child’s. It is about returning to root and restoring life, returning to the spirit, full and complete in qi, without loss or deficiency—the original face given by mother’s birth. This original face is not hard to return to; the real trouble is that people lack willpower and perseverance. Though old and weak in strength, the primordial spiritual root has never been entirely extinguished; it is only that the acquired guest qi has been worn away and depleted. If one meets a bright master and sincerely seeks the method of grafting and connection, applying effort in cultivation and practice—raising yang qi, reducing yin qi—raising and raising again, reducing and reducing again, until there is nowhere left to raise or reduce; what was depleted is made whole, what was absent returns. One then becomes once more a complete original being, intact and entire as in youth.

This is returning to root and restoring life; this is reversing old age and returning to youth; this is the method of grafting life. When life is grafted and fixed, my life is mine, not Heaven’s. One can then embark on upward endeavors, straight to the sacred realm. What illness is there in old age? In the past, Immortal Ge at sixty heard the dao and attained the rank of Spirit Soaring Minister; Lüzu at fifty-four heard the dao and perfected the Great Luo Heaven immortal; Ziqing at sixty-four heard the dao and perfected the indestructible true body; Sanfeng at over seventy heard the dao and perfected the Ten Extremes Great Luo True Person. These ancestors all attained the dao in old age. What need is there to be bound by young or old in cultivation? Thus, those with resolve will attain the dao even if old; those without resolve will not attain the dao even if young. How great indeed is the power of resolve!

Yet in this world, foolish learners, when young, neither humble themselves nor apply their hearts, wasting their years. When old, their hearts grow cold and their spirits weary; they think to retreat and take up other affairs. Some meet a bright master early and catch the fragrant breeze of the dao, but lacking their own diligent effort, their cultivation is faint and wavering. Delayed until old age, they resign themselves to weakness and confusion, then stop moving forward. All such cases begin with diligence and end in slackness, thus ruining their future. Who else can be blamed?

One must know: first exhaust human effort, then await Heaven’s decree. Each step taken is one less step to go; each task done is one less to do. Fix the thought to labor until death. Even if one cannot ascend to the summit of a thousand peaks, climbing halfway up the mountain is a world apart from those who remain at the foot. If, because of old age, one retreats in resolve, lays down the four elements flat, refuses to advance, and draws one’s own limits—this is called “the King of Hell does not summon you; you deliver yourself to death.”

I urge those who sincerely seek the dao: swiftly break through the gate of retreating resolve. One must be old in years but strong in will, and earnest in affairs. Occasionally great matters may not succeed, but the roots of past cultivation are planted. In future lives, one will emerge ahead of others and surely attain the dao. If one has great virtue and great power, fearing neither life nor death, one can resolve matters in this very world. Otherwise, if one resigns to old age and refuses effort, retreating in resolve, then when the turning point comes, one will be flustered and confused, with nowhere to return—how difficult that will be!
