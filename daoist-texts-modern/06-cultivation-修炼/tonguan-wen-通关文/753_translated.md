# The Gate of Boasting and Praise

The Venerable Ancestor said: “Many words lead to exhaustion; it is better to guard the center.”  
The Most Sage declared: “The superior person desires to be slow in speech yet swift in action.”  
The *Jade Pivot Scripture* teaches: “Enter with sincerity.”  
The ancient immortals said: “The wise do not speak; those who speak are not wise.”  

All these instruct us to be honest and diligent in practice, not to puff ourselves up with empty noise and show. The way of cultivating the true is the most refined and subtle, the most detailed and profound. One must inquire with care, ponder with caution, delve deeply into the subtle beginnings, and through long days of effort, only then will the genuine appear. One must fix the mind firmly, plant the feet solidly on the ground, and with increasing duration and diligence, only then can truth be attained. It is not something to be done half-heartedly, like scratching an itch through one’s boot, nor is it to be treated lightly with arrogance and empty bridges built in the air.  

If one’s understanding of the dao is even slightly confused, or one’s practice of the dao is even a little suspended in illusion, not only can one not walk the path, one cannot even truly know it. Therefore, those who study the dao must aim to reach true knowledge and clear vision, and truly walk and realize in practice—that is what is precious.  

In the world, foolish learners, after a few efforts, boast that they have the dao, counting the yellow and white paths, mixing their words in public, speaking confusedly and disorderly. After a few days of fiddling, seeing some slight effect, they claim to have attained the dao, putting on airs, looking down on others. All this is mere display of spirit, claiming ignorance as knowledge, calling falsehood truth, boasting of their ability, and selling their reputation.  

Little do they know that the study of nature and life is originally for oneself, not for others; it is to attend to the inner, not the outer. Before hearing the dao, one eagerly seeks knowledge and must carefully discern to exhaust principle. After hearing the dao, one eagerly seeks practice and must quietly cultivate and refine, applying effort with a single taste from beginning to end, sincerely handling affairs with no divided thought.  

What is called “using the will without division” is to condense into spirit. What leisure is there then to boast before others, to clamour for fame, or to fish for praise? I urge those who sincerely study the dao to swiftly open the gate of boasting and praise. Be foolish and slow of speech, cautious in word and deed; do not hold yourself superior, do not seek empty fame; take your nature and life as precious, and advance with true heart and real intent.  

Those who have not heard the dao should bow their heads to learn it; those who have heard the dao should bow their heads to cultivate it. When the time comes that功果 (merit and fruit) are complete and full, with utmost sincerity and prior knowing, and spirit-power vast and great, one will neither boast nor praise oneself, yet all will praise one; one will neither exalt nor raise oneself, yet all will exalt one. Only after a hundred generations will speakers commend, listeners admire, and the teaching be passed on forever without decay. Why then seek to boast and praise oneself for empty fame?  

Otherwise, to have nothing and claim to have something, to be empty and claim to be full—this is self-satisfaction, deceiving oneself and others, vainly imagining attainment of the dao. Difficult indeed.
