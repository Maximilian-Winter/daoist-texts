# The Gate of Illusory Visions

The Master of Awakening Truth said:  
Without moving a single step, one arrives at the Western Heaven; seated upright, all directions unfold before the eyes. Behind the nape of the neck, a radiance still counts as illusion; clouds rising beneath the feet do not yet mark one as an immortal.  
He further said: A maiden clad in azure robes, a gentleman draped in pure white silk—  
To behold them is impossible to use; to employ them is impossible to see.  

Master Sanfeng said:  
Emptiness is form, form is emptiness; to see through this is to find true emptiness within form.  
Clearly, true emptiness has no color or shape; yet the dharma’s form endures, never falling into emptiness.  

All these speak of the great Dao as formless and without image, unattached to illusory visions. The path of nature and life is the way of the true constant. The way of the true constant is not strange or marvelous; it has no form or color, no contrivance, no striving—just naturalness itself, plain and ordinary.  

Thus the Old Lord calls it “natural,” the Sage Confucius calls it “the Mean,” and Shakyamuni calls it “non-abidance.” Only those among humankind who walk the path do not truly know it.  

Because after birth, qi and temperament, nature and life, fall under the sway of later Heaven’s creation; following the shaping of yin and yang, inside arise wild thoughts in confusion, outside the six gates entice and lure. Inside and outside attack each other, and what was originally natural turns unnatural; the Mean becomes unbalanced; non-abidance becomes attachment. The true becomes latent while the false bursts forth, losing its original face.  

Therefore, the Patriarchs established methods to extend life, entering from the realm of doing into non-doing, progressing gradually through cultivation until sudden enlightenment, then returning to naturalness, the Mean, non-abidance—true constancy, eternal and unbroken. Never beyond naturalness, the Mean, non-abidance, or true constancy is there any addition or subtraction.  

Though they speak of seizing creation, reversing birth and death, opposing yin and yang, twisting the workings of qi, forming the Golden Elixir, condensing the sacred embryo, having a body outside the body, and so forth—these are but the perfection of one true constant reality. How could one borrow all manner of forms and substances that are not of the same kind?  

Since it is called true constancy, what image could it have? If there were an image, it would not be true constancy, nor natural, nor the Mean, nor non-abidance.  

Foolish scholars in the world, hearing talk of the Golden Elixir, suspect it must have the image of an elixir; hearing of the moonlight of the toad, suspect it must have the image of light; hearing of the waning moon, suspect it must have the image of the moon; hearing of rosy clouds, suspect it must have the image of clouds; hearing of red radiance, suspect it must have the image of red light; hearing of forming the embryo, suspect it must have the image of a fetus; hearing of the one aperture of the primal gate, suspect it must have the image of a gate; hearing of the primal female gate, suspect it must have the image of a door.  

Even more, those of side doors and outer paths, practicing inner observation, see the five viscera and claim to have seen true images. Or sitting in stillness, hearing celestial music and seeing radiant light, claim to have produced visions. Or walking, standing, and imagining, their spirits roam fairy realms and grotto heavens, seeing dragons, phoenixes, towers, and terraces, and claim these as true visions. Or fixing their gaze on one spot, after a long time their spirit light scatters outward, flickering bright and dim, and claim to have attained visions. Or silently facing the Supreme Emperor, after long time their spirit leaves the chamber, clouds come and go, feeling they are in the void, and claim the Dao has formed visions. Or circulating qi in reverse, feeling the upper and lower revolve, bones and joints penetrate through, and claim to have opened gates and visions. Or ingesting qi and feasting on rosy clouds, feeling rumblings in the abdomen, something in the elixir field, and claim to have formed elixir visions.  

All these sorts of things are mistaking illusions for reality, taking the false as true. At best, they suffer illness; at worst, they harm their nature and life.  

Little do they know the way of true constancy is neither form nor emptiness, without shape or image—how could there be strange and marvelous illusions?  

When the great Dao is fulfilled, there is a body outside the body; form and spirit both wondrous, united with the Dao and true reality. Formless gives rise to true form; imageless gives rise to real image. Gathered, it becomes form; dispersed, it transforms into qi. Having is still non-being; non-being is truly having. Being and non-being do not stand apart, sharing the same substance as empty space—what image could there be?  

Not only do side doors and outer paths produce illusions that are not the Dao, but even those who cultivate the orthodox path, with deep功 and long days, when consciousness acts up, also manifest strange illusions to ruin our Dao. Sometimes they report auspicious or inauspicious signs; sometimes transform into ghosts and monsters; sometimes into beautiful women, immortals, and children; sometimes into tigers, leopards, wolves, snakes, and so forth, all manner of strange forms.  

If one pays the slightest heed, lead flies and mercury runs—great matters are ruined. Generally speaking, the orthodox path has no illusions; illusions are not the orthodox path.  

In sum, do not recognize illusions as wondrous. I urge the true-hearted who study the Dao: swiftly break through the Gate of Illusory Visions, sweep away all attachments to form, emptiness, stillness, and the like. From the place of natural true constancy, keep your heart and exhaust inquiry; there will be an image without image, a real principle empty yet not empty, by which you can understand nature and understand life.  

Otherwise, taking illusions as true not only ruins great matters in side doors, but also ruins great matters in the orthodox path—and to attain the Dao becomes difficult indeed.
