# The Gate of Shame and Humiliation

The *Dao De Jing* says: “The rivers and seas can become kings of a hundred valleys because they excel at placing themselves below.” The *Diamond Sutra* teaches: “The perfection of patience in enduring humiliation.” The great masters have transmitted: “Having passed through five hundred kalpas, enduring the utmost length of time before and after, relying on the power of the immortal’s patience in humiliation, one now attains the true constant.” All these speak of those who cultivate the dao, valuing above all the capacity to bear shame and humiliation.

Those who carry the dao within their being have hearts like mountains, and their breadth is like the sea. Mountains, as things, see clouds come and mists go, following their own course; forests are veiled by snow, winds blow fire and heat, all as they will—but the mountain’s essence remains unmoved, unshaken, eternal through the ages. Those who learn the dao hold their resolve firm; when poverty comes, they do not know shame; when calamity strikes, they do not falter—their hearts remain just so.

The sea, as a thing, receives waters both turbid and sweet, bitter and fresh; the nine rivers and eight streams flow into it without limit; the soft-shelled turtles, alligators, dragons, and giant clams hide beneath its depths, yet the sea’s fundamental measure neither grows nor shrinks, enduring forever. Those who learn the dao can endure humiliation and accept defilement; when faced with adversity, they do not contend; dwelling in lowliness, they feel no shame—their breadth is just so.

It is precisely those who cultivate life and nature who can bear what others cannot bear, and thus carry what others cannot carry. Hence, Master Zhong wore a tattered hemp robe and stood alongside those clad in fox and raccoon pelts without shame. Yan Zi, with a single bowl of food and a single gourd of drink, lived in a shabby alley; others could not bear his hardship, yet Yan Zi did not alter his joy. Zeng Zi wore a hemp robe without adornment, his complexion swollen and raw; for three days he did not light a fire, for ten years he made no new clothes; he wore his cap straight though his tassel was broken, grasped his collar while his elbows showed, wore his shoes though the heels were split, and dragged his feet singing the Shang hymns, his voice ringing like metal and stone.

Changchun endured the blows of wicked men, accepting them without dispute; Ziqing suffered insults and curses, welcoming them joyfully without complaint. These sages and worthies all had great plans within, and all external hardships and disrespectful treatment were disregarded as nothing.

Yet the confused learners of the world, indulging their nature and acting from the heart, when placed in poverty and hardship, see the wealthy and noble and feel shame; they do not remain calm, but when met with injustice and insult, their anger flares. They stumble and clash, giving rise to ignorance; if words offend them slightly, they must argue and debate. There is an even greater folly among fools who falsely aspire to learn the dao yet do not honor it. Some lean on their rank when questioning, some on their wisdom, some on their age, some on their merits and achievements, some on their past—none willing to be humble or sincerely seek. Some, in full view of all, puff up their status, swaggering and grand, unable to bow their heads for fear of ridicule.

Little do they know that those who are arrogant never truly become great; those who are self-respecting never truly gain respect. With such conduct, even if the ancestral masters stood before them, even if immortals shared their chamber, what benefit would there be?

I urge those who sincerely seek the dao to swiftly open the gate of shame and humiliation. Cast all worldly affairs of false shame and false humiliation beyond measure. Instead, take up the true shame and true humiliation that obstruct understanding and attainment of the dao. Fix your resolve firmly and strive onward, and boundless good fortune will surely come.

Otherwise, if you take shamelessness as shame, and humiliation as humiliation, eager to contend and prevail, only wishing others to submit to you while refusing to submit yourself; only knowing how to be above others, never how to be below—then to imagine hearing the dao will be most difficult indeed.
