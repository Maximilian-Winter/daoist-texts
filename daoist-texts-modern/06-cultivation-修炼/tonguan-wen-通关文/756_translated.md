# The Gate of Cause and Effect

The *Yi Jing* says: “In a household that accumulates goodness, there will surely be abundant blessings; in a household that accumulates wrongdoing, there will surely be lingering calamities.” The *Shu* states: “Perform good deeds, and a hundred auspicious signs descend; perform evil deeds, and a hundred disasters befall.” Again it says: “Heaven’s punishments may yet be avoided; self-inflicted crimes leave no chance for survival.” The *Can Tong* teaches: “If the beginning is upright, the end will be perfected; if the foundation is unstable, it cannot be maintained.” The Master Zhengyang says: “Sow hemp and you shall reap hemp; sow millet and you shall reap millet.” All these speak to the truth that where there is cause, there must be effect. In all matters, carefulness at the start naturally brings completion at the end.

Indeed, throughout Heaven and Earth, all things great and small abide by cause and effect. Good has its causes and effects; evil has its causes and effects. Those who do good are sowing the seeds of goodness; the good retribution is the fruit thereof. Those who do evil are sowing the seeds of evil; the evil retribution is the fruit thereof. Good and evil returns follow like shadow and form, not a hair’s breadth amiss. Therefore, the superior person guards cautiously what cannot be seen, fears what cannot be heard. Every thought returns to goodness, allowing not even a trace of evil to arise within the heart’s chamber. No improper step is taken, no unrighteous path trod; every action is good, leaving not a single evil deed to appear in daily life.

Thought by thought, deed by deed, rooted in goodness, the fruit is never otherwise. Observe the world: those who kill pay with their lives; those who save are repaid with gratitude. Good begets good; evil begets evil. This is cause and effect responding to each other, natural and unerring. It is said: a single good thought is heaven itself; a single evil thought is hell itself. Heaven and hell are but self-made realms. Mencius said: “Fortune and misfortune are all sought by oneself.” Laozi said: “Fortune and misfortune have no gates; people themselves invite them in.” Witnessing this, is the principle of cause and effect not clear and manifest?

Yet in the world, foolish learners disbelieve cause and effect. They harm others to benefit themselves, wound Heaven and violate principle, leaving no evil undone. Some deceive the Ten Directions, thinking themselves clever; some feign the dao to fool the ignorant; some borrow yellow and white arts to ruin households; some use forbidden elixirs to lead others astray; some slander the wise with twisted tongues; some plot in shadows to spoil good deeds. All these are disbelief in cause and effect. Little do they know, doing good or evil is the path of cultivating outcomes. Cultivate the path of good, and in the future the Creator will send you along the good path to enjoy blessings; cultivate the path of evil, and in the future the Creator will send you along the evil path to endure punishment.

As the proverb says: “To know the affairs of past lives, see what is received in this life; to know the affairs of future lives, see what is done in this life.” This is true beyond doubt. If one does not believe in the afterlife, then look at the present life: the young who do good receive blessings in old age; the young who do evil suffer punishment in old age. This is known and seen by all. I urge those who sincerely seek the dao to swiftly open the gate of cause and effect. Every thought, every deed demands carefulness; every movement, every stillness must not be neglected. First learn to be a good person who does no harm and creates no crime; then understand the greater matters to strive for advancement—only then is there hope.

If cause and effect are ignored, yet one seeks the dao while committing crimes knowingly or unknowingly, piling sin upon sin, then to hear the dao is a vain hope indeed.
