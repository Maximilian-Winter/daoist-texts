# The Gate of the Book Demon

The Awakening to Truth says:  
The Song of the Contracted Treatise on the Scripture expounds the utmost truth, yet does not fix the fire’s timing upon mere words.  
If you wish to grasp the secret formula that connects to the primordial source, you must deliberate carefully together with the spirits and immortals.  

It also says:  
Within the hexagrams, the set images are the original forms;  
when you attain the image, forget the words, and the meaning becomes clear by itself.  
The whole world’s confused disciples cling only to the images, yet follow the hexagram’s qi hoping to ascend and fly.  

Master Shangyang said:  
The Great Dao has always been a strong name;  
the Yin Talisman’s dao and virtue first preserve the scripture.  
The immortals’ successive elixir scriptures continue on,  
how could secret formulas be plainly revealed on paper?  

All these words teach that one must not cling exclusively to the scriptures.  
The scriptures and classic treatises, with their thousands of comparisons and myriad metaphors, serve to open the path for later generations of learners, pointing to the Great Dao, cleaving away error and revealing truth.  
Within them, the authenticity of medicines, their effects and faults, the order of procedures, the cultivation of nature and life—nothing is left unaddressed.  

Yet their words are hidden and subtle, their principles profound and mysterious;  
they use the manifest to compare the unmanifest, the image to signify the imageless.  
This is not something to be skimmed and understood lightly, nor grasped by private conjecture.  
Moreover, the study of nature and life is unlike worldly things with form and image that can be plainly spoken or written.  

As for the nature of life itself, the subtlety of the Great Dao—if you discuss it, you err; if you speak of it, you lose it.  
Though the elixir scriptures and treatises strive to describe it, what is said falls short, what is written cannot fully express it; those who can speak and write it are only approximating.  

Those who study the dao must apply their hearts to delve deeply;  
once they grasp the general outline, they can recognize the gates and distinguish right from wrong.  
From there, seeking a clear master will bring true progress.  

If one clings to the scriptures and guesses by one’s own bias, claiming the dao lies therein, and never returns to the true path with a genuine master, the error is grave indeed.  
Therefore, to abandon the scriptures entirely and not reason at all is a great mistake;  
to cling to the scriptures and yet not seek a teacher is an even greater mistake.  
To discard the book or to cling to the book—both are wrong.  

Ignorant learners in the world glance through a few volumes of elixir texts, and when they see mention of lead, mercury, sand, and silver, they reject them as mere burning of weeds;  
when they see talk of male and female, self and other, they dismiss it as mere gathering and plucking;  
when they see dragons, tigers, turtles, and snakes, they do not doubt these mean liver and lungs, but instead take them for heart and kidneys;  
when they see reversed and inverted movements, they do not doubt these mean later ascent, but think them earlier steps;  
when they see the saying of purity and non-action, they do not doubt it means emptiness and stillness, but guess it means holding onto thoughts;  
when they see the saying of skillful doing, they do not doubt it means moving and transporting, but mistake it for twisting and turning;  
when they see mentions of the Mud Pellet, Yellow Court, Primordial Pass, Gate of Wonders, Kunlun Peak, and so forth, they suspect these are bodily places with physical apertures;  
when they see the Valley Spirit, Infant, Sacred Embryo, Golden Elixir, Dharma Body, and such, they suspect these are congealings of qi and blood within the body.  

Such errors are countless, each relying on their own views, each picking their own gate, taking falsehood for truth, living a trivial life, and never accomplishing anything.  
Not only is this useless, it causes harm.  

The root cause is all due to clinging to the book as the dao, not seeking a clear master, falling into the Book Demon, and thus ruining the great matter.  

The Sage said:  
“Learn extensively, inquire carefully.”  
If you only learn extensively but do not inquire carefully, it is like being cleverer than Yan Hui, yet without meeting a true master, forced to guess blindly.  

I urge those who sincerely seek the dao to swiftly break through the Gate of the Book Demon.  
Do not be misled by the books; first, carefully savor the scriptures, distinguish right from wrong, firmly recognize the gate, and seek a clear master to verify truth and error.  

Never be self-conceited, thinking you know when you do not, and hastily conclude matters.  
Otherwise, clinging to the book as the dao, imagining you have attained it, your vain hopes to become the dao will be hard indeed.
