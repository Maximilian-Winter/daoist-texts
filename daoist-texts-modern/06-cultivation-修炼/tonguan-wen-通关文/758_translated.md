# Opening the Gate of Emptiness

The Buddha said: Those who awaken the mind aspiring to Anuttara-samyak-sambodhi do not speak of the dharma as mere cessation or annihilation. The wise Chan Master said: Every dharma gives birth to wondrous dharmas; emptiness itself is not empty in essence; cessation is not mere cessation. Wisdom awakens to the profound lineage. The Heart Sutra declares: Shariputra, form is no different from emptiness, emptiness no different from form. Form is emptiness, emptiness is form.

The Master of Awakening Truth said: Even if you fully realize the true nature of suchness, you risk abandoning the body only to re-enter it again. How much better to also cultivate the Great Medicine, instantly transcending all defilements to become a true perfected person.

The Disciple of the Governor said: Nowadays, those who study the dao fail to receive the genuine transmission. They do not understand the saying of Master Pingshu: “Do not enter the mountains before refining the returning elixir.” They only seek to avoid noise and find quietude, fleeing the world and distancing themselves from others. They abandon wives and children, leave behind dust and vulgarity, dwelling alone in remote valleys and deep mountains, thinking themselves exalted. Such people have in truth abandoned the worldly dharmas.

Master Sanfeng said: Do not boast twice over of your quietude and non-action, yet still obtain the returning elixir. All these speak of the Great Dao as true emptiness yet not empty, not the stubborn emptiness of silence and annihilation.

For the dao is that which contains the utmost non-being and yet embraces the utmost being; the utmost void and yet opens to the utmost reality. It is empty yet not empty, not empty yet empty—thus the dharma employs both, uniting being and non-being, non-action yet nothing is left undone.

Consider Heaven and Earth: they act without action, yet all things are born. The sun and moon move without effort, yet the four seasons turn. The sage governs the world without striving, yet all under Heaven is in order. This is action within non-action, not the doctrine of empty emptiness and non-action.

If one were to take empty emptiness and non-action as the dao, then the dao would be a dead thing—not the dao of Heaven and Earth, sun and moon, or the sage. It would be like carved wood or molded clay, useless and lifeless. How could such a thing be called the dao?

The so-called dao is a path, a road. People travel on paths; if no one walks, it is no path. Thus, in the study of nature and life, one must first seek knowledge, then strive in practice. Knowledge is the basis for practice, practice perfects knowledge.

Moreover, those who cultivate the true are cultivating practice. What is the study of empty silence? How can it be called practice? To guard emptiness is acceptable; to call it practice is not.

Hence the stubborn emptiness of things—ancient sages mocked it as grinding bricks to make a mirror, or piling snow to make food—because it is void but not real.

Confused worldly learners do not investigate the source and flow of the dao, nor distinguish right from wrong in principle. Some lose heart and stop thinking, forgetting things and form; some guard empty valleys and quietude, not a speck of dust touched; some fix their mind on a single aperture, nourishing qi and preserving spirit; some gaze at the crown of the head, their intent unscattered; some stare into mirrors, hoping to transcend; some hold thoughts in the bright hall, imagining a red pearl.

All such practices belong to stubborn emptiness and cessation, not true cultivation of the dao. They are in fact ignorance of the dao. How then can they return to the root, realize nature and life, harmonize form and spirit, unite with the dao’s truth, and transcend yin and yang and creation itself?

Furthermore, since birth, humans receive the partial qi of post-heaven yin and yang and the Five Phases, while carrying the mixed qi of karmic dust from countless kalpas of reincarnation. Without the great method to enlighten the myriad yin, the power to reverse creation’s course, how can mere empty emptiness and non-action complete the task? How can one turn yin into yang, uproot the seeds of karmic suffering through kalpas?

I urge those with true hearts who study the dao: swiftly open the gate of emptiness! Urgently seek a clear master, find a method to arise, to be reborn, to truly ground yourself in reality. Begin your effort early; do not chase wind or catch shadows, quench thirst with plums, wasting your future and emptying your years.

Otherwise, empty emptiness and non-action, with nothing grasped or held—what real benefit is there? To vainly imagine becoming the dao is most difficult indeed.
