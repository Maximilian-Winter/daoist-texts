# Holding Fast to the Essentials

The Diamond Sutra declares: One must not behold the Tathāgata by his thirty-two marks.  
The Scripture of Perfect Enlightenment says: This body of mine is but a temporary union of the Four Great Elements.  
The Awakening to Reality teaches: The yang’s yang essence and yin’s yin substance are not firm; cultivating alone one thing turns frail and weak.  
Laboring the form and pressing the shadow are not the dao; swallowing breath and feasting on rosy clouds are all madness.  

Furthermore, the later preface states: Today’s seekers take lead and mercury as the two energies, point to the viscera as the Five Phases, divide heart and kidney as Kan and Li, regard liver and lungs as dragon and tiger, treat spirit and breath as father and mother, clutch saliva and fluids as lead and mercury, yet fail to discern floating and sinking, nor distinguish host from guest. How is this different from mistaking another’s wealth for one’s own, or calling a stranger’s child one’s own son?  

The ancient immortals say: Do not cling to this body as the dao; beyond this body there is the true body. All this means not to hold the colored body as the dao.  

The Way of cultivating the True, the Way of the Primordial, the Primordial Way can transform the formless into form, can bring the unmanifest into manifest, can seize upon creation, steal yin and yang, reverse the workings of qi, and transcend birth and death. This is not comparable to all those who merely work on the colored body.  

The colored body is a temporary union of the Four Great Elements, outside are eyes, ears, nose, tongue, and mouth; inside are heart, liver, spleen, lungs, and kidneys; along with bones, joints, and orifices—all are false things. Is there a single true piece among them? When the great limit arrives, all become a heap of rotten bones and foul flesh. If one clings to this body to cultivate, how can one understand nature and life, or escape birth and death?  

Therefore, the Old Patriarch said: The great trouble I have lies in having a body; when I have no body, what trouble do I have? It is clear that the colored body is the great trouble of human life. Because it is the great trouble, the Patriarch left behind the Great Way of the Golden Elixir, teaching people to cultivate nature and life, to abandon the false and preserve the true, to escape this great illusion.  

Escaping the great trouble, there remains the one without trouble. The one without trouble is the true body. The true body is also called the dharma body, also called the yang spirit. When this body is perfected, it does not drown in water, does not burn in fire, passes through metal and stone unhindered, cannot be forged by yin and yang, cannot be bound by creation, endures as long as Heaven and Earth, shines as brightly as sun and moon. How can those who cultivate the colored body ever reach this state?  

Foolish worldly learners cannot distinguish right from wrong, true from false; they study in confusion and act recklessly, like walking at night or dreaming while working. Some shake bones and swing marrow, some push forward and move backward, some tear the east and patch the west, some move qi to strike the crown gate, some force essence upward to the brain, some practice the Eight Brocade to enliven bones, some use the Six Syllable Formula to raise qi, some take the space between the two kidneys as the primal gate, some take the front of the kidneys and back of the navel as the Yellow Court, some take mouth and nose as the mysterious female gate, some take the cinnabar field as the root of life, some take the heavenly valley as the ground of nature, some take heart and kidneys as infant boys and girls, some take liver and lungs as Azure Dragon and White Tiger, some inhale qi past the navel wheel to the cinnabar field as fetal breath, some move qi to strike the three gates, reaching behind the brain as the opening gate.  

There are still those who wipe their eyes and swallow saliva, inhale purity and exhale turbidity, touch the navel and press the bowels, and so on—countless manipulations and actions—all are called clinging to appearances, all are laboring on the skin and flesh bag, breaking into the pouch to play tricks, utterly separated from the Primordial Way of nature and life, as distant as Heaven is from Earth.  

When the appointed years and months end, one holds nothing—how can this not be grievous!  

I urge those with true hearts seeking the dao to swiftly open the gate of holding fast to the essentials. Truly fix the words nature and life in your practice, pursue and trace their whereabouts. What is nature? What is life? Where does nature reside? Where does life lodge?  

If you can clearly distinguish and truly recognize the words nature and life, you will know that nature and life are not in eyes, ears, nose, mouth, tongue, or body; not in heart, liver, spleen, lungs, or kidneys; not in the three hundred and sixty bones and joints; not in the four limbs, the hundred vessels, or the blood. There is another secret thing without place or form, without shape or image. Not inside, not outside, but right in the realm of emptiness and solitude.  

From here, progress has a foothold, and you will not mistake the false for the true, nor be misled by side paths. Otherwise, not knowing what nature and life are, fumbling blindly all over the body, making false moves where there is form and substance, vainly imagining attainment of the dao—this is difficult indeed.
