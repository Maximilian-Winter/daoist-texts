# The Chamber Elixir Gate

The Venerable Ancestor said: Among all evils, lust is foremost. The Master of Realization said: “Within the chamber, when the tailgate cavity is sealed in vain, countless souls in Jambudvīpa are mistakenly slain.” The ancient scriptures declare: “If one speaks of the Three Peaks’ hunting arts, they would surely cause the Nine Patriarchs to sink into perdition.” All these words refer to the mastery of women’s chamber elixirs—not only do they bring no benefit to life and destiny, but they greatly diminish one’s yin virtue.

Now, the so-called Golden Elixir is the original root itself. This elixir, this root, is possessed by all; each and every one is perfectly complete. In the sage, it neither increases; in the elixir, it neither decreases. Originally, nature and life are one family—yin and yang blended, the Five Phases sharing the same breath. There is nothing to cultivate, nothing to prove. Yet because primordial yang reaches its peak before heaven, and postnatal yin is born thereafter, nature and life dwell in two places, yin and yang stand apart, the Five Phases are disordered; what is full suffers loss, what is round suffers deficiency. Day after day, year after year, the losses deepen, the deficiencies widen, until the original root is utterly lost, buried and unmanifested.

Therefore, the Patriarchs devised the Way of the Golden Elixir’s return, so that one may repeatedly cultivate and refine, returning and restoring, until one again attains the complete fullness of the original root—without loss or defect. The Way of return is to return to the unity of nature and life, where yin and yang blend, and the Five Phases share breath. The method of return remains within yin and yang and the Five Phases, hence the existence of male and female, self and other, infant and maiden, golden lord and wooden mother, lady and young gentleman, yellow matchmaker and wedding rites, and so forth.

A thousand metaphors and myriad forms all serve to illuminate the harmonious union of yin and yang, the clustering of the Five Phases. Thus, Master Lü said: “To imitate the birth of male and female, one must surely open the heavenly mechanism and enact the secret of heaven’s outflow.” The Dao’s methods differ not from the worldly way of male and female bringing forth life; the difference lies in borrowing the mortal father and mother to give birth to the colored body, while borrowing the spiritual father and holy mother to give birth to the dharma body. Between the sacred and the mundane, one flows forward, the other backward, suspended between heaven and earth.

The Three Peaks say that the forward is mundane, the backward is immortal; the difference lies in the inversion that occurs in the middle. Yet though this matter is the same as the worldly way of male and female bringing forth life, it does not attach to the illusory forms of worldly men and women. The elixir texts’ yin and yang refer to the spiritual father and holy mother—that is, the true yin and true yang within our own bodies. True yin and true yang are not the postnatal yin and yang of form and substance within the body, but the formless and insubstantial yin and yang. The postnatal yin and yang of the body cannot be used, much less the external male and female yin and yang!

Worldly confused learners, not reflecting that nature and life are formless, imageless, without place or substance, heed the blind masters’ evil words and licentious talk, performing their arts only on the flesh and skin sacs of worldly men and women. Some manipulate the Three Peaks’ hunting arts; some practice nine shallow and one deep; some measure nine women as nine cauldrons and nine turns; some gather the head scripture, pressing front and back; some pluck the head scripture’s plum as the fruit of ginseng; some take fresh blood from the scripture’s end to swallow as true red lead; some engage in spiritual communion without bodily union; some breathe through curtains; some invert yin and yang by placing man beneath woman; some draw woman’s breath to depend on earth and seed heaven; some drink women’s milk as supplementation; some master young girls as sword refining.

Such varieties are countless, a hundredfold shameful, filthy and impure, lacking shame and conscience, acting like beasts. When the Dao has come to this, how can one bear to speak further?

There are yet those doubly foolish, the greatest sinners, who borrow the Patriarchs’ names to compose licentious and false books, spreading them to later generations and leading people astray. Some annotate the Chamber Elixir to explain ancient scriptures, disrupting the holy Dao—like Peng Haogu and Master Zhiji—deceiving themselves and others, causing learners to enter a cage from which they never escape. Is this not terrifying and dreadful?

Alas! The Way of nature and life is supremely pure and clean, supremely noble and precious—the true yin and true yang, two energies intermingling, condensing into form within the void, called the Sacred Embryo, also known as the son’s pregnancy. Though called pregnancy, it is not a blood-and-qi form, but a condensation of pure essence and clear yang energy. If one takes a young girl’s turbid blood and turbid qi to condense a fetus, it is not a sacred embryo ascending to heaven, but rather a ghostly fetus descending to hell. Seeking to become human but failing, how dare one hope to become immortal?

I urge those with true hearts who study the Dao: swiftly open the Chamber Elixir Gate. Sweep clean all the pathways of lust and desire. Seek out another true yin and true yang, fuse them into one, and naturally a sprout of numinous life will arise within. Then one may become immortal, may become Buddha, and grow long with Heaven and Earth. Otherwise, lust and desire commit evil, harm others and damage virtue, conscience is broken, and to vainly imagine attaining the Dao is difficult indeed.
