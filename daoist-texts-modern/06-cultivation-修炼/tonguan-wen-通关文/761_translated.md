# The Crucial Gate of the Furnace Fire

Master Xu said: “Different natures and kinds cannot easily unite; how could they settle together in one body?”  
Master Chunyu said: “Those of the same kind can readily apply their skill; but when natures differ, craft is hard to achieve.”  
Master Ziyang said: “Cease refining the Three Yellows and the Four Spirits; if you seek among countless herbs, none will be true. Yin and yang find their kind and return to mutual resonance; the two and eight correspond and naturally unite. When the sun’s red light sinks to the pool’s bottom, strange yin vanishes; on the mountain’s peak, the moon’s white glow renews the herb shoots. People today must learn to recognize true lead and mercury—not the common sand and quicksilver.”  

He further said: “Stop wasting effort on muddy elixir furnaces; to refine the medicine, seek the Crescent Moon furnace. There is a natural, genuine fire phase; no need for firewood, charcoal, or blowing and fanning.”  

Master Sanfeng said: “The Five Metals and Eight Stones are all false; myriad herbs and a thousand prescriptions are all mistaken. The Golden Toad and Jade Crow—those who recognize the true ones are genuine adepts. This all speaks of the Great Dao of the Golden Elixir, not the art of furnace fire burning and refining.”  

Now, what is called the Golden Elixir? The ‘gold’ signifies firmness and indestructibility; the ‘elixir’ signifies completeness and perfection without flaw. Firmness and perfection—thus it is named the Golden Elixir, the original primordial numinous treasure of True Unity. It is also called the primordial True Unity Qi, the ancestral breath of life, the primordial numinous root, the primal treasure pearl—altogether, the most numinous and refined qi.  

In Confucianism, this qi is called the Supreme Ultimate; in Buddhism, Perfect Enlightenment; in Daoism, the Golden Elixir. Formless and shapeless, neither color nor void. Yet though formless, it can give birth to form; though shapeless, it can produce real images; neither color, yet it can generate wondrous hues; neither void, yet it is true emptiness. Rooted in the primordial, hidden in the postnatal, it is the root of nature and life, the seed of immortals and Buddhas, the foundation of sages and worthies.  

To know and cultivate it is to transcend birth and death, to emerge beyond creation, to surpass the mundane and enter the sacred, neither born nor destroyed. But people fail to recognize this fundamental seed, so they miss it right before their eyes. If one wishes to recognize it, one must not guess recklessly or debate privately; one must seek a clear master who transmits it orally and heart-to-heart, only then can one see the truth. Moreover, the master must carefully point out the authenticity of the medicines, the correctness of the fire phases, the order of the work, and the principles of operation, so progress can be made.  

Since ancient times, the immortal scriptures have expounded subtle mysteries, describing profound wonders; their principles and methods are all complete. Like a thousand transformations and myriad changes, they conveniently name things, taking forms from objects, compiling virtues from mixed things—using the manifest to compare the unmanifest, using form to illustrate formlessness, scattering and debating, each pointing to one principle and one method. Their meaning is hidden and secret, containing heavenly secrets, difficult to express plainly. The teaching is for people to grasp the image and forget the words, to grasp the meaning and forget the image, to exhaust the limits and investigate deeply, to naturally know and awaken by themselves.  

If one exhausts without gaining, investigates without clarity, then one proves the Way exists. From broad to narrow, from doubt to insight—not by writing or speaking alone is the Way attained. Indeed, every word and phrase of the Patriarchs is the vital, wondrous function close to life and nature; the study of body and mind is true learning, not abandoning the near to seek the far, nor borrowing the dross of the world.  

But worldly confused learners seek the Way far away though it is near, seek difficulty though the matter is easy. They do not investigate its meaning, only recognize its image; do not exhaust its principle, only remember its words; guessing riddles and making guesses, each issuing their own views. They see talk of large and small Golden Elixirs and immediately suspect they are material things; they see talk of golden cauldrons and jade furnaces and suspect mere clay stoves and copper and iron utensils; they hear of lead and mercury medicines and suspect common quicksilver and black tin; they hear of yellow shoots and white snow and suspect the spiritual frost of burning and refining; they hear of literary cooking and martial refining and suspect the ordinary fire of firewood, charcoal, and blowing.  

Using the dross of metals, stones, and plants to forge and ingest, they vainly imagine connecting with the formless nature and life. Little do they know that when bamboo breaks, one must mend it with bamboo; when hatching a chicken, one must use eggs. Mundane things and our nature and life are not of one kind—how could they connect with nature and life?  

There are also a class of deluded men who borrow the Patriarchs’ Golden Elixir words to enter the mouth and transform the mortal body; or borrow the single grain of the Golden Elixir of the Way to swallow like a snake and instantly become a dragon, or a chicken eating it becomes a phoenix—famous lines—yet they proceed to cook and refine metals, stones, sand, mercury, and the Three Yellows and Four Spirits medicines, vainly imagining swallowing them to ascend and transform shape and form. They never think: polluted flesh and polluted bones—how could metal and stone medicines truly transform shape and ascend? Such folly is extreme.  

Moreover, metal and stone medicines are originally toxic; adding fire refining, the poison of medicine and fire combine in one place, increasing the poison. Taking them rots intestines and damages skin; none survive. Once, Zhang Shangshu of Nine Rivers believed in taking them; Master Lü’s transformation was uncomprehended; he inscribed a poem on the gate:  

“Pity Zhang Shangshu of Nine Rivers,  
Taking medicine lost his spirit and vigor.  
Unaware the Golden Elixir has no substance,  
Mistakenly baited by metals—how foolish!”  

In the end, he lost his sight. It is clear that metal and stone medicines cannot help, but harm. Throughout history, countless have suffered this fate.  

There is yet another class of greedy sinners who borrow the Patriarchs’ words to seek heavenly treasures, claiming that worldly wealth is necessary to buy cauldrons and prepare medicines, that without wealth it cannot be done. They go east seeking external protectors, west seeking great riches, deceiving fools, indulging in rich meat and fine wine, mixing eating and drinking. Some use methods to increase silver, some remove the blood of red copper, some burn lead to spot mercury, some burn grass to refine copper. All these are false things—how could they become true? Some even steal true things, exchange them for false, swindle people’s wealth, ruin families’ fortunes—heartless and ruthless like thieves and bandits. How can their evil and poison be spoken of?  

Once, Patriarch Zhengyang transmitted the Yellow and White methods to Master Lü to benefit people and save beings. Master Lü, fearing harm to future generations three thousand years later, did not wish to teach them. What was his intention?  

Furnace fire deluded disciples do not know that accumulating virtue but harming virtue, taking the Patriarch’s medicine but betraying the Patriarch’s conduct, grievously lose conscience. Though men may tolerate it, how could Heaven tolerate it?  

I urge those truly sincere in learning the Way to quickly open the gate of the furnace fire. Sweep away all harmful things—burning, refining, elixirs, cooking, grass methods—and carefully study body, mind, nature, and life. Seek out a Heaven-Earth cauldron, find the Black Rabbit medicine, employ the Samadhi true fire, and refine it into treasure—only then is there real benefit. Otherwise, using metals and stones as snacks, poisons as life treasures, is harmful, not helpful; vainly hoping to attain the Way is difficult indeed.  

The above fifty points are all crucial gates for learners, great demons on the yin path, which must be opened one by one for progress. If even one gate is blocked, it will stop you; no matter how mighty a hero or fierce a man who uproots mountains, you cannot advance an inch. Learners must recognize the true and trust it; though not all gates open at once, with gradual effort, the day will come when they do. If one does not recognize the true or trust it, one remains inside the gate, unable to pass beyond. To ascend the great road, unless you sprout wings and fly or ride clouds and pass through, how could you not ruin your journey?  

All learners who treat these gates lightly, seeing them as trivial, abandoning the near for the far, the easy for the difficult, keeping their own sicknesses and vainly hoping for others’ legacies; keeping their own human affairs incomplete and vainly hoping for others’ heavenly treasures—who would entrust their family legacy to a sick man? Who would entrust heavenly treasures to a rogue?  

The Way of nature and life is the greatest matter under Heaven, the greatest difficulty under Heaven; only a man of great strength and great virtue can bear it and accomplish it. If one can open all these gates, one is such a man of great strength and great virtue. If one meets a clear master’s guidance, great is the Way and great the hope; straight to the other shore, free to roam forward or backward without obstruction, step by step seeing merit—why worry about the difficulty of the Way’s accomplishment?
