# Song of Absolute Words

Once I recalled the days of utter ruin,  
One single thought of earnest sincerity sought the true master.  
Across the southern banks of Yan Capital, I wandered in vain,  
Through Shan You and Guanzhong, I raced with empty haste.  

Before my eyes, beasts of lion and camel form appeared,  
At my ears, only the fox’s parting words were heard.  
All claimed immortals were easy to meet,  
But who knew the true dao was hardest to grasp?  

When misfortune reaches its peak, fortune returns—divine beings spoke,  
Pointing beyond the Golden City to seek the Great Dao.  
The old sage of the shrine and valley was no ordinary man,  
His words and speech were profound and mysterious.  

Leaning close, he revealed the secret of the primal yin gate,  
At that moment, yin and yang could overturn and invert.  
Great mechanism and vast function are fundamentally natural,  
Unlike the contrivances of the six external forces.  

At parting, he entrusted me to guard it carefully,  
“First exhaust human affairs, then deliberate further.”  
Only because the seat of parting came too soon,  
Later matters remained unclear, my heart filled with anxious doubt.  

For thirteen years I bore this tangled knot,  
On the Han’s heights, I was fortunate to receive immortal light.  
I dug out the root of Heaven and marrow of Earth,  
Pointing out the black liver and the rabbit’s intestine.  

The timing of the fire’s tempering, he spoke with careful detail,  
The sequence of the work, before and after, clearly explained.  
Cultivate nature, cultivate destiny, strive with care,  
Observe the orifices, observe the marvels, attend to the proper season.  

When the Four Symbols harmonize, the elixir begins to return,  
The Five Phases blend as one, the embryo is formed.  
When yin is exhausted and yang is pure, the circle is complete,  
Breaking through empty space, there is no birth nor death.  

Within my ears, I heard this true explication,  
Suddenly all was clear, penetrating the wondrous mystery.  
From start to finish, the order was fully understood,  
From then on, I recognized the heavens beyond Heaven.  

Before me lay rare flowers and precious herbs,  
Within my body, pure white snow and yellow sprouts.  
Left and right, all were pearls and jewels,  
Front and back, all were golden lotuses.  

How can one seek this heavenly secret?  
To seek it, one must set the will early.  
First cast away all worldly affairs,  
Next sweep away all attachments and ties.  

Humbly bowing low, seek the wise and enlightened,  
Delve deeply to probe the subtle principles with the mind.  
After bitter exhaustion, sweetness naturally arises,  
With steadfast resolve, at last the true treasure is gained.  

Awakened to the primordial, I have long made vows,  
Harboring great impartiality with a selfless heart.  
Only wishing that all may ascend to the sacred realm,  
Always rejoicing that each one hears the sound of the dao.  

The crooked paths and false ways confuse the true way,  
Copper points and mercury gold fill the genuine gold.  
Many learners fall into the net of the tangled heavens,  
Many aspirants enter the dark pine forest.  

Where can these grievances be told?  
At the last moment, regret is too late, tears wasted in vain.  
Broadly speaking, the principles are not thoroughly exhausted,  
Because of hanging illusions with no fixed grasp.  

Who knows the sacred dao has true transmission?  
Who understands that creation cannot be easily stolen?  
If not for great practice and great merit,  
Penglai would be but an inch away, yet the heart restless and empty.  

How laughable are the confused folk of the world,  
Foolishly seeking the heavenly thoroughfare but falling into dust.  
Blind leading blind harms yin virtue,  
Mistakes upon mistakes lead into the bewildering ford.  

Now I cannot bear to see the Great Dao fall,  
Therefore I carefully lay out the ancestral lineage.  
Not to seek fame nor fish for praise,  
Nor to chatter idly and stir the lips in vain.  

Contemplation and insight directly break through metaphor,  
The Book of Changes unfolds the true sequence of fire’s timing.  
Before and after, distinguish difficulty and right and wrong,  
Dao and virtue gather meaning and set the rules.  

Original intent and function are all clearly spoken,  
The medicines of understanding all carefully recounted.  
A compass points to awakening, unfolding subtle essence,  
Breaking doubt, passing through the gate, binding the companions of the dao.  

The words grow ever simpler, the principle ever clearer,  
The chapters are few, the merit exceedingly refined.  
With careful humility, the low may reach the high,  
With cautious subtlety, the void may become full.  

If one still abandons the near for the distant,  
Surely great error will be sought and the path lost.  
Better to first cure the illness of the self,  
Do not leap ranks imagining long life.  

Having spoken thus, no meaning remains,  
The rules of cultivation leave no space unfilled.  
Thousands of words and myriad phrases all unfold the truth,  
Each line, each phrase, carries profound meaning.  

Not like the outer husks of empty appearances,  
All are secrets to becoming immortal and attaining the dao.  
Though in this world few know such friends,  
I leave it to later sages to carefully ponder and discuss.  

Now I am old and impatient,  
My heart fulfilled, I desire to cease speech.  
Seal the gates, close the door, destroy foolish thoughts,  
Lay aside ornamentation, return to the root and origin.  

No longer watch the dust of the world with my eyes,  
In my heart forever hangs the banner of primordial chaos.  
Like a fool, like a simpleton without knowledge,  
Yin and yang, creation and transformation, all lifted by one hand.
