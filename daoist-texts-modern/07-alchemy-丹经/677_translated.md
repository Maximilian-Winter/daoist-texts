# The Sublime Nine-True Precepts

The Nine-True Precepts, the moral code of Daoism, also called the “Sublime Nine-True Precepts,” are vows that both the living and the departed may uphold. These were spoken by the Primordial Heavenly Worthy himself. Those who wear them ascend into the Nine Heavens; those who slight them fall into the Nine Earths. Throughout the Tang, Song, Yuan, and Ming dynasties, the Sublime Nine-True Precepts served as the standard precepts granted in talismanic ordinations. After taking refuge in the Three Treasures—the Dao Treasure, the Scripture Treasure, and the Master Treasure—one receives the Nine-True Precepts as the guiding code.

In Scroll Thirty-Four of the *Supreme Clarity Numinous Treasure Great Salvation Golden Scripture*, titled “The Gate of Literary Inspection and Completion,” there is a talismanic document of the Nine-True Precepts. The text inscribes the precept rules and calls the Nine-True Precepts “the gateway to ascend to truth, the ferry to rescue the dying.”

The *Primordial Talismanic Decree for Salvation from Suffering* states: “These Sublime Nine-True Precepts, their merit in salvation, lead upward to Heaven, just as the decree commands.”

In Volume Twenty of the *Compendium of Daoist Methods*, it is said: “The Nine-True Precepts proclaim to the departed spirits: uphold the precepts with single-minded devotion, and you shall reach the wondrous Dao.”

The *Purple Sovereign Refining Salvation Profound Scripture* declares: “Among the scriptures of the Three Caverns and the secret classics of the Four Divisions, teachings on precepts vary in many ways. Yet none surpass the supreme Numinous Treasure Sublime Nine-True Precepts, revered by Heaven and humans alike, honored in the hidden and the manifest. Supreme beyond the supreme, profound beyond the profound, the spirit of myriad gods, the treasure of the One Qi, wondrously threading through the Three Powers, restraining the six passions by precept, numbered and fixed in the yang, thus divided into nine. Cultivated without falsehood, hence named True. All the world reveres it as a fortress; hidden and manifest rely on it as ladder and ferry; souls and spirits receive it as the medicine of the law.”

The *Most High Profound Primordial Three Heavens Jade Hall Great Method* states: “If the world’s people can receive the Sublime Nine-True Precepts, wear and uphold the precious talisman for salvation from suffering and long life, on the day of their birth they receive great blessings; their lifespan extends far and wide, and when their fate is fulfilled, they do not enter the cycle of rebirth but ascend straight to the Elixir Heaven.”

At that time, the Primordial Heavenly Worthy sat upon the Jade Throne of the Three Energies’ Radiant Treasure Cloud in the Palace of the Three Primes within the Nine Pure Marvelous Realms. Beneath the soaring forest, he was surrounded by the great sages, the Most High Dao Lords, the Most High Old Lords, the Nine Sovereign True Ones, the Flying Celestial Sages, the Marvelous Conducted Perfected Ones, the Four Directors and Five Emperors, the celestial dragons, spirits, and ghosts—countless beyond measure—all gathered together on the priceless platform of the kalpa. Beings from the Ten Directions arrived mounted on five-colored jade wheels, eight scenic palanquins, mysterious spirit emerald staffs, flying clouds and white canopies, qilin-drawn feathered chariots, dragon banners and phoenix standards, lions and white cranes, their howls and songs resonating with grandeur. Incense burned and flowers scattered, they traversed the empty sky with flying steps, reciting the cavernous chapters, paying homage to the Heavenly Worthy, overseeing the talismanic registers, delivering salvation from suffering.

At that moment, the Three Primes’ Upper Palace shone with radiant light, illuminating the vast emptiness, the spiritual capital of Purple Tenuity gleaming and reflecting throughout the Ten Directions, reaching down to the boundless realm. Even in the long night of the Nine Netherworld Hells, the roots of fate—good and evil—shone brilliantly in the light. All the mysterious offices were illuminated; every heavenly palace was visible.

The Primordial Heavenly Worthy and the assembly spread the supreme marvels, enlightening humans and heavens, marking good deeds, inscribing the Yellow Register, the Golden Frame, and the Jade Tablet, displaying the Three Pure Ones, visible in every hell.

The Ten Directions’ Salvific Worthy entered the Nine Netherworlds to rescue the suffering, commanding the Northern Emperor, the Three Officials, the Nine Offices, the one hundred and twenty divisions, the Five Emperors’ examiners, the fate-inspecting youths, the officers of life and death, the officers of merit and punishment, the Earth Sovereign’s nine fortresses, the Four Bright Lords and their guests and attendants, the Five Mountains’ clerks, the enforcers of divine punishment, the mighty heavenly warriors, the heavenly armored troops, the Ox-Head jailers, the mighty sword-bearing kings, the great demons of the Three Realms, and the nine hundred million ghost kings—all gathered within the Nine Netherworld Hells, jointly receiving the teaching and precepts.

At that time, the Northern Emperor of Fengdu and the ghost officials were all shaken and fearful, each thinking: “We have accumulated sins and serve as ghost officials, governing the underworld, dwelling always in darkness, enduring countless kalpas without seeing light. Why today do we suddenly feel the supreme saint’s majestic radiance shining brightly, illuminating the heavy gloom? Is there some inquiry? We hesitate and dare not believe.”

At that moment, sweeping through the prison, there were many sinners whose names were entered in the black ledger. The Ox-Head jailers drove them onto the Mountain of Knives; their bodies and heads were rotten and broken, their five limbs scattered. Among them alone was one person who climbed the mountain and descended, pursued the trees high and low, trod on blades and pierced spears without a single wound. All the swords and halberds transformed into lotus flowers.

The Northern Emperor was greatly astonished and fearful, bowed his head in reverence, and said to the Heavenly Worthy: “Your disciple, through past misfortune, serves as an underworld official, residing in Fengdu for countless eons. I have often seen sinners suffer torment; I have also seen the Eastern Wind and Thunder prison, where black winds and shaking thunder crash, flying halberds and floating spears strike sinners, tearing apart limbs and piercing the five viscera, suffering for countless kalpas without respite day or night. I have seen the Southern Fire prison, where sinners swallow fire and eat charcoal, burned by flames, their heads and faces scorched, wearing fire mountains on their heads, skin and flesh aflame, suffering for countless kalpas without respite day or night. I have seen the Western Vajra prison, where sinners are tortured with golden hammers and iron rods, limbs rotten, sinews and bones scattered, iron forks piercing the belly, golden hammers pressing the heart, suffering for countless kalpas without respite day or night. I have seen the Northern Nether Cold prison, where sinners sink into the cold hill pool, pierced by ice halberds and frost blades, breaking sinews and bones, drenched in venomous juices, limbs scattered, hearts and bellies destroyed, suffering for countless kalpas without respite day or night. I have seen the Central Sweeping prison, where sinners are scourged and tortured, pain unbearable, sinews severed, blood flowing, fainting and thrown to the ground. There the jailers use iron forks to stab, forcing sinners to circle the Mountain of Knives and Sword Trees; the eight winds blow, bending and raising the trees; feet tread the knife mountain, bodies hang on sword edges, suffering for countless kalpas without respite day or night. I have seen the Southeast Copper Pillar prison, where sinners have copper pillars on their bodies, fierce flames blazing, forcing sinners to climb holding their feet and hands; inside and out they are scorched and rotten, their bellies and backs festering, suffering for countless kalpas without respite day or night. I have seen the Southwest Butchering prison, where sinners hang upside down, cut by knives and swords; limbs, sinews, skin, and five viscera are all sliced by blades; sinners’ blood flows full on the ground, unbearable to endure, suffering for countless kalpas without respite day or night. I have seen the Northwest Fire Cart prison, where sinners are torn apart by five carts, limbs scattered; or bodies placed on fire carts, wheels turning east, west, south, and north, each wheel lined with blades cutting sinners, compounded by fierce fire burning and scorching, suffering for countless kalpas without respite day or night. I have seen the Northeast Cauldron Soup prison, where sinners are pierced by iron forks and plunged into boiling cauldrons; their five bodies dissolve, limbs rot, pus and blood stink unbearably, suffering for countless kalpas without respite day or night.”

“Yet I do not understand by what cause this one sinner walks the Mountain of Knives and Sword Trees without harm; the blades and halberds turn into lotus flowers; his features are dignified and serene; he walks alone without fear; no suffering can harm him. Suddenly the supreme saint returns his chariot; heavenly spirits descend and gather; all tremble in awe, none can comprehend.”

“I only wish the Heavenly Worthy, great compassion and great mercy, would universally save and deliver all those suffering in the Nine Netherworlds, remove all sins, recognize their past fate, abandon evil and follow good, escape the Nine Netherworlds, dwell in light, revolve in blessings, gain liberation, and forever leave the Three Paths.”

At that time, the beings of the Nine Netherworld Hells, hearing the Northern Emperor’s broad appeal, felt repentance arise in their hearts and wished to seek removal of sins. They raised their voices in sorrowful cries, echoing through Brahma’s heavens.

Then the Salvific Worthy of the Ten Directions, with great compassion and observant heart, universally extended his power, delivering beings with majestic radiance. Borrowing the wisdom of the Six Spiritual Penetrations, he made all sinners close their eyes and meditate quietly.

In a moment, they recognized their past fate, each clearly realizing the evil deeds committed in their lifetime. Some had killed sovereigns and fathers, been unfilial to parents; some slandered the Great Dao, forsaking truth for falsehood; some harmed brothers, plotted rebellion against masters; some committed incest with kin, violated flesh and bone; some were robbers and thieves, killing human lives; some butchered living beings, sparing only themselves; some oppressed the weak by force, the noble abused the humble; some falsely praised the Three Treasures, their hearts not devoted; some slighted the dharma masters, defiling sacred texts; some harbored secret thieves, endured jealousy and hatred; some spoke evil words, sowed discord among the good; some killed, lusted, and violated the Four Seasonal Offerings, exposed the Three Luminaries; some in heart, some in speech, some by their own deeds, some by teaching others—all accumulated sins from countless kalpas were suddenly recalled and fully realized, doubling their sorrow and anguish, and they wished for liberation.

The Heavenly Worthy universally proclaimed to the four groups: “Listen carefully. These sinners, from countless kalpas past, disbelieved scriptures and teachings, only committing crimes, evil upon evil, their offenses full and certain, thus their names entered the evil ledger, their bodies fallen into the Nine Netherworlds, trapped in the Three Paths, not yet released. Yet among them is this one person who, in life, once held the great Nine Netherworld Grand Fasting, upheld the Golden Register and White Tablet of the Nine-True Sublime Precepts, marked with the Golden Frame, listed in the Jade Purity. His virtue was weighty, his merit high, resonating with the upper realms. By my divine power I have protected him with my thoughts. Now I shall universally proclaim the prohibitions and precepts, sever all evil roots, so that you all may be liberated at once.”

At that moment, the Northern Emperor heard these words and was greatly joyful, unable to contain his excitement. Gazing upon the honored face, he composed a hymn:

> “Excellent indeed, Primordial Worthy,  
> Compassionate parent of all beings.  
> Your light inclines the Purple Tenuity Palace,  
> Curving to reflect the gates of the Nine Netherworlds.  
> Lofty is the cold hill courtyard,  
> Circling to illuminate the vast icy shore.  
> Blazing are the fierce flames,  
> Showering the Dharma rain.  
> Perfectly penetrating great compassion and wisdom,  
> Always skillful in saving all suffering.  
> Delivering souls through the long night,  
> Now we bow and pay homage.”

After the Northern Emperor recited this hymn, the celestial assembly all voiced assent, the heavenly music of the Sovereign Heaven interweaving myriad sounds, banners and canopies, incense and flowers shading all beneath.

Then the Primordial Heavenly Worthy again addressed the four groups: “Listen carefully, keep quiet in your hearts. I shall now reveal to you the Sublime Nine-True Precepts, the Golden Register and White Tablet. The merit of receiving and upholding them rescues from difficulty and suffering; their divine power is beyond thought. All spirits bow and humbly receive the teaching and command.”

The Worthy said:

> “First, be diligent and loyal to your sovereign;  
> Second, show respect and humility, and honor your parents;  
> Third, do not kill, but compassionately save all beings;  
> Fourth, do not indulge in lust, but maintain proper conduct;  
> Fifth, do not steal, but uphold righteousness even at personal loss;  
> Sixth, do not harbor anger, nor let fury oppress others;  
> Seventh, do not deceive, for lies and theft harm the good;  
> Eighth, do not be arrogant, lest pride obscure the truth;  
> Ninth, do not be divided, but serve the Dao with single-hearted devotion.”

The Primordial Talismanic Decree, Golden Register, and White Tablet for Salvation from Suffering proclaim to the Ten Directions’ Boundless Worlds, the Three Officials and Nine Offices, the one hundred and twenty divisions, the Five Emperors’ examiners, the Nine Netherworld Hells, the mighty heavenly warriors, the commanding divine soldiers, the officers of fate and life, the officers of merit and punishment, the Ox-Head jailers, and the great demons of the Three Realms: “Deliver the departed soul of so-and-so from hell, forever ending the long night, beholding the light, all sins wiped away, grievances and enmities resolved. By this Sublime Nine-True Precepts’ merit of deliverance, ascend to Heaven, as decreed, swiftly transmitted by wind and fire.”

On the first day of the first month of the year of the Grand Duke, the fasting altar issued this decree.

The Primordial Talismanic Decree, Golden Register, White Tablet, and Long-Life Spirit Talisman proclaim to the Southern Cinnabar Heaven World, the Vermilion Mound Fire Mansion, the Southern Prosperity Upper Palace Long-Life Great Lord, Lord Han Sima, officers of life and fate, the venerable gods who extend life and calculate fate, the great gods who revive the dead and supervise life: “Deliver the departed soul of so-and-so to ascend to the Vermilion Palace’s Flowing Fire Court, refine the jade eyes and temper the essence, wipe away the yellow blossoms and dissolve the form, inscribe the name in the Purple Register, receive transformation and rebirth. By this Golden Register’s merit of deliverance, ascend moment by moment, as decreed, swiftly transmitted by wind and fire.”

On the first day of the first month of the year of the Grand Duke, the fasting altar issued this decree.

If you can receive and uphold the Golden Register and White Tablet of the Sublime Nine-True Precepts, the Long-Life Spirit Talisman, and the Salvation from Suffering True Talisman, you will dispel the great sins of the Nine Netherworlds, inscribe your name in the Nine Palaces, guarded by the fate-inspecting youths and the awe-inspiring protective deities, with the direct talisman of the Five Emperors and the clerks of the Six Palaces. They will follow the text of the register, shield and protect the disciple who receives the precepts.

The Worthy further said: “If a land suffers endless war and disaster, epidemics and poisons spread, the sovereign, consorts, crown prince, nobles, and all the common people should establish a great Nine Netherworld Grand Fasting, each receiving and upholding the Sublime Nine-True Precepts Golden Register and precious talisman. The war and disaster will cease; demons and evils will be blocked; Heaven and humans will rejoice; the country will be peaceful.”

“If you dwell in mountains, forests, or wilderness, pursued by tigers, wolves, and fierce beasts, you should calm your mind and keep in thought the Golden Register and Spirit Talisman, the fate-inspecting youths, the precept-receiving masters, and the protective divine kings. The fierce beasts will retreat and never harm you.”

“If you enter the great sea and encounter fierce winds, you should also keep these in mind; the winds and waves will calm, and you will reach the shore safely.”

“If you stand in the midst of battle and white blades, you should keep these in mind; weapons will hide and not harm you.”

“If you are imprisoned in chains and shackles, you should keep these in mind; injustice will be redressed, and you will surely be freed.”

“If you are tormented by evil spirits, ghosts, and thieves, you should keep these in mind; the ghosts and demons will vanish, and you will naturally be healed.”

“If a person’s life is about to end and they must enter the Nine Netherworlds, their name entered in the black ledger, their spouses, men and women, disciples and classmates should establish a great Nine Netherworld Grand Fasting for the deceased, inscribe their name on the White Tablet, receive the Sublime Nine-True Precepts, and burn away the black ledger. Those sinners will be liberated at once; their souls will ascend to the Nine Heavens; through the cycle of causes and conditions, they will become True Persons of the Nine Palaces.”

The Worthy further said: “The Golden Register, Sublime Precepts, and Long-Life Spirit Talisman are awe-inspiring and severely prohibitive. If one can cultivate according to the method, their blessings are boundless. But if someone arises with a heart to slander or harbor disdain, know that this person has accumulated evil for countless kalpas, their sins are deep and heavy, their name entered in the evil ledger, their body fallen to ghost officials. After death, they will surely fall into the Nine Netherworld Hells, enduring all torment, the endless long night, with no liberation.”

“If someone initially believes and receives but later harbors arrogance, the fate-inspecting youths will report to the Three Officials, who will delete their Golden Tablet, inscribe their name in the death register. Or in their present life they will suffer grave illness, worms, sores, and ulcers, abandoned and cast aside by people, unable to live or die, tormented by worry and anguish, with no way to escape. Or they will long endure violent harm, violate royal laws, encounter weapons and soldiers, face tigers and wolves, suffer water and fire, endure evil words, curses, and slanders, experience disharmony in their household, disputes among clans, and enemies dragging them down. Once the true Dao is lost, they will long fall into evil destinies.”

“Therefore, you must follow the rules and uphold them without strange thoughts. Proclaim this to men and women, so all may hear and know.”

At that time, the Northern Emperor and the four groups of sinners in the Nine Netherworlds, upon hearing these words, opened their minds and understood, each generating good thoughts. Their suffering was dispelled; body and mind were at peace; all aroused the intention for the Dao, their nature unchanging.

At that time, the black ledgers of the Nine Netherworlds were all burned to ashes; the fire mountains ceased flaming; the ice pools stilled their waves; the swallowing fire and eating charcoal transformed into sweet dew; the golden hammers and iron rods turned into lotus flowers.

They stepped lightly in the void and composed this hymn:

> “Bowing to the Most High Dao,  
> Returning our hearts to the Primordial Worthy.  
> The Supreme True Marvelous Lord,  
> Opens the gate to the Flying Mystery.  
> The wondrous precepts delight the five spirits,  
> The golden script warns myriad gods.  
> Inspecting fate, fixing the register,  
> The spirit talisman delivers suffering souls.  
> Riding clouds to pay homage to the Jade Emperor,  
> In full accord with the Mysteries within.”
