## Preface to the Commentary on the Tablet of One Hundred Characters

Pure Yang Patriarch Lü stands as the foremost compassionate sage within the gates of the dao. From the Tang dynasty until now, spanning more than a thousand years, he has appeared and vanished, his presence inscrutable—sometimes hidden, sometimes revealed. To awaken the foolish and transform the worthy, countless poems, songs, and verses have flowed through the world, too many to enumerate. 

Among these, none so thoroughly detail the order of cultivating truth, nor the alchemical substances and their timing, as the *Song of Striking the Trigrams* and the *Tablet of One Hundred Characters*. Yet, for clarity and simplicity that swiftly unlocks the mind’s barriers, none surpass the *Tablet of One Hundred Characters*. Its script contains but one hundred characters, its lines only twenty; within it, the methods of the Golden Elixir—both active and passive—are fully expounded, life and nature comprehended from beginning to end. It is called the Heavenly Ladder, truly the Ladder to Heaven.

Yet, though it is a ladder to Heaven, many among those who cultivate the truth of the world do not regard it as such. They chase after the strange and the marvelous, discarding this text because it holds no oddities or wonders. Little do they know that the dao of the Golden Elixir, the path of true constancy, harbors the greatest marvels precisely within the unremarkable, and the grandest differences precisely within the unchanging. It is only that the people of the time have not pondered deeply enough.

This text begins simply with nurturing qi, lowering the mind, and abiding in nature—what wonder is there in that? Yet its practice yields results: it can form the Elixir, it can master the Elixir, it can grant carefree freedom, it can penetrate the workings of creation—are these not the greatest marvels and profound differences? Ah! Not strange yet strange, not different yet different. Those who study the Patriarch’s teachings with deep inquiry and steady progress find none who do not advance profoundly and gain insight.

I, upon reading this text, have often been benefited. Thus, lamenting that such a Heavenly Ladder goes unrecognized, grievously failing the Patriarch’s compassionate endeavor to save the world, I here offer a few words of commentary beneath each line to elucidate its subtlety. May I find kindred spirits to ascend this Heavenly Ladder together, and so repay the Patriarch’s grace.

In the third year of the Jiaqing reign, in the cyclical year of the Earth Horse, on the third day of the third month, the simple and unadorned hermit humbly composed this preface within the Nest of Freedom.
