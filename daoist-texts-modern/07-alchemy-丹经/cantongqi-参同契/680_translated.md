Who can know such carefree wandering?  
Sit and listen to the stringless melody;  
Clearly understand the workings of creation.  
All come together in these twenty lines—  
Truly the ladder to ascend to Heaven.

### Nourish the Qi, Forget Words, and Guard

The way of nature and life begins and ends with cultivating the primordial, empty, and true One qi—nothing else. Those who gather herbs gather this; those who refine medicines refine this; those who return the elixir return this; those who transcend the elixir transcend this; those who ingest the elixir ingest this; those who form the embryo form this; those who shed the embryo shed this. To extend life by technique is this; to perfect the Dao is this. At the start, there is doing; doing is this. At the end, there is non-doing; non-doing is this. Long life is this; no birth and no cessation is this. The ancient scriptures say: “Know the One, and all affairs are complete.” This phrase alone can illuminate a thousand scriptures and ten thousand scrolls. Yet this qi is neither form nor void, without shape or image; it cannot be grasped by knowing, nor recognized by recognition. Seen, it is invisible; heard, it is inaudible; grasped, it cannot be caught. It is vague and elusive, deep and dark, beyond description. To force a likeness is all there is; to force a name, Confucians call it the Supreme Ultimate, Daoists the Golden Elixir, Buddhists Perfect Enlightenment. Fundamentally, it is beyond words—what is there to guard? If it could be spoken or guarded, it would not be the primordial, empty qi but the postnatal breath qi. The primordial qi endures through myriad kalpas; the postnatal qi fluctuates with the illusory body’s presence and absence. Those in the world without true transmission do not know what primordial qi is, mistaking the postnatal tangible qi, saying it dwells in the sea of qi, or in the elixir field, or in the Yellow Court, or in the Ren and Du meridians, or between the kidneys. Some close the mouth to regulate breath and harmonize qi; others hold the breath to stabilize the embryonic breath and conceal qi; some move it upward and downward in the Yellow Court to gather qi; some guard, some move—various methods all aiming to falsely imagine forming an elixir. But ask: where will this tangible qi ultimately condense? What shape will it take? Must it condense into a qi mass? Often those who guard above suffer brain leakage; those who guard below suffer leakage at the base; those who guard the center swell; those who guard the bright hall lose sight; those who guard the stubborn heart fall mad. Seeking long life, they hasten death—alas! Little do they know the primordial empty qi embraces Heaven and Earth, births all things; vast without outside, minute without inside. Spread it, and it fills the six directions; roll it up, and it retreats into secrecy. It can only be known, not spoken; only nourished, not guarded. No words, no guarding—forget both words and guarding; nourish without nourishing, entering the samadhi of nourishing qi. The Great Dao is lively and vibrant, never falling into the boundary of existence and nonexistence. To fall into existence is to cling to form; to fall into nonexistence is to cling to emptiness. Clinging to form or emptiness is neither the way of Heaven and Earth’s creation and transformation, nor the way of the sages’ true emptiness and wondrous existence. To say nourish qi is to have something nourished, not clinging to emptiness; to say forget words and guard is to have no fixed place, no set position, not clinging to form. Not clinging to emptiness, not clinging to form, there must be a nourishment that is neither empty nor form. Nourishment that is neither empty nor form is silent and unmoving, yet responsive and thus communicating; responsive and thus communicating, yet silent and unmoving—this is the way of nourishing qi.

### Lower the Heart, Become Non-Action

Above, it was said to nourish qi without words or guarding, seeming to do nothing at all. After birth, when the primordial qi is abundant, yang reaches its peak and yin must follow; only then can the primordial qi be preserved unlost—this is the realm of the highest virtue sages. For those of middle and lower virtue, once the postnatal arises, the primordial qi hides, and the postnatal qi takes charge. Yang gradually wanes, yin gradually grows. Through kalpas, dust and root arise; the whole body’s qi and constitution move; the conscious spirit grows wild; invading demons rebel. At this time, the four great elements in the body all belong to yin; one does not know what is the yang essence. Though one wishes to nourish qi, there is nowhere to nourish it, nor can one find the nourishment. The Patriarch Huang He wrote: “The highest virtue perfects the form by the Dao, preserving the pure yang unbroken; the lower virtue extends life by technique, pairing Kan and Li to complete.” Perfecting the form by the Dao is non-action; extending life by technique is action. The highest virtue person, with primordial qi intact, a pure yang body, guards the center and embraces the One, thus perfecting the original true form. The middle and lower person, with primordial qi damaged, yang sunk into yin, must steal yin and yang, seize creation; first secure the foundation of life, entering non-action through action to achieve truth. The ancient immortals say: “Returning the elixir is easiest; refining oneself is hardest.” The Spring of Purity says: “Seven returns to the elixir; before the person, one must refine oneself and await the time.” The work of refining oneself begins with lowering the heart, but lowering the heart requires knowing the heart. The heart has human heart and Dao heart; true heart and false heart. The Dao heart is originally unknowing, following the emperor’s law—this is the true heart. The human heart arises later, knowing and feeling the seven emotions and six desires—this is the false heart. The true heart benefits nature and life; the false heart harms nature and life. Lowering the heart means lowering the false human heart. Yet lowering the human heart is not emptying or forcing the heart; it must follow nature. Wu Zhen said: “Follow its desires, guide gradually.” These two phrases are the secret to lowering the heart. Thus it is said: lower the heart, become non-action. To say “action” is that the heart must lower; to say “non-action” is not forcing the lowering. Lower yet not lowering, not lowering yet lowering—use within non-use, exert power within no-power, thus applying effort. The stubborn heart is habit hardened like iron forged by fire, hardest and firmest, unbreakable. If bound too tightly, using heart to control heart, the more heart, the harder the block, causing heart sickness. The Yin Consonant Scripture says: “Fire born of wood, disaster surely strikes”—thus. Therefore, lowering the heart must use gradual cultivation, only then can it help; gradual cultivation harms not the other, benefits the self, acting yet not acting.

### In Movement and Stillness, Know the Ancestral Source; When There Is No Matter, Whom Else to Seek?

The primordial true One qi is the ancestral qi born of Heaven, Earth, and Man; it contains all principles and is always present. This is the ancestral root of nature and life. Those who preserve it are sages; those who lose it are ordinary. Yet when this qi falls into the postnatal, it hides and does not appear. Even if it appears, humans are dragged by fame and profit, disturbed by selfish desires, missing it face to face, gaining and losing it in turn. To seek this qi, one must first recognize the Dao heart. The primordial qi is hidden in the Dao heart. The Dao heart is the essence; the primordial qi is its function. They share the same source but different names. The Dao heart is the ancestral root of cultivation. The Dao heart is the master; the human heart is the servant. Recognize the Dao heart as the ancestral root; as master commanding servant, the servant obeys without coercion. Every movement and stillness is the Dao heart’s operation; even the human heart transforms into Dao heart. Inside, no false thoughts; outside, no false affairs. Inside and outside are peaceful; foreign qi cannot enter; one dwells in a realm of no matter. To reach no matter, empty and hollow, only the Dao heart remains—what else to seek?

### True Constancy Must Respond to Things; Responding to Things Requires Not Being Lost

Knowing the ancestral root and dwelling in no matter, the true can be constant. The true is constant; all external falsities cannot harm it. But the way of true constancy is not to avoid the world or withdraw from society; nor is it to sit in stillness and stop thoughts. One must tread firmly, act bodily, and be forged in the great furnace of creation. Only then is one true, only then constant. If one knows truth but not how to act truthfully, though appearing without matter, one is like wood carving or clay sculpture—externally still, but internally troubled. The so-called Chan device is originally still; stillness breeds demons. This is like closing the door to catch thieves—false cannot be removed, true is inevitably harmed. How can true constancy be? Therefore: true constancy must respond to things; responding to things requires not being lost. True constancy responding to things means using truth to meet false; responding to things without being lost means using false to cultivate truth. Truth is hidden within false; false is not outside truth. Without false, truth cannot be realized; without truth, false cannot be transformed. Only in constant response and constant stillness, stealing life from death’s trap, steadying the helm amid waves. If one can avoid being lost, that is true constancy. If one can be truly constant, though responding all day, it is as if not responding; dwelling in no matter, unmoved by myriad things—what hinders responding?

### Not Being Lost, Nature Abides by Itself

Responding without being lost means the Dao heart’s true constancy remains. The Dao heart’s true constancy remains, the human heart’s false does not arise. The human heart’s false not arising, the qi and constitution’s nature does not erupt. The nature does not erupt, the innate nature shines bright, like a crystal tower—unstained, unattached, unmoving, unshaken, abiding by itself. In sum, the effect of nature abiding depends entirely on the skill of responding without being lost. Lost, the human heart acts; true nature hides, false nature arises. Not lost, the Dao heart acts; false nature transforms, true nature appears. The way of abiding nature is to not lose it completely. The Patriarch Huang He wrote: “Following worldly law to cultivate transcendence law”—what a profound saying!

### Nature Abiding, Qi Naturally Returns

Nature is principle; in Heaven, it is principle. Given to humans, it is called nature. Qi is life force; in Heaven, it is qi. Given to humans, it is called life. At life’s beginning, principle does not separate from qi; qi does not separate from principle; life does not separate from nature; nature does not separate from life. Principle and qi are one family; nature and life one affair. After entering the postnatal, principle and qi disconnect; nature and life separate. If one can have nature abide, not moved by foreign qi, then correct qi naturally returns. Without life yet still having life, nature and life remain one affair; principle and qi never oppose. This is called “exhausting nature and reaching life.” Generally, the key to qi’s return lies in nature abiding. If nature abides, qi naturally returns; no need to force.

### Qi Returns, the Elixir Naturally Forms

The elixir is a perfectly bright thing, formed by the union of yin and yang qi. When nature abides, all worries cease—this is called true stillness and true emptiness. Extreme stillness births movement; extreme emptiness births brightness. The primordial qi comes from emptiness; in a moment, it condenses into the elixir—called the elixir formed within one double-hour. Generally, the key to returning the elixir lies in qi’s return; the key to qi’s return lies in nature abiding; the key to nature abiding lies in not being lost; the key to not being lost lies in lowering the heart; the key to lowering the heart lies in knowing the ancestral root. Knowing the ancestral root, lowering the heart, responding to things without being lost, nature abides, qi returns, elixir forms—these three “self” characters arise from responding without being lost. Responding without being lost is the work of refining oneself; the so-called refining oneself thoroughly, the elixir forms naturally.

The Song of Understanding the Dao says:  
“Before refining the elixir, first refine nature;  
Before cultivating the great medicine, first cultivate the heart.  
Nature settled, elixir surely arrives;  
Heart quiet, then the medicine sprouts.”  

Especially, returning the elixir is easiest; refining oneself is hardest. If refining oneself does not reach the state of no-self, nature unsettled, heart unquiet—how can the elixir return? Yet if refining oneself does not know the ancestral root, the work is futile. The Master Sanfeng said: “When laying the foundation, one must use the key; when refining oneself, one must also have true lead.” True lead is the ancestral root. Without meeting a true master to break the true lead, who dares to begin the great medicine?

### Within the Cauldron, Pair Kan and Li

Qi returns, elixir forms, the true seed is in hand—this is called returning the elixir, also called the small return elixir. This elixir is still unrefined by true water and fire, still raw, immature, unfit to swallow to save life. It must be tempered into a supreme yang thing to extend years and increase longevity. Kan is yin outside and yang inside; its inner yang is true, the central and correct yang—not the turbid essence of the illusory body’s kidneys, but the primordial true One’s divine water. Li is yang outside and yin inside; its inner yin is true, the central and correct yin—not the blood of the illusory body’s heart, but the primordial empty spiritual true fire. This water and fire are the natural water and fire of the void, not the water and fire of all forms and images. Using this water and fire to cook the numinous medicine, through the twelve double-hours without interruption, neither forgetting nor hastening, continuous as if present, using without weariness. The Medicine Mirror says: “Water fears dryness; fire fears cold.” To say “within the cauldron pairing” means natural water and fire, not seeking outside; the divine brightness moves silently, the medicine’s ripeness and youth, the fire’s timing advancing and retreating, adjusting with the moment, subtle and secret, not allowing the slightest leak.

### Yin and Yang Give Birth, Return, and Overturn; Universal Transformation Is But a Single Thunderclap

The work of cooking with water and fire is the work of morning gathering and evening concealing. Morning gathering is advancing the yang fire; evening concealing is moving the yin talisman. When yang, advance yang; when yin, move yin. Yin then yang, yang then yin—yin and yang clash and gather, spontaneously giving birth to return and overturn. Return and overturn meet in the haze, change in the dark; returning and covering, yin and yang mix and transform. The primordial spiritual seed, from tender to firm, self-born to mature, gradually then suddenly, suddenly bursts forth a supreme yang elixir in the furnace of creation, like a sudden thunderclap in the sky, awakening the dreamer.

### White Clouds Greet the Summit at Dawn; Sweet Dew Sprinkles Mount Sumeru

When the yang elixir emerges from the cauldron, swallowing it, one dots one’s own yin mercury like a cat catching a mouse. White clouds greet the summit at dawn—harmonious clear qi rises, the five qi face the origin. Sweet dew sprinkles Mount Sumeru—the divine water of the Flower Pool descends, all illnesses return to spring. Mount Sumeru stands at Heaven and Earth’s center, symbolizing the treasure within the human center. The treasure within is the sacred embryo, also called the Yellow Sprout. The Patriarch’s poem by Zhang Zhen’nu says:  
“Earth thunder shakes the mountain top rain,  
To wash and cleanse, the Yellow Sprout emerges from the earth.”  
This is the meaning.

### Drink Yourself the Wine of Long Life; Who Can Know Such Carefree Wandering?

When the sacred embryo condenses, divine water flows, irrigating the elixir field, naturally producing substance from non-substance, form from formlessness, and all forced efforts become useless. Thus it is said: drink yourself the wine of long life; who can know such carefree wandering? To say “drink yourself,” to say “who can know,” is because the matter of long life and carefree wandering is to steal yin and yang, seize creation, act in accord with Heaven before Heaven, obey Heaven’s time after Heaven. Even Heaven, Earth, and divine spirits cannot fathom it, much less humans.

### Sit and Listen to the Stringless Melody; Clearly Understand the Workings of Creation

Zhuangzi said: “Gather the spirit and live long; forget the spirit and have no life.” Long life is the way of doing for life; no life is the way of non-doing for nature. Understanding the way of nature is the work of nine years facing the wall; facing the wall is the work of ten months nurturing. The nine years is not literally nine years, but nine is the number of pure yang—nine returns of golden liquid, yin exhausted and yang pure. Without exhausting even a hair of yin qi, one cannot become immortal. The ten months is the period of the sacred embryo’s completion and transformation, like a woman’s pregnancy of ten months, the baby emerging from the womb—also a symbolic image. The ten months nurturing work prevents danger and worry; all things are empty; not a trace of foreign qi enters the embryo’s origin, like a wall tens of thousands of feet high, nothing to be seen. Ten months nurturing and nine years facing the wall are one meaning, not two things—both ancient people took the meaning and symbolized it. Because it is nurturing and facing the wall, it is said: sit and listen to the stringless melody. Sitting is not physical sitting, but the heart clear and calm, unmoving and unshaken sitting. Where there is stringed music, there is sound and tone; without stringed music, there is no sound or tone—only emptiness. Since it is said no sound or tone, what is there to listen to? To listen is emptiness yet not emptiness, not emptiness yet emptiness—not stubborn emptiness, but true emptiness. To sit and listen is to leave behind one side of seeing, absolutely not clinging to form. To listen to no stringed melody is to listen yet not listen, having left behind one side of listening, not clinging to sound. The Diamond Sutra says: “If one sees me by form, or seeks me by sound, that person walks the wrong path and cannot see the Tathagata.” The Tathagata is like something coming, yet actually not coming—this is the true emptiness original face, the great gateway to transcend the sacred embryo, the true secret formula to perfect the Dharma body. In sum, the work of non-action lies in the single word sitting. Sitting means stopping at its place, inwardly observing the heart—heart without heart; outwardly observing the form—form without form; afar observing things—things without things. When these three are realized, one only sees emptiness; emptiness empties nothing; nothingness is also nothing; nothingness having no nothingness is called illumination, breaking the void, revealing the whole body alone, neither born nor dying—thus perfect. Having birth is to transcend the illusory body and solidify the foundation of life—the way of returning the elixir, creating existence from nonexistence. No birth is to transcend the Dharma body and realize the nature’s root—the great elixir way, transforming existence into nonexistence. Birth and no birth are the mechanism of creation. Those who know this way begin from nonexistence creating existence for long life; end by returning from existence to nonexistence for no birth. Neither existence nor nonexistence stand; nature and life are cultivated together, clearly understanding Heaven and Earth’s creation mechanism, becoming one with Heaven and Earth.
