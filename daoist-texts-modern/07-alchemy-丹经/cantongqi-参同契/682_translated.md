# Master Zhang Ziyang’s Reading of the Cantong Qi

The wondrous art of the Great Elixir unfolds the law of Heaven and Earth;  
Heaven and Earth revolve, and the Five Phases divide their course.  
When the Five Phases follow their order, the constant dao brings birth and death;  
When the Five Phases rebel, the elixir’s body remains numinous, ever abiding.  

From the void arises the primal essence,  
The two agencies emerge from the One to open the root;  
The Four Symbols never part from the dual forms,  
The Eight Trigrams beget and are begotten in endless cycles.  

All myriad phenomena arise through change and movement,  
Fortune and misfortune, regret and remorse are thus distinguished.  
The common folk use these daily without knowing,  
While the sages can penetrate to the original source.  

Consider the subtlety of the Book of Changes,  
Its marvels exhaust the principles of Heaven and Earth,  
Hence it entrusts its images to these writings.  
When misfortune and fortune alternate, yin and yang rise and fall;  
When difficulty and ignorance arise, movement and stillness attend dawn and dusk.  

Kan and Li are male and female, water and fire;  
Zhen and Dui are dragon and tiger, soul and spirit.  
Guarding the center brings the yellow robe of primal good fortune;  
Meeting excess brings loss of place and honor.  

Yet one does not carefully heed the beginning and end of all things,  
Nor the meeting that reveals the return of the two energies.  
The waning and waxing of the moon correspond to the decline and flourishing of spirit;  
The rising and setting of the sun unite the cold and warmth of honor and protection.  

Establish the foundation of words to clarify the images;  
Once the images are grasped, forget the words.  
Still, set images to point to meaning;  
When true meaning is realized, the images are cast aside.  

The enlightened are simple and easy;  
The confused grow more bewildered and complex.  
Therefore, those who cultivate the true dao,  
When reading the Cantong Qi, do not cling to images or hold fast to texts.
