# Direct Point of the Cantong Qi Preface

The Way of the Great Returning Elixir of Seven Returns and Nine Reversions, the Golden Elixir, is a secret of Heaven and Earth, a mystery feared by ghosts and spirits. It has been passed down mouth to mouth through the mouths of sages, without record in writing. Thus, those who study the dao are as countless as oxen’s hairs; those who truly understand the dao are as rare as the horn of the qilin. Moreover, there are three thousand six hundred side doors and seventy-two winding paths—false teachings mixing with the true, counterfeit confusing the genuine. Though there may be one or two men of aspiration, unable to distinguish jade from stone, like water bearing the posture of the horizon, how many among those of lofty vision remain unbewitched by the evil paths?

In the Eastern Han, the Perfected Wei Boyang received the transmission from the Perfected Yin of Longevity. He attained full realization and completed the great work. Out of compassion for later generations who love the dao, he modeled it on the Way of the Changes (Yijing) and composed the Cantong Qi, divided into three parts: upper, middle, and lower. The beginning explains the Way of governing the cosmos; the middle expounds the principle of nourishing nature; the end reveals the methods of hidden ingestion. The listed articles interweave a single principle, opening new gates, setting many allegories, and drawing the Way near; using the manifest to compare with the unmanifest, showing form to indicate the formless. Among them, the medicines and the fire’s timing—nothing is lacking.

After the book’s completion, he invited the local gentleman Jingxiu Xu to annotate the three parts, elucidating the profound mysteries within the Qi. The Perfected Wei then transmitted it to his fellow countyman Chunyu Shutong; the Chunyu family composed the “Three Phases Categories” in two parts, supplementing and filling the gaps in the Cantong Qi’s lost sayings. Thus, the principles of the Golden Elixir emerged fully, leaving no residue.

The Three Elders all gathered and examined the “Heart Seal” to complete the text, incomparable to all other imitations or conjectures. This is yet another instance of the Cantong Qi’s unity. Later generations’ myriad alchemical scriptures all base themselves upon this; hence, all call it the Master Scripture of the Golden Elixir through the ages. Zhu Xi wrote critical annotations on the Cantong Qi; Cheng Xiangshan also praised it. Thus, it is known that this book is admired by both Confucianism and Daoism alike.

Having exhausted this book, which has circulated for so long, its order has become confused; commentators each express their own views. Some place earlier passages after later ones, others reverse front and back; some mix scripture with commentary, or intersperse preface and main text. Not only is the meaning incoherent, the sequence greatly mistaken, but also there is no distinction between what is scripture, what is annotation, what belongs to Wei, what to Xu, what to Chunyu—so that it all seems as if it were the work of the Perfected Wei alone.

Even more, ignorant persons sometimes take it as a manual for gathering and fighting, or mistakenly as a guide for burning and refining, slandering the sacred dao, burying the true lineage, greatly offending the compassionate heart of the Three Elders who sought to save the world. Can such guilt be spoken of lightly?

In the year of Renyin in the Qianlong reign of the Great Qing, by chance I obtained the annotations of the Nameless Perfected Master Weng and the annotations of the Upper Yang Master Chen. Their scriptures and annotations are each divided into separate categories, their sequence coherent and connected. Scripture stands apart from commentary, supplements fill gaps, text is text, preface is preface, black and white clearly distinguished. The injustice done to this true scripture over a thousand years is here finally redressed.

Between the two annotations, Chen’s is more orderly; thus I take Chen’s edition as the basis. Where the main text’s order seems incoherent, I have slightly rearranged it, dividing sections and annotating them. All metaphors and similes are thoroughly dismantled to dust. Careful comparison with the popular “Direct Point” reveals what is furnace and cauldron, what is medicine, what is yin and yang, what are the Five Phases, what is primordial, what is postnatal, what is fire’s timing, what is cooking and refining, what is inside and outside, what is beginning and end—plain and fully revealed, the crucial points laid bare.

After the book’s completion, it was named the Cantong Direct Point. Should comrades see and read it, they will know that the Way of the Cantong is the secret passed down mouth to mouth by sages. As for the annotations of Wuyuan, they are nothing but the words of wild foxes and tangled vines. Where the main text’s order is incoherent, it especially awaits correction by later enlightened ones.

At that time, in the spring of the first month of the year Jiwei, the fourth year of the Jiaqing reign of the Great Qing, on New Year’s Day at Mount Qiyun,

The Simple and Unadorned Recluse, Wuyuanzi Liu Yiming, composed this preface in the Free Nest.
