# The Scripture of the Kinship of the Three (Upper Chapter on Governing the Realm)

Heaven and Earth, firm and yielding, interlock and enfold each other. Yang holds fast, yin receives; female and male mutually depend. Only thus does creation unfold, and essence and breath expand. Kan and Li stand as crown and head, their light shining and spreading forth. The profound darkness defies measurement, impossible to depict in diagrams. The sage, by careful reckoning, traces and orders the primal root. The four merge in chaos, directly entering the void. The sixty hexagrams revolve, spreading out as a chariot. The dragon-horse takes the reins; the enlightened ruler governs the times. When harmony reigns, all follow; the path is smooth and true. But the crooked way is perilous and obstructed, toppling and endangering the state.

The Great Dao is without sound or scent, neither form nor emptiness—what is there to speak of? Yet within the soundless and scentless dwells yin and yang; within the formless and void lies creation itself. If truly without words, how could yin and yang’s ebb and flow be known? How could the secret workings of creation be revealed? Thus the ancients said: “The Dao is originally wordless; words serve to manifest the Dao.” Heaven does not conceal the Dao; the dragon-horse bears the diagram from the river, revealing Heaven’s mysteries. Fuxi then followed, painting the primordial eight trigrams, and expanded them into sixty-four. Later, King Wen transformed these into the later eight trigrams, which in turn extended into sixty-four, divided into three hundred and eighty-four lines. These were linked with words to clarify the principles of fortune and misfortune, expounding the ten wings of the sage, unfolding the meaning of the text. Thus the principles of the former and later heavens were fully and clearly revealed; the Way of Heaven and Earth’s creation shone forth. Therefore, the Book of Changes is the treasure trove of wisdom sought by sages and worthies in China, the root of cultivating the Dao and establishing virtue. Confucianism reveres this book; Daoism follows this book. The Yellow Emperor’s *Yinfu*, Laozi’s *Dao De Jing*, their principles and meanings all subtly accord with the Book of Changes. Yet the profound words of the sages and their wondrous meanings, later generations rarely grasp their origins, unable to glimpse their far shore. Even a few gifted and resolute souls, catching a word or half-phrase, find no place to begin.

The Immortal Elder Boyang, with a tender heart, drew upon the sages’ intent to guide the world, based on the Dao of the Changes, and revealed the secrets of the *Ming Fu* and *Dao De*, with a thousand metaphors, fully unfolding their teachings—wishing all to become Dao, each to realize the true. Later alchemical scriptures and treatises all derive from the *Kinship*. Thus the *Kinship* is the eternal sovereign of alchemical scriptures. The name “alchemical scripture” truly originates here; the name “Golden Elixir” also begins here. For humans are born holding the qi of Heaven and Earth’s yin and yang and Five Phases, and within the body is this qi and virtue of yin and yang and Five Phases. Qi belongs to life; virtue belongs to nature. Thus nature and life are formed from the qi of Heaven and Earth’s yin and yang and Five Phases. The study of cultivating nature and life follows the Dao of Heaven and Earth’s yin and yang and Five Phases—there is no other method. The Changes is precisely the Dao of Heaven and Earth’s yin and yang and Five Phases. To understand the Dao of Changes is to know the sage’s Dao. Therefore, the Changes begins with Qian and Kun and narrates the hexagrams. The *Kinship* also begins with Qian and Kun to narrate the Dao; its principle is based on the Changes’ principle.

The Changes places Qian and Kun first because Qian is strength—symbolizing Heaven. Heaven is yang, supremely firm; firmness governs strength, thus called Qian-firm. Kun is compliance—symbolizing Earth. Earth is yin, supremely yielding; yielding governs compliance, thus called Kun-yielding. Qian and Kun establish position; firmness and yielding enfold each other. Qian’s yang qi is received and borne by Kun’s yin qi; one female, one male, mutually assisting, they enact creation. Thus the essence of yang and the breath of yin are freely expressed, giving birth to myriad things. The Changes uses Kan and Li as the middle: Kan is outer yin, inner yang, symbolizing the moon; Li is outer yang, inner yin, symbolizing the sun. Sun and moon are the essence and soul of Heaven and Earth, acting in place of Heaven and Earth to create. They are the crown and head of qi’s movement. The sun shines, the moon rises; their light spreads and descends. The four seasons proceed, and all things grow, mature, and gather naturally. The firmness and yielding of Heaven and Earth enable essence and breath to flow; the sun and moon’s coming and going allow light to shine and illuminate. Yet within moves an invisible, formless substance. Its principle is supremely numinous and subtle, hard to fathom, impossible to draw. Thus the sage measures yin and yang’s ebb and flow, traces their primal root, to reveal their mystery.

The four merge in chaos, directly entering the void: the Changes regards Qian and Kun as body, Kan and Li as function. The four merge in chaos, returning to the one qi of the void. This one qi flows, yin then yang, yang then yin, yin and yang interlacing, beginning with Tun and Meng and ending with Jiwei. The remaining sixty hexagrams alternate yin and yang, spreading out as a chariot. The dragon-horse takes the reins, turning the axle rightly to enact creation—this is the grand outline of the Changes. The sovereign arises from the myriad beings, riding six dragons to govern Heaven. Movement and stillness follow the times, perfectly matching the Changes, not daring to err. For the Changes bases itself on the harmony of yin and yang.

The ruler who governs observes the Dao of Heaven, carries out Heaven’s course—this is called being able to harmonize. When harmony reigns, all the people follow; the kingly way is broad and smooth; the path is even and true. But the ruler who violates Heaven’s Dao, loses Heaven’s course—this is called disharmony. Disharmony means no response above and below; the crooked path is perilous and obstructed, toppling and endangering the state. By analogy, the cultivator of the Dao uses firmness and vigor, yielding and compliance as body; uses firmness and yielding in balance as function. Firmness and yielding united, like Qian and Kun matched; firmness and yielding balanced, like Kan and Li’s light descending. Firmness and yielding correspond, strength and compliance blended, essence and breath abundant, the heart sovereign empty and numinous, moving Heaven’s principle—heart upright, heart and body can be cultivated. Indeed, governing the body and governing the state are one principle; an upright heart and an upright ruler are one Dao. There has never been a ruler not upright who could govern the times; never a heart not upright that could preserve the Dao. The Immortal Elder first used the Changes’ principle to govern, presenting it as a guiding principle. Especially the Dao of nature and life is one with the Dao of Changes. Cultivating the body is like governing the realm. Those who do not understand the Dao of Changes cannot cultivate nature and life; those who do not understand governing cannot cultivate heart and body. The Dao of Changes and governing both rest on the harmony of yin and yang. Cultivating nature and life contains the Dao of yin and yang harmony; beyond that, no other method exists. This section emphasizes the word “harmony”: when harmonious, the path is smooth and true; when not harmonious, the crooked path is perilous and fearful. Can the learner not first know this harmony?

The superior person dwells in his chamber; when he speaks, his words are good, and even a thousand li away respond. Consider the lord of ten thousand chariots, seated in the ninefold palace, issuing orders and commands, following yin and yang’s rhythm. He conceals his power, waits for the time, not violating the hexagrams or the months. Tun corresponds to Zi and Shen; Meng uses Yin and Xu. The remaining sixty hexagrams each have their own day. Briefly presenting these two images, yet unable to exhaust them. Establishing justice and setting laws, practicing benevolence and virtue—those who oppose bring misfortune; those who follow bring fortune. Following the timing and laws, with utmost sincerity and secrecy, carefully awaiting the days and hours, examining the ebb and flow. The slightest impurity brings regret and loss as thieves. The two solstices shift their measures, erring and twisting. Deep winter, great heat; midsummer, frost and snow. The two divisions cross and run, never missing a moment. Flood and drought contend; wind and rain are irregular; locusts surge and boil; strange creatures emerge in clusters. Heaven sees these anomalies; mountains collapse, earth splits. The filial son’s sincerity moves the imperial pole. Near comes from one’s own mouth; far flows to distant lands. Sometimes inviting disaster, sometimes bringing blessing; sometimes fostering peace, sometimes causing war. These four arise from the chest and mind. Movement and stillness have their constancy, following their measuring cord. The four seasons proceed properly, matching qi. Firmness and yielding are clearly divided, not interfering. The Five Phases guard their borders, not recklessly expanding or contracting.

The previous section spoke of yin and yang harmony; only then can action arise. But where there is yin and yang, there must be birth and death; birth and death clearly distinguished, yin and yang mutually dependent. Governing a state thus, the state can be governed; cultivating the body thus, the body can be cultivated. The Dao of cultivating the true is to follow Heaven and imitate Earth; every word and deed must be careful and exact, secretly matching Heaven and Earth’s creation, so as to harmonize with Heaven and Earth’s virtue, seizing Heaven and Earth’s qi and fate as one’s own. The *Commentary on the Decisions* says: “The superior person dwells in his chamber; when he speaks, his words are good, and even a thousand li away respond.” Cultivating words establishes sincerity, thus advancing virtue. Because virtue advances, words must be sincere. The chamber is a place unknown to others, known only to oneself. Dwelling in one’s chamber, if one can be cautious in solitude, quietly observing and closely examining, words will not be spoken rashly; once spoken, words must be fully good. Good words bring trust; trust brings flawless conduct; one can move Heaven and Earth, stir beings; thus even a thousand li away respond. The ruler who governs observes Heaven’s Dao, carries out Heaven’s course, issues orders and commands, must heed yin and yang’s rhythm, daring not to violate Heaven’s course—this is the pivot of the gentleman’s words and deeds. The issuing of commands is the master of honor and disgrace. The cultivator uses firmness and yielding, imitating the ruler issuing commands. Following yin and yang’s rhythm, no one with an unright heart can fail to cultivate body; no one with an unclear governing can fail to cultivate heart and body. What is issuing commands and following yin and yang’s rhythm? Yang’s rhythm brings forth all things; yin’s rhythm gathers and restrains all things. Cultivating the Dao has methods of advance and retreat: in yang, use yang; in yin, use yin. Using yang means advancing; using yin means retreating. Each advance and retreat has its rhythm—this is called Heaven and Man harmonizing their issuing, following yin and yang to command. Concealing power, waiting for the time, not violating hexagrams or months: the twelve months, the upper six months belong to yang; the lower six months belong to yin. From Zi to Si are Fu, Lin, Tai, Da Zhuang, Guai, Qian—six yang hexagrams governing them; from Wu to Hai are Gou, Dun, Pi, Guan, Bo, Kun—six yin hexagrams governing them. Yin and yang hexagram qi each proceed in their time. The twelve months flow through sixty hexagrams, totaling three hundred and sixty days; one day corresponds to one line, altogether three hundred and sixty lines; one month of thirty days corresponds to five hexagrams, thirty lines. Beginning after the winter solstice, starting with Tun and Meng, ending with Jiwei. For example, Tun and Meng: Tun is the union of Kan and Zhen; Kan is water, Zhen is thunder; thunder in water—yang moves within yin. Tun corresponds to Zi and Shen; Kan is at Zi, water. Water is born in Shen, flourishes in Zi; yang qi rises at Zi, yang is active. Meng is the union of Gen and Kan; Gen is mountain, Kan is water; water lies beneath the mountain, yang qi halts within yin. Meng uses Yin and Xu; Gen is at Yin storing fire; fire is born at Yin, stored at Xu; yang qi reaches Xu and is concealed; yin is active. Tun governs yang’s birth; Meng governs yang’s nurturing. The Dao of alchemy conceals power within the body, awaiting the time to use it. When advancing yang, yin returns within yang to advance fire, like yang moving within yin in Tun; when yang is sufficient, yang moves within to use yin to retreat fire, like yang halting within yin in Meng. The remaining sixty hexagrams each have their own day; the moon governs five hexagrams, three hundred and sixty days flow through sixty hexagrams. This is the sixty hexagrams spreading as a chariot mentioned above. Briefly presenting these two images, unable to exhaust them, using Tun and Meng as examples of reversal and rectification. The other fifty-eight hexagrams alternate reversal and rectification, each flowing hexagram qi, can be analogized and understood without exhaustive detail. The sixty-four hexagrams are said as sixty because the Dao of creation uses Qian and Kun as body, Kan and Li as function; the sixty hexagrams all derive from these four trigrams, one yin and one yang changing and producing. The cultivator who knows these messages understands gain and loss, knows dusk and dawn. Using Qian and Kun as body, Kan and Li as function, one movement and one stillness, the sixty hexagrams arise naturally, not clinging to hexagram images, yet naturally conforming to them.

Establishing justice and setting laws, applying benevolence and virtue: justice governs firmness and sets laws; benevolence governs softness and applies virtue. When firmness is needed, use firmness to apply laws; when softness is needed, use softness to apply virtue. Laws remove guest qi; virtue nourishes sovereign qi. Justice perfects benevolence; benevolence aids justice. Benevolence and justice proceed together; law and virtue both used—thus the Great Elixir is formed. Violating this, yin and yang become discordant and bring misfortune; following this, yin and yang harmonize and bring fortune. Therefore, one must observe the timing and await the moment, issue commands and act, with divine clarity silently moving, sincere and secret, guarding against danger and risk, carefully awaiting the days of yang and yin birth. Examining the ebb and flow to apply them, not daring to slacken even slightly. Sincerity alone is the thing that brings cultivators from beginning to end. The slightest impurity becomes insincerity. Insincerity brings regret and loss as thieves; yin and yang out of time, the two solstices shift their measures, yin and yang disharmonize, the two divisions cross and run—various misfortunes appear. Though the great Dao is in sight, it does not permit me to succeed. If firmness and yielding are centered and sincere, sincerity matches Heaven; misfortune can turn to fortune, danger can be eased. Just like the filial son’s sincere heart, which moves the imperial pole. In ancient times, the great Shun suffered parental calamity, crying to Heaven, scarcely a word of complaint, completing the granaries and wells; none dared disobey. The blind and deaf burned granaries and covered wells, yet did not die—Heaven rewarded the filial son thus. The cultivator, if able to align human heart with Heaven’s heart, reversing and illuminating yang, only needs a moment. Does Heaven oppose? Heaven does not oppose me, much less humans, much less ghosts and spirits. Near comes from one’s own mouth; far flows to distant lands—this is the superior person dwelling in his chamber; when he speaks good words, even a thousand li away respond; if he speaks ill words, even a thousand li away oppose. Thus sometimes inviting disaster, sometimes bringing blessing; sometimes fostering peace with all in order, sometimes causing war with six cities in chaos. Fortune and misfortune, blessing and calamity, all lie in a single thought in the heart and chest. The square is the voice of the heart, manifest within, shaping without. When the heart is upright, words are good, bringing blessing and peace; when the heart is not upright, words are ill, inviting disaster and war. Therefore, movement and stillness have constancy, following their measuring cord, neither偏 nor倚, according to time and circumstance, following or opposing, matching the four seasons and yin-yang qi. Using firmness and yielding, all is proper; here is clear and certain. The *Commentary on the Decisions* says: “Movement and stillness have constancy; firmness and yielding are distinct”—this is what it means. Firmness and yielding are distinct, so one does not use firmness when yielding is proper, nor yielding when firmness is proper. Metal, wood, water, fire, earth—the Five Phases each guard their borders; the five origins and five virtues each hold their place, neither recklessly expanding nor contracting; all one qi, Heaven’s principle flowing unceasingly. This section emphasizes “movement and stillness have constancy.” To have constancy in movement and stillness is to issue commands; to follow yin and yang’s rhythm is to guard the Five Phases’ borders; not recklessly expanding or contracting is the superior person dwelling in his chamber, speaking good words, having constancy and sincerity, no action out of accord, no word unkind. Opposing or following, advancing or retreating, nothing is impossible or impossible.

The Changes moves in cycles, bending and stretching, returning and turning. Hidden and submerged, transforming within, embracing myriad things, serving as the Dao’s framework. Using the void to govern the manifest, the vessel’s function is emptiness.

The previous section spoke of issuing commands, requiring yin-yang rhythm for fortune. Some think action is from the heart, but truly it is not from the heart. Consider the Changes’ hexagrams moving: one qi up and down, circulating through six voids, bending and stretching, returning and turning, hidden and submerged. Though unseen and unheard, from utmost nothing contains utmost being, from utmost void contains utmost substance. Within, transformations are endless, embracing myriad things, the Dao’s framework. Bending and stretching, returning and turning, is the one yin and one yang called Dao; transforming within is the unfathomable yin and yang called spirit. Using spirit to move Dao, using Dao to manifest spirit, thus from nothing creates being, using vessel and function to return to emptiness. The Changes has no thought, no action, silent and unmoving, yet sensing and thus communicating the world’s affairs—what heart has the Changes? The Dao of nature and life is one with the Changes’ Dao. The Changes has no heart; cultivating the Dao also has no heart. The use of no heart is to follow the time and use it. Following time means respecting principle. Acting according to principle, movement arises from Heaven, not from man—what heart is there?

Thus, tracing the ebb and flow, Kan and Li’s union and disappearance establish words. This section pairs with the next, both clarifying yin-yang messages and verified effects. How to see yin-yang messages? Like winter solstice’s new moon, the sun returns from south to north; underground one yang is born, in the hexagram Fu. Yang qi just born; yang is master, yin is guest. The Fu judgment says: “Entering and exiting without harm.” Specifically, yin and yang entering and exiting, both without injury. Exiting is yang advancing; entering is yin retreating. Establishing the gnomon’s slight firmness—this is to measure the sundial’s shadow length. Slight firmness means yang qi just born. Setting the gnomon to measure the shadow length shows underground yang qi just born. Slight yang just born, the pitch pipe corresponds to Huang Zhong. The month pillar is Zi, the eleventh month. Yang advancing’s sign here grows and gradually manifests. Heaven’s yang qi spreads and begins creation; Earth’s yin qi is soft and warm, nurturing life. All beings receive the qi of Heaven and Earth’s yin and yang intersecting, drawing from beginning and birth, thus gaining their constancy. Like the cultivator, firm qi just stirring, qi still slight, must nurture this spark of life as root of returning to origin and returning to source, never leaving it for a moment. The sun from winter solstice gradually returns to Minor Cold; three yang are born. The hexagram is Lin. The great furnace is lit; yang qi issues regulations, opens the path, light begins to advance; the sundial’s shadow lengthens here. The month pillar is Chou, corresponding to Da Lü, the twelfth month. Like the cultivator, firm qi lengthens, working at the furnace, ordering body and mind, restraining yin to open the path, supporting yang to correct the light, gradually advancing, skill never lacking. Like the sun’s lengthening.

The sun from Minor Cold returns to Beginning of Spring; three yang are born. The righteous qi fills the earth, rising from low to high; Heaven’s qi rises, Earth’s qi descends; inner yang, outer yin. The hexagram is Tai, meaning firmness and yielding both flourish. Yin and yang connect, small departing and great coming. Yin follows yang’s strength; qi is gentle and warm, like spokes forming a wheel, yang and yang on the same path, perfectly one qi. The month pillar is Yin, the first month. Like the cultivator, firm qi advances to center; guest qi bows; yin and yang harmonize; nature and temperament peaceful; firm but not rash, yielding but not weak.

The sun from Beginning of Spring returns to Spring Equinox, moving with the times, from warm to gradually hot; four yang are born. The hexagram is Da Zhuang. The month pillar is Mao, the second month. Mao is the place of wood’s flourishing, the gate of birth virtue. Yet Da Zhuang conceals weakness within; thus elm pods fall, returning to root. Virtue mingled with punishment, punishment and virtue oppose; yin and yang separate; day and night divide from here; day grows longer, night shorter. Like the cultivator, yang firm qi is strong; must bathe and nurture, return to root, beware of misfortune, await yin qi’s retreat and yang qi’s growth; cannot forcefully invite guest qi—this is “do not forget, do not assist.”

The sun from Spring Equinox returns to Clear and Bright; from here yang qi lengthens, yin qi wanes; yin qi nearly gone, yang qi pure; five yang born. The hexagram is Guai, meaning deciding yin to retreat, yang qi rising and advancing. Like the cultivator, firm qi vigorous, yin qi weak. From here one can wash away old stains, shake off the dust of human heart’s birth, spread wings and fly straight ahead. “Spread” means to stir the Dao heart’s firm qi; “search” means to seek the human heart’s filth. Using Dao heart to govern human heart, no impurity enters, not allowing a trace of guest evil qi to remain within the square inch.

The sun from Clear and Bright returns to Beginning of Summer; six yang born. The hexagram is Qian. The month pillar is Si, the fourth month. Qian is firm, bright, its light covers four neighbors; between two pure yang qi, all things flourish here. Like the cultivator, yang firm advances to pure essence, again seeing Qian’s original face. Good knowledge and good ability, perfectly Heaven’s principle, without a trace of human desire or selfishness. Like a red sun shining in the sky, all kinds of yin evils vanish. This advancing yang fire uses the Dao of Nine. Yang qi peaks at Si. Yang peaks must meet yin; thus yin qi corresponds. The sun from Beginning of Summer crosses to Summer Solstice, returning from north to south; underground one yin is born; hexagram is Gou. From here yin qi follows yang qi, and the sign of frost’s treading begins. One yin born is not frost’s time, yet frost’s treading begins here, the earliest of yin qi. At this time, the spring water at the bottom of the well is cold, responding to Earth qi. The month pillar is Wu, the fifth month, corresponding to Rui Bin. Yin qi lies hidden underground; yang qi must retreat; yin qi must advance; yin is master. Like the cultivator, yang firm increases to utmost; must preserve this yang firmness, refining it into an imperishable thing—this is supreme achievement. The work of preservation is the work of operating the Yin Talisman. The Yin Talisman means yang peak must be nourished by yin. Nourishing yang with yin, yang qi does not become excessive; this is yin and yang conforming. The yin of the Yin Talisman is not external guest qi’s yin, but the true yin of yang qi’s gathering and retreat. Here true yang retreats, there true yin is born. True yin is born and false yin vanishes and transforms. If yang qi does not retreat, true yin does not appear; yang peak must meet yin. One yin secretly born, guest qi again comes; gaining and losing, great matters lost. Thus when yang firm advances to pure, the Yin Talisman must be used. Like the fifth month’s Gou, yin is master. But using yin requires discerning true and false; true yin follows true; false yin follows false. Following true nourishes yang; following false harms yang. Therefore, the Gou’s image judgment says: “Do not take a wife; cannot prosper.” Also says: “Heaven and Earth meet; all things manifest; one true, one false; Heaven and Earth separated.” Thus Kun’s first line warns of frost in the belly and hard ice—this is caution in using yin.

The sun from Summer Solstice returns to Minor Heat; two yang retreat and two yin born; hexagram is Dun. The month pillar is Wei, the sixth month. Yang qi begins to gather and retreat. Like the cultivator, withdrawing from the world and position, gathering spirit, nurturing virtue, lingering in obscurity, hiding brightness and nurturing dusk, great wisdom seeming foolish, great skill seeming clumsy, not letting guest qi seize an opportunity to harm. The sun from Minor Heat gradually returns to Beginning of Autumn; three yang retreat and three yin born; hexagram is Pi. The month pillar is Shen, the seventh month. At this time, Heaven qi descends, Earth qi rises; all things close and do not open; though sprouts exist, they do not grow. Like the cultivator, firm Dao retreats to center; yielding Dao advances to center; firmness and yielding correspond; yielding nourishes firmness; its yin acts like yang’s disappearance and name loss.

The sun from Beginning of Autumn returns to Autumn Equinox; four yang retreat and four yin born; hexagram is Guan. The month pillar is You, the eighth month, mid-autumn. Punishment contains virtue; bearing and storing the tiny young; old and withered return to flourishing. Like all things gathering, yet mustard and wheat sprout anew, growing and sprouting, emerging to live. Like the cultivator, firmness nourished by yielding; life force within; though dark outside, inside is bright. Like mid-autumn’s punishment containing virtue.

The sun from Autumn Equinox returns to Cold Dew; five yang retreat and five yin born; hexagram is Bo. The month pillar is Xu, the ninth month. Yang qi from here destroys its form; all things perish and fall. Like the cultivator, dissolving the later heaven’s illusory limbs, eliminating formed firm and dry qi nature. When transformed qi is exhausted, no awareness or knowledge remains; soul and spirit lost; no spirit yet spirit.

The sun from White Dew returns to Beginning of Winter; six yang retreat and six yin pure; hexagram is Kun. The month pillar is Hai, the tenth month. Pure yin without yang. Like the cultivator, firm qi retreats and hides, nurturing emptiness and nothingness, returning to the silent, scentless, utmost still place. Beyond this, stillness reaches extremity and returns to movement; another wondrous use appears. Attached below is a diagram of six yin and six yang for reference.

Between dark and new moon, the talisman moves in the middle. Chaos and primal mist, female and male follow each other. Moisture nourishes and moistens, bestowing transformation and flow. Heaven and Earth’s numinous spirits cannot be measured. Used to secure the body, hidden in form and concealed. Beginning in the northeast, the home of the Dipper. Turning right, the wheel retches and sprouts. The hidden pool shows images, emitting refined light. Above Ang and Bi, Zhen emerges as the sign. Yang qi’s origin, initial nine hidden dragon. Yang stands on three, yin passes through eight. Three days of Zhen movement, eight days of Dui action. Nine two sees the dragon, peaceful and bright. Three five virtue attained, Qian’s body thus completed. Nine three evening vigilance, diminishing the divine talisman. Rise and fall gradually change, finally returning to the beginning. Xun continues its lineage, firmly holding and controlling. Nine four sometimes leaps, advancing and retreating, the Dao is perilous. Gen governs advance and stop, must not exceed time. Twenty-three days, guarding the bow’s period. Nine five flying dragon, Heaven’s position adds joy. Six five Kun receives, binding beginning and end. Nurturing many sons, the world’s mother. Upper nine proud dragon, battling virtue in the wild, using nine fluttering, as Dao’s rules. Yang numbers ended, ended then rise again. Following feelings and matching nature, turning and uniting. Circulating the celestial pivot, rising and falling, up and down. Circulating six lines, hard to observe. Thus no fixed position, the Changes’ ancestral root.

The previous section used one year’s twelve months to illustrate yin-yang’s mutual use. This section uses one month’s thirty days to illustrate bright yang’s advance and retreat, all to clarify following yin-yang rhythm’s application. The month and day: one year’s twelve meetings, each month one meeting. Between dark and new moon, sun and moon unite, like talisman contracts moving on the middle path. The middle path is the Yellow Path, the sun’s path. Sun path and moon path intersect and move, precisely at dark’s end and new’s beginning. At this time, yin and yang upper qi intersect, chaos and primal mist, female and male follow; yang embraces yin, yin embraces yang; harmonious qi coils and gathers; moisture nourishes and moistens; yang bestows and yin transforms; one qi flows. Yet this female and male following, the mechanism of bestowing and transforming and flowing, is formless and traceless, unseen and unknowable; even Heaven and Earth’s numinous spirits cannot measure it, much less humans. Like the cultivator, utmost emptiness and utmost stillness, used to secure the body, hidden in form and concealed, all things hard to harm, creation hard to move. For Heaven and Earth can control form, but not formless; control qi, but not no qi; control heart, but not no heart. Beginning in northeast Dipper’s home, moonlight reaches northeast, fully losing pure yin’s image—the Changes calls this “losing friends in the northeast.” Turning right, the wheel retches and sprouts; yin below gives birth to yang; hidden pool shows images, emitting refined light. At Bi and Mao in southwest Kun land, Kun conceives Zhen, showing the moth’s brow light—this is “Zhen emerges as subtle,” yang qi creating auspicious beginnings—the Changes calls this “gaining friends in southwest.” At this time, slight yang just born, in Qian hexagram is initial nine hidden dragon. Like the cultivator, utmost stillness then movement, empty chamber births white, a point of true numinous light issuing from darkness. This point of true spirit is easily lost and hard to find; luckily seen, must quickly be gathered into the jar as root of returning to origin and source. Preserve it, cherish it, not leaving it for a moment. The moon’s yang light establishes foundation at three days; yang qi begins to communicate at eight days. Communication means yin qi begins to connect with yang qi, harmoniously. Three standing means three days of Zhen movement; eight communicating means eight days of Dui action. Light has Dui image; yin within yang half; its level like a string, like a bowstring—called upper string. In Qian hexagram is nine two seeing the dragon. Like the cultivator, firm yang advances to center, thus peaceful and bright; yin qi follows, neither hiding nor concealing, can avoid harm from external things. By the fifteenth day, three five virtue attained, light and qi complete, three yang pure and whole, Qian’s body thus formed; in Qian hexagram is nine three evening vigilance. Like the cultivator, spirit full, firm qi strong, three five united, Golden Elixir has form. Yet yang peaks above, must diminish below; rise and fall alternate, finally returning to beginning. Evening vigilance means guarding against danger and risk, to avoid misfortune. By the eighteenth day, one yin secretly born, light begins to wane, Xun continues its lineage, yang light gradually retreats. Like the cultivator, firm qi advancing to utmost, must use softness to meet it, firmly aid and hold, nurture its firmness. In Qian hexagram is nine four sometimes leap. Sometimes means doubt. Doubting its advance and retreat on the Dao is perilous, utmost caution. By the twenty-third day, yang half yin half, has Gen image, its level like a string, also like a bowstring—called lower string. Gen governs advance and must stop. Like the cultivator, firm yang retreats to center, firmness and yielding united, neither偏 nor倚 called center. At this time, must bathe, not exceed time, retreat too far. In Qian hexagram is nine five flying dragon. Flying dragon means firm and center, pure essence, firm but not rash, yielding but not weak, adapting and transforming, only essence and unity, holding the center. Like moon’s twenty-eight days, metal and water balanced, light advances not to extreme, light retreats not to dark. At this position, good knowledge and ability, Dao heart always present, human heart peaceful, perfectly Heaven’s principle, resting at utmost goodness, again seeing original firmness and yielding as one; “my fate is mine, not Heaven’s; Heaven is me, I am Heaven, walking with Heaven”—is this not joyful? By the thirtieth day, six five Kun receives, yang light fully concealed, pure Kun image. Yang qi completes a cycle, beginning and ending with Kun. Kun binds yang qi’s beginning and end, thus nurturing many sons. Also yin extreme gives birth to yang; the world is the mother of kinds, endlessly generating. In Qian hexagram is upper nine proud dragon. Proud means yang’s extreme. Yang light retreats to pure Kun, gaining Kun’s warmth and nurturing, its qi full within, stillness extreme then movement, yin and yang coil and gather; thus the image of battling virtue in the wild. This proud dragon battling in the wild differs somewhat from the *Zhou Yi*’s Qian and Kun upper nine and upper six judgments. The *Zhou Yi*’s proud dragon speaks of yang’s excess; battling in the wild speaks of yin’s disharmony. The *Kinship*’s proud dragon speaks of yang reaching purity; battling in the wild speaks of yin and yang coiling and gathering. One must look at the two words “battling virtue.” Battling virtue in the wild shows yang virtue; cannot lack yin virtue. Borrow yin to nourish yang; yang qi at extreme returns to root, then re-arises from yin. Thus the next line says: “Using nine fluttering, as Dao’s rules.” Fluttering means flying up and down. The Qian hexagram says: “Using nine sees the group of dragons without heads, auspicious.” The cultivator, able to follow the moon’s waxing and waning rules, when to advance firmness and immediately advance firmness; when to use softness and immediately use softness; changing with the times, firmness and yielding precise; fluttering uncertain, sometimes up, sometimes down; welcoming it without seeing its head, following it without seeing its tail; firmness’s traces all transform; not firm yet firm, firm yet not firm, only seen in emptiness. Firm and nurtured to emptiness, yang’s number ended, returning to Kun origin. Yin extreme births yang; ended then rises again; following feelings and matching nature, turning and uniting; the great medicine arises, from subtle to manifest, like the celestial pivot circulating, rising and falling, up and down, circulating through six yin and six yang line positions. This is the most numinous and wondrous heavenly secret, primordial and not opposed by Heaven, later and following Heaven’s time, not something ordinary can observe. Therefore, the Changes’ yin and yang have no fixed position; Qian, Kun, six yin, six yang are the Changes’ ancestral root. The other sixty-two hexagrams all arise from Qian, Kun, yin and yang’s timely changes. Knowing the Dao of Qian, Kun, yin and yang’s changes is to grasp the Changes’ ancestral root. Using nine and using six, not missing their time; advancing and retreating, sixty-two hexagrams all in use, naturally conforming to one year’s days. Moving through south and north’s seasons, matching one month, moonlight’s waxing and waning qi mechanism, no need to cling to text or images; can gain images and forget words, gain meaning and forget images. Attached below is a diagram of moonlight’s waxing and waning for reference.

Constantly following Earth’s geography, receiving Heaven’s proclamation. Profound, remote, and subtle, barriers and connections. Responding to measure and nurturing kinds, the origin of yin and yang. Vast and vague, no one knows its beginning. First lost the track, later became the lord. No flatness without slope, the Dao’s nature. Changing and growing, ebb and flow mutually cause. Ending in Kun and returning to beginning, like linked rings. Emperors inherit and govern, lasting a thousand years.

The two sections use one year and one month to indicate the principle of yin and yang’s mutual use, fully and clearly. The Dao of cultivating the true is the Dao of one yin and one yang; yang governs firmness and vigor; yin governs yielding and compliance. Advancing yang means advancing firmness and vigor; operating yin means operating yielding and compliance. Advancing firmness must advance to center, then it is strong; operating yielding must operate to center, then it is compliant. Firmness at center is firm but not rash; yielding at center is yielding but not weak. Firmness contains yielding; yielding contains firmness; then nature is round and bright, neither偏 nor倚 called center; the Golden Elixir is formed. Yet the Golden Elixir’s Dao uses Heaven and Earth as furnace and cauldron; firmness must be like Heaven, which nothing can harm—firm and vigorous; yielding must be like Earth, which nothing cuts—compliant and smooth. Constantly following Earth’s geography means following Earth’s yielding and compliance; nothing is not cut, nothing is not born. Receiving Heaven’s proclamation means imitating Heaven’s firmness and vigor; nothing begins not, nothing can bend. Able to imitate Earth, then yielding matches Earth; able to imitate Heaven, then firm vigor matches Heaven. If truly firm and vigorous like Heaven, yielding and compliant like Earth, then easy to know and simple to do. That is good knowledge and good ability, perfectly Heaven’s principle, utmost goodness without evil. Look at Heaven above and Earth below; their qi is most profound and subtle; their forms most distant and faint; seeming separated, yet their qi secretly connects and links. Connected by responding to measure, nurturing kinds; all things arise with the times. Their place of arising is the origin of yin and yang. This origin, though profound, remote, and faint, vast and hard to approach, vague and hard to measure, no one can know its beginning. Yet observing Earth’s growth of living things, not knowing its beginning, one can somewhat know its beginning. The Changes’ Kun hexagram judgment says: “First lost, later gaining lord.” The commentary says: “First lost the Dao, later following to gain constancy.” Earth is utmost yin without yang, receiving Heaven’s yang as yang. When Heaven’s yang qi comes, Earth yang; when Heaven’s yang qi leaves, Earth yin. When Heaven qi descends, Earth qi rises, yin qi active, yang qi retreats, all things close and do not open—Earth without yang, like lost track, no lord. When Heaven qi rises, Earth qi descends, yang qi active, yin qi obedient, all things open and prosper—Earth with yang, like following constancy, having lord. First lost track, yang extreme then yin, yin active, later becoming lord; yin extreme then yang, yang active. Yang active, all things open like Earth’s flatness; yin active, all things closed like Earth’s slope. Heaven and Earth’s Dao: great going and small coming, small going and great coming; no yang without yin, flatness without slope. Their yin and yang flatness and slope are all Dao’s nature. Though Heaven and Earth have no heart, thus the Dao of change and transformation: yin and yang waxing and waning; yang extreme then yin, yin extreme then yang; ebb and flow mutually cause, ending in Kun and returning to beginning, like linked rings. All this clarifies Heaven and Earth’s yang firm and yin compliant, yin and yang one qi flowing. If emperors inherit Heaven and govern, imitating Heaven and Earth, using firmness and yielding, harmonizing with Heaven and Earth’s virtue, with sun and moon’s brightness, with four seasons’ order, with ghosts and spirits’ fortune and misfortune, primordial and not opposed by Heaven, later and following Heaven’s time, governing the world then the world is governed; cultivating the Dao then the Dao is fulfilled. Within can perfect self; without can perfect others. Though lasting a thousand years, enjoying boundless life, compared to ordinary people, even easier. In ancient times, Fuxi and Shennong cultivated this Dao, living over ten thousand years; Huang Bu cultivated this Dao and rode dragons to ascend Heaven—this is proof.

Governing the realm begins with renewing and reforming the old. Managing the subtle and minute, opening and spreading treasures. The essential Dao’s chief, uniting creation’s framework. The lines and images move within; fortune and misfortune arise without; the five latitudes cross and follow, responding to time and stirring. Four and seven discordant, sorrow and joy bow and raise. Wen Chang governs records, questioning and assisting the throne. Hundred officials each oversee their departments. From origin to end, the threads of life and death; sometimes the ruler is proud and indulgent, arrogant and full, violating the Dao; sometimes ministers are evil flatterers, acting out of line. The waxing and waning of the moon, discord and change bring misfortune. Law enforcers criticize and rebuke, questioning faults and admonishing the ruler. The pole star receives correctness, leisurely and freely managing below. The Bright Hall spreads governance; the state harms no Dao.

Bright Hall: a model enlightened ruler.

Above, borrowing the Changes’ principle, sometimes speaking of Heaven’s Dao, sometimes of kingly Dao, sometimes of sage Dao, dividing and discussing. This section concludes with governing, clarifying the work of return and restoration. Return means in the later heaven returning to the former heaven, the work of action; thus called the chief of governing. Renewing and reforming, the Dao of return desires to take the new. But to take the new, none precedes reforming the old. The old is the stain of former habits. Reforming and removing old stains quiets the human heart. The cauldron is the vessel for refining the medicine. To take the new, the cauldron’s contents are refined anew, then the Dao heart arises. Managing the subtle and minute means caution in what is unseen, fear in what is unheard, applying effort in the most hidden and subtle places, thus making the human heart yielding and compliant. Opening and spreading treasures means cutting and preserving in change, advancing and preserving in communication, operating divine mechanisms in every move, thus stirring the Dao heart’s firmness and vigor. When the human heart is yielding and compliant, the Dao heart firm and vigorous, reforming the old and renewing the cauldron, renewing the cauldron and reforming the old, naturally Heaven’s heart moves, utmost goodness without evil. Yet the key to renewing and reforming lies in the Dao heart. The essential Dao’s chief is the Big Dipper’s seventh star, also called the Leader Star, the Breaking Army Star, also the Heavenly Gang Star. The Heavenly Gang governs creation’s authority, the North Pole’s law enforcer. Thus moving the circumpolar stars, governing the many stars’ order, creation’s essential Dao. When the Heavenly Gang moves rightly, the five latitudes and many stars guard their places; the twenty-eight constellations all rotate timely, not missing their seasons, thus auspicious. If moved slightly wrong, the five latitudes and many stars do not follow their norm; the twenty-eight constellations all discordant, sorrowful and joyful, losing order, thus inauspicious. All this arises from human affairs’ planning and evaluation. The Wen Chang stars are six: first the chief general, second the deputy general, third the noble minister, fourth the treasury officer, fifth the life officer, sixth the prison officer—these are Heaven’s six offices. They record Heaven’s Dao, govern fortune and misfortune, question and assist the throne, the hundred officials each oversee their departments’ good and evil. Good leaves auspicious signs; evil leaves ominous signs. Tracing these auspicious and ominous signs’ beginnings, grasping human fortune and misfortune’s end, one can know the threads of life and death. Thus sometimes the ruler is proud and indulgent, arrogant and full, violating the governing Dao; sometimes ministers are evil flatterers, acting out of line, losing governance, surely bringing lunar and solar anomalies, waxing and waning irregular, discordant and abnormal, showing misfortune. Their fault lies with law enforcers not strict, criticizing and admonishing, yet burdening the ruler, harm greatest. The Heavenly Gang moves with the times, the pole star guards correctness, residing in place, moving leisurely and freely, with the many stars together. Crossing palaces and passing seasons, moving through four seasons, myriad things arise. Law enforcers cautious and orderly, then the ruler humbly faces south, sitting in Bright Hall to govern affairs; the emperor’s Dao flourishes afar. The cultivator’s Dao heart’s true feeling has firmness, like the Heavenly Gang in the sky, the state’s law enforcer. The Dao heart’s true knowledge governs awareness, like Wen Chang’s record keeping. The Dao heart’s master is like the pole star guarding correctness, like the human ruler in Bright Hall governing. True feeling not obscured, the five origins and five virtues mutually generate, perfectly one qi, like the Heavenly Gang pointing true, the five latitudes crossing and following, responding to time and stirring. False feeling once arises, the five things and five thieves mutually restrain, each with its nature, like the Heavenly Gang pointing wrongly, the twenty-eight constellations discordant, sorrowful and joyful, bowing and raising. True knowledge and awareness examine the six root gates, seven emotions and six desires, five things and five thieves’ wild movements, like Wen Chang’s record keeping of each department’s good and evil. The heart sovereign rules centrally and rightly, like the pole star guarding correctness, the ruler in Bright Hall governing. The cultivator, able to stir Dao heart to govern human heart, then true feeling not obscured, true knowledge always present, yin qi gradually transforms, yang qi gradually pure, renewing and reforming, nature settled and fate condensed, acting and entering non-action, all bodies orderly, all worries ceased—what arrogance, excess, violation of Dao, evil flatterers, loss of order, misfortune and harm remain? Alas! The Dao of cultivating the true is also a Dao of governing. If one understands governing’s fortune and misfortune, then one can know cultivating the true’s fortune and misfortune. The Immortal Elder’s upper chapter first compares governing to cultivating the true—how wondrous! How subtle!
