# The Scripture of the Kinship of the Three (Mid-section: On Inner Nourishing of the Nature)

If one intends to nourish the nature and extend life, one must first carefully consider the end after the beginning. Before the final stage, one must contemplate the origin. The human being’s embodied form is originally a unity of nothingness. The primordial essence and cloud-like breath are entrusted at the outset. Yin and yang set the measure, the dwelling place of soul and spirit. The yang spirit is the sun-like soul; the yin spirit is the moon-like spirit. Soul and spirit mutually serve as house and chamber. Nature governs the inner abode, firmly established in the secret chambers of the kidneys and lungs. The emotions manage the outer realm, building walls and city ramparts. Only when the walls and ramparts are intact can the person dwell in peace within. At this moment, emotions harmonize with Heaven and Earth. Heaven moves and is straight; breath spreads and essence flows. Earth is still and contracts, serving as the Dao’s dwelling hut. The firm acts and then withdraws; the soft transforms and nourishes. Nine returns and seven reverses; eight goes back and six resides. Male is white, female is red; metal and fire mutually bind. Then water settles fire—the beginning of the Five Phases. The highest goodness is like water: clear and without flaw. The form and image of the Dao, the true and mysterious, are difficult to depict. Transforming and dispersing, each occupies its own place. Like a chicken’s egg, white and black correspond; stretched out one inch, this is the primal beginning. Four limbs and five viscera, sinews and bones all come together. After spanning ten months, it breaks out of its membrane. The bones are soft and can be curled; the flesh is smooth like lead.

Like lead: originally like honey

The ancient immortals say: “To cultivate nature, first cultivate life; only then can one enter the scriptures of practice. To cultivate life without cultivating nature is the first fault in practice.” For nature is yin, life is yang; both yin and yang must be employed, nature and life must be cultivated together, only then can one enter the wondrous realm where form and spirit are both subtle and united with the Dao in truth. Therefore, before cultivating nature, one must urgently cultivate life. Having completed life, then one cultivates nature. There has never been one who cultivates life not nature and transcends the mundane; nor one who cultivates nature not life and enters sagehood. The Immortal Elder first raises the way of nourishing nature by saying: “If one intends to nourish nature, one must first extend life and delay the appointed time.” This is to show that if one wishes to nourish nature, one cannot neglect first extending life. If one is of superior wisdom and sharp roots, one need not cultivate life first but immediately cultivate nature, comprehending all at once and ascending directly to the realm of the sages. Yet such superior wisdom is rare, while the mediocre and inferior are many. If one does not first cultivate life but immediately nourishes nature, one becomes a solitary yin of oneself; if even a trace leaks, one cannot avoid the calamity of casting away the body within the body. Hence, one must first cultivate the method of return by doing, to solidify the foundation of life; then proceed to embrace the unity of non-action to understand the root of nature. When both nature and life are completed, the original life is undying, enduring as long as Heaven and Earth. But the way of extending life is the way of delaying the appointed time. Delaying the appointed time means pushing back the time of death. Only by pushing back the time of death can one extend life. Yet to delay the appointed time, one must carefully consider how one dies. To consider how one dies, one must first ponder how one lives. Life comes first, death follows. Confucius said: “If one does not know life, how can one know death?” For if one does not know how to live, one does not know how to die; once one knows how to live, one then knows how to die. To know the mechanism of life and death, to thus push back death and extend life, is not difficult.

Originally, the human body is one without form. Because of ordinary father and mother, male and female unite, primordial essence and breath are entrusted at the beginning, from nothingness giving rise to being. The male’s breath belongs to yang; the female’s breath belongs to yin. Yin and yang breaths interweave; male and female soul and spirit dwell between them. The soul is the yang spirit like the sun; the spirit is the yin spirit like the moon. Soul and spirit mutually serve as house and chamber. The soul’s nature governs the interior, firmly established in the secret chambers of the kidneys and lungs; the spirit belongs to essence, managing the exterior, building walls and city ramparts as the outer residence. The kidneys and lungs are like the inner five viscera and six entrails; the walls and ramparts are like the outer four limbs and a hundred bones. Only when the walls and ramparts are complete can the person dwell securely within. Thus at the time yin and yang interweave, male and female unite with passion, like Heaven above and Earth below. Heaven and Earth correspond; Heaven moves and is straight, breath spreads and essence flows; Earth is still and contracts, serving as the Dao’s dwelling hut. In the male is the firm Dao, one act and then retreat; in the female is the soft Dao, transforming and nourishing life. The upper breaths of yin and yang condense and form image; the fetal origin is already formed. Nine is the number of metal; seven the number of fire; eight the number of wood; six the number of water. Nine returns and seven reverses; eight goes back and six resides—metal, wood, water, and fire breaths all enter the womb. Nine returns and seven reverses, eight goes back and six resides—this return is different from the return of reverse use. This return is the yin and yang breaths of male and female returning to the womb, from outside to inside. The male’s essence is white, belonging to metal; the female’s blood is red, belonging to fire. The metal and fire breaths bind and gather in one place; within metal is the breath of water; within fire is the breath of wood; thus water settles fire. Fire refines metal; water aids fire; wood generates fire; metal generates water. Metal, wood, water, and fire mutually steam and transform; within them is the true earth, the origin of the Five Phases. Though the womb contains the transformations of the Five Phases, at the moment yin and yang interweave, secretly a point of primordial creation enters within, giving birth first to water. This water is born before Heaven and Earth, clear and without flaw. It is the image of the Dao, the true and mysterious, difficult to depict, reaching the utmost void yet containing the utmost being, reaching the utmost emptiness yet containing the utmost substance. The male and female essence and blood cannot work without this water. This water is formless yet able to generate form; thus its transformations are unpredictable. First it becomes water and generates the kidneys; second it becomes fire and generates the heart; third it becomes wood and generates the liver; fourth it becomes metal and generates the lungs; fifth it becomes earth and generates the spleen. Transforming and dispersing, each resides in its own place. Yet though each resides in its own place, the breaths of the Five Phases still gather in one spot, like a chicken’s egg, white and black corresponding. Black is yin; white is yang; yin and yang correspond, one breath wholly contained. Hence it is said: stretched out one inch, this is the primal beginning. The primal beginning is the root. When the root is established, branches and trunks naturally sprout. Hence it is said: “Four limbs and five viscera, sinews and bones all come together.” This means the four limbs, five viscera, sinews, and bones are all formed and perfected from the transformation of one breath. After spanning ten months, breath is sufficient and form complete; breaking out of its membrane, bones are soft and can be curled; flesh is smooth like lead. Such is the way of human birth.

If one carefully understands the principle of this birth, harmonizing one’s true yin and true yang, and cultivates against the current, one still comprehends the one breath in the womb, forming the sacred embryo, warming and nourishing it for ten months. Outside the body there is a body; creation and transformation come from oneself. One can thus push back death and extend life. Ah! To go against the current is the way of becoming an immortal, which is indeed not easy to understand. Yet to go with the current is the way of human birth, which is also difficult to grasp. If one knows the way of human birth, then inverting it is the way of becoming an immortal. Alas! People do not carefully consider the way of human birth but rashly imagine learning immortality—how lamentable!

Kan (Water) is male as the moon; Li (Fire) is female as the sun. The sun bestows virtue; the moon spreads light. The moon receives the sun’s transformation, its body not diminished or harmed. If yang loses its accord, yin invades its brightness; waning and waxing erode, overshadowing and opposing. Yang’s form disappears; yin’s calamity arises. Male and female mutually assist, inhaling and exhaling to nourish; female and male intermix, seeking likeness. Metal transforms into water; water’s nature is circuitous and orderly. Fire transforms into earth; water cannot flow. Male moves outward and acts; female is still and conceals within. Overflowing beyond limits, the female binds it. The spirit restrains the soul; it must not be excessive or indulgent. Neither cold nor heat, advancing and retreating in harmony, each obtains its accord, both emitting their tokens of proof.

The previous section spoke of the way of human birth, formed by the union of yin and yang. This section expands the analogy, proving the way of cultivating immortality: without the union of yin and yang, the spiritual embryo cannot form. For Kan hexagram is male, its body yin, symbolizing the moon; Li hexagram is female, its body yang, symbolizing the sun. The moon is originally black, pure yin without yang; borrowing the sun to give light, every month at waning and waxing, it meets the sun. The sun bestows virtue; the moon spreads light; the moon receives the sun’s transformation, and the black body is thus given brightness, not diminished or harmed. This is how sun and moon correspond in time. If sun and moon lose their accord and regular way, yin errs and yang deviates; the moon’s yin breath invades and harms the sun’s body. Waning and waxing erode the moon, overshadowing its brilliance; yang’s form disappears, yin’s oppression causes calamity. The sun’s way and moon’s way cross obliquely. At the time of crossing, the sun is below, the moon above; the sun’s rays strike the moon, and the moon produces light. If they are in the same degree north and south, or east and west, their bodies face each other, overshadowing their light; yin and yang contend without harmony. At new moon is a solar eclipse; at full moon is a lunar eclipse. A solar eclipse is yin covering yang; a lunar eclipse is yang covering yin. Both eclipses arise from yin and yang’s excessive dominance. Likewise, male and female mutually assist, one inhales, one exhales, thus nourishing the seed. All things with male and female mixed, same kind intermingling, thus conceive offspring. This is the way of yin and yang interweaving, the endless way of birth and growth. Also, metal transforms into water; water’s nature is flowing and continuous, forming patterns; fire transforms into earth; earth thickly accumulates, blocking water so water cannot flow. Also, male moves actively outward; female is still and conceals inward. If the male covets the female’s form, indulging excessively in desire, intercourse beyond limits, losing the male’s active essence, the male is instead bound by the female. These two, yin and yang harmonizing but not harmonized, birth carries killing, and calamity arises. From this one sees that yin and yang value harmony and union, especially the union of the proper center. To attain the proper center is true yin and true yang; to miss the proper center is false yin and false yang. The difference between true and false lies only between proper and improper center. Cultivators use the spirit’s true emotion to ring the soul’s spiritual nature. The spirit is the Dao heart, the firm emotion of true knowledge; the soul is the human heart, the gentle nature of spiritual knowledge. The gentle nature governs advance and retreat with little restraint, lingering on objects, stirring emotions on seeing scenes; the firm emotion is decisive and commanding. The spirit rings the soul; with the firmness of emotion and gentleness of nature, the human heart is still and the Dao heart manifests. Nature and emotion unite; firmness and gentleness become one breath. Yet though the Dao heart governs the human heart, it suffices to have the human heart gentle and obedient. If governing too much, always making the human heart the matter, the Dao heart becomes obscured; extreme clarity turns to darkness. Within the Dao heart, the human heart sneaks in and arises; nature and emotion diverge; good turns to harm. Hence it is said: one must not be excessive or indulgent. Neither cold nor heat means nature is not disturbed and emotion not confused; do not forget or assist the work. Advancing and retreating in harmony means banishing the evil and preserving sincerity, holding the center and using discretion; neither great nor small is harmed; both circles are complete; each obtains harmony; no loss to others, benefit to oneself. Nature and emotion emit truth; yin and yang mix and form; this is proven in the way of sun and moon’s union and token passage.

Guan-guan cry the ospreys, on the islet in the river; a graceful and virtuous maiden, the gentleman’s good match. The male does not dwell alone; the female does not live solitary. The Black Tortoise and coiled serpent, tadpoles supporting each other, illustrate the female and male, meaning they must mutually depend. Suppose two women share a chamber, both fair in color; even if Su Qin speaks and Zhang Yi acts as matchmaker, deploying eloquent tongues, flourishing beautiful words, pushing hearts to harmony, making them husband and wife, with disheveled hair and rotten teeth, they will never truly know each other. If medicines are not of the same seed, different in name and kind, divided and measured unevenly, losing their order and principle—even if the Yellow Emperor stands at the furnace, Taiyi holds the fire, the Eight Masters cast and refine, Huainan blends and harmonizes, erecting the cosmos and lofty altar, jade for steps and terraces, qilin meat and phoenix fat, holding records and kneeling long, praying and offering to the gods, beseeching the ghosts, bathing and fasting, hoping for results—this is like patching a pot with glue, applying clay to a sore, removing cold by adding ice, removing heat by using broth, flying tortoise and dancing serpent—only seeing greater discord.

Divided and measured unevenly: originally divided doses

The previous section said yin and yang must correspond, advancing and retreating in harmony, only then can cultivation be successful. This section speaks of solitary yin and scant yang, all the evils of non-correspondence, to awaken people to correct their errors and return to the right path. The Book of Changes says: “One yin and one yang is called the Dao.” For with yin and yang, their union is called the Dao. Solitary yin and scant yang, yin and yang each biased, is not called the Dao. Therefore, the sage declared and pruned the poems, placing the chapter of Guan-ju first, to show the gentleman’s way begins with husband and wife. The way of husband and wife is the way of yin and yang’s creation. All things in Heaven and Earth, with or without feeling, the female all belong to yin, as females and wives; the male all belong to yang, as males and husbands. One female and one male, one wife and one husband, one yin and one yang, mutually depend, thus creation occurs. In humans, male and female cohabit and reproduce; in things, tortoise and serpent coil and twist, bearing seed. Taking these two as example, the principle of female and male mutual dependence, female and male union, can be analogized and known. Suppose two women share a chamber, both very fair, becoming husband and wife—how could they know each other and reproduce? This principle is clear and evident. In the world, blind cultivators do not know the principle of yin and yang’s union, the way female and male must depend; abandoning their own true yin and true yang, nature and life root, they seek outside themselves things of different kind. Some flow and become wild herbs; some mistakenly think of furnace fire; some erect altars and worship the Dipper and the True; some fast and beseech ghosts, hoping for longevity and immortality—this is like patching a pot with glue, applying clay to a sore, removing cold by adding ice, removing heat by using broth. It is like flying tortoise and dancing serpent; how could tortoise fly or serpent dance? Does it not only show greater discord? The Immortal Elder in this section first raises Guan-ju, tortoise and serpent, the principle of female and male mutual dependence; then, with different kinds not matching, opens the eyes of later students—this is utmost compassion. All blind ones can thus awaken.

The highest virtue is non-action, not seeking through scrutiny. The lower virtue acts, its use unceasing. Know the white and keep the black, and the spirit-brightness comes naturally. White is the metal essence; black is the water base. Water is the pivot of the Dao, removing numbers and names. The beginning of yin and yang, mysteriously containing the yellow sprout. The lord of the five metals, the northern river chariot. Therefore lead is black outside, harboring golden splendor inside; clad in coarse clothes but harboring jade, outside a madman. Metal is the mother of water; the mother hides the child in the womb. Water is the child of metal; the child hides the mother in the womb. The true person is most subtle, seeming to be and not to be. Like the great abyss, sometimes sinking, sometimes floating. Retreating and dispersing, each guards its corner. Picking the white kind, making it vermilion. Refining it as outer guard, the true abode within the white. Square and round, one inch in diameter, mixed and mutually bound. Born before Heaven and Earth, lofty and exalted. Around it are walls and gates, shaped like the Penghu Isles. Encircled and closed, four ways accessible and hesitant. Guarded tightly, blocking treachery and evil. Winding chambers interconnect, to guard against the unexpected. One may have no thought, but not be troubled or weary. Spirit and breath fill the chamber, none can remain. Those who guard it prosper; those who lose it perish. Movement, stillness, rest, and activity always accompany the person.

Golden splendor: originally yellow splendor. Mutually bound: originally mutually supporting. Winding chamber: originally winding gate.

The previous section said cultivation must seek like-kind sentient things to succeed. If not of the same kind, success is impossible. But cultivation has two methods: one is to complete the matter of the Dao; the other is to extend life by technique. The highest virtue completes the form by the Dao, embracing the primordial and guarding the unity, practicing the way of non-action, and thus finishing the matter. Hence it says: highest virtue is non-action, not seeking through scrutiny. The lower virtue extends life by technique, striving and stabilizing, practicing the way of doing, thus able to return to the origin. Hence it says: lower virtue acts, its use unceasing. The reason highest virtue does not seek is that such a person’s primordial nature is uninjured, the guest breath has not entered. If one suddenly awakens to one’s original nature, no cultivation or proof is needed, directly transcending the farther shore; the work of seeking is useless. The reason lower virtue’s use is unceasing is that its primordial nature is already damaged, knowledge opened; though one can suddenly awaken to one’s nature, one cannot completely tame and conform; one must use the gradual path of cultivation, the work of addition and subtraction. Add and add again, subtract and subtract again, until nothing more can be added or subtracted. When righteousness is refined and benevolence ripened, one reaches rest; this is the preciousness of unceasing use. Highest and lower virtue differ in status, so their uses differ. When the lower virtue reaches refined righteousness and benevolence, it also returns to the same path as highest virtue. Called sometimes acting at ease, sometimes acting for benefit, sometimes acting with effort, until success is achieved. To clarify the meaning of lower virtue’s unceasing use: unceasing use is the way of returning from the later to the primordial. Returning from later to primordial means knowing the white and guarding the black. White is the bright and pure Dao heart; black is the dark and obscure human heart. Knowing the white means the Dao heart is real; guarding the black means the human heart is empty. The Dao heart is real, so true knowledge always remains; the human heart is empty, so spiritual knowledge is not correct. True knowledge and spiritual knowledge combine as one; firmness and gentleness match. Within is indistinct form, in the dark is essence, and spirit-brightness comes naturally. Spirit-brightness is the breath of primordial true unity, also called the essence of primordial true unity, also called the Valley Spirit. The Valley Spirit is the spirit of the mixture of yin and yang breaths. When yin and yang scatter, this spirit is dark; its body black and losing brightness, like spirit-brightness gone. When yin and yang unite, this spirit is bright; its body white and regaining brightness, like spirit-brightness come. Hence it says: know the white and guard the black, spirit-brightness comes naturally. What is white as metal essence, black as water base? The true knowledge possessed by the Dao heart is true emotion, its virtue originally firm and strong, belonging to the family of Heaven (Qian), symbolized as metal essence. The spiritual knowledge contained in the human heart is true nature, its virtue originally gentle and compliant, belonging to the family of Earth (Kun), symbolized as water base. Spiritual knowledge originally does not belong to water but to fire; because spiritual knowledge is contained in the human heart, if it guards the black of the human heart, then the human heart becomes extremely empty, still, and sincere. Spiritual knowledge is gentle and compliant; evil fire is extinguished; connected with true knowledge in the indistinct; changing in the dark; harmonious breath steams and produces the true unity’s water. This black is the base of water. Water is born of Heaven One, the pivot of the Dao, lord of the five metals, root of yin and yang, containing the yellow sprout, having the correct breath of the northern river chariot. How is this known? The human heart’s spiritual knowledge is empty and still; guest breath does not come. The Dao heart’s true knowledge appears; life breath returns again, like grass and trees sprouting in the earth, their color yellow and tender, their nature pure water; thus called yellow sprout. Because its yang breath rises by water, it is also called river chariot; because its yang breath is born from yin, it is also called spirit-brightness. In fact, yellow sprout, river chariot, spirit-brightness all describe the Dao heart’s true knowledge, a point of firm and correct breath. It resembles black lead, black outside and white inside, harboring golden splendor, like a madman clad in coarse clothes but harboring jade. People from primordial unite with later, false emotions give rise to desire water; metal is the mother of water. Returning from later to primordial, black contains white; the one essence water again produces the true knowledge’s true emotion, and the mother hides in the child’s womb; this water again produces metal. The one essence water, borrowing true emotion to produce, water is the child of metal; primordial operates the later true emotion’s metal, producing the one essence water; the child again hides the mother’s womb; metal again produces water. Metal produces water by following its desire, thus enticing the other’s pleasure, later serving Heaven’s time. Water produces metal by reversing the mechanism, thus strengthening our life treasure, primordial and not violating Heaven. Metal and water mutually produce, using both following and opposing, neither harming the other, and the true person is born among them. The true person is the spirit-brightness above, also called the sacred embryo, the breath of primordial emptiness and true unity condensed into form. This true person is most divine and subtle, neither form nor emptiness, both form and emptiness. Sometimes sinking, silent and unmoving; sometimes floating, sensing and thus communicating. Form and emptiness unrestrained, movement and stillness natural; utmost void containing utmost being, utmost emptiness containing utmost substance; the breaths of yin-yang and Five Phases all present. Hence it says: retreating and dispersing, each guards its corner. When the sacred embryo condenses, the true person has form; five origins and five virtues, mixed as one breath; five things and five thieves, each guards its corner. Not only can they not harm the Dao, but they assist the Dao. Picking the white kind, first a void chamber produces white—the sacred embryo condenses. Making it vermilion means fire refines metal; the sacred embryo is solid. Refining it as outer guard means the outer elixir is complete. The true abode within the white means the inner elixir is bright and full. Square and round, one inch in diameter, outer round and inner square, yet inner and outer one breath. Mixed and mutually bound means spirit condensed, breath gathered, spirit and breath mixed; inner and outer as one. Spirit and breath mixed, one spiritual subtlety, the Dharma realm is perfect and smooth. Born before Heaven and Earth, lofty and exalted; creation cannot bind it, all things cannot bend it; entering true emptiness without obstruction, perfectly united in one. Hence it is said: shaped like the Penghu Isles. At this stage, round and full, shining brightly, good knowing and good ability, again seeing the mother who gave birth, the original face. When the origin is in hand, one must guard against danger and risk, firmly secure and seal, called “around it are walls and gates.” Encircled and closed, four ways accessible and hesitant, to guard against external harm, so outside things do not enter. Guarded tightly, blocking treachery and evil, so internal thieves and thoughts do not escape. Winding chambers interconnect, to caution against the unexpected, cautious of what is unseen, fearful of what is unheard. Nothing hidden is not illuminated; no subtlety not entered; like winding chambers interconnected, light and dark as one, not allowing even a trace of evil breath to remain in the one-inch square. One may have no thought, but not be troubled or weary; using use within non-use, applying effort within effortless, not with worry or forced exertion. Only no thought and no action, focusing the one and holding the center. The above warnings and instructions are for those who wish to learn, to be cautious at all times, allowing no slackness, lest they bring calamity upon themselves. For when the sacred embryo condenses and spirit and breath are full, yang reaches its peak and must turn to yin, easy to cause disaster. Guarding it, the ten-month fetus matures, the elixir’s heat flourishes; losing it, in an instant breath withdraws, spirit flies and perishes. Therefore the sages at this point let the fire rest and the wheel stop. Using the way of the yin token, firm aids gentle, one movement and one stillness, one rest and one breath, always with the Dao. Abandoning doing to enter non-doing, completing life then completing nature, applying effort at the stage of birth in the body. This is the lower virtue acting; its use unceasing, from effort returning to the way of nature. Upon reaching the natural place, it is the same matter as highest virtue. The above spoke of life’s principle; below speaks of nature’s principle; students should apply their attention.

Within, nourish oneself, peaceful, quiet, void. The origin is hidden and bright, illuminating the form. Close and block its exchange, build and solidify the spiritual root. The three lights sink and rise, warming and nourishing the child pearl. See it not, yet near and easy to seek. Diligently practice it, day and night without rest. Conceal food for three years, lightly rise and travel far. Cross fire without burning, enter water without wetting. Able to exist and vanish, long joy without worry. Dao completed, virtue accomplished, hidden and waiting for the time. Taiyi then summons, moving to the central continent. When功 (merit) is full, ascending, receiving the talisman and chart.

The way of cultivating truth requires both nature and life to be cultivated;功 (practice) must be in two stages. Outer medicine is to complete life; inner medicine is to complete nature. Outer medicine seizes creation to restore the primordial; inner medicine preserves the original true to transform the later. Primordial is to escape the illusory body; later is to escape the Dharma body. The world’s deluded do not know the sages’ subtle teachings, mistakenly thinking outer medicine is furnace fire, inner medicine is solitary cultivation. They do not know primordial true yang comes from void and non-being, belonging to the other; thus called outer medicine. Once primordial comes, returning to root and life, it belongs to oneself; thus called inner medicine. The distinction of inner and outer, nature and life, both arise together but have different names, both called origin of origins. The chapter begins with “within to nourish oneself,” thus the principles of inner and outer are clear. This accords with the chapter’s beginning: “If one intends to nourish nature, one must first extend life and delay the appointed time.” Oneself means nature. When the Golden Elixir is accomplished and life foundation solid, one urgently cultivates nature to escape the Dharma body. The way to cultivate nature is the technique of refining spirit and returning to void. Hence this section directly says: “Within, nourish oneself, peaceful, quiet, void.” The way to nourish nature requires settling the body in void, quieting the mind in non-being, forgetting both body and mind, hoping to reach the realm where form and spirit are both subtle and united with the Dao in truth. The origin hidden and bright, illuminating the form, means concealing brightness and nourishing obscurity, truly holding the center. Closing and blocking its exchange, building and solidifying the spiritual root, means cherishing breath and nourishing spirit, only essence and only one. The three lights sinking and rising, warming and nourishing the child pearl, means the essence, breath, and spirit, the three treasures of essence, all gathered within, guarding the elixir source, never leaving for a moment. The original hidden spirit root and child pearl are all other names for the sacred embryo. The sacred embryo has breath but no substance; hence it is said: see it not. Though unseen, it is near the body, close to the heart and chest, unknown to others but known to oneself. One must continuously maintain it, never forget or assist, working diligently day and night without rest. When the ten-month elixir ripens and all the yin are stripped away, the time to escape and transform arrives; outside the body there is a body. Adding three years of nursing功 (practice), concealing breath to strengthen spirit, nourishing the time to solidify form, then coming and going is free; lightly rising and traveling far; crossing fire without burning; entering water without wetting. Gathering forms and existing; dispersing transforms to breath and vanishes. No calamity or difficulty; long joy without worry. At this stage, Dao is completed, virtue accomplished. Taiyi then summons, moving to the central continent, the blessed land of grotto heavens, sharing Heaven’s blessings with the multitude of true ones. Returning to the dusty world, accumulating功 (merit) and accumulating行 (practice), when three thousand功 (merits) are full and eight hundred行 (practices) complete, the Jade Emperor issues the decree; the Purple Mansion receives office; the great man’s great deed is done.
