# The Scripture of the Kinship of the Three (Lower Section with Fushi Commentary)

Long ago, the sages and worthies, embracing the mysterious and holding fast to the true, concealed and refined the Nine Cauldrons, their traces hidden and submerged. They contained the essence and nurtured the spirit, harmonizing the virtue of the Three Luminaries. Their fluids and tissues, sinews and bones, were made firm and strong; all evil influences were repelled, and the righteous qi endured long. Through accumulation and perseverance, their forms transformed, and they became immortals.

Moved by compassion for later generations, the noble seekers of the dao followed the fashions of the times, pointing to and illustrating ancient writings, composing charts and books to enlighten those yet unborn. They revealed the branches and twigs but concealed the root and source, entrusting their teachings to various names, covering up the myriad errors of texts. Scholars who obtained these works hid them away like treasured caskets for life.

Sons inherited their fathers’ work, grandsons followed their ancestors, but the transmission of the world’s confusion left them without understanding or insight. Thus eunuchs ceased to serve, farmers abandoned their hoes, merchants forsook their goods, and the aspiring were left impoverished. I am deeply grieved by this and have resolved to record this text, words concise and easy to ponder, matters simplified and not cumbersome. I lay out its sections, verify its truths, divide it into two parts with clear numbers, and let them follow one another. Hence it is a tangled discourse; pierce its gateways, wise ones carefully consider, and with intent contemplate it.

**With Intent Contemplate:** A text to be contemplated with intent.

The dao of nature and life, those who grasp its truth diligently practice it and see immediate results. Since ancient times, those who have attained the dao have never been few. The immortals’ records say: “Eight hundred have uprooted their homes; three thousand have ascended on the wind; some shed their bodies and vanish on the spot; the small achievements are countless.” Those who uprooted their homes were like the Yellow Emperor, like Xu Zuyang, like Master Zhang the Celestial Master. Those who ascended on the wind were like the Old Man of True Yang, like Immortal Ge, like Duke He of the River, like Old Master Pure Yang. All these sages and worthies refined the Seven Returns and Nine Reversions, forming the Great Golden Elixir of the Golden Fluid. To abandon this dao and hope to become true is utterly unreasonable.

The dao of the Golden Elixir is the way of embracing the mysterious and holding the true, the way of concealed refinement of the Nine Cauldrons. The mysterious is the spirit’s wondrous and unfathomable qi, endlessly transforming. The true is utmost goodness without evil, a whole primordial benevolence—this is principle. Qi belongs to life, principle belongs to nature. To embrace the mysterious is to establish life; to hold the true is to exhaust one’s nature. Concealment is to subdue the qi, to nourish the vast righteous qi, for life is self-created. Refinement is to refine the true, to complete the original heavenly truth, so that nature is not obscured.

Nine is the number of pure yang without yin. Since ancient times, sages have embraced the mysterious and held the true, subdued and refined, returning to pure yang without yin, becoming adamantine and indestructible—this is called the concealed refinement of the Nine Cauldrons. It is not the later-world’s Nine Cauldrons of furnace fire and ingestion, nor the heretical teaching of the Nine Cauldrons of the imperial lady’s elixir chamber. If it were furnace fire and elixir chamber, how could one speak of embracing the mysterious and holding the true?

In former times, the Yellow Emperor refined the Nine Cauldrons at Tai Lake, riding dragons to ascend the heavenly court. Tai Lake is the Kan Dragon, the Dry Yang; it takes the yang within Kan to fill the yin within Li, returning to the Dry body, returning to pure yang. How then could the Nine Cauldrons be the nine tangible cauldrons? Only this concealed refinement of the Nine Cauldrons’ dao is great wisdom seeming foolish, great skill seeming clumsy, hidden and submerged afar, veiling brightness and nurturing obscurity, containing and storing the spirit. Silently operating divine power, it secretly steals the authority of creation, pilfers the qi of yin and yang.

The *Book of Changes* says: “One unites with Heaven and Earth in virtue, with Moon and Sun in brightness, with the Four Seasons in order, and with ghosts and spirits in fortune and misfortune.” Only by such union can one harmonize the virtue of the Three Luminaries. Heaven’s gate is in the hand, Earth’s axis in the heart. Using this to preserve essence, the essence becomes pure; and the fluids and tissues, sinews and bones, are nourished. Repelling all evil is to retreat yin; the constant presence of righteous qi is to advance yang. Advancing yang and retreating yin, adding effort and concealed refinement, over time yin is exhausted and yang is pure; form transforms into qi, qi transforms into spirit, spirit transforms into emptiness. Outside the body is a body; one sheds feathers and ascends as an immortal.

After perfecting oneself, one returns to perfect all beings. Compassionate for later generations, the noble seekers of the dao, wandering into side paths, ignorant of the true dao, thus point to and illustrate ancient writings, compose charts and books, open the ears of the deaf and mute of ten thousand generations, build the steps of a hundred ages. Yet their meaning is profound and obscure, cautiously revealing only branches and twigs. As for the root and source, fearing to leak Heaven’s secret, they dare not speak it plainly, so they hide it. This hiding is not silence, but concealment beyond words, embedded within meaning.

Later generations, not knowing the ancient subtle intent, entrust it to various true names, recklessly composing and annotating, corrupting ancient texts and misleading later learners. Like the *Yinfu Tianzhen Huangren*’s discourse at the Southern Flower Gate, or the *Yukou Yuqing Jinxi Lu*, all are later people invoking ancient names, fabricating and composing falsely. Later scholars, unable to discern truth from falsehood, when encountering such erroneous texts, hide them away like treasured caskets for life. Fathers pass to sons, sons to grandsons, passing confusion to confusion, blindness leading blindness, until eunuchs cease to serve, farmers abandon their hoes, merchants and aspirants all forsake their crafts, and none succeed.

The Immortal Elder, moved by compassion, composed the *Kinship of the Three*, words concise and easy to enter by thought, matters simplified and practice not burdensome, laying out its sections and verifying their truth. Within, the fire’s timing and measures, the medicines’ weights and quantities, all are detailed and complete. Truly it pries open Heaven’s root and drills into the cave of principle, worthy to be the eyes and gateways of life and nature for ten thousand people in the world. Those with aspiration, seeing it, should carefully consider and thoroughly contemplate; in time, the clues will reveal themselves.

Alas, later generations sometimes mistake it for a book of divination by the *Na Jia*, or guess it concerns furnace fire, or take it as proof of the imperial lady’s elixir chamber. This is why Confucius could only weep for the qilin, and Bian He could only shed tears for jade; even the Immortal Elder could do nothing about it.

The Lady of the River Above, numinous and most divine, when she obtains fire, flies away, unseen by dust or smoke; ghosts hide and dragons conceal themselves, none know where she dwells. To subdue her, the Yellow Sprout is the root. Things without yin and yang go against Heaven and oppose the primordial; a hen lays eggs herself, but her chicks are incomplete. Why so? Because the matching is not joined, the three and five do not meet, firmness and softness are separated. The essence of transformation, Heaven and Earth’s natural way, fire moves and blazes upward, water flows and moistens downward. Without a master to guide, it cannot be so. The source of order and correctness cannot be altered.

Consider male and female: at the time of coupling, firmness and softness join and cannot be undone. To obtain the proper rhythm and sign, one must have skill and craft to control it. The male is born and subdued; the female reclines her body, holding the embryo and receiving the original qi. It is not merely at birth that this appears; at death, it also follows. This is not from parents, but from the teaching and command. It is originally fixed at coupling, established before all else.

---

**Firmness and softness join:** A text of mutual entanglement.

The previous section said that since ancient times sages embraced the mysterious and held the true, thereby attaining the dao. To embrace the mysterious and hold the true is the way of matching firmness and softness, the dao of yin and yang mixed. The Lady of the River Above is the yin within Li, the spiritual knowing of the human heart. The human heart has the recognizing spirit; the recognizing spirit flows with nature and is unstable, borrowing the spirit to create delusion, like the Lady of the River Above running wild, hence symbolized by her.

Because this Lady’s nature is wandering and drifting, seeing scenes stirs feelings, thus she is numinous. Because she is numinous, she follows the wind and raises waves, thus she is spirit. This is the clear, luminous recognizing spirit. This spirit delights in movement and dislikes stillness; when the heart’s fire slightly rises, it soars and flies, like ghosts hiding and dragons concealing, with no shadow or trace, none know where it dwells.

To subdue her, the Yellow Sprout is the root. The Yellow Sprout is the yang within Kan; in humans, it is the true knowledge of the Dao-heart. True knowledge has true feeling; true feeling contains true intent. This is a single point of life force, also called the Yellow Sprout. True intent belongs to earth; when true earth appears, yang’s vital energy returns, like the Yellow Sprout growing from the earth, growing gradually from the root.

The flowing nature of spiritual knowing belongs to yin; the true intent of true knowledge belongs to yang. Using true intent to control the flowing nature is like a staff stabilizing; the recognizing spirit cannot arise, the human heart cannot stir, and spiritual knowing returns to true knowledge. Not only does spiritual knowing cease to fly, but it also nourishes true knowledge. True knowledge and spiritual knowing, two become one; yin and yang correspond, life force never ceases.

The *Book of Changes* says: “One yin and one yang is called the dao.” If things lack yin and yang, they go against Heaven and oppose the primordial; a hen lays eggs herself, but her chicks are incomplete. This is precisely because the matching is not joined, the Five Phases do not interact, firmness and softness are separated. Without the one yin and one yang of Heaven and Earth, the natural way of transformation and creation cannot produce offspring.

Yang acts, yin transforms; their essence flows freely—this is the natural way and can give birth to all things. Like fire’s nature blazing upward, water flowing downward, without a master’s guidance, relying on the original beginning; male and female coupling, firmness and softness joining, not by craft but by the same kind.

Also, the male is born and subdued; the female reclines her body. It is not merely seen at birth but also at death. Without the parents’ teaching and command, it is originally fixed at coupling, established before all else. All these are the responses of yin and yang qi; they come about without anyone causing them, arrive without anyone directing them.

Cultivators who abandon the dao of yin and yang find that solitary yin cannot generate life, solitary yang cannot grow; they go against Heaven and oppose the primordial, life force is extinguished. How then can they preserve life? How can they perfect the corners? Therefore, true knowledge and spiritual knowing, yin and yang joined, can accomplish affairs.

The flowing pearl of the sun always desires to leave people. At last, it attains the Golden Flower, turning and mutually depending, transforming into white fluid, condensing until firm. The Golden Flower sings first; in a moment it dissolves into water, like horse’s teeth and coral, then the yang harmonizes, and nature’s feelings arise spontaneously.

When yin presses and constrains, it restrains and guards the gate; the kind mother nourishes, the filial son repays grace, the stern father issues commands, instructing descendants. The Five Phases err and reign, mutually opposing to generate. Fire’s nature melts metal; metal overcomes wood’s flourishing. Three and five with one: Heaven and Earth’s utmost essence, can be expressed in a mnemonic but is hard to transmit in writing.

You should turn right at the Rat; at Noon, turn eastward; the Rabbit and Rooster separate the boundary, the host and guest have two names. The dragon calls to the tiger; the tiger inhales the dragon’s essence. They drink from each other, each greedy and convenient, biting and swallowing each other. Mars guards the west; Venus crosses the sky. Where killing qi arrives, what is not overturned? The raccoon dog guards the mouse; the sparrow fears the hawk. Each has its role; who dares to make a sound?

Without understanding the principle, it is hard to speak recklessly. Exhausting family wealth, wives and children hungry and poor, from ancient times to now, countless seekers, proud of their cleverness, do not seek true masters or mnemonics, widely seeking famous medicines, mistaking false for true, the more they seek, the farther they stray, diverging from the dao, never once succeeding. Can one not lament this?

**Erroneous reign:** A text variant “erroneous and prosperous.”

The previous section said the Lady of the River Above obtains the Yellow Sprout to be subdued. This section clarifies the timing of subduing the fire. The flowing nature of spiritual knowing possessed by humans comes and goes without fixed time, unknown in its dwelling, disturbing the mind’s thoughts, consuming spirit, harming life.

Like the sun’s flowing pearl, it never stops. Yet if it obtains the Golden Flower of the Dao-heart’s true knowledge to match it, then spiritual knowing is subdued by true knowledge, turning and mutually depending; spirit returns to truth, seeking nature through feeling, feeling returning to nature, transforming into white fluid, one qi mixed, condensing until firm.

True knowledge and spiritual knowing condensed, yin and yang joined, harmonious qi steaming, the Golden Flower of true knowledge, in an instant, firmness changes to softness, dissolving into the true one water. Vaguely something exists, faintly a spirit, like horse’s teeth and coral. Horse’s teeth compare to its hardness and whiteness; coral to its gentleness and softness. The Golden Flower transforms to water, as above said, transforming into white fluid; horse’s teeth and coral, as above said, condense until firm.

The Golden Flower of true knowledge, having transformed into true one water, is white, tender, and firm. The spiritual knowing, the sun’s flowing pearl, transforms into the void spirit fire, then harmonizes. The Golden Flower sings first—true feeling is not obscured. Yang harmonizes later—true nature is not confused. Feeling not obscured, nature not confused; fire does not blaze upward, water does not flow downward; water and fire mutually assist; nature and feeling are peaceful, returning to unknowing and unawareness, following the emperor’s law and nature’s domain.

Nature and feeling natural, only then condensing until firm. Yet there remains the afterborn yin qi of the body, which must be transformed away to complete the great dao. Pressing and constraining yin is to remove evil qi, always cautious. Restraining and guarding the gate is to protect righteous qi, never leaving it for a moment.

The gate is the original yin’s gate, the gate of birth and door of death, the dwelling of life and death, the aperture of yin and yang. I am born there, I die there; conception is there, rebirth also there. Guarding it carefully preserves life; losing it means death. It is the most urgent and crucial checkpoint, thus called the restraining gate.

Everyone passes through this gate, coming and going, but common folk use it daily without knowing. If one asks the gate’s form, I say: below Heaven, above Earth, west of the sun, east of the moon; at a crossroads, among four meeting places, brightly open a single aperture, from afar as fine as a hair, close as vast as the world. Within it myriad phenomena are arrayed, all treasures complete, Heaven-made and Earth-set possessions. Whether anyone recognizes it or not is unknown.

If someone does recognize it, then pressing and constraining evil yin returns it to origin at the place of death; restraining and storing righteous yang returns it to primordial at the place of birth. One may freely operate it, left or right, all fitting well. But the way of returning to origin and root is always to harmonize nature and feeling, mixing yin and yang’s principle.

To harmonize nature and feeling, one must first distinguish the dao of the Five Phases’ generation and overcoming. Metal generates water; metal is the water’s mother, water is metal’s child. Wood generates fire; wood is fire’s father, fire is wood’s child. Metal generates water; water can also generate metal—this is called the kind mother nourishing and the filial son repaying. Wood generates fire; fire generates wood—this is the stern father issuing commands, instructing descendants.

Metal generates water, wood generates fire—these are the natural generations. Water generates metal, fire generates wood—these are the reverse generations. Also, the Five Phases err and reign, mutually opposing to generate. For example, fire’s nature can melt metal; metal is overcome by fire and gains color and strength, able to generate flourishing. Metal’s nature can cut wood; wood is overcome by metal and becomes tools, able to generate prosperity.

Three and five with one: metal generates water at one five; wood generates fire at one five; earth dwells in the center as one five. One is one qi. The Five Phases generate and overcome; overcoming completes generation, generation completes overcoming; generation and overcoming follow time; one qi flows, beginning and ending, ending and beginning, spirit transforms unfathomably.

In Heaven and Earth, this is utmost essence; in the Way of the Elixir, this is utmost treasure. Within this, the secret of natural generation and overcoming, with fire timing, with craft, with sequence, with urgency and slackness, differs by a hair’s breadth and misses by a thousand miles. Why is it hard to transmit in writing? Because the secret of natural generation and overcoming, with fire timing and craft, with sequence and pace, is too subtle for words. Writing does not fail to transmit fire timing; nor fail to transmit craft; but speech cannot fully express it, discourse cannot exhaust it.

The Immortal Elder, with a mother’s heart, though saying it is hard to transmit in writing, still must transmit it by writing, so that later learners may exhaust the text to probe principle, seek masters to verify. What is transmitted by writing? It is the transmission of fire timing and craft.

At the Rat, the head of six yang, is the time of one yang’s return. At the Rat, turn from left to right until the Snake; six yang complete. This is the advancing yang fire, practicing the way of firmness. Noon is the head of six yin, the time of one yin’s coupling. At Noon, turn from west to east until the Pig; six yin pure. This is the operation of the yin talisman, practicing the way of softness.

Rabbit and Rooster are the gate of yin and yang’s coming and going. Rabbit is wood, in the east, the host, governing life qi. Rooster is metal, in the west, the guest, governing killing qi. Wood’s nature is soft, symbolized by the dragon. Metal’s nature is firm, symbolized by the tiger. There is killing and life, host and guest; life and killing both used; host and guest balanced; nature and feeling one qi.

Like the dragon calling to the tiger, the tiger inhales the dragon’s essence; both drink from each other, both greedy and fond, biting, swallowing, chewing, naturally forming the elixir. For example, Mars is the Fire Star, suited to the south; if guarding the west, fire leaves and overcomes metal. Venus is the Metal Star, suited to night travel; if crossing the sky in daylight, yin invades its yang. Both reverse their usual places, bringing killing qi, surely causing ruinous disasters.

Also, the raccoon dog guards the mouse, surely catching it; the hawk seizes the sparrow, surely succeeding. From these matters we see: if yin and yang are out of time, ruin follows; if yin and yang are correct, success follows.

All the above is what the text transmits. Cultivators merely play with the images they take, not grasping the hidden principle, recklessly guessing and privately arguing, mistaking five metals and eight stones, falling into furnace fire, burning lead and refining mercury, exhausting family wealth, wives and children starving and cold.

From ancient times to now, countless scholars, proud of their cleverness, do not seek bright masters or mnemonics, widely seek famous medicines, taking false for true, the more they seek, the farther they stray, diverging from the dao, never once succeeding. Can one not sigh?

Cinnabar is wood’s essence; when combined with metal, metal and water meet; wood and fire are companions. The four, in chaos, are arranged as dragon and tiger. Dragon’s yang number is odd; tiger’s yin number is even. Liver green is father; lung white is mother; kidney black is son; heart red is daughter; spleen yellow is ancestor; the cycle begins at Rat and Horse. The three things are one family, all belonging to Wu and Ji.

The previous two sections spoke of the Lady of the River Above, the Yellow Sprout, the flowing pearl, and the Golden Flower—all about clarifying the skill of harmonizing yin and yang. The skill of harmonizing yin and yang is the skill of gathering the Five Phases.

Thus this section speaks of gathering the Five Phases, clarifying the subtle use of harmonizing yin and yang. Cinnabar symbolizes fire, in humans the spirit of spiritual knowing, also the Lady’s flowing pearl’s other name. Wood’s nature is softness, in humans the softness of spiritual knowing; metal’s feeling is firmness, in humans the firmness of true knowledge, the same as the Yellow Sprout and Golden Flower above.

The nature of spiritual knowing comes from the soft spirit, thus it is wood’s essence. Because its nature is soft and less decisive, the human heart’s recognizing spirit borrows the spirit to create delusion, so within truth there is falsehood. Yet if true knowledge’s adamantine firmness controls it, the recognizing spirit cannot act, the human heart is peaceful, spiritual knowing returns to its root.

From fire is born wood. Nature loves metal’s order; metal’s feeling loves wood’s kindness; metal and wood combine. Spiritual knowing is the innate spiritual qi; true knowledge is the innate righteous qi. This spirit and truth were originally one; spirit is true, truth is spirit; true emptiness and wondrous use—this is the so-called one point of true spirit.

Because of mingling with afterborn, the recognizing spirit acts; spirit is confused, truth enters falsehood, they separate; qi and nature arise, delusions arise, the whole body is pure yin.

The recognizing spirit is the seed of kalpas and reincarnation, the root of birth and death. If this one thing is not eliminated, life and nature are never truly ours. The method of elimination is none other than true knowledge’s true feeling.

True knowledge’s feeling possesses the innate true one qi. This qi is utmost great and firm, able to repel myriad demons and sever the three corpses. When true feeling appears, the recognizing spirit gradually fades; the recognizing spirit fades, the human heart does not arise; the human heart does not arise, spiritual knowing does not fly; spiritual knowing does not fly, true nature appears.

True nature appears and meets true feeling, merging into one—this is called the joining of metal and wood. When metal and wood join, metal contains true water, in humans true essence. True essence and true feeling unite as one family—this is called the meeting of metal and water. Wood contains fire, in humans the primordial spirit. Primordial spirit and true nature unite as one family—this is called wood and fire as companions.

Externally, metal and wood join; internally, water and fire assist; the four, in chaos, become one qi. Still it is the principle of one yin and one yang joining. Hence called the dragon and tiger. Dragon is wood, belonging to yang, producing number three, the odd; tiger is metal, belonging to yin, producing number four, the even.

Dragon and tiger are the symbolic forms of nature and feeling. Though nature, feeling, and spirit divide into four images, in truth one feeling and one nature govern all. When nature and feeling join, it is always the innate one qi governing all. One qi is whole, containing four images; four images mixed remain one qi.

The dao of the Golden Elixir is returning from afterborn to innate, gathering the Five Phases, harmonizing the four images—all for harmonizing yin and yang. Yin and yang harmonized is the meeting of dragon and tiger, thus when the elixir is complete it is called the Great Elixir of Dragon and Tiger.

Like the illusory body, it also borrows yin and yang and the Five Phases to form. Liver green is wood, the father; lung white is metal, the mother; kidney black is water, the son; heart red is fire, the daughter; spleen yellow is earth, the ancestor.

The illusory body of afterborn cannot form without the Five Phases; the true body of innate cannot condense without the Five Phases. The difference is in reversal and sequence. In sequence, life gives birth to living things; in reversal, one becomes sage and immortal.

What is sequence? Liver wood stores the soul, nature floating and governing joy; heart fire stores the spirit, nature blazing and governing delight; kidney water stores essence, nature flowing and governing sorrow; lung metal stores the corporeal soul, nature sinking and governing anger; spleen earth stores intention, nature sluggish and governing desire—all belonging to afterborn.

What is reversal? Wood’s nature floats and is made to sink, wood returns to root, joy transforms to benevolence; metal’s nature sinks and is made to float, metal returns to origin, anger transforms to righteousness; water’s nature descends and is made to ascend, water returns to source, sorrow transforms to wisdom; fire’s nature ascends and is made to descend, fire returns to truth, delight transforms to ritual; earth’s nature is sluggish and is made harmonious, earth returns to yang, desire transforms to faith—all belonging to innate.

The perfected person cultivates the innate, transforms the afterborn, reverses the operation to seize creation’s authority, turning the handle of life and death. The subtlety lies in restraining yin and supporting yang, using six without being used by six, using nine without being used by nine.

Nine is the number of yang; six is the number of yin. One yang is born as the Rat; one yin is born as Noon. Rat and Noon are the beginning of yin and yang. One yang is born and advances yang fire, with water and wood residing therein; one yin is born and operates the yin talisman, with fire and metal residing therein.

Advancing yang and operating yin, each follows its time, within which there is faithfulness. Earth dwells in the center, mixing all spirits; the work belongs to Wu and Ji. Wu harmonizes yang, governing external movement; Ji harmonizes yin, governing internal nurturing. Wu and Ji combine, inside and outside as one.

The two earths join as a ritual blade—this is the one family of three things. The *Four Hundred Words of the Golden Elixir* say: “Lead and mercury return to true earth; body and mind are silent and unmoving.” This is precisely it.

Metal and water belong to the body; wood and fire belong to the mind; Wu and Ji belong to intention, governing essence, qi, and spirit—the three things. Refine essence to transform qi; refine qi to transform spirit; refine spirit to return to emptiness. At this stage, body and mind are one; water has no leakage.

But the body and mind here are not the illusory flesh and heart, but the invisible body and mind. The invisible body is the original single point of vast, firm, and upright qi; the invisible mind is the original single point of void, spirit, and clarity.

Intention is not the thought of intention, but the original unmoving and unshaken Heaven—called true intention, known as true faith. Later people do not understand the ancient subtle meaning, mistaking the body for the illusory transformed body, the mind for the fleshly lump of heart, and intention for thought’s intention.

Those who cling to the heart enter the study of extinction; those who recognize the illusory body think it is the work of transport. Alas! To take this as the dao is the wrong path, not the true path.

Those who understand the dao are the study of the innate, not falling into existence or nonexistence or form or image, having a separate secret of mind transmission and oral instruction, directly transcending the other shore, establishing and ascending to the sage’s position.

Firmness and softness alternate and rise again, further passing through distribution. Dragon west, tiger east, establishing the warp at Rabbit and Rooster, punishment and virtue both meet, seeing each other with joy. Punishment governs subduing and killing; virtue governs birth and rising.

In the second month, elm leaves fall, the Chief Star arrives at Rabbit; in the eighth month, wheat grows, the Heavenly Gang occupies Rooster. Rat is south, Noon is north, mutually serving as warp and weft. The number one and nine end and begin again. Containing primordial void and precariousness, scattering essence at Rat.

The previous section spoke of gathering the Five Phases, the skill of yin and yang united. This section speaks of the subtle use of yin and yang united. The dao of the Golden Elixir is the way of firmness and softness joined. Within firmness is softness; within softness is firmness; firmness and softness alternate and rise again, passing through distribution, adapting and changing with time.

What is firmness and softness alternating and rising again, passing through distribution? Dragon’s nature belongs to wood, virtue; originally dwelling in the east Rabbit yang position, now reversely establishing the warp in the west Rooster yin position—this is nature seeking feeling.

Tiger’s feeling belongs to metal, punishment; originally dwelling in the west Rooster yin position, now reversely establishing the warp in the east Rabbit yang position—this is feeling returning to nature.

Seeking feeling by nature, punishment contains virtue; feeling returning to nature, virtue contains punishment. Punishment contains virtue, virtue contains punishment; punishment and virtue meet, nature and feeling see each other, firmness and softness harmonize, like husband and wife joyfully united.

Try to discuss it by the dao of Heaven and Earth’s creation: creation is virtue, transformation is punishment. Punishment governs killing, so it conceals all things; virtue governs birth, so it arises in all things. Birth is flourishing; killing is restraint. There is punishment and virtue, birth and killing; birth then killing, killing then birth; punishment then virtue, virtue then punishment; thus creation flows and never ceases.

Yet within birth is killing, within killing is birth. Like in the second month, all things grow, yet elm seeds fall; the Chief Star’s time is at Rabbit, the Gang Star’s time points to Rooster—this is killing within birth. In the eighth month, all things are harvested, yet mustard greens grow; the Gang Star at the hour of Xu points to Rooster, the Chief Star at Xu arrives at Rabbit—this is birth within killing.

The Gang Star’s place is auspicious, with life qi; the Chief Star’s place is inauspicious, with killing qi. Elm falls in the second month, wheat grows in the eighth—both are signs of punishment and virtue meeting.

Cultivators who understand this mechanism of punishment and virtue may begin their work. Rat south, Noon north, mutually serving as warp and weft: Rat belongs to water, in humans primordial essence; Noon belongs to fire, in humans primordial spirit. Rat in the south, water in fire’s place; Noon in the north, fire in water’s place. Essence is one water, overcoming primordial spirit’s fire—this is punishment, killing.

Yet water above and fire below, water and fire mutually assist; thus essence nourishes spirit, spirit protects essence; punishment contains virtue, virtue contains punishment. Punishment and virtue, yin and yang, mutually serve as warp and weft, producing innate true yang.

Yang is born from one and completed at nine; yang reaches its extreme and yin connects; yang reaches its extreme and yang arises; ending and beginning again; yin and yang both used; punishment and virtue both complete; neither harms the other, both benefit me. When they meet, nature and feeling unite; when nature and feeling unite, the Golden Elixir forms.

Yet the most crucial moment is at one yang’s return. At this time, one unites with Heaven and Earth in virtue, with Moon and Sun in brightness, with the Four Seasons in order, and with ghosts and spirits in fortune and misfortune. For at this time the innate primordial essence and primordial qi are present.

The Void and Precarious stars occupy Rat’s place, the meeting of yin and yang qi, the place where cultivators settle their bodies and establish their lives, easy to err and hard to meet. At this time, punishment and virtue should be both used: punishment to guard against yin, virtue to nurture yang.

If there is virtue without punishment, guest qi slips in, innate is harmed, great matters lost. The Immortal Elder’s phrase “scattering essence at Rat” shows the secret of using punishment and virtue together, revealing the great heavenly secret.

If one carefully examines the encounters, observes the clues, compares by category, and weighs the beginning and end of things: The Five Phases overcome each other, also being father and mother. The mother contains nourishing fluids; the father governs holding and giving; condensing essence and flowing form, metal and stone do not perish.

If one carefully specializes without leakage, one may attain the dao. Immediate results appear, echoes resound through valleys. Is it not wondrous? The utmost image of Heaven and Earth.

If one takes wild kudzu one inch, croton one tael, swallowing causes immediate stiffness, unable to bow or raise the head. At such a time, even Zhou Wen casting yarrow stalks, Confucius divining images, Bian Que wielding needles, Wu Xian beating drums—how could they revive the fallen and restore movement?

---

The above is the cultivation of the dao of the Golden Elixir, internal and external medicines, yin-yang talisman fire, all precise and detailed. But fearing that learners lack great blessings and cannot meet true masters.

If one does meet them, rejoice and seek the dao’s beginning and end, carefully examine the same kind of medicines, measure the beginning of work and the completion of the end, then one may cultivate.

For one unknown place is one place of confusion; knowing but not precise is acting but not reaching. As the saying goes, “A hair’s difference leads to a thousand-mile error.”

The Five Phases overcoming are: metal overcomes wood, wood overcomes earth, earth overcomes water, water overcomes fire, fire overcomes metal. Being father and mother: metal generates water, water generates wood, wood generates fire, fire generates earth, earth generates metal; the Five Phases generate, mutually being father and mother.

Among the Five Phases, water and wood belong to yang, the father; fire and metal belong to yin, the mother. Father governs firmness; mother governs softness. The mother contains nourishing fluids; softness completes things; father governs holding and giving; firmness produces things.

One gives birth, one completes; metal, water, wood, fire, the essence of two and five, wondrously combined and condensed, the myriad things flow and move.

Cultivators who understand the dao of the Five Phases’ generation and overcoming, the dao of yin-yang and the Five Movements, should be firm when firm, soft when soft; firmness and softness return to the center and upright; the sacred embryo condenses; the formless gives birth to form; ten months’ qi sufficient, revealing the dharma body; neither born nor extinguished, like metal and stone, indestructible.

If one knows and carefully specializes without leakage, diligently practicing without laziness, one will surely attain the dao. Like immediate results and echoes through valleys, its efficacy is swiftest.

In sum, Heaven and Earth cannot produce things without yin and yang; life and nature cannot form elixirs without yin and yang. The dao of Heaven and Earth’s creation is the utmost image of the Golden Elixir.

Later generations are confused, do not investigate true yin and true yang, stray into side paths, reaching old age without success, falsely claiming cultivation to be vanity, sages’ writings to be empty words. They have simply not pondered deeply.

Consider the wild kudzu and croton’s poison: swallowed, the body stiffens immediately. Even sages, immortals, and Buddhas find it hard to revive. How much more the Golden Elixir, the utmost treasure of the innate—could one obtain it and yet not live long and forever?

The Golden Elixir’s power to prolong life is like kudzu’s power to cause death. People do not think; their folly is great. Zi Yang wished to leave the secret to the human world but never met a single true listener. This is precisely why.
