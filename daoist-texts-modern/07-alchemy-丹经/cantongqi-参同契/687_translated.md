# Commentary on the Cantong Qi

The *Cantong Qi*—a text sparse in words yet vast in the dao it reveals, subtle in speech yet profound in its intent. It arranges the Five Emperors to establish the foundation of the world, aligns the Three Sovereigns to set governance in motion. If the distinctions between lord and subject grow confused, if above and below lose their measure, then order in governance falters, and peace remains beyond reach.

The method of Fuxi’s fasting alone cannot grant longevity. Cultivating to nourish one’s nature does not extend life’s span. Only when one dissects yin and yang, harmonizing their precise weights and measures; when one contemplates the waxing and waning of sun and moon; when the eight trigrams form their living images; when the transformations of male and female unfold; when the interplay of hardness and softness, movement and stillness, is understood; when even the division of rice and salt is discerned—then, by taking the *Book of Changes* as proof, one’s intent grows strong indeed.

Thus, this commentary is established—to pass down its wisdom to worthy successors. Only by grasping the great cosmic image can one attain true longevity. Those who strengthen themselves and enrich their bodies, who dedicate themselves to this dao, must pay it the utmost heed.
