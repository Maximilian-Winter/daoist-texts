# Annotations and Commentary on the Cantong Qi — Upper Chapter

Heaven and Earth—these are the gates of the *Yi*, the parents of all the trigrams. Kan and Li uphold and enclose, turning the wheel and straightening the axle; the four trigrams of female and male serve as the bellows and the mouthpiece. They again encompass the dao of yin and yang, especially skilled in mastery—using the measuring cord and carpenter’s square, holding the reins firmly, aligning the chariot’s yoke, following the ruts and tracks, abiding in the center to govern the outside, their numbers set in the laws of the calendar and the cycles of time.

The Way of the Golden Elixir is one with the Way of the *Yi*. The Way of the *Yi* takes Heaven and Earth as father and mother; the Way of the Elixir takes Heaven and Earth as furnace and cauldron. Only with father and mother can there be male and female. With male and female, yin and yang interpenetrate, creation unfolds within, and life endlessly springs forth. Only with furnace and cauldron can one gather the medicinal substances. With these substances, water and fire are used to boil and stew, to discard the old and renew the cauldron, returning once more to primordial truth. The *Cantong Qi* takes the four trigrams of Qian, Kun, Kan, and Li as its guiding principles, for Qian and Kun are the gates of the *Yi*, the parents of all trigrams. The *Zhou Yi* places Qian and Kun at the head of the sixty-four trigrams, thus making them the gates of the *Yi*. The sixty-four trigrams together have three hundred and eighty-four lines. All yang lines belong to Qian; all yin lines belong to Kun. Yin and yang interlace, though divided into sixty-four trigrams and three hundred and eighty-four lines, all ultimately stem from the two trigrams of Qian and Kun—one yin, one yang—the source of all transformations. Thus Qian and Kun are the parents of all trigrams. This explains the passage in the commentary on the text: “Qian is firm, Kun is soft; they pair and embrace each other. Yang receives from yin; female and male mutually depend. Only through their union does creation unfold, and essence and breath expand.” When essence and breath expand, creation moves; all sixty-four trigrams arise from this.

Kan and Li are the succeeding bodies of Qian and Kun, internally containing the just and balanced breath of yin and yang from Heaven and Earth, acting in place of Qian and Kun to carry out creation. They serve as the enclosure of the sixty-four trigrams, the surrounding boundary. The enclosure is the vast empty expanse that embraces all. The surroundings are vast and empty; nothing exists outside their scope. This is the meaning of the commentary passage: “Kan and Li crown the head, shining and spreading light. Their profound darkness is hard to fathom, impossible to depict in diagrams.”

Turning the wheel and straightening the axle—here, the axle is the chariot’s axle, the hub is the wheel’s hub. The axle carries the chariot, remaining still; the hub moves the chariot, active in motion. The *Yi* regards Qian and Kun as the essence, like the axle of a chariot; Kan and Li as the function, like the hub of the wheel. Turning the hub and straightening the axle—essence does not separate from function, function does not separate from essence.

The four trigrams of female and male are Qian, Kun, Kan, and Li. Qian is male, Kun is female; Kan is male, Li is female. The bellows have no bottom and open at both ends; things belonging to yin are female. The mouthpiece has a bottom and opens at one end; things belonging to yang are male. The bellows enclose things; the mouthpiece lets breath through. The four trigrams Qian, Kun, Kan, and Li symbolize the female as yin’s formed things; the male as yang’s living things. They again encompass the dao of yin and yang, like the bellows enclosing things and the mouthpiece passing breath. To encompass again is to unify and govern. For the *Yi*, Qian and Kun are essence; Kan and Li are function—thus overseeing the entire work of yin-yang creation. The establishment of the four trigrams Qian, Kun, Kan, and Li is like a craftsman using the measuring cord and carpenter’s square to set proper rules and standards; like a charioteer holding the reins to follow the tracks, abiding in the center to control the outside. The remaining sixty trigrams all move within the stillness and motion of these four, like the orderly sequence of the calendar and the cycles of time, naturally and spontaneously. This is the meaning of the commentary passage: “The four mix in confusion, directly entering the void. The sixty trigrams encircle, spreading out as a chariot.”

The cultivator of the dao can take firmness and softness as essence, and central balance as function; abiding in the center to govern the outside, transforming, adjusting, and moving with flexibility and without constraint. Then one’s own body has a portion of the *Yi*’s principle. The sixty-four trigrams exist within the square inch of the heart-mind, also the dao of bellows and mouthpiece yin and yang, harmonizing virtue with Heaven and Earth, brightness with sun and moon, sequence with the four seasons, auspiciousness and misfortune with ghosts and spirits. What great elixir would fail to form? What great dao would not be accomplished?

The monthly divisions have five or six days; the meridians and latitudes serve the sun’s movement, combining to form sixty; firmness and softness have interior and exterior. The new moon dawn begins the *Dun* trigram’s charge; at dusk the *Meng* trigram takes over; day and night each have one trigram, used in sequence. Before the dark wanes and the bright returns, the cycle ends and begins anew. The sun and moon mark the measure; motion and stillness have their early and late. Spring and summer follow the inner essence, from *Zi* to *Chen* and *Si*; autumn and winter apply the outer function, from *Wu* to *Xu* and *Hai*. Rewards and punishments correspond to spring and autumn; dusk and dawn follow cold and heat. The line texts contain benevolence and righteousness, issuing joy and anger according to the times. Thus they respond to the four seasons, with the Five Phases in their proper principle.

The dark waning and bright returning (one text calls it “darkness and brightness”); the sun and moon (one text calls it “sun and celestial bodies”); following their principle (one text calls it “their order”).

Above we spoke of Qian, Kun, Kan, and Li, encompassing the dao of yin and yang, their numbers set in the laws of the calendar and cycles of time. The law corresponds to one month; the cycle corresponds to one year. One year has three hundred and sixty days, moving through three hundred and sixty lines of the trigrams; the remaining twenty-four lines belong to the four trigrams. When the lines are exhausted, the cycle begins again. One month has five or six, thirty days; the meridians and latitudes of the trigrams serve the sun and move. One day has two trigrams; thirty days total sixty trigrams. The remaining four trigrams are Qian, Kun, Kan, and Li. Qian, Kun, Kan, and Li move the sixty trigrams but are not counted among the trigram lines. The first fifteen days of the month are yang, firm; the latter fifteen days are yin, soft. Yang is born in the front, the interior; yin is born in the back, the exterior. Thus the sixty trigrams govern thirty days, three yin and three yang, mutually interior and exterior. Each day’s day and night each move one trigram. Each month’s new moon dawn moves the trigram *Dun* by day, and *Meng* by night. The two trigrams of day and night have twelve lines; one hour corresponds to one line; twelve hours, twelve lines. Thus moving through thirty days, three hundred and sixty lines are traversed. Beginning with *Dun* and *Meng*, ending with *Ji* and *Wei*, the cycle ends and begins anew. This is the meaning of the commentary passage: “*Dun* corresponds to *Zi* and *Shen*; *Meng* corresponds to *Yin* and *Xu*. The remaining sixty trigrams each have their own day.”

The perfected person silently penetrates creation, secretly harmonizing yin and yang, taking the sun and moon as measure and cycle. When movement is due, movement occurs; when stillness is due, stillness occurs. One movement, one stillness, never missing its time. One day has early and late; when yang advances, yang advances accordingly, as spring and summer follow the inner essence, from *Zi* to *Chen* and *Si*, moving the six yang trigrams. When yin is due, yin is used, as autumn and winter apply the outer function, from *Wu* to *Xu* and *Hai*, moving the six yin trigrams. When reward is due, reward is given, responding to spring’s life energy; when punishment is due, punishment is given, responding to autumn’s killing energy. When dusk comes, it is dusk, gathering yang energy to meet the cold; when dawn comes, it is dawn, stirring yang energy to meet the heat. One reward, one punishment, responding to the energies of spring and autumn; punishment and virtue both proper. Clear division of reward and punishment, dusk and dawn, following the cold and heat of the seasons; dusk and dawn have their times, advance and retreat are fitting. One joy, one anger, embodying the benevolence and righteousness of the lines; joy and anger find their proper place, life and death have their dao. Thus the four seasons respond, the Five Phases follow their principle, and the work of the elixir is complete. The Way of the Elixir harmonizes the Four Images and gathers the Five Phases. When the Four Images harmonize and the Five Phases gather, the head of the elixir is attained; from here one may advance step by step, and the great dao may be hoped for.

Heaven and Earth set their positions, and the *Yi* moves within them. Heaven and Earth are the images of Qian and Kun; setting positions means arranging the places of yin and yang in accord; the *Yi* speaks of Kan and Li. Kan and Li are the two functions of Qian and Kun. The two functions have no fixed line positions; they circulate through the six voids, coming and going without fixed place, above and below without constancy.

Heaven and Earth are the law and image of Qian and Kun. Qian and Kun are the nature and temperament of Heaven and Earth. The Great Ultimate places Qian above and Kun below, fixing their positions—Heaven above, Earth below, one yin and one yang, harmonizing creation within. The Way of the *Yi* thus moves within Heaven and Earth. The *Yi* is formed with sun above and moon below, taking their rising and setting. The moon is the image of Kan; the sun is the image of Li. Kan is solid within, symbolizing the moon with its rabbit; Li is hollow within, symbolizing the sun with its crow. Kan and Li are the succeeding bodies of Qian and Kun. When Qian and Kun interpenetrate, one line of Qian enters Kun’s belly, Kun’s solid forms Kan; one line of Kun enters Qian’s body, Qian’s hollow forms Li. Li is the succeeding body of Qian; Kan is the succeeding body of Kun. The yin within Li is the just yin of Kun’s house; the yang within Kan is the just yang of Qian’s house. Kan and Li possess the just virtue of Qian and Kun, acting in place of Qian and Kun to carry out creation, symbolizing Heaven and Earth’s non-action, the sun and moon’s movement. Thus Kan and Li are the two functions of Qian and Kun. Kan and Li take their images from sun and moon; thus the *Yi*’s Kan and Li are the sun and moon. Kan’s lunar phases wax and wane, one month one revolution; Li’s solar phases move north and south, one year one revolution. The two functions of Kan and Li have no fixed position; they circulate east, west, south, and north, above and below in six voids of emptiness, coming and going without fixed stop. Above and below, there is no constant law. The *Zhou Yi* places Qian and Kun at the head, Kan and Li in the middle, and *Ji Ji* and *Wei Ji* at the end, all inheriting Heaven and Earth’s creation, the sun and moon’s coming and going, their upward and downward movement. This is the meaning of the commentary passage: “The *Yi* moves in cycles, bending and stretching, folding and unfolding. Hidden and profound, it sinks and hides, transforming within. Enveloping all things, it is the dao’s pattern and law.”

The cultivator who understands this meaning takes Qian and Kun as furnace and cauldron, Kan and Li as medicinal substances, one firm and one soft, both returning to central balance. Then the gate of Heaven is in hand, the axis of Earth is in the heart. One may move, one may be still; one may move within stillness, stillness within movement; movement and stillness flow without hindrance, perfectly embodying Heaven’s principle, one breath circulating.

The *Yi* is image. The greatest images suspended and made clear are none other than sun and moon. The sun unites the essence of the Five Phases; the moon receives the six laws and cycles. Five, six, and thirty degrees—when the measure ends, it begins anew. Exhausting the spirits to know transformation, when yang departs yin arrives, converging and rotating, entering and exiting, rolling and unrolling. The *Yi* has three hundred and eighty-four lines. According to the lines, talismans are extracted; talisman means the sixty-four trigrams. From dark to new moon dawn, *Zhen* comes to receive the talisman. At this moment, Heaven and Earth join their essence; sun and moon mutually support and hold. Male yang sows profound influence; female yin transforms and encloses. Chaos interweaves and connects; the balance and the carriage set the root foundation. Managing and nourishing the inner *Yin* and *E*, condensing spirit to form the body. All beings tread this path; all movement comes from it.

The *Xi Ci* says: “Heaven and Earth blend and ferment; all things transform and mature. Male and female join essence; all things are born from transformation.” All things in Heaven and Earth belonging to yang are male; those belonging to yin are female. Male and female join essence; all beings tread this path to emerge. Even the writhing and moving things containing spirit all come from this path. Taking the way of sun and moon’s union and the coming and going of yin and yang, one may analogously understand. This is the meaning of the commentary passage: “Hidden and profound, sinking and hiding, transforming within. Enveloping all things, it is the dao’s pattern and law. Using the void to govern the manifest, the vessel’s function is emptiness.”

Thus Confucius praised the great chaos; Qian and Kun’s virtue penetrates the void. Tracing antiquity to the Primordial Sovereign, *Guan Ju* establishes the first beginning; marriage and union link their energies; the first year sprouts and grows. The sage is not born in vain; he looks up to Heaven’s manifest talisman. Heaven’s talisman has advance and retreat, bending and stretching to respond to time.

Above we spoke of yin and yang mingling in chaos, joining without form to produce being; thus we know that without yin and yang’s union there is no life force. The *Zhong Yong* says: “The gentleman’s dao begins with husband and wife.” This means the way of husband and wife is the starting point of the gentleman’s creation of the dao; thus the dao is subtle and hidden. Even the foolish husband and wife can know it; the unworthy husband and wife can practice it. When it reaches its fullness, observing Heaven and Earth, its vastness has no outside, its minuteness no inside; between Heaven and Earth all is dao qi. Small as husband and wife, large as Heaven and Earth, all are nothing but the one dao of yin and yang joining.

In ancient times, the Proclaimer of the Sage praised the *Yi*, placing Qian and Kun first, praising the great chaos. Above is Qian, below is Kun; within is the void, one breath mingled as one, the way of life and creation—this is great chaos. The *Shi* begins with *Guan Ju*, tracing the Primordial Sovereign. Male crowns, female marries; their energies link, yin and yang unite, life sprouts and grows, called the first year. Great chaos is the gateway of creation. The Primordial Sovereign and first year are the beginning of creation. Qian and Kun’s united virtue is great chaos. Male and female unite naturally, sprouting growth. All this shows the principle of yin and yang used together.

The sage is not born in vain in the world; he perfects himself and perfects things, wishing all to be sages and wise, each to realize their nature and life. Thus he looks up to Heaven’s talisman, revealing the mechanism of yin and yang’s advance and retreat, bending and stretching. Like the earlier Heaven trigrams, Li on the left and Kan on the right, *Zhen* one yang, *Dui* two yang, Qian three yang, advancing and stretching from left; *Xun* one yin, *Gen* two yin, Kun three yin, retreating and bending from right. Also like the later Heaven trigrams, Qian, Kan, and Gen advance with three yang to the northeast; Xun, Li, Kun, and Dui retreat with three yin to the southwest. These all reveal Heaven’s talisman. Heaven’s talisman changes endlessly, never departing from yin and yang’s harmony. This is the meaning of the commentary passage: “Therefore, pushing the coming and going, Kan and Li disappear and vanish” through “principle as evidence.”

Thus the *Yi* governs Heaven’s heart, reestablishing beginnings and sprouts; the eldest son succeeds the father’s essence, relying on the mother to set the foundation. The coming and going respond to the bell’s rhythm, rising and falling depend on the Dipper’s pivot. On the third day the dawn arises, *Zhen* and *Geng* receive the west. On the eighth day *Dui* receives *Ding*, the first quarter is as taut as a string. On the fifteenth day Qian’s essence arrives, full and bright in the east *Jia*. The toad and rabbit phases of the moon, sun and moon’s qi shine together; the toad watches the trigram’s season, the rabbit breathes forth light. The seventh and eighth days have passed; winding and descending, on the sixteenth day turning to receive the order, *Xun* and *Xin* see the dawn; *Gen* meets *Bing* in the south; the last quarter on the twenty-third day; Kun on the thirtieth day; northeast loses its companion. The season ends and mutual meditation occurs; the succeeding body revives the dragon. *Ren* and *Gui* pair with *Jia* and *Yi*; Qian and Kun encompass beginning and end. Seven and eight sum to fifteen; nine and six also correspond; four combine to thirty; yang qi is sought, extinguished, and stored. This symbolizes midwinter, when grass and trees wither and die. Supporting yang, reprimanding merchants and travelers; the ruler deeply conceals himself. This symbolizes following the season’s order, closing the mouth and not speaking. Heaven’s dao is vast and broad; the Great Mystery has no form or shape; emptiness and silence cannot be seen; it encompasses and dissolves. Errors and failures arise from mistaken words, speech only defeats virtue. Separately recounting these Four Images to enlighten later generations who are blind.

Emptiness and silence (one text reads “considered silence”).

Above we spoke of Heaven’s talisman having advance and retreat, bending and stretching to respond to time. Responding to time with advance and retreat, bending and stretching, all is Heaven’s heart at work. Heaven’s heart is formless and imageless, unseen; through yin and yang’s interpenetration, a single point of life force emerges from the void, enough to be seen. The *Yi*’s *Fu* trigram’s image says: “Does it not reveal Heaven and Earth’s heart?” *Fu* means yin extreme and yang birth; Kun conceives *Zhen*; yang qi first sprouts in the eleventh month, the *Zi* month. *Zhen*’s one yang comes from Qian’s palace, the succeeding body of Qian, the eldest son succeeding the father’s essence. Qian is father, so the eldest son succeeds the father’s essence. *Zhen*’s one yang is born under pure Kun; Kun is mother, so the foundation is set by the mother. The foundation is the beginning, the base is the root. Yin extreme births yang; Qian and Kun interpenetrate; in the dim and vague there is substance; in the obscure and dark there is essence; life force begins to return to the root at this foundation. This life force is Heaven’s heart; it is *Zhen*’s one yang. Because all things borrow this to be born, it is called life force; because it appears in yin-yang interpenetration, it is called Heaven’s heart; because it is still extreme then moves, it is called *Zhen*. In truth it is life force, *Zhen* yang, all is Heaven’s heart. This Heaven’s heart is everywhere, always present. Yet everywhere present, always there, it is hard for people to measure, thus unseen. When the eleventh month’s *Zi* arrives, all things sprout from the earth; people know its life force moves, so it can be seen. Heaven’s heart is yang born from yin; Heaven and Earth’s heart appears where yin and yang interpenetrate. In truth, Heaven and Earth’s heart is one heart; Heaven’s heart is always one, only differing in appearance and birth. This life force of Heaven’s heart is endless; its coming and going, rising and falling, all governed by *Yi*’s principle. The coming and going respond to the bell’s rhythm; rising and falling depend on the Dipper’s pivot. For example, the *Zi* month’s one yang is born; in the trigram it is *Fu*; the rhythm corresponds to the Yellow Bell; the Dipper’s pivot points to *Zi*. The *Chou* month’s two yang are born; in the trigram it is *Lin*; the rhythm corresponds to the Great Lü; the Dipper’s pivot points to *Chou* and so forth. The twelve trigrams of six yin and six yang govern the twelve months, correspond to the twelve rhythms, and follow the twelve positions the Dipper’s pivot points to. The yin-yang coming and going, rising and falling of the twelve months, the Dipper’s pivot turning—all are changes of Heaven’s heart. The *Yi*’s six yin and six yang trigrams govern this. Is this not the *Yi* governing Heaven’s heart? This is the meaning of the commentary passage: “New moon dawn is *Fu*” through “returning to Kun’s origin.”

Also, at each month’s dark and new moon, sun and moon meet; the moon receives the sun’s light. On the first, second, and third days, the pure black body at dusk births a faint yang, in the trigram *Zhen*, showing the light of Emei in the southwest *Geng* direction—this is called *Zhen* receiving *Geng*. Gradually by the eighth day, two yang are born; in the trigram *Dui*, symbolizing half the light born, the first quarter moon appears in the south *Ding* direction—this is called *Dui* receiving *Ding*. By the fifteenth day, three yang are full; in the trigram *Qian*, the brilliance fills the wheel, appearing in the east *Jia* direction—this is called *Qian* receiving *Jia*. Yang reaches its extreme then yin returns, bending and lowering. On the eighteenth day, one yin is born beneath the brilliance; in the trigram *Xun*, the brilliance is lacking, dawn appears in the west *Xin* direction—this is called *Xun* receiving *Xin*. On the twenty-third day, two yin are born; in the trigram *Gen*, the light is half missing, dawn appears in the south *Bing* direction—this is called *Gen* receiving *Bing*. On the twenty-eighth day, dawn’s faint yang disappears in the northeast *Yi* direction; the brilliance there is extinguished. By the thirtieth day, yin qi is pure and full; in the trigram *Kun*. This is called *Kun* receiving *Yi*. The moon’s light is born in the southwest *Geng* direction; the *Yi* direction in the northeast loses its companion. The season ends and mutual meditation occurs; darkness turns to new moon; yin extreme births yang; *Zhen* succeeding body again births light; the cycle ends and begins anew. *Ren* and *Gui* pair with *Jia* and *Yi*; Qian and Kun encompass beginning and end. *Ren* yang and *Gui* yin; *Jia* yang and *Yi* yin. *Ren* water is clear, born of Qian’s yang qi; *Gui* water is turbid, transformed from Kun’s yin qi. *Ren* pairs with *Jia*; Qian receives *Jia* and *Ren*; *Gui* pairs with *Yi*; Kun receives *Yi* and *Gui*. Each month’s first half belongs to yang, the Qian family’s affair; the latter half belongs to yin, the Kun family’s affair. From *Zhen* to Qian, from *Xun* to Kun, these are the three yang and three yin trigrams of Qian and Kun, governing the month’s beginning and end. Qian governs the yang born within yin, days seven, eight, and fifteen. Kun governs the yin born within yang, days nine, six, and fifteen. Seven, eight, nine, and six together make thirty days; the moon’s yang light completes one cycle of waxing and waning, the coming and going, advance and retreat, bending and stretching. The *Yi*’s three yin and three yang trigrams govern this. Though three yin and three yang govern, in truth Qian and Kun’s two trigrams govern. Though Qian and Kun govern, in truth one point of life force in Heaven’s heart governs. Is this not the *Yi* governing Heaven’s heart? This is the meaning of the commentary passage: “Between dark and new moon” through “as the *Yi*’s ancestor.”

Above we spoke of one year and one month’s yin-yang advance and retreat, bending and stretching, all natural and spontaneous, nothing but Heaven’s heart at work. Yang advancing and stretching is Heaven’s heart’s expansion; yin retreating and bending is Heaven’s heart’s contraction. Yang is called Heaven’s heart; yin must also be called Heaven’s heart. Yang also comes from Heaven’s heart; yin also comes from Heaven’s heart. Yin and yang both arise from Heaven’s heart. Heaven’s heart is mixed within yin and yang; yin and yang are not outside Heaven’s heart. But Heaven’s heart’s visible origin is always at the still extreme before movement begins; thus it symbolizes midwinter, when grass and trees all wither and die, yin at its extreme. Yin extreme births yang; the ancient kings closed their gates at the solstice; merchants and travelers did not move; later no one knew the place; deeply concealed and still. This is to assist the faint yang and nurture Heaven’s heart’s life force.

If the cultivator can model the times and follow the seasons, like the ancient kings closing their gates, reaching utmost emptiness and profound stillness, then the pre-Heaven qi arises from nothing, white is born from black, Heaven’s heart reappears, condensing into a single grain of millet, warming and nurturing it, shedding the old body and changing the bones, living long without death—this is certainly possible. Alas! Just this phrase, “model the times and follow the seasons,” already explains the subtle essence of the Golden Elixir. What more need be said? Thus one may close the mouth and need not speak. The Way of the Golden Elixir, from beginning to end, is only cultivating the one taste of Heaven’s heart, modeling the times and following the seasons; then Heaven’s heart always remains, from tender to firm, from subtle to manifest. With time and deep practice, it never decays. To know the one is to complete all tasks; why speak further? Yet Heaven’s dao principle is vast and boundless; the Great Mystery’s qi is formless and shapeless, utmost emptiness and silence, invisible to the eye. How then to set boundaries and enclosures as a measure? Heaven’s dao is the Great Mystery, all other names are but Heaven’s heart. Heaven’s heart is empty and silent, invisible, thus cannot be bounded and enclosed. If one forces speech, errors will arise. Losing the thread of Heaven’s heart’s vastness, emptiness, silence, and flow, one cannot grasp the method; speech only defeats virtue. Better not to speak. But the dao itself is wordless; words reveal the dao. If not speaking, how to guide later learners? Thus borrowing the Way of the *Yi* to separately recount the Four Images of Qian, Kun, Kan, and Li. Using one year’s cycle of Heaven and Earth’s yin-yang coming and going, one month’s Kan and Li’s sun and moon union, revealing Heaven’s heart’s trace, to enlighten later generations’ blindness. From “symbolizing midwinter” to “to enlighten later generations’ blindness,” the commentary passage “Always follow the earth’s geography” through “lasting for a thousand years” conveys the meaning. The entire season is the pulse of Heaven’s heart, borrowing one year’s yin and yang, one month’s waxing and waning, to unfold the heavenly mechanism of one spirit and two transformations. The final section returns to formless, imageless, wordless place; Heaven’s heart fully revealed. It is said to be vast and broad, formless and shapeless, invisible—true emptiness containing wondrous being, wondrous being containing true emptiness. Heaven’s heart is the original image—this alone. This is unspoken speech; the utmost in words. Though it is commentary on the *Cantong Qi*, the Immortal Elder probes deeply and uncovers hidden meanings, revealing what the text did not, as if uprooting Heaven’s root and carving the cavern of principle. Yet fearing difficulty of understanding, the concluding phrase says: “Separately recount these Four Images, to enlighten later generations’ blindness,” so learners may exhaust images without images, exhaust form without form. Such compassion is great indeed.

The Eight Trigrams arrayed with their stars move without losing the center; the primordial essence is subtle and hard to see, deduced and verified by talismanic correspondence. At rest, observe their images, approximate their forms, establish charts as models, divining to determine auspiciousness or misfortune, issuing commands to follow the seasons, never missing the time of line movement. Above, observe the patterns of the Heavenly River; below, arrange the earth’s forms and flows; in the middle, examine human hearts, benevolence, righteousness, propriety, wisdom, and constancy—the heavenly goodness. Referencing the Way of the Three Powers, combine into one Way. In motion, follow the trigram’s seasons; in stillness, rely on the *Tuan* texts to finely discern auspiciousness and misfortune. Emulate Heaven’s law and Earth’s use, employing nine and six, acting according to time, healthy and harmonious, returning to the central and balanced dao, perfectly embodying Heaven’s principle, then our body and Heaven and Earth are in order.

Above, observing the Heavenly River’s patterns (one text reads “above, examining the River Diagram’s patterns”) and below, arranging Earth’s forms and flows (one text reads “under Heaven”), then all is in order.

Above we spoke of separately recounting the Four Images to enlighten later generations’ blindness. The Four Images are Qian, Kun, Kan, and Li. The *Yi* takes Qian and Kun as essence, Kan and Li as function. Qian, Kun, Kan, and Li mutually depend as essence and function. *Zhen*’s yang birth, *Gen*’s yang rest, *Xun*’s yin concealment, *Dui*’s yin manifestation all follow Kan and Li’s operation. Thus the later Heaven Eight Trigrams’ positions: Qian, Kan, Gen, *Zhen*, *Xun*, Li, Kun, *Dui*, each occupying one of the eight directions. Arranged among the Twenty-Eight Constellations and their stars, they move the trigram qi, shifting with the four seasons and eight solar terms, through seventy-two pentads. Yet among the Eight Trigrams, the ones moving the trigram qi are Kan and Li. Kan symbolizes the moon; Li symbolizes the sun. The sun travels the middle path; the moon travels nine paths. The sun and moon come and go north and south, their movement uncertain. Yet where sun and moon meet, they never lose the middle path. The later Heaven Eight Trigrams’ positions have Li in the south, Kan in the north; Kan and Li occupy the central and proper position, symbolizing the sun and moon’s movement along the middle path. The middle path is the ecliptic, the sun’s path, and the place where sun and moon meet. At the sun and moon’s meeting is the primordial essence of Heaven and Earth. The primordial essence is formless and imageless, subtle and hard to see; the sun’s illumination and the moon’s presence are the primordial essence’s divine work. Only humans also have this primordial essence. This essence is the root of nature and life, the basis of birth and death. It is not the turbid things of the later Heaven’s form and image, but the supreme treasure of pre-Heaven’s formless and imageless. Though subtle and hard to see, how can it be ours? Yet by deducing the yin-yang coming and going’s measure, imitating the talismanic signs of sun and moon’s meeting, at rest observing the trigrams’ interlacing and matching images, one finds the infinite in the finite, the image in the obscure, the true essence in the hidden. Where being and non-being meet, the true is visible. Once the true is seen, one may begin cultivation, establishing charts as models. The charts fix the length of day and night. Compared to the cultivator, the heart-lord is clear and still, ruling from the center, thus a norm, not deceived by external things. Divining to determine auspiciousness and misfortune means the time to use yin or yang. Using it at the right time brings good fortune; at the wrong time, misfortune. Issuing commands to follow the seasons means advancing yang when yang advances, issuing commands to enact virtue; moving yin when yin moves, issuing commands to enact punishment. Punishment and virtue advance and retreat, following spring, summer, autumn, and winter’s order, never missing the time of firm and soft line movement. The pre-Heaven primordial essence naturally condenses from the void. This is the Way, the one Heaven and Earth’s Way. The cultivator must observe the Heavenly River’s stars’ movement east, west, south, and north; examine the earth’s forms, heights, depths, and waters’ flow; investigate human hearts’ benevolence, righteousness, propriety, and wisdom, the heavenly goodness. Referencing the Way of the Three Powers, combine into one Way. In motion, follow the trigram’s seasons, firm and soft alternating; in stillness, rely on the *Tuan* texts to finely discern auspiciousness and misfortune. Emulate Heaven’s law and Earth’s use, employing nine and six, acting according to time, healthy and harmonious, returning to the central and balanced dao, perfectly embodying Heaven’s principle, then our body and Heaven and Earth are in order. Our body and Heaven and Earth are the original possession of vigorous yang and compliant yin virtue. When vigorous and compliant virtues unite, yin-yang qi harmonizes, virtue matches Heaven and Earth, calmly abiding in the middle way, one is a sage. Yet without knowing astronomy, not understanding geography, the human heart’s desires mix confusedly, not knowing the way of change and transformation, either clinging to the middle or clinging to the one, how can one attain the place of calm middle way? The phrase “then in order” has the meaning of exhaustive knowledge and limitless practice within; learners must deeply savor. This section’s commentary passage “The head of governance, renewing and reforming” conveys this meaning.

As for the utmost sage, he is no more than Fu Xi, who first drew the Eight Trigrams, imitating Heaven and Earth. King Wen, the emperor’s ancestor, formed the structure and developed the line texts. Confucius and the other sages, mighty and grand, added the Ten Wings to assist. The three sovereigns were Heaven’s chosen, successively arising to govern time. Excellence and inferiority have order; merit and virtue are not unequal. The making follows steps; deducing and measuring carefully, weighing precisely. Things with form are easy to measure; things without signs are hard to plan. The rules for making things are clear; they fix the book for the world. Without prior knowledge or form, one awakens through the teacher. Bright as lifting the curtain, glaring eyes ascend the high terrace. The six hundred chapters of the *Fire Record* pursue equality without confusion. The words are solemn and serious; the world’s people do not deeply ponder. Tracing their source and flow, light and dark originally coexist. Secretly for the worthy to discuss, how dare lightly write a book? If one seals the tongue and is silent, abandoning the dao, one incurs guilt and punishment. Writing feelings on bamboo and silk, yet fearing to reveal Heaven’s talisman, hesitating with added sighs, looking up and down, weaving this foolishness. Cultivation has rules and measures, not all can be fully revealed. Briefly outlining its pattern and law, branches and leaves show their support and spread.

Not confused (one text reads “not unequal”); branches and leaves (one text reads “branches”).

The Way of Heaven and Earth’s divine transformation is without sound or smell; only the sage can know it, only the sage can practice it. Since the beginning of creation, the dao has manifested images, yet people do not recognize it. The River Diagram emerged from the Yellow River; the Book emerged from Luo River; sages followed them. Fu Xi took the River Diagram, looking up and down, first drawing the Eight Trigrams, then expanding to sixty-four trigrams, revealing Heaven’s creation’s heavenly secret. Passed down to King Wen, transformed into the later Heaven Eight Trigrams, casting yarrow stalks to develop the later Heaven sixty-four trigrams, divided into three hundred and eighty-four lines. Also attached are words of auspiciousness, misfortune, regret, and blame, making clear the ways of Heaven’s time and human affairs. Later, the Proclaimer of the Sage wrote the Ten Wings, probing hidden depths, assisting the Way of the *Yi*. Its principles of Heaven’s time and human affairs, following and opposing changes, are all thoroughly clear and complete. Heaven gave birth to three sages, who arose in turn to create, govern time, and measure the world, passing down the lifeline for ten thousand generations. Though the steps have order, merit and virtue are equal. During the Eastern Han, Bo Yang Wei Zhenren followed the Way of the *Yi* to compose the *Cantong Qi*, deducing the trigrams’ auspiciousness, misfortune, regret, and blame, carefully distinguishing the elixir’s medicines and fire times, transforming the manifest into the unmanifest, comparing the image to the imageless, making it easier for people to comprehend.

This book was composed by the perfected person for the world, not for fame. Without prior knowledge or form, awakened by the teacher, this is how Xu Weng himself claimed he could not recognize the book’s profound mystery. Having first received instruction from the Yin perfected person, gaining awakening, he then saw this book and thus recognized it. Alas! Xu Weng’s heavenly talent still could not foresee the *Cantong Qi*; he must have had a teacher to awaken him. How many people in the world are lost, self-proclaimed sages, seeking no true teacher, recklessly speculating and guessing, taking one or two ancient cases, speaking of dao and discussing virtue, thinking themselves greatly enlightened, yet when asked about the *Cantong Qi*, know nothing of nine parts out of ten, yet think they understand—how far off! Little do they know this book is the ancestor of all immortal elixir books. Later works by Ziyang Wuzhen, Xinglin Fuming, Bilin Huanyuan, Ziqing Diyuan, and Changchun Xiyou all stem from this book. The highest sages and adepts, gaining one secret from a teacher, carefully reading this book, expanding their knowledge and insight, is like drawing back the curtain in a dark room, suddenly seeing light; like ascending a high terrace, glaring eyes scanning everywhere. Even the six hundred chapters of the *Fire Record* can be approached without confusion.

The six hundred chapters of the *Fire Record* are the sixty-four trigrams of the *Zhou Yi*. Ten *Yi* make one hundred; this takes the fire times most detailed and precise, refining ever more exquisitely. Outside the sixty-four trigrams, there are no other six hundred chapters of the *Fire Record*. The solemn and serious words of the commentary repeat again and again because learners fear difficulty and are unwilling to deeply study the subtle points; thus repetition is to urge and awaken. If one is willing to grapple with the text, restrain oneself with propriety, taking from things far and near, seeking the source of the dao, measuring its flow, knowing source and flow, understanding light and dark, this is called knowing the dao. Such teachings can be for the knowing; difficult to speak to the unknowing. If not the worthy, how dare lightly reveal? Not daring to lightly reveal, nor to abandon the dao and incur punishment. Hesitating with sighs, looking up and down, writing to await a kindred spirit. As for the methods of cultivation and forging, adding and subtracting, advancing and retreating in order, one must wait for the secret formula; not all can be expressed in words. Briefly outlining the pattern and law, revealing its techniques, to clarify the grand outline of the dao.

Alas! The Immortal Elder’s annotations on the *Cantong Qi*, thousands of words, many examples, precise and detailed. Yet he still says it cannot be fully revealed, only briefly outlining the pattern and law. Alas, later learners hear one phrase or half a phrase and immediately think themselves sufficient and satisfied, unwilling to study deeply, simply saying the dao cannot be spoken—truly the Immortal Elder’s fault! Is this not lamentable?
