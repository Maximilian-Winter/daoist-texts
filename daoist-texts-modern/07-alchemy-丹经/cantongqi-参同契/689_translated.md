# Commentary on the Cantong Qi — Middle Section

To strike fire with the sun-drill: without the sun, no light is born. To summon water with the square and compass: without stars and moon, how could one obtain the watery essence? The two energies are profound and distant, yet their mutual influence and transformation still connect them—how much more so when they dwell close within the body! The crucial point lies in the heart and chest. Yin and yang paired with sun and moon, water and fire serve as their manifest tokens.

The way of cultivating the true is entirely about stealing the void and formless qi of Heaven and Earth, pilfering the power of yin-yang transformation. The Yin Conductor Scripture says: “The secret theft of the mechanism—none under Heaven can see it, none can know it.” Only when the world neither sees nor knows can one truly steal it. If one can see and know, then it is the acquired, not the primordial. What is cultivated is one’s own yin; how could it condense the sacred embryo, bring forth existence from nonexistence, and make form and spirit both wondrous? Consider the sun-drill: originally without fire, it borrows the sun and instantly births flame; the square and compass: originally without water, it reflects stars and moon and instantly gains water. Though the sun-drill and square-compass lie tens of thousands of miles apart from sun and moon, their presence and absence respond to each other, enabling the flow of qi. How much more so with the primordial qi, near at hand within my body, centered in heart and chest—how could it fail to transform? Those who cannot transform are all because yin and yang fail to harmonize. If they harmonize, then the primordial qi, coming from the void, within one single hour will govern the completion of the elixir.

Indeed, the body’s yang nature and yin temperament are like the sun and moon in the heavens; the body’s true essence, primordial spirit, are like the water and fire of sun and moon; the body’s mysterious gateway is like the sun-drill and square-compass. When the mysterious gateway stands, nature and temperament connect; when nature and temperament connect, spirit flourishes; when spirit flourishes, the Golden Elixir is born. Just like the sun-drill striking fire and the square-compass drawing water—these two complement each other, and from their union one thing is born. This is the marvel of producing existence from nonexistence. The Dao De Jing says: “The valley spirit never dies; it is called the mysterious gateway. The gateway of the mysterious gateway is called the root of Heaven and Earth.” The mysterious yang is active; the gateway yin is still. The gateway of the mysterious gateway is the gate where yin and yang are born, where movement and stillness arise—thus it is called the root of Heaven and Earth. Within this gate dwells the valley spirit. The valley spirit is the spirit of yin and yang united as one. The valley spirit moves and rests, giving birth to yin and yang; yin and yang unite and give birth to the valley spirit. The mysterious gateway is the valley spirit. Follow it and it births humans who form illusory bodies; oppose it and it births immortals who form true bodies. Between following and opposing lies the great divide between truth and illusion. The Immortal Elder uses the sun-drill to strike fire, the square-compass to draw water—these two energies mutually responding to each other reveal a wondrous image for us. This passage comments on the great meaning of the sections “About to nourish nature” and “Kan man is the moon.”

Right and wrong traverse the organs; inward observation brings thought; stepping through the constellations, walking the Big Dipper, the Six Jia with the sun and stars. The yin path loathes the Nine Ones, the turbid chaos toys with the primordial cells. Eating qi stirs the intestines and stomach; exhaling the correct and inhaling the external evil. Day and night without rest, waxing and waning never pause. The body grows weary each day, dazed and seeming foolish. A hundred vessels boil and race, unable to settle in clarity. Building earth, setting up altars and temples, morning and evening reverent sacrifices. Ghostly beings appear in shapes, dreams and waking stir sighs. The heart rejoices with gladness, believing surely life will be prolonged. Suddenly fate cuts short, death comes, the body rots and decays. Every movement is contrary, rebellious, losing the pivot of the mechanism. The arts are many and varied, thousands upon thousands of threads, but all violate the teachings of Huang-Lao, twisting and turning against the Nine Capitals. The wise examine their purpose, and with spacious clarity know the source.

Examine their purpose (one version reads “scrutinize their purpose”); building earth (one version reads “black earth”).

The way of cultivating the true: once attained, forever attained; the utmost simplicity and ease—know it and act on it, and one immediately ascends to the sage’s rank. In Confucianism, this is the way of the Mean; in Daoism, the way of the Golden Elixir; in Buddhism, the way of the One Vehicle. The key lies in the balance of hardness and softness, the harmony of nature and temperament, the unity of sincerity without duality. Scholars of the world, lacking true teachers, rush into side paths: some fix the mind and halt thought, practicing inner observation; some step the Big Dipper and walk the constellations, refining the Six Jia; some practice the Nine Ones’ evil arts, toying with primordial cells; some manipulate breath qi and abstain from grain; some stay awake day and night, dazed as if foolish; some circulate qi along the noon and midnight meridians, a hundred vessels boiling; some build earth and set up altars, neighboring ghosts and monsters. Such are the thousands upon thousands of methods, all with errors and deviations, rebellious and losing the great way; their aim is eternal life, but instead they harm life. They violate the teachings of Huang-Lao and suffer the calamities of the Nine Capitals. Do they not know that in the world there is the Seven Returns and Nine Returns Great Golden Elixir, able to transform female into male, old into child, granting longevity and immortality? If a wise and determined scholar meets a true master and understands the great way’s purpose, with spacious clarity they know the path of cultivating the true is not among the three thousand six hundred gates. This passage comments on the meaning of the section “Guan Guan Ju Jiu” (the call of the ospreys).

When the upper gate closes, it is called existence; when the lower gate closes, it is called nonexistence. Nonexistence serves the upper; above dwells the divine virtue. These two orifices and their methods, the golden qi also mutually assist.

Above it says the wise scrutinize their purpose, spaciously knowing the source. To scrutinize—what purpose? To know—what source? It is to scrutinize the purpose of the Golden Elixir and to know the source of return. The way of the Golden Elixir has two methods: the method of action and the method of non-action. The superior virtue practices the way of non-action to complete nature; the inferior virtue practices the way of action to complete life. The superior virtue practicing non-action does so because their primordial nature is uninjured, yin and yang harmonize, the human heart’s orifices are closed, and the Dao heart always remains—thus it is called existence. The inferior virtue practicing action does so because their primordial nature is already damaged, yin and yang scatter, the Dao heart’s orifices are closed, and the human heart rules—thus it is called nonexistence. Existence means having the Dao heart but no human heart; nonexistence means no Dao heart but having the human heart. No Dao heart is inferior virtue; having Dao heart is superior virtue. Therefore, the nonexistence of inferior virtue must serve the existence of superior virtue, removing the human heart and increasing the Dao heart, guarding nonexistence to preserve existence. The existence of superior virtue means divine virtue always dwells, nourishing the Dao heart and guarding against the human heart, borrowing existence to transform nonexistence. When the human heart departs, that is true nonexistence; when the Dao heart is firm, that is true existence. True nonexistence is true yin; true existence is true yang. True nonexistence and true existence—these two orifices and their methods, the golden qi also mutually assist. The two orifices are the true nonexistence and true existence orifices. The methods are the two methods of action and non-action. The golden qi is the primordial true one qi, called gold in water. This qi is vague and elusive, dark and mysterious, neither form nor void, neither existence nor nonexistence, existence and nonexistence mutually shaping, one thing born thereby. Hence the two orifices. Using methods to cultivate it, the golden qi mutually assists within and condenses. It is not said the golden qi mutually assists, but that the golden qi also mutually assists—herein lies great secret. The Dao heart possesses true knowing and feeling, belonging to gold. Its qi is utmost hardness and greatness, filling Heaven and Earth, unyielding to all things—thus called golden qi. This qi has many names: golden flower, gold in water, true lead, primordial qi, spirit brightness, divine virtue, primordial essence, yellow sprout—all returning to the real place, ultimately the virtue of true knowing and spirit brightness; this is divine virtue. The superior virtue practices the non-action method, guarding against danger and worry to preserve and nourish; the inferior virtue practices the action method, gradually gathering and refining to return. Able to preserve, existence returns to purity; able to return, nonexistence again becomes existence. The two methods of action and non-action together complete this divine virtue golden qi as one. Hence it says the golden qi also mutually assists. Superior and inferior virtue differ in action and non-action. When the golden qi is forged into treasure, the acquired yin qi is exhausted, form and spirit both wondrous, united with the Dao and true, then existence and nonexistence both cease to stand, Heaven and Earth all return to emptiness—what need then to distinguish superior and inferior virtue? This passage comments on the meaning of “Superior virtue is non-action, not seeking by inspection; inferior virtue acts, its use never ceases.”

Using gold as a dam and defense, water enters and then roams freely. The gold counts to fifteen, the water’s number likewise. At the furnace, fix the weights and measures—five parts water is surplus. The two taken as true, the gold weighs as at the beginning. The third does not enter, fire joins with the two. The three mutually contain and receive, their transformations appear divine. Below is the sun’s qi, steaming and rising in a moment. First liquid, then solid, called the Yellow Chariot. As the years draw near their end, nature is destroyed and lifespan harmed. The body turns to ash and dust, like bright window dust. Pounding and blending together, holding it into the red gate. Firmly sealing the junction, striving for completeness and solidity. Fierce fire spreads below, day and night the sounds are diligent and true. The initial literary method allows cultivation; in the end, martial is displayed. Watch and wait with utmost caution, carefully adjusting cold and warmth. Circling the twelve solar terms, when the term ends one must be even more attentive. The qi and life thread will sever; rest, death of soul and spirit. The color shifts to purple, brilliantly forming the returning elixir. Powdered and pressed into one pill, the blade and wedge are most divine.

Mutually contain and receive (one version reads “already combined measure”); like ash and dust (one version reads “as ash and dust”).

The previous passage spoke of superior and inferior virtue, the two methods of action and non-action. This passage details the subtle use of the inferior virtue’s method of action. The inferior virtue is the way of action, returning acquired to primordial from within acquired. To return acquired to primordial, one must first know the true gold, the supreme medicine. This gold is not the mundane gold of the world, but our own inherent true knowing gold. This gold is forged by fire, enduring as long as Heaven and Earth, shining with sun and moon. Hence when the elixir is complete, it is called the Golden Elixir. In the furnace, the first work is to use gold as a dam and defense. The dam defends the gold’s birth of water. The damming gold produces water as a measure of entry. The water entering is not the flooding water, but the essence one water. The Dao of the elixir greatly concerns the use of gold; the use of water is no less important. The defense of gold lies in the skill of neither approaching too closely nor departing; the entering of water lies in the subtlety of neither haste nor delay. Neither approaching nor departing means life in death; neither haste nor delay means strength hidden in softness. To roam freely means calm and natural, resting to await labor, stillness to await movement. The subtlety of defending gold and entering water—none know better than those who know the root numbers of gold and water. The true knowing true gold, from one yang renewed, gradually reaches purity and fullness, round and bright, shining brilliantly like the fifteen moons, radiance filling the wheel, illuminating everywhere. The number taken is fifteen taels; this is the root number of gold. One part gold produces one part water; one tael gold produces one tael water. Like the moon’s sixteen days, one yin secretly grows. By the thirtieth day, the radiance vanishes, returning to black body; the number taken is likewise fifteen taels. Hence it says the gold counts to fifteen, the water’s number likewise. The method of using water has subtle uses and must not be used by the root number alone. For example, though the water’s root number is fifteen taels, when it grows to five parts, it is surplus water and must not enter; when it grows to two parts, it is essence one true water, just right to enter. True water can generate gold; it is the mother hidden in the child’s womb, the child repaying the mother’s grace. Gold does not leak qi, harming not the gold; thus gold weighs as at the beginning, not losing its fifteen taels root number. If water grows to three parts, it is also surplus and cannot enter. Scholars must know water has clear and turbid distinctions, and the difference between Ren and Gui. Ren water is clear, belonging to yang; Gui water is turbid, belonging to yin. Ren water has qi but no form, the essence one undivided true water; Gui water is pure yin with form, flooding and mixed with filth. Two parts water is like spring water just emerging, pure and clean—Ren water. Three parts water has flowed and gathered dust; five parts water flows far and is turbid—these are Gui water. The Dao of the elixir uses only the qi of water, not its form. Using the form harms the gold; using the qi supports the gold. Hence two parts water assist fifteen taels gold.

Yet to enter water truly, entering fire cannot be without timing. Fire is the spirit of emptiness and numinosity. Yin-yang harmonious qi, water uses two parts, fire must also use two parts. Two parts fire, like a newly kindled flame, warm but not dry, bright but without blaze. Water uses two parts, not losing the gold’s weight; fire uses two parts, not overpowering the gold’s body. Thus matched, water aids fire, fire does not parch; fire refines gold, gold produces brightness; gold generates water, water has root. Water and fire aid each other, gold and fire share the same palace; the three mutually contain and receive, transform and transmute, marvelously unfathomable. The three containing and receiving are three yet return to one.

Within the cauldron and furnace, medicine is fire, fire is medicine; medicine and fire give birth to each other, harmonious qi steams and pervades. Inside is the sun’s spiritual light, a single true fire forging. In a moment, true gold melts into liquid, gradually hardening. Changing white to yellow, called the Yellow Chariot. Yellow is the color of earth; chariot is the image of earth. Gold has dryness; meeting fire, dryness instantly disappears, hardness becomes softness, hardness and softness as one, yin and yang mixed, returning to the central and proper place, named Yellow Chariot, also called Golden Elixir. The sages cultivate the Great Elixir, gathering years into months, months into days, days into hours. Following the method, within one hour Heaven and Earth’s creation is utterly seized, yin and yang and the Five Phases utterly seized, myriad things’ qi and number utterly seized. The chance is rare and difficult; if off by a hair, lost by a thousand miles, nature is destroyed and lifespan harmed, gained then lost. At this time, one must greatly apply and manifest, outwardly observe its form—form without form; inwardly observe the heart—heart without heart. Form and body both forgotten, no smoke no fire, like ash like dust in a bright window. Pounding and blending together, hardness and softness both transformed, form and trace utterly vanished. Sent into the red gate, emptiness and numinosity not darkened, nothing escapes its illumination. Firmly sealing the junction, striving for completeness and solidity—returning elixir within one hour, warming and nurturing takes ten months. Firmly binding and sealing, never leaving for a moment, until the embryo is complete and spirit perfected, the warming and nurturing work must not cease. Fierce fire spreads below, day and night the sounds are diligent and true. There is the natural true fire, furnace blazing, all lines floating red. The initial literary method allows cultivation—one hour’s work, using literary fire to combine the elixir. In the end, martial is displayed—ten months’ warming and nurturing, using martial fire to refine oneself. Watching and waiting with utmost caution, watching the survival or loss of qi, careful and cautious, guarding against danger and worry. Carefully examining and adjusting cold and warmth, measuring the fire’s degree, neither dry nor cold, cooling and warming, harmonizing and balancing. Circling the twelve solar terms, when the term ends one must be even more attentive. Advancing the yang fire by day, moving the yin talisman by night, yin-yang talisman fire, cycling endlessly, work never ceases. When the qi thread of life is about to sever, rest, death of soul and spirit. When the work reaches its day, all vessels cease, qi and blood melt away, like a small death. At this time, the seven souls have departed, the three spirits have died, emotions, nature, and spirit condense without dispersing, like intoxicated and dazed, only the primordial one point of clear yang qi remains, and the dharma body is formed. This body is called the adamantine indestructible spirit, also called the pure dharma body, also called the purple-golden elixir. The Golden Elixir reaches purple, brilliant utmost yang, utterly without a trace of yin. Ah! This elixir is no larger than a powder, a grain, a blade wedge; its divine power and wondrous use can bring forth life from death, revive withered bones, open blind eyes to see again; those who take it immediately ascend to sage rank. This inferior virtue, the method of action, is the subtle secret of guarding existence from nonexistence. This passage comments on the meaning from “Know to guard the black” to “Always with people together.” Its commentary is even more detailed than the original text, revealing the subtlety of fire timing and greatly exposing Heaven’s secret. If the scholar thoroughly understands this passage, the wondrous use of elixir cultivation can be mostly grasped.

Ear, eye, and mouth—the three treasures—close and block, do not let them open and communicate. The true person sinks into the deep abyss, floating and roaming while guarding the rule within. Turning and bending to see and hear, opening and closing all in harmony, for oneself the pivot and control, motion and stillness never exhausted. The departing qi internally guards and defends; Kan does not use cleverness; Dui does not engage in speech; rare words follow the primordial chaos. The three once locked and barred, the body relaxes in the empty chamber. Surrender the will and return to emptiness and nothingness; no thoughts become the constant. The realization is difficult to shift; the heart focused without wandering. Sleeping and waking, spirit embraces, awake and asleep awaiting life and death. Color deepens with moisture, bones and joints grow stronger. Expel all yin evils, then establish correct yang. Cultivate without ceasing or resting, so that qi flows like clouds and rain. Flowing and moist like spring’s grace, liquid like melting ice, flowing from head to foot, finally returning to ascend. Coming and going without limit, quietly contained within. Reversal is the proof of the Dao; weakness is the handle of virtue. Cultivate the accumulated filth of kalpas, finely adjust the original primordial; though beginning turbid, ultimately clear; initially dark, over time bright. Gradually through the yellow center, principle is understood, moisture reaches the skin. Begin correct, then finish cultivation; standing firm, not yet able to hold. One conceals it, so the world knows it not.

Internal guard and defense (one version reads “glory and defense”), cultivate without ceasing or resting (one version reads “immediately rest”).

The previous passage spoke in detail of the method of action. This passage continues to speak of the essentials of non-action.

Non-action is the way of embracing the primordial and guarding the one, the matter of superior virtue. Though it is the matter of superior virtue, when the inferior virtue has the elixir in hand and the life foundation firm, it then joins the superior virtue in practice—having action to enter non-action. But guarding the center and embracing the one is not emptiness and non-action; within it is the power to preserve the primordial and transform the acquired. One must have all attachments cease, all dust not stain, body and mind greatly settled, then able to accomplish matters. Those with unsettled body and mind are all harmed by the three poisons of ear, eye, and mouth. The ear listens to sounds, the eye looks at colors, the mouth utters words; the body follows ear, eye, and mouth; the mind moves with sound, color, and speech. When the mind moves and the body moves, true nature is unclear; though the elixir is in hand, the dharma body is hard to free, hard to avoid yang’s excess producing yin, gaining then losing. If one closes and blocks the three poisons, not allowing them to open and communicate, the three poisons can transform into three treasures. Not only do they not harm, but they can bring blessing. Closing and blocking does not mean the cultivator closes eyes, mouth, and ears, but means “do not see what is improper, do not hear what is improper, do not speak what is improper.” Not seeing what is improper means the seer fully observes propriety, closing the improper eyes. Not hearing what is improper means the listener fully observes propriety, closing the improper ears. Not speaking what is improper means the speaker fully observes propriety, closing the improper mouth. To the extreme, seeing color without color, eyes closed; hearing sound without sound, ears closed; speaking only at proper times, mouth closed. If one can close and block these ears, eyes, and mouth, then inner thoughts cannot arise, external things cannot enter, body and mind do not move, the true person sinks into the deep abyss. No recognition, no knowing, motion and stillness as one, floating and roaming while guarding the rule within. The rule is to take the circle; the circle is the center; the center is the circle. Guarding the rule within means truly holding to the center. Sinking into the deep abyss means only essence, only one. Essence and one holding the center, body and mind do not move or sway.

Turning and bending to see and hear means turning the light back to illuminate, banishing cleverness and destroying wisdom, gathering and restraining spirit. Opening and closing all in harmony means the heart dies and spirit lives, closing evil and preserving sincerity, neither forgetting nor assisting. For oneself the pivot and control means the self is private desire, the pivot and control is to conquer the self. Motion and stillness never exhausted means whether moving or still, practice never stops. Departing qi internally guards and defends: Li is fire and spirit; fire moving makes spirit wild and anger arise; accepting it into guard and defense punishes anger and lowers heart fire, spirit then settles. Kan does not use cleverness: Kan is water and essence; water flooding makes essence shake and want to arise; not using cleverness means restraining desire and raising kidney water, essence then transforms. Dui is metal and emotion; its nature rules joy; metal is dry and emotion moves; heart rejoices and leaks qi. Speech is the voice of the heart; rare speech means heart is calm and emotion forgotten; with true joy yin and yang harmonize, one qi mingles and flows with primordial chaos. Li, Kan, and Dui together govern essence, qi, and spirit as the internal three treasures. Outside, ear, eye, and mouth close and block; inside, essence, qi, and spirit are calm. The internal and external three treasures can lock the key; then inner thoughts do not arise, external things do not enter, relaxing the true person’s body, dwelling in the empty chamber. Relaxing means neither approaching nor departing, resting to await labor. The empty chamber means a body in emptiness, not stubborn emptiness, but true emptiness. True emptiness is empty yet not empty; hence the next line: “Surrender the will and return to emptiness and nothingness; no thoughts become the constant.” Surrendering the will is not empty; no thoughts is yet emptiness. The elixir books say: “Only extinguish the moving heart, not extinguish the illuminating heart.” This is it. The realization is difficult to shift; the heart focused without wandering means focused heart and resolved will. Sleeping and waking, spirit embraces, awake and asleep awaiting life and death means not forgetting in sleep or waking. With such work, the six root gates have no leaks. Not only is the true person’s dharma body nourished, even the acquired illusory body becomes strong, color moistens, bones and joints strengthen, principle can be resolved. Expel all yin evils, then establish correct yang—when all yin is transformed, the Golden Elixir matures; without practice it will not be square or round. These two words have deep meaning; the ancient immortals said: “Not a hair of yang qi exhausted, no death; not a hair of yin qi exhausted, no immortality.” If even a little yin qi remains untransformed, it is like a root of disaster. Though the great way is in sight, it does not allow me to complete. Therefore, cultivators must cultivate to the place of pure yang without yin and then stop. Once able to expel all evils, correct yang stands firm and secure; from then on increase work without ceasing or resting, spirit clear and qi fresh, like clouds and rain moving, resolving dryness and removing vexation, moist and gentle like spring grace, cold qi all transformed, liquids like melting ice, accumulated stagnation suddenly dissolved. Flowing from head to foot means from beginning to end with subtle order. Finally returning to ascend means inversion and reversal, humbling to rise high. Coming and going without limit means one qi in use, heart firm and will distant. Quietly contained within means all things are empty, without self or worry. Reversal is the proof of the Dao; weakness is the handle of virtue. If able to cultivate the filth of kalpas, finely adjust the original primordial, though beginning turbid, ultimately clear; initially dark, over time bright. Gradually through the yellow center, principle is understood, moisture reaches the skin; sincerity within, reaching without, root and heart give birth to color, returning to the place where form and spirit are both wondrous.

This passage’s shallow meaning is deep; its demonstration and verification often use the illusory body as metaphor. In truth, it contains the secret of warming and nurturing the dharma body. Try the opening line “The true person sinks into the deep abyss, floating and roaming while guarding the rule within”—it shows that after action comes the way of non-action. If one only measures by refining the self, one greatly misses the Immortal Elder’s subtle meaning. The true person is the sacred embryo; just now refining the self, the true person has not yet manifested; how could they sink into the deep abyss and guard the rule within? Scholars must know this passage comments on the meaning of “Nourishing oneself within.” The four lines “Ear, eye, and mouth—the three treasures—close and block, do not let them open and communicate. The true person sinks into the deep abyss, floating and roaming while guarding the rule within” correspond to the original text’s “Nourishing oneself within, peaceful and void, originally hidden and bright, inwardly illuminating the form.” From “Turning and bending to see and hear” to “Then establish correct yang,” twenty lines correspond to “The three lights sink, warming and nurturing the child pearl.” From “Cultivate without ceasing or resting” to “Subtle and smooth adjustment,” twelve lines correspond to “Diligently practice, day and night without rest.” From “The turbid path to clarity” to “Moisture reaches the skin,” four lines correspond to “Conceal food three years” to “Long happiness without worry.”

As for the original text’s six lines “Dao completed, virtue fulfilled” and so forth, they are clear and easy to understand, so are not included here. Thus it is known this passage concerns cultivating life first, then cultivating nature. The ending points out “Begin correct then finish cultivation; turning and establishing, the end can be held,” making it even clearer. “Begin correct and turn to establish” means at first there is action to cultivate life; “finish cultivation and hold the end” means at the end non-action completes nature. Nature and life must both be cultivated; the work requires two stages. The superior virtue does not await cultivating life but immediately cultivates nature; practicing this stage of work, one can complete the great matter. The inferior virtue must first cultivate life then cultivate nature; when life is truly in hand, then practicing this stage of work, one enters the sage foundation. Hence it says “Begin correct then finish cultivation; turning and establishing, the end can be held.” But the superior virtue is non-action, the inferior virtue is action; one must know the primordial true one qi. The superior virtue’s non-action embraces the primordial and guards the one, that is guarding this one qi; the inferior virtue’s action returns acquired to primordial, that is returning this one qi. If one does not know the superior virtue’s non-action, one falls into emptiness and silence; if one does not know the inferior virtue’s action, one clings to illusion. Action is not action, non-action is not non-action. The so-called knowing the one and all things are finished is precisely this. If cultivators do not meet a wise master, this one qi is hidden within the acquired and unseen—how can they know? Therefore it says “One conceals it, so the world knows it not.” Scholars, can you not urgently seek a true master?
