# Commentary and Annotations on the Cantong Qi, Part Two

Tracing the numbers of the Five Phases, the calculation is concise yet not cumbersome. Consider water stirring fire—suddenly, the radiant light is extinguished. The sun and moon eclipse each other, ever present between the new and full moons. When water overflows in Kan, it invades Yang; when fire wanes in Li, the daylight dims. Yin and yang feed and drink one another, their mutual resonance unfolding naturally along the dao. Names fix the sentiment; characters express the nature. When metal returns to its original nature, then it is rightly called the Golden Elixir. I dare not speak falsely but follow the pattern of the sages’ writings. Ancient records label it the Dragon-Tiger Elixir; the Yellow Emperor praises the splendid metal radiance. Huainan refines the Autumn Stone; Jade Yang adds the Yellow Sprout. The worthy can hold and practice it; the unworthy, do not accompany them. The dao of old and new is one and the same, spoken face to face in counsel. Scholars, redouble your efforts; keep it in mind and ponder deeply. The essential words are laid bare, shining clearly without deceit.

The way of the Golden Elixir is the way of harmonizing yin and yang. When yin and yang harmonize, the elixir is born; when they oppose, the dao is lost. By tracing the numbers of the Five Phases’ generation and overcoming, one immediately understands the way of the Golden Elixir—concise and not complex. For example, when water is raised to stir fire, the fire is extinguished—water overcomes fire. The sun wanes at the new moon, yin prevailing over yang; the moon thins at the full, yang prevailing over yin. Likewise, the moon’s body is rich in water, and the yang light wanes; the sun’s color is fire’s decline, and the white daylight dims. All these are signs of yin and yang estranged, solitary, unable to aid one another. But if yin and yang respond to each other, mutually resonating with the times, the dao unfolds naturally—what harm could there be?

Human true nature belongs to yang; true sentiment belongs to yin. Originally, yin and yang are one qi; nature and sentiment harmonize, blending into the celestial principle. Not knowing, not perceiving—this is the rule of Heaven. Not knowing, not perceiving, is the substance of nature; following Heaven’s rule is the function of sentiment. Nature and sentiment arise naturally, all from the unintentional. These two come forth together but bear different names, like a name with characters. The name fixes the sentiment, sentiment compares to the name; the character expresses the nature, nature compares to the character. Name and character together denote one thing—how could nature and sentiment be two separate entities? After the mingling of the later heaven, true contains false; yin and yang separate; nature and sentiment oppose each other. Water overflows in Kan, invading yang; fire wanes in Li, and daylight darkens. True sentiment becomes false sentiment; true nature becomes false nature. The way of the Golden Elixir is to trace sentiment to harmonize nature, seek truth within falsehood, find life within death, so yin and yang unite again, returning to the original celestial principle, the unknowing, unperceiving, following Heaven’s rule—this is called the Returning Elixir. Returning Elixir means returning to what was originally present, neither added nor diminished; also called returning to the origin and restoring the root. I dare not speak falsely, imitating the sages’ words—this is the Immortal Elder’s own account, a discourse with foundation, not baseless talk. This Returning Elixir, ancient sages named it variously: ancient records call it the “Dragon-Tiger Elixir,” the Yellow Emperor calls it “Splendid Metal Completion,” Huainan calls it “Autumn Stone,” Jade Yang calls it “Yellow Sprout,” the Cantong Qi calls it “Golden Sand” or “Knife Jade.” All are metaphors describing the one Returning Elixir. This dao, when heard by the superior, they diligently practice it—thus it is said the worthy can hold and practice. The inferior laugh and leave it—thus it is said the unworthy do not accompany. Why say the dao of old and new is one, spoken face to face in counsel? The great dao of the Golden Elixir has been passed mouth to mouth, heart to heart, from generation to generation. They converse, revealing their plans—this is true knowledge and insight, not wild guessing or private opinion. Though attainment of the dao may come earlier or later, the cultivation is one and the same, just as the Cantong Qi’s principle. The two elders Wei and Xu studied under Yin Zhenren; what one wrote, the other confirmed; what one proved, the other verified—all in mutual discourse and counsel. How could this be false? If scholars can diligently ponder, suddenly grasp the essentials, plunging into the cave of principle, it is like the Immortal Elder’s own discourse—practice diligently, and surely attain the dao. Then the Immortal Elder will not deceive us. Alas, how many fools of the world mistake the Cantong Qi for mere furnace fire refining ordinary sand and mercury, thus betraying the Immortal Elder’s heartfelt writing, slandering the sacred dao, truly sowing seeds of hell, yet without repentance, still calling themselves cultivators of truth—are they not ashamed to die? This section annotates the passage “Only the ancient sages…”

Cinnabar thrown into fire loses its color and becomes lead again. Ice and snow warmed by hot water dissolve into the Great Mystery. Gold is chiefly composed of sand, tempered by mercury. Transformation follows its truth; beginning and end depend on each other. To craft the concealed food immortal, one should use like with like. Planting grain requires seed; raising chickens requires eggs. Like supports like in nature; things become easy to mold. Fish eyes cannot become pearls; wild weeds do not become fine wood. Like attracts like; unlike cannot form treasure. Swallows and sparrows do not give birth to phoenixes; foxes and rabbits do not nurse horses. Water flows downward, not upward; fire moves upward, not downward. The world is full of scholars, proud of their fine talents. But chance meetings do not bring opportunity; they waste fire and lose wealth. According to the text, they wrongly act by intention. Without cause or reason, their measure is lost. They pound Qiang stone gall, mica, and alum; burn sulfur in Yuzhang; refine mud and mercury together. Beneath the drum, five stones and copper serve as auxiliary pivots. Mixed natures of different kinds—how can they dwell in one body? Thousands of attempts must fail; cleverness turns to folly. Fortune does not favor them; only the sage knows. From youth to old age, doubts arise midway. Turning away from the dao, guarding the confused path, leaving the right and entering the wrong trail. Peering through a narrow tube, unable to see broadly—how can one measure the way?

The previous section stated “metal returns to its nature,” thus called Returning Elixir. If one abandons nature and sentiment, using myriad things unlike oneself to preserve life and body, how could that be reasonable? Consider cinnabar—black lead burned, thrown into fire, still becomes lead. Ice and snow are water’s cold form; warmed, they dissolve back to water. Cinnabar is mercury transformed; exposed to fire, it reverts to mercury. Gold mixed with mercury turns white; exposed to fire, it returns to yellow. All such things transform according to their true nature. Therefore, at the start, one substance can transform into another; at the end, the other can transform back—beginning and end are the same, making the work easier. How could one desire to make the concealed food immortal without using like substances? How could one succeed otherwise?

“Concealed” means to conceal the prior heaven’s qi, not to move the mind recklessly. This is what Mencius called “I am good at nourishing my vast qi.” “Food” means to seek the real from the empty, the meaning of a full belly. Mencius said, “This qi is vast and strong; nourishing it straightforwardly and harmlessly fills the space between Heaven and Earth.” Nourishing vast qi until it fills Heaven and Earth, unrestrained by creation, unmovable by all things—this is concealed food. Humans are born with one point of vast correct qi; to become complete, they must conceal and nourish this vast correct qi, not consume all dissimilar things. For example, planting grain requires seed; raising chickens requires eggs; like supports like in nature, and things come to fruition without conflict. Fish eyes do not become pearls; wild weeds do not become fine wood; swallows and sparrows do not give birth to phoenixes; foxes and rabbits do not nurse horses. Water does not flow upward; fire does not moisten downward. When sentiment and nature differ, how can they aid each other? Many scholars of the world, proud of their talents, seek no true master. Hearing of the Golden Elixir, they doubt it to be furnace fire refining. According to ancient texts, they speculate wildly, losing control, wasting wealth, pounding five metals and eight stones, foolishly hoping to consume them for longevity. They do not know these mixed natures are unlike themselves; how could they dwell in the body? Thousands of attempts, ten thousand failures, no repentance, still harbor foolish hopes, claiming luck has not met them, their blessings shallow, dying without regret. Alas! Such people forget their original intention, doubts arise midway, leaving the right path for the wrong, deceiving themselves and others, thinking they have gained. Writing books and setting theories on side doors and heterodox ways, leading the blind by the blind, peering through tubes and measuring with a ladle—how can they gauge the true way? This section annotates the passage “The Lady of the River Above…”

Metal cast into fierce fire does not lose its pure radiance. Since the opening of Heaven and Earth, sun and moon have not diminished their brightness. Metal does not lose its weight; sun and moon keep their usual forms. Metal originally comes from the moon; at new moon dawn, the sun grants its seal. Metal returns to its mother; at moon’s dark, the sun embraces it. Concealing its boundaries, sinking into the cavernous void. Metal restores its original nature; the majestic radiance of the cauldron is the feast.

The previous section said, to make the concealed food immortal, one should use like with like. What is like with like? It is the true nature of the heavenly goodness originally possessed by us, fallen into the later heaven, that is, the true knowledge and sentiment arising from the dao heart. This sentiment belongs to metal in the Five Phases; the alchemical texts all call it true metal. This metal endures ten thousand kalpas without decay, the ladder of sages, the seed of immortals and Buddhas. To understand nature and life, abandoning this true metal, there is no other method. Consider common metal in the world: its nature is firm and strong, its body most solid; entering fire, it is refined and brightened. This is what is called true metal unafraid of fire. The essence and radiance of metal’s color are not lost to fierce fire, just as the sun and moon’s brilliance is not diminished by their illumination. Since the beginning of creation, all things are born and perish, exist and vanish, but only sun and moon keep their forms unchanged. Metal’s weight endures long and unbroken; thus metal shares the same brightness and longevity as sun and moon. Such is metal; thus true metal is known.

True metal’s true knowledge is the sentiment without sentiment, true emptiness containing wondrous being, not attached to form or color, existence or nonexistence. It is yang within yin, manifesting as moonlight—thus it is said metal originally comes from the moon. Metal born from the moon means the Golden Elixir’s workings should follow the moon’s waxing and waning, advance and retreat. The moon is pure yin, reflecting the sun’s light and producing radiance—the radiance is metal’s image. When the moon is new, the sun comes to grant the seal; the moon receives the sun’s light and conceives thunder. On the third day, one yang appears on the earth of Kun—this is metal returning to its mother. Earth can produce metal; thus Kun earth is metal’s mother. Metal returns to the mother, called “southwest gaining friends.” From one yang, two yang, three yang, the fifteen radiances fill and overflow; at sixteen, one yin is conceived within, until thirty dark, northeast loses friends. The sun envelops the moon’s body, becoming pure Kun, concealing the boundaries, sinking and vanishing into the cavernous void. Compare this to the cultivator: in utmost emptiness and deep stillness, true knowledge and spiritual knowledge unite; suddenly a point of true spiritual light appears. This light is called divine brightness, also called white within black, gold within water, the primordial true one qi. Like the moon borrowing the sun’s light, one yang is born on Kun earth, emerging subtly, its radiance full and perfect, the true spirit ever present. Using the ten-month nurturing work, guarding against danger and worry, gathering spirit, not revealing edges or corners, hiding and sinking, returning to the land of no-thingness. Just like moonlight fading without trace, sun and moon embrace as one.

Metal restores its original nature—true knowledge’s sentiment and spiritual knowledge’s nature blend and unite; sentiment returns to nature, nature fixes sentiment and forgets it, unknowing and unperceiving, following Heaven’s rule. Metal returns to its origin. The majestic radiance of the cauldron is the feast; feast is the fire’s color. When sentiment returns to nature, nature loves sentiment; sentiment is nature, nature is sentiment, good knowing and good ability, silent and unmoving, responding and thus communicating, spiritual knowledge not darkened, fire returns to its root. Metal returns to origin, fire returns to root; metal and fire share the same chamber. The medicine is fire; fire is medicine. In the furnace, a brilliant line of red floats—this is called the majestic radiance of the cauldron’s feast. Cauldron is called light, the empty spiritual cauldron; light is called majesty, the strong and vigorous light. Strong and vigorous, empty and spiritual, with qi but no substance, nothing in the ten directions can harm it. True metal returns to its original nature. This section annotates the passage from “The sun flows pearls” to “Condensed and solidified.”

The fire record is not falsely made; it explains the Yi to clarify it. The crescent moon method for furnace and cauldron, the White Tiger as the roasting pivot. Mercury sun as flowing pearls, the Azure Dragon accompanies it. Raising east to join west, soul and spirit bind each other. The upper string is the number eight of Dui; the lower string is also eight of Gen. Two strings combine their essence; the bodies of Qian and Kun are thus formed. Two eights correspond to one jin; the Yi dao is upright and unshaken.

The previous section nurtured metal and fire in the same chamber; metal restores its original nature. Yet metal restoring its nature is the operation of the Yin Talisman. If the work is incomplete, it cannot be square or round. The fire record not falsely made, explaining the Yi, means fire is truly no fire, relying on the qi of yin and yang harmonizing as fire. Yin and yang have cycles of fullness and emptiness, waxing and waning—this is why the sage made the fire record. Its words are not empty talk but based on the Yi’s hexagrams and lines, their auspiciousness, misfortune, regret, and blame. The Yi’s Kan hexagram symbolizes the moon; the moon belongs to water. The moon lies beneath the pure yin of southwest, with slight yang emerging, called metal in water, its radiance reclining and rising—thus called crescent moon. This is the mechanism of yang advancing and yin receding, so the symbol of the crescent moon is taken for furnace and cauldron, not Kan itself. The crescent moon’s light arises from the west, so the symbol is metal, the White Tiger, representing sentiment in humans. Metal generates water; the tiger can bite, representing false sentiment; water generates metal; the tiger can protect, representing true sentiment. When true sentiment is found, water does not flood but returns to origin, and true essence is born. Thus the White Tiger is true sentiment, the pivot of refining true water. This is the Five Phases inverted use—the tiger is born in water. The Yi’s Li hexagram symbolizes the sun; the sun belongs to fire, symbolizing flowing pearls. Fire is born of wood; fire contains wood qi; the symbol is the Azure Dragon, representing nature in humans. Wood generates fire; the dragon can harm, representing qi nature; fire generates wood; the dragon can nurture, representing true nature. When true nature is found, fire does not blaze but returns to root; thus the sun’s Azure Dragon accompanies it. The Five Phases are not in usual order; the dragon emerges from fire. Dragon nature belongs to yang as soul; tiger sentiment belongs to yin as spirit. Metal born in water; wood born in fire; true sentiment and true nature meet; soul and spirit bind each other, never parting. Soul and spirit bind; yin contains yang, like Kan, like the moon’s upper crescent metal eight liang; yang contains yin, like Li, like the moon’s lower crescent water half jin. Strength and softness both return to balance; metal and water rest together; water and fire aid each other; true nature and true sentiment, two strings of qi, unite as one, returning to Qian’s firmness and Kun’s softness, the Yi’s simplicity, good knowing, and good ability’s essence, accompanying Heaven and matching Earth. The Golden Elixir condenses, the foundation of life firmly set.

This is the Yi’s principle of transformation, thus precious and unshaken. This section annotates the passage from “Metal radiance first sings” to “How dare it make a sound.”

People of the world love petty arts, not discerning the dao’s depth. They abandon the right for the crooked path, seeking speed but blocked and unconnected. Like the blind not recognizing the staff, the deaf hearing only the musical notes Shang and Gong. Casting nets in water to catch pheasants and rabbits; climbing mountains to seek fish and dragons. Planting wheat to harvest millet; using a compass to seek square. Exhausting effort and spirit, all year without seeing results. To know the concealed food method, the matter is simple and not complex.

The previous section said harmonizing yin and yang, the fire’s timing must accord with the Yi’s principle to accomplish great matters. If one goes against the Yi’s principle, it is not the dao. The ancient immortals said: “Form is perfected by the dao; life is prolonged by technique.” The technique of prolonging life can steal yin and yang, seize creation, turn heaven and earth, move sun and moon, reverse the Dipper’s handle, twist the mechanism of qi, position Heaven and Earth, nurture all things—this is the greatest technique in the cave of ancient and modern principles. Only those born wise from Heaven can practice it. All other fools and confused people, not discerning the dao’s depth, love petty arts, abandon the right for the wrong, enter side doors, like the blind not recognizing the staff, the deaf not hearing the tone, catching pheasants and rabbits in water, seeking fish and dragons on mountains, planting wheat to harvest millet, using the compass to seek square—these all waste spirit and effort in vain. How could they know the immortal concealed food great method is simple and not complex, and within one hour the elixir is surely formed? This section annotates the passage from “Not grasping the principle” to “Contrary to the dao.”

The numbers Zi and Wu combine to three; Wu and Ji are called five. When three and five harmonize, the eight stones form the proper order. Breathing mutually nurtures; inhaling and exhaling are husband and wife. Yellow earth is the father of metal; flowing pearl water is the son. Water regards earth as ghost; earth restrains water from rising. Vermilion Bird is fire’s essence, holding balance to regulate victory and defeat. When water is abundant, fire is extinguished; both perish and return to thick earth. The three natures unite; original nature shares the common ancestor.

The previous section proposed the concealed food method, simple and not complex. What method is it? It is the method of harmonizing the Five Phases, blending into one. Zi belongs to Kan; Kan is water; Wu belongs to Li; Li is fire.

Kan receives Wu; Li receives Ji. Kan is solid inside—true knowledge; Wu is the trust of true knowledge. Li is hollow inside—spiritual knowledge; Ji is the trust of spiritual knowledge. Kan one, Li two; numbers combine to three; Wu and Ji, the scholar and gentleman, dwell in the center, their number called five. Outside, Kan fills Li with true one water to aid spiritual bright fire; inside, Wu flows to Ji with strong and firm trust, uniting gentle and compliant intent. This is three and five in harmony. When three and five harmonize, the prior heaven’s nature, sentiment, and spirit govern the later heaven’s spirit and soul; the eight trigrams’ yin and yang are fixed; creation’s order and law are correct. The eight stones are the images of the eight trigrams. Yang is the law; yin is the regulation. Kan and Li are the use of the eight trigrams. When Kan and Li harmonize, the other six trigrams’ yin and yang also follow and harmonize, each obtaining its correctness. When law and regulation are established, one movement is breath; breath generates yang; one stillness is inhale; inhale generates yin. One yin one yang, movement and stillness relate; breath and qi communicate, mutually nurturing; sentiment and nature harmonize; waiting and resting become husband and wife. The prior heaven’s qi comes from emptiness and nothingness, condensing into one grain of pearl. This section annotates the passage from “Cinnabar wood essence” to “All return to Wu and Ji.”

Water, fire, and earth—all are essential substances within the dao. When the three unite, the elixir is born, the sage is born, and the prior heaven is restored. When the three separate, life and beings arise, falling into the later heaven. Earth can produce metal; water can produce wood. Earth produces metal; thus yellow earth is metal’s father. Water produces wood; thus flowing pearl is water’s son. Why can earth produce metal? Using Li’s Ji hollow spiritual true intent, to overcome Kan’s muddy water, to seek true knowledge’s metal sentiment—thus earth restrains water from rising. Why can water produce wood? Using Kan’s essence of true water, to overcome Li’s fierce flame, to preserve spiritual knowledge’s wood nature—thus water overflows and fire is extinguished. What is strange is that water extinguishes fire, yet earth restrains water? Fire regulates victory and defeat, yet water extinguishes fire? This is because water has mixed water and pure water; fire has fierce flame and gentle fire. Earth restrains the mixed water; water extinguishes the fierce flame. When mixed water dries, pure water is born; when fierce flame dies, gentle fire appears. Both perish and return to thick earth—earth restrains water; water dries and mud becomes earth; water extinguishes fire; fire dies and ashes become earth. Mutual generation and overcoming—within overcoming is generation. True knowledge and spiritual knowledge unite; true sentiment and true nature share one qi; strength and softness both return to balance, like the meeting of the black rabbit on the yellow path. The medicine is fire; fire is medicine; water, fire, and earth three surnames are one family, forming one grain of millet Golden Elixir, sharing a common ancestor.

Yin and yang unite—only then is it called the common ancestor. If yin and yang do not unite, there is still solitude and separation; it is not the scene of one complete qi; it cannot be called the common ancestor. The original text “Containing primordial emptiness and precariousness, sowing essence into the seed” reveals this mystery. Emptiness and precariousness are the meeting place of yin and yang, also the place where sun and moon unite and move in accord, thus primordial essence is present. Primordial essence is another name for the Golden Elixir, also called the common ancestor. This section annotates the passage from “Strength and softness alternate rising” to “Sowing essence into the seed.”

Great victory still prolongs life; the Returning Elixir can be taken by mouth. Metal’s nature does not decay or rot, thus it is the treasure of all things. The technique master conceals food; life is prolonged. Earth roams through the four seasons, guarding boundaries and rules. Golden sand enters the five viscera; mist disperses like wind and rain. Steaming penetrates the limbs; the complexion is joyful and lustrous. White hair all turns black; fallen teeth regrow. Old men become vigorous youths; aged women become immortal maidens. Changing form, escaping worldly calamities, called True Person.

The way of the Golden Elixir, once obtained, is forever obtained; supremely numinous and divine, immediate and manifest. Those who know it cross directly to the far shore. Alas, many in the world lack faith, thinking such things cannot exist. Consider Great Victory—an object of later heaven’s form and dross; if taken long, it can prolong life. How much more the Golden Elixir, the prior heaven’s supreme treasure, once refined and ingested—how could it not grant longevity? All metal’s nature is firm and strong, enduring long without decay, the treasure of all things. True metal’s qi is pure yang—how could concealed food not produce immortals? Earth arises from the four seasons; the four times and eight festivals follow rules and cycles, naturally flowing without cease. When people take golden sand, their limbs and body change color and form, naturally escaping disaster and calamity. If a determined person obtains a master’s secret instructions, they will naturally enter non-action, understand nature and life, body and spirit both wondrous, united with the dao’s truth, called True Person, with lifespan equal to Heaven’s. As for firm limbs, joyful complexion, white hair turning black, teeth falling and regrowing—these are but other matters. This section annotates the passage “Like carefully encountering…”

The Immortal Elder’s three-part commentary carefully embraces Boyang’s intent, revealing what the Cantong Qi did not. Among them, no single herb or fire timing is omitted. Only fearing people lack the will or great blessing, thus cannot see the truth. The preface says: “Only those who understand the great image will surely attain longevity.” The Immortal Elder does not deceive me!
