# Direct Exposition on the Three Phases in the Cantong Qi

The Cantong Qi, the “Kinship of the Three,” unfolds its broad outline, yet cannot achieve pure unity; it speaks in sweeping generalities, its subtle details left incomplete, its gaps and omissions vague and indistinct. Now, once more, it is compiled and gathered, to fill the lost and neglected. Polished and deepened, its threads carefully traced and connected, its meaning balanced and aligned, its direction unerring—thus this work is made anew, named *Three Phases in Kinship*. 

The Great Change’s nature and temperament vary, each according to its measure. The teachings of the Yellow Emperor and Laozi, when examined, prove capable of mastery and control. The matter of the furnace fire truly has its foundation. The three paths arise from one source, each issuing forth its own course. Branches, stems, blossoms, leaves, fruits hanging and spreading—all rest upon the root and trunk, never losing their essence. What is spoken with sincere heart is scrutinized and free from error.

The Three Phases are: one, the great nature and temperament of the *Great Change*; two, the arts of the Yellow Emperor and Laozi; three, the matter of the furnace fire. The three paths arise from one source, hence the name *Three Phases in Kinship*. The term “kinship” also carries the meaning of fitting together in harmony.
