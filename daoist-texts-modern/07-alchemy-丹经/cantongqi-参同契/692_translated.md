# The Direct Instruction on the Three Aspects of the Cantong Qi, Part One

No image of the dharma is greater than Heaven and Earth,  
The mysterious channel stretches tens of thousands of li.  
The River Drum aligns with the Star Registry,  
And all the people are struck with awe and fear.  
The shadow of the sun’s eclipse falsely advances and retreats,  
For nine years calamity and misfortune prevail.  
The august sovereign surveys these signs,  
And the kings withdraw, repentant and changed.  
There is a crucial gate that rises and falls,  
Through which harmful qi flees in all directions.  
The rivers and streams dry up,  
Their waters flowing into the sea.

The Way of the Golden Elixir is most profound and deep,  
Most divine and wondrous, silently harmonizing Heaven and Earth,  
Quietly communicating with creation itself.  
It can enter the formless from the formed,  
And from no image bring forth image.  
Thus, since ancient times, immortals and perfected ones  
Have observed the heavenly talismans above,  
And investigated the earth’s principles below,  
Secretly borrowing yin and yang,  
Seizing upon creation’s power,  
Preserving life and perfecting the great dao.  
The Immortal Elders first revealed the dharma image through Heaven and Earth,  
Because the great dao is formless, yet Heaven and Earth have form—  
Form is the manifestation of the formless,  
Reality is shown through emptiness.  
And the way of emptiness and non-being  
Is clearly visible in the images.  
An image is a likeness,  
Meaning this thing resembles that thing.  
Dharma means to imitate the pattern.  
Dharma image means imitating this image.  
The images of Heaven and Earth are the greatest and most manifest,  
Easy to see and easy to know.  
Consider how Heaven and Earth are suspended and separated,  
Unknown how many tens of thousands of li apart,  
Yet before the earth’s auspicious or inauspicious events arise,  
The celestial changes above already hang in the sky.  
When the movement of the heavenly qi shifts even slightly,  
Earthly regrets and calamities immediately follow.  
Why is this so?  
Because this responds to that,  
Form is separated, but qi is connected.

The mysterious channel is the hollow space above the earth throughout the world.  
Because it is vast and boundless, mysterious and unfathomable, it is called the mysterious channel.  
The River Drum and Star Registry are names of stars.  
The River Drum positioned at the Star Registry’s place  
Does not follow the proper degrees;  
The sun’s shadow in eclipse falsely advances and retreats,  
Losing its true path.  
Both are reversals of the norm.  
When the norm is reversed, droughts and floods arise,  
As well as calamities of war, pestilence, and disaster—none fail to come.  
Thus the emperors and kings see these signs,  
And retire to repent and turn back,  
To turn Heaven’s heart aright.  
Compare this to the beginning of human life,  
When nature and temperament are pure and unified,  
Yin and yang harmonize;  
By the age of sixteen, one nurtures a pure yang body—  
This is called the person of highest virtue.  
At this time, unless one is a sage born of Heaven’s favor,  
How many can preserve this single point of true yang qi?  
All ordinary people follow creation’s course,  
Yang reaches its extreme and gives birth to yin,  
Yin grows and the former Heaven changes into the latter Heaven.  
Yang gradually wanes, yin gradually grows,  
Indulging feelings and desires, abandoning the true for the false—  
This is called the Five Phases following their course,  
The fiery pit of the dharma realm.  
It is like stars moving from their proper places,  
Or the sun’s shadow in eclipse wandering falsely—  
Calamity immediately arrives.  
But the perfected person  
Draws from things afar, draws from the body near,  
Practices the Way of the Golden Elixir with effort,  
Returns to the root and restores the origin.  
What is called the reversal of the Five Phases,  
The seven treasures of the great earth,  
Is like the emperor who divines the signs and governs,  
Renewing and reforming,  
Turning misfortune into blessing,  
Uprooting chaos and restoring order.

The gate is the iron gate outside the door,  
The key is the wooden key inside the door.  
Where there is gate and key, thieves and harmful qi flee afar.  
Where the dao has gate and key, yin demons and evil spirits self-destruct.  
Why?  
Because the gate guards the inside,  
The key guards the outside.  
Guarding outside means guarding against guest qi from without;  
Guarding inside means guarding against selfish desires born within.  
When inside and outside are tightly sealed,  
Inner thoughts do not escape,  
Outer evils cannot enter.  
Yin gradually retreats, yang gradually grows,  
The Four Symbols harmonize,  
The Five Phases gather.  
Like rivers and streams, many waters  
All flow toward the sea,  
Without scattering or running astray.  
The sage said: “One day of conquering oneself and returning to ritual,  
The world returns to benevolence.”  
This is the wondrous secret of the true gate and key,  
The effect of turning back and changing.

Heaven and Earth’s female and male,  
Wander between the Rat and Horse hours.  
The Yin and Yang ancestors are the Tiger and Monkey hours,  
Entering and exiting, renewing and beginning again.  
Following the Dipper and shaking its light,  
Holding the balance to fix the primal measure.

(The term “shaking light” here is also read as “shaking summon,” not the star in the Dipper, and cannot fix the primal measure. It should be “shaking light,” as now interpreted.)

Above it says the dharma image is taken from Heaven and Earth,  
That is the Way of the Golden Elixir, the Way of Heaven and Earth.  
The Way of Heaven and Earth is the Way of one yin and one yang.  
Heaven is male, yang; Earth is female, yin.  
Yang is born at the Rat hour, reaches its peak at the Snake;  
Yin is born at the Horse hour, reaches its peak at the Pig.  
One day and one night, the Rat and Horse rotate,  
This is called the female and male of Heaven and Earth wandering between Rat and Horse.  
At the summer solstice, the sun rises at the Tiger and sets at the Dog;  
At the winter solstice, the sun rises at the Dragon and sets at the Monkey.  
After the summer solstice, the sun gradually moves south;  
After the winter solstice, the sun gradually moves north,  
Ending and beginning again—this is called the Tiger and Monkey Yin and Yang ancestors,  
Entering and exiting, renewing and beginning again.  
The shaking light is the guiding star of the Northern Dipper,  
Also called the Heavenly Gang star, also called the Breaking Army star.  
Where the Heavenly Gang sits is ominous,  
Where it points is auspicious.  
If the lunar month is at the Rat, it sits at the Horse and points to the Rat,  
Water is strong and fire weak;  
If the lunar month is at the Horse, it sits at the Rat and points to the Horse,  
Fire is strong and water weak.  
All twelve months are like this, sitting and pointing,  
One year completes one full cycle.  
The sixth star of the Northern Dipper is the balance star,  
The gang star is in front, the balance star behind,  
Moving through the four seasons and carrying out creation.  
Thus the sun follows the Dipper and shaking light,  
Holding the balance to fix the primal measure.

If the student can know the time of yin and yang arising in their own body,  
The degrees of entering and exiting,  
Twisting the gang star,  
Turning the Dipper’s handle,  
Then Heaven’s gate is in hand,  
Earth’s axis is in the heart.  
Gathering herbs according to time,  
Diligently practicing and refining,  
Restoring the former Heaven’s origin,  
It is not difficult.  
But this gang star is not easy to know, nor easy to see.  
If not pointed out by a true master, who dares to speak at length?  
It is said: “The sun and moon always add the Dog,  
At all times one sees the Breaking Army.  
The star before Breaking Army,  
Swears never to be passed on to others.”  
The gang star is also called Breaking Army,  
The star before Breaking Army is the direction it points to.  
The direction it points to holds the primal true unity qi,  
The ancestral qi of all living things.  
Since ancient times, immortals and perfected ones  
All gather this one qi,  
To complete life and nature.  
What is called “obtaining the one and all things are finished”  
Is this one qi.  
The alchemical scriptures and writings do not dare directly point to what the gang star is,  
Or where this one qi is,  
Fearing it may fall into the hands of the unworthy,  
And bring Heaven’s punishment.  
The bold Master Wuyuan now as the patriarch faithfully transmits and writes the spirit,  
Slightly revealing Heaven’s secret.  
If there are aspirants who see this,  
Their hearts will silently understand,  
This is shown by ghosts and spirits,  
Not the fault of Wuyuan.

Our true gang star is nothing else,  
But the true knowledge of the Dao-heart.  
True knowledge possesses the primal utmost yang qi.  
This qi governs yin and yang,  
Contains the Five Phases,  
Is the root of nature and life,  
The source of dao and virtue.  
Hidden, it is true nature;  
Manifested, it is true feeling.  
Nature and feeling both are the utmost truth.  
Its division into nature and feeling is only by movement and stillness.  
This qi originally belongs to my household,  
But because it falls into the latter Heaven, it falsely conceals its truth.  
True knowledge is obscured,  
Wisdom is used externally,  
Delusions arise within,  
Fox friends and dog companions,  
True knowledge turns into false knowledge,  
Vital qi turns into killing qi.  
The primal qi does not belong to me.  
Like my household’s possessions, lost to another’s home,  
The gang star sits with me, but points to another.  
Now to return to the primal Heaven,  
One must steal it from another’s home.  
The method of stealing is to seek life within killing,  
True feeling within delusion.  
True feeling emerges and true knowledge appears,  
True knowledge appears and the light returns to shine.  
The gang star points inward, not outward,  
Vital qi gathers inside and does not scatter outside,  
Can harmonize the Four Symbols,  
Can gather the Five Phases,  
Can complete nature and life,  
Can perfect the great dao.  
But fear that people lack resolve,  
Do not expend heart and mind to exhaust principle,  
Do not exert effort to seek truth,  
And so cannot personally see the gang star.  
Ah! It can be spoken to those who know,  
But is difficult to say to those who do not.

Ascending and boiling on the Zeng Mountain,  
The blazing fire is set below.  
The White Tiger leads the chant in front,  
The Azure Liquid harmonizes behind.  
The Vermilion Bird soars and plays,  
Flying colors of five hues.  
Encountering the net’s snare,  
Pressed down, unable to rise.  
Crying out with sorrowful wails,  
Like an infant yearning for its mother.  
Upside down into the boiling cauldron,  
Feathers and fur crushed and broken.

Having known the balance of creation,  
One must harmonize the Four Symbols and Five Phases.  
The Zeng is the vessel that stores water.  
Zeng Mountain is the cauldron.  
The blazing fire is the furnace.  
Ascending and boiling on Zeng Mountain means water is above.  
The blazing fire set below means fire is beneath.  
Water above, fire below,  
With the essence of true unity,  
Nourishing the void and spiritual numinous,  
Water and fire mutually assist.  
The White Tiger in the west is metal,  
It is true feeling;  
The Azure Dragon in the east is wood,  
It is true nature.  
The Azure Liquid is the essence of wood nature,  
Metal feeling is rigid, wood nature is soft,  
Metal overcomes wood, wood fears metal.  
The White Tiger leads the chant in front,  
Metal feeling loves wood’s kindness,  
Pushing feeling to harmonize with nature.  
The Azure Liquid harmonizes behind,  
Wood nature loves metal’s obedience and righteousness,  
Seeking feeling through nature.  
Driving the tiger to the dragon,  
With the dragon approaching the tiger,  
Nature and feeling unite,  
Metal and wood come together.  
The Vermilion Bird is the image of fire.  
Among the Four Symbols, fire is the most numinous,  
Its nature loves to fly,  
If slightly offended,  
It soars and ascends,  
Displaying five-colored brilliance.  
Water, fire, metal, and wood  
All suffer injury from it.  
The alchemist must first subdue and tame this one thing,  
Only then can it serve.  
Encountering the net’s snare,  
Pressed down, unable to rise,  
Means fully refining one’s own功,  
Punishing anger and restraining desire,  
Not allowing fire to move recklessly.  
The sorrowful cries like an infant yearning for its mother,  
Means fire does not move recklessly,  
Its dryness is digested,  
Fire returns to its source,  
Spirit relies on nature.  
Upside down into the boiling cauldron,  
Feathers and fur crushed and broken,  
Means refining oneself until no self remains,  
Evil fire descends, true water rises,  
Water and fire steam and blend,  
Qi and essence both transform,  
The Four Symbols harmonize,  
From this one can refine the great medicine.

The water clock has not passed half,  
Fish scales and fins rise.  
Five colors shine and dazzle,  
Change and unpredictability reign.  
The cauldron boils and rushes,  
Violently surging without cease.  
Layers upon layers piled,  
Like dog teeth interlocking and spaced.  
Shapes resemble midwinter ice,  
Coral and agate exude stalactites.  
Lofty and mixed piles,  
Intersecting and supporting pillars.  
Yin and yang find their match,  
Calm and reserved, mutually guarding.  
The Azure Dragon dwells in Fang six,  
Spring blossoms in the east at Mao.  
The White Tiger is at Mao seven,  
Autumn harvest in the west at You;  
The Vermilion Bird is at Zhang two,  
True yang at Li in the south at Wu.  
These three all come to court,  
Their families are close companions.

The previous section spoke of gathering and clustering the功 of the medicines,  
This section reveals the use of the fire’s timing to form the elixir.  
When the Four Symbols harmonize,  
The Five Phases cluster,  
The medicines enter the dry cauldron,  
Urgently needing the furnace’s one point of true fire to refine them.  
In a moment, the Five Phases mix and transform,  
The primal qi is born from emptiness.  
Thus it says: the water clock has not passed half,  
Fish scales and fins rise.  
Fish is the yang creature in water,  
Symbolizing the primal yang qi emerging.  
Scales and fins rising means the primal yang qi,  
Steamed by true fire, leaps and transforms.  
The five colors dazzling are the Five Phases as one qi.  
Change and unpredictability mean it leaps and hides.  
The cauldron boils and rushes without ceasing,  
The medicine’s qi is just transforming and tender.  
Layers piled and interlocked like dog teeth,  
The medicine’s qi moves from tender to gradual congealing.  
Shapes like midwinter ice, coral and agate exuding stalactites,  
From scattering to gathering, congealing and solidifying.  
Lofty and mixed piles, intersecting and supporting pillars,  
From mixed to pure, the medicine’s qi returns to yang.  
Yin and yang find their kind,  
Calm and reserved, mutually guarding,  
Yin and yang correspond,  
Mingled as one qi.  
Medicine is fire, fire is medicine,  
There is a natural true fire,  
In the furnace it glows bright and long,  
No room for adjustment or blending,  
One must be calm and reserved,  
Guard against danger and risk,  
Bathed and nurtured,  
To carry out the功 of non-action.  
The Azure Dragon dwells in Fang six,  
Spring blossoms in the east at Mao,  
The Azure Dragon is the image of wood;  
Fang is the water star;  
Six is the number of water.  
Wood resides in water’s place,  
Wood gains nourishment from water,  
Spring flourishes and yang qi moves.  
The White Tiger is at Mao seven,  
Autumn harvest in the west at You,  
The White Tiger is the image of metal,  
Mao is the fire star;  
Seven is the number of fire.  
Metal resides in fire’s place,  
Metal gains brightness from fire,  
Autumn flourishes and yin qi moves.  
The Vermilion Bird is at Zhang two,  
True yang at Li in the south at Wu,  
The Vermilion Bird is the image of fire;  
Zhang is the fire star;  
Two is the number of fire’s birth.  
Fire resides in the true south at Wu,  
Between metal and wood,  
Where yang reaches its peak and yin is born.  
This symbolizes the summer solstice’s interchange of yin and yang,  
The refining and measuring of punishment and virtue.  
Metal, wood, and fire all come to court,  
The elixir cauldron is formed as close companions.  
Water produces wood, wood produces fire,  
Fire produces metal, metal produces water.  
Though three, they contain the qi of the Four Symbols.  
The Four Symbols are present in the cauldron,  
Self-cooking and self-frying,  
The sacred embryo forms without substance to substance,  
Formless to form,  
Naturally transforming.  
This is the inner medicine’s natural true fire dharma image,  
Different from the earlier White Tiger, Azure Liquid, and Vermilion Bird.  
The earlier spoke of the external, this speaks of the internal.  
The external is returning from the latter Heaven to the former Heaven,  
By human effort;  
The internal is already returned to the former Heaven,  
By nature itself.  
This is the difference between internal and external fire timing,  
Students must focus here.

Originally there were only two things,  
At the end they become three and five.  
Three and five join with one,  
All gather and return to one place.  
Treat it as the above method,  
The number of days also taken from the beginning.  
First white then yellow,  
Red and black reach exterior and interior.  
Called the First Cauldron,  
Its size like large millet grains.  
What nature does,  
Is not false or counterfeit dao.  
The mountain and marsh qi mingle and steam,  
Rising clouds and forming rain;  
Mud dries and becomes dust,  
Fire extinguishes and transforms into earth;  
Like indigo dye turning yellow,  
Like blue becoming green threads;  
Leather boiled into glue,  
Fermented malt into wine.  
Similar kinds are easy to apply功,  
Different kinds are difficult to skillfully manage.  
Only this wondrous technique,  
Carefully examined, does not deceive.  
Transmitted to countless future generations,  
Clearly verifiable.  
Bright as the star scriptures of Han,  
Shining like the water source of the sea.  
Think deeply to become familiar,  
Repeatedly view above and below.  
A thousand cycles brilliantly shining,  
Ten thousand times can be seen.  
The divine and bright may reveal to people,  
The heart and spirit suddenly awaken within me.  
Exploring the root and seeking the thread,  
One must find the gate.  
The Way of Heaven has no partiality or error,  
Always transmitted to the worthy.

(“Join with one” here also read as “one; one is precarious one”; “or reveal to people” also read as “suddenly reveal to people”)

This section summarizes the whole chapter’s meaning.  
The Way of the Golden Elixir is the Way of yin and yang and the Five Phases.  
At the beginning, yin and yang harmonize to form the returning elixir,  
At the end, three and five return to one, forming the sacred embryo.  
Thus it says originally there were only two things,  
At the end they become three and five.  
Three and five harmonize,  
Mingled as one qi,  
The great dao is accomplished.  
But the Way of alchemy requires timing in gathering herbs,  
Methods in refining,  
Numbers in fire timing,  
Without功, completion is not allowed.  
Therefore first take white from black as the elixir mother,  
Next use white to make yellow,  
To form the sacred embryo.  
Red is fire, black is water.  
Exterior and interior are the two medicines.  
Though the Way of the Golden Elixir has internal and external medicines,  
The功 of water and fire refining,  
Until the ten-month embryo is complete,  
One must not rest.  
First refine oneself, then refine the medicine,  
Finally nurture and warm,  
From beginning to end, inside and outside,  
All depends on water and fire to gather功.  
Therefore red and black reach exterior and interior,  
Meaning功 incomplete is not square and round.  
Called the First Cauldron,  
Only this one method is true,  
The other two are not genuine.  
Its size like large millet grains,  
The elixir completes nine turns,  
Called the millet pearl,  
People who eat it  
Live as long as Heaven,  
Immortal and ageless.  
This pearl forms from emptiness,  
Apart from all kinds of dharma,  
Formed by the natural interaction of yin and yang qi,  
Not by furnace fire or battle and so forth,  
Forcing and twisting brings no benefit, only harm.  
Just like mountain and marsh qi mingling to form rain,  
Mud and water drying to become dust,  
Fire extinguishing to become earth,  
Indigo dye turning yellow,  
Blue becoming green thread,  
Leather boiled into glue,  
Malt fermented into wine—  
All arise naturally.  
Why?  
Because their kinds are the same,  
Easy to apply功.  
If two do not relate,  
Trying to plow stone and plant rice,  
Or climbing trees to catch fish,  
No matter how skillful, what use?  
The human body is not the essence blood of ordinary father and mother,  
The illusory body cannot form;  
Not the yin and yang of the spiritual father and sacred mother,  
The dharma body is hard to accomplish.  
The dharma body and illusory body  
Both rely on yin and yang to complete,  
Only differing in order,  
Saint and ordinary differ only in degree.  
All ordinary people only know to follow yin and yang,  
But the way of reversal is known by one in ten thousand.  
The Way of the Cantong Qi is divine, wondrous!  
Its divinity and wonder lie in using the technique of yin and yang to establish words.  
Its principle is exact, its dao great,  
It is功 grounded in reality,  
Not empty and unreal heresy,  
Truly the ladder for cultivation through all ages,  
The bridge of nature and life.  
Its teaching is clear and bright,  
Like the star scriptures of Han;  
Its principle is concise and illuminating,  
Like the water flowing to the sea.  
If the student can deeply think and carefully examine,  
Explore the root and seek the thread,  
After long time the divine brightness will silently reveal,  
The heart and spirit suddenly awaken,  
One will find the gate,  
And penetrate into the cave of principle.  
The Way of Heaven is impartial,  
Always transmitted to the worthy.  
Because the dao is honored by Heaven and Earth,  
Not passed to those without great loyalty and filial piety,  
Not granted to those without great virtue and great conduct.  
If one is truly worthy, what is there not to pass on or grant?  
Ah!  
The gentleman who obtains it is truly poor,  
The petty person who obtains it lightly risks their life.
