# The Direct Pointing to the Three Phases in the Treatise of the Unity of the Three (Part Two)

Perfectly round, three and five, one inch and one fen, mouth four and eight, two inches of lips.

This is called the Song of the Cauldron Vessel. Though named the Cauldron Vessel, the medicine and the fire’s timing are all contained within. The roundness means neither leaning nor tilting, lively and vigorous, truly holding to the center. Three is the number of wood’s birth; five is the number of earth’s birth; one is the number of water’s birth. One, three, and five are all yang numbers, thus called round. The mouth resembles the square; the square means transformation and regulation, applied according to the times. Four is the number of metal’s birth; eight is the number of wood’s completion; two is the number of fire’s birth. Two, four, and eight are all yin numbers, thus called mouth. The mouth is the dao of breath’s entrance and exit: one exhalation is yang, an extension, governing birth, symbolizing the eight wood; one inhalation is yin, a contraction, governing gathering, symbolizing the four metal. The lips are two active pieces, upper and lower. The lips move and the breath exhales, symbolizing two giving birth to fire. One, three, and five, the yang numbers, belong to Heaven. Heaven’s image is round, the dry cauldron. Two, four, and eight, the yin numbers, belong to Earth. Earth’s shape is square, the receptive furnace. Round governs closing; square governs opening. Taking round as substance, square as function, and gathering metal, wood, water, fire, and earth into one qi as the standard—this is how the cauldron vessel is perfected.

Length one chi two, thickness even throughout.

One chi two means twelve cun. In one year there are twelve months; in one month, twelve hou; in one day, twelve shi. Thick means abundant; thin means scarce; even means balanced. Using the six yin and six yang of year, month, day, and hour advancing and retreating as the rhythm, this is the measure of yang fire and yin talisman’s harmonizing regulation.

The belly aligns with three, sitting hanging warm.

The belly is the cauldron’s belly, the vessel storing the medicine. Three are the three great medicines: essence, qi, and spirit. The belly aligning with three means the three medicines of essence, qi, and spirit are complete inside the cauldron—this is what the *Yi Jing* calls the cauldron having substance. Sitting means unmoving, unshaken; hanging means sinking, filling; warm means harmonious and gentle. Sitting, hanging, and warm means essence, qi, and spirit gather in one place, always sinking and harmonizing, united in intention without dispersing—what the *Dao De Jing* calls “the Dao is empty yet use is inexhaustible.”

Yin above, yang rushing below.

Yin is water, symbolizing water within the receptive vessel. Yang is fire, symbolizing fire within the dry cauldron. Water above, fire below, water and fire cooking; fire not scorching, water not chilling; water and fire mutually assisting. Essence nourishes spirit and spirit secures essence.

Head and tail martial, middle literary. Beginning seventy, ending thirty. Two hundred sixty, well adjusted and even.

The work of refining the elixir begins with martial fire to forge oneself, ends with martial fire to warm and nurture. For if forging is incomplete, the returning elixir will not congeal; if nurturing is insufficient, the sacred embryo will not form. As for the middle stage of condensing the sacred embryo, only a moment of literary fire’s work is used, instantly grasping the creative power—thus it is said “head and tail martial, middle literary.” Yet even the martial fire at head and tail has distinctions. The Dao of the elixir begins with forging oneself and ends with nurturing. The human heart, long wild and deeply habituated, is the greatest harm to cultivation, hardest to subdue. If forging oneself does not reach the point where all phenomena are empty, the returning elixir is not permitted. This is where martial fire’s work is greatest. When the elixir is formed, guarding against danger and nurturing with baths, with little slackening, the sacred embryo forms but can still fail—thus martial fire’s work is also used. Though martial fire is used, once the ten-month embryo is complete, one may rest; this is less than the forging stage. For example, in one hundred days, use seventy days of martial fire forging oneself, thirty days of martial fire nurturing; the remaining two hundred sixty days are similarly balanced in fire timing, so that not a hair’s breadth deviates. This Immortal Elder compares the cycle of three hundred sixty days to the entire process of fire timing in the Dao of the elixir. It is not that three hundred sixty days fix the number of days for fire timing—students should discern carefully.

Yin fire white, yellow sprout lead. Two seven gather, assist and wing the person.

Yin fire is the fire of mercury’s nature; yang fire is the fire of lead’s nature. Both are birth numbers of fire, belonging to yin; seven is the completion number of fire, belonging to yang. When the external medicines harmonize the elixir’s core, a spark of the empty spiritual fire from their true nature is used to temper the lead nature—black gives birth to white, emptiness and substance give birth to light—thus yin fire is white. When the internal medicines harmonize the elixir’s core, a spark of the natural true fire from genuine nature is used to cook the primordial true one’s qi—formless giving form—gradually transforming white into yellow—thus yellow sprout lead. White still has yin substance; yellow is yin exhausted and yang pure. The *Dragon and Tiger Classic* says: “Pure white reveals treasure, able to make the yellow chariot”—this is the meaning of white and yellow. The two fires, internal and external, one gives birth, one completes; first yin fire gives birth to medicine, then yang fire completes medicine. Yin and yang fires gather, from birth to ripeness, the perfected person’s qi full and spirit complete, awaiting the moment to ascend—thus it is said assist and wing the person. Assist and wing means to support and carry forward; the person is the perfected sacred embryo, saying the yin and yang fires are used to perfect the sacred embryo.

Nourish principle in the brain, surely ascend the mysterious. The child dwells in the center, safely preserved. Coming and going wandering, not leaving the gate. Gradually growing great, nature and temperament pure. Returning to one, restoring the original root. Good love and respect, like lord and minister. Until one cycle, very diligent. Secretly guarding, do not be confused or faint. The road is far, again profound and mysterious. If one reaches this, one will meet Heaven and Earth. The knife and jade tablet moistened, the soul and spirit purified. Attaining longevity, dwelling in the immortal village.

The Dao of cultivating truth exhausts principle and perfects nature, reaching the Dao of destiny. If destiny is not cultivated, how can nature be nourished? Destiny concerns the affairs of the colored body; nature concerns the affairs of the dharma body. If destiny is not completed, the colored body is hard to leave; if nature is not completed, the dharma body is hard to escape. The Immortal Scripture says: “Only cultivating destiny, not cultivating nature, this is the first fault in cultivation. Only cultivating ancestral nature, not cultivating the elixir, the ten thousand kalpa yin spirits cannot enter the sage. Cultivating both nature and destiny is the proper way.” Above it said two seven gather, assist and wing the person. This is already the sacred embryo condensed, the destiny foundation firm; from here one can cultivate nature to escape the dharma body. This passage speaks of cultivating nature. Cultivating nature is the work of facing the wall and issuing spirit. The saying of facing the wall is not mere sitting still, facing a stone or earthen wall, but facing a scene and forgetting emotions, neither existence nor nonexistence stands, all things are empty. Like facing a wall and seeing nothing. Lesser schools call sitting still facing the wall “facing the wall”—do they understand the principle of facing the wall? Let us explain the principle of cultivating nature by facing the wall. Nourishing principle in the brain means nourishing nature. The brain is at the highest place of the body, behind the head, beyond the reach of eyes and ears. This means nourishing nature. One must reach the transformation of sound and color, emptying emptiness itself, arriving at the realm of utmost stillness—this is the supreme work. For without reaching the utmost stillness in cultivation, not only can the yang spirit not emerge, even the yin spirit cannot emerge. If truly nourishing nature reaches utmost stillness, then nature and destiny both complete, form and spirit both subtle; when the time comes for transformation, surely ascend the mysterious capital. This is what the Buddha and Patriarch said: “I entrust this matter to you,” meaning certain accomplishment. Yet before transformation time, do not rush; one must nurture gently. Thus it says the child dwells in the center, safely preserved. The child is the sacred embryo’s dharma body. When two seven gather, assist and wing the person, the sacred embryo is complete, like a child in the womb, stable and secure, awaiting the time. When the time comes, allow natural coming and going. Though the dharma body can come and go, it must not leave the body shell to roam afar. Gradually growing mature, nature and temperament pure and original firm, only then may one travel far. Not confused or faint, in an instant a thousand li, gathering forms shape, dispersing forms qi. Love and respect like lord and minister, carefully guarding. Diligent until one cycle, fearing confusion and faintness. The Dao reaches beyond the body to have a body, arriving at the place of neither birth nor death. Yet the Dao’s road is far, profound beyond profound, without end. If again one sets up the furnace, again establishes the cauldron, the child gives birth to grandson, grandson gives birth to branch, a thousand hundred billion transformations, immeasurable. If the student can reach this, with the above cases, Heaven and Earth are not hard to comprehend, the knife and jade tablet can be mastered, soul and spirit immediately purified, attaining longevity and dwelling in the immortal village—this is surely possible.

Those who delight in the Dao seek its root. Examine the Five Phases, determine ounces and fen. Contemplate deeply, no need to debate. Hide deeply and guard, do not transmit the text. Ride the white crane, mount the dragon qilin, roam the great void, visit the immortal lord, record the heavenly chart, call oneself the perfected person.

In the world there are countless blind cultivators and reckless refiners—some extinguish and guard emptiness, some practice the elixir wrongly, some use furnace fire to ingest food, some move essence and qi—these all do not know the root of nature and destiny. Thus cultivators are like cow’s hair, those who attain the Dao like qilin’s horn. The Immortal Elder compassionately raises the words “seek the root,” greatly awakening people. The root is the one qi of primordial emptiness; one is the birth of Heaven, birth of Earth, birth of all things, the root of the Dao. The student of the Dao who knows the one, all matters are complete; the cultivator who attains the one, the golden elixir forms. To seek the root, urgently seek a master’s secret, and carefully examine the birth and conquest of the Five Phases, the wondrous use of gathering, the ounces and fen of medicines, the divisions of fire timing. Having obtained the secret, contemplate its marvel, grasp the meaning and forget words, great wisdom seeming foolish, great skill seeming clumsy. Diligently practice it; three thousand merits complete, eight hundred practices finished, mount the crane and ride the qilin, ascend in broad daylight, called the perfected person—how great is this joy?

The Immortal Elder fills in omissions and escapes, *The Three Phases* upper and lower parts. The upper part speaks of the returning elixir, great elixir, and the harmonizing levels of internal and external medicines; the lower part discusses the cauldron vessel’s fire operation, from beginning to end. The two parts are most concise in words, clearest in principle, most detailed in method, most complete in matters. Summarizing the great meaning of the *Unity of the Three*, separately establishing its words, forming a book by itself, all things the *Unity of the Three* did not address—thus called filling omissions and escapes. Saying it fills what the *Unity of the Three* left out, seals what the *Unity of the Three* let slip. Since the existence of *The Three Phases*, the *Unity of the Three* can be without omission or escape. Though the Immortal Elder did not annotate the *Old Unity*, he truly completed the *Unity of the Three*. The work of inheriting the past and opening the future—how shallow or slight is it!
