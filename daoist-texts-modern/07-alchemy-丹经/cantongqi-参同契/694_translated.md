# The Symbolic Words that Dispel Doubts

## Preface to The Symbolic Words that Dispel Doubts

The myriad volumes of the Elixir Scriptures are all composed in symbolic words. Symbolic words are not plain speech, nor clear speech, nor empty speech, nor strange speech. They are words that have substance and principle, that have reference and proof—taking symbols to unfold the truth. Later generations, failing to probe their meaning, cling only to the symbols themselves. Among Confucians who read them, they are deemed bizarre and nonsensical; among Daoists who read them, they are seen as mere husks of symbols. Some even fixate on the symbols with suspicion, contriving all manner of distortions, wandering into crooked paths and perverse conduct, harming their very nature and life—countless are such cases.

Alas! Is this truly the intention of the ancient sages and worthies who took symbols to establish their words? The Book of Changes says: “No law or symbol is greater than Heaven and Earth; no transformation or adaptation is greater than the Four Seasons; no suspended symbol or manifest sign is greater than the sun and moon.” The Elixir Scriptures all take their root in the Zhou Yi, and their medicines and fire-timing borrow from Heaven and Earth, sun and moon, and the Four Seasons to unfold their profound mysteries. If one were to regard the symbolic words of the Elixir Scriptures as strange and absurd husks, then what of the symbols in the Yi—wind and cloud, thunder and lightning, dragon and tiger, ox and horse, deer and sheep, tortoise and pheasant? What of the symbols of the blind who can still see, the lame who can still walk, riding on walls, friends sharing hairpins, biting skin and extinguishing noses, trapped by tree stumps, carrying ghosts in one cart, slaughtering sheep without blood, and so forth? Should these also be dismissed as strange and absurd husks?

How tragic! The true dao has long been lost—not only from today. Since I encountered the true master, I have taken the Elixir Scriptures from various schools, comparing them one to another, and truly gained insight into the meaning of symbolic words. Thus, what I have received from my master I have fully revealed within the books *Contemplation*, *Awakening*, *Unfolding the Truth*, and *Original Intent*. Yet fearing that students might find it difficult to grasp the whole, I have also composed this book *The Symbolic Words that Dispel Doubts*, with illustrations and images, carefully distinguishing right from wrong, sweeping away side paths to point to the true dao, quelling false teachings to defend the true lineage. This is my fundamental aspiration.

Those who see this book should consider that even the dead can speak of the art of life—do not disdain it as mere dregs and refuse it. Such would be most fortunate.

In the sixteenth year of the Jiaqing reign, the year of the Xinwei, in spring, the first month of the kingly cycle, at Mount Qiyun, the simple old man Wuyuanzi Liu Yiming humbly inscribed this at the Pavilion of Heart Washing.
