# On the Language of Images

The study of cultivating the true self, as the ancient scriptures often declare, centers on the dao of non-action. Yet, concerning the dao of action, there is scant discourse. The dao of non-action, it is said, can only be grasped by the highest sages who awaken suddenly to perfect understanding, who, with a single insight, comprehend a hundred matters, and immediately ascend to the realm of the sacred. As for those of middling or lower capacities, whose natures are dull and roots entangled in dust, whose vision is narrow—if they attempt to walk the dao of non-action, their strength will fall short; they cannot utterly empty all attachments and directly reach the farther shore.

In the Later Han, the Immortal Elder Wei Boyang, following the Way of Change, composed the *Cantong Qi* (The Kinship of the Three), guiding those of middling and lower stations by employing the manifest to illustrate the unmanifest, the formed to signify the formless. Thus arose the name of the Golden Elixir, along with lead and mercury, sand and silver, black rabbit and dragon-tiger, infantile yin and yang, medicines, furnaces and cauldrons, cooking and refining—these myriad images of method and symbol. Since then, the Daoist adepts who attained the Way have all traced their lineage to the *Cantong Qi*, composing elixir scriptures to unfold its wondrous principles. Their intent was to aid later students by referencing these images, borrowing these symbols to verify the truth.

Yet, alas, later students fail to probe the meaning behind the parables, neglect to extract the principle within the image. Seeing talk of the Golden Elixir, lead, mercury, and furnace, they suspect mere ingestion and thus fall into the fire’s trap; seeing black rabbit and dragon-tiger, they mistake them for internal organs and so become lost in fanciful imaginings; seeing the yin and yang of other schools and their male and female, they suspect secret pills and thus become entangled in grasping and seizing; seeing talk of reversal and inversion, they suspect forced contrivance and thus become ensnared in mechanical turning; seeing cultivation of nature and non-action, they suspect annihilation and thus fall into stubborn emptiness; seeing cultivation of destiny and action, they suspect juggling and thus cling to appearances. Such doors of practice are like mistaking a deer for a horse, a bird for a phoenix—not only do they bring no benefit to nature and life, but they harm them. Is this truly the meaning the Patriarchs intended when they took images to speak in parables?

An image is an image. It means this thing resembles that thing, that affair resembles this affair. Consider matters all can see and know: for example, cooking and preparing food. The pot is the cauldron; the stove is the furnace. Water stored in the pot, fire burning beneath the stove; fire naturally rises upward, water naturally flows downward. Now, the water in the pot is above, the fire beneath the stove below; water and fire reversed, yet they assist each other, and the food is cooked and perfected. This is the ordinary image of water and fire mutually aiding.

Human nature is rigid and restless, prone to movement—movement belongs to fire. The supple nature is gentle and calm, inclined to stillness—stillness belongs to water. Use gentleness to nourish rigidity, and rigidity to complete gentleness; when rigidity and gentleness are balanced, neither restless nor slack, returning to the center and upright, the Great Dao is easily fulfilled. This is the principle of numinous water and numinous fire mutually aiding. Taking the image of ordinary water and fire mutually aiding to illustrate the principle of numinous water and fire mutually aiding—this principle is clear indeed.

Again, consider a person born to abundant family wealth who does not keep to their due, squandering possessions until all is gone. Suddenly they realize, repent, labor diligently, attend carefully to life, gradually accumulate, and wealth returns from little to much; in the end, the family estate is restored. This is the image of returning to the origin and restoring the root.

The human body’s spirit and numinous qi are originally full and complete. Entrusting them to later heaven, following its transformations, one wastes essence and exhausts spirit; the primordial qi declines, the original root consumed to the end. If one knows to change one’s face and mind, restrain anger and block desire, set aside evil and preserve sincerity, gradually apply effort, there will surely come a time to return to the root and restore destiny. This is the principle of returning to the origin and restoring the root.

Taking the worldly image of returning to the origin and restoring the root to illustrate the principle of cultivating the dao to return to the origin and restore the root—this principle is clear indeed.

Again, consider the union of man and woman in the world: two become one, and from this union children and grandchildren are born. This is the image of human life endlessly generating life.

The human body’s yin and yang are balanced; two become one, and from this union immortals and Buddhas are born. This is the principle of the elixir dao endlessly generating life.

Borrowing the image of human life endlessly generating life to illustrate the principle of the elixir dao endlessly generating life—this principle is clear indeed.

All elixir scriptures use images to illustrate principle, teaching people to discern the principle in the image, not to abandon principle and merely act upon the image.

Today’s people do not exhaust the principle, only recognizing the image—how lamentable! Elixir scriptures abound in images; students must use the image to exhaust the principle, attain the image and forget the words, grasp the meaning and forget the image—only then might they approach the truth.
