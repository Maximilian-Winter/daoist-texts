# On the Way of Following and Reversing

All people in the world know the dao of following the natural course, yet they do not know the dao of reversing the movement. What is following? It is to follow the course of creation; what is reversing? It is to go against the course of creation. To follow creation is to give rise to life and beings—birth, aging, sickness, death—endless cycles of reincarnation; to reverse creation is to become immortal, to become Buddha—neither born nor extinguished, with a lifespan as enduring as Heaven and Earth.

Ordinary people, from the moment they form in their parents’ wombs and are born into the world, count the cycles of two and eight, mingling with the acquired energies. Within, the seven natures and six desires obscure their true essence; without, myriad conditions and countless affairs exhaust their form. They mistake the false for the true, take the evil for the right, regard suffering as pleasure, and follow their desires without restraint, leaving no boundary untraversed. Thus, the original three treasures of essence, energy, and spirit are consumed and exhausted; the primordial, perfect true nature is utterly lost. Until the breath breaks at the throat and life ends, they refuse to rest. Therefore, life after life, death after death, they sink into the abyss of countless kalpas. It is said that if the Lord of the Underworld does not call, they still cast themselves into death.

But if one is a person of great wisdom, one reverses the movement of creation, refusing to be bound by creation, refusing to be melted and forged by yin and yang, refusing to be drawn by all things, refusing to be swayed by myriad conditions. Like planting a lotus in blazing fire, like dragging a boat through muddy waters, one borrows the methods of the world to cultivate the dao methods, relies on the human dao to reach the heavenly dao. One will exhaust all the roots and dust of kalpas, sweep away all the later-arising guest qi, and command one’s own fate rather than be subject to Heaven’s master. One returns to the original face of primal yang, escapes the wheel of reincarnation, transcends the Three Realms, and becomes a diamond-like indestructible being.

Yet this secret of reversing the heavenly mechanism within following—the oral transmission and heart-to-heart teaching—is something that must be pointed out by a true master. It cannot be known by private guessing. People of the world, relying on their own firefly-like light, peering through a narrow hole, memorizing a few phrases, reading a few cases, fancy themselves knowledgeable, no longer seeking teachers. They show off before others, babble nonsense, leading others blind with their own blindness—what a grievous fault!

There is yet another kind of confused person who cannot recognize a true master, turning from one to another like morning kings and evening Li’s, learning these minor practices of the small vehicle, yet still claiming to bear the dao. Even with enlightened ones before them, they will not humble themselves, causing chaos and disorder. Sometimes their heart qi descends while kidney qi rises—that is reversing the course; sometimes their circulating qi rises behind and falls before—that is reversing the course; sometimes they return essence to nourish the brain—that is reversing the course; sometimes they hold breath to settle the spirit—that is reversing the course; sometimes they gather yin to supplement yang—that is reversing the course; sometimes men lie beneath women—that is reversing the course. Such like, in thousands of gates and ten thousand households, all are contrary to the sacred dao, not true reversal of creation; they are all roads to death, not roads to supreme life.

They do not realize that reversal means returning to the moment of birth from parents, like a person who has left home far away but then turns back home.

Though it is called reversing, in truth it is following principle and pattern, the great following within reversal. Because it runs contrary to what ordinary people do, it is called reversal. Those crooked side paths, confused by the single word “reverse,” engage in myriad acts on the flesh and skin vessel, only to end in emptiness—how foolish indeed!
