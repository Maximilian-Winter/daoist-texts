# Discourse on Medicinal Substances

The scriptures of the elixir and the writings of the immortals speak of gathering medicinal substances, of roasting and refining the Golden Elixir. Yet all these are truly the formless, immaterial verities of the primordial—neither the tangible, material medicines of the mundane world, nor the palpable, physical things of the human body. For once a person is born into this world, they mistake the false for the true, losing sight of the original treasure that is perfectly whole. They digest and exhaust it utterly, leaving the body pure yin, filled with turbid qi, as if a great illness has descended upon them, awaiting the moment of death. Without the genuine numinous medicine to heal and restore, how could one ever reverse yin into yang, preserving life itself?

What then is the true numinous medicine? It is the primordial genuine unity of qi—the three treasures of primordial essence, qi, and spirit. This primordial genuine unity of qi is also called the true seed. This qi does not fall into forms or images; it is the utmost nothingness containing the utmost being, the utmost void embracing the utmost substance—a wondrous existence born of true emptiness. It governs and encompasses the three treasures of essence, qi, and spirit, which themselves are not material things but formless verities. The Jade Toad Elder says: “Its essence is not the mingled essence of intercourse, but the saliva from the mouth of the Jade Emperor; its qi is not the breath of inhalation and exhalation, but the smoke of the Great Primordial; its spirit is not the spirit of thought and deliberation, but can stand shoulder to shoulder with the Primordial Beginning.” Though divided into three families, all return to the primordial one qi; the three families combine to form one qi, and one qi divides into three families.

Those who gather medicines, in truth, gather this one qi and its three treasures, employing the true fire to temper and refine it into the elixir, igniting and transforming the myriad yin qi of the body, returning it to the original substance of pure yang, serene, immaculate, and unstained. Just as when a person falls ill, medicines are used to heal and restore them to health. What is called “medicinal substances” are but images and symbols. Later scholars, upon reading the scriptures on elixirs and medicines, mistakenly believe them to be tangible, material things, and so they gather mountain herbs to concoct and consume, vainly hoping for longevity; or they collect five metals and eight minerals, refining them into elixirs to swallow, foolishly dreaming of ascension. They do not realize that tangible medicines can only cure tangible illnesses, but cannot heal intangible maladies. If one wishes to cure intangible ailments, one must gather the primordial genuine unity of qi; there is no other method.

The Treatise on Correspondences says: “Similar kinds are easily empowered; without the seed, skill is hard to achieve.” The Awakening to the True says: “When bamboo breaks, one must use bamboo to mend it; when embracing a chicken, one must use its egg; all else is futile labor, how can it compare to the true lead that matches the sacred mechanism?” The true lead is none other than the primordial genuine unity of qi.

Contemplating all this, one may awaken to the truth that all ordinary medicines regarded as immortal medicines are but illusions.
