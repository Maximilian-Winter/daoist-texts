# Discourse on the Fire-Timing

What the alchemical scriptures and treatises call the fire-timing is but a metaphor for the guiding principle of the sequence in cultivation practice. For truly, the merit of cultivation unfolds in stages—some come before others, some proceed more swiftly, some more slowly; there are times to advance and times to retreat. One must not place what ought to come first behind, nor what should follow ahead; nor hasten when one should be gentle, nor linger when urgency calls; nor advance when retreat is due, nor retreat when the way is forward. Just as the furnace’s fire burns the medicine with moments of vigorous and gentle heat, advancing and withdrawing in measured rhythm, so too the order of cultivation must mirror this fire-timing. Yet this timing is not bound by year, month, day, or hour; rather, it is practiced moment by moment, always acting promptly when due—advancing when advance is proper, retreating when retreat is called for, quickening when quickening is needed, easing when easing is wise, adapting with the times, allowing not the slightest error.

What is meant by “what ought to come first” is what rigorously refines the inner; “what ought to come last” is what governs the outer; “what ought to be urgent” is the earnest exertion of effort; “what ought to be gentle” is the nurturing and warming; “what ought to advance” is when yang is insufficient and must be increased; “what ought to retreat” is when yin is just arising and must be tempered back. This is the true principle of fire-timing—not the alchemist’s talk of advancing yang fire at the hour of the Rat, retreating yin talisman at the hour of the Horse, or bathing at the hours of the Rabbit and Rooster; nor the notion that yang fire advances at the winter solstice, yin talisman retreats at the summer solstice, and bathing is proper at the spring and autumn equinoxes. Heaven has its own Rat, Horse, Rabbit, and Rooster; man has his own Rat, Horse, Rabbit, and Rooster—how could heaven’s hours be the same as man’s?

Within the human body, Rat, Horse, Rabbit, and Rooster are present in every moment. The ancient scriptures say: “No need to seek Rat and Horse at the horizon; within the body itself, one yang is born.” For yang born is Rat; yin born is Horse; yang and yin united is Rabbit; yin and yang united is Rooster—this is the living Rat, Horse, Rabbit, and Rooster, not the dead hours at the horizon. The Four Hundred Characters on the Golden Elixir say: “Fire-timing does not require the hour; winter solstice is not at Rat; as for bathing methods, Rabbit and Rooster are but empty comparisons.” The Treatise on Awakening the True says: “Though one knows cinnabar and black lead, without knowing fire-timing it is like idleness; mostly all depends on cultivation effort, not a hair’s breadth of error or the elixir will not form.” Saying “winter solstice is not at Rat,” “Rabbit and Rooster are but empty comparisons,” and “not a hair’s breadth of error” makes clear that these are not the Rat, Horse, Rabbit, and Rooster of the horizon. If it were the hours of the horizon, then cultivation would only occur in four of the twelve hours, abandoning the other eight—how could there be no error at all?

The Mirror of Alchemy says: “Within one day, twelve hours, wherever the mind reaches, all may be used.” Thus, year, month, day, and hour—moment by moment—cultivation must be practiced, guarding against danger and risk, allowing not the slightest error. As for the sixty-four hexagrams’ fire-timing, this too merely indicates the method of yin and yang advancing and retreating, instructing one to add or subtract as the time changes, adapting cultivation accordingly—not to follow the sixty-four hexagrams in strict order. The Treatise on Awakening the True says: “The hexagrams set images and forms; once the image is grasped, words may be forgotten and meaning is clear. The world’s confused followers cling only to images, yet act by hexagram qi, hoping to ascend.” Reading the scriptures requires understanding the ancients’ intent in using images to express words; once the meaning is grasped, the images may be set aside.

The Way of cultivation is expressed through countless scriptures and classics in symbolic language. Though the images differ, all aim to elucidate the principles of yin and yang, the true and false of medicines, and the standards of fire-timing—beyond this, there is no other explanation. I have received my master’s guidance and truly grasped the meaning within the images; I dare not keep it to myself but wish to share it with kindred spirits. Thus, I extract the crucial points from the alchemical scriptures, illustrate and authenticate them, analyze right and wrong, to dispel doubts for learners. The rest can be inferred by analogy.

### The Face in the Womb

Before a person is born of father and mother, when the male and female yin and yang energies mingle, in the vast darkness there is a single point of life force emerging from the void—this is called the primordial True One ancestral qi. This qi enters the essence and blood, melding and refining them into one. Formless, it gives birth to form; immaterial, it gives birth to substance. Within are the five viscera and six bowels; outside are the five senses and one hundred bones. Through transformation and metamorphosis, all is naturally completed. Even the mother carrying the fetus does not know how this comes to be. Later students, not understanding this principle, may think the fetus is formed by the umbilical cord connecting to the mother’s qi, breathing with her in and out, gradually changing shape—but this is mistaken. The breath qi is acquired qi; how could acquired qi transform essence and blood into form? How could breath qi enter the fetus? Know that within the mother’s womb there is only the one point of primordial ancestral qi, vague and indistinct, first condensing the fetus, then nourishing it, finally perfecting it. From beginning to end, all is accomplished by this ancestral qi alone, without mixture.

At this time, though human form exists, there is no human way; heaven and earth, all things, water and fire, weapons and blades, cannot harm it; the seven emotions and six desires, the five thieves and four appearances, cannot approach. Ultimately, it is but emptiness. The ancient immortals teach that to cultivate the Way is to return to the face before birth—return to the realm of emptiness, without sound or scent. Soundless and scentless is the limitless; the limitless is the limitlessness of nothingness—it is simply non-being.

### The Infant’s Face

Within the mother’s belly, after ten months the fetus is full and ripe; the fruit falls from the stem, breaking the membrane to emerge. Feet point to the heavens, head to the earth; with a cry, it receives acquired qi through mouth and nose, descending to the sea of qi, merging with primordial original qi. The primordial is the body; the acquired is the function. The acquired borrows the primordial to breathe in and out; the primordial borrows the acquired to nurture blood and vessels. Not only this: at the first cry, the consciousness from countless kalpas of reincarnation also enters the orifices, blending with the primordial original spirit into one. The original spirit borrows the consciousness to survive; the consciousness borrows the original spirit to be numinous. Yet the newborn infant, though possessing acquired qi and spirit, is governed by the primordial; the acquired follows the primordial. The two mix in confusion, without awareness or knowledge—only the One True remains. The ancient immortals teach to grasp the moment of birth itself, the infant’s face at the very start of life. The confused say the place of birth is the mother’s birth canal, but this is not so. The moment of birth, the infant’s face, is pure white and spotless—the embryo of sages and worthies, the root sprout of immortals and Buddhas. Hence birds do not peck, tigers and wild oxen do not harm it. They do not strike because it is without mind; without mind, birth and death cannot hinder it—what calamity or disaster could there be? This is the image of the primal extreme. The primal extreme is the utmost beginning, not yet mingled with the acquired; though mingled, it is purely the primordial in charge, because it is the primal extreme, beginning from nothingness.

### The Child’s Face

From infant to child, one grows able to walk and talk, guided by others. This is called a child, or a boy. The infant is without awareness or knowledge; the child has awareness and knowledge—no longer a mere floating cloud dotting the vast sky. Awareness and knowledge arise from the primal extreme gradually reaching the Great Ultimate. The Great Ultimate is the utmost of the great; when yang reaches its peak, yin must arise. Yet yin has not yet been born; the small is not yet born. The small not yet born, yin not yet born, is still the primordial at work; the acquired lies dormant. Though there is awareness and knowledge, the root and dust have not yet sprouted; the guest qi has not yet invaded. One drinks and eats, feels cold and wears clothes; joy, anger, sorrow, and pleasure arise and fade with the moment. Wealth and poverty, fortune and misfortune, are unknown and unheeded. Following nature, one is free of杂念—also the embryo of sages and worthies, the root sprout of immortals and Buddhas. The foolish do not understand and mistake the child for the infant, but no—the infant is the newborn babe; the child is the young boy. Though both are naturally pure, their status differs, knowledge varies. Thus the ancient immortals all teach to return to the infant’s original face, not the child’s mischievous visage.

### The Division of Yin and Yang

From child growing onward, at sixteen the qi is full; yang peaks and yin arises. Each day pierces an orifice; yin and yang divide, each occupying a side; within the true is the false. Knowledge gradually opens; good and evil are distinguished. This is the Great Ultimate divided and yin and yang separated. The so-called sixteen qi means, like the waxing and waning moon, the two crescents unite into full brightness; it symbolizes the primordial yang peak, like the Great Ultimate. Where yang peaks, yin must arise; like the Great Ultimate divided, yin and yang separate. The foolish think the sixteen means a boy at sixteen leaks yin essence; no. Observe the world: some boys at fourteen or fifteen leak essence; some at sixteen or seventeen; some at eighteen or nineteen. The amount varies. Thus the sixteen does not mean age but the fullness of qi.

### The Five Phases in Position

With yin and yang divided, the Five Phases are also scattered. The Five Phases are the five qi of Metal, Wood, Water, Fire, and Earth. In the primordial, Earth gives birth to Metal, Metal to Water, Water to Wood, Wood to Fire, Fire to Earth—five phases as one qi, manifesting the five virtues of benevolence, righteousness, propriety, wisdom, and faith. In the acquired, Earth overcomes Water, Water overcomes Fire, Fire overcomes Metal, Metal overcomes Wood, Wood overcomes Earth—five phases attacking each other, manifesting the five thieves of joy, anger, sorrow, grief, and desire. When the Five Phases unite, the five virtues are complete and yin and yang blend; when scattered, the five thieves arise and yin and yang are discordant. When the Five Phases divide, consciousness arises, root and dust sprout, the true retreats, the false takes power, and the child’s face is lost. The foolish think the five viscera correspond to the Five Phases—no. The five viscera are material and turbid, the vessels of the acquired Five Phases, not the virtue garden of the primordial Five Phases. If one says the five viscera are the Five Phases, how could the five viscera divide and unite? Moreover, the Five Phases have primordial and acquired distinctions; primordial exists before birth, acquired after birth; primordial gives birth to sages, acquired to humans. Though two Five Phases, differing in time, both are living and not fixed—how could the turbid matter of the five viscera be the Five Phases?

### The Acquired at Work

Yin and yang divided, Five Phases scattered, the acquired engages, the primordial retreats. Thus the nature of qi and temperament arises; external habits and dust are born. The six root gates, gate by gate, invite thieves; the seven emotions breed calamities. The pure white body gradually fills with yin qi. Yin qi enters, grows, and yang qi wanes; growing and growing, waning and waning, following its desire, reaching everywhere. The foolish think the nature of qi and temperament is true nature—no. True nature is the nature of Heaven’s mandate, belonging to the primordial, beneficial to man; the nature of qi and temperament is the nature of life, born of the acquired, harmful to man. How could acquired nature be the same as primordial nature?

---

### Pure Yin Without Yang

With the acquired at work, yin advances and yang retreats day after day, year after year. Within, myriad thoughts bring disaster; without, myriad things pull and tug. Attacked inside and out, yang qi is exhausted; the body becomes pure yin, the three treasures consumed, soul and spirit hard to preserve—how could one not die? The foolish think fate ends when numbers run out, entrusting it to Heaven—no. What life depends on is yang qi. A single point of yang qi, unexhausted, means no death; a single point of yin qi, impure, also means no death. Following yin qi, exhausting yang qi, one seeks death’s path—what has Heaven to do with it? The above seven diagrams all follow the course of creation, the way of giving birth to life.

### Refining Oneself and Building the Foundation

The Way of cultivation is the Way of return. Return means having gone and coming back; return means yang lost and regained. This is within pure yin, returning to the original true yang. Man, since the acquired at work, is pure yin throughout; primordial yang qi is exhausted. Without the功 of return, how could what is lost be regained? The功 of return begins with refining oneself and building the foundation. Refining oneself means refining the root dust of kalpas, the bias of qi and temperament, and all habitual foreign qi—that is, restraining anger, blocking desire, overcoming self, and restoring propriety. One who restrains anger and blocks desire, overcomes self and restores propriety, has no thought or worry, is unmoved and unshaken, with a firm root. Just as building a house requires first laying a foundation: if the foundation is firm, the wood and bricks, made by man, can all be supported. Refining oneself is within building the foundation; building the foundation is not outside refining oneself. The foolish think refining oneself means guarding the heart, and building the foundation means closing the essence—no. The功 of refining oneself is the essential point from beginning to end of the elixir Way, lasting until yin is exhausted and yang is pure; only then is refining oneself complete. If not yet at yin exhausted and yang pure, refining oneself must not cease. If one says guarding the heart and closing the essence is refining oneself and building the foundation, how could the great matter of the Golden Elixir be accomplished? The ancient immortals say: “Returning the elixir takes but an instant; refining oneself requires ten months.” From this one sees it is not mere guarding the heart and closing the essence.

### The True Heart of Heavenly Goodness

Refining oneself and building the foundation is not forced labor or bitter exertion; one must recognize the true heart of heavenly goodness, borrowing this true heart to refine oneself. Then, even in darkness, a ray of sunlight appears, called the true numinous. When the true numinous manifests, right and wrong, true and false are clearly distinguished; one is not swayed by desire for things, nor stained by worldly ties; refining oneself becomes easy. If one does not recognize the true heart, right and wrong are confused, true and false indistinct; thus the heart controls the heart, ending in human willfulness and forced effort. The so-called “removing false thoughts only adds illness” and “tending toward true thus is also mistaken” — how to reach the place of no self? The foolish mistake the human heart for the true heart—no. The true heart is without heart; the heart without heart is the heart of heavenly goodness. Having this true heart of heavenly goodness, what difficulty is there in overcoming the self? The Hundred-Character Stele says: “In movement and stillness, know the ancestral root; when nothing is amiss, seek no other.” The Yellow Crane Ode says: “Departing from the seven kinds of cinnabar within, without the true seed, it is hard to hold at all times.” Master Sanfeng says: “When building the foundation, one must use the leather bag and reed pipe; when refining oneself, one must return to true lead.” The ancestral true seed, the leather bag and reed pipe, and true lead are all other names for the true heart of heavenly goodness. Alas! The true heart of heavenly goodness is not easy to know. If one knows it, one attains the One, and all matters are complete.

---

### Yang Grows and Yin Fades

Recognizing the true heart of heavenly goodness, the master sits steadily at the center; the Way diminishes day by day,功 increases day by day; yang qi gradually grows, yin qi gradually fades; growing and growing, fading and fading, until there is nowhere left to grow or fade—then功 is complete. The foolish think that by sitting quietly in non-action, in silent emptiness, yang qi will grow and yin qi will fade by itself—no. The returning elixir is yang restored within yin. If one tries to restore yang by sitting quietly in non-action and silent emptiness, how can yang come by itself? How can yin retreat by itself? The Treatise on Awakening the True says: “Though one knows cinnabar and black lead, without knowing fire-timing it is like idleness; mostly all depends on cultivation effort, not a hair’s breadth of error or the elixir will not form.” From this one knows the way of advancing yang and retreating yin.

---

### Gathering the Five Phases

As yang grows and yin fades, one must know to gather the Five Phases. Gathering the Five Phases, the Great Way is in sight. The功 of gathering is to return the acquired Five Phases to the primordial Five Phases. The acquired Five Phases mutually overcome; the primordial Five Phases mutually generate. Returning means, within mutual overcoming, to bring about mutual generating. The Five Phases generating is the perfect celestial principle; it is the One Qi of the Five Phases, the harmony of the Four Symbols. The foolish think gathering the Five Phases means using intention to guide the heart-kidney qi, connecting up and down, moving liver and lung qi, joining left and right—no. The qi of the five viscera are all material things, acquired dregs, some formed and some broken; how could they condense into an eternal, unspoiled life treasure?

---

### The Mixing of Yin and Yang

The Five Phases emerge from yin and yang; the Five Phases gathered and united is yin and yang united as one. Yin and yang mixed, the Golden Elixir takes form; it is still the child’s face, but only acquired qi, not yet transformed away. Though not yet transformed away, the primordial returns and the acquired follows; this cannot cause harm. From here begins the next stage of功, and the Golden Elixir may be completed. The foolish think that mixing yin and yang means heart and kidney joining, or the Ren and Du meridians meeting, or man and woman coupling—no. The Golden Elixir is condensed from the primordial void qi; how could it be condensed from acquired blood and flesh?

---

### The Perfect One Qi

Yin and yang return and blend; the child’s face is restored. From here one moves the natural true fire, burning away the remaining acquired yin, returning to the state of no knowledge and no awareness, where spirit is hidden and qi gathered—this is called a man’s pregnancy. This pregnancy is the infant’s face, the place of birth and receiving qi, the primal extreme, the Great Unity containing true qi. The foolish think that taking red lead, plucking plum seeds, swallowing and eating to form the sacred embryo—no. If one says red lead and plum seeds can form the sacred embryo, what is formed is but a blood clot and flesh lump, a ghost fetus hastening death—nothing more.

---

### The Vast Void of the Great Emptiness

The sacred embryo condensed, then with ten months of nurturing功, moving the natural true fire, steaming, roasting, and refining, from subtle to solid, from tender to firm, stripping away all shadows of yin, the fetus rounds and the elixir forms. The fruit ripens and falls from the stem; suddenly breaking through chaos, it bursts forth a pure, clear Dharma body, leaping into the vast void of Great Emptiness, transcending the Three Realms. This is the face before birth, the face of the limitless. The Dao returns to the limitless; form and spirit both wondrous, united with the Dao in truth—this is the great man’s accomplishment. The foolish think that facing the mirror to perform spirit, or silently contemplating the crown, or facing the wall to forget form, or sending out yin spirit—no. The spirit born of Golden Elixir transformation is the yang spirit; all spirits born of quiet功 are yin spirits. The yang spirit endures ten thousand years, neither born nor extinguished; the yin spirit, unrefined by fire, abandons the body and returns to it. Among thousands of gates and myriad households, if one does not receive the Golden Elixir’s great Way illumination, though the yin spirit may come and go freely, knowing past and future, one cannot escape reincarnation. As it is said: “Though you endure countless kalpas, in the end all is empty and lost.”

The above seven diagrams all follow the course of creation in reverse—they are the Way of cultivating immortality.

Among the fourteen diagrams, the matters of following the course and reversing the cycle can be roughly understood. Below, I extract the crucial symbolic words, distinguish right and wrong, point out the true meaning, to show learners that such things may be grasped by intuition.
