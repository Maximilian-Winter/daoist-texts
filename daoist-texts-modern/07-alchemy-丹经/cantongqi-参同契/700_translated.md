# The Image of Breaking Doubt, Volume Two

### The Golden Elixir

Gold is that which is firm, unyielding, eternal, and indestructible; the elixir is that which is perfect, radiant, and without flaw. The ancient immortals borrowed the name "Golden Elixir" to symbolize the original, perfectly clear, numinous nature of true spirit. This nature is called the Supreme Ultimate in Confucianism, Perfect Enlightenment in Buddhism, and the Golden Elixir in Daoism. Though the names differ among the three, the reality is one and the same. When the Confucians cultivate it, they become sages; when the Buddhists cultivate it, they become Buddhas; when the Daoists cultivate it, they become immortals. The sages of the three teachings all regard this original true nature as the foundation for attaining the dao. Foolish people do not know this; some mistake the concoction of five metals and eight stones, refined into medicine, as the Golden Elixir—but this is not so. The true nature dwells within the great primal furnace, ripened by fire’s refining, enduring as long as Heaven and Earth, shining as bright as sun and moon—how could any mundane substance of the world ever become it?

### The Heart of Heaven and Earth

The foremost essential in cultivating the true is to recognize the heart of Heaven and Earth. This heart is none other than the previously mentioned heavenly good true heart. This heart is vague, dim, and mysterious, not lightly manifesting in forms; only when the empty chamber births whiteness, and in the dark suddenly brightness appears, does its trace reveal itself. Heaven belongs to yang, Earth to yin; the heart of Heaven and Earth is the union where yin never parts from yang, and yang never parts from yin—the heart where yin and yang merge. When yin and yang unite, this heart exists; when yin and yang separate, this heart vanishes. Neither form nor emptiness, yet both form and emptiness; neither existence nor nonexistence, yet both existence and nonexistence; form and emptiness without obstruction, being and non-being not established—this is the wondrous existence within true emptiness. To know this heart and guard it without losing it is to establish the great root; the rest is but easy matters. Foolish people do not know this, all trapped in the lump of flesh and stubborn mind, pondering and guessing—some take the stirring mind as the heart of Heaven and Earth, some the still mind, some the mind dwelling in the central palace—all are mistaken. The stubborn mind is the human mind of postnatal selfish desires; when stirred, it clings to existence; when still, it clings to nonexistence; when dwelling, it clings to images. Such minds are as far from the heart of Heaven and Earth as earth is from mud. For the heart of Heaven and Earth, motion and stillness are one; silent and unmoving, it responds and thus communicates—responds and thus communicates, silent and unmoving. Could this be called the stubborn mind of the lump of flesh?

### The Crescent Furnace

The crescent is the crescent moon resembling the upturned eyebrows of a moth. When the moon wanes to its extreme, darkness gives birth to brightness anew—this symbolizes how, in the utmost stillness of a person, the heavenly root suddenly appears, called the dao heart, resembling the image of the crescent moon. The furnace is the vessel for operating fire; by the yang light of the dao heart, it can refine the yin qi of the whole body. Hence it is also called a furnace, though in truth the dao heart is the heart of Heaven and Earth. Speaking of its essence, it is the heart of Heaven and Earth; speaking of its function, it is the dao heart. One thing with two names. Foolish people do not know this; some take the horizontal bone beneath the elixir field, curved upward, as the crescent furnace; some mistake the curved stroke of the character for heart as the crescent furnace, confusing the lump of flesh heart for it; others, borrowing from warriors, take the birth canal of women as the crescent furnace—all are wrong. The crescent furnace is the radiance of the dao heart; where this light shines, all evil vanishes, enabling one to become sage, enabling one to become immortal. Master Ziyang said: “Stop wasting effort on the elixir stove; refining medicine requires seeking the crescent furnace.” He also said: “Within the crescent furnace the jade blossom grows; inside the cinnabar cauldron the mercury balances; only after the fire’s power is harmonized can the yellow sprout gradually grow.” From this one may understand the meaning of the crescent.

### The Cinnabar Cauldron

Cinnabar is the color of fire; because fire can refine all things, removing the old and bringing forth the new, people use the cauldron as its symbol. Fire is the most numinous and most divine substance; nothing escapes its transformation. This signifies the divine spirit’s all-pervading illumination and the power to accomplish all things. But spirit has two aspects: the primordial spirit and the discerning spirit. The discerning spirit can ruin the dao; the primordial spirit can complete the dao. The discerning spirit carries the karmic dust of kalpas, borrowing the primordial spirit’s numinosity to generate delusions; it does not lose life but does not cease either. The great practice requires using the primordial spirit to control the discerning spirit; when the discerning spirit does not arise, evil fire is extinguished; when evil fire is extinguished, true fire arises; when true fire arises, harmonious qi swirls, life force never ceases, and the great dao becomes attainable. Foolish people do not know this, mistaking the bright, numinous discerning spirit for the primordial spirit—this is wrong. The primordial spirit is the spirit beyond spirits, most numinous and most true; the bright, numinous spirit is a spirit among spirits, though numinous, it is false; the false numinosity is the seed of reincarnation. The ancient immortals said: “The endless kalpas of birth and death are called the original person by fools.” The original person is the discerning spirit.

### The Gate of the Primal Female

Yuan (primordial) is yang, firm, and active; pin (female) is yin, soft, and still. The gate of the primal female is the aperture of yin and yang, the gate of firmness and softness, the pass of motion and stillness. It has no direction, no place, no form, no image; it is like a curved smile, a hollow suspended aperture in the place where the Five Phases do not reach, where the four great elements do not rest—a realm of utmost non-being containing utmost being, utmost emptiness containing utmost substance. It is the one aperture where yin and yang unite. Foolish people do not know this, mistaking the mouth and nose for the primal female—this is wrong. The mouth and nose are the gates of breath’s entrance and exit, not the gates of yin and yang’s entrance and exit. Yin and yang unite to give birth to immortals and Buddhas; how could the breath of mouth and nose give birth to immortals and Buddhas? Master Wuzhen said: “The gate of the primal female is rarely known in the world; do not foolishly take the mouth and nose as it.”

### The One Aperture of the Primal Pass

The primal pass is the utmost primordial and wondrous gate, also called the door of birth and death, the chamber of life and death, the boundary between Heaven and Man, the gate of punishment and virtue, the aperture of being and non-being, the cave of spirit and qi, the land of emptiness and substance, the crossroads, and many other names—all merely describing this one aperture. The primal pass is another name for the gate of the primal female; because yin and yang meet here, it is called the gate of the primal female; because it is primordial and wondrous beyond measure, it is called the primal pass aperture. In truth, all are this one aperture. Foolish people do not know this, some take the place below the heart and above the kidneys as the primal pass, some take the navel as the primal pass, some take the tailbone as the primal pass, some take the paired vertebrae along the spine as the primal pass—all are wrong. The primal pass has no fixed location; if it had a fixed location, it would not be the primal pass. Master Chen Xubai took the place where thoughts arise as the primal pass; this seems so but is not. The place where thoughts arise has already fallen into postnatal forms; how can it be the primal pass? Now I clearly point out to the public: between the dim and the obscure, at the juncture where being and non-being enter each other, Master Wuzhen said: “In the midst of dimness seek form; within the depths of obscurity seek true essence; being and non-being enter each other here; without seeing this, how can one imagine success?” Also, the Four Hundred Characters say: “This aperture is no ordinary aperture; Heaven and Earth unite to form it; it is called the cave of spirit and qi; within it lies the essence of Kan and Li.” This truly refers to the one aperture of the primal pass.

### The Spirit of the Valley

The spirit of the valley is the spirit of the empty valley, commonly called the cliff child. Because two mountains rise high, with a valley between, when a person shouts, the voice echoes within the valley, hence the name spirit of the valley. The way of cultivation borrows this to symbolize the body’s void and numinous spirit. When the heart is void, it is numinous; when not void, not numinous. Spirit arises from void, also called the spirit of the valley. Spirit is formless and imageless, numinous and unfathomable. The so-called silent stillness and responsive communication is this spirit; the so-called condensed sacred embryo is also this spirit. Foolish people do not know this, taking the spirit residing in the heavenly valley as the spirit of the valley, or the spirit guarding the Yellow Court as the spirit of the valley—all are wrong. If the spirit resides in the heavenly valley or guards the Yellow Court, then it is not void; if not void, how can there be spirit? Without void, no spirit; how could it be called the spirit of the valley? Master Wuzhen said: “To have the spirit of the valley long and immortal, one must rely on the primal female to establish the root. When true essence returns to the golden chamber, a single numinous light never departs.” The primal female united in the center is void; void means true spirit always remains unextinguished. True essence, numinous light, and spirit of the valley all symbolize one and the same true spirit.

### The Golden Cauldron and Jade Furnace

The golden cauldron is a firm and solid object, symbolizing a person’s focused will, able to carry the dao; also called the Dry Cauldron. The jade furnace is gentle and calm, symbolizing gradual progress in practice, able to endure long; also called the Moist Cauldron. Foolish people do not know this, forging iron cauldrons, making clay stoves, burning metals and stones, vainly hoping to form the elixir—this is wrong. Formed furnaces and cauldrons can only refine tangible mundane medicines, not intangible immortal medicines. The ancient immortals said: “Cauldrons have no cauldrons, furnaces have no furnaces.” Their so-called cauldrons and furnaces refer to the dual use of firmness and softness in cultivation; only by employing both can one succeed. Just as in refining, one cannot have a cauldron without a furnace, nor a furnace without a cauldron; both together are needed to complete the medicine.

### The Black Crow and White Hare

At midday, there is the Golden Crow, the yin within yang; at midnight, the Jade Hare, the yang within yin. The sun in the hexagram is Li, outer yang and inner yin, symbolizing the meaning of softness within firmness; the moon in the hexagram is Kan, outer yin and inner yang, symbolizing firmness within softness. The way of the Golden Elixir takes only the softness within firmness and the firmness within softness—these two great medicines of true yin and true yang, fused into one qi to form the elixir. They are called medicines because true yin and true yang can reverse aging and restore youth, prolonging life. As for the coiled tortoise and snake, the mutual aid of water and fire, these too follow the same principle, merely symbolic images to confirm the unity of true yin and true yang. Foolish people do not know this, suspecting that the words “Black Crow” and “White Hare” mean orally inhaling the sun’s essence and moon’s radiance, or visually receiving them—this is wrong. Heaven has its sun and moon; humans have their sun and moon. The true yin and true yang of the human body are the human Black Crow and White Hare sun and moon. The sun and moon essence at the horizon is far from us; how could we gather it? If one says one can gather it, what is gathered is external evil qi, which over time causes internal bloating and external blindness—no benefit, only harm.

### The Meeting of Dragon and Tiger

The dragon’s nature is soft, governing life, belonging to wood, represented by the hexagram Zhen, symbolizing human softness. Zhen is fundamentally yang but takes softness as its image, yang less and yin more. The tiger’s nature is firm, governing death, belonging to metal, represented by the hexagram Dui, symbolizing human firmness. Dui is fundamentally yin but takes firmness as its image, yin less and yang more. This nature and this feeling, when separated, cause qi nature and dusty feelings to harm life; when harmonized, they become true nature and true feeling, enhancing life. The meeting of dragon and tiger means nature seeks feeling, feeling returns to nature, the unity of nature and feeling. As for the eastern family’s daughter and western family’s son, paired as husband and wife, eldest son and youngest daughter, the union of two families, the combination of metal and wood—these images all symbolize the meeting of true nature and true feeling. Foolish people do not know this, taking the liver as the dragon and the lungs as the tiger, moving liver and lung qi to the navel or elixir field or Yellow Court, thinking this is the dragon and tiger coupling—this is wrong. The liver and lung qi are all postnatal, tangible qi; not only can they not condense in one place, but if forcibly gathered, over time they become poison, incurable, hastening death. How foolish indeed!

### The Inversion of Kan and Li

The hexagram Kan is outer yin and inner yang; Li is outer yang and inner yin. Inner yang is water; inner yin is fire. The way of the elixir takes the yang within Kan to fill the yin within Li, using water to aid fire—this is called water above fire, fire below water, the inversion of Kan and Li, symbolizing the divine water of true knowledge of the dao, subduing the evil fire of human spiritual knowledge. My true knowledge is dark outside and bright inside, like Kan with outer yin and inner yang; my spiritual knowledge is bright outside and dark inside, like Li with outer yang and inner yin. Using true knowledge to control spiritual knowledge, and spiritual knowledge to follow true knowledge, true spirit is one, condensed into the elixir, like the inversion of Kan and Li, water and fire mutually aiding. As for the images of infants, maidens, black lead, and red mercury, these all symbolize the union of true knowledge and spiritual knowledge. Foolish people do not know this, taking the kidney as Kan and the heart as Li, moving kidney qi upward to meet the heart, and heart qi downward to the kidney as the inversion of Kan and Li; or taking the inner elixir as male and female infants, male below and female above as inversion of Kan and Li; or refining black lead into mercury, or heating fire under the furnace and storing water above the cauldron as inversion of Kan and Li, water and fire aiding—these are all wrong. The way of cultivating the true is to cultivate the true; all tangible dross and evil deeds are false, not true—how could they produce truth?

### The Inversion of the Five Phases

The Five Phases in proper sequence generate: wood generates fire, metal generates water; inverted, fire generates wood, water generates metal. Fire generating wood means the wood born of fire is forever indestructible, like wood meeting fire, refined into charcoal, buried in the earth to endure forever. Water generating metal means the metal born of water is forever indestructible, like molten metal cooled into ingots, shining extra bright. Fire generating wood symbolizes a person’s true nature refined in the great primal furnace, emerging as an unshakable nature; water generating metal symbolizes a person’s true feeling crossing the sea of desire, becoming forever pure and unstained. The ancient immortals said: “The Five Phases in order are the fiery pit of the dharma realm; the Five Phases inverted are the seven treasures of the great earth.” Foolish people do not know this, thinking moving east and west, taking from below to patch above, pushing forward and moving backward is the inversion of the Five Phases—this is wrong. One’s entire body is pure yin; internally heart, liver, spleen, lungs, kidneys; externally eyes, ears, nose, tongue, body—all are false things. When throat qi is cut off, it is but a pile of foul bones and flesh; where is anything true? If one uses these false things to vainly think to realize nature and life, how could it be possible?

### The Yellow Matchmaker

The Yellow Matchmaker is the central earth mother; because she can regulate yin and yang and harmonize the four images, she is called the Yellow Matchmaker. The elixir texts borrow this to symbolize the true intention within a person’s true faith, able to harmonize nature and feeling, nourishing the spirit. True intention and true faith are the Yellow Matchmaker within us, the so-called yellow that penetrates principle. Foolish people do not know this, taking the intention to move the five organs’ qi to unite as the Yellow Matchmaker; some wicked ones use a talkative old woman to tease men and women into debauchery, taking a virgin’s first menstruation plum as the Yellow Matchmaker—this is a great error. True earth has no place, true intention no form; it gives birth to all things and contains all principles, able to unite the three teachings and gather the Five Phases, hence called the Yellow Matchmaker. How could it be the intention of thought, the witch of an old woman?

### The Two-Eight Strings

Between the moon’s waning and waxing, it crosses with the sun; on the third day, a faint light appears; on the eighth day, yin is half yang, like a bowstring—this is the upper string. On the sixteenth day, the moon is full; on the nineteenth day, a faint black appears within the yin womb. On the twenty-third day, yang is half yin, like a bowstring—this is the lower string. The upper string obtains eight taels of gold in water; the lower string obtains eight taels of water in gold; two and eight make one jin; gold and water balance, yin and yang unite. The elixir texts borrow this to symbolize the matching of firmness and softness, neither偏 nor偏, perfectly centered and upright. Foolish people do not know this, taking a boy at sixteen as two-eight, with the two strings’ qi full, then forcibly closing the yin essence; or taking eight taels of black lead and half a jin of mercury as two-eight string medicines, burning and ingesting them—this is wrong. The Four Hundred Characters say: “Upper string gold eight taels, lower string water half jin; the two strings unite their essence, and the body of Heaven and Earth is formed.” The two strings are one yin and one yang. Qian is firm and yang; Kun is soft and yin; yin and yang paired, the body of Heaven and Earth formed; the elixir’s origin has form—thus one may understand the meaning of the two strings.

### The Millet Pearl

Before a person is born, within the embryonic sac, all is confused and chaotic, dim and bewildered, only a single undifferentiated qi swirling, nothing else. This is called the Great Unity containing true qi. This qi is most divine, most wondrous, most void, most numinous, containing non-being and harboring being. The Three Origins, Eight Trigrams, Four Images, and Five Phases are all contained within it. Therefore, though formless, it can transform; hence transformations are endless. The five viscera, six bowels, nine orifices, and hundreds of bones all naturally form from it. Because it is most divine and wondrous, most void and numinous, it is also called true spirit, also called the spirit beyond spirit. When within the mother’s womb, one qi contains truth, called true qi; upon leaving the womb, spirit contains one qi, called spirit qi. One qi is essence, that is true emptiness; true spirit is function, that is wondrous being. True qi and true spirit, true emptiness and wondrous being, though named differently, are one truth. This truth is formless, imageless, soundless, odorless; it cannot be transmitted by words or depicted by brush. Its semblance is but as small as a millet grain; hence the ancient immortals all call this truth the millet treasure pearl. Though called millet, it has no millet shape; because it has a point of numinous qi hidden in the center, it is named millet; because it has a point of millet spirit and yet is chaotic void, containing all the Three Realms, it is named millet pearl. Ultimately, it is the primal qi before the great chaos was divided. Foolish people do not know this, mistaking the first menstruation plum of a girl as the millet pearl, or practitioners whose spirit resides in the bright hall, whose eyes scatter outward, as the millet pearl—this is wrong. The millet pearl before the great chaos is the numinous treasure for giving birth to sages and worthies, for becoming immortals and Buddhas; how could it be the turbid blood or the light of stored thoughts! The Four Hundred Characters say: “Chaos contains the void; the void contains the Three Realms; tracing its root source, it is as large as a millet grain.” Master Sanfeng said: “Who does not know it? Who cannot do it? Who does not practice it? All are lost on the one millet grain before the great chaos was divided.”

### The Fire Timing Hexagrams

The elixir scriptures all borrow the sixty-four hexagrams as images of the yang fire and yin talisman methods. Qian and Kun, the two hexagrams, are taken as the cauldron and furnace, representing firmness and softness as essence; Kan and Li, the two hexagrams, are taken as the medicines, representing firmness and softness in balance as function; Gua, the two hexagrams, represent the boundary of yin and yang, showing that firmness and softness each have their seasons of operation; Zhun and Meng, the two hexagrams, represent the beginning of creation, showing that when advancing fire one must use firmness, when retreating fire one must use softness; Jiwei represents the end of creation, showing that yang fire uses firmness and must not be excessive, yin talisman uses softness and must not be insufficient. The remaining fifty-four hexagrams all follow the natural operation of the ten hexagrams of Qian, Kun, Kan, Li, Gua, Zhun, Meng, and Jiwei. In summary, it is always yin and yang balanced, two becoming one, returning to the image of mixed formation before completion. Foolish people do not know this, forcibly applying the sixty-four hexagrams to year, month, day, and hour to make功—this is wrong. Heaven and Earth’s yin and yang creation is one qi flowing, cycling endlessly; how could it be governed by the sixty-four hexagrams? The sixty-four hexagrams are the sages’ observation of Heaven and Earth’s images, embodying yin and yang creation; the sixty-four hexagrams are but annotations of yin and yang creation. The human body’s creation aligns with Heaven and Earth’s creation and naturally has sixty-four hexagrams; how could one be bound by mere texts and images?

### The Gate of Birth

The moon moves to the southwest, wanes to its extreme and is born anew; southwest belongs to Kun, the pure yin direction. Beneath pure yin, a yang secretly arises, with the image of upper Kun and lower Zhen; in the hexagram this is Fu, in the moon this is the crescent moon—both symbolize that in utmost stillness, the heavenly heart suddenly reveals itself; also called the dao heart, also called the heavenly good true heart, the previously mentioned crescent furnace. If one sees this heart and guards it without losing it, borrowing it to advance yang and retreat yin, like a cat catching a mouse, yang will surely gradually arise, yin gradually retreat, yin exhausted and yang pure—then one is immortal. Therefore, the southwest Kun position is called the gate of birth. Foolish people do not know this, mistaking the woman’s birth canal as the gate of birth—this is wrong. The birth canal is the place of human birth; how could it give birth to immortals?

### The Door of Death

The moon moves to the northeast, the yang light is about to vanish; northeast belongs to Gen, yin qi is about to be pure, yang light is slight, with the image of upper Gen and lower Kun; in the hexagram this is Bo, in the moon this is the inverted bowl—both symbolize the guest qi stripping away the true yuan. If there is a man who has left the world, a brave man, who suddenly awakens and turns back, borrowing this slight remaining yang to illuminate and break through darkness, with effort and cultivation, it is not difficult to return to the root and revert to the origin. All ordinary people, confused and unawakened, follow the yin qi to strip away yang; when yang is exhausted and yin is pure, how can they not die? The Book of Changes says: “Northeast loses friends.” The elixir texts also call this the door of death. Foolish people do not know this, mistaking the woman’s birth canal as the door of death—this is wrong. The gates of birth and death are both formless and imageless portals; because following yin leads to death, reversing yang leads to life, they are named birth gate and death door, but in truth they are but one aperture. The ancient immortals call it the pass of life and death. Though called a pass, it has no direction or place; this is a forced name. Master Wuzhen said: “One must take the door of death as the door of life; do not cling to calling the birth gate the death gate. If one understands the killing mechanism and returns, then harm turns to grace.” Thus one may understand the meaning of the gates of birth and death.

### The Aperture of Action

The way of action is the功 of observing desires and apertures. Observing apertures means observing the apertures of yin and yang creation, borrowing postnatal to return to prenatal, harmonizing the four images, gathering the Five Phases, gathering medicines and advancing fire, returning the elixir and forming the embryo—the order of the process all lies within. Without the oral transmission and heart teaching of a true master, a hair’s difference leads to a thousand-mile error. Foolish people do not know this, playing with qi and blood on the postnatal illusory skin bag, thinking this is the way of action—this is wrong. The way of the Golden Elixir, the study of the prenatal, can twist yin and yang, steal creation, reverse the qi mechanism, overturn Heaven and Earth, a way prenatal and not against Heaven—how could it be done by fabricating the postnatal body with form and substance? Master Zhengyang said: “Tears, saliva, essence, qi, blood, and seven kinds of spiritual substances are all yin. If one takes these as the root of the elixir, how can one ascend to the Jade Capital?” Master Ziyang said: “Swallowing essence and receiving qi is the human practice; with medicine formulas one can create transformation and life. If the cauldron lacks the true seed, it is like cooking an empty pot.” Alas! The golden toad and jade crow—only the true knowers are true practitioners. The way of action is not easily understood!

### The Subtlety of Non-Action

The way of non-action is the功 of observing the subtle without desire; it is the matter after the sacred embryo condenses, the subtle observation of the transformation of one qi. After the sacred embryo condenses, the postnatal has returned to prenatal; only bathing and gentle nurturing功 are needed, neither forgetting nor assisting. Using the natural true fire to steam and warm, transformation happens naturally; formless gives rise to form, formless substance gives rise to substance; like a melon ripening and the stem falling off, the infant appears. The previous功 of cooking with martial fire is all abandoned and unused. Foolish people do not know what it means to exhaust nature and life, what cultivation is; they learn some side-door tricks and minor methods, then enter the mountains to sit quietly or close the gate to calm the spirit, thinking this is non-action—this is wrong. Nature and life must be cultivated together;功 must be done in two stages: one action to first complete life, one non-action to then complete nature. How could empty quiet sitting and calming the spirit alone complete nature and life? Master Wuzhen said: “Do not enter the mountain before refining the elixir; inside and outside the mountain are all not lead. This kind of supreme treasure is in every home; only fools do not fully recognize it.” He also said: “At first action is unseen; when non-action arrives, all begin to know. They see only non-action as the essential subtlety, not knowing action is the root foundation.” Thus one may know action and non-action each have their seasons and functions, vastly different.

### Blending with the World and Harmonizing Light

Blending with the world and harmonizing light is the功 of great concealment in city and market. Blending with the world means mixing among the vulgar so people do not recognize; harmonizing light means harmonizing without sameness, appearing in dust yet transcending dust. To blend with the world and harmonize light is to be outwardly round and responsive, inwardly square and sovereign; to follow worldly laws while cultivating dao laws; manifest and conceal, oppose and follow, without obstruction or hindrance—thus the way is easiest. Foolish people do not know this, suspecting blending with the world and harmonizing light is for daytime affairs, and at night one cultivates stillness—this is wrong. If so, then following the world is acceptable, but blending with the world is not; covering the light is acceptable, but harmonizing light is not. The way of blending with the world and harmonizing light has the power to seize Heaven and Earth’s creation, to steal the secret of yin and yang’s life and death—how could it be easy to know or easy to practice?

### Medicine Returns to the Earth Cauldron

Earth is gentle and warm, able to nourish things; the cauldron governs cooking and boiling, able to complete things. The cauldron is named for earth, the vessel for nourishing and completing things—not ordinary earth, not ordinary cauldrons. Medicine returning to the earth cauldron symbolizes the union of yin and yang, the功 of condensing and nurturing the sacred embryo. To nurture the sacred embryo depends entirely on one intention undispersed, holding the mean, yin and yang balanced, neither偏 nor偏; hence it is also called the earth cauldron. Ultimately, it is but the one character 中. Guarding this center is the subtle secret of nurturing the sacred embryo. Foolish people do not know this, digging earth furnaces to nurture cinnabar, taking mercury from cinnabar as the earth cauldron; or making clay furnaces as ash pits, burning lead into ash pits to separate silver, taking ash pits as earth cauldrons—all are wrong. Master Ziye said: “True earth has no place, true intention no form; only the central earth cauldron is formless and imageless, without direction or place; because it can complete the sacred embryo, it is called the cauldron—how could it be the clay cauldron?”

### Condensing the Sacred Embryo

The sacred embryo is the embryo of the sage. It is the infant’s original face, without awareness or knowledge. The dao reaches no awareness or knowledge; all spirits gather, all conditions cease; confused and chaotic, entering the realm of dimness and obscurity, from having form entering non-action. Foolish people do not know this, taking the mingled heart fluid and kidney qi meeting in the Yellow Court as the sacred embryo; or the spirit residing in the central palace as the sacred embryo; or moving qi up and down, residing in the elixir field as the sacred embryo—all are wrong. The sacred embryo has no form or substance; though called an embryo, there is no embryo to be seen. The so-called embryo is merely a metaphor for the true spirit condensed and undispersed. If one forcibly condenses qi and blood into an embryo, this is a ghost embryo hastening death, not the sacred embryo of longevity.

### The Ten-Month Embryo Completion

The ten-month embryo completion is the image of spirit perfected, qi full, root and dust withdrawn, guest qi digested, yin exhausted and yang pure; like a woman carrying a child, only after ten months can it be perfected. The way of the elixir uses ten-month embryo completion as metaphor, taking its meaning that after the sacred embryo condenses, one must guard against danger and worry, bathing and gently nurturing, aiming for perfect completion without loss—not that ten months is a fixed period. Foolish people do not know this, suspecting the words “ten months” mean moving qi, or storing thoughts, or condensing spirit, vainly imagining forming the embryo with ten months as a fixed period—this is wrong. The way of cultivating the true, from gathering medicines, cooking, refining, forming elixir and embryo, to dao completion and transformation, requires infinite功; how could it be limited to ten months? Thus one may know ten months is but a metaphor.

### The Infant’s Appearance

The infant’s appearance is the sacred embryo’s transformation and emergence. The sacred embryo is a dharma body hidden within the colored body; transformation means the dharma body is born within the colored body. Because the colored body gives birth to a dharma body, like a woman bearing a child for ten months and giving birth to an infant, it is called the infant of the dharma body. When the infant appears, there is a body outside the body, leaping beyond the Three Realms, not within the Five Phases, escaping reincarnation, sharing Heaven and Earth’s longevity, sharing sun and moon’s duration. Foolish people do not know this, taking the true yang within Kan as the dharma body infant, or the kidney essence as the dharma body infant—this is wrong. The infant within Kan is the yang within yin; the dharma body infant is the true fusion of yin and yang; kidney qi is the evil fire within the kidney, utterly unrelated to the infant—how could these be confused? Master Wuzhen said: “The infant is one containing true qi; ten-month embryo completion enters the sacred foundation.” The Four Hundred Characters say: “When husband and wife unite, the bridal chamber clouds and rains; after one year a child is born; each one rides a crane.” Thus one may know the teaching of the dharma body infant.

### Moving the Furnace and Changing the Cauldron

When the great dao is fully accomplished, with a body outside the body, form and spirit both wondrous, having reached the stage of the great sage, the furnace and cauldron are no longer needed; what need is there to move or change furnace and cauldron? The reason for moving and changing furnace and cauldron is to secretly nurture and transform the dharma body, manifesting divine powers. What furnace is moved? What cauldron is changed? The ethereal void is the cauldron; non-action is the furnace; the previous dry cauldron, moist furnace, cinnabar cauldron, crescent furnace—all these medicines are no longer used. Only the dharma body is used. The dharma body dwells in void and non-being, self-transforming and self-changing; the more void, the more divine; the more non-being, the more wondrous; divine and wondrous beyond measure, transformations endless; so-called child and grandchild, grandchild and branch—upon reaching this stage, cease功, break void, leap into the realm of Great Luo, then it is proper. Later students, not having true transmission, think that having a body outside the body is the end of the dao—this is wrong. The Knocking Yao Song says: “One thing is none, following the manifest dao; the five directions reveal the true person’s face; immortal boys and girls welcome with colorful clouds; in the palace of five wisdoms, true proclamations.” From this one knows the dharma body’s myriad transformations are the supreme功 indeed.
