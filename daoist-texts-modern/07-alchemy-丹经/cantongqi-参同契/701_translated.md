# Poem of Dispelling Doubts: Fifty Seven-Character Quatrains

### Leaving the World

The thousand affairs of the world are all untrue,  
Worldly ties and loves most harm the body through.  
Cut clean with one stroke, no lingering thread,  
Freed within the field, become your own true self.

### Refining Sleep

Sleeping less is not to forge the sleep demon,  
Forget meals, forsake rest, sever the creeping vine.  
Sweep away all ties, the heart grows clear and still,  
Long slumber day and night—what is there to fear?

### Merits and Practice

Cultivation and virtue come first in the way,  
Great merit, deep practice moves even Heaven’s sway.  
Fools laugh, seeking only their selfish gain,  
No merit, scant effort, yet dream of immortal reign.

### Golden Elixir

The primordial nature is called the Elixir true,  
In the Eight Trigrams furnace it is forged anew.  
The world’s lost seekers chase medicines outside,  
Swallowing meals in vain, dreaming clouds as their guide.

### Primordial Pass

The primordial pass, one orifice few know,  
Vague and obscure, it holds the yin and yang’s flow.  
Follow its course to leave the road of vexing pain,  
Turn against it, and the sage’s base you gain.

### Conscious Spirit

Thought and spirit together make the conscious soul,  
Seeds of rebirth carry dust’s root and whole.  
Fools play with wandering ghosts in endless spin,  
In the end, who truly sees the master within?

### Yang Essence

Yang essence, one point, secret mountain form,  
Know it truly, and your visage stays warm.  
Not in heart, not in kidney’s deep core,  
Neither empty nor color, it hides the primordial door.

### Primordial Qi

Primordial qi dwells in the vast chaos wide,  
Formless, shapeless, it does not abide.  
Recognize the face of birth’s first true light,  
Then know a master dwells within your sight.

### Prior and Later Heaven

Before birth, the body dwells in Prior Heaven’s grace,  
Once born, qi and form join in one place.  
The ancient sages and later men part two ways,  
Careful discernment is needed to navigate their maze.

### First Scripture

The First Scripture is the treasure of Prior Heaven,  
Vague and obscure, the true essence of one.  
Pure white, flawless, a clear and clean thing,  
Do not let turbid blood falsely claim its name’s ring.

### Three Medicines

Great medicines are essence, qi, and spirit three,  
Formed things are not their true reality.  
Most refined and pure, ethereal and bright,  
Refined to diamond body, the great dharma’s light.

### Nature and Life

Nature and life originally split prior and later,  
Born into form, the latter’s path grows greater.  
Later nature and life follow Heaven’s wheel,  
Grasp the Prior Heaven, and you hold the seal.

### Heart of Heaven and Earth

Where hides the heart of Heaven and Earth’s domain?  
Yin and yang respond, manifesting round light’s reign.  
In the void cauldron, cooked and ripened through,  
Eternal and unblemished, unchanged and true.

### Dao Heart and Human Heart

Human heart is iron, Dao heart is gold,  
Measured with care in dangers untold.  
Change flows freely, no high or low,  
Living water springs from the source’s flow.

### Before Birth

Before birth, who knows where the body lies?  
Quiet, still, in chaos it hides.  
Four images, Five Phases have not yet come,  
One blended qi, no male or female sum.

### At First Birth

What is the face at first birth’s dawn?  
Prior and Later Heaven’s qi is drawn.  
No thought, no knowledge, no stain or mark,  
Seeds of Buddha, Immortal, sage’s spark.

### Other’s Home

Another’s home is not another’s place,  
Mistaking it early leads far from grace.  
My child lost outside, confused and torn,  
Call once, face appears, following the lord sworn.

### Self and Other

Scriptures say self and other split yin and yang,  
Neither form nor void, a pure and clear land.  
Those who gather warlike pills and evil arts,  
In smoky dens spoil the heavens and hearts.

### Companions

Companions must be divided by inner and outer cause,  
Within the body, two or three abide because.  
Outside, companions assist and uphold,  
Escape the wheel of rebirth through kalpas old.

### External Protection

All seek outside guards to hope for success,  
Buy cauldrons, cook lead, chase wind’s wildness.  
How can they know Heaven’s secret beyond the mundane,  
Borrowing great power to quell foolish pain?

### Nine Cauldrons

The nine numbers of Qian are pure yang’s might,  
Nine cauldrons refine the Elixir bright.  
Sinful lost seekers guess at the female cauldron’s art,  
Resolutely cast into the iron-bound heart.

### Summoning

Summoning Prior Heaven has secret ways,  
Strike the zither, beat bamboo, see the void’s rays.  
Noise of form and sound cannot impede,  
With a flick, turn back the Northern Dipper’s seed.

### Reversal

Reversing yin and yang, what’s so hard?  
In stillness, move spirit and guard.  
Dao heart shines, human heart fades,  
Stand firm, climb the hundred-foot pole’s blades.

### Fire Timing

Moving fire’s work has no set time,  
Morning diligence, evening watch, cut the three corpses’ crime.  
Guard against danger, keep quiet and clear,  
Respond to things without loss or fear.

### Hexagrams

Fire timing scripture speaks of Zhouyi’s hex,  
Pushing lines, holding images—all are not correct.  
Mostly one must grasp yin and yang’s law,  
Advance and retreat as time’s finger draw.

### Qian and Kun Furnace

Qian’s cauldron, Kun’s furnace dwell in my frame,  
Do not ask outside for their name.  
Hard and soft are never apart,  
Temper the primordial qi’s true heart.

### Waning Moon Furnace

Ask what is the Waning Moon furnace’s name?  
Black hides white, dark dims but revives again.  
Clearly points to the Elixir mother’s face,  
Awakening those who know, none can erase.

### Cinnabar Cauldron

Cultivating truth depends on cinnabar’s cauldron,  
Neither iron, nor gold, nor silver’s own.  
Recognize the spirit’s bright subtle thing,  
Discard the old, take the new, see primordial being.

### Earth Cauldron

Earth cauldron is not made of mere soil,  
Center’s true place is its genuine coil.  
Wood, metal, water, fire all gather here,  
Nourish the primordial pearl, shining clear through the night’s sphere.

### Dipper Handle

Watching the Dipper handle’s turning round,  
First grasp life’s pulse in that bound.  
Twist the root, flip the face,  
In the fire, a golden lotus takes place.

### Two Strings

Lower string is water, upper string is gold,  
They regulate yin and yang’s hold.  
When hard and soft blend as one,  
Nirvana’s heart is shown in the sun.

### Ren and Gui

Ren water is yang, Gui water is yin,  
How many students chase these within?  
At the pivot, true and false divide,  
Discard the turbid, keep the clear, birth white gold inside.

### Refining Self

Cultivation and refining self come first,  
Cut desire, forget feelings, sever all thirst.  
Six thieves and three pests all cut away,  
Clean and pure, one elixir field stays.

### Foundation Building

Steadfast will is foundation laid,  
Body and mind unmoved, a wondrous aid.  
Though calamities and disasters come near,  
Still waters without waves, all things clear.

### Lead and Mercury

True mercury is not the world’s dust,  
True lead is not mountain lead’s crust.  
One feeling, one nature, Prior Heaven’s drug,  
Temper and return root, the great restoration hug.

### Female and Infant

The female hidden in Li is not true,  
Infant in Kan is also hard to pursue.  
Now speak and break yin-yang’s gate,  
Can be real or void, producing dharma’s state.

### Kan and Li

Do not seek Kan and Li to north or south,  
Fire’s nature flies, water flows beneath mouth.  
If these two things can turn upside down,  
Water rises, fire falls, Elixir crown.

### Zhen and Dui

Dui is not west, Zhen is not east,  
Nature confused, passion lost, qi’s feast.  
Master passion returning to nature’s law,  
In a flash, see the master’s raw.

### Zi and Wu

Zi and Wu do not seek day and night,  
Within the body is a compass bright.  
Yin and yang, movement and stillness flow,  
In calm, always hear the ancient’s glow.

### Mao and You

Bathing scripture says Mao and You’s time,  
Form and qi balanced, no flaw or crime.  
Fools do not know yin-yang’s meeting,  
Morning and evening, sit in quiet greeting.

### Yellow Matron

Male and female matched by Yellow Matron’s hand,  
Wu and Ji form the tablet of creation’s land.  
Ask about Yellow Matron’s true message sent,  
One sincere feeling harmonizes Five Phases’ intent.

### Returning Elixir

Why is the Elixir called the Returning Elixir?  
Five qi separate, each alone to fix.  
Bright goodness returns to origin’s seat,  
Body and mind unmoved, formed into a complete.

### Elixir Ripens

When Elixir returns, another way appears,  
No need to add or subtract more yang’s gears.  
Natural divine fire refines in the furnace deep,  
Bursting forth a single light that reaches heaven’s keep.

### Sacred Embryo

The sacred embryo is no form of flesh,  
Qi gathers, spirit condenses, true seed enmesh.  
Guard against danger, be cautious and wise,  
Carelessness brings disaster’s surprise.

### Shedding the Embryo

Sacred embryo sheds and transforms to true,  
Ten months’ work nourishes the grain spirit through.  
Yang qi purest, yin qi spent,  
From empty space leaps forth an immortal gent.

### Action

Action is not mere play of skin and shell,  
All contrivings bring wounds that swell.  
How to know heart’s true wondrous art?  
Ghosts and gods cannot twist yin and yang’s part.

### Non-Action

Non-action is not stubborn void,  
Still must not forget nor help avoid.  
Pull out the seeds of rebirth and death’s chain,  
Within lies but one divine child’s reign.

### Returning Gua

Yin extreme returns to yang through fire’s gate,  
Pure yang moves Gua to yin’s fate.  
Yin charm and yang fire without error,  
Forge Prior Heaven’s Great Ultimate mirror.

### Civil and Martial

Fierce force subdues demons in martial art,  
Humble heart nourishes qi in civil part.  
Know danger and fortune, change with the hour,  
Golden light shines bright in every bower.

### Harmonizing Light

Harmonizing light blends with the world’s dust,  
Secret Heaven’s mechanism, rare and just.  
Always respond, always clear, always free,  
At any moment shed old, don new robe’s decree.
