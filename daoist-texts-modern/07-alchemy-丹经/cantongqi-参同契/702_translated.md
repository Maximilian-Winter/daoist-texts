# On the True Aperture of the Primordial Female

For the seeker who wishes to cultivate the Great Dao and bring to completion both nature and life, nothing comes before recognizing the Gate of the Primordial Female. This Gate of the Primordial Female is none other than the One Aperture of the Primordial Pass. This aperture has a gate with two leaves—one opens, one closes—standing nine feet tall and five feet wide. Outside the gate stands the Numinous Official as guardian; within, the Dragon and Tiger stand watch.

Inside is a central hall, a single chamber, from which all directions extend. There dwells a Perfected One, hair disheveled, feet bare, clad in a garment woven of five colors. Around the waist is tied a long sash of yellow and green. In hand is held a golden light, a ruyi scepter of radiant power. Seated steadily upon a bed of naturalness, the Perfected One leans against a shadowless screen behind, while before hangs a crystal lamp. The entrance is sealed by hanging curtains, neither stirred nor swayed by wind or breath.

Ordinary eyes dare not lightly open here; mouths do not speak without cause. To the left stands a Golden Youth; to the right, a Jade Maiden. At times, the Perfected One’s eyes open wide, and light fills Heaven and Earth; darkness and the nether regions are illuminated, nowhere remains concealed. At times, the mouth parts, and breath fills the cosmos; ghosts, demons, and evil spirits all flee afar.

This Perfected One holds the power of creation and transformation, grasps the mechanisms of yin and yang, wields the ledger of life and death, and commands the scepter of nature and destiny.

If a person can behold this vision with sincere heart, bow reverently, and attend day and night without ever departing, the Perfected One offers the Wine of Life Extension and the Pill of Longevity. Those who taste them are reborn, their bodies renewed, passing from death into life.

Yet in the world, few are true men of valor, true heroes of spirit. Most cannot endure hardship, cannot bear the long journey. They do not exhaust the root and fundamental principle, but fixate solely on the tangible forms and images of the Primordial Pass, speaking of the Primordial Female. They engage in trifling methods of emptiness and attachment, vainly imagining they have attained the Dao. Alas, how pitiful!

If one is truly a genuine hero, one must utterly let go, cast all conditions into emptiness, and focus with care on the great matter of one’s own body. Seek out a true master, make friends with good companions, and preserve an unchanging thought to the very end of life. The Primordial Pass will surely be known; the Primordial Female will surely be seen; nature and life will finally be completed.

Students, strive diligently in this!
