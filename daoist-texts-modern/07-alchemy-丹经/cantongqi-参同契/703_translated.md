# Essential Secrets of Cultivating the True

The Great Dao rests in effortless naturalness,  
Without diligent practice, no circle finds its square.  
At the crossroads of three paths, seek the seed of truth;  
Within the Eight Trigrams furnace, temper the nature of Heaven.  

A bottomless law-boat can ferry across the sea,  
With medicines carried close, life’s span may extend.  
Within punishment hides virtue, subtle and hard to gauge;  
From harm springs grace—keep the heart wholly focused.  

Harmonize the Four Symbols to return to the original face,  
Cluster the Five Phases tightly to grow the golden lotus long.  
Only by adding and subtracting does the marvel arise;  
Knowing fortune and misfortune is the gateway to the profound.  

Shed all entanglements of dust and defilement,  
Become wholly what was before father and mother were born.  
To cultivate immortals or to become Buddha both come from here,  
The other two—void and mystery—both lead astray and wander afar.
