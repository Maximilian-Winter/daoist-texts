# Direct Pointing to Realization

## Preface to *Direct Pointing to Realization*

The dao of cultivating the true is the study that exhausts principle, fully comprehends nature, and reaches destiny. Therefore, to exhaust one’s nature, one must first delve into the principle of that nature; to reach one’s destiny, one must first exhaust the principle of that destiny. When one can illuminate these principles, then true knowledge is certain and clear, no longer confused by falsehoods. One can thus exhaust nature and reach destiny. Otherwise, if one does not exhaust these principles, right and wrong become indistinct, good and evil indistinguishable; one wanders into side doors and crooked paths, clinging to emptiness and grasping appearances. This is not cultivating the true, but pursuing the false. The study of falsehood drifts ever further from the dao, thereby deceiving one’s own nature and destiny—how then can one cultivate and maintain nature and destiny?

This is the very reason the Immortal Elder Ziyang composed the *Treatise on Realization*. This treatise probes the hidden and searches the obscure, drawing deeply and reaching far—drawing from distant things, drawing near to the self, comparing images in manifold ways. Its original wish was for everyone to realize the true and each to cultivate the true. Yet alas, later generations of foolish and confused disciples, lacking true transmission, cling to images and muddy texts, recklessly guessing and privately debating—some taking it as secret alchemy, some as mere burning and refining, some suspecting emptiness and silence, others entangled in grasping appearances—greatly missing the compassionate heart of the Immortal Elder who sought to guide the world.

The earlier enlightened annotators and commentators did not lack fine interpretations, but even the finest remained so by explaining images with images, metaphors with metaphors, hiding the head and revealing the tail, speaking of the mother while concealing the son. They did not clearly and openly reveal the path, leaving learners bewildered and ignorant, unable to ultimately realize it. They did not understand realization; they only narrated realization.

Alas! The more annotations there are, the more obscure the principles become; the wider the writings, the more confused the people grow. The right path declines day by day, the wrong path flourishes day by day; true teachings sink day by day, false teachings rise day by day, strange and bizarre beyond measure. No wonder the Confucians regard Daoism as heresy.

I, a humble one, having heard the fragrant breeze in the shrine valley, know this book to be the cavern of dao’s principles, the heavenly ladder to becoming true. Its roots and origins of nature and destiny, its fire and timing, not one is lacking. Yet for long it has been covered by evil teachings, like dark clouds hiding the sun, its radiance dimmed.

I, a lowly disciple fortunate to be near the gate and wall, cannot bear to withhold this true treasure. I share it with fellow seekers, naming it *Direct Pointing to Realization*. I do not dare claim to have attained the true, but only to rescue the true.

In the year of the Earth Goat, the fourth year of the Great Qing under Emperor Jiaqing, on the day of the Mid-Autumn Full Moon, at the Free and Easy Nest on Mount Qiyun, the simple and unadorned recluse, Realization Originator Liu Yiming, composed this preface.
