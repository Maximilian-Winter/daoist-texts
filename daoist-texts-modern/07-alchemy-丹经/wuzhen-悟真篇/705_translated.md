# Original Preface to the Awakening to the True

Alas! The human body is hard to come by, yet the passage of time slips swiftly away. One cannot fathom the span of life, how then to escape the retribution of karma? If one does not early awaken to this truth, but only complacently awaits the end, then at the moment of crossing the fork in the road, a single errant thought will plunge one instantly into the threefold hells of suffering. Thus begins the endless cycle of dust and kalpas, with no hope of liberation. When that time comes, even regret is too late.

Therefore, the Buddha taught through the study of nature and life to open the gate of expediency, instructing people to cultivate and refine, to escape birth and death. The Buddha’s school holds emptiness and stillness as its foundation; if one attains sudden awakening and perfect understanding, one directly transcends to the farther shore. But if lingering habits and stains remain unexhausted, one still wanders among the living.

The Laoist tradition values refining and nourishing as the true path; if one grasps its crucial pivot, one immediately ascends to the rank of the sage. But if one has not yet illuminated one’s original nature, one remains trapped in illusory forms.

Next, the *Zhou Yi* speaks of exhausting principle, nature, and destiny; Confucius teaches not to stubbornly cling to one’s own view—this too is Confucius reaching the profoundest depths of nature and destiny. Yet his words are often brief, never fully detailed. Why? Because he wished to arrange proper human relations, to promulgate teachings of benevolence, righteousness, ritual, and music—active virtues. Thus, the way of non-action was never openly declared. Instead, techniques of destiny were hidden in the *Yi*’s hexagrams, and the laws of nature mingled in subtle sayings. As for Zhuangzi’s probing of the boundless nature of things and Mencius’s nurturing of the vast, soaring qi, all are close to the heart of the matter.

Then came the Han and Wei scholar Bo Yang, who drew from the *Yi* the intermingling of yin and yang, composing the *Cantong Qi* to clarify the workings of the Great Elixir. In the Tang, the loyal National Master began his discourses with Lao and Zhuang’s words to reveal the origin and culmination of the supreme dao. Is this not teaching divided into three, yet the dao returning to one?

Alas, in later generations, the yellow-robed and black-capped sects each specialized in their own schools, mutually denying each other’s truth. Thus, the essential points of the three families became lost in confusion and error, unable to blend and return together.

Moreover, today’s people hold the dao gate in esteem chiefly for cultivating destiny, yet they do not know the method of cultivating destiny. The principles diverge into two extremes: some find it easy to encounter but hard to complete, others hard to encounter but easy to complete. For example, refining the five sprouting breaths, taking in the light of the seven luminaries, focusing the mind, massaging, drawing in the pure and expelling the turbid, reciting scriptures and holding incantations, spraying water and commanding talismans, clicking the teeth to gather the spirit, abstaining from wives and grain, preserving the spirit and closing the breath, moving thought between the eyebrows, supplementing the brain and returning the essence, practicing the arts of the chamber—these all belong to the easy-to-encounter but hard-to-complete.

All these methods on the path of self-cultivation mostly lead to destruction and fragmentation. Though much effort is expended, the sought-after effect is never verified. If one applies oneself diligently day and night, one may avoid illness and avert calamities. But once one ceases, previous achievements gradually fade. This is wasting years and months, making success difficult. To desire once gained to be forever gained, to return to infancy and reverse aging, to transform and soar to the heavens—how difficult is this! Truly a cause for deep sorrow.

In recent times, cultivators have been vainly attached, failing to grasp the true subtle methods, yet blaming the immortals for false words. They do not know that those who attain the dao all do so by refining the Golden Elixir. Fearing to reveal heavenly secrets, they cloak the truth in many names. Among these, the method of breath retention—if one can forget the mechanism of breath and thought—is the same as the meditation of the two vehicles. If practiced diligently, one can enter samadhi and emerge in spirit. Alas, the spirit belongs to yin, its dwelling is unstable, so one must often resort to methods of migration. Without attaining the way of returning the cinnabar and mercury, how can one reverse bones and exchange yang, ascending to heaven in broad daylight?

Refining the golden liquid and returning the elixir is the hard-to-encounter but easy-to-complete. One must thoroughly understand yin and yang, deeply penetrate creation, then be able to pursue the two qi on the yellow path, unite the three natures in the primal palace, gather the Five Phases, harmonize the Four Images, hear the dragon’s roar and tiger’s cry, husband and wife in accord, the jade cauldron boiling, the golden furnace blazing—only then can the mysterious pearl take form, and Great Unity return to truth. All this requires but a brief moment of effort, securing eternal boundless bliss.

As for guarding against danger and caution in applying withdrawal and addition, nourishing the correct and maintaining fullness, one must keep to the feminine and embrace the One. Naturally, the yang-born qi returns, the yin-killing form peels away. When the cycles are complete, the body is shed and spirit transformed, one’s name inscribed in the register of immortals, one’s rank titled “True Person.” This is the time when a great man’s work is accomplished and fame secured.

Today’s learners take lead and mercury as the two qi, point to the viscera as the Five Phases, divide heart and kidney as kan and li, use liver and lung as dragon and tiger, treat spirit and qi as father and mother, hold bodily fluids as lead and mercury, not knowing sinking and floating, nor distinguishing host and guest. How is this different from mistaking another’s wealth as one’s own, or calling a stranger one’s own child? How can they comprehend the subtlety of metal and wood’s mutual overcoming, or the mystery of yin and yang’s mutual use? All this is the sun and moon losing the way, lead and mercury in different furnaces—how can they hope to form the returning elixir? 

I, though young, have cherished the dao, traversed the scriptures of the three teachings, even the books of penal law, calculation, medicine, divination, war formations, astronomy and geography, the arts of fortune and death—none have I not carefully studied. Yet the method of the Golden Elixir, after reading all the scriptures and various family songs, poems, and treatises, all speak of sun soul and moon spirit, geng tiger and jia dragon, mercury and cinnabar, white gold and black tin, li and kan, male and female, able to form the golden liquid and return the elixir. But none explain what true lead and true mercury actually are. Nor do they speak of the fire’s timing and measure, the guidance of warming and nourishing. Added to this, later confused disciples indulge their own fancies, wildly annotating the teachings of the ancient sages, twisting and erring in myriad ways. Not only do they disorder the immortal scriptures, but they also mislead later learners.

I, having not yet met a perfect master, found the secret formulas hard to come by, and so became restless in sleep and food, my spirit wasted away. Though I sought everywhere, from mountains and seas, from the wise and the foolish, none could fully understand the true school or illuminate my heart and entrails. Later, in the year of Ji-You during the Xining reign, I accompanied Lord Lu of Longtu to Chengdu. With unwavering resolve and utmost sincerity, I was finally graced by a True Person who imparted the secret of the Golden Elixir’s medicines and the fire’s timing. His words were simple, his essentials not complicated—like pointing from the stream to the source, one phrase awakening a hundred insights, the fog clearing to reveal the bright sun, dust swept away to show the clear mirror. Comparing with the immortal scriptures, it all matched perfectly.

He said that among those who study immortality in the world, nine out of ten fail; only one or two reach the true essentials.

Having encountered the true explanation, how could I dare to keep silent? I exhausted all I had learned to compose ninety-nine poems of ninety-one lines, entitled *Awakening to the True*. Within, sixteen poems of seven-character quatrains with four rhymes express the numbers two and eight; sixty-four quatrains follow the *Zhou Yi*’s hexagrams; one five-character poem symbolizes the marvel of the Great One; and twelve *Xijiang Yue* poems correspond to the year’s rhythms. Matters of cauldrons and vessels, hierarchies of respect, weights of medicines, fire’s timing and progression, host and guest, before and after, existence and nonexistence, fortune and misfortune, regret and shame—all are fully contained therein.

After completing the collection, I felt it spoke only of nourishing life and strengthening form, yet had not fully explored the original source of true awakening to nature. Thus, I studied Buddhist texts and the *Transmission of the Lamp*, reaching the masters who awakened by striking bamboo. These I expressed in thirty-two poems of praise, song, and miscellaneous words, now appended at the volume’s end—hoping thereby to reach the way of original clarity and nature’s truth, completing it all here.

I hope fellow travelers, upon reading, will see the end and awaken to the beginning, abandoning falsehood to follow the true.

At the dawn of the Yi-Mao year of the Xining era of the Imperial Song, Zhang Boduan of Tiantai, styled Pingshu, composed this preface.
