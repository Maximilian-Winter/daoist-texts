# Postscript to the Awakening to the True Dao

I have long held that when a person is born, it is all due to deluded emotions that the body takes form. Where there is a body, there is suffering; if no body existed, whence would come affliction? To escape such suffering, nothing surpasses embodying the supreme Dao; to embody the supreme Dao, nothing surpasses illuminating the original heart. Thus, the heart is the very embodiment of the Dao, and the Dao is the function of the heart. If one can examine the heart and observe one’s nature, then the perfectly clear essence will spontaneously manifest, and the effortless function will naturally arise. Without relying on exertion, one instantly transcends to the far shore. If the mirror of the heart is bright and serene, the divine pearl vast and luminous, then how else could all forms suddenly dissolve, not a speck of dust adhere, the source of the heart roam freely, and decisively no birth arise? Yet those who understand the heart and embody the Dao do not let the body burden their nature, nor do external circumstances disturb their truth. Then how could swords and spears wound them? How could tigers and boars harm them? How could great fires or vast floods be cause for alarm? The enlightened person’s heart is as clear as the scene before it, reflecting but not receiving, responding to things as they arise, harmonious yet silent. Thus, they can overcome things without being harmed. This is what is called the unsurpassed, most true, wondrous dao.

Originally, the Dao itself has no name; the sages forcibly gave it names. The Dao itself has no words; the sages forcibly spoke words. Yet if names and words were silent, then the flow of time would have no means to recognize its essence and return to its truth. Therefore, the sages established teachings and set forth words to reveal the Dao. Thus, the Dao becomes manifest through words, and words return to the Dao and are forgotten. But how is it that this Dao is supremely subtle and profound, while the common people’s root nature is muddled and dull, clinging to their corporeal selves, loving life and fearing death? Hence, they ultimately fail to truly comprehend. Huang-Lao lamented their greed and attachment, and so employed the arts of cultivating life, following their desires, gradually guiding them. The key to cultivating life lies in the Golden Elixir; the key to the Golden Elixir lies in the numinous pool of spirit and water. Thus, the teachings of the *Dao De Jing* and the *Yin Fu Jing* flourished in the world, for people delight in life. Yet their words are hidden and their principles profound; even though students recite their texts, none truly grasp the meaning. Unless one encounters a perfected person who imparts secret formulas, even if one contemplates a hundred kinds, one will never realize the功 or accomplish the task. Is it not that learners are as numerous as ox-hairs, while the enlightened are as rare as unicorn horns?

In the year of the Rooster, at Chengdu, Bo Duan met his master, who bestowed upon him the alchemical methods. Since then, the three transmissions were not from humans, and three calamities befell him, none healed within twenty days. Recently recalling the master’s warning: “If in future one comes to untie your reins and unlock your chains, you must grant them; all others are forbidden.” Afterwards, wishing to unravel fame and records, but troubled that this Daoist was not trustworthy, he thus composed this *Awakening to the True Dao*, recounting the beginning and end of alchemical methods. Upon its release, seekers gathered in crowds, eager to understand its meaning. His heart could not bear to refuse, so he selected and taught them. Yet those he taught were none but men without great power or strength to uphold the perilous and rescue the drowning, magnanimous and uniquely enlightened, able to benevolently illuminate the Dao. At first, after two calamities, his heart still did not understand; only after the third did he reflect on past errors. Thus, he knew that the great alchemical method is supremely simple and easy. Even fools and petty men, if they obtain and practice it, will immediately transcend to the sage realm. Therefore, Heaven’s will jealously guards this secret, forbidding its light transmission to unworthy persons. But Bo Duan did not heed his master’s words, repeatedly divulging Heaven’s mysteries. Because he has a body, he repeatedly bears chastisements and calamities. Such is the profound warning of Heaven, so divine and swift. How could he not be fearful and diligent in fulfilling his duties? From now on, he will clamp his mouth and bind his tongue; even if cauldrons and pots stand before him, or swords and knives press upon his neck, he will no longer dare to speak.

Within this *Awakening to the True Dao* are sung the subtle principles of the great elixir, medicines, and the fire’s timing—nothing is left incomplete. If a seeker already has the bones of an immortal, then by reading it, their wisdom and thought will naturally become clear. They may seek out the text to explain its meaning; is there need for Bo Duan’s humble oral transmission? Such is Heaven’s gift, not something Bo Duan casually imparts. As for the praises at the end of the text, discussing the matter of seeing one’s nature, this is precisely the aforementioned unsurpassed, wondrous path of awakening. Yet the Dao of non-action first aids all beings; though its secrets are manifest, it never errs. Alas, ordinary people, due to their karma’s thickness or thinness, their root nature’s sharpness or dullness, even hearing a single sound, generate divergent views. Thus, the Dharma treasures expounded by Shakyamuni and Manjushri are none but one vehicle, yet listeners interpret according to their capacity, naturally producing the distinctions of three vehicles. Henceforth, if there be a person whose root nature is fierce and sharp, upon seeing and hearing this text, they will know that Bo Duan has heard and attained the highest, supreme vehicle’s wondrous essence from Bodhidharma and the Sixth Patriarch. They may awaken to myriad dharmas from a single word. If their habitual tendencies remain, then they revert to middling or lower views, which is not Bo Duan’s fault.

At that time, in the era of Yuanfeng, the year of the Earth Horse, in midsummer, on the day of the Earth Tiger, Zhang Bo Rui, styled Ping Shu, wrote this second postscript.
