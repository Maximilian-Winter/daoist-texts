# Direct Point of Awakening, Volume One

### Sixteen Seven-Character Regulated Poems Expressing the Number Two-Eight

The number two-eight is the number sixteen. Consider the month’s waxing moon: within the water is eight taels of gold; the waning moon: within the gold is eight taels of water. Together, two-eight make one jin. Gold and water blend evenly, their radiance neither skewed nor biased—perfectly centered and upright. The alchemical Way takes these two arcs as its symbol. Those who cultivate the great dao regard the yang within yin as true yang—that is, the waxing moon; the yin within yang as true yin—that is, the waning moon. Yang within yin, yin and yang harmonize; yin within yang, yin and yang also harmonize. True yin and true yang join as one, united as two-eight making one jin, the emblem of the Golden Elixir. The sixteen poems of this series express the two-eight number, thus embodying this truth.

### Poem One

Do not seek the great dao from a lost path;  
Though burdened by talent, is this the way of a man?  
A hundred years’ light flashes like a stone’s spark,  
A lifetime’s fate drifts like bubbles on water.  
Greedy only for profit and honor,  
Unaware your form and visage wither and fade.  
Tell me, can heaps of gold like mountains  
Be bought by impermanence, or not?

The dusty world is all a realm of sound and color,  
A land of fame and profit, taking bitterness as joy, falsehood as truth,  
Draining essence, exhausting breath, chiseling away life, ending only in death.  
Those who awaken and transcend this are the perfected ones;  
Those ignorant and trapped within are the lost.  
Thus, ancient sages who attained the dao and immortality,  
From youth were filial and friendly, preserving human relations;  
By forty, they practiced the Way of an unmoved heart, preserving life itself.  
A hundred years stolen in a blink; a lifetime’s glory and shame vanish in a moment.  
If one does not know to return to origin and restore the primordial,  
When the great limit arrives, even with mountains of gold,  
One leaves empty-handed. The Immortal Elder said:  
“Tell me, can heaps of gold like Mount Tai  
Be bought by impermanence, or not?”  
Truly a golden bell and a thunderous drum, awakening all.

### Poem Two

Though life may span a hundred years,  
Early death, poverty, or fortune none can foresee.  
Yesterday still riding horses on the street,  
Today already a corpse in a coffin.  
Wife and wealth left behind are not yours,  
Sin and karma will come, who can deceive?  
Great medicine is not sought by contention,  
To know it but not refine it is folly.

The world vies for fame and profit, day and night without rest,  
Claiming lifespan infinite, able to enjoy peace forever.  
How can one know Heaven’s lifespan, fortune and loss?  
These are beyond human foresight.  
Do not say the world is rare with centenarians;  
Even those reaching a hundred cannot escape burial in wild fields.  
Often people vanish suddenly,  
Even while walking or laughing,  
Sudden death is countless.  
Alas! Open eyes and wealth and wife belong to me,  
Closed eyes and all is empty, nothing taken,  
Only a load of sins carried away.  
Better to see through the world early,  
Seek a wise master quickly, to find the great medicine.  
If fate allows meeting the great medicine,  
It is great blessing and root foundation.  
Diligently refine without delay,  
Then death is escaped and life entered, impermanence ended.  
If met but unwilling to cultivate,  
It is self-destruction and folly,  
Equal to those who do not see through the world,  
Ultimately doomed to perish—what use is mere knowing?

### Poem Three

To learn immortality, one must learn heavenly immortals,  
Only the Golden Elixir is truly supreme.  
When two substances meet, nature and feeling unite,  
All Five Phases complete, dragons and tigers entwined.  
Originally earth and fire were matchmakers,  
Thus husband and wife settle in joyful union.  
Awaiting功成 to court the northern palace,  
Riding phoenix amid nine clouds’ radiant light.

The previous two poems teach seeing through the world and urgently seeking the great medicine to escape life and death. The way to escape life and death is the way of immortality. But immortals come in several grades:  
Those who transcend nature but leave yin spirits are ghost immortals;  
Those who transcend fate but keep form in the world are earthly immortals;  
Those who transcend both nature and fate, with body beyond body, form and spirit both wondrous, united with the dao as true, are heavenly immortals.  
Ghost immortals, though yin spirits, come and go freely, yet their dwelling is unstable, still facing the risk of losing body and gaining body.  
Earthly immortals can keep form in the world, but their dharma body cannot be freed, still burdened by illusory form and material attachments.  
Both fall into death or life, neither fully escaping birth and death.  
Only heavenly immortals shed illusory form and become dharma body, transcending creation, neither born nor dying, able to escape birth and death, living as long as Heaven, eternal and uncorrupted.  
Those who wish to escape birth and death must learn heavenly immortals.  
To begin learning heavenly immortals, only the Golden Elixir Way suffices.

Gold is the hard, unbreakable substance;  
Elixir is the mixed, unhindered form.  
Hard and unbreakable, mixed and unhindered, perfectly one qi,  
Like Heaven’s void circle, unfathomable, embracing all, impervious to harm.  
Thus, after the dao is formed, it is called heavenly immortal.  
Because it is eternal and unbreakable, also called golden immortal.  
Because it is hidden and manifest, unfathomable, also called spirit immortal.  
In truth, golden immortal and spirit immortal are all heavenly immortal.  
To cultivate heavenly immortal, abandoning the Golden Elixir Way, there is no other method.  
This Golden Elixir is the spiritual root innate in humans,  
Perfect and without flaw, original yang qi condensed,  
Containing yin and yang, hiding Five Phases, with qi but no form,  
Not like postnatal forms with shape and image, turbid and impure.  
If refined by the yin talisman and yang fire, tempered to maturity,  
Forever unbreakable, called the Seven Returns Nine Reversions Golden Liquid Great Returning Elixir.  
Golden Elixir is another name for the mixed original nature,  
Not something beyond original nature, nor another Golden Elixir.  
This elixir everyone possesses, each perfectly formed,  
Neither increasing in sages, nor decreasing in ordinary people,  
The seed of immortals and Buddhas, the root of sages.  
But without fire refining, yang extreme must yield to yin,  
Perfect roundness must lose, falling into postnatal.  
Knowledge opens but private desires mix,  
Qi and essence arise and Heaven’s goodness dims,  
Good knowing and good ability all turn bad, no longer pure white body.  
Thus ancient sages established the Golden Elixir return path,  
So everyone returns home to recognize ancestors,  
Recovering what was originally theirs.

What is called return?  
Return means what was lost is regained;  
Restore means what was gone is found again.  
The spiritual root’s dimness is due to yin-yang disharmony, Five Phases harming each other.  
If yin and yang unite, Five Phases cluster,  
All become the original, perfect thing.  
Two substances: one hard, one soft; one strong, one gentle; one true knowing, one spiritual knowing; one true feeling, one spiritual nature.  
True knowing dwells in the dao heart, strong and vigorous, manifesting as true feeling;  
Spiritual knowing hides in the human heart, gentle and compliant, containing spiritual nature.  
If true knowing and spiritual knowing separate,  
Strength is misplaced, gentleness misapplied, hard and soft lose measure,  
True feeling and spiritual nature become false feeling and false nature.  
If true knowing and spiritual knowing unite,  
Strength is where it should be, gentleness where it should be,  
Hard and soft follow the time.  
False feeling and false nature transform into true feeling and true nature.  
The Immortal Elder said:  
“When two substances meet, feeling and nature unite,  
Is this not perfectly clear?”

The Five Phases are Metal, Wood, Water, Fire, Earth qi.  
In the primordial, they are original nature, original feeling, original essence, original spirit, original qi—the Five Origins.  
In the postnatal, they become wandering souls, ghosts, yin essence, consciousness, and deluded thought—the Five Substances.  
The Five Origins hold benevolence, righteousness, propriety, wisdom, and faith—the Five Virtues;  
The Five Substances hold joy, anger, sorrow, pleasure, and desire—the Five Afflictions.  
When Five Phases are complete, primordial and postnatal mixed and clustered,  
The Five Origins govern the Five Substances.  
Dragon is yang, master of life force, belonging to eastern Wood, human nature;  
Tiger is yin, master of killing force, belonging to western Metal, human feeling.  
If Five Phases disharmonize, each acts on its own,  
Five Origins become Five Substances, Five Virtues turn to Five Thieves,  
Dragon east, tiger west, nature confused and feeling lost,  
Qi and nature become deluded feeling, killing qi cuts life qi.  
If Five Phases are complete, all return to nature,  
Five Substances become Five Origins, Five Thieves turn to Five Virtues,  
Dragon coils, tiger crouches, nature settled, feeling forgotten,  
True feeling and true nature arise, killing qi turns to life qi.

The Way of refining the elixir is but harmonizing hard and soft,  
Making strength and gentleness correspond, nature and feeling unite.  
Nature and feeling unite, yin and yang meet, Five Phases complete,  
Still the perfect heavenly principle, utmost goodness without evil,  
Good knowing and good ability, original thing restored, and Golden Elixir returned.  
But after primordial original is scattered, nature east, feeling west,  
Hard and soft mismatched, without harmonizing substance,  
They cannot communicate, remain isolated, never truly know each other.

The harmonizing substance is the two Earths, Wu and Ji.  
Wu Earth is active, yang; Ji Earth is still, yin.  
Still and unmoving is Ji Earth; responsive and communicative is Wu Earth.  
Wu and Ji Earth are true faith among the Five Virtues.  
True faith is central and nature settled;  
True settledness used outwardly makes feeling harmonious.  
Nature settled and feeling harmonious, nature and feeling return to root,  
Like husband and wife in joyful union, benevolence, righteousness, propriety, wisdom, all return to one faith,  
Nature, feeling, and spirit unite as one qi.  
Three families meet, Five Qi face origin, returning origin and root,  
Golden Elixir condenses, also called sacred embryo.  
Then further upward功夫, from the conditioned into the unconditioned.  
Ten months of nurturing, solid and sealed,  
Extracting excess strength of feeling, adding lacking gentleness of nature.  
Using natural true fire, morning gathering, evening concealing,  
Refining away postnatal yin qi.  
From no form arises form, from subtle is revealed, qi full and spirit complete,  
With a thunderclap, the golden cicada sheds its shell,  
Body outside body,功成名遂,  
Court the northern palace, riding phoenix,  
Ascending by daylight, a pure yang immortal, undying heavenly immortal—how joyous!

Alas! The original true nature is called Golden Elixir,  
The four great elements the furnace forging the sphere.  
Those who awaken this stand at the sage’s rank;  
Those who lose it sink into ten thousand kalpas.  
Those with aspiration, how can they not strive?

### Poem Four

This method, true within true, more wondrous still,  
All because I alone differ from others.  
Knowing my reversal comes from separation of Kan,  
Who knows who is host or guest in rise and fall?  
The golden cauldron wishes to hold cinnabar and mercury,  
The jade pool first lets silver in the water.  
Divine功夫 moves fire not just day and night,  
Revealing a sun in the deep pool.

This poem says that to refine the Golden Elixir, nature and feeling must unite, Five Phases be complete, only then success.  
But the medicine is easy to know; the fire’s timing is hardest.  
Fire timing is the method’s process.  
Lüzu said:  
“The highest virtue completes its form by dao, pure yang unbroken;  
Lower virtue extends life by technique, relying on Kan and Li already formed.”  
Those of lower virtue must use method to capture it.  
Method is technique.  
Without method or technique, one cannot return to origin and void,  
Life’s foundation unstable, great dao hard to form.  
Thus the Immortal Elder said:  
“This method true within true, more wondrous still,  
All because I alone differ from others.”  
Method called true and wondrous is utmost true and wondrous method.  
When method is true, it can steal yin and yang, seize creation, reverse birth and death, counter qi mechanisms.  
When method is wondrous, gods and ghosts cannot fathom, divination tools cannot predict,  
Primordial and Heaven not violated, postnatal obeys Heaven’s timing,  
This is the Way of sages and worthies, not all side doors and small methods can glimpse its edge.  
What is wondrous about refining true method?  
Wondrous is reversal.  
Reversal means overturning yin and yang, counteracting creation.

Li and Kan: Li is fire, outer male and inner female.  
Inner female is true yin, human spiritual knowing hidden in the heart.  
Human heart moves and spiritual knowing flies, like fire’s upper flame.  
Kan is water, outer dark and inner bright.  
Inner bright is true yang, human true knowing, in dao heart.  
Dao heart dim, true knowing hidden, like water’s undercurrent.  
Using reversal, one births dao heart, settles human heart.  
Dao heart born, true knowing strong and vigorous, essence one water rises;  
Human heart settled, spiritual knowing gentle and compliant, fiery heat descends.  
Water above, fire below, water and fire mutually assist.  
Spiritual knowing is nature, nature belongs to wood, wood is soft and easily floats.  
True knowing is feeling, feeling belongs to metal; metal feeling is hard and easily sinks.  
Spiritual knowing floats and acts as master, true within false;  
True knowing sinks and hides as guest, false overwhelms true—this is normal flow.  
Settling host and guest means true knowing’s feeling is host,  
Making what sinks rise, spiritual knowing’s nature is guest, making what floats sink.  
Host and guest alternate, metal and wood both present.  
Water and fire mingle, metal and wood unite,  
Dao heart strong, human heart compliant,  
True knowing and spiritual knowing join, nature and feeling unite,  
How can Golden Elixir not form?  
But such true and wondrous method is neither form nor emptiness,  
It must be done where men do not know but oneself alone knows,  
Thus called self-knowledge, also who knows?  
Unknown to others but self-known, this steals the mechanism.  
No one in the world can see or know it.  
This Way has sequence and speed;  
If one does not know the sequence and speed’s wondrous use,  
Even if knowing the medicine, reversal is hard to apply, host and guest unstable.  
Hence next line:  
“The golden cauldron wishes to hold cinnabar and mercury,  
The jade pool first lets silver in the water.”

Gold is hard and firm; jade is soft and gentle;  
Cauldron is refining vessel; pool is fire nurturing vessel.  
Golden cauldron and jade pool symbolize the Way of true cultivation, hard and soft as body.  
Human heart belongs to Li, Li is Gan’s body, thus golden cauldron.  
Containing earth’s two fires as spiritual knowing,  
Is Kun’s gentle and compliant center, original good ability.  
Human heart originally empty and hollow, clear and bright,  
But mingling with postnatal consciousness, borrowing spirit to create delusion,  
Seeing images and dust, waves stirred by wind, never resting.  
Like cinnabar mercury, meeting fire flies away, hardest to keep.  
“Sun flowing pearl” in the Cantong qi always wants to leave man.  
Dao heart belongs to Kan, Kan is Kun’s body, thus jade pool.  
Within hides Heaven One’s water as true knowing,  
Kan palace’s strong and upright, original good knowing.  
Fallen into postnatal, guest qi acting, righteous qi retreats,  
Yang trapped in yin, true is false hidden, drowning in desire sea, good knowing dim,  
Like silver in water, rare and barely present.  
Silver is metal type; silver in water is metal hidden in water.  
This metal in primordial is original nature’s good knowing,  
In postnatal is dao heart’s true knowing.  
Because true knowing is strongest and most vigorous, called true lead;  
Because true knowing makes immortality and dao, also called true seed.  
Ancient sages all took this great medicine to understand nature and fate.

Human heart’s spiritual knowing, though easily moved,  
If controlled by dao heart’s true knowing, spirit returns to truth, will not flee.  
“Finally gaining golden splendor, turning and mutually depending.”  
Huanghe’s ode says:  
“Within Li seven kinds of cinnabar, without true seed hard to keep.”  
Seven cinnabars are tears, saliva, essence, fluids, qi, blood, liquids.  
Unstable seven cinnabars all due to human heart’s spirit unstable.  
But human heart’s spirit unstable because dao heart lost, thus unstable.  
To keep human heart’s spiritual knowing, must first settle dao heart’s true knowing.  
Under true knowing and true seed, inner master rules, not confused by mixed qi,  
Human heart’s spiritual knowing naturally condenses and does not scatter.  
Using dao heart to control human heart, human heart obeys dao heart,  
True knowing governs spiritual knowing, spiritual knowing nourishes true knowing.  
Hard and soft correspond, strong and gentle as one,  
Nature and feeling harmonize, in half a moment,  
Condense into a bright, round pearl, spirit light shining,  
All yin and evil qi cannot harm,  
Thus said divine功夫 moves fire not just day and night,  
Revealing a sun in the deep pool.

Divine功夫 is the silent operation of spirit and clarity,  
Careful solitude功夫.  
Fire is true knowing and spiritual knowing, hard and soft united harmonious qi.  
Moving fire means caution where unseen, fear where unheard.  
Moving true knowing and spiritual knowing, hard and soft united,  
Not allowing a speck of dross to remain in the heart.  
This divine功夫 fire is like a shadow cast by a pole, voice carried by wind.  
If willing to act, no need for a whole day,  
Can return yang from yin, like sun rising from deep pool, yin qi retreats.  
The poem’s key words are “wishes to hold” and “first lets.”  
Within is preemptive action, host not reaching guest’s meaning.  
Knowing this, reverses yin and yang, harmonizes four images,  
Easy as flipping the palm, this is the alchemical image.  
Outer elixir is also called returning elixir,  
Because what was lost returns, what was gone is regained,  
From outside returning inside, thus called outer elixir, also called returning elixir.  
Once returned, it is inner elixir, this is the difference between inner and outer.

### Poem Five

Tiger leaps, dragon soars, wind and waves rough,  
Central upright place births the mysterious pearl.  
Fruit born on branch will ripen in time,  
Seed in womb, how can it differ?  
South and north sects reverse hexagrams,  
Morning and evening fire timing join at heavenly pivot.  
Know this: great hermits dwell in the marketplace,  
Why must one guard quiet alone in deep mountains?

This poem speaks of returning elixir.  
It describes the great elixir Way.  
This moment of功夫 unites with Heaven and Earth’s virtue,  
With sun and moon’s brightness, with four seasons’ order,  
With ghosts and gods’ auspices.  
Hard to meet, easy to err, a little carelessness,  
Primordial true one qi gained and lost again.  
Primordial true one qi is returning elixir.  
Because returning elixir is hard-soft two qi joined.  
Thus true one qi is not other than returning elixir.  
When returning elixir is grasped, dao heart strong, human heart gentle,  
True knowing and spiritual knowing mixed as one,  
Round and bright, shining clear,  
Still the beginning of life, good knowing and good ability,  
Silent and unmoving, responsive and communicating,  
Original face of things.  
This thing, because nature is strong, called true lead;  
Because qi is vigorous, called heroic tiger.  
True lead heroic tiger is a vast righteous qi, utmost good without evil,  
Holding constant good knowing and good ability’s heavenly truth.  
Having regained this heavenly truth,  
Must restore it to before parents’ birth, where Five Phases do not reach,  
Only then can one form an eternal unbreakable heavenly truth.  
Thus when heavenly truth returns, warm and nurture it,  
Seal tightly and store firmly,  
Extreme emptiness, deep stillness, yang qi abundant,  
Stillness extreme then movement, spiritual seed sprouts,  
Lüzu’s so-called eternal middle dawn, warm lead cauldron, light shining through curtains.  
At this time, yang light emerges from cave, like heroic tiger,  
Momentum unstoppable, urgently use true nature’s point of void spiritual fire to greet it.  
Void spiritual fire called female dragon.  
Tiger leaps and dragon soars is yin-yang clash image.  
Wind and waves rough is tiger leaving cave and wind rising, dragon leaving pool and waves rising, yin and yang contending.  
Dragon and tiger meet, nature and feeling unite, merge as one, enter the center.  
Primordial qi comes from void, condenses as a millet seed, sacred embryo takes form.  
Sacred embryo is valley spirit; valley spirit is the mysterious female joining as one.  
Yang mystery is tiger feeling, yin female is dragon nature.  
Nature and feeling unite and sacred embryo forms, primal female stands and valley spirit lives.  
At this stage, all tasks done, no need for further action, let nature be.  
If fruit on branch, it will ripen; seed in womb, it will be born.  
Though sacred embryo forms, still must guard against dangers,  
South and north sects reversing hexagrams means south is fire, north is water,  
Sacred embryo condenses, harmonious qi steams, water and fire return to source, mutually cooking,  
Let nature take its course, do not forget nor assist功夫.  
Morning and evening fire timing join at heavenly pivot,  
Morning is day’s start, yang qi active; evening is night’s start, yin qi active.  
Heavenly pivot is yin-yang qi mechanism,  
Use yang at yang time, use yin at yin time,  
Fire timing advances and retreats, secretly matching morning and evening,  
Day’s work and night’s vigilance.  
Do not forget nor assist, day’s work and night’s vigilance, nurture ten months,  
Replace postnatal hexagrams, shed primordial dharma body,  
“My fate is mine, not Heaven’s.”  
This Way is cultivated among humans, done in the marketplace,  
Great mechanism and great use, true功夫 realized,  
Not empty non-action or quiet extinction.  
Thus said: “Know this: great hermits dwell in the marketplace,  
Why must one guard quiet alone in deep mountains?”

### Poem Six

Everyone has the elixir of long life,  
Only lost ones foolishly cast it away.  
When sweet dew descends, Heaven and Earth unite,  
Where yellow sprouts grow, Kan and Li meet.  
The well frog may say no dragon’s cave,  
The fence bird may dispute the phoenix’s nest.  
When elixir ripens naturally, gold fills the house,  
Why seek herbs or learn to burn grass?

The previous three poems detailed returning elixir and great elixir, medicine and fire timing, fully and clearly.  
But fearing students mistake Golden Elixir as burnt mundane things, this poem follows to warn.

Golden Elixir is the original good knowing and good ability nature in humans.  
This nature everyone has, each perfectly formed,  
Neither increasing in sages nor decreasing in ordinary,  
No need to seek elsewhere, it is already present.  
If willing, one ascends the holy city,  
Nature settled, fate condensed, eternal and unbreakable,  
This good knowing and good ability nature is the great medicine of long life.  
All lost ones fail to investigate sages’ true principle,  
Do not trace nature and fate’s root,  
Abandon the near for the far, reject truth for falsehood,  
A wasted life, old without achievement, foolishly casting away—how lamentable and sad!

Life’s original good knowing is strong virtue,  
Received from Heaven, that is Heaven itself;  
Life’s original good ability is compliant virtue,  
Received from Earth, that is Earth itself;  
Life’s original clear and bright spirit is spiritual nature,  
Transformed from Earth’s qi, that is fire;  
Life’s original pure and unmixed essence is true feeling,  
Transformed from Heaven One’s qi, that is water.  
If one can be strong and compliant as one,  
Within the body Heaven and Earth unite,  
Like sweet dew sprinkling the heart, all vexations vanish.  
If one’s spirit is not wasted,  
Within the body Kan and Li meet,  
Like yellow sprouts growing, original qi restored.  
Sweet dew descending is heart clarity,  
Yellow sprouts growing is mind stillness.  
Heart clear and mind still, good knowing and good ability,  
One spiritual true nature, suspended in void,  
Silent and unmoving, responsive and communicating,  
Always responding, always still,  
Creation hard to move, all things hard to bend,  
“My fate is mine, not Heaven’s.”  
The Way of long life is here.  
How can the well frog know the dragon’s cave?  
How can the fence bird know the phoenix’s nest?  
Hearing talk of medicine and fire timing,  
Mistaking it for grass-burning methods, strange and strange,  
Doing all manner of things.  
Not knowing refining great elixir,  
When ripe, gold and jade fill the hall,  
Preserving life and corner, wealth incomparable.  
Why cling to all worldly dross?

### Poem Seven

To know where the medicine springs forth,  
Look southwest to recognize the homeland.  
Lead meets Gui, must quickly gather,  
Gold meets full moon, not fit to taste.  
Send back to earth cauldron, seal firm and tight,  
Next enter flowing pearl, pair and match.  
Medicine weighs one jin, must be two-eight,  
Adjust fire timing, entrust yin and yang.

This poem says everyone has the medicine of long life,  
But does not say where or when it is born,  
So this poem reveals the source of medicine;  
Wise practitioners apply功夫 anytime, carefully with fire timing.

Southwest is Kun direction, where moon wanes to revive,  
Yin extreme gives birth to yang place,  
In humans, stillness extreme then movement begins,  
This stillness extreme movement is when great medicine appears.  
But movement is not external guest qi or desire movement,  
Nor internal mind thought movement,  
But Heaven heart good knowing, dao heart true knowing movement.  
Heaven heart good knowing and dao heart true knowing,  
Because they transcend mortal and saint, revive the dead,  
Are symbolized as medicine;  
Because at stillest moment all conditions cease,  
Heaven heart good knowing and dao heart true knowing  
Show a glimmer of light, symbolizing medicine’s birthplace;  
Because Heaven heart good knowing and dao heart true knowing  
Are white in black, come from void, movement born from stillness,  
Like river with source, symbolizing medicine’s spring.  
This medicine in primordial is Heaven heart’s good knowing,  
In postnatal is dao heart’s true knowing.  
Dao heart is shadow of Heaven heart;  
True knowing is shadow of good knowing.  
Because Heaven heart falls into postnatal, cannot always remain,  
Sometimes appears, called dao heart;  
Because good knowing sinks in desire sea, light dims, sometimes not dark,  
Called true knowing.  
After return, dao heart is still Heaven heart, true knowing still good knowing,  
Sometimes appears, sometimes not dark,  
That is dao heart true knowing’s homeland.  
There is sometimes appearing, sometimes not dark,  
One point of primordial true one life remains.  
Using this one life, reverse cultivate,  
How hard to return from dao heart true knowing to Heaven heart good knowing?

But return is not hard, must know still extreme then move, river source place.  
Laozi said:  
“Achieve utmost emptiness, keep deep stillness,  
All things arise together, I watch their return.”  
Yi says:  
“Return, return the Way, seven days come again.”  
All point to dao heart true knowing’s river source.

Knowing medicine’s spring, must know when to begin.  
Refining subtle功夫 is taking dao heart one taste as elixir mother,  
Because dao heart is strong and vigorous, has true knowing feeling,  
Symbolized as true lead, lead containing silver, black outside white inside.  
Dao heart contains true knowing, bright outside,  
Thus immortals compare dao heart true knowing to true lead.  
Not willing to point out directly, Zheng Zhizhong feared thieves.  
This dao heart true knowing is buried by desire, deeply trapped, cannot emerge.  
Knowing spring, can gradually gather and return.  
Return method still seeks in desire.  
True knowing is born of Heaven One, pure and clear yang water, Ren water.  
Desire born of Earth Six, impure and turbid yin water, Gui water.  
Ren water hidden in Gui water, not born of Gui water, but not visible, true lead unseen.  
Lead meets Gui born means yin and yang qi meet, Gui just born but not acting.  
Ren water not scattered, true knowing not dim, must quickly gather into suspended cauldron,  
Then desire cannot act and self-eliminates.  
Zhang Sanfeng said must gather it like flowers outside the wall.  
Gold meets full moon means having true knowing returned,  
Using this true knowing’s true feeling, increasing and increasing,  
Advancing to strong and upright, pure essence.  
Like refining white gold from lead, color bright and clear.  
At this stage, good knowing and good ability, bright and clear,  
Right and wrong respond to things,  
Leaping and hiding, all follow heart,  
Walking freely, everything is dao,  
Like a bright moon in the sky, shining on three thousand great worlds,  
Penetrating dark and mysterious,  
No need for added功夫, abandoning conditioned to enter unconditioned.  
If not knowing fire timing, holding fullness not ended,  
Perfect roundness must lose, brightness turns dark,  
Like full moon waning, yang producing yin.  
True knowing harmed, true dim and false come,  
All postnatal dross, how can one taste?

Therefore when true knowing returns to round,  
Quickly send to central earth cauldron, seal tight,  
Not letting a bit leak,  
Again with original nature’s one point void spiritual flowing pearl paired,  
Using yin to aid yang, void nourishing substance,  
Guarding against danger and risk.  
Must reach hard and soft as one, yin and yang matched.  
Two-eight number complete, not more or less,  
Advancing to ore-exhausted pure gold, no bit of qi or essence left.  
But two-eight number complete depends entirely on adjusting fire timing,  
Knowing old and young, knowing stop and enough, discerning auspicious and inauspicious,  
Recognizing urgency and slowness.  
When time to advance yang, advance yang; when time to move yin, move yin.  
Neither big nor small harms, both countries complete.  
Naturally primordial true one qi comes from void, condenses and does not scatter,  
Sacred embryo takes form.  
Adjusting fire timing is precisely harmonizing hard and soft without pause.  
Medicine weighs one jin, hard and soft both balanced,  
Two-eight matched, yin within yang, yang within yin, yin and yang mixed,  
Hard and soft all transformed, silent and unmoving, responsive and communicating;  
Responsive and communicating, silent and unmoving, forever unbreakable.  
Alas! Moon to full preserved in formula, time to secret lies in heart transmission.  
Medicine itself hard to know, fire timing also not easy to understand,  
Students how can they not urgently seek a true master?  
This poem’s medicine, fire timing, returning elixir, great elixir功夫,  
All included, the most important among sixteen poems.  
Readers must carefully investigate, not lightly pass a word.  
If one finds the phoenix tree, can verify true master,  
From one word know myriad methods.

### Poem Eight

Stop refining three yellows and four spirits,  
Seeking many herbs is not true.  
Yin and yang matched, then they resonate,  
Two-eight matched, naturally intimate.  
At pond bottom red sun, yin monsters vanish,  
On mountain peak white moon, medicine sprouts fresh.  
People must know true lead and mercury,  
Not mundane sand and quicksilver.

This poem says true lead and true mercury, two medicines combined,  
Only then can Golden Elixir be achieved.  
Yet some suspect Golden Elixir is worldly form, burnt to make,  
Thus this poem follows:  
“Stop refining three yellows and four spirits,  
Seeking many herbs is not true.”  
Three yellows are realgar, orpiment, and arsenic;  
Four spirits are cinnabar, mercury, lead, and saltpeter.  
Three yellows, four spirits, many herbs, unlike us,  
How can they receive life? How can they understand nature?  
Cannot receive life or understand nature, all empty, not true dao.  
“Like seeks like to easily apply功夫, unlike seed hard to work.”  
Man born of Heaven and Earth’s yin and yang qi,  
Body contains yin and yang qi, yin and yang virtue.  
Yang is hard; yin is soft.  
Yang’s virtue governs fate; yin’s virtue governs nature.  
Yang hard and yin soft are source of nature and fate.  
Like seeks like: yang takes yin as like, yin takes yang as like.  
Yin and yang matched, hard and soft respond,  
Like husband and wife long apart suddenly meeting, none not moved.  
Two-eight means yin within yang is true yang, strong and upright;  
Yang within yin is true yin, gentle and upright.  
Hard and soft both centered, yin and yang matched, neither偏偏 nor偏倚,  
Naturally united and intimate, perfectly one qi, condensed and unscattered.

Yin and yang matched, two-eight balanced,  
Return postnatal to primordial, dao heart strong, human heart gentle,  
True knowing and spiritual knowing united,  
Original one point good knowing and good ability root exposed from no-thought.  
Like red sun rising at pond bottom, yin monsters vanish;  
Like white moon hanging high on mountain peak, medicine sprouts fresh.  
Because righteous qi born, evil qi retreats,  
True returns and false disappears.  
Red sun at pond bottom, white moon on mountain peak,  
Both symbolize true yang appearing, Heaven heart restored.  
Heaven heart restored, knowledge and ability good,  
This is Golden Elixir.  
This Golden Elixir is our original true yin and true yang,  
Hard and soft combined and netted,  
The true treasure of nature and fate,  
How can it be mundane sand and mercury refined?

### Poem Nine

Yang inside yin essence is not strong,  
Cultivating only one thing turns weak and frail.  
Laboring body and pressing shadow are not dao,  
Breathing qi and eating mist all madness.  
The world vainly seeks to subdue lead and mercury,  
When will one see dragon and tiger submit?  
Advise you to seize the place of life,  
Return to origin and restore primordial, the king of medicines.

This poem says Golden Elixir medicine is not external three yellows and four spirits, nor mundane herbs.  
Thus cultivators must cultivate within one’s own body.  
Little do they know after primordial true yang falls,  
What remains in the body is yin essence within yang.  
Yin essence is not just mingling essence.  
All tears, saliva, fluids, blood, qi are yin essence.  
Its nature is not strong; body present then present, body gone then gone,  
Following illusory body’s existence.  
If cultivating this yin essence within yang,  
Seeking to preserve life and corner, only grows weak and frail,  
End result hard to achieve.  
World’s laboring body and pressing shadow, breathing qi and eating mist,  
Among thousands of doors and ten thousand households,  
Either refining yin essence or supplementing yin essence,  
Separated from dao, farther and farther.  
How can they subdue true lead and true mercury,  
Drive true dragon and true tiger to unite as family?  
Golden Elixir Way is the way of life’s birth;  
Life’s birth way is yin and yang two into one way,  
Yin and yang united, life force remains.  
Life’s birth way borrows mundane father and mother to birth illusory body;  
Life of immortals borrows spiritual father and holy mother to form true body.  
Spiritual father is strong true knowing; holy mother is gentle spiritual knowing.  
Birth of man and immortal both yin and yang,  
Only difference is saint and mundane, reverse and forward.  
If one thoroughly investigates life’s birth principle,  
Great awakening and full understanding,  
Knowing how parents meet, how conceive, how protect fetus,  
How fetus is complete, how born, how suckled, how walk, how grow,  
Then cultivation from start to end is clear and bright,  
Can proceed straight forward, return to origin and primordial,  
Revive the dead, preserve life and corner,  
Becoming great medicine king.  
Cultivating true great dao is just life’s birth principle, no other method.  
All other side doors, solitary yin or solitary yang,  
Clinging to emptiness and form, cultivating one thing alone,  
How can they know this?

### Poem Ten

Seek true lead with care,  
Do not easily waste time.  
Capture earth soul and subdue cinnabar,  
Heaven soul controls water and gold.  
Can say dao is high and dragon and tiger subdued,  
Can say virtue is heavy and ghosts and gods respect.  
Knowing eternal life equals Heaven and Earth,  
No more vexations arise in heart.

This poem teaches to seize life’s birth place,  
Return to origin and restore primordial.  
But to return to origin, must know true lead medicine.  
Knowing true lead means knowing all things done, others easy.  
True lead is no other than dao heart’s true knowing.  
True knowing also called true seed.  
Without knowing true seed, cultivation has no root,  
All功夫 vain effort, thus said:  
“Seek true lead with care.”  
Careful seeking means格物致知, thorough功夫 within.  
Students wishing to cultivate great dao,  
Must first exhaust real principle,  
Real principle clear, then begin practice,  
Effect immediate.  
If not thorough, vainly hope for heavenly treasure,  
Suspended emptiness, wasting time.

Earth soul and water gold, yin within yang, all true knowing’s image;  
Heaven soul and cinnabar mercury, yang within yin, all spiritual knowing’s image.  
But capturing earth soul to subdue cinnabar means using true knowing to control spiritual knowing.  
Heaven soul controlling water gold means using spiritual knowing to nurture true knowing.  
True knowing is hard, yang, husband;  
Spiritual knowing is soft, yin, wife.  
Husband controls wife, wife obeys husband,  
Wife obeys husband, husband loves wife,  
Husband and wife harmonize, life force always present.  
“Sun flowing pearl always wants to leave man;  
Finally gaining golden splendor, turning and mutually depending.”  
True knowing and spiritual knowing unite, hard and soft return center,  
Transform to good knowing and good ability, silent and unmoving, responsive and communicating, sacred embryo takes form.  
At this stage, dao high and dragon and tiger subdued,  
Virtue heavy and ghosts and gods respect,  
Then eternal life equals Heaven and Earth,  
What vexations can rise in heart?

### Poem Eleven

Yellow sprouts and white snow easy to find,  
The enlightened must rely on deep virtue.  
Four images and Five Phases all depend on earth,  
Three origins and Eight Trigrams not apart from Ren.  
Refining spirit substance hard for man to know,  
Exhausting yin demons and ghosts cannot invade.  
Want to leave secret in human world,  
Not met a single true listener.

This poem says dao high and virtue heavy,  
Dragon and tiger, ghosts and gods all subdued,  
Thus dao cannot lack virtue, virtue cannot lack dao.  
Great dao is not complex, great medicine not far,  
White clouds near at hand, yellow sprouts grow at home.  
If willing, easily obtained, thus said not hard to find.  
But this dao is transcendence, entering saint,  
Reviving the dead, rare in the world,  
Though not hard to find, only great virtue and great conduct men can know,  
Thus again said enlightened must rely on deep virtue.  
Indeed virtue men are easy to find.

Four images are Metal, Wood, Water, Fire qi, plus Earth making Five Phases.  
Three origins are Heaven origin, Earth origin, Human origin.  
Also upper origin, middle origin, lower origin, also three origins.  
Eight trigrams are four images and Five Phases yin and yang.  
Gan is yang metal, Dui yin metal;  
Kan yang water, Gen yin water;  
Zhen yang wood, Xun yin wood;  
Li yang fire, Kun yin fire.  
Though eight trigrams match four images yin and yang, Kun and Gen also have Wu and Ji two earths.  
Kun is yin earth, Gen is yang earth, Five Phase qi also within.  
Five Phases in humans are nature, feeling, essence, spirit, qi Five Origins,  
Manifest as benevolence, righteousness, propriety, wisdom, faith Five Virtues.  
Three origins in humans are original essence, original qi, original spirit.  
Eight seals in humans are Five Origins, Five Virtues, hard-soft nature.  
In sum four images, three origins, eight trigrams all transform from Five Phases,  
No four images, three origins, eight trigrams beyond Five Phases.

Four images and Five Phases metal borrow earth,  
Means benevolence, righteousness, propriety, wisdom all borrow faith to complete.  
Three origins and eight trigrams not apart from Ren,  
Means nature, feeling, spirit, qi not apart from essence one.  
Yellow sprouts are earth’s life force, faith at center.  
White snow is water’s light and clear, essence to one.  
Benevolence, righteousness, propriety, wisdom return to faith,  
Holding to center, yellow sprouts grow;  
Nature, feeling, spirit, qi return to one,  
Essence one.  
White thunder flies in sky, essence one holding center,  
Cultivate and refine, longer and stronger,  
Dao heart always vigorous, human heart always still,  
True knowing and spiritual knowing united as one,  
One bright round pearl suspended in void.  
Always responding, always still, form and emptiness unbound,  
Manifest and conceal follow time, primordial and Heaven not violated,  
Heaven almost not violated, how much more humans?  
How much more ghosts and gods?  
Hard for humans to know, ghosts cannot invade,  
Is this not true words?  
This Way is simplest and easiest,  
Brief and not complex,  
Knowing it one stands at sage’s rank,  
No need three years nine cuts.  
But world lacks virtue men, no true men,  
Many cling to sticks and axes, still think it far.  
Immortal Elder said:  
“Want to leave secret in human world,  
Not met a single true listener.”  
How sad indeed!

### Poem Twelve

Plants and trees yin and yang both complete,  
If lacking one will not bloom or thrive.  
First green leaves open, yang first to rise,  
Then red flowers bloom, yin follows.  
Common dao is daily use,  
True source returns here, who knows?  
Reply to learning dao gentlemen,  
Do not confuse yin and yang, do not act rashly.

This poem says virtue cannot be neglected.  
It says dao cannot be unclear.  
Yi says: one yin one yang is called dao.  
Also says: Heaven and Earth mist together, all things transform pure,  
Man and woman mate essence, all things born.  
Golden Elixir Way uses yang strong and yin gentle as operation,  
Yin and yang united, then elixir born and life extended;  
Yin and yang opposed, then discord and life lost.  
Look at plants and trees, heartless things,  
First green leaves yang first to rise, then red flowers yin follows,  
Yin and yang never separate.  
By analogy, all sentient common dao,  
Nothing outside yin and yang; only difference is common dao is 顺行 yin and yang,  
Immortal dao is 逆运 yin and yang.  
顺行 is following yin and yang;  
逆运 is reversing yin and yang.  
World only knows 顺行 dao, not 逆运 dao,  
So lost in false realm, confused true source,  
Yang extreme then yin, yin extreme then death.  
Students first must know yin and yang two things.  
Knowing yin and yang is knowing true source.  
True source is mysterious female gate,  
Yin born here, yang born here,顺 also here,逆 also here.  
Knowing constant return to origin, stand at sage realm.  
But yin and yang not one,  
There is primordial yin and yang, postnatal yin and yang,  
Fate yin and yang, nature yin and yang,  
True yin and yang, false yin and yang,  
Outer yin and yang, inner yin and yang.  
All these yin and yang must be thoroughly understood,  
Then dare to begin.  
If not knowing true yin and true yang,  
Act recklessly, abandon true for false,  
Send nature and fate away.

### Poem Thirteen

Not knowing the mystery of reversal,  
How know how to plant lotus in fire?  
Lead white tiger home to nurture,  
Produce bright pearl like full moon.  
Foolishly guard medicine furnace watching fire timing,  
Just calm spirit and let nature be.  
All yin stripped away, elixir ripens,  
Leaping out of cage, live ten thousand years.

This poem teaches to know yin and yang,  
This poem teaches to understand功夫.  
功夫 is the method of reversing yin and yang.  
Not knowing yin and yang reversal method,  
How know fire planting lotus’s marvel?  
What is reversal?  
Reversal is overturning yin and yang, counteracting creation.  
White tiger belongs to metal, Gan palace’s one point strong and upright qi,  
Called dao heart, representing true knowing feeling.  
Because mingling postnatal, human heart acting, dao heart hidden,  
True feeling dim and false feeling born,  
Like white tiger leaving home to hurt others.  
Reversal is returning true feeling from false feeling,  
Matching true nature, like leading white tiger back home to nurture.  
True feeling moves, true nature appears, nature and feeling love,  
Primordial true one qi comes from void,  
Forms one bright pearl, like full moon, shining bright,  
Mountains and rivers as in palm, Golden Elixir has form.  
“Gold returns to nature first, then called returning elixir.”  
Returning elixir formed, good knowing and good ability,  
Stillness is non-action, movement is natural,  
Calm and moderate middle way.  
Medicine is fire, fire is medicine,  
功夫 of taking it useless,  
Just calm spirit and let nature be,  
In creation’s furnace, yin and yang harmonious qi,  
True fire burns away postnatal all yin,  
Transforms to pure yang, called elixir ripened.  
Swallow and take, shed old skin,  
Leap out of mundane cage, live as long as Heaven.

### Poem Fourteen

Three five one, three characters,  
Ancient and modern enlightened few.  
East three south two make five,  
North one west four add up.  
Wu and Ji return to life number five,  
Three families meet and form baby.  
Know then Taiyi holds true qi,  
Ten months fetus round enters holy base.

This poem has yin-yang reversal principle,  
This poem speaks of clustering Five Phases功夫.  
At life’s start, Five Phases nature is one qi whole.  
Because mingling postnatal, each with own nature.  
Metal and wood not together, water and fire not mingled.  
True earth buried, false earth rampant.  
Nature confused, fate unstable,  
Yang qi exhausted and yin qi pure, how can one live?  
Immortal Elder proposes three five three characters,  
Teaching to cluster Five Phases, return to one family,  
Restore original good knowing and good ability, perfect heavenly principle.  
But three five one three qi, ancient and modern lost countless heroes.  
Among them few enlightened.

Three five means He Tu Five Phase birth numbers.  
East three wood, south two fire.  
Fire born of wood, wood and fire one family, one five.  
West four metal, north one water,  
Water born of metal, metal and water one family, one five.  
Central earth self forms one family, one five.  
Cultivators who understand three five, reverse cultivate,  
Harmonize four images, cluster Five Phases,  
Nature, feeling, essence, qi, spirit condense,  
Benevolence, righteousness, propriety, wisdom, faith same qi,  
This is three families meeting, called Tai Ji in Confucianism,  
Also called heavenly principle, utmost goodness, utmost sincerity;  
In Dao called baby, primordial one qi,  
Also called sacred embryo, Golden Elixir;  
In Buddhism called perfect enlightenment, true emptiness, dharma body, relic, mani jewel, and so on.  
In sum called heavenly good original nature.  
Dao returns original nature, good knowing and good ability return primordial,  
Nurture ten months, qi full spirit complete,  
Escape bitter sea, body outside body,  
Enter no birth no death holy base.

### Poem Fifteen

Not knowing true lead is true ancestor,  
All功夫 vain exertion.  
Abandon wife and send away yin and yang,  
Cutting seed only empties intestines and stomach.  
Plants, wood, gold, silver all dross,  
Clouds, mist, sun, moon all dim.  
Even breathing and imagining present,  
All unlike Golden Elixir matters.

This poem says clustering Five Phases returns to one qi,  
Only then enter holy base.  
But clustering Five Phases needs to know primordial true one qi,  
Only then can begin.  
One yang in Kan is Gan family strong upright qi,  
Dao heart true knowing, symbolized as true lead, born of Heaven One.  
Having primordial true one qi is ancestor qi of life,  
Becoming sage and immortal, making Buddha and immortal,  
Root of sages, seed of immortal Buddha, Golden Elixir true ancestor.  
“Know the one, all things done” means this.  
If not knowing true lead, no ancestor,  
Then refining no root.  
All abandon wife and cut grain,  
Burn plants, wood, gold, silver,  
Swallow clouds, mist, sun, moon,  
Breathing out turbid qi, imagining images,  
All功夫 either emptiness or form,  
All vain exertion, unrelated to Golden Elixir.

### Poem Sixteen

Ten thousand volumes of immortal scriptures all say the same,  
Golden Elixir is only this root ancestor.  
Relying on Kun place to generate body,  
Seed planted in Gan family mingling palace.  
Do not blame Heavenly Secret leaking,  
All because students are foolish and ignorant.  
If one understands poem’s meaning,  
Immediately see Three Pure Ones Most High.

The above fifteen poems, some speak 顺, some speak 逆, some separately, some combined;  
Some point to medicine, some show fire timing,  
Distinguishing true and false, right and wrong, subtle layers, scattered yet not whole.  
Fear people doubt complexity, hard to advance,  
Thus this poem summarizes fifteen poems’ meaning,  
Showing utmost simple and easy Way.

Ancient immortals and true ones, alchemical scriptures and dao books,  
Thousands of similes and hundred metaphors,  
Setting images and words, striving to reveal dao marrow,  
Though words differ, principle is same,  
All clarify Golden Elixir root ancestor.  
But later generations, more books more confusion,  
Each holding own view, tending to side doors,  
How know Golden Elixir root ancestor is taking Kan filling Li,  
Relying on Kun returning to Gan one move?

Kun place generating body is Kan’s one yang;  
Gan family mingling palace is Li’s one yin.  
Kan is originally Kun body, thus called Kun place;  
Li is originally Gan body, thus called Gan family.  
Gan easy to know, Kun easy to do;  
Gan strong and vigorous, Kun gentle and compliant.  
Because strong and vigorous, easy to know and not difficult;  
Because gentle and compliant, easy to do and no forcing.  
Easy to know and easy to do is human original good knowing and good ability nature.  
Life’s toughness, strong and compliant as one,  
Hard and soft mixed, unknown and unknowing,  
Following Emperor’s law, round and bright, shining clear,  
Pure and naked, red and bright,  
Only one good knowing and good ability nature, no dross.  
When two-eight years, yang extreme gives birth to yin, mingling postnatal,  
Yin qi acting, principle and desire mixed,  
Strong and gentle mismatched, hard and soft lose measure,  
Yang falls into yin, heavenly truth dimmed,  
Like Gan meeting Kun, Gan’s one yang enters Kun palace,  
Kun hexagram solid becomes Kan.  
Yin steals yang place, knowledge opens,  
Like Kun meeting Gan, Kun’s one yin enters Gan palace,  
Gan hexagram hollow becomes Li.  
Heavenly truth dim means dao heart hidden and faint;  
Knowledge open means human heart born and dangerous.  
Faint means almost none but barely present, yang not surpassing yin;  
Danger means seeing images and producing feeling, yin surpassing yang.  
Though dao heart faint, human heart dangerous,  
Dao heart not yet fully extinguished, human heart not yet fully flourishing.  
Dao heart not fully extinguished because sometimes white born in black, called true knowing,  
But only sometimes gained sometimes lost.  
Human heart not fully flourishing because able to respond to events, called spiritual knowing,  
But only borrowing spirit to create delusion.

Way of refining elixir is yin returning to yang,  
Taking dao heart’s true knowing, transforming human heart’s spiritual knowing.  
Spiritual knowing returns to truth, true knowing returns to spirit,  
Dao heart strong, human heart gentle;  
Yin and yang mingle, hard and soft respond;  
Strong and gentle matched, true and spirit not scattered;  
Returning to original good knowing and good ability face,  
Called taking Kan filling Li, also called relying on Kun planting Gan.  
In truth relying on Kun place generating body,  
Planting toward Gan family mingling palace,  
Is taking Kan filling Li meaning.  
Taking Kan means yang trapped in Kan comes out, thus still Kun;  
Filling Li means yin mixed in Li changes, Li still Gan.  
Gan and Kun body formed, primal female stands and valley spirit lives,  
Golden Elixir condenses, nature and fate in hand,  
Not bound by postnatal creation.  
This is Heaven’s secret passed down through ten thousand kalpas.  
Ancient immortals unwilling to clearly reveal.  
Immortal Elder great compassion, in sixteen poems,  
Reveals what ancients did not,  
Truly uprooting Heaven’s root and carving principle cave.  
Ending directly points Golden Elixir root ancestor,  
Heaven’s secret fully revealed.  
If one understands poem’s subtle meaning,  
Immediately ascend sage realm,  
See Three Pure Ones Most High, not empty words!
