# Direct Point of Awakening, Volume Two

Sixty-four Seven-Character Quatrains, According to the Sixty-Four Hexagrams of the Zhou Yi

### On the Cauldron and Furnace, Two Poems:

**First**

First take Heaven and Earth as the cauldron and vessel,  
Next seize the black crow and white rabbit’s medicine to cook.  
Once the two things are driven back to the Yellow Path,  
How could the Golden Elixir fail to be born?

Qian is vigor, symbolizing Heaven; Kun is compliance, symbolizing Earth. In humans, they represent the nature of firmness and gentleness. The sun’s center holds the crow, the yang within yin; in the hexagram, this is Li—outer yang, inner yin—within which one yin is the True Yin, the numinous wisdom hidden in the human heart. The moon’s center holds the rabbit, the yin within yang; in the hexagram, this is Kan—outer yin, inner yang—within which one yang is the True Yang, the genuine knowledge possessed by the dao heart.

First, take Heaven and Earth as the cauldron and vessel, meaning the firm vigor and gentle compliance form the body of elixir creation. Next, seize the crow and rabbit’s medicine to cook, meaning the true knowledge and numinous wisdom are the tools of elixir making. Refine true knowledge without a trace of falsity, so firmness returns to central uprightness; refine numinous wisdom without a hint of obscurity, so gentleness returns to central uprightness. When firmness and gentleness both return to the center, the dao heart strengthens the human heart’s compliance; true knowledge and numinous wisdom merge as one, like driving the crow and rabbit back to the Yellow Path. The Yellow Path is the middle way, the path of the sun’s movement. The sun moves on the middle path; the moon moves on nine paths. The nine paths are four pairs of azure, vermilion, white, and black, outside the Yellow Path, inside and outside making eight paths. The moon and sun meet, crossing paths to form the nine paths. The meeting place of sun and moon is called the return of the two things to the Yellow Path. At life’s beginning, there is only one innate good knowledge and true numinous nature, with no human heart nor dao heart. After interaction with the postnatal, human heart and dao heart separate, as do true knowledge and numinous wisdom.

The human heart is all perception and movement; perception is numinous wisdom. The dao heart is all encounter without confusion; non-confusion is true knowledge. The human heart can only have numinous wisdom, not true knowledge; its nature is soft, thus called yin. The dao heart, possessing true knowledge and also numinous wisdom, has firm energy, thus called yang. Even sages have human hearts; even ordinary people have dao hearts. Sages have human hearts because they cannot extinguish perception; ordinary people have dao hearts because some part is not darkened. The difference between sages and ordinary people is that sages’ true numinous nature is unified, knowing and perceiving, always undimmed. Ordinary people’s true numinous nature is separated; knowing and perceiving cannot but be dimmed. Moreover, the human heart harbors the consciousness spirit, which borrows numinous wisdom to generate delusion, perceives scenes to create feeling, like wind stirring waves—numinous wisdom returns to the false, and the human heart is precarious indeed.

The human heart is precarious; evil qi flourishes while righteous qi weakens; the dao heart is not manifest, and the dao heart is but faint. Cultivate the dao and refine the dao heart’s true knowledge firmness, returning to central uprightness; temper the human heart’s numinous wisdom softness, returning to central uprightness. When firmness and softness unite, vigor and compliance correspond, essence and unity prevail, truly holding the mean; good knowledge and good ability are the whole of Heaven’s principle, flowing as one qi. How could the Golden Elixir not be born? The Golden Elixir is the condensation of the two qi of firmness and softness; true knowledge and numinous wisdom return to central uprightness, Heaven and man blend as one, like a single precious pearl suspended in empty space, illuminating everywhere. The Golden Elixir has form, emerging from subtlety to manifestation, from birth to ripeness—how could it fail to liberate?

**Second**

Set the furnace and stand the cauldron by Heaven and Earth’s method,  
Forge and refine essence and spirit to shape soul and body.  
Gather and scatter the mist and vapor into transformation,  
Dare not treat the profound mystery with casual words.

The furnace moves the fire; the cauldron tempers the medicine. The Golden Elixir’s way follows Kun’s gentleness as furnace, step by step; imitates Qian’s vigor as cauldron, fierce cooking and rapid refining. Able to be firm and gentle, vigorous and compliant; the will is strong, the longer the stronger; the cauldron and furnace stable, unmoving, unshaken; thus able to gather medicine and move fire. The human heart’s numinous wisdom is outer yang and inner yin, like the sun’s essence radiating outward; the dao heart’s true knowledge is like the moon’s brilliance, hidden inside. Numinous wisdom is outer yang, belonging to the soul; true knowledge is outer yin, belonging to the body. Numinous wisdom is essence of soul, called “spirit within spirit”; true knowledge is brilliance of body, called “not spirit but appearing spirit.” Spirit within spirit contains falsehood; not spirit but spirit contains truth within falsehood. Tempering essence means removing the false from the human heart’s numinous wisdom, refining the true within the dao heart’s falsehood. When false spirit departs and true spirit settles, the soul does not flee but is controlled; when true knowledge appears and false knowledge vanishes, the body does not scatter but is controlled. When soul and body are controlled, true knowledge and numinous wisdom, nature and feeling, unite as one qi, misty and harmonious, gathering and dispersing in transformation, quietly simmering without movement, responding and thus communicating—each step and each move is Heaven’s secret. The marvels here cannot be described in words.

### On the Waning Moon Furnace, Two Poems:

**Third**

Waste not effort on the alchemical stove,  
To refine medicine seek the waning moon furnace.  
There is a natural true fire and proper timing,  
No need for firewood, charcoal, or blowing breath.

The waning moon appears on the third day of the month, showing a hooked light in the Kun direction; its light inclines and bends, hence called waning moon. In humans, it is the utmost stillness with a single point of yang light revealed, resembling the waning moon; in the hexagram, it is Zhen—“on the third day the thunder emerges, the moonlight gleams on Qu River bank.” This single point of yang light is not something else—it is the dao heart’s light. What is hardest in the elixir way is the dao heart. When the dao heart appears, Heaven’s principle shines forth, vigor gradually rises, mountains, rivers, and earth become all numinous medicine, picked at will, each point the dao. Medicine is fire, fire is medicine; there is a natural furnace of creation, a true fire—why need the stove, firewood, charcoal, or blowing breath?

**Fourth**

In the waning moon furnace grows the jade pistil,  
Within the cinnabar cauldron mercury lies still.  
Only after fire’s strength is harmonized,  
Can the yellow sprout be sown and slowly grow.

The waning moon furnace is what was called the dao heart. Jade is soft and gentle, belonging to yin; pistil is radiant, belonging to yang. Jade pistil is yang within yin, symbolizing the dao heart’s true knowledge. The cinnabar cauldron is the human heart. Mercury is fluid and unstable, belonging to yin, yang within yin, symbolizing the human heart’s numinous wisdom. When the dao heart is constant and true knowledge undimmed, the human heart’s numinous wisdom naturally calms and cannot fly away; then by harmonizing efforts, using the dao heart’s true fire, the false spirit in the human heart is refined away, returning to empty spirit. Heaven and man together arise; true knowledge and numinous wisdom become one; knowledge arrives and intention is sincere—this is called the yellow sprout. The yellow sprout is where the true numinous nature is planted; its spirit finds soil and warmth, like grass in earth, a sprout turning yellow, hence the name. After fire’s strength is harmonized, true knowledge and numinous wisdom return to central uprightness, entering the central upper cauldron; then by adding true intention’s nurturing work, after ten months’ qi is full, it naturally matures and liberates.

### On True Lead, Four Poems:

**Fifth**

Swallowing saliva and receiving qi is human practice,  
Only with substance can creation and transformation arise.  
If inside the cauldron there is no true seed,  
It is like boiling empty water and fire in a hollow pot.

The dao heart’s true knowledge holds the primordial true one’s qi. It is symbolized as lead, the true seed of becoming sage, saint, Buddha, or immortal. To cultivate the great elixir, if you abandon this true seed, there is nothing else. The world’s deluded fools only cultivate the body, the visible and tangible; swallowing saliva and receiving qi, they claim to cultivate the dao, not knowing the body produces only postnatal dregs, how could it birth the primordial numinous elixir? This is like having no true seed in the cauldron, merely boiling water and fire in an empty pot.

**Sixth**

Harmonizing lead and mercury is key to forming the elixir,  
Neither too big nor too small, both kingdoms intact.  
If you ask what true lead is,  
Moonlight all day shines on the western river.

The Golden Elixir is formed by the dao heart’s true knowledge as true lead, and the human heart’s numinous wisdom as true mercury. To cultivate the Golden Elixir, first harmonize lead and mercury. The dao heart is firm, belonging to yang, thus large; the human heart is soft, belonging to yin, thus small. Without the dao heart, the human heart borrows numinous wisdom to generate delusion, destroying the dao. If controlled by the dao heart, numinous wisdom is clear and undimmed, assisting the dao. The dao heart is indispensable, but the human heart must not be extinguished—only its deluded use of numinous wisdom must be restrained. The ancients taught to “kill the human heart,” meaning to kill the false spirit of the human heart, not its true spirit. If one does not distinguish true and false, killing all, one falls into stubborn emptiness and silence. To harm the small is to harm the great; yin and yang become isolated, life energy and breath vanish—how could the Golden Elixir Way be formed? Thus it is said “neither too big nor too small, both kingdoms intact.” Both kingdoms intact means human heart’s numinous wisdom and dao heart’s true knowledge unite as one, true knowledge governs numinous wisdom, numinous wisdom follows true knowledge, true numinous nature does not scatter, good knowledge and good ability remain, Heaven’s principle is whole, original nature is clear, and the Golden Elixir is formed.

True knowledge and numinous wisdom are the whole of good knowledge and good ability; in the primordial they are called good knowledge and good ability; in the postnatal they are called true knowledge and numinous wisdom. Returning from postnatal to primordial, true knowledge is good knowledge, numinous wisdom is good ability. True knowledge and numinous wisdom were originally one family, no difference. Because of mingling with postnatal, a bit of good knowledge’s heavenly innocence is lost outside, belonging to others; the good ability’s spirit in our home is mixed and impure, unstable and shifting. To return to origin and source, one must seek a true character within false knowledge, bringing it back home, so numinous wisdom is undimmed. This true knowledge is utmost firm and vigorous, thus symbolized as true lead. True knowledge has primordial true one’s qi, symbolized as gold in water, as moonlight. Gold in water and moonlight both mean yang within yin. But this true knowledge, not yet returned, is still others’ possession, thus “moonlight all day shines on the western river.” The moon holds the golden toad; the toad’s light is the moonlight, meaning true knowledge is dark outside and bright inside. All day it shines westward, not east, clearly lighting there. The Immortal Elder’s later poem says: “Master Gold is originally the eastern son, sent to the western neighbor to live in body.” This is exactly the meaning of moonlight all day shining on the western river. If the student can truly know moonlight shining west all day, that is truly knowing the whereabouts of true knowledge, then it can shine east and meet numinous wisdom. Ah! Yielding brings death, resisting brings life—often one searches in vain; true knowledge is not easily known!

**Seventh**

Do not enter the mountain before refining the returning elixir,  
Inside and outside the mountain all lack true lead.  
Such supreme treasure every home has,  
Only fools fail to recognize it fully.

To avoid the world and leave dust, entering the mountain to nurture stillness is a matter after elixir return. The ignorant enter mountains thinking they can live long. The Way of longevity requires obtaining the one true lead to be effective. But true lead must be sought in the dusty world. If entering the mountain to cultivate, inside and outside the mountain is all yin qi; how could there be true lead, the utmost yang? True lead is the primordial spiritual root, also called heavenly root, also called true one’s essence, true one’s qi, water village lead, gold in water, black within white, soul within spirit, black tiger, master gold, other family’s immortal method. The ancients used many symbols, but all return to reality: it describes one thing of the dao heart.

This dao heart, manifesting as the wondrous true knowledge, hidden as the pure true void, everyone possesses, each perfectly complete, neither increased by sages nor decreased by ordinary people, every home has it. Yet every home has it but not one’s own, because it cannot be seen or used. Because every home has it but not one’s own, fools meet it but do not recognize it, missing it face to face. Late Ming’s Peng Haogu did not understand this, taking “every home has it” literally as the female cauldron; recently Zhiji Zi also used the Three Peaks commentary. Such confusion misleads later students, a great fault indeed!

**Eighth**

When bamboo breaks, one must mend with bamboo,  
To hatch chicks, one must use eggs.  
All other things are futile labor,  
None compare to true lead matching the sage’s mechanism.

Bamboo breaks, must mend with bamboo; hatching chicks, must use eggs—seeking by likeness. The Three Forms and Likenesses says: “Same kind is easy to apply power; different kind is hard to craft skill.” If not of the same kind, not true seed; all other efforts are vain labor. The Golden Elixir Way belongs to sages. To learn from sages, one must seek the sage’s seed, that is the true lead’s true knowledge. With this true knowledge, cultivating the Great Way, none fail to match the sage’s mechanism. The sage’s mechanism is pure Heaven’s principle; true knowledge knows all and is all true, able to restore Heaven’s principle—thus it is called matching the sage’s mechanism. Once matched, one is a sage—why do learners not humble themselves?

### On Using Lead:

**Ninth**

Empty heart and solid belly, both meanings profound,  
Only because empty heart must recognize the heart.  
Better to refine lead and first fill the belly,  
Let the hall be filled with golden treasure.

The Golden Elixir Way requires both empty heart and solid belly. Empty heart means emptying the human heart, cultivating nature; solid belly means filling the dao heart, cultivating life. Empty heart and solid belly open nature and life; their meanings are profound. To empty the heart, one must recognize the heart. The heart has human heart and dao heart. The human heart should be empty, not solid; the dao heart should be solid, not empty. If one does not distinguish true and false, all is emptied, not only failing to understand life but also failing to understand nature. If one recognizes the heart, no need to empty the human heart first; first refine the true lead dao heart to fill the belly. When belly is full, meaning gathers and gives birth, guest qi dissipates, human heart empties itself. Four images harmonize, five phases cluster, gold and jade fill the hall, life treasure is in hand. Then one can empty the human heart and nurture the dao heart, understand the root of nature, and return to the land of no-thing.

### On Not Using Lead:

**Tenth**

Using lead means not using common lead;  
Using true lead means discarding it afterward.  
This is the true subtle secret of using lead,  
Using lead and not using it is sincere truth.

The method of elixir cultivation depends on gathering true lead. But lead is not all the same—there is common lead and true lead. Common lead comes from mountains, a tangible turbid thing, unrelated to us; true lead is stored in the homeland, an intangible dao heart, of our own kind. Since ancient times, the highest immortals who transcend the mundane rely on the true lead dao heart’s power; thus it is said using lead means not using common lead. But though the dao heart is primordial true treasure, it arises from the postnatal; sometimes it is used, sometimes not. Before the elixir is formed, one must borrow the dao heart’s true knowledge to control the human heart’s numinous wisdom. When the human heart is settled, numinous wisdom undimmed, dao heart and human heart move and rest as one, true knowledge and numinous wisdom correspond in emptiness and reality, the sacred embryo is formed; then one must quickly withdraw the dao heart’s firmness and gently nurture the embryo’s breath. Using the dao heart is to control the human heart; when the human heart is quiet, consciousness spirit extinguished, good knowledge and good ability still and unmoving, responding and communicating, true numinous nature alone remains bright and undimmed. The dao heart is no longer used; it can be or not be, all is empty; self and other all return to emptiness. Lu Ziye said: “The method of using lead is like a fish trap or rabbit snare.” Fish and rabbit rely on the trap to be caught; once caught, the trap is useless. The subtle secret of using lead lies here. If one does not know this secret, when the elixir is formed but still treats the dao heart as matter, inevitably using the dao heart again stirs the human heart; true numinous nature scatters again, the Golden Elixir gained and lost. Hence it is said using true lead means discarding it. The secret of using lead and not using it can be understood here.

### On Lead and Mercury:

**Eleventh**

In a dream I visited Western Splendor in the Nine Heavens,  
A perfected one taught me the Origin Chapter.  
Its words are simple, not many,  
Only teaching how to refine mercury and lead.

The Golden Elixir Way is utmost simple and easy, no many words, only refining the dao heart’s true knowledge and the human heart’s numinous wisdom. When the dao heart’s firmness returns to central uprightness, the dao heart remains constant. Using true knowledge to control numinous wisdom, the human heart’s softness returns to central uprightness, the human heart remains calm. Using numinous wisdom to cherish true knowledge, firmness and softness correspond, true numinous nature unites—this is called lead and mercury mutually attracted, the Golden Elixir condensed. The method is simple, not complex; even common folk can attain it and immediately ascend to sagehood. But many lack great virtue and blessing, so easily cannot obtain it. If one has great virtue and blessing, meeting a perfected one who points out the simple and wondrous method, it is like awakening from sleep, suddenly knowing the great medicine is within oneself, not from others, easily picked and used, all as wished. The Immortal Elder’s dream of visiting Western Splendor and receiving teaching has deep meaning, not mere words; Western Splendor is where true gold is born. Splendor means true gold’s bright light. The Nine Heavens are pure yang without yin. True gold is the symbol of true knowledge. In darkness, suddenly true knowledge’s yang light appears; picking this true knowledge to bring home and unite with numinous wisdom, refining with fire to the pure yang without yin place, called seven returns and nine reversions, golden liquid great elixir—is this truly a dream?

### On the One Qi from Emptiness and Nothingness:

**Twelfth**

The Dao arises from emptiness and nothingness as one qi,  
From one qi are born yin and yang;  
Yin and yang combine to form three bodies,  
The three bodies give birth again to myriad things.

The Way of nature and life, the Way of creation and transformation, endlessly giving birth. Tracing the source, the Way arises from emptiness and nothingness producing one qi; from one qi comes Heaven and Earth producing yin and yang; yin and yang combine again, containing one qi, forming three bodies. When three bodies are formed, one qi moves—yin then yang, yang then yin—thus myriad things are born. Like plants growing: first a sprout from earth, arising from emptiness and nothingness producing one qi; then the sprout splits two leaves, from one qi producing yin and yang; then from the two leaves a stem grows, yin and yang combining into three bodies; then branches and leaves grow, three bodies giving birth to myriad things. Heaven and Earth hear all sentient and insentient things arise from this emptiness and one qi, all following the Way of creation. Cultivators who know to follow this natural course, reverse it to cultivate, returning myriad to three, three to two, two to one, one to emptiness and nothingness, then soundless and scentless perfection is reached.

### On Kan and Li:

**Thirteenth**

Kan’s thunder cooks the roaring golden water,  
Fire bursts Kunlun’s yin and yang.  
If the two things return and unite,  
Naturally the elixir ripens, filling the body with fragrance.

Kan thunder is the image of fire arising in water, like the dao heart’s true knowledge discovered in utter darkness; the place of discovery is the living moment within oneself. Cooking and roaring is the image of flickering uncertainty. The golden water is the dao heart’s true knowledge, the essence of true unity, possessing the two qi of gold and water. Kunlun, in the west, is the ancestral mountain vein, where true gold is born. When the dao heart’s true knowledge emits in utter darkness like lightning flashing, flickering and uncertain, hard to grasp and easy to lose, quickly use the Li hexagram’s empty spirit fire to greet it; then true knowledge and numinous wisdom, nature and feeling, unite yin and yang. From this arises the primordial numinous medicine, again using natural true fire to refine away postnatal turbid qi, mining out pure gold; the Golden Elixir ripens, swallowed and taken, transforming body and bone, revealing the pure dharma body. Then fragrant winds fill the dusty world—how could it be only fragrant body alone?

### On Wu and Ji:

**Fourteenth**

If Li and Kan lack Wu and Ji,  
Though containing four images, the elixir cannot form.  
Because each holds true earth,  
Thus the Golden Elixir can return again.

Kan is water, representing primordial essence, manifesting as wisdom; water hides gold, representing true feeling, manifesting as righteousness. Li is fire, representing primordial spirit, manifesting as propriety; fire arises from wood, representing primordial nature, manifesting as benevolence. The dao heart has Kan’s image; the human heart has Li’s image; dao heart and human heart together possess the four natures of gold, wood, water, and fire. But the four natures are separate; to generate one qi, all depends on Wu and Ji’s work. Wu is yang earth, primordial qi, manifesting as faith; Ji is yin earth, intention, manifesting as desire. Kan receives Wu, in dao heart as faith; Li receives Ji, in human heart as intention. To correct the heart, first make intention sincere. When intention is sincere, Ji earth settles and human heart calms. To practice the dao, first establish faith; when faith is established, Wu earth appears and dao heart manifests. If dao heart lacks faith and human heart is not sincere, though there is benevolence, righteousness, propriety, and wisdom, they do not look to each other; the stored nature, feeling, and spirit oppose each other—how can the supreme numinous and sacred elixir be formed? Thus cultivators must focus on sincere intention and established faith; when intention and faith are established, dao heart manifests and human heart is correct. They harmonize, yin and yang respond; primordial qi comes from emptiness, condensing into a millet grain. Dispersion returns to gathering, departure returns to arrival; thus it is said “because each holds true earth, the Golden Elixir can return again.” Wu and Ji’s work is great indeed.

### On the Reversal of Kan and Li:

**Fifteenth**

The sun in Li’s place turns female,  
Kan paired with the toad palace is male;  
If you do not understand this reversal,  
Don’t speak arrogantly on what you do not know.

The sun in Li’s place (one text says Li holds the sun’s place).

Numinous wisdom is originally yang, but bright outside and dark inside, always inviting guest qi. Like the sun in Li’s place, outer yang inner yin, thus turns female. True knowledge is originally yin, but dark outside and bright inside, possessing righteous qi. Like Kan paired with the toad palace, outer yin inner yang, yet male. The postnatal human heart borrows numinous wisdom to generate delusion; the dao heart’s heavenly innocence is hidden, like a woman in charge and a man stepping down.

The Way of elixir uses the dao heart’s true knowledge to control the human heart’s numinous wisdom; uses the human heart’s numinous wisdom to follow the dao heart’s true knowledge. Male is firm, female is gentle; the man leads, the woman obeys; great achievements never fail. If you do not understand this reversal, you cannot recognize the dao heart’s true knowledge nor the human heart’s numinous wisdom; you confuse and mix, taking false for true—do not speak arrogantly and deceive yourself and others.

**Sixteenth**

Take the solid heart within Kan,  
Transform the yin within Li’s belly;  
From this change arises the firm Qian body,  
Hidden and leaping all depends on the heart.

Kan’s place is the solid heart, the dao heart’s true knowledge; Li’s belly yin is the human heart’s numinous wisdom. Extract Kan’s true knowledge dao heart, transform Li’s numinous wisdom human heart. In an instant, yin qi dissipates and yang qi returns, revealing the original Qian primordial face, restoring good knowledge and good ability’s true nature. Quiet and unmoving, responding and thus communicating; responding and thus communicating, quiet and unmoving. Hence it is said from this arises the firm Qian body, hidden and leaping all depends on the heart. The body is not the illusory form body, but the dharma body’s true body. The dharma body is original nature. At life’s beginning, one point of true numinous nature, perfectly bright and undimmed, firm and upright, pure without a trace of dregs. Like Qian’s three wonders, pure yang without yin; after mingling with postnatal, heavenly innocence is dimmed, numinous qi is false, like Qian hexagram’s empty forming Li, Kun hexagram’s solid forming Kan. The empty center means the true has departed; the solid center means the true is trapped. Taking Kan to fill Li is returning to heavenly innocence, restoring the original true numinous nature, like Li sealed and then changed to Qian. When true numinous nature returns, mastery is in hand, always responding and always pure, left and right, all appropriate; hidden and leaping, how could it not all depend on the heart? Later people fail to understand this, thinking taking Kan to fill Li means taking kidney qi to mingle with the heart; others think kidney qi rises and falls to the crimson palace. Alas! Such strange ideas, heart and kidney are not Kan and Li. Taking Kan and Li as heart and kidney is great folly.

### On the Five Phases:

**Seventeenth**

Dragon mercury comes from Li’s home,  
Tiger lead is born in Kan’s place.  
These two arise because son produces mother,  
The Five Phases must all enter the center.

Zhen is dragon, wood mercury; Dui is tiger, metal lead. Li is fire; Kan is water. Dragon mercury comes from Li’s home—wood born in fire; tiger lead born in Kan’s place—metal born in water. Wood born of fire is eternally immortal wood; metal born of water is eternally uncorrupted metal. Wood produces fire, fire reciprocates wood; metal produces water, water reciprocates metal—this is son producing mother. The ancient scripture says: “When the Five Phases do not follow their order, dragon emerges in fire; when the Five Phases are reversed, tiger is born in water.” Human qi and nature are easily moving, like wood mercury’s floating nature; if refined by primordial spirit’s fire, dregs are burned away, nature transforms and true nature appears, eternally unmoving. Human delusion is heavy, like metal lead’s sinking nature; if purified by pure one’s water, filth is washed away, delusion disappears and true feeling condenses, eternally without feeling. Not only that, when qi and nature transform, fire without nature, consciousness spirit extinguished yet primordial spirit lives; desire gone, no lustful thought, turbid essence transformed and primordial essence unblemished. True nature appears, true feeling condenses, primordial spirit born, primordial essence solid. Nature, feeling, and spirit return to one qi; benevolence, righteousness, propriety, wisdom return to one faith—this is the full Five Phases. When Five Phases are whole, perfectly one, this is Five Phases entering the center. If Five Phases do not enter the center, they scatter and the Golden Elixir cannot form. If Five Phases enter the center, they become one qi, yin and yang unite—this is the Golden Elixir formed. If missing east or west, losing south or north, seeking other medicines but wanting to form the Golden Elixir is difficult. The poem’s concern is the line “Five Phases must all enter the center.” If Five Phases do not enter the center, they scatter and the Golden Elixir does not form. If Five Phases enter the center, Five Phases become one qi, Golden Elixir forms naturally. Should the student not first understand the Five Phases?

### On the Two Strings:

**Eighteenth**

The moon just half bright on the horizon,  
Already the dragon’s roar and tiger’s roar sound.  
Best to cultivate the two eights,  
Within one hour the elixir is formed.

The Golden Elixir is the dragon nature and tiger feeling, the two string qi combined. First take the upper string’s eight taels of metal as the elixir mother; next take the lower string’s half jin of wood to form the sacred embryo. What are the two strings? The moon from the third day yields one yang; by the eighth day, yin within yang’s half “G,” flat as a rope, like a bowstring “D.” Because the yang light is on top, it is called the upper string. The fifteenth day is full moon “O,” the sixteenth day is one yin embryo, the eighteenth day one yin appears; by the twenty-third day, yang within yin’s half “D,” flat as a rope, like a bowstring “G.” Because the yang light is below, it is called the lower string. The moon’s yang light comes from the west, tiger belongs to metal, metal is in the west, thus the eighth day moon is called the tiger’s string qi; the moon’s yin body comes from the east, dragon belongs to water, wood is in the east, thus the twenty-third day moon is called the dragon’s string qi. True knowledge’s feeling is firm, like the tiger, like the moon’s yang light; numinous wisdom’s nature is soft, like the dragon, like the moon’s yin body. True knowledge’s firm feeling advances to central uprightness, like the moon’s upper string yang light, the metal eight taels; numinous wisdom’s soft nature retreats to central uprightness, like the moon’s lower string withdrawing yin body, the wood eight taels. When the moon just half bright on the horizon, true knowledge’s firm feeling advances to central uprightness. True knowledge advances to central uprightness, soft within firm; numinous wisdom is controlled by true knowledge, no longer flying; yang governs yin and yin follows yang—there is dragon’s roar and tiger’s roar, responding in one voice, seeking in one qi. At this time, best to cultivate, using yang to aid yin, soft numinous wisdom also returning to central uprightness. Numinous wisdom returns to central uprightness, firm within soft; true knowledge and numinous wisdom both return to central uprightness; the two eights of string qi, numbers sufficient, yin and yang balanced, firm and soft as one—within one hour the elixir is formed. But before the two eights are full, or yang too much and yin too little, or yang too little and yin too much, the elixir cannot form. Only yin and yang balanced, neither偏 nor倚, called center, can within one hour form the elixir. One hour’s work, how easily done? Without decades of deathless effort, one cannot suddenly reach this realm.

### On Harmonizing:

**Nineteenth**

On Huayue’s cliff the mighty tiger roars,  
At Fusang’s sea bottom the female dragon sings.  
Yellow Granny herself knows how to match,  
Sending them as husband and wife with one heart.

Huayue is in the west, Fusang in the east; tiger is metal feeling, dragon is wood nature. At birth, nature and feeling are originally united, metal and wood side by side; after mingling with postnatal, false comes and true dims, nature and feeling split apart, like dragon east and tiger west. The tiger is called mighty because metal feeling is firm; the dragon is called female because wood nature is gentle. Though true feeling is separated by false feeling, true nature covered by false dwelling, true feeling and true nature still desire to meet. Mountain cliff’s mighty tiger roars, sea bottom’s female dragon sings—yin and yang obstructed, yet secretly connected; obstruction and secret connection allow meeting, but without harmonizing substance, they cannot unite. Yellow Granny is also called true earth, true intention, true faith. When true faith appears, intention is sincere and heart correct; false departs and true comes; feeling returns to nature; in an instant nature and feeling unite, like matchmakers communicating between two families, sending them as husband and wife sharing one heart.

**Twentieth**

Red dragon and black tiger each west and east,  
Four images intersect in Wu and Ji.  
From this, Fu and Gou can be used,  
Who says the Golden Elixir does not succeed?

Wood can birth fire; fire and wood are one family, thus called red dragon. Metal can birth water; metal and water are one family, thus called black tiger. Metal, wood, water, and fire are the four images; Wu and Ji are earth, which harmonizes the four images, making the Five Phases. But Five Phases in order is the world’s fiery pit; Five Phases reversed is the earth’s seven treasures—this depends on human use. The dao heart’s true knowledge’s feeling moving is called Fu; the human heart’s numinous wisdom’s nature still is called Gou. The method is to advance yang fire to make elixir; the method is to retreat yin talisman to nurture. When time to use yang, use yang; when time to use yin, use yin. Yang firm and yin compliant, use nine and six, each according to time; true knowledge and numinous wisdom unite, enter the center, Five Phases cluster, Golden Elixir accomplished naturally.

### On Dragon and Tiger:

**Twenty-first**

White tiger of the western mountain rages wildly,  
Blue dragon of the eastern sea is unstoppable.  
Catch both hands to force a death match,  
Transforming into a single block of purple-gold frost.

Both hands (one text says two beasts)

True knowledge’s feeling and numinous wisdom’s nature, though primordial, fall to postnatal, reason and desire mixed; true and false mingled, long separated, cannot suddenly tame each other. Thus the western mountain’s white tiger rages wildly, eastern sea’s blue dragon is unstoppable. But the Golden Elixir Way borrows false to cultivate true, using true to transform false. The method follows desire, gradually guiding, a lower layer of deathly work; discord must lead to harmony, disharmony to accord; the longer the stronger, delusion fades, true feeling arises, qi and nature vanish, true feeling appears, false forever extinguished, true forever lasting. Feeling without feeling is true feeling; nature without nature is true nature. True feeling and true nature unite as one, heart dead and spirit alive, unaware and unknown, following Heaven’s law, transforming into a block of purple-gold frost. Gold is firm and indestructible. Gold turning purple comes from the great fire furnace, becoming pure gold. Purple gold transformed into frost, form and substance vanish, perfectly one qi, transcending yin and yang.

### On Refining Oneself, Three Poems:

**Twenty-second**

First observe Heaven’s five thieves clearly,  
Next examine Earth to settle the people.  
When people are settled and country rich, then seek battle,  
After battle, then one can see the sage.

Observing Heaven means observing our heavenly nature; understanding the five thieves means understanding the mutual overcoming of the Five Phases of metal, wood, water, fire, and earth. Examining Earth means examining our heart’s ground; settling the people means settling spirit, soul, and intention each in their place. The Way of elixir cultivation begins with refining oneself; the key is first to observe heavenly nature. If heavenly nature is undimmed, the five thieves cannot deceive. Next, examine the heart’s ground; if heart’s ground is pure and quiet, all five elements are settled; if all five are settled, essence is solid and spirit complete, soul fixed and body calm. Sincere intention means country rich; then battle the five thieves and expel the myriad yin. Yin qi transforms into yang qi; killing energy changes to life energy; then one can see the sage. The sage is the original face of good knowledge and good ability, also called the sacred embryo. The five thieves subdued transform into five origins, manifesting as five virtues, quietly unmoving, responding and communicating, unaware and unknown, following Heaven’s law—is this not the sacred embryo? The poem’s emphasis on battle has deep meaning: the five thieves in the heart act on Heaven; without great power to subdue, one cannot conquer. Battling them is to exert great effort, arouse great mechanism, be brave and diligent, the longer the stronger, not allowing halfway abandonment. The ancient immortal said: “Not a speck of yang qi exhausted, no death; not a speck of yin qi exhausted, no immortality.” Refining oneself must refine until not a speck of yin qi remains; Five Phases mixed and transformed, mining out pure gold, then done.

**Twenty-third**

When using generals, divide left and right armies,  
Let them take turns as master and guest.  
I advise you not to underestimate the enemy in battle,  
Lest you lose our family’s priceless treasure.

The Way of refining oneself cannot succeed suddenly; it must follow desire and gradually guide. The true numinous nature’s orifice has long been sealed, habits deep, five thieves causing havoc; not one morning or evening can easily eradicate. Using generals means dividing left and right armies; letting the other be master and oneself guest. To take from others, one must first give firmly. I advise you not to underestimate the enemy in battle, lest you lose our family’s priceless treasure. Guard against danger inside, diligently refine outside; then false can be removed, true preserved—why fear the Great Way not forming?

**Twenty-fourth**

Fire born in wood’s root hides its edge,  
If you don’t research deeply, don’t force attack.  
Disaster arises from this harming oneself,  
You must subdue and seek Master Gold.

Humans act postnatally, consciousness spirit in charge; the five phases’ qi in the body, roots of vexation and dust from kalpas, plus current habits and filth, all arise at once. Without great power and great means, how can one attack and conquer all? If one does not study the true principle and rashly acts, using mind to control mind, attacking too fiercely, sometimes fire meets fire, not only failing to attack thieves but being attacked by thieves; not only useless but harmful. Like fire born in wood, disaster arises and wood is burned by fire, harming its own root. The Cantong Qi says: “Sun flows pearls, always wanting to remove others; finally gaining golden brilliance, turning and depending on each other.” Golden brilliance is the dao heart. The dao heart is not mind’s mind; it arises from the true body, possessing true knowledge’s feeling, firm and upright qi, hiding nothing from all things. When dao heart’s light appears, all evil retreats; its decisiveness and firmness are like gold’s sharpness. Thus it is named Master Gold; studying the true principle means studying how gold controls wood. The great elixir uses Master Gold as the main actor; if abandoning Master Gold to refine oneself, one only invites disaster. Thus Zhang Sanfeng said: “When refining oneself, one must use true lead.” True lead and Master Gold are both other names for the dao heart.

### On Master Gold:

**Twenty-fifth**

Master Gold is originally the eastern son,  
Sent to the western neighbor to live in body.  
Recognize and call him home to nurture,  
Match him with the house’s daughter to form affection.

Calling (one text says “summon”); forming affection (one text says “marry”)

Master Gold is the dao heart’s true knowledge. True knowledge is true feeling. Human nature and feeling are originally one family, no difference; body means nature; function means feeling. Feeling is nature, nature is feeling, same origin different names, not two. After mingling with postnatal, nature and feeling shift; true feeling dims and false feeling arises. Firm and upright qi is guest qi, not belonging to me. Like the eastern son sent to the western neighbor. Though sent to the western neighbor, not forever apart; only seen but not recognized. If one is a determined scholar, thoroughly investigating principle, recognizing truth, one call and he comes, like sound echoing in an empty valley, no effort. One can nurture him in a secret chamber, constantly protecting, matching with the house’s daughter true nature, yin and yang as one qi, forming affection, still the eastern son’s possession. The house’s daughter is the house’s girl, the numinous wisdom’s nature. Nature is originally yang but called female, nature is gentle, symbolizing wood, thus called girl; feeling is originally yin but called male, feeling is firm, symbolizing metal, thus called Master Gold. Master Gold long gone outside, once returned home, meeting the girl, affection deepens, elixir is born. Thus the Cantong Qi says: “When gold returns to nature, the returning elixir is named.” Metal and wood together, feeling and nature united, this is the returning elixir; nothing else is returning elixir.

### On the Girl:

**Twenty-sixth**

The girl wanders with her own path,  
The front short, the back long.  
Returning she enters Yellow Granny’s house,  
Marrying Master Gold as her old husband.

The girl is the numinous wisdom’s nature explained before. Because she enters postnatal, the human heart holds the consciousness spirit, inevitably false within true; delusion arises from spirit, flying when seeing fire, wandering uncertainly, entering and leaving at no set time, unknown to her home. To cultivate the Golden Elixir, one must first make this one point of spirit wander on the proper path, empty her spirit without dimming it, so spirit returns to true spirit. The front short means nature seeking feeling; the back long means spirit nurturing true. Seeking feeling by nature is the elixir’s wondrous moment, thus short; nurturing true by spirit is ten months’ nurturing work, thus long. Short when short is proper, long when long is proper—this is her own path. Follow her path and the Golden Elixir is hopeful. But first one must discard cleverness and destroy wisdom, return light and reflect. Settle this one point of spirit in the central upright place, called returning to enter Yellow Granny’s house. Yellow Granny’s house is the impartial, balanced place. Spirit centered, heart correct and intention sincere, intention sincere and faith true, faith true and not wandering outside. Thus by nature seeking feeling, feeling returns to nature, nature and feeling unite, become one qi, called marrying Master Gold as old husband. “Old husband” is not common speech, has deep meaning. The Way of elixir begins by spirit calling true feeling; true feeling then makes spirit unmoving; spirit returns to true. Then spirit seals true feeling, must nurture true feeling in pure yang without yin place. Like old husband and old wife, husband and wife grow old together, not breaking midway. This is the meaning of the back long; students must deeply study.

### On Fire Timing, Two Poems:

**Twenty-seven**

Though you know cinnabar and black lead,  
If you do not know fire timing, it is idle.  
Mostly all depends on cultivation power,  
A hair’s difference and the elixir does not form.

The Way of returning elixir is to take cinnabar and black lead as medicine, refining into treasure to extend life. Cinnabar is the one point of empty spirit qi in Li, that is numinous wisdom, belonging to human heart; black lead is the one point of firm upright qi in Kan, that is true knowledge, belonging to dao heart. Because human heart’s numinous wisdom is bright outside and dark inside, bright is fire, fire’s color red, symbolized as cinnabar; because dao heart’s true knowledge is dark outside and bright inside, dark is water, water’s color black, symbolized as black lead. These are formless and imageless sand and lead, not the worldly tangible sand and lead. Knowing true knowledge and numinous wisdom as sand and lead, one can pick at will without difficulty. But picking must be refined; if knowing medicine but not refining method, it is the same as ignorance. Thus it is said though you know cinnabar and black lead, if you do not know fire timing, it is idle. The Golden Elixir depends entirely on fire timing and cultivation. Fire is cultivation’s power; timing is cultivation’s order. Picking medicine must know old and young; refining medicine must know season. There is literary cooking fire timing, martial refining fire timing, starting fire timing, stopping fire timing, advancing yang fire timing, retreating yin fire timing, returning elixir fire timing, great elixir fire timing, increasing and decreasing fire timing, nurturing fire timing. Many fire timings require great enlightenment, knowing beginning and end, then success is possible. If off by a hair, lost by a thousand miles, how can elixir form?

**Twenty-eight**

The Secret Treatise and Scriptures teach the utmost truth,  
Not putting fire timing into words.  
To know the formula’s profound place,  
One must discuss carefully with spirits and immortals.

Since ancient times, immortals and sages, in secret treatises and scriptures, speak of cultivation medicines and fire timing most detailed and precise, utmost true and not false. Though they speak, they cannot fully explain; though they say, they cannot exhaust. How could they not put fire timing into words? But secret treatises and scriptures are deep and obscure; sometimes speaking of nature, sometimes life, sometimes medicine, sometimes fire, sometimes cultivating life fire timing, sometimes cultivating nature fire timing, sometimes outer fire timing, sometimes inner fire timing—not that they do not speak of fire timing. But their words are scattered and unorganized; without a clear master to organize and outline, one cannot understand. Thus it is said not putting fire timing into words. Also said one must discuss carefully with spirits and immortals. This teaches people to study secret treatises and scriptures and seek masters to verify; not to discard secret treatises and scriptures and only seek masters; nor to take secret treatises and scriptures as self-enlightenment and not seek masters. If secret treatises and scriptures had no fire timing, how could they be called teaching the utmost truth? Generally, students must read secret treatises and scriptures and seek masters. Reading secret treatises and scriptures can distinguish right and wrong, true and false, expand knowledge, and seek masters to verify the reason seen and understood. Both self-study and masters are indispensable.

### On Picking Medicine and Fire Timing:

**Twenty-nine**

On the fifteenth day of the eighth month playing with toadlight,  
Is the time when golden essence is strongest.  
When the one yang just moves,  
Quickly advance fire without delay.

The “just moving” (one text says “just rising”)

At mid-autumn, golden essence is strong, dao reaches firm central uprightness, nature perfectly bright. The power of perfect brightness lies in the dao heart. The one yang just moving is the dao heart’s one point of true knowledge’s yang light, just moving but not fully moving, the heavenly root just revealing a trace. At this time, urgently advance fire, pick into the creation furnace, gradually pick and refine, from subtle to manifest; from one yang to six yang pure and complete, like the mid-autumn moon, extra bright, illuminating the universe. “Do not delay” are urgent words; the dao heart’s true knowledge light is rare and easily lost; if delayed, light and qi scatter, missed face to face.

### On Withdrawing and Adding Fire Timing:

**Thirtieth**

When one yang just moves to form the elixir,  
The lead cauldron gently shines behind the curtain.  
At the start of receiving qi it is easy to obtain,  
Withdrawing and adding must carefully prevent danger.

This poem follows the last. One yang just moves, gathered inside the cauldron, heart calm and qi peaceful, empty chamber produces white, brilliance gathers inside, darkness produces brightness, like shining behind curtains. Cui Gong said: “Receiving qi is auspicious; beware of becoming inauspicious.” The one yang’s return is easy, but perfect completion is hardest; must guard against danger and risk, using withdrawing and adding to assist. Withdraw means reduce excess human heart’s numinous wisdom; add means increase insufficient dao heart’s true knowledge; withdraw and add repeatedly until nothing more to withdraw or add; human heart does not arise, dao heart remains; true knowledge and numinous wisdom unite, inside and outside bright; no midnight wind and thunder trouble. At dao heart’s first return, yang qi is weak, yin qi strong; without withdrawing and adding, slight laxity causes gain and loss. Thus withdrawing and adding is precious, the work of guarding against danger; not apart from withdrawing and adding, Lu Wei is in withdrawing and adding; both one thing—students must focus.

### On Nurturing Fire Timing:

**Thirty-first**

The mysterious pearl’s image follows yang’s birth,  
Yang peaks and yin fades, gradually peeling form.  
After ten months frost flies and elixir ripens,  
At this time gods and ghosts must be startled.

The “mysterious pearl” is the utmost yang pearl, perfectly bright and undimmed, another name for the Golden Elixir, the original good knowledge and good ability’s nature. This nature is quiet and unmoving, responding and communicating, like the mysterious pearl. This pearl is the dao heart’s one point of firm true knowledge, formed by gathering meaning; born and reborn, vast qi fills, brilliance complete, yang at its peak. When yang peaks, yin must connect; yin fades and peels form, using yin to nurture yang, removing yang’s dryness; gradual peeling must use ten months’ work. Ten months nurturing, mining out pure gold, transforming to spiritual frost, true void containing wondrous existence, wondrous existence containing true void, unaware and unknown, following Heaven’s law, like frost flying, colorless, not falling into existence or nonexistence, and the elixir ripens. At this position, creation cannot bind, myriad things cannot move; work accomplished among humans, recorded in Heaven; how could gods and ghosts not be startled?

### On Forming the Embryo Fire Timing:

**Thirty-second**

After the front string and before the back string,  
The medicine’s flavor is even and the qi image complete.  
Gathered and returned into the furnace to refine,  
Nurtured and warmed, naturally cooking and simmering.

The front string is yang within yin, true knowledge returning to central uprightness; the back string is yin within yang, numinous wisdom returning to central uprightness. True knowledge and numinous wisdom both return to central uprightness, firm and soft balanced; their balanced place is called after the front string and before the back string. At this time, true knowledge and numinous wisdom, neither too big nor too small, both kingdoms intact; within this arises one primordial spirit seed, medicine flavor even, yin and yang mixed; urgently take it, gather into the creation furnace, refine and select true, form the sacred embryo. At this stage, medicine is fire, fire is medicine; using ten months’ nurturing work, natural true fire cooks and simmers, from subtle to manifest, formless to form.

### On Yin and Yang Returning to the Center:

**Thirty-third**

The eldest son just drinks western wine,  
The young girl just opens northern flowers.  
If the blue maiden meets after,  
In an instant lock her in the Yellow Home.

The eldest son is Zhen. Western wine is metal water. On the third day of the month appears the Geng direction, under yin, one yang born, in hexagram Zhen, thus “eldest son just drinks western wine.” The young girl is Dui. Northern flowers are golden flowers born in water. Moonlight is born from Dui to Kun, yin within yang appears, thus “young girl just opens northern flowers.” Both lines describe the image of one yang arising. “Just drinks” means never drank before, now suddenly drinks; “just opens” means last time almost opened, now fully opens. “Just drinks” and “just opens” both write the dao heart’s true knowledge’s ease of loss and difficulty of finding. The dao heart buried long, true knowledge dim, suddenly found in utmost stillness, like first drinking wine or first opening flowers. This is the turning point, a good night not to miss, must seize the moment, match with numinous wisdom, lock in the central Yellow Court chamber, husband and wife meet, naturally elixir is born. Numinous wisdom is nature, yin within yang, belonging to wood, wood is blue, thus numinous wisdom symbolized as blue maiden. True knowledge and numinous wisdom meet, united as one qi, naturally returning to center. But once returned, if not locked, fear of union then separation. Lock and seal tightly, doors firmly closed; those not to unite must unite; those united must always unite. Zhang Sanfeng said: “East house girl, west house man, matched as husband and wife entering bridal chamber; Yellow Granny urges drinking nectar, one day lifts veil for a drunken bout.” The words lock and seal have the function of guarding against danger, because yin and yang first meet, nature and feeling still not pure, must not forget or assist, strictly guard, so no seepage or leakage, Golden Elixir condenses from emptiness. This is Heaven’s secret, not known to unworthy masters.

### On Bathing:

**Thirty-fourth**

In the rabbit and rooster months and times,  
The medicine image of punishment meets the gate.  
At this stage the Golden Elixir should be bathed,  
If fire is added again it will surely topple and endanger.

Golden Elixir (one text says golden sand)

Rabbit month is spring equinox, yang qi rises in Heaven and Earth; rooster month is autumn equinox, yin qi rises in Heaven and Earth. Spring equinox belongs to wood, life qi, virtue; autumn equinox belongs to metal, killing qi, punishment. Virtue gives birth to things; punishment perfects things. Without punishment there is no virtue; without virtue punishment is incomplete. Punishment and virtue together allow Heaven and Earth’s creation to flow as one qi, cycling endlessly. Cultivators must know true firmness returns to central uprightness, like autumn equinox; numinous wisdom softness returns to central uprightness, like spring equinox; true knowledge and numinous wisdom both return to central uprightness, like spring virtue and autumn punishment. True knowledge’s firmness controls human heart’s evil qi; numinous wisdom’s softness nurtures dao heart’s righteous qi. When firmness is needed, be firm; when softness is needed, be soft; not missing the time, firmness and softness are balanced, like spring equinox and autumn equinox, each has its time. Thus “rabbit and rooster months and times.” Firm within soft, soft within firm, firm and soft as one, true numinous nature does not scatter; like spring virtue and autumn punishment, alternating operation. When the dao reaches firm softness central uprightness, the dao heart remains constant, human heart utterly still; true knowledge reaches numinous wisdom, numinous wisdom reaches true knowledge; true numinous nature unites, good knowledge and good ability; Golden Elixir has form and can be bathed and nurtured, and the stove’s bottom firewood removed. Otherwise, not knowing when to stop, still adding fire to refine, firmness too much and excessive, softness insufficient, firmness and softness still not central upright, medicine dries and elixir harmed, topples and endangers—how to avoid?

### On Literary Cooking and Martial Refining:

**Thirty-fifth**

Sun and moon meet every thirty days,  
Changing day by day with method and spirit power.  
Guarding city and fighting field know good and bad,  
Increasing numinous sand fills the cauldron red.

The moon has no light, borrowing the sun to shine. One year meets the sun twelve times; one month has thirty days; between new and full moon one meeting. Human true knowledge buried, pure yin without yang, like moon without light, must borrow numinous wisdom to produce light. When numinous wisdom and true knowledge meet, like sun and moon meeting every thirty days. The perfected imitates sun and moon meeting, moving thirty days into one day, and one day into one hour. In one hour, firm qi arises, borrowing human heart to generate dao heart, using dao heart to control human heart; depending on numinous wisdom to generate true knowledge, using true knowledge to expel numinous wisdom. Picking the primordial qi at the end of chaos as elixir mother, following yin-yang changes’ divine mechanism as fire timing. This Way has literary cooking and martial refining. Guarding city is literary cooking; fighting field is martial refining. When to use literary, use literary; when to use martial, use martial; for good fortune; using literary as martial or martial as literary is misfortune. Literary fire is returning light and destroying cleverness, focusing and nurturing righteous qi, like guarding a city. Martial fire is punishing anger and stopping desire, removing delusion and preserving sincerity, fiercely removing guest qi, like fighting in the field. Knowing literary and martial, understanding good and bad, using martial fire when needed, literary fire when none; literary and martial fire, yin qi exhausted and yang qi pure, true knowledge and numinous wisdom unite, transforming to good knowledge and good ability, wondrous awakening original nature; round and bright, shining brightly, pure and bare, red and brilliant; quiet and unmoving, responding and communicating, responding and communicating, quiet and unmoving, perfectly Heaven’s principle, no human desire. Like numinous sand filling the cauldron red. Sand reaching numinous, qi and nature all transformed, neither color nor emptiness, neither existence nor nonexistence, pure clear yang qi; taking it can cure disease and prolong life, dispel disaster and avoid calamity, restore original nature, empty spirit undimmed, true void wondrous existence, creation cannot limit, yin and yang cannot bind, myriad things cannot harm; just so. Yet in the world many know good and bad but do not truly apply spirit power.

### On Hexagram Meaning, Two Poems:

**Thirty-six**

Pi and Tai just meet, myriad things fill,  
Tun and Meng two hexagrams receive creation.  
Within this meaning do not seek images,  
If you examine all lines, you only serve emotions.

Qian above and Kun below ( ), Heaven’s qi descends from above, Earth’s qi rises from below; yin and yang do not cross, this is Pi. Kun above and Qian below ( ), Earth’s qi descends from above, Heaven’s qi rises from below; yin and yang cross, this is Tai. Extreme Pi leads to Tai, yin and yang just meet, myriad things arise and fill the universe. Tun is ( ) Kan above Zhen below, water with thunder, yin within yang, dispersing yin to birth things. Meng is ( ) Gen above Kan below, mountain over water, yang trapped within yin, nurturing yang to form things. Pi and Tai are the world’s blockage and flow; Tun and Meng are the world’s creation. Blockage and flow, creation and growth, all come from yin and yang’s coming and going. Yin and yang come and go, myriad things block and flow and create, all naturally, no force. The Way of cultivation, firmness and softness not united is Pi; firmness and softness united is Tai. When firm, advance firm to cultivate truth, this is Tun; when soft, move soft to nurture truth, this is Meng. Knowing blockage and flow, able to cultivate and nurture, firmness and softness used by time, changing into sixty-four hexagrams, all within our mind.

Generally, hexagram images arise from form and shape; understanding meaning lets you forget images. If you do not know the hexagram’s meaning, only hold its image, you will want one, two, three yang to act as Tai; want one, two, three yin to oppose Pi. Producing three yang to act Tai is close to reason; producing three yin to oppose Pi is difficult. There are those who say at the child hour, yang qi moves in Kan and guards kidney, called morning Tun; at noon hour, yang qi limited and stops, guards heart, called evening Meng. Alas! By this to say Pi, Tai, Tun, Meng—how can sixty-four hexagrams and all lines be fully matched? If examining all lines to match them, is it not laboring emotions? The ancient immortal said: “No need to seek child and noon at Heaven’s edge; within oneself is a yang born.” This can prove the wise among hexagram practitioners; students must think thrice.

**Thirty-seven**

Within hexagrams images are original form,  
Understanding meaning forgets words and meaning is clear.  
The world’s confused only hold images,  
Yet act by hexagram qi hoping to ascend.

Obtain image (one text says obtain meaning); hold image (one text says muddy image)

The sixty-four hexagrams of the Zhou Yi, three hundred eighty-four lines, only clarify yin and yang’s form and shape, central and off-center images. If one obtains the meaning of yin and yang’s central and off-center, one can harmonize yin and yang and naturally match hexagram images. Alas, the world’s confused do not seek meaning but hold images, wanting to act Tun in morning and Meng in evening, starting with Tun and Meng and ending with Ji and Wei, acting by hexagram qi hoping to become dao and ascend, foolish indeed.

Little do they know, ancient immortals said Tun and Meng mean knowing yang born is Tun, yang trapped is Meng. Yang born is like morning; yang trapped is like evening. When yang is born, advance yang fire to pick yang, called morning Tun; when yang is trapped, use yin talisman to nurture yang, called evening Meng. Ji and Wei mean yin and yang united is Ji; yin and yang not united is Wei. Yin and yang united, Golden Elixir condenses, yang fire’s work done; Ji must guard against Wei, yin talisman’s work must be used. Yin and yang not united, Golden Elixir not formed, yin talisman useless; Wei must hasten Ji, yang fire’s work must be done. This is the meaning hidden in these four hexagrams; extending to the other sixty, all are yin and yang’s changes. Thus it is said obtain meaning forget words and meaning is clear. If one understands hexagram images’ meaning, Heaven’s gate is in hand, Earth’s axis by heart, walking with confidence, all is dao; no need to hold hexagram images and match them. Ah! Golden toad, jade old crow, those who recognize truly are makers.

### On Geng and Jia:

**Thirty-eight**

Heaven and Earth’s fullness and emptiness have their time,  
Only by discerning their waxing and waning can one know the mechanism.  
Since ancient times Geng and Jia clarify the order,  
Killing all three corpses, the Way can be expected.

Heaven and Earth’s Way is the Way of fullness and emptiness. Fullness extreme then emptiness; emptiness extreme then fullness; all has its time. Cultivators who can discern fullness and emptiness’s true principle, and can conquer and dissipate yin, nurture and grow yang, are said to know the mechanism of waxing and waning. To conquer and dissipate yin is emptiness’s mechanism; to nurture and grow yang is fullness’s mechanism. Yet conquering and nurturing never leave true knowledge’s feeling and numinous wisdom’s nature. True knowledge’s feeling is firm, belonging to Geng metal; numinous wisdom’s nature is soft, belonging to Jia wood. Firmness controls outside, subduing guest qi; softness dwells inside, quietly nurturing heavenly innocence. Using both firm and soft, inside and outside, is Geng and Jia clarifying the order. When order is clear, firmness and softness appropriate, waxing and waning by time, righteous qi conquers and evil qi transforms; no thought arises, no external things enter; no eyes, ears, mouth, tongue, body, mind; no color, sound, smell, taste, touch, dharma; pure and bare, bright and shining—this is killing all three corpses. Killing all three corpses, myriad yin all transform, the Great Way can be hoped for. This poem’s emphasis is on discerning waxing and waning to know the mechanism. Discerning means thoroughly examining, deeply penetrating, with deep功夫 over time, then can see truth. Seeing truth, skillful and ready, then can wax and wane. Waxing and waning is knowing the mechanism; if not waxing and waning, then not knowing mechanism. Not knowing mechanism means principle not thoroughly understood; how to clarify order and kill three corpses? Thus right heart and sincere intention’s study depends on investigating things and extending knowledge.

### On the Primordial Female, Two Poems:

**Thirty-nine**

To obtain the valley spirit’s long life,  
One must rely on the mysterious female to establish the root.  
True essence returns to the golden chamber,  
One point of spiritual light never departs.

The valley spirit is the primordial emptiness and one qi, called the sacred embryo. This qi is neither form nor emptiness; both form and emptiness; in the dim and obscure, unseen and unheard, ungraspable; it is the boundary of dao heart and human heart, root of true knowledge and numinous wisdom, basis of firm feeling and soft nature, giving birth to Heaven, Earth, and humans. Confucians call it “Great Ultimate,” also “Supreme Good,” also “Supreme Sincerity.” Buddhists call it “Perfect Awakening,” also “Dharma Body,” also “Tathāgata.” Daoists call it “Golden Elixir,” also “Sacred Embryo,” also “Valley Spirit.” Actually it is human original good knowledge and good ability, the spirit manifesting in the empty valley. This valley spirit, fallen into postnatal, yin and yang separated, false acting, true retreating, buried and seemingly dead.

To cultivate the Golden Elixir, one must revive this valley spirit; to revive the valley spirit, first harmonize yin and yang; if yin and yang do not harmonize, valley spirit does not condense. Yuan is yang, firm vigor; female is yin, gentle compliance. Having firmness and softness, the valley spirit lives long, the root of immortality established. The valley spirit is firm softness central uprightness, two string qi combined. Two strings combined, dim and obscure, within is something, called true one’s essence. True one’s essence is another name for valley spirit. Unrefined, it flickers; refined, condensed and unscattered, called valley spirit. When true essence returns to golden chamber, essence returns to center, valley spirit condenses. Valley spirit condensed, dao heart remains constant, human heart tamed, true knowledge and numinous wisdom united; good knowledge and good ability, perfectly Heaven’s principle, quiet and unmoving, responding and communicating; responding and communicating, quiet and unmoving, always responding and always still, one point of spiritual light never departs. Spiritual light never departing is valley spirit’s long life. Valley spirit’s undying means the Immortal Elder’s saying: “Swallowing one Golden Elixir into the belly, then knowing my life is not by Heaven.” Valley spirit, true essence, spiritual light, still one thing; only distinguished as formed or unformed, not three things—students must know.

**Fortieth**

The gate of the mysterious female is rarely known,  
Only mistaking mouth and nose for it.  
Though you breathe for thousands of years,  
How can you grasp the golden crow and seize the rabbit?

Many years (one text says thousands of years)

Laozi said: “The valley spirit does not die; this is called the primordial female.” The gate of the primordial female is the root of Heaven and Earth. Yuan means Qian yang, firm virtue; female means Kun yin, gentle virtue. Yang moves, yin rests; the valley spirit’s movement and stillness is the gate of the primordial female. This gate births Heaven, Earth, and all beings; from nothing contains all being, from void contains all substance; within are the Five Phases’ qi but no Five Phases’ substance; hidden in the Five Phases but not belonging to them. To be sage or saint, Buddha or immortal, all arise from this. This is not something else, but our original non-form non-emptiness, holding the eternal good. Only because mingling with postnatal, consciousness spirit acting, buried and unseen. If meeting a true master to point it out, one knows the homeland is present, not from others; one seed is born, from subtle to manifest, naturally maturing. The Immortal Elder said: “You must plant seeds in your homeland.” All other side doors and external ways, seeking outside the body, can awaken and return.

### On Nature and Feeling:

**Forty-first**

Different names but same origin, few know,  
Both profound and mysterious, the essential mechanism.  
Protect life, fully sharpen brightness and loss,  
Purple-gold elixir is most wondrous and miraculous.

The Golden Elixir Way is only one firmness and one softness, two medicines, nothing else. Firmness belongs to true knowledge’s feeling; softness belongs to numinous wisdom’s nature. One nature and one feeling, though named differently, both arise from primordial emptiness and true one qi. True one qi is the valley spirit mentioned before; nature and feeling are the primordial female mentioned before. The primordial female is the essential mechanism of the undying valley spirit. The primordial natural Way gives birth to valley spirit and primordial female; the postnatal return Way makes primordial female become valley spirit. Without union of primordial female, valley spirit does not condense. The primordial female is the essential mechanism because it condenses valley spirit. When primordial female is established, valley spirit condenses, can protect life, fully sharpen, more clearly show the benefit of advancing yang and harm of retreating yin. Benefit yang until nothing more to benefit; reduce yin until nothing more to reduce. Yin exhausted and yang pure, valley spirit lives long, perfectly one qi, no dregs, round and bright, shining, pure and bare, red and brilliant, creation cannot bind, myriad things cannot harm. Like fire timing refining purple-gold elixir, raising the dead and returning life, most wondrous and miraculous.

### On Action:

**Forty-second**

Beginning with action, people rarely see,  
Until reaching non-action, all begin to know.  
Only seeing non-action as the essential wonder,  
Who knows action is the root and foundation?

The ancient truth says “Nature and life must be cultivated together,功夫 must be in two stages.” The Golden Elixir Way has one Way of cultivating life, one Way of cultivating nature. The Way of cultivating life is action; the Way of cultivating nature is non-action. The Way of action is using technique to extend life; the Way of non-action is using the dao to perfect nature. Beginning with action, there is action to create life. The study of creating life is all by method and law. The primordial qi before chaos twists Heaven and Earth’s creation pivot, returns the twenty-four qi’s nodes, cycles the seventy-two seasons’ essential Way. Heaven and Earth cannot know, ghosts and spirits cannot measure, yarrow and tortoise cannot divine. Though Heaven, Earth, ghosts, spirits, yarrow, and tortoise cannot know, how could humans know? Finally non-action is used, using non-action to cultivate nature. The Way of cultivating nature is embracing origin and guarding unity; all things are empty, like a hen embracing eggs, like a clam holding a pearl. When功夫 reaches the day, utmost sincerity foreknowing, wisdom heart opens wide, voice enters heart and connects, good and bad foreknown, fortune and misfortune predicted, who does not know? But people only know non-action Way as the essential wonder, not knowing action Way is root and foundation. Not knowing action and only knowing non-action, not only cannot cultivate life but also cannot cultivate nature. Even if cultivating, it is only cultivating postnatal qi and nature, how can one cultivate primordial root nature? The root nature is Heaven’s life nature. Originally nature and life are one family, no two strings; because mingling with postnatal, yin and yang separate, one becomes two; nature and life separate. Nature and life separate, nature cannot care for life, life cannot care for nature. Life is robbed by things, cannot control itself; nature is thus disturbed. Nature disturbed and life shaken, evil and right mixed, reason and desire mingled, false acting, true retreating, day after day, year after year, yin qi stripping yang to the end, nature and life inevitably destroyed. Thus the Golden Elixir Way must first act in postnatal to return to primordial, restore original life treasure. When life treasure is in hand, mastery is mine, not moved by creation. Then embrace origin and guard unity, follow non-action Way, understand true void original nature, fitting the highest supreme Way. Alas! All stubborn emptiness and silence followers only know non-action, not knowing action—why?

### On Male and Female:

**Forty-third**

Within black is white, the elixir mother,  
Within male hides female, the sacred embryo.  
Taiyi guards the furnace,  
Three fields of treasure gather at three platforms.

Within black is white means the dao heart’s true knowledge, firm and upright dao, thus called elixir mother. Male contains female means the human heart’s original numinous wisdom, gentle and upright virtue, thus called sacred embryo. Firm and soft united, yang and yin one qi, human heart transforms to dao heart, numinous wisdom returns to true knowledge—this is called Taiyi containing true qi. Taiyi is the spirit of yin-yang mixed and unified, another name for the Golden Elixir. Taking this Taiyi true qi into the creation furnace, warming and nurturing it, carefully sealing and guarding so it is not lost, then essence, qi, and spirit are complete; three fields gather treasure, like three platforms assisting the pole star, creation in hand. The three fields of Guanyuan, Yellow Court, and Niwan are not the elixir field, crimson palace, or heavenly valley; nor the tail bone, spine, or jade pillow; but the three formless, imageless places where primordial essence, qi, and spirit’s great medicines arise. Because they are born of essence, qi, and spirit, they are called fields; because essence, qi, and spirit are three, they are called three fields. Actually, three fields are one field, three treasures one treasure. Because there are three layers of功夫—refining essence to qi, refining qi to spirit, refining spirit to void—they are spoken of as three fields. When refining spirit to void, only one void remains; essence, qi, and spirit return to no trace; what need is there for three fields?

### On Being and Non-being:

**Forty-four**

In the dim and obscure seek images,  
In the deep silence seek true essence.  
Being and non-being enter each other,  
Without seeing, how can one imagine success?

Dim and obscure is neither form nor emptiness, an uncertain image; deep silence is utmost stillness, unseen place. In dimness is image, numinous wisdom; in silence is true essence, true knowledge. Numinous wisdom is outer yang and inner yin, being within non-being; true knowledge is outer yin and inner yang, non-being within being. Cultivators wishing to form the Golden Elixir must seek numinous wisdom in dimness, true knowledge in silence. If one can understand and awaken, recognizing truth, this means having seen. Having seen, use true knowledge to control numinous wisdom, use numinous wisdom to nurture true knowledge, then being and non-being mutually embrace and respond, Golden Elixir is formed. Otherwise, not knowing images in dimness and essence in silence means not seeing what the Golden Elixir medicine is, yet imagining forming elixir—how can it succeed?

### On Taking the Elixir:

**Forty-five**

When four images meet, the mysterious body is formed,  
When Five Phases are complete, purple gold shines.  
After escaping the womb and entering the mouth, the body becomes sage,  
Infinite dragons and spirits all lose their fear.

Purple gold (one text says purple light)

The Golden Elixir Way is all about clustering Five Phases, harmonizing four images. When four images meet, nature, feeling, and spirit unite, primordial body is formed, able to truly hold the mean. Using Heaven’s true fire to refine, this is called Five Phases complete. When Five Phases are complete, benevolence, righteousness, propriety, and wisdom all return to one faith; nature, feeling, essence, and spirit all transform to one qi. Firm and compliant mixed, firm and soft without trace, true knowledge and numinous wisdom transform to good knowledge and good ability, utmost good without evil, perfectly Heaven’s principle, perfectly clear and unobstructed, empty spirit undimmed, possessing myriad principles and responding to myriad affairs, like gold refined to purple gold, shining brightly outward. Swallowing and taking it, all postnatal myriad yin vanish, revealing primordial dharma body, entering sage’s foundation, my life is mine not Heaven’s; how could dragons and spirits not be startled? The meaning of entering the mouth is sudden enlightenment, not swallowing food. Primordial qi, refined and matured, suddenly from gradual to sudden, from bright to sincere, like elixir entering the mouth, all diseases vanish, body can become sage. Students must understand the meaning beyond words, not be stuck on words and images. If taking “entering the mouth” as swallowing food, truly think primordial qi, formless and imageless, what is swallowed? What is taken? Here one can understand.

**Forty-six**

After the Huachi feast, the moon’s clear light,  
Riding the golden dragon to visit Purple Tenuity.  
From this all immortals meet,  
Sea tides and mountain valleys may shift at will.

Huachi feast means taking Kan’s true yang, entering the creation furnace, dao heart stabilizes and fills the belly. Moon’s clear light means dao heart remains constant, true knowledge’s wisdom light bright and clear, neither hidden nor concealed. Riding the golden dragon means Qian is metal, the dragon. Taking Kan’s dao heart, one yang of true knowledge, filling Li’s human heart’s numinous wisdom one yin, numinous wisdom also transforms to true knowledge, Li returns to Qian, original face fully revealed, perfectly Heaven’s principle, round and bright, shining, pure yang without yin. Visiting Purple Tenuity means the Great Emperor of the Purple Tenuity, lord of creation, pivot of the stars. Cultivating dao to return to Qian body, mastery in hand, Heaven’s gate in hand, Earth’s axis by heart, creation cannot bind, myriad things cannot move; visiting Purple Tenuity and becoming Heaven’s companion,功夫 accomplished among humans, name recorded in Heaven. From this all immortals meet, no matter sea tides or mountain valleys shifting, the dharma body remains forever unbroken.

### On the Elixir Forming Within:

**Forty-seven**

To know the Golden Liquid returning elixir method,  
One must plant seeds in the homeland.  
No need for blowing or fanning or effort,  
Naturally the elixir ripens and sheds the true embryo.

The method of Golden Liquid returning elixir, great medicine is near not far;功夫 simple and not complex; homeland has medicine, can plant anytime, no need outside furnace or cauldron or blowing or moving fire, naturally matures and liberates.

The elixir is the primordial emptiness and true one qi, the spirit root from chaos’s first division, ancestor qi of living things, containing true void, manifesting wondrous existence, used as dao heart, nourished as valley spirit; from nothing containing all being, from void containing all substance, within are Five Phases’ qi but no Five Phases’ substance; hidden in Five Phases but not belonging to them. To be sage or saint, Buddha or immortal, all from this. This is not something else, but our original non-form non-emptiness, holding the eternal good. Only because mingling with postnatal, consciousness spirit acting, buried and unseen. If meeting true master to point it out, one knows homeland is present, not from others; one seed born, from subtle to manifest, naturally maturing. Immortal Elder said: “You must plant seeds in your homeland.” All other side doors and external ways seeking outside can awaken and return.

### On Medicine Coming from Outside:

**Forty-eight**

Do not use cleverness and deceit as功夫,  
Recognize the other family’s immortal method.  
Within the pot quickly add life-extending wine,  
Within the cauldron gather soul-returning syrup.

The last poem spoke of planting seeds in the homeland; fearing people cling to the body alone, this poem immediately says: “Do not use cleverness and deceit as功夫, recognize the other family’s immortal method.” The homeland planting seeds means the Golden Elixir medicine, neither increased by sage nor decreased by ordinary, everyone has it, each perfectly complete, no need to seek elsewhere, homeland has it. The other family’s immortal method means primordial qi mingled with postnatal, consciousness spirit acting, yang is yin trapped, like our home’s things but belonging to others. To return to origin and source, must use gathering method, so primordial true yang, once lost, complex; once returned, still our own. Because there is future and past, there is other family and our home difference. Thus at future time, must tread solid ground, gradually pick and refine, quickly add and gather, to carry out action功夫. Though called action, it is really non-action. Action means stealing yin and yang, seizing creation, not other trickery, all natural use. Quickly add life-extending wine means increase dao heart’s true knowledge to strengthen life; gather soul-returning syrup means reduce human heart’s numinous wisdom to nurture nature. Life-extending wine is metal juice; soul-returning syrup is wood liquid. Adding metal, gathering metal and wood together, feeling and nature united, true knowledge and numinous wisdom condense, elixir embryo has form. Quickly add and gather have deep meaning; yin and yang scattered long ago; if not quickly add and gather, gradually advancing, metal and wood cannot unite, nature and feeling cannot harmonize. Only by quickly adding and gathering, day and night vigilance, not forgetting nor assisting, with time and功夫, metal and wood naturally unite, nature and feeling naturally harmonize, then can extend life, return soul, and enter the land of longevity and immortality.

### On Inner and Outer Elixirs:

**Forty-nine**

Snow mountain’s one essence is good nectar,  
Pour into the eastern wood creation furnace.  
If it goes beyond Kunlun northwest,  
Zhang Qian will first see Magu.

Snow mountain is in the west, representing metal, symbolizing primordial feeling; nectar is water, symbolizing primordial essence; eastern sun is wood, symbolizing primordial nature; creation furnace is fire, symbolizing primordial spirit. Taking primordial feeling and essence of metal and water, pouring into primordial nature and spirit of wood and fire. Using wood and fire to refine metal and water; using metal and water to control wood and fire. Punishment forms virtue; virtue perfects punishment. Punishment and virtue both used, metal and wood unite, water and fire aid, four great elements harmonize and elixir returns. This is elixir’s symbolic meaning. Kunlun mountain is in the northwest of Heaven and Earth, ancestral mountain vein, compared to primordial true one qi, ancestor qi of living things. Northwest belongs to Qian, the highest place on Earth; high means yang. Zhang Qian is yang; Magu is yin. When returning elixir is formed, transforming to true one qi, from subtle to manifest, yang qi sufficient, great medicine arises, perfectly Heaven’s principle, firm and upright, releasing one point of utmost yang elixir. Using this elixir to point the postnatal yin of the body, like a cat catching a mouse, false yin transforms and true yin appears, yin and yang blend, forming the sacred embryo. Thus it is said if it goes beyond Kunlun northwest, Zhang Qian first sees Magu. The phrase “first sees” implies功夫 levels. This returning elixir is not yet at yang peak; Zhang Qian not yet allowed to see Magu. When nurtured to yang peak, Zhang Qian first sees Magu. True yin and true yang meet; dao heart and human heart both transform to good heart; true knowledge and numinous wisdom all change to good knowledge; a millet grain pearl suspended in emptiness, neither form nor emptiness, illuminating the three thousand great thousand worlds, no obstruction—this is inner elixir’s symbolism. Outer elixir is lost and regained, from outside returning inside; returning elixir is formed and refined away yin qi, from inside manifesting true white; great elixir is formed. Outer elixir formed, inner elixir accomplished,功夫 complete and fame achieved, roaming the land of no-thing.

### On Yang Essence:

**Fiftieth**

Not knowing yang essence and host and guest,  
How can you know which is close or distant?  
The room is empty and closed at the tailbone orifice,  
Mistakenly killing countless people of Jambudvipa!

Yuan Duzi said: “One point of yang essence, secret in the shape mountain, not in heart or kidney, but in the one orifice of the primordial gate. Yang essence is utmost yang and utmost essence, without a trace of yin turbid qi. It is the original firm upright, pure essence, hidden as true void, manifesting wondrous existence, called holding the eternal good heart, also called dao heart; not comparable to postnatal utmost yin and turbid essence. Yang essence in the body governs creation, yet eliminates all evil. The ancients named it true one’s essence, also true one’s water, also true qi; actually all are dao heart’s yang essence. Yang essence is born before Heaven and Earth, is the host; yin essence is born after Heaven and Earth, is the guest. Host is close to me; guest is distant. Mistaking yin essence for yang essence, practicing bedroom arts, closing the tailbone, restraining yin essence, falsely imagining forming elixir—how can it succeed? Though yang essence is obtained in the bedroom, it is not the room of the house, but the room of the body. As the Immortal Elder said, every home has it, the home is round seed, same meaning; how could it be the room of the house? Students wanting to know yang essence must first find the primordial gate. Knowing the primordial gate, yang essence is there.”

### On Returning to Origin:

**Fifty-first**

All myriad things each return to root,  
Returning to root and restoring life means long life.  
Knowing to always return to self is hard to understand,  
Deluded action invites disaster, often heard.

All things spring in spring, grow in summer, gather in autumn, store in winter—this is the constant Way. Growing and gathering is returning to root. Returning to root is restoring life. Restoring life is restoring Heaven’s life qi. Life qi is returning; from root again arising, thus able to always exist and not die. If one can know myriad things’ constant Heaven’s mechanism and return root and restore life, then also always exist and become immortal.

But knowing always to return to origin is deep principle, subtle功夫; there is old and young medicine, urgent and slow fire timing, inner medicine, outer medicine; inner fire timing, outer fire timing; literary fire timing, martial fire timing; picking medicine fire timing, refining fire timing; forming elixir fire timing, liberating elixir fire timing; cultivating life fire timing, cultivating nature fire timing. These layers require true master’s one-by-one transmission to carry out. Otherwise, not seeking others, relying on one’s own cleverness and opinion, guessing and imagining, thinking one understands, rashly acting. Not knowing a hair’s difference is a thousand miles off, deluded action invites disaster, principle is clear!

### On the Wisdom Sword:

**Fifty-two**

Ou Ye personally passed down sword forging method,  
Mo Xie’s metal and water match softness and firmness.  
Once forged, it knows human intent,  
Ten thousand miles to slay demons in a flash.

The sword is a protective weapon, the wisdom tool for becoming Buddha or immortal, the handle for sage and saint—this is the so-called returning elixir. Not other than returning elixir is another sword. Returning elixir means returning original good knowledge and good ability, firm and soft united true numinous nature. Forging the sword is forging this good knowledge and good ability, firm and soft united wisdom tool. As body it is called elixir; as function it is called sword. Actually sword and elixir are one, not two. Anciently Ou Ye forged swords many times without success; his wife Mo Xie jumped into the furnace; one fire succeeded. The Mo Xie sword is said to be sharp beyond compare. The Way of cultivation forges sword first, taking firm and soft central upright qi, using water and fire to refine into treasure, named wisdom sword, worn by the side, used at will, ten thousand miles slaying demons in a flash. The Immortal Elder uses Ou Ye and Mo Xie to illustrate firm and soft united meaning, very profound. Cultivators must know firm and soft both must return to central uprightness to transform postnatal yin. If firm when soft is needed, or soft when firm is needed, or firm too rash, or soft too weak, not central or upright, forging sword fails. Forging sword fails, no handle inside, step by step blocked—how to complete the Great Way? But forging sword method is not easy to know; firm and soft matching hardest to understand. Without meeting true master’s personal oral transmission, all guesses are vain.

### On Harmonizing Nature and Feeling:

**Fifty-three**

Strike bamboo to call the turtle to swallow jade fungus,  
Play the zither to summon the phoenix to drink knife and jade tablet.  
Recently through and through golden light appears,  
Not to speak these rules with ordinary people.

Bamboo is hollow hearted; striking it responds. The zither is soundful; tuning it harmonizes. Turtle nurtures qi; phoenix is civilization. Jade fungus is tender longevity; knife and jade tablet are pure and unmixed. Turtle, knife, and jade tablet belong to yang; phoenix, jade, and fungus belong to yin. The Golden Elixir Way is empty heart and solid belly, two matters; outside no other method. When human heart is empty, dao heart arises, and belly is full, like striking bamboo calling turtle. Belly full, using dao heart’s firmness to control human heart’s softness, like turtle swallowing jade fungus. True knowledge appears, numinous wisdom quiet and heart bright, like playing zither summoning phoenix. Heart bright, using numinous wisdom’s nature to nurture true knowledge’s feeling, like phoenix drinking knife and jade tablet. Dao heart’s true knowledge and human heart’s numinous wisdom, empty and solid corresponding, firm and soft as one, always responding and always still, round and bright, pure and bare, red and brilliant, shining through and through, inside and outside bright, entering the serene middle Way sage’s realm. This is stealing yin and yang, seizing creation, turning Heaven and Earth, twisting qi mechanism, primordial and Heaven not disobeyed Way; how can this be spoken with ordinary people?

### On Gradual and Sudden:

**Fifty-four**

Medicine meets qi of same kind to form image,  
The Way is rare and obscure, fitting with nature.  
One grain of spirit elixir swallowed,  
Then knowing my life is not by Heaven.

Medicine of same qi and kind means true knowledge’s true yang and numinous wisdom’s true yin. True yin and true yang unite, only then from no image condense to form image. Heard but not seen is called rare; seen but not heard is called obscure. Unheard and unseen, dao returns to void; one qi perfectly united, lively and active, no thought, no action, quiet and unmoving, responding and communicating, all of Heaven’s cause, no forcing, fitting with nature. First yin and yang condense; then yin and yang blend; one spirit elixir suspended in emptiness, illuminating earth and mountains, everywhere shining. Swallowing and taking it, light fills the five viscera, dispelling all yin, changing postnatal lines and images, then knowing my life is mine not Heaven’s. The first two lines move from forcing to nature; the last two lines move from nature to sudden enlightenment. Spirit elixir entering belly means sudden enlightenment. Cultivating dao to sudden enlightenment, being and non-being both not established, Heaven and Earth all return to emptiness, leaping beyond yin and yang, not bound by yin and yang, life is self-determined, not by Heaven. If not yet reaching sudden enlightenment, still entering and leaving yin and yang, life still by Heaven, just playing—“beginning” shows this.

### On Forming the Elixir is Very Easy:

**Fifty-five**

Brilliant Golden Elixir formed in one day,  
Ancient immortals’ words truly worth hearing.  
If saying nine years or three years,  
All are delays, stretching days and months.

The Golden Elixir great medicine, everyone has it, every home ready. If one exhausts true principle, seeks bright master, knows true knowledge and numinous wisdom medicines, recognizes primordial gate’s one orifice, truly determined, directly crossing the shore, one day’s功夫 can form brilliant utmost yang elixir—why need three years or nine years? This is ancient immortal’s words, truly not false. But forming elixir in one moment, nurturing needs ten months. Without nurturing功夫, Golden Elixir not solid, must gain and lose. Saying one day formed means yin and yang unite, not elixir’s maturity. Maturity must use yin talisman and yang fire withdrawing and adding功夫, adding and adding, reducing and reducing, until no more to add or reduce, then only complete one brilliant utmost yang elixir. If truly mature elixir, how could it form in one day? The Immortal Elder’s previous poem says: “Though knowing cinnabar and black lead, if not knowing fire timing, it is idle; mostly all depends on cultivation power, a hair’s difference and elixir does not form.” Later lines say: “If you want to cultivate nine turns, first refine self and hold heart.” From this one can know the meaning of Golden Elixir formed in one day.

**Fifty-six**

Great medicine’s cultivation has ease and difficulty,  
Also knowing it depends on me and Heaven.  
If not accumulating yin virtue,  
Demons arise to obstruct.

The last poem said one day to form elixir is not difficult. But fearing students are careless with the Great Way, not cultivating virtue, rashly hoping for immortality, this poem uses virtue to explain. What Heaven commands to humans is virtue; what humans repay Heaven with is also virtue. With virtue Heaven rejoices; cultivating life is easy and depends on me; without virtue Heaven is angry; cultivating dao is hard and depends on Heaven. Why? Because without virtue and practice, ghosts and spirits do not tolerate. Demons arise to obstruct, troubles and illnesses, half way abandoned, inevitable. Thus cultivators must cultivate virtue first. When virtue is heavy, learning dao is easy; cultivating dao is easy; all because Heaven rejoices and demon obstruction dissolves.

### On Stealing the Mechanism:

**Fifty-seven**

The three talents steal at their time,  
Dao, virtue, and immortals hide this mechanism.  
When myriad transformations are settled and worries cease,  
All bones and joints are regulated, proving non-action.

The three talents stealing means Heaven and Earth steal qi from myriad things; myriad things steal qi from humans; humans steal qi from myriad things. Timely stealing means myriad things steal qi from Heaven and Earth to flourish; Heaven and Earth timely gather because of myriad things flourishing; thus Heaven and Earth are myriad things’ thieves. Humans see myriad things and become greedy and deluded; myriad things timely steal humans’ spirit; thus myriad things are humans’ thieves. Myriad things grow by human cultivation; humans harvest from myriad things; thus humans are myriad things’ thieves. Timely stealing has first and last taking mechanism, hidden by ancient immortals. Hidden because stealing timely, stealing mechanism, stealing yin and yang, seizing creation, turning life and death, twisting qi mechanism, removing guest qi, supporting righteous qi. Thus myriad transformations settled, worries cease, bones and joints regulated, proving non-action and natural Way. This poem emphasizes “timely.” Timely stealing means Heaven, Earth, myriad things’ qi is gained or lost by me at the right time; qi is stolen by Heaven, Earth, myriad things early. Timely means stealing; not timely means not stealing. The word “time” is subtle indeed.

### On Exhausting Principle:

**Fifty-eight**

Yin talisman’s precious words exceed three hundred,  
Dao and virtue’s spiritual writings fill five thousand.  
Since ancient times countless superior immortals,  
All attain true meaning here.

The Yin Talisman and Dao De two books are the ancestral texts of cultivation. They reveal Heaven and Earth’s creation mechanism, expose yin and yang’s birth and death stealing. Since ancient times to now, superior men and perfect ones all exhaust true principle in these two scriptures, attaining true meaning to understand nature and life. Like the Immortal Elder’s “Direct Point of Awakening,” also based on Yin Talisman and Dao De; if students can clearly understand truth, then Yin Talisman and Dao De’s meaning can also be understood.

### On Seeking a Master:

**Fifty-nine**

Though you are cleverer than Yan Min,  
Without a true master do not rashly guess.  
Because the Golden Elixir has no formula,  
Where can you learn to form the spirit embryo?

The previous scripture said Yin Talisman and Dao De are precious words and spiritual writings; students should exhaust their meaning. But fearing students cling to elixir scriptures, self-righteous, not seeking others, this poem urges seeking true master.

Elixir scriptures and their subtexts have all medicines and fire timing; many metaphors, all to make everyone understand this principle, know this Way. But nature and life’s study is subtle and deep, not easy to distinguish truth. If one sees and understands, must seek master to verify. If not seeking master, self-conceited, rashly guessing and privately discussing, is it not wasting nature and life? Thus it says though you are cleverer than Yan Min, without true master do not rashly guess. The Way of nature and life depends on gathering primordial qi. But primordial qi is formless and imageless, unseen, unheard, ungraspable—how to cultivate? How to return? Elixir scriptures and subtexts never fail to mention this qi, never fail to mention cultivation, never fail to mention return. But they speak so intensely yet not clearly; speak so much yet not enough. Must rely on true master’s oral transmission and heart teaching to recognize medicines, understand fire timing, go straight forward without obstruction. Otherwise, not seeking master’s secret, relying on elixir scripture’s words, slightly branching, falsely claiming great enlightenment, then acting arbitrarily, not attending to emptiness, then stuck on form—how and where to form spirit embryo? This true master’s secret must be urgently sought.

### On Resting the Mechanism:

**Sixtieth**

Clear the restless monkey mind’s mechanism,  
Three thousand功夫 equal Heaven.  
Naturally there is a cauldron cooking dragon and tiger,  
Why carry a family, cling to son and wife?

Students cannot understand the Way becoming Way all because the mind is unsettled, feet not firm. If all attachments are empty, looking down on all, reducing and reducing until non-action, the mind is clear and quiet, then internal功夫 is accomplished. Add virtue and cultivation, benefit self and others, everywhere convenient, rich cannot corrupt, poor cannot move, mighty cannot bend, determined and grounded, following fate day by day, all vexations removed, then external功夫 accomplished. Internal功夫 accomplished, external功夫 accomplished, three thousand功夫 full, virtue matching Heaven, can live as long as Heaven. Those with great virtue must obtain this matching. The human heart’s center cannot tolerate a speck of dust; if a speck of dust appears, nature and feeling do not harmonize, dragon and tiger rage wildly, dangers arise. If the mind’s mechanism is gone, empty and hollow, no need to seek cauldron and vessel; this itself is the cauldron and vessel. Once the cauldron and vessel are established, one movement one stillness, unaware and unknown, following Heaven’s law, nature and feeling unite, harmonious qi steams—this itself is cooking dragon and tiger, no need to ask about cooking dragon and tiger. This Way’s medicine is ready, cauldron and vessel exist. Those who know this, even fools and petty people, if diligent, can ascend to sagehood. But the world cannot see through worldly affairs, cannot recognize true nature and life, greedy for son and wife, entangled endlessly, exhausting heart and mind, oil dried and lamp extinguished, marrow exhausted and person dead—alas!

### On Knowing When to Stop:

**Sixty-first**

Before refining the returning elixir, quickly refine,  
After refining, also know when to stop.  
If holding fullness with unending heart,  
Surely one day will meet ruin and disgrace.

Returning elixir means returning to life’s beginning, good knowledge and good ability, firm and soft united, true numinous nature. Humans give birth to yin after yang; primordial enters postnatal; good knowledge turns to false knowledge; good ability turns to false ability. Firm and soft not proper, true numinous nature dimmed, like our home’s things lost outside. Returning means returning to what was originally had, like lost things regained, gone and returned. The Way of returning elixir has advancing, retreating, urgent, slow, nurturing, and stopping fire timing, must be used according to time and circumstance, cannot be too much nor too little. Thus at elixir’s end, vigorously advancing, gradually picking and refining, urgently seeking return. When elixir has returned, still good knowledge and good ability, firm and soft united, true numinous nature undimmed.功夫 complete, medicine qi sufficient, action done, non-action manifest, quickly stop fire and wheel, draw out firewood under cauldron, use nurturing功夫 to guard against danger, protect this one point of true numinous nature in the creation furnace. Natural true fire cooks and simmers itself, transforming all myriad yin, releasing an indestructible golden object, then all is ausp
