# Direct Pointing of Awakening, Volume Three

### A Five-Character Poem in Four Rhymes, Symbolizing the Great Unity Containing the True Qi

A maiden dons robes of blue,  
Her lord wears robes of pure white hue.  
Seen, yet cannot be employed;  
Used, yet cannot be viewed.  
In misty realms they chance to meet,  
In shadowed depths transformations greet.  
In a flash, flames leap and soar—  
The True Man appears once more.

The numinous knowing is the yin within yang,  
Endowed with softness, the nature of birth it sang.  
Belonging to wood, its color is blue—thus the maiden’s robe is true.  
The real knowing is yang within yin,  
Possessing firmness, its passion akin.  
Belonging to metal, its color is white—thus the lord’s pure garment bright.  

Yet nature and passion divide as prior and later heaven.  
Later heaven’s qi overcomes false passion’s mien;  
Its nature and passion have form and shape, seen but not employed, unseen.  
Prior heaven’s original nature and passion, true and empty,  
Formless, shapeless, the substance employed—cannot be seen, only sensed.  

Because unseen, they dwell in mist and shadow deep,  
Called misty, called shadowed, with qi but no shape to keep.  
Seen not by eyes, heard not by ears, grasped not by hands—how then to condense into elixir bands?  
Though unseen, unheard, ungrasped, the numinous knowing’s nature, the real knowing’s passion,  
At times in misty meeting, in shadowed change,  
The spirit silently withdraws, enters the furnace of creation,  
Fire is added, forging refined,  
In a moment’s breath, prior heaven’s qi  
Emerges from void, condenses to form,  
And the True Man appears within the darkened chamber.  

This is the image of the returning elixir method,  
The so-called completion of the elixir within one hour’s span.  
This True Man’s appearance is the union of true yin and true yang,  
A single spark of life arises—  
The so-called sacred embryo, not a ten-month fetus born outside the body.  
If it were a body outside the body, how could it in a moment’s time  
Shed skin and bone, birth a new form?  

The Immortal Elder’s poem thus symbolizes the Great Unity containing true qi.  
If one asks the meaning of the True Man’s appearance,  
I say it is none other than the Great Unity containing true qi.

### Twelve Poems of the West River Moon, Symbolizing the Twelve Months

The Immortal Elder said: "West is the direction of metal, River is the essence of water, Moon is the use of the elixir."

#### One

Internal medicine and external medicine are one,  
Internal passage, external must also run.  
At the elixir’s head, harmony and likeness,  
Warm nurturing, twofold action begun.  

Within dwells the natural true fire,  
In the furnace it blazes long and red.  
The outer furnace’s addition and subtraction require diligent work,  
Marvelous beyond compare, the true seed is fed.  

Internal medicine is the numinous nature of knowing,  
External medicine is the real passion of knowing.  
Because numinous knowing is hidden in the human heart,  
It enters the heart to act, borrowing spirit to birth illusion—thus called internal medicine.  
Because real knowing is present in the dao heart,  
When the dao heart withdraws, real knowing is obscured—thus called external medicine.  

Real knowing and numinous knowing are originally one family,  
Born of the same source with different names—thus internal medicine and external medicine are one.  
Internal medicine is for cultivating nature, which must be thoroughly understood;  
External medicine is for cultivating destiny, which must also be well known.  

The ancient classics say: "Cultivating destiny without nature is the first fault in practice;  
Cultivating nature without destiny, the shadow spirits of ten thousand kalpas cannot enter the sage."  
Therefore internal and external must both be understood.  

Nature is yin, destiny is yang.  
The golden liquid great elixir takes true yin and true yang, two strings of the same kind of qi, harmonized and united.  
If you cultivate destiny without nature, or nature without destiny,  
It is lonely yin or solitary yang—no great elixir forms.  
Thus nature and destiny must be cultivated together.  

But nature has its function, destiny has its function;  
Nature belongs to the dharma body’s higher matters, destiny to the illusory body’s affairs.  
Warm nurturing has twofold action, greatly distinct—thus the practice must have two stages.  

The way of cultivating nature is the way of non-action,  
Non-action means stillness, no forced effort, holding the center embracing unity.  
The inner furnace naturally has true fire, blazing long and red—this is warming with gentle fire.  

As for cultivating destiny, it is the way of action,  
Active effort requires the outer furnace’s addition and subtraction, diligent refining—this is cooking with vigorous fire.  
Add to make up for real knowing’s lack, choosing good and holding fast;  
Subtract to reduce numinous knowing’s excess, discarding cleverness and destroying wisdom.  

Add until no more can be added, subtract until no more can be reduced,  
Nature fixed, destiny condensed, the true seed in hand—then is the marvel complete.  
These twofold actions of nature and destiny, and the external elixir’s achievement,  
Gathered within the cauldron is the internal elixir.  

What was future becomes present, what has come becomes internal—  
The so-called golden return to nature, then rightly called the returning elixir.

#### Two

This medicine is most divine and most sacred,  
Yet worries that your portion is thin and hard to digest.  
Harmonizing lead and mercury will not last the whole morning,  
Early you will see the mysterious pearl’s form and sign.  

The previous poem clarified the internal and external medicines,  
This one speaks of the external elixir’s practice and effort.  
The way of the golden elixir is most divine, most sacred,  
Those who cultivate it see results at once, ascending to the sage’s rank.  
Only fearing that one’s blessings are shallow and thin, hard to bear the gift.  

The difficulty of the golden elixir lies in the true lead of real knowing,  
And the true mercury of numinous knowing.  
If one can recognize real knowing and numinous knowing and harmonize them,  
Then firmness and softness balance, nature and passion become one.  

No need to wait the whole morning,  
The shape and sign of good knowing and good ability appear early,  
Like the primal pearl quietly shining in the dark.  

The root of good knowing and good ability has long been buried, unable to emerge.  
Now with real knowing and numinous knowing combined,  
Though not yet fully pure and complete, a single spark of life already shows in mist and shadow.  
With this spark, from subtle to manifest, gradually it returns to purity.  
The form and sign are the early glimpse of purity.  

If there is a determined person who diligently cultivates,  
No need to avoid the marketplace or court—why not dwell there?  
The golden elixir’s way, the medicine is ready, the effort easy,  
No need to seek outside, it is right here among people.  

If one were to speak plainly, it might cause laughter—  
But laughter is shared by ordinary and sage alike:  
Heaven and man share one principle, only differing in obedience or rebellion.

#### Three

White Tiger’s head is the supreme treasure,  
The divine water of the Flowery Pool is true gold.  
Thus one knows the highest good benefits deeply,  
Not like ordinary medicines at all.  

If you want to complete the nine turns,  
First you must refine yourself and hold your heart.  
Gather herbs in due time to fix floating and sinking,  
When increasing fire, beware of great danger.  

The previous poem spoke of harmonizing lead and mercury to form the elixir.  
But to harmonize lead and mercury, first you must recognize the true lead of real knowing, the great medicine of one flavor, before beginning.  

Real knowing is true passion, symbolized as White Tiger’s head, also as the divine water of the Flowery Pool, hidden within false passion.  
Passion belongs to metal, thus called White Tiger.  

Though real passion hides within false passion, at times it reveals itself,  
The heart of Heaven and Earth reappears, life sprouts anew—thus called the head of the classic.  
Head means beginning, classic means constant way.  
The origin of the classic way is from nothingness to being, yin containing yang, mother of all things—this is the spark of life.  

This single spark is the root of sage and worthy, the foundation of Buddha and immortal—thus called the supreme treasure.  
This spark is also called the divine water of the Flowery Pool.  
The Flowery Pool is the primordial gate, the wondrous portal.  

Because it contains life’s spark, it is called Flowery Pool;  
Because this spark cleanses all bones and purifies the five viscera, it is called divine water;  
Because the spark, tempered by fire, condenses without dispersing, lasting and unspoiled, it is called true gold.  

Head of the classic, divine water, true gold—  
All are one thing: the spark of life, also called the highest good nature.  
Highest good means utmost goodness, without evil, embracing all principles and responding to all affairs,  
Like water’s source, far flowing and long, benefiting all things without exhaustion.  

This preserves life and perfects the corner, the most genuine medicine,  
Not like ordinary herbs, wood, metal, or stone medicines.  

But this medicine is hidden in later heaven, appearing only occasionally,  
Ephemeral and fleeting, unable to remain long.  

If you want to complete the nine turns, never decaying,  
You must first refine yourself and hold your heart,  
Eliminate alien qi and dusty passions,  
Gather in due time to fix floating and sinking.  

Numinous knowing is hidden in the human heart; when the heart moves, numinous knowing flies, easily floating.  
Real knowing is present in the dao heart; when the dao heart is dim, real knowing hides, easily sinking.  

Refining self and holding heart means refining away human heart’s numinous knowing, making the floating sink.  
Gathering in due time means gathering the dao heart, making the sinking float.  

Floating and sinking reversed,  
Using dao heart to control human heart,  
Using human heart to follow dao heart,  
Using real knowing to govern numinous knowing,  
Using numinous knowing to nourish real knowing.  

When human heart is still and dao heart remains,  
Real knowing and numinous knowing share one breath and branch,  
The golden elixir is hopeful.  

Though the medicine is easy to know, the fire’s timing is hardest.  
Advancing fire requires knowing the medicine’s ripeness, urgency, and fortune or misfortune.  
If you rashly begin, not only is it useless, but harmful—  
Therefore advancing fire must guard against great danger.

#### Four

If you want true lead to hold mercury,  
The lord must not part from his loyal retainer.  
If wood and metal are separated, no meeting will occur—  
All depends on the matchmaker’s coaxing.  

The previous poem said gathering herbs requires the power of self-refinement.  
To refine oneself is to desire the three families to meet.  

The way of the golden elixir is simply the two words: firmness and softness.  
Firmness’s central upright is real knowing, symbolized as true lead;  
Softness’s central upright is numinous knowing, symbolized as true mercury.  

Taking these two substances, combined to form the elixir.  
But if real knowing is not manifest, numinous knowing easily flies away—  
Real knowing is the master controlling numinous knowing.  

Though real knowing can control numinous knowing, numinous knowing can also nourish real knowing—  
Numinous knowing is the loyal retainer of real knowing.  

If numinous knowing is not first fixed, real knowing will not appear—  
Thus: if you want true lead to hold mercury, the lord must not part from his loyal retainer.  

The lord is real knowing; the retainer is numinous knowing;  
If the retainer is disobedient, the lord cannot act.  

Real knowing and numinous knowing contend over the slightest difference.  
When numinous knowing is exhausted, real knowing appears;  
When real knowing remains, numinous knowing follows.  

Real knowing’s presence means firmness; numinous knowing’s stillness means softness.  
Firm and soft, nature and passion harmonize.  

Thus the elixir way takes true lead and true mercury, two medicines only.  
Real knowing’s lead passion belongs to metal; numinous knowing’s mercury nature belongs to wood.  

Later heaven acts, passion in west, nature in east.  
If metal and wood are separated, each alone, they cannot meet.  

If not for true nature’s mutual communication,  
True passion and true nature do not manifest, real knowing and numinous knowing do not unite.  

True faith is true intention, also called true earth.  
When true earth appears, metal and wood unite;  
When true faith connects, nature and passion harmonize.  

True faith is the matchmaker of true passion and true nature.  
True nature is wood, governing obedience and benevolence;  
True passion is metal, governing firmness and righteousness.  

When nature and passion find faith to harmonize within,  
Wood loves metal’s passion and follows righteousness,  
Metal’s passion loves wood’s benevolence and compassion.  

Nature and passion become one, firmness and softness respond, benevolence and righteousness both complete,  
Real knowing and numinous knowing share one breath.  

They consume and devour each other, nature fixed passion forgotten,  
Prior heaven’s qi comes from void, condenses into a millet grain,  
The sacred embryo takes form, symbolizing the man’s conception.

#### Five

Who is the Twenty-Eight’s lovely maiden?  
Where is the Nine-Three’s noble lord?  
They call themselves wood’s liquid and metal’s essence,  
Yet meet earth and become three surnames.  

Again relying on Master Ding’s refining,  
Only then do husband and wife begin joyful affection.  
The river chariot dares not pause or delay,  
Transporting upward to Kunlun’s peak.  

The previous poem spoke of the three families meeting, thus forming the sacred embryo.  
But if the three families meet without true fire refining, the sacred embryo will not form.  

Two is the number of yin fire, eight the number of yin wood—thus the lovely maiden.  
Nine is the number of yang metal, three the number of yang wood—thus the noble lord.  

Wood’s liquid is fire; wood generates fire, one surname.  
Metal’s essence is water; metal generates water, one surname.  
Earth dwells in the center, its own surname—these five phases divided into three surnames.  

When three surnames meet and unite as one surname, it is the completion of the five phases.  

Compare this to the cultivator:  
Primordial nature and primordial spirit are wood-fire surname;  
Primordial passion and primordial essence are metal-water surname;  
Primordial qi is earth surname—these are the inner three surnames.  

Benevolence and propriety belong to wood-fire surname;  
Righteousness and wisdom belong to metal-water surname;  
Faith belongs to earth surname—these are the outer three surnames.  

The cultivator uses the inner three surnames to govern the outer three,  
Uses the outer three to complete the inner three,  
All to unify the three surnames into one surname as the final result.  

But these three surnames require brave and vigorous cultivation,  
Wholehearted dedication, a death-like effort,  
Only then can they return to one surname.  

Master Ding’s refining is this brave and vigorous effort.  
Brave effort leads from unbenevolence to benevolence,  
From unrighteousness to righteousness,  
From lack of propriety to propriety,  
From ignorance to wisdom,  
From disbelief to faith.  

Benevolence, righteousness, propriety, wisdom all return to one faith.  
Nature, passion, and spirit also transform into one qi.  

The three surnames harmonize, firmness and softness correspond, nature and passion become one,  
Then husband and wife begin joyous affection.  

Once husband and wife join in joy, the longer the stronger,  
Fire work is uninterrupted, one qi succeeds,  
Surely reaching pure yang, silent and scentless, then complete.  

Therefore the river chariot dares not pause or delay,  
Transporting upward to Kunlun’s peak.  

The river chariot is the northern righteous qi,  
Not the practice of moving kidney qi from tailbone along spine to head.  
It is the success of one qi, using water to aid fire, water and fire cooking without interruption.  

Like the waterwheel in the river, carrying water up and down,  
Turning day and night without rest.  

Kunlun is the ancestor of all mountains,  
Transported to Kunlun’s peak,  
Where the three flowers gather at the summit, five qi greet the origin,  
Entering true emptiness and wondrous existence,  
Unknown and unknowable, following the emperor’s law and place.

#### Six

Seven returns cinnabar to root,  
Nine returns golden liquid to truth.  
Do not use Yin and Zi numbers, nor Kun and Shen,  
Only require the five phases to be precise.  

Originally mercury is one flavor,  
Traveling all the stars and constellations.  
When yin and yang numbers suffice, one naturally attains spirit,  
Entering and exiting, never leaving the mysterious gateway.  

The previous poem spoke of gathering the five phases, moving fire and refining, then success.  
But refining requires knowing the true principle of seven returns and nine returns.  

Seven is the yang number of fire, nine is the yang number of metal.  

Numinous knowing’s nature is soft, hiding false fire within;  
When false fire is consumed, true fire arises,  
Like numinous mercury forming cinnabar, forever fixed, neither flying nor scattering—fire returns to root.  

Real knowing’s passion is firm, containing dry metal within;  
Dry metal transforms into true pure gold,  
Like turbid gold turning to liquid, forever pure and bright—metal returns to truth.  

This elixir scripture’s seven returns and nine returns,  
The world’s false schools take Zi to Shen as nine returns, and Yin to Kun as seven returns—do they understand the meaning?  

If not understanding seven returns and nine returns, how can one know the five phases are precise?  

When five phases are precise, fire returns to root, and from fire emerges wood and spirit.  
Spirit means numinous knowing does not darken.  

Metal returns to truth, and from water arises metal and essence united.  
Essence united means real knowing always remains.  

Numinous knowing not darkened, real knowing always present—  
Real knowing is numinous knowing, numinous knowing is real knowing.  

Metal, wood, water, fire, four images harmonize,  
Returning to center, five phases as one qi, neither biased nor leaning,  
Perfect heavenly principle, five phases precise indeed.  

Yet the work of five phases precise is always the great medicine of metal in water.  
The mercury used is silver in water, which is metal in water,  
Still a single point of real knowing’s true passion.  

Real knowing contains prior heaven’s true one qi,  
Root of five phases, foundation of four images.  
Moving it produces yang, stillness produces yin,  
Circulating through the four images and five phases of the stars’ positions.  

The way of return and reversal is to advance yang fire when yang is timely,  
To use yin talisman when yin is timely, nourishing this knowing.  

When yang fire and yin talisman numbers suffice,  
Five phases blend and transform,  
Good knowing and good ability, silent and unmoving,  
Touched and thus connected, naturally attaining spirit.  

Spirit is the inscrutable yin and yang.  
Yin and yang inscrutable, sacred embryo condenses, called the valley spirit;  
Valley spirit does not die, called the non-gate;  
The primordial gate is called Heaven and Earth’s root.  

When yin and yang numbers suffice, the primordial gate is established;  
Primordial gate established, valley spirit enters and exits the gate,  
Long life and immortality, the way of return and reversal is complete.  

As it is said: "To attain the valley spirit’s long life and deathlessness,  
One must rely on the primordial gate to establish the root."

#### Seven

Within the male lies the female essence,  
Bearing yin yet embracing yang’s quintessence.  
Two medicines harmonize to form the formula,  
Transforming the soul and spirit, the sacred whole.  

The way of the golden elixir’s seven returns and nine returns requires yin and yang numbers sufficient.  
But to move yin and yang, one must know true yin and true yang.  

Within the male lies the female essence—  
In the hexagram, this is Li’s void; in man, the numinous knowing hidden in the human heart.  

Bearing yin yet embracing yang’s quintessence—  
In the hexagram, this is Kan’s fullness; in man, the real knowing present in the dao heart.  

Real knowing and numinous knowing, two medicines,  
Only when harmonized can the elixir form.  

The soul is yang containing yin, the spirit is yin containing yang.  
The soul is the god of real knowing; the spirit is the god of numinous knowing.  

The soul is slight yang; the spirit is abundant yin.  
Yang less, yin more—imbalanced, no golden elixir forms.  

Only when real knowing and numinous knowing meet,  
And soul and spirit return to central upright,  
Transforming into true nature and true passion,  
Yin and yang mixed as one, heavenly principle revealed,  
Human desires vanish.  

Good knowing and good ability, round and full,  
Bright and shining, pure and bare,  
Red and brilliant, a single golden elixir,  
Suspended in the vast void, illuminating the three thousand great worlds,  
Crosswise and lengthwise, opposing and following, rewarding and obstructing.  

This elixir, swallowed as one grain, instantly makes one immortal on earth;  
Swallowed by a snake, it transforms into a dragon;  
Eaten by a rooster, it transforms into a phoenix,  
Flying straight into the true yang’s pure realm.  

But snake swallowing rooster also symbolizes elixir method.  
Snake belongs to fire, south is Li; dragon belongs to wood, east is Zhen;  
Rooster in west belongs to metal, Dui; phoenix near water in north is Kan.  

Snake swallowing becomes dragon—wood emerges from fire;  
Rooster eating becomes phoenix—metal born in water.  

Wood and metal unite, water and fire assist,  
One qi mingled, existence and nonexistence established,  
Self and other return to emptiness, form and spirit both wondrous, entering the sage—this is called spirit.  

Leaving the mundane world, dwelling in the pure yang realm—how could this be empty talk?

#### Eight

Heaven and earth just meet in yes and no,  
Morning and evening well know confusion and ignorance.  
Spokes come together, hub and water face east,  
Marvel lies in drawing out and adding in use.  

Attain one and all is complete,  
No need to divide south, north, west, or east.  
Reduce again and again, guard prior work,  
Life’s treasure should not be lightly toyed.  

The way of the golden elixir is the way of creation.  
Creation’s way is the way of one yin and one yang.  

Within a year, at the month of Yin,  
Heaven’s qi rises, earth’s qi descends—this is harmony (Tai);  
At the month of Shen, earth’s qi rises, heaven’s qi descends—this is no harmony (Pi).  

Within a day, Zi hour is morning’s start,  
At Zi, yang qi moves inward, yin qi moves outward—this is confusion (Tun);  
Wu hour is evening’s start,  
At Wu, yang qi stops outside, yin qi grows inside—this is ignorance (Meng).  

Yes and no are the year’s yin and yang rise and fall;  
Confusion and ignorance are the day’s morning and evening yin and yang coming and going.  

Observing heaven and earth’s yes and no,  
One knows the day’s morning confusion and evening ignorance.  

One day’s yin and yang news is like one year’s yin and yang news.  
Yet one year’s yin and yang and one day’s yin and yang are one qi, coming and going in use.  

The cultivator follows heaven and earth’s yes and no seasons,  
Matches morning and evening confusion and ignorance’s timing,  
When yang is present, advance yang fire;  
When yin is present, use yin talisman.  

Yang’s firmness and yin’s softness do not lose their time,  
Gathering meaning to produce, gathering five phases, harmonizing four images,  
Like thirty spokes converging on one hub to form a wheel,  
Like a thousand streams flowing to the sea,  
All one qi, golden elixir condenses.  

Though golden elixir condenses marvelously,  
It depends on drawing out and adding in use.  

Drawing out means drawing out false yin and false yang;  
Adding in means adding true yin and true yang.  

False yin goes away, true yang appears;  
False yang vanishes, true yin arises.  

True yin and true yang return to central upright,  
Two become one, real knowing and numinous knowing, nature and passion unite,  
Returning to good knowing and good ability, original face revealed.  

The skill of drawing out and adding in is wondrous indeed!  

Generally, to cultivate the elixir, one must know true yin and true yang,  
And also know prior heaven’s true one qi.  

This qi existed before the primal chaos was divided, before yin and yang separated.  
Contained it is true emptiness, released it is wondrous existence.  

Its image is metal in water, its essence is the heavenly goodness held firm,  
Its use is the one-flavor dao heart.  

Elixir method only takes the dao heart, one great medicine,  
Though one flavor, it governs five phases’ qi, possessing five phases’ virtue.  

The dao heart is the water from which one is transformed,  
One is the start of numbers, one contains five, five return to one.  

When it returns to one, it cannot be called dao heart,  
Only called perfect heavenly principle.  

Thus Confucians call perfect heavenly principle the Great Ultimate;  
Daoists call perfect heavenly principle the golden elixir;  
Buddhists call perfect heavenly principle perfect enlightenment.  

The ancient classics say: "Attain the one, all affairs complete."  
This is it.  

When you attain the one, the life treasure is already in hand,  
No need to divide south, north, west, or east,  
Using gathering method.  

But only use dao heart to guard human heart,  
Reduce again and again.  

Human heart contains alien qi,  
All must be transformed away,  
Purely gentle numinous knowing,  
Then human heart becomes dao heart.  

Human heart houses the knowing spirit,  
Knowing spirit carries kalpa roots of dust and current world habits,  
And the body’s qi and temperament’s evils.  

If these calamity roots are not each reduced and removed,  
Even a trace left, at some moment it will arise,  
Life treasure leaks, prior work wasted—  
Therefore guard prior work carefully,  
Life treasure should not be lightly toyed.  

The ancient immortal said:  
"Not a speck of yang qi exhausted, no death;  
Not a speck of yin qi exhausted, no immortality."  

Therefore after attaining the elixir,  
You must uproot the seeds of endless kalpas, birth and death cycles,  
Only then is life treasure truly yours, lasting and unspoiled.

#### Nine

Winter solstice brings one yang returning,  
Every thirty days adds one yang line.  
Within the month, Fu hexagram, new moon tide,  
After full moon, Gan ends, Gou begins.  

The sun also divides cold and heat,  
Yang born and revived at midnight.  
At Wu hour, Gou’s image is one yin morning,  
Refining medicine must know dusk and dawn.  

The previous poem spoke of drawing out and adding in use,  
Teaching to imitate heaven and earth’s morning and evening creation.  

Within a year, the eleven-month winter solstice brings one yang born,  
Every thirty days adds one yang line.  

At the eleventh month’s Zi, one yang born—this is Fu;  
Twelfth month’s Chou, two yang born—this is Lin;  
First month’s Yin, three yang born—this is Tai;  
Second month’s Mao, four yang born—this is Da Zhuang;  
Third month’s Chen, five yang born—this is Guai;  
Fourth month’s Si, six yang born—this is Gan;  
These are six yang hexagrams.  

At the fifth month’s Wu, one yin born—this is Gou;  
Sixth month’s Wei, two yin born—this is Dun;  
Seventh month’s Shen, three yin born—this is Pi;  
Eighth month’s You, four yin born—this is Guan;  
Ninth month’s Xu, five yin born—this is Bo;  
Tenth month’s Hai, six yin born—this is Kun;  
These are six yin hexagrams.  

Six yang months are morning, six yin months are evening—this is the year’s morning and evening.  

Within one month, between new and full moon,  
Sun and moon meet, moon receives sunlight,  
After three days, sunlight first emerges from sea water,  
Tides respond as Fu, every two and a half days adding one yang line.  

At the fifteenth day, moon is full, brilliance complete as Gan.  
From first to fifteenth, six yang hexagrams.  

After full moon ends, from sixteenth to eighteenth, one yin born,  
Yang light wanes, Gou is the sign’s start, every two and a half days adding one yin line.  

At thirtieth day, month’s end, light vanishes, only black remains as Kun.  
From sixteenth to thirtieth, six yin hexagrams.  

Two and a half days per line, twelve lines run six yang and six yin hexagrams—this is one month’s morning and evening.  

Within one day, also divided into cold and heat.  
Each day at midnight, Zi hour, one yang born as Fu,  
Each hour adds one yang line,  
At Si hour, six yang born as Gan,  
At Wu hour, one yin born as Gou,  
Each hour adds one yin line,  
At Hai hour, six yin born as Kun.  

Twelve hours run six yin and six yang hexagrams—this is one day’s morning and evening.  

The sages moved one year’s yin and yang morning and evening into one month,  
Moved one month’s yin and yang morning and evening into one day,  
Moved one day’s yin and yang morning and evening into one hour.  

One hour has eight quarters, one quarter fifteen minutes, eight quarters total one hundred twenty minutes.  
The upper four quarters, sixty minutes, are six yang;  
The lower four quarters, sixty minutes, are six yin.  

Also one hour’s yin and yang morning and evening moved into one quarter, divided into fifteen minutes.  
The upper seven and a half minutes are yang;  
The lower seven and a half minutes are yin.  

Within this brief quarter, gather the great medicine,  
Return to the creation’s cauldron,  
Use yang fire and yin talisman to refine and form the elixir.  

The so-called no quarter, no hour, no branch, no hexagram divides heaven and earth within.  
But one must know the yin’s birth and yang’s birth morning and evening.  

Knowing morning and evening,  
One day, one month, one year’s creation,  
Is all within one hour and one quarter.  

Those blind in the world,  
Either sit in meditation at Zi, Zi, Wu,  
Or follow one month’s new and full moon to circulate qi,  
Or cultivate at winter and summer solstice—  
Do they understand the principle of morning and evening?

#### Ten

Not discerning five phases and four images,  
How to distinguish cinnabar, mercury, lead, and silver?  
Unheard of fire’s timing in elixir refining,  
Already claiming reclusion and retreat.  

Unwilling to reflect on one’s own faults,  
Yet teaching others the wrong path,  
Misleading them into endless confusion,  
How can such deceive the heart and bear it calmly?  

The previous poem spoke of refining medicine requiring knowledge of yin and yang morning and evening.  
This poem follows closely, directed at those ignorant of yin and yang morning and evening.  

The way of immortals originally seeks to perfect oneself then perfect things,  
Cultivate the dao then cultivate virtue.  

The world’s lost path does not discern the true principle of five phases and four images,  
Does not understand the allegory of cinnabar, mercury, lead, and silver;  
Does not know the medicines, nor the fire’s timing,  
Learning some side door minor method,  
Self-conceited as having the way, claiming reclusion and retreat.  

Unwilling to reflect on one’s own faults,  
Yet teaching others the wrong path,  
Leading one blind to lead many blind,  
Misleading into confusion, never to transcend for kalpas.  

Such deceiving and bearing heart,  
Should enter the hell of no questions,  
Never to see the light of day—how can they hope to attain the dao?

#### Eleven

Virtue’s practice surpasses eight hundred,  
Yin功 accumulates full three thousand.  
Equalizing self and other, friend and foe,  
Then accords with the immortal’s original wish.  

Tigers and rhinoceroses, swords and spears cannot harm,  
Impermanence’s fiery house cannot bind.  
After the treasure talisman descends, go greet Heaven,  
Steadily riding phoenix chariots and phoenix carriages.  

The previous poem spoke of side doors and external paths,  
Not understanding the dao and only harming virtue, unable to cultivate virtue.  
This poem speaks of cultivating virtue after cultivating the dao.  

Cultivating the dao is for oneself,  
Cultivating virtue is for others.  

Dao cultivation has an end,  
Virtue cultivation has no end.  

Thus after the immortal dao is attained,  
One must have three thousand功 full, eight hundred practices complete,  
Self and other both forgotten, friends and foes alike;  
Measured as Heaven and Earth, embracing all things,  
Dao and virtue both complete, then accords with original wish.  

At this stage, inside and outside are empty,  
Existence and nonexistence both established,  
Form and spirit both wondrous,  
Tigers and rhinoceroses cannot harm,  
Swords and spears cannot add injury,  
Impermanence’s fiery house cannot bind.  

The treasure talisman descends to summon,  
Steadily riding phoenix chariots and phoenix carriages,  
Ascending in broad daylight,  
A great man’s功 complete and fame fulfilled—how joyful indeed!

#### Twelve

The ox and the maiden’s affection accords with the dao,  
The turtle and snake’s nature is born of nature.  
The toad and crow meet at new moon, joining the beautiful,  
Two qi mutually assist and revolve.  

Originally the wondrous use of Heaven and Earth,  
Who can reach this true explanation?  
If yin and yang are separated, it becomes error,  
How can Heaven and Earth be long-lasting?  

The above eleven poems all speak of cultivating the golden elixir’s great way,  
Requiring true yin and true yang medicines combined to form the elixir.  
Yet some doubt this is forced, but it is not forced, all is natural operation.  

Thus this poem summarizes the above meaning,  
To help learners exhaust the true principle.  

Like the ox and maiden meeting on the seventh evening,  
The turtle and snake mating by kind,  
The toad and crow joining at new and full moon,  
All are yin and yang two qi, one responding to the other, natural union,  
The wondrous use of Heaven and Earth’s creation.  

The way of Heaven and Earth’s creation is the way of one yin and one yang.  
Yin and yang mutually assist, one qi flows,  
Yin then yang, yang then yin, yin and yang coming and going,  
Four seasons run and all things grow, life’s spark never ceases,  
Thus ancient and modern always endure.  

The cultivator, if not reaching this true explanation,  
Abandoning yin and yang’s creation principle,  
Clinging to emptiness and form, forcing and striving,  
Instead causes yin and yang to separate,  
Not only no benefit to nature and destiny,  
But harms nature and destiny,  
Faults and errors cannot be avoided,  
Still hoping for Heaven and Earth’s long-lasting,  
To become immortal without death—how can this be?  

The way of Heaven and Earth’s long-lasting is the way of true yin and true yang combined.  
True yin and true yang combined,  
Within is vigorous life, condensing the sacred embryo.  
From nothing to being, from being to nothing,  
Shedding illusory body to reveal true body,  
Only then can one be as long-lasting as Heaven and Earth.  

The cultivator, if seeking Heaven and Earth’s long-lasting,  
Abandoning true yin and true yang,  
Has no other method.

### Additional West River Moon Poem, Symbolizing the Moistening Moon

The elixir is the color body’s greatest treasure,  
Refined it transforms endlessly.  
Further probing nature’s true sect,  
Resolving the wondrous use of non-birth.  

No need to wait for other bodies or future lives,  
Before your eyes gain Buddha’s divine powers.  
Since the Dragon Maiden undertook this功,  
Who thereafter can follow her steps?  

This poem and the following five quatrains, according to the Immortal Elder’s preface, are not part of the main “Direct Pointing of Awakening” collection, but an external collection.  
Enjoying their meaning, they teach first cultivating destiny, then cultivating nature.  

Xue, Lu, and Chen’s three commentaries, because they mention cultivating destiny, include them in the main collection—thus we follow.  

Yuan Duzi said: "A single drop of yang essence, secret in the shape mountain, not in heart or kidney, but in the primordial gate’s single cavity."  

A single drop of yang essence is the elixir.  
Secret in the shape mountain means it is the color body’s greatest treasure.  

The elixir is no other thing,  
But the prior heaven’s single drop of utmost yang essence,  
Also called prior heaven’s true one qi,  
Also called vast and upright qi;  
Contained it is true emptiness, released it is wondrous existence;  
Its essence is heavenly goodness, its use is the dao heart.  

It is the color body’s greatest treasure,  
Not belonging to heart or kidney,  
But stored in the primordial gate’s single cavity.  

The primordial gate’s single cavity has no direction or place,  
No form or image.  

This elixir also has no direction or place,  
No form or image, moving and still as it wishes,  
Color and emptiness unbound, lively and vivid,  
Like fire refined into solid substance;  
Always responsive and always still, always still and always responsive,  
Transforming endlessly, mysterious and unfathomable.  

Though Heaven, Earth, and spirits cannot grasp it,  
It dwells within the color body,  
Able to transform the color body—this is the dharma body.  

Thus ancient immortals said, "Life’s creation depends on the body."  

“Depends on the body” means depends on the dharma body.  
When the dharma body is accomplished, the sacred embryo complete,  
Life’s foundation firm,  
Active affairs finished, inactive affairs manifest,  
One can cultivate nature.  

Nature’s true sect is the wondrous use of non-birth.  
Cultivating destiny is for longevity,  
Cultivating nature is for non-birth.  
Non-birth means no death.  

No birth and no death,  
One with the Great Void in essence,  
Form and spirit both wondrous,  
Forever escaping the cycle of reincarnation,  
Transcending Heaven and Earth,  
No need to wait for other bodies or future lives,  
Before your eyes gain Buddha’s divine powers.  

The way of no birth is sudden awakening and perfect penetration,  
All phenomena empty, directly crossing the other shore.  

At the old Lotus Mountain assembly,  
The World Honored One taught the Dharma,  
A seven-year-old Dragon Maiden emerged from the earth,  
Offered a precious pearl,  
Instantly became Buddha on the spot.  

The Immortal Elder cites the Dragon Maiden offering the pearl as a case,  
To prove cultivating the true emptiness nature.  

Cultivating the true emptiness nature is the Dragon Maiden offering the pearl.  
Awakening to true emptiness, neither birth nor death,  
Is to gain Buddha’s divine powers.  

But if destiny is not cultivated, nature is hard to understand.  
Hard to understand means one can suddenly awaken and penetrate,  
Nurture true nature, but still enter and exit later heaven,  
Without undergoing great fire refining,  
Slight leaks remain,  
Difficult to avoid the peril of casting off body and entering body.  

After cultivating destiny, cultivate nature.  
Emerging from the great fire furnace, impurities all transformed,  
From then on follow the way of non-action to cultivate nature,  
From gradual to sudden,  
Directly ascending the highest vehicle of wondrous awakening—  
How could one cast off body and enter body?  

Therefore it is said, no need to wait for other bodies or future lives,  
Before your eyes gain Buddha’s divine powers.  

It shows the golden elixir’s great way first cultivates destiny, then cultivates nature.

### Five Seven-Character Quatrains, Symbolizing the Five Phases: Metal, Wood, Water, Fire, Earth

#### One

Though you understand the true suchness nature,  
Still cannot avoid casting off body and entering body.  
Why not also cultivate the great medicine,  
Suddenly transcending the no-leak to become True Man?  

True suchness nature is Heaven’s true self, free and unforced,  
Neither form nor emptiness, the so-called unknowing and unknowable, following the emperor’s law.  

To cultivate this nature, you must understand it;  
Once understood, you must refine it into an adamantine, indestructible thing,  
Only then can you be saved.  

If you have awakened but do not know cultivation,  
Your destiny is not yours but Heaven’s;  
When the great limit comes, no support remains,  
Casting off body and entering body—how to avoid?  

After sudden awakening, do not abandon gradual cultivation,  
Use yang fire and yin talisman to cook the great medicine,  
Transforming the many yins, shedding attachments,  
Revealing the true body.  

Then entering water will not drown, entering fire will not burn,  
Tigers and rhinoceroses cannot harm, swords and spears cannot cut,  
Becoming the no-leak True Man.

Long ago the Sixth Patriarch, having received the Fifth Patriarch’s transmission,  
Hid among the hunters of Sihui, blending with the world and shining light,  
Attained the true fruit.  

Purple Sage suddenly awakened to perfect penetration,  
Knew it was not the highest matter,  
Must receive the apricot grove transmission to complete greatly,  
All considered as cultivating the great medicine.  

If truly awakened to suchness, that is attaining the dao.  
The Sixth Patriarch awakened to originally having nothing,  
What was the Fifth Patriarch’s midnight transmission?  

Purple Sage suddenly awakened to perfect penetration,  
Why seek the apricot grove?  

Thus sudden awakening and gradual cultivation are both indispensable,  
Either sudden then gradual, or gradual then sudden.  

Nature and destiny must both be cultivated,  
功 must have two stages.  

This poem proceeds from nature and destiny, sudden awakening to gradual practice.

#### Two

Rebirth, soul snatching, and moving residence,  
Old dwellers called four fruit disciples.  
If one can subdue dragons and tame tigers,  
When will true gold build its house and never wither?  

Rebirth means foreseeing a wealthy family’s pregnant woman,  
And at birth time, a rebirth occurs.  

Soul snatching means at birth, a yin soul waits to enter the orifice,  
Before it enters, another enters first, snatching its place.  

Moving residence means when the body declines,  
Choosing a strong newborn body, secretly switching.  

Old dwellers means a strong person dies suddenly,  
Borrowing the hot corpse to enter the orifice, dwelling in the old abode.  

Rebirth and soul snatching are much alike;  
Moving residence and old dwelling are much alike.  

All four involve refining yin spirit’s free coming and going.  
Buddhists call these four fruit disciples, also called external paths,  
From the two vehicles’ methods, not the Buddha’s true suchness highest vehicle.  

Different from ordinary people only in clear coming and going.  

But the golden elixir’s great way descends the east family,  
True nature’s dragon subdues the west family,  
True passion’s tiger returns passion to nature,  
Nurturing passion with nature, nature and passion harmonize,  
Dragon and tiger meet,  
Producing the eighteen-foot dharma body,  
Like true gold building a house,  
Long-lasting with Heaven and Earth,  
Forever never withering.  

How could there be moving here and there?

#### Three

Mirror the form, close breath, think spirit method,  
At first difficult, later smooth path.  
Suddenly able to roam ten thousand lands,  
Why then move house and change residence?  

Mirroring the form means hanging a mirror on the wall,  
Preserving spirit within, after long time the yin spirit leaves outside.  

Closing breath means at first one breath, two breaths do not exit,  
Then ten breaths, hundred breaths do not exit,  
Gradually forever not exiting, qi moves inward.  

Thinking spirit means sometimes silently facing the Heavenly Emperor,  
Sometimes climbing ladder to manifest saint,  
Sometimes spirit exits from fontanel,  
Sometimes spirit exits from bright hall—many such ways.  

At first difficult, later smooth path,  
After many years, also able to send out yin spirit to roam,  
But only lonely yin.  

Qi and blood decline, abandoning this body to enter that body,  
What benefit to nature and destiny?

#### Four

Buddhists teach people to cultivate ultimate bliss,  
Only because ultimate bliss is the metal direction.  
Mostly form and appearance are this truth,  
The other two are not true, mere false measure.  

Ultimate bliss is in the west, west is metal’s direction;  
In man it is firm real knowing’s passion.  

This passion is firm and pure,  
Hard for all things to move,  
Like metal’s nature utmost firm,  
Enduring and unspoiled.  

Cultivating ultimate bliss is cultivating this real knowing’s true gold.  
True gold refined, both firm and soft,  
Impurities all transformed, body shining bright,  
Becoming the supreme treasure.  

Long ago, the lamp burner cultivated it,  
Forming a translucent precious pagoda;  
Shakyamuni cultivated it,  
Forming an eighteen-foot golden body,  
Mostly among form and appearance.  

Only refining this firm real knowing’s passion is the true treasure.  
Besides this, the other two are not true, mere false measure.

#### Five

Common folk say always unite with the supreme dao,  
Should seek carefully within it.  
If you seek daily use in reverse,  
All earth’s dust and sand become treasure.  

The dao is not far from man,  
Man’s dao is far from man.  

The way of nature and destiny is the constant way.  
The constant way is the way of daily use,  
Only the common people use it without knowing.  

To cultivate nature and destiny,  
One must exhaust the constant way’s principle.  

If you can carefully exhaust the principle,  
No need to read a thousand scriptures and ten thousand texts,  
Even common words and sayings contain great heavenly secrets.  

For example, to call a good person:  
"An honest person, a proper person, with conscience, with heavenly principle, with dignity, knowing contentment, knowing advance and retreat, considering before and after, well-rounded, feet firmly on the ground."  

To call a bad person:  
"Not a person, no conscience, no heavenly principle, harming others for self, deceitful, dark-hearted, harming heaven and principle, taking suffering as joy, false as true, careless, forgetful, not knowing life or death, not knowing good or bad, only knowing one side, not the other, only knowing self, not others."  

Such words spoken without intent, played with for flavor,  
Why not pick one or two from these common sayings,  
Study deeply, find openings and insights?  

It is in daily use and practice,  
Seeking in reverse,  
All earth’s dust and sand become true treasure,  
Every point is the way, left or right, none unsuitable.  

The world’s learners all say the dao cannot be spoken,  
Unwilling to put in real effort,  
Exhaust nature and destiny’s principle;  
Also unable to humble themselves to ask teachers and friends;  
Even if they ask, not honest or serious;  
Having nothing, seeking treasure with empty hands.  

Such behavior, even if one spends a lifetime as a monk,  
Traveling the ends of the earth,  
What use is it?
