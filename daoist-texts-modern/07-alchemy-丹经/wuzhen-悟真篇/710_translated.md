# Awakening to the True Nature: Direct Point of the Nature Sect, Volume Four

The Nature Sect is the outer collection of the *Awakening to the True* treatise. After the Immortal Elder composed the *Awakening to the True* treatise, he still feared that the original source of direct intuitive nature had not been fully explored. Therefore, he added songs, ballads, and miscellaneous verses at the end of the volume, to provide a complete path for the dual cultivation of nature and life.

### Four Quatrains

**First**

The Tathāgata’s wondrous body fills the sands of rivers,  
Countless phenomena arrayed without hindrance or veil.  
Grasping the perfect, universal, true Dharma eye,  
One then knows the Three Realms are but my home.

The Tathāgata—He neither comes from anywhere nor goes anywhere; He is the nature of true emptiness. True emptiness is not empty, hence His body is supremely wondrous. The nature of true emptiness originally has no form, but because it contains wondrous existence within, wondrousness is taken as its body alone. If it were empty without wonder, it would be the silent, stubborn void—not the true nature of the Tathāgata. How then could it fill the sands of rivers? How could countless phenomena be unhindered and unveiled? Because it is wondrous and not empty, its body fills the sands of rivers and is everywhere permeable; because it is empty yet truly so, countless phenomena arrayed cannot hinder or veil it; because it fills the sands of rivers without obstruction, it is called the universal Dharma eye. Circular means no head or tail, no back or face, no front or rear, no above or below, no inside or outside—just like the Tathāgata. Universal means everywhere present, manifesting at all times; vast enough to fill Heaven and Earth, subtle as a single hair—this is the wondrous body. Only circular can be universal; only universal can be circular. Radiant and bright, illuminating all circumstances, none can harm it; thus one attains the Dharma eye, the very treasury of the true Dharma eye. Grasping this universal Dharma eye is to personally behold the wondrous body of the Tathāgata, neither form nor emptiness, both form and emptiness; Heaven and Hell alike are swept away. The Three Realms are but one family; the Ten Directions are the entire body.

**Second**

Look and you cannot see its form;  
Call and it answers back.  
Do not say this sound is like an echo in a valley—  
If there were no valley, how could sound arise?

Look and no form is seen—this is emptiness; call and it answers—this is existence. Because of emptiness, there is existence, like an echo in a valley; empty but not empty, this seems like the wondrous body of the Tathāgata. Yet the wondrous body is always empty and always existent, always existent and always empty; why must one call for it to answer? That it answers when called means emptiness still remains. If emptiness remains, it is still bound by emptiness. Empty but not permeable is not the wondrous body of the Tathāgata. Better to shatter this emptiness with one blow. Emptiness that is nowhere empty—how can sound arise? If there is no sound, then there is no emptiness; no emptiness, no sound—great liberation, great freedom, lively and vivid. The saying “Atop a hundred-foot pole, one does not move others” means that although one has entered, it is not yet true; advancing further atop the hundred-foot pole, the Ten Directions world is the whole body.

**Third**

One thing contains hearing, seeing, awareness, knowing—  
All the dusty realms reveal its mechanism.  
Spirit always one thing, yet still not existent—  
On what do the four rely to have place?

Hearing, seeing, awareness, and knowing—all are bright and numinous, born from the one consciousness. Because this one thing is always numinous, among the dusty realms the four arise as comrades, never a moment of peace. If one can remove this ever-present numinous one thing, then the four have no support and vanish by themselves. All deluded people cannot recognize that the Tathāgata’s original nature is true emptiness and wondrous existence. They mistake the bright numinous consciousness for reality, either rejecting this thing or clinging to this one thing. Little do they know this thing is the root of birth and death, the seed of kalpa reincarnation. If this one thing is not uprooted, how can one recognize the Tathāgata’s original nature? This is the root of birth and death through countless kalpas; fools call it the original person.

**Fourth**

Not moving a step, one arrives in the Western Heaven,  
Sitting upright, all directions appear before the eyes.  
Light behind the neck is still illusion;  
Clouds forming beneath the feet are not yet immortals.

The Tathāgata’s original nature has no head or tail, no back or face; approaching it, one cannot see its head, following it, one cannot see its rear. Speaking of its existence, it seems absent; speaking of its absence, it yet exists. It does not fall into the forms of existence or nonexistence. Its light penetrates the hidden and reveals the clear, illuminating the three thousand great thousand worlds—this is the natural wondrous awareness, not something attained by sitting. All who practice meditation and sitting focus only on the flow of consciousness, seeing phantom images and false appearances, sometimes dreaming of the Western Heaven, sometimes light appearing behind the neck, sometimes seeing things in dimness, sometimes clouds forming beneath the feet, mistakenly thinking they have attained true fruit and become Buddhas—how far from the truth! Those aspiring to the Dao must first sweep away all side doors and external paths, then in the formless and colorless place seek out the true wondrous awareness, so that the original nature may be attained.

### Hymn to the Nature Ground

Buddha nature neither same nor different,  
A thousand lamps share one light.  
Adding does not mean gain,  
Subtracting does no harm.  
Taking and giving both without fault,  
Burning and drifting cause no injury.  
Hearing, seeing, knowing, perceiving—  
Not one can be measured.

This hymn named “Nature Ground” likens the true nature’s essence to the earth’s immovability and steadfastness. Though circumstances and things differ in myriad ways, one responds with an equal heart, like a thousand lamps shining—different lamps but one light. This nature neither increases nor decreases, neither takes nor gives; fire burns and water drifts, yet neither harms it, just as the earth bears mountains’ weight and endures water’s flow, accommodating all damage. The earth is so, nature is so. Hearing, seeing, knowing, perceiving—none truly exist; forcibly named, they are but emptiness. Emptiness is not silence or extinction, but because things are entrusted to things, responding with no mind, adapting to circumstances.

### Hymn on Birth and Death

Seeking birth is originally birthless,  
Fearing death, when has it ever ceased?  
What eyes see is less than what ears hear,  
What mouth speaks is less than what the nose smells.

The Tathāgata’s original nature is fundamentally birthless and deathless. Those who forcibly seek birth and fear death—when have they truly been born or ceased? Where is birth, there is death; without birth, there is no death. Because this nature is birthless and deathless, it cannot be seen by the eyes, only heard by the ears; cannot be spoken by the mouth, only smelled by the nose. What eyes see and mouth speak belong to the nature of birth and death; what ears hear and nose smell belong to the nature beyond birth and death. The former is not nature; the latter is nature. Seeing what is unseen is true seeing; speaking what is unspoken surpasses speech. This birthless and deathless nature has no head or crown, no back or face; neither existence nor nonexistence, neither emptiness nor form—what is there to see? What is there to say? If one can see or speak, it is not the true empty original nature.

### Hymn on the Three Realms as Mind Alone

The Three Realms are but mind’s wondrous principle,  
All things neither this nor that.  
Not one thing is not my mind,  
Not one thing is truly myself.

The Three Realms are the realm of form, the realm of desire, and the formless realm. The realms of form and desire are realms of mind; the formless realm is without mind. Both with and without mind are not Buddha nature. This hymn names the Three Realms as mind alone—neither existence nor nonexistence; both existence and nonexistence do not stand; all things and self return to emptiness. Mind without mind is called true mind; true mind is one with all things, no distinction between this and that. Not one thing is not my mind means not attached to emptiness; not one thing is myself means not attached to form. Neither attached to emptiness nor form, only one mind. One mind is one nature; mind is Buddha; Buddha is mind.

### Hymn on Seeing Objects as Seeing Mind

Seeing objects is seeing mind; without objects, mind does not appear.  
Through all the Ten Directions, true mind pervades without exception.  
If knowledge and understanding arise, it becomes inverted view.  
To behold objects without mind is to see the face of Bodhi.

Seeing objects as seeing mind, without objects mind does not appear—this is the mind of the knowing and conscious person. Through all the Ten Directions, true mind pervades without exception—this is the true mind without knowing or consciousness. The human mind arises and ceases depending on objects; true mind’s numinous light is always bright—whether objects exist or not, it is the same, pervading all Ten Directions, nowhere absent. It neither arises nor ceases, incomparable to the knowing mind of people. If one uses knowledge and understanding to grasp true mind, it becomes the thief of man, inverted view, greatly mistaken. True mind is round, radiant, pure, bare, and bright, inseparable from all circumstances, unattached to all conditions. One who can behold objects without mind has true mind, the original face of Bodhi, no need to seek it elsewhere. In short, only when there is no human mind can true mind be seen. Once true mind is seen, Bodhi is instantly realized, transcending the other shore.

### Hymn on Equalizing All Things

I am not different from others; others’ minds differ.  
People have kin and strangers; I have no distinctions.  
Water, land, flying creatures—all viewed as one body.  
Noble and lowly, hand and foot are alike.  
I am not myself; how can there be you?  
Both you and I vanish; all bubbles return to water.

This hymn named “Equalizing All Things” shows that distinctions of self and others, kin and stranger, water and land, flying and walking, noble and lowly—all appear as one body. The key line is “I am not myself.” People cannot equalize all things because of the presence of self. If self is absent, how would one know of you? When self and you are both forgotten, all things are empty, and without equality, equality arises by itself.

### Hymn on Mind as Buddha

Buddha is mind, and mind is Buddha; mind and Buddha have always been illusions.  
If you know no Buddha and no mind, then you have the true thusness Dharma-body Buddha.  
The Dharma-body Buddha has no form, one round light containing all phenomena.  
Formless form is true form; formless appearance is real appearance.  
Neither form nor emptiness, neither non-emptiness nor form,  
Neither still nor quiet, neither coming nor going.  
No difference, no sameness, no existence, no nonexistence,  
Hard to grasp, hard to give up, hard to hear or see.  
Inside and outside, perfectly clear and everywhere permeable,  
One Buddha realm contained in one grain of sand.  
One grain of sand contains the great thousand worlds;  
One body and mind have myriad forms.  
To know this, you must grasp the no-mind Dharma,  
Unstained and untrapped, pure karma.  
Good and evil in a thousand ways, doing nothing,  
That is Namo and Kāśyapa.

This hymn emphasizes the line “To know this, you must grasp the no-mind Dharma.” No-mind is not dull, blank mindlessness. If it were dull mindlessness, like carved wood or molded clay, how could mind be Buddha? The meaning of no-mind is not attachment to form, not attachment to emptiness. True mind has no form or shape, originally nothing—what form could it have? True mind’s light contains all phenomena, perfectly universal and unobstructed—what emptiness could it have? Neither form nor emptiness, round and bright, pure and bare, radiant and red—mind is Buddha, Buddha is mind, neither mind nor Buddha. Thus it says, “Buddha is mind, and mind is Buddha,” and also “Mind and Buddha have always been illusions.” Recognizing mind as Buddha, yet knowing it is neither mind nor Buddha, and grasping the no-mind Dharma, one does not fall into the school of extinction.

### Hymn on No-Mind

Laugh at my mind, so stubborn and foolish.  
Restless and bustling, letting things come and go.  
Not understanding cultivation, nor creating sin.  
Never benefiting others, nor seeking self.  
Not holding precepts, nor obeying taboos.  
Not knowing rites or music, nor practicing benevolence or righteousness.  
Human abilities, none in a hundred.  
When hungry, eat; when thirsty, drink.  
When tired, sleep; when awake, walk.  
When hot, wear light clothes; when cold, cover with blankets.  
No thoughts or worries, no sorrow or joy.  
No regrets or schemes, no intention or will.  
All life’s honor and disgrace, but a waystation.  
Birds roosting in the forest, also a fitting comparison.  
Come but do not stop; go but do not block.  
Neither avoiding nor seeking, no praise or blame.  
Not weary of ugliness, nor envious of beauty.  
Not rushing to quiet rooms, nor fleeing noisy markets.  
Not speaking ill of others, nor boasting of self.  
Not favoring the noble, nor despising the lowly.  
Loving friends and enemies, great and small, inside and outside.  
Sorrow, joy, gain, loss, respect, insult, danger, ease—  
Mind holds no two views, calmly one and equal.  
Not seeking fortune first, nor fearing misfortune’s start.  
Responding only when moved, rising again when pressed.  
Not fearing blades, how fear tiger cubs?  
Following things’ names, how bind by words?  
Eyes do not chase form, ears do not take in sound.  
All forms belong to falsehood and deceit.  
Male and female forms and sounds are not fixed essence.  
Essence and form without mind, unstained and untrapped.  
Free and unbound, nothing can burden.  
Wondrous awareness, light and round, shining inside and out.  
Enfolding the six extremes, no near or far.  
Light yet not light, like the moon on water.  
Taking or giving is difficult, what can compare?  
Understanding this wondrous function, far beyond others.  
If asked what it follows, this alone suffices.

This hymn repeatedly speaks of no-mind. The wonder lies in one no-mind. In the dust it can transcend dust; in the world it can transcend the world; free and unbound, nothing can burden it. The human heart cannot tolerate even a speck of dust; if even a speck remains, countless human minds arise. Human mind arises and falls, shifting here and there; the body is no longer master, and the self is absent, the slave becomes master. How can one be free and unbound? If one can hold to complete no-mind, unmoving and unshaken, that is freedom. Being present, free and self-mastering, all worries cease, all attachments vanish, wondrous awareness is round and bright, shining inside and out, enfolding the six extremes, no near or far—truly free and wondrous is the function of no-mind.

### Hymn on the Heart Sutra

Aggregates, truths, roots, dust, emptiness, and form—  
None has a single Dharma to speak of.  
All inverted views are ended,  
The silent body naturally rests.

Aggregates are the five aggregates: form, feeling, perception, volition, consciousness; truths are the four truths: suffering, origin, cessation, path; roots are the six roots: eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, mind; dusts are the six dusts: form, sound, smell, taste, touch, Dharma; emptiness is cessation; form is attachment to appearance. These six—aggregates, truths, roots, dusts, emptiness, and form—are all mind-born Dharmas, all inverted views. If one can sweep them all away, the mind-body is silent and still; this is Avalokiteśvara Bodhisattva, this is Śāriputra, neither born nor destroyed. If even a trace remains among the six, there is birth and death, no freedom. Only upon reaching the birthless, deathless, ever-free state are the six completely pure.

### Hymn on No Sin and Blessings

Walking all day yet never walking,  
Sitting all day yet never sitting.  
Cultivating good but not gaining merit,  
Doing evil yet no sin at all.  
If people do not understand the mind,  
Do not grasp these words and cause confusion.  
After death, one must face Yama,  
Hard to avoid the cauldron, pestle, and mill.

This hymn named “No Sin” asks, what is blessing? Sin and blessing both arise from the mind. Having mind and doing evil is having mind and creating sin; having mind and doing good is having mind and seeking blessing. Good and evil, sin and blessing arise from the mind. When one reaches the no-mind state, walking and sitting are unknown; how to know good and evil? How to know sin and blessing? Thus it says cultivating good does not gain merit, doing evil has no sin. Like an infant, without knowledge or consciousness, laughing, angering, crying, cursing—all arise from no-mind; what merit or sin is there? No-mind means no human mind. Without human mind, there is true mind, whose measure is as vast as Heaven and Earth, embracing all things, thinking neither good nor evil, creating no sin nor seeking blessing. Merit and sin are not counted. If people do not understand true mind and let stubborn mind play, committing countless sins, thinking they have no sin, after death, how can they avoid the cauldron and pestle’s retribution?

### Hymn on Universal Penetration

Seeing true emptiness, empty yet not empty,  
Where is not perfectly universal and clear?  
Roots, dust, mind, and Dharma—all are nothing,  
Only then does wondrous function know sameness with things.

The nature of true emptiness is universally permeable and unobstructed, shining everywhere, nothing can hide. Not empty yet empty, empty yet not empty, only always responsive and always still.

### Hymn on Following Others

All things spread before the eyes,  
Following their movement and stillness, letting them take their course.  
Universal clarity, concentration, and wisdom never stained,  
Like water from a lotus, the lotus remains dry.

Though this hymn is only four lines, its meaning is the phrase “Universal clarity, concentration, and wisdom never stained.” Universal clarity is wondrous existence; concentration and wisdom are true emptiness. True emptiness naturally exists in all things, yet is unstained by them. The wonder is naturally encountering all things and responding to all things. Always responsive and always still, at ease wherever, like a lotus emerging from water yet remaining dry.

### Hymn of the Precious Moon

One bright moon wheel hangs in empty space,  
Its clear light unobstructed over myriad lands.  
Gather it and its light does not cluster; push it and its light does not scatter.  
Forward it does not advance; backward it does not retreat.  
Neither distant nor near, neither outside nor inside.  
Sameness within difference, difference within sameness—  
Tell me, puppet, can you understand?

The Tathāgata’s true empty nature, wondrous awareness and universal penetration, shines upon all like a bright moon wheel in the sky, illuminating all lands and islands with radiance. Gather it, and its light does not cluster; push it, and its light does not scatter; forward, no advance; backward, no retreat. Illuminating that, no distance is seen; illuminating this, no nearness is seen; the light’s surface is not outside, its interior not inside. Gathering, pushing, forward, backward, distance, nearness, surface, interior, inside, outside—though the illumination varies, the light is the same. Sameness within difference, difference within sameness; one root scattering into myriad forms, myriad forms returning to one root. Spreading, it fills the six directions; rolling up, it retreats and hides in secrecy—lively and vivid, like playing with puppets.

### Pearl-Gathering Song

A poor man’s pearl in his clothes,  
Originally wondrous and bright.  
Unable to seek it himself,  
Counting others’ treasures instead.  
Counting others’ treasures is no use,  
Only teaching you to waste effort.  
Better to recognize your own treasure,  
Worth billions in gold.  
This pearl’s light is greatest,  
Illuminating the three thousand great thousand worlds.  
Never lessening by a fraction,  
Only obscured by passing clouds.  
Since recognizing this Mani,  
Who loves bubbles and empty flowers more?  
Buddha’s pearl is the same as my pearl,  
My nature returns to the sea of Buddha nature.  
Pearl is not pearl, sea is not sea,  
Calm heart embraces the Dharma realm.  
Let the noisy dust fill your eyes,  
Universal clarity and wisdom always free.  
Not empty, not form,  
Inside and outside bright and unobstructed.  
Six supernatural powers, wondrous and endless,  
Benefiting self and others, who can understand the limits?  
See it and all is done,  
Beyond learning and doing, crossing all day.  
Calm as an unborn infant,  
Moving and resting follow conditions, no fixed necessity.  
No breaking of delusion, no forging of truth,  
True and false mind all belong to dust.  
All Dharmas have no form,  
Within formlessness is Dharma body.  
Dharma body is the innate Buddha,  
Neither human nor thing.  
Vastly filling Heaven and Earth,  
Only mystery and confusion.  
Stain does not taint, light shines by itself,  
No Dharma arises outside the mind.  
If mind does not arise, Dharma self-extinguishes,  
Then know sin and blessing have no form.  
No Buddha to cultivate, no Dharma to speak,  
A man’s wisdom sees naturally apart.  
Speaking is like a lion’s roar,  
Not like wild children debating birth and death.

This song emphasizes “If mind does not arise, Dharma self-extinguishes.” Dharma here is not Buddha Dharma, but the myriad thoughts and delusions in the mind. If mind does not arise, all Dharmas are empty, the nature pearl always bright, universal clarity and wisdom bright, inside and outside bright, bubbles and empty flowers—why cling to them? Even if dust fills the eyes, it cannot obstruct; beyond learning and doing, like an unborn infant, moving and resting follow conditions, no true or false illusions. Dharma body always revealed, innate Buddha appears, filling Heaven and Earth, shining on the great thousand worlds—what cloud can block it?

### Song of Meditation and Concentration’s Guidance

The Tathāgata’s meditative nature is like water,  
Its body still, wind and waves cease by themselves.  
Rising and resting, always clear and pure,  
Not only when sitting is it so.  
Nowadays people sit still to attain proof,  
Not knowing it all depends on seeing nature.  
If nature and seeing are clear,  
Seeing turns to nature and settles itself.  
Concentration becomes wisdom with endless use,  
This is called the Buddha’s supernatural power.  
If you want to understand its essence and use,  
Just see the empty space in all directions.  
In emptiness, nothing exists,  
Nor mystery or confusion.  
Mystery and confusion cannot be sought;  
Seeking them leads to error and loss.  
Only these two words, error and loss,  
Cannot be clung to as proof.  
Original mind is still empty space,  
How can gain or loss be predicted?  
Just send away all Dharmas,  
Make them pure and complete without remainder.  
Suddenly universal clarity appears,  
Then no different from all Buddhas.  
The body is my fetters,  
Let it blend with light and mix with the world.  
All actions without mind,  
Why care for right or wrong, honor or disgrace?  
Life’s body is but a temporary lodging,  
The innkeeper called Vairocana.  
Vairocana neither comes nor goes,  
Then know birth and death have no remainder.  
If asked what Vairocana is like,  
Only that it has form, not no form.  
Dust and karma before the eyes,  
Neither same nor different.  
Seeing this dust and karma,  
Each is Shakyamuni and Kāśyapa.  
Difference is all sounds; sameness is one wind.  
If you want to recognize the Mani,  
Do not say “I know the Dharma.”  
If sick, use other medicine;  
If cured, no more medicine needed.  
Mind confused needs Dharma light;  
Mind awakened needs no Dharma.  
Like a dim mirror polished,  
Stains naturally vanish.  
Originally all Dharmas are false,  
So let go of all appearances.  
What is it like when appearances are gone?  
This is called the ultimate true unsurpassed.  
If you want to adorn Buddha lands,  
Practice equality and compassion to save suffering.  
Though Bodhi’s original vow is deep,  
Do not grasp within appearances.  
This is the perfection of blessing and wisdom,  
In the future receiving prediction first.  
Cut off all dust and stains,  
Then no affinity with Buddhas.  
Think again of deluded ordinary people,  
All stained by dust and love.  
Because of greed and attachment,  
Always born as fetus, egg, or moist being.  
Learning the Dao requires fierce effort,  
A heart without passion, hard as iron.  
Even with children, wives, and concubines,  
How different from others?  
Always guard one round light,  
No desire or thought to measure.  
All Dharmas unattached at once,  
Why speak of hell or heaven?  
Then my life is mine,  
No rising or falling in emptiness.  
Coming and going in Buddha lands,  
Not departing from Bodhi’s original seat.  
Guanyin’s thirty-two manifestations,  
I too shall verify among them.  
Manifestations inconceivable,  
All arising from the free nature.  
I am the no-mind meditation guest,  
In all things unable to choose.  
Once a black ox,  
Today my body is all white.  
Sometimes I sing and laugh to myself,  
Others say I’m a little crazy.  
Who knows the clothed form,  
Holds priceless treasure within?  
If you see me talk of emptiness,  
It seems like chaos swallowing dates.  
This Dharma only Buddhas know,  
Fools cannot understand the surface.  
Some meditation masters only learn to argue,  
Boasting quick answers and sharp words,  
Yet do not know the master.  
They pick branches and leaves,  
Not understanding the root.  
With root, branches flourish; without root, branches cannot survive.  
They flaunt their grasp of the spiritual pearl,  
Caught in the difficulty of self and other.  
Far from my wondrous source of awareness,  
Thousands of miles apart.  
Such people are pitiful and laughable,  
Talking for years about learning the Dao.  
Prideful and unwilling to ask,  
Wasting a lifetime growing old in vain.  
They are fools with dull roots,  
Evil views and heavy karma as cause.  
If in this life they do not awaken,  
How can they avoid sinking in the next?

This song, over one hundred words, is all about “The Tathāgata’s meditative nature is like water, its body still, wind and waves cease by themselves, rising and resting always clear and pure, not only when sitting.” The Tathāgata’s meditative nature is supremely pure, clear as water, without stirring wind or waves, unstained by dust. Whether rising or resting, it is this nature, not only when sitting. Those who take sitting as meditation have not true meditation, but silent stubborn emptiness meditation—not the Tathāgata’s meditative nature. True meditation combines concentration and wisdom, wondrous use without end, forgetting both mind and Dharma, leaving all appearances, adorning Buddha lands, practicing equality and compassion, blending light with the world, arising from dust yet beyond dust, not meditating yet meditating, not fixed yet fixed. All those who sit still to seek proof, with closed mouths and sealed lips, do not know the master—wild foxes, meditation dullness confuses clarity, clarity confuses ignorance. How could they know the wondrous source of awareness, true meditation nature?

### Song on Reading the Collected Works of Chan Master Xuedou Zuying

The Cao Creek’s one stream divides into a thousand branches,  
Illuminating ancient and clear present without hindrance.  
Lately learners do not exhaust the source,  
Falsely pointing to Tiwa as the great sea.  
Master Xuedou reached the true meaning,  
Great thunderous sound beating the Dharma drum.  
The lion king roars from his den,  
Hundreds of beasts and thousands of demons all fear.  
Sometimes singing poems, sometimes speaking words,  
Urgently guiding lost people’s path.  
Words frank and deep in meaning,  
Striking jade and gold, sounding through the ages.  
Alas, lost people chase circumstances,  
Yet seek names and numbers in words.  
True thusness and precious form have no words,  
No high or low, no boundaries.  
Neither form nor emptiness, nor two bodies,  
Ten directions’ dusty worlds one round wheel.  
Right concentration never divides speech or silence,  
Cannot grasp or release.  
Just do not cling to appearances,  
That is the Tathāgata’s true grasp.  
To remove delusions, present truth,  
If delusions do not arise, truth also darkens.  
Knowing both truth and delusion are not,  
Only then true mind is unblocked.  
Unblocked and free, able to be free,  
One awakening instantly erases kalpa sins.  
No effort needed to attain Bodhi,  
From then on forever free from birth and death sea.  
My master recently spoke plainly,  
Staying in the world as example.  
Last night I called him forward,  
Pierced his nostrils and placed a staff.  
Asked him what is the first meaning,  
He said all words are slander.

Though this song praises the Collected Works of Zuying, it actually transmits the true thusness form. The phrase “Just do not cling to appearances, that is the Tathāgata’s true grasp” sums up the main meaning. Not clinging is no-mind; no-mind means no arising of truth and delusion; no arising means no blockage; no blockage means freedom; freedom means true form always remains, forever free from birth and death sea. The line “Last night I called him forward, pierced his nostrils and placed a staff” is the Immortal Elder’s hidden meaning. Think: calling forward—calling what? Piercing nostrils—what is that? Calling forward means calling the true thusness real nature; piercing nostrils means piercing the mind that is neither form nor emptiness. Realizing this nature, knowing this mind, staff in hand, propping heaven above and earth below, no back or face, round and bright, pure and bare, radiant and red—this is the first meaning from the West, what more to say?

### Understanding Precepts, Concentration, and Wisdom

Precepts, concentration, and wisdom are the wondrous functions in the Dharma. Though the Buddhas and Patriarchs have spoken, those who have not reached it still cling. Now briefly speaking, to help open awakening. Their mind and境 (environment) both forgotten, one thought unmoving is precepts; awakened nature perfectly clear, inside and outside pure is concentration; responding to conditions with wondrous use without end is wisdom. These three mutually require each other to form, mutually embodying and functioning. The three never separate even for a moment. Like the sun borrowing light to shine, light borrowing shining to illuminate. Without light, no shining; without shining, no illumination. Precepts, concentration, and wisdom all come from one nature; light and illumination come from one sun; one is not one, how much less three? When all three are forgotten, pure and clear.

The Immortal Elder’s explanation has already entered the samadhi of precepts, concentration, and wisdom; his words are concise, his meaning clear. If learners can practice, they can directly cross to the other shore. Yet though the Elder’s words are clear, he still fears learners’ understanding is insufficient, their strength lacking, unable to advance and awaken to the origin. Now a further annotation is given, to guide learners from shallow to deep, from low to high, so they may succeed.

Precepts mean forgetting feelings toward circumstances, unstained by all dust. Concentration means utmost sincerity without delusion, unmoving and unshifting. Wisdom means adapting to circumstances, neither biased nor partial. Able in precepts, concentration, and wisdom, the three mutually require each other, from effort to naturalness, blending into one nature, returning to the state of unknowing and pure knowledge. Actually, upon reaching purity, one nature is no longer one, so how can there be three precepts, concentration, and wisdom? Thus it says all three forgotten, pure and clear. If at purity, the three must be used; once at purity, the three also naturally blend. Not forgetting the three is not pure concentration. The hymn says: “When mind is confused, one needs Dharma light; when mind awakens, one needs no more.” This means forgetting mind and Dharma, thus leaving all appearances. This is the meaning of forgetting all three.

### Twelve Verses of the West River Moon

**First**

Illusions no longer forcibly extinguished,  
Truth why must be sought?  
Original source is self-nature Buddha, cultivated equally,  
Delusion and awakening not bound by before or after.  
Awakening is instant Buddha-hood,  
Delusion is endless kalpa wandering.  
If one can in one thought accord with true cultivation,  
All the sands of sin and defilement are extinguished.

Original source self-nature is Buddha nature. Buddha nature has neither delusion nor true thusness. Only because people have delusion and awakening do the names delusion and true thusness arise. Delusion is self-nature producing delusion; awakening is self-nature returning to true thusness. Awakening to true thusness is instant Buddha-hood; producing delusion is endless kalpa wandering. Delusion and true thusness exist only between delusion and awakening. If one forcibly extinguishes without awakening, seeking true thusness, how can one see true thusness? The last line says, “If one can in one thought accord with true cultivation, all the sands of sin and defilement are extinguished,” which is clear.

**Second**

Originally birthless and deathless,  
Forcibly seeking birth and death distinctions.  
Just like sin and blessing have no root,  
Wondrous body never increases or decreases.  
I have one bright mirror,  
Always clouded by darkness.  
Today polished bright to illuminate Heaven and Earth,  
All phenomena clearly revealed, hard to hide.

Originally true thusness Buddha nature is birthless and deathless, neither increasing nor decreasing. Because of dusty attachments, birth and death arise, like a bright mirror clouded by darkness. If one can polish away the accumulated stains and old dust, it remains a perfect bright object. Using it to illuminate Heaven and Earth, all phenomena are clearly revealed—how can birth and death be?

**Third**

My nature enters all Buddha natures,  
All Buddha natures are the same.  
Tall cold shadows reflect cold springs,  
One moon shines on a thousand pools.  
Small as a hair no one knows,  
Large enough to fill the three thousand worlds.  
High and low not bound by square or round,  
Why speak of length, depth, or shallowness?

My nature and Buddha nature, all nations and peoples, have no difference. In saints it does not increase; in ordinary people it does not decrease. Like one bright moon shining on a thousand pools. This nature can be small or large, high or low, square or round, shallow or deep, long or short. It does not fall into the marks of size, height, shape, or measure. Ordinary people use it daily but do not know.

**Fourth**

Dharma, Dharma, Dharma, originally no Dharma,  
Emptiness, emptiness, emptiness, also not emptiness.  
Stillness, noise, speech, silence—all originally the same,  
Why bother speaking of dreams within dreams?  
There is use in use without use,  
No merit in merit yet merit is done.  
Like fruit ripening naturally on the tree,  
Do not ask how to cultivate the seed.

The Tathāgata’s Dharma is truly no Dharma; his emptiness is truly not emptiness. Dharma without Dharma is true Dharma; emptiness not empty is true emptiness. True Dharma and true emptiness, stillness and noise, speech and silence, unknowable and unknowing, only following Heaven’s law. What Dharma to speak of? What emptiness to talk about? Forcibly speaking Dharma or emptiness is like speaking of dreams within dreams. Do you know the true Dharma and emptiness nature? It is still and unmoving, responsive and permeable. “There is use in use without use” means Dharma is originally empty; “No merit in merit yet merit is done” means emptiness contains Dharma. Dharma is empty; emptiness has Dharma; neither real nor false, perfectly bright and unclouded, naturally transforming. Like fruit ripening on the tree, it has its day. This is cultivating the true seed of Buddha nature; no need to ask how to cultivate.

**Fifth**

Good and evil forgotten in one moment,  
Honor and disgrace no concern.  
Dark and light, hidden and revealed, floating and sinking,  
Following fate, eating when hungry, drinking when thirsty.  
Spirit still, clear, always silent,  
No hindrance to sitting, lying, singing, or chanting.  
A pool of autumn water, green and deep,  
Wind stirs—do not fear the ripples.

The main meaning is “Spirit still, clear, always silent, no hindrance to sitting, lying, singing, or chanting.” Spirit is still, so good and evil, honor and disgrace, dark and light, hidden and revealed, floating and sinking, all do not enter the heart. Following fate day by day, sitting, lying, singing, and chanting, free and at ease, no thought or worry, like a pool of autumn water, green and deep. Though wind blows, no waves arise; what cause for fear or alarm?

**Sixth**

No need to forcibly extinguish when facing circumstances,  
Names are provisional to establish Bodhi.  
Form and emptiness, brightness and darkness, originally equal,  
Truth and delusion cease dividing two bodies.  
Awakening instantly clarifies the Pure Land,  
No more India or Cao Creek.  
Who says Ultimate Bliss is in the Western Heaven?  
Realizing it, Amitābha appears in the world.

The Tathāgata’s original nature is round, bright, pure, and red. Neither form nor emptiness, neither bright nor dark, neither true nor false. Awakening to it one instantly becomes Buddha; no need to forcibly extinguish dust when facing the mirror. Because many do not awaken, Buddha and Bodhisattva are provisional names to establish Bodhi, guiding people gradually to sudden enlightenment and Buddha fruit. Bodhi means the right path, returning from error to truth, gradually awakening.

**Seventh**

People, I, sentient beings, and lifespan—  
Why divide self and other, high and low?  
Dharma naturally illuminates without me or you,  
No need to seek in every thought.  
Seeing is never truly seeing,  
Hearing is not necessarily hearing no.  
All functions have no mutual knowing,  
Who can hinder birth and death?

People, I, sentient beings, and lifespan—differences of self and other, high and low, seeing and hearing, right and wrong, are all false appearances. If one can universally illuminate and see through these, surrendering to not knowing, birth is so, death is so, birth is acceptable, death is acceptable, birth and death have no hindrance—thus naturally ending birth and death.

**Eighth**

Dwelling in form, cultivating giving,  
Rebirth and reward not apart from Heaven and humans.  
Like shooting arrows at floating clouds,  
Falling only because strength is exhausted.  
Better to be formless true thusness,  
Returning to simplicity and purity.  
Forgetting circumstances and feelings, following nature,  
To realize the patience of the birthless Dharma.

Formless form is true form. True form does not come from dwelling in form, cultivating giving, or reward. It arises from returning to simplicity and purity; from forgetting circumstances and feelings arises nature. Knowing true form, every movement and stillness is nature, naturally gaining the patience of the birthless Dharma. The *Śūraṅgama Sūtra* says: “Such a person attains the patience of the birthless Dharma.” The commentary says true thusness is called birthless, Dharma is without leak, true wisdom is called patience.

**Ninth**

If fish and rabbit return to hand,  
Naturally forget traps and snares.  
Crossing the river on raft or ladder to heaven,  
Upon arrival all are abandoned.  
Before awakening, must rely on words,  
After awakening, words become false.  
Though these four lines belong to non-action,  
Still must transcend them.

Traps catch fish; once fish are caught, forget the trap. Snares catch rabbits; once escaped, forget the snare. Rafts cross rivers; once crossed, abandon the raft. Ladders climb heights; once atop, abandon the ladder. Likewise, words distinguish principle; once principle is realized, forget words. Yet forgetting traps, snares, rafts, and ladders, though teaching the true nature of awakening and belonging to non-action, cannot be empty emptiness non-action to finish. If only empty emptiness non-action, how to obtain the realm of true thusness and wondrous awareness? One must transcend this non-action to deeply cultivate and attain.

**Tenth**

Having awakened, do not seek extinction,  
Follow conditions and accept the confused masses.  
Cut off notions of permanence and impermanence,  
Skillfully point to the actual.  
Five eyes, three bodies, four wisdoms,  
Six perfections and myriad practices cultivated equally.  
One round bright Mani is good,  
Benefiting others and oneself.

Buddhism’s Dharma prioritizes awakening nature; awakening is not empty and idle. One must bring this emptiness to reality; only then is it true Buddha nature. Hence: “Having awakened, do not seek extinction; follow conditions and accept the confused masses.” Accepting the confused masses is precisely practicing skillful means and establishing merit. The five eyes are heavenly eye, wisdom eye, Dharma eye, Buddha eye, and flesh eye. The three bodies are pure Dharma body, perfect reward body, and myriad transformation bodies. The four wisdoms are great perfect mirror wisdom, equality nature wisdom, wondrous observation wisdom, and accomplishing wisdom. The six perfections are giving, precepts, patience, diligence, meditation, and wisdom. The myriad practices are all skillful means and merits. Cultivating both inside and outside, true thusness nature becomes ever clearer. Like one Mani pearl, shining brightly, penetrating hidden and manifest, benefiting others and oneself—how can it be mere emptiness?

**Eleventh**

I see people nowadays speak of nature,  
Only boasting quick replies to occasions.  
When encountering circumstances, they become confused,  
No different from fools.  
What is spoken must be practiced,  
Only then are words and deeds without fault.  
Able to wield the wisdom sword to cut the Mani,  
This is called the Tathāgata’s true wisdom.

This verse emphasizes “Able to wield the wisdom sword to cut the Mani, this is called the Tathāgata’s true wisdom.” The Tathāgata’s true wisdom is everywhere permeable, the wisdom sword. Because true wisdom can remove delusion and return to sincerity, it is called the wisdom sword; because true wisdom is perfectly bright and never dark, always present, it is called the Mani. Cutting the Mani is not severing, but taking, not letting the radiance go outward. As essence, it is Mani; as function, it is wisdom sword. Wisdom sword, Mani, and true wisdom are one, not three. This true wisdom is not spoken, but must be practiced and refined to be true. If the body cannot act, only mouth speaks, quick wit replies, thinking this is seeing nature, yet encountering circumstances immediately confused—what help is it? Hence: “Able to wield the wisdom sword to cut the Mani, this is called the Tathāgata’s true wisdom.” Only words and deeds without fault are true wisdom; quick-tongued replies are not.

**Twelfth**

To understand the birthless wondrous Dao,  
Is none other than seeing the true mind.  
True body has no form nor sound,  
Pure Dharma body is just so.  
This Dao is neither nonexistence nor existence,  
Neither middle nor to be sought.  
Both extremes abandoned from the heart,  
Seeing it is called the highest grade.

Seeing the true mind is the wondrous Dao; no need to seek the Dao elsewhere. True mind is unstained and unattached, unmoving and unshaken, formless and soundless, also called pure Dharma body—it is mind, it is body. Neither existence nor nonexistence, both existence and nonexistence cannot be sought in existence or nonexistence, nor taken from neither existence nor nonexistence. If all three are negated, what is left? Seeing this, one instantly transcends birthlessness, called the supreme highest vehicle wondrous Dao. True body and true mind are originally one. Speaking of essence is true body; speaking of function is true mind. Essence and function are one; body and mind mixed as one; form and spirit both wondrous, united with Dao, is this not birthlessness?

### Appendix:

Reading the *Zhou Yi Cantong Qi*

The great elixir’s wondrous use governs Heaven and Earth,  
Heaven and Earth move, and the Five Phases divide.  
When the Five Phases follow, the constant Dao brings birth and death;  
When the Five Phases reverse, the elixir body is always numinous and eternal.  
One arises from void without sign,  
Two agencies open the root from one.  
Four images never separate two bodies,  
Eight trigrams interrelate as parent and child.  
All phenomena arise from change and movement,  
Fortune, misfortune, regret, and blame are thus divided.  
Common people use daily but do not know,  
Sages can investigate the source.  
Thus the Way of Yi wonderfully exhausts Heaven and Earth’s principle,  
Entrusting images to this text.  
When negation and affirmation meet, yin and yang rise and fall;  
When difficulty and ignorance arise, movement and stillness come and go.  
Kan and Li are male and female, water and fire;  
Zhen and Dui are dragon and tiger, soul and spirit.  
Holding the center brings yellow robes and great fortune;  
Meeting excess brings no position or honor.  
Not yet careful of all things’ beginning and end,  
Again meeting the two qi’s return and rush.  
Moon wanes and waxes, responding to spirit’s decline and rise;  
Sun rises and sets, combining honor and guard’s cold and warmth.  
Words are established to clarify images; once images are grasped, forget words.  
Like setting images to point meaning,  
Realizing true meaning discards images.  
The enlightened are simple and easy;  
The confused grow more bewildered and complex.  
Therefore, those cultivating truth and reading the *Cantong Qi*  
Should not be stuck on images or words.

### Song Presented to Daoist Liu of White Dragon Cave

Jade runs, gold flies, two lights busy,  
First hearing flowers bloom, then autumn frost.  
Vainly boasting of a thousand-year lifespan,  
Like a flash of lightning in the clouds.  
One flash of lightning, how swift!  
A hundred years are but thirty thousand days.  
Between cold and heat, they torment and roast,  
Unnoticed, youthful face darkens in secret.  
Though children and grandchildren fill the eyes,  
Love turns to entanglement and binding.  
When essence is exhausted and body withers,  
Who understands how to briefly extend?  
Brief extension, no plan—  
Inevitably the body returns to flowing water.  
Look to ancient sages and worthies,  
How many understood to keep their bodies in the world?  
Though bodies remain, there is a way,  
Only people of the time lack measure.  
Competing to seek herbs in the mountains,  
Subduing lead and mercury to point the elixir sun.  
Pointing the elixir sun is quite different,  
Must seek the red blood in Kan.  
Capture it from the Li position to make Yin essence,  
Combine and harmonize at the right season.  
When the season is right, use a matchmaker,  
Golden Lord and Fair Lady join in marriage.  
Golden Lord prefers to ride the white tiger,  
Fair Lady often drives the red dragon.  
Tiger comes to sit quietly in autumn mountains,  
Dragon rises from the pool with vigor.  
Two beasts meet and fight a battle,  
Waves surge like boiling cauldrons.  
Old Yellow Granny aids the divine power,  
Shaking Heaven and Earth, chasing spirits and ghosts.  
In a moment the battle ends, clouds and rain cease,  
Planting a mysterious pearl in the mud’s bottom.  
From then the root and sprout gradually grow,  
Watering at the right time to embrace true essence.  
Ten months gestation, swallowing into the mouth,  
Unaware the mortal body already has spirit.  
This matter is rare in the world,  
Not something ordinary people can know.  
If in past lives there was no immortal bone,  
How could one easily encounter it?  
Having encountered it, one should refine it,  
Because time is urgent like an arrow.  
To catch fish, one must set nets,  
Do not just stand by the river and sigh.  
Hearing you have known medicine for many years,  
Why not settle your heart and refine mercury and lead?  
Do not let the candle be blown out by wind,  
Do not blame Heaven for the Six Paths’ wheel.  
Nowadays many people are deceitful,  
All wearing plain clothes claiming the Dao.  
Ask them what gold and wood are,  
They fall silent as if dumb.  
They say subdue qi and rest grain,  
There are other gates and long roads.  
Have you not seen the *Breaking Delusion Song* say,  
The Great Unity contains true Dharma best?  
Do not blame harsh words,  
Only making it hard for people to discern.  
Only if your heart is like mine,  
Dare I pour out my heart to you.

### Song of the Stone Bridge

My family originally dwells north of Stone Bridge,  
Mountains guard water passes, dense ancient trees.  
Under the bridge, stream water flows from Kunlun,  
Mountain spring water fragrant and rich.  
My dwelling in the mountain is truly admirable,  
Everywhere planted with trees, no flowers.  
North of the mountain cave hides a fierce tiger,  
Roaring from its den, wind and clouds arise.  
South of the mountain pool hides a flood dragon,  
Rising clouds and rain, mountain mist thick.  
Two beasts meet and fight a battle,  
The primal pearl hidden is an auspicious sign.  
The scene is enviable; I secretly rejoice,  
Pouring and drinking, intoxicated.  
Drunkenly playing a song on a stringless zither,  
Every note teaches carefulness.  
Alas, after drunkenness no one knows,  
Dim and silent, just like a fool.  
Looking up at creation’s wondrous work,  
Sun sets in the west, moon returns east.  
Heaven is Earth, Earth is Heaven,  
Yin and yang repeatedly combine naturally.  
Knowing where the Five Phases invert,  
Pointing to the rising clouds returning to the cave heavens.  
Golden house, white jade official,  
Jade maiden and golden boy serve daily.  
Southern Star and Northern Dipper clearly arranged,  
Countless phenomena appear boundless.  
No day or night, continuous and endless,  
Gathering and dispersing, adjusting the fire’s timing.  
If you ask where the Golden Elixir truly is,  
Seek the master to point out the lead in water.  
Wood produces fire, metal produces water,  
Water and fire must be arranged front and back.  
Distinguish floating and sinking, know host and guest,  
Lead, silver, sand, mercury combine.  
Have hardness and softness, do not be careless,  
Knowing contentment is always content, returning to the root.  
All gods together congratulate the peaceful year,  
Then the country is rich and people rejoice.  
This matter is good reasoning,  
Those of the same path know this meaning.  
Later generations learning cultivation,  
Only speak of preservation and nurturing qi.  
Right before the eyes, very easy,  
Those who take it are wondrous beyond compare.  
First remove sickness and extend life,  
Use fire to cook and transform the yang body.  
Cultivators, abandon thinking of self,  
Do not ask about minor methods of side doors.  
Only know now people deceive,  
Unaware themselves grow dark and withered.  
Advise later learners to be fierce as hawks,  
Do not just abandon home to live elsewhere.  
The wondrous Dao does not leave one’s own body,  
How can it be in a thousand mountains and ten thousand waters?  
Do not procrastinate or be greedy and base,  
Urgently seek master to find the original meaning.  
If in life you do not learn cultivation,  
You do not know what is in the next birth.  
Since you have mind, you must have beginning and end,  
Life’s great matter is birth and death.  
If Heaven neglects the Dao heart person,  
It sends me to the Three Paths as a lowly ghost.
