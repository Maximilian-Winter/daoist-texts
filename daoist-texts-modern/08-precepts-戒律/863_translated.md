# The Twenty-Seven Precepts of the Venerable Lao

The *Twenty-Seven Precepts of the Venerable Lao* arise from the Daoist treasury known as the *Cloud-Treasury of the Seven Registers* (Yunji Qiqian). This sacred teaching unfolds in two grand sections: the Nine Practices and the Twenty-Seven Precepts. These precepts are further divided into the Upper Nine, Middle Nine, and Lower Nine, each tier revealing a distinct measure of spiritual discipline and corresponding fruits.

## The Nine Practices

Walk the path of non-action—move with softness and gentleness, hold to the feminine principle, and do not act first. These are the highest three practices.

Walk the path without name—maintain pure stillness, and promote goodness in others. These are the middle three practices.

Walk the path of loyalty and filial piety—know contentment, and yield with humility. These are the lower three practices.

Together, these nine practices gather into the Daoist abode, where rank and station are equalized. Those who embody all nine practices become immortals; those who fulfill six practices gain longevity; those who fulfill three practices add years to their life.

## The Upper Nine Precepts

Refrain from wasting your spirit and vitality; refrain from consuming blood-bound foods or delighting in their beauty; refrain from harming the sovereign qi. Refrain from coveting treasures and wealth; refrain from forgetting the Dao; refrain from reckless action. Refrain from clinging to superficial forms or names of the Dao; refrain from killing living beings; refrain from craving fame and accomplishment. These are the upper nine precepts.

## The Middle Nine Precepts

Refrain from indulging the senses of ear, eye, nose, and mouth; always practice humility and yielding; attend carefully to all matters without confusion or fear. Refrain from learning corrupt writings; refrain from adorning the body with fine clothes and rich foods; refrain from seeking reputation and honor. Refrain from greed for high rank or strong demands; refrain from rashness; refrain from excess and overflow. These are the middle nine precepts.

## The Lower Nine Precepts

Refrain from disputing with others over right and wrong, gain and loss—avoid such strife; refrain from all evil deeds; refrain from despising poverty and lowliness, or forcibly seeking wealth and honor. Refrain from excessive taboos; refrain from invoking the great names of sages; refrain from arrogance and violence. Refrain from praying to ghosts and spirits; refrain from stubborn self-righteousness; refrain from delighting in warfare. These are the lower nine precepts.

Together, these twenty-seven precepts form the deep wellspring of the Dao, where all ranks walk side by side. Those who fulfill the upper tier become immortals. Those who uphold eighteen precepts gain longevity. Those who hold fast to nine precepts add years to their life and avoid untimely death.
