# The Text on Upholding the Eight Precepts and Fasting

Master Lu of the Song Dynasty, Cultivator of Stillness, Opens the Teaching:

The Primordial Heavenly Worthy, the Limitless Great Dao, responsive and numinous, sovereign of all divine spirits. Now, there are virtuous men and virtuous women who seek to receive and uphold the Eight Precepts and observe a pure fast for one day and one night, using this to govern body and mind, extinguishing the offenses and vexations of the three karmic deeds. Therefore, the Twelfth Scripture of the Cavern Spirit declares: “Fasting is urgently for harmonizing and perfecting body and mind.” When body and mind are harmonized and perfected, disorder and ruin are kept at bay. From many considerations, broadly speaking, there are eight:

One: Do not take life to sustain oneself.

Two: Do not indulge in lust for pleasure.

Three: Do not steal the possessions of others for one’s own supply.

Four: Do not speak falsehoods to boast of one’s ability.

Five: Do not become intoxicated with wine to act at will.

Six: Do not lie promiscuously on high, broad beds.

Seven: Do not commonly use fragrant oils as adornment.

Eight: Do not engage in singing and dancing as entertainment.

Today, if virtuous men and virtuous women can avoid violating these eight matters, then the eight forms of ruin have no place to arise, and the eight accomplishments will naturally establish themselves. If established long without loss, one prolongs life and preserves vitality, with spiritual powers penetrating all barriers. Therefore, fasting is to receive and uphold the Eight Precepts, to contemplate the true and practice the dao, to pass through without end, with manifest efficacy swift and as expected. Now, having completed the reception, bow once more and rise, reverently uphold the precepts and withdraw.
