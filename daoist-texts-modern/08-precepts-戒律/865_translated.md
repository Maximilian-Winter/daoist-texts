# Scripture of the One Hundred and Eighty Precepts Spoken by the Most High Lord Lao

In the final days of the Zhou dynasty, during the reign of King Nan, the dao of Great Peace and the teaching of Great Clarity first emerged. The Lord Lao descended upon Langya, imparting the dao to Lord Gan. Lord Gan received the dao and its methods, thereby attaining the dao himself, and was honored as a Perfected Person. He further transmitted the *Scripture of Great Peace* in one hundred and seventy scrolls, along with ten volumes of the *Jiazi*. Later, Lord Bo, grievously ill, received from Lord Gan the dao for protecting against sickness; his illness was cured, and he too attained the dao and was named a Perfected Person. To this day, in Langya stands a magnolia tree, marking the place where Lords Gan and Bo once cultivated.

In the time of King You, Lord Lao taught Hu Huan; when entering Hanzhong, he passed through Langya, where Lord Gan was granted a vision of Lord Lao.

Lord Lao spoke to Lord Gan, saying: “Previously, I bestowed upon you the task of aiding others to save their lives, to bear concern for the myriad people, to appoint male and female ritual ministers, to widely transform the ignorant, and to distribute disciples. Thus, the heavens above are moved with favor, and the earth below stirs with reverence, bringing joy to kings and lords. Yet, of late, from afar—countless myriad li away—I have observed that these male and female ritual ministers, while claiming my august position, are greedy for wealth and lustful, acting arbitrarily and accusing one another of right and wrong. Each claims my heart is upright and others false, seeking personal gain through offerings, desiring others to serve themselves. They hate those of the same dao, envy the virtuous and talented, are arrogant and overbearing, oppressing the people. They say: ‘In the future, we will follow me; my dao is the truest, others are false.’ None of this is proper. Hence I come to speak with you.”

Gan Ji kowtowed, prostrating himself to the ground, bowing a hundred times, and earnestly said: “Most High, from this day forth, I know not by what path to depart. The grievous sins of these male and female ritual ministers cause them to live in vain; yet, having received the dao’s protection, they may ascend as immortals, and upon death, avoid the torment of the nine subterranean prisons. Not only the ritual ministers, but also the myriad people. The people are ignorant; the law holds the ritual ministers guilty, and the fault lies with me. Truly, the blame rests upon myself. I only pray the Most High will pardon past errors and appoint me to cultivate future goodness. I, Gan Ji, bear the guilt of death, the guilt of death.”

Lord Lao said: “Calm your mind and settle your thoughts; sit. I fear the great dao is waning in the final age, and the myriad people are losing their lives. The death of one or two ritual ministers, cast into the nine abyssal depths, is not a grievous matter. What I truly lament is the suffering of the myriad people. You must listen well and record this in your heart. It shall serve as the law for future generations. Command all male and female ritual ministers to amend their past deeds and follow henceforth the path of goodness.”

Lord Lao said: “Though one may live ten thousand years, if one does not uphold precepts and discipline, what difference is there from an old tree or a rotting stone? Better to hold the precepts for a single day as a person of dao and virtue, and upon death, to shed the corpse and ascend as an immortal. The world’s dead bear heavy sins, which benefit neither soul nor spirit; the soul and spirit suffer punishment. Ritual ministers must clearly observe and practice this.”

Then he said: “All ritual ministers, listen clearly: among the myriad people under Heaven, none endure forever. Life is marked by death; all things come to rise and fall. The sun rises and sets; the moon waxes and wanes. From antiquity to now, who can last forever? Only dao and virtue endure! Now the moon is auspicious, today is auspicious, this moment is auspicious; all the worthy are auspicious, Master Jia is auspicious, disciples are auspicious, all the myriad spirits are present, officials and soldiers all assembled. Now, for the sake of the worthy, and out of concern for the lives of the myriad people, I bestow upon Lord Jia the strict prohibitions and heavy precepts, to be read thrice over.”

Lord Lao told his disciples: “In the past, all worthy immortals and sages attained the dao through the one hundred and eighty precepts. The dao itself is formless; it is through the master that one is perfected. The dao can be taught and transmitted, but the master must not be taken lightly.”  

The disciples kowtowed twice, received the charge, and withdrew.
