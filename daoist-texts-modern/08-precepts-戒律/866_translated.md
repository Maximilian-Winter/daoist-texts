From Volume Four, The Sixth Chapter on Observance of Precepts, of the *Scripture of the Origins and Retributions of the Numinous Treasure of the Supreme Cavern*

The Most Compassionate and Greatly Merciful Universal Savior, the True Man, inquired of the Most High Dao Lord concerning the origins and retributions of karma. At that time, the Dao Lord said to the Universal Savior:  
"Since the beginningless world, I have always dwelt among humans, teaching and expounding the dharma, delivering and liberating sentient beings. I cause the past and future, the Ten Directions and the Three Realms, humans and heavens, mundane and sacred, all to hear and know equally, assembling in the realm of non-action, entering the true constant dao—neither arising nor perishing, neither departing nor coming, ever abiding in serene stillness, perfectly penetrating the quiet chamber.  
Those who ascend this realm must hold precepts, beginning with the arising of the heart and culminating in the utmost fruit. Repenting and receiving precepts, reciting and observing fasts, practicing the dao with utmost sincerity, issuing great vows, praising and giving alms, nourishing all beings, rescuing and protecting all, widely building merit and virtue; thereby invoking the heavens, receiving blessings and spiritual rewards, gathering causes for transformation, confirming the true manifestations, transmitting the teachings, broadly uniting true responses—thus the dao assembly begins.  
Without ceasing in every thought, extinguishing and forgetting the heart, all must hold precepts. Those who hold precepts without violation, the heavens descend, the saints revere, demons sing praises, each according to their merit, their names listed in the Upper Palace.  
Therefore, I follow their strength to widely expound the gates of precepts, varying in number and degree, from high to low, as befits you sentient beings, accepted according to your capacities: the Three Precepts, Five Precepts, Six Precepts, Seven Precepts, Eight Precepts, Nine Precepts, Ten Precepts; the Twelve Precepts to follow, the Fourteen Precepts of body observance, the Twenty-four Precepts, Twenty-seven Precepts, Thirty-six Precepts; even to the lower grade of the Cavern Profundity with forty, the middle grade sixty, the upper grade eighty, one hundred eighty; the Three Purities with three hundred body observances, the Cavern Spirits with seven hundred twenty precepts—each with order and sequence, guiding the confused multitudes.  
Those who can receive and hold them all gain blessings and endless eradication of sin. These are scattered throughout the scriptures of the Three Caverns, long circulated. Yet sentient beings are dark and dull, unable to hear them. Now I speak only to you of the Ten Supreme Precepts, the karmic blessings for humans and heavens, the good affinities of life and death, to transmit and instruct those to come, so that all may protect and uphold them, descending blessings and dispelling calamities, inconceivable indeed."

The Dao Lord said:  
"These Ten Precepts are like the city walls and houses for sentient beings to depend upon and dwell within. Those who can uphold them are guarded by twenty-four jade youths and jade maidens, Vajra Divine Kings, generals, and mighty warriors, who stand as sentinels on left and right, dispelling calamities and delivering from disasters, protecting life and extending years. The true saints revere them, the heavens rejoice.  
Weapons of war, fire and water, tigers, wolves, insects, snakes, diseases, prisons, ghosts, thieves, evil spirits, hunger, cold, vexations, and all calamities shall never afflict their bodies. Those who seek sons receive sons; those who seek daughters receive daughters; wealth, honor, longevity, and joy—all wishes fulfilled.  
Wisdom and intelligence shine forth; their appearance is dignified and beautiful, foremost among humans, inconceivable indeed. In past lives, they were born in heavenly palaces and pure lands, in flowery terraces and jeweled halls, clothing and food effortless, beneath cloud canopies and dragon chariots, roaming freely and at ease.  
They constantly hear scriptures and dharma, serve the heavenly venerables, transmigrate with bodies, and gather in the true dao. Those who hold these precepts are like treasured swords that can sever all obstacles, like dharma boats that ferry all across, like fierce fires that burn all impurities, like pure waters that wash all stains. From the Three Purities downward to the highest saints and true immortals of the Ten Directions, none do not hold these precepts.  
Precepts are to prevent sin and stop evil, to restrain body and mind, to subdue demons and spirits, to move the numinous saints."

The Dao Lord said further:  
"Long ago, five hundred men in the Pure Harmony Kingdom, on the Bright Mountain, cultivated the dao for twenty-one years, all holding these precepts, fully awakening to non-action. I sent the True Man of Transcendent Appearance to deliver them into the Formless Heaven; now all have become Golden Radiance Immortals, further studying the Great Vehicle, gradually ascending to true rank.  
Also, in the Floating Kingdom, on the Accumulated Mountain, thirty-six thousand women united in heart to study the dao. For one hundred years, they did not hear this scripture or precepts, and were harmed by great demon spirits, all sinking into the waters of ignorance, wandering and drowning, unable to escape. I sent the Delivering True Man to rescue them, granting this scripture to gradually awaken them.  
They moved to the Contemplation Mountain, now rightly holding the Ten Precepts, having attained six million years, day and night diligent, single-minded and undivided. Spirit mushrooms and divine herbs, sweet dew and jade pools, spontaneously grow there, providing food and drink. Gradually they become enlightened, naturally arriving at the utmost truth."
