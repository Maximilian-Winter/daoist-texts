# Preface to the Record of the Most True Words of the Unperturbed and Pure Long-Life Perfected One

I have heard that the dao dwells within the realm, and what is fitting is to gently cultivate and bring it forth. The immortals dwell beyond all forms; it cannot be sought carelessly. Thus, the poet Le Tian says:  
"If one lacks the golden bones and true form, one shall not be listed among the names of the elixir terraces.  
Without planting the good roots through a hundred thousand kalpas, and receiving the qi of three, five, or one true essence,  
How could one possibly arrive at this realm?"  

Now, the Long-Life Master, Mr. Liu, composes this likeness and borrows this name. In former times, he encountered the Perfected One King of Double Yang, who aided and transformed him, delivering him from the mundane into the dao, illuminating his clear understanding and innate wisdom, thoroughly comprehending and unblocking the way.  

Just yesterday, he was summoned by imperial decree to appear. There was a poem:  
"In former years, the former emperor of Shan You issued an edict;  
Today, the holy emperor of Donglai proclaims.  
After two years, he reports his return; officials seek words, saying:  
'Drifting like clouds and water, yet returning to Donglai,  
Among the immortals of Taiwei, a star-crowned scholar.'  
Much like Chen Xiyi, who once received the favor of Song,  
And declined to return to Mount Hua.  
The edict replied:  
'In the jade hall and golden palace, I am briefly joyful to come to court;  
Beneath the mountain curtains and cloud sedan, I hasten to seek retirement.'"

Here, these two great masters, unbound and free, each excel in a bright court of beauty. Surely, they pursue the same dao, differing only in place and circumstance.  

Since the master himself returned to his homeland, residing in Taiwei, he has annotated the various scriptures, tracing the lineage of the Three Sages. With writing both expansive and unrestrained, with brush and ink he frolics and wanders, composing methods of teaching and expounding the classics. He follows the Buddha’s precepts of heavy and light, fashions the myriad wondrous gates of the Mysterious Sovereign, and embraces the Five Constants of Master Xuanfu. He manages fields and homes, gathers pears and jujubes, all with diligent care.  

All his writings compete in intricate carving and engraving for transmission, renewing the hearing and sight of the common folk, recited and chanted among the populace, nurturing the spirit of the people. Those who understand return to trust; the stubborn and ignorant are swiftly reformed.  

One day, two of the master’s disciples, Teachers Xu and Li, journeyed from afar to pay their respects. Passing the creek pavilion, entering the humble study, they rested from their weariness of staff and sandals, and offered delicacies of land and water. After a long while, they presented a volume of the master’s *Record of the Most True Words* and earnestly requested a preface. Duty would not allow refusal, so I purified my heart and read through it thoroughly.  

It awakens one to vigilance and sincerity, instantly inspiring the desire to sever worldly ties and abandon karmic obstacles and evil. From beginning to end, it lists eighty categories of questions, answering with a luminous ten thousand words. It embraces, measures, narrates, cites, and critiques, grounding the transformations of Heaven and Earth, tracing the workings of yin and yang, revealing the discourse on death and life, clarifying the retribution of fortune and misfortune, discussing the nature of true emptiness, and admonishing the desires of greed and anger.  

It goes on to explain the origins of suffering and joy, the workings of false and genuine feelings, the sources of purity and impurity, the roots of high and low states—these and many others, all exhaustively treated. All are resolved by quoting the profound mysteries of Huang-Lao; thus, all affairs under Heaven are concluded.  

This enables sentient beings to distinguish doubt and return to correctness, melting away like ice dissolving, carving open the great pond of darkness, and opening the door to numinous illumination, swiftly driving forth liberation.  

Thus, one transcends the sea of suffering, ascends the shore of awakening, removes the filth of the Three Existences and Five Turbidities, attains the cause of the samadhi of unity and emptiness, discards the defilements of the twelve categories, and receives the joy of rebirth in the Three Thousand Realms.  

Truly, this emerges from the Most True Words, enlightening and guiding transformation, a result of dharma affinity—how magnificent indeed!  

On the first day of the first month in the renxu year of Qing Taihe, Han Shiqian Yan Guang, Daoist of Xukou at Duancheng in Huoze, respectfully composed this preface.
