# Eighty Questions

### Question One: On the Method  
A visitor inquired: “What is this method?” The Child of Longevity replied: “To penetrate its dao and reach the true void—that is called the method. To understand its liberation and reach unbornness—that is called the precept. Those who teach the method cannot exhaust its myriad faults, nor comprehend its myriad principles. Those who teach the precept cannot exhaust its myriad virtues, nor fathom its myriad wisdoms. When dao and method are unified, one attains the natural clarity of uprightness and effortless action. When liberation and precept are unified, one fulfills the longevity of all beings. The scripture says: ‘The dao’s method is natural.’ The dao’s method is not emptiness, yet it is emptiness.”

### Question Two: On Emptiness  
The visitor asked again: “What is emptiness?” The answer came: “The dao abides not in emptiness. The foolish cling to stubborn emptiness; the wise abide in true emptiness. The world thinks of emptiness as mere colorlessness; the dao forgets the world’s emptiness. People love all emptiness, but those who think of sin are not empty. The enlightened see the dao’s emptiness; the adept understand their nature’s emptiness. The impure sink into emptiness at death; the pure rise into emptiness at birth. The scripture says: ‘Born and entering death, the living number thirteen, the dead number thirteen.’ To awaken to emptiness is to know.”

### Question Three: On Knowing  
Again asked: “What is knowing?” The reply: “Knowing is to see a person’s grace and favor, and the heart hopes for reward; knowing the dao of Heaven is to diminish excess and benefit the needy; knowing the dao of people is to lessen lack and serve the wealthy. Knowing those with dao is to follow Heaven; knowing those without dao is to follow people. Following Heaven is life; following people is death. Following Heaven preserves clarity and goodness; following people indulges impurity and evil. The scripture says: ‘Observe Heaven’s dao, hold to Heaven’s conduct, and all is fulfilled.’ Knowing the light of wisdom differs from common sight.”

### Question Four: On Seeing  
Asked again: “What is seeing?” The answer: “Seeing is not what the fleshly eye perceives. Seeing is to behold the void primordial, the light of wisdom, the all-encompassing form, the flickering and elusive, the precious pearl, the rosy clouds, the profound subtlety, the pure clarity, the soul’s purity, the spirit’s stillness. The scripture says: ‘The dao as a thing is only vague and dim.’ To see the form of no-thing is to respond outwardly to constant goodness.”

### Question Five: On Goodness  
Asked again: “What is goodness?” The reply: “Goodness is the square and round, the crooked and straight, responding to things and conforming to people. Not giving rise to myriad evils—that is true goodness. Not attaching to myriad things—that is pure goodness. Understanding principle without reading myriad scriptures—that is thorough goodness. Grasping the subtle without exhausting myriad transformations—that is bright goodness. Not harming myriad forms—that is compassionate goodness. Not wearying of myriad impurities—that is responsive goodness. Not opposing myriad people—that is virtuous goodness. Not seeking myriad possessions—that is dao goodness. Not stirring myriad selfishness—that is impartial goodness. Not forgetting myriad wisdoms—that is constant goodness. The scripture says: ‘Goodness, I cherish it; unkindness, I also cherish it—this is virtuous goodness. The highest goodness is not evil.’”

### Question Six: On Evil  
Asked again: “What is evil?” The answer: “Evil is the unworthy among people. When people do not follow Heaven, Heaven does not favor them. If people scatter and squander, Heaven teaches famine and scarcity. If people do not cultivate their blessings, Heaven does not teach abundance and ripeness. If hearts indulge in malice, Heaven’s will sends wind and hail. If one dies without caution against evil killing, in the next life one will surely be born among the Asuras. When people create evil, Heaven returns evil in kind. If people are unharmed by things, things are unharmed by people. The scripture says: ‘Poisonous insects do not sting, fierce beasts do not attack, hunting crows do not seize.’ If one does not hate true penetration, one will understand the wise.”

### Question Seven: On the Wise  
Asked again: “What is the wise?” The reply: “The wise are those greatly enlightened. The greatly intelligent seem as if they lack understanding. The greatly wise seem as if they lack knowledge. The greatly clever seem as if they lack clarity. The greatly eloquent seem as if they lack speech. Responding to their intelligence, they truly possess myriad penetrations. Responding to their wisdom, they truly have myriad explanations. Responding to their cleverness, they truly have myriad illuminations. Responding to their eloquence, they truly have myriad discourses. Intelligence penetrating is worldly penetration. Wisdom penetrating is dao penetration. Cleverness penetrating is principle clarity. Eloquence penetrating is speech purity. The scripture says: ‘Do not exalt the wise, so the people do not contend. The wise hidden in the world are like jade concealed in stone. The wise hidden in the dao are the true no-thing. The wise are not their own foolishness.’”

### Question Eight: On the Foolish  
Asked again: “What is the foolish?” The answer: “The foolish are the ancient adepts who keep far from the world’s illusions, appearing outwardly foolish. The Confucians like Yan Hui are pure and poor, with one basket and one gourd. The Buddhists like Shakyamuni beg for food, one meal from seven households. The Daoists are purely yang and effortless, dwelling like quails beneath the chariot wheel. Returning to simplicity, the high go below, the possessing go to nothing. The enlightened seem dark, the ancient silent seem slow of speech. The scripture says: ‘I alone seem lost, I am the heart of the foolish.’ Outwardly foolish, inwardly embracing the dao—this is true life.”

### Question Nine: On Life  
Asked again: “What is life?” The reply: “Life is to embrace the dao and be truly alive; to preserve the body is to be blessed; to nourish qi is to be spiritual; to penetrate the subtle is to be wondrous; to be free of delusion is to be wise; to respond to things is to be virtuous; to be constantly good is to save life; summer solstice is the birth of the tower; winter solstice is the birth of yang; communication is the birth of things. True life is leisure; blessed life is clarity; spiritual life is numinous; wondrous life is purity; wise life is penetration; virtuous life is evenness; saving life is compassion; yin life is ascent; yang life is descent; things’ life is completion. The scripture says: ‘The dao produces the one; the one produces two; two produce three; three produce myriad things.’ Heaven and Earth produce myriad things, harmonizing qi to create life; with metal qi to kill, that is death.”

### Question Ten: On Death  
Asked again: “What is death?” The answer: “Death is the form of things. When myriad things reach deep autumn, their forms die, but their roots do not die. When myriad forms reach a hundred years, their bodies die, but their nature does not die. Unfeeling things can deepen their roots; feeling forms can nurture their nature. If roots lack water, the shoots die. If nature lacks life, the body dies. Root is nature; nature is root. Spirit is nature; nature is spirit. When the Five Phases’ numbers are exhausted, forms decline and die. Beyond yin and yang, spirit does not die. The scripture says: ‘Deep roots and firm foundations are the way of long life and lasting vision. To die without dying is the true preciousness.’”

### Question Eleven: On Nobility  
Asked again: “What is nobility?” The reply: “Nobility is to value virtue. Heaven bestows grace without letting the lowly know—that is noble virtue. Heaven bestows grace without choosing favorites—that is noble virtue. Heaven bestows grace in creation without being master—that is noble virtue. Heaven bestows grace to aid people without expecting reward—that is noble virtue. People must align with Heaven’s will, benefiting the needy while knowing themselves. People must align with Heaven’s will, benefiting with a heart impartial as to self. People must align with Heaven’s will, giving wealth as if discarding mud. People must align with Heaven’s will, giving food without remembering from whom. The scripture says: ‘All things respect the dao and honor virtue. The virtue of the noble benefits even the lowly.’”

### Question Twelve: On Baseness  
Asked again: “What is baseness?” The answer: “Baseness is to slight the outer. Truly valuing virtue, one disdains the body’s surface. Virtue is like beautiful jade; the body is like rough stone. Virtue reaches Heaven above; the body humbles itself beneath the sea. When words are humble below, the body is placed above. To slight one’s true self inwardly is to honor falsehood outwardly. Honoring virtue is the world’s esteem; slighting the body is peaceful survival. Seeing treasure forms great vessels; simplicity disperses to reveal true shape. Penetrating Heaven reveals subtle obscurity; penetrating the sea gathers myriad goodness. Words humble below gain respect and trust; body placed above increases things and self. To slight truth scatters soul and spirit; to honor falsehood tastes its truth. The scripture says: ‘Thus nobility must have baseness as foundation; height must have low as base. Settling low, one lifts the high.’”

### Question Thirteen: On Height  
Asked again: “What is height?” The reply: “Heaven’s dao suppresses the high. Human dao lifts the high. The greatly enlightened hide their height. The glorious flaunt their height. Heaven’s dao suppresses the high to benefit the lowly. Human dao lifts the high to harm the lowly. The greatly enlightened hide their height to transform the wise. The glorious flaunt their height to confuse the foolish. The scripture says: ‘Lift the low, suppress the high. What Heaven lifts is covered by what is below.’”

### Question Fourteen: On Lowness  
Asked again: “What is lowness?” The answer: “Lowness is below the sea, clear and smooth, returning in submission; the heart low is clear goodness returning in submission. Clear submission is deep and broad; good submission is virtue wide. Like the beams and pillars resting below the roof, the rafters and purlins return to them. Like the host waiting below for guests, the outer guests return to him. Rafters and purlins returning bring success; outer guests returning bring virtue. The scripture says: ‘The rivers and seas can be kings of a hundred valleys because they are good at being low.’ To dwell low and clear is supreme joy.”

### Question Fifteen: On Joy  
Asked again: “What is joy?” The reply: “Joy is to delight in the dao, thus dwelling clear and low is joy; joy in the mundane is to cling to song and wine as joy. Joy in clear lowness arises from no joy and no sorrow. Joy in song and wine has both delight and grief. Joy in the way of non-action has no cultivation, no attainment. Joy in the way of action has cultivation and falling. Joy in true nature is formless and endless. Joy in false body has birth and death. The scripture says: ‘Therefore the world delights in pushing and never tires. Joy in the dao has no contention. Losing joy in the dao brings sorrow born of suffering.’”

### Question Sixteen: On Suffering  
Asked again: “What is suffering?” The answer: “Suffering is pain in body and mind. The lost in the world suffer from greed for life and enter the path of death; suffer in mind with schemes, and nature sinks into the land of sin. The awakened of the dao suffer to refine the body, like breaking stones to get jade; suffer in will to forget schemes, and nature rises to the Nine Heavens. The wise find joy in suffering; the foolish find suffering in joy. The wise suffer through and sweetness comes; the foolish reach joy’s peak and then sorrow. The scripture says: ‘Grace arises from harm; harm arises from grace.’ Joy in the dao and suffering ends, thus penetrating clarity.”

### Question Seventeen: On Clarity  
Asked again: “What is clarity?” The reply: “Clarity is when Heaven is clear, revealing myriad forms. When the heart is clear, it reveals the all-encompassing spirit. When the abyss is clear, it illuminates the twenty-eight. Penetrating the heavenly forms, qi descends harmoniously. Penetrating the all-encompassing spirit, one shares the same body as the dao. Penetrating the clear abyss, the spiritual spring leaks not. Obtaining harmony, qi and spirit unite. Obtaining the same body, true form is immortal. Obtaining no leak, the bright moon’s light is full. The scripture says: ‘The abyss seems the ancestor of myriad things.’ To probe and penetrate clarity is to be free from impurity.”

### Question Eighteen: On Impurity  
Asked again: “What is impurity?” The answer: “Impurity is for the lost in the world who indulge in desire and become evil and impure; indulge in the body and become lustful and impure; indulge in evil and cloud their nature; indulge in lust and lose their life. The awakened of the dao are Heaven-clear yet mixed with Earth-impure; body clear yet mixed with world-impure. Clear mixed with impurity is yin turning to yang; clear mixed with the world is outwardly like a fool. The scripture says: ‘Who can muddle and yet clarify? Cleanse it slowly.’ When impurity ends, light shines forth.”

### Question Nineteen: On Manifestation  
Asked again: “What is manifestation?” The reply: “Manifestation is Heaven’s image not seeing its own brightness, but the myriad eyes of the world see its brightness. The dao’s principle is not self-evident, but the myriad good know its reach. The myriad eyes see brightness, thus reverence arises. The myriad good know its reach, thus faith arises. The world reveres Heaven and Earth, thus blessings arise. The dao is trusted in non-action, thus true life arises. The scripture says: ‘Not seeing itself, thus bright; not claiming itself, thus manifest.’ Inner light manifests, thus the outer body hides.”

### Question Twenty: On Concealment  
Asked again: “What is concealment?” The answer: “Concealment is inner compassion saving life, outwardly fearing people’s knowledge; inner true clarity, outwardly like a foolish man; inner no hindrance, outwardly like dust mixed; inner light responding to things, outwardly without action; inner nature unfolding virtue, outwardly distant from human respect; inner spirit embracing dao, outwardly without attachment or confusion. Utmost clarity erases thought, body dwells in the dusty world. The scripture says: ‘The dao conceals without name, naming its greatness.’”

### Question Twenty-One: On Greatness  
Asked again: “What is greatness?” The reply: “Greatness is the dao. Yin and yang cannot contain it—that is the dao’s greatness. Greatness is nature. Ten thousand evils yet the right can contain—that is nature’s greatness. The dao’s greatness is the mother of myriad things. Nature’s greatness is the teacher of myriad evils. Penetrate the mother, and myriad things receive creation. Penetrate the teacher, and myriad evils return to right penetration. Creation is each forming its shape. Right penetration is each communicating its dao. The scripture says: ‘The dao that can be spoken is not the eternal dao. Greatness contains the small.’”

### Question Twenty-Two: On Smallness  
Asked again: “What is smallness?” The answer: “Smallness is penetrating the subtle. When the dao penetrates the small, it does not choose favorites or grace. When nature penetrates the small, it does not choose favorites or teaching. Not choosing favorites or grace means small things all receive the dao’s qi. Not choosing favorites or teaching means small things all receive Heaven’s light. Unfeeling small things, receiving the dao’s qi, form shape. Feeling small things, receiving Heaven’s light, form nature. The scripture says: ‘Governing a great state is like cooking a small fish.’ Not picking favorites is essential; not discarding the weak is essential. The subtlety of smallness is not empty.”

### Question Twenty-Three: On Emptiness  
Asked again: “What is emptiness?” The reply: “Emptiness is the dao’s body. Yin and yang illuminate emptiness, thus myriad things arise. Ultimate nature illuminates emptiness, thus flickering arises. Myriad things generate, thus aiding the world. Flickering generates, thus departing the world. Things aiding people is the world’s joy. Dao penetrating its truth is nature’s joy. Worldly joy is yin and yang having their number. Nature’s joy is emptiness reaching its boundlessness. The scripture says: ‘Reach utmost emptiness, guard stillness firmly, myriad things arise together.’ Emptiness is the dao’s reality.”

### Question Twenty-Four: On Solidity  
Asked again: “What is solidity?” The answer: “Solidity is the dao. The dao was born before Heaven and Earth, ever present and immortal—that is solidity. Solidity is nature. Nature was born beyond myriad things, ever present and immortal—that is solidity. When the dao’s solidity is clear, it grasps yin and yang, giving birth to myriad things. When nature’s solidity is clear, it is the great pivot, penetrating myriad transformations. Myriad things born reveal the dao’s solidity. Myriad transformations born reveal nature’s solidity. The dao is empty but qi is solid; nature is empty but life is solid. The scripture says: ‘Empty the heart, fill the return.’ Knowing solidity is to have true leisure of dao and nature.”

### Question Twenty-Five: On Leisure  
Asked again: “What is leisure?” The reply: “Leisure is the dao. When the supreme dao is leisure, it leisurely moves yin and yang, giving birth to things. When ultimate nature is leisure, it leisurely cooks lead and mercury, refining form. Yin and yang transform, thus completing things. Lead and mercury form, thus completing nature. Completing things is human wealth. Completing nature is spirit’s numinosity. Humans wealthy desire splendor. Spirits numinous embrace the dao. Desire for splendor brings rise and fall. Embracing the dao is formless and endless. The scripture says: ‘Seen but not seen, heard but not heard.’ Nature delights in true leisure, thus responding to busyness.”

### Question Twenty-Six: On Busyness  
Asked again: “What is busyness?” The answer: “Busyness is the dao’s leisure, the two qi always busy; nature’s leisure, the four conditions always busy. Two qi busy means the four seasons divide into upper and lower. Four conditions busy means day and night greedily competing and moving. Two qi busy means spring turns warm, summer turns hot, autumn turns cool, winter turns cold. Four conditions busy means greed for wealth, attachment to beauty, intoxication with wine, competition for qi. Two qi busy creates myriad things, yin and yang following Heaven and Earth’s virtue. Four conditions busy creates myriad affairs, beings violating Heaven and Earth’s virtue. The scripture says: ‘Sound and voice harmonize, front and back follow.’ The busy form awakens one truly without leaving.”

### Question Twenty-Seven: On Departure  
Asked again: “What is departure?” The reply: “Departure is the dao’s eternal presence without end. The dao’s image has nowhere to depart. Departure is things forming shape and having an end; qi departs. The dao penetrates yin and yang. Qi penetrates myriad things. When numbers exhaust, yin and yang scatter and depart. When forms end, myriad things decay and depart. Yin and yang scatter but dao remains. Myriad things decay but nature remains. The scripture says: ‘From ancient to now, its name does not depart. Things exhaust and qi departs. Yang harmonizes and qi comes.’”

### Question Twenty-Eight: On Arrival  
Asked again: “What is arrival?” The answer: “Arrival is not the movement of form. Heaven and Earth wait their time and communicate, thus the two qi arrive. Myriad forms wait their time and receive qi, thus yin and yang arrive. The dao is Heaven and Earth’s position; form is yin and yang’s position. Heaven and Earth abide in their dao, a long-standing position. Yin and yang abide in their things, a temporary position. Long-standing position enables the four seasons’ transformation. Temporary position enables the Three Powers’ gathering. Transformation is creation. Gathering is true form. Withering means things die; softness means forms live. The scripture says: ‘Man’s birth is soft and weak; his death is hard and strong.’ Soft arrival penetrates Heaven’s clear peace.”

### Question Twenty-Nine: On Balance  
Asked again: “What is balance?” The reply: “Balance is the dao. The dao nourishes myriad things without choosing favorites or grace, spreading qi evenly. Balance is truth. Truth penetrates myriad transformations, wealth does not choose favorites or subtlety, spreading virtue evenly. Qi balanced means things arise equally. Virtue balanced means people are equally good. Things arising equally means all complete their creation. People equally good means all complete their dao and virtue. The scripture says: ‘Heaven and Earth unite to send sweet dew; no one commands yet all is harmoniously subtle.’ Knowing its constancy.”

### Question Thirty: On Constancy  
Asked again: “What is constancy?” The answer: “Constancy is the dao. Constantly following its dao saves human spirit. Constantly following its qi saves thing’s form. People constantly following dao are like fish in water. Things constantly following qi are like lamps with oil added. Fish leaving water die. Lamps running out of oil go out. Constantly following dao is human life. Constantly following qi is thing’s life. Humans are spirit. Things are form. Form and spirit both wondrous, thus harmonizing with dao’s truth. The scripture says: ‘Constant goodness saves people, thus no one is abandoned.’ Joy in the dao’s constancy is true joy.”

### Question Thirty-One: On Joy  
Asked again: “What is joy?” The reply: “Joy is dao’s delight. Clear and without impurity, that is dao’s joy. Joyful and without worry, that is dao’s joy. Joy is virtue’s delight. Urging evil to follow goodness, that is virtue’s delight. Seeing order and repaying grace, that is virtue’s delight. Joy is lost delight. Turning away from goodness and delighting in evil, that is lost delight. Forgetting grace and repaying with harm, that is lost delight. Joy in dao completes merit. Joy in virtue completes conduct. Joy in loss leads to regression and fall. The scripture says: ‘Dao is like dao, virtue is like virtue, loss is like loss. Joy and delight forget worry.’”

### Question Thirty-Two: On Worry  
Asked again: “What is worry?” The answer: “Those who worry do not reach the dao’s true principle. Many affairs bring much worry. No worry means true penetration of dao’s wisdom. No affairs mean no worry. Many affairs bring worry, spirit is confused and qi is turbid. No affairs mean no worry, spirit is clear and qi is fresh. Turbid qi brings lust and evil thoughts, losing soul and spirit. Clear qi brings no worry or evil, gathering lead and mercury. Soul and spirit scatter and nature sinks; lead and mercury form and nature rises. The scripture says: ‘Knowing not knowing is best; not knowing is illness. Cutting off worry and completing things is the highest dao’s intimacy.’”

### Question Thirty-Three: On Attainment  
Asked again: “What is attainment?” The reply: “Attainment, true attainment is to gain nameless clear favor; false attainment is to gain named turbid disgrace. Those who gain clear favor have no greed or contention. Those who gain turbid disgrace have greed and contention. No greed or contention means true penetration of the good dao. Greed and contention means false confusion in evil customs. Truly completing myriad deeds is highest favor. Falsely creating myriad affairs is lowest disgrace. Awakening is no birth; confusion is falling. The scripture says: ‘Favor and disgrace are like shocks. Gaining false names loses the true dao.’”

### Question Thirty-Four: On Loss  
Asked again: “What is loss?” The answer: “Loss is losing the way of non-action. Loss is attaching to the way of action. Loss is losing the virtue of non-action. Loss is attaching to the virtue of action. Penetrating the way of non-action is truly endless. Attaching to the way of action is falsely finite. Penetrating the virtue of non-action is nature’s constant evenness. Attaching to the virtue of action is heart’s hatred. Non-action’s way is endless, thus truly unspoiled. Action’s way is finite, thus falsely corrupt. Non-action’s virtue is truly even, thus penetrating Heaven. Action’s virtue is falsely hateful, thus wealth falls. The scripture says: ‘Losing dao then virtue; losing virtue then benevolence. Penetrating non-action means no loss, penetrating clear blessing.’”

### Question Thirty-Five: On Blessing  
Asked again: “What is blessing?” The reply: “Blessing, true blessing is the dao, human fate; worldly blessing is dust, thing’s treasure. The blessing of non-action’s dao is like the bright moon always full. The blessing of worldly action is like the waning moon gradually shrinking. The bright moon full is human fate. The waning moon shrinking is worldly treasure. Fate is endless dao’s blessing. Treasure is finite worldly emptiness. Awakening to its dao, blessing arises. Lost in the world, karma sinks. The scripture says: ‘Blessing hides calamity; who knows its limit?’ Penetrating dao’s blessing means no calamity.”

### Question Thirty-Six: On Calamity  
Asked again: “What is calamity?” The answer: “Calamity is human desire, pre-made by faults. If a person’s karma has one part, Heaven sends ten parts of calamity. If a person’s goodness has one part, Heaven grants ten parts of blessing. The scripture says: ‘Cut off profit at its root, use tenfold effort.’ If a person does not arise from myriad evils, they surpass cultivation of myriad goodness. If a person does not attach to myriad things, they surpass bestowing myriad favors. The scripture says: ‘Three returns day and night, use ten thousandfold effort.’ Penetrating non-action, clear blessing is ten thousandfold. Lost in action, false blessing hides calamity. The scripture says: ‘Calamity is where blessing leans. The true is not outside abandonment.’”

### Question Thirty-Seven: On Abandonment  
Asked again: “What is abandonment?” The reply: “Abandonment is the world abandoning wealth, hoping for blessing. Abandonment is the dao not abandoning having, but taking its no-thing. Abandoning wealth to take blessing does not penetrate true blessing. Abandoning having to cling to no-thing does not penetrate true no-thing. True blessing is myriad compassion. True no-thing is myriad penetration. Compassion saves things. Penetration reveals principle. Broad compassion is virtue’s narrowness. Principle unfolding is dao’s clarity. The scripture says: ‘Now abandoning compassion and courage, abandoning frugality and breadth, advancing dao is not taking.’”

### Question Thirty-Eight: On Taking  
Asked again: “What is taking?” The answer: “Taking is delusion and not right. Ultimate truth is dao. Penetrating clarity is virtue. Fully reaching things and penetrating, dao returns to them. Dwelling low and deep, virtue returns to them. Truth not attaching to having, things return to it. The sea not dwelling on high, clarity returns to it. Things return, completing creation. Clarity returns, completing utmost virtue. If a person awakens to worldly falsehood, they penetrate emptiness and have merit. If a person awakens to exhausting self, they penetrate humility and have conduct. The scripture says: ‘Dwelling in reality, not in splendor, thus abandoning that and taking this. True no-thing takes nothing, thus illuminating within.’”

### Question Thirty-Nine: On the Middle  
Asked again: “What is the middle?” The reply: “The middle is Heaven’s balance. Heaven bestows grace and births myriad things without choosing favorites—that is clarity in the middle. Human balance is truly spreading virtue and penetrating myriad transformations, neither hating nor loving—that is clarity in the middle. Heaven balanced and myriad things born means Heaven has its merit. Humans balanced and myriad transformations truly penetrating means humans have their conduct. If Heaven loves favorites and grace, there is no great merit. If humans love favorites and give favors, there is no great conduct. The scripture says: ‘The even dao is like similarity.’ Knowing the even dao, clear blessing is boundless.”

### Question Forty: On Extremes  
Asked again: “What are extremes?” The answer: “Extremes are not penetrating principle. Seeing having but not penetrating no-thing; seeing no-thing but not penetrating having—that is extreme view. Not attaching to extreme view is penetrating principle. Seeing having and penetrating no-thing; seeing no-thing and penetrating having. Penetrating having is embracing dao and hiding in grotto heavens. Penetrating no-thing is embracing dao and hiding its capital splendor. The scripture says: ‘Act without acting, do without doing.’ Not standing on two extremes is true non-attachment.”

### Question Forty-One: On Attachment  
Asked again: “What is attachment?” The reply: “Attachment and non-attachment are alike dust, body mingled with myriad things’ having. Truly non-attached to myriad things’ heart is called great penetration. Non-attachment and attachment is to go beyond dust, body far from myriad things’ having. Truly attached to myriad things’ thought is called not yet penetrating. Attachment and non-attachment, body is like lotus root. Non-attachment and attachment, body is like lotus flower. Body in dust, nature not in dust, thus true completion. Body far from dust, heart in dust, thus incomplete. The scripture says: ‘Broken then new.’ Truly complete, body responds to things, neither attached nor separated.”

### Question Forty-Two: On Separation  
Asked again: “What is separation?” The answer: “Separation is body apart from desire, heart forgetting dust, thus quietly guarding will. Separation is body hidden in famous mountains, truly responding to qin and books, quietly delighting in communication of will. Guarding will is simplicity. Delighting in communication of will is splendor and reach. Body simple and heart splendid is called false form and spirit both wondrous. Form simple and dispersed and true splendid is called true form and spirit both wondrous. The scripture says: ‘Not seeing what can be desired, making heart untroubled.’ Clear detachment from thing’s shell is penetrating humanity.”

### Question Forty-Three: On People  
Asked again: “What are people?” The reply: “People who live indulging in evil die sinking in evil paths of transmigration—that is Heaven’s governance of people. People who do not cultivate blessing die sinking in poverty and lowliness transmigration—that is Heaven’s governance of people. People who have goodness are born in China, cultivating their dao. People who have great joy are born in China, accumulating virtue. People with evil receive Heaven’s evil retribution. People with goodness receive Heaven’s good retribution. The scripture says: ‘Governing people is Heaven’s matter; none surpass frugality.’ People not penetrating Heaven’s will are attached to self.”

### Question Forty-Four: On Self  
Asked again: “What is self?” The answer: “Self, true self, is human nature. My dao is the formless dao. My goodness is the effortless goodness. People all call this unworthy. False self is human evil. False dao is the way of nurturing the body. False goodness is the way of action. People all call this worthy. True self is formless dao and thus true. Effortless goodness is constant. False self is nurturing the body and thus false. Action goodness is hateful. The scripture says: ‘The world all calls my dao great yet unworthy, as if worthy for long. Knowing true self does not argue.’”

### Question Forty-Five: On Argument  
Asked again: “What is argument?” The reply: “Argument is worldly argument, full of myriad evils. Heaven’s silence contains myriad goodness. Worldly argument has right and wrong. Dao’s argument has clear goodness. Worldly mouths argue but hearts do not penetrate. Dao’s mouth says nothing but truly penetrates. Without penetration, broad but not knowing subtlety. With penetration, cutting off learning but knowing subtlety. These two are called confusion and awakening. The scripture says: ‘Good do not argue; arguers not good.’ Penetrating Heaven’s will, outwardly seeming slow of speech.”

### Question Forty-Six: On Slowness  
Asked again: “What is slowness?” The answer: “Slowness seems like slowness, seeming unable to speak. Penetrating dao and dispersing simplicity, slowness is like argument. Embracing dao and returning to simplicity, argument is like slowness. Dispersing simplicity harms qi and body is constrained. Returning to simplicity cherishes qi and body is unconstrained. Seeing the foolish, argument is like slowness. Seeing the wise, slowness is like argument. The scripture says: ‘Great skill seems clumsy, great eloquence seems slow. Enhancing truth is to diminish outwardly.’”

### Question Forty-Seven: On Loss  
Asked again: “What is loss?” The reply: “Loss is when the person with dao acts, they lose themselves but not others. If placing self before others, they have virtue. Without dao, acting loses others but not self. If placing others before self, they lack virtue. Those with virtue are non-action. Those without virtue are action. Non-action losing things means having dao. Action harming things means no dao. The scripture says: ‘To follow dao daily is loss. Outward loss exhausted on things is dao’s gain.’”

### Question Forty-Eight: On Gain  
Asked again: “What is gain?” The answer: “Gain is benefiting truth, the dao’s principle. Awakening to dao, learning proper teaching, the adept benefits truth. Lost in the world, learning evil methods, the unawakened benefits the body. Benefiting truth means illuminating dao. Benefiting body means harming things. Illuminating dao means clear goodness. Harming things means greed and contention. Clear goodness accumulates virtue. Greed and contention accumulate karma. Having myriad deeds means true ascent. Having myriad affairs means body falls. The scripture says: ‘To study is daily gain. Learning benefits dao’s truth, thus long-lasting.’”

### Question Forty-Nine: On Longevity  
Asked again: “What is longevity?” The reply: “Longevity is human length, thus following dao is true length. Forgetting emotion is life’s length. Good clarity and subtlety is Heaven’s length. Penetrating wisdom is principle’s length. True length is penetrating emptiness and no-thing’s body. Life length is treasure’s bright fullness. Heaven’s length is auspicious smoke curling. Principle’s length is natural penetration. Knowing emptiness and no-thing, dao is complete. Knowing bright fullness, life is complete. Knowing auspicious smoke, spirit is complete. Knowing naturalness, virtue is complete. The scripture says: ‘Heaven is long, Earth is enduring.’ Following Heaven’s length, there is no shortness.”

### Question Fifty: On Shortness  
Asked again: “What is shortness?” The answer: “Shortness is guarding dao without end, thus will is short. Seeing goodness without compassion, thus conduct is short. Two honors not respected, thus filial piety is short. Short will means no merit. No compassion means no conduct. No filial piety means forgetting grace. Having will completes dao. Having compassion completes virtue. Repaying grace completes filial piety. No dao, no virtue, no filial piety means shortness. Having dao, virtue, filial piety means no shortness. The scripture says: ‘This is not good. Short wisdom is born of false cleverness.’”

### Question Fifty-One: On Cleverness  
Asked again: “What is cleverness?” The reply: “Cleverness is harming myriad clever actions, knowing myriad profits and many benefits, thus harming the body. Cutting off myriad clever non-actions, knowing myriad clarity and much clarity, thus completing the body. Worldly profits many, thus born of calamity. Dao’s clarity many, thus born of blessing. False cleverness is born of calamity. True clarity is born of blessing. Lost in having is falsehood. Awakening to no-thing is truth. False having is harm’s domain. True no-thing is goodness’s realm. The scripture says: ‘Cut off cleverness and abandon profit, thieves and robbers vanish.’ The wise forget false cleverness and guard true clumsiness.”

### Question Fifty-Two: On Clumsiness  
Asked again: “What is clumsiness?” The answer: “Clumsiness is ultimate nature penetrating the wise, outwardly seeming foolish and clumsy—this is called returning to simplicity. True wisdom penetrating culture, false form seeming dull and clumsy—this is called hiding and concealing. Facing false confusion and hiding, clumsiness is clarity. Facing true awakening and revealing, clumsiness is penetration. Penetrating the world means things reach. Penetrating the dao means true reach. Seeing commoners responds to all having, with natural change and penetration. Seeing kindred spirits responds to all no-thing, with natural change and penetration. Outward clumsy but truly not foolish. The scripture says: ‘Nature has cleverness and clumsiness, which can be hidden. Ultimate cleverness seeming clumsy, the wise praise.’”

### Question Fifty-Three: On Praise  
Asked again: “What is praise?” The reply: “Praise among gentlemen is to exalt others’ beauty and conceal others’ ugliness. Among petty people, it is to conceal others’ beauty and exalt others’ ugliness. Concealing others’ ugliness and evil, exalting others’ beauty and goodness, that is virtue. Exalting others’ ugliness and evil, concealing others’ beauty and goodness, that is fault. Having virtue again makes one noble; having fault again makes one base. The world esteems noble people; the next world people esteem less. The world scorns base people; the next world people scorn less. Virtue completes dao and ascends. Fault confuses the world and falls. The scripture says: ‘The wise do not speak; those who speak are not wise. Good praise has no evil harm.’”

### Question Fifty-Four: On Defamation  
Asked again: “What is defamation?” The answer: “Defamation is among the foolish who do not know the wise; the wise do not defame, knowing the foolish. The foolish raise evil and suppress goodness; the wise encourage evil and return to goodness. The foolish generate faults and show their forms, seeking blessing. The wise erase faults and forget forms, guarding dao. The confused have evil and goodness; the awakened have neither evil nor goodness. Having goodness means no constancy; having no evil means constancy. Constancy is called dao. The scripture says: ‘Fools see Heaven and Earth’s patterns as sacred; I see time and things’ patterns as wise.’ Without defamation, turbid thoughts vanish.”

### Question Fifty-Five: On Forgetting  
Asked again: “What is forgetting?” The reply: “Forgetting is when thinking of dao, forgetting the world; thinking of right, forgetting the wrong—that is confusion and awakening. Thinking of dao is cultivating truth. Thinking of world is nurturing the body. Thinking of right penetrates ultimate principle. Thinking of wrong cultivates the colored body. Thinking truth has merit and no fault. Nurturing body has no merit and fault. Thinking right has conduct and no attachment. Thinking wrong has attachment and no conduct. The scripture says: ‘The heart arises from things, dies from things. Penetrating principle and understanding pivot is true forgetting thought, outwardly no greed.’”

### Question Fifty-Six: On Greed  
Asked again: “What is greed?” The answer: “Greed is desiring and losing life; greed for wealth and losing body. The confused first sweet then bitter. Erasing desire completes life. Cutting off wealth completes body. The awakened first bitter then sweet. Losing life and body is foolishness. Completing life and body is wisdom. The impure are greedy in the world, violating dao. The clear forget the world, reaching dao. The scripture says: ‘No sin greater than desire; no calamity greater than not knowing enough. Not greedy for worldly falsehood is truly embracing dao.’”

### Question Fifty-Seven: On Dao  
Asked again: “What is dao?” The reply: “Dao is penetrating things without things—that is dao. Knowing emptiness but not empty—that is constancy, called constant dao. Constant dao penetrating is non-action penetration. Non-being reveals flickering subtlety. Being reveals transformation principle. Non-being is beyond yin and yang. Being is clarity of myriad transformations. Penetrating non-being and knowing its having; penetrating being and knowing its non-being. Not clinging to having forms. The scripture says: ‘Dao is constant non-action, yet nothing is not done. Dao’s doing is not small goodness transforming the world.’”

### Question Fifty-Eight: On the World  
Asked again: “What is the world?” The answer: “The world is people’s worldly body. The true is ultimate spirit, called having thing. Outside is dao, prior to Heaven and Earth. Thing’s surface is nature beyond yin and yang. Having and clear is like jade seen in stone. Thing and clear is like pearl seen in shell. Having is human form. Thing is true nature. Form ends, nature remains. Things exhaust, qi remains. Lost in having things, soul and spirit scatter. Awakening to dao nature, creation completes. The scripture says: ‘Having things mixed and formed, born before Heaven and Earth. Outwardly responding to the world without error.’”

### Question Fifty-Nine: On Non-Being  
Asked again: “What is non-being?” The reply: “Non-being is the superior person, secretly practicing myriad clarity and goodness, greatly penetrating. The inferior person openly indulges in myriad impurity and evil, laughing loudly. Clarity is following dao and surviving. Impurity is opposing dao and perishing. The wise are not outwardly wise. The foolish are not outwardly foolish. Clarity, impurity, wise, foolish, long known by the world. The sun and moon’s brightness is not self-seen, but myriad eyes see their brightness. The scripture says: ‘Inferior hear dao and laugh loudly. Not its truth.’”

### Question Sixty: On Truth  
Asked again: “What is truth?” The answer: “Truth is following its dao, thus truly truth. Falsehood is following things, thus falsely false. Knowing truth does not cling to false. Knowing truth does not speak of false. Knowing truth is subtle penetration of dao. Knowing truth is subtle penetration of Heaven. Knowing dao has merit. Knowing Heaven has conduct. Merit is yang dao. Conduct is yin virtue. If privately saving myriad forms, called yang merit. If secretly saving myriad sufferings, called yin virtue. The scripture says: ‘Self-seeing is not bright; self-truth is not manifest. Self-truth thinks dao and responds to things, thus having thought.’”

### Question Sixty-One: On Thought  
Asked again: “What is thought?” The reply: “Awakened thought knows myriad clarity and acts, thus has myriad goodness. Knows myriad love and acts, thus has myriad evil. Having myriad clarity and goodness is true ascent. Having myriad love and evil is false fall. Birth without fault, death without suffering. Birth with fault, death with suffering. The scripture says: ‘My words are very easy to know, very easy to act, yet the world cannot know nor act. Think and know principle’s subtlety, forget the world.’”

### Question Sixty-Two: On the World  
Asked again: “What is the world?” The answer: “The world is penetrating the world with knowledge of people, thus forgetting the world and turning to dao. Lost in the world without knowledge of people, thus clinging to the world and turning away from dao. Truly penetrating myriad things, thus departing myriad things’ shell. False lost in myriad things, thus in myriad things’ shell. Truly departing things’ shell is dao. False in things’ shell is dust. True in its dao has no birth or death. False in dust has birth and death. Awakening is wisdom penetration; lost is not clear. The scripture says: ‘Knowing people is wisdom. Things exhaust and world outside, thus knowing its mystery.’”

### Question Sixty-Three: On Subtlety  
Asked again: “What is subtlety?” The reply: “Subtlety is truly without desire, thus nature is like bright full moon, observing its subtlety. False having desire, thus delusion is like firefly’s flickering light, seen in dimness. Bright moon is ten directions’ light. Firefly’s flicker is one point of light. Ten directions’ light penetrates myriad transformations. One point of light clings to one law. Penetrating transformation embraces evil. Clinging to law slanders the right. Without high or low penetration is right. Having hatred and love attachment is evil. The scripture says: ‘Always without desire to observe subtlety, always with desire to observe thoroughness.’ Penetrating subtlety reveals its depth.”

### Question Sixty-Four: On Depth  
Asked again: “What is depth?” The answer: “Depth is seeing the deep subtle and knowing dao. Knowing deep thought and penetrating the world. Penetrating dao is prior penetrating world. Penetrating world is not penetrating dao. Knowing dao is raising up. Penetrating world is penetrating world forgetting world, thus reverence. Penetrating dao is penetrating dao and walking dao, thus penetration. Penetrating world and forgetting world is wisdom. The penetrated transforms world’s wise. The wise transform world’s foolish. The foolish knowing is wise. The wise knowing is penetrated. The scripture says: ‘Subtle and mysterious, profound and unknowable. Awakening to the hidden subtle reveals boundlessness.’”

### Question Sixty-Five: On Direction  
Asked again: “What is direction?” The reply: “Direction is Heaven and Earth’s square and round, born in myriad things, not loving favorites or hating to destroy. The Most High spreads virtue, saving myriad spirits, not loving the noble or cutting off the lowly. Heaven and Earth born in myriad things, spreading qi evenly. The Most High saves myriad spirits, spreading virtue evenly. Myriad things’ qi penetrating is Heaven and Earth’s great grace and merit. Myriad spirits’ virtue penetrating is the Most High’s great grace and conduct. Called Heaven and Earth’s sage and man, as if private utmost merit and conduct. The scripture says: ‘Thus the sage is square yet does not cut. Truly knowing its square inch, life is bright and full.’”

### Question Sixty-Six: On Roundness  
Asked again: “What is roundness?” The answer: “Roundness is Heaven’s round light. Looking at the sun, the moon is round. On the dark day, light is gone. Human life’s light, on the fifteenth day, receives conception; on the sixteenth year, life is round; on the eighty-eighth, the hexagram ends. Light gone means Heaven has no brightness. Hexagram ended means person has no life. Less desire means life extended. More desire means life shortened. Called Heaven’s and human’s waxing and waning. Without feeling means life stays. Without thing means nature penetrates. Life penetrating nature is like water meeting earth. Nature penetrating life is like earth meeting water. Constant goodness penetrating means true fire descends. Nine turns complete means form is immortal. The scripture says: ‘See the small sun’s brightness.’ Round light manifest is response.”

### Question Sixty-Seven: On Response  
Asked again: “What is response?” The reply: “Formless dao does not respond to formed body. Formless nature does not respond to emotional rites. Valuing solidity is the immortal dao; thus dao responds to nature. Valuing splendor is the human dao; thus form responds to rites. Responding to nature is true. Responding to rites is false. Heaven’s dao suppresses the high and lifts the low. Human dao harms the poor and serves the rich. Following Heaven’s dao opposes human dao. Following human dao opposes Heaven’s dao. The scripture says: ‘Highest rites act, yet none respond. Dao responds to its non-action, thus truly transforming.’”

### Question Sixty-Eight: On Transformation  
Asked again: “What is transformation?” The answer: “Transformation is non-action true transformation, like the moon’s reflection in water. Action false transformation, like viewing form in a mirror. Knowing non-action transformation is true nature’s penetration. Seeing action transformation is false form’s power. Penetrating is true unfeeling. Forgetting feeling is false. Power is feeling’s false. Ignorant of unfeeling is true. True transformation is nature penetrating dao. False transformation is body greedy for profit. Dao penetrating completes nature. Greedy profit harms body. The scripture says: ‘Act without acting, thus nothing is not governed.’ Responding to true transformation, dao is unfeeling.”

### Question Sixty-Nine: On Emotion  
Asked again: “What is emotion?” The reply: “Emotion is when crooked, dao nature is unfeeling, yet body seems to have emotion. When clinging, dao nature has emotion, yet body seems without emotion. Crooked nature without emotion means no leak. Clinging nature with emotion means leak. Crooked means wise. Clinging means foolish. No leak and wise means having dao and virtue. Leak and no wise means no dao and no virtue. Dao’s truth means soul and spirit complete. Virtue’s clarity means myriad transformations penetrate. The scripture says: ‘I have no desire and people are naturally simple. I have no emotion and people are naturally clear. Dao without emotion is true, not attached to worldly things.’”

### Question Seventy: On Things  
Asked again: “What are things?” The answer: “Things are when people are in things’ shell, like fish in a net. People out of things’ shell are like the true in dao. Fish in net, leaving water dies. True in dao, leaving things lives. Fish not greedy for bait, fish always in water. People not greedy for things, people always in dao. Fish in water is alive. People in dao is life. Fish getting pearl light transforms. People getting qi’s rush penetrates. These two, lost means death; awakened means life. The scripture says: ‘Heaven’s net is vast and wide, loose but not missing. Outside things means forgetting mechanism.’”

### Question Seventy-One: On Mechanism  
Asked again: “What is mechanism?” The reply: “Mechanism is wisdom. People without dao use wisdom and wealth to harm others and secure themselves—that is called thief. People with dao use wisdom to harm themselves and secure others—that is called blessing. Small wisdom is foolish evil. Great wisdom is wise goodness. Foolish opposes Heaven. Wise follows Heaven. Opposing Heaven means body falls. Following Heaven means true ascent. Falling is yin dao impurity. Rising is yang dao clarity. The scripture says: ‘People are hard to govern because of their many wits. Natural wisdom illuminating dao means no worry.’”

### Question Seventy-Two: On Worry  
Asked again: “What is worry?” The answer: “Lost in the world means having heart. Awakening to dao means no worry. Greedy contention moves myriad worries. Clear goodness cuts off myriad worries. Darkness means boundless sin. Brightness means boundless blessing. No goodness means constant evil. No evil means constant goodness. Constant evil accumulates faults. Constant goodness accumulates virtue. Having faults means yin suffering. Having virtue means yang joy. The world knows profit but not harm. Dao knows blessing but not greed. The scripture says: ‘Knowing not knowing is best. Not knowing knowing is illness. Cutting off worry and completing things is highest dao’s closeness.’”

### Question Seventy-Three: On Closeness  
Asked again: “What is closeness?” The reply: “Closeness is when people ask what is close, it is fame and profit closeness, false treasure closeness. Outside things’ closeness is dao and virtue closeness, true treasure closeness. False closeness has fame and profit, wealth has favor and disgrace. False treasure has evil people obstructing. True closeness has dao and virtue, thus clear and peaceful. True treasure has good people invading. False benefits body, thus harms truth. True benefits body, thus harms false. The scripture says: ‘Fame and body which is closer? Body and goods which is more? Dao close means things distant.’”

### Question Seventy-Four: On Distance  
Asked again: “What is distance?” The answer: “Distance is world-weariness, thus dao has no distance. Weary of profit, body has no harm. Weary of nobility, body has no baseness. Dao without distance penetrates the world. Body without harm penetrates profit. Body without baseness penetrates nobility. Penetrating world means goodness returns. Penetrating profit means blessing returns. Penetrating nobility means virtue returns. Constant goodness penetrates spirit. True blessing penetrates life. Utmost virtue penetrates Heaven. The scripture says: ‘Thus cannot be close nor distant. Not distant from dao’s truth means knowing its longevity.’”

### Question Seventy-Five: On Remoteness  
Asked again: “What is remoteness?” The reply: “Remoteness is dao embracing longevity. Heaven is high and covers afar. Earth bears things afar. Kings are great and clear afar. Dao reveals myriad ages. Heaven reveals myriad forms. Earth births myriad things. Kings stabilize myriad people. Dao embraces all without exception. Heaven covers all without leaving. Earth bears all without failing. Kings contain all without rejecting. Dao embracing is greatness. Heaven covering is greatness. Earth bearing is greatness. Kings containing is greatness. The scripture says: ‘Great is to go; going is to be far.’ Dao not truly far, penetrating dao is near.”

### Question Seventy-Six: On Nearness  
Asked again: “What is near?” The answer: “Near is near to dao’s body, observing no-dao’s body. Near is near to dao’s home, observing no-dao’s home. Near is near to dao’s village, observing no-dao’s village. Near is near to dao’s country, observing no-dao’s country. Near is near to dao’s world, observing no-dao’s world. If body is filial, repaying parents’ grace. If home is good, like Lord Xu and General Pang. If village acts well, pitying poor and loving old. If country is clear, myriad people are abundant. If world has dao, world is mature. The scripture says: ‘Thus observe body by body. Knowing dao is truly able to act.’”

### Question Seventy-Seven: On Conduct  
Asked again: “What is conduct?” The reply: “Conduct is what the Most High practices, Heaven’s dao. Heaven and Earth say nothing, yet secretly bestow grace, giving birth to myriad things. The Most High says nothing, yet secretly bestows virtue, acting in myriad goodness. Heaven and Earth say nothing, and grace and goodness respond. The Most High says nothing, and teaching and goodness penetrate. Myriad things complete, thus people are rich. Myriad transformations clear, thus true penetration. People rich means country peaceful. True penetration means joy without affairs. People rich means each in scholar, farmer, craftsman, merchant. True penetration means unfolding Most High’s non-action. The scripture says: ‘Act the teaching without words. Dao has no place to act, virtue has no place to dwell.’”

### Question Seventy-Eight: On Dwelling  
Asked again: “What is dwelling?” The answer: “Dwelling is residing. True without emotion, form in dao. False with emotion, body lodged in world. True form connects with dao. False body responds to things. Truly forgetting form is dao. Body responding to world is virtue. Heart with emotion is confusion. Body far from world is attachment. Having dao and virtue means no confusion or attachment. No dao and no virtue means confusion and attachment. True having dao and virtue means wise and good. False without dao and virtue means foolish and evil. The scripture says: ‘Settle in dwelling, delight in custom. Forever dwelling in great nothing, thus only so.’”

### Question Seventy-Nine: On Solemnity  
Asked again: “What is solemnity?” The reply: “Solemnity is thus, thus in the Three Realms, dao manifests without restraint; floating in the Four Seas, truth hides without companion. Dao without restraint is beyond yin and yang. Truth without companion is in the azure sky. Dao’s body is neither empty nor form. True light neither wanes nor waxes. Penetrating no-thing is departing myriad things’ shell. Penetrating action is unfolding myriad wisdom’s light. Heaven’s great grace as if no grace. Accumulating great virtue as if no virtue. This is called knowing Heaven’s dao. The scripture says: ‘Only by not dwelling, thus not departing. Only delighting in dao and responding to mechanism, thus compassion for the masses.’”

### Question Eighty: On the Masses  
Asked again: “What are the masses?” The reply: “The masses are what the masses know: love of name and profit, love of right and wrong. What I am confused about: forgetting name and profit, forgetting right and wrong. The masses love name, thus have disgrace. I forget name, thus have no disgrace. The masses love profit, thus have harm. I forget profit, thus have no harm. The masses love right, thus have wrong. I forget right, thus have no wrong. The masses love wrong, thus have fault. I forget wrong, thus have no fault. The scripture says: ‘The masses are bright; I alone seem dim.’”
