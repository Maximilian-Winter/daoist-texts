# The Recorded Sayings of the Perfected Lord of Cloud-Resting Pan Mountain

The Blind Cannot Discern Blue from Yellow; the Deaf Cannot Hear the Flute’s Song

The blind cannot distinguish the colors blue and yellow; the deaf cannot appreciate the sounds of flute and pipe. Is this limitation confined to the body alone? The mind and intellect suffer likewise. As for one’s original nature—innate and pure—everyone possesses it fully. Yet, overwhelmed by accumulated dust, the clear eye grows dim; chasing after colors and sounds, seeking traces and tracks, one sinks into the evil paths, wandering through countless kalpas. Mistaking bamboo tubes for sunlight, striking copper plates for shadows of the sun—without meeting a true master, how can one tell black from white? Clinging to words and phrases only deepens confusion. Therefore, Master Cloud-Resting, compelled by compassion, applies medicine to the disease: plucking out deafness, scraping away blindness, hoping all might see through and open their hearing, so that all sights and sounds, scattered and falling away, may return to the correct dao, no longer chasing lost sheep.

Among his disciples, Master Liu Gong has long served under him, secretly recording the master’s coughs and breaths, gathering them into a collection of about one hundred and some sayings. Truly, this serves as a guide for those first awakening to the dao. He has commissioned craftsmen to carve and bind it, to spread the teaching far and wide. The solitary peak Daoist also gained access to it and passed it to his disciples. Practitioners who see it rejoice, purify themselves, and respectfully inscribe prefaces.

At the time of the Dingwei year, on the first day of the first month, disciple Lun Zhihuan respectfully composed this preface.

## Compiled by Disciple Lun Zhihuan

When the master was at Pan Mountain, he often said: “Generally, those first entering the path of the dao, if they immediately say ‘I cannot handle this, I have no foothold, no reliance,’ doubt inevitably arises. Without effort on the mind, faith falters; without faith, practice fails; without practice, one learns confusedly and erratically, growing lax over time. Now, let me speak plainly to you: what you see before your eyes, what you hear within your ears, if you can believe and act upon it, then moving from the coarse to the subtle will not mislead you. Even sounds and colors are the dao’s use. But what is that which can be believed and acted upon? Have you not seen the vast empty sky, the heavens and earth, sun and moon, mountains and waters, wind and clouds? Are these not clearly visible before your eyes? They are the model for cultivation, the gateway into the dao.

“Consider how clouds emerge from the mountains, coming and going without intention, drifting freely, unbound by the objects or scenes they pass. The Daoist’s heart should be like this. Consider the wind’s stirring, blowing and puffing life into all things, coming and going swiftly, without stagnation or lingering shadow; grass and trees and forests cannot obstruct it, it passes swiftly. The Daoist’s heart should be like this. Consider the great mountains, towering and majestic, steady and firm, unmoved and unshaken; no matter what touches them, they remain unmoved. The Daoist’s heart should be like this. Consider water’s nature: soft and lowly, benefiting grasses and plants, not contending with things, flowing to fit the shape of its container, its nature clear and pure, accumulating to form rivers and seas, embracing all streams without distinction—fish, turtles, shrimp, and crabs all included. The Daoist’s heart should be like this.

“Consider the sun and moon, whose radiance shines impartially, clear and far-reaching, sleepless day and night, bright and boundless. The Daoist’s heart should be like this. Consider Heaven above, always clear in essence, clear yet embracing, covering all things without exception, benefiting without harm. The Daoist’s heart should be like this. Consider the earth’s tranquility, silent and unmoving, bearing all things without bias or faction. The Daoist’s heart should be like this. Consider the vast empty space, boundless and limitless, embracing all, containing all, conscious yet without feeling, Heaven’s canopy and Earth’s support, embracing without discrimination, neither moving nor still, neither existent nor nonexistent, neither identical to all things nor separate from them, possessing Heaven’s clarity, Earth’s stillness, the sun and moon’s brightness, and the myriad transformations of all things—empty space is one and the same. The Daoist’s heart should be like this.

“The dao is the same as Heaven and Earth; its use is like this. One’s essence dwells within it; when cultivation ripens day by day, one naturally attains it. Movement and stillness harmonize with the dao; there is a master within. If you seek words or thought beyond this, you lose it. Having entered the profound gate, each should diligently apply themselves.”

---

### A Question: “For those beginning cultivation, how does one enter the gate of the heart and ground?”

The master replied: “Cut off once and for all the affections and attachments, the schemes and calculations, the plotting and scheming, the hearts that harm and trap others. Also sever all attachments to wine, women, wealth, anger, right and wrong, self and others, clinging and craving, selfish and evil thoughts, profit and desire—utterly abandon them all. When nothing burdens the outside, the body becomes light and free; when nothing stains the inside, the heart becomes light and free. With long practice, false thoughts vanish. Then, guard and care for yourself moment by moment: speak cautiously, moderate food and drink, reduce sleep, assist both inside and out, cleanse all dust and filth, leave nothing behind. In time, your original life spirit will naturally reveal itself; you will enjoy freedom and ease, becoming a supreme Daoist.”

---

### A Question: “How does one attain clarity and stillness in cultivation?”

The master said: “When the heart does not chase after things, that is called a settled heart. When the heart does not love things, that is called an empty heart. When the heart is both settled and empty, that is clarity and stillness. Clarity and stillness is the dao itself.”

---

### A Question: “Cultivators often say to remove emotions and desires. Is there a principle beyond this?”

The master said: “Remove emotions to reach no-emotion; remove desires to reach no-desire. Without emotion and desire, what then is your dao?”

---

### A Question: “How does one attain ‘not being bewildered’ in cultivation?”

The master said: “When the beginner’s nature is unrefined, they come and go without knowing, unable to control indulgence or restraint. When encountering circumstances or objects, they cling and then let go, muddled and confused, only resting when exhausted, unaware of themselves—this is bewilderment. It is like being reborn into another shell without knowing, waiting until debts are paid before returning; this is bewilderment. If one uses knowing and awareness exclusively, yet that knowing and awareness themselves become confused, the cultivator must, throughout the twenty-four hours, inspect themselves, not allowing any defilement to touch them. When things and objects pass lightly by the heart, that is ‘not bewildered.’”

---

### A Question: “How does one guard the matter of nature and life?”

The master said: “If you come and go within the realm of myriad dusts, entangled and bound, though you may respond in harmony, you must be the master yourself. Do not always follow after others. Let matters not disturb the heart, and the heart not obstruct matters. Like guarding the eyes: even a speck of dust causes the eyes to close. In this way, protection brings results over time. But if the heart receives, it is drawn away by other things and cannot be master.”

---

### A Question: “My thoughts continue without end; how can I clear them?”

The master said: “Sweep your heart’s ground at dawn. The more you sweep, the less stillness you find. If you want the heart ground still, cast aside the broom and dustpan.” The person bowed in thanks.

---

### A Question: “Those who cultivate must first set their resolve. How does one set resolve?”

The master said: “In movement and stillness, within all circumstances, in walking, standing, sitting, and lying down, keep your thoughts always on the dao. When demons come, do not change; when harm comes, do not flee. Whether in peace or peril, be like this. Risk this one body without turning back. Advance diligently without fear of life or death—that is a person of resolve. Hence the scripture says: ‘The resolute one is strong in practice.’”

---

When the master arrived at the Southern Palace, at the Changzhen Temple, during night sitting, he spoke broadly to the assembly:

“A beginner who leaves home but cannot stand independently must rely on the monastic community. Sometimes forming companions on the path, supporting one another, so as not to stray. Yet there are three kinds: cloud friends and rosy friends; good friends and wise friends; wild friends and strange friends.

“Those with resolve and discipline, who refine the heart ground, examine karma and blessings, sever worldly attachments, and roam freely beyond the world—these seek like-minded comrades and become friends. These are called cloud friends and rosy friends, for their hearts resemble clouds and rosy clouds, unaffected by worldly dust.

“Then there are those who study scriptures, play qin, read books, compose poetry, engage in lofty talk, praising and criticizing. These are called good friends and wise friends, for though they do not refine the heart, they cannot commit evil.

“Then there are those who neglect the heart ground, disregard scriptures, ignore karma and blessings, speak wrongly, act wildly, quarrel over trifles, boast and show off, rely on strength to win, oppress the good, and form factions. These are called wild friends and strange friends.

“After death, these three kinds have different destinations according to their deeds. Cloud friends and rosy friends ascend into the formless, feasting in the Jade Capital, becoming immortals or heavenly officials. Good friends and wise friends, with worldly hearts not yet exhausted, remain within human relations, cycling through rewards and punishments. Wild friends and strange friends, despite receiving offerings from the Ten Directions, have no merit to repay their debts, and fall into Fengdu or into animal rebirths, returning to suffer. When it comes to this, regret is too late. Wise and discerning people should carefully consider and seek their own advantage.”

---

### A Question: “How does one awaken the nature?”

The master said: “Pointing east and drawing west—such empty talk, stop it. Better to apply real effort. For example, if the heart harbors desires, vexations, ignorance of self and other, it is like a great glassy well before you. If you do not pay the slightest attention, you will fall in and never escape through countless kalpas. If you see and recognize this, and want to step down, you must first retreat quickly. This urgent retreat and care is your awakened nature. If you clearly fall into the trap of self and other, yet still point to emptiness and speak of higher matters, what use is that awakening?”

---

### A Question: “What is ‘settling the nature’?”

The master moved closer, sat upright in silence for a long while, then said: “You ask what settling the nature is.” The person was confused, bowed to the master beside him. The master said: “Zhang Gong gets drunk, Li Gong gets drunk.” The person laughed heartily.

---

### A Question: “Beginners face life and death, seeking but unclear, becoming wild and reckless. What is the meaning?”

The master said: “One thought of no birth is no death. If one cannot do this, it is because the heart holds emotion and the nature holds dust, playing with emotion and dust, birth and death unceasing. To seek liberation, respond to circumstances and let go, again and again, until not a trace remains, the original source is pure. Do not chase sounds or colors; be free everywhere, empty, still, and untroubled, enduring as Heaven and Earth, self-illuminating as the true master. For when the heart is correct, all matters are correct; when the heart is wrong, all matters are wrong. When the master is within, the six senses of love and attachment are empty; the true essence is always still. What fear is there of birth and death? When at this stage, if one still cannot gather and restrain, hiding and not abiding, rushing outward like evil spirits, wild and reckless, unable to master oneself, mistaking false joy for true joy, not knowing that joy without joy is true joy, pleasure without pleasure is true pleasure, knowledge without knowledge is true knowledge—now possessed by the knowing spirit, evil qi enters the heart, rushing wildly with no cure. The ancients sang and danced, not knowing that at that time they were freeing themselves from dryness and bonds, gaining something else to delight in. How could they recklessly indulge the heart and deceive the world?”

---

### A Question: “With eyes open there is dusty realm, with eyes closed there is dream realm, among the crowd there are favorable and adverse circumstances—how does one find stability?”

The master said: “Cultivators must gather the heart as the foundation. When encountering adversity, joyfully pass through; when encountering favor, pass through without attachment. All dusty realms have nothing to do with oneself. Even a three-year-old child in the crowd dares not oppose or offend, and is often spared. When all people oppose or offend oneself, one must be patient. Endure and forgive, and there will be merit. Respect all people; bear all difficulties. Over time, the heart ground matures, and one is stable wherever one dwells. In all circumstances, pass through ordinarily, without stirring the heart. When facing all conditions and myriad causes, the heart is stable, unstained by a single speck of dust, pure and clear, never dim day or night; this accords with the heart of sages.”

---

### A Question: “Recognizing the One, all things are complete. Also it is said: ‘Embrace the primordial and guard the One.’ What then is the One?”

The master said: “It is the undifferentiated nature before division. Once you know it, you fall into number and cannot keep the One. One gives birth to two, two gives birth to three, three gives birth to ten thousand—how can you guard it? Better to harmonize with the One and not be. Hence the patriarch said: ‘Embrace the primordial and guard the One is cultivation; earth endures, Heaven lasts, the One is nowhere.’ This One is nowhere, yet clearly reveals your original portion; it is not nothing. Hence the scripture says: ‘Knowing emptiness is not emptiness, knowing form is not form, this is called illumination.’”

---

### A Question: “Some monks study ancient cases, some study scriptures, some say ancient teachings illuminate the heart—is this so?”

The master said: “Cultivators refine their own heart, entering from the mundane to the sacred. Since leaving home, they refuse to regard the heart as the matter, only searching others’ words and phrases, making paper and ink their livelihood, entangled in knots and vines, exhausting effort—what use is this? When the lord of the underworld calls, not a single phrase or word can help. Better to know nothing and muddle through, at least somewhat alike. Now, if you apply effort to your own original matter, what need is there to seek others’ treasures? Quickly receive and use your own, and from now on, do not be deceived.”

---

The master, due to work, spoke broadly: “Once there was an immortal named Zhang under the Eastern Hall, a carpenter who never contradicted others, humble and gentle, never showing anger. All approved and often praised him, and he became known to the Perfected. The Perfected said: ‘Not yet; try him further.’ One day he was ordered to make a seat; he responded immediately. Before finishing, he was ordered to make doors and windows; he complied. Halfway through, he was ordered to make several boxes; he refused. He argued before the Perfected, wanting to settle one task before doing another. The Perfected said: ‘Previously, because all approved, you could respond without contradiction, never stirring your heart. Today, I test if you can let go.’ Cultivators, when responding to matters, must first have a master within, be free and peaceful; outwardly respond perfectly, hitting the mark every time. Which is first, which is last? All are false things, what fixed essence is there? The heart must die, the mechanism must live; only respond firmly to the present urgent matter, steadily and clearly, unmoved and undimmed—this is called constant response and constant stillness.”

---

### A Question: “Some say karma spans three lives—is this true?”

The master said: “Have you not heard the ancients say: ‘When understood, karma and obstacles are originally empty; when not understood, one must repay old debts.’ Once there was a man with a painful, unbearable sore, pus and blood flowing. He went to a lonely place and hanged himself. Such a person neither understands their nature nor accepts the karmic pus and blood debts of past lives. Though he dies by his own hand, he must repay them in the next life. How do we know this is past karma? In the previous dynasty of Emperor Zhangzong, a prince consort, governor of Zhangde Prefecture, was cruel and brutal, yet his heart was not pleased. Without reason, he beat his servants. One day, an itch appeared on his buttocks; scratching peeled the skin, then flesh split as if freshly flogged, causing unbearable pain until death. Thus, pus and blood debts must have retribution. Not only this, but all anger, hatred, slander, beating, quarrels, mutual dislike, all are old grudges from past causes, to be repaid in this life. One must accept and endure joyfully, not argue. Endurance is repayment; contention is debt unpaid, deepening grudges endlessly. Heaven’s will is to repay; even human disputes and injuries are debts. Recently, when Master Changchun first lived in the north, a general returning north met a hereditary thousand-household family in Shandong. The lady was captured. Because their family had long served the dao, they wished to redeem her by ordaining her. The master refused. The matter was discussed, and the general left north. The official asked about the refusal. The master said: ‘This person and her master have a three-year karmic debt. Now that they meet, it is time to repay.’ Three years later, she was ordained and came to see the master. Because she had long served goodness, she received this retribution. The disciples believed and bowed in thanks.”

---

The master, when a Daoist was ill, broadly said: “Cultivators regulate food and drink, maintain regular activity and rest, keep the heart and spirit peaceful, and avoid false actions. If illness comes, it is Heaven’s decree; how dare one refuse it? It is also one’s own fate, or due to past karma causing the illness. First, recognize that the four elements are false; illness teaches illness, death teaches death. The heart and mind endure calmly through changes; the heart is not on the illness. Severe illness becomes light; light illness heals itself. When nature is peaceful, turbid evil qi disperses; this is repaying illness debts and passing a critical gate. Without understanding this, the heart is restless. When ill, the heart rages, calling out, cursing Heaven and Earth, blaming others for no aid, hating others for no medicine, resenting others for no joy, accusing others for no care—only ignorance and darkness arise, karmic heart revealed, no truth in it. Not knowing life and death have fixed measure, even if anxious, no escape. Excessive restlessness unsettles the heart, which is the master of the body; if the master is unsettled, the whole body is chaotic. Have you not heard the ancients say: ‘Restless heart is the gate to hell’? Such a heart invites calamity. In such a state, light illness becomes severe; severe illness becomes death, because it disturbs the nature. If one is not moderate in all things, illness arises from self-made causes, and one suffers accordingly—who else to blame? Cultivators who work on the heart will not be like this; consider carefully.”

---

The master, when a sick person could not depart, broadly said: “Cultivators must first see through all green illusions, then see through this heap of dust called the body. In daily matters, be free and easy; at the moment of departure, one naturally attains freedom. Once in Shandong, an abbot at death lingered, unable to depart. People asked Master Changchun. The master said: ‘He clings to external things, never refining himself; thus he cannot loosen the bonds.’ He sent a message: ‘The body is not mine; nature is originally empty. If no thought arises, the whole body lets go.’ The abbot heard this and awakened, then instructed his brothers: ‘I was blinded by external green, my heart had no merit; at death I did not choose well. Now I urge you all to apply effort, cultivate body and mind, and save this great matter of life and death.’ After speaking, he passed on.

“Another Daoist at death hesitated, asking others: ‘How shall I depart?’ Some said: ‘Think of the True Master.’ He thought for days but could not leave. Others said: ‘Think of empty space.’ He still could not leave. An old immortal saw and looked at him. The man was still caught in previous thoughts and could not go. The old immortal scolded: ‘When you came, you had something; after leaving, you think of something. How can you await your fate? When the time comes, you will go.’ The sick man bowed and died.

“Generally, cultivators use external things temporarily, but their true nature is their own original truth. Apply real effort. When things and matters are passed through and loosened, how can one not be free at departure? If attached to things and matters, how can one be free at departure? Hurry to cultivate; life and death are hard to avoid. The day will come; what use is external green then? Consider carefully.”

---

The master said: “Cultivators must set resolve and discipline. Yet when they have resolve, they often cling stubbornly. Stubbornness blocks flexibility with things; when things change, they become complacent and waste time. Thus many study the dao like cow’s hair, while the wise are like the horn of the qilin. Those who have resolve do not truly understand; those who understand do not truly practice; even those who practice long do not reach the bottom. Generally, those who study the dao must first return to the ancestral root, then have resolve and discipline, must understand flexibility, focus on unity, diligently practice without ceasing, and all will be accomplished.”

---

### A Question: “What is the true constant dao?”

The master said: “Set aside ‘true constant’ for a moment. During the twenty-four hours, examine your own heart ground. Before thoughts arise, what is it? When thoughts arise, see if they are right or wrong. Wrong thoughts should be extinguished; right thoughts should be used. What are wrong thoughts? When idle, all premeditated thoughts are false and deluded. What are right thoughts? Present matters, fitting to things and benefiting life, revering superiors and comforting the multitudes, all kinds of good thoughts not for self—these are right thoughts. When still, the essence is peaceful; when active, the use is right. Neither indulgent nor restrained, neither day nor night, not the slightest dimming, always responsive and still, steady and calm—this is the true constant dao.”

---

The master said: “Cultivators have stubborn hearts; since beginningless time, they have wandered the wheel of rebirth, accumulating like mountains, countless births and deaths, until today, suddenly realizing past mistakes and seeking liberation. Thus they dare not eat by day nor sleep by night, refining this stubborn heart, trying to reverse all worldly inversions. If the heart is not refined, one will not sleep. If one acts thus, thoughts are like hair, and when touched, ignite wild fires, like a hundred years without sleep—what use is this? If the stubborn heart is not exhausted, one still wanders the wheel. To change this heart, day and night, moment by moment, in movement and stillness, this stubborn heart must be torn and crushed. Only then can one receive and use the original true spirit, which resembles Heaven and Earth, then stillness is. This dao moves, this dao opens the mouth, this dao closes the mouth—what else is there to seek? This is a Daoist freed from wine and flesh.”

---

The master often said: “Cultivators must exert effort to cast off the heavy attachments and thoughts acquired from the heart’s stains. Once effort and strength are applied to refine and discard them, even if the body reaches its limits, let go when it must be let go. How much more so with the heart, which is only falsehood? Remove each one, and there will be no vexing obstacles. If the body’s external matters are not worth minding, passing by like mosquitoes and flies, then if the heart’s attachments cannot be cast off, these are the seeds of rebirth. Once, Master Changchun lived at Panxi, often at night tigers and leopards came and went. Some were frightened and wanted to build fences at dawn. Reflecting, they thought: ‘If I have fear in this realm, wanting protection, can I avoid birth and death?’ Then they stopped, calmly letting life and death be, fear vanished, and in the midst of birth and death, stood firm, freeing many bonds at once. This is the difficult path made easy.”

---

The master said: “Cultivators must thoroughly investigate the great matter of life and death, applying effort day and night, with a clear heart and quiet six senses. When encountering sound and color, see but do not see; hear but do not hear; the inner heart does not receive. When others disturb, it is not your matter; like wind passing by, if it is your matter, respond as needed. Practice thus, and over time you will see results.”

---

The master said: “Cultivators see others’ good deeds and imitate them. Do not see others’ faults and lose yourself, nor engage in mutual disputes over right and wrong. If you hold onto right and wrong, your heart is not correct and progress is slow. Right can cover wrong; wrong always slanders right. Those who cling to self and slander others do not understand themselves; they belong to outer paths and evil schools. If you have right knowledge and right view, you will examine your own heart for bias and error. If you concern yourself with others’ faults, you are not a right person.”

---

### A Question: “What is merit and practice?”

The master said: “Closing the mouth is merit; opening the mouth is practice. What is closing the mouth as merit? Silent attainment, without thought or deliberation, sealed lips, forgetting words, not seeking others’ recognition, hiding brightness and concealing traces—this is closing the mouth as merit. What is opening the mouth as practice? Using expedients, teaching others to practice, benefiting plants and creatures, guiding the correct path—this is opening the mouth as practice.”

---

### A Question: “Seeing, hearing, eating, breathing, lifting hands, stepping feet, thinking—are these nature?”

The master said: “The dao nature is not exactly this, nor apart from this. Movement, stillness, speech, silence are the use of nature, not its essence. The essence of nature is neither movement nor stillness, neither speech nor silence. The ancients said: ‘To know the great dao, know the patriarchs; it is not apart from movement, stillness, speech, silence.’ If you identify with movement, stillness, speech, silence, you make slaves your masters. The master commands the slave; can the slave be master? All raising hands, moving feet, speaking, seeing, hearing, all forms and states, even long stillness, are slaves, not masters. The master is within and never revealed outside; yet if the master commands the servants, it takes responsibility as master.”

---

### A Question: “If one has practiced for three years, can one escape rebirth?”

The master said: “Cultivators must set firm resolve, moment by moment, diligently refining the heart, not anticipating the future. How dare one harbor pride and expect transcendence? Once a Daoist newly left home, boldly claiming: ‘I see rebirth is small; a little effort and it is done.’ With resolve and effort, he was struck by sudden grave illness, years without cure, gradually losing resolve. Can this be done with pride?”

---

### A Question: “I walk and sit alone in the mountains, personally seeing mountain spirits foretelling the future—is this true?”

The master said: “Ordinary minds cling to myriad dusts, confused and unclear. Beginners leaving home refine the dusty heart; occasionally attaining stillness, suddenly seeing still realms, then producing other scenes, gods and demons, delighting themselves with song and dance endlessly. Some claim to see and know the future; some hear others foretell events in the air, which come true; some personally see past masters and perfected immortals, who come to entrust matters of the heart. If the heart believes, it is attachment to evil; if not removed, it becomes a sickness without cure. Have you not heard the ancients say: ‘Sight, hearing, and awareness are also illnesses’? Moreover, eyes, ears, and mind belong to sound and color realms. Have you not heard the scripture say: ‘Seen but not seen, heard but not heard, spoken but not grasped, thought but not reached’? Now, if you take sound and color as real, you fall into the evil path. Once a Daoist, sitting in stillness, suddenly tasted wine in his mouth and dreamed of someone bringing wine; the next day, indeed, someone brought wine. This is the spirit’s response in emptiness, not strange; to believe it is attachment to evil. Another Daoist suddenly found his spirit leaving to roam hundreds of paces and returning, seeing his true form still sitting upright, repeated many times. This is not strange, like ordinary thoughts going out; only differing in clarity. To regard this as achievement is attachment to evil. As the saying goes: ‘A thousand auspicious signs are not as good as none; equality and stability accord with the dao.’”

---

When the assembly discussed the opening of the treasury of wisdom, words flowed forth, and the master said:

“Cultivators at first leave the realm like a mirror suddenly brightening; the treasury of wisdom opens, thoughts form into phrases, yet one must not cling. If the mind seals and fixes, without feeling but with use, it becomes mad wisdom, reaching no merit, only spirit’s use, not the dao’s essence. Do not rush to rely on this as power; but to nurture it is merit.”

---

When people discussed dwelling on the mountain, the master said:

“Cultivators must recognize when things come and respond to pass through. Responding once is like responding once more. Once, a Daoist lived on a mountain, wearing grass clothes and eating wood, vowing never to descend, thinking to escape all worldly burdens. One day, two men came, each holding weapons, demanding food. The master quickly cooked mountain fruits to offer. Before softening, one reached into the pot to taste, angrily saying: ‘If you give such things to people to eat, I will smash the pot.’ The master said nothing at first, seeing their anger and harsh words. He secretly planned, then went out to find his hidden stick, shouting: ‘Two men, come out! You cannot approach me.’ The two left laughing: ‘Master lives on the mountain, growing such pride; better to descend and be a commoner.’ They left and suddenly vanished. The master suspected they were sages testing him, and regretted. This is failing the test of circumstance.”

---

When the assembly discussed unmoving heart, the master said:

“Once in Shandong, a Daoist told his master he had extinguished the fire of ignorance. The master said: ‘When the fire of ignorance is out, the heart does not move; that is good.’ One day, the master sent someone to test him. At dusk, the visitor came to the gate, which was closed. The man struck the gate fiercely; the master responded, voice strained, and reluctantly opened. The visitor was wild and rude, entering without removing shoes, jumping on the seat, showing no respect. The master was angry and reprimanded him. The visitor smiled: ‘I dare not be so; the master sent me to test your unmoving heart. Now I see it; no need to test further.’ The visitor was ashamed, speechless. Generally, cultivators with some skill dare not be arrogant. When unaware, the test reveals the true moment; if discouraged and withered, no arrogance arises. Once arrogant, the test fails. Even reaching unmoving, there is still more to do.”

---

When the assembly discussed guarding the circle and stillness, the master said:

“Once a Daoist sat in circle for years. One day, friends asked: ‘Brother, having attained stillness, can you use it in the noisy world? Do you truly have the unmoving place?’ The man arrogantly remained silent. A friend said: ‘I have a touchstone to test truth. Brother, test your heart after years of stillness.’ The man said: ‘What is there to say about stillness?’ The friend said: ‘Like a weary beast with fur and horns, return its debts.’ The man grew angry and cursed. The friend laughed: ‘This is what you have attained in the circle; the test is true.’ The man resented and cut ties for life. This man never refined his heart in circumstance; though sitting still a hundred years, he has no true place. Like a tethered horse, once the rope is cut, it runs as before.”

---

The master often said: “Cultivators refine the heart like a master carpenter cutting wood: first straighten the heart’s ink, then gradually chop away the crooked and evil parts, shaping it into useful timber, ready for use. Do not move the heart’s ink; if lost, there is no model to follow. When crooked parts are cut away and the ink is straight, it harmonizes with others and can make all tools.”

---

The master said: “Cultivators often have no matters on the heart, upright and proper, moment by moment, fully investigating the place where their original life spirit dwells, clear and undimmed, merging with empty space as one. With accumulated days and efforts, spiritual efficacy naturally appears. When seeing various acts, better to rest and investigate yourself. If always using the heart on things, passing days idly, you are no different from worldly hearts.”

---

When the assembly discussed managing the monastery gate, the master said:

“Cultivators living in the monastery must measure their strength and activity, living simply, lightly, and swiftly. Do not compete with the world for fame or profit, lest you lose your original heart and forget the great matter of nature and life. This is the proper principle. If you refine the heart here, unwilling to stay or go, leaving suffering behind, gaining peace and stability, receiving all directions, benefiting self and others, at ease accumulating practice, both merit and practice are complete. If you do not refine the heart and regard things as self, you become strange and greedy, narrow in habit, sinfully seeking the world, losing your future. The master, encouraging the assembly to live in the monastic community, said: ‘Master Danyang said: Learning the dao means living in the monastic community, measuring shallow and deep, choosing the good as confidants. If you do not understand the ultimate principle, you cannot grasp the essence. In the monastic community, teaching and pointing out, outlining and leading, cultivating the supreme heart ground, this is no small matter. Some without insight do not seek friends, do not live in the monastery, nor consider the heart ground, going south and north, crossing mountains and rivers, wasting straw sandals. Only seeking convenience and ease, touching and bumping, then leaving early. When it comes to settling, one seeks a good place and conditions, not knowing what is truly urgent for oneself, not knowing how to pass the days, only seeking ease. Not knowing that the great matter of life and death is approaching, watching you hesitate. How can one pass days idly, wasting time? Having left home, what do you seek? Wise gentlemen, consider carefully.’”

---

When workers showed agitation, the master said:

“Cultivators, though external things are false, must respond. Respond without self; the heart’s essence is empty space. When matters come, no obstruction; empty space does not obstruct myriad things, myriad things do not obstruct empty space. Like Heaven and Earth, myriad phenomena move spontaneously without obstruction. If the heart holds self, matters must be met; then there is agitation, restlessness, stumbling, bumping, and the heart moves. Once the heart moves, stability is lost. Even if working hard all day, it is labor without merit. Among the great assembly and in work, guard your heart, do not be easily moved, always examine your faults, do not mind others’ faults. This is merit and practice. When matters come, accept them; in all circumstances and myriad dusts, do not chase after others. When the heart is clear, do not discriminate. Pass days thus; the beginner does not regress and naturally attains merit.”

---

The master said: “Cultivators with one part of effort produce one part of pride; with ten parts of effort, ten parts of pride. Once pride arises, there is self; self and pride are great obstacles. How can one attain the empty heart and extinguish it? One must add great effort, crush body and mind beneath all things, always stay behind others. Think: ‘I am far less than others,’ then you can cast off pride. When the heart is like the vast void, there is no self; no self means harmony with the dao.”

---

The master said: “Cultivators’ stillness realms are many, all created by the recognizing spirit. Because of stillness, they appear, enticing the heart master. Have you not heard the ancients say: ‘All forms are false; the heart wants to cast off recognition, yet recognition remains, creating forms and images, gods and demons, confusing the heart master.’ If the master does not move, seeing is like not seeing, essence like empty space, nowhere to abide, naturally fading away, no realm to bewitch, no thing to harm. Once a Daoist’s heart rested; one day, countless evil ghosts came flying. The person calmed the heart, essence like empty space, dark and indistinct, risking life and death, letting be; the demons dispersed. Because the master is present, still and unmoving, how can demons exist? Yet the heart is not exhausted, so these images appear. When essence is pure, they vanish.”

---

### A Question: “How is the merit of those who guard the circle?”

The master said: “Once, when Master Changchun was in Shandong, he came to a temple where one sat in circle, the assembly fasting. Someone informed the master: ‘The man in the circle wishes to speak with you.’ The master ordered the fasting to finish before meeting. Unexpectedly, he went out, struck the circle’s door with a staff several times. The man thought it was a common person and angrily responded. The master returned. After fasting, the assembly asked again to meet. The master said: ‘He has been tested. This man’s self and other remain; he is not ready for discourse.’ He left. Generally, dwelling in stillness is a great matter of nature and life, gathering and stabilizing, nurturing as merit, unmoved by circumstance—this is proof. Now, hearing such empty sounds, hearts move early; how can all evil realms be passed? Even in the circle, what use is that? Receiving offerings but owing debts, how can one not repay? Better to refine the heart amid movement and circumstance; this is a person with insight.”

---

### A Question: “Cultivators say knowledge and awareness are illnesses. What is the meaning?”

The master said: “True knowledge is the knowledge of not knowing; true awareness is awareness without awareness. The original true spirit, confused for countless kalpas, now awakens—this is called awakening. All knowledge and views arise from this. If you say there is knowledge and awareness, yet desire constant knowledge and awareness, you bind and entangle yourself, burning yourself without illness. If you are always unaware, you pass into another shell. Once awakened to the original knowledge and awareness, all are useful; use them as needed, but not constantly.”

The master said: “Cultivators’ dusty hearts cease, worldly worries vanish, and their original true nature alone appears. This is the innate master from beginningless time. Accept it, be free and at ease; all dharma realms are instantly clear. When at this stage, one must hide brightness and conceal traces, protect and nurture; the more, the greater the merit. If you display and proclaim, you unknowingly diminish your light.”

---

The master said: “Cultivators’ natures vary in sharpness and dullness. The dull should not cling firmly; better to dwell in the monastic community, humble in heart, forming affinities with those who understand principle and illuminate the heart ground; when affinity matures, they naturally lead you into the dao, awakening gradually. If your nature is dull and sluggish, with no insight, daily associating with similar types, mingling with worldly dust, familiar with worldly conditions, you will surely regress. Or encounter demon realms, see hells, no one to rescue you, sinking ever deeper—how grievous!”

---

The master said: “Once one dwelling in circle heard people speak of the ground. After entering the circle, he wanted to see the ground. The heart held this thought; as the thought arose, it appeared. Not knowing it was false, hearing sounds, seeing colors, imagining in the heart—all false. He saw golden boys and jade girls, true immortals and sages appearing in broad daylight—also false realms. Created by deluded thoughts, he took them as the ground and could not dispel them, clouding a lifetime, attaching to evil and spirits. Yet the ground is where ancient people’s hearts reach stability and rest, hence the name. Like a person’s dwelling, clearing thorns and rubble, leveling the ground to live upon—that is the ground. Cultivators’ heart grounds are stable, unmoved by matters; this is unmoving ground. Unstained by myriad dusts; this is pure ground. Revealing one’s original dharma body clearly and distinctly; this is perfect bright ground. The ground has boundaries and place; beyond place and name is the profound beyond profound. How can one say seeing and hearing and imagining is this?”

---

The master said: “Non-action is the way of Heaven; action is the way of man. Non-action is like Heaven; action is like man. Like a person carrying a load, if both ends are balanced, it stays steady; if one end is lost, it tilts. If both ends are lost, even the load vanishes, returning to the original place.”

---

The master said: “Once, when it rained under the Eastern Hall, the steward invited all, young and old, to move broken things. All competed to help, except one old immortal who sat calmly without moving. When done, the assembly sat in a circle, and someone said to Master Changchun. The master scolded: ‘How many can truly refine the heart to rest like a precious pearl? Measure each person’s heart and deeds. Generally, those who attain are precious.’”

---

The master said: “Once, under Master Changchun, a kitchen worker was known for gentleness and humility, never showing agitation. The master knew and secretly sent someone to test. One morning, kitchen utensils were moved elsewhere. The worker tried to make porridge, but rice and pot were displaced; he sought ladles but could not find them, causing overflow and great agitation. The master said: ‘Even if it all overflows, these are external things; why destroy your heart?’ The worker realized and bowed in thanks.”

---

A doctor asked: “I practice medicine and have revived over one hundred dead people. What is the result?”

The master replied: “Even if you save all people under Heaven, it is not as good as saving your own life and death. Worldly blessings have limits; cultivating to the place beyond birth and death is limitless blessing.”

---

A craftsman asked: “I build great halls without charging wages. With such sincerity, what result is there?”

The master said: “Not as good as a pure person sitting silently for an hour. For actions have blessings and losses; non-action’s blessing has no loss.”

---

The master often taught the assembly: “Born into the world, all deeds have retribution. Those who embody the way attain the dao; those who do good receive blessings; those who commit evil receive evil. Those who love are loved; those who hate are hated. Those who respect are respected; those who are arrogant are scorned. The lowly are lowered; the faithful are trusted; those who benefit others are benefited; those who harm others are harmed. The proud are suppressed; those who seek precedence are contested; the strong are opposed. Hence it is said: ‘Plant orchids and get fragrance; plant millet and get grain.’ All are laws of retribution. If you act with selfishness and cunning to win hearts, you lose the truth.”

---

The master said: “Cultivators must avoid speaking of others’ faults and right and wrong, or discussing rise and fall. All worldly matters not concerning oneself should not be spoken of or thought about. Speaking of right and wrong is losing oneself. If you refine the heart and constantly examine your faults, how can you have time to manage others’ affairs? Everyone has merits; imitate the good, avoid evil, and gradually reach rest.”

---

The master said: “Many say cultivators, if they stay in the village, have attained the dao; if they abstain from meat and wine, they ascend; if they give up family attachments, they become immortals. Give up attachment to others’ love; give up love for all beings. Only the self remains, utterly unrecognized. Sleep and attain the dao, or do not sleep. If not a good companion, do not speak useless words. When matters come, do not rejoice; when matters fail, do not grieve. Learn from those better than yourself; teach those worse. Those who harm you bring fortune; those you harm bring misfortune. Words exceed deeds, and deeds surpass words. Desire and passion belong to human affairs; the dustless heart is the immortal way. Those willing to be low are high; those willing to be poor are rich. Return to the constant and accord with the dao; follow reason and accord with people. The right path should be walked; the evil gate avoided. The thorough dao brightens virtue; essence and use are complete. This is called Quanzhen.”

---

The master said: “Ancients learning the dao, if the heart is not clear, do not travel a thousand miles seeking a teacher. If you find one whose heart and mind resonate, clear and without doubt, then perhaps you dwell in a garden or a forest, begging in the market, or establishing a temple, resting the heart and guarding the dao without change or ruin—this is the highest cultivation. Some who leave home have unclear nature, are lazy to seek teachers, proud and competitive, stubbornly holding their own views, feigning high dao, losing merit and practice, falling into emptiness. They accept offerings but do not consider how their own virtue is exhausted. Such people neither belong in gardens nor begging; when life and death come, they are useless, for they refuse to work at the root. Even after a hundred years, nothing is gained.”

---

The master said: “Cultivators tidy their hearts like a carved wooden saint statue sitting in the hall. Whether alone all day or surrounded by crowds, with incense and flowers offered, or with coming and going of slander, it is the same. Only the wooden statue is not alive and aware, not illuminating the dao and virtue, nor abiding in things.”

---

The master said: “Daoists refine the heart like casting gold into a rooster. Though shaped and colored like a rooster, the heart remains unmoved, standing apart from the flock. Though roosters fight, none dare approach. Those embodying the dao have hearts like cold ashes, bodies like withered wood; though the world is full of fighters, none can contend with them. Hence the scripture says: ‘Only by not contending can one not be contended with.’”

---

The master said: “This essence and use, without self or other, upright and proper true heart, inherited from before Heaven and Earth, cannot be said to exist or not exist. Ancient and modern sages and all old Daoists have attained and used this. Thousands of scriptures and even the great Buddhist canon speak only of this. Heaven also arises from this; Earth also arises from this; all things and empty space are ruled by this message. When understood, one is not led astray by any circumstance or thought, nor deceived by the six senses. This is the daily use of immortals, the path of sages, and the future of Daoists.”

---

The master said: “Those dwelling in monastic communities gather together; not everyone is equal, nor all the same. Like a great mountain, with all kinds of plants: some unfit, some useful, some independent, some dependent, some spiritual seedlings and auspicious herbs, some wild brambles and thorns. All different, following nature and order. The mountain stands majestic, choosing none, embracing all. Flowing water, piled stones, dense forests, abundant grass, beasts running, birds singing—all are wondrous manifestations. Each supports the other, like hemp among thistles, standing upright without support, enduring Heaven and Earth, each attaining fulfillment. If you try to cut long or extend short, turning green into yellow, how can each find peace? You lose their nature.”

---

The master said: “Once, while stewarding in Shandong, I shut the door all day, not engaging in affairs for over ten years. With stillness as heart, no merit or practice arose. Sitting alone where no one touched me, encountering no circumstance or thing—how can the heart be judged good or bad? This is empty passing of time. If Heaven does not favor things, seasons do not proceed; if Earth does not favor things, all things do not grow. If you cannot benefit yourself and others, what merit is there? Hence Master Changchun said: ‘Movement benefits people and things; this accords with the way of Heaven and Earth.’”

---

The master said: “If the mysterious gate is blocked, the heart ground unclear, busy with karmic consciousness, unable to be non-action, it is due to lack of blessing and virtue. One must apply effort in the teaching, according to one’s portion, establish merit and deeds, receive and welcome visitors, be humble, respect teachers and friends, always use expedients, reject selfishness and evil, and over time affinity matures, advancing day by day, naturally penetrating. Unable to bear the empty load of both ends, unable to be non-action or action, drifting through days with no merit or practice. When settled, watch your step; when sweet, watch your mouth; do not meddle in worldly affairs; do not stick your head out; indulge body and mind; fear not spirits; reckoning day will come. Have you not heard Master Changchun say: ‘When the heart ground is cultivated, all worldly affairs are abandoned; teaching requires great effort and dust labor. Without heart ground effort, and no teaching effort, drifting through days—consider who you are.’”

---

The master said: “Fate and conditions are numbered, not by human effort. One must follow nature, wait calmly for fate. Inner work and outer practice depend on the heart. If you can apply effort, you have merit. Whether acting or not, each obtains their own. If the teaching gate is not open, one must hide and connect the heart with Heaven. When the teaching gate opens, outer work also responds, harmonizing Heaven and man. Merit does not tire of more; practice does not tire of breadth. Only with a firm heart can one accomplish.”

---

The master said: “The dao is everywhere, in every place, all colors are true. It depends on one’s momentary use; what else is there? Yet human hearts are heavily obstructed by dust and attachments, not understanding the root, picking leaves and seeking branches, following waves—few turn back. Even with deep study, if not seeking truth, twisting and fabricating, seeing gods and ghosts, placing heads atop heads, turning back and forth, unaware that illusion bodies are limited, light and shadow cannot be held, not a breath remains—what then?”

---

The master said: “In daily use, the heart has no distractions, the mind does not wander, letting go without losing, controlling without binding, clear mind recognizing dharma, leaving wisdom and emptiness behind. Throughout the twelve hours, thoughts arise moment by moment. If stuck in the present, that is not the principle; if apart from the present, no such thing exists. Knowing movement and stillness, knowing coming and going, letting go of all, without attachment or obstruction—this is a free and easy person. But saying all is false, one must understand the message.”

---

The master said: “Heaven and Earth are parents of all things. Heaven covers all; Earth carries all. They do not distinguish good or evil; equally cover and illuminate. Thus those above are Heaven’s mandate. They should cover like Heaven, nurture and protect all below, without dividing me and you, high and low. Those below are also Heaven’s appointed, should serve Heaven like Earth, revering and obeying those above, not daring to slack even slightly. Being between Heaven and Earth, one must accord with Heaven and Earth’s dao. Otherwise, there will be reckless acts and calamities.”

---

The master said: “Cultivators’ original school has no loss. In practice, they use intention; in things and circumstances, they quickly pass through. In human affairs, they do not cling. No selfish or evil thoughts arise; not a speck stands; not a grain is stained; bright and clear, not attached to emptiness or existence, not clinging to dharma forms or self views. Together with others’ brightness, mutually supporting and harmonizing, this is the sage’s position. There is even more that is suspicious.”

---

The master said: “Cultivators act and hide according to their portion, choosing and discarding as appropriate, humble in heart, upright in principle, discerning movement and stillness’s source, moderating seeing and hearing’s use. Severing all causes, one mind true and constant, eternal and unchanging.”

---

The master said: “Daoists daily embody Heaven’s law and Earth’s method, always clear and still, bright and undimmed, aiding things and benefiting life. Though mingled in myriad dusts and conditions, the true source is pure and silent, without interruption. They naturally escape birth and death’s bonds. This is a great matter. Alas, those who do not awaken have no master within, desires attack inside, roots and dust entice outside, no freedom. From this arises the four births’ cycle, the six paths’ wandering. Changing skins, it is hard to be like today.”

---

The master said: “Those who follow the dao embrace simplicity and purity, silently moving, removing emotions and desires, diminishing and preserving, acting without selfishness, doing things clearly, bending oneself to follow others, cultivating benevolence and accumulating virtue. Every fault must be removed; every subtle merit accumulated; right and wrong both vanish; heart and dharma both forgotten; then the way above is naturally reached.”

---

The master said: “Cultivators must leave home for this great matter of nature and life. After many years without awareness, moved by things, they learn only verbal tricks, a hundred kinds of skills, but only serve as slaves and maids. How do I know? Those who rely on skill always want to show off before others. This is not the matter of a pure and non-action master. Thus wise ones are not used by the wise; fools use them. Skilled are not used by the skilled; the clumsy use them. Like the eloquent speaking, the silent listening—consider carefully who is busy and who is idle. Those who want to cultivate must have clear heart and keep foolishness; then all worldly wisdom and skill serve them.”

---

The master said: “The secret transmission of the dao cannot be sought with intention, nor with no mind; know by not knowing, obtain by not obtaining. The world’s confused seek the dao by clothing, by words, by demeanor, by dharma forms, and all fail to grasp the whole. They do not know that without traces, seeking by traces is not dao. Investigate where traces come from; know that beyond sound and color, beyond fabrication, beyond demeanor, beyond dharma forms, there is something within. This cannot be known by knowledge or recognition. Only this original portion, perfectly complete, truly real, accords with Heaven and Earth, sages, ghosts, and all things—such a great matter. How can dust, sound, and traces reveal it? Master Danyang said: ‘True joy and true leisure have no discussion; the subtle and marvelous surpass all calculation. At the place beyond calculation, it is near.’”

---

The master said: “Those who leave home and dwell long in the monastic community, receiving instruction day and night, refining day and night, yet remain confused and stagnant, drifting and unruly, unable to be empty and still—how much more so those who walk alone in the world, entangled in worldly feelings and attachments, obstructing the dao’s causes, each point a snare, unaware. Even when meeting sages, they cannot be transformed, twisting and binding, deceiving the neighborhood, sinking deeper, fortune fading, karma growing, gradually deepening. If willing to turn back, salvation is still possible. Otherwise, turning from the dao, helpless, hell is not far.”

---

The master said: “Those who learn the dao must not tire of questioning. Like walking a road, diligent inquiry prevents confusion. When asking about small skills, without a teacher none can attain. How much more the great dao, unseen and unheard, initial awakening without encounter—how can one understand? The greatest suffering is life and death; without a close person, how to escape? Hence it is said: ‘Ancients learning the dao do not rush; serve true masters until old age. If you do not know where to start, nor approach the wise, even with resolve and practice, you will err in countless ways.’”

---

The master said: “Those who learn the dao only endure hardship for self and benefit others, secretly accumulating merit and practice. If they indulge in unrighteous acts, they not only disgrace the teaching but bring disaster upon themselves. Their bodies and mouths are not pure or frugal, no different from the world. Thus, receiving ten directions’ offerings is not convenient; joy in it brings suffering in return. When life and death arrive, there is no excuse. Being under the teaching, why not refine the heart?”

---

### A Question: “Cultivators who do not sleep all night—what is the meaning?”

The master said: “Those who do not sleep seek to refine the heart. If the heart is not gathered, what use is it? Those gambling, playing chess, weaving, spinning, grinding, who do not sleep all night—are they all Daoists? These twelve hours, led by desire, lure and disturb the spirit like mosquitoes biting the skin, hence no sleep. Cultivators are different; sleep is a desire. If not transformed, it breeds evil and confusion, darkness and ignorance, belonging to the yin realm. Like guarding against thieves, sitting upright waiting, the thief retreats. Focusing on refining the heart, fearing wandering. The heart has no fixed essence; in yang it is bright, in yin it is dark; when familiar conditions vanish, non-action and purity, the pearl of nature is clear—this is why one does not sleep day and night.”

---

### A Question: “Cultivators willingly endure poverty and hardship. What is the principle?”

The master said: “If you only regard poverty, hunger, and cold as true, then all poor children on the streets are immortals. Cultivators take virtue as heart, purity as thought, cutting away deceit, greed, and false acts, casting them away at once, forgetting form and self, never minding external things. Hence it is said: ‘Covering skin and flesh with clothes, choosing better or worse; filling stomach with food, choosing finer or coarser. Only to save life and death, refining the heart is the matter.’ Thus they do not mind bodily suffering.”

---

### A Question: “Do future sins and blessings still exist?”

The master said: “Do not speak of the future yet; see the present. If you generate a single good thought, wanting to burn incense and bow before a holy master, holding incense in hand, making a vow: ‘May my family be safe, increase blessings and longevity.’ This is not a mind of doing good, nor expecting blessings; even if blessings come, you do not know. Those who cultivate good know to do so openly but receive rewards secretly; thus they never know. If you generate a single evil thought, hold a knife and kill a person, the moment you raise the heart, you must bear death. This cannot be done in clear and just places; secretly and unknowingly, evil acts soon reveal and you repay death. This is not hoping for sin and receiving sin; this is clear sin. Those who do evil act secretly but receive openly. This is certain for humans. Moreover, Heaven watches what people do not know; where can one escape? One must be cautious.”

---

### A Question: “Is there truly Heaven and Hell as said?”

The master said: “Heaven is the yang realm, master of good and blessing. Hell is the yin realm, master of evil and calamity. Ancients established teachings; Heaven and Hell arise from the human heart, corresponding to heart’s actions. Those always clear and still, benefiting all and practicing good, bright and undimmed, belong to the yang realm. All evils, pits and traps, heresies and darkness, growing and accumulating filth and dust, are recorded in the black register, rejected by humans and gods; the heart master is distressed, suffering mingles, no one rescues—this is hell. Ancients said: ‘Clear heart and calm mind is the path to Heaven; wild heart and restless mind is the gate to Hell.’ Like a mountain path rumored to have bandits who kill travelers; if one believes and retreats, no harm comes. If one disbelieves and stumbles forward drunk, if no bandits, no harm; if bandits exist, one falls victim and regrets too late. The teaching of Hell is likewise. Generally, better to do good than evil. Good may have no reward, but no sin; evil forcibly advances, calamity follows. Now, if you do not repent, how can you know in the dark?”

---

### A Question: “It is said everyone has the matter above; why then refine?”

The master said: “If the heart is unrefined, it is like white gold ore in stone, unrefined, just ore. Placed in a great furnace, refining removes dross, separates true metal, becoming gold no longer ore. Cultivators are likewise. The heart, originally confused and stained, is like ore. With resolve as great cold, wisdom as craftsman, diligently refining, leaving not a trace, producing one’s original unobstructed true heart. Once true, no longer false; one must protect, strengthen, and preserve, naturally receiving and using. This is the ancient perfect treasure pearl.”

---

### A Question: “If one reaches the place of pure stillness and non-action, is that liberation?”

The master said: “Speaking of essence, it seems so but is not. The ultimate place cannot be spoken or thought, cannot be known by knowing, or recognized by recognition; subtle beyond naming, then it corresponds. Neither apart from movement and stillness, nor identical to them—how can it be defined as non-action and purity?”

---

### A Question: “I heard Master Danyang said awakening to death leads quickly to the dao. What is the meaning?”

The master said: “Cultivators should regard this body as a condemned prisoner, dragged into the market, step by step nearing death, mindful of death, cutting off all matters. Though sounds and colors, circumstances and splendor surround, eyes see nothing, ears hear nothing, thoughts all forgotten, the body abandoned—how much more other things? Refining the heart thus, one quickly sees results, gaining life in death, neither born nor dead. Beginners seeking the dao must treat life and death as urgent. Life is but a moment; if a breath does not come, it is death’s place. Apply effort urgently, diligently, cast off mundane heart, benefit self and others, mutually saving—do not drift idly.”

---

### A Question: “If the heart is unstained, free and at ease with conditions, does that accord with the dao?”

The master said: “Arising mind without attachment is attachment; mind without stain is also attachment to unstained. When you want stillness and stability, you fall into intention. Letting go and relying on others also becomes wrong view. Without stain and attachment is like medicine: medicine cures disease; when disease is gone, medicine remains, eventually causing medicine-disease. Only when words and thoughts cease does one arrive home; no more questions on the path.”

---

The master said: “The dao has no words, only pointing to good and evil. Good leads to unsurpassed transcendence, with Heaven and no Hell. Evil leads to endless suffering, with Hell and no Heaven. Dividing these two paths depends on confusion and awakening. Awakening instantly makes a sage; confusion sinks into endless kalpas. Fortunate to have human life—should you not think on this?”

---

The master said: “All sages follow the same path, differing only in clarity and confusion. Clarity makes a sage; confusion makes a commoner. Common hearts refuse to sever feelings and attachments, abandon falsehood and evil, chase after circumstances, flow with emotions, seek momentary pleasure, accumulate kalpas of calamity, unaware, unthinking, unawakened.”

---

The master said: “Cultivators must first understand their original portion, then comprehend teaching and transformation. If the original school is not understood, it is like a person without eyes, unable to distinguish paths, stepping wrongly. If teaching and transformation are unclear, it is like a person with eyes sitting in darkness, holding biased views. Both must be understood to respond perfectly. If neither is understood, it is like sitting in great darkness without eyes—when will one emerge?”

---

### A Question: “Daoists often speak of the Golden Elixir. What is it?”

The master said: “It is the original true nature. Because it is swift, strong, clear, transforming and melting, it is called gold. Having been refined and forged, perfectly complete, unbroken through kalpas, it is called elixir. Its essence is like empty space, clear and bright, not a speck attached, not a dust stained, shining and dazzling, illuminating all directions. Hence the patriarch said: ‘The original true nature is called the Golden Elixir; the four falsehoods are the furnace refining the ball. Not stained, not thinking, removing false thoughts, naturally revealing itself to ascend the immortal altar.’ People speak of the Golden Elixir as having form and shape, making it, and clinging to desire and passion—this is the vision of hell, the work of lust and evil, deviating from the human path, entering the paths of animals.”

---

The master said: “Cultivators, in all matters where there is no involvement, where dust does not stain, where one accords with Heaven and Earth, if you investigate thoroughly here, then Heaven and Earth will not oppose, and later Heaven’s timing will be observed. If Heaven does not oppose, how much more humans? How much more ghosts and spirits?”

---

### A Question: “What is the mysterious and subtle?”

The master said: “Who taught you to ask this?” The person bowed: “I came up with it myself.” The master said: “Then you will naturally understand.” The person laughed and bowed.

### A Question: “Not pursuing past, not anticipating future, what about the present?”

The master said: “Extinguish movement but not illumination; more, understand who extinguishes movement. If understood, the authority is in your hand; to extinguish or not is your choice.”

---

### A Question: “If not asking about future or past mind, what is present mind?”

The master looked directly and said: “This is not present.” Then lowered his head: “This is not present.” He asked: “Do you understand?” The person laughed: “I do not.” The master said: “Opening your eyes wide, you cannot grasp one present; how much less past or future?”

---

### A Question: “What is calamity and blessing?”

The master said: “Stack wood to form forest, stack stones to form mountain, accumulate water to form sea; accumulate good to form blessing, accumulate evil to form calamity. The source of calamity and blessing is the heart; only by accumulation do they form. Can you not be cautious?”

---

### A Question: “What is good and evil?”

The master said: “All good hearts are good; all unbalanced hearts are evil. People do not know that unknown good is the greatest good; unknown evil is the greatest evil. Beyond good and evil is another matter above.”

---

### A Question: “Daoists have illness; ordinary people have illness; what is the difference?”

The master said: “Once Master Danyang was ill; doctors could not diagnose his pulse. Huqiuzi sat upright; fortune tellers could not grasp his truth. Why? Because the heart is not in things, creation cannot move it; nature does not leave the root, ghosts and spirits cannot measure it. How much more ordinary doctors and diviners? This is different from ordinary people.”

---

The master said: “Cultivators’ eyes do not open; the circle does not arise. They only seek others’ traces, judging words and phrases, never finding the truth. Like a blind person, though hearing others speak of the sun and moon’s light, never seeing it themselves. Because they never apply effort to their own heart.”

---

### A Question: “In movement and stillness, what is the realm?”

The master said: “When the heart is clear and still, even in crowded noisy markets, bustling affairs do not concern oneself. Others’ disturbances are like wind passing by; if it concerns oneself, respond as needed. Thus, in movement, one is unhindered; in stillness, also unhindered. There are even more misleading matters.”

---

### A Question: “You say to harmonize light with dust, yet also say not to attach to matters. How so?”

The master said: “Heaven is Heaven; Earth is Earth; mountain is mountain; water is water; things are things; I am I. Though mingled, how can they attach?”

---

### A Question: “Ten thousand forms and shapes, each different—how to see one essence?”

The master said: “Heaven is dao; Earth is dao; all things are dao. That is dao; this is dao. Though forms differ, dao is everywhere. How can it be different?”

---

### A Question: “All seek pleasure; Daoists seek suffering. Why?”

The master said: “People do not know true joy. They take contentment as joy, led by desire into suffering, mistaking suffering for joy. Daily calculating, seeking worldly pleasure, if not attained, worry and suffering disturb the spirit, never free—this is great suffering. Daoists do not seek joy; their hearts abide in the dao. Encountering suffering, they are not suffering; without suffering, they are always joyful, hearts at ease. Where there is joy, there is suffering; where no joy, no suffering. Heart without joy or suffering is true joy.”

---

### A Question: “How to understand cause and effect of sin and blessing?”

The master said: “Sin and blessing belong to the shell of yin and yang. If you can escape the shell of yin and yang, naturally there is no sin or blessing. What is the shell of yin and yang? Whenever the heart arises a trace of selfish, evil, profit, desire, it belongs to the yin shell. Whenever a trace of good thought arises, it belongs to the yang shell. In yin, there is evil retribution; in yang, good retribution. If you have refined the heart essence like empty space, neither good nor evil, with no attachment, you are master. Then calamity and blessing do not touch you; cause and effect cannot bind you. This is one who has escaped the shell of yin and yang. Household people without a single good thought in the heart, throughout the twelve hours, only seeking wealth and profit, killing and trapping others, a mass of ignorance and karmic heart, only falling within the yin-yang shell. On the yang path they cannot go; how to escape the shell? You must have no sin, no blessing, no cause and effect—how difficult! You create it yourself; how to avoid? Thus bow your head and close your eyes, and let the lord of the underworld handle it.”

### A Question: “What is the truth of future rebirth?”

The master said: “One life forms the mold of the next according to emotions. Good deeds form a good mold; evil deeds form an evil mold. Until this karmic body is exhausted and one leaves the shell, like iron melted into gold liquid, the maker pours it into the mold made by oneself, becoming human or other beings, self-made and self-suffered. The maker does not intend to make you an animal or six paths; you create your own shell, falling into it with no escape. First the nature, then the form. Like cruel ones become snakes, stingy ones become dogs, lustful killers become pigs, greedy tyrants become wolves—these are the great categories. Between Heaven and Earth, ten thousand forms cannot be exhausted; all self-made and self-suffered. Hence the ancients said: ‘Like gold and stone, transformed into gold and stone; like water and fire, transformed into water and fire.’ This is true. Losing human life in a moment, no return for kalpas—should you not think on this?”

### A Question: “I am old and cannot learn much; please say one phrase of the supreme, mysterious, and wondrous.”

The master said: “Take away your seeking of the supreme, mysterious, and wondrous—then it is.”

### A Question: “All teachings in the world claim to be right and others wrong; who is truly right or wrong?”

The master said: “There are two ends: cultivators and those responding to the world. Cultivators refine the heart like Heaven’s purity and stillness, like the sun and moon’s brightness, like the four seasons’ transformations, able to respond to matters, returning to the root of dharma. Do not ask further; this is the true dao’s function, only cultivators can do it. Those who only recite words and wear dharma forms, making appearances to please all, are branches and leaves responding to the world, not cultivation or true dao. This is temporary use. Moreover, hearts contend for self and other, wealth and profit, like worldly people—how can this be the true teaching? The discerning see this.”
