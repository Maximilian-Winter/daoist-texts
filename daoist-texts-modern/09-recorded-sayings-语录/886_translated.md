# The Precious Edict of the Eleven Luminaries

With utmost sincerity, one turns the heart to bow in reverent submission.  
The Five Stars and the Six Luminaries,  
The Sun and Moon Sovereign Lords,  
Hold firmly the yin and yang,  
Expanding and contracting the great work of creation,  
Bringing forth all beings and things.  

Though the distinctions of noble and humble differ,  
The fundamental principle of fortune and calamity remains one.  
To them we turn our hearts and bow in respect,  
Calling upon their merciful grace.  

From above, they can dispel Heavenâ€™s calamities;  
From below, they can ward off poisons and harm.  
The stars follow their ordained courses,  
Diseases vanish in their wake,  
The altars and lands rest in peace,  
And the people flourish in prosperity.  

Great is their compassion, great their vow,  
Great sages, great mercy.  

The Sun Emperor and Moon Stars of the Supreme Clarity,  
The Five Virtues and the Four Luminary Star Sovereign Lords.
