### On the Mind

The mind is the root of myriad dharmas, the master of the nine orifices, the source of birth and death, the fountainhead of good and evil. It is born alongside Heaven and Earth, reigning as the sovereign of numinous clarity. Sometimes it is called the True Lord, for its command and leadership are unified as one. Sometimes it is called the Ever-True, for it transcends antiquity and the present without decay. Sometimes it is called the Truly Such, for it is silent and unmoving. When employed, it fills the six voids; when abandoned, none know its whereabouts. Its vastness has no outside, for the universe lies within it, sharing essence with the Great Void. Its minuteness has no inside, entering the tip of a single hair’s end, beyond all likeness or form. This is what we call our original mind, the self that existed before empty kalpas. But what indeed is it? Dim and obscure, faint and elusive, it cannot be grasped by intellect nor recognized by cognition. Forcibly named the Dao, forcibly called spirit, forcibly named the mind—thus and no more. From this perspective, is it not vast? Is it not precious? Yet it cycles endlessly through the Three Realms, entering and exiting birth and death, unable to free itself. Why so? Because a single thought stirs within, while the six senses whirl without, surpassing neither good nor evil but transcending evil, hence the retribution of Heaven and Hell, cause and effect, the endless revolving of the Six Paths with no escape. Is this not painful? Is it not sorrowful? But for the enlightened, it is otherwise. Therefore, one fasts and purifies to illuminate virtue with numinous clarity; the One True becomes clear and deep, and myriad calamities vanish. Laozi says: “Reach the utmost emptiness, keep steadfast stillness; myriad things arise together, I watch their return.” All things flourish, each returning to its root; returning to the root is stillness; stillness is renewal of life; renewal is constancy; knowing constancy is brightness. Ignorance of constancy breeds reckless action and misfortune. What is called constancy is that which transcends antiquity and the present without decay. What is called delusion is the moment a thought arises. Zhuangzi says: “Once something is made, to return to the root—is it not difficult?” In the Book of Changes, this is the great person. From now on, guard your speech, moderate your food and drink, remove defilements and halt wandering thoughts, quiet the mind and hold to the One, embrace emptiness and serenity, solitude and non-action, gather your gaze and return your hearing, harmonize your light with the dust of the world. When a sickness arises, do not prolong it as medicine. Fear not the arising of thoughts, only fear awakening too late. Like a hair, daily consider its care. With body and mind, why not so? In walking, standing, sitting, and lying, do not let a moment stray. To the land of no-thingness, the realm of Huaxu, I shall wander.

### Words on Opening the Altar

Have you not seen a ladder a thousand feet tall leaning against a steep mountain? Climb it and you reach the peak. Yet on flat land, a mere few feet high wall cannot be crossed. The ladder is not too short; the place it stands is wrong. A ship carrying myriad bushels rests safely on a great river; it can cross seas and rivers. But cast into a shallow stream, it cannot pass a few steps. The ship is not incapable; the place it rests is wrong. Our family’s talismanic registers can move Heaven and Earth above, shake mountains and rivers below, command dragons and tigers in the light, capture ghosts and spirits in the dark, raise decayed bones to life, transcend birth and death through cultivation, govern great nations, repel disasters small and large. Yet to obtain this is through cultivation; to lose it is through falling away. Thus, a craftsman with ruler and compass cannot guarantee perfection; a master with models cannot ensure flawless practice. But human affections, demonic obstructions, fame and profit barriers, sins and offenses increase day by day, never ceasing. Born without parents, who outside the body is kin? Passing days only for clothes and food—what use is accumulation? Glory, wealth, and honor, like a candle flickering in the wind; love for wife and children, like birds nesting on the same branch. Grand carriages and fine horses cannot accompany a long night’s journey. Beautiful concubines and charming wives cannot relieve the sufferings of the Nine Hells. Carved walls and lofty mansions, white jade and gold, belong to others for a moment, but cannot be kept long. The vast Three Realms, the busy four lives, all chase the fleeting waves, sinking forever in the sea of suffering. Do not wait until the envoy of Fengdu arrives, the black register calling your name. To regret then is too late. You have left your parents’ land to come to the door of the master and craftsman, climbing and stepping, braving frost and rain, pouring out your heart and cleansing your soul, to behold the True Wind of the Most High, entrusting your name with faith, bowing to receive the secret records of the Celestial Master. From now on, discard the old and renew daily. Though your name may be known in the high firmament, your body remains bound by the world’s net. Former affections severed, gradually cease; future enmities upon meeting, do not bind. Only thus can you resolve disputes, blunt sharpness, aid beings and save people, nourish nature and find peace, preserve spirit and quiet thought. When the green vine is cut, the fire must cease in the heart-monkey; when delusions do not arise, the mind-horse naturally halts. Know the body as affliction, see life as true; yang does not warm birth, yin does not darken death. From this, great winds do not move, kalpa fires cannot burn; when thoughts cease in the three corpses, nature is not attached to the five desires. The Jade Terrace and the Lang Garden are your true homeland; the sea of love and mountain of favor are the livelihood of others. Life is uncertain, white hair hard to expect; the sun and moon swiftly pass—delay no more, lest you waste away in vain. This life, fortunate to reach the treasure mountain, do not return empty-handed. Humbly pray the imperial foundation endure forever, the sage’s lifespan extend, the four barbarians at peace, kings from myriad nations come. Only by selfless transformation can the Ten Directions, the Three Realms, the Six Paths, the four lives, all sentient beings, together reach the shore of the Dao. Now the Mysterious Altar is established, the opening and crossing soon to come; dare not linger long among the learners. Humbly beseech you to cherish this.

### Letter Reply to the Prefect of Chizhou

Ma Xiugen came, specially bearing a letter, reporting the move to Chengdu. Though the journey was a little arduous, the path was peaceful. The talismanic registers and oaths must be personally attended to, to complete the ceremony. By the wind, I briefly send my sincere hand; Xiugen departs with this letter. On the thirteenth day of the sixth month, your humble servant looks to the Prefect.

### Letter Reply to the Prefect of Zhendong

Long time no correspondence; suddenly received your precious letter. Glad to hear of your health and ease. I admire the Prefect and his deputy, who have bound their hair in the Dao, striving to uphold Confucianism, vast waves of learning, outstanding figures in the literary forest. I await the great use to fulfill the hearts of the people, and then will join and accept, only seeking to rejoice in selection. Your humble servant, Prefect of Zhendong.

### Letter Reply to Tang Mingquan

Your humble servant: Long have I worn the name of virtue, yet have been barred from the profound discourse. I look up to the Dipper, often laboring in dreams, braving wind and distance from the marriage clouds. The cloud meeting is not yet at leisure; the precious letter I receive is a great honor, bearing utmost sincerity. Yet how can a rustic one like me bear it? Only you, Mingquan, the high immortal of the Jade Palace, guest of the Jade Terrace, who cast aside the reins of profit and fame, striving for the pivot of Dao and virtue. Without form, you preserve spirit; you seek the mysterious pearl in the Red River. Calm and harmonious, nurturing nature, uniting supreme principle with Huaxu. You should further rescue the distressed and guide the ignorant, fully manifest the virtue of the True Man, unfold the wind of the Most High. Perhaps then the feathered canopy and dragon scales will together seek the realm of Huayang; the buds will buy banners and rainbows, companions in the journey of the Great Ultimate Heaven.

### Letter Reply to Prefect Lin

The methods you taught, combined with the sacred master’s formulas, rely on diligent practice. Though not lightly raised in broad daylight, the body and color remain intact, extending life in the world, achieving long life and immortality. With reverence and blessing. Your humble servant, Daoist friend Lin.

### Letter Reply to Lin Lingsu

The gourd hat and bamboo staff are without affection; what use the clouds and smoke? The Golden Gate and red mist are but a play in the heavens. White stones and clear springs preserve the mountain’s ease. Duckweed stems occasionally meet in gathering; clouds and mud each reach their carefree freedom. Separated by rivers and mountains, seasons shift cold and warm. Idle fame rises daily; wandering waves at times diverge. Xujing holds that the Dao is fundamentally natural; spirit is not something apart. The bright moon flows around the blue Milky Way, its light formless; white clouds come and go over green mountains, their colors leaving no trace. Early the cocoon enters and the moth departs; the sparrow seeks water and the clam is born. Transformations happen in a moment, cycles influence each other, trends do not rely on imitation, rise and fall find their own measure. All phenomena have death and birth; spring flowers fall in autumn. One qi mutually consumes and rests; night dew dries with morning sun. Wandering the Five Lakes in a small boat, soaring over the Three Islands on a black crane. Ascending high requires distance; descending low is no difficulty. Not missing the first opportunity is the way of the adept. From Mei Station I journey again with Huajian; fortunate to find harmony with the void and accord with the broken record.

### Transmission from the Celestial Master to Younger Brother Qing

After three heavens, the father departs and the son comes. Now the master of the records resigns, and the younger brother receives. As a humble servant bearing the robe and hat, I pray to the Great Ultimate to witness and know, to store blessings in my humble body, truly difficult to forget the great gift. Your servant is unworthy.

### Thanks for Official Appointment

The times do not match the person; regrettably, Heaven’s favor is bestowed. Grace touches kinship; joy fills the private gates. I am ashamed of the honor and surprise that increase, yet joyfully beat my sincere fear and awe. Humbly consider that when I was but a child, I received pure light, seven times changing years, three times decrees issued, building a leaking cloud-browed hall for convenient burning and cultivation; granted the scripture of the imperial rites of Xuanhe, to enable success in practice. Soon the leaking spring’s grace and my fellow clansmen’s brothers encountered hardships, reporting their whereabouts. This is a humble encounter of special reverence, teaching and model without question, blindly trusting the weight of heavenly kinship, extending to my children. Though green old customs, truly shocking in these times. The heart of dog and horse must be fully exhausted; the house of phoenix and luan has no limit to its glory. With sincere incense and fire, I pray for longevity on the hills; I look to Heaven and the sage, deeply moved to clear the camp. Humbly spoken.

### Five-Character Ancient Poems

#### An Occasional Poem on Soaring Seagulls and Roc by Shi Yuan Gui

Soaring several fathoms high, how different from ninety thousand li? The Great Dao drifts nameless, neither here nor there. Alas, Yuan Gui, your words have reached their end. One thing arises from the Great Ultimate; the aspiring gentleman sets high standards. The roc and cicada, debating, are not the supreme principle. Forms and appearances transform, never leaving the six directions’ embrace. Flying leaps cross the journey’s path; why mock the distant and near? Thus one knows the carefree roaming, the distant marsh reveals mysterious intent. After the lecture, four windows inquire; words forgotten, emptiness hides the table.

#### Visit of the Imperial Historian

The envoy Xu Zhong brought a search for the recluse Li at the headquarters, and upon visiting Shangqing, we brewed tea and exchanged words until midnight. Bright and pleasing to the ear, truly there are marvelous and lofty transformations, the mountain and river’s beauty enhanced. The next day we parted. It was the fifth year of Xuanhe, roughly as recorded here. The west wind first drifts, white dew still clinking. A man floats on the great river, eastward touring to Raoyang. Truly receiving the ninefold letter, he visits the alchemical chamber. Mountain air bright with dragons and tigers, green forest and clouds long above. Meeting me by chance, we discussed clear frost and ice. Night deepened, holding candles, sitting beside a new moon frozen. Jade toad veils the marriage scene, golden breeze fans heavenly fragrance. Shadows fall like village clouds, splendidly presenting auspicious signs. The six directions show no differing colors; five peaks share autumn light. Brocade robes exiled to the dusty world, riding whales across river bridges. You pledge to fulfill the mysterious pact, soaring faintly in the void.

#### Tang Mingquan Takes Family into the Dao

Good son, long have you been empty and淡 (淡: simple, plain), gifted yet unwilling to serve. Among chickens and dogs beneath white clouds, you take your family to roam here. What you harbor is already transcendent, profound principles can be seated and attained. Alas, Mingzhu’s fate does not seize my will. One change of rivers and seas, all free of dust and dirt. Hearing of the Jingyang magistrate, uprooting the household to leave the mundane world. This matter lies in fine cultivation; strive hard, son of the Tang family.

#### Poem on the Dragon Transformation Pavilion’s Completion by Bai Qingcheng, Daoist of the Pavilion

A chamber free of dust and dirt, gentle wind shakes jade bamboo. The table full only of qin and books, serene and distinct from worldly customs. Often wielding a brush, inscribing seals and recording in bundles. Sometimes playing games with the mystics, pulling chess pieces in two or three matches. Night facing the moon through the forest, playing divine melodies on the knees. Further inspiration not yet spent, slowly unrolling the scroll. Welcome, Lord of Qingcheng, clouds part revealing distant green mountains.

#### Reply to Yuan Gui’s Rebuff

Just arrived at the towering cliff, again climbing the emerald peaks. Tuning the qing and singing white snow, qin quiet, playing the yellow bell. Treading the ancient path of the sages, pursuing the traces of immortals. Since coming, much blessing and power, trusting each is lax and idle. Where is there not joy? This heart knows its source. Like a single moon hanging on a ten-thousand-year pine.

#### Thinking of the Old Man of Qingcheng

Since parting from the Old Man of Qingcheng, many moons have passed. Spring’s heat wanes, mountain flowers quickly fall. Often I long and admire, gazing westward toward the jade pavilion. Could it be the longing for the human world, where music and song are in full revel? Returning to the hermit’s companions, fulfilling my green rock promise. The returning light flashes residual glow, lotus flowers emerge with golden edges.

#### Reply to Yuan Gui’s Encouragement

Your words fully cite the ancients’ deeds. Clearly the Dao is here; not practicing yet goodness arrives. You now truly arrive, playing music seeking true knowledge. One word reveals my son, hard to exhaust in speech. Knowing you penetrate Laozi and Zhuangzi, surpassing daylight treading the great wilderness. Intense talk of mystery within mystery, vast and boundless without side. Those who learn must have waiting; not confronting demons. Traversing scenes as if knowing, never surprised by trickery. Doubts and debates dissolved, thus trusted as good men. Hold goodness as teacher; Heaven’s truth can be attained sitting. The human world still discusses distinctions; immortal affairs should follow fate. Having destiny, one finally leaves the mortal realm; why not die and wait for completion? The Great Dao is not empty illusion, clearly above all things. When I hear this, joy fills spirit and clarity. No more debate on shallow or deep; these words exhaust sincere heart. The time is now, though ragged; these words I admire. Nearby listeners sneer, but I do not blame their kindness. Fortunately, different from common customs, pondering things within.

#### Reply to Magistrate Zhang on Reducing Food Expenses

Food need not be abundant; the ancients valued filling the belly. One full, what more to seek? Eight delicacies are not desired. Rhinoceros sinews not yet carried down, only cutting off lifetime salary. Nature grants human measure, more or less with number. Also consider captives on the road, all due to insufficient food. Old Zhuang valued pigeon food; this poem I read at the time.

#### Further Reduction of Clothing

Clothes should be comfortable and suitable; winter furs and summer hemp. For cultivators, initially not concerned with finery. Light gauze and fine silk, new styles and different prices. Each bolt costs thousands of coins, clumsy work and chaotic cutting. Small pieces ill-fitting, the heart already displeased. Have you seen the poor who wear torn skins all year round?

### Song and Ballad

#### Song of the Great Dao

The Dao is not far, it is within the body. All things are empty in nature, yet not empty. If nature is not empty, harmonious qi dwells; qi returns to the primal sea, life is endless. To keep the spirit within the body from going out, do not leave a single thing on the spirit platform. If things are in the body, the spirit is not clear; dissipating wastes spirit and damages sinews and bones. Spirit governs qi, qi stays in form; no need for mixed arts to live long. Arts are easy to know but hard to understand; once understood, not fully practiced. Thus thousands and tens of thousands study, yet none reach even one or two achievements. If the spirit goes out, bring it back; when spirit returns to the body, qi naturally flows. So morning and evening, naturally the infant is born of true womb.

#### Song of the Void

The void drifts vast with no shore; sun and moon greet each other east and west. East greets west, west sends off east—how long will this last? In the field of birth and death, like lightning flashing. The original true nature is like the void, bright and shining without gloom. Occasionally a thought falls into form, causing birth and death to confuse east and west. Alas, the world is wholly unaware; death brings sorrow, life brings joy. They do not know life is the root of death, only rejoice in the east’s rising, fear the west’s setting. East rises and west sets by principle; do not let feelings and knowledge entangle. If you do not believe, just watch sun and moon, morning and evening, always revolve in the great cycle. Birth is not coming, death is not going; no cause and effect following place. The Six Paths revolve in busy waves; the True Man dwells in the void. The True Man’s abode has no house, neighbors the wind and moon in pure emptiness. Do not say the numinous light is mere particles; it embraces the dharma realm without remainder. The dharma realm embraces the great without outside, penetrates the tiniest dust without inside. Hunger, cold, and calamity cannot add; all things, heads and tails, return to the sovereign. A heap of dust, a hundred years of form, like a boat floating on water, relying on humans to row. Suddenly the boat breaks and people land; dead wood ownerless sinks and falls. Do not rot or look back at myriad waters; how many rivers have you crossed this time? When reaching shore, better burn the boat, no need to speak of waves’ bitterness or green. The boat dwells yet does not dwell, never worried. Last night wind and thunder shook mountains. The void does not move, always as it is; knowing true emptiness, one is not confused. Ancient and modern, the town remains; overturning the world reveals the whole body. Deliver all beings beyond the sea of suffering; true emptiness news is not foolish emptiness. Endless transformations without end, listen to my song of emptiness wrapping the tune, iron snake flies up Kunlun peak.

#### Song of Rest and Ceasing

Rest, rest, rest; cease, cease, cease; rest and cease without distinction. A thousand essentials, subtle mysteries, all teach people to rest and cease. If you can rest, then also cease; all emotional entanglements severed. Hunger, anger, thirst, drink, sleep when tired; ten thousand deaths and a thousand lives no interference. Ancient sages and wise ones, one nature continuous through vast kalpas. Brightness shines illuminating true emptiness; beyond rest and cease there is nothing else. Hell seeds create grudges; six senses blaze like fire. Standing self and competing with others, unaware of rest and cease; gladly suffering body broken and tongue pulled. Rest and cease, true formula; no foolishness, no wisdom, no skill or clumsiness. From the supreme master only blame cultivation; if not meeting a knowing heart, who would reveal? Rest is not rest, cease is not cease; great use appears without hesitation. Advocating primordial transformation, cutting off form’s trace, encompassing void surpassing arising and ceasing. Neither rest nor cease; cease and rest all forced speech. To know true cease and true rest, just send bright mid-autumn moon.

#### Composed at Qiantang

Red clouds reflect vermilion railings, white clouds hide green mountains. People in dust do not reach here; twin cranes dance at Chai Pass. One tune on the jade zither, several poems; mountain boys brew tea with no marriage. Thinking of leaving worldly pleasures, how many years since parting the grotto heavens? On the Xiang River, moon just white; on the Xiang shore, wind clear. Heartbreaking sound chokes the jade flute’s fragments, sorrow kills how many feelings on frosted embankment. Life is but floating clouds. Immortals still enjoy spring; return, come, and delight in my truth.

#### Reply to Yuan Gui’s Song of Following Others

Let them be, let them all be; do not mind them, they are who they are, what can I do? Idle all day with friends beyond the world, singing and writing like a hanging river. No heart to bind worldly burdens; in the box a sword to subdue demons. Long life already understood, the mystery gate’s meaning; let the black rabbit run like a shuttle. Dust and toil are truly hateful; who would drift following delay? In quiet places often think of noisy affairs; in the end, empty competition and sighing. Let them be, let them all be; do not mind, just nurture primordial qi and harmonize the vital force. Sometimes freely read alchemical books; idly seek jade zither songs. My heart is not stone, cannot be moved; let vulgar talk breed discord. Pine hairpin and cloth robe, content with self; why crave splendid robes and silk? Spirit furnace mating to refine golden liquid, mingling pure and deep day by day. When merit and practice complete, together we depart; floating, flying canopy brushes the Milky Way. Let them be, let them all be; do not mind.

#### Song of the Alchemical Vessel

Do not say the Great Dao is non-action; you must understand the vessel and flute in the chamber. Passing time without moving a moment, purple mist and red light blaze. Blue dragon rejoices, white tiger hates; red snake coils the turtle shell. Even passing the Tail Gate, still blocked by Cao Creek road. Two lines straight up to the cinnabar field; assuredly above is the Three Pure Ones’ pavilion. Beneath the pavilion clearly lies the jade pool, containing the elixir of immortality. Timely take and prepare; after taking, receive joy in Penglai.

#### Song of Jing Tong Hermitage

I built a grass hermitage in the mountain; others laugh at my name Jing Tong. All come to the field in the mind’s square inch, embracing the world as the void. My hermitage is neither “Tong” nor “Jing,” exquisite on eight sides with no shape or shadow. Full and empty messages obey Heaven’s secret; the hermitage’s master does not even know. Sometimes wind and snow in three winter months; all day no human smoke before the mountain. Stubborn void ink black, day like night; light shines long and round in the hermitage. Sometimes wind and thunder rise from the plain; mountains sink, rivers surge, clouds flow. Dragon’s roar, tiger’s cry, myriad forms noisy; in the hermitage, emotions arise without end. Pines and bamboos surround the hermitage, reaching to the blue sky; winter does not wither, spring does not flourish. People come and mock the hermitage’s hardship; poverty to the bone, purity to the bone. Pure poverty is very good for nature; recalling red gates full of starving corpses. Can you recognize your own pearl? How could you envy others’ treasures? The hermitage is like the body, the master like the mind; to know the master you must seek. Donkey fetus, horse belly, river sand dreams—how know iron ore hides refined gold? Lift your eyes and act swiftly; now seek the nonexistent within the existent. Words exhaust principle, cut off delusion and emptiness; no hairy lion roaring at the sky. The great houses in front of the hermitage are all humble huts; how many kindred spirits dwell with me? If not for breaking the county cliff’s hand, who would understand and recognize me? Sometimes there is joy unknown to others; in quiet practice leisure is found. Natural marvelous use, natural truth; all immortal spirits come from this. Floating life is short and fleeting; when all hermitages break, one must rest. I earnestly advise all disciples: do not lose this hermitage, cultivate early.

#### Song of the Wild Pavilion

Whales and fish in the four seas are not worth fishing; even if hooked, I do not want. Immortals of the Three Islands are not worth boasting; long life and immortality are countless. Astonishing fame is not to be trusted; heroes of ten thousand ages are but a play. Slight riches and honor are not to be admired; better the wild pavilion’s idle clouds. The kalpa fire and dust are utterly gone; now asleep, none hear. Wild Pavilion, Wild Pavilion, where is it? The universe vast with no entrance. Ten thousand immortal maidens dive in waves; millions of fighting rocs traverse the earth’s depths. This pavilion is truly strange; gods do not know, ghosts cannot fathom. East to west, south to north; the center is one orifice, the dust and sand kingdom. The dust and sand kingdom has tiny dust; each tiny dust is a true man. Each true man is a true source; their ranks and formations are likewise. If people see the Wild Pavilion elder, all flee at a glance. Ha ha ha, the Wild Pavilion song through all ages.

#### Letter to Prefect Lin

Who does not love the gate of long life? Only one must exert effort. On the Nine Palaces Terrace, yellow buds grow; beside the white jade pool, the curled peaches wait. Stirring the heavenly gate, ghosts and spirits submit; turning the earth’s axis, yin demons are defeated. The river cart moves up to the nine heavens; sun and moon forge a golden world.

#### Thinking of the Mountain of Ghost Valley, Ode to the True Grotto, Presented to Yuan Gui

The True Grotto is deep with clouds and waters; Daoists dwell and ghosts and spirits revere. Mountain flowers smile beneath pine and bamboo shade; rock streams murmur the ancient sound. When shall one fashion a pure spirit’s collar? Climbing vines and moss, laughing and chanting together.

## Volume Four of the Collected Sayings of the Thirtieth Celestial Master, Lord Xujing

### Five-Character Regulated Poems

#### Ode to Returning to the Mountain after Invitation, Yuan Gui

Joy to see Shihun’s retreat, speechless, mind uniquely true. Returning to the stone bridge’s promise, washing away the capital’s dust. Fragrant incense and cinnabar furnace quiet; poems and colorful brushes new. The high clouds are not lonely; hand in hand, spring at the cave’s gate.

#### Harmony with Hunlun Hermitage, Chaoran, On the Moment

Freely enjoying carefree delight, always happy in quiet dwelling. By the water, red shadows small; outside marriage, sparse green bamboo. Something truly constant responds; forgetting form, inside originally empty. Human world’s toil and worry, here all vanish and end.

#### To Yuan Gui and Tai Ding Two Lords

By the water, string songs; under eaves, holding scrolls. Each heart has its own delight; heavenly music truly pure. Fear the sun’s first crossing of summer; idle flowers are still spring. Not following cold and heat’s change; only the kalpa’s first body.

#### Autumn Evening

On the evening of the start of autumn, drinking and composing poems, roughly passing the clear scene, inviting fine verses. Flashing autumn light is good; rows of myriad treasures formed. Pine high, solitary crane cries; bamboo dense, one cicada sings. Greatly drunk, clothes wet; empty songs, wind’s demeanor clear. Waist qin should be played again; Chu marsh still holds lingering feelings.

#### Sending Yuan Gui to Visit Magu

Flicking sleeves at Magu’s source scene, drifting and free, spirit clear. Not refusing a thousand li afar; alone stepping the light five clouds. Already have qin and books’ joy; should not be entangled by worldly dust. I am ashamed to block pursuit; turning back, emotions run wild.

#### Harmony with Yuan Gui on the Fluffy Cloud Pavilion

Sparse green embraces the high pavilion; gentle breeze seems to push out clouds. Two pillars share cool shade; west lies the Dragon Transformation Pavilion, hence a good wind divides. The frontier laments qin and books’ seats; hard to hold the sparrows’ flock. The host cherishes uprightness; who dares skillfully wield the axe?

#### Reply to Harmony with Yuan Gui

Yuan Gui Daoist read my “On the Mind,” composed a poem and sent it; I follow the rhyme to reply. New writings broad but not verbose; reading clears the soul. Intent beyond the mundane; heart the source of myriad dharmas. Like a dragon, who can measure? Herding horses with subtle words. Three returns hard to exhaust; again obtain fine discussion.

#### Listening to Yuan Gui’s Qin

All things in confusion, Hunlun’s sound does not flow. Ancients took from strings; now I seek in thought. Water strikes cliff stones; wind high on island autumn. Gazing together, true joy; Heaven and Earth share leisure.

#### Joy of Clear Weather

Peonies all fallen; mountain springs begin to sound. Fully knowing spring leaves late; deeply rejoicing in night’s clear. Tall willows brush eaves now; idle flowers shine on the valley bright. Pine asks to bring fine wine; today thoughts are clear.

#### To Deng Cheng’s Two Sons

Deng Cheng’s two sons transmitted the method to me; after the pure altar’s affairs, I compose poems to give them. Not closing the Three Heavens’ Dao, hard to turn back two sons’ sincerity. Revealing the chapter invites response; tearing silk rejoices as pact. Divine sword tested one day; dharma lamp shines through ages. Inner observation must self-enlighten; ultimate principle is originally without feeling.

#### Sending Master Zhengzhi

Dao’s appearance ancient and lofty; fame fragrant for ten thousand li. Purple mist robe ethereal; cinnabar pendants jade brilliant. Solitary dwelling in rock hall; diligently chanting grotto chapters. Awaiting full merit and practice; flying canopy ascends to clear sun.

#### Exposing Scriptures

Late sun fills the high terrace; book bag of cloud brocade opens. Plum steam penetrates yang qi; forest hides scene and light returns. Grotto investigates myriad spirits faintly; high brightness destroys myriad evils. Diligently able to open secrets; must rely on outstanding talents.

#### Evening Walk in the Mountains

Crows frequently come to speak; seeking nest, none to ask. Small stars bright and near; tall osmanthus first to climb. Brushing dew, pines all remain; by wind, news not yet returned. Is there no place to rest? Green reaches Xie family mountain.

#### Harmony with Yuan Gui Sending to Yangzi’s Residence at Zhenyan

Should reach the highest place; longing for the ancients. Wind brings many cypress seeds; buds compete to dispel dust. Heat does not reach here; heavenly flowers freely spring. Immortal traces wish to leave no mark; worldly dust hard to find crossing.

#### Following the Rhyme to Encourage Yuan Gui

Leisurely and carefree, recognize the original person. Pain and suffering are illusions; in the dim, there is truth. Boiling troubles only self-burden; calm and broad is eternal spring. Do you know my thoughts? My body is not your body.

#### Inscription on the Hall of Crossing Instruments

Four poems:  
Often admiring mid-autumn moon, mountain hall also melancholy. Temporarily dwelling for a hundred days, always feeling near the Three Terraces. Loud trees sound at night; cultivated bamboo shadows quiet steps. If not able to self-measure, how to see return?  
Near the door all treetops; not formed from grains. Walking the mountain not everywhere; after rain, especially clear. Peaches planted at the sky’s edge; clouds born from ridge above. Chickens and dogs do not reach; sometimes hear phoenix and luan’s flute.  
Suddenly ascending the hall; like white sun immortal. Lofty near saintly image; surpassing, ashamed of my years. Slight moon with cold dew; tall pines ask wild fields. Palace built only a few years; still makes knocking on bell money.  
Facing the west window; two peaks green and arranged. White clouds enter clear paintings; mysterious cranes when will return? Silent as hair bamboo; hoe weeds around moss on steps. Sometimes not opening door; marriage rain covers sun terrace.

### Couplet

Xuanran Yuan Gui sits at night, drinks leftover wine from Confucian friend. Thus composed.  
Drinking famous wine together, three cups not refused. Holding heart, discussing Dao’s marvel; raising brush, composing new poems. Though ill, still leading; for joy truly vast. Sparse stars connect distant Milky Way; green water shines before pond stones. Not yet reaching Pei’s couplet; ashamed to teach joy known. Suddenly clear and wise; Tai Ding silent like foolish stone. Beautiful new lotus near; dustless bright moon follows. Mountain wind comes softly; silver candle flickers. Blue eyes ready to view; red curtain do not lower. Sleep demons all dispersed; chanting thoughts clearer and stranger. All forms entrusted to a smile; thousand springs all a moment. This feeling can be shared; achieving will, let others mock. Dao heavy, all in accord; mind’s mechanism alone ashamed to be. Gautama made a good friend; old sages are true teachers. Four seas no other matters; gentlemen enough to enjoy. Immortal rock carries fishing boat; cloud brocade plants cinnabar fungus. Worldly dust is meaningless; we still have proper use. Red dust should leave traces; purple palace not late to go. Always cherish Guan Zi; friend holding ashamed Bo Ci. When merit achieved, ride together; six directions freely frolic.

### Another

Wine tires of Gaoyang’s price; people cherish ancient feelings. Holding cup, just to enjoy; facing scene, new sound arises. Twelve parts clear qi; three thousand beyond world’s glory. Heavenly truth lightly suits; worldly rites do not entangle. Cicada’s tune faintly near; pine sounds softly born. Forest wind invades seat; mountain moon shines bright. Quiet sounds spirit especially fresh; midnight qi still crosses. Star patterns jade candles shine; tiger strength purple brush light. Achieving will not for rank; roaming spirit must reach sea and ocean. Mid-autumn slightly drunk here; meaning laughs at empty fame.

### Seven-Character Re-chant

Drunkenly fallen, still praise cloud liquid’s beauty; chanting and watching, feel feathers light. Pine pavilion melancholy gaze, bamboo railing lingering mood clearer. Water and grass far hold green hues; wild flowers still bloom subtle blossoms. Wind comes, painted couch dispels heat; rain passes, autumn cicadas send evening sounds. Immortal realm often viewed, heavenly road near; elegant poetry forbids worldly entanglement. Though you ride clouds to ask cranes, I still ride whales on the sea. White Emperor’s spirit just; group moves solemnly; Daoist heart upright; hundred demons startled. Together enjoy simple dwelling in woods; laugh at chasing to the city. By the creek, three laughs together; in drinking, compete with eight immortals. Do not say wine capacity all lose to me; perhaps poem fame counts me among.

### Traveling Together to Qizhen

Inspired to visit Qizhen; feelings stirred by ancients. Ancients’ Dao not lonely; today hearts together. Quiet has joy beyond things; clear has no worldly questions or dreams. Ultimate discourse transcends form and spirit; talk and song penetrate caves and grottoes. Wild colors mixed with tea cups; pine sounds enter qin playing. Not yet able to compose return; again lift flowing clouds jar.

### Timely Joy at Raindrop

How to comfort the people? Mountains and rivers greet clouds at dawn. Sincerity moves Heaven and Earth; alchemical earnestness in words. Southern fields’ seedlings first wither; western suburbs’ rain already falls. Forest hills grow lush; grass and trees rejoice together. Do not blame mushroom fields’ growth; like feather robes’ diligence. Heaven’s vault is not partial; worldly dust enough to stir evil. Road dust and dust cease; pavilion windows divide summer heat. Good year comforts old farmers; great virtue thanks my lord. Branches moisten, startling forest crows; kitchen clean, no Chu mosquitoes. How to repay the Most High? Only by burning precious incense.

Hunlun Hermitage completed; disciple Xiu Ran rejoices. Thus with what rhyme compose couplets?  
Build a chamber to observe spirit realms; when merit complete, what then? Qin and books consume days and months; traps and fishing old vines. Envy cloud traces afar; sometimes drink wine together. Bound rocks open jade grotto; western stream pours Milky Way. Adjust pendants thinking of heavenly pillars; observe dusk, awaken to brilliant wood. True feelings sincere and thin; worldly affairs truly wasted. Cut off traces seeking no burdens; clear heart reaches no waves. Hunlun sweetly feasts and rests; true nature thanks to dispel errors. Dust and filth separate thousand peaks; elegance and myriad airs harmonize. Heaven and earth comparable to longevity; black rabbit like shuttle. Immortal arrival not without prophecy; cranes come bearing other signs. Early January, dozens of white cranes fly here; circling for a time then leave. Brewing tea, hosting guests’ talk; planting medicine, healing people. Bamboo dew extends cool shade; orchid wind moves marvelous songs. Leisurely seeking immortal transmissions; quietly holding jade scriptures. Great Dao still in sleeves; worldly dust self-entangled. Life is like a spark; changing world like moths to a lamp. Want to enter high immortal tune; do not let lower ghosts be harsh. Thatched eaves have no matters; sometimes move to chant.

### After Drinking, Couplet to West River Moon

Tonight moonlight like day; the enclosed pond does not yield to West River. Moon bright, people quiet, courtyard full of fragrance. Drunken mood and poetic feelings greedy for length. Not yet willing to return to thatched hall; moisten brush, seize drunken madness. Before the lamp, loudly chant facing quiet window; laugh at youth flowing on rocks.

## Volume Five of the Collected Sayings of the Thirtieth Celestial Master, Lord Xujing

### Seven-Character Regulated Poems

#### Following the Imperial Edict, Presented to the True Man

Jade seal and golden chapter praise the grotto truth; who can compare to the high marvel within truth? Worldly dust brushed away, spirit always still; refined food ceases, meals already dust.  
Yet praise the sage’s constant transformation; should not idle and wander all life. Following orders, fortunate to meet; able to go to the jade palace and see one person.

#### Night Sitting in the Capital, Thinking of Hunlun Hermitage, Sent to Him

Sitting alone in the empty hut, quietness can be known; river city’s meaning, how like this? Look at the phoenix fruit just formed; self-named moonlight about to be wondrous.  
Drunken mood wishes to enjoy with cloud elder; dust and wind do not take; celebrate ancestral poems. Mountain woods and valleys, empty bright realm; cannot return to chant, have thoughts.

#### Following the Rhyme, Reply to Minister Zhao

Hot and steamy season, leaving home mountain; frost and snow now gradually cold. Regret my empty name wandering the world; recall your lofty words, leaning on the railing.  
Because tired of guests outside the court; often playing qin all night. Already obtained spring’s return order; anticipate spiritual crane arranging feathers.

#### Sending to the True Man

Admiring clear sound truly accumulated; previous dynasty fortunate to attend red court. Slightly glimpsing style, often meeting; again regret frost sky suddenly farewell.  
Virtue among low and middle laughs; high talent must trust rarity of old. Ashamed of merit lacking Yang and Xu; how to get southern true to test Taiwei?

#### New Lotus

Withered lotus all gone, small buds round; bright eyes hold fragrance, still worthy of pity. Moon Emperor comes seeking green jade box; golden boy stands recognizing green copper coin.  
Already condensed heavy dew nourishing clear qi; how lucky light wind sweeps faint marriage. Far away Hua Peak fully beautiful; flowers bloom like holding bright red.

#### Qiantang

Thousands of households water surrounds city; white clouds open place show cinnabar and blue. Earth connects golden three thousand realms; mountain jade peaks six-foot screen.  
At dawn leaning on railing, wearing dew; at night closing curtain, toad reveals cold stars. Making river scenes unsurpassed; half like Penglai, half like Dongting.  
Hengfu with new tea battles victory, thus composed song.  
People say blue-white better than yellow-white; you have new buds surpass old buds. Dragon tongue quickly harvests golden cauldron fire; feather robes compete to recognize snow cup flowers.  
Penglai high carriage should depart; dividing martial subtle fragrance not to boast. More praise the lord capable; Lord Cai must enter Lu Sheng’s house.

#### Inscription on Imperial Immortal Treasure Accumulation Temple

Immortals come and go building huts; I come happily to stay in cloud chariot. Autumn sun today, seventh month ninth day; flower pistils long spring for a thousand years.  
A solitary pine before flowing water; several lines of refined, delicate writings. Pouring wine at dusk, decorating lotus fruit; casually discussing existence and nonexistence, the Great Beginning.

#### Capital’s Seventh Night Festival

Seventh night’s scenery not easily wanes; once a year skillfully connected. Not startled by shooting stars passing high; all look up this night.  
Flowers and moon have feeling, heavenly palace tinkling; Yan Mountain shares wine cup’s chill. From now on solemn autumn shade; fear robes not yet single.

#### Returning from Capital, Seeking Old Year’s Quiet Charm at Dragon Transformation Pavilion, Roughly Writing with Humble Heart

Found old year’s fragrant green cluster; together truly appreciate leaning on railing. Almost following white sun flying immortal change; half for today’s treasure black sky.  
Light clear not withered, spring things smile; sparse shadows come chasing moonlight. Jiangnan autumn scene still abundant; thanks to this one robe of wind and moon cold.

#### Returning to the Mountain

Long years in the capital, greatly confined; returning to hills and valleys, finally free. Flowing water has sound like conversation; idle clouds near and far can roam together.  
Monkeys lean on pine shadows watching red turtles; cranes with reed flowers enter fishing boat. Such delay is good, not bad; worldly dust what to shame?

#### Reply to Prefect Yu’s Poem on Visiting Immortal Rock

Years in forest, thoughts long; rock valley wind and frost also tasted. Worldly guests never made friends; the adept likely does not think madness.  
Jiang Pavilion once built in Huaining Sea; stone house now dwelling like stream village. Who would think new Prefect of Shangrao; yet because of court visit comes to Shanyang.

#### Stealing Moon at Quiet Hall

Dense forest and lofty peaks linger; ten years official not top rank. Red Emperor rides dragon, last hiding; Chang’e divides moon entering deep mountain.  
Passes and caves open after war; food and rest to be asked in the state. Now willow embankment true official hidden; clear stream and splendid thin land wide and idle.

#### Inscription on Chongxu Hall

Nurture the vital qi to preserve life; hold breath in empty hall of few pillars. South shore Dao high neighborhood named beautiful; Taiwei wind warm magnolia clear.  
Hundred chapters love dense green forest; three bodies should write Laozi complete. No purple palace court visit day; two others few places white clouds light.

[Presented to Mr. Xiang]

The Qin Studio was my old residence, named for the qin, five in number. Mr. Xiang and disciples dwell there, discussing Zhuangzi and Laozi with fine interest. I once visited, recalling past affairs, also having parts better than many. Composed poem presented to Mr. Xiang, writing the truth.  
Qin Studio’s lofty taste has true wind; mountain pavilion extends guests not broken. Come to ask about life and death, not worldly; to talk Zhuang and Lao, not hurried.  
Glad now to return with you; regret yesterday left guests to share. Hermits perhaps compare the heart; this person does not chatter like the catalpa.

#### Celebration of Hunlun Hermitage Completion

High studio suddenly celebrates success; red stones and blue mountains press into sight. Integrity since old times binds worldly affairs; Zhichuan everywhere is family style.  
Red gold cabinet hides especially secret books; jade pot clear wine not empty. Returning to imperial court date should open; when I come, want to laugh and sing together.

#### Immortal Rock Temple

Still the immortal near leaning on rock opens; true hall what year finally overgrown? Today Buddhist palace just obtained; old mysterious cranes also fly here.  
One stream water glassy joins; myriad cloud mountains purple and green piled. Zen guests late night can sit together; full window bright moon just wandering.

#### Wang Jingxuan’s Sleep Descent Poem

All sounds silent, moon fills the sky; a game first victory, glance at mysterious elder. Golden pot drinks finished village wine; jade wheel idle song ancient wind.  
Envy me sleepless, spirit already clear; laugh at him greedy for sleep so strong. Turning back to repay lonely cloud’s way; clear and turbid come from self-difference.

#### Reply to Officer Zhou

Try in idle place to seek idle realm; pine and bamboo silent green fills autumn. Beyond world often troubles diligent orders; mountain corner luckily occasionally visits.  
One curtain fragrant grass long before courtyard; thousand-year old books sought on bridge. Invited to return south, happy to dwell here; clear talks deeply feel saintly grace.

#### Bamboo Treatment

Inspired to climb highest mountain; true wind long present able to climb. Worldly questions turbid substance can believe; beyond clouds clear roaming unwilling idle.  
Strange stones want to fly bright and clear; startled rapids straight down sound murmuring. Ordinary eyes likely hard to see; buds buy true man secretly coming and going.

#### Meng Qin’s Treatment

Purple wall fine guest has spirit trace; single tree bridge everywhere same. Since Hun family studied Great Ultimate; who else steps to blue sky?  
Before railing strange tree winter long green; beneath rock spirit light night long red. True marsh not following worldly cuts; leaving dust and world entering spirit power.

#### Ping Gai’s Treatment

Ancients gone attached to dragon scales; spirit black still records truth. Cave mouth recorded three sun bows; cloud question another spring.  
Fishing line near turtle fish quiet; woodcutter forgets machine tiger leopard tamed. Golden well not yet newly drawn; already no chest a speck of dust.

#### Yuntai’s Treatment

Han dynasty people and Dao soaring; places remain belonging to quiet square. Outside marriage peach blossoms not worldly kind; wind before cypress fruit has lingering fragrance.  
Staff pierces green mist to deep official; boat rides flood waves into vastness. One thousand eight hundred years, thirty generations; Yuntai empty blue jade and jade ornaments.

#### Jinkou’s Treatment

True true form inherits nurturing true material; myriad trees deep one water returns. Pearls shine night bright autumn waves calm; chimes hold frost tone dawn clouds open.  
Two immortals gone teaching who meets; three grains still await my coming. If sending blue boy to test traces; cut marriage no shadow falls on green moss.

#### Houcheng’s Treatment

Near pillow long river becomes altar; planning to surpass altar side to river bank. Cinnabar in earth winter warm; jade bamboo forms forest entering night cold.  
Water crane should think beyond dark image; mountain old man worries not reaching brow. Staff already points cinnabar scenery; secret dust net entangles me hard.

#### Gongmu’s Treatment

One altar secluded ancient ten thousand pine shade; intent to seek truth special place explore. Dark wild clouds cover green shore; sometimes sparse rain sprinkles green forest.  
True chart not yet fallen to previous hands; plain cloth worth seeking ancient sage’s heart. Crane carriage near passes resting place; peach blossom flowing water still worth seeking.

#### Pinggang’s Treatment

Thousand pines ten thousand bamboos shade true shrine; how many seek truth not recall return? Pillow stone pond terrace all like ancient; piercing clouds creek ravine like flying.  
Mysterious ape night long calls lonely heard; yellow crane wind high enters Taiwei. Straight from six heavens Hun screen quiet; saintly merit what generation not return?

#### Zhubu’s Treatment

Reflecting morning sun and evening glow; bitter no rank sends dust and sand. Old heard spirit grass thousand year seed; recently hidden people one or two families.  
Colorful phoenix often comes seeking bamboo fruit; spirit bird sometimes pecks immortal flowers. Great indeed past light guests; how have heart greedy for five horse car?

#### Yuju’s Treatment

Corner seat according to agreement has lingering fragrance; majesty preserved as if present moves trembling fear. Bamboo shoot stone both rise holding heaven’s gate; golden spring one belt naturally vast.  
Because talk marvel opens mysterious path; directly points no-where entering hometown. Late age who can count ten thousand one; days follow all realms more and more busy.

#### Beiyu’s Treatment

Full altar bright moon transforms palace spring; thousand ages lingering willow ferry. Green pond does not allow worldly things; jade brush no longer shows companions.  
Quiet seeking already with three mysteries pact; quiet joy who knows a bit of intimacy. Beyond world clear roaming worthy to imitate; traces lost no mark trampling fragrant dust.

#### Golden Elixir Poems

Forty-eight poems  
Golden cauldron mysterious pearl midnight work; colorful five hues fill the room. Only because sun and moon join and merge; yet turtle and snake take turns attacking.  
Suddenly seeing appearance just faint; long looking countenance becomes dim. Red onion to repay yang human dao; this true emptiness is not emptiness.  
False dharma men ask myriad kinds; you should seek purple gold elixir. On Kunlun mountain towers rise; in North Sea furnace dragon and tiger drill.

Troubled floating life a dream between; how many turn back lock three passes. Yellow granny suppress fate all easy; white tiger flies to throw down difficulty.  
Vermilion bird enters furnace three acres quiet; black turtle crouches cauldron lifelong leisure. Bright marvelous principle I know; only want to hide mechanism and old mountain.  
Do not discuss immortal bones or seek elixir; this principle mysterious has true gate. Few lost can know return root; teach people use this as root.  
Turtle and snake big and small should often give; sun and moon essence must all swallow. Only after clear master divides and cuts; hard to make wild field into grave.

## Volume Six of the Collected Sayings of the Thirtieth Celestial Master, Lord Xujing

### Red Lip Dot

Youling asked: Why does the gourd you carry not open its mouth? Reply to the Emperor.  
Small small gourd, born not large, body short. Inside has seed, no mouth how strange? Hiding the cosmos, who can understand this principle? Waist asks to carry; I now especially love. Better than hanging goldfish pouch.

### Remembering Peach Blossom Spring

Two poems  
Master Cai Yuanyuan suspected me and the Divine Elder and attendant Chen. Master Yuanyuan asked me: What is the extension of cultivation and refining? I quickly wrote small poems to answer.  
Words of long life passed by mouth; seeking elixir and golden liquid complete. Mixed into one thing to make immortals; Ding Ning speaks to the worthy. Do not swallow breath, do not spread nonsense; how know creation’s mystery? Use lead to cast mercury, mercury cast lead; clearly upside down and topsy-turvy.  
White clouds pile wrapping lotus; each branch fragrant and bright. Spirit turtle shore side rises auspicious wind; tower high twelve layers. Golden palace, blue clouds cover; cinnabar shines bright red. Spirit mechanism moves, ghosts and spirits respond; pure and true reach upper palace.

### Immortal River Fairy

Deng Dafu daytime six cranes at Hunlun Hermitage, invited me to inscribe. Thus composed.  
Do not blame spirit all plain; fully understand thousand years pine top. Feathered person’s hidden feelings bitterly agree. Earnestly compete to mark and write; turn and chant in response. Moreover have Xianyang brothers’ affairs; teach people to hear and forget worries. I was once marked by immortals. Once started to wave and sprinkle; successively unable to rest.

### Three Poems of Spring

### Establishing Demons and Governance

Kalpa fate about to renew; heavenly book descends grace; holy master commands demons. Right yin and yang mistaken; ghosts and spirits confused; relying on cities; spanning mountains and rivers. Killing qi blocks void; yin forms seize day; myriad people suffer calamities more and more. On Qingcheng appears glazed high seat; suddenly towering. Group demons angry raise halberds; competing running attacking mountain like weaving shuttle. Feeling divine light in an instant; dragon crushed tiger collapsed; mighty sound moves; lightning flashes thunder roars. Establish governance transform people; capture evil return to right; life and breath flourish, enjoy great harmony. Wind and cloud calm; see Heaven connect blue Milky Way; moon immerses clear waves.

### Again

True One forever exists; same essence as Great Void; marvelous gate opens itself. Since mixed origin first judgment; two forms spread scene; return to root; golden register spirit platform. Vast qi bursts open; valley spirit nourishes transformation; gradually sense spirit light comes from emptiness. Remote and absolute place; hear dragon roar tiger cry; suddenly wind and thunder. Marvelous Dao hard to refine; understand points transform fools into great talents. Try to speak plainly; clearly □ shape; clam contains deep moon; autumn rabbit carries womb. Ambitious men and women; once lofty scholars; do not let body and mind be soiled by worldly dust. After merit complete; let body dwell in purple palace; name ranks immortal steps.

### Again

Urgently cultivate; carefully calculate life; how much time can there be? No matter myriad kinds; elegant ways what use? One day body dies; cannot avoid parting. Suddenly think; life and death great matter; makes heart like sword and spear swing. Hard to hold; golden crow arrow swift; jade rabbit shuttle flying. Early awaken do not let fate; I clear who can marry young wife? Even if rich moon wrap; moon goddess sees and lets; let them cross state; has beauty like Xi Shi. This elegance no more heart to love; just mouth broad and open avoid disputes. Penglai relies; three thousand lines full; alone cross and return.

Immortal River Fairy  
In harmony with Yuan Gui  
Stirring with spirit innate gift; carefree nature shares primordial balance. Do not create different views to disturb my truth. Now within is master; all mixed and transformed into people. How more pure words clear and thorough; light dust wants to stain no cause. Only should get this then concentrate spirit. Hundred demons all cease fighting; six paths forever stop revolving.

### Full Courtly Fragrance

Idle wrapped in effort; no middle marvelous use; must not plan to discuss and examine. Dragon descends tiger subdued; true earth from within yellow. Action, movement, rest, and food; follow green measure, do not move true yang. Returning to root place; spirit condenses pulse stays; jade realm emits heavenly light. Wind high; roc wings far; water deep boat moves; principles clear. Only know heart is Dao; solely serve Heaven’s presentation. Careless call spirits summon ghosts; [pray for rain] sunny, not madness. Foolish and confused; wind and thunder in hand; use reverses perverse.

Immortal River Fairy  
In harmony with reading Yang Xi’s biography  
Since ancient pure and numinous marvel descended; Anfei came to serve Yang Jun. Due to fate’s dark meeting, extraordinary order. Immortal wind briefly set up appearance; true Dao originally has no kin. Only Yuan Gui can visit; deeply convey this meaning. Everyone should appreciate and arrange new writings; avoid worldly dusts; mock and laugh at heavenly people.

Full Courtly Fragrance  
Used for True Man rhyme in harmony with Yuan Gui  
Heart and mind both clear; ancient and modern share joy; surpass green, stop talk of no match. Heavenly gate high and marvelous; should submit to supreme person open. How compare ordinary moods; square inch land, no store dust. Still must trust; gold firm and stone hard; one will cut no return. True yuan, truly lovable; true master true friend; for now rejoice no suspicion. Among these further win freedom; disregard form. Only thus proper expression and enlightenment; rely on true interest, change mundane body. Spirit and clarity meet; dust infant worldly net; do not talk about origin.

### Song of the Cave Immortal

Lonely peak highest; no one else can reach. Ten thousand li void no edge sign. Autumn high scene quiet; mist rolls clouds gather; wind and dew wrap; only moonlight shines high. Floating life passing guests; good day fine night; drunken dance wild song mistaken dawn and dusk. Who knows one nature; perfect Ganges; once ten thousand ages; brightness not old.

Mix hundred gods return one; one thought connect heaven penetrate earth; then begin complete non-action. Roaring wind and rain arise; assist world aid bright time.

### Crossing Clear Sky

Six poems  
First watch one point first watch start; city gate half closed people chain. Thatched hermitage elegant no matters; lone lamp opposite light clear void. Reed mat steady body not bound; cross legged great sit heart calm calm. Moon wheel slight out heaven corner; void inside reveal nameless pearl.  
Second watch two points deep watch deep; palace bell sound ends night deep deep. Bright moon fills sky like painted gold; same light same shadow no gloom. Rise idle play stringless qin; sound high tune ancient startle heart. Qin done alone song still alone chant; pine wind stream water all know friend.  
Third watch three points middle watch middle; marriage opens clouds gather quiet no wind. Moonlight bursts into crystal palace; four directions up and down same void. Brightness everywhere turns Huaxu same; thousand ages ten thousand ages no beginning end. Iron snake flies like flowing rainbow; ride backwards white wind roam Kongtong.  
Fourth watch four points long watch long; Funiu sends mouse heart not busy. Elixir furnace suppress fire produce new fragrance; group yin peel all return true yang. Golden girl wood father happy match; brew next drink no stop cup. Host guest reversed feelings no harm; late watch part leave still forget.  
Fifth watch five points late watch late; blue sky wind dew urge person cold. Fusang pushes out red silver plate; city gate still sound dust noisy. Bright dark two scenes fight; born come die go confusing change. Daoist room heaven space wide; sun rise three poles then open gate.

Walk alone and sit alone; sing alone and harmonize alone. Day by day street head pass once; I do not know myself who knows me? Human world dawn dusk four seasons; mysterious inside news never shift. Watch face show know not know; know time together sing luo luo li.

### Spring
