# Sayings of the True Man of Danyang

Collected by the Spirit-Hidden Master Wang Yi

In the great calm of the guimao year, third month, I inquired, having first bowed to my master south of Fan Mingshu’s hermitage in Mouping. The master asked, “From where do you come?” I answered, “From Suwu. I look up to your virtue, not counting wealth as riches, content and at ease. Sitting to advance on this dao, I heard its breeze and rejoiced. I wish to serve humbly, to listen with folded hands.” The master then smiled warmly and said, “It is rare for the young to have a heart for learning the dao.” After a long pause, he added, “When hungry, eat your meal; when done, sleep soundly.”

One day, the master saw me standing with hands clasped and sharply said, “A daoist only needs to be open and free, not to keep face. This hermitage is no place for scabs, and you are no official. If you cling to worldly rites, then your connections are but formalities. The ancients said: ‘On the Three Mountains, the human feelings are thin; throughout the Four Seas, the path of righteousness is rare.’ This is no empty talk.”

The master often whispered, “Those who learn the dao must awaken themselves; failure to awaken is due to confusion and darkness. To dispel this haze, first cleanse the heart; it lies in clarity, depth, and brightness alone. When the功 (achievement) arrives, it is done; no need to knock or beg others. This is skill or clumsiness, calm and clear.”

The master walked the dao road in Shumu, where monks and daoists came and went. Whether known or unknown, all first paid respects. Followers doubted and asked, “If they have never met, why bow?” The master said, “The dao is founded on softness, weakness, humility. Besides, the three teachings are but siblings with different doors. Confucius said, ‘Even those who hold the whip, I honor them.’ Never heard that one bow is a fault.”

The master said, “The patriarch was skilled in letters; after understanding the dao, he was especially quick-witted. He would hide meanings in heads and split characters, weave hidden words like linked pearls, all without thought. Often composing poetry with others, if there were rhymes or meter, all would finish except the patriarch, who would end with a call of two hundred and sixty golden bone joints. All marveled, thinking it immortal speech. Who now can follow? Only Lord Panxi somewhat resembles the steps.”

The master said, “When the patriarch once arrived at Dengzhou, wearing a bamboo hat with a hanging quail, holding a section of wood and carrying an iron guan, his appearance strange and ancient, he begged in the market. The people of Dengzhou did not recognize him. At night he returned to the temple and wrote a quatrain on the wall:

‘Parting from Zhongnan’s Water Bamboo Village,  
No brothers, sisters, nor grandchildren at home.  
Thousands of miles seeking true friends,  
Leading into the gate of longevity and deathlessness.’  

At dawn, he brushed off his clothes and departed. A few days later, the prefect He Shilie came to the temple, saw the poem, and admired it deeply. He responded in rhyme:

‘Looking back after three years from the old village,  
Forgetting the courtyard bamboo and grown children.  
Someday I’ll brush off my sleeves and seek you,  
Promising a peaceful knock upon your door.’”

The master said, “A thin taste nourishes qi; avoiding anger nourishes nature; enduring insult and lowliness nourishes virtue and guards oneness; purity and calm under the eaves nourish the dao. Not having name recorded in registers, nor heart tied to power and profit—this is how one sheds the human shell and walks with Heaven.”

The master said, “Wine is the brew that disrupts nature; meat is the thing that cuts life short. Best is not to eat them. Wine and meat offenses can be forgiven; but if one offends by lust, the crime is unforgivable. Why? Because lust is fiercer than wolves and tigers, ruining good conduct, harming noble deeds, wasting essence and extinguishing spirit, even causing the body to fall. Thus, it is the great sin of the daoist.”

The master said, “Nothing surpasses leisure for peace and joy. If a daoist grows weary in the hermitage, gather one or two companions, hang a pouch on your side, drag a staff, sing and wander. When you encounter good mountains and waters, linger awhile; do not covet the journey’s length.”

The master said to me, “Those who learn the dao must have a beginning and an end; do not abandon halfway and become a laughingstock. Especially you, a scholar—do you not know that even ordinary men must establish a proper career? How much more so for daoists, who must set the great matter of standing in the world.”

The master often wrote a large couplet and said to fellow daoists:  
“Quickly topple the mountain of self and other,  
Urgently break open the dragon-tiger’s cave.”  

I asked, “How to know the mountain of self and other? And what of the dragon-tiger’s cave—may I ask its direction?” The master laughed, “The heavenly secret is not lightly given. Look carefully and see if you awaken or not.”

One day the master called me; after a long wait, I came. He asked, “Where have you been?” I answered, “I was sleeping at the noon window, spirit calm and clear. By the bedside lay a copy of the Zhuangzi; I picked it up and read. That is why I was not here.” The master said, “The dao requires heart accord; if you bind it again with words, when will the end come? Thus the dao, when understood, makes the southern flower’s confusion more confusing.”

At Huating the master said, “What is the dao? The ancestral black is the root and source; do you not know it issues from the nose? Have you not heard Guangchengzi say: ‘The cinnabar turtle cart rests steadily, the crane’s embryo and tortoise’s breath stretch on endlessly.’”

The master told the assembly, “If one studies the dao single-mindedly, everyone can become immortal. Unlike worldly striving, which has rise and fall, Confucianism is broad but lacks essence, the dao is simple and easy to practice. But pure stillness and non-action are the highest methods.”

The master lived in a humble room, with only a table, bench, inkstone, and sheepskin. Spacious and empty of all else. Morning brought a bowl of porridge; at noon a bowl of millet gruel. Beyond that, the crowd’s vegetables passed not his lips. One day he summoned me and bade me sit long. I asked, “Does my master’s dao have doing or not?” He said, “No. Though in poems he sings of dragons, tigers, and infant goddesses, all are messages for you. The essence of the dao is no more than nourishing the black. People often lose their black by chasing fame and profit. Those who learn the dao have no other task but to nurture qi. When heart fluids descend and kidney qi rises to the spleen, the primal qi swirls and does not disperse, then the elixir forms. The liver and lungs are the pathways of coming and going; practice stillness long enough, and you will know. If you do not nurture the black, even if you carry Mount Tai or leap the Northern Sea, it is not the dao. These words were spoken ten days before transformation.”

I and companions Cao and Liu stood outside the humble room. The master suddenly appeared and said, “The dao is pure stillness and non-action, carefree and free, unstained and unattached. If you can chew on these twelve words and break them open, you will be a thorough daoist. Trust the old man’s words; practice them and you will benefit. You will not regret your youth.”

The master, at the western outskirts of Huang County in Ma Congren’s hermitage, sang:  
“Though days consume ten thousand taels of gold,  
It is just right to win clothes and simple meals.”  

He said he heard this last year beyond the frontier, and liked its reason, so he recorded it, though he did not know who composed it. Ma Yuanzhi said, “This is from Elder Shun’s ‘Reed River Collection.’” The master said, “How wondrous these words.”

The master said, “Who is the ancestor of family style? Zhong and Lü passed it down personally.” The verse went:  
“A single spark of spirit flashes the great void,  
Masterful brushwork no hand can copy.  
Do not compare with the bright moon idly,  
If a flaw appears, how can it resemble me?”  

These words reveal a hint of sharpness.

The master said, “The black is hard to govern, swift as a startled horse; only the still can master it. You must abandon outer longing; though dazzling blossoms appear before your eyes, it is like exploring mountains and valleys. Only then is the daoist’s heart true. If you do not reach the place of no heart, you cannot govern it. Thus the daoist values no heart.”

The master also said, “When the heart is steady, emotions vanish; when the body is empty, the black moves; when the heart dies, the spirit lives; when yang flourishes, yin fades. This is nature’s principle, unknown to the ignorant. They think of descendants and judge daoists useless. Why not ponder deeply?”

The master said, “At over forty years, I met my master and entered the dao; thus my temples grayed. In my belly was a clump of hair—how did it come? For over ten years I longed for Guanzhong, nurturing spirit black alone. It is like a call in an empty valley; when called, it answers. Is it a separate thing? No, it is the midst of emptiness. My friends disbelieve, but in true stillness, nurturing it, one will know.”

The master said, “The Sea Toad Elder was once prime minister of Yan. One day he awakened to the dao and severed family ties. His poem said:  
‘Casting off the burning house of three thousand mouths,  
Abandoning the gate soldiers of a million families.’  

Afterwards, he begged for his own needs, played in taverns, even carried wine and combs to brothels, without shame. Later, some daoists said, ‘I come from wealth and rank; you are no Sea Toad Elder.’”

The master said, “The way of pure stillness, if one can discern it, is perfect and complete. Thus the scripture says: ‘If one can always be pure and still, Heaven and Earth all return.’ This Heaven and Earth is not the outer world that covers and supports, but the Heaven and Earth within the body. Above the diaphragm is Heaven; below is Earth. When heavenly qi descends and earth veins flow, harmonizing above and below, essence and qi naturally consolidate. This is what the little immortal Ren spoke.”

The master said, “Guarding qi’s wonder lies in preserving essence, especially guarding it in sleep. When about to rest, bring forth right thought; all worries vanish; gather the body’s sides; breathe softly; soul does not wander inward; spirit does not roam outward. Thus the black essence settles.” The master said, “Confucians say repay virtue with virtue, repay resentment with uprightness. The ancient true man said: ‘Bind friends with faith, repay with grace.’ This is supreme.”

When the master was in Laizhou, a man named Jiang Xi brought the “Biography of Lü Gong.” The master read that people only seek fame and profit, not knowing the body holds spirit, chasing things without return, losing all naturalness. Who is to blame? The master closed the book and said, “These words truly hit the mark. Yet the world has no awakeners; no wonder the dao is hard to walk.”

There was Han Tao, styled Qingfu, who admired Tao Yuanming and Shao Yaofu, calling himself Lord of the Garden of Peace and Joy. When the master returned from Guanzhong to Shumu, passing Jinan, Han invited him to his garden and offered plain food. After the meal, Han bowed to the master and said, “Since youth I have longed for the dao; now my hair is white. Fortunate to meet you, master, please grant a word to enlighten my ignorance.” The master replied, “The dao’s essence is no heart as body, forgetting words as function, softness and weakness as root, purity and stillness as base. If applied to others, one must restrain food and drink, cut off thought, sit quietly to regulate breath, rest peacefully to nourish the black. When the heart does not wander, nature settles; when the body does not toil, essence is whole; when spirit is undisturbed, the elixir forms. Then extinguish emotion in the void, calm spirit to the utmost. This is to gain the marvelous dao without leaving the courtyard.” Han thanked him, saying, “The great dao is vast and obscure, no questions asked. Now hearing this wonderful discourse, I have found the gate and entered.”

Cao and Lai were originally Confucian scholars who understood both Confucianism and the dao, longtime close friends. They often asked calmly, “When the master was in Guanzhong, how did he practice the dao?” Cao and Lai answered, “The master wore a rough cloth robe winter and summer, ate simply and sufficiently. In deep winter’s snow and cold, the hermitage had no fire, only cold water. Yet his spirit black was harmonious and smooth, without chill. Ten years thus, without the dao black in the belly, he could not have endured.”

The master said, “In all things, one must be prepared to avoid harm. Thus, for the daoist, in youth guard against lust; prepare early, and immortality is possible. If white-haired and feeble, then seeking the dao is like looking for furs after great cold—not too late?”

The master said, “The thirty-six dao guides and twenty-four return elixirs are gradual gates to entering the dao; do not rush. The great dao, if exhausted on furnace and cauldron, taking images from turtles and snakes, only creates trouble and adds falsehood to nature. This is waiting for people’s excess. Thus the daoists left the elixir scriptures and treatises, thousands of scriptures and myriad discourses, which can be summed in one phrase: purity and stillness.”

The master said, “Purity and stillness mean purifying the heart’s source, cleansing the black sea. When the heart’s source is pure, external things cannot disturb; thus emotion settles and spirit arises. When the black sea is clean, evil desires cannot interfere; thus essence is whole and belly full. So the heart is clear as still water, the black is nurtured like a child. When black is refined, spirit is numinous; when spirit is numinous, black transforms—this is the fruit of purity and stillness. If one acts with heart and effort, there is an end to method and technique; if one acts with no heart and no effort, this is endless pure emptiness.”

The master said, “Non-action means no thinking, no worrying. Guard against love, desire, anger; accumulate harm and benefit. Though questions arise, act yet remain non-action; though involved, remain without involvement. How much more when single-mindedly pure, intent cultivating qi, spirit floating and roaming in carefree realms, entering the land of no-thingness.”

The master said, “Liu Gaoshang dwelt in a humble room for forty years, doing nothing else but emptying his heart, filling his belly, removing showiness, forgetting name, abandoning profit, purifying spirit, perfecting qi. The elixir naturally forms, immortality naturally arises. Thus there is praise:  
‘Seal the exchange, close the gate—  
Once spoken, now seeing this man,  
Truly simple and proper.’”

The master said, “No heart does not mean like dumb cats and dogs, but to keep the heart in the realm of purity and stillness, without evil thoughts. Common people lack pure and still hearts; daoists have no dust or filth in their hearts. This is not to say both have no heart, like wood, stone, cats, or dogs.”

The master said, “Non-birth and non-death, seeing the Tathāgata, when awakened, one avoids rebirth. Master Qiu said: this is the departure of the yin spirit; when reaching the heavenly court, suddenly twin flowers fly forth, then the yang spirit emerges. This is the initial ground.”

The master said, “Great daoists’ feelings are distant; non-action is the wondrous root. The world asks about love of things; troubles do not follow.”

The master said, “If a cultivator’s功 (merit) is not full when the great limit comes, sages do not teach death. If one does not cultivate, when the great limit comes, there is no escape.”

The master said, “One thought not broken, a lifetime rests.” Gong Daosheng asked, “How is it when always calm and silent?” The master replied, “In the future, both calm and silent are not needed.”

Yu Qingfeng asked, “After years of practice, the dao eye is not clear, the heart ground not nimble; why?” The master said, “Nothing else; your practice is not precise.”

The master said, “All men and women have been from non-being to being since beginningless time. All kinds of love, desire, and greed arise from the world of giving and taking. All births from wombs, eggs, and moist transformations, all forms and natures arise from love and desire. Nature is born from love; life arises from desire; all arise from love and desire, with reversals and accords, giving rise to jealousy and expansion, thus the wheel of rebirth continues endlessly. The dharma says to purify the earth by purifying the heart. If the heart is pure and still, the wheel of rebirth ceases.”

The master loved to eat porridge; at noon he ate a bowl, then talked dao with people, tirelessly instructing the younger. The master was a kind and benevolent gentleman. In Laiyang he composed short verses; after a bowl of porridge, he would compose a ten-part功 (achievement) verse for students to ponder. Those who only eat and sit without making dao their matter, their blame and burden are clear.

The master said, “Those who learn the dao need not read many scriptures; it confuses the mind and hinders the dao work. Reading the commentaries of He Shanggong on the Dao De Jing, or Jinlingzi on the Yinfu Jing, occasionally is no harm. Better still is not to read at all, but to nurture qi in the land of Zi Lu—this is the best plan.”

The master said, “Daoists, in walking, standing, sitting, and lying, must not for a moment have heart absent from the dao. Walking, place feet on even paths; standing, fix your feelings on great emptiness; sitting, balance breath at the nose’s tip; sleeping, hold the pearl beneath the navel. Over time, breath regulates without interruption; all day like a fool—this is true功 (achievement), not forced practice.”

The master said, “All beginners must cut off worldly affairs from today on; do not hang your heart on them. If there is a thread not removed, the dao is not firm. Do not think of past affairs, do not ponder future ones; just block what is before you, then you are a person without affairs.”

The master also said, “Daoists do not disdain poverty; poverty is the root of life. When hungry, eat a bowl of porridge; when sleepy, lay a bundle of grass; passing days and nights in threads and strips—this is the daoist’s living. Thus it is known that purity and stillness cannot be attained by the rich and noble.”

Passing Qing She, some invited the master to a vegetarian feast. Among those seated were several monks; one boasted of his eloquence, disputing endlessly. The master calmly replied, “If you remove the self, all else you do not know.” The monk blushed and lost words.

The master said, “To be a daoist, one must be a man of strong resolve; do not be doubtful or hesitant. Only remember that life and nature are great matters; strive without retreat, aiming for certain success. If you have too much affection for children and women, and little ambition for smoke and clouds, you are not a daoist.”

The master said, “The black within the body cannot scatter; the spirit within the heart cannot be obscured.” Someone asked, “How can qi not scatter?” The master said, “The body does nothing.” Asked, “How can spirit not be obscured?” The master said, “The heart has no affairs.” Asked, “If body and heart are so, can one dwell in a hermitage?” The master said, “If you can manage it, then rest well.”

The master said, “The daoist’s heart and nature must not follow worldly affairs. If you drag a flowered staff, mock the wind and chant to the moon, delighting in coldness and detachment, what harm? But to beg at gates, push and shove, that is the daoist’s daily family style.”

The master said, “When you first entered Guanzhong, you begged for one meal and ate one meal. Now your功 (practice) is little, yet you pick good places to stay and good food to eat. When you become a daoist, you will not rest, but seek to repay debts.”

The master said, “When I first begged alms in Guanzhong, I went to a tavern where a drunkard cursed and abused me. Later, he gave me a punch, and I fled. He grabbed me and punched again; I had to endure. Have you ever met such demonic obstacles?” The disciples answered, “No.” The master said, “Good, when you do, do not argue.”

The master said, “The patriarch’s dao forbids fine clothes, forbids good meals, forbids singing and dancing; only that the heart not cling to anything.”

The master said, “When I was among the common folk, I weighed meat and drank wine; now I have abstained for over ten years. If one eats wine and meat, one can still be an immortal, only less adept. If the heart does not hold the dao, yet loves wine and greed for strong smells, only envy the mouth and belly; the karmic retribution is hard to escape, ending as lowly ghosts.”

The master said, “The patriarch gathered four men: Qiu, Liu, Tan, and Ma. He looked to the virtuous Wind Master. The patriarch said, ‘If you hear it, block your ears; when you see it, still hold the treasure and dare not move.’ Liu Shishu also spoke thus.”

The master said, “Once in the humble room, we spoke idly about new melons. The daoists heard and the next day made melon buns, entered the room, ate three, and were punished three days without meals.”

The master said, “The patriarch once sent disciples to Ninghai to convert small coins and rice for my use. The disciples said, ‘What if other brothers go and do not return to the village?’ The patriarch angrily beat them, stopping at dawn, beating countless times. I wished to retreat, but thanks to Brother Qiu’s advice, I did not forget.”

The master said, “In the village, the patriarch ordered disciples to beg alms in Laizhou. After several days, hesitation remained. At night he dreamed the master said, ‘Tomorrow stretch out your hand, be a good man, go to the street and show your hand.’ The false heart’s obstacle receded; thus the master spoke.”

The master said, “Returning home, first time on the street, the patriarch applied a small horn of rouge to the face. Secretly thought, ‘Not afraid to meet children and women who know me, only afraid to meet kin.’ Often thinking of Fan Mingshu’s house, wishing to rest a little, but seeing the closest kin already there, he said, ‘This time no shame.’”

A disciple asked, “The ‘Ascension of Lord Xu’ says: after one thousand two hundred and forty years, eight hundred will ascend as immortals. How so?” The master said, “The patriarch once said to teach ten thousand commoners; the Prince Immortal also said so.”

The master said, “Zhang Wenzi has a very good phrase: in all dao talk, just take care to nurture the body’s treasure.” The master laughed, “He opens the mat and speaks, but is really advising others.”

The master said, “A hundred times no singing, ten times no urging; if you come out yourself, these are words the patriarch once said, thus made real.”

The master said, “Most people boast they can conquer themselves, often unwilling to be humble to others.”

The master said, “On the road, finding a donkey’s contract, the patriarch beat until dawn, punching face and head many times.”

The master said, “People still do not believe; if on Qingfeng’s day there is a believer, the master smiles slightly. Mo Dacheng said, ‘The master’s conduct is such, yet people believe.’ Qingfeng said, ‘One believer is an immortal; because of this, many do not believe.’”

The master said, “Deeply hiding white snow is not for caution; widely gathering yellow buds is not greed.” After speaking, he laughed, “How is that?” He also said, “In dreams forged a shadowless sword; in the dharma, the heart of sentient beings departs.” And, “Under the Jade Pool Palace, the green phoenix dances; in the viewing garden, white cranes fly.”

The master returned to the sea; the households all strictly observed vegetarian fasts, joining the Five Assemblies established by the patriarch. As a boy, the master heard that when Ma was in Dengzhou, the assembly numbered over one hundred. They told the master, “We have all bathed and sat in stillness, abstained from meat and wine for seven days. We wish to pray with the pure assembly to dispel past karma.” The master said, “Good. You have been pure and upright for seven days and still speak of blessings. Ma Feng’s disciples are all pure and upright lifelong, severing desires, cutting meat and wine; blessings are abundant.” The assembly all bowed and marveled, saying, “The teaching of purity is truly inconceivable.” From then on, people in the three prefectures took the teaching house by house, spreading to the Ten Directions. Hearing the news, the great teaching revived, beginning with the master.

The master asked the disciples, “How many hours in a day?” The disciples answered, “A day has six hours.” The master said, “Day and night total how many hours?” The disciples said, “Day and night total twelve hours.” The master said, “In the twelve hours of day and night, the heavenly dao moves, turning creation. Is there a moment’s rest?” The disciples said, “No rest.” The master said, “All who learn the dao must follow Heaven’s dao, turning creation within themselves. In the twelve hours, always pure and upright, not raising a thread of dust or thought—then you truly cultivate. Day by day, month by month, no break, then you become an immortal. If功 (merit) is lost or practice fails, how can you reach understanding? I see you all, not one hour in twelve is focused on the dao. Receiving offerings from the Ten Directions, how can you repay? One day you close your eyes and return to the wheel of rebirth. When will you escape? I now warn you: only by clearing the heart and sending away desire, unstained by myriad greens, spirit and black harmonized, is the dao. Practice thus and you will not err. If you slacken and fall, fail in conduct, it is not my fault. Do you not think of your seven ancestors, who in life made evil karma, suffer in the dark, hoping their descendants attain the dao and rescue them to Heaven? Each should bear this in mind, strengthen the heart, embrace the dao until death. This is my wish. Treasure it.” The disciples heard this kind voice, all fearful yet comforted, and strove to encourage themselves.

The master said to the assembly, “The dao has no form or name; it is the ancestor of spirit black. The primal black descends and transforms; spirit and brightness arise naturally. Refining spirit and uniting with dao is true cultivation. Other names and images are confusing and unreliable. I recall for you the great outline: the key to cultivation is not to leave spirit black. Spirit black is nature and life; nature and life are dragon and tiger; dragon and tiger are lead and mercury; lead and mercury are water and fire; water and fire are infant girl and boy; infant girl and boy are true yin and true yang; true yin and true yang are spirit black. All other names and images must not be clung to—only the two words spirit black. To nurture black and perfect spirit, one must block all attachments, outwardly pure and upright, long and focused, spirit condensed and black merged. Three years without leakage, the lower elixir forms; six years without leakage, the middle elixir forms; nine years without leakage, the upper elixir forms. This is called the three elixirs complete, ninefold功 (achievement) finished; marrow condenses and transforms, blood vessels become true; inner complete and outer overflowing; light and shadow thoroughly bright; silent and unmoving, responding and sensing endlessly. A thousand changes and myriad transformations, sitting or standing, life or death, thirty-six thousand spirits leap and roam the world, governing the Three Realms. Amid the eight hardships, a thousand calamities and myriad poisons cannot destroy. Even in great kalpa changes, floods and four directions clashing, spirits fill the great void, yet no obstruction. Thus Heaven sometimes collapses, Earth sometimes sinks, mountains sometimes crumble, seas sometimes dry; all forms end in ruin at kalpa’s end. Only those who learn the dao, reaching where spirit and dao unite, are forever unbroken,功 (merit) reaching the Nine Ancestors ascending to the Supreme Clarity.”
