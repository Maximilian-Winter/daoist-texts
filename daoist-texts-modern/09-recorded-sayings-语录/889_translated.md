## Postscript to the Record of the Eighty-Five Transformations of the Venerable Master Xu of the Western Mountain

In the year of the Jia Shen in the Jiading era, the Patriarch Master Xu descended upon Jinling, revealing the teachings of loyalty and filial piety, broadly transforming all beings, guiding them to return to the true dao. There was a layman named Wang who, moved by the sacred teaching, devoted all his family wealth to establish the Chongzhen Daoist Institute west of the Tianqing Temple, where incense and offerings were enshrined; to this day the temple’s appearance remains.

Shi Cen, following the master’s instruction, expounded the profound dao. At that time, disciples Xing Daojian and Liang Daoning also founded the Yongwu Daoist Institute north of the Jiahui Tavern, a place to welcome celestial guests. The gathering of mist and clouds numbered over a thousand. Among those who embraced the steadfast resolve of gold and stone and held a heart of hunger and thirst for the dao, only Wang Daochong, Song Daosheng, Zhao Daotai, Zhao Daojie, Lin Shouyi, Jia Shoucheng, Liu Daoyi, and Kong Shoushan stand out. These few had read the *Biography of the Western Mountain* praising the master’s merits for many days.

Recently, Song Daosheng brought the *Biography of the Twelve Perfected Lords* and requested corrections. Upon review, it was found that the wording was repetitive and the chapters mixed, causing readers to grow weary, which was deeply regrettable. Thus Shi Cen corrected the deeds, arranged chapters and sentences, and composed eighty-five transformations, each with its own poem. He also found that disciple Xing Daojian held the scroll consistently from beginning to end, worthy of praise, which delighted Shi Cen greatly.

When the poems were completed, Zhu Shouzhong came to assist in careful examination, so that no error or confusion remained, thus the master’s biography passed to posterity without doubt. Hence the master’s sacred功 and道行 shine forth like the clear sky at midday. Having refined the daoist institutes and compiled the poems and biographies, and with Xing Daojian gathering funds to print and disseminate the record, it will endure for a thousand generations without end. How could this record not last forever, ensuring the names of Xing and Liang remain immortal? — Postscript by Shi Cen, the Valiant and Enlightened Perfected of the Western Mountain.

## Preface to the Record of the Eighty-Five Transformations of the Venerable Master Xu of the Western Mountain

Immortals can be learned, and immortality can be achieved by effort—this is true indeed. The dao of immortals lies in inner accumulation of功 and diligence, and outer application of virtue and conduct. When功 and conduct are manifest, they move Heaven and Earth, stir ghosts and spirits—this is the natural principle.

功 and conduct are not matters of mere wisdom or strength; how could one attain them otherwise? In ancient times, Patriarch Master Xu sincerely rectified his heart and intentions, maintaining purity, constancy, and stillness, preserving spirit and solidifying qi, embracing the primordial and guarding the One—was this not sacred功? He cultivated benevolence and nourished virtue, aided the poor and relieved suffering, rescuing those in peril, always acting to save. He transformed and guided good people to enter the dao and cultivate, putting others before self, impartial with all things—was this not道行?

From this we see that功 and conduct just suffice to perfect the sacred dao, to uproot the home and ascend above the Nine Purities, a marvel unheard of by the ancients and moderns alike. Therefore, this record is truly a mirror reflecting the master’s功 and virtue. The poems are not mere flowery words of disciples, but chronicles of deeds praising the master’s great feats. It is hoped that later scholars will know the master’s way of功 and conduct, and by practicing and emulating them, will fill themselves with道德 and verify the immortal path, surely racing alongside the many perfected of the Western Mountain.

The setting of eighty-five transformations is not merely to record past events, but to preserve the master’s teaching and transformative intent, with great hope for later scholars. May they be encouraged and advance! In the year Bingwu of the Song dynasty, Shi Cen, the Valiant and Enlightened Perfected of the Western Mountain, respectfully bows and writes this preface.

## Record of the Five Transformations, Volume One  
*Compiled by Shi Cen, the Valiant and Enlightened Perfected of the Western Mountain*

### Original Transformation

The Patriarch’s surname was Xu, given name Xun, styled Jingzhi. His great-great-grandfather Ying, great-grandfather Wu, and father Su were all from Xuchang, known for their high integrity and refusal to serve office, descendants of Yingyang. During the late Han, his father fled to Nanchang in Yuzhang and settled there. In the second year of Haochiwu, his mother dreamed of a golden phoenix carrying a pearl falling into her palm; she played with it then swallowed it. Soon her belly moved, and she conceived, giving birth to the Patriarch.

Poem:

A golden phoenix bearing pearl descends from the Nine Heavens,  
The Holy Mother of Gaoyang births a worthy sage.  
Red light auspiciously rises in the orchid chamber,  
The Purple Mansion carves his name in jade scrolls.  
If father and ancestors had not cultivated virtue and conduct,  
How could sons and grandsons become immortals?  
Profound功 and wondrous dao surpass past and present,  
Blessings extend to sovereign and people for centuries.

### Transformation of the Immortal Siblings

The distant journey to Jiqu Mountain, Lord Mai, and Military Protector Mu were all disciples twice removed of the Patriarch.

Poem:

At Erxu Port, their dao skills were high,  
They hid their bodies in Jiqu, avoiding worldly toil.  
Unconcerned with competing for gain in military camps,  
Who would expect them to cling to fame or worldly ranks?  
The immortal lineage’s source is far away,  
Roots and branches intertwine naturally.  
The Patriarch again gained brothers,  
Far different from the mundane affairs of common folk.

### Enlightenment of Truth Transformation

The Patriarch was born bright and wise, with handsome and majestic bearing. From youth he was versed in broad learning yet detached from worldly nature. Once while hunting, he shot a Tang deer, hitting its fawn; the doe still turned to lick it, but soon died. Moved, he immediately broke and discarded his bow and arrows.

Poem:

Heavenly form and dao countenance pure without dust,  
Eyebrows and eyes clear and detached beyond the world.  
His breadth and tolerance embrace rivers and seas,  
His sincere heart commands ghosts and spirits.  
Not by shooting deer was his primal nature revealed,  
How else could he grasp the phoenix and verify the utmost truth?  
Engaging with beings to benefit life, his hidden virtue deepens,  
To this day his merits shine as if newly born.

### Diligent Study Transformation

The Patriarch devoted himself to study, mastering the classics and histories, understanding astronomy, geography, music, the Five Phases, and prophetic texts. He especially loved the arts of immortal cultivation, reaching great subtlety. Hearing that the Master Ding Yi of Haomeng in Xi’an possessed the supreme divine formula, he went to study under him and received all its secrets.

Poem:

Innate wisdom surpasses common fools,  
Resolutely penetrating the books of myriad schools.  
In the world one must exhaust worldly affairs,  
To seek immortality one must grasp the immortal pivot.  
How could the wondrous dao be wholly mine?  
I hope to obtain the divine formula to aid the multitudes.  
Fortunate indeed that Lord Hao opened the treasure,  
Beautiful功 and conduct perfectly matched.

### Site Selection Transformation

Together with Guo Pu, he sought famous mountains and good lands as a place to dwell in truth. They found the sunny side of the Western Mountain, the Xiaoyao Mountain, at the Jin family residence, where they moved. This is now the blessed land of Xiaoyao, site of the Yulong Wanshou Palace. The Jin family was later revered as divine, with legends. Day by day he practiced cultivation, and today the Elixir Well and Medicine Mortar remain. He sought no fame or recognition. In his village, his filial piety and friendship transformed the people; his friends followed his virtue and righteousness.

Poem:

The blessed land of Western Mountain is the immortal capital,  
Emerald peaks and clear streams resemble a painted scroll.  
Together with Lord Guo, we divined the omen,  
Thus we were granted the Jin family’s joyful relocation.  
Natural fengshui suits cultivation,  
Day by day with friends we reap and hoe.  
The villagers rejoice and follow virtue’s transformation,  
From this the dao’s reputation spreads over rivers and lakes.

### Golden Lamp Transformation

Once a seller of iron lamp stands lit a lamp at night. Seeing a spot where the lacquer peeled, he examined it and found gold beneath. The next day he sought the owner to return it. If there was any gain, the Patriarch would never take it unless it was just.

Poem:

Known for innate honesty praised by all,  
How could I accept gold lamp stands from human desire?  
Even ten thousand measures of gain are not just,  
One measure left to me I do not cherish.  
Wealth is like floating clouds, gathering and dispersing,  
Conduct is like the sun, shining ever brighter.  
The Patriarch looks up to ancestors’ resolve,  
Even Yao’s abdication was but lightly regarded.

### Jingyang Transformation

Though recommended for filial and incorrupt office, he refused. The court repeatedly sent honors and commands. Reluctantly, in the first year of Taikang, he was appointed magistrate of Jingyang County in Shu Commandery, aged forty-two.

Poem:

Benevolent reputation fills the county, beloved by the people,  
A worthy governor’s memorial reaches the Jade Steps.  
Clouds bear the red phoenix bearing the edict,  
Winds blow white cranes out of the mountains.  
Worldly dust cannot obscure the nature of mist and clouds,  
The hall is empty, the timber is fit for building.  
Imperial command bestowed favor, how dare I refuse?  
Jingyang’s virtuous governance thus begins.

### Benevolent Governance Transformation

At the start of his duties, he admonished clerks to abandon greed and pettiness, eliminated petty troubles, freed prisoners, and opened teachings of the dao. Officials and people were pleased and wished to renew themselves. His judgments were swift as the divine, officials dared not deceive. When hearing lawsuits, he first taught loyalty, filial piety, kindness, benevolence, patience, caution, diligence, and frugality; he favored the near virtuous and distanced the far wicked, removed greed and suppressed violence. All was recorded with sincerity and detail. Yet he worried that the distant hundred li could not all know, so he chose outstanding virtuous elders to encourage and lead. Thus the spirit of contention gradually faded, until finally there were no lawsuits.

Poem:

Flying crows and immortal comrades praise virtuous governance,  
By the Guqin Hall, disputes cease utterly.  
Kindness tames wild pheasants and draws silkworms near,  
Virtue repels locusts and pests from the land.  
Great ambition aims to bring nourishing rain,  
At leisure I plant peach blossoms.  
The courtyard is empty and simple, the people have no lawsuits,  
Daylong the curtain hangs, shadows slant.

### Relief of Famine Transformation

Previously, in years of famine, the people had no means to pay rent. The county enforced the law strictly, causing many to flee. The Patriarch used a spiritual elixir to turn rubble into gold, secretly placing it in the county garden. One day, those who had not paid rent were summoned to the courtyard and reproved, then made to labor in the rear garden. The people dug the land and found gold, enabling them to pay taxes, and all were pacified. Refugees from neighboring lands, attracted by his virtue, came in great numbers, and the population grew.

Poem:

Heaven’s timing failed, grain withered and dried,  
Causing famine and failure to pay rent.  
Counties strictly enforced laws, pressing and forcing,  
Households fled in urgency and settled elsewhere.  
Secretly hiding gold treasure in garden plots,  
Feigning forced labor, compelling farmers to toil.  
Thus they gained wealth to pay taxes,  
Villagers took up plows and returned to fields.

### Epidemic Quelling Transformation

That year a great epidemic struck, killing seventeen or eighteen people. The Patriarch used the divine formula he had received to heal; wherever his talismans and incantations reached, people recovered immediately. Even the most severe illnesses were cured. Rumors spread that sick people from other counties came in thousands daily. He marked bamboo ten li outside the city, placed talisman water within it, instructing people to drink beneath the bamboo; all who drank it felt itching. The elderly and weak who could not come themselves had water drawn for them and also recovered. The people of Shu sang: “No theft among people, no deceit among officials, our lord saves lives, the sick are powerless.” Later, people from Jiangzuo also came to draw water at Jingyang. The Patriarch then enchanted a vessel with talisman water, placed it at the riverbank, and planted bamboo to mark the spot, so the sick could drink it and recover. This river is now called the Shu River, also known as the Brocade River, belonging to Ruizhou Ga’an.

Poem:

At the time the epidemic raged fiercely,  
Villagers spread word of the fierce sickness.  
Wishing to reveal the divine formula with sincere intent,  
He blessed the water to save all beings.  
Those with madness and fever were healed whole,  
Severe illnesses lightened their bodies.  
The Brocade River’s folk also sought rescue,  
To this day bamboo marks remain by the river.

### Abandoning Honor Transformation

Having served Jingyang for a long time, the Patriarch knew the Jin dynasty would fall into chaos, so he abandoned office and returned home. Jingyang County belonged to Hanzhou; after the Patriarch’s ascension, it was renamed Deyang, honoring his virtue and the people. The county seat moved westward, leaving the old site as a temple, now called Jingyang Temple. The people, moved by his virtue, could not bear to let him go, so they built a shrine, passed down portraits, and reverenced him as a deity. On the day of his departure, people wrapped provisions and sent him off, filling the fields; some traveled a thousand li before returning, others followed to his home, wishing to serve and never return. They built huts in the gaps of his courtyard, resembling a camp. Many changed their surnames to follow the Patriarch’s, thus the place was called the Xu Family Camp. Such was his lasting love for the people.

Poem:

Having achieved office and fame, what more to seek?  
Returning home to serve as the two recluse sages.  
Shrines and temples stand in many places,  
Wrapped provisions sent by elders and children on long roads.  
King Tai fled the barbarians to Qishi Market,  
Yu Shun resigned Yao to rise at Dengxu.  
His love reached all people without exception,  
They built huts and dwelt in the Xu camp.

### New Wutong Transformation

The Patriarch once rested at the Xiang Forest in Xinwu, when suddenly five young girls each came bearing a precious sword to offer. The Patriarch was surprised and accepted them. The place is now Wulin Temple. Later, they accompanied him to his residence, where he would strike swords daily for amusement, beyond anyone’s comprehension. The Patriarch recognized them as sword immortals, always treating them with respect, eventually gaining the use of the divine sword. After his ascension, he concealed himself beneath the planted wutong tree, hence called the Bridge Tree Immortal Children.

Poem:

Entering Xinwu, five children appeared,  
Each holding a treasure box presenting frost-sharp blades.  
Silent wisdom revealed their difference,  
Recognizing their spiritual power, he specially welcomed them.  
Commanding ghosts and spirits to enact decrees,  
Slaying snakes, dragons, and banishing demons.  
功 fulfilled, the Patriarch ascended heaven,  
The immortal maidens hid beneath the green wutong.

### Yellow Hall Transformation

Later, he traveled with Lord Hao to Songyang, hearing that in Jinling’s Danyang County, the Yellow Hall’s Lady Master Chen Mu possessed many daoist arts. They went to pay respects and inquired about the dao’s mysteries. Mu said: “You all were born with spiritual bones and immortal names in Heaven, yet the Filial and Fraternal King descended from Shangqing to transform and save the world, revealing filial teachings. He first descended to Lan Gong’s family in Qufu County, Yanzhou, saying: ‘In later Jin there will be an immortal Xu Xun to transmit my dao,’ leader of all perfected. He left the Golden Elixir Treasure Scripture, copper talisman, and iron token, entrusting Lan Gong to guard them awaiting the son, for many years. I also taught the Filial King’s methods, based on filial piety. Now you have come, I shall teach you.” They chose an auspicious day to ascend the altar and swear the oath, transmitting filial teachings with solemn warnings, presenting copper talisman, iron token, Golden Elixir Scripture, the Zhengyi method of severing evil, the Three-Five flying steps technique, and all secret stages to the Patriarch. The clear and strict Five Thunder methods were all taught by Mu.

Poem:

Visiting Chen Mu at Yellow Hall,  
Her teachings honored the Filial and Fraternal King.  
Incense first lit, the carriage wished to reveal,  
Before words were spoken, intentions matched.  
Copper talisman and iron token proclaimed the oath,  
The treasure book and golden elixir detailed and precise.  
On the chosen day ascending the altar to transmit,  
Jingyang’s fame long noted in the immortal land.

### Jade Register Transformation

Chen Mu turned to Lord Hao and said: “You once learned the divine formula from Master Xu; now the Filial King’s teaching is solely transmitted by Master Xu. You should return to your master. Moreover, the Jade Emperor’s original register places you as Chief Inspector of the Capital; Master Xu holds the high office of Great Bright Ambassador, overseeing the immortal registers and ranks. You govern the twelve constellations and their twelve countries; Master Xu manages the mysterious Yang fields of the constellations, overseeing the twelve divisions. From now on, Master Xu should be regarded as the chief.”

Poem:

It is said you once were Master Xu’s teacher,  
But the Jade Register’s immortal ranks do not agree.  
Though borrowing the divine formula to connect,  
Who knew the sacred offices have high and low?  
Lower registers govern fields in order,  
Upper stars entwine unevenly.  
Ranks and offices are vast and varied,  
Jingyang as chief—what doubt remains?

### Morning Truth Transformation

After bowing and thanking Lord Hao, the Patriarch resolved to visit Mu yearly. Mu sensed this and said: “Do not come; I will soon return to the imperial realm.” Taking a stalk of fragrant grass, she faced south and cast it, saying: “You shall return and recognize the spot where the grass falls to build my shrine; once a year in autumn is enough.” The Patriarch and Lord Hao returned, first seeking the grass’s landing place. Forty li south of his residence, they found it already grown thick. They built a shrine named Yellow Hall, also called Chongzhen Temple. Every year on the third day of mid-autumn they made pilgrimage.

Poem:

Resolving to visit yearly in homage,  
Bearing the master’s grace not easily lost.  
No matter the path, a thousand li walked,  
The immortal lord returns through five clouds.  
Casting grass to mark the sprouting place,  
Building images and shrines, planting peach trees.  
Year after year on mid-autumn’s third day,  
The sky fills with phoenix and crane songs.

### Resting Truth Transformation

The Patriarch visited the path of the flying grass and saw a clear pond, where he rested briefly, calling it Resting Truth. This is now Qingpi Village’s Resting Truth. He saw villagers preparing sacrifices to the gods, puzzled, saying: “If the offering is not proper, the gods will anger and bring disaster.” The Patriarch said: “What ghosts dare such mischief?” Staying overnight at an inn, he summoned wind and thunder to strike, uprooting trees. The next day he told the villagers: “The evil shrine is driven away; do not offer sacrifices.” Now the place has an abandoned shrine and no offerings.

Poem:

Returning along the flying grass path,  
Reaching Qingpi village to rest from toil.  
Suddenly seeing villagers preparing sacrifices,  
Yet evil spirits arise from their offerings.  
How could earth and wood harbor such ghosts?  
He summoned wind and thunder to utterly destroy.  
He warned the villagers to cease all offerings,  
Peace reigns, and clamor is no more.

### Spiritual Spring Transformation

The Patriarch saw many carrying water far on their backs. With his staff he pierced a dried-up pond in front of a shrine, causing a spring to gush forth, never drying even in drought. This is now the Purple Sun Clear Stone Well of Daze Village.

Poem:

Carrying water far is weary and painful,  
Villagers suffer from lack of spring water.  
With a single staff strike at the Five Mountains,  
A spring bursts forth, flowing clear and pure.  
Geng Gong was driven from his work,  
Pang Jian gathered copper to dig the well.  
How could it compare to the Patriarch’s wondrous act?  
Cool sweet liquid flows gently and endlessly.

### Dragon City Transformation

The next day, ascending the mountain peak, he pointed to a spring altar on the mountainside, where strange things were hidden, soon to become disasters. He established an altar to pacify it. Every year when paying respects to Chen Mu, they rest here, now called Dragon City Temple.

Poem:

By chance ascending the mountain’s highest peak,  
Suddenly seeing a spring bursting from the slope.  
Dark miasma thickened where evil was hidden,  
Knowing then a strange thing was concealed.  
If it should emerge, people would suffer,  
This day the ritual must transfer it away.  
Thus the altar was built to pacify,  
Its traces remain to this day.

### Pine Wall Transformation

Crossing the Little Shu River, now called Huanghu Pass, he arrived at a riverside shop owned by the Zhu family. Though poor, they welcomed him with great respect. The Patriarch playfully painted a pine on their wall and left. That day their business doubled. Later, floods broke the dikes, washing away shops, but the pine wall remained intact. Now called Songhu Market, the Zhu family built a temple on the site.

Poem:

Though poor, the Zhu family joyfully welcomed guests,  
The Patriarch’s visit was a destined meeting.  
He gladly sat and left immortal ink,  
Their home became a treasured relic.  
Since then the clouds and traces faded,  
But market profits greatly increased.  
When the river overflowed and dikes broke,  
The pine wall stood firm like a mountain’s protection.

### Yellow Dragon Transformation

The Patriarch once refined the divine elixir on Huanglong Mountain at Aicheng. The mountain was guarded by a flood dragon and spirits, who stirred floods to wash away the alchemical chamber. The Patriarch sent divine soldiers to capture it, nailing it to a stone wall. The stone with the dragon’s nail remains. The elixir was completed and offered at the Ge Xian Gong stone chamber on Mufu. He then went to Xiuchuan, loving its swift currents and firm taste, and sharpened the divine sword on a stone by the stream. Now at Meishan, a temple was built to commemorate his sacred deed, now called Jingyang Temple. He then crossed the water and ascended Xiufeng, now called Jingyang Mountain, where he built an altar at the peak to offer thanks to the Supreme Emperor and took the immortal elixir.

Poem:

Entering Huanglong to refine the elixir,  
The mountain stirred dragons and spirits causing floods.  
He quickly summoned fierce soldiers in golden armor,  
Chasing wild demons, nailing them to rocky peaks.  
Afterward, sharpening the treasure sword by the stream,  
The medicine completed, he built a jade altar on the ridge.  
The Patriarch offered thanks to Heaven’s truth,  
Took the elixir and rode the colorful phoenix.

### Xi’an Transformation

Lord Hao lived nearby; south of the stream was Haoxian Village and Haoxian Temple, his former residence. They built Lord Hao’s house. Passing through Xi’an County, now Fenning, the local earth god came to pay respects to the Patriarch, reporting that evil spirits in the land harmed the people but hid from the immortal lord. The Patriarch passed a small temple east of the county, where the temple gods surnamed Mao, five brothers, now called the Xieyou Temple. They reported a flood dragon harming the people, hiding at E Zhu. The Patriarch followed and met three old men at the Three Kings Temple, who pointed to the dragon hiding beneath the bridge, now called Fulong Bridge. The Patriarch stood by the bridge, brandishing his sword, scolding the dragon, which fled into the great river and hid in a deep pool, now called the Lower Dragon Cave. He summoned officials and soldiers to drive it out. The dragon fled upstream, was caught and slain, now called the Upper Dragon Mouth. The Patriarch was angry at the Xi’an earth god’s negligence, sealed its shrine gate, stopping the people’s offerings. The Fenning city god temple’s main gate remains closed; when opened, fires break out. Priests only enter from theatrical households, and few residents worship. The small temple remains. The Xieyou Temple offerings flourish and are efficacious.

Poem:

It is said the carriage passed Haoxian Village,  
Hearing that a flood dragon still dwells here.  
Three elders pointed to the bridge hiding it,  
Five brothers warned it fled.  
To protect the people, no seed left behind,  
Tracking and capturing to sever the root.  
The master scolded Xi’an’s god for neglect,  
Sealing the shrine gate to stop worship.

### Elixir Transformation

Returning to the county seat, the Patriarch said: “This place is a hub of water and land, bustling with people. Are there no worthy immortals among them? I will mix a few elixir pills with other medicines, letting people believe and buy them. Though many redeemed, none truly encountered the immortal.” The Patriarch sighed at how rare immortal talent is in the world.

Poem:

Hongdu is bustling with people,  
How could it lack worthy immortals?  
In the cauldron, I mixed a few pills,  
In the bag, mingled with thousands of medicines.  
I let disciples sell on the streets,  
Letting people pick at will.  
All the medicines sold, the pills remain,  
Yet not one has the immortal green.

### Hidden Stream Transformation

The Patriarch heard that a flood dragon troubled Xin Hao, so he wielded his sword to chase it away. The place he traveled became Dragon Spring Temple, renamed Immortal Wandering. The dragon fled into a stream cave, now called Hidden Stream. The Patriarch wrote large talismanic characters on a great stone and composed a dragon-pacifying text to seal it. The stone tablet remains, now a monk’s temple called Yan Zhen, with a nearby temple also called Yan Zhen, ten li west of Fengxin County.

Poem:

Hearing that Xin Hao had a poisonous flood dragon,  
Unseasonal monsters stirred waves and storms.  
The Patriarch wielded his sword to slay,  
The demon fled into the stream to hide.  
He set strong talismanic texts to restrain,  
Sealing the beast with precious seals.  
The clear stone tablet remains as record,  
For a thousand ages people honor his high dao.

### Haihun Transformation

At Haihun to the north lurked a giant serpent, making its lair in the mountain, exhaling clouds of gas. One day, within forty li, people and livestock were swallowed by its breath, none escaping. Boats on rivers and lakes capsized, causing great harm. The Patriarch heard and climbed the northern peak to inspect, now the site of Chiwu Temple, the Sun Meeting Immortal Peak. He saw the poisonous gas filling the sky. Moved by the people’s suffering, he gathered disciples to slay it.

Poem:

Poisonous gas spreads across the sky,  
A giant serpent at Haihun cuts off all homes.  
It makes lairs in the mountains, stirring winds,  
Exhaling clouds that darken the sun’s glow.  
Roads are blocked, beasts and people swallowed,  
Rivers and lakes bring disaster and capsized boats.  
The Patriarch climbed the ridge to survey,  
Disciples united to cast it down.

### Chiwu Transformation

Entering its domain, over three hundred residents came, knowing the Patriarch’s dao and magic, pleading earnestly for relief. The Patriarch said: “The cycles of Heaven and Earth bring this calamity; the people must endure this disaster. I have come to remove it; I vow not to live with this serpent.” After a while, disciples arrived and urged him to act. He planted his sword in the ground and silently prayed to Heaven. Suddenly, a flying crow passed, and a spring gushed forth. The Patriarch said: “It is time.” The place became the Hou Shi Temple, later renamed Chiwu Temple, now Shousheng and Guangfu. The Song dynasty Daoist Wan Zhongxing wrote a poem:

“Once a long serpent wielded toxic might,  
Jingyang awaited its destruction here.  
In the cave the immortal maiden gave orders,  
In Heaven the spiritual crow suddenly announced the time.  
The talisman flew angrily over the valley,  
The sword star descended, ghosts and spirits mourned.  
A thousand years later, will it rise or fall?  
Alas, the shadow功 is endless.”

Zhang Tianjue’s poem *Sword Thrust Spring* says:  
“The sword thrust suddenly formed a well beneath the rock,  
Waiting for the crow at midday to stir.  
The remnants of Haihun’s serpent now all gone,  
Yet the remaining blessings still guard the seven pacifications.”

Poem:

The long serpent blocked the marriage mist,  
Heaven’s cycles brought disaster to endure.  
The dao’s power summoned people to grievances,  
Who among the imperial folk would not grieve?  
How could such evil act with cruelty?  
Meeting our followers, it must be cut down.  
The sword thrust waits for the appointed time,  
The crow flies, the spring gushes as if urging.

### Snake Severing Transformation

Approaching the serpent’s lair, he brandished his sword and spread his aura. The serpent feared and entered its hole. He then flew talismans to summon the Haihun earth god to drive it out, but it could not escape. He summoned the Nanchang earth god to assist. The talisman fell east of the county, so a temple called Fulu was built, now called Taihe. The serpent emerged, its head over ten zhang high, eyes like torches, spewing poison to the sky. The villagers raised a clamor to help. The Patriarch called forth wind and thunder, commanding divine soldiers to capture it, immobilizing it. Lord Hao then flew and stepped on its head, striking it with his sword. The serpent bowed low, and disciples Shi Cen and Gan Zhan swung their swords to finish it.

Poem:

Flying talismans summoned earth gods to drive it,  
The serpent’s head soared over a hundred feet.  
Eyes flashed like fire and hung like electric mirrors,  
Smoke and mist spewed, darkening the clouds.  
Villagers clamored, lending force,  
The master called thunder to faithfully remove it.  
Lord Hao flew and stepped on its head,  
The serpent bowed low and was finally slain.

### Small Snake Transformation

From the serpent’s belly a small snake emerged, several zhang long. Gan wanted to slay it, but the Patriarch said: “It has not harmed yet; do not kill rashly.” The small snake fled six or seven li, but hearing the clamor, it returned to listen and looked back at its mother. Now there are places named Snake Son Harbor and Seven Li Listening. Disciples wished to pursue and kill it, but the Patriarch said: “If this snake harms the people five hundred years later, I will return to slay it. The pine and cypress in front of my altar will be the sign; when their branches sweep the altar and touch the ground, that will be the time.” He also foretold: “Between one thousand two hundred and forty years after my departure, eight hundred earth immortals will emerge within the five tombs of Yuzhang. Their masters come from Yuzhang, greatly spreading my teaching. A sandbar suddenly appeared in the river’s center, covering the sand well’s mouth; that is the sign.” This is recorded in the *Songsha Record*. Pan Qingyi’s poem *Watching Dragon Sand* says:

“Endless people of the five tombs,  
Closely watch the Songsha Record.  
Though Songsha may not yet be complete,  
Its spirit is already wondrous.  
Once the dragon stirred,  
Half the land was mulberry and hemp.  
The land bends with the river,  
Islands float in connected shapes.”  

If the small snake harms, those eight hundred will surely slay it. If it harms nothing, it should not be slain. The snake son entered the river. Jianchang County’s Snake Son Harbor is that place, with a temple on Haocheng Mountain, very efficacious. The Song dynasty titled it the Spiritually Obedient, Manifesting Response, Benefiting and Saving King, commonly called the Dragon Temple. After the great serpent died, its bones gathered to form an island, now called Dragon Bone Island.

Poem:

Though the snake son fled and the mother died,  
Hearing the clamor, it returned to the pit.  
How admirable that vipers can keep filial piety,  
So the master spared it and did not harm.  
If it returns to harm the nation in later times,  
True immortals will surely strike it down with thunder.  
Dragon sand swirls far in the river’s rush,  
It is the place where bones gathered in old days.

### Seven Pacifications Transformation

At Haihun’s site, the Patriarch left altars and wells, six in number, corresponding to the seven times of waiting. Their arrangement resembles the shape of the Dipper stars, intended to suppress future troubles. The Seven Pacifications are: Advancement Pacification, Imperial Tribute Pacification, Elixir Talisman Pacification, Huabiao Pacification, Ziyang Pacification, Huoyang Pacification, and Liuqi Pacification. Now many are temples, monasteries, or official residences. He went northwest of the county to a mountain spring, clear and cold, casting talismans into it to heal the people, as effective as the Shu River. It was named Cold Water Terrace. After the giant serpent was slain, its blood stained the sword, which was washed and stones cut to test its edge. Jianchang County has the Sword Grinding Pool and Sword Testing Stone. He told disciples: “Though the great serpent is dead, the flood dragon remains. It knows my intent to remove it and may wait for a chance to harm the city again. I return to the county.” Gan and Shi Cen accompanied him. In the sixth year of Yongjia.

Poem:

The giant serpent of Haihun is slain,  
Yet fears remain of lingering demons.  
Sharpening the sword, testing its edge on stone,  
Casting talismans into the spring to cure disease.  
The master pierced the righteous well to bring blessings,  
The people rely on the sacred altar beyond prayers.  
Where he traveled he built seven pacifications,  
Now temples stand, tracing his care.

### Charcoal Woman Transformation

The Patriarch’s daoist skills were renowned far and wide. Hundreds sought to become disciples, but he refused all. Then he transformed charcoal into a beautiful woman, scattering her among disciples at night as a test. The next morning, only ten remained uncorrupted, destined to ascend as high disciples in later times. From then on, wherever he traveled, slaying flood dragons and severing serpents, these followed him. Many others, ashamed, left. Today Jianchang County’s Xijin is called Charcoal Woman Market, with a temple named Miao Ming.

Poem:

The Patriarch’s daoist skill is unmatched,  
Hundreds came seeking discipleship.  
To pass on the immortal secret,  
He turned charcoal woman to test guests.  
All were lost in rouge and pleasure,  
Unaware smoke and coal stained their bodies.  
Each ashamed fled scattering,  
Only eleven remained true perfected.

### Horizontal Spring Transformation

The Patriarch returned to the county with Gan and Shi. While touring the city, a handsome youth about fifteen, dressed grandly, came to visit and introduced himself as surnamed Shen, courteous and diligent, then suddenly left. The Patriarch told disciples: “That was no human, but the spirit of an old flood dragon, come to test us. Though his form was fair, the stench of wind and fishy breath clung to him. I fooled him so we might root out his kind.” The dragon fled, transforming into a yellow ox, roaming the sandbanks of other counties. Now called Yellow Ox Great Island.

The Patriarch cut paper to transform a black ox, sending Shi Cen with a sword to wait. When the ox was drunk, Shi struck its thigh. The ox fled into a well south of the city, now called Horizontal Spring, also known as Flood Dragon Well.

Poem:

Who can deceive the Patriarch’s dao eye?  
The flood dragon dared to spy and test.  
He spoke and joked, but the stench remained,  
Fishy breath and foul smell could not be moved.  
Suddenly transformed, the beast slept soundly,  
Then the divine ox drained its strength.  
A sword stroke wounded its left thigh,  
Into Horizontal Spring it fled, to be pursued.

### Pursuing the Flood Dragon Transformation

The Patriarch sent talisman messengers to track it, learning it reached Changsha, where it transformed into a man in the Jia Yi Well, entering the home of official Jia Yushi. The flood dragon had admired Jia’s daughter’s beauty, transforming into a youth to court her. Jia greatly loved his talent and promised his daughter in marriage. He bribed Jia’s trusted men, who praised the youth. They married and had two sons. Each spring and summer, the youth would leave alone, traveling rivers and lakes like a merchant, returning in autumn with a heavy load of giant oysters, treasures gained from boats overturned by floods. That autumn he returned empty-handed, telling Jia that thieves had robbed the goods and he was injured in the left thigh. Jia’s family lamented and sought healing.

Poem:

The flood dragon fled into Horizontal Spring,  
Admiring Jia’s family in Changsha.  
Born of long affection, two sons appeared,  
This green union lasted but a few years.  
Each trip brought treasures home,  
Yet the river trapped him in a merchant’s boat.  
The sword wounded his leg, wounds unhealed,  
He claimed thieves stole his goods, returning empty.

### Zhao Pool Transformation

The Patriarch became a healer and visited Jia. Jia was pleased and summoned his son-in-law for treatment. The flood dragon sensed this and feared to appear. Jia summoned him himself. The Patriarch came to the hall, shouted sternly: “Flood dragons harm many; I have tracked you here and will not allow escape. Come out at once!” The flood dragon, cornered, revealed its true form beneath the hall, and was slain by officials. The Patriarch used sacred water to cure the two sons, who were also small flood dragons, and they too were slain. Jia’s daughter nearly transformed, but her parents pleaded, and the Patriarch gave her a talisman to prevent change. The Patriarch warned Jia: “The flood dragon’s lair is under your house, and the water is deep and turbulent. You must move quickly to avoid disaster.” Jia’s family fled in fear to high ground. Soon the land sank into a deep, unfathomable pool, now called Zhao Pool in Changsha.

Poem:

The master brought medicine to Hunan,  
Jia Yu heard and invited him to speak.  
The flood dragon feared and dared not appear,  
Jia summoned him, the master came to the hall.  
With stern voice he ordered the flood dragon out,  
It revealed its form and was slain by officials.  
The sons were cured with sacred water,  
The demon fled to high ground, soon the land sank deep.

### Dragon Pacification Transformation

Returning to Yuzhang, the flood dragon’s remnants were still strong, fearing the Patriarch’s slaying, uneasy in heart. They transformed into humans, roaming cities, seeking disciples, falsely claiming: “My family is from Chang’an, long practicing virtue. I have heard of Master Xu’s divine sword and wish to learn its功.” Disciples told them: “Our master’s divine sword can split Heaven and Earth, cleave stars, reverse rivers; evil cannot withstand it. Is there anything it cannot harm?” They joked: “Only winter melon and gourd.” The flood dragon believed this and transformed all its followers into gourds and melons, floating with vines on the river, intending to flow out of the territory.

The Patriarch rose early, sensing the evil miasma thickening, looked at the river, saw the flood dragon’s transformations, and gave his sword to Shi Cen to walk on water and sever them. The followers were all cut down, the river’s color changed. The Patriarch said: “This is the flood dragon’s lair; if not sealed, it will rise again to harm the people.” He commanded ghosts and spirits at the south well of Yacheng to cast an iron pillar, extending several feet outside the well, with eight chains binding the earth’s veins. The iron pillar remains at Yan Zhen Palace. He declared: “If the iron pillar bows, the demon will revive and I will return. If it stands straight, the demon is forever banished.” Thus the water demon was blocked, the city safe. He also foresaw future treacheries, inscribed on the iron pillar a prophecy: “When earth triumphs and hearts are good, no evil shall arise; even if conspiracies rise, they will never succeed.” Such was the Patriarch’s concern for future generations.

Poem:

Flood dragons in rivers and lakes cause great worry,  
Asked about the sword’s功 to avoid destruction.  
The snowy blade can cleave five stones,  
The frost edge surely cuts gourds and melons.  
They shape-shifted to drift with the current,  
But walking on water, they were swiftly cut down.  
The master saw many dens of flood dragons,  
And left iron pillars to guard Hongdu.

*Compiled by Shi Cen, the Valiant and Enlightened Perfected of the Western Mountain*

### Paper Money Transformation

When seeking the flying grass, the Patriarch crossed the Little Shu River, paying the boatman two hundred coins. The boatman repeatedly asked for more, eventually demanding a thousand. The Patriarch agreed. Upon landing, the boatman returned the money, but only two rings remained; the rest were paper money. Surprised, the Patriarch realized he was a divine being. To this day, immortal carriages pay only two coins to boatmen, never daring to ask more.

Poem:

Seeking flying grass, searching everywhere,  
The Shu River calls for crossing beneath green willows.  
Waves calm, banks wide, many boats rush,  
Winds gentle, guests all admire.  
Having paid the Patriarch two coins,  
Why seek a thousand?  
Not by paper money’s divine transformation,  
Could boatmen endure to this day.

### Medicine Lake Transformation

In Xinjiang County’s Drought Lake, leeches were abundant. The Patriarch cast a single medicine pellet, and the leeches were forever gone. The lake is still called Medicine Lake.

Poem:

Lake light gleams under the clear sky,  
Leeches and locusts breed in the grass.  
A single medicine pellet thrown in,  
All leeches and insects perish.  
Waves greet the bright moon, reeds white,  
Winds face the setting sun, banks rosy.  
Looking afar, clouds and waves bear no poison,  
The immortal stirs freely east and west.

### Pine Lake Transformation

At Songhu Market’s Miaodong, the Patriarch once rested briefly. To this day, no mosquitoes enter the family.

Poem:

Songhu Market’s inn named Orchid and Orchid,  
The inn invites guests with open hearts.  
Merchants now all halt their horses,  
The Patriarch once held the phoenix reins.  
No mosquitoes disturb beds and fields,  
Butterflies dream peacefully on pillows.  
The post road’s crows hasten dusk,  
Carriages and riders loosen their saddles.

### Suo Cave Transformation

At Fengcheng County’s Miaozhen Cave, a flood dragon entered, wedged by a Miaomu stake, still preserved.

Poem:

Ancient trees and vines lock the stone gate,  
Mountains deep and remote, fog often dim.  
No auspicious cranes come to rest,  
Rumors say flood dragons gather here.  
Flood torrents rush through fields and hills,  
Daily worrying over poisonous flood dragons harming villages.  
The Patriarch sealed the Miaozhen Cave,  
The stake remains many years on.

### Immortal Pigeon Transformation

In the second year of Emperor Mingdi’s Taining era, General Wang Dun, styled Chuzhong, raised troops to attack the capital. The Patriarch and Lord Hao went to petition him to desist. Guo Pu was in the camp and accompanied them. Chuzhong welcomed them to drink and asked: “I dreamed of a tree breaking the sky; what do you think?” The Patriarch said: “Not a good omen.” Lord Hao said: “The tree breaking the sky means disaster; you should not act rashly.” Chuzhong’s expression changed; he ordered Guo Pu to divine. Guo said: “No success.” Chuzhong was displeased and asked: “How long will I live?” Guo said: “If you rebel, disaster will come soon; if you return to Wuchang, your life is uncertain.” Chuzhong angrily asked: “How long will you live?” Guo said: “Your life ends today at noon.” Chuzhong enraged, ordered Guo Pu’s arrest and execution.

The *Record of Immortals* says: Guo Pu had already prepared his family for his death at the execution site. The sentence was to be carried out by the two pines by the river. Three days later, people in Nanzhou saw Guo Pu’s clothes and spoke with acquaintances. Chuzhong did not believe it, opened the coffin, and found no body—he had transcended. He became an immortal elder of the water realm. The Patriarch raised a cup, cast it, transforming into a white pigeon flying around the beams. Chuzhong looked up and lost sight of the two lords; he was defeated. Chuzhong’s army was routed; he died in rage, suffering the punishment of dismemberment.

Poem:

Though Jin’s dynasty fell, Heaven upheld it,  
Rebels defied the capital’s sacred seat.  
Seeking righteous men to fulfill dreams,  
Few knew the villain’s secret plot.  
Meeting Wang Dun by chance,  
Guo Pu gave his life.  
Casting the cup, transforming to pigeon,  
All eyes watched Xu and Hao vanish.

### Iron Boat Transformation

The Patriarch and Lord Hao returned to Jinling, wishing to rent a boat to Yuzhang. The boat owner said no one could pilot it. The Patriarch said: “Close your eyes and sit still; I will pilot.” He summoned two dragons to carry the boat, passing Chiyang, leaving a seal on the western shore cliff to ward off water monsters. The seal remains. The boat rose into the air, swiftly passing Lushan’s peak to Zixiao Peak’s Jinque Cave. The Patriarch and Lord Hao wished to tour the cave, but the boat’s prow struck treetops, making noise. The boatman could not endure and secretly peered. The dragons left the boat on a high ridge, broke the mast in a deep ravine. The mast turned to iron and stone, now called Stone Peak, with the broken mast in the ravine, called Broken Stone.

The Patriarch said to the boatman: “If you do not obey, where will you go?” The boatman begged for salvation. The Patriarch taught him to take elixirs and spiritual herbs, enabling him to avoid food and death, hiding in the mountain. Later, the governor of Yicheng sent people to visit Lushan’s wonders. At Zixiao Peak, they saw a boat and many cranes with red scales, a man riding a white horse, two youths shouting heard hundreds of steps away—suspected to be the boatmen. The Patriarch and Lord Hao each rode a dragon, dividing water and land to return, meeting at the Northern Ridge’s Tianbao Cave.

Poem:

Jinling is far from Yuzhang,  
No one to pilot the boat.  
Secretly summoned two dragons to carry it,  
Riding a thousand li, soaring aloft.  
Suddenly trees rustled, revealing the silver sea,  
Bringing the boat to Zixiao’s purple sky.  
The boatmen begged the master for aid,  
He taught them to avoid food with spiritual herbs.

### Poyun and Xunyang Transformation

The Patriarch feared flood dragons scattered into Poyang and Xunyang commanderies might return, so he traveled the rivers and lakes mouth to exterminate them. At Yaoshan’s summit were three flood dragon lakes, their holes connected to the Yangxin region. The Patriarch slew the flood dragons, establishing the Yuyang Pacification to seal them. Northwest below the cliff was the Kaihua Pacification. Also the Taicheng Pacification, beside a great lake, deep and unfathomable, full of flood dragon aunts. The Patriarch exterminated all but one flood dragon son who fled; he set this pacification to block it. He cast iron talismans to seal Poyang Lake’s mouth, blocking its entrance. Now at Hukou County’s Shangzhong Stone in the river. He cast iron covers over Luling’s Yuan Pool, controlling its lairs, sealing with iron talismans. Now called Feifu Ridge, with the Chongzhen Temple. A sword remains there, about one chi long, resembling jade or copper, unrecognized by anyone. The next year, the seventh year of Yongjia, he traveled to Changsha, then to Shaoyang. The following year, he went to Bang and Heng counties, wherever he went the people sincerely had poisons and harms removed. Returning to Yuzhang, he established over seventy pacifications to guard counties and prevent disasters.

Poem:

Flood dragons scattered into Poyang and Xunyang,  
Fearing future harm, he sought to exterminate.  
Yangxin’s lakes with holes reaching far,  
At Yaoshan’s peak, deep and mysterious.  
Talismans sealed the flood dragon’s paths,  
Iron covers blocked their lairs.  
Afterward, the master toured Jing and Guang,  
Leaving swords to guard the deep pools.

### Guangde Transformation

The Patriarch spread his influence widely across Jiangzuo and Hunan’s north and south borders, establishing temples, offices, and pacifications countless as stars, scattered among mountains, forests, lakes, and rivers, in strange and wondrous places, such as the Sword Grinding Pool beside Dragon Sand, still not obscured.

Poem:

Evil disasters must be removed,  
The Patriarch traveled all rivers and lakes.  
功 established over three thousand places,  
Immortal governance formed over seventy.  
To let the common people rest in peace,  
Counties and towns all dwell safely.  
Dragon Sand still holds traces,  
Sword Grinding Pool clear as a jade pot.

### Flower Carriage Transformation

At Jing’an County lived Liu Immortal Maiden, named Yizhen, aged hundreds but looking like a child. Chen Mu often praised her. The Patriarch visited but she had already ascended. He left a precious wooden flower carriage, which floated by wind for three days before descending. The temple was named Flower Carriage Temple, still called Bingxia Temple.

Poem:

Liu’s cultivation was vast,  
Chen Mu often praised her.  
Her spirit refined and pure, age like a crane,  
Her form lofty and cold like ice.  
When the Patriarch came to pay respects,  
The immortal lady had already ascended.  
Only the precious wooden flower carriage remains,  
The temple stands at Bingxia, a world’s reliance.

### Returning to Seclusion Transformation

The Patriarch returned to his old retreat, daily lecturing disciples on true meaning. For decades he no longer concerned himself with worldly affairs, only refining the supreme dao. He composed the *Song of Drunken Thought of Immortals* and the *Eight Treasures Instructions*: loyalty, filial piety, integrity, caution, generosity, abundance, tolerance, and patience. Loyalty means no deceit; filial piety means no rebellion; integrity means no greed; caution means no mistakes. Cultivating oneself thus can form virtue. Generosity gains followers; abundance brings surplus; tolerance accepts all; patience brings peace. Treating others thus cleanses resentment and blame. His disciples were diligent in movement and stillness, always mindful, guarding their solitude, with the Three Officials examining their hearts. The village was transformed, all turning good and distancing sin, filial piety and brotherly love flourishing. In daily life, they responded to circumstances without abnormality, but wherever they dwelled cranes sang and flew, auspicious clouds circled. Since the Eastern Jin’s chaos and frequent disturbances in Jiangzuo, in a hundred li around the Patriarch’s residence no thieves entered; the people lived in peace and good harvests, unknown why.

Poem:

Traveling rivers and lakes of Shu and Han,  
Returning home to lecture much.  
Guiding the people with treasured instructions,  
Refining the supreme dao, composing immortal songs.  
Auspicious clouds swirl over humble huts,  
Mystic cranes soar among trees.  
Eastern Jin’s chaos often disturbed,  
Yet within a hundred li, the master lived in peace.

### Gold and Jade Transformation

The Patriarch secluded in the Western Mountain. A magician tried to turn copper and iron to gold, stone to jade, to sell his method. The Patriarch asked: “Will this not cause change?” The magician said: “In five hundred years it will revert.” The Patriarch said: “That will mislead later people.” He refused.

Poem:

Hidden quietly in mountain woods,  
Magicians sought him with strange arts.  
Turning stones to jade, copper to gold,  
Would greed arise from such craft?  
How could wealth harm the dao heart?  
The Patriarch firmly refused,  
Fearing future regret for people.

### Elixir Edict Transformation

In the second year of Emperor Xiaowu’s Ningkang era, aged one hundred thirty-six, on the first day of the eighth month, clouds descended from Heaven. Two immortals arrived with a grand retinue, descending to the Patriarch’s courtyard. The Patriarch bowed to welcome. The two immortals said: “By the Jade Emperor’s command, we grant you an edict. You, the studying immortal youth Xu Xun, in many kalpas before, accumulated功 and perfected the dao, diligently mastering all methods and gates. You saved disasters, lifted suffering, removed harm and banished demons,功 benefiting living beings, your name high in the jade register, revered by perfected ones. You are to be appointed Great Bright Ambassador of the Nine Provinces, bestowed purple feathered robes, jade banners and precious scepters, elixir ointments and golden elixirs, each a dose. The edict is to be carried out.” The Patriarch bowed twice, ascended steps to receive the edict. One immortal said: “I am Jade True Senior Lord Cui Ziwen.” The other: “I am Primordial True Great Official Xiaqiu Zhong.” They bowed and sat, telling the date of ascension, then rode the cloud carriage and departed.

Poem:

The autumn air is crisp, the sky clear,  
Nine Heavens’ immortal retinue descends to the jade capital.  
The Patriarch humbly feels his功 too short,  
The imperial sage knows the dao is complete.  
Red banners and precious scepters praise great virtue,  
Elixir ointments and pills preserve longevity.  
One true immortal tells the ascension day,  
Phoenix and cranes gather to escort.

### Teaching Transmission Transformation

The Patriarch summoned disciples and village elders, instructing them on the time of departure. From then on, they gathered daily at his residence, setting feasts and drinks, cherishing farewells, teaching to do good and establish功 to attain immortality. He authored books such as *Ling Jianzi*. He also composed ten poems of five characters and two rhymes for eleven disciples, encouraging sincerity as a legacy. For those who did not ascend, he transmitted the great功 and the Ruyi elixir formula, the same as Ding Yi’s formula. The secret requires choosing an auspicious day, fasting, setting up rites with eighteen divine medicines, then writing talismans, expelling tastes, reciting incantations, and refining. It cures many diseases immediately.

Poem:

The immortal carriage’s ascension is set,  
Feasts and gatherings held with village elders.  
Joyfully drinking with old and young,  
Teachers and students compose poems.  
Medicine and scriptures save with great grace,  
Teachings passed down with compassion.  
Though reluctant to part, sincere encouragement,  
Doing good and功 is the dao’s foundation.

### Ascension Transformation

On the full moon day of the eighth month, a grand fasting assembly was held, summoning all villagers, young and old. At noon, music was heard afar, auspicious clouds filled the sky, soon arriving at the assembly place. Feathered canopies and dragon carriages came with officials and guards, immortal children and colorful maidens leading the way, surrounded by red clouds and purple mist. The two edict messengers arrived again. The Patriarch descended steps to welcome them. The two immortals repeated the edict: “You, studying immortal youth Xu Xun, have shed your past life’s sins of greed, killing, hiding, and neglecting ancestors. Your present life’s incantations, talisman water, healing, and punishment of evil have been recorded by the Mountain Fate Officer, who transmitted the Golden Elixir below, sealing debts and forms, returning your body and family’s hundred blessings to the Three Heavens. You must hasten to obey the heavenly orders, avoiding defilement, soaring through the air, guarded by the Left Great Power Heavenly Ding and the Flowing Golden Fire Bell, scattering and moving swiftly. Your distant ancestors are sealed: your great-grandfather Mei, the Most High Jade True Official; your father Su, the Immortal Officer of the Middle Peak; your residence granted the Left Office of the Immortal Bureau. Jade True Senior Lord said: ‘Though your disciples are many, only six may ascend together; the rest have their own days.’ He bowed and ascended the dragon carriage. Chen Xun, Shi Cen, Zhou Guang, Zeng Heng, Huang Renlan, his father’s clan attendants, Yu Lie, and his mother’s attendants ascended with him. Forty-two immortals ascended simultaneously; even chickens and dogs followed flying. Villagers clung and wailed, unwilling to part. The Patriarch said: ‘The paths of immortals and mortals differ; sorrow and fear are natural. Uphold filial piety and reverence Heaven and Earth—how could you lack reward?’ He left a cultivation bell and a stone box, saying: ‘As the world changes, these will be tokens for future times.’ The immortal retinue rose, and after a while, a medicine mortar, a cart wheel, and a birdcage fell to the southeast of the residence, now Chongyuan Temple. Several rats fell but did not die, as if having eaten immortal medicine. Later, some saw these as auspicious signs. The immortal carriage soared beyond sight, only clouds and fragrant airs filled the valleys for a month.

Poem:

The elixir edict sealed in purple clay,  
Feathered canopies and fragrant carriages ride jade dragons.  
Villagers fast and gather, music fills the clouds,  
Immortal officers honored, ancestor’s glory revealed.  
Homes uprooted, all return to Heaven,  
Leaving tokens to mark their trace.

### Brocade Curtain Transformation

Returning from Jingyang, the Patriarch presented Sichuan brocade as a token of transmission to Chen Mu, who made it into temple curtains. Suddenly they flew around the old residence, then ascended into the clouds. Later a temple was built, named the Traveling Curtain.

Poem:

Chen Mu’s great grace is no surprise,  
The Patriarch’s brocade gift faithfully given.  
Too humble for mere bedding,  
Fit for the high perfected as temple curtains.  
After ascending and leaving the world,  
Only the sacred object floats in the air.  
Dancing all day among the clouds,  
Then taken back by the heavenly spirits.

### Resting Wutong Transformation

Wang Changshi’s son Shuo welcomed the Patriarch to the western pavilion. After some time, the Patriarch said: “I see you can transmit my arts.” Secretly he taught him immortal formulas and said: “This place of mountain and river is beautiful, with a spiritual spring flowing south of the dao, facing a grotto, overlooking the Yuan River. It is suitable for a daoist institute.” Shuo agreed. The Patriarch wrote a pacification talisman on the wall and departed. At that time, the Patriarch and Guo Pu sought the perfect place, arriving at Bingwu Mountain in Yichun. On the day of ascension, clouds passed overhead, sending two blue-clad messengers to inform Shuo of the Jade Emperor’s summons. Shuo and family bowed and prayed. The Patriarch said: “Your immortal bones are not yet full, but you may extend your life.” He gave Shuo a stalk of immortal grass, saying: “This grass tastes strange; plant it here and long use will grant longevity. Sweet nourishes flesh, bitter nourishes qi, salty nourishes bones, slippery nourishes skin, sour nourishes sinews. Take it with bitter wine, it will surely work.” Saying this, he departed. Since then, the Wang family followed his instructions, each living over a hundred years.

Poem:

Seeking truth long ago at Bingwu,  
Wang’s son welcomed him to a grand residence.  
Beautiful mountains and rivers suit the dao institute,  
Talented people praised in heavenly books.  
Now departing the world for the elixir edict,  
The cloud carriage rests above.  
Entrusting immortal grass for planting and nourishment,  
Your family all lives beyond a hundred years.

### Revered Shrine Transformation

After the Patriarch’s ascension, villagers and his clan’s descendants Jian built a shrine, inscribing one hundred twenty poems on bamboo slips, stored in a great box for people to seek. It was called the Holy Sign. The bell, box, and medicine mortar were stored in the shrine. Later it became a temple, named Brocade Temple. The Shu
