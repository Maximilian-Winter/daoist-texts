# Record of the Words of the Perfected of Jin

The Master said: Since the opening and unfolding of Heaven and Earth, up to this very day, humanity has sunk deep into confusion, with no end in sight. Yet now, at this very moment, the divine immortals emerge into the world, and the great Dao is about to flourish. Though all belong to one celestial people beneath the same sky, alas, the wise and the foolish are not equal. The wise turn toward the Dao and live; the foolish turn away and die. A pure heart and tranquil mind lead to the path of Heaven; a wild heart and chaotic mind open the gates of Hell. I ask you all: is it better to ascend to Heaven or to enter Hell? Though the Dao is revered and virtue esteemed, is this a matter for fools to debate? Were it not for the Dao’s rise in this age, how could the pure and secret heavenly mysteries leak into the world, to be grasped by the enlightened and superior?

The Master said: For one to cultivate, first one must recognize and grasp the ancestral root of nature and life, then cultivate the true to preserve life. Cultivation begins with preserving the three, embracing the primordial, and guarding the one. Preserving the three means the essence, qi, and spirit—the true three treasures. Embracing the primordial means holding fast to the original yang true qi. Guarding the one means guarding the one spiritual spirit. The spirit originally dwells in the heart, which belongs to the southern fire of Bing and Ding. Within the heart lies nature, which is yang. The kidneys generate the original yang true qi, which belongs to the northern water of Ren and Gui. Water is life, and life belongs to yin. Thus, the nature and life just described are clear in their origin. From ancient times to today, many do not recognize nature and life; today they are made manifest in the world.

The Master said: Learning the Dao originally has three parts. First, one’s single mind dwells in thought, solely within the immortal cavern of the lower elixir field; do not let the heart or mind scatter or stray. Embrace the primordial yang true qi, and that is longevity—the essence of the true Dao. This is the path of death’s exit and life’s entrance, the yin-yang alchemical immortal furnace. Within this elixir field, with a clear heart and settled will, dim and silent, continuous without break, carefully guarding for three to five years, naturally within the alchemical cauldron, the two qi mingle and warm to form a blackness. Creation becomes void, the numinous embryo of the immortal is formed; the spirit within the heart becomes numinous, leaping with joy, singing and dancing by itself. Generally, when spirit obtains qi’s numinosity, and qi obtains spirit’s clarity, as the Yin Consonant Classic says: “Holy merit is born here, divine brightness emerges here.” Qi is the mother of spirit; spirit is the child of qi. Always let mother and child guard each other without separation, and naturally over time spirit settles, and the immortal Dao is complete. Second, once spirit is settled and qi harmonized, then let go of the four elements; do not grasp or hold, but calmly cultivate; Dao qi will be natural, pure, and clear. The spirit then ascends to the upper palace, forever present, never looking back. Third, once spirit is settled and black qi harmonized, one should surpass the years of Heaven. Let go with openness, freely wandering without care, idle and at ease—this is the attainment of the boundless great Dao. When purity reaches its end, on some future day when merit is complete and practice fulfilled, the Jade Emperor will issue the summons; one will become a person without hindrance, living long and joyfully.

The Master said: Those who learn the Dao and cultivate, yet find their living spirit unstable, the root cause is that their功夫 (practice) is not complete. Regardless of years, one must still embrace and hold fast. The Perfected Lü said: Do not say the great Dao is hard to obtain; it is simply that功夫 (practice) has not reached its end.

The Master said: If cultivation is careless,功 (merit) is not diligent and spirit is not clear. Persevere long without failing true practice; the heart does not labor and the will is not wild; essence is not depleted and spirit does not flee.

The Master said: Alas, I see people in the world seeking teachers and the Dao, yet unwilling to show reverence, only boasting they can surpass all. When it comes to cultivation, they refuse to be diligent, cautious, and patient, relying only on words, utterly lacking true功 (practice). Nor do they truly cultivate to see the poor or save those in distress. Such faults in功 (merit) and失行 (failure in practice) even harm hidden virtue, violating the Dao. Such people, desiring to become immortals and prove the Dao, are very far from it indeed. Now I briefly speak of the causes of Dao’s fruits: Heaven only supports true功 (merit) and true practice, like those of great virtue and goodness, who can move Heaven and Earth. The scripture says: “Sovereign Heaven has no partiality; only virtue is its support.” If one desires true功 (merit), one must have a clear heart and settled will, sharpen the spirit, act without movement or effort, truly pure and truly clean, embrace the primordial and guard the one, preserve spirit and firm qi—that is true功 (merit). If one desires true practice, one must cultivate and accumulate virtue, aid the poor and relieve suffering, always harbor a heart to save those in trouble, or transform and guide good people into Dao cultivation. What one does puts others before oneself, without selfishness toward all things—that is true practice.

The Master said: If one cultivates to nourish life, first one must accumulate deeds and功 (merit).功 (merit) without practice, the fruit of the Dao is hard to achieve;功 (merit) and practice both fulfilled—this is called the Perfected.

The Master said: I speak to those within the teaching: one must greatly awaken to nature and principle, deeply explore the subtle Dao, with the will fixed on cultivation and learning immortality. The Scripture of Western Ascension says: “Remove defilements and stop thoughts; purify the heart and guard the one. When all defilements are removed, all affairs complete—that is the essence of our Dao.” This is the incomparable subtlety within subtlety. Whenever there is talk of the Dao, take care to nurture the treasure within the body, exhort people toward Heaven’s Dao, follow Heaven’s principle, and never slander Heaven or revile Earth. If like Zhang Yuanzi, who speaks mad words and returns to talk of divine matters, this is indeed a person who has attained the Dao. But for now, be tolerant and do not fault them.

The Master said: Those who learn the Dao must strictly keep the body pure and quiet, must not kill living beings, drink wine, eat meat, break precepts, or violate chastity. Always seek to embrace all things, be hard on oneself and generous to others, abandon and guard against anger, strangeness, and greed, constantly practice patience, humility, and frugality. When seeing others in trouble, act with a heart to relieve suffering; when seeing others poor and lacking, be sure to aid them fully. Favor others before oneself, treat people with humility, high or low, repay kindness for enmity. Do not see others’ faults, do not speak of others’ wrongs, quietly accumulate hidden virtue, seek no one’s knowledge, only hope Heaven will observe—this is the Daoist way.

The Master said: The great Dao has no fixed form, subtle and unfathomable. The holy body uses it daily; common people use it daily but do not know it. Turning away from the Dao loses the true; stirring it awakens the path of death. Yet people do not know that being in the Dao is like fish in water. Fish without water dies; people without the Dao perish.

The Master said: Moreover, the scriptures speak with hidden and profound meaning, ultimately difficult to understand. Now I only use worldly words to open the confused and point to awakening. If some do not understand, seek instruction from descendants in later generations. If one can understand the meaning and cultivate, then permit transmission to disciples, preserve life and cultivate the true, accumulate blessings to the ends of the earth, save people from illness and suffering—that is great practice. If one receives these words, then the nine ancestors’ sins are erased, and parents gain blessing. My wishful heart is to universally save from sickness, calamity, and the difficulties of life and death. If these words deceive people, they will forever enter the dark mountains for ten thousand kalpas.

**Verse:**  
To learn the Dao one must be an iron man,  
Cutting body and mind apart.  
With one bite sever ignorance,  
No longer pondering before or after.

# The Secret Method of the Patriarch of Chongyang for Cultivating Immortality and Perfecting Nature

The Perfected of Quanzhen is the pure emptiness of the great Dao, the gateway of effortless grace, the pure and upright family tradition—this is the living work of Chongyang. Those who cultivate immortality and study the Dao, be cautious not to wildly wander into Chan meditation, nor vainly ask about the Dao. In groups, guard your speech and accumulate true功 (practice); when alone, guard your heart and accumulate deeds. Do not let small faults remain unremoved; do not say minor acts are unworthy of accumulation. Lock the restless monkey mind tight, firmly capture the wild horse will. Disperse the three reversals and the spirit is peaceful; eliminate the six thieves and the will is settled. Slowly withdraw and add water and fire; gently regulate breath and true功 (practice). Pure, quiet, and lowly; humble, gentle, and soft, refine the heart; respectful to others and beneficial. Examine and break through this walking corpse, remove the bones of all things. Alas, everyone debates with sharp tongues, each strong and eager to win. Ignorant fire blazes large and is honored; the mountain of self and other is high and alone is right. Among crowds, do not seek the lowest place; in noisy places, do not seek quiet. Desiring to dwell there, the spirit becomes wild; moving about, the mind is confused. There is yet another kind who lives by begging for food, saying this is true cultivation. Such are lazy low ghosts, foolish and unawakened. Foolish and senseless without cause—better to hear early how to refine the stubborn heart, discard falsehood and cultivate the true to perfect nature. If one clings to wisdom and nature but is all confused, if one fixates on the lamp of the heart but it suddenly darkens, stingy and mean, how can the great Dao be achieved? Cruel and vicious, how can one awaken to the profound truth? Jealous of the wise and envious of the capable, inviting faults; greedy for life and afraid of death, creating sin. Writing talismans and selling arts to deceive people; seeking pleasure and curing illness for bribes. Mad thieves of the Dao, noisy harms to the crowd. Not understanding the subtle secret, wandering wildly, mind and will lost and madly rushing. Receiving offerings from the Ten Directions’ good believers, yet hard to consume. If one carefully cultivates and perfects the true heart, slight negligence leads to sinking into hell. When meeting a true master, strive to seek the subtle secret; do not allow fools to know, only require each to awaken themselves. No need for the功 (practice) of shaking sinews or twisting marrow, nor the confusion of fighting and gathering. Only know the beginning of non-action, self-aware spirit and qi harmonized, naturally the alchemical furnace and joyful completion. Manifest the numinous sand and shine brightly, illuminate the clear path and radiant spirit light, see the ancestors of Dao and virtue, recognize the source of ease and leisure—this is the wondrous gate of nature and life, the mold for transcending gods and immortals. Everyone who penetrates this mystery attains longevity and long vision. This is not deceiving words to mislead, nor evil arts to entice. I earnestly tell the high scholars of Quanzhen, and advise the confused in the world: each must awaken to avoid harmful wind words, all ascend together to the orthodox teaching. Now I speak of the beginnings of cultivation, able to sever the doubts of drought and confusion. I hope all leave the mundane to ascend to the true, sever dust one by one and attain the Dao. May all sentient beings ascend the immortal palaces.

# Answers to Master Ma’s Fourteen Questions

**First Question:** How is it that the thought-spirit meets the dragon and tiger in a place beyond measure?  
**Answer:** That place is all emptiness and stillness.

**Second Question:** How is the mysterious female gate called the root of Heaven and Earth?  
**Answer:** The mysterious is the father’s essence; the female is the mother’s blood. Originally each is eight taels, combined as one jin; one point of primordial yang true qi is the original root.

**Third Question:** How is it to return life and root on the quiet day?  
**Answer:** Simply keep the heart from chasing things, not stained or attached; heart settled and will not scatter, spirit not dimmed—that is returning to the root. Without this, one cannot return to the root.

**Fourth Question:** How to see nature?  
**Answer:** Simply have no heart and no thought, not attached to anything, clear and deep, inside and outside without affairs—that is seeing nature.

**Fifth Question:** How is it to respond to things without dimming?  
**Answer:** Though ears hear, eyes see, mouth speaks, as long as the heart is not attached.

**Sixth Question:** How are the Heavenly Gate and Earthly Axis, and how to keep them guarded?  
**Answer:** The Heavenly Gate and Earthly Axis are also the two words spirit and qi. As long as not attached or stained, heart settled is black and still. If the heart moves, qi scatters; if the heart does not move, mother and child guard each other.

**Seventh Question:** How is it the three-foot sword of going out and no entering, the one elixir pill of longevity and immortality?  
**Answer:** Going out and no entering is but one blackness. The three-foot sword is wisdom. Longevity and immortality is one spiritual true nature. One elixir pill is life. Just use clear honesty without heart, find a place of honesty to sit, nothing more.

**Eighth Question:** How is breath regulation?  
**Answer:** It is not a doing. If the heart has no affairs, qi and breath regulate themselves. But to know breath regulation is attachment. Breath regulation should be neither seen nor attached to mouth or nose. Today I say this to all elder brothers; there is nothing else. Just have no affairs in the heart, find a quiet place to sit. The disciple, because the heart has no affairs, enters the great Dao and follows this path.

**Ninth Question:** How is it that the Master Bodhidharma said, “Lift the void, turn the face, and observe”?  
**Answer:** The void is one nature; turning back and observing is not dimming.

**Tenth Question:** The disciple in old age left home, sinews and blood weakening; wishes the master to instruct.  
**Answer:** Repair it.  
**Further question:** How to repair?  
**Answer:** Simply have no affairs in the head, let go of all ten thousand ties, do not let the six gates interact. Use only one master, speak little, not attached to things, always not dim in the twelve hours, moderate sleep and wakefulness, let go at one moment—that is repair.

**Eleventh Question:** How are lead and mercury?  
**Answer:** Lead is father essence; mercury is mother blood; also nature and life, dragon and tiger.

**Twelfth Question:** In stillness, all kinds of thoughts arise, or one sleeps heavily. How to make thoughts not arise and sleep less?  
**Answer:** Only by wrapping the head with no material; spirit black and subtle. If the wrapping has material, naturally thoughts and sleep arise.

**Thirteenth Question:** How is the place beyond measure of Heaven and Earth, unknown to ghosts and spirits?  
**Answer:** What else could there be?

**Fourteenth Question:** How is it that among the twelve hours it seems like one hour?  
**Answer:** Not only among the twelve hours like one hour, but even ten thousand days; if even slightly unlike one hour, then early is early extinction.

Coming from the great Dao, going from the true Dao. Coming and going not touching dust, dwelling in purity and quiet.

**On Leaving Home to Cultivate:**  
Once leaving dust is leaving home; no action, no doing, my life’s path. If asked my cultivation secret, clouds disperse in the blue sky and the moon shines by itself.

**On Daily Use:**  
Nourishing nature and forgetting passion is daily use; begging door to door is life’s path. Coming and going free without hindrance; clear wind and bright moon are neighbors.

**Verse:**  
Immortals are what the world seeks,  
Who would stop all affairs in the heart?  
If one awakens to one’s true nature and life,  
Clear wind and bright moon roam together.

# Two Songs of the Water Dragon Chant

Originally leaving home and dust, no longer greedy for fame and profit. Disheveled hair and dirty face, sitting alone all day, cultivating the living work. Ancient temple niches and shrines, let others lose and fall westward. Recognizing no existence in nonexistence, knowing white and guarding black, continuous and silent regulating breath. No other distractions in the heart. With armpit pouch and staff accompanying. Straw sandals broken, bare legs, sheepskin covering the body. After hunger, patrol the door, begging to be fed, singing lililililira. Let others laugh and say, foolish lazy man—who recognizes him?

**Again:**  
The heart learning the Dao is as hard as iron, entirely fierce within oneself. Suddenly unlocking the benefit lock, cutting off name and fame, love and hate all abandoned. Ten thousand affairs no attachment, no provocation can hold, straw hut and grass house. Dwelling amidst the city’s battle, upright guarding the Dao, relying on this to pass time and moon. Becoming a poor Daoist, eating coarse food, ignoring cold and heat. Disheveled hair and dirty face, sitting alone all day, cultivating the living work. Meeting a bright master’s secret, the world’s Dao and wild winds come. Some deep and distant, subtle and mysterious times, teaching seven songs—how to speak?

**Verse:**  
Alone ascending the high mountain to gaze at the eight capitals,  
Black clouds disperse, the lonely moon wheel.  
Vast universe, countless people,  
Which man is a true hero?

# Explanation of the Red

Deep within the grotto heavens. The Dao is not far, yet people find it hard to understand. Floating and sinking within the inner scene, one must rely on the craftsman’s功夫 (skill). Waiting for dawn, one point of yang gives passage to the mysterious path. All hidden in the blue waves, deep within, the master of affairs. Earth thunder sounds, shaking mountain tops and rain. Gradually watering the yellow sprouts just breaking from the soil. The infant is gathered and carried away in a basket. Toward the true rosy six yang, cooking in the cauldron. Transporting and turning, east and west, south and north. Arranging the Eight Trigrams, the Nine Palaces to know the ancestral root. Within the ten stems, dividing left and right, to reveal dragon and tiger. After the Black Tortoise follows the Vermilion Bird, first the auspicious clouds spread. On the Qu River, myriad gods gather to meet. Returning to the Gui mother, riding the red dragon, returning to the grotto mansion. Seek out Master Ding for proof of residence; yin and yang meet in three thousand numbers. Pointing to Heaven, Earth, sea, and mountain, all enduring and firm.

**Poem:**  
The Yellow River waters turn to the Lü family,  
One pot of Heaven and Earth, old mist and clouds.  
Unfeeling white deer tunes the vermilion phoenix,  
There is a turtle entwined with a red snake.  
White snow flies on June mountain tops,  
Yellow sprouts grow long beneath winter waters.  
These Dao principles people still understand,  
But earthly immortals are tangled like hemp.

# The Green-Headed Duck

Words often spoken: awaken from the southern branch’s one dream of yellow root. Break the splendor, cloud niches spread white; recognize sects, reflect and return the light. With the sword of wisdom, cleave the net of love; with the horizontal flower staff, smash the dusty world. Where to meet? At Emei, as duty calls, swiftly hastening to Mount Hua. Hidden among woods and springs, the southern star within the Northern Dipper, sun and moon hidden in the sleeves. The vermilion face long, Heaven collapses and Earth crumbles, true nature remains unchanged. Dancing robe sleeves, Heaven and Earth’s narrow hatred, but spreading hands, Heaven and Earth balanced. Drunken and joyful, the bag holds the four seas; laughing happily, belly drinks three goblets. Several times at the Jade Pool, at the Dragon Flower assembly, the immortals’ precious feast, drunkenly falling over the rosy wine cup. The Jade Emperor’s imperial banquet, without me no gathering forms. Chongyang assembly, seven golden lotuses, blooming together with divine light.

**Verse:**  
Pure, bright, round and shining moon,  
Clear and bright water-mill lone circle.  
Green and deep, the jade pool shows its shadow,  
Melodious beyond things, celestial immortal.  
Drip and twirl, plucking out nothingness,  
Lively and lively, letting go of completeness.  
Turning and sprinkling in the crystal dish,  
Red and bright, a piece of blue sky.

**Verse:**  
On Jade Capital Mountain a pool of water,  
No bottom to be found in all directions.  
If you still recognize the boatman,  
Naturally you will be carried into the heavenly palace.
