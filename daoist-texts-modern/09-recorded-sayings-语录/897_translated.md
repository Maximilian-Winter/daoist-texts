## The Recorded Sayings of the Perfected One Hai Qiongbai, Volume One

Compiled by the Purple Pot Daoist Xie Xiandao

### Master and Disciple Q&A

The True Master Hai Qiongbai, together with Peng Xiang of the Crane Forest and Liu Yuanchang of the Purple Origin, on the evening of the Mid-Autumn Festival, when stars hung low and the moon sank, smoke rose and dew fell, with a thousand households shuttered and no one on the road, they clasped hands and passed through the Pomegranate Blossom Cavern. In a moment, dawn broke; lost in the brick-paved labyrinth, they sat atop the perilous rock. The Master ordered his two sons to take seats on either side. Then he turned and asked: “Heaven above, earth below, what night is this tonight? The path to the Divine Expanse is distant, the Purple Mansion sparsely inhabited. You two have long studied the dao of immortals! Surely you have questions to ask?”

The True Master said: “Laozi says: ‘There is something formed in the chaos, born before Heaven and Earth.’ How well said! Later generations call it Dao, call it Heart, call it Nature, call it Spirit, call it Qi, call it a single thought, call it Law or Teaching, call it Technique or Feeling. Alas, branches divide and sects separate—how could they know that the ‘something formed in the chaos’ truly exists?”

The True Master said: “The Great Maker is silent; the wind sings by itself, the music arises spontaneously; winter passes, ice must melt; spring comes, grass grows by itself; swallows and summer geese arrive; autumn returns, frost sky and plum blossoms bloom; fireflies glow on moonlit nights. This is all natural and spontaneous. Upon reaching this understanding, the mouth longs to speak but words fail; the heart wishes to follow but thoughts vanish.”

The True Master said: “The Great Maker acts without acting; primordial power does not govern. Someone asked, ‘How is this so?’ I say: the bird’s nest knows the wind, the burrow knows the rain. Ah! Such is humanity.”

The True Master said: “The world asks about all dharmas, and within dharmas all gates. These are all prescriptions of combined medicines, cures for sickness. Know this: the decoction is the agent that makes the medicine effective. Someone asked: ‘How is the decoction agent?’ I say: the heart is the decoction agent of the Law.”

The True Master said: “One day, the officers of the Thunder Division reported: wherever there is an incense burner, there is the Divine Expanse Jade Pure Mansion. Yuanchang asked: ‘The scriptures say the Divine Maiden is three thousand six hundred, always beside me; the lament says thirty-six thousand spirits dwell within my body. The scriptures and incantations are all words of the Most High—do they exist? Or not? Are they true? Or false?’ The answer was: ‘Within the human body are three inner treasures: the daily essence, qi, and spirit. The spirit is the master; essence and qi are guests. I am the master; the Golden Boy and Jade Maiden are guests. The so-called three thousand six hundred Divine Maidens and thirty-six thousand spirits are all transformations of essence and qi. Nowadays, the human mind is like a monkey and horse, racing a thousand li a day; how much more so when essence is depleted by lust and qi exhausted by anger! Moreover, eyes follow colors, ears are deceived by sounds—how much benefit accrues to oneself, and how much is lost, is beyond reckoning. They do not know that spirit light scatters outward, qi power rushes in all directions; once essence and qi are gone, how can the Golden Boy and Jade Maiden remain at the side? Ten thousand spirits are one spirit; ten thousand qi are one qi. From one arises ten thousand; gathering ten thousand returns to one—all are within my spirit.’”

The True Master said: “A single thought of a person, when gathered, becomes spirit; when dispersed, becomes qi. When spirit gathers, it is called the soul; when qi gathers, it is called the corporeal soul. When a person dies, they are called ghost; the yang is the soul, the yin is the corporeal soul.”

The True Master said: “The Northern Dipper Scripture was not composed by the Most High. It was recorded by Zhang Zhengyi in the Han dynasty as the essence of the Most High. People today do not understand the essence of the scripture, and merely gaze at stars and worship the Dipper. The qi within the human body rises in the east and sets in the west, ascends and descends, just like Heaven and Earth. The qi of Heaven and Earth is yin and yang daily; what humans receive is likewise. The Northern Dipper in the sky revolves day and night, dividing yin and yang, fixing the times; thus Heaven and Earth persist by it. Why not think of the one qi within the human body—who governs it? To know the governor is to know the Northern Dipper within the body. The Dipper Scripture says: ‘If one has the Northern Dipper Scripture at home, the six domestic animals will prosper and live.’ This is the Northern Dipper within the body, governing its qi so that eyes do not desire to see, ears do not desire to hear, nose does not desire fragrance, tongue does not desire taste, body does not desire touch, mind does not desire thought. Cultivate this essence, and naturally the home is peaceful, descendants flourish.’”

The True Master said: “The Northern Pole Exorcising Court originally had only four generals—Cui, Lu, Deng, and Dou. Now four more names have been added. The Plum Immortal’s Appraisal Court originally had only four generals—Pan, Geng, Lu, and Zha. Now four more names have been added. These are all later additions, not part of the original method.”

The True Master said: “Ancient officials used generals Huang and Liu; also Gao and Ding; also Jiao and Zeng; also Sang and He; also Xu and Xie. Those who received from their masters used them all with efficacy.”

The True Master said: “The ‘Hearts of Heaven Purple Text’ says: ‘Three Origins Cave Emptiness, Five Phases Cave Splendor, Eight Trigrams Cave Dawn, Ten Directions Cave Truth.’ Nowadays people practice the Eight Trigrams Cave Dawn method but still use the moving spirit character—this shows ignorance of its origin, confusing transmission with confusion, such is the case.”

The True Master said: “There was no ancient Fengdu method. At the end of the Tang dynasty, Master Da Yuanhao first transmitted this method to the world to summon ghosts and spirits. The method had only eight generals, three talismans, four spells, and the Fengdu General Register Seal. Later generations added many complicated things. How can such be true Law?”

The True Master said: “The Law clearly states the Northern Pole Exorcising Court, why call it the Heavenly Mechanism Court? Thus the Southern Pole has the Heavenly Pivot Court, just as the heavens have the Heavenly Pivot Province on the left and the Heavenly Mechanism Province on the right. The Green Heavenly Mechanism is the inner court of the Northern Pole; the Exorcising Court is the outer court. The Heavenly Pivot is also the inner court of the Southern Pole, and the Southern Pole also has the Presentation Court outside. Asked: ‘A single thought of a person can move Heaven and Earth; now when sending petitions and dispatching officers, after burning and sending, it should reach above—why then do six heavens of demons and monsters intercept?’ Answer: ‘A sincere single thought, united with the Dao and true, can summon true spirits without doubt! In ancient times, filial hearts, sincere hearts, righteous hearts, compassionate hearts, firm hearts, loyal hearts—all moved Heaven and Earth at the elbow feast question. It is the single focused heart, the single upright thought that causes this. Nowadays people burn petitions to reach the imperial court; this is just ritual teaching. The sincere thought’s effect is like shooting an arrow; the petition’s effect is like stabbing with a spear. The arrow is swift and reaches far; the spear is close but hard to reach. Thus petitions are tangible and demons can intercept. If the thought comes from the intangible, how can demons intercept?’ Yuanchang asked: ‘Every thought arises and ceases without stopping; why then can this thought not summon?’ Answer: ‘Have you not seen a cat hunting a mouse? Eyes wide and unblinking, four paws crouched and unmoving, mind without distraction, intent without false imagining, six roots aligned, head and tail in a straight line—thus all moves without fail.’”

The True Master said: “Chaos divided, the Three Powers established. Humans dwell between Heaven and Earth; though their form is small, their spirit is great; though their form is humble, their spirit is high. Yu Chan, at the appointed time, went to the palace to report; his petitions were as small as millet when on earth, but as large as a cup in the Heavenly Capital. At first on earth, the petition papers were very short and small; in heaven, the petitions were over a zhang tall and two zhang wide. From this we see the ‘Great Brahma Hidden Words’ saying that cloud qi condenses into over a zhang, the Heavenly True Sovereign writes with a brush—this is the meaning. Long ago, the ‘Clear Source Record’ saw heavenly writings above the Dragon Pool, saying ‘black and red edicts’ shown to the carp. Changli distinguished: this is the Emperor’s dragon-slaying script, its characters no more than an inch. Imagine in heaven, it is not just an inch. From this we see: the heavens are vast and change is great; humans are small and what appears is small. Like a person looking in a mirror: a large mirror shows a large face; a small mirror shows a small face. From now on, any petition paper must be at least one chi tall, not too tall; characters must be as large as millet, not too large. This is no falsehood.’ Yuanchang asked: ‘I once suspected that refining and petitioning are two different things—is that so?’ Answer: ‘The Scripture of Deliverance says: living body receives petition once; death soul receives refining twice. Now looking at the ‘Zhu Ling Jingxian Petition Record’, it says: the Nanchang Palace governs two palaces: one called the Upper Palace, one called the Lower Palace. The Upper Palace governs the refining department; the Lower Palace governs the petition department. The living body is in the lower earth, so the Lower Palace governs it; the death soul ascends to the upper heaven, so the Upper Palace governs it. Together called the Zhu Ling Fire Mansion, also called the Nanchang Refining and Petition Department. Nowadays people call the Nanchang Upper Official the refining department; the true official in charge uses the refining department seal but actually manages petition records for the living body—this is unfounded. Saying Nanchang Refining Department and also Upper Palace Refining Department is also unfounded. Now no need to say Upper or Lower Palace, nor refining or petition; just Nanchang Refining and Petition Department, using the original seal, then it has basis. The seal reads: ‘Nanchang Refining and Petition Department Seal’, in human double seal script, round and square, one chi three fen.’ Yuanchang asked: ‘How about the presenting steps?’ Answer: ‘The Gang steps mostly follow Yu; Yu’s steps are five, able to harmonize the Five Phases, and rise steadily. Generally, Gang steps use five steps, pushing the Five Phases of generation and overcoming. The steps are like a cat or dog crouching on a snake; advance five steps, retreat five steps; advance seven, retreat seven; the four directions follow the numbers of the Five Phases’ creation, until the snake crouches and then harms. Look at the crouching mouse too. The cat and dog crouch on the snake; between advancing and retreating, sometimes people strike or shout, and just as they turn, the snake harms them. Thus presenting steps fail. Like the Eight Gates Escape and Hidden Body methods, the essence lies in Gang steps!’ Asked: ‘There are doubts about the Yin-Yang Dipper taught in the world!’ Answer: ‘Nowadays people start with the left foot at the first star, reciting from Kui to Pi, calling it the Yang Dipper; starting with the right foot at the first star, reciting from Tan to Po, calling it the Yin Dipper. Wrong! This is baseless. The ‘Flying Spirit Visits the Dipper Scripture’ says: forward is Yang, reverse is Yin; from Kui to E is forward; from Pi to Kui is reverse. The main point is: ‘If you wish to fly spirit, do not offend the True Man.’ The True Man is the third star. Outside this are all Ding steps. Ding steps are stamping; single steps are tapping. If you say otherwise, I do not know!’”

Lu asked: “Is it permissible to summon generals with shouts and commands?” Answer: “The ancients said: ‘Respect them as lord and father, drive them as servant and messenger.’ Calling and summoning generals is spirit calling spirit. If a person has no authority, the spirit is not complete. When calling, one must hold the Most High’s mandate; then scolding and shouting at left and right, as if they were present. Thus one may use one’s spirit to command their spirits.”

The True Master told Xiang: “Now just wear one talisman, accept one office, practice one method, judge one department’s writings, before one department’s generals, use one talisman and one water—this is only mind and spirit meeting; using it is efficacious. Just like a true dragon, but one drop of water can become a torrential flood—why use such complexity?” Yuanchang asked: “In recent times, some practice the Lingbao method, others the Universal Penetration method, others the Primordial Unity method; none say these methods do not exist. Yet their categories are many, incantations complex, and in the Dao not very orthodox. Anciently, the Orthodox Unity transmitted teachings, so their methods were simple and easy. Now called Lingbao, how is it different from Universal Penetration? Now called Universal Penetration, how different from Primordial Unity? Now Primordial Unity, how different from Orthodox Unity? The human heart is originally Universal Penetration, originally Lingbao, originally Orthodox Unity, originally Primordial Unity. From one heart flow endless methods, like one qi of Heaven generating all things. And saying Primordial Unity is one rank, Lingbao is one rank, Universal Penetration is one rank, Orthodox Unity is one rank—like cuckoo and crow, or called Zigu, or Xiebao, or Baidi’s soul, or Ying Shan Hong, or pounding medicine bird, or Shu crow—all are one cuckoo.” 

The True Master said: “All dharmas arise from the heart; outside the heart there is no other Law.” Yuanchang asked: “Recently I saw the side door of the Lingbao method, also a Universal Penetration method, also a Most High Contending Bright Court method, some use the Most High Moming Court seal, some use the Universal Penetration seal. The seal text has Lingbao Universal Penetration, Mixed Transformation Profound Secret, eight characters arranged in eight directions. Inside the seal are the words Department, Court, Province, Mansion; inside the seal text is round, outside is square, taking the meaning of Universal Penetration. In my humble opinion, Lingbao Universal Penetration, Mixed Transformation Profound Secret, is the heart seal. So wanting to use this wooden seal to cover these eight characters—is this right? The so-called Department, Court, Province, Mansion is the spiritual platform; wanting to use this wooden seal for this Department, Court, Province, Mansion—is this right? Not knowing Lingbao is originally Universal Penetration, Universal Penetration is originally Cold Brightness, why seek branches and leaves with such complexity?” Answer: “Indeed it is the Universal Penetration method, but the seal made is not truly Universal Penetration.” Yuanchang asked: “Is there shamanic method? Its right or wrong is hard to tell.” Answer: “Shamans’ method began with King Satan, passed to King Pangu, then to King Ashura, then to King Vidha, King Changsha, King Head Monk, Lushan Nine Lang, Mengshan Seven Lang, Hengshan Ten Lang, Zhao Hou Three Lang, Zhang Zhao Two Lang, and so on. Formerly shamanic methods included Pangu method, Ling Mountain method, Question Mountain method—all one shamanic method. Shamanic methods often borrow Most High words, so their methods use Most High incantations. The funniest is that formerly shamans wrote in cursive ‘Most High in Heaven’ under talismans; now shamans do not know the meaning, but say ‘Great King in Profound’. Ha! Ha!” Yuanchang asked: “How about incantations and blessings in the Law?” Answer: “The character ‘chi’ means blessing. The meaning of blessing is to reach Heaven, Earth, and spirits. If so, then the world’s questions of good and evil blessings are all about retribution. Now it is otherwise—why? Because they do not know the meaning of ‘chi’. Frogs in wells croaking at the Great Clear, ants in holes making noise at the Upper Spirit—this is like today’s blessings. How can blessings obtain retribution? Like the Law’s incantations, first they are words declared by the Most High’s golden mouth; second, they often call generals and officers. The key to incantations is the Law. Thus sigh, generals follow, high perfected ones hear. Nowadays incantations fail because they do not understand this meaning. The meaning of incantation values the heart’s presence and mental image; then calling generals is like spirits present before you.” Yuanchang asked: “The Scripture of Deliverance says: thirty-six above in Heaven, thirty-six below on Earth, the Supreme Mystery is boundless, marvelous indeed the Great Cave Scripture. Some say these are yin and yang two blacks, seventy-two seasons—is this so?” Answer: “This concerns the human body. The Mud Pellet represents Heaven, belongs to Qian Qian number four; Qian metal Jiazi, metal number four, Qian uses nine. The Tail Gate represents Earth, belongs to Kun, Kun number six, Kun uses six. Thus four times nine is thirty-six, called above Heaven; six times six is thirty-six, called below Earth. This means the head has thirty-six veins, the abdomen thirty-six networks; Heaven and Earth are likewise. Only the human heart is invisible and unheard, so it is called Supreme Mystery boundless, marvelous indeed the Great Cave.” Lu asked: “There are five precepts; one says no drinking wine. But wine does no harm to the Dao; I fear it confuses nature. Should wine be forbidden?” Answer: “The Treasury Scripture of the Most High says: ‘Talented and outstanding, only wine is indulgence; yeast and malt smoke the heart, nature and feeling reversed, breaking the ten good, stirring up ten evils. The Four Passages become wild, the Six Communications are blocked.’”

The True Master told Xiang: “The female immortal E Luhua said to Yang Quan: ‘Those who cultivate the Dao see brocade as dirt, see rank and title as passing guests, see gold and jade as rubble. No thought, no worry, no affairs, no action; walking where others cannot walk, learning what others cannot learn, diligent where others cannot be diligent, gaining what others cannot gain. Why? Because the world pursues desire, but I walk alone; the world learns mundane affairs, but I learn serene indifference; the world works for fame and profit, but I work inwardly; the world gets old and dies, but I attain longevity.’” The True Master said: “Ancients said: ‘Wisdom surpassing the master is worthy of transmission; wisdom equal to the master diminishes the master’s virtue by half. Moreover, the book says: the master toils and merits half; the master rests and merits double.’ This is so.”

The Master said: “Among all things, only mercury and brain cannot be faked. In teachings, essence is likened to mercury, called ‘quicksilver’; the brain marrow is called brain. Mercury easily flies away; the brain easily flees. Even mercury and brain, though sealed in secret places, have means to draw them out; if they fly or flee, their place is lost, like pepper penetrating mercury. Nowadays, essence and marrow are mostly captured by lust, thus drying up. Alas!”

The True Master said: “My former master Chen Niujiu, once at the Hui Temple, met the Great Cave Perfected One Sun Jun, who said: ‘Long ago, the Primordial Heavenly Venerable and Most High Laozi spoke scriptures, collected and compiled into a canon. Like the Northern Dipper Scripture, Southern Dipper Scripture, Disaster Relief Scripture, Constant Purity Scripture, Heavenly Child Scripture, Lingbao Deliverance Scripture—all have true traces from the Jade Emperor Heavenly Venerable and higher matters.’ Asked: ‘How about the Yoga teachings now?’ Answer: ‘Their teaching claims to be the legacy of Shakyamuni. Shakyamuni transformed into the impure Vajra, descending to the Brahma King with spiral hair. Thus this teaching spread, subduing demons and controlling heterodox paths, merely the thirty-three-character golden wheel impure incantation. Yet their teaching includes Nagarjuna the Medicine King to assist! Besides this, there are the two great saints Xiangshan and Xueshan, the two great saints Pig Head and Elephant Nose, the two great saints Xiongwei and Huaguang, Prince Nawan, King Dingshu, and the gods Shensha and Jiedi to support their method. Thus there are Vajra warriors as assistants, called generals, only the four: Tiger-headed, Horse-headed, Ox-headed, and Golden-headed. Others do not exist. Nowadays evil masters mix various Daoist words, step the Gang, twist seals, shout loudly, dance wildly, shake bells and gongs, whip hemp snakes, beat peach sticks, and greatly lose the true ancient teaching. This seems not the work of Shakyamuni. Yet Yoga is also one method of Buddhist demon subjugation.’ Asked: ‘In the countryside many eat vegetables and keep fasts to serve the Bright Teaching, calling it demon extermination. They say it is the legacy of Most High Laozi—is this so or not?’ Answer: ‘Long ago in Su Lin country there was a layman called Mu Ge, who first studied immortality but failed, then studied Buddhism but did not succeed, hiding in the great Naga mountain. He met foreign teachers from the Western Heaven, one called Vipashya Ming envoy, who taught him one method to practice, thus he stayed with this teaching. In fact, it is not true. Their teaching has one prohibition: all earth, mountains, rivers, grass, trees, water, fire—all belong to Vairocana’s dharmakaya, so they dare not step or move. Though so, they hold eight fasts and worship the five directions, only teaching discipline. Their teaching has one: Heavenly King; two: Bright Envoy; three: Spiritual Landlord, to govern their teaching. Mainly about clear contention, brightness, great power, wisdom—these eight characters are all in the heart. Now people attach to appearances in practice, wanting to exhaust these eight characters—is that possible? Moreover, the Bright Teaching, yet they are self-ignorant.’”

The True Master said: “Sometimes mundane, sometimes holy, like shadow follows form; one is infinite, infinite is one. Like sun and moon reflected in many waters: sun and moon’s light have no difference, following water they arise, chasing eyes they appear. One water has a thousand eyes, a thousand suns and moons; one water one eye, one sun one moon; a thousand waters one eye, one sun one moon; a thousand waters a thousand eyes, a thousand suns a thousand moons—like shadow follows form, so it is. Taking or not taking, neither is possible; neither taking nor rejecting, also impossible.” Asked: “What of the yin elixir and yang elixir spoken of in the world? Are these external or internal elixirs?” Answer: “External elixirs are hard to refine and fail; internal elixirs are easy to refine and succeed. Yin and yang elixirs are internal elixirs. Elixir means heart; heart means spirit. Yang spirit is called yang elixir; yin spirit is called yin elixir; in truth both are internal elixirs. To shed the body and change bones, having a body outside the body—gathered it forms shape, dispersed it becomes black—this is yang spirit. A clear single thought, soul and consciousness not dispersed, like dream or shadow, akin to ghost—this is yin spirit. Today’s practitioners of elixir must know this.”

The True Master told Yuanchang: “‘Red Spirit Jade Text’ says: East Extreme Treasure Splendor, West Extreme Great Clarity, North Extreme Exorcising, South Extreme Heavenly Pivot. These are the Four Extremes, and the Central Extreme Five Thunders truly govern the Four Extremes. Now the Capital Heavenly Great Thunder all issue from the Divine Expanse Jade Pivot above, called Jingxiao Great Thunder. Though Jingxiao is beneath Divine Expanse, it is the station of the Primordial Venerable. Previously, the Heavenly True dispatched the Wolf Tooth Fierce Officer of the Thunder Division, the Judge Xin Hanchen, who gave it to former master Chen Cuixu, who passed it to me; now I entrust it to you—keep it secret.’”

The True Master said: “Spirit returns to vastness, Sumeru small; qi enters emptiness, mustard seed wide.”

The True Master told Xiang: “You say the Eleven Luminaries incantation is truly Most High’s words—is this clear?” He said: “Indeed!” The Master said: “Ha! In that incantation it says ‘Gan Stone pushes flow down’; but Gan De and Shi Shen were star elders of the Spring and Autumn and Warring States periods. Gan Shi was not born yet when this scripture existed. Comparing this, how could it be Most High’s words? Ha!”

The True Master told Yuanchang: “You say the world’s Primordial Unity Wish-Fulfilling method is true?” He said: “Yes.” The Master said: “Ha! That method has incantations: ‘Northern Pole Protector True Lord’s decree’, also ‘Three Heavens Supporting Teaching Auxiliary Primordial Great Master’s decree’. If so, it is suspicious. Protector You Sheng was a Zhou person; Heavenly Master was Han person. If the Primordial Unity method existed before the Most High Laozi, it should not use Laozi’s decrees, much less You Sheng and Heavenly Master! Why so? Called Primordial Unity. Ha!”

Lu asked: “Recently heard of the Universal Penetration method, secretly doubted it. Their method’s seal is round inside and square outside, with Five Phases inside, Eight Trigrams outside, Departments and Courts arranged at four sides, taking Lingbao Universal Penetration as the sect, Mixed Transformation Profound Secret as the root. They gather various method talismans and incantations, creating one family, calling it the Universal Penetration Great Method. Master, do you approve?” He said: “Spirit has no shape, so it is round; qi has no body, so it is penetrating. The ancient Universal Penetration teaching is spirit and qi mixed, entering and exiting emptiness, returning to chaos. If now it is made with forms, vessels, trigrams, numbers, how far from true Universal Penetration! Alas! Evil masters err, not the fault of sentient beings.”

The True Master told Xiang: “Do you know the two envoys Qingyang and Tuoluo in the Dipper?” He said: “Please tell.” He said: “Qingyang is a character on earth, but in heaven it is the sound of goodness; Tuoluo is a word on earth, but in heaven it is the character for capital. Qingyang’s envoy holds a jade vase and golden lotus; Tuoluo’s envoy holds a golden plate and white-tasselled incense burner. If seen by the mundane, it is mistaken!”

The True Master said: “Former master said: There is great joy in the human world. But joy and sorrow cycle continuously; joy does not last a hundred years, even if a kalpa. Nowadays people with money cling to death; without money they seek death. Never have I seen people vie for life over money, not money over life. Ah!”

The True Master told Yuanchang: “You know all the methods I speak are heart methods?” He said: “I know.” He said: “What is the heart?” He said: “I do not know.” He said: “Since you do not know, how do you practice?” He said: “All dharmas are heart dharmas.” He said: “Then practice, and after long time you will know; knowing is not knowing, not knowing is knowing. Though you do not know, how is it different from knowing?” Xiang and Yuanchang heard these words, leapt with grief and awakening. Hai Qiong smiled and rose.

### Petition of Transmission and Gratitude

By the command of the Most High Divine Expanse Jade Pure Mansion Thunder Order, commanding the Five Thunder Generals and soldiers, leading the Thunder Capital Department’s ghosts and spirits affairs, your servant Yu Chan says: on the fifteenth day of this month, I humbly serve as the Western Platform Officer of the Jade Pure Divine Expanse, the Great Thunder Judge of the Immortal Capital Wind and Thunder, your servant Peng Xiang, Great Cave Profound Capital Three Scenery Master of the Jade Pure, Taiyi Thunder Officer, Nine Spirit Flying Step Immortal Officer, signing documents for various departments’ courts and ghosts and spirits affairs; your servant Liu Yuanchang, Most High Orthodox Unity Oath Master, appointed Exorcising Court Judge, Nanchang Officer, Nine Spirit Flying Step Immortal Officer, also managing Thunder Capital Department’s ghosts and spirits affairs; your servant Lin Boqian, Most High Three Five Capital Merit Office Register, Divine Expanse Jade Mansion Right Attendant Scripture; your servant Pan Changji, Most High Three Five Capital Merit Office Register, Divine Expanse Jade Mansion Right Attendant Scripture; your servant Zhou Xiqing, Most High Three Five Capital Merit Law Register Disciple, executing Heavenly Heart Orthodox Law Exorcising Court Judge, also managing Five Thunder Officers’ Court affairs; your servant Hu Shijian, Most High Orthodox Unity Oath Master, practicing Jade Pure Primordial Unity Heavenly Heart Five Thunder Great Law, appointed to manage Exorcising Court affairs, also Thunder Capital Department affairs; your servant Luo Zhida, Most High Three Five Capital Purple Void Yang Light Secret Register Disciple, practicing Jade Pure Northern Pole Heavenly Heart Orthodox Law Golden Palace Inner Platform Refining and Petition Officer, Exorcising Court Right Judge; your servant Chen Shoumo, Most High Orthodox Unity Oath Master, practicing Lingbao Heavenly Heart Jade Morning Five Thunder Great Law, Nine Spirit Flying Step Immortal Officer, managing Exorcising Yellow Register Court affairs; your servant Zhuang Zhirou and others, entrusted with Daoist Law, petitioning for Jade Mandate, instructing the above dispatch, respectfully presenting this petition to the palace, expressing thanks for heavenly grace. Humbly, the Law has orthodox transmission, happily inherited from master’s teaching, office not given in vain, hoping to repay heavenly grace. Dare to bow and submit this petition. We are but insects and ants, what do we know? We are but dust in China, truly from the Great Sovereign’s creation. Relying on Heaven and Earth’s support, bearing the sun and moon’s illumination, we eat with shame, what merit have we with things? Reflecting on vast kalpas until this life, having this body now, yet still three evils and unwholesome acts: killing, stealing, lust; six roots’ ignorance, greed, anger, delusion, love; sins vast as the sea, karma heavy as mountains. Thanks to the Most High opening the door of repentance, allowing even the dull to present their faults, both to atone past offenses and to prevent future calamities. To fail to return is truly to betray cultivation. Meeting the Divine Expanse Five Thunder Scripture, all rare immortals receive the Most High Nine Spirits’ mandate. Thus able to hold seals in hand, write flying talismans, command wind and thunder, distinguish ghosts and humans, save life and deliver death, assist righteousness and remove evil. How could we fall into dust hall questions, dare to fly steps on Kui Gang? Since ancient times transmission, now thus practiced, internal refining of knife and jade, external storing of merit and practice, embodying Heaven and acting transformation, aiding country and saving people. Respectfully thinking of the Most High Divine Expanse Jade Pure True Sovereign, Long Life Great Emperor, the Dao is great and hard to name, virtue broad and vast, parent of all beings, ruler of realms and moon master. Leading the Nine Streams before myriad brightness, governing the Eight Extremes beyond the great void, compassionate to save the world, skillful to deliver beings. I carve the Eastern Platform, the latrine in the Western Mansion, lecturing on talisman breaking and voucher rites, imitating enemy blood drinking elixir ceremony, swearing to lead generals and officers, establishing distinguished merit, all relying on talismans to spread the great teaching. Deep sincerity humbly reflected, true yin secretly trusted, wishing to clear sea and mountain dust, and lock demons and monsters in caverns, thus blocking void intrusions, again raising Orthodox Unity’s wind. Braving heavenly might, following imperial command, if granted protection, may implementation succeed. Body not yet fully true, embryo black further aided by jade black, spirit entering mystery, heart and Heaven harmoniously united in roaming Heaven. We respectfully present this petition. Truly fearful and trembling. Prostrate! Bow! Twice bow, respectfully spoken.  
In the year of the Earth Tiger, Jiading eleventh year, tenth month, your servant Yu Chan presents this petition.

### Divine Expanse Chant, Three Quatrains

Vast and boundless is the Divine Expanse Heaven,  
When will the Jade Capital dawn?  
Jade flowers wet with dew like medicine,  
Rare trees whispering in the wind.  

Jade Consort attends the cloud chest,  
Feathered youths dance with golden feathers,  
Alas, the people of the world,  
In red dust, day after day in vain.  

Purple jade flies to the Clear Capital,  
Emerald clouds guard the Crimson Palace,  
No stars are seen,  
Looking down only on sun and moon.  

Two thousand years hence,  
Dare not speak to humans,  
I have become Golden Elixir,  
Leaving behind the Flying Immortal secret.  

Jade Emperor’s incense table officer,  
Golden Palace gatekeeper,  
Treasure furnace cooks sun and moon,  
Iron ruler whips thunder.  

At dawn refining western mountain clouds,  
At night before the Northern Dipper star,  
South city reports tree spirits,  
My home is in the Jade Capital.  

My master Hai Qiong Jun,  
Flying bestowal between Kang and Lu,  
In Jiading Earth Tiger spring,  
A letter to meet at Wuyi,  
You as clan attendant,  
Carrying mandate to the capital,  
Summer goes, autumn returns,  
Seeking alliance by boat, nowhere to be found.  

Thus leave three quatrains to record.  
Once said: Lady Zhou Xiqing came riding,  
That year Double Ninth, Purple Origin’s Liu Yuanchang wrote well.  

Before the Stop Stop Hermitage Nine Bend Creek,  
I lean on the oar facing the slanting sun,  
Meeting people still ask if master has returned,  
Only see dragons and snakes flying on the wall.  

The True Master’s silent traces,  
Flying between the walls.  

Flying steps come seeking the Bone Exchange Rock,  
Empty remains of shed skin buried in the boundary box,  
Purple Origin is not without immortal share,  
What relies on whom for guidance?  

Today just the Double Ninth,  
Wind in cave carries osmanthus fragrance,  
Gather chrysanthemums with Lady Zhou,  
Return full of Nine Clouds cup.

### Flying Immortal Poem Presented to Purple Origin

Riding the jade turtle at night to gather bright moon,  
Medicine hall and jade terrace cold to the bone,  
Thirty-six heavens do not close their gates,  
Wind blows rare flowers scattering petals.  

Who sounds the bugle with many guards,  
Eighty thousand rainbow robes sing white snow,  
Purple Emperor’s banquet just ended,  
Straightening clothes, simple and proper, going to court.  

Fire bell general shouts once,  
Left and right myriad spirits bristle hair,  
Announcing: ‘I am a thunder officer,  
Formerly punished, resigned from the elixir palace.’  

Buried in red dust to the ears,  
Eating green and drinking blue, guarding bitter season,  
Flying spirit ascends heaven to quench thirst,  
This emperor has wine, seeking one sip.  

The envoy drunk lets me return,  
Returning to the human world to tell,  
Phoenix Pavilion below asks the way home,  
Jade boys and jade girls ask the child.  

Heaven’s days long, Great Clarity void,  
Is the human world still like this place?  
Shaking head, no answer, sleeves brushed aside,  
White clouds faintly obscure the Clear Capital.  

In the cave, apes and cranes recognize each other,  
White stones crumble, green pines wither.

### Hua Yang Poems, Thirty in Number

Home lies ten thousand li away on Jade Cliff,  
This body comes and goes like a lone boat,  
At night dreams chase the west wind,  
Eyes severed from home mountain, tears flow empty.  

Hainan is a piece of water and cloud sky,  
Looking afar flowers bloom for ten years,  
Suddenly at one or two moments turning back,  
West wind and sunset choke the sad cicadas.  

Since leaving Hainan boat,  
Body follows clouds flying to Jiangzhe sky,  
Traveling all over caves seeking hermits,  
Not knowing how many straw shoes spent.  

White clouds accompany me to Tiantai,  
Eyes enter green mountains, heart opens wide,  
Arriving at that mountain, again arise,  
Empty making night apes mourn.  

Leaning on staff seeking body into Wuyi,  
Under slow pavilion snowflakes fly,  
Walking from Nine Bend beach to look,  
Ten thousand valleys and thousand cliffs encircle green.  

Wuyi tied grass more than two years,  
Flowers laugh, orioles sing, spring with a pot,  
Flowing water down mountain, man leaves cave,  
Before the rock only a refining furnace remains.  

Getting the secret, returning to try refining,  
Dragon fights tiger in a moment,  
Jiuhua heaven people know the gain,  
One night wind and thunder shake ten thousand mountains.  

White horse at riverhead howls once,  
Red light purple mist arises in water,  
Quickly draw the blue snake sword from the box,  
Just clears the Yellow River thoroughly.  

Thirsty drink golden waves hundreds of cups,  
Drunk wield sword pointing at the void,  
Feet playfully tread the Qian Dipper,  
Long howl once, Heaven and Earth red.  

Move the Northern Dipper past the Southern Dipper,  
Both hands hold sun and moon wheels,  
Fly chasing Kunlun mountain top,  
In a moment transform into a sky cloud.  

Playfully float golden boat to sea edge,  
Secretly follow sea water crossing drifting sand,  
Once landing on Penglai shore,  
Go see jade terrace palace garden flowers.  

Human body naturally has one Penglai,  
Twelve layers of white jade steps,  
●●●●●●●● female golden boat often gathers,  
In front of hall every night peonies bloom.  

Strange things make people laugh several times,  
Men now also can conceive,  
Own essence and blood mate,  
Body wrapped as husband and wife, how wondrous!  

One chant, one drink, one jade tablet,  
True qi and true essence fill limbs,  
If drunk and asleep,  
Boat full of treasures crosses Cao Creek.  

Original spirit nightly lodges in elixir field,  
Clouds fill Yellow Court, moon fills sky,  
Two mandarin ducks float on green water,  
Water heart one purple golden lotus.  

Hungry eat one or two black turtle livers,  
Cold toward elixir field fierce fire mountain,  
Only see no point in heart,  
Not knowing human world has hunger and cold.  

Green ox man gone many years,  
This dao clearly before eyes,  
If wanting to know true place now,  
One hall wind cold moon bright.  

A moment’s work refining mercury and bismuth,  
One furnace fierce fire burns heaven at night,  
Suddenly divine water falls in golden well,  
Matches spirit sand moon-like round.  

One pool divine water fills Hua Pond,  
Nightly by pond white snow flies,  
Snow wraps someone catching jade rabbit,  
Driving bright moon onto cold branch.  

Not moving a hair past Jade Pass,  
At pass is Jade Capital mountain,  
Able within mountain to come and go,  
Wind stirs Nine Heavens frost and snow cold.  

Who knows the Great Cycle creation work,  
Now compressed in a moment,  
Only take lead and mercury into true earth,  
Refine out golden flower full pot red.  

Last night at third watch thunder shakes mountain,  
Nine Heavens gates never closed,  
On Cao Creek road clearly seen,  
One golden crow enters the vast cold.  

Cao Creek road penetrates Mud Pellet,  
Only between elixir field up and down,  
Releases golden elder to match lovers,  
Morning clouds, evening rain fill Wushan.  

Only use Earth and Fire as elixir furnace,  
Refine red pill into jade paste,  
Slowly guard fire line three hundred days,  
Produce one night bright pearl.  

Jiangyue Immortal Capital one scattered official,  
Occasionally comes to the human world feigning madness,  
Body has long life treasure,  
Nightly flying spirit visits the High Heavens.  

Home in Divine Expanse Nine Black Heavens,  
Heavenly towers store many immortals,  
Occasionally come to human world,  
Guess Divine Expanse not yet one year.  

Under Jade Emperor’s palace one immortal youth,  
Once in charge of talismans and guarding medicine palace,  
Why still worldly ties not broken,  
Now illusion substance trapped in dust cage.  

Qi covers mountains and rivers, heart and gall bold,  
Cannot learn sword nor search books,  
At night stirring Heaven and Earth,  
Fire timing warm guarding jade furnace.  

Dream and illusion body not long-lasting,  
Mulberry and elm how long can endure wind and frost?  
Better to jump into the pit of fame and profit,  
Present you the formula of longevity and immortality.  

Playing with poems and wine divine power,  
Hiding poetry and wine from human eyes,  
Coming and going in red dust for several winters.

### Inscription at Tianqing Temple

Bought a leaf boat on Luo River,  
Fame and fortune like wax—ah, cease!  
I do not drag tail begging pity,  
Early make heart ash, no official plans.  

Already learned lacquer garden farming by Bai Zhao,  
Willing to be magistrate waiting for Green Ox,  
What of jade tablet matters, who can understand?  
Bright moon and clear wind nod in approval.

### Inscription at Yue Shrine

From the south comes a sword halting three mountains,  
Dividing lifetime wind and moon fears,  
Who governs Jingyang should apply medicine,  
Originally seeking Gou Lou for refining elixir.  

Meng Zhuang admires lacquer garden salary,  
Old Li once was official under pillar,  
I see glory and wealth truly common,  
Better to early refine jade blue lapis lazuli.

### Flying Swallow Flies to Hua House

Looking far on Divine Expanse road,  
Dipper ladle south, red blossoms emerald scene,  
Red clouds purple mist,  
Hand plucks rare flowers now like dream,  
Twelve towers where?  
Still remember then with companion song.  

East Mansion West Platform who rules?  
Recall then, pouring golden vase,  
Between two people matters like wind fluff.  

High Emperor majestic thunder lord,  
I what green, Clear Capital Crimson Palace,  
Suddenly become eternal.  

White crane and blue crow news cut off,  
Dreaming phoenix song and phoenix dance,  
Should not yet turn over and return,  
Karma debts must be fully repaid,  
This time tasted red dust’s bitterness.  

Returning raised like Queen Mother of the West.

Also:  
Moon stuck in blue spiral hairpin,  
Willow tips, sunset waning,  
West wind sways.  

Several grains of blue mountain withered far Han,  
Tree colors smoke light purple emerald.  

Flying rider half awake half drunk,  
Sword at hip autumn sky sharpens stars and dipper,  
Pointing at jade boy, cannot sound golden reins,  
Fear to disturb Purple Clear Emperor.  

Floating clouds fly across Penglai waters,  
Recall mountain cold pine dew chill,  
Ape cries crane calls.  

Home in Wuyi rock valley,  
One mu of smoke and clouds livelihood,  
Sigh burning finger, life hundred years.  

Orchid bowl ganoderma field how many ancient,  
Before cave door little deer watch flowers play,  
Unaware people ask world.

### Presented to Medicine Pearl Attendant Pan Changji

One point red dust stirs into heart,  
Medicine Pearl hall drops lost hairpin,  
At that time descended on Jade Terrace road,  
Only now Peng Helin.  

Dream of human world not knowing retreat,  
Nightly under window tuning jade zither,  
Laughing pointing Divine Expanse return not yet,  
Crimson Palace Clear Capital smoke haze probing.

### Presented to Purple Flower Attendant Zhou Xiqing

Bowing head with moth-brow heavenly person,  
Not knowing what matter arrives in red dust,  
Divine Expanse medicine chest now who attends,  
Purple Mansion rare flowers dare not bloom spring.  

No dream to accompany Queen Mother’s feast,  
Past lives mostly Purple Void body,  
Sending word to seek Penglai road,  
Wind sends twin phoenixes to Great Radiance.

## The Recorded Sayings of the Perfected One Hai Qiongbai, Volume Two

Compiled by Gate Disciples Fuzhou Tianqing Temple Overseer and Capital Daoist Purple Light Lin Boqian et al.

### Crane Forest Dharma Words

In Jiading Renwu year, Lantern Festival, Patriarch Hai Qiong Jun, writing to Deliverance Master Crane Forest Jun, from Zhejiang to Fujian, for Deliverance Master Crane Forest Jun’s father, former Ministry official Jue Fei, practicing Yellow Register affairs. That day at dawn arrived at the Stop, Deliverance Master carried incense and advanced, kowtowing long. His words: “Since residing in Fujian, since master’s departure, day and night traveling the dao, none dare idle. What does Heaven say? It took away the estimate of Xiang, shortly reporting to the provincial Dao candidate, and the estimate already collapsed, praying master to pity. Indeed at the time of collapse, wind and thunder flew and roared, the whole house fragrant, outside door clear day, no one heard, seeming different from other deaths. At burial, continuous yin rain, suddenly cleared; burial done, rain resumed. Locals also knew and found it strange. Xiang presumptuously used Yellow Register to wash, now master comes down, this Yellow Register affair is thus. Three Realms are greatly blessed! Ten thousand spirits rejoice!” Patriarch said: “My son, no need for excessive ceremony; today just Lantern Festival, hasten to build Jingzhi, establish Jade Hall, place Jade Treasury Office, and also Yellow Register office. From Chen to Shen hours, documents completed, announcing covenant to Heaven and Earth, planting huge banners at the gate. Appoint Xu Yi Zhao Rukuai as High Merit, Purple Pivot Lin Shizhong as Capital Lecturer, Purple Light Lin Boqian as Supervisor of Fasting Herbs, Fang Hao Jing’an as Attendant Scripture, Yu Ling Deng Daoning as Attendant Incense, Yu Hua Chen Milong as Attendant Lamp, Purple Pot Xie Xiandao as Altar Director, Purple Qiong Zhao Shoufu as Watchman. I take charge of Upper Clarity Yellow Register Envoy as General Supervisor. With appointments on last day of first month, affairs begin on first day of second month, on fourth day complete the offering, then thank grace, fifth day worship thunder. All fasting and offering affairs use ancient style, nine morning offerings as usual ceremony.”

Deliverance Master said: “Agreed.”

On second month first day Gengchen, early dawn, heavy rain poured, raining three days, wind rain dark and gloomy, during three days and nights, nine morning offerings. One talent led the team to pay respects, suddenly cleared, after offering resumed rain, all nine mornings so. On second day Xinsi at evening, submitted petition; people worried about rain; just as petition submitted, rain stopped, clouds gathered on all sides, only altar’s North Star shone brightly, outside altar rain like before. At auspicious time affairs done, altar rain also poured, observers congratulated. Patriarch said: “Yin and clear are Heaven’s affairs, coincidence only, why worry! Why rejoice!”

On third day Renwu at long time, someone in temple saw it, knowing it was prior spirit’s arrival. Deliverance Master happily reported; Patriarch immediately stopped him: “Listen to it yourself. The Great Dao is formless, not valuing images. Law is the Dao’s use! Who now sees anything? Why strange?” Someone asked: “After offering finished, welcoming true, announcing pardon, after that great clear as before offering, only nine mornings first and last, why such yin rain?”

Patriarch said: “Ancient and modern Yellow Register building often yin gloomy, because ghosts suffer dryness, coming from Yin Gate, this is also summoned response.” On seventh day Bingxu summoned all gods and officers, also sacrificed thunder. After ceremony, with executed livestock and wine dried meat at Xun place, buried with cinnabar talisman, agreed for three days thunder roar, dug talisman to secure Crane Forest peace. That year, due to no rain last winter, wheat planting was hard; meeting this Yellow Register, soil gained moisture.

After offering, for fasting palace thanking grace, spirit officers said merit.

Deliverance Master replied: “Master’s offering affairs, locals have not seen, but Xiang obtained much! And benefiting sentient beings not few. Following rules and steps, medicine and human heart, seeing unprecedented, shining before and after. But master hears all spirit marvels and wonders, all stops—why? Because coincidence only, no need to rejoice. I neither rejoice at presence nor worry at absence, only know to practice dao and serve law, listen to nature. So relying on sincerity to penetrate response, relying on law to conduct affairs. Why worry or rejoice, which would lose my right thought?”

Someone asked: “What is the meaning of Yellow Register?” Patriarch said: “Nine Hells extract sins, have gold register and white slip method. Gold register is Yellow Register; thus Heaven also establishes Yellow Register Court. Yellow is the root of all colors; Register is the talisman of myriad spirits. This means yellow’s principle qi governs myriad spirits, going from dark to light, saving life and delivering death. Register means record, recording ghosts and spirits’ registers. Yellow means master, governing ghosts and spirits’ affairs. The ghosts and spirits of the netherworld have masters who govern and record.”

Deliverance Master asked: “The Dipper is the imperial chariot, moving in the center, controlling four directions, observing demons and omens. The scripture says: ‘Central Dipper Great Leader governs myriad spirits.’ Another scripture says: ‘Northern Dipper Seven Stars, great gods in heaven.’ ‘Lu Yu’ also says: ‘Like the Northern Pole, with many stars surrounding.’ If so, the Dipper Pole is the unmatched image, because it governs the star river. Some say the Dipper lies in the Twenty-Eight Constellations, located in the north, so called Southern Dipper—why say so? Not knowing the Dipper handle points from Zi to Hai, day and night always revolving, beginning and end all north, thus called Northern Dipper. The so-called Southern Dipper is among the Twenty-Eight Constellations, at the head of northern constellations, not comparable to Northern Dipper. Recent times confused by Southern Dipper’s name, drawing its image all red. Also placed above Northern Dipper, how absurd!”

Someone else said: “Dipper lodges in the Twenty-Eight Constellations’ degree, located in north; why call it Southern Dipper?” Not knowing jade is north yet called East Jade, well is south yet called East Well, can be understood by analogy. How to explain this principle?

Patriarch said: “Indeed so! According to ‘Zhou Tian Star Map’ and armillary sphere, and ancient and modern stepping books, none say Southern Dipper is above Northern Dipper, nor is there Southern Dipper name. This is Daoist talk of Southern Dipper Six Officials, perhaps hidden stars in heaven, also cannot be examined. According to Law books there is ‘Southern Dipper Secret Names’ ●●●●●●, belonging to Southern Pole, Zhu Ling Fire Department Fire Bell’s office; also ‘Southern Dipper Inner Secret’ says: ‘Zhana Banqu Great Black’ is the so-called Southern Dipper. If wanting to erase it, how about scriptures?”

Deliverance Master asked: “The Five Planets and Six Luminaries have flowing, hiding, invading paths, rebellious, thin, eroding differences, truly related to disasters and calamities. For rites to remove disasters and cross calamities, must report to them. Reporting is fine, but must follow Law image and set lamps! According to ‘Golden Register Essentials’ says: all lamps have rites. But only this lamp rite is not set, is this omission? Because Luo Ji Zi Bo is in heaven, and is a hidden luminary; that is hidden, this is manifest—why so?”

Patriarch said: “Like Northern Dipper lamp rite, Right Assistant star also a hidden luminary, does not want lamp, only eight lamps. Rahu is leftover fire qi; Jidu is leftover earth qi; Moon Bo is leftover metal-water qi; Purple Qi is leftover wood qi. Now only eleven luminary lamps held by four stars, no need for lamps, is fine!”

Deliverance Master said: “Before Han Heavenly Master ascended, said to people: ‘If there is Dipper two sheng of rice, I treat it all as example; like Confucius traveling with bundle, I have never failed to teach.’ Thus called Dipper Rice Master. Now many rely on ‘Deliverance Scripture’ saying: ‘Highest gentleman, capital treasure, covenant heart obeys Heaven and transmits.’ Yet heavily accept bribes, still want to prepare altar rites—why? Because all hard to give up, none more than own wealth, so say food is Heaven, wealth is life. So order them to bring gold and treasures, silk and cloth, only to cut off what is hard to give up, to see true sincerity. If in midst a sprout of greed, then lose original intent!”

Also said: “One altar’s offering weighs on the opening words; if the master has true path reaching spirit, then petitions all reach. Thus at welcoming true start, announce cursing; after sending true, burn words. Last year after welcoming true and announcing words, again bring words out to courtyard to burn. Also, having welcomed true at north, again announce words here, then bring words out and burn—why? This shows master has no lingering thoughts, must be so!”

Patriarch said: “‘Lingbao Jade Mirror’ says: ‘Moving Spirit Treasure Banner’, its color uses calfskin, both sides inscribed with Three Pure Ones’ divine names, banner body inscribed ‘Moving Spirit Treasure Banner’ four characters. Now banner color same, size differs, seal script differs, mistakenly called Moving Spirit Treasure Banner. Also ancient method places two banners inside Five Sufferings Nine Hells lamp wheel; during summoning, also placed before incense music; these two banners both useful. Now not so, placed upright at doorhead, only for show, not knowing use! Like Taiwei Returning Yellow Banner, has banner rite, no spirit order banner, yet has banner rite. Now all do not know why, some grind or banner, almost indistinguishable.”

Also said: “According to Yellow Register law and ritual text, when summoning deceased souls, must make good thoughts to transcend, not wail to harm spirit. Law officers pre-act, warn them; if warning not strict, judge as law. This is true meaning of petitioning the deceased. People love life and hate death, human nature. If not equal in life and death, who can forget death? Only because one thought remains, cannot be liberated. Thus Most High’s deliverance first breaks evil death thought. Now not so, not only cannot forbid wailing, but cleverly allows it, guiding to wail, thus mutual response, confusion worsens.”

Also said: “‘Divine Expanse Five Thunder Great Law’ records: Upper Three Origins Three Heavenly Lords white slips, this is one; Middle Origin golden book, Nine Heavens precious edict, this is one; Lower Origin ascending true deliverance life, leaving birth and death talisman, this is one. Slips, talismans, edicts, registers, though different names, all used by Most High to save sentient beings. Now take the life-giving edict as the edict of the body; white slips and ascending true talismans all listed, given to the deceased. What use do they have?’

Also said: ‘Deliverance and Longevity two talismans, great efficacy. Since called primordial like talisman life, how can they be slight? Thus the Road True Officials petition requests, and when talisman made, secretly carry out Three Officials and Thirty-Six Hells. Now not so; their books never petitioned, their making never secret, all given to others’ hands, and high merit officials not involved! The world says these two talismans have some power to deliver the deceased; each delivery needs one slip, or ten, or hundred, or thousand, or ten thousand, all counted, none missing. I think white slips are wood, red writing vermilion; if white wood and red vermilion can deliver the deceased, then under Nine Springs no one not delivered. Alas! Spirit and clarity depend on the person; if not the person, Dao does not act in vain. If all are truly spiritual and sincere, truly have heart to save and deliver, then even one talisman one slip can deliver ten thousand souls abundantly!’

Also said: ‘According to ‘Ancient Rituals’ and ‘Continued Rituals’ all chapter formats are for later generations to have basis. Now not so; a chapter’s entire text is copied from ancient versions, not daring to change a word. If so, ancient people could all remember their chapter words—would it be difficult? Petitioning, bowing, preserving chapters all one intent. If not so, just say burn petitions is fine! Then entrust generals, talisman officers, merit officials to send. If setting offering petitions, each has its duty, wanting them focused. So mind no distractions, body no affairs, hold origin guard one, like Road True Officials say: after offering seven days, no offering affairs may intervene, only then can be done. Now not so; some go to funerals in morning and send petitions at night; some substitute for master sending petitions without changing name; no choosing date or time, no distinguishing directions, no dividing early or late, no knowing taboos—this hastens heaven’s punishment. Should not be careless!’

Lin Boqian asked: ‘May I ask about ritual teaching?’ Patriarch said: ‘Ancient sages, Dao learning hard to enter, world wants to easily confuse, so set ritual precepts and models to unify external appearance; note concentration methods to correct heart and return; refining qi and embryo origin methods to regulate diet and taste; also prayers to true ones and thanks to cleanse faults. Then proceed to study. No study people reach dark uncle, dwell in loss and loss’s mansion. Accord with non-action, then evil tricks do not open, calm and pure harmony can be attained. Thus scriptures have three registers and seven grades. The three registers: one is Golden Register fasting, to eliminate heavenly disasters, protect country and king, only emperors use. Two is Jade Register fasting, to save people, request blessings and thank faults, only consorts, ministers, and officials use. Three is Yellow Register fasting, to save life and deliver death, pulling out suffering of nine hells, common people use. The seven grades: one is Three Sovereigns fasting, seeking immortality and protecting country. Two is Natural fasting, cultivating truth and learning Dao. Three is Upper Clarity fasting, ascending emptiness entering mystery. Four is Instruction fasting, removing disasters and curing illness. Five is Suffering fasting, repenting and requesting life. Six is Bright Truth fasting, pulling souls from nine hells. Seven is Three Origins fasting, thanking Three Officials’ sins. These fasts may be one day one night, or three days three nights, or seven days seven nights, all according to ritual models. The essence is all have basis. Thus going from Qian to Xun, going in and out all have incantations, preserving spirit and true thought, all thoughts have Law. Sometimes beating ritual drum, sometimes thinking round image, sometimes sending guards to announce, must clarify direction of sending; sometimes request Most High Orthodox True Life Qi, must show place of entering. Yet Dao is in human heart, especially needing petitions; if cannot deeply meet, then manifest according to affairs. The human heart has no substance, moves with environment; environment pure then heart clear; heart clear then conduct pure; conduct pure then can communicate with spirits; heart clear then can meet Heavenly Dao. Thus ascending altar to announce covenant, yellow petition to report, so heart and form both exhausted, human and spirit meet. Heard saying: ten thousand volumes of elixir books not as good as guarding one. I also say: ten thousand ritual books not as good as guarding one. If you know to guard one, then can follow its end to find its root, follow its coarse to enter its essence; otherwise only decorate outside, noisy and ornate, like child’s play, farther from Dao! How to reach true and spiritual?’  

Lin Boqian asked: ‘How about offering ceremony?’ Patriarch said: ‘Anciently, the Dao of communicating with spirits begins with sincerity; later sincerity lacking, so prepare things as ceremony. If sincerity is present and things prepared, still can be said. If things not prepared, greatest disrespect! Scripture says: ‘You may offer water and flowers, why seek others?’ Scripture also says: ‘Like worldly ceremony, now all offerings, only no shame is enough!’ Otherwise all are disrespectful, must beware!’  

Deliverance Master said: ‘According to Jade Mandate Heavenly Article, when setting offering, may not offer true paper money, great profanation. Anciently though had netherworld utensils, no paper money; until late Han had paper money, used to sacrifice ghosts and spirits of middle and lower realms, allowed. Using it to offer to heavenly true ones, is it proper? The greedy in world, though body goes through Taiyin, one thought remains; as ‘Ten Thousand Light Repentance’ says, what is lacking is worldly wealth, so paper money’s transformation aims to break this thought.’

Also said: ‘In ritual teaching, regarding lamps, says Dipper moves in central heaven, truly governs human disasters and blessings, life and death authority, thus must urgently report, none not respond. If able to perform offering, follow secret offering rites, or Hetu offering rites, pray and bless as heart wishes. Now some celebrate deity’s birthday and close lamps; some close lamps due to illness; truly do not know lamp closing’s subtlety.’

Patriarch said: ‘Nowadays all know name of cave altar, yet do not know why named so. According to ancient system, altar decorated with vermilion, holding Three Caves precious scriptures on top, thus called cave altar. All petitions relate before altar. Now not so; only have altar, no vermilion decoration, still acceptable; precious writings offered all on top, still acceptable. Worse, mix various things on top, some use it to burn incense, some to announce petitions, to get close to imperial presence. Yet Heaven is high and hears low, no distance unheard; if say to get close to emperor, are petitions unheard? How know narrow full space, spirits vast, one thought sprouts, Three Realms all know, what difference distance or height?’

Also said: ‘Offering rite’s head is called water decree, to cleanse filth. Later generations hold it unchanging, until after three or nine mornings, at offering start then cleanse filth. If so, during three or nine mornings, filth not cleansed, can offer true? If say statues set, no filth, why cleanse water at offering start? I think, at start of affairs, cleanse water; environment clear then heart bright; heart bright then conduct pure; conduct pure then can communicate with spirits; heart bright then can unite with Heaven. After cleansing water, then incense blessing, inviting master to court true, all proceed in order!’

Purple Pot Xie Xiandao asked: ‘What is the main point of Gang steps?’ Deliverance Master said: ‘You heard master say: generally Gang steps mostly use five steps to push overcoming, steps like cat and dog crouching on snake; advance five steps, retreat five steps; advance seven, retreat seven; four directions follow Five Phases numbers, until snake crouches then harms. Look at crouching mouse too. Thus say shaman steps mostly Yu; Yu steps only five, able to harmonize Five Phases, long-lasting rising. Like Eight Gates Escape, Taiyi Six Ren, Gu Xu methods, main point is Gang steps. Also nowadays people step Kui and tread Dipper, how know great taboo exists? Scripture says: ‘If you want to ascend true, do not touch True Man.’ True Man is third star.’

Also said: ‘If you want to summon spirits, do not block Heaven’s gate. Heaven’s gate is Wenqu star. All Dipper stepping methods must avoid breaking rules and violating order; like foot crossing horizontally is breaking rules; foot mistakenly stepping forward is violating order. When breaking or violating, immediately apologize to star head, then okay!’

Purple Xuan Zhao Mufu asked: ‘What about so-called Yin Dipper and Yang Dipper?’ Deliverance Master said: ‘I once heard from master: after Winter Solstice, from Kui begins Yang Dipper; after Summer Solstice, from Pi begins Yin Dipper. First step Yang Dipper, then step Yin Dipper, called Fire Water not yet complete; first step Yin Dipper, then step Yang Dipper, called Water Fire completed. Nowadays people start left foot at first star, recite Kui to Pi, call Yang Dipper; right foot start at first star, recite Tan to Po, call Yin Dipper. Wrong! Baseless theory. ‘Flying Spirit Visits Dipper Scripture’ says: forward is Yang, reverse is Yin; from Kui to Pi is forward; from Pi to Kui is reverse. Main point: ‘If you want to fly spirit, do not offend True Man third star.’ Outside this all Ding steps.’

Boqian asked: ‘There are five La; what do they mean?’ Patriarch said: ‘First day of first month is Heavenly La; on this day Five Emperors gather nine qi in eastern blue heaven; this is Heavenly Pengdu primordial spirit opening the great emperor’s mansion. Fifth day of fifth month is Earthly La; on this day Five Emperors gather three qi in southern cinnabar heaven; this is sudden fire law great god entering Divine Expanse Jade Pure Mansion. Seventh day of seventh month is Dao Virtue La; on this day Five Emperors gather seven qi in western white heaven; this is Heavenly You deputy marshal opening the great light void mansion. First day of tenth month is People Year La; Five Emperors gather five qi in northern mysterious heaven; this is Great Marshal Yisheng opening Jingdan heaven mansion. Twelfth month’s La day is Prince and Marquis La; on this day Five Emperors gather myriad qi in upper mysterious jade capital; this is Mysterious Warrior Great Marshal opening harmonious transfer inspection mansion. These five days are days Five Emperors gather, five gods open mansions, called Five La!’

Patriarch said: ‘You have heard old already! Han Lu Jia was Jade Pure Primordial Master, chief Immortal Supreme True, leading Yellow Register Court affairs. Xin Hanchen now is Thunder Capital Department’s Wolf Tooth Fierce Officer. Jin Tao Hongjing now is Penglai Capital Water Department supervisor. Tang Chu Suiliang now is Five Thunder Officer. Yan Zhenqing now is Northern Pole Exorcising Court left judge. Li Yangbing now is Northern Pole Exorcising Court right judge. Li Bai now is East Splendor Upper Clarity Clear Master. Bai Letian now is Penglai long immortal chief. Also Jin female immortal Wei Huacun now is Purple Void Primordial Lord, leading immortal rank. Tang female immortal Xie Ziran now is East Extreme Perfected One. Who are they? Should not be negligent!’

Also said: ‘According to Divine Expanse Jade Mandate: Registers call Primordial Life Perfected One, meaning practicing Orthodox Unity Dao, commanding self to cultivate primordial life to obtain truth. How can commoners take Perfected One as title, openly misusing, even to petitions? Must restrain self and reflect on cultivation; if no Perfected One conduct, yet write Perfected One title, sin reaches nine ancestors, Heaven’s pardon not granted. Only allowed to call bestowed supreme register, below called law title, not register title; same as common people bestowed, called disciple.’

Xiandao asked: ‘Recently heard Universal Penetration method, secretly doubted. Their method seal round inside square outside, with Five Phases inside, Eight Trigrams outside, Departments and Courts arranged at four sides, taking Lingbao Universal Penetration as sect, Mixed Transformation Profound Secret as root. They gather various method talismans and incantations, creating one family, calling it Universal Penetration Great Method. True Master approve?’ He said: ‘Spirit has no shape, so round; qi has no body, so penetrating. Ancient Universal Penetration teaching is spirit and qi mixed, entering and exiting emptiness, returning to chaos. If now made with forms, vessels, trigrams, numbers, how far from true Universal Penetration!’

Patriarch said: ‘Han Heavenly Master said: if person can keep six roots pure, square inch clear, long practice, can sit and command ghosts and spirits, call and summon thunder and rain. Nowadays practitioners do not base on Dao, do not trace heart; people self master, family self learning, taking light attachment and possession as marvel, taking shadow traces and dreams as wonderful; summoned generals have thousands of names; their supplemented offices are Perfected One officers and ministers. Some mix master and shaman’s secrets with orthodox law; some use ghost and immortal descending brush and call it secret transmission; ask them, answer ‘according to ritual’; distinguish, hold as true transmission. Ha! Evil masters err, not sentient beings’ fault, one blind leads many, confusing transmission with confusion. Alas!’

Deliverance Master discussed with Purple Pivot about talisman water, saying seekers not all sincere; some try to seek, I also tried to give, often no effect.

Patriarch heard and said: ‘Do not take false to give true; as for effect or no effect, that is other matter.’

Patriarch also said: ‘Do not ask spirit or no spirit, effect or no effect, casually act and leave, do not raise any thought.’

Deliverance Master told Boqian: ‘Your master governs Bi Zhi Peace; I now govern Crane Forest Peace; you now govern Purple Light Peace. Generally, those who serve the Law and establish incense fire places must petition for peace plaques. Like Han Heavenly Master’s twenty-four peace mansions, ancient thirty-six peace huts, Xu Jingyang’s seven peace, all so! Peace and governance law says: common people’s homes called peace; master’s homes called governance.’

Patriarch said: ‘Building altar and setting offering is actually one. Some say Heaven has no floating clouds, four qi bright and clear, rivers and seas silent, mountains swallow smoke, sun and moon do not move, celestial wheels stop, upper and lower open, two instruments harmonize. At this time, myriad spirits and true ones meet in darkness, so at offering and petition time, must be so. But opening words, bowing words, welcoming true and descending saint, meet this sky color, also seems responsive. If say to pull lost souls and deliver spirits, must have yin rain then possible. If say to remove disasters and cross calamities, must have clear brightness then possible. Thus all offerings and rites follow this.’

Deliverance Master told Xiandao: ‘I once heard master say: Lao Dan has three treasures: one is compassion, two is frugality, three is not daring to be first in the world. Xu Jingyang has eight treasures: loyalty, filial piety, integrity, caution, generosity, tolerance. Lü Dongbin has four treasures: no delusion one, no greed two, utmost sincerity three, guarding one four. Chen Niwan has five treasures: one is wisdom, two is faith, three is benevolence, four is courage, five is solemnity. Facing affairs many changes, making people unpredictable is wisdom; focused and steadfast guarding one is faith; helping people and benefiting things, forgiving all is benevolence; handling affairs decisively, heart firm is courage; cautious not laughing, grave and self-controlled is solemnity. Eastern barbarian thunder is benevolent, can bring wind and rain, nourish myriad things. Southern barbarian thunder is courageous, proclaiming orders, rewarding good and punishing evil. Western barbarian thunder is solemn, killing original qi, thunder and lightning move. Northern barbarian thunder is wise, hiding Kan position, rising when time comes. Central barbarian thunder is faithful, four seasons all hidden, orders not rashly sent. This is the secret of heart transmission. True within has spirit, sincerity outside no law.’

Patriarch said: ‘A wood a span long, placed on ground, people step on and have surplus; a wood a chi long, placed on pole end, people crouch on and not steady; not that things have size, but heart has emptiness and fullness. Fierce tiger walks, grass and trees bow; poisonous viper angry, earth and stone upheave; spirit complete then power great, essence complete then qi strong. Shooting like tiger, see tiger not stone; slaying violent flood dragon, not see water. At such time, eyes seeing not all, ears hearing not all; this is spirit using form Dao. Heart not doubting hand, hand not doubting brush, forget hand and brush then know writing Dao. To cleanse filth must summon Five Emperors’ qi; to subdue snake must command Five Stars’ essence. If summon and command not come, how to do? Spirit is like mother, qi like child; spirit summons qi, mother summons child, how dare not come?’

Deliverance Master said: ‘Once a great monk’s poem: “One pond lotus leaves endless clothes, several pine trees yellow food abundant; just known by world where I dwell, mountain monk today moved again.” Another immortal cultivator also wrote a quatrain: “Hungry eat saliva under tongue still full, cold fire in elixir field warms; naturally have own livelihood, better seek me not seek others.” Such two poems can reduce body and mouth’s turbid schemes.’

Patriarch said: ‘True cultivators set their will with sincerity, practice with bitter discipline, think deeply to penetrate response, forget self to meet truth. If able so, scripture says: universe is in hand, myriad transformations in body. Also says: if person always pure and quiet, Heaven and Earth all return. People may not know this; able to find stillness in noise, clarity in turbid, make equal view, end all thoughts, move without obstruction, gain great peace and joy—this is called Dao. If not so, gazing at stars and worshiping Dipper also fine; reciting scriptures and chanting incantations also fine; I do not know!’

Also said: ‘I heard former master say: ancient immortals and sages passed mouth to mouth, no writing. Now in world I write and record; those who awaken can transmit holy Dao; those who do not awaken, no gain. To awaken holy Dao, no ancient no present. Departing not ancient, coming not present. What can be transmitted is called affairs, not Dao. Dao originally has no transmission, Dao has no sound or color, Dao has no form, Dao has no ancient or present, Dao has no coming or going.’

Also said: ‘Practicing Law is like being official; cultivating Dao is like hiding and retiring.’

Also said: ‘Guest came asking about Twelve Merit Officers, thus explained: Heavenly Gang belongs to Chen, Chen, Xu, Chou, Wei, called Four Corrects, because belong to earth, located in center, so called Four Corrects. Gang character from four and correct; Chen is earth, so this merit officer called Heavenly Gang. Taiyi belongs to Si, Si is thunder gate, also called wind gate; water mouth also is Nine Heavens Taiyi Ten Gods’ position, so this merit officer called Taiyi. Shengguang belongs to Wu, Wu is Li brightness, originally not Shengguang but Tengguang. Small auspicious belongs to Wei, great auspicious belongs to Chou, all heavenly noble gods. Jia, Wu, Geng are three heavenly wonders, with ox and sheep as noble, so great and small auspicious both noble gods. Transmission belongs to Shen, Shen is Kun, Kun is earth door, earth door is cloud, cloud meets heaven, so transmission follows Kui belongs to You. Cong character is departing tone, means follow; follow because beside Xu Kui, so called follow Kui. He Kui belongs to Xu, Xu Hai is river source, Xu is heavenly river, so Kui god named He Kui. Dengming belongs to Hai, Hai is heavenly gate. Shenhou belongs to Zi, Zi belongs to Kan, Kan is yin queen, so heavenly queen called Shenhou. Yin is merit officer, Yin is Gen, Kun and Gen both earth, Gen is mountain, Kun is earth, mountain and marsh communicate qi, so Gen Kun are cloud meeting, thus Yin and Shen are merit officers and transmission gods. Dachong belongs to Mao, Mao is thunder, thunder god called Tianchong. ‘Deliverance Scripture’ says: ‘Throw fire ten thousand li lightning, flow bell eight chong thunder.’ Though these are twelve merit officers, truly heavenly emperor’s arms and legs.’

## The Recorded Sayings of the Perfected One Hai Qiongbai, Volume Three

Recorded by disciples Yan Hu and Ye Guxi et al.

### Wuyi Ascending the Hall

This one incense petal, before chaos divided, first sprout, Dragon River new origin first branch and leaf. No yin-yang, earth dragon coils, tiger crouches, gaining rain from outside Qian Kun, wind blows. On Kunlun mountain no medicine flower, by Hua Pond water no shadow. Thick smoke not color, permeates Taiqing top door, auspicious haze silent, transforms into Primordial Venerable’s nostril. Holding it breaks demons’ courage; burning it makes music and wind roar. Thus know Shakyamuni personally planted, Confucius unconcerned to pick, all Taiji undivided qi, is void immortal root. Heat toward furnace, respectfully for former sages and masters, speak and breathe out. Above pray one person has celebration, myriad nations all peaceful, six palaces all cultivated, hundred officials timely. Everywhere Heaven and Earth is Great Luo holy realm, all mountains and rivers become Profound Capital Jade Capital. No immortal cultivator knows constant high scholar, doubts not cleared, wisdom not opened, saints and sages share one eye, wise and foolish open thirty tongues to ask. So called array three mysterious halberds, spread eight extreme bows and spears, seeing righteousness if not act, what courage is there!

Tian Gu asked: ‘Great Dao originally nameless, why then have lead and mercury?’ Master answered: ‘Manifesting formless form is Dao’s dragon and tiger; revealing nameless name is Dao’s lead and mercury.’ Asked again: ‘Among five metals, silver taken from lead; among eight stones, mercury taken from sand. How to cultivate internal elixir?’ Answer: ‘Silver from lead, mercury from sand, inside body heart yin inside yang.’

Xue Yan asked: ‘Medicines have floating sinking, clear turbid; fire timing has drawing adding advancing retreating; use in host guest; life and prosperity in punishment virtue. How is this principle?’ Master answered: ‘All day picking great medicine, where to distinguish floating sinking? All day practicing fire timing, who knows advancing retreating? Five phases all present no generating overcoming; four images harmonize time no host guest.’

Asked again: ‘Front string back string, metal number water number, two eighty-six for one jin, which medicine to pick? Where to cook and refine?’ Answer: ‘Front string metal number, back string water number, pick one jin cook one jin.’

Xi Weng asked: ‘Master points what taught is Great Dao; disciple teaches Golden Elixir. Not clear if Great Dao and Golden Elixir same or different?’ Master answered: ‘Crossing river needs raft, arriving shore no need boat.’

Asked: ‘Golden Elixir study depends on medicine first, medicine use depends on fire timing. What is medicine? What is fire timing?’ Master answered: ‘Medicine yang inside yin, fire timing yin inside yang, grasp yin yang meaning, great medicine in one place detailed.’

Gu An asked: ‘True lead true mercury, true tiger true dragon, what are these? Ding Gong Huang Po, infant lovers, what use?’ Master answered: ‘Grasp originally three two one, do not follow former one two three.’

Asked: ‘Lead belongs north, why say metal lead? Mercury belongs south, why say wood mercury?’ Answer: ‘Woman wears blue clothes, man wears white silk.’

Xiao Quan asked: ‘Dragon roar tiger howl, neither mouth nor nose; husband sings wife follows, not in heart kidney. Mercury not Li, lead not Kan, Dui not tiger, Zhen not dragon. Lost in confusion, wish to seek elixir secret.’ Master answered: ‘Kan Li think heart and kidney, Zhen Dui do not seek lung and liver, grasp yin yang two words, natural couple tiger dragon coil.’

Asked: ‘Spittle essence saliva qi blood fluid, Zhongli says belongs yin; saliva essence blood brain qi spirit, Wang Ding mercury seven returns. Not clear how to understand?’ Answer: ‘Chiseling stone finds jade.’

Mo An asked: ‘Golden Elixir not complete, how have dragon and tiger? Golden Elixir complete, how no dragon and tiger?’ Master answered: ‘Begin with something no one knows, until formless has place known.’

Asked: ‘Full hall all guests, who is host?’ Answer: ‘One word two words heavy, thousand saints cannot bear.’

Yan Hu asked: ‘Golden Elixir Dao in I Ching is Qian Kun Kan Li; in heaven Dipper, ladle, sun and moon; in elixir dragon tiger water fire; in medicine lead silver sand mercury; in person husband wife man woman; all just yin yang two words. I know! What is Tai Ji true earth?’ Master answered: ‘Thousand peaks reach mountain edge and stop, ten thousand vibrations sound return sea and vanish.’

Qian Yun asked: ‘Those who want to refine Golden Elixir must understand yin yang, deeply know creation, then can chase two qi on Yellow Path, gather three natures in Primordial Palace, drill and cluster Five Phases, harmonize Four Images. How is Golden Elixir’s meaning?’ Master answered: ‘Gold is Heaven’s killing mechanism; elixir is virtual with image.’

Asked: ‘Great Dao originally no thing, how to metaphor?’ Answer: ‘Talking river hard to quench thirst.’

Asked: ‘Great Dao one principle, how have distinctions?’ Answer: ‘Drawing cake does not fill hunger.’

Asked: ‘Can say like jade in stone not opened, today suddenly shining bright?’ Answer: ‘Clear wind and bright moon, saints and sages all receive grace.’

Holding the thread said:  
Great Dao formless, great elixir colorless,  
Movement within stillness, stillness within movement,  
Movement still as is,  
No inside has,  
Has inside no,  
Has no silent silent.  
Grasp then no confusion or awakening,  
Fail then eyes have saint and mundane.  
So Wei Boyang’s river earth lovers,  
Xu Jingyang’s iron boat on water,  
Zhongli Quan’s golden liquid return elixir,  
Liu Haichan’s jade flower true water.  
Thus moon full moon wanes not leave water,  
Bud buys cloud comes how block Heaven.

Closing seat said:  
Thus formerly Pilin Xue Perfected One understood Chan sect great matter,  
Then met Apricot Forest Perfected One piercing nostrils,  
So-called thousand voids not broad one truth.  
Zhang Ziyang said:  
All day walking never walking,  
All day sitting never sitting,  
Can say pity child not knowing ugly.  
Now no one sees ‘Awakening Truth Chapter’ in walking sitting?  
Even if see, not know Zhang Pingshu.  
People like fish drinking water, cold warm self know,  
Still know Xue Perfected One understood Chan sect,  
How again stuck in Golden Elixir mold wrap forehead?  
If know break, no two Dao in world, no two hearts in sage.  
If not know break, call attendant once, attendant answers,  
Master says: ‘Have you eaten porridge this morning?’  
Attendant says: ‘Eaten porridge.’  
Master says: ‘Good things not for full people to eat.’

### Pingjiang Crane Meeting Ascending the Hall

After incense blessing Q&A, master said:  
Stop asking, questions endless, answers endless.  
One question one answer, what use?  
Even with flowing river debate, how compare its dazzling subtlety?  
All are flying dust words, none imitate its essence.  
Do people still know?  
Chaos not divided at first, what difference in qi and image?  
Today before parents born, one life study done,  
From two Zhou’s end, begin three teachings.  
Confucius has three vehicles and four hooves,  
Laozi has three caves and four auxiliaries.  
Confucius teaching only one word sincerity.  
Buddha teaching only one word stability.  
Laozi only clear quiet.  
So person can always clear quiet, Heaven and Earth all return.  
In Confucius, see: ‘I once all day no food, all night no sleep, all day like fool, three months not violate benevolence, nurture my vast qi, think constantly, then nearly often empty.’ Surely!  
For Dao learning, how to reach Yao Shun?  
Make customs pure?  
In Buddha, see: ‘Two six times, constant light appears, wall stands ten thousand ren, like hen brooding eggs, always warm qi unbroken, dense and continuous, no interruption.’  
So called ‘at cliff clear hand, willing to bear, no rebirth no revival, cheat lord not.’ Surely!  
For Chan, see: ‘Linji enters gate and shouts; no reason in loud voice.’  
Deshan enters gate and hits, beating grass only to scare snake.  
In Laozi, see: ‘Understand yin yang, deeply reach creation, chase two qi on Yellow Path, gather three natures in Primordial Palace, cluster Five Phases, harmonize Four Images, dragon roar tiger howl, husband sings wife follows, jade cauldron soup boil, golden furnace fire blaze, timing complete, shed body spirit transform, work succeed fame complete, body outside body.’ Surely!  
For immortal study, how to lead white tiger home to raise, produce bright pearl like full moon?  
Are three teachings same or different?  
Do not know what year to say?  
Until now laugh not stop.

Master again said:  
Sun and moon like shuttle, time like arrow,  
Willow thread leads spring away,  
Lotus coin buys summer wind.  
Follow morning open bamboo shoot kitchen,  
Buddha makes wax people,  
Ten continents three islands all cloud tube moon build flow,  
Four seas five lakes all rain hat smoke cloak guests,  
Infinite dust midst, scattered saints many;  
Beyond things high immortals, saints and sages cohabit.  
Hidden and manifest unknowable,  
Record thanks not written.

Closing seat said:  
In Song Jiading fourteenth year, Xiu Yi records moon feeling and Heaven,  
Lake mountain already repaid Wulin debt,  
Wind moon again tie Gusu green.  
Gusu that month fourteenth, four groups jointly hold Pure Yang meeting,  
Pure Yang Perfected One born this day,  
Drifting beach old immortal travel record.  
I heard Tang Lü Chunchang, master is Zhongli Zi Yunfang,  
Personally transmitted golden liquid return elixir secret,  
Attained Dao time traveled Jingxiang.  
Do people still know Pure Yang?  
Crane neck turtle jaw body dirt.  
Sometimes grind mirror in market,  
Sometimes sell ink on street,  
Sometimes called surname Tian or Hui,  
Jiangkou Jingkou come and go.  
Once carried two jars past Lufu,  
Again blew double flute to Tiantai,  
Blue hat red robe long drink,  
Sleeve has blue snake awe-inspiring.  
Hongdu delivered to West Mountain Shi,  
Shuchuan delivered to East Forest Shen,  
Morning tour hundred Yue evening three Hao,  
Form spirit gather disperse instantly have no.  
Tea transmission Guo Shangzao,  
Wine wrapped alchemy He Xiangu,  
Sometimes wear white railing sometimes paper jacket,  
One sword across sky several times fall.  
Laugh and return to Touzi Mountain,  
One phrase breaks Yellow Dragon old,  
Taiping Temple old poem,  
Three times enter Yueyang know or not.  
Dusk Wuyi brush clothes leave,  
Midnight Jun Mountain play moon return,  
Drunk fall mad song song then dance,  
One game evening money how ancient.  
Clear wind bright moon Yellow Crane Tower,  
White duck red reed Pen River shore,  
That year drink one jade tablet,  
Who believes no middle nurtured child.  
Empty remain all methods eighteen secrets,  
Not willing lightly tell to him.  
Former thrice lament no success,  
Said father is Lü counselor,  
Bag inside auspicious pact no medicine silver,  
Beyond Heaven roam riding sword qi,  
Master sword method no one transmits,  
Thousand changes ten thousand forms always sudden.  
Heaven will between living beings strange,  
April Pure Yang trigram belongs Qian,  
Take Jiang Kan draw Gui Li abdomen,  
Transform into pure Qian Yang qi full.  
Thus can govern qi transform flying dragon,  
Where pass deliver people leave strange traces.  
Pingjiang this meeting different from other places,  
Only this year again unusual,  
Past years meeting often ●蠁,  
Cloud top immortal crane daily soar,  
Now order wild man ascend this seat,  
Cannot avoid from head to say break.  
Must grasp Pure Yang heart,  
Then worthy to learn Pure Yang Dao.  
Dao can Dao, how to learn?  
Gather earth for incense not true,  
Knowing friend has Zhang Tianjue.

### East Tower Small Meditation

Gate disciple Purple Orange Zi Zhao Jiang recorded

Supreme Dao is in heart, heart is Dao, six roots inside and outside, same wind and light. Inside things shift, eventually old death, primordial and silent movement, can attain longevity. Thus form takes heart as lord, heart is spirit’s dwelling; heart peaceful then spirit spiritual, heart wild then spirit mad. Empty heart and righteous qi condense,淡 heart then yang harmony gathers, blood qi not obstructed, naturally flowing, will and thought no action, myriad greens naturally rest. Heart sorrow then yin qi condenses, heart joy then yang qi disperses, thought arises then spirit flees, thought stays then spirit escapes. One’s whole body, heart’s spirit, issues from eyes and can see; seeing long then heart spirit leaves, not due to greed losing heart. Kidney essence issues from ears and can hear; hearing long then kidney essence dries, not due to lust damaging kidney. Liver soul issues from nose and can smell; smelling long then liver soul scatters, not due to anger harming liver. Gall corporeal soul issues from mouth and can speak; speaking long then gall corporeal soul dies, not due to rashness harming gall. Dao’s essence is utmost stillness to condense spirit, fine thought to penetrate response, fasting to answer truth, compassion to complete merit, humility to keep sincerity. Heart no distractions, thought not wandering, heart always returns to one, thought naturally calm, one heart serene, four elements clear and comfortable. Heart not in ear, who makes sound? Heart not in eye, who makes color? Heart not in nose, who makes fragrance? Heart not in mouth, who makes words? Qi gathers then full, spirit harmonizes then warm. So Dao heart is qi’s lord, qi is form’s root, form is qi’s house, spirit is form’s tool. Spirit is nature, qi is life. Heart still then qi correct; correct then whole; qi whole then spirit harmonizes; harmonized then condenses; spirit condenses then myriad treasures form! Shi Jianwu said: ‘Qi stays then spirit stays, spirit stays then form stays. Must forget feelings to complete nature. Nature complete then form self complete, qi also complete, Dao must complete. Dao complete then spirit flourishes, qi is efficacious, form can transcend, nature can penetrate. Return and circulate, unite with Dao. Above from Tian Gu, below to Yin end, two scenes meet, form one piece. So long no question of break, transformation in me, united with Dao.’ Or say heart moves then spirit tires, heart still then spirit dulls; one moves one still, then not get; no move no still, also not get; then how? Beautiful like Xi Zi leaving Golden Palace, lovely like Yang Fei descending Jade Tower, daily with you drunk under flowers, still dislike where not elegant.

Also

True Master showed Lu a verse:  
In Three Families village yellow three aunt,  
At third watch turn body lose pillow,  
Hit Ah Jia’s nostril head,  
Tomorrow rise seek oyster silver.  
Ha! Spring people drink spring wine,  
Spring stick hits spring ox.

Lu asked: ‘Is this return root and restore life Dao principle?’ Master said: ‘Parents born mouth, never for child speak.’ Lu asked again: ‘How is this principle?’ Master said: ‘Iron shovel head apricot flower red.’

Lu asked: ‘Not sure still some accord?’ Master said: ‘Yesterday street two firewood sellers, beaten broken front teeth. Why do you defend him?’ Lu said: ‘Eh! Just so.’ Master said: ‘Try to say.’ Lu recited: ‘Iron steamed bun head apricot flower red, four sides exquisite everywhere connected, stepping on weighing hammer hard as iron, New Luo only at sea gate east.’

### Winter Solstice Small Meditation

Within body one treasure, hidden in elixir field, light as dense mist, faint as flying smoke. From Mud Pellet above to Yongquan below, sometimes gathering sometimes dispersing, sometimes square sometimes round. Large as sun wheel, five colors bright clouds, surface clear and transparent, revolving left and right. Hard as iron, soft as cotton, swift as lightning, tight as bowstring. Weighs over one jin, flies over three thousand, meets yin enters earth, meets yang ascends heaven. Golden elder picks mercury, lover catches lead, use according to timing, then inner cooking and refining. After Winter Solstice, before Summer Solstice, golden cauldron boils, jade furnace fire burns, dragon roars East Mountain, tiger howls West River, Yellow Po inactive, Ding Gong silent. Husband and wife in body, cloud and rain mingle. Heavenly Yi produces water, in clear source, Li Ji Kan Wu, taking earth first. Earth contains fire, marvel in heart transmission, like dragon nurturing pearl, waves hold jade abyss, like hen brooding eggs, warm qi continuous, magnet attracts iron, naturally connected. Flower stalk contains fruit, core qi complete, rice flower forms ear, dew medicine round. Yin yang creation, myriad things no bias, humans and myriad things initially no ugliness or beauty. Keep method, Heaven and Earth equal year; not keep but keep, like one thing exists, wind returns mixed, green grass lush, within changes, myriad saints thousand sages. Begin from Kan, end at Qian, Mao You bathe, advance retreat draw add. Have civil and martial, can mold and shape
