# Records of the Hall of Joyous Nurturing

## Preface to the Sayings of Master Huang Yuanji

The book *Sayings* was originally a text that Master Huang Yuanji taught in the Hall of Joyous Nurturing, conveying the heart-method. It was never lightly disclosed. Why then is it now made public? It is because the turning of the era has entered the Lower Origin; human hearts have grown cunning and treacherous to the utmost, the world’s path sinks ever deeper into ruin, and no one arises to speak the study of returning to the root and clearing the source. The great Dao grows obscure, and none know where it lies. Master himself came in response to the time from Fengcheng, setting his tent here for more than ten years. Whenever annotating the *Heart Awakening Classic*, the *Heart Seeking Classic*, or the *Dao De Jing*, he would always expound to disciples the principles of cultivating both nature and life, the original unity of Heaven and Man—nothing left unexplained or unexpressed. His intention was to nurture talents: upward to inherit the orthodox transmission of the sages past, downward to initiate the heart-transmission for later students. Why then fear that the supreme Dao will not be illuminated?

Though the books of Confucius and Mencius also encompass the study of nature and life, their teachings lie hidden and unspoken, so readers have no way to comprehend them. Only this *Sayings* is of utmost profundity, yet its words are clear and plain, step by step drawing one into its charm. For those who cultivate the True, if they take this as a ladder and vessel, it will not be difficult to reach the highest level and fulfill our Master’s intent of universal salvation. Each chapter warns again and again, repeats and urges with painstaking care. If there are records of friends’ faults, it is not to conceal them, but because all share these illnesses; by comparing and correcting, one should resolve to renew oneself. If there are records of friends’ virtues, it is not boasting, but to show that all can become so, reflecting inward and encouraging diligent progress. Moreover, this *Sayings* speaks of all things and covers all matters. Those who speak of life’s work will find here the key points; those who discuss nature’s study will know what to grasp and preserve; those who talk of cause and effect, retribution and reward, will see the importance of inner weight over outer, cultivating virtue and practicing benevolence. Its benefit to human hearts and customs is by no means shallow or rare.

Yet the disciples taught are many, arriving at different times; the questions asked are often the same, so the answers inevitably repeat. Readers must grasp the meaning, not cling to the words, so as to gain for body and mind. If one dwells on brush strokes and characters, one will miss the mark far away.

Some say: “This book reveals Heaven’s secrets fully; it should not be lightly transmitted.” Do they not know that what is peeled to the extreme must return, what is exhausted to the end must revert? This is the natural course of qi and fate—nothing strange. Moreover, if it is not urgently explained now, when the turning comes to the Upper Origin, who then will support the Dao’s lineage as sages? We who compile the *Sayings* do not do so out of fondness, but out of necessity. We earnestly hope that those who follow will jointly elucidate the great Dao of the Three Teachings, so as not to fail our Master’s intention of complete salvation with the golden needle. Now that the book is completed and made public to all under Heaven and future generations, each should treasure it and not neglect it because it is easy to obtain. Thus this preface.

### Preface One

I once had in my chest an old abridged version of the *Records of the Hall of Joyous Nurturing*, thinking it an ordinary text for exhorting the world, and at first did not pay it much heed. When asked to print and circulate it, I consented to wait for a future time to collate and verify it, remaining indifferent. In the summer of the year of the Water Monkey, Lord Liu Yunting returned from Shu with the original two volumes, requesting me to examine and approve them again. Also due to other matters, I did not hasten to engage. Later, arriving at Tongde Hall, I saw on Lord Qu Yuechuan’s desk this book, and he told me, “It is very good.” I casually flipped through it; its first volume’s discourse on the way of yang birth pleased my heart greatly. It said:

“The way of yang birth is nothing other than coming without thought or worry. Just like a chaste maiden or loyal widow, steadfast and unshaken, who upon encountering evil would rather sacrifice life than betray righteousness. Or like loyal ministers and martyrs who follow only righteousness; if disaster arises unexpectedly, they are willing to give their lives to endure calamity. This is true yang birth. Otherwise, why would one be unyielding despite a hundred setbacks? From this we infer that in all daily conduct and common practice, every good deed and righteous act, when done just right and proper, there is no lack of joy and inspiration. These are all signs of yang birth. Or when reading books and reciting poetry, suddenly all selfish desires vanish, leaving only a single spirit; this too is a facet of yang birth. Or when friends gather and converse, hearts open and laughter flows, suddenly yang qi soars and true potential bursts forth; this too is a path of yang birth. Further, in qin, chess, calligraphy, painting, fishing, woodcutting, farming, and reading, if one truly follows nature and acts according to innate nature, without seeking or desiring, there is none who does not enjoy leisure and contentment, forgetting cares; these are all images of yang birth. The essential point is: one moves and immediately feels, one feels and immediately withdraws, so that the spirit has no external longing, the qi retains its delicate beauty, and the elixir is not difficult to grow; why then fear the fetus and infant will not thrive? Most importantly, know that where there is yang, there is life; where there is no yang, there is death. From this insight one understands that yang is the Dao, and Dao is emptiness and naturalness. Zisi said, ‘The Dao is not to be separated even for a moment.’ Is this not the teaching of gathering and restraining yang light, allowing not a single bit to leak? The various masters have profound insight; therefore I show it as pervasive as the sky and earth, through all ages and times, the true primordial yang that is never absent. But if this is shown to beginners, it will instead leave them no path to enter.”

Such words are indeed a penetrating insight into the source of the Dao, unlike the petty family theories, or those who die at the sentence’s end, or those who follow others’ words without understanding. Especially not the wild guesses of those without teacher transmission. Thus I read the rest, each chapter true and clear, regretting our late meeting. I also heard Sun Haibo say, “My Master, the Ancient Elder, said this book speaks of the work too plainly, and should not be widely transmitted.” Its value can thus be roughly seen. Therefore I collated the final chapters and met with Lord Liu to discuss its content. Lord Liu then gathered funds and entrusted the humble servant to write this preface, specially noting the cause and condition.

Moreover, I have heard that in ancient times great virtuous ones seeking the Dao often abandoned all family wealth, left wife and children, carried their books for thousands of miles, journeyed for decades without meeting a single master. Even upon meeting, they had to endure great hardship and torment for a long time. The teachings given were but one or two words, which, when deeply absorbed, suddenly brought enlightenment. This is the so-called ‘one in ten thousand’ attainment; ‘one hundred, ten thousand’—the ignorant, the bright, the gentle, the strong—are all thus. The difficulty of seeking, hearing, and practicing the Dao is such. Yet sometimes it is otherwise: no need for utmost reverence, no need for distant seeking, no need for hardship, no need for long waiting, no need to face north and call oneself disciple; yet the high Dao master, pouring out a lifetime’s heart and supreme heavenly secrets, writes them down in a book and gives it to a person, who then either shelves it high or counts its value by hairs and refuses to buy, missing the chance; or skims it like a galloping horse, passing it by in person—this happens repeatedly. Thus what is easily gotten is easily lost; what is long formed is long secure. The ancients said: “This matter is most profound and subtle; I worry for your scant fortune and hard to dispel.” Also: “A fruit without cause will not come to be.” With modern people’s inability to discern true from false, seeing the small and forgetting the great, I cannot help but speak. I have also heard: a chicken, when feeding, three or five grains suffice to fill its crop and satisfy its pecking, but if too much is given, it scatters all over the ground; a monkey, when grasping millet, empties a person’s field, yet only carries one or two in its armpit. The Dao learner’s lack of greed is just like this. How much wisdom and energy do people have now? How much do worldly affairs rush about? A hundred years pass in a blink, old age follows wisdom, and senility follows. One formula, one method, all can bring truth. The urgent task is to attend to what must be done, choose one good and keep to it, simplify and refine it for contemplation; then the fire begins to burn, the spring begins to flow, and expanding it is limitless. Do not imitate the chicken and monkey in taking much but without measure. This is my subtle intention in introducing this book to readers. Thus this preface.

Respectfully composed in the fourth month of summer, year of the Water Rooster, by the lay practitioner Guoyuan of Xichang.

### Preface Two

I have always loved printing good books. Within my capacity, sometimes alone, sometimes assisting, I must complete the task before feeling content. For ten years, wandering among the Buddhist gates, with much disorder in the times, I have always felt ashamed of my mediocrity and lack of achievement. Moreover, with my Master’s vast grace and constant support, my heart to repay it cannot be restrained. Seeing my comrades’ efforts over many years with little result, and the difficulty of finding true and good teachers; when questions and doubts arise, I often fail to respond properly and provide remedies, leaving hearts unsatisfied. Because of this, I sigh at the vastness and see many falter halfway. It is like those who care for farming, knowing only how to sow seeds but not how to hoe weeds—how can they expect shoots to grow, to flourish, and bear fruit? In the year of the Water Monkey, by chance I obtained the book *Records of the Hall of Joyous Nurturing*, glimpsing its talk of the Dao, unable to discern pure from flawed. I questioned lay practitioner Guoyuan, who approved it as orthodox. Thus I entrusted it to friends of the same path. As for the book’s content, readers will know for themselves; and since lay practitioner Guoyuan’s preface has already touched on it, I add mine here.

### Postscript to the Reprint of *Records of the Hall of Joyous Nurturing*

The *Records of the Hall of Joyous Nurturing* in four volumes were recorded by disciples of Master Huang Yuanji. The Master was born in the Yuan dynasty; the *Collected Works of Zhang Sanfeng* narrate his lineage, and his name is included therein. This book was completed during the Daoxian era, spanning nearly a thousand years, yet still gathering disciples to teach—perhaps what is called those who leave form and dwell in the world? The world declines, the Dao grows faint, and human hearts sink into mire; without elucidating the study of nature and life, there is no way to awaken the masses lost in confusion. Ancient books on the Dao, such as *Cantong* and *Wuzhen*, have arcane language, difficult for people to grasp. Other books often borrow names like lead and mercury, kan and li, water and fire, weaving metaphors that leave readers lost in a five-li fog, utterly unsure of their meaning. Seeking clarity, simplicity, depth, and a clear order of practice, one finds little. This book speaks plainly and reasoningly, freely expressing the mysterious breath; it is truly a ladder to nature’s study and a ferry to the life school. Teng Jian once obtained an old copy, incomplete and damaged. In the year of the Wood Horse, I came to the province and borrowed it to view at Kang Qianli’s place, fearing this rare treasure would scatter and be lost with time. Therefore, I consulted fellow students and carefully proofread and separately published it, widely printing it to present to the world. Later readers who delve deeply will surely find no superfluous words.
