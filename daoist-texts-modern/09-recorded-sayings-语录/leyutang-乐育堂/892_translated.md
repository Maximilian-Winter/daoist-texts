## Records of the Hall of Joyous Nurturing, Volume One (Section Twenty-Nine)

### One  
When ordinary people desire to learn any matter, they must first clearly perceive the dao’s principle, firmly plant their feet, fix their gaze in a single glance, grasp with one hand, and not cease until reaching the utmost limit. Only with such strength can one truly master a single thing. Even if one cannot reach its summit, one will not abandon it halfway, thus not becoming a person of trivial worth. This is true for all matters—how much more so for the study of nature and life! Speaking of immortals and transcendent beings, everyone in the world loves them, yet among those who teach and learn this dao, only one or two in a hundred succeed. Alas! The red dust churns endlessly, the sea of karmic retribution stretches boundlessly—what joy is there? What beauty is there? Yet people fail to perceive this and instead lose their conscience because of it. Not only do they fail to transcend the mundane and enter the sacred, but they wander through birth and death, sinking ever lower, suffering untold agonies beyond words. My master therefore mourns on their behalf. Now, for your sake, I rejoice in your birth and fortune. Through years of hardship and lifelong sincerity, you have met this day. If your spirit is listless, indifferent, and you remain as before today and tomorrow, I fear that once the dao withdraws, when fate is fulfilled, regret will come too late.  

Since ancient times, which immortal was born perfect? All have come not by sudden grace but by constant effort, from little to much, from subtle to manifest, accumulating until their presence fills the heavens and earth, spanning from antiquity to now. Hence the saying: “Shakyamuni did not spring from the earth; the Most High was not born from Heaven.” Even the True Sovereigns of the Void have endured countless torments and humiliations before cultivating the perfect enlightenment and golden body of the Tathāgata. How much more so for those of middling roots among you! Do not say your years have passed, your time is short, fearing that though you wish to learn the dao, you have no time to complete it. Better to let nature take its course, surrender to fate’s shifting, follow your whims, and neglect to gather your spirit and organize your heart’s strength. Then you are like a horse without reins, a monkey without a tether, bound to run wild and reckless without end—thus wasting past blessings and bringing disaster upon the future. How can this be?  

I think: to lose the human body once is to lose it for ten thousand kalpas; moreover, you live in China, the land illuminated by rites, righteousness, and culture; you have encountered a dharma assembly and heard the true essence of dao, virtue, and life. Such conditions are rare even among immortal masters of past generations. Why? Because if you merely devote your sincerity, you will receive true transmission without stepping outside your door. Consider the ancient immortals: though today they have attained the dao and their spirits dwell in the Great Luo Heaven Palace, in their day they roamed the nine continents, enduring countless sufferings and hardships, countless storms and frosts, not to mention the waste of wealth and the deceit of false paths. Only when their sincerity was long accumulated and their resolve deep, their hearts bitter and the path difficult, did the true immortals deeply pity their plight and labor, compassionately descend, and step by step reveal the profound mysteries of the Great Dao. When their功 is complete and their行 full, they become a true immortal of a grotto.  

How does your encounter with masters and hearing the dao compare to those ancient sages? Many ancient immortal masters met their teachers late, under difficult conditions, with inauspicious stars, in hardship and helplessness, before seeing through the red dust and seeking the dao. Like Master Lü, who met Zhongli at forty and heard the supreme dao at fifty; Master Zhang, who abandoned his home at sixty to seek the dao and received the Fire Dragon’s secret at seventy. From this, it seems that if one is not wholeheartedly devoted to the dao, age is no barrier. My dao says: “Ordinary people do not fear not being young; they fear only not being sincere toward the dao.” Even at ninety or one hundred years old, if one cultivates according to the method, whether man or woman, one has the power to move stars and shift the dipper, to revive the dead and restore life.  

Since ancient times, the youngest to learn the dao, aside from the Bodhisattva Guanyin and the Buddha, are few. It is not difficult to enter the dao young, but young people often waver, have divided intentions and triple hearts, relying on time and neglecting effort, lacking urgency. Hence many learn but few succeed. Only among you middle-aged and elderly, who have already tasted the hardships of the mundane world, who have repeatedly suffered the bitterness of fame and profit, do you see the world’s glory as tasteless wax, without meaning, and know that all pleasures hide their own sufferings. Thus the human heart dies and the dao heart arises; the human heart hides and the dao heart reveals—only then can one fully understand the prior causes and deeply penetrate the treasure of life. Though it is said that after bitterness comes sweetness, when one is resolute and undistracted, one does not know the suffering of cultivation, so one kalpa suffices to complete it without needing to start anew.  

Have you tasted the bitterness of the world? Have you tasted the sweetness of the dao? If you weigh one side heavier here and the other lighter there, do not be like young people whose worldly ties are unresolved, whose mundane hearts are not empty, whose功 is not accumulated, whose karmic obstacles are hard to dispel, thus only dreaming of attaining the dao but unable to form the elixir. You possess lofty ambition and vast heavenly sincerity; naturally, the elixir will form, and with a glance, clouds will rise beneath your feet.  

### Two  
The sages speak of the dao of yang birth, which is never a single aspect but always comes from a state of no thought and no deliberation. Like the chaste maiden or the loyal widow, whose resolve is unshakable, who, if suddenly faced with misfortune, would rather die than forsake righteousness. Or like loyal ministers and martyrs, who follow only righteousness and, if disaster arises unexpectedly, are willing to sacrifice their lives. This is true yang birth. Otherwise, how could one endure a hundred setbacks without turning back?  

From this we infer that in daily conduct, whether fulfilling filial piety and friendship, or showing compassion to orphans, widows, and the poor, all good deeds and righteous acts done just right bring feelings of joy and encouragement—these are all signs of yang birth. The only fear is that one’s own self suddenly perceives it, then suddenly becomes blocked by qi. Or that one knows it and becomes arrogant, speaking boastfully and showing it in expression, proud and boastful, unaware of self-restraint, treating what is as nothing, thus scattering it under the sway of habitual qi.  

Or one reads books and recites poetry, suddenly letting go of all private desires, leaving only a single spirit—this is also a facet of yang birth. Or friends gather and talk freely, suddenly yang qi soars and true opportunity bursts forth—this too is a path of yang birth. Further, in qin, chess, calligraphy, painting, fishing, woodcutting, farming, and reading, if one can follow nature, act according to one’s innate nature, without seeking or desiring, one will always be at ease and content, carefree and forgetting cares—these are all signs of yang birth.  

The key is that at every movement one is aware, and at every awareness one withdraws; thus the spirit is never outwardly longing, the qi remains abundant and beautiful, and the elixir is not difficult to grow. How can the embryo not flourish? Even if one does not become an immortal, if one can hold fast and not lose this, the spirit will always return to the Qian cavity, the qi will often return to the furnace, and true yang will naturally arise over time.  

One must especially know: where there is yang, there is birth; where there is no yang, there is death. From this, even if one has little功 and virtue, cannot ascend to the Great Luo and enter the Vast Void, one can still extend one’s life beyond the mundane and become an earthly immortal or a celestial immortal in the world. When you understand this, you will know yang is dao, dao is emptiness and nature. Zisi said, “The dao cannot be separated even for a moment”—is this not the teaching to gather and restrain yang light, not allowing a single ray to leak? You have keen insight, so I show you the true primordial yang that fills the heavens and earth, spans antiquity and now, existing everywhere and always. If I taught this to beginners, it would block their entry, stifling the natural joy and encouragement of their original color and light.  

### Three  
Between Heaven and Earth, apart from the great golden elixir dao and the功 of return, all manner of honors and riches are but illusions and transformations. The ignorant mundane folk, not knowing this, take sound, color, wealth, and profit as their business, believing that having surplus in the family is due to good deeds accumulated in past lives and that they enjoy great benefits in this life. Who knows that excessive enjoyment dissipates the spirit, so that in the end one returns empty-handed, and even the true reality of Heaven and Earth and myself vanishes into nothingness? This is what the Most High meant when he said, “Heaven and Earth and all things steal my primordial qi.”  

Thus, the splendor and beauty of the world, even for emperors and generals, if one does not cultivate nature and establish life, is nothing but daily depletion of true primordial energy, with no benefit to the true body. Therefore, the toil of wealth and honor is less than the contentment of poverty and lowliness. The ancients said, “If one does not cultivate dao and virtue in the world, it is like entering a treasure mountain and returning empty-handed.” This is no falsehood.  

My master traveled to Shu Commandery and saw that people either enslave their will to wealth and fame or indulge in wine, lust, wealth, and anger. My heart was deeply moved with pity. Alas! Though they have the will to be saved, they do not know to return. Not only do they refuse salvation, they even slander, calling my dao strange and weird. Alas! Such people, though I have ten parts pity, I can do nothing about them!  

Think, in today’s world, are not most people’s hearts like this? Yet they do not consider how rare a human body is in a kalpa, how swiftly time passes toward dusk. How do they know that today’s wealth and honor will not become poverty and lowliness in the next life? How do they know that being human today will not become a beast in the next? The ancients said, “Human body is hard to obtain, China is hard to be born in, the Great Dao is hard to encounter.” Having obtained a human body, born in China, and hearing the true dharma, this is the supreme cause and condition. Compared to emperors and generals who enjoy fleeting glory and vanish, reborn in miserable decline, is this not a condition a million times higher?  

If one can secretly cultivate from this, even if not becoming immortal or sage, one will be reborn with roots intact, which is fortunate. Moreover, joining this dharma assembly, Heaven bestows special grace, allowing one to complete功 in one kalpa. You, each and every one, seize this good opportunity, strive forward, fear no difficulty, endure no hardship, only resolutely dedicate yourselves to the field of dao and virtue, quietly focus on功 and practice. Are the heavenly immortals deaf and blind? The only fear is that people do not apply their hearts; do not blame the gods for not silently protecting and assisting.  

In these troubled times, when people think it difficult to live as mortals, those with dao see it as great fortune. Why? If conditions were ordinary, without trials and tribulations, who would turn their hearts to the dao and seek the mysterious? Only through a thousand hardships and myriad difficulties, with things not going as desired and people not favoring me, does one realize that worldly conditions are all toil and trouble, with no good at all. Then one becomes indifferent to fame and profit, secretly cultivates for oneself, grows weary of the world, and resolves to pure cultivation. Even if one does not become an immortal today, one has already climbed the steps of the immortal path. If reborn human, would the gods abandon you for another?  

Hence the ancients said, “Immortals are still of immortal stock; how can ordinary people become immortals?” This is it. I speak again of today’s encounter. Today, there are no fewer than ten million dao learners, yet who can explain the true constant wonderful dao’s entire use without omission? Only you, who hear my teaching, have no slightest omission or one-sided learning—what a fortunate encounter this is! It shows the gods’ love for the dao, sparing no effort for your lives. Since entering the dao, you have endured many hardships and storms. From the outside, it seems dao learners are not favored by Heaven but suffer many shocks. Yet you do not know that each slander brings one step forward in dao and virtue; each trial lengthens your spirit; old habits and roots are dispelled; past grievances and karmic debts are removed.  

It is like a person stained with mud, washed clean, becoming refreshed; like gold and jade hidden in stone, refined and glowing. This path of blessing and wisdom is not in comfort and ease but in hardship and danger. Do not let others’ words cause you to waver. I see you are true immortal stock, not muddled souls who think of immortals and wealth together, with mixed thoughts in one heart.  

### Four  
I instruct again: the path of cultivation must not be careless with water and fire; water must be clear and fire white to be the primordial water and fire. Where is the fire? In the heart’s nature; nature itself is fire. But nature has two aspects: qi nature and true nature. If qi nature is not removed, true nature cannot be seen, and one remains entangled in worldly affairs. When a moment’s vexation arises, it becomes mundane fire, scorching the whole body, and true nature is destroyed. Therefore, the first task of the alchemist is to concentrate the spirit. Concentrating the spirit means nothing else but removing mundane fire, becoming a pure flame of no thought and no deliberation, calm and free, able to transform mundane qi into true qi.  

When you sit in meditation, strive to extinguish each mundane fire, then slowly concentrate the spirit. Then the spirit becomes true spirit, fire becomes true fire, and the spirit has a proper place. If you do not know its place, wandering aimlessly, not knowing the method, how can you begin? This qi cavity is the one place, the gateway for returning to root and life. It opens and closes naturally; my spirit only governs it, never following its length or shortness, its rise or fall—this is the method of concentrating the spirit.  

Concentrate the spirit here, regulate the breath naturally, day by day and month by month, the immortal embryo is formed, like a newborn infant receiving father’s essence and mother’s blood. This embryo breath is neither fast nor slow, neither cold nor hot, and after ten months the infant is born. Where is the water? In the kidney’s essence; essence is water. But there is false essence and true essence; if these two are not clear, the elixir will not succeed. If false essence is not removed, water runs wild, inevitably flowing and becoming lust. To control false essence, one must rely on the primordial spirit to return and observe within, constantly checking. Naturally, lustful and evil thoughts will not arise; this is true essence.  

If movement arises, it burdens true qi. I gather my thoughts to return to truth, drawing it upward and downward, collecting it back to the central earth cauldron, refining it once more. Then the great medicine is easy to obtain, and the great elixir must be formed. These two, water and fire, are the foundation of the human body, the root of becoming immortal and sage. Do not confuse or mix them, or fail to distinguish purity from impurity. Strive for this—it is an urgent matter in these times.  

### Five  
I reveal the true essence of seeing the mind and perceiving nature. The primordial heart is nature, the primordial nature is the void and primordial qi—essentially, a single void. After birth, the binding of qi and temperament, the veil of emotions and desires, the entanglement of affection, make the heart no longer void. Qi is the heart’s servant, essence is the spirit’s servant, chasing illusions and wandering, consumed and exhausted. This is why learners begin by concentrating the spirit and regulating the breath. If the spirit does not concentrate, it scatters; scattered, wandering thoughts and illusions arise; how can it gather into one region as the commander of elixir refinement? Only by concentration can it become one; one is void.  

My heart’s void is the innate nature given by Heaven; the external void of the Vast Void is the unborn void nature. If breath is not regulated, it is loose; loose, the internal organs and external skin are nothing but a mass of restless qi moving about. To gather this into one mass as the foundation of life is difficult indeed. Only by regulation can it be balanced; balanced, it is harmonious. My body’s harmony is the life received from Heaven and Earth after birth; the Great Harmony qi is the life before birth, suspended between Heaven and Earth. This is true nature and true life, inseparable from Heaven, Earth, and beings, the nature and life of immortals who create themselves.  

If you wish to return life to the root and reach the realm of divine transformation, there is no other cultivation but to concentrate the spirit to stillness, regulate breath to evenness, neither forgetting nor assisting, neither hastening nor delaying, so that heart, spirit, and breath all enter the utmost void, still and profound. But this is not fabricated void, but natural void. Thus Heaven, Earth, ghosts, gods, and beings share one source. Yet it is not void without reality. When my spirit is void, the clear and harmonious qi of Heaven and Earth naturally responds. The reason humans can participate in Heaven and Earth, assist transformation and nurturing, undergo infinite changes, and manifest wondrous mysteries is that the spirit breath’s void resonates with the clear void qi. This void contains reality.  

Long gathering naturally brings strength and uprightness inside and out, pure and refined essence. Such seeing of nature is true nature manifesting. How is the heart bright? Only when void is spirit, spirit is bright, bright contains all principles, all matters included. When unmoved, it is vast and boundless, without recognition or knowledge—no internal thought arises, no external thought enters, only feeling brightness and clarity, containing one principle, embracing all phenomena. This is attainment. When touched by things and moved, it responds accordingly, meeting roundness with roundness, following square with square, lively and unrestrained like a dragon’s mysterious dance.  

It is said: “Stillness is primordial spirit; movement is true intention.” Spirit and intention are one, differing only in movement and stillness. The ancients also said: “The heart has no nature and no master; nature has no heart and no reliance.” The heart carries nature; nature governs the heart. Thus the heart’s brightness, vastness, and wonder are the measure of nature. To know this true heart is to know nature. But this nature is not yet in the human body; it circles in clear void as primordial qi. Once it enters the body, it becomes primordial spirit, all void yet existent. Beginners must first let this heart be lively and free, entrust it to the vast Heaven, roam the Vast Void’s surface, then inwardly subdue the body’s lead and mercury, outwardly steal the primordial yang of Heaven and Earth. Over time, spirit concentrates and breath regulates, feeling a point of spirit breath in the elixir field, vast and flowing, seeming to be and not to be. I guard and observe it like a cat hunting a mouse or a rabbit encountering a hawk, one heart focused, not allowing wandering. Naturally, internal response and external resonance arise, sensing the primordial qi flowing within and without without rest.  

When nature功 reaches this, life功 becomes easy. The mountain spirits and water monsters of the world can transform into human form and功 is said to be complete, but when they go out to see and play, if they see desire they covet, if they see fear they flee, even committing unkind, unrighteous, shameless deeds, they ultimately face extermination without escape—all because their cultivation of nature功 is insufficient. My master teaches that the foremost task is to see the mind and perceive nature—this is the meaning. Do you understand?  

### Six  
The two characters “refine the heart” encompass all methods of myriad saints and sages. Outside this, there is no Great Dao. Know that the seeds of birth and death, the wheel of reincarnation, all arise from a single thought unrestrained, from false emotions and illusions producing all manner of strange phenomena. Hence the ancients first tightly restrain the wild horse of thought and firmly lock the monkey of the heart. Why? Because every movement of a thought concerns birth and death; every cessation of thought is nirvana. The accomplishment of the dao is not in quantity but in holding one thought firmly, thereby creating amidst the muddle and confusion, no thought and no deliberation Heaven.  

Even if thoughts arise, they are caused by external stimuli, not spontaneous. Such moving heart, heart without heart, though responding to myriad matters, is true heart. Otherwise, heart with heart, even sitting quietly in meditation, is false heart. To reach this state is not easy. The key is to hold and preserve one thought, until it is as it is, free and clear, with divine power and creation, virtue matching Heaven and Earth. Only fear that the mysterious gateway moves and one becomes careless. If one can always hold and preserve, never slacken, face demons without retreat, endure slander without complaint, with one heart and one virtue, nurturing this subtle and wondrous body long, naturally day by day growing, the mysterious gateway will appear.  

The mysterious gateway is our alchemical elixir’s head, not to be sought only in great stillness or great calm. Confucius said, “If I desire benevolence, benevolence arrives.” If one must wait for great stillness and calm to have it, Confucius would not have so easily pointed it out. Thus, when cultivating, suddenly still and calm, with no knowledge or awareness, suddenly a knowing heart arises, no prior thought, no later memory, clean and pure, this is the original face of the Qian Yuan One Qi. From this one thought, cultivate, gather, seal, and nurture, and after long time, the immortal will form. Small stillness and small calm also reveal the return of Heaven’s heart.  

If one’s affairs are hurried, thoughts myriad, matters vexing, like vines entwining, like trees drawing creepers, ever growing more tangled and confused with no rest, what to do? Only by one thought turning light, one heart illuminating clearly, like a drunken man lost asleep by the roadside suddenly sprayed with a bowl of cold water, waking with a start, realizing the haze and confusion were but an empty dream—this is the mysterious gateway.  

Long ago the Immortal Elder of the Southern Pole showed Crane Thin to the young disciple: the true primordial heart essence indeed comes from the mysterious gateway, moving with stillness and motion, always present but not felt unless stirred. If someone calls your name, you must respond “Here.” Who is this response? Though it is the mouth, the true master of the response is the true primordial heart essence. In that response, the true primordial heart essence is brought forth from emptiness for others to see, truly good at pointing out.  

When awareness does not arise, all phenomena vanish; when called, the true primordial manifests, showing that this heart neither perishes with phenomena nor arises with them. Therefore, when awareness does not arise, the heart is at ease; when awareness arises, the heart is also at ease, because it is void and numinous. If void, what birth or death is there? Only fear that tangled false thoughts and affections cannot be cut, thus not void, and not the foundation of dao cultivation.  

In short, this gateway is but a moment’s breath; before it is not, after it is not. Like a person in deep stillness suddenly called by name and responding instantly, that is the mysterious gateway. After response, yin and yang divide into two forms, but this is no longer the mysterious gateway. The gateway is the moment when the Great Ultimate is about to divide and the two forms about to separate. It is neither movement nor stillness, but between stillness at its extreme and movement at its extreme. The so-called movement and stillness have no beginning or end, and the mysterious gateway has no beginning or end. The learner must understand this well.  

### Seven  
Recently transmitted are all supreme methods. One must carefully attend from stillness and calm to have realization. Otherwise, one will merely flip through pages without great taste. Know that every word I utter comes from the heart, with no deception. At the start of功, the spirit roams the Vast Void, observing the original cavity, uniting void with void, and the heart brightens and nature is seen, always present without waiting for true yang to arise. Alas, people only know to nourish void, not to remove the void of distractions.  

Also, know that the heart wandering in desires is not void; not knowing to stop desire is also not void. Too many desires injure the spirit; cutting off desire also burdens the heart. Though different, both are obstacles to the heart. Yet we say void and yang birth, because to say void might cause people to fall into one-sided emptiness; to say yang shows that within void is reality, containing perfect clarity, illumination, and infinite divine power. Only when void is extreme does yang arise from it. I use true intention to gather, refine, bathe, and nurture it, like Heaven and Earth at the dawn of creation, when smoke and clouds obscure, but true yang arrives, and the warm spring light merges as one Great Harmony, brewing and fermenting, transforming all else into nothingness. Some things having transformed, nothingness again arises from this. Reality is void, void is reality; all is naturally created by one yang qi, with no room for the mind.  

The *Dingguang Jing* says: “The sign of attaining the dao is first that old ailments vanish, the body and mind are refreshed, steps like flying, color radiant”—all transformations born of one yang qi. I hope you have a firm and enduring heart, not ceasing until the utmost. In daily功, you must understand the subtlety of the character ‘void’ to progress. Only when you gain strength here can you truly gain strength and benefit. All other honors and displays are like spring flowers before the eyes, floating clouds blocking the sky, utterly without interest. Without this supreme joy, none but the worldly will be drawn to power and profit.  

When the learner reaches this state, their effort is not in vain. I again reveal the way of refining the heart. The human heart is originally void, numinous, and clear, but because of the words “heart” and “no heart,” it becomes unclear and confused, not void and blocked. If one can hold sincerity to establish its essence, respond to conditions to meet its mechanism, this is what Chengzi called: “The heart embraces all things without heart; feelings follow all things without feelings.” If you can do this, then in every moment all affairs respond as if in mountain stillness. If not, even closing the door and sitting quietly is like a thousand horses galloping in a camp.  

Therefore, Zhuangzi said: “If you do not control your heart, the heart cannot be correct; if you force the heart, the heart also cannot be correct.” Only by holding the heart without letting it run wild, broadening the heart without letting it forget, can movement and stillness be one, hidden and manifest without distinction. Is this easy to obtain? You must carefully examine the mysterious gateway, constantly gather it, never lose the moment, advance and retreat the fire talisman without violating its rules, bathe and seal without error, so spirit and qi become one, the true mechanism always before you, naturally spontaneous, letting external conditions gather, this heart is identical with the Vast Void, unmoved by anything.  

### Eight  
I say the mysterious gateway is one of the void and numinous, able to understand birth and death, escape the wheel of reincarnation, becoming the immortal dharma body lasting for billions of years. From this understanding, keep it pure and clean, bright as jade, not allowing a speck of dust to stain and spoil it—this is the immortal way. If even a hair’s breadth of impurity clings, it cannot be a free, effortless, carefree immortal. From this thought, not only must wine, lust, wealth, and pride be utterly free of the slightest stain, but even when功 is complete and virtue pervades the sand world, one must empty all possessions, establish a name and then retire,功 complete without attachment, only then can one “shine with numinous light, far removed from root and dust.”  

Because originally all things are formless and shadowless, intangible, neither form nor emptiness, hard to describe, only nourished by void qi and governed by void spirit, when void meets void, the great elixir can be formed. Other talents and cleverness, all writings and arts, however wondrous and varied, are external to the body and cannot resist birth and death or overturn the wheel of reincarnation. Not only are they irrelevant to me, but the heart clinging to these things becomes the seed of harm to the dao. Even establishing功, virtue, and reputation,功 matching creation, virtue paralleling Heaven and Earth, counts only as a bit of benevolence and compassion to save the world, to be a father and mother to the people. If one wishes to excel and become immortal, this is still not enough. Because virtue and deeds are external, not related to one’s own cultivation, perfecting nature and establishing life, to set the pattern for future generations.  

You have heard this secret, which is the rarest condition in the human world. Confucius said, “If one hears the dao in the morning, one may die in the evening.” To hear the true dao is a great blessing, a great joy. Moreover, after hearing the secret, my master has given tenfold encouragement and correction, making success in true and sagehood certain. In short, this secret is Heaven-given; only those whose功 and virtue increase, whose heart and nature do not change, who face demons without retreat, endure slander without complaint, and persist through hardship, with heart always on the dao, are permitted to receive the secret and hear the true dharma eye treasury. Otherwise, hold back and advance, selfishly use it, not only will gods and immortals not allow it, even if taught intimately, demons and ghosts will block the mind.  

Therefore, the ancient immortals said, “This dao is most divine and wondrous; I worry your portion is too small to bear.” It shows that those who can bear this secret are those with dao and virtue, the roots of immortals. You have heard this secret; do not think it easy. It comes from more than ten years of hardship, trials without complaint, only then to hear it and use it as the vessel of the dao, to become immortal in the future. You must think of these ten-plus years of day and night devoted to this dao. If today you hear the true dharma but do not work and do not advance, not only can you not repay me, but ask your heart: what is your intent? To build a nine-zhang mountain but fail for one basketful of earth—would that not be a pity? From now on, cultivate, and within a hundred days you can lay the foundation, and your life is yours, not the gods’ or Heaven’s. Otherwise, it is difficult.  

Even the prolonging of life by Yin Zhi depends on Heaven, not on me. Moreover, since ancient times, no saint has escaped death; even fate and destiny are hard to defy, much less ordinary people! You have heard this secret, a great and vast blessing; hurry to build your foundation, and longevity is certain.  

### Nine  
The reason the Vast Void gives birth ceaselessly, for billions of years without extinction, is not because it is empty without reality, but because within it is a most sincere spirit governing it, and there is circulating qi operating outside. The Vast Void is muddled and confused, initially unaware of spirit or qi, not knowing it is void, only following its qi’s transformation, flow, fullness and emptiness, waxing and waning, moving with time. Hence it is said, “If it is not dual, its produced things are unpredictable.” What is this thing? The boundless giving rise to the Great Ultimate, which itself is boundless. Because of this, birth and transformation are unpredictable, changes infinite, vast and endless.  

Also it is said: one Vast Void, vast and sweeping, round and swirling, indivisible in division, inseparable in union; the still and unmoving spirit, capable of sensing and thus communicating the wondrous; at the moment of sensing and communicating, the still and unmoving spirit is present. Therefore, no thing and no sensing, the awareness does not perish; with things and sensing, awareness does not arise. Because birth and death depend on things, the Vast Void has no birth or death. If the Vast Void had birth and death, it would have interruption and continuity. The Vast Void is void, soundless and odorless—how could it have birth and death? Humans are also born from the Vast Void; why alone have birth and death, unable to ascend to the Vast Void?  

Because at birth, the governing spirit and circulating qi are originally vast and indistinct, unaware and unknown, like a baby growing day by day. When grown, knowledge opens, private desires arise, riding on material desires and false feelings, wandering back and forth, friends following thoughts, so the human heart’s void is filled with desires and does not resemble the Vast Void’s void. If one wishes to become the immortal spirit that is birthless and deathless, like the Vast Void, can one not empty the heart and calm the spirit, yet still rely on blood and qi’s circulating breath?  

I said earlier the mysterious gateway is truly the union of spirit and qi, faintly entering the land of no-thing, the realm of clear void and profound brightness. At this time, the heart is as empty as water, the intention as cold as ice, the spirit as still as a mountain, the qi flowing like a spring, yet one does not know it. Because one does not know spirit or qi, does not know void, it is the same void as the Vast Void. When功 reaches this, movement and stillness are like creation and transformation, breathing is the qi mechanism, all formed by the union of my true yin and true yang into one qi, so that with Heaven and Earth’s spirit and yang qi, one breathes in and out continuously, mixing and gathering into one region, void yet not existent, real yet not attached. If one is dull and confused, how can one sense and communicate? Such subtle wonder must be.  

You must concentrate spirit within qi, qi envelop spirit outside, both mixed without separation, suddenly muddled and chaotic, entering the dark and mysterious place. This is true void and true spirit harmoniously united, like a person calling and the valley echoing, wind blowing and the cave resonating—nature’s principle. This is the stillness harmonizing with the earth’s body, movement harmonizing with Heaven’s motion. When I exhale, my qi connects with Heaven’s qi; when I inhale, Heaven’s qi enters my qi. Achieving central harmony, Heaven and Earth are in place, all things nurtured—what other wonder is there? It is all sought within oneself.

You ask about advancing fire and gathering medicine; in the postnatal realm they are two matters, not one. Now I explain carefully. Advancing fire is concentrating spirit with one intention, undivided. Gathering medicine uses the external breath’s qi, rising and falling, exhaling and inhaling, following nature. When yang moves and medicine is born, concentrating the internal spirit with one mind on the elixir cauldron is advancing fire; wrapping it with external breath’s rising and falling is gathering medicine. Advancing fire is advancing fire; gathering medicine is gathering medicine—do not mix them as one.  

If only external breath’s rising and falling is used, but spirit is not concentrated on the cauldron, then though true mechanism bursts forth, it will scatter through the body with no place to rest. If only yang qi bursts forth, with spirit concentrated, but without using postnatal breath to wrap it, then the medicine qi stops there, only strengthening the lower source and boosting kidney qi. If you do not understand, I explain again: advancing fire is like a blacksmith’s furnace with added wood and charcoal; gathering medicine is like the bellows blowing air. If you only blow the bellows but do not add fuel, the fire is weak and the metal will not melt. If you only add fuel but do not blow the bellows, though there is wood and charcoal, the furnace is only warm inside, how can you hope to refine something useful?  

Think: fire is fire, medicine is medicine, advancing is advancing, gathering is gathering. Postnatal功 is originally like this. If gathering great medicine within non-action, advancing fire within stillness, this is fire and medicine united, advancing and gathering undivided. Your功 is not yet at this stage. When yang is born, you must judge your true return to truth, then you have the reality of action and non-action, doing and non-doing. I teach you to use the method of counting breaths to gather and restrain your mind. When there is no yang, this method holds your heart from wandering. When yang arises and medicine is born, you must gather it to the furnace, nurture it with spirit fire, especially using fire without fire and medicine without medicine, so that the primordial qi of Heaven and Earth can endlessly generate and transform.
