## Records of the Hall of Joyful Nurturance, Volume Two (Thirty Sections)

### One  
The beginning of human learning always requires first to clarify each person’s allotted boundary. For instance, misfortune and blessing, life and death, honor and disgrace, joy and sorrow, right and wrong, success and failure, beauty and ugliness, good and bad—all these are decreed by Heaven, and none of these can be grasped by oneself. Only the advancement of virtue and cultivation of merit are our own affairs and achievements; the cultivation of nature and refining of life are our learning. These I may claim and assert. Moreover, virtue and merit are the foundation of myself; nature and life are my root. They can follow me through life and death, coming and going freely, enduring countless eons without change. If one does not exhaust oneself but merely seeks from Heaven, not only does one overstep the proper role and gain no benefit, but one also imprisons one’s entire spirit within, causing the true color and form of my being—deep, clear, and ever serene—to be engulfed and lost.  

To perceive this is to realize that all external disturbances and baseless troubles depend entirely on the eye’s wisdom pearl and the chest’s hidden sword of insight. It is not difficult to shine through demons and monsters, to sever all entanglements. Alas, people cannot hold a single thought steadfastly for long. Thus Confucius said: “When knowledge reaches it, benevolence cannot guard it. Even if obtained, it will surely be lost.” From this we see the utmost value lies in enduring long upon the Way, not letting the tangible burden the intangible, so that the intangible may illuminate the tangible, continuous and dense, without division or cessation, aligning above and below with Heaven and Earth’s virtue—this is the merit of benevolent guarding.  

Though the principle is so, the practice is not easy. At the very start of practice, one may not understand; even if one understands, one may not guard it. It is no harm to concentrate the spirit on emptiness, regulate the breath in stillness, so that qi has a place to return, the spirit a master to hold. Qi does not move recklessly, spirit does not wander outside. Over long time, spirit enters qi without knowing, qi envelops spirit without feeling. Thus, nurturing over days and accumulating deep merit, one harmonizes with Heaven, carried silently and scentlessly—this is my teaching of true chaos, not falling into the silence of false paths.  

I am greatly astonished at today’s Confucians, who desire to purify principle and return to it as the ultimate of the Great Way, yet refuse to seek further at the hundred-foot pole the true realm of emptiness made real. They inevitably see principle and desire overlapping, never attaining great awakening like the Tathāgata. Moreover, clutching the view of a well frog, they heap slander and abuse, intending to overturn my Way and then cease. Among them are wise scholars who argue fiercely against their slanders, but alas, the cacophony of many voices overwhelms the few clear ones. All that remains is to scratch one’s head and ask Heaven, helplessly. This is why the Great Way is not transmitted, and why the world’s state grows ever worse.  

Those who stand firm and unmoved, who do not retreat when facing demons, who do not refuse hardship and shoulder this Way alone—how great are their achievements! I rejoice for you all, and further encourage you.  

The one aperture of the mysterious gate is the foremost task of the cultivator. Yet without the true Supreme Ultimate and the Infinite, how can the mysterious female gate manifest? If one says it exists, it is but illusion, not reality. The essence of alchemical refinement lies in the mysterious female gate, which is the true yin and true yang mingled into the Supreme Ultimate. But when unmoved, it is a turbid, formless void—thus called the Infinite. From the Infinite, when suddenly and coincidentally stirred, the Supreme Ultimate moves and gives birth to yang; when still, it gives birth to yin. Movement and stillness are each the root of the other. This movement and stillness of yin-yang qi mechanism is where all things begin to generate.  

The great practitioner melds spirit and qi into one. When moving here, this is the movement of the Supreme Ultimate, spirit and qi inseparable; when still here, this is the stillness of the Supreme Ultimate, spirit and qi naturally unified. The saying “Kan and Li intercross to produce the medicine; Qian and Kun intercross to form the elixir” is none other than this movement and stillness of true yin and true yang, none other than the perfect roundness of the Supreme Ultimate bringing forth substance. Though called medicine and elixir, they are not two; rather, yin and yang first mingle, and the numinous qi begins to manifest. When the elixir is formed with form, it is the gathering of external numinous yang to augment our innate primordial qi, hence “external medicine matched with internal medicine.” When gathered into the cauldron, sealed and warmed, how can it fail to transcend the Infinite?  

But beware: if one strives to be sage and forgets to be mad, a single breath out of control, or responding to others and being led by them, responding to things and being entangled by them, then spirit moves qi, qi follows spirit, and the unity of spirit and qi divides again. Once spirit and qi separate, the mind and will slacken, and the spirit given by Heaven and the virtue granted by parents almost vanish. The ancients said, “Breath is faint, morning does not reach evening,” never failing to arise from spirit and qi divided into two.  

Now I solemnly warn: when human spirit and qi have not united, one must seek their union. Be careful not to let a single thought slip, lest you fall into danger; not to let a single matter be careless, lest you sink and drown. Desire is the root of illusion; nature and life are the innate virtue. Rather than greed for the fleeting pleasures of desire, why not seek the true nature and life that endure for millions of years? Moreover, whether obtained or not, fate remains—this is no trivial matter, for it can be governed by me. Once obtained, it is forever obtained, which is better.  

I call out again: seek nothing else but to hang a bright mirror in your chest, grasp a treasured sword in your hand, to shine through the courage of demons and monsters, to uproot the root of desire, so that nothing may entangle you. This is what the ancients said: “When responding to matters and meeting things, always savor the light and scene cultivated in stillness.” All depends on the learner rousing the spirit, always settling the true self in the void aperture, forbidding spirit and qi to wander. Thus, as Mencius said, the morning breath is always held and preserved, nourishing straightness without harm, filling the space between Heaven and Earth. But beware, the world is full of distractions, requiring effort and strength. Yet one must finish matters as matters, and the mind as mind, never letting external affairs drag the heart, nor guest qi stir the master. Thus, use without being used, things without being attached, the four great elements empty, all conditions extinguished. Yet this state is not easy to reach. At first, it is no harm to shine the mind’s light and the eye’s light directly on the elixir field; over time, spirit returns and qi submits, returning to the Supreme Ultimate Heaven. The ancients said: “The work of entering meditation lies in stopping thought; if thoughts do not cease, it is all in vain.” One must overcome delusive thoughts before true breath arises. Once true breath arises, the primordial spirit naturally lives. The essence of qi is clarity for the heart; the fullness of the heart is qi; qi and heart are two but one. What I now show is truly urgent. The medicine is here, the elixir is here, the completion of immortality is none other than here. Is the Way many indeed?

### Two  
When beginning to take essence and qi, heart and breath must depend on each other, spirit and qi not contradict. True yang and true medicine arise from this. Upon reaching this stage in practice, one must also know to use stillness as water, wisdom as fire, practicing day and night, moving and resting accordingly, always keeping heart and nature empty and bright, still but not confused. Only then can this primordial qi and true yang freely emerge. If wisdom flowers open, this is true wisdom, indispensable.  

Today’s unceasing thoughts and increasing schemes are the heart of knowing and perceiving, called wisdom by people, but our Daoist school views it as evil fire. Why? Because clever thoughts mean busy private hearts chasing and pursuing. With such private hearts, gain brings joy, loss brings anger. Anger is evil fire, a great harm to body and mind. Hence it is said: “When the fire of anger flares, the fetal breath flees like a galloping horse; only when the fire is extinguished and smoke dissipated does it return to the dwelling.” Therefore, the greatest taboo for practitioners is none other than the fire of anger. To remove this fire, nothing surpasses guarding simplicity and foolishness, using no cleverness or wisdom at all; not only unused, but forgotten. Only then does true qi begin to grow. The ancient lands where the Way was attained were mostly simple and unadorned.  

Once Zilu saw an old man carrying a water jar to irrigate a garden and asked, “Why not use a water wheel for convenience?” The man replied, “That is machinery. Wherever there is machinery, there is a mechanical heart. I do not do it.” Only an immortal could see this. Today I do not wish for more wisdom, but only for the equal dullness of Yan Hui, who lost cleverness and dismissed intelligence, using ear and eye without concern—thus one attains a single heart undivided, and the Way is nearly reached.  

Moreover, the arising of anger burdens true qi most heavily; how can it be absent? The key is awareness. Before anger arises, I hold stillness as the master; once anger moves, I illuminate it with awareness, striving to let it arise and vanish accordingly, so as not to harm the elixir. From this we see movement is yang, fire; stillness is yin, water. Whenever body and mind move, one must carefully observe. The ancients’ care in solitude was for this reason. In sum, at all times and places, whether moving or still, there must be no troublesome thoughts. To have no troubles in desire, one must first remove thought. Close the curtain and seal the veil; movement is stillness, stillness is stillness. Thus, when moving, spirit and qi are one; when still, spirit and qi are one; naturally daily growing full and monthly flourishing, the golden immortal is attained.  

I see that many have family duties, wives and children, unable to roam freely like wandering alchemists with no affairs. They must respond to human relations and repay all things. Slight negligence and thoughts entangle, which is ordinary fire harming the elixir. I now specially show the supreme refinement method. In daily affairs, one must respond accordingly, not wholly inattentive, nor overly calculating. Only calmly and steadily, one thought passes and is set aside, one thought acts and is forgotten. Thus, even with thousands of threads day and night, no harm comes. Such use of mind is to use without using, not using but using, increasing cleverness and wisdom, increasing peace and tranquility. This is the eternal Great Way, and true qi daily grows.  

I see many years of practice but diseases hard to dispel, only because moving thoughts ignite fire and harm primordial qi. If one follows the method, primordial qi grows strong, a hundred diseases quietly vanish, and long life can be attained.

### Three  
Though people say they cultivate both nature and life, in truth refining the heart is the key. When the heart’s ground is pure and clear, the great harmonious qi freely dwells therein. Recognizing this qi as true, gathering it as real, only a hundred days are needed to lay the foundation, ten months to form the embryo, three years to transcend. Hence the ancient saying: “Endure hardship for two or three years, enjoy happiness for thousands of years.” Otherwise, merely refining elixirs without first refining the heart, I have yet to see success. Therefore, the first difficulty is refining the heart.  

Observe the ancient sages and immortals who spent twenty or thirty years without entering the gate—this is because their hearts were not yet purified. Even with secret methods of the mysterious gate, how could they proceed? Refining the heart is the first step of work. Yet refining the heart is not merely sitting quietly in meditation. Once Qiu said, “I learn the Way in the noisy marketplace, a hundred times better than in quiet places.” Once Lü saw the monk Fazhen at Kaiyuan Temple who sat in meditation for over twenty years, with good precepts but unknown true Way. A Daoist came and asked Fazhen, “What do you study?” He said, “Sitting quietly and nurturing.” Lü said, “Can sitting alone complete the Way?” Fazhen said, “Yes.” Lü said, “To learn the Way, one must first refine the heart; after refining the heart, one must subdue the qi; after subduing qi, whether asleep or awake, the Way is within. The Way is not in sitting.” Fazhen did not understand. Lü then watched a monk sitting in meditation for a long time; suddenly a small snake appeared atop his head, slithered down the left bedpost into the chamber pot, climbed the flower stand, passed the drain. Lü stabbed the snake with a knife; it fled to the right bedpost and returned into the monk’s head. This showed the heart ground was not pure, transforming into a poisonous snake, full of illusions and delusions—how could one attain the Way?  

Also, Master Ma sat motionless in the long forest and was mocked for polishing bricks as mirrors. In sum, the cultivator must not separate from the Way in walking, standing, sitting, or lying. Zi Si said: “The Way cannot be left for a moment; if it can be left, it is not the Way.” Yet this Way is subtle and not to be grasped by a mere step. Better is my master’s teaching: nature is the compassionate thing, life is the primordial qi mist within the body; constantly savoring the thoughts of settling the heart and harmonizing the will, the lively and vigorous qi, never letting a breath stray, never letting a thought mix—this is what the ancients meant by “walking, standing, sitting, lying, never leaving this,” this is nature and life, nature and life are the Supreme Ultimate. This is the work of the mind and the fundamental learning.  

Moreover, learning begins with not deceiving the dark room, also called careful solitude. Always illuminating and reflecting on one’s own seeing, hearing, speech, and movement, instantly extinguishing anything that violates Heaven’s principle. Such refining of the heart is nowhere not the Way. Especially necessary is breath regulation, which is the study of refining life. Yet breath regulation is not breath holding. It must be slowly practiced: at first there is breath, then breath becomes faint, then breath vanishes—this is the true study of life. Hence it is said: “Subdue qi, do not merely hold qi; hold qi, do not live long; to live long, one must subdue qi.” This subduing must be understood clearly, not merely holding breath for a few counts. The heart must have no in or out, breath no in or out; only then is nature and life cultivated together. Yet even this is not enough.  

Life begins with a single thought. I must recognize the true one thought from chaos as the foundation of the elixir, and from the arising and clashing of true qi with form as the embryo of the elixir. Then practicing the river cart method, the Way of long life is attained. Such cultivation is unlike Fazhen’s twenty years of sitting meditation without meeting a master, gaining nothing. Now that you know this method, you must use a clear illuminating mind, never ceasing the heart. After three years, the Great Way will surely be completed. In sum, refining the heart and subduing qi must be practiced together. If only refining the heart, body and life are hard to protect; if only subduing qi, even with long life one is a fool. Life must use both as method, never leaving either moment.

### Four  
The Way says to refine oneself; it is not possible to refine the original nature’s brightness by solitary sitting in quiet and comfort. Therefore, Lü refined the Way in wine shops and brothels; Qiu nurtured the elixir in pleasure houses. Even the highest root vessels must thus temper their nature and temperament, returning to simplicity. How much more so for beginners, who must grind and grind again to remove private temperaments and the veil of desire!  

Not to speak of signs of success, even now wishing to practice the river cart method and return the jade elixir to extend life, without several setbacks, how can one see through the dusty world? Without seeing through, though cultivating, one is still bound by lust, wealth, favor, and love, clinging until old age and even in death. You live in rich seats and thick shoes, accustomed to comfort and ease, rarely tormented. Thus, placed amid waves and turmoil, noise and bustle unbearable, only upon reaching stillness do you taste joy, realizing wives, children, and all are dust ties; even the flesh and blood body is but a vessel of illusion. Except for the Way, all is unrelated to me.  

When dust and filth are cleared, medicine has medicine, yang has yang, fire has fire, elixir has elixir. Otherwise, with a body full of private desires, how can lead flowers emerge? Even if there is water and fire, spirit and qi not ruined, once the heart runs away, how can Kan and Li unite? Yin and yang fail to harmonize; whence then comes the primal one qi? Confucius’s three admonitions and Yan Hui’s four prohibitions are truly the highest principles of the sage and key words for refining oneself. Yet even this is not enough.  

Cultivation mainly depends on essence, qi, and spirit. If essence is not treasured and qi not abundant, spirit does not enter qi, qi does not submit to spirit, and they cannot meld as one. It is like male essence and female blood each in their place, not united—how can sons be born? The cultivator seeks one primordial true qi. At first water and fire do not mix; how can true lead be produced? When true yang moves, without practicing the river cart method to mate Qian and Kun, how can the elixir be formed? When spirit is clear and qi clear, yet not condensed, how can there be breathless breath to form the primordial dharma body, spiritless spirit to match the two great Qian and Kun?  

You must recognize the primordial essence, qi, and spirit, then refine them. Facing beautiful scenes without moving, letting the bustling splendor not shift you, only advancing fire and moving talismans, metal born in water, advancing fire with measure, fire wrapped but not unleashed, retreating talisman with effect, daily moving your own mercury to envelop and solidify yang essence. This is the essential study of refining oneself, also the true work of transforming temperament.  

I wish for beginners in self-refinement not to spare toil and fatigue, so that upon entering the chamber, the six senses are greatly settled, a single thought does not arise, naturally reaching the state of murky chaos, vague and dim. This is the primordial one qi coming from emptiness and nothingness, also the mysterious gate’s one aperture arising from non-being to being, akin to the moment I first received breath at birth. Why? Because in past lives, entering and seizing the body, from vague and dim one thought arises, merging with parents’ essence and blood. Now, if not following but opposing, then yin and yang Kan and Li gather in one place to seek my primordial true intention and true qi.  

True intention is the master of my incarnation; true qi is the house of my incarnation. True intention is the principle given by Heaven to form nature; true qi is the fate given by Heaven to form shape. Only when self-refinement is perfected can true spirit and true qi mix with the clear, empty, numinous yang qi of Heaven and Earth as one. Then advancing and retreating, warming and nurturing day and night without slackening, over time form transforms and the Way of immortality is achieved.  

Today’s learners do not know the importance of refining oneself, recklessly practicing for a moment hoping to obtain medicine and form elixir, not only useless but also like wild horses and monkeys, moving recklessly, stirring postnatal fire, surely harming the elixir and burning the body, not only unable to dispel disease and extend life, but increasing illness and hastening death. I urge you all. The key is to endure hardship and insult, expel one’s inner demons, accumulate merit and virtue, eliminate external obstacles from kalpas, and naturally Heaven’s gods will protect you; then the great elixir can be formed.

### Five  
The Way of alchemy begins with the seeking of the void in the midst of fullness, the fullness in the midst of void. When the yang qi first stirs, then use the fullness in the midst of void to meet the void in the midst of fullness. The names of fullness and void must have their meanings. You must know that yang gives birth to form; once taken and refined, it dissolves into void. Such void is the medicine of emptiness and purity, the elixir of emptiness and purity. This is the unformed body residing in a bright moon.  

If one can thoroughly realize the origin and not fall into the rut of the common man, when it is “full” it is the void within fullness; when it is “void” it is the fullness within void. Though one yang first moves, the time of the living seed arrives, the qi mechanism seems to have form, yet the heart ultimately has nothing; it is still primordial fullness, this is true fullness. When the medicine qi returns, mercury and lead blend as one. Though called void, the flow of qi mechanism is not entirely like void. Such void is the fullness within void, the true void.  

Thus fullness and void are but the rise and fall of qi mechanism, yet the true origin does not lie within fullness or void, nor outside fullness or void. In sum, that which flows and moves is qi; that which is empty, bright, and penetrating is spirit. Only within qi mechanism, having this clear spiritual scene, can it be attained.  

I further show you the essentials of spirit and qi. When qi is produced and moves, yet the heart and spirit are not greatly joyful, this spirit has not yet united with qi—so-called lead arrives but mercury does not respond. If heart and spirit are joyful but qi mechanism is not fully abundant and overflowing, this qi has not yet united with spirit—so-called mercury is cast but lead does not come. When lead and mercury merge as one, then with the Tathāgata’s empty heart and the true person’s deep breath, they consume and devour in the yellow chamber. When stillness reaches its extreme, then movement arises, rushing fire; when movement reaches its extreme, then stillness must stop talisman, allowing it to rise and fall freely, going and coming as one, harmonizing with Heaven and Earth’s creation, with sun and moon’s waxing and waning—this is the small circulation method.  

The ancients said one day has twelve hours, all may be used; when aware, use it; when unaware, do not. If practicing the great circulation method, it is unlike the small circulation with gaps, called no coming and no going, no advancing and no retreating, no increase or decrease, no adding or subtracting, one day and one night continuous and dense, without division or cessation, moving thus, still thus, walking, sitting, lying all thus. The key is only one illuminating heart always aware, never interrupted. If interrupted even briefly, it is no different from running the elixir, hence the great circulation is the great creation of refining spirit and returning to emptiness.  

I teach you, first refining the heart is essential. Today many cultivators do not start here, and many later fall away. Take heed.

### Six  
The primordial spirit is the master controller of alchemical refinement. Without this primordial spirit, the medicine is but ordinary essence, useless, unable to form the embryo; the returned elixir without this primordial spirit is but illusion, unable to form the infant. I secretly wonder at the cultivators of the world who only know essence and qi as treasures but do not know primordial spirit as master. Even if they say they have formed medicine, it is only to preserve the colored body, how can they form the sacred embryo? I now reveal to you.  

The so-called cooking and refining of the yang spirit is precisely this primordial spirit, gathered and taken, accumulated day by day, growing full month by month. Otherwise, why not say “yang essence and yang qi” but must say “yang spirit”? Know then that alchemists refine this primordial spirit as the master. Yet this is the supreme method for forming the great liquid golden return elixir. For the middle and lower grades, though not wholly using yang spirit, they cannot be without it. Without yang spirit, ordinary essence and qi cannot condense in body and mind to grow into long life and immortal. The supreme method is purely yang spirit alone, though not without essence and qi, only using them as assistants. You must recognize primordial spirit clearly before it can act.  

Primordial spirit is the Infinite and the Supreme Ultimate. When it is empty, still, and without event, turbid and formless, indescribable; when qi mechanism is touched, suddenly it responds and leaps into movement. This leap is the true primordial spirit. The Book of Changes says: “Still and unmoving, yet sensing and thus communicating with all under Heaven.” When unmoved, prior thoughts are future mind; when moved, lingering thoughts are past mind; sudden responses and sudden stops are primordial spirit’s function. If there is calculation, unable to respond and forget freely, this is called present mind—not primordial spirit. Taking this brings pollution; even if nurtured, it is hard to soar and transform, coming and going freely.  

I now briefly expose this; you must diligently practice to take it. Yet it is subtle beyond subtle! Marvelous indeed! Without supreme root vessel and superior knowledge and insight, it cannot be spoken of. Also, the mysterious gate’s one aperture is this occasional stirring yang spirit; the mysterious female gate is also this yang spirit’s trigger. Yet they differ. The mysterious female gate is after yin and yang mate, when the one qi begins to swell and mist. Yang spirit is the numinous and aware qi within the misty lively qi. Though two, ultimately one. Hence the Supreme One says: “The valley spirit never dies; this is the mysterious female gate.” Without this yang spirit in alchemy, what is lost is great.  

Yet this primordial spirit is also pure and clean, without impurity or stain, one heart and one virtue’s true intention. When still, primordial spirit presides; when moving, primordial spirit presides; when gathered as medicine, primordial spirit operates and turns. The use of primordial spirit is truly great. Be sure to comprehend it well. Do not add a single thought or intention. Throughout the twelve hours of the day, always moving and always aware, always responding and always still, fear not the myriad disturbances—all are the workings of this primordial spirit. Otherwise, falling into postnatal shell, that little glimmer of spirit hides and disappears.

### Seven  
In this world, who can leap beyond yin and yang, not bound by fate and qi? Moreover, wind, cold, heat, and dampness easily invade. In the weak, these evil qi cause many illnesses. What suffering and vexation is this! Furthermore, wealth and poverty, honor and disgrace, sickness, old age, death, right and wrong, separation and union, joy and sorrow—all are unavoidable. Alas! Life in Heaven and Earth is truly a prison. You now dwell in the burning house; have you realized the suffering of life? Would you not rather enjoy the joy of immortality? Fortunately, the Great Way remains transmitted; you must apply your heart and practice, completing a kalpa to avoid the troubles of birth after birth.  

I rejoice for you, yet also warn you. Rejoice that you have heard the Way, and thus have the foundation to become immortal. Danger lies in neglecting cultivation, making it hard to transcend Heaven and Earth. I show you a method. When love and attachment cannot be severed, grit your teeth and cut them off; when you cannot let go, endure and abandon them from your heart. At first it is forced; over time, desire falls away, burdens vanish, and the golden immortal’s stage is entered. Otherwise, half up and half down, dragging mud and water, never escaping the Three Realms.  

Moreover, those with virtue have the Way; one part of virtue refined, the Way condenses one part; ten parts of virtue, ten parts of Way. Thus the Supreme One’s three thousand merits and eight hundred practices are the foremost tasks of cultivating immortality. When the fruit of the Way is complete, looking back on human wealth and honor is truly filthy and unbearable, hated and avoided. Consider the clear empty one qi—how can it admit dregs? Like wearing court robes and crowns, would you consort with those in mud and filth? You must strive. My master never deceived you with a word.  

Recently I taught you to take yang, which is to take primordial spirit. Also said to have primordial spirit govern within—is this not spirit serving spirit? No. The yang taken is primordial spirit; the spirit taken is true intention. Using true intention to gather primordial spirit, accumulating essence and qi, refining and tempering, primordial spirit grows strong and the golden elixir can be formed. Also said the metal of the water palace is lead born after guǐ; thus lead subdues mercury, then the primordial one qi emerges, cooked and fed, refined into the mysterious yellow precious treasure, called the great liquid golden return. Yet I still have more to say.  

Though medicine is obtained, there must be the right fire timing; if fire timing is unclear, the elixir will never form. The ancients said: “Medicine arises in the mysterious aperture; fire timing ignites the yang furnace.” At this time metal is refined; only a little true intention is needed to gather and receive it. Before medicine emerges, it is good to gently warm the lead cauldron; hence: “Before medicine emerges, fierce fire is needed; after medicine returns to the furnace, gentle warming is appropriate.” This shows the fire of medicine’s birth is martial fire; the fire of medicine’s return is literary fire. Martial and literary fire differ only in intention and non-intention. The rest of the circulation fire timing is but gentle spirit fire, neither rushing nor lingering, thus no danger. Hence it is said: “Condense spirit, soften intention.” If spirit does not condense, elixir does not gather; if intention is not soft, fire is not pure; fire impure, elixir hard to form. Thus at rising and falling there is bathing, withdrawing, and adding—this alone.  

When medicine qi reaches the upper mud pellet, one must concentrate without scattering, a single thought not arising, gathering spirit and forming a mass, warming a moment. Then the brain’s yin essence transforms into sweet dew spirit water, dripping into the crimson palace, refining a moment, then transforming into golden liquid, returning to the elixir field, nurturing into a pearl. Here one must gently warm the lead cauldron to seal and solidify. Yet this sealing is not to think inside or outside; if the elixir palace inside gathers a moment and is cooked into medicine, few know it. This palace is extremely pure, empty, mysterious, and bright. Falling into postnatal, there is blockage of dregs; spirit is not clear, heart not nimble, often falling into confusion. If one can gather half a moment, turbid qi descends, clear qi rises, always communicating with Heaven and Earth’s light and pure qi. If long nurtured, clear qi fills and turbid qi departs, not only is the body healthy and the color bright, but the great liquid golden return is also the accumulation of this quiet nurturing.

### Eight  
The so-called true one qi is the primordial qi before the division of chaos, the initial qi when chaos first opens; Heaven, Earth, humans, and all beings are born from it; becoming immortal and Buddha is no exception. Therefore, cultivators must recognize this qi clearly before it can act. Within the human body, though permeating essence, qi, and spirit, it leaves no trace to seek; it is not the ordinary breath of mouth and nose, nor the numinous qi of spirit and perception, nor the moving qi of heart and kidney. It dwells in the primordial but is unseen in the primordial; dwells in the postnatal but is unseen in the postnatal; in the primordial it is born from yin and yang; in the postnatal it is hidden within yin and yang.  

The so-called “abundant benevolence” is the boundless development of this qi; “vast Heaven” is the qi’s fullness without gap; “deep abyss” is the qi’s hidden return without trace. Chengzi said: “When released, it fills the six directions; when rolled up, it retreats and hides in the secret.” The Doctrine of the Mean says: “Speak greatly, none under Heaven can contain; speak small, none under Heaven can break.” This means its manifest brightness reaches everywhere, penetrating every subtle place without gap or leak. Ah, the primordial qi in Heaven and humans is thus extreme. Do you know if life has ever met it?  

Recently, as your qi mechanism first stirs, its coming is without cause, its thread still slight, not necessarily at this realm. Yet by holding firmly and surely in the faint and slight breath of dawn and night, accumulating day by day and month by month, this qi flows everywhere. At this stage, you know the true one qi can transcend the Three Realms and escape the Six Paths, not entering the Five Phases or Eight Trigrams. What is the spirit transformation of this qi? Though not postnatal essence, qi, and spirit, nor primordial essence, qi, and spirit, it is the root of postnatal essence, qi, and spirit, the master of primordial essence, qi, and spirit. Unimaginable, unthinkable—how then can it be refined into a grain of millet? No other way but to gather primordial yin and yang to form primordial qi, brewing long in the void cave. If you do not know to gather primordial qi from postnatal yin and yang, after years you will not obtain true one qi; even if you glimpse a faint shadow, you cannot avoid mistaking true for false, illusion for emptiness, ending as a common man. Though the foundation of cultivation is not apart from postnatal yin and yang, it must only borrow postnatal qi to gather primordial qi. If you obtain primordial qi, then postnatal common qi is but dung—what use is it?  

When you obtain this primordial qi, know to keep quiet and still day and night, not letting external evils enter, nor true qi leak out. Accumulate it long, purify it clean, freely nourish the vast qi, transcending Heaven and Earth’s yin and yang. Then human desires gradually vanish, Heaven’s principle fully intact. The usual seven emotions and eight recognitions vanish without trace. This qi can transform desire into principle, turn killing into life. If you can recognize this qi as true and work day and night, you will surely gain long benefit. Otherwise, difficult indeed.  

If sitting in meditation, do not first let the six roots and six dusts remain; let go completely, resting deeply. Suddenly drawing ordinary breath up and down, hoping for this true one qi, none has obtained it. Only after great stillness does true yin and true yang show signs. Then I use the primordial spirit of the mysterious gate to shine down on the water palace; the water palace’s metal naturally swells and mists, surging from the lower elixir field, called “golden lotus rising from the earth.” Then I draw back to the central palace, adding spirit fire to warm long. This qi then floods and rises to the mud pellet, called “Heaven’s precious canopy hanging.” I gather it a moment, storing it in the secret place, following Heaven and Earth’s creation, harmonizing waxing and waning numbers. If thus, and no elixir forms, it has never happened. This is revealed in the Book of Changes’ Qian hexagram: “Initial nine, hidden dragon”—the great rest; “Nine two, dragon appears”—primordial qi stirs in the lower elixir field; “Nine three, morning Qian evening alert”—returning qi to the central palace, no thought inside or outside, preventing danger; “Nine four, leaping abyss”—long quiet nurturing, suddenly a thread of true qi surges from the lower elixir field, yet not truly so, hence “perhaps”; “Nine five, flying dragon”—qi rises to the mud pellet, yang qi at its peak; “Top nine, arrogant dragon regrets”—qi moves to extreme, wanting stillness, I must lead it back to the void aperture, never coveting pleasure, letting qi shine long without excess.  

Do you deeply understand the Way of Changes? Have you realized it?

Previously I showed the mysterious gate’s one aperture, the true heart method passed down by myriad sages. When you begin work, you must slightly close both eyes, illuminating between the inner and outer elixir fields, neither close nor far, neither forgetting nor aiding. After long time, one breath leaves, one breath comes, breath upon breath depending on each other, faintly seeming to be and not to be, seeming empty and not empty. The breath of mouth and nose seems without in or out—this is the ordinary breath ceasing and true breath appearing. Sitting until breath returns to origin, the time has come.  

When you reach this, not knowing what to do next, you often find this true breath first moving, hastily descend, unwilling to patiently sit still to refine qi and return spirit. Though you can preserve the postnatal colored body, you cannot see the primordial true man. Upon reaching this, you must further refine, slowly blowing the primordial breath into the furnace, harmonizing long. Suddenly you feel the elixir field bubbling and stirring, seeming not to be but seeming to be, seeming false but seeming true, as if a clear bright qi scene appears, but you must not awaken bright awareness. If bright awareness arises, you fall into postnatal consciousness and cannot speak of primordial mystery. You must gather all bright awareness, not use even a bit—this is what the scriptures mean by “gathering brightness, clarifying spirit, sitting quietly.” After long muddle, essence naturally transforms into qi, qi into spirit, and the primordial one true origin manifests, the mysterious gate’s one aperture opens wide.  

Yet though the aperture opens, without fierce spirit fire cooking and urgent refining, you cannot adapt to circumstances, cannot enter or exit freely. Often upon seeing desire, love arises; upon seeing fear, dread arises. With primordial qi not strong, primordial spirit not mature, you cannot follow roundness to roundness, square to square, but float with the world, rising and falling with time. Only by gently regulating breath continuously, nurturing qi deeply, can you have a heart that masters itself, never letting surprise, anger, joy, or sorrow enter to disturb spirit and brightness. Is this not what Mencius called “a great man who dwells broadly, stands upright, walks the Great Way, not corrupted by wealth and honor, not moved by poverty and lowliness, not bowed by power and might”?  

Now you begin work, not necessarily having this scene, but not entirely without it. When the aperture first opens, the function is slight; after long nurturing, you naturally gather what ordinary breath could not hold; what ordinary heart and spirit could not settle, now naturally settles. Zhuzi said: “Last night by the river, spring water rose; a huge warship is but a hair’s weight; all previous efforts wasted; today it freely sails midstream.” This movement is true movement. Otherwise, qi is still coarse, spirit often wandering, not yet true manifestation. To see the true aperture, only by breath regulation, heart stillness, qi leisure, spirit peace is the true handle. Otherwise, acting to act, thinking to get, may also have aperture movement, but only momentary, fleeting, not like this natural arising from stillness preserving movement, able to last long. You must firmly grasp this and advance with one force; why fear not reaching celestial and earthly immortal status?

Life in the world is less enduring than grass and trees that grow endlessly. One lifetime as human, next reincarnation falls to beast path; one life blessed, next life suffers cruel punishment. Is this not Heaven and Earth’s lack of compassion? Even ignorant grass and trees know to return to root and origin, completing endless cycles of birth and growth. Humans, however, are bound by qi and obscured by matter, daily diminishing, unable to restore their original Heaven. Thus though Heaven has the grace of birth and nurture, rain and dew, it is as if life’s principle does not persist, the day of vitality ends. Why so? My master, pitying the world, specially teaches return to root and origin, to be free forever from birth and death; if not, at least to preserve the root and not sink deeply into the Three Paths and Six Realms.  

I always say the best start is the human eye. The eye is the light of spirit. Learners often greedily seek external light shining before their eyes, thinking golden light shining forth is proof of true cultivation. How little they know Heaven’s Way values gathering, not dispersing; human Way is no different. The ancient immortals said: “The sun’s flowing pearl always wishes to leave people; if reversed and received, golden splendor is hidden within.” If you do not know to reverse and dislike following, always letting spirit light shine outside, rushing in sights, sounds, speech, and movement, greed, anger, ignorance, and love—all fading daily—how can you long keep this body? How much more the body outside the body, lasting for millions of years? Only by drawing the curtain and sealing the veil, always gathering a bit of spirit light into the void cave, neither out nor in, without worry or thought, over time the golden light nourishes enough, naturally transforming into yang spirit to master the body, and can transform into millions of yang spirits filling the void above and below, becoming the most mysterious and wondrous immortals—not merely one bright spirit seeing the Tathāgata!  

But beware, the sun’s flowing pearl wishes to leave people; if you follow its flow and chase it, primordial spirit is shackled, primordial qi lost, vitality ends. This method is not difficult; only a little intention is needed to gather the eye’s light.  

Previously I said primordial spirit governs within. Where is primordial spirit in the body, where does it dwell? Some say “the square inch of the heart is the home of primordial spirit,” some say “within the mysterious gate is the residence of primordial spirit,” others say “the heavenly valley primordial spirit, guarding it is true.” These three places are all where primordial spirit dwells. But where to start at the beginning? The Book of Changes says: “Wash the heart and retreat to concealment.” The ancients also said: “The square inch of the heart is my body’s hall; within the mysterious aperture is my body’s chamber.” People guard spirit in the square inch of the heart, but ears and eyes enter and shake its essence. Cultivators gather spirit in the mysterious aperture, ears and eyes have no door but peek through cracks. Thus, at the start, you must gather spirit in the mysterious gate aperture, within the void circle, nearly murky chaos, dim and dark, no one, no self, no place, no Heaven, only then can you nurture the undivided primordial spirit. If not concealed in a secret place, but always clear and bright in the square inch, you will surely rush into worldly emotions and thoughts, never resting day or night.  

What is the heavenly valley? The human head has nine palaces; among them is one called the heavenly valley, pure and dustless, able to place primordial spirit there, never wandering outside, then true realization and sagehood are right there. Hence the Yellow Court Scripture says: “If you desire not to die, cultivate Kunlun.” This shows guarding the heavenly valley has infinite subtlety. Do you know it?

### Eleven  
If you desire to return to root and restore life, only let this heart be released, lightly and faintly, to listen to the coming and going of breath. If breath is too coarse and floating, spirit also disperses, unable to return to the original aperture to master the body. If breath seems faint and uncertain, ordinary breath will stop, fetal breath will appear, and the original heart can be seen. The ancients said: “The heart easily flees; use breath to purify it.” If you do not know to listen to breath to gather heart and contract qi, spirit is hard to condense, breath hard to regulate, heart and breath hard to depend on each other. This listening to breath is the wonderful secret of condensing spirit and regulating breath.  

If spirit enters qi, refining breath returning to spirit, clear qi naturally rises, turbid qi naturally descends, and the whole body and Heaven and Earth become naturally clear and peaceful. When Heaven is clear and Earth peaceful, you glimpse a clear empty one qi circulating within and without the body, not just the discovery of fetal breath. You must know this fetal breath is not ordinary breath of mouth and nose, not moving qi of the elixir field, not numinous qi of perception. It is the primordial one qi before parents were born; after parents are born, a segment of true spirit; nature obtains it and has form; heart obtains it and has function; in Heaven it is the pivot; on Earth it is the axis; in humans it is the origin of returning to root and restoring life.  

If one desires sages, saints, or Heaven, without this fetal breath, there is no place for creation. Recently you work only by illuminating heart and spirit at the border of inside and outside, empty heart listening to breath’s coming and going, so spirit depends on breath and stands, qi obtains spirit and merges, the prenatal fetal breath can be seen and known. Therefore, this fetal breath is truly the key task of cultivation. Is it easy to obtain? The ancients said: “The work of entering meditation lies in stopping and observing.” Why stop? Stop at the elixir field below the navel. Why observe? Observe the void and lawless aperture. Thus heart and spirit settle, wisdom light grows daily, always illuminating the unseen, unheard, soundless, scentless place, and fetal breath always remains therein.  

If you only roughly settle breath without entering great stillness, this fetal breath is not true. I fear you have not reached the state of effortless ease, and when ordinary breath stops briefly, you say fetal breath moves automatically—that is far wrong. When fetal breath truly moves, the whole body softens like cotton, exquisitely joyful beyond words, true breath surging and merging, flowing throughout body and limbs, rising and falling naturally, breath steaming warmly like spring awakening from sleep, limbs relaxed and free, truly indescribable. At this stage, clear qi rises to the mud pellet palace, suddenly a clear numinous qi surges to the mysterious gate, and ears, eyes, mouth, and nose feel great brightness, unlike ordinary times.  

Other fetal breath stops briefly, and fetal breath also moves, but none like this great stillness and great quiet for self-possession. Yesterday I taught to rest spirit in the mud pellet, only using a bit of spirit light silently facing the upper palace, not too intent. Too much intent moves postnatal turbid qi; like Heaven originally clear suddenly clouded, then the clear is no longer clear. The details here, you must slowly ponder.

### Twelve  
When sitting quietly, one heart returns to illuminate the void ancestral aperture, ensuring no knowledge, no thought, dust and filth all empty, clarity appears. Perhaps from murky chaos emerges a bit of true intention, the primordial intention. From this arises awareness, the primordial awareness; from this arises movement, the primordial movement. This is not a rare moment; observing at all times, all is so. But fear the murky state without dregs, yet placed in dullness, without control. Or suddenly in chaos a clear vast scene appears, too joyous and excited, disturbed by the heart of liking good things and seeking merit. No wonder the mysterious gate’s aperture, the more sought, the less seen.  

Now I teach you at the moment of movement and stillness, whether qi mechanism moves or not, I only use the illuminating heart to perceive and guard, so the master always remains, and the great elixir is not difficult to form. In sum, clear spirit comes from chaos; hence the ancients said: “The key to cultivating the Way is not in dust and toil, nor in mountains, but must seek the remote end of dimness.” This remote end is the time of utmost emptiness and deepest stillness. When emptiness is extreme and stillness profound, true essence, true qi, true spirit arise from this.  

The ancients said when the mysterious aperture opens, it is like the Supreme Ultimate moving, yin and yang divide here; also called Fuxi’s first stroke, the two forces appear here, with myriad changes and transformations, infinite and boundless, all established from this moment of chaos. Thus the mysterious gate’s aperture is always present; only need one awakening heart to illuminate and master it, then the mysterious gate is always present and the Supreme Ultimate always condensed. The only trouble is people do not enter the remote dimness, not the mysterious gate failing to manifest.  

Know this remote dimness is not empty and obtainable; it must come from extreme movement to stillness, true intention arriving to create transformation, then entering the remote dimness. When stillness is extreme and movement arises, yin and yang mate, deciding undecided, undecided wanting to decide, in a vague and dim state, suddenly true lead arises—this is the mysterious gate’s phenomenon, all depending on primordial spirit to preside.  

My master has seen students lost in this message long ago; now I reveal the wonderful principle in one breath, so you know the mysterious gate’s one aperture is always present, nowhere not so, only governed by primordial spirit. As for qi mechanism’s waxing and waning, listen to its rise and fall, but never let the master be affected by its rise and fall—this is the true wonderful secret.  

My master yesterday spoke of fetal breath; this too must be clear. Fetal breath is not ordinary breath of mouth and nose, not moving qi of elixir field, not numinous qi of perception. Originally, before birth, father’s essence and mother’s blood mate into a lump, at this time a turbid thing without breath coming or going, only a faint warmth linked to the mother’s navel. After birth, cutting the umbilical cord, breathing begins through mouth and nose, and Heaven and Earth’s one bit of numinous yang qi falls into the middle elixir field. When ordinary breath arises, fetal breath separates; if no bit of primordial qi stays in the middle, it has left the mother’s womb.  

Yet do not say it is gone. If one can focus heart and spirit, remove illusions, return light and reflect at the brow and nose apertures, naturally condensing from the qi sea upward to the mud pellet, then descending to the middle elixir field, is this not fetal breath? Yet primordial fetal breath cannot operate without ordinary breath; ordinary breath cannot master without primordial fetal breath. If ordinary breath stops, true mechanism appears, all ordinary breath is fetal breath. If thoughts are not removed, dust heart not pure, even fetal breath is ordinary breath. Know this.  

The Way of cultivation is the same as the Way of Heaven and Earth’s opening. Now the lower yuan, the world is degenerate, human hearts treacherous, also severe. Without water, fire, knife, and weapon kalpas to clear them, how can chaos end? The human body is the same. At this time of strong private desire and declining blood qi, if one does not begin from extreme movement to gradually reach stillness, then human heart does not die, Way heart does not arise, ordinary breath not removed, true breath unseen. One must at the moment of extreme movement and stillness suddenly have true intention preside—this intention belongs to yin, called the earth of self. Soon, vague and dim, like dream not dream, awake not awake, in this stillness suddenly a thread of warmth, turbid and continuous, surging and rising—this is spirit merging and qi flowing, meeting in the yellow chamber, naturally arising without stimulus. This is the mysterious gate’s sign, the Supreme Ultimate’s foundation. Only use a bit of true heart to issue true intention to gather it—this intention belongs to yang, called earth of wu. Actually, one intention is just dividing movement and stillness into two earths, wu and ji. Because the mysterious female gate is not open, in chaos this true intention presides, with no desire to observe the mystery. When the mysterious female gate opens and true mechanism appears, desire arises to observe the aperture. One is the nameless beginning of Heaven and Earth; one is the mother of all named things. Heaven, Earth, humans, and beings are all governed by this bit of true intention. I hasten to run true intention so as not to be disturbed by false thoughts, moved and yet not distracted. Thus Heaven’s gate is in me, Earth’s axis by heart, universe in body, all things born from heart, all this spiritual awareness operates and presides. Therefore, a bit of true intention first, true mechanism not yet manifest, taking it is useless; a bit later, ordinary thoughts arise, taking it is mixed. You must clearly recognize this, purely preside by true intention, not scattering. Over time qi mechanism grows strong, freely going where it will, I add no thought or view, only illuminate and preside—this is enough. But you only just see form, must gather in stillness. When qi mechanism grows strong, stillness triggers Heaven’s mechanism, swift as thunder; even in noisy places, bustling towns, the mechanism cannot be stopped. You must have a spiritually aware heart, so no error occurs.

### Thirteen  
Cultivation is no other marvelous method than to observe Heaven’s Way and hold Heaven’s conduct. Like spring and summer, fruit trees flourish, flowers and grasses fill the fields, how vigorous and boundless is this! Who knows that within the flourishing is also gathering and restraining? The ancients said summer solstice yin is born, yet it is later. Autumn and winter, things wither and fade, frost and snow congeal, how bleak is this scene! Who knows that within destruction is also the seed of flourishing? The ancients said winter solstice yang is born, yet not yet. From this we see yang gives birth to yin, yin contains yang.  

Cultivators, when dragons and tigers fight, water and fire shoot each other, like spring and summer’s growth, you must be calm and free, clearly understanding, not moving with qi mechanism’s movement—this is yin born within yang. When qi mechanism is still, dragon descends tiger hides, water hard fire soft, the two unite as one—this is autumn and winter’s gathering and storing. At this time you must enter a vague and dim realm, neither dull like sleep nor bright like endless light, but in silence having a clear awareness. When you do not move with qi mechanism’s stillness, this is yin containing yang.  

I further say: cultivators must sweep away all idle thoughts and distractions, rough breath and violent qi gathered, then all ordinary yin and yang cease outside, and true yin and true yang begin to arise inside. The ancients said: “If one wants not to die, one must first die to the human.” If one does not patiently sit quietly to remove ordinary thoughts and ordinary breath and qi, even if one says heart is still and spirit peaceful, it is still coarse spirit, insufficient to attain the Way. Only when swept completely clean, breath faint and uncertain, thoughts and spirit neither out nor in, I quietly and dimly sit as master in the courtyard, unmoving and unshaken, thus warming and nurturing, true yang naturally emerges from the void cave. If not arising spontaneously but pushed by the mind, moving the dipper, all is fabrication and thought, endlessly moving and shifting, year after year, month after month, only postnatal conscious spirit stirring postnatal common qi, not able to form elixir. You must at the time of heart and breath depending, yin and yang mating, nurture long and deeply, surely condensing true yin and true yang into a grain of millet, then there is true seed.  

Even with true seed, do not rush to success or expect jade liquid elixir to form. You must wait for this millet pearl to be purified by water and fire, yin and yang nurtured, truly mature and strong, like the fetus and infant in the mother’s womb, with organs, limbs, and all complete, then a perfect person can be formed. I see you often upon entering dimness, immediately starting calculating thoughts; or else drifting dimly asleep, not using the master to calm spirit and sit quietly to guard within. Thus all cultivators have elixir, but because of arising bright awareness mixing with postnatal conscious spirit, it scatters; or because bright awareness does not arise, or spirit is dull and qi tired, it perishes. Hence elixir does not form, Way is hard to complete. From now on, whenever sitting quietly, no matter dim or not, always let primordial spirit issue true intention to preside; when dim realm arrives, yin and yang mate as one, I preside with true intention; even in long dimness, true yang arises, I also preside with primordial spirit to transform it, never adding a view or thought or intention—this is my master’s supreme cultivation Way.

### Fourteen  
Recently in cultivation, when sitting down to store spirit and listen, you must put down all attachments, then draw the curtain and seal the veil, return light and reflect within the mysterious one aperture. At first spirit may not condense, breath may be coarse; no harm to use a few breaths of martial fire, slightly unify your will, settle spirit. After a moment, spirit condenses, breath settles, then release heart and spirit, calmly observing the void aperture, only keeping heart to listen to breath. This listening has great method. Zhuangzi said: “Unify your will, listen not with ears but with heart; listen not with heart but with qi.”  

Know this qi is not breath of mouth and nose, not moving qi between kidneys, nor numinous qi in the heart. This qi is the empty void primordial qi that births Heaven, Earth, humans, and beings. Only by keeping heart on this void one qi does this heart and spirit correspond with the great harmonious primordial qi—called spirit and qi united, refined to form elixir. If attached to ordinary breath, it is spirit mingling with ordinary breath, how can elixir form? The scripture says: “Spiritless spirit is true spirit; breathless breath is true breath.” I must from chaos bring forth a bit of primordial true intention, using it to gather primordial qi, so primordial spirit and primordial qi unite, and the Great Way is completed.  

If there is coarse breath, I gently gather this ordinary qi to stillness. When ordinary breath stops, no matter if primordial qi moves or not, primordial qi is freely within. I must condense spirit to correct, hold intention to listen—this is also one end of yin and yang mating. Moreover, at the start, all apertures of mouth, nose, eyes can be firmly closed, only the ear aperture not fully closed. One heart to listen, ear aperture always closed, all apertures silent. This listening method is the first good cultivation method. Listening long naturally true yang grows, and the mysterious female gate appears.

### Fifteen  
Though Heaven and Earth are vast, there are spirits and ghosts ruling within, determining fortune and misfortune. The ancients said: “In dark rooms and leaky houses, ghosts and spirits are always present. They are near and above, not mere illusions, but truly present in your room.” Thus if one can quiet the heart, free from selfishness and desire, all that one interacts with are clear and vast spirits. If one is dull and blocked, deceitful and lewd, all summoned are demons and monsters. Clearly, like attracts like, qi seeks qi; all affairs under Heaven are so. Seeing this, can the work of careful solitude be neglected?  

I teach the method of listening to qi, also a name; only to teach you to close the three treasures, no floating qi leaking outside, so-called “not a bit of true qi leaks, and the great elixir can condense.” Also know that to listen without a listening method, if attached to trace or intention, falls into boundary and direction, cannot speak of the original Way. Know this? You must only condense spirit in the void, unite qi in the stillness, always awake to Heaven, lively to Earth, illuminating everywhere in the body, yet the body itself is not illuminated—this is the Way attained.  

As for the nose aperture, when father and mother mate into a lump, that essence and blood lump has a thread like a silk line wrapped around the body; then borrowing mother’s qi it gradually grows, becoming the Ren and Du meridians, hence the ancients said the nose is the ancestor. After birth, another gate opens, separately establishing Qian and Kun, and breathing begins. At this time primordial and postnatal qi are still united. When knowledge opens and desire arises, opposing pure external qi, it is a turbulent qi mass, and the clear empty qi of Heaven and Earth gradually diverges. Thus youth grows long and vigor fades, due to this.  

My master pities the world, life and death uncertain, endless reincarnation, so teaches return method, first teaching to observe the nose tip, imitating Heaven and Earth’s birth of beings, reversing and cultivating on the body to attain long life and immortality. Know this method is not principle. You must have seeing without seeing, heart without heart, then you get the essence. Others refine essence to qi, though a beginning foundation, know that without essence there is no qi or spirit, like a lamp without oil has no fire or light. If you only refine essence but do not know how essence is born, how can you use it? The Yellow Emperor said: “If essence is insufficient, supplement it with taste.” Later people explain this as moderate diet and light flavor. The ancients said: “Essence is born from stillness.” Some practitioners mistakenly move essence by massage and agitation. Guangchengzi said: “Do not shake your essence, do not tire your form, do not let your thoughts run busily, then you can live long.” This shows the way to preserve essence lies in no body movement and no mental distraction. The ancients said: “Essence moves with emotion; when essence wants to move, restrain emotion. Emotion arises from seeing; when emotion arises, close the eyes.” The way to preserve essence is here complete.  

If one can condense spirit and regulate breath in the square inch, one heart undivided, one breath not out, like Heaven’s qi descending and Earth’s qi ascending, fusing above and below, naturally forming rain. The birth of essence is no different. Only fear heart not still and breath not regulated, upper and lower not mixing, thus essence daily diminishes. When spirit fluid descends, no form or color visible, mud pellet yin essence transforms to sweet dew; this can be glimpsed but requires diligent cultivation. Otherwise, attachment and detachment both consume essence.  

When essence transforms to qi, spirit and qi mix, heart and breath depend on each other, body inside and outside peaceful and harmonious, soft as cotton—this is the sign of qi born. When qi is born, the mysterious gate aperture opens. The ancients said: “Yang qi begins to grow, this body naturally stands firm like a towering rock, this heart naturally settles like clear autumn moon pond.” Flowing and merging, its marvel is beyond description. Hence the ancients said: “Wonderful! The mysterious gate suddenly changes, like a woman conceiving. Breath occasionally stops, body and mind delightfully relaxed. Spirit and qi truly mingled, myriad apertures and channels open.” At this time one does not know spirit entering qi, qi entering spirit. Yet not entirely without event, only at extreme dimness is such a scene, silent yet clear, all slight movements inside and outside are perceived. Later refining qi to spirit, warming the mud pellet palace, clearing all yin haze and filth, seeing spirit but not qi. You understand this well, so as not to stray.

### Sixteen  
Cultivation advances one step further, reaching true emptiness and marvelous existence, then one is truly a great man with success and fame. Not to say cultivation to utmost emptiness and fineness cannot be measured in stages, even daily affairs and dealings are from shallow to deep, needing to reach no person, no self, no lifespan, no myriad beings’ forms to be truly harmonious.  

For example, when one desires goodness, one must first be told of cause and effect to be willing to give effort and wealth; after long practice, then told of benevolent and righteous conduct, not seeking merit or fame. From this, led into the Great Way, also a divine and sacred painstaking heart. Once Zhuangzi said: “Fame and profit are public tools of the world, only to be taken sparingly, not to be gained excessively. Benevolence and righteousness are temporary shelters of the world, only to be stayed in a night, not long.” Zhuangzi’s words truly see the Way.  

I said before, accumulating merit and virtue, no need to seek elsewhere, only diligently cultivate the Great Way in oneself, take it as responsibility, and also accept, uphold, and extend this Way to others. This is the merit of supporting the Way and protecting the teaching; no one surpasses this. Since you have heard the Great Way, you should take it as your own; your virtue is here, your merit is here; thus becoming true realization and sagehood is none other than here. Only fear weak practice; what need to seek merit outside?  

Yet this one method can only be told to those with deep attainment. If told to beginners, they may fall into self-satisfaction, only knowing to enrich body and family, not giving a hair, unable to move Heaven and Earth’s joy. Understand?  

Regarding the mysterious gate’s one aperture, I have repeatedly revealed it. You must know this message clearly to have a handle. The so-called original man is the bit of numinous yang qi when man first receives qi and forms shape. To cultivate the dharma body, is it not this numinous yang qi? The ancients said: “Medicine arises in the southwest, the Kun position; to seek Kun position, can one leave man? Clearly speaking, you must remember, only fear meeting and not recognizing the true.” This man is not like outer paths using boy and girl as partners, but the extreme of the Infinite, the Supreme Ultimate moving, and this bit of numinous yang qi is the foundation of man receiving qi and forming shape. If you get this original man, the Great Way naturally succeeds. Yet it is not easy. You must seek truth in the false, then this man can manifest.  

Man has a body; day and night water and fire mingle to form flesh and blood body, relying on the fire in the heart and water in the kidney to complete the work. To seek truth, must not seek escape yin from yang in postnatal water and fire; how else to start? Hence: “True is to borrow false to work.” Cultivators know the key of life and death, understand truth and falsehood, want to exhaust the initial bit of void primordial yang qi of life’s beginning, must first harmonize Kan and Li water and fire in the colored body. When postnatal water and fire are harmonized, then the one yang in Kan rises from below, the one yin in Li descends from above, meeting in the precarious void aperture, cooking and refining, and primordial one qi returns, the mysterious female gate’s sign. This one yang in Kan and one yin in Li are the inner treasure. Day and night spirit fire warms, not allowing a bit to leak—this is accumulating inner treasure. If you can find a wondrous aperture in your body and mind, this is inner method.  

Earlier I spoke of original man, the inner companion. The void precarious aperture is the inner earth. To refine spirit elixir, can these four not be complete? Inner method, treasure, companion, earth—I have revealed. Outer method, treasure, companion, earth you surely know; I will not repeat. With this true yin and true yang of Kan and Li, one breath out, when water is hard and fire soft, the cauldron empty and medicine solid, naturally primordial one yang qi arises neither from inside nor outside—this is called true lead, also called primordial Qian metal. Ordinary lead is the one yang in Kan and one yin in Li, all true lead. Primordial true lead, however, belongs to postnatal qi and substance. From this, consider: this true lead and true yang do not arise from Kan, nor from Li; originally from the void precarious aperture, refined by Kan and Li water and fire. I now reveal this to prevent you mistaking Kan’s yang qi as the foundation of our alchemy. Thus it is not mistaken.

### Seventeen  
Heaven and Earth gave birth to humans from the same Qian primordial one qi, this qi is the great harmonious qi, mingled and turbid in pure emptiness. Humans are formed by yin and yang pottery, born of Supreme Ultimate and yin and yang, still true yin and true yang without dregs, not far from the great harmonious primordial qi. After birth, qi is bound and matter obscures; yin and yang in the colored body all transform into thinking and perceiving spirit, breathing and moving qi, husband and wife exchanging essence, yin without yang, unfit for medicine, how can elixir form? You see postnatal essence and qi are all dregs. Though cultivation must borrow this to enter, forming elixir does not use this at all. Because it has form and color, it cannot form a void golden elixir.  

If cultivating nature only refines qi and temperament, refining life only refines flesh and blood life, not to speak of forming elixir, even if formed, it is illusionary elixir, falling into fox dens and snake and rat groups, ultimately Heaven’s gods anger, thunder and lightning punish, never again human body—how pitiful! The sage clearly knows the golden elixir Way is formed from pure numinous qi, which does not come naturally but must be gathered by true yin and true yang in the body, called “things of the same kind in twenty-eight.” You must know this primordial qi has no sign to seek, no place to measure. Where to seek and see? Only when your body’s true yin and true yang arise is primordial qi entering your body, capturing the numinous mercury and yin essence in your body, naturally condensing into elixir.  

The ancient immortals said: “Cultivators must first understand the twofold Heaven and Earth, twofold yin and yang, then begin work.” What are the twofold Heavens and Earth? Primordial and postnatal. What are the twofold yin and yang? When sitting, you must first rely on something in the postnatal colored body to begin. One breath in and out is yin and yang; yin and yang originally one qi, one qi scatters into yin and yang—this is ordinary yin and ordinary yang. When sitting, you must first regulate external breathing to raise true person’s primordial breath. Regulating external breathing must be led by intention. Mencius said: “Will is the commander of qi.” The ancient immortals said: “If you want to complete nine transformations, first refine self and hold heart.” Thus right heart and sincere intention are the foundation of cultivation.  

Regulate this breathing, illuminate the elixir field with the eyes, let breath descend into yin heel, raise yin heel qi to the yellow court, then use breath to raise crimson palace’s yin essence down to the elixir field—this too is ordinary yin and ordinary yang. Over time yin essence and yang qi mingle, condense in the elixir field’s earthen cauldron, naturally yin essence transforms to true yang essence, ordinary qi transforms to true yin qi, flourishing and filling the whole body—this is true yin and true yang, not far from primordial qi. You must know primordial qi has no form; its flourishing is true yin and true yang qi, not natural primordial qi. If you say natural primordial qi, you stray far from the Way.  

Know the peaceful and tranquil is primordial qi returning, not leaving yin and yang, nor mixing yin and yang. My master shows: every time you sit, you must have peaceful, natural, and self-possessed light scene, then you see your original face. Do not cling to primordial qi as if it were a single thing. My master’s teaching to this point is truly penetrating, revealing heart and liver to you. You must apply and practice, as Dong Zhongshu said: “Correct your aim without seeking profit, understand the Way without counting merit,” this suffices. As for effect or no effect, do not take joy or sorrow, then you are near.

Shaozi said: “When Qian meets Xun, observe the moon cave; when Earth meets thunder, see Heaven’s root.” These two lines are the great essentials of advancing fire and retreating talisman. What is Earth meeting thunder? In the Kun trigram is contained the Zhen trigram; beneath Zhen a yang returns—this is pure yin suddenly birthing yang, the yang birth at the hour of the living seed. Called Heaven’s root because in the chaotic world, dark and lightless, suddenly a stroke opens Heaven, yin and yang move and still alternately rise and fall, Heaven and Earth set, sun and moon run, all beings endlessly born—this is Heaven’s root. You must gather and refine when thunder moves underground, then you have a solid footing, a ladder to immortality and sagehood.  

When yang qi is at its peak, under the double yang suddenly a yin is born—this is Qian meeting Xun. Qian is pure yang; Xun is old yin. When you practice and yang rises fully, surging and filling head and eyes, unstoppable, you calmly still a moment, stop fire practice, unknowingly a yin arises. When upward-moving qi reaches this turning point, yin is born in Xun. When yin is born, truly living noon time, you practice retreating talisman, observing the elixir gate below the eyes, unlike advancing fire condensing spirit in the mud pellet, naturally following yin birth. This is called observing the moon cave.  

As for the Mao gate bathing, yang qi rises to the central position, yin within yang born half. The You bathing is yin qi descending to central position, yang within yin born half. If yang qi rises too much, yin qi must be deficient; if yin qi descends too much, yang qi must fall. Only advance fire without overdoing, and practice Mao bathing method in the middle, retreat talisman without overdoing, also practice You bathing method, naturally yin and yang harmonize, nature and life both complete. Every day when practicing, when yang qi is born, follow its rising; if somewhat strong, practice Mao bathing; when yin qi arises, practice descending work; if yin qi too strong, practice You bathing, settle and rest a moment, no fire, no talisman retreat, rest thus. When pure and natural, the Way is attained.  

If yin and yang alternate, both return to the central yellow palace, practice warming and nurturing. In sum, the key to the Way is to use true intention as master, called using true earth to capture true lead, using true lead to control true mercury, the three families united, two surnames mating—this is the Way. Yet using intention has two methods: one for movement, one for stillness. The alchemical books call the outer yellow woman the harmony of the two families, thus no position but moving. If you do not know to use movement to gather medicine, how can primordial qi be summoned back? This is the use of intention in movement. The inner yellow woman transmits the moment’s message, thus has position but is still. If you do not know to use stillness to refine elixir, how can primordial qi condense into embryo? This is the use of intention in stillness.  

Cultivators sometimes yang is born, then use movement to gather; sometimes yin descends, then use stillness to refine. True yang is the true embryo, yet also twofold: one is yang in Kan, gathered and returned to the elixir cauldron, cooked and refined to become the immortal who neither hungers nor thirsts; one is yang in void, refined in the furnace, swallowed and taken to become the saint true without form. You must first refine the yang in Kan with spirit fire, perfect the pure yang body, then set furnace and cauldron in Heaven and Earth, take the void one qi into the void furnace, feed and take, naturally becoming the supreme golden immortal. You must proceed step by step, not rushing or leaping.

I always say the mysterious gate’s one aperture is the origin of Heaven, Earth, and humans. Why? Because Heaven, Earth, and humans all begin as murky chaos, a lump of great void, with no sign to seek. This is all things born from void. When qi mechanism is touched, suddenly moved, leaping from emptiness, a knowing spirit arises—this is the true master of Heaven, Earth, and humans.  

I observe cultivators of the world: some know void as foundation, naturally and carelessly, often falling into stubborn emptiness, unable to become spiritual immortals; others know acting and making but do not seek primordial void qi, thus fragmented and deluded, creating a kind of demon magic, harming self and others. I now reveal these two types.  

If you want to become celestial immortals, you must first after deep dimness and utmost stillness seek the bit of great void before birth as the embryo of the elixir, so as not to fall into boundary. If occasionally seen, but not empty before and after, it is not your void mysterious true form and true origin heart body. If you can recognize this pure and unattached, empty and all-containing thing, and preside it with spiritual awareness, you can gradually build, condense, and form a great awakened golden immortal.  

Thus emptiness is the root, and using this emptiness to form the immortal who is unborn and undying, entering and exiting the void, infinitely changing, all depends on this one awareness. Yet when to seek this one awareness? You must be in deepest yin, vague and dim, without consciousness, suddenly having this awareness, no need to probe or arrange, opportunity touching, dim and awakening, then it is pure and clean, no knowledge or recognition, true awareness. If mixed with thought and knowledge, mingled with postnatal spirit, it is not true awareness,
