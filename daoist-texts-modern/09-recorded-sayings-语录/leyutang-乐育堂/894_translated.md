## Records of the Hall of Joyful Nurturing, Volume Three (Twenty-Six Sections)

### One  
Since ancient times, masters and venerable teachers have transmitted the dao, yet few have done so as singularly and directly as I do today—pointing straight to the heart without leaving a single thread of residue. Is it that the sages of old could not transmit thus? No, it is only that the times and circumstances differ. Up to now, human hearts have sunk deep into mire, the world’s path runs muddy and worn; the subtle essence of the great dao is scarcely preserved. The ruin of worldly teachings is as precarious as piled eggs, and those sunk in rote memorization of words and phrases are countless. Even those resolute in sacred learning, who embody it in body and action for three or five years, fail to taste true joy. Some have taught since childhood, grown old and bewildered, never grasping the essence or savoring the meaning. Though deeply habituated and long imprisoned by conditioning, the innate nature of later temperament and the cravings of the flesh are taken as natural. All this stems from the great corruption of education, which fails to reach the true boundary, thus leading to such results.  

Some say, “The Four Books and Five Classics have been explained, the myriad schools annotated, volumes upon volumes in recent times, surpassing former ages. How can it be said that teaching lacks method? Schools fill prefectural halls and county seats, lineages and traditions abound across the land, even more than in ancient times. How then can it be said there is no nourishment?” Alas! They do not understand the reason why. Even if one reads through five cartloads of books, it is of no use; even if one lectures in ten thousand halls, what benefit is there if one does not understand the origin of the teaching? Thus, the more words spoken, the more obscure the dao becomes; the more teachers abound, the more tangled the teachings grow. For those without the dao’s inheritance, their influence is but empty talk, vague theories, which not only fail to help but also harm. The common saying goes: “To know the three-forked road ahead, one must ask those who have passed through.” If one does not truly know, what benefit is there in many words? If one’s practice does not reach, even clear instruction is all mistaken. Therefore, in this declining age where the dao is faint, all rush after fame and profit; few know the virtue of benevolence and righteousness, which is our true place of joy.  

Alas! The dao’s failure to flourish is due to its obscurity; and because the dao is obscure, its practice fails to thrive. My master’s eyes have seen and heart grieved; he cannot bear the great dao to be wasted to such an extreme. Hence this transmission must be like an old magistrate deciding a case—relentless until the very end. May you fortunate ones meet this moment; your prior affinities and roots have long been tied. Nevertheless, if you do not hear my teachings or grasp my exhortations, even if your roots remain unbroken and your numinous nature persists, in three, five, or fifty years you will still not penetrate the original source and return to your innate nature and Heaven. If your功 (merit) is not accumulated, your德 (virtue) not gathered, then even if you discuss day and night for a lifetime, you will not suddenly understand the sign of realizing the dao and becoming true.  

Therefore, my master’s transmission prioritizes establishing功 and德; otherwise, demons and obstacles are hard to dispel, cultivation is obstructed, and the ignorant will mistake my dao for falsehood. At this mountain where my master sets teaching, only a few receive my true transmission—such is the rarity of talent! Mencius said, “To have the world’s outstanding talents and educate them is the triple joy.” I deeply trust these words. Among these few, each has roots and affinities, each values virtue and conduct, so their words easily enter. Without these few, my teaching would end as a painted cake—empty and unsatisfying. I myself am weary in body and spirit, having attained the true fire of samadhi, but I wait for功 to be full and行 (practice) complete, the furnace fire to reach pure azure, then I can leap out of the mire and directly transcend to the far shore. I add fierce roasting and urgent refining; surely the elixir will form with shape, and the joy will be endless. Looking back on sounds, colors, wealth, and love’s homeland, all are nets of sin and entanglements of passion, utterly unworthy of my heart’s attachment—this is the true proof of attaining the dao.  

As for the great elixir without form, the great dao without image, whether present or absent, man cannot see it, nor can even oneself know it. Only those worldly honors and household affections, those daily attachments one most clings to—if one gains from these, values these, naturally one will be light toward the other; delights in these, naturally one will hate the other; without intending to sever, yet naturally indifferent—this is the true, flowing, radiant proof of having attained the great dao.  

Now I admonish and warn: to seek transcendence from the red dust, to be born upon the far shore, to attain the true joy of Confucius and Yan Hui, to be a perfect person of Heaven and Earth, one must first practice giving, widely perform阴骘 (secret virtues), ascend to the highest heavens, then all grudges and burdens will be fully dissolved, leaving no obstruction. Therefore it is said: “If the mundane desire heavenly treasures, one must at the right time give up worldly wealth.” Also: “If ordinary people knew how to obtain, heavenly immortals would be as common as flowing water.” How profound! Though the dao is great, impartial, and selfless, it does not permit the unworthy to enter. Is this Heaven’s partiality? If not so, how could good and evil be clearly distinguished, how could retribution be manifest? I have seen this far but not yet reached full mastery. When fully ripe, the joy is beyond words. Then one understands why the ancients sacrificed body to become benevolent, gave up life to take righteousness—what men fear as a dreadful path, they regarded as a realm of joy. How much more so the lesser and outward things! Practitioners must reach this place to be able to lightly regard the red dust. Ask your own heart: is it so? Or not?  

### Two  
The essence of Heaven and Earth holds no other subtle meaning than a total emptiness. If one can grasp and settle in that emptiness, stand firm and steady, naturally day by day one grows full and bright, learning gathers brilliance. Is this not to possess all six supernatural powers? Yet speaking of its substance, it is originally emptiness. Because of birth, qi binds and matter obscures, like an empty house originally vast and bright, but covered in dust and filth, the brightness no longer shines. Speaking of its function, it is also supremely numinous; only because of habitual stains and dust, like gold sunk in mud and sand, its brightness is dimmed. Therefore my dao teaches nothing beyond the two words: emptiness and fullness. Like gold beneath water, with a vigorous misty aura—this is fullness. Rising and falling, listening naturally, acting without intention—this is fullness yet also emptiness. Or like the numinous yang one qi, originally without sound or smell—this is emptiness. Yet when they mutually summon and return to the furnace cauldron, refining into the embryo infant, this is emptiness yet also fullness. Such fullness within emptiness, emptiness within fullness, is the root of becoming immortal and realizing sagehood.  

Alas, today’s people know how to cultivate emptiness and stillness but cling only to one side—emptiness and stillness; or only to the other—fullness and solidity. This is superficial emptiness, not true emptiness; dead fullness, not real fullness. Why? The dao has no fixed form or place. It must be without place and without fixedness, yet appear as if with form and place to act; only then does it embody the subtlety of both emptiness and fullness. Those who cling to non-attachment as attachment, though differing in where they fall, all share this one sickness—not the subtlety of the great dao. You should take my master’s demonstration today as foundation, so that your sitting grows ever more wondrous, your time ever more harmonious, unlike before when sitting briefly brought fatigue to spirit and qi.  

If you feel slack or weary, do not seek elsewhere. Simply ask yourself: is the heart empty or not? Is the qi full or not? If too empty, empty without attachment, the spirit will surely fly away, wandering thoughts and distractions arise for lack of a resting place. Or if too full, full without emptiness, like carrying a heavy burden on shoulders and back, holding with hands while walking, day and night without rest—how can one avoid exhaustion, boredom, and weariness? One must know: empty but without intention toward emptiness; full but as if forgetting fullness. Acting thus, as Mencius said: “Like Yu’s journey through water, going where there is no trouble.” Because without intention toward affairs, naturally no trouble arises in the heart; then spirit is not disturbed, qi not encumbered, merging as one, spirit harmonious, qi flowing freely, heart open and spirit joyful. Practiced long, none fail to grasp its meaning or endure sitting. All depends on your heart’s understanding and spirit’s comprehension; do not allow a single thought to disturb your numinous palace or confuse your heart-nature—then you have it.  

Recently you have attained the true samadhi, but because your fire for gathering herbs is too focused on fullness, you see no delight, so sitting long brings boredom. Because the dao does not accord with emptiness and non-being, it is unlike my original nature and things; no wonder qi and blood do not flow, sitting long brings bodily pain, making it hard to complete a full cycle. The way of refining the elixir requires first solid footing, starting with guarding the center, then drawing forth the original colors and forms. Without solid footing, how can one soar in the void? Therefore Sanfeng said: “Condense spirit and regulate breath in the lower elixir field. When the mind stops below the navel, it is called condensing spirit; when the breath returns to the primal sea, it is called regulating breath; guarding its pure and natural state is called not forgetting; following its pure and natural state is called not assisting.” Practiced long thus, spirit and breath flow smoothly without any human effort; naturally spirit neither arises nor ceases, breath neither enters nor leaves; all is calm and free. At this time, one lets go again and again, allowing the spiritless spirit and breathless breath to move as they will, listening to their coming and going—as if I and spirit-qi are harmoniously one, or as if I and spirit-breath are unrelated. This is to let go again and again, then yang arises with form. When yang arises, I gather it back into the furnace, reverse and invert its use, returning to creation, to form the supreme golden immortal. Therefore, those who exert force are not of the dao; those who do not exert force cannot accomplish it. One must exert force first, then follow naturally. This is the meaning of “do all human work and listen to Heaven’s command.” Your recent功 (practice) must exert force where needed, then know when not to exert force, simply listen to the natural flow—this is the great error, understand? Yesterday I heard someone say that during the meeting of spirit stillness and breath regulation, the heart and spirit stirred and refused to submit. This is not spirit moving, but qi mechanism not yet arrived, inevitably causing conflict in the heart. There is no other method than to sit as the master, one spirit alone illuminating, controlling others, forbidding them to run wild, harmonizing them, not allowing unrest. Long so, qi quiets, spirit naturally calms—how can there be trouble of heart and spirit entering and leaving?  

Also, what does it mean that the heavenly heart is master, the primal spirit is function? The heavenly heart is the silent unmoving center with a main brain; the primal spirit is the responsive connection afterward, unaware of its origin. All this is natural and spontaneous; one spirit shines brightly, all phenomena are empty. Though one uses the myriad affairs daily, the heavenly heart and primal spirit are not diminished thereby. If you can recognize this message, then you know how to refine my emptiness and non-being yang, the foundation of my becoming immortal and sage. Alas, few cultivators truly recognize the heavenly heart and primal spirit. Know that they are always present; only by laying down all attachments does my mastership remain at ease. Even on days full of selfish desire, my mastership remains at ease, only occasionally obscured by worldly cravings. Beginners have not yet attained spirit clarity and fresh qi; though they have heavenly heart and primal spirit, they have not fully penetrated. I now show you: only in silent stillness is there a master, forbidding external things to disturb, this is refining my heavenly heart. When responsive and connected, there must also be a master, forbidding my numinous yang from being led away by things—this is refining my primal spirit. How can one not accumulate day by day and month by month to become a supreme immortal?  

In short, beginners must be like bloody warriors, each strike leaving a mark, each blow drawing blood, using full strength, then there is gain. Otherwise, dawdling and playing, one day’s exposure and ten days’ cold, no one succeeds. My master’s words today are all close to功 (practice). But you must endure hardship patiently, be fierce and diligent, then clear again and again, still and still again, until unaware, lost in obscurity, true yang arises, and one is like a fool or drunkard. Stored long, a true person appears. Not like side-door petty arts that merely solidify essence to form illusory spirits!  

### Three  
On the birth of yang, there are differences. There is external moving yang birth, as shown before. Internal moving yang birth has not yet been spoken of intimately. Internal moving yang birth arises naturally from long quietude and stillness. Sometimes it arises suddenly upon entering meditation—this is the spirit entering the qi, harmonizing as one. I further store this: the innate numinous fire inside, letting it rest and move, move and rest, swirling in the elixir cauldron; then using external talisman fire, listening to its up and down, coming and going, moving and stopping—this is the “circling twelve sections, each section must be personally attended.” When the internal fire grows strong, the external fire naturally cycles within the body, vast and boundless without end—this is the sign of qi circulating beyond spirit. At this time, I only sit as master, fixing the center palace, making sure no internal or external thoughts arise or enter. You have recently reached this point, but my master sees it is not yet fully according to method. When withdrawing the talisman, one only thinks no thoughts, no worries, as if arriving at a fine scene, unaware of leaving. Because one has not yet fully refined, it is helpful to count the breaths of the microcosmic orbit to recall it. Long so, until reaching the transformation stage, no need to move or shift; my body is vigorous, the upper part steaming qi, the lower part the essence of Kan water, circulating throughout, endless in coming and going. This breath is not intentionally regulated but self-regulating; essence is not intentionally refined but self-refining—called the “true flute of the empty vessel,” also called “long blowing of a flute without holes, occasional beating of a harp without strings.” This is not my invention. Lü Xian said: “Nurture two kinds, internal numinous fire and external talisman fire. Preserve ten months, abandon the active and attain the passive.” Though called passive, know that within passivity there is a true master controlling, so it does not fall empty. Also one must turn the light back, counting breaths as if countless, to guard true yang and nurture the embryo infant. Liu Zhenren said: “One breath goes, one breath comes, breath by breath mutually dependent, never wandering.” From this we see the internal numinous fire must be at ease, balanced and centered; the external talisman fire is the nurturing fire. Only with great care and full illumination, listening to each breath returning to root, each breath entering stillness, transforming into natural divine talisman without one bit of human effort—this is success.  

I observe that when you first lie down, you know to count breaths to gather this primal qi; but after returning, many rush to lie down, so the primal qi naturally disperses. Some, upon nearing the fine scene, are not yet steady and suddenly become restless, unable to endure long; so before lying down the primal qi is already scattered. This功 (practice) requires stillness and more stillness, patience and more patience. Sit until heavenly flowers fall, blood and qi naturally leap, my body like the great void, as if without form, yet wrapped in qi as a silkworm spinning its cocoon. I have but one bright spirit illuminating the center, forgetting inside and outside, where and what, existence and nonexistence—this is true meaning. You have long sincerity and deep rootedness; thus I transmit this nurturing fire and talisman fire together. From today, before sitting, arrange all clearly. If urgent matters arise, truly important, you may lie down accordingly. If not urgent, no need to notify. Whether effective or not, always use a bit of divine light to illuminate and guide. In walking, sitting, lying, all is thus. Seeing, hearing, speaking, moving, all likewise. Even when things come in confusion, hardships pile up, all follow the calm middle way. Only fear that the human heart does not die, the dao heart is hard born, and again drifting and vague, today so, tomorrow so, thus all year and all seasons with no progress. If you follow my words, I have yet to see one who does not succeed.  

### Four  
The profound gateway is a single orifice, the true yang is born at the hour of the child. Lüzu said: “All things have no smell; underground one hears thunder.” Ancient immortals said: “Suddenly at midnight a thunderclap, ten thousand households and a thousand gates open in order.” Thunder! Thunder! How divine, how marvelous! From these two sayings, is the opening of the profound orifice and the movement of true yang in the physical body without real proof, merely metaphorically thunder? Zhangzu said: “Thunder rumbles faintly shaking the void, lightning flashes to seek the true seed.” Ancient immortal masters all likened it to thunder—why so? I now point out directly: when you enter meditation, suddenly spirit and qi meet, reaching the true void place, you fall asleep unaware, breathing snorts, suddenly startled awake. This is the root of Heaven and Earth, the ancestor of man and beast. My body’s incarnation and possession, its coming, is this sudden obscurity and sudden awakening thought. If you truly awaken upon entering meditation, this is your original true face. Hurry to protect it with true intention; do not let it slip. Like a man riding a thousand-li steed, leaving dust behind, if he recognizes it in a glance, he must not delay; delay and it is lost. Hence: “Before is not, after is not. The revealed place is but one breath; after one breath it is no longer seen.” You must, when sitting quietly, if nose breath snorts, quickly rise and gather this clear empty qi for the future. Each such sitting will surely bring great gain. If you do not grasp the moment or miss the measure, no need for a hundred days before the foundation can be built. Such secrets, the ancients only spoke of the profound gateway, never as my master points it out inside the body. Know then, the elixir formula concerns功德 (merit and virtue) and heart-nature, not easy to speak. Zigong said: “The Master’s words on nature and the heavenly dao cannot be heard.” From now on, your first priority is to kill all worldly thoughts; “only after death of thought can faith arise.” I also hear you say, the Bright Monk said: “Practice at the time of breath falling.” Well said! At that time ears hear nothing, eyes see nothing, all attachments laid down, not a speck of dust, from here one leaps out—what else but the great dao? Therefore: “From ignorance and unconsciousness, seek the place of knowledge and awareness.” These words are truly not false. If you cannot stop breath and kill heart in daily life, how can your living breath open wide and fill the world? When old, breath is exhausted, spirit withers; if you do not cultivate this wondrous awareness, how can the four elements be firm and last long? Yet only knowing this orifice as master is not enough; circulating through the body, advancing fire, retreating talisman, harmonizing blood and qi—how can you last long and not perish? The ancients said: “Old people’s qi and blood are dried up; bamboo unstruck cannot sound; harp un-tuned cannot long sing.” Thus striking bamboo means stillness and motion, responsive connection; calling the turtle means lowering rites to people, surely gaining something. The harp metaphor means when true yang arrives, it stirs and dispels its shadowy gloom, harmonizing qi and blood. You must advance from this hundred-foot pole, then the dao is not far.  

### Five  
Ancients said: “The sage transmits fire but not medicine; transmits medicine but not fire.” The talk of fire and timing is nothing but the end of internal and external breath. Yet to call breath fire is not quite right. Breath is wind; fire is spirit. Using wind to fan fire to make medicine means using breath to move spirit to make elixir. Hence the saying: “Without fire, medicine does not transform; without wind, fire does not melt.” Here we see the fire and medicine. Also said: “Medicine is fire; fire is medicine.” The name fire-medicine has no fixed definition. When spirit and qi unite, Kan and Li meet, the great medicine is born amid mist and vapor—this is medicine, yet fire is within the medicine. When Heaven and Earth unite, dragon and tiger, metal and wood blend as one, gathering the Yellow Court, silent and odorless, holding one true intention—this is warming and nurturing by fire. Thus refining is called fire; within fire there is medicine. Yet it is only movement and stillness. Movement with form is medicine; stillness without form is fire. This is nameless yet named, formless yet formed. You must know fire and medicine are the primordial one true qi, as the Zhongyong says: “Heaven’s mandate is called nature.” Nature is here,命 (life) is here, the great dao is nowhere not here. Cultivators must heart-to-heart imprint to have gain.  

I also say: what are external medicine and internal medicine? Internal medicine has form; external medicine can be gathered. Internal medicine is the body’s primal qi; external medicine is the primal qi of the great void. This neither increases nor decreases, present everywhere freely. But without internal illumination and nurturing功, one cannot summon external medicine. Hence the Daji Jing says: “The Buddha attains perfect awakening among the heavens of desire and form.” This means the primal spirit quietly illuminates the middle and lower elixir fields; internal primal yang shines forth; external primal qi vigorously envelops the whole body, unaware of Heaven, Earth, man, or self. This is nearly the unity of inside and outside, stealing Heaven and Earth’s numinous yang to return to my form. Long so, refining form to transform qi—so-called “immortals have no other method, only this qi filling inside and outside.” Knowing the true medicine, you still need true fire to roast it: “Using spirit to govern qi, qi returns to spirit, no other method needed for longevity.” If separated, spirit does not guard the abode; fire and medicine lose their match and collapse. The primal spirit gathers the primal qi like husband and wife, child and mother—inseparable, else medicine does not form, elixir does not complete. The primal spirit is empty; primal qi is empty; empty meets empty, empty meets dao; form and spirit both subtle, united with dao and true. Only fear the human heart does not die, the dao heart not born; breath never stops, embryo breath unmoving; then cannot be one with Heaven, cannot gather Heaven and Earth’s numinous qi. As for the talk of fire and timing, there is more to say. Fire is spirit; timing is breath. One must use primal spirit to move primal breath, continuous and unbroken, firmly rooted and deeply grounded. In short, this fire and timing must be natural numinous breath, like a newborn in the mother’s womb, breathing with the mother, having no master of its own. Then fire and true medicine are true; elixir never fails. Think on this, the great dao is not hard to seek.  

### Six  
Ancients said: “Fish leap, kites fly; nowhere is not a realm of transformation. Water flows, flowers bloom; at all times one sees Heaven’s mechanism.” If one can sweep clean one’s own heart, though the seasons change with wind, cloud, sun, and rain, the scene within is ever vibrant with life. What sorrow or joy can there be? Only pity that people do not know the beautiful scene before them, but remain ignorant, full of selfish desire, clinging to body and family, clothes and food, unaware of Heaven and man’s disharmony. You should know this spring day is near, after long rain a clear sky—will there not be a new atmosphere? Know this atmosphere is the ceaseless vitality, the state of one yang returning. Realize this, and know human yang birth is just so, neither more nor less. But at the start, you must first sweep away all杂念 (confused thoughts) and杂尘 (dust), so there is a state of混沌 (primordial chaos), called无为 (non-action). Suddenly spirit and qi intertwine, the “profound gateway fire ignites, deep and obscure, rushing awake,” from non-action arises true message, and medicine can be gathered. I see most of you, when lying down, do not enter the混沌境 (primordial chaos realm) to seek yang qi birth, so you gather and refine emptily, seeing no growth. Hence: “Gather medicine from nothingness, in the midst of confusion, yang qi is born.” When yang qi first arises, it is the少阳 (lesser yang) qi of my body, which must be paired with少阴 (lesser yin) fire. At this time, gathering must be light and gentle, so the medicine does not flee, understand? From this one breath in and out, one coming and going, long brewing. This brewing time is the混沌 (primordial chaos) time. All things born in the world need阴 (yin) to shade and雨 (rain) to moisten, else buds cannot sprout or leaves unfold; how much more the way of elixir? Hence after one yang comes, one must pair with one yin. When阴荫 (yin shade) is long, true yang naturally rises straight up. I then use its movement to lift and condense in the泥丸 (mud pellet), at a moment of混沌 (primordial chaos), making spirit and qi merge into one numinous liquid. When the numinous liquid descends to the central yellow proper place, I naturally warm and nurture it, waiting for qi mechanism to move again, then proceed with method and功 (practice). When you reach this, true spirit and breath appear, and mouth and nose breath have no movement—this is the time the great medicine will be born. Hence: “Form the elixir in nothingness.” Within the obscure, the numinous elixir is formed. Once the elixir is formed, nurture the embryo in nothingness, warm and fluid, naturally the embryo infant grows. If not nurturing primal qi to primal spirit, how can primal spirit be strong and full? Without strength, all worries and adversities stir it, because spirit is weak and timid. Mencius nurtured浩然 (vast and mighty) qi, great and strong, filling Heaven and Earth—what can disturb it? Otherwise, sages are still human; why do they meet hardship calmly, face great trials with ease? Are they different from men? Only because they transform primal qi into primal spirit, at that time qi is spirit, spirit is qi, mixed without separation, so they can be so.  

The problem is cultivators seek speed, adding impatience and harsh qi; and though yang is born, they do not know it is a clear and pure single thing. Instead they add a heart, add intention, mixing in later heaven, so even if sent to the furnace and sealed, warmed and nurtured, the embryo will not form. Ancients said: “Old medicine cannot form elixir,” meaning mixed with later heaven’s阴识 (yin consciousness); “Tender medicine is worthless,” meaning yang qi has not yet shown vigorous rising and misty vapor. Hastily gathering like this scatters primal spirit. You must be cautious in this功 (practice), so as not to labor in vain.  

### Seven  
The agreeable places among Heaven and Earth’s scenery do not truly lie in the scenery, but in whether the human heart gains or does not gain. Thus the same beautiful scene, a君子 (gentleman) sees joy, a小人 (small person) sees sorrow. Because the君子’s heart is empty and numinous, always harmonizing with Heaven and Earth, so the view enhances gain. The小人’s heart is selfish and dark, always opposing creation, so the scene brings sadness. It all depends on the heart’s own grasp! You who study the dao, can you also have spontaneous joy anytime and anywhere? If you can be untroubled by sun, rain, darkness, or brightness, then you can face wealth, poverty, honor, disgrace, suffering, and difficulty without being trapped. Though small matters, from small one can observe the great. Your first priority is to have ability, so you are not troubled by the rugged path of the world. The ancient sages, imprisoned in Youli, wrote the Zhou Yi; exiled in Chen and Cai, played strings and sang—this is because their hearts were vast, they had joy within, so nowhere was not joyful. You in this realm must not say the sages could but I cannot. I have practiced long; qi mechanism flows smoothly, but no firm foundation is built, because at the start I did not see my original true face, so I gathered and refined mistakenly, mixing in dregs, so I could not ascend directly to Bodhi and open great blessings. I think of you who have sincere dao hearts; now I reveal this to you. Otherwise, you grow old, wander the wrong path, and it will be hard to return to the root and restore the origin.  

Generally, in sitting meditation, one must first lay down all attachments, not a single thread remaining; this body too is placed in the land of non-being, and I do not perceive form. Such a single thought held is a single return to truth. When one reaches confusion and sinking, no self or other, no place or Heaven, this is nature. Nature is benevolence. If I am aware, this is true seeing of nature. From this true nature arises primal spirit, the true heart. To clarify heart and see nature, what difficulty is there? Refining into elixir, the elixir is the primordial original nature, but must be ruled by true intention before it is mine. True intention is true heart. Having this true nature is having root; gaining this true heart is having use. Otherwise blind cultivation and reckless refining, even if later successful, is not worthy of the immortal’s respect. After seeing nature, one spirit shines brightly, all phenomena empty; then my body’s vigorous misty primal qi circulates inside and out, moving up and down—this is using primal spirit to refine great medicine. Thus gathering and roasting is not later heaven’s spirit and qi, nor vain toil. Generally, seeing true nature once and moving true qi once, with serious cultivation for one year or half a year, the elixir foundation can be firm, becoming a long-living immortal. The start must be serious about the words nature and life. What is immortal, what is mundane? Then one can gather primordial qi, roast once, and form the primordial great dao. If mixed with later heaven, like planting good seedlings among weeds, how can good fruit come?  

Yet nature is so easy to see, why are so few those who become dao? Because seeing nature is momentary, refining nature is lifelong. Only by taking primordial original nature as root, holding it constantly, naturally day by day will there be signs of gathering brilliance. At first seeing nature is but a waking in chaos, not yet fully clear in all directions. One must nurture it long; my body’s primal qi and the great void’s primal qi become seamless, then there is this realm. Also said: “The human body is wholly one qi with Heaven and Earth; except for self’s selfishness, all is Heaven.” How far is Heaven? To reach this place, the heart must be empty of things, nature empty like water, forgetting things, people, and self, then there is the great harmonious one qi. Cultivators wishing to be one with the great void must not let internal thoughts arise nor external thoughts enter; breath in and out becomes light, feeling only a single point of numinous light. Called “the primordial appearing as a precious pearl in the void,” also “a bright pearl never leaving,” also “refined into a single Muni pearl”—though named differently, the essence is a single spirit manifesting, always responding, always still. If one does not gather the primordial point of gold in water, slowly roasting spirit fire, forcing it to rise and fall, gathering into the five wisdom palaces, how can such a pearl form? This is seeing nature to its utmost, when primordial original nature becomes the dharma body. My master today truly points out the beginning and end, form and image of primordial nature. You who understand this need not cling to my words, nor depart from my teaching; each must recognize it in body and mind, then truly gain.  

### Eight  
Life in the world spans many years; if one does not hasten to cultivate and return to the innate Heaven, once entering the dark path, one does not know which path one falls into—becoming ghost, demon, bird, or beast. How pitiful! Carefully consider: is it not better to cultivate virtue and clarify the dao? Though cultivation is indeed a beautiful matter, the red dust rolls endlessly, losing original nature and Heaven, without true teachers’ guidance, how can one know the right path and not lose the way? Hence many study the dao for years, yet gain nothing; some toil a lifetime, yet fall into side doors; others self-cultivate and self-verify without teacher transmission, blindly refining and harming nature and life. Some even visit teachers and friends, sparing no expense, self-satisfied, yet ultimately deceived. Now you are fortunate to enter the gate without falling into heterodox or evil teachings—this is a great blessing. To meet but not refine, to refine but not be diligent, is to waste good past affinities; later it will be hard to meet again. I have practiced many years; the turning of the heavenly cart is no longer a matter of day or night. Why have I not seen foundation formed? Because at the start I did not get true pure medicine, so mixed desires and delusions accumulated day by day, like bricks mixed with dregs, laboring without result. Now I show you: day and night practice requires fixing a time, extinguishing the spirit of knowledge, erasing thought and intention; sit like a mountain, heart calm as water. Such clarity brings body and mind peace, qi and breath harmony. Then close eyes slightly, fix heart and spirit, regulate breath, let it be natural, one out and one in, one open and one close, breathing out not coarse, breathing in not restless, long so with no in or out, calm and free, dwelling in the center palace—this is stopping the mundane breath. When mundane breath stops, embryo breath appears. Slowly nurture, naturally true qi surges, reaching the heart palace; this is opening orifices. Because true qi is strong, it surges up to the crimson palace; nearly all body毛窍 (hair orifices) open naturally. Called “one orifice communicating, all orifices bright,” also “one root returned to origin, six roots liberated.” When you reach this功 (practice), you can start from the虚危穴 (empty precarious cavity), proceed backward to the尾闾 (tailbone), then ascend to泥丸 (mud pellet) palace. If only qi mechanism slightly moves, or only surges to the heart palace without seven orifices opening, nor毛眼 (hair eyes) all open, this is not true orifice opening time—do not rush the heavenly cart. Without water to move fire, the body will burn. You must have this scene to get internal truth and external response, external sensation and internal numinosity, your body’s qi united with the great void’s primal qi—this is true medicine, also called stealing Heaven and Earth’s qi to form elixir. If true medicine arises and circulates inside and outside, years of stagnant阴气 (yin qi) transform into sweat, expelled through毛眼 (hair eyes), all filth and impurities melt and vanish, your body and qi gradually approach sagehood. I further show you: after long功 (practice), the path is familiar; if you cannot let go for a moment, you may gather your primal spirit into the profound orifice, seeming like a fool with no awareness; actually the heart is dead but spirit not dead. This is the ancients’ foundation built. But because of mixing sand with clay, starting with dregs, later even jade liquid elixir cannot be firm and lasting. So one discards all previous功, returning solely to the vast Heaven, to eliminate dregs and selfishness. This is also a method; you decide.  

I see cultivators today who only know to refine essence, some only to伏气 (conceal breath), some only to refine spirit. Each has some merit, but to preserve flesh and blood body and release阴识 (yin consciousness) spirit is not the great dao. Some say虚无大道 (void and non-being great dao), lay down all attachments, not a speck of dust, yet do not know laying down still means picking up, not stained still means greatly stained. Not only non-action teachings but even my门弟子 (lineage disciples) sit in this fault. Only you see this, so my master gladly imparts secrets. Generally, cultivation must nurture the虚灵元神 (empty numinous primal spirit) to nourish the虚无元气 (empty non-being primal qi). This primal qi is neither essence, nor qi, nor spirit, yet is essence, qi, and spirit united. To cultivate the great elixir and form the golden body, one must have this true empty primal qi. Yet knowing this is hard, let alone holding it. In short, refining the great elixir is not accidental; without innate root and vessel, one cannot meet it. Now do not be self-satisfied; accumulate阴功 (secret功) more. Where is阴功? Only in widely opening my great dao to those with affinity and virtue—this is great功 indeed.  

### Nine  
Now I see many quietly nurturing, with heavenly heart returning, yet no success—why? Because though the origin is clear, nurturing has not lasted long, so reason and desire alternate, unable to reach clear and free境 (realm). Now I tell you: after洞见 (penetrating insight) into origin, constantly awaken and rouse yourself, like monk Ruiyan who calls out: “Master, are you awake?” and replies: “Awake.” Such organizing energy and exerting effort, how can one not be like one day throughout a lifetime? Recently I do not blame wall-facing nurturing to dispel sleep demon suffering; when hungry eat, when tired nap, but always awaken quickly, sleeping deeply is forbidden. Such every movement, always mindful, one stillness and silence, holding without loss, then dao fruit matures. I once said: “Yan Zi gained one good, then held it firmly—what spirit is this?” Gaining one good means penetrating the original person. Holding firmly means after penetrating origin, always awaken and rouse, not allowing any drowsiness to let the original person be lost. You have insight here, always without gap, moment by moment not breaking, naturally heart and principle merge, principle and heart harmonize, like mother and child clinging and unwilling to part. The Book says: “Mindfulness here, release here,” this is the sign of medicine ripening and elixir forming, then there is this scene. Duke Zhou sat waiting for dawn, night after night—was this not the meaning? Yet at the start, especially recognize true pure medicine. Essence is not exchanged essence, but a cluster of numinous water in the Flower Pool. The Great Cavern Scripture says: “Flower Pool’s numinous water melts, spring gushes to moisten, circulating endlessly.” Where does it arise? When does it move? Not random. When beginners sit, dispel illusions, gather spirit, sit lightly and gently a while, suddenly spirit enters deep obscure place, suddenly awaken—then I observe阴跷 (yin heel) one meridian moving or not. If moving, I gather back in emptiness; if no movement, also gather back in emptiness—this is essence birth. I see your qi mechanisms differ; some move, some do not; all must first be clear and bright, profound gateway fire ignites, deep and obscure rushing awake; no movement also means essence birth. Essence birth is yang birth, the true foundation. Qi is not breath qi, but mundane breath stops, true breath moves, filling the whole body inside and out, with firm, upright, pure essence form, governing before and after heaven’s breath, circulating yin and yang inside and out. This can be known but not described. But when exactly does it move? Where does it flow? When Kan and Li meet, mundane breath stops; this qi then connects with Heaven and Earth—this is the sign of qi birth. From the bubbling spring upward, from fingertips rising, gradually circulating the whole body, like Heaven and Earth’s qi mechanism never ceasing. If any place pauses, it is dead matter, disease mechanism, not lively and smooth. Spirit is not thinking spirit, but arising from chaos after no knowledge or awareness, suddenly having awareness—this is true spirit. I govern it, forbidding wandering thoughts and fantasies, only one heart without two hearts, only one thought without two thoughts; this is primal spirit acting, conscious spirit listening. In short, spirit and qi are Heaven and Earth’s yin and yang given to me. Qian is yang; yang gives me nature; nature dwells in heart and manifests as spirit; spirit illuminates all and knows all. Kun is yin; yin gives me命 (life); life dwells in body and manifests as qi; qi moves always and fills everywhere. This nature and life origin is also where spirit and qi stand. Yet still not my true skill in refining elixir and true master of cultivation. Because this nature-life-spirit-qi is but the profound gateway’s first movement, the opening of the great ultimate, divided into yin and yang, alternating soft and hard; in the human body it is nature and life, spirit and qi—still one and two. To have true elixir foundation, before the great ultimate moves, there is a vast misty段 (section) of great harmony qi, neither nature nor life, yet both nature and life, beyond words and thought. You have now penetrated the source; I will not waste words further.  

### Ten  
My master’s elixir returns to golden liquid, escaping the suffering of reincarnation; you are still halfway, hurry to cultivate, directly realize supreme bodhi, so that dharma forms remain, never driven by ghosts and gods, never falling into the Three Realms and Six Paths. Otherwise, difficult indeed. Not to say you later disciples have not yet reached great return; even since Tang and Song dynasties many immortals have only returned to jade liquid, not completed golden elixir; when fortune runs out, karma arrives. It seems those who do not realize golden immortality are still like ordinary people, only with less evil karma, not entering the ox intestine horse belly to suffer all pains. You should seize this grand assembly, the teaching feast widely opened; the high transcendents of Heaven do not punish small faults nor bind by rank—only those with aspiration to enter the dao, none are denied their wish. Only pity to meet but not refine, then must suffer torment. You should exert all strength to uphold the dao, not imagine being the second person of ancient and modern; set such great aspiration, even immortals and sages gladly assist without weariness. Before the assembly opened, seekers of dao had to travel thousands of miles, laboring heart and body, hardly able to meet the highest truth and be liberated. Now you need not leave your gate, need not labor heart or body, yet receive my master’s profound transmission—how fortunate, how joyful! Compared to when I first received master’s secret, it was far easier; if you do not cultivate thus, I fear the immortal affinity will scatter and be hard to meet again. You must strive. Today I again point out cultivation essentials.  

The dao is the great ultimate. The heart is like yin and yang. Spirit, essence, soul, and intention are like the Five Phases. This dao hangs in the void, not yet fallen into the human body; the principle of limitless great ultimate, the essence of yin-yang and five phases, all confused and vast, gathering as one. What five phases? What yin and yang? What great ultimate? All is empty, one true void. When one sense moves, one touch arises, then wondrous, marvelous, numinous, and divine, creating myriad things endlessly, infinitely changing. When it falls into the human body, it becomes flesh and blood, qi and temperament change, desires stain; the five phases are not true, yin and yang not original, so the great ultimate is hidden and unseen. Cultivation is nothing other than teaching people to remove the stains of what was never there, to return to the innate good. At the start, first recognize your own great ultimate; the great ultimate is the original person. Fix this with your one bit of wisdom’s light; this is what Bodhidharma called “pure knowledge, wondrous completeness, the body itself empty and silent.” When in ignorance and unconsciousness, suddenly there is awareness—this is pure knowledge, wondrous completeness, the original person. Hence: “This one awakening is nothing else, only empty awakening of emptiness.” In primordial chaos, there is this awakening; hurry to gather true thought, use true intention. Though intention rules action, it is only one heart without two, still the original intention, not far from the dao. With this intermingling water and fire, combining metal and wood, slowly roasting, later heaven’s heart, liver, spleen, lung, kidney, and their stored spirit, soul, and intention all merge as one. All is primordial true yin and true yang, returning to the great uncarved block, back to the great beginning, still the original undivided primal qi. Then you are near the dao. The human body has important places: the mountain root and profound chest orifices, all essential for qi and essence flow. If one can hold the mountain root in mind, true qi naturally flows up and down, returning to the Yellow Court’s old place. If one can observe the profound chest, true fluids naturally gather and rise. Each time you practice, do not neglect these two orifices. The ancients said: “Profound chest qi tube receives essence talisman,” also “Profound chest one orifice is the shore of life and death,” also “Mountain root is the root of human life.” Opening the governor and conception vessels, allowing qi flow, is this orifice. If you can hold spirit here, you can live long, avoid illness, and extend years.  

### Eleven  
I see your heavenly cart path is open; now if you do not use the cart to circulate the body and irrigate the elixir field,精 (essence) will overflow and qi fill, causing danger of collapse. The Yi says: “At midday the sun declines; when the moon is full, it wanes.” Even Heaven and Earth are so; how much more man! The ancients transmitted the microcosmic orbit method, none better than the elixir scripture’s words: “Ask my son when? Only the time of medicine birth.” This medicine birth has no breath trace; suddenly Kan and Li meet, “In the crescent furnace the jade bud is born.” This is true medicine arising. I seek the primal original qi as leader, starting功 on the first year, first month, first day, first hour, a great auspicious time. Such medicine does not mix later heaven’s dregs. Be cautious of its timing, neither too old nor too young, so medicine is born but not lost, not turning to later heaven’s forms.  

What is the退阴符 (retreating yin talisman) at noon? Anciently said: “Ask me when is noon? Only the medicine morning at the golden palace.” How to know it greets the golden palace atop the mud pellet? At the time of advancing fire, gently use later heaven breath to urge primal qi up to Kunlun peak. Though no silver waves or golden crystals pouring, no hundred meridians trembling or nine palaces clear, yet medicine qi rises, whole body leaps, qi mechanism cycles without a hair or orifice missed, feeling like standing against a wall, mind like a clear deep pool. This is true yang flourishing, the time to start the yin talisman. Yang extreme gives birth to yin—this is its meaning. When you reach this功, you must retreat downward, not continue forcing. If you advance fire again, you will scatter primal qi outside, unable to gather into the five wisdom palaces as elixir root—this is empty motion, what use?  

Also said: “Ask me when is Mao? Red child fire cloud cave array. Without the Savior Guanyin, the great medicine surely bursts.” So Mao gate should bathe. Qi mechanism circulating fills the body; if not true primordial fire, all is later heaven相火 (phase fire). If intention is too heavy, breath too tight, like summer autumn sun, man cannot endure—thus the red child phase fire metaphor. At this time, retreat fire and stop talisman, one heart fully illuminating, no stray thoughts—enough. Hence: “Without the Savior Guanyin, the great medicine surely bursts.” Guanyin is metaphor for great compassion and mercy, always sprinkling sweet dew with willow branch to save human worries. At this time, one must use a merciful and gentle heart, free of vexing heat.  

Also said: “Ask me when is You? It is the union of conception and governor vessels. If yellow robe is absent, how can medicine be auspicious?” You bathing at You means breath retreats to the crimson palace. At this time, later governor vessel and earlier conception vessel meet, gathering in one place. How to know the crimson palace? Crimson palace is where spirit and qi gather, eager to fill, sweet fluids dripping, with sound along the way. At this time the three treasures meet in crimson palace, and the blazing fire seems burning. I only use a harmonious intention to protect and guard it, letting breath up and down follow naturally, then retreat yang fire and stop yin talisman. Pause a moment, then gather back to the斗府 (dipper mansion), warm and nurture—the great harmony primal qi is here. When you reach this功, gather medicine qi back to the furnace, awareness unceasing; long so, numinous light flashes, shining at the center of the vast northern sea, the boundary of Wu and Ji, like the long-hanging sun and moon—this is my primal spirit transformed into the mysterious pearl. Hence said: “Pearl beneath water,” also “Yellow bud within earth.” All are your original primal spirit transformed into true intention. When gathering here, true intention transforms back into primal spirit, returning to the primordial one qi of principle and qi, pure and flawless, utterly perfect. Each sitting you feel this primal spirit, calm and elegant; qi mechanism moves but you do not move, qi mechanism still but you are not still—this is the original person manifesting. Seeing this is seeing nature; knowing this is clarifying heart. Having this awakening is the foundation of great awakening golden immortality. You have fully understood this; it truly exists—be cautious, do not be arrogant.  

### Twelve  
Life in this world, except for cultivating dao, any enjoyment of endless glory and splendor is but empty words, hollow affairs. Only by attaining great awakening can one rejoice for millions of years. Compared to worldly fame and power, which is greater or lesser, who gains or loses, is like the difference between Heaven and abyss. Yet such is encountered once in a thousand years. You are fortunate to meet this good assembly; hurry to cultivate completion—is it not far beyond worldly wealth and honor? Some find it difficult, thinking this matter, though meeting good affinity and roots, is not gained in three or five years; some cultivate lifelong with no gain; some have labored many kalpas without success. Is it like worldly wealth and honor, which can be gained and lost at will? Do you not know that where there is will, work succeeds; Heaven does not disappoint the diligent; only fear is lack of will, lack of wholehearted effort. How can one cultivate dao and not have dao for oneself? Those who cannot quickly gain do so because they see but do not act, act but do not exert, dawdle and play, willingly abandon themselves. If you can exert one strength forward, like the hungry desiring food, thirsty seeking drink, focused and single-minded, gathering qi and spirit, how can you not succeed? Ancients said: “Hardship for two or three years, joy for thousands of years.” Such were the words of sages—are they lies to deceive? Confucius said: “I desire benevolence, then benevolence arrives.” Cultivating from what one has, not like power and fame controlled by Heaven, which one cannot manage. These words truly express the learner’s beginning; can you not strive? Now seeing your body and mind have gain, seize this to taste its flavor, add fierce roasting and urgent refining, with a heart of detachment and peace. Not waiting three or five years, even within one year, great effects will manifest. Though no grudges or enmities from past or present lives, still accumulate阴功 (secret功) to dissolve karmic debts, so one stroke completes, free from demon entanglement and calamity. When功 (practice) advances, it is best to perform rites to the Dipper, exorcise stars, invite all immortals and saints to witness and pledge, to dispel demons and break obstacles, so the path is straight and smooth. This has been the first task of true cultivators since ancient times. Do not seek quick results. Know that those who rush are not great vessels; those who hasten have no great功. Better to nurture spirit and qi, extremely firm and upright, purely essence; then return the seven-day heavenly mechanism; no fear of failure. Spirit nurtured purely, qi nurtured purely, then the jade liquid elixir is not useless; when nurtured fully pure, the golden liquid elixir is easier, no need nine or ten years of hardship, one can ascend to the Great Luo. Think on this—is it so? Alas, today’s cultivators only know守中 (guarding the center) is the heart method of sages through the ages: first guard the formed center, then guard the unformed center, then one can become immortal and sage. But know守中 to get medicine is only half the learning. Even if yang is born, it is孤阳 (solitary yang); without阴汞 (yin mercury) to match, one cannot form the immortal embryo. Because there is male but no female, no union to birth immortals. You must understand the method of gathering; if medicine does not rise, medicine ages and qi scatters, you must get a sprout of new medicine, gather it, use it to run the heavenly cart—this is not other method. Just observe from the thirtieth to the first and second, all are dark phases, no light—this is the sign of no medicine, medicine faint. When the third day arrives, the moon emerges at the Geng direction, a crescent appears in the sky, only a line of brightness—new tender medicine is likewise. Hence said: “Someone asked me about cultivating the profound, pointing remotely to the moon’s single streak.” This shows one yang’s movement, though slight, its potential is great; must carefully investigate. In short, medicine birth is not hard; you must have primal spirit to guide it. Know that true spirit manifests as true intention to rule, so from slight to manifest, not disturbed by later heaven’s knowledge spirit. This is the key. Why? Clear spirit means clear qi; turbid spirit means turbid qi—this is certain principle. As for抽添 (drawing and adding) method, draw阳 (yang) from Kan, add阴 (yin) from Li. Yang is lead, lead is qi; yin is mercury, mercury is liquid. Though qi rises as clouds, clouds descend as rain; rain transforms to qi to become clouds rising; clouds transform to rain to descend—qi produces liquid, liquid produces qi; liquid and qi generate each other, gathering together; with spirit fire roasting, it becomes the wondrous elixir. But at start, one yang first moves; ancients likened it to “earth thunder shaking mountain top rain,” teaching to be like sudden thunderclap, suddenly aware—this is profound gateway orifice opening. Hence: “Stillness with yang moving, metal and Li ore; underground thunder rumbles, fire presses metal.” This is the union of Heaven and man. What is Heaven and man union? From ignorance and unconsciousness, pure Heaven without man; suddenly awareness arises, pure man without leaving Heaven—thus said Heaven and man union. Such union is true yang, the mother of elixir. Have you explored this?  

### Thirteen  
You have practiced long, losing many worries, anxieties, illnesses, and itches. Even these small sufferings, think of them as the best among human immortals. How much more so cultivation leads to higher and higher, profound beyond profound, for eternal immortals enjoying leisure and blessing! Think on this: which is greater, which smaller? You should choose the greater and be a great person, not fall among small people. But this concerns heavenly命 (life); only those with affinity, virtue, blessing, and root can bear it. Therefore the elixir dao is not lightly transmitted; only those with immortal affinity and dao root can meet, know, and act. Otherwise, even if lucky to attend the assembly and hear orthodox teaching, demon entanglements and calamities are inevitable. Even those with virtue and root are tested by Heaven to see if their heart-nature is firm. As for external invasions, all are karma from past and present lives, to be repaid; no blame to Heaven or others. If my family is not guided, it is also karmic affinity; is this not命 (life)? “Accept the rightful fate,” Mencius’s words are worth pondering. If cultivation must be without磨 (grinding) to encourage oneself, the more磨 the stronger; even if unforeseen events come, accept them naturally and all is well.  

### Fourteen  
I show the heavenly cart method; there are still details not carefully explained. Heaven and man merge in darkness; one yang first moves, medicine first born has such form; body and mind quiet, focused qi soft, elixir first condenses, also such form—both must use softness, harmony, silence, and stillness. Why? Yang must be paired with yin; if using hardness and motion, it is male paired with male—how can there be transformation? Also, heart and spirit do not return to the uncarved block, pure and bright and clear; spirit scatters wandering outside, not mingling with qi—this is why heart’s use must be soft. The Supreme One said: “Blunt sharpness, resolve confusion, blend light with dust”—this can be silently understood. Yet at the birth of true yang, only gentle and slight gathering and lifting is proper. Ancients said: “Two parts new tender water, paired with two parts fire.” When it rises to the waist and spine, qi mechanism flourishes, with slight conflict; yet intention may be slightly tight. The heavenly cart’s path symbolizes Heaven and Earth’s year of creation. From winter solstice when all yin condenses and closes, one yang first moves and fires; think how is yang at this time? When three yang open and thrive, what is its form? When six yang arrive, great heat of summer, how then? From yang flourishing, suddenly yin arises, gradually autumn cools, until deep winter cold. Advancing and retreating to the furnace, all must observe Heaven’s dao and follow Heaven’s movement to accord with law. Otherwise, the heavenly cart method and elixir scriptures say great danger; not following Heaven’s dao brings mostly misfortune. Think on this and heavenly cart is not difficult. If true yang does not show great movement, one may quietly nurture long, without interruption through twelve hours; qi naturally fills and medicine is born, no need three or two months. The dao is one; one is emptiness. The Qingjing Jing says: “Look inward at the heart; the heart has no heart. Look outward at the body; the body has no body.” When sitting guarding the center, you must see your flesh and blood body and heart as empty and hollow, only condense spirit in the void, merge qi in the vast. Emptiness and vastness mean spirit and qi mixed as one, returning to primordial undifferentiated one qi—this is true medicine, this is the numinous elixir, no other medicine or elixir exists. Hence said: “One must externalize body yet body remains; empty the heart yet heart is present.” Cultivators only need to have heart free of attachment, confused and chaotic, naturally united with dao. This is gathering; also roasting. “Gathering without gathering is better than gathering; roasting without roasting is better than roasting.” If truly empty thus, all attachments release, whole self remains; body cleanses itself, heart becomes numinous. Because it is empty and has nothing, all things of Heaven and Earth are within my capacity. The way of Heaven and man’s union is only this emptiness. If you have not practiced heavenly cart, you may set it forth as emptiness, not attached to form nor emptiness—then you have it.  

### Fifteen  
My master often said about receiving qi at birth; you have not yet understood; now I explain in detail. Before birth, this qi mingled in the void, like the great void itself. From the moment a thought arises, unknowingly, this qi descends between father’s essence and mother’s blood. Yet at this time only essence and blood are one mass, no form or limbs; where am I? At this time one point of primal yang true qi fills essence and blood, gradually nurtured day by day, growing like a chicken egg shape. Then a cavity forms; my primal qi dwells within the cavity. Then two kidneys grow below, one heart above; heart and kidneys are about eight inches four fen apart, with primal qi rolling and flowing between. After long time, the governor vessel grows at back, conception vessel at front, and five senses and hundred joints gradually form. All primal qi lies within the cavity; only then is the body formed, with conscious spirit and numinous transformation. Later those who wish to refine golden elixir to become golden immortals, how can they be apart from this cavity? Hence said: “Heart must be in the cavity; thoughts must not arise, always guarding the gate.” My dao teaches people to illuminate the elixir field with heart light and eye light; this is the true orthodox way of all saints and sages returning to origin, restoring命 (life), and returning to root, drop by drop returning to origin. You already know the original person; now I show the place where the original person dwells. Nurtured long, in the elixir field one feels a cluster of misty, harmonious, lively mechanism inside—this is the original person manifesting. The Supreme One said: “Vague and dim, within is something.” That something is qi, qi is yang. “Deep and obscure, within is essence.” Essence is clarity and not dark, alert and not confused. Not ordinary essence, not pure essence; this is what is called “heart essence alone moving.” “Its essence is very true; within is faith.” Faith is not the side-door cloud yang birth and external kidney movement’s信音 (faith sound). It means this essence is pure essence of essence; my heart must have a segment of utmost sincerity and no delusion, firmly believing life and death are small matters, nature and命 (life) are great; whatever myriad affairs come, I have a resting place, and the original person does not change color or expression—this is returning to the true limitless. From now on, at the first thought’s arising, if it is the Heaven’s good conscience discovered, there is a true delight. I will gather and nurture it in the center, hide it deep. The Yi says: “Wash the heart, retreat and hide in secret.” If you glance back and see qi returning, suddenly feel qi flowing up and down in the elixir field, circulating endlessly, lively and unblocked, I also protect and nurture it, making this qi grow day by day. Hence said: “Immortals and daoists are not gods; they accumulate essence and gather qi to become true.” This is the fine detailed功 of accumulating essence and qi. As for preserving body and nurturing heart-nature, it all comes from this. Fear that worldly things hinder cultivation; know that all worldly things are karmic ties from past lives; do not cling to them, let them be. Just keep practicing, mainly flowing essence and qi, empty and unattached as use; then everywhere is the original person manifesting. Do you know this? Why cling to ancestral rod?  

### Sixteen  
Ancients said: “Extreme emptiness, extreme non-being, suddenly penetrating origin, yet still nurture with emptiness and non-being.” Not raising one thought, not attending one view, like a fool without knowledge, not feeling pain when struck, not feeling hate when cursed—only then is one a dao master. Hence ancients said: “To learn to be a fool is to be wise.” But not like the world’s fools, whose spirit is blocked, no lively and smooth qi. My so-called fool is only an empty hollow spirit, letting original nature and Heaven be, not like ordinary people thinking left and right, busy morning and evening, all planning for body and family. Not knowing Heaven has命 (life), unable to master it, wasting spirit and heart. Better to regret than delay cultivating benevolence. But how to practice benevolence? Confucius said: “I desire benevolence, then benevolence arrives.” How true! At the start, especially know the original person clearly, nurture the original person vast and great, then you gain power. Though movement and stillness differ, their flow is smooth and continuous; Heaven’s principle flows, never differing. So act naturally and you will enter without obstruction. If you can always illuminate and gather spirit light, returning to chaos Heaven, emptying self and other views, then you have the limitless body. When one sense moves, nothing is unknown before you; all is contained in me; then you see the limitless and the great ultimate’s function. Though you may not yet use the whole body’s great function, when the heavenly principle returns, you glimpse the empty hollow spirit; do not take this as joy. Joy belongs to yang; sorrow to yin; yin and yang alternate and cycle. When功 reaches this, you must lay down all attachments, forget the eight consciousnesses, then complete the great ultimate principle. When operating the cauldron, forming the elixir, this is true immortal skill. If you have discrimination, love and hate, not only do you add a demon obstacle to the dao, but even if by luck you refine successfully, you must start over, making a new furnace for the returning emptiness work. If you can follow my teaching, when you gain it, do not move thought; naturally with the great void as one body, no need to sit again and waste much effort. Know this? People rejoice in stillness, grieve in noise. Do they know that in noise, people’s voices rise, things disturb, this qi is already moving? Rather than fighting noise fiercely, better to exert great effort to cultivate stillness. Ancients said: “When people meet noise, it is just right to exert effort to turn back.” Now illuminate, suddenly awaken, breaking through true message—better than sitting on bamboo chair or mat a hundred thousand times. Can you truly see and believe? Try from tonight on: whenever others make noise, whether it concerns me or not, I keep sharpening and strengthening like a hundred-fold refined diamond, unchanging in color. This is strength, more than prolonged quiet. I further show you: cultivating to this, not like before when body and mind had no handle. In all actions and social dealings, always use an awakened heart, feeling I have a body lasting ten thousand years; all other things are illusions, why weigh them? Not only external things, even this body is a puppet in the arena; when I am present, I can speak and act; when I leave, it collapses—why rely on it? Only original primal qi lives with life and death, moving and stillness inseparable; in sudden turmoil or disaster, no increase or decrease. I only constantly hold and firmly believe, empty of dust and dirt, naturally shedding shell and departing, becoming a carefree great man. This takes only a few years’功; its completion is eternal, unchanged through ancient and modern, transcending Heaven and Earth to exist alone. Compared to a hundred years’ fleeting glory, a few years’ wealth and honor, which is greater, which smaller? You can judge. Alas! The teaching assembly is not often; the dao feast is hard to repeat. I have sounded the bell at this mountain over ten years; fortunately you have grasped the samadhi within. Surely another year’s teaching will be greatly fruitful. Do not waste this prime time.  

### Seventeen  
The way of cultivation is nothing but one yang. Yang’s first birth arises when yin is at its extreme, like today’s dense gloom blocking the sun and sky. One must slowly blow and nurture long; suddenly all yin cannot withstand true yang, like midnight at the hour of the child, clouds and fog over the sea, like the rising sun breaking through layers of shadow, revealing true yang’s face, with color and sound, like tea and fire, manifesting great brilliance. Yet this great manifestation of true yang is not gained by one day’s stillness; it must be nurtured long, hidden and concealed, storing light for a long time, then gradually accumulating, then this radiance bursts forth. Supreme yang shines brightly amid supreme yin’s solemnity; vitality lies in breath mechanism; life force lies in breath qi—this is the unchanging way of Heaven and Earth and man. Do not cultivate in stillness without seeing the face of primal Qian and hastily lie down. Know that Heaven and Earth’s dao and all things’ nature, if not nurtured, will not gestate; if not accumulated, will not form. Day and night breathe and nurture spirit; though no slightest movement or breath of life, the mechanism begins here, the origin starts here. When cultivating, there are moving and unmoving qi mechanisms; know that moving is foundation, but not the ultimate marvel. Know that no bottom exists; one境 leads to another境. If you can work without stopping, study without slackening, over time essence appears, over time marvel arises—“the longer the more fragrant.” Generally, when功 reaches tastelessness, flavor must arise from this. Heaven as Heaven, if yin does not reach extreme, yang will not be born. When things exhaust, dao turns; Heaven and Earth’s principle, if not exhausted, will not change; if not long, will not transform. The poem says: “At mountain’s end and water’s limit, doubt no road; among dark willows and bright flowers, another village.” Also: “When one works, reaching all directions dark, no road to enter, then one enters.” In short, great doubt leads to great enlightenment; small doubt to small enlightenment; no doubt, no enlightenment. My master has observed your功 long; you have only reached the first layer of yin extreme yang birth. Yin is true yang’s agitation; suddenly yin and yang contend, neither yielding; great blockage arises. Some say I have no root vessel, cannot enter dao, and think to retreat at once. Others seek immediate results at start, encountering demon disturbance. All due to weak will, unstable cultivation, unclear dao, and unsteady faith. You endure hardship, so have this marvel. When spirit and qi partly unite, there is some混沌 (chaos); fully united, there is full混沌. This is the sign of mundane breath dying, true breath born, mundane heart dying, dao heart born. With this混沌 scene, your spirit and qi unite, and the true great ultimate returns. When spirit and qi fully unite, naturally all is clouded and confused; outside unaware of man or Heaven; inside unaware of spirit or qi; like rising in clouds and mist, no dregs between; then merging with Heaven, Earth, and man as one qi. This is “attaining harmony, Heaven and Earth in place, all things nurtured.” Your功 must reach this境界 (realm) to see the true face of primal Qian, filling Heaven and Earth without limit. Then nurture more, roast more, turning all body yin into qi, all qi into spirit; this is hundred thousand myriad dharma bodies without end. Though you have not reached this, the dharma body is already stored, and in future there will be this spectacle; only accumulate long to form. Do not seek quick results.

I teach you the method of gathering brilliance. What is brilliance? Light. The human heart’s brightness arises from eyes; heart light and eye light shine together, uninterruptedly, naturally the chest is vast and open, no thing or matter disturbs my heart or occupies my numinous palace. Nurtured long, a single spirit light shines universally, like sun and moon in the sky, no micro detail not illuminated. Only fear one thought’s brightness is lost by one thought’s recklessness, so brightness is not constant. Like nurturing eyes, one must guard against wind and cold outside, nurture spirit and qi inside, not letting a speck of dust intervene; then eyes naturally stay bright, seeing mountains, rivers, and people, all clearly known. If daily not well nurtured, eyes dim and spirit dull; though good and bad, beauty and ugliness are present, one cannot distinguish. How is nurturing heart different? The heart is not a lump of flesh; it is the most empty and numinous. Mencius said nurturing heart lies in few desires; but the chapters “Niu Mountain” and “Moving Heart” say one preserves night breath at dawn, one gathers righteousness to generate vast qi—how can qi be so important and heart slighted? Because heart is spirit of qi; qi supports heart. If one’s qi does not move, spirit naturally calms; spirit calms, heart naturally peaceful. So one does not say nurture heart, but nurture qi—this is the key to nurturing heart. If one does not deeply nurture qi but only seeks heart, many speak of nurturing heart all day yet do not attain heart’s peace. Look at fish: heart is like fish; qi is like water. Fish gets water and is safe; heart gets qi and is nurtured—this is certain principle. You have studied many years; do you know the way of nurturing qi? I say gather the Yellow Court, warm and roast—that is nurturing qi. Do you know this?

Further showing after Kan and Li meet and medicine is born, you must know when Qian and Kun meet to form elixir. Qian is nature; Kun is命 (life); this is metal and wood merging. When running water and fire, only medicine is born; no elixir forms. It must be after Kan and Li meet, Kun meets Qian, four images cluster as one, then the marvel of creation appears. Water and fire meet; true yang is born. I steal this qi mechanism, draw it up to the Heavenly Emperor’s palace, condense breath a moment, exert spirit, sweep away杂念, one intention without confusion, one thought not arising. Nurturing so, dragons and tigers fight, shaking Heaven and Earth; in a flash, the mud pellet’s阴精 (yin essence) turns to sweet dew and numinous water, cold springs dripping, falling into my crimson palace, bringing a cool and serene state. Long so, all yin stripped away, one spirit remains alone; throat ready to inhale tears, nose good for planting scallions—various states arise, all due to spirit fire nurturing, nature and earth turning light; all阴私 (yin secrets) vanish into non-being. Thus spirits connect, qi passes through, not only all毛窍 (hair orifices) but also reaches Heaven and Earth, ancient and modern, past and future affairs. Ah! Spirit is immortal? Marvelous! Truly profound! All by one bright thought, one qi nurturing, to reach such. My master now reveals the dao; if you meet this scene, do not be startled. Startled, spirit flees and qi scatters, wasting the discovery of golden flowers.  

### Twenty  
Pure, upright, chaste, and lonely, wishing to cultivate the great dao—truly an extraordinary woman; I deeply pity and praise her. In short, learning dao is nothing but washing heart and clearing thoughts, emptying heart as foundation; empty means numinous, numinous means true heart appears, primordial nature is born. This is one aspect of clarifying heart and seeing nature. Know that clarifying heart and seeing nature is not a great difficulty. If one can return one thought to the elixir field, use intention to illuminate, the first moving thought is heart. Clarify this, no other clarity exists. Before moving thought, a piece of emptiness and brightness, vague and murky, no thing—this is nature. Seeing this, no other seeing exists. If you can clarify heart and see nature thus, then at the time when myriad yin condenses and closes, suddenly one yang first moves, glance back and return light—this is what ancients called “winter solstice yang birth, midnight hour of child arriving.” I then turn light back to the breast; this is water source pure and clear, able to refine spirit immortal supreme medicine. Starting with curing illness and extending life, ending with becoming sage and true, all based on this one sign. Yet I say this method is very high; still fear women find it hard to understand; so I show a shallow learning. At the start, body must sit upright and proper, calm and peaceful; urge oneself, think no worldly affairs are truly mine to receive or use. Not only children and spouse vanish in a blink, like travelers leaving at night, each going east and west, you for you, I for me, separated; even the flesh and blood body, once eyes close and breath ceases, becomes mere dirt; what remains is only this heart nature. If daily cultivation is good, one piece of clear mechanism, bright and numinous, no drowsiness, one ascends to Heaven. When reincarnating, if heart is so bright, nature so numinous, who would fall into ox and horse herds? This shows those who nurture heart nature well benefit for thousands of lives. Clearly, who would choose to be born into poverty and suffering? They must choose good places to be born. This is principle and feeling. Those not cultivated, upon death, their heart is muddled and confused, like blind people wandering blindly, not choosing slopes or dangers; if karmic debts bind, they fall into the Three Realms and Six Paths or into poor suffering homes—this is inevitable. Those virtuous and pure who have heart for this dao, having recently experienced dangers and hardships, worldly feelings surely seen as illusions, unwilling to let heart cling again. My master urges you: worldly wealth and love, though many, last only five or six decades, must separate; how can dao cultivation bring enjoyment for billions of years without end? Seize this to see through red dust, open the net of sin, exert one step to leap out. Day and night only observe within the breast, breath in and out, one up and one down, let it be natural and free. Breathing out, do not rush to head and eyes; breathing in, do not rush to water palace; listen to it slowly and smoothly, freely, hundreds or thousands, wherever it goes, do not remember. Only condense spirit in the breast, regulate breath in the breast, follow its natural one out one in—this is enough. Long practice so, naturally yang qi arises, body vigorous and extraordinary, far greater than worldly gold, jade, wealth, spouse, and children’s joy! Though slight yin moves, still gather back to furnace; do not lie down chatting or doing outside affairs, so day by day and month by month, great effect arises.  

### Twenty-One  
The great dao is nothing but one great ultimate. Between Heaven and Earth, transformations birth and birth, marvelously changing, beyond measure. How can this be later heaven’s corpse qi? It is nearly primordial one qi. Today’s cultivators only refine later heaven’s qi, nurture later heaven’s spirit; even if done well, only body is healthy, no bit of numinous and marvelous spirit. Hence people live to a hundred, die like grass and trees, though strength varies, when returning to root and tomb, life and death are no different from ordinary people. Thus birth and death, death and birth, reincarnation and turning, cannot avoid suffering in the Six Paths and Three Realms. Because dao is only one thing, medicine only one flavor; without the great ultimate root and great medicine seed, even if cultivating day and night, one is still formed qi and matter, unable to penetrate mystery, walk on sun and moon—impossible. The most numinous, marvelous, pure, and subtle in Heaven and Earth, changing without form, hidden and manifest, is the great void primal qi, the limitless. This qi is vast and confused, truly without form or image, also called “emptiness births great ultimate.” Yet sages, immortals, heroes, and all flying, swimming, moving, growing, and transforming spirits all come from this primal qi. Yet the great ultimate is still the edge of emptiness, not to be changed by spirit. When qi mechanism moves, yin and yang divide, alternating soft and hard, then the great ultimate’s功 begins. The great ultimate is principle; yin and yang are qi. Principle and qi unite, Heaven and Earth and man are born. Principle and qi unite, sages, immortals, Buddhas’ elixirs form. You must first condense spirit in emptiness, merge qi in vastness, heart and body utterly empty. Suddenly awaken and move; my primal spirit becomes true intention, ruling the rotation of two qi; yet the two qi’s substance remains within the great ultimate’s emptiness. Called true yin and true yang joined as one millet pearl, subtle, complete, unfathomable divine elixir. Though water and fire meet, Qian and Kun operate, this coming and going, revolving unceasing, returning to furnace, sealing, roasting without loss, all in one place of emptiness and no trace; only then can one steal Heaven and Earth’s primal qi, unlike formed qi and matter with kinds. This is the supreme highest path. I see some say old age qi declines, lead and mercury lacking; do they not know primordial qi is neither empty nor full, unlike later heaven’s things with increase and decrease? I now point out the subtlety. People only fear no功 in refining heart and nurturing nature. If you can clarify heart and see nature truly in yourself, then spirit condenses and qi grows strong; spirit clears and essence fills. Will is the commander of qi; spirit is the ancestor of essence. When spirit gathers, qi gathers; qi gathers, essence gathers; spirit clears, qi clears; qi clears, essence clears. If you can lay down all attachments, empty all, spirit clears. If you can condense spirit in emptiness, turn light to profound orifice, spirit gathers. Then no need to seek mouth fluids, sweet taste, or fragrance. These are minor effects, having them is not precious. Even elixir books say: “Only see Yellow River waters surging upstream,” only describing qi moving and essence born, a virtual image. If said truly present, that is later heaven’s formed essence with form, color, and taste, not primordial essence, not worth valuing. In short, spirit condenses and qi gathers; inside and outside the body naturally rise and fall, fill up and circulate; truly “deep and deep its benevolence, vast and vast its abyss, vast and vast its Heaven,” truly firm, upright, pure essence qi image. You who have practiced long may have this marvelous mechanism, only not yet brewed long, not yet seen long-lasting great transformation flowing endlessly. Do not doubt old age, lack of medicine, or daily nurturing emptiness spirit and not seeing mouth fluids or flowing limbs.  

### Twenty-Two  
Ancients had two levels of功 method; what are they? The Buddhist say: “Lying wheel has skill, able to cut off a hundred thoughts.” This is “entering meditation功 to stop thought.” The higher功 method, also ancient Buddhas say: “Huineng has no skill, does not cut off a hundred thoughts.” This is “sudden and thorough penetration, no duality.” But such realms, how easy to reach? Must first rely on lower功, barely supporting, long time deep in place, naturally having smooth access. I further show功 to stop thought. People’s thoughts and worries, since falling from mother’s womb, are bound by qi and temperament, unable to be like primordial no affairs. When knowledge just opens, desires arise, heart and spirit flit about, friends of thought accompany, cannot stop even a moment. To have thought and no thought,念 (thought) and no念, needs a hundredfold effort. Just stopping thought may not reach no thought or no worry; moreover, thought arises one heart, stopping thought another heart; not only unable to stop heart, but letting heart run wild. What to do? Only by spirit entering elixir field, gathering qi in the circle; this is water and fire joining as one. When water and fire are completed, neither harms the other; spirit flying does not fly; qi moving does not move—this is the true eye treasure of stopping thought. When matters arise, I respond to them; act according to things, measure giving; keep spirit and qi interaction unchanged from the start; never let outside guest qi seize my master qi;功 is but slight with a bit of spirit light to illuminate, not letting qi leave spirit or spirit leave qi—this is stopping thought. Otherwise, thought arises and you follow to stop it; thought ceases and you follow to cease; arising and ceasing are impermanent; you will have more stopping than stopping. Such failure to stop is worse than restraining selfish desires. Why? Because spirit and qi unite, all embraced, original true face appears. True face appears, right thought appears; all evil, selfish, and confused thoughts cannot interfere. Let a thousand strange things come, I guard my original, give others their due. How bad are worldly troubles? Yet they come in waves; not ignoring them wholly, but as I said: give things to things, govern people by people; this is responding and not responding, not responding and responding. If you can stop thought, heart and spirit calm, wisdom light grows daily; do not keep one self-satisfied thought, thinking what I cultivate is fully gained. Even a bit gained is from many hardships; once lost,功 is wasted. Hence: “Learning is like not reaching, fearing loss.” With this thought, naturally always hold and keep; unaware and unknown, you follow Heaven’s law. Otherwise, suddenly gain, joy; suddenly lose, worry. This joy and worry thought scatters spirit and qi. Know this? This is your recent crucial point. Follow this功, this is ancient Buddha’s “not cutting off a hundred thoughts, bodhi is long.” If not yet here, you may use intense功 until reaching no thought and no worry.  

### Twenty-Three  
The Supreme One said: “Deep and obscure, within is essence.” When阴气 (yin qi) condenses and closes, all things dry and wither, no sound or smell, no form or color. In this vast boundless, faint and indistinct state, essence is born. Know this? When deep and obscure without trace, true essence grows; if one bright awareness arises, a bit of deep and obscure is lost, and true essence cannot be complete, lacking a place to grow. Know this? When deep and obscure lasts long, like today’s layers of阴雾 (yin fog) gathering, yang qi incubates here. Long nurturing, like ignorance and unawareness, like the simple folk. Suddenly one awakening moves, confusion arises, transformation appears; then true one primordial yang shows its sign. This is the Supreme One’s “vague and dim, within is something.” That something is one yang qi, the ancestor qi of Heaven, Earth, and man. Called “Heaven and Earth’s heart.” You must, before one yang moves, be deep and obscure, unaware of Heaven, Earth, man, or self—this is deep storage, inner beauty. When suddenly awakened, true yang appears. This yang is not easy to get; only when阴气 condenses to extreme, one must be empty, still, and deep, knowing nothing or feeling nothing, then true yang can arise. Thus human birth arises from this yang; all things of Heaven and Earth arise from this yang. Look at Earth with form, Moon with魄 (soul), like human body. Earth without Heaven’s primal yang, Moon without Sun’s light, Earth and Moon are cold, dull, dead things. Only Earth receives Heaven’s qi, Moon receives Sun’s light; Earth can birth myriad things, Moon can illuminate myriad things; human gathering yang is no different. But how to gather and obtain it? Because human body is full of dull and dark魂气 (soul qi), only the light of the eyes reveals a bit of true yang. This yang is true nature and命 (life), the root of limitless great ultimate. I can turn light back, with no knowledge, no feeling, no thought, no worry, purely following the rule; this is gathering yang to be the root of life. When suddenly in the water palace there is a bit of vigorous misty qi mechanism, coming without knowing or thinking, how to nurture it? No need to seek elsewhere; previously obtained in deep obscure, still guarded by deep obscure, returning to my unknowing, unthinking Heaven. I think when one turns light back, one has life qi gathered in the elixir field, able to last and not perish, like things growing in sunlight. How much more when stored long, true yang arises, how can one not become a long-living true person? Only fear cultivators stop and start, then cannot avoid birth and death. If you can always hold, even without foundation, you can have命 by me not by Heaven.  

### Twenty-Four  
Today I hear your lofty talks, with great insight. Discussing life’s root, it is limitless and great ultimate, one point of primordial chaos’s first breath—truly no error. Yet also know immortal and mundane are only a few hairs’ difference. From this arise preservation and nurturing, nurturing and moving Kan and Li water and fire, awaiting qi mechanism’s stir; then child advances yang fire, noon retreats yin talisman, gather five clusters and four, meet three return one, gather back to furnace, still returning to great ultimate’s truth. Great ultimate is principle, the root of birth and birth; yin and yang are qi, the tools of birth and birth. Without great ultimate, no root of birth; without yin and yang, no tools of birth; how then form dharma bodies of hundreds of millions? I teach so there is one profound gateway orifice; Buddha and Patriarchs say “sentient beings come to plant seed.” Without feeling, no seed; without seed, no birth. When this seed arises, if not careful, it falls into later heaven’s dust and dregs, unworthy as medicine. I teach you at no knowledge and no awareness, suddenly having awareness; this thunder shakes, revealing Heaven and Earth’s heart—this is the point. But daily you must have bright mirror and sharp sword, able to not lose the opportunity and seal it. Otherwise, after one awakening, you awaken to other things, not usable. Hence: “Great ultimate originally has no two,” only because of momentary change, it becomes later heaven’s things. Hence later cultivators, same cultivation, same gathering, yet some have illusory elixir, some true elixir; this is due to one breath’s occasional movement—able to seize the opportunity or not. If you can seize the profound gateway orifice and not lose the opportunity—know primordial qi must be nurtured by primordial yin-yang water and fire, able to unite like kinds. Ancients said: “To hold a chicken, use eggs; to mend a pot, need metal.” Thus, my primal spirit leads it to open the gate, ascend to mud pellet; my head and eyes’ dizziness, lit by this spirit fire, all turn to numinous water, entering crimson palace, a cool place—this is the Yi’s “mountain and marsh communicate qi.” Yet this qi and liquid are the great longevity medicine, able to nurture mortal body, form dharma body. If you get this true qi and numinous liquid, many stubborn old diseases can be dispelled. Only fear one cup of water cannot quench a cartload of fire. Know then the profound gateway’s movement is where original person and immortal seed lie. Except for this one movement, all else is illusory. Like the two phases of yang birth, four phases of gathering, all yin-yang water and fire; only tools of birth, not the root. Observe if Heaven and Earth’s yin and yang do not move, all things do not grow; human body’s Kan and Li do not meet, limbs cannot flow. If one wants no disease and long life, only by primordial true yin and yang circulating and alternating, can one enjoy longevity. As for body within body, child begets grandson, grandson begets child, hundreds of millions dharma bodies all arise from this. The two phases of nurturing mean Heaven and Earth nurturing yin-yang qi; the four phases running heavenly cart mean four seasons passing with sun and rain. As for blowing of the empty vessel, wind disperses; spirit’s shaking, thunder shakes; following nature and moving, cannot not do; also cannot act; this is the joyous兑 (joy) that brings life. Advancing and retreating, returning to earth furnace, this is艮 (stopping) that brings life and growth. Without Qian’s ruling and Kun’s storing, nurturing inside, few succeed. I always say: only recognize original person, yin-yang water and fire run day and night unceasing, no need to build foundation, can live long. Hence ancient scholars only regard nurturing emptiness and non-being nature as first great matter; building foundation is placed later and not spoken of, because heart-nature not pure, building foundation brings more demon obstacles. Know this? This is why sages emphasize refining self.  

### Twenty-Five  
My master before pointed out refining nature in movement, refining命 (life) in stillness; in fact nature and命 are one and two, two and one. Separately: in chaos there is deep obscure thing called nature; if one is pure and one, holding its center, this is nurturing nature. Seeing the gate of birth and transformation is命; if one flows from Wu to Ji, treasures essence and qi, this is establishing命. In short, nature and命 are born from great ultimate’s movement and stillness. Great ultimate has no movement or stillness; nature and命’s movement and stillness are great ultimate’s movement and stillness. Great ultimate is vast and mighty, no thought or action, no sound or smell; yet all thought and sound and smell arise from great ultimate. Hence: though great ultimate has no thing, it is root of all things. One can be still and awake; awake and still; great ultimate is within. Great ultimate within is生气 (life qi) within; great medicine and great elixir also within. Hence said: “There is a thing, whole and complete, born before Heaven and Earth.” Without this thing, no birth. Elixir refiner refines this great ultimate. Becoming immortal and sage is nothing but this thing. This thing in man is “one point of spirit before parents’ birth.” Cultivating it in body, no other marvel; only in chaos, no knowledge and no movement, suddenly having knowledge and movement, with no form entering, Heaven and man union, mysterious female gate, orifice of life and death. Only from nothing comes being; from death comes life; from yin comes yang. Qian and Kun unite, sun and moon join, man and beast reborn—based on this. But this yang birth is hardest to get. Supreme One said: “Heaven and Earth unite to send down sweet dew.” Must be at Heaven and Earth’s virtue union, sun and moon’s joint disk, at the end of dark and start of new moon; time is short, fleeting; without sharp sword and bright mirror, cannot harmonize water and fire, roast yin and yang; without bright mirror in chest, cannot recognize; without strong sword in hand, cannot pick; all in a moment. Though moment is hardest, ancients said: “A hundred years, thirty-six thousand five hundred and sixty days, only this one day; one day only this one hour; one hour only this one breath; within one breath, the marvel is only one yin and one yang’s movement and stillness.” When moving is not, when still is not; only at still extreme and movement beginning, pure yin and yang start. At this moment, vast and confused, unaware and unknown, misty and hazy, like drunk and dazed, silent and unmoving, feeling and connecting all Heaven and Earth’s causes and effects. This is Kan and Li meeting the dregs, water and fire just forming one qi, Qian and Kun united, yin and yang returning to the beginning, purely great harmony embraced, naturally in the void cave. If not careful, after movement later heaven’s thoughts arise, far from great ultimate’s completion, cannot be elixir. I secretly wish you cultivators to be spirit and clear. Cultivators must have heart bright
