## Records of the Joyous Nurturing Hall, Volume Four (Segment Twenty-Six)

### One  
The matter of cultivation and refinement rests fundamentally on the hidden virtues of yin—on conduct and deed—and hinges upon careful management and nurturing. As for the talk of dragons and tigers, lead and mercury combined, that is but a trifling detail at the end of the matter. There are those foolish ones who fail to grasp this essential work, who rashly claim, “I cultivate my nature, I refine my life; why should I wait to cultivate external merit to benefit others and things?” Such people do not understand the dao of “exhausting nature to reach life.” Long ago, Confucius told Yan Zi that the root of benevolence must begin from what one sees, hears, says, and does; our dao never departs from this, so how could it lie outside? For what is controlled externally is precisely what nourishes the inner. Thus, when the eyes always see goodness, the liver and soul find peace; when the ears always hear goodness, the kidney essence strengthens; when the mouth always speaks goodness, the heart and spirit calm; when the nose always smells goodness, the lung soul is serene; when the hands perform good deeds and the feet walk on good ground, the spleen-earth remains stable, and the body is healthy. Only if the six inner gates admit no improper matters will the five internal organs naturally possess their primordial qi. By then, employing inner nurturing to accumulate the five organs’ original qi, the liver qi transforms and the soul returns to its source; the lung qi transforms and the corporeal soul returns to its source; the spleen-earth condenses and the intention returns to its source; the heart fire flourishes and the spirit returns to its source; the kidney water strengthens and the essence returns to its source. This is what is called the gathering of the three blossoms in the cauldron, the five qi returning to the source, condensing to form a dharma body. If one entrusts the true secret to a person full of selfishness and deceit, not to mention they cannot succeed in external cultivation, even if they do, they will surely overturn the cauldron and spill the elixir, causing great harm. Therefore, at the very beginning, one must first accumulate external merit and internal virtue, nurturing both inside and out, before one can become pure, bright, and refined enough to refine into the elixir. This initial stage of work is called “building the foundation.” It is like constructing a thousand-zhang-high terrace: one must first start from level ground, ensuring the foundation is solid, then the lofty pavilions and painted halls will not fear collapse. Judging from my disciples, not a few, even now, only those with simple conduct and fondness for goodness make progress. Those who have not accumulated virtue, or whose virtue is not genuine, cannot penetrate deeply into my dao. You who have labored long, enduring hardships without retreat, how pure your nature is, how vigorous your essence and qi, so you hear my secret and practice it without hindrance. Now I specially transmit the True Yang One Secret. The study of alchemy indeed requires nourishing the postnatal spirit and qi to strengthen the physical body, but it especially requires nurturing the prenatal heart and nature to form the dharma body. Though the physical body and dharma body differ in subtle exterior and interior, they must not be separated. Without the physical body, what can the dharma body rely on? Without the dharma body, the physical body is but a shell. Every cultivator must first protect and consolidate the postnatal spirit and qi; only then can the prenatal heart and nature be cultivated. Though my teaching says “refine essence to transform qi,” in truth qi is the spirit of the heart; though it says “refine qi to transform spirit,” in truth spirit is the void of nature. Only by lengthening my essence and qi does the heart-spirit begin to appear; by preserving my primordial spirit does the true nature endure. When the student reaches the stage of spiritual calm and vigorous qi, the primordial qi surges mightily, the primordial spirit leaps, and my original heart and nature naturally penetrate their true meaning. From this, returning the golden liquid elixir is not difficult. Thus, building the foundation pertains to nature; returning the elixir pertains to life. The saying goes: to establish life by nature is to refine the intangible nature into tangible life, producing myriad transformed bodies, all condensed from this nature—there is no other dao. If you grasp this principle, you will know that the path of cultivation is nothing but accomplishing the single character 性 (nature), and returning to our prenatal one qi. Knowing this qi is prior to existence, wholly empty, beyond all distinctions; once it enters the human body, it transforms into the two qi of yin and yang, giving birth to the body of the Five Phases’ transformations. I then condense yin and yang and the Five Phases back into one qi—that is the elixir. Nurtured long and refined deeply, after ten years, one will surely form a most numinous and most sacred immortal child, all formed from this primordial qi, which is nature itself. Only by moving the one-origin spirit and the one-origin qi can the dao be nearly attained.

### Two  
I reveal the mysterious gateway, a single aperture, which is the root of the cultivator’s path and the foremost task of the student. Unlike the middle and lower vehicles’ teachings of apertures, which have form to point to and names to establish, you must begin from chaos upon chaos to find the original root of the elixir, the foundation of spirit and immortality. At first, when sitting in meditation, your mind must be vast and expansive, clear and numinous, wandering in the boundless realm, guiding breath in the void. Yet you must not dwell solely outside; it must be as if inside yet not inside, as if outside yet not outside, so that my heart’s qi communicates with the numinous yang qi of Heaven and Earth. When spirit condenses and breath adjusts, suddenly one enters the edge of chaos, as if without foothold or grasp. This is the utmost emptiness and profound stillness, the place of settling body and establishing life. At this moment, suddenly one awakens, revealing the true face before birth, a complete and whole Taiji essence, Heaven, Earth, and beings sharing root and stem with me. Upon this awakening, one governs the prenatal single primordial yang within, moving the breath’s divine qi, gathering it back, forbidding even the slightest leakage. In an instant, the qi mechanism surges vigorously, feeling the one qi flowing through Heaven and Earth inside and out; here the nature’s ground is first perfected, called the birth of nature’s yang. Yet in the postnatal realm, this is the appearance of nature’s light; in the prenatal great dao, this is the birth of essence yang. The ancients said: “The great dao is dark and deep; the Taiji flows essence; the heart embraces primordial transformation; the qi moves vast and even.” This is what they meant. With this essence born, I merely follow the natural breath, restrain the thinking of spirit and consciousness, gathering and releasing, releasing and gathering again, thus taking the prenatal essence. Then this essence descends into the water palace; the primordial spirit summons a drop of primordial qi descending from the Qian palace, returning it—this is refining essence into qi. If the aperture opens too early and one descends to the water palace to refine, the medicine is tender and unharvestable. If the vigorous qi has long filled the space but the qi mechanism disperses, the medicine is old and unharvestable. Many students fail to realize this and often burn and circulate in vain. From this essence entering qi, fire descending into water, then moving the natural divine breath, drawing from the yin channel into the central palace, matching the essence in the Li center, naturally water and fire are balanced, spirit and qi unite as one. You must know: “Always guard the medicine furnace and watch the fire’s timing; simply calm the spirit and breath and let nature take its course.” Do not again inquire of the yin channel. This is a crucial injunction. When spirit and qi first meet, one feels a misty vapor rising from the Yongquan point straight upward, warming for a long time, then one feels the qi surging from head to toe, ready to move the river cart. I then guide with intention, condensing without dispersing, like a steady wooden peg in a spinning wheel, stable and balanced, neither leaning nor swaying, while the wheel spins ceaselessly. Yet the body’s one qi originally flows without end; why wait for human guidance? Not knowing that after birth, this aperture is blocked and closed, if not illuminated and governed, wandering thoughts and distractions enter, yang qi that should rise does not rise, yin qi that should descend does not descend, rising and descending become irregular, yin and yang lose order, Heaven and Earth fail to communicate, and all things fail to be born—thus darkness and blockage become the sky. When moving upward to the crown, the extreme place of return, this is the birth of yin. Descending to the Yellow Court, the furnace seals firmly, no trace remains, as if before I moved or refined. This is one cycle. Here one nurtures again; if there is movement, one refines again; stillness nurtures, movement refines, cycling endlessly—thus the foundation is built.

### Three  
The mysterious gateway, a single aperture, is the gateway of the prenatal undifferentiated one qi, without sound or odor to touch, no form or color to see. This is the highest of the highest methods, refining the void to grasp the heavenly secret. Since ancient times, few immortals have at the outset of practice awakened into this realm. Speaking of the gateway, it is not limited to one end; when refining essence to transform qi, there is the gateway of essence birth; when refining qi to transform spirit, there is the gateway of qi movement. These places must not be left unclear. What is the gateway of essence birth? When sitting in meditation, even if one condenses spirit and adjusts breath, when one reaches the state of vague clarity, spirit condensed and breath adjusted, at that moment a true essence is hidden in a point in the yin channel. From the chaos awakening, one hastily gathers the yin channel qi back to the central yellow proper position, combining with the long-accumulated yin essence in the Li center, roasting into one. There is also talk of tender and old medicine. What is tender? If not yet in chaos, it is no medicine. If already in chaos but unable to harmonize spirit and qi into one, even if taken from the yin channel, it is tender medicine, unfit for refining. If after awakening one cannot discern clearly and gather promptly, and after awakening again is distracted by other matters, moving again and wandering outward, this is old medicine, even less usable. When qi yang is born, when is the medicine old or tender? From this essence birth, gathering it back and combining with the spiritual fluid of the Li palace, at this time spirit enters qi, qi surrounds spirit; at first spirit and qi sometimes unite, sometimes separate, unable to merge into one—spirit is the spirit fire of the Li palace, qi is the spirit water of the Kan center. When spirit and qi merge into one, flowing freely in the elixir field, lively and active, my body’s numinous qi and the external yang qi of Heaven and Earth naturally unite as one—this is the birth of qi yang, the manifestation of the mysterious gateway, the so-called “Heaven and Earth unite to descend sweet dew.” The dew is the external numinous yang qi. At this time one must awaken from chaos; only then is the water source pure and unstained by dust. Taking it here is the refining of two parts fire and two parts tender new water, precisely the medicine sprout’s birth. Also called “Li sprays jade pistils, Kan exhales golden petals,” the union of two families forming the elixir. Otherwise, without great stillness, there can be no great settling. If one takes before the great union of the mysterious gateway, it is tender medicine; if after the great union one delays taking, the newly born numinous qi disperses, becoming old medicine, unfit for use. I further reveal a shortcut: if you can achieve chaos, that is best; if not, just keep your own mind continuous, dense, and serene, returning to the same origin, vague yet with form, obscure yet with knowledge, not arising one bright thought, two gathering together harmoniously without division, then again seeing your body’s qi and the external qi mingling, misty and vaporous, surging vigorously, lively and soft, joyous and free. This is the right time; hasten to move the river cart, the great elixir is within reach.

### Four  
The ancients said: “One aperture, the mysterious gateway, Heaven and Earth unite to form. Within it hides the spirit and qi cavity; inside are the essences of Kan and Li.” Before a person is born, this primordial true qi originally hangs suspended in the great void, covering Heaven and Earth, utterly beyond comprehension. When father’s essence and mother’s blood, two spirits, intertwine, this cauldron is established; within it, a passageway can contain the primordial true one qi of Heaven and Earth—this is the aperture within the aperture, also called the wondrous aperture within. This is what the Buddhists call the “nirvana wondrous heart,” the Daoists call the “mysterious gateway’s door,” the “root of Heaven and Earth,” and the Confucians call “accomplishing nature and preserving life, the gate of dao and righteousness.” In short, it is this one wondrous aperture alone. After birth, tainted by worldly dust and shifted by customs, this aperture becomes blocked, and this wonder is lost to no one’s knowledge. Even if sometimes the aperture opens, arising without control or awareness, clearly revealing a new moon, precisely the true face of the Tathagata, yet with the dust roots and vulgar qi growing daily, in a moment it is unknown where it vanishes. The so-called petty person cannot be without benevolence, only arising and perishing, without a single gaze fixed, a single hand grasping without losing the opportunity. Now I reveal the truth: you must know that spirit and qi mingle in the elixir field, with a flowing, leaking, pure and effortless subtlety—that is the aperture revealing the true form, capable of transcending birth and death, escaping the wheel of rebirth, becoming immortal and ascending to sagehood. Yet when the primal yang first moves, its mechanism is subtle, its qi tender, utterly beyond grasp or measure; how then do you apply work? You must first refine away selfishness, letting this heart roam the great void, qi passing through the vast expanse, empty and boundless—only then is the hand skillful. For this aperture is originally void; void meets void, like attracts like. If one clings rigidly to this bodily aperture, not only will the spirit’s mystery not appear, but the aperture will soon be sealed and blocked. Those born desire the aperture’s vitality and liveliness, yet cannot do without first gathering spirit and qi into one family, called “establishing the frame,” also called “establishing the flask and pipe.” What is the frame? It is the union of spirit and qi, also the establishment of the furnace and cauldron. Once the furnace and cauldron stand, then slowly roast with yin and yang spirit fire; suddenly spirit melts and qi flows smoothly, entering the vague and obscure. This is the time spirit enters the aperture’s vitality, also called the so-called “healthy forgetfulness.” It is not the mingling of empty spirit and qi, but there is a drop of pure spirit elixir inside. The ancients said: “The heart is the pivot of all affairs; one must forget it before seeking it.” Forgetting means forgetting the deluded heart; seeking means seeking the true heart. The vision of the true heart must come after forgetting. If you can discern clearly and obtain this, why fear the true medicine not arising or the numinous embryo not forming? This true transmission, since ancient times, few immortals have revealed this wondrous truth. I recall your earnest hearts seeking the dao, so I point out this secret, so you may have confidence. As for the primal yang’s movement, there is great qi mechanism to rely on. Carelessly speaking of Heaven, Earth, and beings, not knowing who or what, it is just my five senses and hundred bones; at this point the misty vapor surges and flows inside and out, like walking in clouds or sitting in clear emptiness—this is called “forgetting forgetting.” Yet “forgetting forgetting” cannot fully describe it; one does not know where this qi and spirit come from or how they arise, only feeling the vastness of Heaven and Earth, the brightness of sun and moon, all insufficient to compare their weight. I have my own layer of Heaven and Earth, two wheels of sun and moon, not the same Heaven and Earth and sun and moon as ordinary people. This is the profound and mysterious true scene, also the special manifestation of one’s own mysterious aperture’s vitality. If you sit in meditation and open this aperture, seeing this wondrous form, that is the great manifestation of primal yang, able to move the river cart. Without this scene, you fear the cauldron lacks true seed, recklessly manipulating water and fire, chasing yin qi to pursue yang qi, day by day yang diminishes and yin grows; in the end, it is all a faction of yin evil and selfishness at work. Some know future matters or see empty room light, not knowing that those who think they have attained the elixir and become sages are mistaken. The human body is either yin or yang; if not yang, then yin; yin qi growing is nothing but cooking yang qi. When yang declines day by day and yin advances day by day, is it not the same as yang spirit’s growth, all by accumulation? Why? Before cultivation, yin and yang are peaceful and separated like host and guest, both weak and unable to contend; but with accumulation, yin qi forms its own gate, becoming a great qi mechanism beyond measure. Now I speak of this accumulated yin qi as a yin ghost, so you know yin and yang are but a single interval, and you must be cautious at the start. Yet this teaching has never been reached by the sages of old; I now dare to reveal it, especially to point it out. You must keep your mouth shut and tongue hidden, so that you may honor the master and respect the dao.

### Five  
There is no other marvel in refining the elixir than first recognizing your own original face. This original face, how could it be anything else? Like the bright moon in the sky, round and complete, neither leaning nor swaying, illuminating the nine provinces and myriad nations without exception—this is the prenatal true face, the heart itself, the nature itself, nature is Buddha, no difference. When the student in stillness suddenly feels their heart’s light shining bright, unstained and unattached, boundless and infinite, yet truly having nothing at all, this is the bright heart and seeing nature, truly attaining the prenatal face. But upon first seeing this scene, one cannot help but be startled and joyful, giving rise to the postnatal mundane heart, and the prenatal muddled primordial spirit is scattered by this mundane heart. Do you understand? I show you a method: generally, when sitting in meditation practicing stillness, if you have a vague sense of unity with Heaven and Earth in your embrace, you may settle and quiet further; even if thoughts arise, you simply disregard them all, so the knowing heart, the startled heart, the joyful heart all vanish. Moreover, when you have been still for a long time, suddenly entering the great vehicle, though seeing the true nature and essence, it is but a fleeting glimpse; you must continue to adjust and nurture for a long time, so that this heart and nature truly enter your meditation, restoring your original belongings, without joy or surprise. After long refinement, you can return to the root and restore life. Having seen nature is not easy; you have suffered for more than ten years. From then on, stiller and stiller, more settled and more settled, your whole body is like a lazy person sitting on a couch, disliking to move, not thinking of eating or drinking; naturally day by day renewed, the great medicine arises. Furthermore, you must regulate your breath so that it neither goes out nor comes in, naturally and spontaneously, unlike before when you labored hard. Then you enter the ranks of great awakening. What I worry about is that you each seek clothing and food for your own body, inevitably entangled in the red dust. If I do not come early to rescue you, I fear you will drown and not rise, abandoning all your former bitter efforts—what a pity! Now continue to cultivate as before, resolute and firm; it need not be three or two years—just a few months will suffice. Do you understand? This is attaining the dao, this is becoming true. It is not that attaining the dao has a place to attain, nor that becoming true has a method to become. I earnestly hope you do not travel a thousand li only to be one li short, lest you fail to see your home and turn back. Especially when you have clearly glimpsed your home nearby, I come early to point this out, to prevent retreat. Passing this gate is true attainment; otherwise, you remain a mundane person.

### Six  
I observe that you have not yet understood the dao of establishing the master stillness and ultimate. Therefore I previously said, “Conceal the Heavenly Gang within, extend the Dipper’s handle without.” If you conceal the Heavenly Gang within but cannot extend the Dipper’s handle without; or extend the Dipper’s handle without but cannot conceal the Heavenly Gang within, then you are busy and flustered, confused and anxious, trying to do two things with one mind, without mastery. Is the dao of refining the elixir like this? If so, it means the master stillness is not established, like a world without an emperor to sit in control, where civil and military officials quarrel in chaos. The Heavenly Gang is the master stillness; the Dipper’s handle is the civil and military ministers, obeying the emperor’s commands. Mencius said: “With one upright ruler, the country is settled.” Confucius said: “Like the North Star dwelling in its place, all the stars revolve around it.” From this you see that establishing the master stillness is the way to establish the human ultimate. From this, the positions of Heaven and Earth, the nurturing of all things, above and below flowing with Heaven and Earth, how could there be anything else? It is nothing but the master stillness established and the qi mechanism flowing, naturally resonating with Heaven and Earth and all things, truly bringing about centrality and harmony, never chasing after things beyond central harmony. Confucius said: “What does Heaven say? It runs the four seasons, and all things grow.” Heaven merely sets the master stillness, and the four seasons run, all things grow, simply listening to the automatic creation. When the human master stillness is established, yin and yang and creation move and still automatically; thus the qi mechanism of Heaven and Earth and all things moves and stills with it. Moreover, humans originally flow intimately with Heaven and Earth and all things. Zhu Xi said: “If my heart is upright, Heaven and Earth’s heart is upright; if my qi is smooth, all things’ qi is smooth.” Without moving a step or turning a thought, one naturally establishes oneself and establishes others, a divine transformation! Because human temperament is constrained and desires cloud the mind, it has long ceased to communicate with Heaven and Earth and all things. So even within one’s own body there is barbarism and chaos; how much more so with the external Heaven and Earth and myriad things? The ancients said: “Heaven and man share one principle; things and self have the same source.” People think this is an empty phrase, but they do not know it is true. Now I explain it again. At the beginning of sitting meditation, one must first nurture spirit. Spirit and the great void are originally one body, but you must not cling rigidly. You must first let the spirit roam in the void so it can be purely nurtured; then the spirit naturally returns to life. Once spirit condenses in the void, you must slowly gather it back into the empty cave, adjust and nurture it. When spirit returns to life, then test the result: is there no thought, reaching utmost emptiness and profound stillness? If you can reach utmost emptiness and profound stillness, nothing at all, this is the study of returning to the root and clarifying the source, and the master stillness is established. Once the master stillness is established, with spirit descending into the water palace, that is spirit entering the qi cavity, also nature controlling emotion, various metaphors abound—none other than my one drop of most numinous, most sacred, most pure, most void primordial spirit descending to combine with the lead in the water palace, like fire entering the water realm. For a while, fire steams water to boil, and true yang is born. The lower field belongs to yin and water; yin and water are both cold in nature. The middle field, the scarlet palace, belongs to yang and fire; fire and yang are both hot in nature. Therefore, the human body’s upper half is Heaven and yang, the lower half Earth and yin; without spirit fire roasting, the water is cold and the metal is cold, sinking and unable to rise, and the person’s dullness grows duller, ignorance deeper. I say spirit entering qi is the dao of water and fire mating. When water and fire unite, the misty vapor surges forth, water-born metal arises, also called silver emerging from lead, also called yang born from yin—these are all metaphors for the human life’s root, truly the foundation of longevity and immortality. At this time, spirit is settled, breath adjusted, body and mind refreshed, soft and joyful, floating as if soaring above the Nine Heavens, wandering the vast realm, with no end in sight. This is spirit united with the great void, qi communicating with Heaven, Earth, and all things, truly unknowable in its cause. This is the master stillness established; there is no such thing as concealing the Heavenly Gang inside but not pushing the Dipper’s handle outside, or pushing the Dipper’s handle outside but not concealing the Heavenly Gang inside. You must know that before the master stillness is established, you may slowly condense spirit to meet qi. When qi and spirit harmonize, then in the obscure and vague realm, transformation produces lead. Indeed, when lead is born, the time comes and the matter arises, the mechanism moves and spirit follows, gently lifting and silently moving, a ball of great harmony qi flowing up and down, like a boat moving with the current. This suffices to prove spirit and qi have gathered, transforming three origins into one origin, uniting five qi into one qi, and establishing the master stillness, so the immortal dao can be cultivated. Have you also once grasped this? My master said: “What is the postnatal prenatal?” The postnatal is all spirit, qi, essence, and blood. This is the fleshly lump; cultivating it to refine the golden elixir is of no use. At the start, condense spirit in the void, unite qi in the vastness. This void and vastness are the postnatal prenatal. I tell you plainly: when sitting in meditation, though not departing from the physical elixir field and the eye’s light, the mind’s light, the breath of mouth and nose, you must be lively and vigorous to return the jade liquid elixir. Why jade liquid? Because the human body’s seven substances—tears, saliva, essence, qi, blood, and so forth—are indispensable for nurturing the illusory body. Yet within the body, form, substance, sound, and color are purely a mass of yin qi, the so-called foul skin bag. Only by cultivating that which is void and without, numinous and refined from the colored body, can one obtain the prenatal within the postnatal. Do not cling rigidly to the elixir field, staring fixedly, using the mind to illuminate. Only the void, seeming and not seeming, neither urgent nor slow, about to depart—this is the true medicine. The Most High said: “The valley spirit never dies; this is called the mysterious gateway.” These few lines exhaust the mysterious gateway’s wondrous aperture. What is the valley spirit never dying? The valley is void, the spirit is numinous, never dying means never darkening. It means that if one wishes to refine the great dao, one must recognize the void and numinous and never-dark true ruler as the elixir’s root. Yet formless and featureless, beyond grasp, thus it says: “To keep the valley spirit long and never die, one must rely on the mysterious gateway to establish the root.” Why must the valley spirit depend on the mysterious gateway? Because the true ruler of void and numinous must be shaped by the mysterious gateway’s form, which is really the limitless. If the mysterious gateway is not established, the embryo breath is not formed; from where then arises the ever-living mechanism? Only when the mundane breath stops does the embryo breath appear. Between opening and closing, this wondrous mechanism is where the human’s numinous awareness arises; the human’s thoughts, knowledge, nature, emotions, and soul all arise from this; even becoming true and sage all begin with this movement of one and stillness of one, establishing the root. Stillness is formless; movement has form. Stillness is not the root of Heaven and Earth; movement is not the root of beings. Only this one out-breath and in-breath is truly the mysterious gateway’s door. Although it has form, it is due to the postnatal yin and yang’s form, which produces the prenatal single true qi. This true qi, though prenatal within postnatal, compared to primordial qi, is still postnatal substance. This primordial qi is not truly existent; it is still the limitless. Yet Heaven and Earth, beings and things all begin from this one aperture. This is perhaps the utmost void giving birth to the utmost solid, the utmost nothing giving birth to the utmost existence. In sum, chaos and formlessness are not difficult; only after awakening must one firmly protect and hold without a single other thought—this is difficult. Do you understand?

### Seven  
The human heart is originally void and lively, illuminating without omission. Only after birth do myriad worries affect the heart, myriad affairs burden the form; movement within shakes the essence, and when essence is insufficient, qi is insufficient, and spirit is thus not numinous. The ancients likened the human body’s essence to oil, qi to fire, and spirit’s numinosity to the lamp’s light radiating in all directions, beyond grasp. Therefore, I teach you the study of refining the heart, beginning with enriching precious essence and abundant qi. Moreover, when this heart is void, the spirit is numinous; when essence is sufficient, qi is vigorous; long before the work is complete and the elixir ripe, the illuminating wisdom light is already present; also able to see through the entanglement of selfish desire and the bonds of affection. The trouble is that the human heart is busy and chasing; just when a bright thought arises, in a moment it plunges back into the armor of desire. For daily livelihood, you must fiercely support your eyebrows and hold high your will, suspending the precious mirror in your body, always hanging the wisdom sword; naturally clarity will be in your person, qi and will like spirit. At this time, Heaven’s principle and human desire naturally distinguish clearly. Heaven’s principle is Heaven’s principle, aroused and able to rise, not allowing human desire to interfere; human desire is human desire, cleansed and pure, not letting Heaven’s principle be violated. In short, the effect is seen in a moment or two, but the merit requires three years and nine years; the power depends entirely on nurturing my wisdom light and forging my wisdom sword. Yet wisdom light is invisible; the ancients said: “In Heaven it is the sun and moon; in humans it is the two eyes,” plainly revealing it. You must collect the spirit light in your eyes during daily life, reflect it back into the elixir field and qi sea; over time, in the empty cave, the wisdom light naturally appears, like a bright mirror hung high, reflecting all things fully. The wisdom sword is also unknowable; the ancients said: “In Heaven it is wind and thunder; in humans it is spirit and qi.” Only because spirit is not condensed and qi not gathered is its edge not sharp. Knowing this is not good conduct, harming essence and qi, yet unable to sever it cleanly, knowingly committing the fault. Looking around my school, this is generally the case—how lamentable! How sad! Now I loudly call out again: restrain lust to consolidate essence, speak little to nurture qi, moderate eating and drinking, thin flavors; idle thoughts and distractions unrelated to body, mind, nature, and life must all be cast away and guarded against with utmost effort. Thus postnatal essence and qi arise easily, and prenatal essence and qi naturally have support. When prenatal essence and qi are full, the body naturally strengthens day by day, and the wisdom sword is formed. Observing you during daytime meditation, those lacking clarity and strength are all because in daily spirit gathering and breath regulating work you are sparse, and in breaks you are many. If you can maintain spirit without dullness in walking, standing, sitting, and lying, breath neither going out nor coming in, sweeping away the nature of temperament and the selfishness of desires, over time you will see a bright spirit shining, illuminating the void; no matter the sounds, wealth, gain or loss, fortune or misfortune, death or life, none can lodge in your heart to disturb your heavenly lord, making your bright heart unclear, your vigor weak. This need not take many years to succeed; only one heart inwardly illuminating, not allowing external dust to disturb your spirit’s mansion even a thread, and instantly you will see the effect of a nimble heart and hand. You must know that the heart’s lack of numinosity comes from spirit’s unclearness; eliminating temperament and emotion requires firm and resolute qi. Qi’s lack of vigor comes from breath’s looseness; to preserve true essence requires full fire. Thus constantly return to observe and illuminate within; day and night the sun and moon turn, Heaven and Earth thus can be overturned. As for external disturbances and insults, you will know at once when they enter your eyes; idle thoughts and worries, you will know as soon as they enter your ears. Not fearing other fires’ scorching and steaming, unstoppable, you can extinguish them forever, with an inconceivable effect.

### Eight  
Students condense spirit and nurture quietly, striving to suppress and transform the gloomy qi of Heaven and Earth within themselves; then they take the place of Heaven and Earth, nurture all things, supplement Heaven and Earth’s imbalance, and fill creation’s gaps—this is not difficult. Yet why do people regard Heaven and Earth as so vast, believing the power of creation belongs solely to the Lord of Heaven, and no one can do anything? They do not consider that the ancient sages often said Heaven, Earth, and humans are the three talents; humans rely on Heaven to live, and Heaven relies on humans to stand. Without a sage to harmonize creation’s power, to assist Heaven and Earth’s transformation, Heaven and Earth would become a chaotic Heaven and Earth, unable to give birth endlessly. Even the common man has this participation; it is not only the lofty and strange who can take it. Why? When the human heart is upright, Heaven and Earth’s heart is upright; when human qi is smooth, Heaven and Earth’s qi is smooth. The resonance between Heaven, Earth, and humans is subtle and wondrous, yet its use lies in a single movement, stillness, word, or silence. Since Heaven and man share one qi, this moves and that moves, this stills and that stills, this is peaceful and that is peaceful. Zhu Xi said: “If my heart is upright, Heaven and Earth’s heart is upright; if my qi is smooth, all things’ qi is smooth.” Without moving a step or turning a thought, one naturally establishes oneself and establishes others, a divine transformation! Because human temperament is constrained and desires cloud the mind, it has long ceased to communicate with Heaven and Earth and all things. So even within one’s own body there is barbarism and chaos; how much more so with the external Heaven and Earth and myriad things? The ancients said: “Heaven and man share one principle; things and self have the same source.” People think this is an empty phrase, but they do not know it is true. Now I explain it again. At the beginning of sitting meditation, one must first nurture spirit. Spirit and the great void are originally one body, but you must not cling rigidly. You must first let the spirit roam in the void so it can be purely nurtured; then the spirit naturally returns to life. Once spirit condenses in the void, you must slowly gather it back into the empty cave, adjust and nurture it. When spirit returns to life, then test the result: is there no thought, reaching utmost emptiness and profound stillness? If you can reach utmost emptiness and profound stillness, nothing at all, this is the study of returning to the root and clarifying the source, and the master stillness is established. Once the master stillness is established, with spirit descending into the water palace, that is spirit entering the qi cavity, also nature controlling emotion, various metaphors abound—none other than my one drop of most numinous, most sacred, most pure, most void primordial spirit descending to combine with the lead in the water palace, like fire entering the water realm. For a while, fire steams water to boil, and true yang is born. The lower field belongs to yin and water; yin and water are both cold in nature. The middle field, the scarlet palace, belongs to yang and fire; fire and yang are both hot in nature. Therefore, the human body’s upper half is Heaven and yang, the lower half Earth and yin; without spirit fire roasting, the water is cold and the metal is cold, sinking and unable to rise, and the person’s dullness grows duller, ignorance deeper. I say spirit entering qi is the dao of water and fire mating. When water and fire unite, the misty vapor surges forth, water-born metal arises, also called silver emerging from lead, also called yang born from yin—these are all metaphors for the human life’s root, truly the foundation of longevity and immortality. At this time, spirit is settled, breath adjusted, body and mind refreshed, soft and joyful, floating as if soaring above the Nine Heavens, wandering the vast realm, with no end in sight. This is spirit united with the great void, qi communicating with Heaven, Earth, and all things, truly unknowable in its cause. This is the master stillness established; there is no such thing as concealing the Heavenly Gang inside but not pushing the Dipper’s handle outside, or pushing the Dipper’s handle outside but not concealing the Heavenly Gang inside. You must know that before the master stillness is established, you may slowly condense spirit to meet qi. When qi and spirit harmonize, then in the obscure and vague realm, transformation produces lead. Indeed, when lead is born, the time comes and the matter arises, the mechanism moves and spirit follows, gently lifting and silently moving, a ball of great harmony qi flowing up and down, like a boat moving with the current. This suffices to prove spirit and qi have gathered, transforming three origins into one origin, uniting five qi into one qi, and establishing the master stillness, so the immortal dao can be cultivated. Have you also once grasped this? My master said: “What is the postnatal prenatal?” The postnatal is all spirit, qi, essence, and blood. This is the fleshly lump; cultivating it to refine the golden elixir is of no use. At the start, condense spirit in the void, unite qi in the vastness. This void and vastness are the postnatal prenatal. I tell you plainly: when sitting in meditation, though not departing from the physical elixir field and the eye’s light, the mind’s light, the breath of mouth and nose, you must be lively and vigorous to return the jade liquid elixir. Why jade liquid? Because the human body’s seven substances—tears, saliva, essence, qi, blood, and so forth—are indispensable for nurturing the illusory body. Yet within the body, form, substance, sound, and color are purely a mass of yin qi, the so-called foul skin bag. Only by cultivating that which is void and without, numinous and refined from the colored body, can one obtain the prenatal within the postnatal. Do not cling rigidly to the elixir field, staring fixedly, using the mind to illuminate. Only the void, seeming and not seeming, neither urgent nor slow, about to depart—this is the true medicine. The Most High said: “The valley spirit never dies; this is called the mysterious gateway.” These few lines exhaust the mysterious gateway’s wondrous aperture. What is the valley spirit never dying? The valley is void, the spirit is numinous, never dying means never darkening. It means that if one wishes to refine the great dao, one must recognize the void and numinous and never-dark true ruler as the elixir’s root. Yet formless and featureless, beyond grasp, thus it says: “To keep the valley spirit long and never die, one must rely on the mysterious gateway to establish the root.” Why must the valley spirit depend on the mysterious gateway? Because the true ruler of void and numinous must be shaped by the mysterious gateway’s form, which is really the limitless. If the mysterious gateway is not established, the embryo breath is not formed; from where then arises the ever-living mechanism? Only when the mundane breath stops does the embryo breath appear. Between opening and closing, this wondrous mechanism is where the human’s numinous awareness arises; the human’s thoughts, knowledge, nature, emotions, and soul all arise from this; even becoming true and sage all begin with this movement of one and stillness of one, establishing the root. Stillness is formless; movement has form. Stillness is not the root of Heaven and Earth; movement is not the root of beings. Only this one out-breath and in-breath is truly the mysterious gateway’s door. Although it has form, it is due to the postnatal yin and yang’s form, which produces the prenatal single true qi. This true qi, though prenatal within postnatal, compared to primordial qi, is still postnatal substance. This primordial qi is not truly existent; it is still the limitless. Yet Heaven and Earth, beings and things all begin from this one aperture. This is perhaps the utmost void giving birth to the utmost solid, the utmost nothing giving birth to the utmost existence. In sum, chaos and formlessness are not difficult; only after awakening must one firmly protect and hold without a single other thought—this is difficult. Do you understand?

### Nine  
The human heart is originally void and lively, illuminating without omission. Only after birth do myriad worries affect the heart, myriad affairs burden the form; movement within shakes the essence, and when essence is insufficient, qi is insufficient, and spirit is thus not numinous. The ancients likened the human body’s essence to oil, qi to fire, and spirit’s numinosity to the lamp’s light radiating in all directions, beyond grasp. Therefore, I teach you the study of refining the heart, beginning with enriching precious essence and abundant qi. Moreover, when this heart is void, the spirit is numinous; when essence is sufficient, qi is vigorous; long before the work is complete and the elixir ripe, the illuminating wisdom light is already present; also able to see through the entanglement of selfish desire and the bonds of affection. The trouble is that the human heart is busy and chasing; just when a bright thought arises, in a moment it plunges back into the armor of desire. For daily livelihood, you must fiercely support your eyebrows and hold high your will, suspending the precious mirror in your body, always hanging the wisdom sword; naturally clarity will be in your person, qi and will like spirit. At this time, Heaven’s principle and human desire naturally distinguish clearly. Heaven’s principle is Heaven’s principle, aroused and able to rise, not allowing human desire to interfere; human desire is human desire, cleansed and pure, not letting Heaven’s principle be violated. In short, the effect is seen in a moment or two, but the merit requires three years and nine years; the power depends entirely on nurturing my wisdom light and forging my wisdom sword. Yet wisdom light is invisible; the ancients said: “In Heaven it is the sun and moon; in humans it is the two eyes,” plainly revealing it. You must collect the spirit light in your eyes during daily life, reflect it back into the elixir field and qi sea; over time, in the empty cave, the wisdom light naturally appears, like a bright mirror hung high, reflecting all things fully. The wisdom sword is also unknowable; the ancients said: “In Heaven it is wind and thunder; in humans it is spirit and qi.” Only because spirit is not condensed and qi not gathered is its edge not sharp. Knowing this is not good conduct, harming essence and qi, yet unable to sever it cleanly, knowingly committing the fault. Looking around my school, this is generally the case—how lamentable! How sad! Now I loudly call out again: restrain lust to consolidate essence, speak little to nurture qi, moderate eating and drinking, thin flavors; idle thoughts and distractions unrelated to body, mind, nature, and life must all be cast away and guarded against with utmost effort. Thus postnatal essence and qi arise easily, and prenatal essence and qi naturally have support. When prenatal essence and qi are full, the body naturally strengthens day by day, and the wisdom sword is formed. Observing you during daytime meditation, those lacking clarity and strength are all because in daily spirit gathering and breath regulating work you are sparse, and in breaks you are many. If you can maintain spirit without dullness in walking, standing, sitting, and lying, breath neither going out nor coming in, sweeping away the nature of temperament and the selfishness of desires, over time you will see a bright spirit shining, illuminating the void; no matter the sounds, wealth, gain or loss, fortune or misfortune, death or life, none can lodge in your heart to disturb your heavenly lord, making your bright heart unclear, your vigor weak. This need not take many years to succeed; only one heart inwardly illuminating, not allowing external dust to disturb your spirit’s mansion even a thread, and instantly you will see the effect of a nimble heart and hand. You must know that the heart’s lack of numinosity comes from spirit’s unclearness; eliminating temperament and emotion requires firm and resolute qi. Qi’s lack of vigor comes from breath’s looseness; to preserve true essence requires full fire. Thus constantly return to observe and illuminate within; day and night the sun and moon turn, Heaven and Earth thus can be overturned. As for external disturbances and insults, you will know at once when they enter your eyes; idle thoughts and worries, you will know as soon as they enter your ears. Not fearing other fires’ scorching and steaming, unstoppable, you can extinguish them forever, with an inconceivable effect.

### Ten  
Students who wish to return to the root and restore the original must begin with postnatal nature and life. The burdens of postnatal temperament and the selfishness of desires must be completely eliminated, only then will true nature and true life appear. What are true nature and true life? The spirit’s flowing and unblocked, without depression or restraint, is true nature. The qi mechanism’s lively and unimpeded, without blockage or hindrance, is true life. These are nothing but spirit and qi. Primordial spirit and primordial qi are the same; mundane spirit and mundane qi are the same, only differing in name, not in substance. The ancient Buddha said: “In the realm of the mundane, consciousness is strong and wisdom weak, so it is called consciousness nature; in the realm of sages, wisdom is strong and consciousness weak, so it is called right awakening.” You must take right awakening, not consciousness spirit, then your start will be correct. Also the ancients said: “The heart is originally without knowledge; because of consciousness it knows. Nature is originally without birth; because of consciousness it is born.” Birth implies death; knowledge implies confusion; birth and death, knowledge and confusion are the seeds of human reincarnation, all caused by postnatal consciousness spirit, not primordial spirit. Primordial spirit is truly empty yet not empty, wondrously existent yet not existent, thus it endures with Heaven and Earth. If you do not know primordial spirit’s deep stillness and eternal brightness, but suspect emptiness and non-attachment, and take the bright and numinous thing in your mind as primordial spirit, forcibly holding it still and binding it so it is not numinous, this is like fighting fire with fire, only causing confusion and error, like a mad monkey or wild horse hard to tame. This all comes from refining postnatal consciousness nature. Jingcen said: “Those who study dao but do not awaken to truth only because they first recognize spirit.” A single thought’s difference leads to falling into beasts; can you not be cautious? Zhu Xi said: “When human desires are completely eliminated, Heaven’s principle flows freely.” Spirit has no moment of discomfort; qi has no moment of blockage; these wondrous heavenly mechanisms, surely you can discern. Yet nothing is more important than Confucius’s saying: “Joy is found within,” “Joy forgets sorrow,” and Zisi’s saying: “Act in your proper place,” “Without entry, no attainment.” The key is to follow Heaven’s movement, act according to nature, fitting your nature, harmonizing with Heaven. If you have awareness, calculation, or contrived action, that is neither nature nor Heaven, but human falsity; even if you talk of mystery and sit in meditation all day, it is no different from the unlearned. Moreover, falsity disturbs truth, only causing mental toil and daily exhaustion, worse than the unlearned who still have a thread of innate truth. Therefore, I teach you first to recognize your original face, which is boundless void, vast and infinite, joy beyond description. Yet your original source is not clear, so the great manifestation is slight. If you can empty all possessions, not a single thought remaining, you need not sit for a full incense stick’s time; you will naturally glimpse the turning light, transcend things, and your body and mind will feel dissolved. But you busy yourself with worldly affairs, day and night calculating wealth, land, and possessions, so when you enter the dao and see virtue you rejoice, when you see worldly splendor you also rejoice, dragging mud and water, unwilling to let go and become empty. Hence after years of study, no great progress appears, only because Heaven’s principle and human desire are separated. I seek from Heaven the immortals; you must abandon worldly wealth. Only those who do not covet wealth truly do not desire wealth; only those who do not desire wealth are truly dao vessels. The human heart, apart from the word “wealth,” has no other source of envy or desire. If you can break this copper wall, leap over this delusion, your heart will be cold as ice, qi flowing like a spring, nature empty as a mirror, spirit calm as a deep abyss—would the great dao not be here? Moreover, what ordinary people like and what sages dislike, all are burdens on heart and nature, obstacles to dao and virtue; the ancients called these “diseases of diseases.” If one can remove these diseases, the true nature appears. Moreover, cultivation of the body is in humans; attainment of the dao is in Heaven. If you can lightly regard wealth and profit, do good deeds, the heavenly spirits will rejoice and protect you. Hence it is said: “Money can communicate with spirits.” It is not that spirits truly love wealth, but because the person has the capacity to carry the dao, to transcend the mundane and enter the sage, and because of lightness toward wealth they love them more, hence this saying. Have you also seen through this?

### Eleven  
When students first sit in meditation, spirit and mind are not refreshed, qi mechanism not smooth, like Heaven and Earth just opening, chaos beginning, all things formless, a hundred fresh images. Only with a single intention concentrated, gathering my spirit and qi into the mysterious aperture, is it like the master of Heaven and Earth standing there. With one exhale, like the light and clear qi of Heaven and Earth rising; one inhale, like the heavy and turbid qi descending; I entrust my will to the void, the master stillness is established. As for yin and yang rising and falling, I only follow their natural up and down movement; when true accumulation is long, it surges vigorously with unstoppable force. Yet at this peak of yang, one must know how to hold fullness and preserve peace, return to root and origin. Otherwise, under flourishing yang, there must be rising yin; to form a pure yang body is difficult. Hence Shaozi said: “Good wine is best after mild intoxication; good flowers are best when half-bloomed.” Who but the wise can understand this? I observe you often, when qi mechanism is strong and spirit bright, still often setting fire and raising smoke, not knowing to return to the origin; if you vent too much, the life mechanism is cut off. Hence the Most High said: “Holding and filling it is not as good as stopping.” Truly a method to follow. As for guarding and waiting, the ancients said: “The true man hides in the deep abyss, floating and wandering guarding the norm.” Thus observe this aperture, strictly guard the norm; in no time, true yang naturally arises from emptiness, the body stands like a wall, the mind like cold ashes; at this time qi mechanism surges and flourishes, yang gives birth to offspring, the time to move the river cart. Previously refining essence was the two phases of gathering Mouni; this birth of yang is the four phases of moving the river cart; each has its scene, not to be mistaken. I further show the matter of sitting meditation practice, known to all, but many are confused about cultivation in movement. Mencius’s nurturing of vast qi arises from gathering righteousness. But the way of gathering righteousness is broad; not only is there righteousness in stillness, but also in movement. When Mencius suddenly saw a child falling into a well, he felt compassion—was this not righteousness? Extending this, respecting elders and sages, benefiting others and things, resolving difficulties and disputes, are these not righteousness? Also seeing goodness in others and admiring it, seeing evil and feeling shame—are these not righteousness? Compassion is benevolence; shame and disgust are righteousness; modesty and respect are propriety; right and wrong, like and dislike are wisdom. These four beginnings arise subtly; many in the world overlook them, even you often miss them. Though you know them, you only understand the goodness of love, the innate nature; when they subtly move, few know to gather them into the elixir field. Now I reveal: from now on, whenever daily emotions arise—joy, anger, sorrow, pleasure—they are all true mechanisms stirring; I must gather and nurture them, turning light back to illuminate. In short, the four beginnings’ first movement, if arising from no thought and no action, is true; if with thought and action, is false. Within a day, these four beginnings arise countless times. If you can seize these moments, gather and take them, feed and consume them, it is like gold everywhere, a hall full of gold and jade; nowhere is not a place for refining the elixir, no time is not a sign of medicine arising. Hence it is said: “The great dao is sought among humans, taken from among the same kind.” Therefore the ancients cultivated dao hidden in the marketplace, not dwelling in mountains and valleys; for dao is in human relations and daily use, not in deep mountains or desolate valleys. If you can know at all times, and take at all times, then the dusty world is everywhere a place where dao mechanisms arise, everywhere a place for cultivation work; only the trouble is that people do not return to themselves to seek it.

Today drought prevails, crops wither, seeming as if all people under Heaven have no way to live. Yet they do not know that within extreme calamity there is extreme blessing; on days of great disaster there is great auspiciousness. If you understand this principle, just cultivate yourself; all the coming good and ill, fortune and retribution, listen to Heaven, and avoid many idle thoughts, worries, and vexations! If Heaven wishes it, who dares to waste it? If Heaven wishes death, who dares to live? This is surely Heaven’s governance, beyond mortal participation. Only do your utmost and listen to Heaven; this is what humans can do. Otherwise, if the power of creation is not settled in its own place, human hearts will become more chaotic, and Heaven’s heart will be more unsettled, hastening the arrival of tribulation. This is the continuous way of Heaven and man; I trust you understand, so I will not elaborate. I only wish you henceforth cultivate your virtue, so you communicate seamlessly with Heaven and Earth, naturally harmonizing with Heaven’s heart; even in barren years, there will be abundant grace and deep kindness. As for cultivation, what is prized is continuity, density, non-duality, and unceasingness, reaching the realm of divine transformation; not haste or impatience. Mencius said: “Those who advance sharply retreat quickly.” Moreover, urgency belongs to mundane fire, not only useless but also dangerous to burn the body. The so-called neither fast nor slow, neither forgetting nor assisting, is the true natural fire. Heaven and Earth give birth to all things; sages nurture all people; all do not depart from this gentle divine fire—how much more so cultivation! The key is constant illumination, never losing the opportunity. I see you often work with starts and stops, so you want to build your hall but go out the door; want to settle in the room but retreat to the hall; never going straight forward without retreat—this is the cause. The ancients said: “Hide spirit in the heart, hide qi in the body,” always not releasing them; then life returns and roots are restored, and the elixir of longevity and immortality is attained. But how can spirit and qi be hidden in body and mind, never lost? The method is: when the mysterious aperture opens, Taiji moves once, yin and yang separate and spread; then you may advance when the time is right, stop when the time is right. Why? When the mysterious aperture first opens, you see the Li palace’s original nature, so it is called “nature yang born.” Yet this is the spirit’s slight movement, not the qi’s true movement; only by spirit fire slowly warming can you nurture it, listening to the qi mechanism’s up and down flow, storing it in the central yellow proper position. This is the method of guarding the center, water and fire balanced, Kan and Li joined; also called the first phase short advance, the two phases gathering Mouni. When spirit fire descends, water sees fire and naturally becomes one qi, misty and vaporous, rising and soaring—this is when water-born metal arises, the ancients said “when yang gives birth to offspring,” also called “life of fate yang.” When there is this qi mechanism movement, it need not fill the whole body inside and out; even a rough qi mechanism is enough. Indeed, from spirit fire descending into the water realm, this is Kan and Li joining to produce medicine, also the micro yang first moving; you must diligently gather and move the river cart, settle spirit in the mud pellet. The so-called “supplement brain and return essence,” the way of longevity is here. Those who desire longevity have no other method than to constantly guard the center and move the river cart without interruption. Though the center fire is only a gentle lead cauldron, the river cart’s reverse movement has the four cardinal directions Zi, Wu, Mao, You, with civil and military distinctions. If you can constantly nurture, letting my primordial spirit always dwell in the heart, primordial qi always hidden in the body, even if death comes, how can it die? Because spirit and qi mate, never losing each other. You must in walking, standing, sitting, and lying, whether busy or idle, with thoughts or without, at tea or meal times, always gather spirit in the heart, collect qi in the body. Over time spirit and qi blend; before you know it, you do not know ancient or present, not knowing Heaven above or Earth below, not knowing self inside or others outside. Such a one is none other than an immortal. Observing your work reaching this, strange signs will appear; now I reveal. If there are strange colors or fragrances, appearing in the eyes, or smelling in the nose, or coming to the ears, do not pay attention. Or if heart flowers suddenly bloom, able to know all past and future good and ill, you must gather the primordial spirit, sit firmly in the middle court. Though occasionally manifesting naturally, a single thought present without deliberation, able to foresee fortune and calamity, this is still consciousness spirit acting; do not give rise to joy. Once joy arises, even if not entering the demon path, you fear self-conceit, and external affairs distract you, stopping cultivation. Not knowing that manifestations often arise from your own old roots and habits being stirred by consciousness spirit, I always ignore them, so that with no mind the manifestations naturally vanish. This is a crucial recent matter; do not envy manifestations and fall into the demon path, recklessly discussing fortune and calamity. These are all caused by your qi habits, not primordial spirit or primordial qi, and cannot be trusted as dao.

### Thirteen  
Zisi said: “It begins with the husband and wife.” What exactly are these husband and wife? Are they like later Confucians say: “Within the boudoir, solemn as the court; intercourse shows propriety, contact shows dao. This one section expanded and fulfilled suffices to transform family, state, and world without difficulty.” Such words belittle the dao, unable to fill and flow so widely and pervasively, for they have form, trace, action, and doing, still limited and measurable; how can they speak of the great dao? This husband and wife are simply one Qian and one Kun within the human body, one Kan and one Li. In sum, it is water and fire, spirit and qi, also nature and life. Nature and life united return to Taiji. Thus Taiji moves and rests, one yin and one yang, everywhere following Heaven. Using this to cultivate oneself, all things are cultivated; using this to govern the world, all things are governed. The key is all spirit and qi return to truth, returning to the original great harmony qi, always embraced. If you only speak of the worldly husband and wife with form and image, even if they raise the tray and bow to each other, respect each other as guests, it is still unlikely to transform family, govern the state, change customs and fashions, and be everywhere and always united with people and Heaven. The sages feared revealing heavenly secrets, unwilling to speak plainly; only when one has accumulated merit and virtue, preserved heart and nature, truly with no flaw in heart and mind, fulfilled all human relations, then breaking through the heavenly secret, they do not recklessly transmit the great dao. When you reach this stage of work, surely you understand that the “beginning husband and wife” are not external husband and wife, but the husband and wife within the human body. If you can begin work, always remember the phrase “beginning husband and wife.” First, with spirit entering qi, it is the mundane father matching the mundane mother. When mundane father and mother unite, true lead is born, true yang emerges. The yang lead born here comes from Kan; yang is the spiritual father. When the qi mechanism is strong and forceful, from the empty dangerous aperture fire arises, ascending to the mud pellet. I then condense spirit in the mud pellet, nurturing yin essence, matching spiritual father with sacred mother, yang lead with yin mercury, yang qi controlling yin essence. This is spiritual father and sacred mother mating to produce medicine. The medicine is none other than the yin essence accumulated long in the mud pellet, roasted by spirit fire, transforming into sweet dew and numinous water—this is the spiritual fluid. From the spiritual fluid descending, the spiritual nature and spiritual knowledge in the heart arise; this is called qi transforming into liquid. Then introducing it into the elixir field, Qian and Kun recombine, roasting again with spirit fire; the spiritual fluid transforms again into true qi, circulating the river cart, sifting and refining a thousand times. The qi transformed from spiritual fluid is the prenatal Qian yuan one qi. From this one movement, external medicine is born, fire arises from the Kun furnace, ascending to Qian’s head as the cauldron, descending to Kun’s belly as the furnace. The furnace lights fire, the cauldron cooks medicine. From this one movement and one stillness, if the timing is not lost, it is like stubborn metal long roasted, the more refined the purer, called “a hundred times refining diamond turning into soft silk.” Thus external medicine is taken to form the internal elixir; after long time external elixir forms, internal elixir also follows. In sum, external elixir values firmness, then wood carries metal, fire forces water upward. Without this, metal sinks without rising, water cold without boiling. Internal elixir values softness; without softness the elixir does not form, and primordial spirit cannot sit and illuminate freely. This is Qian’s firmness and Kun’s softness, the way of Zisi’s “beginning husband and wife.” If one truly begins from one yin and one yang, not clinging to purity and non-action, not obsessed with names, images, actions, and doing, within a hundred days one can build the foundation.

### Fourteen  
The great dao originally has no marvels; it is only perfecting my original nature. How can original nature be a thing? It is nothing but natural Heaven. But why do many know and few attain? Because since birth, humans have been imprisoned by the selfishness of blood and qi, then confused by the burden of emotions and desires, making it especially difficult to see the original nature. Yet it is not difficult; if one can know each thought is false, seek truth in all matters, this mind is clear and bright, utterly without anything in between. The Buddhists call this “no good no evil, only seeing the empty, hollow, clear, and numinous true ruler,” which is the dao. How difficult can it be? The Book says: “To not think is madness; to overcome thought is saintliness.” It is only a matter of reverence, and nature returns to its truth, dao returns to its root. If you understand, I will not elaborate. As for the birth of true nature, it is but a moment; yet at the moment of arising, chaos and muddle, no dregs, no thoughts or worries, few recognize the true ones among sages, immortals, and Buddhas. Even if recognized, at this first budding moment it is like clothes soiled by oil for a long time; without thorough washing, it cannot be removed in a day. Yan Zi obtained one good, so he had the work of earnest remembrance. You have already understood one thought’s turning back, one thought is dao, every thought returns to root, every thought is true. The first requirement is a firm and enduring heart, so you can reach the clear and pure, seeing the true meaning alone. Yet one thought’s illumination is easy. I see modern cultivators, at this first thought’s arising, originally pure and complete, round and full, yet doubting if it is the dao, adding a thought, adding a view, mixing them in, so true nature becomes confused. If you can recognize this one thought’s movement as the thing by which you become immortal and sage, then the Most High Three Pure Ones’ divine wonders are no other skill, only the accumulation of this one thought’s occasional sprouting day by day. But at the start, the natural movement of heavenly nature and the occasional arising of qi mechanism are only faint traces, not great manifestations. My teaching calls this “small medicine birth,” also called “primal yang first moving.” When you pass the gate, take and nurture, though the elixir field is hot, kidneys simmered, eyes have golden light, mouth has strange taste, ears have vulture cries, brain has qi arising, six kinds of effects, yet no form attached to the postnatal corpse qi to manifest clearly; truly no vast qi of utmost firmness and greatness filling between the two poles. This is a virtual image, all known by my spirit and mind, not for outsiders to see. My teaching calls this “great movement of primal yang,” also “great medicine arising.” Because it can be compared to reality, it is called primal yang; because its qi mechanism is great, unlike previous faint movement, it is called great medicine. If you recognize this, you will not mistakenly move mundane fire, go the wrong way, and be harmed by postnatal corpse filth qi. The key is to take prenatal to supplement postnatal; what taking, what supplement? Only the movement of one yang, not recklessly acting, not leaking outside; over time one qi steams and burns, the steaming qi is medicine, the fire is medicine, outside and inside, below and above, reversed and gathered, this is taking. Gathering this back into the furnace is returning and supplementing. Fire is medicine, medicine is fire; fire and medicine are two yet one. Knowing this great harmony one qi, without a single idle thought or distraction, only seeing emptiness and clarity, vast and without outside, small and without inside, subtle qi mechanism seeming to be and not to be, seeming not to be and not not to be—this is dao. With this one qi steaming and burning, it is medicine. Gather this spirit and qi, allowing no mixture of partial understanding, then it is supplementing. Since ancient times immortals have cultivated this, truly not to be ignored by cultivators. As for breath, it is the key task in refining medicine and elixir. Without this internal breath, how can true gold at the water’s bottom rise from below and from outside to inside? It all depends on this spirit breath driving and urging it, ascending to the mud pellet. When spirit and qi mate, descending to the Yellow Court, nurturing to form the elixir, all is done by spirit breath. Hence the ancients said spirit breath is the outer fire. Though cultivators obtain the natural true fire, they must rely on outer fire to draw and add civil and military, increase and decrease its use, then medicine arises naturally and elixir can be expected. Without outer furnace fire to regulate civil and military, though natural true fire is void and numinous and penetrating, it can only understand nature, not establish life. These inner and outer fires are the fires of nature and life. If one has inner fire but no outer fire, nature cannot cling to life, life cannot cling to nature; this is called solitary yin not born, solitary yang not growing. Lüzu said: “Trust death in purity; solitary yang cannot ascend.” Thus inner fire and inner elixir depend entirely on outer elixir and outer fire to be formed. Spirit breath is the key path of cultivation. You know the inner and outer fires’ way, yet I see your misunderstanding of outer fire’s reverse use. Mundane breath and true breath are one and the same. Without prenatal spirit breath, mundane breath has no master; without postnatal mundane breath, true breath has no self to arise. But reversing creation, turning inner cultivation upside down, the golden elixir reverses back inside—this is an urgent matter.

### Fifteen  
The reason humans can know past and future, be numinous and undarkened, is none other than this one illuminating heart. Buddha calls it the “everlasting lamp,” Dao calls it the “mysterious gateway aperture,” Confucians call it the “void numinous treasury.” All are a no-thought, no-worry, no-good, no-evil, one illuminating spirit. At the start, if you do not seek to bring forth the boundless void and limitless things, then there is no nature, no elixir root. If you do not nurture from the void a numinous, wondrous, illuminating spirit that penetrates inside and out, there is no master. Without a master, even if you diligently practice day and night, you remain confused and dazed, ending with no use. You must first put down all attachments, slowly stirring the wind and fire of deluded knowing and selfish desire, roasting them in the land of non-being. Your inner illumination is truly unstained, unbound, empty and vast, unaware of beginning or end—this is seeing original nature. Once original nature is seen, you must have an awakening heart, illuminating but not illuminating, not illuminating but illuminating—this is the master always present. The ancients called this the master and owner. With this master, refining the elixir can succeed; without it, it is like a family without a master, how can the household rise? This master is truly the commander of refining the elixir. As for original nature, it is the elixir’s head. But at first, if you want original nature to manifest, it is boundless chaos, vast and infinite, utterly beyond measure. Only a calm and untroubled heart, cool and refreshing, with some interest, suffices. If you want it bright and clear, vast and deep, with no outside and no inside, then when the fire timing is ripe, there will be this vast and obscure, unfathomable sign. Only if you are not touched or stuck by worldly dust, can you push open and let go; this is seeing nature, the root of refining the elixir. At the start, this heart may not immediately submit or illuminate like spirit. Just so long as this heart does not wander or become confused, can be my master, not taken away by external things, this heart is always present, the master for my refining the elixir. At this time you are still at the yin-yang junction, you must establish willpower, support true yang, suppress the many yin; over time yang wants to advance but cannot rush, yin wants to retreat but does not want to rush; thus there is a state like drunkenness and stupor. Though yang can govern, yin has not yet yielded. Therefore I teach you not to eliminate thought or suppress breath too tightly; tightness stirs postnatal yin qi, which cannot endure long. In sum, the immortals’ wondrous and unpredictable transformations are none other than this one point of void stillness, the spirit of response acting as master! When you have nothing to do, do not seek vast chaos; just this one thought of void stillness, do not mind the second thought; this is nature present. The ancients gathered and released, released and gathered—many have seen nature. With long practice, original nature is always complete, nowhere and everywhere. So long as this heart always illuminates, with slight idle thoughts, you can always awaken and illuminate, thus always alert. Since ancient times immortals have been made by this one point of illuminating heart; do not lightly regard this illumination. I recall your sincere hearts seeking dao; now I explain the origin of dao, the starting work, to prevent heart and nature’s confusion, so you may speak of the elixir.

My master has taught here for more than ten years; now before the gate peach and plum branches compete in bloom, truly not wasted my toil. Yet among disciples not all are the same; some have realized the root of the great dao, leapt out of the red dust, ascended to the pure and numinous mansion; my master thus comes and goes, never weary. From then on, deep study brings gain, everywhere joyous and free, how can it be compared to depression and sorrow? No matter how much gold piles to the Northern Dipper, fame in the Eastern Kingdom, there is no moment of leisure; what is there to cling to in the mortal world? Especially those who busy day and night, ceaselessly, incessantly, can they long enjoy glory and longevity? Even if so, time flies like an arrow, sun and moon like a shuttle; in a blink, black hair turns white, youth becomes old age, fleeting time cannot wait; once impermanence arrives, all is empty, how tragic to waste spirit and toil in vain! Though one speaks of founding a lineage, upholding ancestral teachings, enriching descendants, and leaving a bright legacy for ten thousand years, still there is a way of going with the flow, letting come and go; I only steer the rudder, why labor over myriad affairs, exhausting all your spirit on family, children, fields, houses, gold, and silver, unwilling to rest? Suppose one day you go west, leaving nothing behind, is it not a pity? The ancients said: “In the black lacquer coffin, wealth cannot hold a bit; on the road to the yellow springs, who belongs to wife and children?” Is this not fearful? Worse, some commit great sins in life, building family and career, only to have their souls perish in the courts of hell, punished in the underworld prison; their descendants enjoy endless glory, while ancestors suffer in muddy torment—who will make offerings to save them? The suffering is mine to bear; the blessings theirs to enjoy; is this fair? Worse, unworthy descendants do not think of the ancestors’ toil and hardship, making plans for the future; they say old times are different, they gamble and smoke, boast and squander, indulge in flowers and wine, and when warned by elders, resent the nagging and refuse to see them. Some once favored now insult, daring to be enemies to parents, standing against them. The saying goes: “Children under the knees all become enemies,” truly not empty words. From this you see, if you plan for descendants, but descendants are like this, is it worth it? Also, stingy families do not last; the saying goes: “Father is a money stringer, son turns money into furnace.” No matter how much gold piled, how many lands owned, when in descendants’ hands, all is squandered; is it not a waste of family planning and mental effort? Worse, immediate disgrace and retribution: ancestors buy land, accounts not yet cleared, descendants sell it; ancestors build a home, work unfinished, suddenly it belongs to another. The Book says: “As if dead, others enter the house,” also: “The magpie has a nest, the dove dwells there.” After death no news is good enough; if seen now, how painful! Knowing this, you understand the world’s clothing and food, each person has their destined place; do not toil and fret. Even if plans fail, or wishes come true, it is fate’s decree, even without seeking it can be obtained. Seeing this, why not act according to Heaven’s principle, follow human feelings, be content and keep to your place? Moreover, Heaven’s decree surpasses humans; humans can also surpass Heaven. Rather than gain by injustice and incur Heaven’s punishment, why not do many good deeds and ascend to Heaven? If one can treasure only goodness, and the human heart aligns with Heaven’s heart, will Heaven not protect life? Doing good brings blessings, surely not mistaken. Today in leisure I again plan for you. All worldly affairs end in emptiness. Only cultivating nature and life together is my everlasting work of ten thousand years. Do not speak of worldly wealth and honor, hard to compare to pure emptiness and carefree freedom; even what you have now, what you daily need, are all heavy and turbid things; how distant from the heavenly frost and scarlet snow, the celestial peaches and fine wines, all fragrant and pure. One pure, one turbid—how far apart! Moreover, needs are few, enjoyments few; why cling so tightly, staining my bright spirit with filth and shame? Is it not betraying heart and effort? Alas, today’s world is dark and unclear, confused and unawakened, so firm and unbreakable; this is the worst. Worse, many knowingly offend again. Alas! Truly lamentable! I previously showed you the way to nurture right qi and dispel guest qi; this is truly a good remedy for the mundane, a marvelous elixir to return Heaven. Why? Because people unwilling to turn back are either ignorant of dao and virtue or weaken their essence and qi. Even if you know it is marvelous and cannot be exchanged for a bit, you still drag mud and water, unable to sever karmic ties, soaring to the clouds; how much more so outsiders? For now, you must first set your will, nurture your spirit; no matter how thorny the path, it is not hard to sever in one stroke, sorting out desires frequently. Mencius’s nurturing qi teachings appear repeatedly, not fearing trouble. If you can be resolute and firm, not fearing a thousand hardships, it is not hard to reach the pure void. Recently your work is the battle between Heaven and man, principle and desire contending; if you do not strive, it is like clam and snipe locked in combat, unable to win. Take this opportunity; only one or two months, nurture Heaven’s principle pure, dispel guest qi, destroy all emotions; then Heaven’s virtue flows freely, everywhere naturally attained. You have talent and insight, courage and breadth; rather than spend it on useless places, why not use it on the great dao? You must strive; I deeply hope so.

The great path of true cultivation requires first understanding order. When entering the gate, one is like a wild horse or mad monkey, hard to restrain; if forced to conform, one surely takes in evil fire, not only blocking life mechanism but true qi burned by evil fire; though not ill, life qi is scattered. The ancients said: “Refining lead in the dusty world.” One must respond to affairs when they arise, nurture the heart when none arise; over time see through the red dust, open the net of karma; then the heart is calm, the spirit clear. If only chasing dust and waves, one will be more and more stained, until nature and life perish. Only by constantly raising awareness and awakening, enduring hardship and never tiring, can spirit and qi be united as one. Yet some foolish ones do not speak of inner virtue or outer merit; because affairs do not go well or family difficulties, they want to abandon human relations and enter the mountains to cultivate. Such people are full of filth and evil fire; their harm to body and mind is not small! I in earlier years did not abandon my master, with a humble heart sought instruction, was taught to accumulate yin merit, avoid dust realms, and meditate in free time. But your worldly feelings are too heavy, fame and profit entangle you; children and affection hard to sever; daily busy and chasing, unknowingly trapped in fame and profit’s reins. Do you know life and death are fate, wealth and honor Heaven’s decree? Do you truly believe this? As for your preaching and teaching, I am not equal; but the wise do not speak, those who speak do not know. My words are like Confucius receiving the Most High’s words: “Your words show the man and bones are rotten, only the words remain.” The ancients said: “Speaking ten thousand things is not as good as doing half a point.” But to achieve the great dao, your desires must be empty, utterly useless; better to start low and go deep. Mencius said: “The dao is near but sought far; the matter is easy but sought hard.” You must urgently guard this. Moreover, though spirit is strong, your years advance; if you do not diligently cultivate, I fear lead and mercury will daily diminish, and later when you sit to gather heart, you will not be able. As for your recent work, only refine life in stillness, nurture nature in movement; do not hasten to seek deep mountains. The Awakening Truth says: “I urge you to cultivate dao, do not enter mountains; inside and outside the mountains there is no lead; such precious treasures are in every home, only fools do not fully know.” Do you believe this? Your wisdom and insight are not from one kalpa’s cultivation, but from past lives’ accumulation; truly a vessel carrying the dao. Moreover, among my disciples, few can see the great dao. Alas, knowing ten zhang is not as good as doing one inch; truly starting work with gain to body and mind is rare. Now I reveal to you: what is explained and comprehended by others is truly within and beyond form; for you it is a great demon; if not all blocked, I fear daily practice deepens self-pleasure, and your heart’s blood is lost to this memory demon. My master never speaks of length or shortness, rank or status; only considering seeking the great dao, enduring hardship for years, yet only becoming a catchphrase, no different from today’s monks’ shouts and sharp words. What a pity to waste spirit on memory and learning. You have this wisdom and insight; with it, progress on the path is unblocked, attainment is not difficult, unlike others’ confusion, running here and there, not knowing the great road. So I do not abandon you, thus speak plainly to warn. You say your will is to accumulate merit and practice benevolence, yet also know establishing merit and virtue is not by seeking others to establish. The saying goes: “If fate meets, you meet; if fate misses, you miss.” The sage’s dao is the middle way. The middle way is to follow nature. If you must establish merit, going everywhere to do good deeds, it is your own good deeds causing trouble, not the sage’s dao. Many immortals in history have closed their doors and never left, yet with a word or deed they ascend to Heaven; this shows merit is not in quantity but in one heart. If one’s heart is always on dao, above and below flows with Heaven and Earth; you may know why. Every word I say is a golden needle; you must embody it.

Heaven and Earth is an empty shell, containing a ball of primordial qi, nurturing all things, only following the qi mechanism’s norm, wandering and muddled, unaware and unknown, so it is immortal for billions of years. The human body contains a segment of misty vapor qi; why is it not as long-lasting as Heaven and Earth? Because the seven emotions and six desires daily destroy it, prenatal primordial qi is obscured and dissipated by postnatal mundane qi; thus there is birth, aging, sickness, death, and suffering. Yet Heaven’s qi moves all things unevenly; without sun and moon, it would not work. Sun and moon are Heaven and Earth’s function; thus one comes and goes, cold and heat alternate, forming the year. The human body’s qi mechanism acts as myriad beings, assisting Heaven and Earth; without embryo breath it cannot stand. Therefore Heaven and Earth are the city walls of humans; sun and moon are the embryo breath of humans. Heaven and Earth’s yin and yang moving creates transformation, all by sun and moon moving within. If humans can emulate Heaven and Earth, using the spirit breath of respiration to move within, continuous, dense, quiet, and alert, they can also be long-lasting and boundless, standing alongside Heaven and Earth. The Awakening Truth says: “Establish furnace and cauldron as Heaven and Earth, roast essence and refine soul and spirit,” also: “First make Heaven and Earth the cauldron and vessel, then knead the black rabbit medicine to cook.” The black rabbit medicine is the yin in Li and the yang in Kan. True yin and true yang combine to form essence qi, which is medicine, able to subdue the postnatal soul and spirit, returning them to Taiji. The great immortal medicine is this one flavor. In sum, there is medicine of nature and medicine of life. What is medicine born of nature? It is the vague and indistinct; it must not come from nothing to something externally. Confucius said: “Joy is found within.” If humans guard the center with some joy, the medicine sprout is tender and fresh, just right to harvest and take. What is medicine of body and life? It is the essence in the obscure realm; the movement of this essence has great evidence: the elixir field has a misty vapor image, movement mechanism, or flowing through the whole body, vast and full, truly penetrating everywhere, no hole unpierced, no aperture unreachable—this is life’s yang birth. For beginners, it need not be so strong; just enough to stretch the body that cannot stretch, just enough to bring slight joy to the heart that cannot rejoice, then it can be taken. All things in the world have vitality when young, few when old and strong; hence alchemists take tender, not old; old means qi disperses and is unusable. If you obtain new tender medicine qi, old diseases naturally vanish. The Most High also said: “Its essence is very true, within is faith.” Thus essence birth and medicine production have true efficacy. If you say the talisman’s faith is utmost, surging like tides, melting like ice thawing, this is still a rough layer of manifestation. Only when obtaining true essence and true medicine, void yet numinous, numinous yet truly void, like Heaven and Earth knowing no beginning or end, sun and moon without interruption, its void is utmost limitless, its measure beyond reckoning, called “uniting with Heaven and Earth’s virtue, shining with sun and moon”—this is it. You must strive. The breath mechanism governs stillness; few desires calm the spirit; this suffices to match Heaven and Earth.

### Nineteen  
I reveal to you: to attain the dao’s marvel, you must be chaos and muddle, still and still again; only then is it the one ball of Taiji before father and mother are born. This chaos is the primordial qi before differentiation, the original qi before Heaven and Earth’s separation. The human body is formed by qi, sensing the true of the limitless, the essence of two and five, wondrously combined and condensed; the Qian dao forms the male, the Kun dao forms the female. This is before the four great elements separate and the Five Phases appear, a complete chaos of primordial qi. If a person has this, they live; without it, they die. This is the first wondrous mechanism of cultivating dao, not to be neglected. Yet in chaos, without a master, one falls into stubborn emptiness, becoming confused and dim. Cultivators, when mixing the Five Phases into one qi, must take the primordial spirit as master; then the dao qi condenses constantly and the golden elixir can be refined. Is this far away? At a thought it appears; open your eyes and it is clear; no matter time or place, encountering normal or change, dao qi exists within; only fear not settling still. Before it arises, do not turn light back to illuminate, protecting the odorless and soundless spirit source. When it arises, do not fail to concentrate qi and spirit, holding and preserving the unknown heavenly virtue. Thus before arising, one is confused and like asleep; where is the deep stillness? When arising, one is bright and active, liking movement but unable to harmonize. Thus letting qi roam freely, following selfish desires’ disturbances, completely covering the original perfect body, disappearing and lost. Alas! The principle of life is gone; where can life mechanism be? To avoid falling into the cattle intestines, horse bellies, birds, beasts, and plants is impossible! This dao is always present in the human body, everywhere and always. Only one primordial spirit constantly illuminating to protect its innate Heaven is cultivating dao and refining elixir. Yet the way of perfect central harmony is often wasted by distractions. For those not cultivating, it matters not. Often people enter the dao gate, say they cultivate and refine, often seeing the source in stillness, condensing dao flavor; but when affairs come, the heart is disturbed and dao disappears. Many are like this. This is only knowing the way in stillness, not knowing that movement is also dao; thus stillness remains but movement scatters. I recall your sincere hearts seeking dao, revealing the heavenly secret in movement, so you know everywhere is dao, nowhere is not the great dao. It is only when one understands this dao that one gains in daily use and myriad affairs; at first barely supporting, over time birds, fish, flowers, and trees all become transformation mechanisms. Why? The ancients said: “Dangerous is the battlefield; trivial are oil, salt, firewood, and rice; knowing dao, everywhere is dao mechanism.” For example, when meeting parents be filial, meeting brothers be respectful, no thought before, no memory after, acting from the heart, not knowing if it is filial or fraternal, not calculating benefit or merit, this is Heaven’s goodness bursting forth suddenly. Mundane people do not know how to preserve and nurture this; often at a thought it is, in a turn of thought scattered by wandering thoughts. Nurturing has no other method; all must be just right, acting most appropriately, no joy, no worry, no liking, no dislike, simply following Heaven and Earth’s nature, letting all things find their place. You must act according to principle, listen to Heaven and accept fate.

### Twenty  
Previously I showed the method of refining nature in movement, with heavenly secrets bursting forth everywhere and always. The key is to always move and always illuminate, suddenly arise spirit to do a work, not wasting time. Thus no day is wasted, heart has leisure, marvelous meanings arise, nowhere is not dao, nowhere is not cultivation. Someone may say: heavenly secret arises like Mencius suddenly seeing a child falling into a well, how many times a day? Must wait for this mechanism to arise, then gather and refine it; then idle times are many; how can there be no interruption? You do not know Mencius’s act is only one aspect; among many affairs, big or small, for self or others, all have no thought before, no memory after, acting from the heart, using things to act; this is the ancient saying: “No mind mind is dao mind,” “When mind arrives, nowhere to seek.” If students can act in all mundane affairs and in stillness with no affairs, using the turning light and returning illumination method, seeing no
