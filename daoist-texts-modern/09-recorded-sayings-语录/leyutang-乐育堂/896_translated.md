## Record of the Joyous Nurturing Hall, Volume Five (Thirty-One Passages)

### One  
Though the work of destiny lies within one’s nature, yet to transcend the womb and become a sage, manifesting countless myriad incarnations across ancient and present times, spanning Heaven and Earth, there lies within this a distinct layer of cultivation. If one follows the later Confucian teaching, it is said only to exhaust nature, and beyond that, there is no further learning. But have they not pondered the *Yijing* which states: “Exhaust principle and nature, to reach destiny”? Clearly, there are three layers of cultivation, not merely exhausting nature to reach destiny. If exhausting nature alone sufficed, then why did Confucius say “to reach destiny” with those four words? This shows that after exhausting nature, there is clearly the work of establishing destiny from nature. What is this work? It is said: “Nature may be attained by awakening; destiny must be transmitted by others.” It is not that it is not taught, but because most people covet destiny’s treasure, neglecting effort on nature, destiny, and ethical relations, the great root remains unestablished, and seeking proof of spirit and immortality becomes difficult. Moreover, even if one becomes an immortal, the celestial splendor above surpasses that of the human world; if the ground of nature is unsettled, seeing wealth arouses greed, seeing beauty stirs lust, and one ultimately falls into hell. It is like building a nine-storied tower in empty space—impossible to attain. Furthermore, if the study of human nature has not matured, the essence, qi, and spirit refined from private desires are all postnatal impurities, not only useless but certain to be consumed by evil fire. Therefore, the immortals do not lightly reveal to people; only when one’s three thousand merits and eight hundred practices are complete do they speak of mystery and method. Moreover, who among past and present has no faults, no grievances? Without abundant merit and virtue, karmic debts are hard to dissolve, and many obstructions arise within. When these obstructions come, the ignorant blame our Way as false, and thus the heavenly deities punish, which greatly hinders later cultivators. Hence, my teaching always begins with cultivating merit and virtue before imparting secret formulas. Those who study my Way often grasp the opportunity, but must clearly understand prenatal qi and postnatal qi. What is postnatal qi? It is the tangible qi inhaled and exhaled through the mouth and nose. As for prenatal qi, though it has no form or sound to compare with, it pervades inside and outside the body, vague and indistinct, neither moving nor still. The reason it is called movement is only because of the postnatal breath’s rising and falling, giving the sensation of stirring. Does prenatal qi truly move? I fear students do not understand that prenatal qi has no movement or stillness; when spirit is tranquil and qi harmonized, it should return to the furnace, sealed and nurtured, yet they still cause it to rise and fall. Like water which is originally still, but the wind’s agitation never ceases, there is never a state of clear calm. Those who grasp this principle will not only stop movement of this primal qi when breath is held, but even when breathing continues, will keep this true qi condensed. Only then will the continuous vaporous flow brew and preserve it, making transformation of essence, qi, and spirit easy. When people eat the flavors of the five grains, if there is stagnation and failure to transform, it is due to middle qi weakness; doctors prescribe pungent and warm medicines to fully digest it. Could it be that one’s own vaporous qi, constantly gathered within, still fails to transform essence, qi, and spirit? Students only need to turn the light inward, gather their primal and mundane qi into the mysterious single cavity, and over time will have inexhaustible wondrous use. How could this be merely physical health or longevity to become an immortal? It is said: “One kalpa of human life, ten thousand kalpas hard to be born again.” How can one be negligent?

### Two  
I point out the three stages of the mysterious gate, the female portal, and the Yellow Court, precisely so students may know how to condense the spirit that is neither existent nor nonexistent, to regulate the breath that is neither internal nor external, thus attaining the purest, cleanest, most natural spirit-breath. Spirit and breath are one, inseparable; how can there be division or union? All is pure and tranquil, so what is existence or nonexistence? Previously, I did not clearly distinguish because beginners had not yet understood; suddenly showing this would be like a woman who has not received a man’s true essence to unite—though blood qi gathers in the womb, at the monthly period it still turns into impurity. Recently, students have grasped the pure spirit-breath, drawing this yang from the female portal of the Kan palace, like a woman receiving a man’s true essence to form a unity; after ten months the fetus is full, a child is born, no different from parents. This is refining the pure spirit-breath into a void transformation body. If one clings stubbornly to a single blood essence, can it birth a void spirit? Therefore, I teach students first to cease thoughts, so that a single bright spirit shines clearly, reaching its source; soon, like a young child, yang qi steams and grows daily and monthly, their spirit vigorous without end. Do not say true yang is like a thing with form or that the dantian truly has a place. Though ancients called it the sea of qi, the ancestral cavity, root of Heaven and Earth, gateway of the mysterious female, it has a name but no reality; yet it cannot be said to be entirely unreal. It is considered void, yet all transformations arise from it; considered real, no object can be found. Over time, the dantian stage becomes elusive, seeming to hover in empty space. Yet one cannot chase it endlessly in the void. This boundary is hard to express in words; students must comprehend it themselves. Today’s learners, not yet diligent, seek quick results; once diligent, they desire immortality. Such hearts are a tangle of private desires; private desires are yin dregs—how can one refine yin dregs to become formless, imageless yang spirit? Impossible. My master once said: the flesh-and-blood body is originally postnatal dregs; the great Way is not here. But if essence is insufficient, where is qi? If qi is insufficient, where is spirit strong? If spirit is not yet strong, how can it unite with the void Way and become a natural immortal? I teach people to begin by consolidating essence. The way to consolidate essence is not only about restraining lust. Moderating food and drink, lightening flavors, harmonizing organs, fluids, blood, sweat; in all actions, guarding and nurturing so essence does not leak outward, then qi will be sufficient. Yet even so, do not say it is enough. Mencius’s chapter on nourishing qi, the parable of Niushan, teaches that by grasping and guarding the morning qi, over time one will have vast, strong qi filling between the eyebrows. Without deep nurturing, how can qi be strong? Also, know this is the way of internal nourishment; externally, one must constantly guard sight, hearing, speech, and movement, avoiding even a moment of impropriety or excess. Thus controlling the outside to nourish the inside, and from inside to reach outside. Ancient loyal ministers and filial sons who died for their cause knew only where righteousness lay and counted nothing beyond it. Though their righteousness was full, in truth it was empty. The true substance of righteousness is qi. Without deep cultivation, how could there be vast qi soaring to the heavens, a loyal heart piercing the sun, like Yue Wumu, Wen Wenshan, Jin Zhengsheng and other martyrs? They did not fear death but saw the principle clearly and nurtured sufficient qi, so they viewed life and death as one. Students, do not say postnatal essence and qi have nothing to do with prenatal; know that nurturing postnatal is precisely cultivating prenatal. Only fearing that one knows roughly the physical body but does not cleanse all, becoming a useless shell. Truly lamentable.

### Three  
Do not say that utmost sincerity and exhausting nature to exhaust the nature of all beings, or participating in transformation and nurturing, lies outside speech, silence, movement, stillness, or daily actions; rather, there is a divine marvel. Know that utmost evenness and constancy is utmost spirit and wonder. Students only need to exhaust what is within themselves, act with strong forgiveness, and all Heaven, Earth, and myriad things are within me. Everyone should carefully ponder this—yes or no? If one truly knows this mystery, nurturing the origin by day, suddenly becoming vague and indistinct, clear and bright, then the vaporous mingling of two qi, the silent turning of one origin, truly exists not outside Heaven and Earth but within me. This is utmost sincerity without rest, serene without ceasing, non-dual in things, giving birth to the unmeasurable. Do not be lazy or complacent, neglecting the free Heaven and suddenly darkening or blocking it, causing external Heaven and Earth and beings to become unsettled. The method of alchemical refinement is no different from refining natural medicine to form natural elixir. Ancients used metaphor and analogy only to imagine the medicine becoming elixir light, spirit brightening, will clear; roughly like this, but not truly so. Students must understand well. Observe Heaven and Earth, clear and empty as one qi; though clouds and mists cross, wind and thunder roar, what sound or color truly exists? Human cultivation is only to imitate Heaven and Earth’s methods and images, follow nature’s spontaneity—what scenes are there? To say there is a real object spanning within is but dust and karma arising later, not our original face, silent and pure. Students must not mistake illusion for reality, falsehood for truth, just as Heaven and Earth do not take clear emptiness as real but take clouds and mists as Heaven—how great the error! My master fears students do not awaken: the bright moon in water, the ephemeral flower in a mirror, though real and unreal, are but illusions; if one carves a mark on a boat to seek a sword in the water, how few are not led astray by demons! If one deeply cultivates and attains, not only do all influences vanish, form and sound perish, even the so-called void one qi disappears. Otherwise, once attached, knowledge is limited; once formed, limits exist; one cannot transcend having and not having, myriad transformations beyond measure. Think: the wondrous myriad things, nature communicating with all things—is it not a single void primordial spirit that has no fixed place or form, yet truly embraces Heaven and Earth beyond great and dust within small? If it is traces and images, it cannot move here or there; if knowledge, grasping half cannot know the whole. I wish students to momentarily flash the spirit of emptiness and clarity in their hearts, not letting it scatter outward, quickly gather and store it inside, long simmer and refine, naturally transforming body and bone. All else with form and color is postnatal dregs; even if stirred, cannot be reasoned with. One must warm with spirit fire, transforming postnatal coarse essence and qi into prenatal primal essence and primal qi. Otherwise, not only can the elixir not be formed, but these various forms will chase my primordial spirit outside for years and years, the master never returned—how can one assert mastery and gain the true lord of Heaven and Earth? This principle is clear, no room for excess.

### Four  
Students have heard my teachings for more than one day. “Lead and tin from the water village, all one flavor.” Can you grasp this secret? I think these two words already contain the subtlety of beginning and end cultivation to form the elixir embryo. When students first begin, mundane mind is too heavy, mundane fire too strong; thus all dust emotions and scenes, do not say they fail to come, the fiery nature is burning, whether sought or attained, it is infatuation, attachment, worry, joy, fear of gain and loss, endless cycles, ultimately blocking one’s pure spirit. Students must see through these dust and scenes as laborious weeds, fleeting illusions, not minding them; gain is from Heaven, loss is from Heaven, having and not having are so; not allowing a single thread or fragment to disturb my spirit mansion or add heat and vexation, then a cool powder is applied, curing future heat symptoms. If not decisively severed, lingering attachments cause vexation in my spirit mansion. One must seek the cool cave, move the whole household there, sit peacefully, never go out wandering, seek a comfortable nest, find convenience, and after a long time suddenly become clear—another world appears, like roaming the ancient reign of Emperor Xi, or entering the Peach Blossom Garden; the joy therein is truly hard to tell outsiders. This is the cool medicine for dispelling vexation. When passion is at its height, body and mind unbearable, like boiling soup, churning cauldron, sea tide rising to the sky, vexation is most severe; letting it be is hard, stirring it up causes change—what method then? The military calls it slow attack and weak capture, using softness to overcome hardness, yielding to capture—this can be learned. At this time, retreat to the Cool Mountain, let go of the whole body. Still fearing the fire’s fierce steaming, impossible to stop, if taken inside, it will burn away all that is in my spirit mansion. Only by learning the military art to stop fighting, letting the enemy attack in all ways, arrows flying, shouting incessantly, insults unbearable, can one endure and not respond, as if nothing happened. Only firmly guard the camp, nurture the soldiers, patrol day and night, carefully without negligence. When the fire abates, I guard my spirit mansion while attacking the enemy’s nest; with one drumbeat attack, traitors and bandits can be removed without difficulty. The method of war and controlling desire have the same measure. I fear students do not know this method, gathering desire fire inside, rarely without scattering mother and child together. Later in alchemy, only gather all spirit light of eyes, ears, mouth, nose, not using outside, all stored in the dantian as the source of life’s endless flow. Daoism has no other mystery but to gather and solidify the primordial spirit, not letting it go out, always at home; then one may live a thousand years, and spirits transcend ten thousand ages. Thus, life is heat of the body, death is cold of the body; spirit is qi, qi is fire. Heaven has this fire, so birth is boundless; man has this fire, how can he not live ten thousand years? As for sight, hearing, speech, movement, wine, lust, wealth, qi, all minor matters should be practiced on the good side to avoid consuming spirit qi, then the Golden Elixir has its root, the dharma body can be formed. This secret must not be rashly transmitted. It is not that Heaven forbids people to cultivate the Way, but because evil-doers have their own underworld judges and punishments, karmic debts hard to escape, and karmic enemies unwilling to spare them. If lightly given, producing small immortals who only know to gather and conceal spirit soul in the boundless, so enemies cannot find them, the underworld cannot pursue souls, causing good and evil in the Three Realms to be unclear, resentments rising—whose fault is this? Saying this, I tremble; are students not afraid?

### Five  
Students come to pay respects, but I have no wondrous method to teach. I secretly think the Most High said: “With desire observe the cavity, without desire observe the subtle.” These two lines are the patching of leaks and the root of true realization and completion of the Way. Desire is not private desire, nor intentional thought; consider this desire as between intention and non-intention, as I often say, using a little bit of meaning. This cavity is not the navel one inch and three fen below, nor the lower field or water village. Teach students to slightly use meaning, close the eyes, gather the ear’s resonance, seal the tongue’s intent, hold the body upright, tall and erect like a rock towering mountain, lofty and floating like the bright moon imprinting pond water, cutting off all outward chasing desires and inward entangled杂念, severing all at once, leaving no thread or fragment. Then, with full spirit gathered into the void cavity, always caring for it, never forgetting, over time natural truth will appear, yang qi will arise, and the long-accumulated阴霾气 in the belly will naturally transform and vanish. From this, add fierce cooking and refining, always illuminating, then when true yang moves, gather and collect it, practice the rising and falling method, use the method of retreating fire, and the great elixir will surely form. If thoughts arise and feelings stir, one may shake and straighten the primordial spirit, standing firm and erect, naturally no feelings arise and no thoughts occur. Also remember past days are many, future days few; if one day is unfortunate, who knows when one will be freed from the mundane cage and escape all suffering? One must think of one’s body, Heaven and Earth’s reliance, parents’ nurturing, originally hoping to become immortal Buddha, reach nirvana; if not deeply cultivated and attained, how can one stand out among men and repay Heaven, Earth, and parents’ great grace? With this thought, righteous qi will not fail to rise, evil qi not fail to be removed. If so, essence will not leak, qi not scatter, spirit not disperse, and the physical body can be solid; the dharma body is thus preserved. This is the Most High’s saying of desire observing the cavity. As for the subtle one word, the Way’s reality is difficult. It depends on the worker reaching the place where qi and blood harmonize, spirit is comfortable, carefree, no thought or worry—not that there is no thought or worry, but thoughts arise like floating clouds passing the vast void, not clinging, not caring—this is the sign of subtlety. Further, from this, those usually depressed can be free of depression, those usually faint can be free of faintness; all are effects of subtlety. The ancients said: “Immortals have no other method but to produce joy, not sorrow.” This is the true subtlety. Further show the reality of observation. At this time, one still reflects on the heart’s square inch, yet there is no square inch to reflect; still focuses on the dantian, yet not the dantian’s capacity. Whether with intention or without, following breath’s coming and going, I only clearly know within, not dragged by breath’s rise and fall. This is the subtlety of observation. In sum, at first slightly bow the head to look carefully, then gently stretch the waist to gather brightness, finally reach the lively heavenly mechanism, qi rhythm rugged—this is the secret of longevity. I see students’ form and qi declining, spirit exhausted; teaching them as young children to truly illuminate within the dantian one inch is too strenuous, not suitable; so I show the lively observation method, which can be done anytime anywhere. Sitting has its method, sleeping has its method. I will not speak of sitting method; as for sleeping, before the body sleeps, the heart sleeps first. When all affairs are done and one lies on the bed, what use is thinking? It only wastes the heart. Only gather and collect spirit light, slightly bow the head, shine into one cavity, naturally spirit and qi join and rest, fire and water aid and ease. As for walking, one should shine spirit light two or three steps ahead, like a gentle breeze, walk slowly, not tiring the body. When standing anywhere, know to stand firm like pine and cypress, neither constrained nor lax—this is the method of standing.

### Six  
My master in his day, when learning the Way, was not free from family ties of father, son, husband, wife, unable to sever at once. Often thinking of the passing sun and moon, one cannot help but worry; thus what cannot be cut is cut away, and with one heart and one virtue, he attained the golden elixir. If then one procrastinates, today not giving up, tomorrow not abandoning, day and night worrying for children and grandchildren, how can one expect to have time for cultivation when impermanence arrives? Yet I do not teach you to harden your heart and sever ties; rather, do not be like worldly commoners who daily toil to support a family and plan for descendants. With passing years gone, use that worry for descendants as fuel for cultivating nature and destiny, not foolishly minding children’s affairs. Moreover, children have their own fortunes; why foolishly imagine and do useless things? One must understand one’s own affairs clearly; do not wait until the western mountain’s sun sets, wandering aimlessly like one entering a treasure mountain empty-handed—truly pitiful. When this heart is swept clean, future alchemical cultivation will be easier. If idle thoughts and worries linger and return, even diligent cultivation will rarely gain true fire and true medicine. Students must know when desire arises and feelings stir, quickly sit in the courtyard. If desire is fierce and feelings strong, even with the Kunwu sword, the root is hard to pull out. Only by letting go completely, laying down the whole body, as if nothing happened, can one succeed. Do not fight with it nor rashly seize it. What I now show precisely targets students’ sickness; do not regard it as old talk and neglect it. From today, sever all love and desire, all entanglement and attachment with one stroke, not allowing a thread or a moment to block inside; within a few months great effect will appear. Yet I do not teach you to abandon the world and dust, never engaging with affairs. Know that living in the world, heart in the Way and virtue, being in desire without desire, dwelling in dust yet beyond dust—this is the sage. The great Way’s trouble is weak resolve, unable to always hold one awakened illuminating heart to see clearly. If one can always illuminate and guard, always watch and guard, no matter sight, hearing, speech, movement, in noisy or quiet places, never leaving the heart’s square inch, daily growing and monthly flourishing, accumulating to the realm of great transformation spirit. Otherwise, many ancients and immortals were poor, had aging parents, wives and children, weak sons—how could they become immortals? Only by one thought not scattered, effort not slackened. This is the highest cultivation of transcendence, yet not leaving the world.

### Seven  
All things must first be shaded by yin, then born by yang. Without a prior stage of warming and nurturing, suddenly wanting true qi to vaporize and manifest is impossible. Hence the *Yijing* says: “One yin and one yang is called the Dao.” Clearly stating first yin shades, then yang rises. The principle of Heaven and Earth giving birth to beings is all like this. How much more the art of cultivation, which follows Heaven’s images and Earth’s forms, moving spirit’s work? Now I reveal to students: to manifest true yang phenomena, one must accumulate in stillness, nurture deeply, then can reach the utmost; do not merely hope for true yang to arise without early nurturing in stillness. I see students all understand my true secret, but warming and nurturing is not deep; postnatal nature’s dirt and impurity since birth are not fully washed away; thus when arising, mundane qi inevitably mixes in, unable to refine into a single millet-sized mysterious pearl, hence the trouble of gaining then losing. If one can nurture long, eventually all dirt from receiving qi and forming body will be eliminated one by one, forming a Muni treasure pearl, never lost. This is the personal sickness of students. Nowadays, in practice, do not seek yang birth, only seek no lack of yin. Also do not become discouraged by the difficulty of the Way, nor weary from diligent but fruitless effort. Know that after bitterness comes sweetness, after extreme yin comes yang; nothing in Heaven and Earth is otherwise, much less the Way of transcendence and becoming the highest immortal. The common saying: “Leaving home is like beginning anew; becoming Buddha has surplus.” Students, strive on. My master’s disciples are not few, yet to this day few have passed the second step; is it not that their ambitions fail, their vision shallow, not knowing that the vastness has no end, and one stage leads to another? Like a certain student, due to little daily merit and virtue, not cultivating yin restraint, unknowingly blocked by demons, thus retreating without advancing, doubting without believing. I see such people, more cause for alarm. I wish you disciples to set great aspirations, exert great effort, determined to save all beings, then you yourself will attain the Way’s fruit. With such heart, all under Heaven is one family; in China, if not called immortal, then who else? Know that all worldly glory is a place of vexation; one must leap this hurdle to not fall into the red dust and suffer endless woes life after life. Otherwise, if one thought is not held, one fears falling into the realm of ghosts and demons, beasts and birds, the worst of sufferings. Without thought is madness, with thought is saintliness; saint and mad are but a breath apart. Delusion is things, right mind is man; things and man are not far apart. To meet and not cultivate is true folly. Only by breaking this confusion can one be a great man with success and fame. As for wives and children, all love is but a temporary meeting at an inn, a brief stay then parting, each going their own way. It is said: “In the black lacquer coffin, wealth cannot be contained; on the Yellow Springs road, wife and children belong to whom?” Thinking thus, only this great road is my way out. Today we hear the true dharma and have good times; if not quickly to take refuge and cultivate self-reliance, I fear after this it will be hard to meet such a good affinity again. My master rejoices in your aspiration, your progress without retreat, so he spares no words to break you through. Do you not know my words? But fear you treat them as ordinary, habituated and unobservant. Like King Yue wanting to avenge Wu, always having someone beside him call out: “Goujian, have you forgotten the shame from the King of Wu?” My master’s words are also to awaken and rouse. I wish you to take these simple words to heart, to encourage your spirit and strengthen your resolve. Only this life is hard to come by again; if met and not cultivated, this rare affinity is wasted. I wish you well, yet also warn you of danger.

### Eight  
The ancients said: “In movement, refine nature; in stillness, refine destiny.” These two phrases already contain the essence of cultivating both nature and destiny, but few understand. Let me explain. What is refining nature in movement? Movement is not ceaseless activity, but responding to affairs. Who in the world has no relatives and friends to meet and respond to? Who has no clothes, food, family, and affairs? Know that when there are affairs, that is the time to work on refining nature. If not refined then, where else to refine? At such times, I seek propriety in sight, hearing, speech, and movement; moderation in joy, anger, sorrow, and pleasure; fulfilling the Way with children, ministers, brothers, and friends; appropriateness in clothes and food. Responding as things come, responding then forgetting, no prior thought, no after memory, treating things impartially, without calculation or scheming—this is having no desire and the heart naturally settled, heart settled and nature naturally settled. There is no better work to refine nature. Otherwise, abandoning the present to sit alone and claim sincerity and rectification of the heart is empty talk without effect. How about reflecting on the environment and having a mind of return and investigation, responding to affairs at all times, thus nurturing nature constantly? If a thought or desire arises, if others do not blame me, I myself feel uneasy. This is refining nature in movement, an easier path. The ancients said: “Refine oneself in the dust of the world.” Master Qiu said: “I cultivated in stillness with great benefit; later, traveling in markets and responding to affairs, I realized refining in movement far surpasses refining in stillness.” What about refining destiny in stillness? Stillness is not immobility, but having no affairs and no response. When idle, no matter walking, standing, sitting, or lying, always shine a spirit light down to the dantian, making spirit embrace qi, intent bind breath, spirit and qi cling, never separate, gathering without dispersing, merging as one, lively and active, moving within the dantian. Day after day, month after month, true qi surges, enveloping inside and outside the body, and the river cart’s path opens. Without true mechanism acting, blindly using will to force qi up the river cart, few escape burning the whole body’s essence and blood, producing strange diseases. Refining destiny, in the twelve hours of a day, how many moments are not refining nature or destiny? I fear students do not tighten themselves; why worry about affairs and troubles, thinking no time for cultivation? Think: if not refining nature, then refining destiny; no spare time needed. When does the river cart’s path open? When sitting in meditation, at first spirit enters qi, feeling spirit and qi depend on each other, meeting at the Yellow Court; after long accumulation of essence and qi, true qi surges, leaping through the body, feeling as if riding in clouds and smoke. With further accumulation, kidney essence not leaking, the three treasures of ears, eyes, and mouth open, in one or two months the river cart’s path opens. Alas, some have true qi but are polluted by dirt and covered by private desires; without removing the five leaks and stopping essence and qi leakage, they advance then retreat. Students must work with earnestness and courage. At this critical juncture, reaching this grand state, no matter how beautiful or noble the scene, no matter how frightening, sorrowful, or angry, I remain unmoved; only refining nature and destiny is my ultimate method, my settled point, never changing due to things. Those who do not advance thus are none. My master’s teaching today is familiar to you, but you have not yet fully grasped the detailed care, the constant work, no spare time. Follow this conduct, great effect will come, but do not slack or waste time.

### Nine  
How much time does a human life have? Youth is mostly wasted; in old age’s prime, one realizes that former days spent chasing fame and profit were but wasting time and spirit. Seeking the method to return to root and restore destiny, often no master is found; in the end, nothing is achieved, returning empty-handed, and one’s original substance is exhausted. Is this not deeply lamentable? You have met the dharma assembly and my master’s highest secret teachings; at this setting sun, good times are few—if you do not diligently cultivate, when the western mountain’s sun sets, fog and shadow deepen, regret will be late. Yet alchemical cultivation is only about collecting postnatal intention to gather tangible elixir; even if formed, it is a small art. Even if hearing of nature work, not considering the whole great use, still confined to form and color, unable to transcend form and appearance to find the true original person. Thus Confucian cultivation of nature, when attained, is still confused, chasing worldly scenes, unable to empty all. If only cultivating the lower field, it is small indeed; even if attained, hard to compare with the highest. Because such cultivators only know to use mundane mind, with conscious spirit as master, not the living origin. When thought arises, knowledge arises, the prenatal pure spirit’s body, vague and indistinct, is unknown where it disperses. Once prenatal pure body scatters, the postnatal conscious mind becomes master of the body; even if the physical body is preserved, it is but a corpse-guard, how can it enter and exit nothingness, divide and transform qi, become countless myriad incarnations, and enjoy countless myriad years? Therefore, I teach students when the mysterious gate one cavity opens, seek out that true spirit, the true person of pure clarity. This true person is not separate from form and appearance, yet not within form and appearance; daily actions are his doing, but because of qi and temperament’s restraint and material desire’s obscuring, whenever a motive arises, if not obstructed by qi and temperament’s nature, it is entangled by material desire’s private attachments; without great wisdom, one cannot illuminate this hidden. I show students that when all karmic ties are let go, not a thread clings, after long stillness, a movement arises not from imagination, not self-made, in the midst of chaos suddenly a spark of spirit light appears—this is my primordial spirit. If one can recognize the primordial spirit, always as master of my body, the elixir formed must be natural great elixir. Otherwise, not recognizing primordial spirit, blindly beginning, how can one be in accord with Heaven and Earth, become an unbreakable golden immortal? Sanfeng said: “If one can take purity as essence, calmness as foundation, Heaven’s heart as master, primordial spirit as function, cleverly stealing mechanism, returning to creation, how could one not reach celestial immortal status?” Students, in affairs and non-affairs, always take purity as principle, calmness as essence, unmoving, vigilant and bright—this is Heaven’s heart as master. When moving, primordial spirit acts; then one can perform the return method. Know this? Yet at the start, one must forcefully hold with earnest heart, true heart; not merely covet quietness, falling into stubborn emptiness, losing all original vitality. Know all things are first difficult then attained; saying natural, there is no natural. Ancients said: “First use fierce fire to cook quickly, then use gentle fire to nurture.” Then private desires vanish, wisdom becomes bright, prenatal primordial spirit clearly appears. Recently you hear my subtle Way, but not yet at the stage of returning elixir and refining emptiness; still not leaving fierce refining and gentle nurturing to burn and steam impurities, melt dregs, then prenatal primordial qi and spirit surge forth. When refining emptiness arises, no private self, all is non-action, belongs to natural work. If half a private fragment remains, refining must be done. If the mysterious gate one cavity has no form or color to see, nor heart and kidney qi meeting, no sign appears. But heart has its mysterious gate, kidney has its mysterious gate; without revelation, no good secret. At first, with nature restraining emotion, suddenly kidney qi surges, true mechanism appears—this is kidney’s mysterious gate. Then with emotion returning to nature, suddenly heart spirit is joyful, qi mechanism opens—this is heart’s mysterious gate. This is true knowledge and spiritual knowing’s body. If one can stand firmly here, not moved by other things, naturally day by day, month by month, near the realm of light. In short, where is the mysterious gate fixed? When fully open, no place in the body is not the mysterious gate; in a day, all affairs are mysterious gate. This is beyond shallow people’s knowledge. Yet what I teach today, though called destiny work, is truly highest method, the returning of jade liquid to elixir, seeing nature and brightening the heart, unlike other schools that only speak of destiny work, blindly working on form body, seeking life. Students must slowly and seriously cultivate the essence of heart and nature; once attained here, future work is only to shape this heart and nature into a formed object. As for returning to root and restoring destiny, it depends entirely on accumulating lead and adding mercury, not on early or late manifestations. Many say young people easily accumulate lead, old people hard to add mercury; not knowing true lead and mercury are not things of form body, not divided by age. Ancients said: “This lead is not a dust thing,” this mercury is not in form and appearance; must seek in clear empty one qi, before chaos separated. Thus Dao says: “Accumulate lead in the dust world.” If it were a form body thing, the noisy dust world has no pure place; how can true lead accumulate? Yet lead also has distinctions. Destiny yang arising, cultivating in stillness is one method of accumulating lead. Nature’s lead is Mencius’s vast qi born of accumulated righteousness. Where righteousness lies is not one-sided; sometimes gained in earnest poetry and rites, sometimes moved by discussing past and present, sometimes in meeting friends with insight, sometimes in viewing mountains and waters; more in acting benevolently, teaching righteousness, aiding the poor and distressed, various righteous deeds, sudden inspiration, suddenly entering the great vehicle. Such accumulation of righteousness is true practice. Mencius said: “The heart of compassion is the root of benevolence; the heart of shame and dislike is the root of righteousness.” If one can act accordingly, apply evenly, and always nurture the arising scenes, not letting them vanish and arise again, this is expanding and accumulating true righteousness practice. Thus day and night cautious, never letting heart have unbenevolent or unrighteous places, ashamed in solitude, regretful before spirit and brightness, then my heart is free and joyful, my will naturally complete—this is Mencius’s “straight nurturing without harm, utmost greatness and strength, filling Heaven and Earth.” This is accumulating lead to the utmost. If occasionally a trace arises without awareness, though the primordial heart’s vastness seems gained, a moment’s negligence or a slight thought’s error makes the heart no longer joyful and complete—this is Mencius’s “when conduct displeases the heart, it withers.” Do you know this? This is accumulating lead in movement, the mysterious gate of nature’s inception. I see many cultivators today focus only on destiny’s root, forgetting nature’s root, only speaking of still cultivation to accumulate lead and add mercury, not knowing that lead and mercury in movement must also be taken at all times; thus gains do not match losses, life days few, losses many. If one can cultivate in movement, no matter great or small merit, all act accordingly, timely and appropriate, spirit is joyful and sufficient, qi naturally vast and vigorous, surging upward like soaring to the heavens. I ride this awakening to expand and promote, guard against idleness, naturally qi’s momentum blazing, rising to the sky, encompassing Heaven and Earth, ancient and present, beyond naming or description. Not only like nurturing in stillness, vaporous and vigorous, penetrating tendons and bones, washing marrow and cutting hair! Alas, today’s learners are often ignorant of this, accustomed to comfort, taking worldly gold, jade, wealth, wives, and pleasures as their gain. Though there is some gain, within is a segment of irritable qi, proud qi, false stinginess, various dust karmic impurities, true qi drowned—only pity their confusion and failure to awaken to such extremes. Now I warn students: in all daily affairs, with myriad feelings, I always treat things according to their cause, use human to govern human; no matter large or small, there is a segment of supreme harmony qi; I hold this to prevent indulgence, thus righteousness accumulates. From this one point of joy and encouragement, in all movement, I accumulate; day by day, month by month, it is easy to surge over the four seas, embrace the six directions. Only fear students do not carefully discern, missing the original person. Students have true heart, have true qi, have true essence; thus they play endlessly, admire without end. Joy, anger, sorrow, and pleasure are all like this. Only pay attention and experience, surely nothing is without truth. Yet not like worldly pleasures, only a bit of coolness and calmness; not only others cannot know, even oneself does not know why. Once this qi arises, do not fail to expand it, nor seek elsewhere. This is the root of benevolence and righteousness; otherwise, being controlled by affairs and obstructed by principle harms the Way and qi—only this.

I speak of accumulating righteousness to generate qi, a study of removing human desire to preserve Heaven’s principle; the Great Elixir Way is transforming qi and substance to restore the original method. There is great distinction here. What is it? The study of removing human desire is the study of pure flow; the study of transforming qi and substance is the study of clear source. Human desire arises later; qi and substance are received at birth. Because qi and substance are biased, material desire arises accordingly. If only removing external temptations but not transforming qi and substance’s accumulation, the source is not clear, how can the end be pure? Even with deep attainment, if qi and substance are not transformed, the root remains. Therefore ancients refined elixir by refining self, not by restraining self. This shows ancient immortals once used spirit fire to burn postnatal qi and substance, like removing weeds by the root, cultivating virtue like nurturing a tree’s root, not like accumulating righteousness only seeking outside, unaware that first the root must be pulled. The *Daodejing*, *Yellow Court*, and other scriptures teach only refining methods; other teachings on restraining selfishness are not detailed. Why? Because life and death arise from yin and yang roots not removed. Qian is three yang; Kun is three yin. With these three yang and three yin, life and death are bound. Ancients knew that if yin and yang roots are not removed, life and death remain tightly bound; thus they planted one yang seed in Kun palace, making Kun solid and becoming Kan; then drew one yin to reside in Qian, making Qian empty and becoming Li. This is the method of having and not having, using nothing to control having—two stages of work. Taking Kan’s method is to take the yang planted by us, receive it in the central yellow position, unite it with Li’s spiritual mercury, refining a segment of vaporous qi, the elixir root. Students who gain this elixir root then move spirit fire, add external furnace fire talisman, urge it to rise to the mud pellet, then return from the mud pellet to the red palace, combine with yin essence, refining a primordial spirit. Slowly nurturing with spirit fire, when the embryo is full, a true person emerges, spirit communication unparalleled, transformations endless. This is “place the other’s Kan in the heart’s center, dot my Li’s inner abdomen yin.” Using prenatal one-origin qi as elixir mother, within elixir mother produces yang lead; this yang lead subdues Li’s yin essence. Over time, spirit, blood, and qi all transform into a pure yang, utmost firm body, steaming muscles and burning bones, completely burning away postnatal qi and substance, even destroying flesh and blood body, leaving only a bit of true spirit dry yang qi, able to be big or small, present or absent, thus transcending life and death, escaping reincarnation. Heaven and Earth have end times, but I alone have no end; Heaven and Earth have life and death, but I alone have none. This is because this yang spirit is utmost void and utmost real; utmost void is utmost real; utmost non-being is utmost being. Thus I can birth Heaven and Earth and myriad things, but Heaven and Earth and myriad things cannot birth me. Think on this: if students reach this state, even the great Heaven and Earth cannot surpass me. Do not say this state is difficult; only fear people unwilling to accumulate essence and qi to establish the foundation. If the foundation is established, true joy naturally arises, no hardship unbearable. Ancients compared the first stage to an iron steamed bun, hard to chew. If one can chew out flavor from the tasteless, later work will be like breaking bamboo, easily gradually reaching the utmost.

Ancients said: “From chaos to awakening, one becomes the seed of immortality.” Truly not empty words. But know this awakening is not sought with intention, nor accidentally gained without intention. From the midst of confusion and chaos, after long nurturing and deep accumulation, when spirit mechanism is touched, Heaven’s music plays automatically—what is called the breaking of front and back. This is nature’s light, true awakening, unsurpassed perfect awakening, the original person. Without first joining spirit and qi in the void cavity, after long habit, spirit merging and qi flowing, becoming one, inseparable, how can there be sudden awakening? This is neither having mind nor not having mind, having mind and no mind, like tending a fire. At first a mass of steaming qi condenses inside, no fire seen but fire freely present, like the consciousness spirit within chaos. After long accumulation, fire power sufficient, suddenly yang light appears, burning Heaven and Earth, unstoppable, yet fire itself unaware and unrestrained—this is the symbol of consciousness still chaotic. Students must accumulate thus from chaos, condensing spirit light without dispersing, then one awakening, fully bright and penetrating, unhindered, complete, is my spark of spirit’s true face, able to transcend defilements, attain nirvana, become great awakened Tathagata golden immortal. Especially know that before awakening, there is only vaporous qi; after awakening, only a single spirit light operates alone in the void, no trace of thought or consciousness mixed in; do not say external matters, even my spirit light is not self-known, only fitting its nature. Ordinary people after awakening have thousands of thoughts and ten thousand imaginations, one thought leaving, one thought coming; even in one moment there is endless life and death reincarnation. How can they escape ghost and deity bondage, yin and yang melting? Hence the more spirit is dim, the more qi is chaotic; even phantom body is hard to keep, how much less dharma body? Even spirit and qi remain, sinking long, taking suffering as joy, mistaking poison for sweetness; until death in confusion, still not awakened. Thus greed, hatred, ignorance, and love are no different from life before; so life after life no escape, no end to elimination. If so, all arise from after awakening, unable to accumulate as nature, unable to manifest as feeling, obeying natural Heaven, listening to material impressions, hidden and manifest united, silent illumination united, thus sometimes joy and anger, sometimes sorrow and pleasure, taking evil as right, falsehood as true, completely destroying original goodness. Who knows impermanence of arising and ceasing? The present is a fiery pit, the immediate is a black prison; why wait until after death to see? Only the utmost person thoroughly investigates creation’s subtle meaning, recognizes life and death’s root, suddenly awakens from chaos, firmly grasps, not letting go, only one star of spirit light shining in the void, vigilant forever, bright and unclouded, initially unaware of awakening, unaware of illumination, unaware of grasping—this is timely divine knowledge, knowing the subtle spirit. From this day, the sun moves yang fire, night retreats yin talisman, enveloping this supreme ultimate true principle; after long time spirit full and qi abundant, suddenly becoming great awakened golden immortal, never born or dying. Do not say this awakening is not the root of our immortals, seeking other wondrous methods. At this time, one awakening sees body and mind empty, spirit clear, no dust or shadow, like refined gold and fine jade; after awakening, joy is indescribable. One thought of awakening is one thought of bodhi; one moment of calm breath is one moment of nirvana—is this not truly awakening immortal? Yet chaos awakening has true and false. Nowadays people, one moment of confusion is taken as chaos; knowledge arising is taken as awakening—this is mistaking thief for son, hardly achieving success. Only in nothingness suddenly Heaven’s mechanism moves, clear and bright, void and lively, is true chaos and true awakening; otherwise, no one mistakes confusion for chaos, knowledge for awakening. Students must know chaos is not root, awakening is not root; only from chaos awakening arises a realm of clear, serene, complete brightness and profound clarity, then true boundary is attained; do not confuse with the word “vague.”

Between Heaven and Earth there is nothing but one red furnace. If a person can endure the world’s refining, no matter how fierce or tragic the scene, I remain unmoved. Knowing my flesh-and-blood lump is but the false union of the four elements, not my original true body. My true body originally dwells within the form, stands beyond the bones, sometimes still, vast flowing like ocean waters; sometimes moving, flowing gracefully like river waves. Such movement and stillness silently meet their true nature; over time ice melts and snow dissolves, naturally standing without form, existing without body. Thus all affairs, responses, burdens, and hardships are seen as the furnace and hammer of Heaven and Earth, so I remain unmoved. Moreover, I am not only unmoved but also unrelated to my original person. How much more so the original things, which are false external karmic entanglements and myriad thickets, which further lighten dust emotions and empty form and appearance, thus transcending and standing alone beyond body and bones, towering between Heaven and Earth. If not called immortal, then who? I see most people covet power and profit, lust for sound and color, unaware that within themselves stands a true immortal, outstanding and surpassing. When encountering displeasing or unfavorable matters testing them, they say Heaven’s destiny is not blessed, spirits do not aid, even curse Heaven as cold and spirits as ignorant and unhelpful. Alas! All because they do not know within their body is an original person who does not share birth and death with the body. Why? Because everyone has a void and clear original essence, only because of comfort and ease, drowning in sound, color, wealth, and profit, only knowing the mortal body, not the true body. Hence ancients said: “Favorable conditions are hard to meet, adverse conditions easy to get.” Mencius said people “are born in adversity and die in ease”—is this not true? Because the original form and appearance have not changed for countless ages, from chaos until now, the wise do not increase, the foolish do not decrease. Why are those who see the Tathagata, return to root and restore truth, so few? Only because the original person, if not stirred, is content with the usual; if not ground, is bound by habit, so cannot see. Only when affairs come thick and fast, grinding and sharpening, forced by circumstances, must one return and think of the old. Thus it is said: “Heaven and Earth are one great furnace and hammer.” Moreover, Heaven and Earth open and close; light and clear float upward as Heaven, holy and divine; heavy and turbid condense downward as Earth, mundane and material. Humans stand between Heaven and Earth, half clear half turbid, mingled yin and yang. If one can cultivate virtue to restore original face, light and clear rise to become immortal; if one covets desires, only nourishing the body’s illusion, heavy and turbid condense downward to become ghost. Like the red furnace refining gold, dregs melt into dust and mud, refined gold becomes a precious sword. Without fierce fire, how to melt dregs into sharp weapon? This is why gentlemen act in their place, entering without obstruction, only by truly recognizing the original person can external hardships and dead ends not disturb. Not only unmoved in heart, but because of hardships one can deepen care and worry, seeking only a peaceful nest. Thus ancient sages tread dangers as if flat ground, all due to hardships and grinding. In sum, circumstances do not burden; those who burden are commoners. If a Daoist is advanced, having seen nature and heart, knowing self is not in this flesh and blood cavity, transcendent, outstanding, lofty, joyous and carefree. Flesh and blood lump is but due to one initial thought’s error, unable to hold, thus fallen into the four-element red dust, residing here, leaving form here—this is an illusory body, lasting but a hundred years, ultimately decaying and perishing. What honor is this? What shame? What peace in life? What suffering in death? Therefore I sharpen conduct, strengthen will, always refining the flesh and blood furnace, with burdens as the furnace’s refining; without burdens, using purity as the heart’s washing. Thus always in change, though circumstances differ, the refining of my form body makes it clean and bright, one and the same. Have you truly recognized the original person? My master, thinking of you who seek the Way long, now points out a bit of original form and appearance, so you may have a grasp in your chest, then not fear dust labor’s burden. How to see it? It is the vastness in movement, the depth in stillness, a mass of qi mechanism flowing through the whole body. Do you recognize it? This is what ancients called “essence, qi, and spirit three treasures united as one.” If you nurture this, returning it inside, then in the dantian you feel a mass of vaporous, harmonious, calm mechanism—this is the original person’s manifestation. Fearing burdens of affairs hinder cultivation, only need to clearly recognize the original person, always take this as root, so “a thousand purples and a thousand reds are all spring.”

All things in the world, fullness contains the image of emptiness; utmost flourishing contains the mechanism of decline. When things exhaust, they transform anew; when people exhaust, they return to root; when time exhausts, it returns to origin. How can turbid essence not be removed, and clear qi flow? Ancients worried in times of crisis but remained unmoved. Thus King Wen imprisoned in Youli composed the *Zhouyi*; Confucius in adversity at Chen and Cai played stringed songs; in unbearable circumstances, only sages remain calm. Because virtue, wisdom, skill, and intelligence deepen through trials and worries, their wisdom grows deeper, virtue clearer; compared to those in comfort and ease, their progress is boundless. Human life’s trouble is inability to cultivate; not trouble is external insults. Virtue’s trouble is inability to advance; not trouble is myriad calamities. Because a moment’s adversity is easy to pass, but ten thousand generations of clear blessings are hard to seek. Only by tasting hardships and dangers can one strive forward, resolve to cultivate secretly, sit for countless years with wealth and fame unspoiled. Those treacherous Qin bandits, boasting momentary power, leave behind millennia of foul reputation, falling into prison bottom, never to escape; compared to martial sage Yue Shaobao, who suffered a lifetime but left fame for ten thousand generations, which is better? Moreover, these two sages, with flesh-and-blood illusory bodies, directly destroyed the true bodies of Qin’s bandits for a thousand years; their gain and loss is clear. Moreover, wealth and glory are all fleeting external things; gain is not to be rejoiced, loss not to be grieved. How much better to guard my spirit yang, enjoy my nature Heaven, which is great and lasting? Yet people do not understand the mysteries of the netherworld, do not know human and ghost principles, so cling to dust ties until death, who knows? Mundane people see life and death as different, day and night as constant; sages deeply understand yin-yang and life-death subtleties, viewing life and death as day and night. Like tonight’s matter, one sleep and rest; at dawn, father, brothers, wife, children remain; friends and relatives remain; dealings, emotions, and all grievances and joys remain unchanged. This is the teaching of reincarnation and cause and effect, thus lasting through countless kalpas. Alas, people today live poorly, often hoping for future kalpas, but do not think today’s ignorance, will there be knowledge in the next life? If today has no ability, will the next life have? Impossible. It is said: “A journey of a thousand miles begins with the first step; a tower of a thousand layers begins with piled earth.” To desire old age happiness, must labor in youth; to expect future wisdom, must nurture in this life; to seek wealth and honor for two kalpas, must plant now. Thus “Laozi is not born from Heaven; Tathagata does not arise from the earth.” Only diligent, cautious, seeing principle clearly, guarding nature steadily, then join Heaven and Earth. Only fearing people unwilling to lay down the butcher’s knife, thinking to become Buddha on the spot; thus childhood aspirations, white hair no achievement, only feeding delusions. Also heard ancients say: “All is present matter; the enlightened go to Heaven, the confused to Hell; both return to the supreme cause.” The enlightened have life energy; the confused have killing energy. Hence the alchemical scripture says: “Enter the world’s method, cultivate the transcendence’s way; follow the common path, cultivate the alchemical path’s reversal.” Thus wine, lust, wealth, and qi cause mundane people to lose their lives; sages use them to form virtue. Same bed, different dreams—saint and mundane differ only in respect. You know the original true face; now advancing, must go straight to bodhi, finally become the great Way. First must nurture this heart like autumn moonlight, without dust; like spring flowers brilliant, naturally joyful, as if nothing else—then one is truly a sage of empty and clear spirit. Otherwise, do not say evil thoughts are burdens; even good thoughts not descending the Mani jewel are obstacles to our Way. Even anc
