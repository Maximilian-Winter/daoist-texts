# Cultivation Undone by Temptation: A Tale of Retreated Heart and Tragic End

This is a lamentable story of a cultivator from the Song dynasty. The protagonist was once a high official in the court, but due to the machinations of Qin Hui, he was pushed aside and retreated to the mountains to cultivate, making considerable progress. Yet when Qin Hui died, he could not resist the urgings of his family and returned to serve as an official. The allurements of the bustling world shattered his cultivation, and in the end, he died a miserable death.

Chen Yuancheng (given name Jue), a court attendant, was a native of Minzhong. By nature and aptitude, he delighted in the dao. During the reign of Emperor Gaozong of Song in the Shaoxing era (eleven thirty-one to eleven sixty-two), Chen Yuancheng often served as an aide to Prince Han Qi, assisting him in his duties as an envoy of pacification. Later, Prime Minister Qin Hui disliked him and left him unused for many years. Disillusioned with official life and no longer striving, he built a thatched hermitage south of Great Maofeng Peak in Jurong County (the very summit of Maoshan). He completely severed relations with his wives and concubines. He constructed a Bagua Terrace, bowing morning and evening in reverence to the starry heavens. In leisure, he practiced spirit preservation and inner observation—Daoist methods of cultivation—living a tranquil and austere life, pure of heart and scant of desire. He also purchased dozens of acres of farmland at the mountain’s base to support wandering cultivators who roamed beyond the dust of the world.

Every year in the second month of spring, the birthday of the Great Maogod (the founding ancestor of Maoshan) was celebrated. Officials, commoners, and Daoist practitioners from all directions gathered, throngs surging everywhere. The mountain held seventeen palaces and temples, with daily offerings and rituals without pause. Yet among them, the Yuanfu Wanning Palace to the north of the mountain burned with the most fervent incense. Chen Yuancheng went daily to pay respects. One day, he encountered a guest, tall and slender, with blue eyes and square pupils, bearing a demeanor both elegant and forthright. The guest wore a garment of oak leaves and held an eight-sided fan. Blocking Chen’s path, he asked for money. Chen took a Chongning copper coin from his bamboo box and gave it to him. The guest accepted it joyfully but then said, “You gave me money; I cannot leave without returning a gift.” He handed back the coin Chen had just given. Chen was astonished to see that it had doubled into two coins. When he looked again, the guest had vanished. Returning to his hermitage, Chen took out the coins and found them all made of gold! He was even more amazed.

That night, he dreamed the visitor returned and said, “I am Lü Dongbin. Because you possess the potential for transcendence, I played a jest upon you. Though your resolve to learn the dao is earnest, your power to benefit all beings is not yet manifest; you must strive further!” In the dream, Lü Dongbin taught Chen methods of breath submission, true refinement, and flying talismans to cure ailments—Daoist arts—and promised to meet again in thirty years.

Awakening, Chen never again ate meat or drank wine, practicing the correct methods of the heavenly heart. When people suffered from strange and severe ghostly calamities, those who received his talismanic waters were immediately healed. He also performed fasts, rituals, and offerings for others, with many efficacious results. Having dwelled in the mountain for many years, Chen’s steps were light and swift as if flying; both Daoist adepts and common folk revered and respected him.

After Qin Hui’s death, those in power at court who were old acquaintances urged Chen to return to official service. At first, he resolutely refused, but unable to withstand the persistent requests of his younger relatives and nephews, he returned home to a state of “offering ancestral rites” (receiving salary without office). Liu Xinshu was appointed military commissioner over Jianghuai and recommended Chen as a councilor. Soon after, Chen served as prefect of several prefectures, eventually regaining his original post. His dao heart grew ever more lax, and his formerly effective methods no longer worked.

In his later years, he kept many concubines, his back bent and waist stooped, his ears deaf and eyes dim—utterly unlike the days of mountain cultivation. Once, while bathing near a fire of burning charcoal, Chen seemed to see a divine spirit rebuking him. Startled, he fell into the furnace, half his body burned and rotted, and he died.

His grandson-in-law was Li Xun, who in the final year of Shaoxi under Emperor Guangzong of Song (eleven ninety-four) served as clerk of Jurong County and recounted these events. The storyteller was Yu Zhongqing, styled Jisi.

Chen Yuancheng, court attendant (Jue), a native of Minzhong, by nature fond of the dao. During Shaoxing, often following Prince Han Qi as an envoy aide, later disliked by Prime Minister Qin, left unused for years, thus abandoning official ambitions, building a thatched hermitage south of Great Maofeng Peak in Jurong. Completely severed ties with wives and concubines. Built a Bagua Terrace, morning and evening worshipping the starry heavens. In leisure, practiced spirit preservation and inner observation, tranquil and sparse in desire. Bought dozens of acres of land at the mountain’s base to support wandering cultivators.

Every year in the second month of spring, the Great Maogod’s birthday, officials, commoners, and Daoists gathered from all directions. Seventeen palaces and temples, daily offerings without empty seats; only the Yuanfu Wanning Palace to the mountain’s north had the most fervent incense. Chen went daily to pay respects, met a guest tall and slender, blue-eyed with square pupils, elegant and forthright, wearing oak leaf clothes, holding an eight-sided fan, blocking the path to seek alms. Chen gave a Chongning copper coin from his bamboo box. The guest accepted joyfully, then said, “You gave me money; I cannot leave without returning.” Returned the coin to Chen. Chen was amazed to see two coins. The guest vanished. Returning to the hermitage, the coins were gold! Even more astonished.

That night dreamed the visitor came, saying, “I am Lü Dongbin. Because you have immortal potential, I played a joke. Your dao resolve is earnest, but your power to benefit beings is not yet manifest; strive on.” Taught breath submission, true refinement, flying talisman healing arts, and promised to meet in thirty years. Chen awoke, ceased meat and wine, practiced heavenly heart correct methods. Strange ghost calamities healed immediately with his talisman waters. Performed fasts and rituals with many efficacious results. Years in the mountain, steps light as flying, Daoists and commoners all revered.

After Qin’s death, those in power and old friends urged return; initially refused, but yielded to family requests, returned home to “offering ancestral rites.” Liu Xinshu appointed military commissioner Jianghuai, recommended Chen as councilor; soon served as prefect in several prefectures, restored original post. Dao heart grew lax, methods no longer effective.

In old age kept many concubines, bent and stooped, deaf and dim-eyed, unlike former mountain days. Once bathing near burning charcoal, seemed to see divine spirit rebuke, fell into furnace, half body burned, died. Grandson-in-law Li Xun, clerk of Jurong in final Shaoxi year, recounted. Story told by Yu Zhongqing, styled Jisi.

This is one of many “Lü Dongbin” stories collected by the great Song literatus Hong Mai in *Yijianzhi*. In this tale, the Patriarch reveals a divine marvel. Yet even Lü Dongbin’s salvation efforts sometimes fail: Chen Yuancheng was deeply drawn by the world’s wealth, beauty, fame, and food, unable to break free despite his earlier cultivation. This shows his practice was conditional—he had originally been an official but went to the mountain only because of political exclusion. With Qin Hui’s death, the reason to leave vanished. This story evokes a sigh: the red dust truly is a great arena of the dao.
