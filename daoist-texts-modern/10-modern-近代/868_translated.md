# A Barber’s Quest for Immortality in the Song Dynasty

In the early years of the Zhenghe reign of the Song Dynasty—specifically the first year of Zhenghe, which was one thousand one hundred and eleven—there lived in Chengdu a barber, a craftsman skilled with his tweezers, who spent his days bustling about the marketplace. His wife remained alone at home. One day, a Daoist with his hair tied in a topknot came by. He requested the barber’s wife to pluck his beard and hair, offering her two hundred qian (coins) in advance. The barber’s wife politely declined, saying, “It won’t take much effort; ten qian would be more than enough.” The Daoist replied, “Keep the money first, and patiently pluck my beard for me; don’t mind the trouble.” So he sat down.

She began by shaving the left side of his face, then moved to the right. When she finished the right, she returned to the left, only to find the beard there had grown thick and tall again. She plucked the left side once more, but after finishing, the right side’s beard had grown anew. This back-and-forth went on several times, yet the Daoist’s beard kept growing without end. The sun passed midday. The barber’s wife, weary and vexed, returned the two hundred qian to the Daoist and refused to continue plucking, bidding him to leave.

When her husband returned, she recounted the day’s strange encounter. Hearing this, the barber grew vexed and said, “This must be Master Zhongli! Why did you drive him away? Even if I had to pluck him from today until tomorrow, what harm would there be? That I have not met a divine immortal is my fate.” Then the barber dashed wildly through the streets, calling out, “Master Zhongli! Why have you abandoned me?” Day and night, he paid no heed to hunger, thirst, cold, or heat. Thus passed three or four years. The barber traveled through all the counties surrounding Chengdu and even searched the mountain forests.

One day, he met a woodcutter. The man set down his burden and asked the barber, “What are you doing?” The barber told him his quest for Master Zhongli. The woodcutter said, “You speak of a divine immortal. If he comes seeking you, that is one thing. But you, wandering endlessly, what benefit is there in searching your whole life? Though I am but a foolish woodcutter, I have heard that to attain the dao, one must accumulate hidden virtue and perform great kindness; one cannot rely on luck. I have a secret method to teach you. If you use what I teach to cultivate the dao, with the passage of years, you may well fulfill your wish.” With a playful gesture, the woodcutter plucked a blade of grass by the roadside and blew upon it. Instantly, the grass transformed into a golden hairpin! He said to the barber, “Try using my method; it will surely help you.” The barber said, “These are all illusions, unworthy of learning. What I desire is simply to see Master Zhongli!” The woodcutter said, “You have never seen this master. If you meet him, how will you know it is he?” The barber replied, “I asked my wife and learned his appearance. I have already drawn his likeness and keep the picture in my sleeve.” The woodcutter said, “Then you shall bow to me three times, and I will enable you to see this ‘master’ you seek!”

The barber immediately prepared to bow. After the first bow, he rose, and the woodcutter asked, “How do I look to you?” The barber said, “You look just as before.” So he bowed a second time. The woodcutter asked again, and the barber answered the same. At the third bow, when he looked upon the woodcutter, the man’s appearance had changed—there was no trace of the woodcutter’s face, but instead it matched perfectly the image of the master he carried in his sleeve! The woodcutter said, “You are truly a sincere seeker of the dao. You have wailed and searched for years; your voice has echoed through the heavens. The Jade Emperor has deeply pitied your unwavering resolve and thus sent me to rouse you. Come with me.” So the barber followed the “woodcutter” into the mountains.

Two years later, the barber returned to his village, bid farewell to his acquaintances and old friends, and then departed. To this day, he has never emerged from the mountains again.

One thought unchanging is true aspiration; one will unwavering is the heart of resolve.

Here is a guess: some will surely say, “Who the hell doesn’t want to become an immortal? It’s not that easy!” Very well, this one sentence reveals your fear of difficulty. What does fear of difficulty mean? It means you lack confidence. To put it plainly, you lack determination. At root, your pursuit is not steadfast enough—that is, not devout enough.

Once I met a Daoist friend. I asked him, “Why do you cultivate the dao?” He said, “To ascend and become an immortal.” I asked, “What if you fail?” He said, “Then let me die on this path.” Only with such resolve does one know that Penglai is near; without effort, it always seems just within reach yet far away. With this determination, devotion is sufficient.

Yesterday I saw a reporter interviewing Elon Musk. The reporter asked, “If a rocket explodes, will you give up?” He said, “Never give up, unless I am dead.”

By this text, I invite everyone to reflect on what your true wish really is. You can also sense that your “voice and breath” must correspond and seek the same channel.
