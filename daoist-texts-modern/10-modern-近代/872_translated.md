# Musings of the Azure Yang: Do Not Seek Human Bestowal of Seals; Accumulate Virtue Through Kind Words

This world,  
is filled with countless mysteries,  
and these mysteries,  
in the experience passed down by the ancients of old,  
were called the taboos of language.  

Human beings,  
are not merely animals in the simple sense,  
for any animal wishing to become human,  
must cultivate for at least five hundred years.  

Yet a human, at birth, already possesses five hundred years more of dao practice than animals.  
Therefore, why is it that the weasels, snakes, and foxes of the world,  
after cultivating to become dao,  
all desire to receive the “bestowal” from humans,  
to be called “like humans” or “like immortals”?  
It is because they have cultivated for five hundred years,  
only then matching the dao of a newborn infant.  

But human dao practice is also subject to depletion.  
Humans are born with many divine powers,  
yet through delusions and desires,  
these original divine powers become obstructed.  
And as one chases after desires and fame,  
one’s dao practice dissipates accordingly.  
When a person dies, their dao practice is exhausted,  
and unable to remain human, they become ghosts.  
(Those who cultivate will foresee the time in advance,  
and ascend to higher realms.)  

Creatures like weasels, foxes, and snakes  
do not seek bestowal from just anyone;  
they specially seek those of high virtue,  
people of noble character, esteemed and respected, to grant them seals.  
For example, snakes hope to be sealed and enfeoffed as dragons ascending to Heaven,  
foxes, weasels, and hedgehogs  
hope to be sealed as immortals, attaining the dao and becoming human.  

As for street ruffians and petty hooligans,  
these creatures also know well  
that if they seek bestowal from those of low quality and no cultivation,  
they will likely be beaten to death with a stick,  
and then roasted with sauce to be eaten.  

In earlier writings,  
I have mentioned,  
within the Daoist worldview,  
all animals in this world  
are divided into five kinds of “insects”:  
scales, fur, feathers, naked skin, and shells.  

The king of the scaled insects is the dragon,  
all animals bearing scales are scaled insects.  

The king of the feathered insects is the phoenix,  
all animals bearing feathers are feathered insects.  

The king of the furred insects is the qilin,  
all animals bearing long hair are furred insects.  

The king of the shelled insects is the Black Tortoise (Xuanwu),  
all animals bearing shells are shelled insects.  

The king of the naked insects is humanity,  
all animals with exposed skin are naked insects.  

Among these five kinds of insects,  
the most formidable is humanity,  
especially the human kings of the Chinese land.  

Ancient Daoist figures  
always held that every seven hundred years,  
a human king would be born on the Chinese earth,  
manifesting as the Polaris Purple Tenuity Star,  
and this human king would possess the power to enfeoff gods.  

Thus, in ancient times, one could observe,  
in times of flourishing peace,  
many Daoists would appear (all to uphold the sage),  
and emperors would decree the enfeoffment of many immortals.  

Most notably in the Tang dynasty,  
Emperor Li Shimin enfeoffed the twenty-four meritorious officials of Lingyan Pavilion,  
the underworld judge Zhong Kui,  
the door gods Qin Qiong and Yuchi Jingde,  
the martial protector of the capital Wuan, and the city gods, among others.  
After these immortals were enfeoffed by emperors of extraordinary lineage,  
ordinary people burned incense and prayed to them,  
and their protection became truly efficacious.  

*(Li Shimin)*  

In the past, even Daoist Celestial Masters  
needed the human king to grant their seals,  
and Daoist cultivators who attained the dao among the common folk,  
even if praised by the people,  
still needed the human king to enfeoff them as Perfected Ones,  
or be recommended by the Celestial Master’s Mansion as Immortal Nobles.  

Only then could they obtain exalted immortal ranks in the dharma realm,  
completing the final step of merit perfect and full,  
as earthly immortals, human immortals, or ghost immortals,  
except for Heavenly Immortals and Great Golden Immortals,  
who do not require imperial bestowal.  

The above explains that humans are born possessing dharma power,  
which is why human curses generate energy.  
As the old saying goes, “When a thousand point fingers, one dies without illness.”  
Then why do many elderly couples curse each other for a lifetime without harm,  
while some couples curse only a few times and suffer ill consequences?  
The core reason is the vast difference in bearing capacity.  
A person with high bearing, cursing one with low bearing, will have effect.  
But a person with low bearing, cursing one with high bearing,  
either the curse fails or rebounds upon themselves.  
Many evil masters and sorcerers’ curses are fierce,  
but when facing invaders,  
or extraordinary figures like Genghis Khan,  
such curses have no effect at all.  

Everyone has their own fortune.  
If a person’s fortune is good and luck is strong,  
no curse can affect them.  
As the saying goes, “For three years a person is red-hot, even ghosts and gods dare not meddle.”  
But once fortune declines and luck is lost,  
those with higher bearing and energy than them,  
uttering curses, will see those curses come true.  

Therefore, why many family curses are ineffective,  
and why many family curses on children are ineffective,  
is simply because the bearing and energy fields are balanced,  
and the child’s energy and bearing surpass the parents’,  
thus the curses fail.  

Conversely,  
if a person’s luck is already poor,  
and family members not only fail to encourage but curse them,  
combined with frequent crying and wailing at home, attracting the crying spirits,  
and the household’s kitchen and door gods dislike such lamentations,  
then external ghosts enter the home,  
and with curses added,  
disasters quickly manifest, eventually bringing calamity.  

In life, choosing a companion is crucial.  
Kind heart, kind words, kind deeds, immeasurable virtue.  
Narrow heart, constant crying, extreme conduct, endless family calamities.  
Between spouses, and parents to children,  
words must be especially cautious, avoiding curses.  
Otherwise, once the taboo ghosts and gods of Heaven and Earth are stirred,  
disasters will not be light, nor misfortunes slight.  

At the same time, the ancestors have also told the world,  
to think before speaking or acting,  
and when hearing others speak,  
analyze how best to respond,  
and only after careful thought, speak forth.  

Master Zhou once told me a story:  

When working for points and eating communal meals, he had a neighbor who thrice daily encountered two snakes entwined,  
a great ill omen in folk belief, portending death.  

Yet he was fortunate,  
for the first person he met was a well-known Daoist,  
to whom he reported the matter.  
The Daoist replied:  

“To see three snakes in one day is rare indeed;  
ordinary people might never see such in several lifetimes.  
You surely will soon prosper and add offspring.”  

A year later, the man indeed had a grandson born,  
and the family unexpectedly gained wealth.  

I was puzzled and asked Master Zhou, “Master, this is a great ill omen; why did the Daoist say it would be good?”  

The Master said, “This is called sealing and enfeoffing.  
The Daoist knew trouble was coming, but Daoists are judges, celestial officials with heavenly commissions.  
When we speak, if we say good, it is good; if we say bad, trouble will come.  
So this Daoist sealed and enfeoffed him with safety, and thus good fortune came.”  

I asked, “Is this like in the *Investiture of the Gods*, when Bigan’s heart was cut out, and he asked the vegetable seller if a heartless vegetable could live, and if a heartless person could live?”  

Master Zhou answered, “Yes, because Bigan was guided by immortals to seek a seal.  
If the person he met said a heartless person could live,  
then by receiving that word, he could live.”  

I found this truly wondrous, and as I pondered, Master Zhou continued:  

“I have a nephew who is a pig butcher.  
Once I joked with him,  
since his father was my sworn godson,  
I told him to come bow to me,  
or else he wouldn’t be able to kill pigs.  

I thought it was a joke.  
Two years later, I met him again and asked about his pig slaughtering business.  
He said, ‘After you said I couldn’t kill pigs, things went badly: the knife wouldn’t draw blood, pigs ran wild, and several clients had the same problem.  
Now no one hires me.’  

I sealed and enfeoffed him, saying, ‘Now when you kill pigs, the knife will strike and the pig will die.’  
After that, his pig slaughtering went smoothly.  

This is sealing and enfeoffing, especially when done by Daoist masters or venerable men of great virtue—the power is extraordinary.”  

Master Zhou also said, “In the past, moving house was done in three steps:  
first, installing the stove;  
second, setting the bed;  
third, opening the wealth gate.  
The day of the banquet was the day of opening the wealth gate.  

At the opening of the wealth gate, a person who knows the ritual would conduct a dialogue.  
First, the door is closed, and inside and outside people ask and answer,  
exchanging auspicious words.  

For example, inside asks, ‘Who are you?’  
Outside replies, ‘I am the Three Stars of Fortune, Prosperity, and Longevity.’  

Inside asks, ‘What do you bring?’  
Outside replies, ‘I bring abundance: gold and silver, wealth, many descendants, complete honor, top scholars’ hats, countless sons and grandsons all together...’  

After this exchange, inside says, ‘Quickly, please enter!’  

Master Zhou continued, “But if during the opening, inside asks, ‘Who are you?’  
and the outside neighbor jokingly replies, ‘I am the god of poverty, the star of disaster,’  
then after moving in, misfortune will follow, and even accidents may occur.  
This too is the power of sealing and enfeoffing.”  

I asked thoughtfully, “Then those wedding pranks where the groom is made to wear a watermelon hat, a green hat, beggar’s clothes, and be tied up and beaten—aren’t those also bad forms of sealing and enfeoffing?”  

Master Zhou answered, “Yes, so when my grandson marries, I hold a bamboo stick nearby;  
anyone who dares to prank gets a few strikes.  
I do not allow such nonsense at joyous celebrations.”  

Master Zhou further said, “When raising the main beam in construction, everyone would shout ‘Rise!’ to mark the family’s rise.  
If someone foolishly says, ‘This house will surely collapse,’  
then the family will indeed have misfortune after moving in.  
In such cases, that person must be driven away, and a new date chosen for the beam raising.  
Such a person is called the most annoying troublemaker in the village, a ‘shit stirrer’ or ‘egg biter.’”  

Master Zhou continued, “In the old days, weddings were held in courtyards with banquets;  
guests brought gifts and cash,  
then clasped fists and loudly spoke auspicious blessings.  
The bride and groom would respond, ‘Thank you for your golden words!’  
This was to attract joyous words and bring blessings to the couple.  
Now these customs have been abandoned.”  

Master Zhou said, “For those of us who study the dharma, the words of the master are even more precious.  

Once a man learning dharma asked his master, who was old and nearing passing,  
‘What if my methods don’t work?’  
The master repeatedly assured him they would.  
But the man, lacking understanding, kept asking, ‘What if they don’t?’  
The master said, ‘Every time you come to my grave and offer incense, it will work.’  
After that, the master passed away.  

From then on, the man had to offer incense at his master’s grave for any ritual to work; otherwise, it wouldn’t.  
This became so troublesome that he gave up being a Daoist.  

This is what happens when one lacks understanding and is sealed and enfeoffed by the master.”  

Master Zhou said, “Often we meet those who lack understanding,  
because they do not know how to respond,  
leading to many troubles.  

For example, when we perform rituals, we tell the person:  
‘After this ritual, all evil will disperse, demons will not invade, disasters will be averted, and longevity and blessings will endure.’  

If the person is wise, they reply, ‘Thank you, sir, your golden words will surely come true!’  
After such a reply, their fortune slowly turns.  

But if the person says, ‘What if I remain unlucky?’  
then the ancestors and patriarchs will not protect them,  
and they will indeed be unlucky, even more so.  

Some ask, ‘Does this ritual really work? Can I really turn my luck? Or will I become more unlucky?’  
As long as they doubt, they will certainly suffer misfortune,  
because they do not know how to respond properly.”  

I thought about this and realized some entrepreneurs I know, especially from Fujian and Chaoshan,  
are very good at responding;  
such people are polite and understand rules in business and dealings.  

But many believers from northern regions,  
perhaps because Daoist culture and folk traditions have long vanished there,  
do not understand these principles,  
and often say surprising things that make people laugh or cry.  

Once a Daoist friend sought exorcism from Master Tian,  
who told her, ‘After the exorcism, you will be well; just go home and say nothing else.’  

But when she left, she said, ‘Thank you, I will come back to see you soon.’  

Master Tian slapped his forehead, knowing trouble was coming.  
Sure enough, not long after, the problem recurred, and she returned for another ritual.  

Master Tian told me:  

‘When we go out to do work for others, the greatest taboo is when the host says, “Come back and visit when you have time.”  
If they say that, soon someone in the family will die again.  

Exorcisms are the same; if the host says that when we leave, the problem will recur,  
and the ghosts and spirits sent away will return.  
No matter how hard you try, it won’t work.’”  

I asked, “What should they say then?”  

Master Tian said, “Just say, ‘Sir, please go slowly,’ and nothing more.”  

Only after hearing masters and teachers discuss these taboos did I realize  
the power of language far exceeds our scientific understanding of the world.  

So I write this to warn all:  
Be mindful of your daily words.  

Speak more auspicious words, fewer curses,  
seek more joyous words, speak more propitious words.  

Never offend those of high virtue and esteem,  
those who truly cultivate the dao and know dharma,  
lest you invite their sealing and enfeoffing, harming your own fortune.  

When I was young, my father told me,  
‘Respect the elderly, especially those inconspicuous old folks by the roadside.  
Do not think they are easy to bully; do not offend them, lest you be sealed and enfeoffed.’  

At that time, I did not understand and asked, ‘What is “sealing and enfeoffing”?’  

My father said, ‘Some old people may seem plain and ordinary,  
but some are artisans, some are Daoists, some are upright men, some are good people who accumulate virtue.  
If you accidentally offend them, and they have a bad temper,  
a few words from them sealing and enfeoffing you—  
you may not be able to bear it.’  

I did not believe it then,  
thinking such superstition was too fanciful in my atheistic mindset.  

Only later, when I began studying Daoist dharma,  
and met many venerable Daoist masters,  
hearing many stories of sealing and enfeoffing,  
did I begin to realize this is indeed true, and extraordinarily efficacious...  

Daoist Zhang Zhishun once told me his own experience:  

One day while meditating, a bird outside chirped noisily,  
and he found it annoying.  
That bird then fell and died.  

So Zhang Zhishun warned his disciples, ‘Cultivators should not casually harbor evil thoughts.’  

In the Northern Emperor dharma lineage, within the Supreme Dark Black Code, there is this scripture passage:  

> All judges receive commission from the Northern Emperor,  
> serving the Supreme Dark, accompanying the Perfect Martial Holy Lord in court,  
> wielding great authority.  
> Demonic kings often fear them, ghost officials follow.  
> Whenever entering or leaving, city gods and community officials escort them,  
> forbidding careless speech about human or ghost emotions.  
> Yin-yang spirit officials observe judges’ moods,  
> forbidding action without order.  
> If violated, demons lose fear, ghosts disobey,  
> and in crises, the judge loses power,  
> becoming insulted by evil ghosts.  
>  
> Annotation: Once, Master Zhu, leader of the True Lord, gathered friends,  
> and in anger at a silent person, thought, ‘Such unbelievers in the dharma can be killed.’  
> The person could not sit still, and upon returning, coughed blood and died.  
> This shows that judges commissioned in the Fengdu dharma are guarded by demons,  
> and in thought alone, demons act without orders.  

This tells of a True Lord surnamed Zhu,  
commissioned in the Northern Emperor lineage,  
who at a gathering harbored anger toward a silent person,  
thinking to kill such a disbeliever in the dharma.  
That person immediately fainted and later died coughing blood.  

Thus the scripture notes:  
Judges commissioned in Fengdu dharma are guarded by demons,  
and in mere thought, demons act without command.  

Therefore, judges must not lightly speak of human or ghost emotions,  
nor casually judge good or evil.  

To many now, this scripture is but a record,  
yet such customs and traditions remain widespread in Guizhou Daoism.  

Just as Master Zhou taught me when reading eight characters and feng shui:  

“No matter how bad a person’s eight characters are,  
if you are a judge, you must not lightly say they will suffer great misfortune or death.  
You can only hint gently, then tell them it can be resolved, all will be well, no need to worry,  
because you are a judge; if you say misfortune, it will surely come.”  

Master Zhou also said, “When giving feng shui readings, whether for living homes or ancestral tombs,  
never lightly say a place harms or damages people; only say good.  
After leaving, you may privately explain the true merits or faults,  
because as a judge, when you speak, the earth veins, dragon gods, and earth officials listen.  
If you say a place harms, though no harm yet, harm will soon come.  
This damages yin virtue, a good intention gone awry.  
Thus Daoists must guard their speech, not speak recklessly,  
to avoid harming their own virtue.”  

Later, my godfather told me:  
When Master He of the Xuanhuang Witchcraft Sect was young and quick-tempered,  
locals once forgot to invite him to a meal.  
Suddenly, a dozen people suffered stomach pains and cried out,  
asking if they had offended some evil direction.  

Master He jokingly asked, “Did you forget one person at the meal?”  
They realized they had forgotten him and apologized.  
After apologizing, Master He smiled and said to the void, “Alright, come back now,”  
and everyone recovered.  

I asked godfather, “What kind of dharma was that?”  

He said, “It’s not really dharma; it’s the witchcraft army.  
Once you inherit this power of command,  
when you think it, it goes.”  

Once your grandfather went to buy oranges,  
thought they were expensive, and casually said,  
“These oranges are so pricey, I doubt they’ll sell.”  
Then the oranges did not sell all day,  
people came and looked but did not buy.  

This is the power of thought and speech sealing.  
Ordinary people cannot bear it.  

So grandfather told me, Daoists must not speak recklessly,  
always say good things, bless others.”  

Recalling my father’s words in childhood,  
I now find them deeply meaningful and astonishing.  

This writing also warns the world to always cherish respect for the old and love for the young,  
for you can never understand with scientific eyes:  

“Three days after you kick an old person, three days later you are hit by a carriage and break your leg.”  

Such seemingly lawless events...  

And some young people with fiery tempers offend elders of high dao practice,  
or provoke their patience to breaking,  
and are sealed and enfeoffed with words like:  

“You child, you have gone too far; you will not live long.”  

Perhaps such a casual word  
will cut short that young person’s future.
