# Qingyang's Casual Notes: The Secret of Consecrating Divine Statues

This world harbors a curious phenomenon: all the major religions across the globe share a common reluctance to create divine statues, holding the belief that true deities possess no form.

Take, for instance, Catholicism, Christianity, and Islam—they all forbid idol worship, asserting that God is formless, and that any worldly image is but a false god.

Early Buddhism, too, forbade sculpting images of the Buddha. It was only about five hundred years after the Buddha’s passing that statues began to appear. When Buddhism entered China, it exploded into a profusion of Buddha and Bodhisattva images filling the skies.

And you need not be surprised—Daoism, in its early days, also did not venerate divine statues. In the era when Laozi transmitted the dao, contemporaries like Liezi, who could ride the wind and fly, and Zhuangzi, who dreamt of butterflies, all held no worship for statues.

Later, during the Han dynasty, when Patriarch Zhang Daoling founded the Orthodox One Heavenly Master Dao, his very first act was to overthrow the shamans’ altars and destroy various temples and statues, breaking the superstitious rituals of “six heavens’ stale energies.”

Zhang Daoling himself is the prototype for the “Ancestor of Earthly Immortals,” Zhenyuan Daxian, in *Journey to the West*. He venerated only Heaven and Earth—nothing else.

Most earthbound immortals, upon seeing him, would bow and kowtow, for his primordial spirit is the celestial Kui Star, the foremost Great Kui Star of the Northern Dipper.

Thus, under such a profound leveling strike, from the moment the Heavenly Master Dao was organized as a religious group, there was no mechanism for idol worship.

At that time, the Heavenly Master’s governance was established through twenty-four administrations, each ruled by an internal governor managing the faithful—that is, a human-to-human system.

Moreover, the Orthodox One Heavenly Master Dao chiefly employed magical methods to heal the sick and expel evil spirits, not relying on statues for salvation or divine manifestation, so there was simply no need to craft statues for worship.

This reasoning is easy to grasp.

Imagine a man whose leg is broken, wracked with unbearable pain. A qualified Orthodox Daoist priest would immediately chant the Hua Tuo incantation, invoking the ancestor Hua Tuo to instantly halt the pain—this is the mage’s direct spellcasting.

Not like someone who, seeing the broken leg, hurriedly pulls out a statue of Hua Tuo from their bosom, places it on the ground, lights incense, and prays for the statue to manifest and bless the recovery.

This is the difference between a mage directly wielding magic and other faiths praying to empty space or statues.

The Orthodox One Heavenly Master Dao, grounded in a wealth of practical spells, truly has no need to venerate statues.

In any matter, Daoist judges simply chant incantations and summon the corresponding military officers and generals to carry out their will.

Because there are so many kinds of these officers and generals, if all were made into statues for worship, the effort would be immense and utterly unnecessary.

These officers and generals normally reside within the mage’s body when not summoned.

When the mage needs to use magic, they summon them forth from within, so there is no need to create statues for their worship.

(For example, after receiving the official register, an Orthodox judge is allocated troops and horses. These troops dwell inside the judge’s body; during rituals, the judge issues commands with a token, summoning three divisions, eight scenic units, twenty-four gods, and twelve hundred officers and soldiers from the register to await orders.)

For the Orthodox school, once transmission is received, even without establishing a ritual altar, one can still perform spells and blessed water rites with full efficacy.

It was not until the Wei, Jin, and Northern and Southern Dynasties that the Southern Court’s Shangqing Maoshan Daoist Tao Hongjing compiled the *True Numinous Position and Karma Chart*, the first recorded Daoist lineage and hierarchy of deities.

(This chart is not the *True Numinous Position and Karma Chart* itself.)

However, during Tao Hongjing’s time, Daoism faced many internal changes.

First, it encountered the overwhelming rise of Buddhism, to the point that the monk-emperor Liang Wudi starved to death. Daoism lost its crucial standing in the rulers’ hearts.

Tao Hongjing was compelled to convert to Buddhism to appease him and, wishing to avoid close association with Liang Wudi, lived secluded in the deep mountains. When the emperor had matters, he sent envoys to inquire in the mountains—thus Tao Hongjing earned the title “Prime Minister of the Mountains.”

Second, Daoism’s internal factions fought bitterly, with sects often at odds.

Thus, in Tao Hongjing’s *True Numinous Position and Karma Chart*, as a Maoshan Daoist, he deliberately placed the Orthodox sect’s leader, the Supreme Lord Laozi, in the fourth column, suppressing the Orthodox sect’s divine authority.

Third, Buddhism from the Western Regions began flooding into China, building countless temples and statues, occupying many Daoist blessed lands and grotto heavens.

This sudden frenzy of Buddhist temple-building posed a grave threat to Daoism, which disliked crafting statues and building temples.

If left unchecked, Daoist founders’ and immortals’ blessed lands and grotto heavens would be entirely seized by monks.

Even the Yellow Emperor’s cave on Mount Song, where Zhang Daoling received the “Nine Cauldrons Elixir Scriptures” to become an immortal and found the Orthodox One Heavenly Master Dao—centered on the Yellow Emperor and Laozi—was occupied by the Western monk Bodhidharma, becoming the Bodhidharma Cave.

This was the very place where the ancestral sovereign Xuanyuan Huangdi cultivated, and the Orthodox sect inherited the Chinese Daoist tradition, which survived millennia of war, natural disasters, human calamities, dynastic changes, cultural invasions, foreign rule, and religious incursions, flowing unbroken to this day.

During the massive temple-building of the Northern and Southern Dynasties, Daoism began to transform, moving toward the folk, collecting and organizing the myriad Chinese ethnic deities, and started building temples, sculpting statues, and carving cliff inscriptions to protect Daoist immortals’ blessed lands and grotto heavens.

So, did the consecration of divine statues begin in this era?

Actually, the practice of consecrating statues traces back to the Xia dynasty.

In the Xia period, sacrifices to Heaven and Earth deities involved no statues—only offerings arranged on empty ground.

But ancestor worship included a ritual called the “Standing Corpse Sacrifice.”

This “Standing Corpse Sacrifice” involved a child impersonating the ancestor, fed with wine and meat by clan members. This child impersonator was called the “corpse position.”

Later, the idiom “sitting on a corpse and eating plain food” meant feeding the “corpse position” vegetarian fare, initially indicating disrespect to ancestors, later evolving to mean holding an important position without doing real work.

This “Standing Corpse Sacrifice” is the ancient form of what we now call “crossing to the netherworld.”

Back then, important ancestors would directly possess children in the household, and after consuming descendants’ offerings, would impart teachings and prophecy.

This practice still survives in Jiangsu folk traditions of spirit mediums.

I once heard from a chamber of commerce president in Changzhou, Jiangsu, that he almost every year invites his grandfather’s spirit to cross over and converse, asking what to watch out for that year.

Because it is so efficacious, and the bond between grandfather and grandson is most sincere, with the most genuine protection, he firmly believes without doubt.

Moreover, in many temples across Fujian, Guangdong, and Taiwan, many “deities” directly possess spirit mediums, speaking or writing prophecies and teachings for devotees.

These are all lingering shadows of the Xia dynasty’s “Standing Corpse Sacrifice.”

Why was this “Standing Corpse Sacrifice” later abolished?

Because each major clan conducted ancestor worship, and the common people’s reverence for ancestors reached extremes, which was unfavorable to imperial rule.

Thus, the royal court forbade families from performing “Standing Corpse Sacrifice,” allowing only offerings before ancestral tablets, forbidding ancestor possession and speech.

Like Zhuanxu’s “Absolute Heaven Communication” of the Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors era, the common folk lost the power to communicate directly with ancestors and spirits, losing intuitive grasp of future fortunes and calamities, becoming dull-witted.

Thus, the core of consecration is essentially the ancient soul-invoking and possession ritual within the “Standing Corpse Sacrifice.”

Later, when spirits possess humans, it is called “supporting the luan.” If spirits are invited to possess humans to write or give teachings, it is called “supporting the ji.”

The human bearing the spirit is called a “ji medium,” or “horse’s foot,” or “horse child.”

When spirits are invited to possess statues, it is called “inviting the luan,” or “offering the luan carriage,” meaning inviting the divine chariot of the corresponding deity to arrive and permanently dwell within the statue.

The *Supreme Heavenly Altar Jade Code* records: “All supreme true heavenly immortals and generals do not possess living human bodies; if they do, speaking through humans, they are certainly evil demons and heterodox ghosts.”

It also says: “Or called supreme true descent, relying on possessing living humans... thus becoming invaded by five great ghosts of the heavenly demons and heterodox paths into the ritual altar.”

But earthbound deities do not belong to the supreme true heavenly immortals and generals, so they have always been able to possess human bodies.

What are earthbound deities? They are former mortals who did not ascend to the Dao in the human realm but became gods after death, governing the earth realm.

Examples include city gods, earth lords, mountain gods, General Yang Si, Marshal Kang, Marshal Wen, Marshal Guan, Marshal Yue, Lord Chi’s palace, Lord Li’s palace, Guangze Zunwang, Eastern Peak generals, and many ritual assistants.

But figures like Patriarch Zhang Daoling, Heavenly Master Xu Xun, Patriarch Xie Ziran, Patriarch Li Eight Hundred, Patriarch Lü Dongbin, and Patriarch Zhang Sanfeng, who ascended directly to the Dao in the human realm, are not earthbound deities.

They are Great Luo Golden Immortals, liberated from samsara, fully cultivated celestial immortals.

The *Supreme Heavenly Altar Jade Code*’s “supreme true heavenly immortals and generals” refer to the Three Pure Ones, the Six Emperors, the Boundless Five Elders, the Nine Emperor High Truths, the Thirty-two Heavenly Emperors, the Nine Heavens’ Responding Thunderclap Universal Transformation Heavenly Venerable, the Divine Firmament Nine Palaces Emperor, the Northern Pole Four Holy Lords, the Eight Great Heavenly Lords of Primordial Thunder, “Deng, Xin, Zhang, Tao, Pang, Liu, Gou, Bi.”

These great saints descend to the mortal realm only on scheduled visits and naturally do not possess the filthy bodies of humans.

Here I must also clarify: in Daoist history, it has always been forbidden to create statues of the highest saints and high truths in the mortal realm.

For example, the Daoist *Nüqing Heavenly Law* clearly states: “All acting judges must not paint the Three Pure Ones or Five Emperors; they should only gaze at the heavens in meditation, offer incense, then enter the altar.”

Why? Because Daoism holds that the Three Pure Ones and Five Emperors are a form of qi.

Like the Jade Emperor’s palace, called the Great Illuminated Hall, behind which shine seventeen rays of golden light—the illumination means only radiant golden light can be seen.

The Jade Emperor’s golden light divine incantation begins: “Heaven and Earth’s Mysterious Ancestry, the root of myriad qi,” this mysterious ancestral root governing qi cannot be manifested or clearly described in the human world.

The Three Pure Daoist Ancestors are the primordial qi of Taiqing, Shangqing, and Yuqing, existing only in the Clear and Subtle Heaven, the Yu Remaining Heaven, and the Great Red Heaven.

We humble mortals have never seen these and cannot truly behold or comprehend them.

Later images of the Three Pure Ones and Four Emperors were created by painters and sculptors from their imagination, not the true form of the highest saints and high truths.

Therefore, in early Daoism, the earliest statues and sacrifices were mainly to earthbound deities, water palaces, and heroic spirits of the living world.

For example, places worshipping mountain gods are called Mountain King Temples.

Places worshipping the Jade Maiden Bixia are called Bixia Shrines.

Places worshipping the Dragon King are Dragon King Temples.

Places worshipping Lord Guan are Guan Di Temples.

Places worshipping Yue Fei are Yue Fei Shrines.

Places worshipping the Earth Lord are Earth Shrines.

Places worshipping Yu the Great are Yu King Palaces.

Places worshipping Li Bing are Chuan Master Temples.

Places worshipping General Yang Si are Yang Si General Temples.

Places worshipping Mazu are Mazu Temples.

Places worshipping the Five Sacred Mountains are Five Mountain Shrines.

Places worshipping the City God are City God Temples.

All these are Daoist temple sites venerating earthbound deities, water palace gods, and heroic spirits who became gods in the human realm.

These earthbound deities, water palace gods, and heroic spirits each have corresponding divine souls.

During the consecration ceremony, their divine souls can be summoned to enter the statue, ensuring the temple is efficacious and protects the people.

But the supreme true saints are too distant from the human realm.

The Great Emperor of the Purple Tenuity in the Northern Pole, whose true spirit dwells in the North Star of the sky—

Which master can guarantee that the consecrated statue of the Purple Tenuity Emperor truly contains a portion or the true spirit of the Northern Pole star? This is beyond the reach of ordinary Daoists.

Thus, in the earliest, most rational Daoist eras, you will find the older ancient temples worship fewer deities, never the supreme high saints, only earthbound or water palace gods.

For example, early Wudang Mountain worships the Northern Pole True Martial Great Emperor because his spirit once cultivated and attained the Dao on Wudang Mountain.

This connection allows the temple to invite the True Martial Emperor’s divine soul into the golden hall’s bronze statue.

Similarly, Qingcheng Mountain’s oldest worship is mainly to Qingcheng Elder Zhu Ling Duming Heavenly Venerable.

When the Yellow Emperor Xuanyuan came to Qingcheng Mountain to seek the Dao from the immortal Ning Fengzi, and invited Ning Fengzi to descend and teach the world ceramic-making techniques,

Later, for transmitting the *Dragon Claw Scripture*, Ning Fengzi was bestowed the title of Five Mountain Elder by the Yellow Emperor, later called Zhu Ling Duming Heavenly Venerable.

Thus, Qingcheng Mountain’s main deities are Qingcheng Elder and Xuanyuan Huangdi.

Because these two immortals once had a connection here, when inviting their true spirits, the temple composes ritual texts to summon their divine souls.

Daoist worship and temple building differ from other religions.

True Daoists do not build temples without reason.

Which mountain has what story? Which deity once cultivated there? What special affinity exists? Which deity should be worshipped? These must be carefully considered.

The deities worshipped should not be chosen by popular whim, crowding all gods into one place—that often leads to inefficacy.

Instead, statues should be streamlined, only those deities with affinity to the place and capable of manifesting should be worshipped.

Ensuring that after dedication, the deity’s divine soul can be invited, guaranteeing the temple’s efficacy and protection for the people.

Because, ultimately, building a temple is to beseech the gods for peace and prosperity.

But too few Daoists know this; many simply take a mirror, chant the golden light incantation, and consider the consecration done—this is quite laughable.

Consecration involves many important steps, differing between temples and household statues.

Temple consecration is more complex; household statues simpler.

The temple consecration process is:

First: After building the temple, one must first perform the “Dragon Installation and Earth Establishment,” securing the temple’s mountain and water, the eight mountains and twenty-four directions’ earth vein dragon spirit lords.

Second: When preparing to sculpt statues, if clay statues, one must prepare “polluting items” in advance and choose an auspicious day.

If one does not understand date selection, starting to sculpt on days like the “Spirit Barrier Day,” “Ten Evils Defeat Day,” “Ghost Barrier Day,” “Heaven Barrier Day,” “Metal God Seven Calamities Day,” or other highly inauspicious days will cause the statue to be difficult to make efficacious and prone to evil spirits entering.

Polluting items must be chosen according to the deity’s civil or martial nature and divine rank.

But certain items must be included: golden heart, silver gallbladder, five-colored threads, thousand-mile eyes, wind-following ears, cinnabar, mountain-shouting and mountain-responding tokens, “road-road pass,” floating hair, water-shouting and water-responding tokens, throat tubes, left Azure Dragon, right White Tiger, front Vermilion Bird, rear Black Tortoise, fear of demons, sorrow of ghosts, divine spirits, heavenly ladder, and so forth.

If the deity is a thunder god or martial general, golden armor and thunder child are included.

If a civil official, jade belt and eight-bearer sedan chair.

In Fujian and other places, live wasps, venomous snakes, eagle claws, eagle beaks, wolf teeth, tiger bones may be placed in the polluting cavity to enhance efficacy and ward off evil.

Third: Opening the altar and dispelling impurities, sprinkling the temple and statues with purified water obtained through the Nine Phoenixes Purification ritual.

Fourth: Inviting the deity to witness the covenant, offering sacrificial items, pouring wine and tea.

Fifth: Raising the petition and issuing decrees, formally inviting the deity to descend and bless the consecration, issuing orders to the thunder god officers to lead the main consecration ritual.

If evil ghosts invade the altar, they are captured by the Kui Gang and sent to Fengdu for punishment.

When raising the petition, one must know the palace corresponding to the deity to be consecrated.

For example, the Wenchang Emperor corresponds to the Wenchang Laurel Palace; the Jade Emperor to the Vast Heaven Illuminated Hall; the Four Officials of Wealth to the Fortune and Prosperity Wealth Palace; Zhao Gongming of the Dragon-Tiger Profound Altar to the Profound Wealth Palace; the Compassionate Navigation True Man to the South Sea Compassionate Navigation Palace, and so on.

(Originally, Daoism only worshipped earthbound deities in the mortal realm, but with changing times, it began to venerate the supreme high saints.

To ensure these sacred statues manifest, the patriarchs petitioned through petitions to the upper realms, praying for the supreme high saints to descend their grace and mercy upon sentient beings.)

Sixth: Installing the polluting items and sealing the statue’s body, inviting the deity to enter and confirming with divination.

Seventh: Consecrating and dotting the statue’s eyes, welcoming the deity to take their seat, and the Primordial stabilizing the altar.

In this consecration ritual, the mage applies the golden light incantations and hand seals cultivated daily onto the statue, transforming its divine realm quality, turning the statue from a mundane object into a golden light divine artifact.

With golden light, the deity’s true spirit is willing to settle, while ghosts and demons fear the golden light and dare not invade.

After consecration, the faithful must continuously burn incense for forty-nine days without interruption, then the deity’s efficacy is assured.

In the sixth step, in Fujian, Taiwan, and other places, the statue is carried to the deity’s ancestral temple to request a divine portion.

For example, a Mazu statue’s consecration requires going to Mazu’s ancestral temple to request Mazu’s portion to enter the statue.

For True Martial Great Emperor, the statue is carried to Wudang Mountain’s golden summit to request his portion.

In some areas of Jiangxi and Hunan, the faithful carry the statue into the mountains, where mages blow ox horns and shake ritual knives, summoning mountain spirits or loyal and righteous ghosts to enter the statue and serve as the deity protecting the locality.

(This is folk practice by shamans like Duan Gong and unrelated to Daoism, though efficacious; Daoism does not fully endorse this method because the spirits summoned are difficult to control.)

In the past, on Longhu Mountain, a thousand-year-old fox spirit once sought a commission from a Heavenly Master.

After receiving the commission, it went to a certain Xuan Emperor Temple in Guangdong to serve as the Xuantian Shangdi there.

(This kind of spirit, cultivated for over a thousand years, possessing divine powers and a kind heart, passing the Eastern Peak’s examination and going to serve as a deity, is most reasonable.

They have wisdom, know how to accumulate merit, whom to help, what to avoid, and are mature spirits.)

In traditional Daoist temple consecrations, the mainstream method remains writing petitions and inviting upper realm deities to descend their grace and portions.

Though one cannot guarantee their arrival, at least the petition is made to the supreme high saints.

Even if only a sliver of divine light descends, it is better than randomly summoning a spirit to impersonate a deity.

Thus, to ensure divine efficacy, the lower-tier deities are most effective.

In Fujian, Taiwan, Chaozhou, and Shantou, people directly worship Door Gods, Earth Lords, and Kitchen Lords at home—these grassroots deities are the most down-to-earth.

Because worshipping Earth Lords and Kitchen Lords poses no risk of external ghosts invading the statue—after all, the village chief is always present; any ghost daring to impersonate him would be courting death.

But for the highest and grandest deities, first, it is very difficult to invite their true portions during consecration; second, even if a somewhat powerful portion is invited, it is hard to ensure proper home worship.

Slight missteps may cause the deity to depart, allowing external ghosts to enter the statue and absorb incense offerings.

Such households worshipping external ghosts, by drawing near to ghostly paths, invite calamities and disasters—carelessness may lead to wife and children departing, family ruin, and death.

Because the taboos of statue worship are so numerous, the elders repeatedly warn the young: “Inviting gods is easy; sending them away is hard. One must be cautious when inviting and worshipping deities.”

For once mishandled, endless disasters befall future generations.

For example, the Northeast’s Household Protecting Immortal, if not worshipped for one generation, brings misfortune to the family.

The Southwest’s Altar God is the same—one generation without worship, and chaos ensues.

If no truly skilled master handles these properly, not only will one not receive protection, but great danger will arise.

Daoism’s systematic methods of divine statue consecration ensure these statues remain pure.

But monks have not learned the golden light methods, and the Buddha did not teach consecration of Buddha statues.

With so many Buddha statues across China, and countless household Buddha statues, what exactly dwells within these statues?

This question is left for all to ponder.

Having said this, you should now understand why all the “sages” worldwide do not strongly support worshipping divine or Buddha statues.

Because at their level, they know ordinary people cannot control what exactly is enshrined within these statues.

And precisely because ordinary people cannot manage these troublesome matters, it is better to forbid them from worshipping anything, thus avoiding many unnecessary demonic invasions.

But for Daoism, the patriarchs hold that all worldly divine statues belong to the Yang Bureau temples, fundamentally subordinate to the Supreme Earthly Sovereign, the Benevolent and Sacred Eastern Peak Great Emperor, under his governance.

Once a demon temple, evil temple, or heretical altar or shrine causes trouble, upon receiving Daoist reports, the Eastern Peak dispatches thunder god officers to destroy the temple.

This absolute administrative and law enforcement authority over the dharma realm is unique to Daoism worldwide.

For example, in the Daoist Canon is the *Biography of Earthly General Wen Taibao*, which mentions a Buddhist temple on Sengjia Mountain in Min County, Fujian.

There, evil ghosts occupied the temple, claiming to be the King of Galo.

Locals long recited the *Diamond Sutra* at the temple, with incense offerings flourishing.

Later, General Wen, under orders from the Eastern Peak Great Emperor, led the Yue Mansion officers to burn the temple with thunder fire; the temple vanished forever.

In Mianyang, Sichuan’s Jiulong Town stands the Spirit Official Tower, built during the Ming dynasty’s Chongzhen era by Prime Minister Liu Yuliang to honor the Spirit Official.

Later, monks used tricks to convert the Daoist temple into a Buddhist temple, transforming the Spirit Official Tower into a wooden Buddhist pagoda, hailed as Asia’s greatest Buddhist tower.

After completion, the Spirit Official cast thunder fire to burn it down; the fire’s pattern formed the Spirit Official’s visage, and the temple disappeared.

At Jiuhua Mountain, Spirit Official is worshipped.

Local monks say Spirit Official wishes to convert to Bodhisattva Kṣitigarbha.

But in truth, Jiuhua Mountain’s Kṣitigarbha Hall was formerly a Daoist temple.

After its construction, it was often burned by thunder gods; every few years, it would burn.

Monks, guided by sages, realized Spirit Official governs the fire department and began worshipping Spirit Official’s statue.

Since then, Jiuhua Mountain’s Kṣitigarbha Hall ceased to burn.

This is Spirit Official protecting the Dao, awaiting a high Daoist to restore the Chinese ancestors’ Daoist temples.

On Emei Mountain, there is the Three Nights Cave, venerating the Three Nights Ladies.

After Emei became a Buddhist holy site, incense remained flourishing in this cave.

Monks did not destroy it but exploited the people’s respect for the Three Nights Ladies to collect incense money.

In 1937, the cave’s abbot monk had the people donate a large copper bell.

When the bell was completed, Buddhists brought it to the cave to celebrate.

Some well-meaning people invited an opera troupe to perform *The Investiture of the Gods*’s *Three Nights Record: Yellow River Formation* mocking the Daoist Three Nights Ladies.

Soon after the performance began, a great fire erupted in the cave, killing all seventy-two Buddhists present.

Since then, the Three Nights Cave has lain desolate, overgrown with weeds, never reopened.

This is a classic case of a Daoist patriarch’s temple, after being occupied by foreign religions, choosing to forgo incense rather than submit to heterodox scriptures.

As for how the cave could erupt in fire, experts and professors have yet to solve the mystery despite extensive research.

Thus, Daoist temples, patrolled long-term by the Yue Mansion’s touring divine generals, remain far purer.

Many worldly ghosts and spirits, fearing the Eastern Peak’s patrol and capture, dare not roam temples to absorb incense.

The temple deities, bound by the Yue Mansion’s strict laws, dare not offend, lest they be arrested and punished in the Eastern Peak underworld.

Hence, they cautiously fulfill their divine duties, protecting the people, unlike the demons and ghosts of other foreign religions who act at will.

Even Daoist deities worshipped in households are supervised by the Kitchen God and Door Gods, preventing evil ghosts from invading.

Moreover, Chinese ghosts and monsters deeply respect Daoist deities, only frequenting foreign religions’ statues and incense.

For example, the Northeast’s Five Great Immortals are considered spirits in Daoism.

Yet these five greatly respect Lady Bixia, the Jade Maiden.

Lady Bixia is the Eastern Peak Great Emperor’s sister, commanding a million Yue Mansion shadow soldiers.

Thus, even worldly demons bow respectfully before temples dedicated to Lady Bixia, fearing to cause trouble.

When Beijing built the Water Cube, a strange wind arose from demolishing the Beiding Lady Temple.

This wind was stirred by the dragon spirit guarding the Beiding Lady Temple.

(Beiding Lady Temple also venerates Lady Bixia.)

Understanding Daoism’s earthbound deities’ governance of mortal temples, one realizes that deities need not be worshipped too high or too far.

Just as in human relations, one need not know the highest people—just the right fit is best.

High-ranking deities, from their lofty positions, find mortal desires insignificant.

Many matters cannot break Heaven and Earth’s Dao’s own principles; they do not casually alter mortal karma.

Instead, grassroots earthbound deities are the actual administrators of human affairs (like NPCs in a game).

Mortals’ fortunes and misfortunes are governed by them.

Offer them incense, maintain their offerings well, manage the relationship between gods and humans properly.

Make the deities admire, protect, care for, and watch over you, and all will be “as if aided by gods.”

Divine grace is vast; divine love embraces the world.

Chinese deities were once like us, living in this world.

They have names and surnames; many are our own ancestors sharing our lineage.

They became deities and are worshipped for millennia because they possess boundless love.

When we Chinese seek protection from our own ancestors, the efficacy is naturally greatest.

I know a Daoist friend from Fujian who, after a breakup, would go to Mazu’s temple and mutter to Mazu:

“Mazu Niang, my luck’s been so bad lately; that so-and-so is a scoundrel who deceived me... blah blah blah,”

After venting, she kneels before Mazu, raises a divination cup, and says:

“Mazu Niang, please bless me to find a rich and kind boyfriend, and punish that scoundrel with misfortune. If you agree, please show me a holy cup.”

When the cup appears, she happily goes home.

Only our Chinese deities allow such intimacy—treating gods like grandparents, sharing heartfelt words, even coquettishly whining and playing tricks.

Who else but our Chinese gods?
