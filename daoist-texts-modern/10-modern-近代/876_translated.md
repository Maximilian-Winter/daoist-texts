# Miraculous Responses from Reading the Scripture of Purity and Tranquility (Collected Accounts)

## One: Moral Purity and Tranquility—Unscathed by Raging Fire

In the first year of the Qingyuan era, there was a man named Sun Shou. He lived in the forest by the sea, making his living by hunting. One day, a sudden fire broke out in the forest, smoke and flames filling the sky, burning all the trees to ashes. Yet, a small grove remained untouched by the flames, growing lush and vigorous.

Sun Shou found this strange and went to see what was happening. Approaching, he saw among the trees a quiet altar. Pushing open the door, he beheld an old man, about seventy years of age, sitting upright before a desk, reading aloud a scroll of scripture.

Sun Shou stepped forward and respectfully asked, “Old sir, what are you reading?” The old man looked up in surprise and asked, “Who has come to me?” Sun Shou replied, “I am a hunter by the seaside. Just now, the forest caught fire, but only your dwelling and its surroundings remain unharmed and safe. I came to see the reason.” The old man said, “I have lived here for over four hundred years, never encountering flood or fire.” Sun Shou asked again, “What scripture are you reading?” The old man answered, “It is the Scripture of Constant Purity and Tranquility spoken by the Most High Patriarch Laozi.” Sun Shou inquired, “What is this Scripture of Purity and Tranquility?” The old man said, “Please sit, and I will explain it to you carefully. ‘Purity and tranquility’ means the dao of virtue. My body is pure and tranquil because I hold fast to the practice of simplicity and chastity.”

“Purity and softness are the dao’s steadfastness; purity and clarity responding with infinite transformations are the dao’s changes; purity and tranquility as vast as the great sea are the dao’s virtue. I can uphold this purity and unite truly with the great dao, endlessly transforming—what fear have I of fire? Pure and impure, movement and stillness, all follow the dao’s transformations ceaselessly. I hold fast to this path of purity and tranquility—what calamity could harm me?”

Hearing the old man expound the great dao, Sun Shou immediately cast aside his hunting bow and arrows, bowed deeply to the old man, and begged to receive the Scripture of Purity and Tranquility. Enlightened in the true dao, he later became renowned throughout the world.

## Two: Calming the Sea’s Waves—All Depends on Purity and Tranquility

During the Tang dynasty, Bai Yun Zhe was the Grand Marshal of Zhuyang County. Once, he was ordered to transport provisions by ship to Liaodong. Along the way, a violent storm arose, waves surged wildly, and darkness enveloped the surroundings. Ren Zhe and his party were terrified. Suddenly, they heard a divine voice from the sky: “Lord Zhe often recites the Scripture of Constant Purity and Tranquility spoken by the Most High Patriarch Laozi. Now at this perilous moment, why do you not hasten to recite it?”

Upon hearing this, Ren Zhe quickly chanted the scripture thirty times. As he recited, rays of golden light burst forth continuously from his mouth, visible to everyone on the ship. Before long, the wind and waves subsided, and Ren Zhe returned safely.

Back home, Ren Zhe invited Daoists to initiate a Huanglu fasting and offering ritual to universally thank the divine grace. He also printed and distributed three thousand copies of the Scripture of Purity and Tranquility across the Ten Directions. Ren Zhe lived to the age of one hundred and nineteen, passing peacefully without illness.

## Three: Soul Enters Fengdu—Saved by Scripture Practice

In the reign of Tang Gaozong during the Linde years, there was an official named Dou Dexuan. Once on a mission to Yangzhou, crossing the Huai River by boat, the vessel had moved several dozen steps from shore when Dou saw a thin, haggard man standing on the bank. Dou said to the boatman, “He looks pitiful; let him board and I will ferry him across.” The boatman steered to shore and took the man aboard. Along the way, Dou ordered water and food brought to serve him. When the boat reached the shore, Dou mounted his horse and left, but the man followed closely for several miles.

Dou was puzzled and asked where he was going. The man replied, “I am not human; I am a messenger from the Ghost City of Fengdu, now hastening to Yangzhou to seize Dou Dexuan’s soul.”

Dou was terrified and quickly dismounted, bowing to the ghost envoy: “I am Dou Dexuan!” He wept and asked how to escape.

The envoy asked, “What scriptures can you recite?” Dou replied, “I often recite the Scripture of Constant Purity and Tranquility spoken by the Most High Patriarch Laozi.” The envoy said, “No wonder. I see you possess the dao’s aura, your heart is very kind and compassionate toward the poor. Thank you for the food you gave me on the boat; I cannot repay your kindness. I will bear the burden of your sins in the underworld and grant you a month’s reprieve. You must recite the Scripture of Purity and Tranquility ten thousand times within a month. Then divine beings will come to rescue you.”

After the envoy vanished, Dou devoted himself day and night to reciting the scripture without rest. After thirty days, he completed the ten thousand recitations. Returning home, he set up an incense altar to continue chanting. Then the envoy appeared again and said, “You have completed ten thousand recitations, but your lifespan has ended. Because of your kindness on the boat, the underworld blamed me for the delay and punished me with thirty lashes.” The envoy took off his upper garment, revealing the marks of the beating. Dou lay down in his chair and immediately passed away. His soul followed the envoy out the North Gate.

After traveling about ten miles, they saw a city overgrown with thorns. Then an official hall appeared, guarded by stern officers. The plaque above the gate read “Northern Office of Fengdu.” The envoy said, “Please wait here; I will return shortly.”

Soon the envoy came out and said, “Because of your scripture merit, the Jade Emperor has sent an imperial decree. The Great Emperor of Fengdu is very pleased.”

At that moment, an official in purple robes came forth, grasped Dou’s hand, and led him into the hall. The Great Emperor of Fengdu held a cold jade tablet; before the incense altar lay a purple clay edict glowing with golden light. The emperor accepted the edict, and the envoy led Dou to bow and pay respects. The emperor said, “You truly are a man of supreme virtue! Since childhood you have recited the Scripture of Purity and Tranquility, performed good deeds widely, and Heaven has already recorded your name. Today, due to your scripture merit, all punishments for sinners in Fengdu’s hell are reduced by one grade. Moreover, your lifespan is extended by one cycle of twelve years. Now the envoy will send you back.” Dou bowed and thanked the Great Emperor, who also bowed and returned the salute.

The envoy led Dou into a golden hall, where Dou suddenly revived. He saw his family weeping around him, saying, “You have been dead for three days.” Reflecting on the events, Dou realized the truth of the great dao and that misfortune had turned to blessing. He then became a Daoist at Jingling Temple, cultivating the path of purity and tranquility.

After twelve years, a purple cloud appeared, descending from the sky. Dou saw a youth in emerald robes leading two white cranes. They alighted in his courtyard. The youth said, “Today is your day of ascension. Please mount the crane’s back!”

Dou mounted the crane and rose slowly to the heavens. After his ascension, the courtyard was filled with a strange fragrance that lingered for over a month. Before ascending, Dou composed a poem:

Human affairs are tangled in myriad ways,  
Chasing fame and profit is unbearable to behold.  
Strive to awaken to this purity and tranquility,  
When merit is full, ascend as a celestial official.

## Four: Reciting Scripture Resolves Grievances—Lost Souls Born to Heaven

Song Zhixuan of Fangzhou was an assistant officer in Qingzhou. Once arriving at a place, people told him that the house was uninhabitable, haunted by ghosts that often caused mischief, and that six or seven out of ten who lived there died. Zhixuan, a devout Daoist with upright conduct, had long loved reciting the Scripture of Constant Purity and Tranquility spoken by the Most High Patriarch Laozi, deeply understanding its meaning and practicing it faithfully. He did not believe in such specters. He said to the people, “I will live here; what ghost can harm me?” Resolute, he settled in and wrote a poem of Master Lü for all to see:

A single golden elixir ensures longevity,  
One must refine true lead with Jia and Geng.  
Fire seeks the southern red phoenix marrow,  
Water seeks the northern black turtle essence.  
The cauldron pursues the earth of the four seasons,  
The medicine follows the Three Origins and Eight Trigrams’ course.  
Fasting and merit complete the nine transformations,  
Hold purity and tranquility lightly—ghosts and spirits tremble.

That night, Zhixuan sat upright, circulating qi and practicing merit. The room glowed red as he silently recited the Scripture of Purity and Tranquility. At the second watch, suddenly a woman appeared before him, hair disheveled, face stained with blood. Zhixuan asked, “Who are you?” The woman said, “I am the ghost who came before to voice grievances.”

She knelt and wept, saying, “This is truly my blessing! Today I meet a man of the dao who can hear my tale of injustice. Ten years ago, I was the wife of Liu, an officer. My husband was sent on a mission abroad and never returned. His brother forced me into illicit relations; I would rather die than comply, so I was killed. My corpse was thrown into the filthy latrine at the northwest corner of the hall. Whenever someone lives here, I try to tell my grievance and ask for justice. But they lack the dao’s aura; seeing me, most are terrified and die. You recite the Scripture of Purity and Tranquility with great merit. Please show mercy and seek justice for me!”

Zhixuan said, “I have just arrived here as an official, serving less than three days. I will find a way to help you. Please return for now.” The woman vanished.

Three days later, Zhixuan ordered digging several feet in the latrine’s northwest corner but found no corpse. That night, he sat again, burning incense and reciting the scripture. Before the second watch, the woman’s ghost appeared again. Zhixuan asked, “I had people dig as you said but found nothing. Why?” She said, “Dig two feet further north; there lies my corpse.”

The next day, they unearthed a body there. Zhixuan recited scripture to aid her soul, wrapped the corpse in clean clothes, and chose a burial place.

That night, the woman appeared again, clean and free of blood stains, bowing to thank Zhixuan by the lamp.

Zhixuan asked, “Since you were murdered, why not seek revenge?” She said, “The man who killed me is an official in Jiangzhou. He has recited the Scripture of Purity and Tranquility since childhood. I have appealed in the underworld for many years but to no avail.”

Zhixuan said, “I will tell him to fast, build offerings, write yellow registers and white slips, and perform rites to help you ascend to heaven. Will that relieve your grievance?”

She bowed again, saying, “Thank you so much!” and vanished.

Zhixuan took leave, prepared funds, and hastened to Jiangzhou to meet Liu. He told Liu the full story, saying, “You are an official; how could you do such a thing? I hear you recite the Scripture of Purity and Tranquility, showing a dao heart. Yet you commit such evil. Have you not heard: ‘The law of officials punishes openly; the gods punish secretly’? If you do not repent, your grievance will never end!”

Liu was shocked and said, “Thank you for coming so far to relieve my grievance. How dare I oppose your kindness!” He then lavishly funded a seven-day, seven-night Huanglu grand offering with over one hundred Daoists. He also printed ten thousand copies of the Scripture of Constant Purity and Tranquility, distributing them widely.

At noon that day, a woman appeared, leading a fine horse bearing ten thousand scriptures on its back. She said, “By the merit of scriptures and offerings, under the Most High Patriarch Laozi’s decree, I enter the Zhu Ling celestial palace to refine my primordial spirit and become an immortal of the Southern Palace. I lived long in the world; soon, Officer Song will also become immortal.” Saying this, she ascended to heaven.

Zhixuan and Liu became dao friends, jointly upholding the sacred true Dao. After returning home, Zhixuan saw a blue phoenix bird before his gate. He immediately burned incense, bathed, and rode the blue phoenix to ascend.

Zhixuan left a poem:

In the next life, pure and quiet, I grasp the true scripture,  
Removing sins, aiding the weak, escaping punishment.  
Today, riding on the power of merit,  
I refine spirit and form in the Zhu Ling palace.

## Five: Reciting Scripture and Fasting—Cultivating the Dao to Become Immortal

Yuan Tong of the Tang dynasty, from Tianshui, loved Daoism from childhood and devotedly recited the Scripture of Constant Purity and Tranquility spoken by the Most High Patriarch Laozi, reciting forty-nine times daily. At twenty, he was conscripted by An Lushan but escaped alone after the army’s defeat. Lost in the mountains without food, exhausted, he silently recited the scripture. When too weak to continue, he closed his eyes, awaiting death.

Suddenly, a youth in emerald robes appeared, holding a bowl of rice. The rice was filled with an indescribable fragrance.

After eating, the youth said, “The true man nurtures his pure stomach with pure qi; ordinary people nourish their impure stomach with filth. The true man circulates qi to nourish spirit, keeping body and mind peaceful; ordinary people indulge desires and chaos, thinking themselves happy. You have loved the sacred dao since youth and persevered in practice, reciting the Scripture of Constant Purity and Tranquility, already possessing great dao merit. The Most High Patriarch Laozi sent me to bring you divine medicine. From now on, cultivate the sacred dao with divine qi and never again need earthly food. Your name has been removed from the black book of death and registered in the Zhu Ling palace of longevity. The path of purity and tranquility is truly not empty!” After speaking, he vanished.

From then on, Yuan Tong no longer ate, gaining six supernatural powers and wisdom. He lived into the reign of Song Zhezong, appearing no older than thirty over five hundred years. Often seen roaming near the Luo River, he only recited the Scripture of Purity and Tranquility. No one ever saw him eat; people called him “Master of Purity.” If anyone fell ill, no matter when, he could heal them with a touch, earning the name “Touch Healer.”

One day, outside Chongjing Gate, he sang loudly:

You seek chaos, I seek none.  
You seek impurity, I seek purity.  
You chase after things, how can you live?  
Since gaining the dao, five hundred years,  
Cutting off evil spirits’ joy.  
Riding clouds and cranes,  
To the Jade Emperor’s heavenly palace,  
Forever dwelling in the Pavilion of Leisure.

After singing, an immortal crane flew down. Yuan Tong mounted its back and rose slowly on clouds. People looked up in wonder. A paper fell from the sky, inscribed with “The Birth of the Path of Purity.”

## Six: Underworld Seeks Wife—Borrowing a Corpse to Return to Life

During the Qingli years of the Tang dynasty, an official surnamed Han guarded Yunzhou. He had a twenty-six-year-old daughter married to Wang Jian, a high official. Han’s wife was pregnant and living at her parents’ home. At the third watch of night, strange sounds came from the northwest corner of the hall. All the maids slept, but Han’s wife could not.

Suddenly, a general appeared, clad in battle armor and holding a golden spear. He said, “I am General Wei of the Jin dynasty, dwelling here for centuries. You dare make this your birthing chamber; the bloodstained qi offends me. If you do not move within three days, I will kill you. Remember this.” Han’s wife said, “I will move.” The general vanished.

Next morning, Han’s wife told the maids to inform Han. Han said, “Women often suffer from weak qi and hallucinations. How could this be true?” He refused to move her, adding more maids to care for her.

At the third watch the next night, the general appeared again, seen by the maids who fled in terror. The general angrily said, “I warned you early; why do you not leave? If I find you here tomorrow, I will kill you!” Han’s wife pleaded, “Please calm your anger; I will move tomorrow.” The general disappeared.

Next morning, the maids told Han what happened. Han said, “A woman not yet seven days postpartum cannot move. These are hallucinations from weak blood qi.” The maids insisted they saw it. Han scolded them as superstitious and refused to move her.

That night, the general appeared again, saying, “I warned you thrice, yet you do not leave.” Han’s wife and the maids said, “We told Han, but he stubbornly refuses.” The general, enraged, stabbed Han’s wife’s heart with the golden spear. She cried out and died. Han heard the scream, grabbed a sword, and ran over. The parents mourned deeply and wrote to her husband. Wang Jian, hearing the news, was grief-stricken and hurried home. Ten miles west of Sizhuang Town, he saw a woman approaching. Drawing near, he recognized her as his wife.

Wang Jian dismounted and asked, “Why are you here?” His attendants saw the dead wife. She said, “I was killed by General Wei of the Jin dynasty. Here I cannot appeal my grievance. You, as husband, cannot even protect your wife.” She wept. Wang Jian was sorrowful and tried to embrace her, but she said, “The paths of humans and ghosts differ; do not come near. I heard there is a Master Tian in this town who recites the Scripture of Constant Purity and Tranquility, cultivating the path of tranquility and non-action, able to communicate with the divine and possessing heavenly virtue. You must seek Master Tian to save me from the netherworld!”

Wang Jian found Master Tian in town and told him the story. Tian said, “Very well, I will pray to Heaven and Earth to rescue your wife.” He led Wang Jian to a quiet chamber. At the first watch, Tian donned court robes, held a jade tablet, burned incense, lit seven lamps, knelt before the light, and chanted prayers.

Suddenly, a heavenly warrior appeared, saying, “I bring the Jade Emperor’s decree. You may take this talisman to the underworld.” He placed the talisman and vanished. Tian said, “With the Jade Emperor’s decree, I shall accompany you to Fengdu to capture General Wei.”

Tian laid a clean mat for Wang Jian to lie on. Instantly, Wang Jian fainted, his soul gradually leaving his body. Tian sat nearby, meditating, his primordial spirit departing to guide Wang Jian’s soul. After traveling several miles, they saw a great city shrouded in dusk, guarded by many armored soldiers wielding weapons. Upon seeing Tian, they saluted and welcomed him.

Inside, a red-clad messenger urgently reported, and dozens more showed reverence, whispering, “Master Tian has arrived in the underworld.” Soon, a youth in green robes bearing ceremonial instruments stood in formation. The Great Emperor of Fengdu appeared. All bowed to Master Tian. The ghost envoy asked Wang Jian, “Who are you to come to the underworld?” Wang Jian said, “I am Master Tian’s attendant.” The envoy ceased questioning.

In the hall, Tian presented the Jade Emperor’s decree to Fengdu’s Great Emperor. Wang Jian and the ghost officials bowed. Soon, a blue-clad youth announced, “The warrior Youyi is dispatched to capture the Jin dynasty ghost General Wei.” They saw a man in golden chainmail and a precious sword leave on command. Moments later, the envoy reported, “General Wei has been captured.” The emperor ordered, “Bring him before the hall.”

Ghost soldiers dragged a man forward. The emperor said, “You are a century-old ghost who killed many in life and did not repent, now harming the living.” Wei said, “I warned her repeatedly; she refused to leave. In anger, I killed her. Please forgive me for my past merits.” The emperor said, “You dare kill even as a ghost—what merits do you claim? You shall receive three hundred lashes and be exiled to the Northern Yin Mountain, to be released after one thousand years.” The soldiers pinned him down and beat him with iron rods three hundred times. His cries were unbearable. Afterward, a ghost official said, “By the Great Emperor’s decree, you are sent to Yin Mountain.”

The emperor asked where Han’s wife’s soul was. Ghost soldiers brought her before the hall. The envoy said, “Her body is destroyed. She may borrow another’s corpse to return to life.” The judge checked the records: Han’s wife should live to sixty-six, with forty years remaining. The daughter of the Qingzhou county official Wang, Shouniang, died at twenty-six and could lend her body to Han’s wife.

The Great Emperor of Fengdu granted passage and bade Master Tian and Wang Jian return. Suddenly Wang Jian awoke. Tian said, “Keep this matter secret!” Wang Jian bowed deeply and asked, “How can you roam the underworld so freely?” Tian said, “I recite the Scripture of Constant Purity and Tranquility. By faithfully following it, one unites with Heaven and Earth’s virtue. The scripture says: ‘If one can always be pure and tranquil, all under Heaven will return.’ After you return, hurry to Qingzhou to claim your wife.”

Wang Jian bade farewell. On the way, Han’s wife revived. Three days after Shouniang’s death, she suddenly came back to life, saying, “I am Han’s daughter. My father is now the governor of Yunzhou.” Before finishing, Wang Jian arrived at Wang’s residence. Shouniang saw him and said, “My husband Wang has come!” Her voice was unlike before. Wang explained the matter to Wang’s official. They went to Yunzhou to visit Han’s parents; her voice was exactly as before. Both suddenly realized the great dao’s truth. They gave away all their wealth, printed over one hundred thousand copies of the Scripture of Purity and Tranquility, and distributed them widely. They also initiated a grand Luotian offering to thank Heaven and Earth.

Afterward, Wang Jian and his wife visited Master Tian in Sizhuang Town to express thanks. Tian said, “You may cultivate together.” Wang followed his advice, resigned his post, exchanged his official robes, and became a Daoist at Fude Temple in Chang’an. His wife became a female Daoist at Yujing Temple. Both lived to one hundred and twenty years, passing peacefully without illness.

## Seven: Greed’s Insatiability—Purity Dissolves It

During the Tang dynasty, Emperor Yizong had a daughter, Princess Tongchang, married to Wei the Imperial Son-in-Law. The princess found the palace uncomfortable, so the emperor granted her a residence more splendid than the palace itself, with golden towers and jade pavilions. He also bestowed five million strings of treasury coins. Yet the princess remained dissatisfied, complaining that her home lacked treasures.

The emperor then gave her all the palace treasures, refurbishing her residence with gold railings, jade water basins, gem-inlaid golden basins, silver-wire birdcages, crystal and colored-glass beds and tables. Still unsatisfied, she said there was no food.

The emperor supplied fine rice and flour from the treasury. The princess then said, “The house lacks curtains and canopies.” The emperor gifted pearl curtains and a magical cold-warm medicine that warmed the house in winter and cooled it in summer. He also gave her a nine-phoenix jeweled hairpin that emitted nine-colored clouds of light when worn.

Whenever she traveled, she rode a seven-treasure carriage adorned with five-colored gems and fragrant sachets containing cold-repelling, evil-repelling, and dust-repelling scents, all foreign tributes. The carriage was covered with dazzling jewels—gold, silver, glass, crystal, agate—shaped into dragons and phoenixes, with pearl tassels hanging all around. Atop was a jade lotus with a golden pearl emitting a three-foot-high glow, surrounded by golden threads and jade pendants, naturally accompanied by celestial music.

Each outing was accompanied by fragrant winds and lingering scents lasting over half a year. Despite such wealth, the princess remained unsatisfied, thinking no earthly riches could compare to the Penglai fairyland, and fell ill. Raised in the palace, she had long and strictly recited the Scripture of Constant Purity and Tranquility. She summoned the imperial physician Mi Zong to treat her. At night, she gave Mi a two-inch-long fragrant candle to take home. The scent was intense and spread to neighbors. When asked, Mi honestly said it was the princess’s gift. The candle burned till dawn, and the fragrance lingered for hundreds of steps. The smoke formed shapes of canopies and towers, each flower wondrous.

The princess’s illness worsened. She had attendants bring the Scripture of Constant Purity and Tranquility. From a jade box, they took a precious incense called “Heaven-Connecting Fragrance,” burning it while reciting scripture. Before seven recitations, two crimson-clad envoys appeared, saying, “The Great Emperor of the Eastern Peak summons you to Mount Tai.” The princess said, “I am the emperor’s daughter; how can you take me?” She ordered attendants to seize the envoys, but they seemed invisible.

The envoys said, “This concerns the underworld; your royal status matters not.” They lifted the princess and carried her out, as if through the northern gate of Chang’an. After several miles, the princess said her feet hurt and could go no further. One envoy said, “I will bring a horse.” Soon, a white horse was led. They traveled over a hundred miles in darkness to a great city where people moved about. The princess said, “I am hungry.” The envoy replied, “Food here melts into fiery coals that burn the viscera. Do not look.”

They saw dozens of naked men and women being branded with red-hot iron by hell’s officers, blood flowing, turning them into bloody mud. A wind blew, and they were restored, only to be tortured again. The princess closed her eyes in fear and asked an officer, “What sins cause such punishment?” The officer said, “These people lived in excessive luxury and never knew contentment.” The princess gasped, “What of me?” The officer said, “You are the same.”

Soon, a horned officer holding an iron hammer ordered the princess to undress. She said, “I am the emperor’s daughter; how dare you?” The officer said, “Here, no matter your status, strip quickly.” Reluctantly, she removed her crown and clothes, silently reciting the Scripture of Constant Purity and Tranquility. The officer impatiently urged, “Hurry!” She recited as she removed garments. Suddenly, the officer tore her clothes, and her body felt as if frying in hot oil. She urgently recited until the passage on “Three Poisons Eliminated,” when a golden light appeared. The officers bowed to the sky as a true immortal descended on purple clouds—it was the Supreme Daoist Master Ge Xianweng.

The immortal said, “In the Supreme Pure Palace, I heard one reciting the Scripture of Constant Purity and Tranquility in the underworld. From the first scroll, the Three Pure Ones and sages knew. The Most High Patriarch Laozi ordered me to descend to the nether hell and pardon sinners who recite the scripture.” The princess bowed deeply, saying, “I am the daughter of Emperor Yizong of Tang.” The immortal asked, “What sin caused your descent?” The officers said, “Greed.”

Soon, the Great Emperor of Fengdu arrived with many underworld officers, bowing to Ge Xianweng, whose radiance illuminated the dark hell.

Ge Xianweng said to the princess, “Do not indulge excessive desire. The Most High says: ‘No sin is greater than desire.’ Desire is the root of licentiousness. Also: ‘No sin is greater than greed.’ Greed breeds jealousy. The sin of greed is the gravest—small sins ruin the body; great sins destroy families. Those who do not understand the dao fail to grasp purity’s principle and the importance of calmness for health. They feast on delicacies and wear fine clothes, but these pleasures are daggers harming life. They think themselves rich and honored but sow disaster.

How can those who commit evil avoid hell? Knowing hell’s suffering, why not live by the void and tranquil dao, practicing kindness, loyalty, filial piety, harmony, caution, and gentleness? Purity unites with the dao. Do not crave luxury; hold to simplicity. Luxury causes hell; thrift is the root of heaven.”

The immortal asked, “If I save you from hell, can you abandon your love of luxury?” The princess bowed repeatedly, “I can.”

He said, “I have five precepts, ten virtues, six fasts, three assemblies, five annual observances, and five taboos. Can you uphold them?” She said, “I can.”

He said, “Those who uphold them may become heavenly officials; those who do not become lower ghosts.”

“The five precepts are: first, do not kill; second, do not indulge desire; third, do not speak falsehood; fourth, do not steal; fifth, do not commit licentiousness.”

“The ten virtues are: first, filial care for parents; second, loyalty and respect to rulers and teachers; third, forget selfishness and benefit all beings; fourth, restrain anger and improper thoughts; fifth, cease disputes and end hostility; sixth, sacrifice self-interest to aid the poor; seventh, constantly consider how to benefit others; eighth, plant trees by roads and wells for public good; ninth, act to benefit all and suppress evil; tenth, praise and recite the three treasures of dao, scripture, and teachers, explain to others, and always cultivate good thoughts.”

“Those who practice these will be protected by heavenly beings, forever free from calamity, and gain lasting blessings. The key is perseverance and sincere cultivation.”

The princess asked, “What are the six fasts?”

The immortal answered, “The first, eighth, fourteenth, fifteenth, twenty-ninth, and thirtieth days of each month.”

She asked, “What are the ten fasts?”

He said, “The first, eighth, fourteenth, fifteenth, eighteenth, twenty-third, twenty-fourth, twenty-eighth, twenty-ninth, and thirtieth days. These ten days honor the Heavenly Venerable of Great Unity, who saves all suffering souls in the three hells.”

She asked, “What are the three assemblies?”

He said, “The seventh day of the first month is the upper assembly; the seventh day of the seventh month is the middle assembly; the fifth day of the tenth month is the lower assembly.”

She asked, “What are the five annual observances?”

He said, “The first day of the first month is the Heavenly observance; the fifth day of the fifth month is the Earthly observance; the seventh day of the seventh month is the Dao and Virtue observance; the fifth day of the tenth month is the People’s Year observance; the twelfth month is the Nobles’ observance.”

She asked, “What are the five taboos?”

He said, “First, the day of Jiazi, when the True Lord Taiyi records human sins; second, the day of Gengshen, when the Three Corpses report sins to Heaven; third, one’s birth day, when the Northern Dipper officials record merits; fourth, the eight solar terms, when gods record good and evil; fifth, the three origins days, when Heaven, Earth, and Water officials record sins and blessings.”

Ge Xianweng said, “On these days, one may hold offerings, fast, chant scriptures, make abundant offerings, and pray for blessings.”

The princess bowed again, “I will remember and follow all the great dao’s admonitions.”

Then the immortal radiated bright light, illuminating the underworld. All sinful souls ascended to heaven. Finally, he called a blue-robed youth to lead the princess back to life. The immortal ascended to heaven. The Great Emperor of Fengdu and all underworld spirits rejoiced.

The blue-robed youth led the princess to a golden gate and pushed her inside. She suddenly awoke, lying on a jade bed covered with embroidered quilts. Her husband and palace attendants wept beside her.

She sat up. The attendants said, “Princess, you have slept long; we dared not disturb you.” She said, “Wealth is like a lamp in stone, honor like leaves floating on water, and time like a dream of the southern branch.”

Her illness vanished. Dressed in court robes, she entered the palace to report to the emperor, returning all treasures to the treasury and requesting to become a Daoist. The emperor, surprised, asked why. She recounted the underworld events. The emperor rejoiced and approved her ordination, converting the Golden Immortal Temple of Chongxian Lane into the Jade True Temple.

Since entering the temple, she never left. Though nobles, relatives, and her husband came to visit, she had the gates guarded and saw no one. She daily recited the Scripture of Constant Purity and Tranquility without neglect.

Three years later, she saw Ge Xianweng again in a red light. The immortal said, “Your day of ascension nears. Hurry to cultivate your merit.” Then he vanished. She initiated a Huanglu grand offering. On the night of the Lantern Festival, a phoenix and crane descended from heaven. The moon shone bright as a painting, fragrant winds blew. The phoenix landed in the courtyard; the princess rode it, ascending slowly. She left a poem titled “Tang Duoling”:

Life and fate—how to manage both?  
Do not indulge excessively in luxury.  
Guard chastity, health, thrift, peace, and harmony,  
Be upright and kind to avoid calamity.  
Alas, fate is fleeting, little is precious.  
Break the nest of disputes, unlock the chains of fame and profit.  
Clear your heart and grasp your nature, though time slips away,  
Reflect on highs and lows, joys and sorrows.  
Awaken sharply, as if a fleeting dream.

People praised the princess’s attainment, copying her poems and competing to honor her in the capital.

## Eight: The Numinous Pill of Purity—Venus’s Response

In the Southern Song, Prime Minister Yuan Tian was very greedy. Whenever court affairs arose, large or small, he demanded money first. One day in the market, two men drunkenly fought, killing one. Yuan said to the killer, “If you pay one thousand bolts of silk, I can guarantee you will not be sentenced to death.” The man paid eight hundred bolts. Yuan said, “Then I can do nothing; you will surely die.”

The victim’s family offered one thousand bolts to save the killer. Fearful, the killer gave Yuan one thousand two hundred bolts. The victim’s family could not bribe Yuan further. Yuan ruled the killing accidental due to drunkenness, sparing death but ordering sixty lashes.

Yuan oppressed the people with no recourse for justice. He amassed wealth, building mansions adorned with thousands of pounds of gold, silver, and jewels, surpassing even the emperor’s residence. The gardens were filled with beauties. Meals cost hundreds of strings of coins.

Yuan lived in luxury and loved alchemy, seeking more wealth. One day, a Daoist appeared at his door, claiming to know the art of turning stone into gold. Yuan eagerly invited him in. Yuan respectfully asked, “What arts can you teach me?” The Daoist said, “Bring me some wine first.” Yuan said, “If you cannot show true skill, why ask for wine? Your desire is too strong.” The Daoist said, “You plunder the people, oppress them, own thousands of houses, treasure-filled vaults, thousands of beauties, and indulge lust. Yet you accuse me of desire? How laughable.”

Yuan was angered and ordered guards to seize the Daoist, who vanished, leaving a poem titled “Dian Jiang Chun”:

Wealth, honor, high rank, and great merit,  
All arise from greed and desire.  
When family fortunes are made,  
The King of Hell awaits.  
What to do? How to resolve it?  
No one escapes debts owed.

Yuan was troubled and returned alone to his small tower, falling asleep. In a dream, he saw a piece of gold and rejoiced. Reaching for it, he suddenly fell off a cliff into darkness. After a long time, light appeared. He secretly watched hundreds wearing shackles and irons, many ghost soldiers pressing heavy stones on them.

A sign read: “Prison of Greed and Desire.” Suddenly, a white-clad figure with disheveled hair approached: “Prime Minister Yuan, you are late! We have awaited you.” Yuan asked, “Who are you?” The man said, “I am the one killed drunk in the market! You took one thousand two hundred bolts of silk to spare his life. Now you must repay me!” Yuan was terrified, tried to flee but was held fast, pressed under a giant stone three zhang long and five chi thick. People pulled his limbs to crush him. Suddenly a voice shouted, “Stop! This man’s life is not yet due. He has six years of life remaining. Release him for now!”

Yuan turned to see the Daoist who had shown the gold-making art. The Daoist sat with him on the stone and said, “I am Venus, the Great White Metal Star from above. You hold a high office but do not cultivate virtue, only satisfy desires. This is the root of disaster!” Yuan said, “Thanks for your rescue. I will never forget it!” The Daoist asked, “Have you recited any scriptures?” Yuan said, “I have recited the Scripture of Constant Purity and Tranquility.” The Daoist said, “No wonder you are surrounded by dao qi. The scripture’s power far exceeds mine. Have you not heard: ‘One can always dismiss desire and the heart will be tranquil; clear the heart and the spirit will be pure’? Listen carefully.”

“Sounds, sights, and pleasures tempt the senses; fragrances and delicacies tempt nose and tongue; comfort tempts the body—all arise from desire. If desire is not dismissed, the spirit wanders, ambition fades, and the five viscera suffer. Those indulging sensory pleasures live in confusion, unaware of harm, mistaking suffering for joy.”

“Few can turn back and preserve life. The sage calmly avoids distractions, silences the mouth, abandons false thoughts, and calamity naturally ceases. The sage preserves life and disregards external things. Thus the sage has great power but does not show it. The poor and those clinging to wealth live in fear of loss, unable to live freely and joyfully.”

“The great dao is void and natural, a vast true qi. If one loves life, the dao nature is preserved. If the heart does not chase externals, the dao naturally appears. Remember these words, prime minister!”

Yuan thanked the Daoist and left. Suddenly, the man he had killed appeared, chasing him. Yuan fainted, then awoke sweating and heart pounding—it was all a dream.

He realized wealth is the root of disaster and desire the root of sin. He resigned, opened granaries to feed the poor, sent maids home or married them off, and donated his mansions to build temples.

He shed fine robes for coarse cloth, lived simply, reciting the Scripture of Constant Purity and Tranquility persistently for ten years. One day, he dreamed of the Daoist who had taught him. Yuan bowed. The Daoist said, “You have cultivated for over ten years, rare indeed. Your debts are cleared but you have not yet attained the dao.”

“The true dismissal of desire and greed is the immortal’s clear spirit and tranquil nature. Your name is now in the celestial palace of Zhu Ling. I give you a numinous pill; take it now.”

Yuan took the pill. The Daoist said, “From now on, you will not hunger or need earthly food. The Inner Transmission of the Immortal Scripture says: ‘If eating does not cease, the body will not be light; if sensual pleasures do not cease, the spirit will not be clear; if thoughts do not cease, the heart will not be peaceful; without peace, the spirit is not clear; without clear spirit, dao merit cannot be achieved.’ The key is not to torture the body but to keep the heart pure and clear. This is the path of immortals and ensures longevity. Thus, cultivation is cultivation of the heart.”

“The Most High Patriarch Laozi says: ‘The dao is realized by the heart; the heart is enlightened by the dao. When the heart is clear, the great dao naturally descends; when the dao descends, the spirit is within oneself.’ Like an oil lamp illuminating a room—the light comes from the flame, the flame from the wick, the wick from the oil, the oil from the lamp. Without lamp, oil, wick, and flame, whence comes the light?”

“Likewise, the dao depends on spirit to be numinous, spirit depends on the heart for peace. With heart, the dao is fulfilled. Without spirit, body, or heart, where does the great dao attach? The spirit is divine because it perceives, hears, knows, and feels, discerning the mysteries of life. Remember this well. One day we shall meet in the Zhu Ling palace.” Then the Daoist vanished.

Yuan followed the Daoist’s teachings, cultivating the interplay of dragon and tiger, yin and yang, the Five Phases’ separation and union, and the mutual completion of water and fire. He built a special chamber for cultivation. After three years, on the ninth day of the ninth month’s Double Ninth Festival, Yuan’s merit was complete; he soared into the sky. People opened the chamber door but found him gone, only a Scripture of Purity and Tranquility and a poem titled “Sending to Tang Duoling” remained:

Life and fate—how to manage both?  
The root and source tightly locked.  
Guard the yang soul, the yin soul fades,  
Circulate fire through heaven to cook the great medicine.  
Look beneath the sea, see the red waves.  
Nobles and commoners pass briefly,  
Glory and wealth like a tossed shuttle.  
When three thousand merits are fulfilled,  
Ride the phoenix and dragon to the azure realm,  
Attend the Jade Emperor, respond to the immortal exam.

## Nine: Tai Mountain’s Judgment—Purity Removes Faults

In the Tang dynasty’s Zhenguan years, an official named Shen Hui was very greedy, often plundering the people. Later investigated, he was exiled to Zhulan. He recited the Scripture of Constant Purity and Tranquility from dawn till dusk. After reciting, he faced Tai Mountain, bowed, prayed, and vowed: “Great Virtuous Heavenly Lord, please hear me. I have no other wish but to return home.”

The son of the Tai Mountain lord, named Bingling Gong, was visiting Mount Hua and heard Shen reciting the scripture. In the void, he said, “This man is rare!” Returning to Tai Mountain, he told his father. The lord said, “Good indeed!” He sent messengers to summon Shen to a side chamber of Tai Mountain’s office.

At noon, Shen sat upright when a red-clad official came, saying, “The lord summons you.” Shen asked, “Which lord?” The official said, “The Eastern Peak lord.” Shen was alarmed, quickly dressed, and followed. They traveled over three thousand li. Shen asked how to arrive faster. The official said, “I will borrow a thousand-li horse here.” Shen waited under a tree as the official entered a temple and soon returned with a small green steed, about the size of a donkey. The official said, “Ride and keep your eyes closed.” Shen mounted, closed his eyes, and felt the horse race like the wind.

When told to open his eyes, Shen saw a city surrounded by thorns. They reached an official hall guarded by iron-armored soldiers. The official told Shen to dismount and enter. Guards asked, “Who goes there? The lord orders only the third gate may be used.” The official said, “Wait here; I will report.” Soon a messenger came, saying, “The lord wishes to see you.” Shen hurried inside to a jeweled hall called “Palace of Morning Radiance,” with pearl curtains and crimson drapes. Guards in golden armor stood by.

Two green-robed youths lifted curtains to reveal a man seated centrally, wearing a distant travel crown and a blue dragon-embroidered robe, holding a cold jade tablet. Beside him stood a man about thirty, wearing a golden hat and blue jade belt. He asked the youths to invite Shen up. Shen trembled, barely daring to move. The youths helped him ascend, and Shen bowed deeply.

The lord returned the bow slightly and had attendants offer seats. He said, “All who do evil, if not killed by others, are harmed by ghosts. You were punished and exiled for greed. Your merit from reciting the Scripture of Constant Purity and Tranquility over ten thousand times in one year allows you to meet me. The Heavenly Emperor has advised me not to let you return to the cycle of rebirth. You can recite the scripture by heart. If you understand and act by its principles, teaching others, your merit will grow. Then, if you cannot become a higher immortal, you may become a god; if not a god, a terrestrial immortal; if not a terrestrial immortal, a ghost immortal. You will no longer enter the cycle of birth and death.”

After speaking, a red-clad ghost official spread a scroll on the desk. “Mu Rengui seeks audience; he is your uncle.” Shen turned away, unwilling to look. The lord said to Mu, “Greatest harm is desire, greatest disaster is greed, greatest sin is killing. You have all three. How can you be pardoned?”

Two ghost soldiers brought an iron bed before the hall and ordered Mu to strip. Before he finished, needles pricked his face, burning half of it. His clothes were removed, and he was pressed onto the iron bed, nailed down, and the bed was heated by fire beneath. The scene was horrific. Mu lay on the bed, soon burned to charred ash. A ghost soldier fanned him, restoring his body, then shackled him.

Shen stood and asked, “This man is my uncle. Can he be saved?” The lord said, “He who wrongfully harms others cannot be pardoned.” Bingling Gong said, “Only if the wronged woman agrees, or if great merit is accumulated in the world and prayers offered to the myriad saints and true ones, or if the Most High Patriarch Laozi issues an edict allowing the wronged to ascend, can pardon be granted.”

Shen said, “If I can help Mu abandon his past errors, eliminate his six desires and three poisons, hold the Luotian grand offering and the heavenly pardon rites, and help the wronged woman Zhao ascend, can Mu be spared suffering?” The lord said, “Yes. Mu has five years left. His two souls are in the underworld bearing punishment; one soul guards his body, which is covered in sores and pain. After five years, his life ends. After punishment, he will reincarnate as pig or sheep, or human, and suffer death again.”

Hearing this, Shen recited the Scripture of Constant Purity and Tranquility. Its radiance shook the underworld. The lord feared the scripture’s power would break hell’s barriers and said, “You may return. Do not harbor greed or the three poisons. Thank Heaven for pardoning you. When home, persuade Mu to reduce greed. That will suffice.” An official said, “I will escort Shen back.” They left the hall, crossed a river. The official shouted, and Shen awoke, sweating cold. His family mourned him, saying, “You have been dead three days; only your heart still beats.”

Shen looked to the sky, saying, “Truly there are ghosts and gods!” He told all, “No more greed!” He then persuaded Mu to repent. Mu, bedridden with sores and pain for three months, said, “A month ago, I dreamed you saved me.” He recounted the underworld events and repented. He held a Luotian grand offering, printed ten thousand copies of the Scripture of Constant Purity and Tranquility, and distributed them to faithful believers. He also held scripture recitation ceremonies, accumulating merit.

One noon after a vegetarian meal, a woman appeared from the sky to thank him: “Thanks for the grand offering that allowed me to ascend to heaven.” She left a poem:

Years of grievance unavenged,  
Today you hold the offering feast.  
Six desires and three poisons all extinguished,  
By merit ascending to the azure sky.

Shen bowed to the sky in thanks.

Within half a month, Mu’s sores healed, and he regained health. Shen advised him with a poem from “Full Court Fragrance”:

Sharp wit is less than earnestness,  
Do not add to six desires and three poisons.  
After gathering nectar from a hundred flowers,  
Who knows for whom the sweetness is bitter?

Shen said, “Time flies like lightning; how can one not cultivate?” He clenched his fist and wept aloud. Both understood the dao and abandoned worldly affairs, resigning posts to build a humble hut on Mount Tiantai. There, they recited the Scripture of Constant Purity and Tranquility three hundred times daily. Both attained immortality in their nineties.

## Ten: Accumulating Merit by Reciting Scripture—Blessings and Peace

In the Tang dynasty, there was a man named Liu Huaizhen, styled Daoyu. In the second year of Taiping, he was appointed governor of Leling in Hejian. Upon arrival, he was greedy, accepting bribes of two to three million strings and showing no mercy. He often extorted the people but did no good. The people lamented and hated him, saying, “Poor and suffering, better to meet the white-tufted tiger of the southern mountains than Liu Huaizhen.”

The people suffered greatly! Later, he was appointed governor of Dingzhou in Hebei. The people worried. Liu’s wife said, “You have earned enough. Now that you are a first-rank official and a regional lord, how long will you live? Why not cultivate merit for the next life?” Liu asked how to cultivate merit. His wife said, “Officials’ good fortune comes from many lifetimes of accumulation. If you do not cultivate merit now, your faults will affect future lives. If you cultivate merit now, you will be wealthy and honored in the next life.” Liu agreed.

His wife said, “In my dressing room are treasures worth over one million in gold and silver. Do not use the people’s money. Use these to build temples and Daoist halls, recruit twenty or thirty monks and Daoists, provide for their meals and needs. First, you gain merit; second, you accumulate future wealth; third, the state and people see your good deeds; fourth, you do not use the people’s money and gain their praise. This is the way to preserve oneself and accumulate merit.”

Liu was pleased and bought over thirty acres and timber, choosing an auspicious day to build temples. It took two years to complete, including a treasure hall, three scripture pavilions, and a dharma hall with sacred images.

Liu and his wife burned incense daily, sought blessings, and bought five qing of land for permanent residence, spending over one million strings. Though the project did not use public funds, he still secretly extorted the people. He could not clear his heart or dismiss desire.

One day, Liu said to his wife, “I built a blessed hall without using the people’s money, but I do not know what the future’s cause and effect will be.” She asked, “How to know?” Liu often thought discontentedly, “I have accumulated great merit and sincerely seek blessings, yet the immortals do not respond!”

One afternoon, Liu dreamed a Daoist entered his room, scolding him: “Though you built halls with your own wealth, you still extort the people. How can you expect blessings? You are a first-rank official but greedy. These blessings have been granted to Zhang Xiaopo at Dingzhou’s south gate.” Liu asked, “Why did she receive them?” The Daoist said, “She bought grain cheaply and sold it at the same price when prices rose, never raising prices. She often recites the Scripture of Constant Purity and Tranquility, helps others, cherishes life. Her merit surpasses yours.” The Daoist vanished.

Awaking unhappy, Liu summoned Zhang Xiaogong and Zhang Xiaopo. Their deeds matched the Daoist’s words. Liu understood and resigned to cultivate the path of purity and tranquility with his wife, living simply and teaching Daoist classics like the Dao De Jing and Nanhua Jing. He lived to one hundred and twenty-nine.

## Eleven: Wealth and Honor Are Empty—The True Realm of Penglai

In the Tang dynasty, a man named Liu Zichu failed the Southern Palace imperial exam during the Dali era. Instead of reflecting on his faults, he lived wildly, frequenting brothels. Soon his money ran out, and others disliked him. He barely had enough for daily needs; his health declined.

One day, he planned to commit suicide at the east gate but failed. Sitting beneath a great willow, he silently recited the Scripture of Constant Purity and Tranquility three times, ready to die. Suddenly, a Daoist with a blue turban, white robe, and straw sandals approached, carrying a bamboo basket. The Daoist, handsome and dignified, sat beside Liu and said, “I see dao qi in you. Why such distress?”

Liu opened his eyes and was glad. He said, “I am a scholar in my prime but failed two exams by fate. I have squandered all money, have no home or food, and suffer greatly.” His breath weakened, and he collapsed. The Daoist sighed, took two jujubes from the basket, helped Liu stand, and gave him one. Liu ate and felt no hunger, bowing in thanks.

The Daoist said, “Your appearance is unusual, showing great wealth and honor.” Liu said, “But my heart is troubled. A true man’s nobility is internal; wealth is but fleeting.” The Daoist said, “I can help you attain wealth and honor. Close your eyes!” Liu closed his eyes, feeling light and drowsy.

He saw a man in purple official robes holding a jade tablet, saying he came by order of the King of Fuyu to summon Liu as son-in-law. Liu said, “I am a scholar near Yishui in Donghai County, failed twice, now alone. How can I be a prince’s son-in-law?” Liu and the envoy left the east gate, greeted by officials in embroidered robes and red boots, bowing and leading a horse with jade saddle and golden reins, surrounded by green canopies and red flags. Liu happily mounted and traveled with many attendants.

After over eight hundred li, they reached a city with sparse population and beautiful scenery. Hundreds of officials in red and purple lined up to greet him. They approached a jewel-adorned hall shrouded in mist. A rider emerged, inviting Liu to the East Hua Pavilion, where crystal-glass windows and red decorations abounded, with many beautiful women playing stringed instruments.

That night, Liu slept in the pavilion amid bells and clear moonlight. A beautiful woman came to say the princess wished to see him. Liu was delighted to meet a girl about sixteen, surpassing even Xishi and Chang’e in beauty. He married her. The next morning, the king crowned Liu Marquis of Wuan, commander of the three provinces and governor of Wuan County. Daoists, monks, and officials welcomed him.

Liu governed Wuan for ten years, had two sons, ruled justly, and gained fame. Later, he became Grand Marshal of Southern Fuyu, leading tens of thousands to victory. The emperor granted him a golden mountain. Five years later, his sons were made marquises; the family was wealthy.

Yet joy turned to sorrow. Three years later, his wife died; two years after, his sons died. Grief-stricken, he was accused of rebellion. The emperor ordered him to return. Liu dared not resist and met the emperor. The emperor said, “You were once a scholar barely surviving. I made you son-in-law and king for fifteen years. Why rebel?” Liu said, “I am a commoner grateful for your favor; I dare not rebel.” The emperor said, “Evidence is clear. What say you?” Soldiers prepared to boil Liu alive. Stripped, he begged to return to common life but was refused. As the knife approached, boiling oil bubbled. Liu screamed and suddenly awoke—it was a dream.

The Daoist asked, “Why did you faint?” Liu, sweating and trembling, told the dream. The Daoist said, “You recite the Scripture of Constant Purity and Tranquility, which says: ‘Observe the heart within the heart; the heart has no heart. Observe the form without form; form has no form. Observe things afar; things have no things. When all three are realized, only emptiness remains.’ You are a poor man with greed. Though made son-in-law, all is false, like a dream. If you seek wealth, you become king of Southern Fuyu and gain a golden mountain!” Liu suddenly understood, saying, “Life is fleeting and illusory; why lament beauty?” He bowed to the Daoist, who said, “In three years, we shall meet at Penglai. If you persist in reciting the Scripture of Constant Purity and Tranquility and do not abandon the dao heart, your wishes will be fulfilled.” Then he rode a cloud away.

Because he ate one jujube, Liu no longer hungered. He found a quiet place, built a hut, and practiced daily, avoiding worldly affairs. After three years, a white crane flew down; Liu mounted and flew away, leaving three poems.

The first, “Color is Flower’s Brightness but Not Lasting”:

Do not disdain the bright red of vain flowers,  
Their light is vain and fleeting like floating clouds.  
Better to grasp the profound principle,  
With no heart on the heart, the dao naturally flows.

The second, “Form is Illusory and Not Eternal”:

Form is empty form; do not overvalue it.  
Attachment to home and accumulated karma falls to emptiness.  
Better to grasp the profound principle,  
With no form on form, the dao naturally flows.

The third, “Things are Transient and Not Lasting”:

White jade and gold are emptiness.  
Coming empty-handed, leaving empty-handed.  
Better to grasp the profound principle,  
With no thing on things, the dao naturally flows.

## Twelve: Tested a Thousand Times—Purity Leads to Immortality

In the Tang dynasty’s Tianbao years, a scholar named Li Tong, over fifty, repeatedly failed the imperial exams. He recited the Scripture of Constant Purity and Tranquility daily, understanding many truths, always holding the scripture and chanting it even while eating and sleeping.

One day, Li Tong’s wife died; he sighed but was calm. His only son died a year later. Li said, “I have finally cast off my shackles!” He then spent days composing poetry and drinking. Friends admonished, “A wife is a lifelong companion; it is natural to grieve and be buried together. You only sigh and show little sorrow; your son’s death barely moves you. How can you be a learned man?”

Li said, “I heard that Zhuangzi beat a basin to celebrate his wife’s death and did not mourn his son’s passing. This is true understanding of the dao. Why should I grieve? The Scripture of Constant Purity and Tranquility says: ‘Observe the heart within the heart; the heart has no heart. Observe the form without form; form has no form. Observe things afar; things have no things. When all three are realized, only emptiness remains. Observe emptiness as emptiness, emptiness empties nothing; what is emptied is nothing, nothing is also nothing; nothing is nothing, serene and ever still.’ The true eternal void and stillness is the great dao. Since the great dao is true and still, what have I to sorrow?”

He gave away his property to the poor, gifted land to neighbors, and built a stone chamber on Mount Hua with straw and stones. There he recited the Scripture of Constant Purity and Tranquility daily, eating wild herbs and cultivating steadfast faith.

After three years, his dao heart remained firm, moving the Most High Patriarch Laozi to send an immortal to guide him. The immortal appeared as a Daoist, asking seven times about Li Tong’s insights. Li did not answer. The Daoist said, “Though the dao cannot be spoken, silence alone does not mean attainment. Those who boast of learning have only small arts. Cultivators must first adapt to all mundane affairs; when all are adapted, the heart will not rebel. Then sit calmly, observing the self. If a thought arises, quickly extinguish it. If the mind wanders, extinguish all.”

“The Scripture says: ‘Observe emptiness as emptiness, emptiness empties nothing; what is emptied is nothing, nothing is also nothing; nothing is nothing, serene and ever still.’ Only by emptying the mind of all things and not being bound by externals can one reach serene stillness.”

Li thanked the Daoist and asked for instruction. The Daoist said, “The key is to extinguish the restless mind and keep watch over it. Not to arise any thought is to hold ‘empty heart’ and not cling to ‘dwelling heart.’”

“Do not seek wisdom impatiently in meditation; impatience harms the nature, and damaged nature loses wisdom. If one does not seek wisdom, true wisdom comes. True wisdom is not deceit. The greatest wise appear foolish. This is the foundation of meditation and wisdom, the only path to the limitless great dao. If one thinks too much, evil arises, and demons with beautiful faces appear to confuse you according to your thoughts.”

He told Li Tong, “If you can calm your heart and maintain constant purity and tranquility, your cultivation will succeed.” Li said, “I can.”

The Daoist said, “Tomorrow I will teach you. I must leave now.” He left and vanished.

Next morning, the Daoist returned. Li welcomed him and said, “I am a dull scholar who does not understand the dao, only guarding emptiness like playing a wooden lute.” The Daoist said, “I will refine a pill; you must guard the furnace silently and keep your heart calm. Can you do this?” Li said, “I can.”

The Daoist lit the furnace, placed several pills in an iron pot, breathed on it facing the sun, and the fire blazed.

He warned, “Sit south of the furnace, deeply contemplating ‘Observe emptiness as emptiness, emptiness empties nothing; what is emptied is nothing, nothing is also nothing; nothing is nothing, serene and ever still.’ If thousands of demons come to disturb, treat them as nonexistent. If you speak or move, the pill will fail, and your dao merit will not be achieved. In three days, I will return. The pill will be complete. After we take it, we will ascend as celestial immortals. Remember my words!”

Li sat facing south, clenched fists, and meditated. Soon, dark clouds gathered, thunder roared, winds howled, and torrential rain flooded his chamber. Li did not move; water rose to his neck but did not enter the furnace or his mouth and nose. The water receded.

Then wildfires blazed across the hills, threatening to burn the chamber and Li. He sat quietly without fear or resentment. The fire died out.

Next, hungry ghosts appeared—some with blue faces and red hair, others green-faced with yellow bodies, bloodshot eyes glowing red, teeth sharp as knives. They shouted, “We are starving; eat you! If you speak, we spare you; if not, we devour you!” Li remained silent; the ghosts vanished.

Then dozens of hungry tigers came, growling and circling Li, sniffing him. Seeing no reaction, they left.

Poisonous snakes coiled around him; Li remained unmoved. After they left, a beautiful young woman entered, speaking seductively. Li stayed unmoved. After she left, thirty armored robbers burst in, wielding weapons. Their leader said, “We love to eat hearts and livers!” Raising a knife, he prepared to strike. Someone said, “If you speak, we spare him!” Li remained silent; the robbers fled.

Then a man dressed as an emperor appeared, holding a cold jade tablet, followed by a terrifying demon with an iron fork—the underworld jailer Ox-Head. He shouted, “King Yama has arrived. Why do you not rise to greet him?” He prepared to stab Li. Yama said, “Do not harm him yet. If he speaks, his punishment is lifted; if not, stab him.” Li showed no fear or movement.

Yama ordered Li’s wife brought forth. He said, “If you persuade your husband to speak, you will be spared.” His wife said, “We are deeply connected. I suffer here. If he speaks, I am saved; if not, I suffer.” Li remained silent. Yama said, “This stubborn villain, we will saw his wife in two for him to see.” The jailers sawed her, blood flowing; she cried out. Li still said nothing.

Yama ordered their son brought. He said, “I will tear your son to pieces!” The son said, “Father, you are heartless. Mother suffers because you do not speak. If you speak, I am spared.” Li remained unmoved. Yama, enraged, ordered, “Seize his soul!”

Li felt dizzy and found his soul reincarnated as the mute daughter of Wang Dalang of Qizhou, beautiful but unable to speak. At eighteen, she was married to the third son of Ma Yuanwai, who loved her despite her muteness. After three years, she bore a son. One day, her husband, drunk, said, “You bore a son but he is mute, a defect. What beauty is there?” He dragged the child by the foot, splattering blood on her face. She cried, “How bitter is my fate! My son is pitiful!”

Li suddenly opened his eyes, still in the stone chamber. The furnace glowed red, sparks flying, thunder roaring. The Daoist arrived, saying, “The pill was nearly complete but your shout ruined it. It cannot be made. ‘Observe emptiness as emptiness...’ You have not reached serene stillness.” The Daoist lamented, “What a pity! I will return in six years.”

He wrote a poem for Li:

A little study of profound principles, I ask my disciple,  
When the pill is ripe, true lead reveals colorlessness.  
The crane’s nature is carefree, soaring to the azure realm,  
The dao heart is still, revealing skill.  
Dragon’s roar and auspicious light crown the golden peak,  
Tiger’s howl and auspicious wind pierce the jade furnace.  
In six years, when merit is full,  
Serene and still, enter the immortal city.

The Daoist said, “In six years, recite the Scripture of Constant Purity and Tranquility well. Only then can you attain immortality. Remember my words!” Then he vanished as white light.

Li hung a heavy stone by a rough rope in the chamber, sitting beneath it daily, unmoving. After six years, his master appeared riding a phoenix. Li joyfully greeted and bowed. Together they flew away.

Mid-flight, Li recited:

Observing emptiness, emptiness is true emptiness,  
When emptiness is gone, nothing is also clear.  
Nothing is nothing, serene and still,  
Ride the whale’s back to the heavenly palace.

Li also composed a “Reduced-Character Magnolia” poem:

Studying books and exams, over fifty years with hair like snow.  
No name on the golden list, I believe scholars often ruin themselves.  
Wife gone, son dead, love never enters the dao.  
Deeply thank my master’s words, serene and still, ascending the Nine Heavens.

## Thirteen: Nie Churen

In the first year of the Song dynasty’s Xining era, the official Yi Prefecture had a famous doctor named Nie Churen. He was steady and handsome, in his thirties, able from youth to recite the Scripture of Constant Purity and Tranquility by heart and deeply understand its meaning. He charged all patients the same price, regardless of wealth, never asking for payment. People called him a savior from suffering.

Once, an official surnamed Huang invited him to treat his wife, a young beauty. When Nie took her pulse, she tried to seduce him. He quickly avoided her and prescribed medicine for madness, then left. Days later, she feigned illness to summon him again. Nie declined, citing other matters. She repeatedly invited him. Once, when she urgently needed treatment, Nie could not refuse.

He avoided her gaze. After examination, he said, “You are healthy; there is no illness.” She said, “My husband is away. Come tonight; I will treat you well. I dream of you every night!” Nie was shocked, understood her meaning, and left. She called after him, but he ignored her.

That night, someone knocked: “A patient is critically ill; please come quickly.” Nie opened the door; it was the woman. She grabbed him, saying, “If you agree, I will make you rich. If not, I will no longer be Huang’s wife and will die here.” Nie had no choice but to agree. He led her to a low wall, held her hand, and suddenly fled over the wall. He did not return home but went to a southern mountain, reciting the Scripture of Constant Purity and Tranquility, cultivating without desire.

The city god of Qizhou learned this and reported it to the official overseeing lifespans. Nie was granted a lifespan of one hundred and twenty years and became a god. The wife’s lifespan was reduced to fifty years. Her soul was seized by underworld jailers, causing her to be bedridden with stomach pains like knives twisting. Her soul was bound to an iron pillar and her belly cut open; her heart was washed to cleanse lust. She suffered for three years.

The jailers said, “You must endure seven years of this punishment. In three years, your three souls will descend to hell. Even if reborn, you will be born into a prostitute’s body!” She asked how to be saved. The jailers said, “You must hold Huanglu grand offerings, repent, and recite the Scripture of Constant Purity and Tranquility daily to end the punishment.” She asked, “Will this truly relieve pain?” They said, “Yes! Repent and accumulate merit, confess past lustful sins. Do the heavenly lords not speak truth? You must repent and not sin again!”

The official pitied his wife and had several Daoists hold Huanglu grand offerings, reciting the “Nine Netherworlds Sin-Removal Repentance” a thousand times, and printed ten thousand copies of the Scripture of Constant Purity and Tranquility, distributing them to believers. The heavenly immortals pardoned her, and her illness gradually healed.

She recalled her past lust causing this retribution. Many others guilty of lust suffer countless punishments. She told the official, “During Empress Wu Zetian’s reign, she illicitly consorted with monks and was sent to the snake hell.” He asked, “What punishment?” She said, “Upon entering hell, clothes and hats are stripped, and one is thrown into a pit full of poisonous scorpions that sting painfully. Only after this can clothes be worn again.” He asked, “How long does the punishment last?” She said, “One hundred years, then rebirth as a prostitute.” She urged him, “Do more good deeds and avoid evil. There is truly retribution!” He awakened.

Two:

Withdraw desire and lust will not arise,  
Cultivate purity, serene and bright.  
Stillness without stillness is Heaven’s true realm,  
It lies only in improving the human heart and conduct.
