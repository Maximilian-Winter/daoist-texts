# The Manifestations and Responsive Deeds of the Thunder God’s True Presence

According to the *Southeast Express* report: On the afternoon of August twenty-sixth, two thousand and eight, in Donghan, Fuqing, Fujian Province, a man, named Xu, who owed a debt and tried to evade payment, grasped an iron rod and swore to Heaven that if he truly owed the money, he would be struck down by thunder. Astonishingly, within a minute, he was indeed struck by lightning. Fortunately, after emergency rescue, he escaped death’s grasp. Three years prior, a friend’s wedding had taken place, during which Xu had asked Huang to cover a five hundred yuan gift on his behalf. Gradually, Xu forgot this matter, but Huang, harboring resentment, voiced complaints before mutual friends. On that afternoon, Huang came to Xu’s home wielding a wooden stick to demand repayment. Xu, clutching an iron rod, stood his ground, but out of pride refused to admit the debt. Finally, Huang declared, “If Xu dares to swear before Heaven that he owes no money, then I will forgo this sum.” Hearing this, Xu boldly swore in public, “If I truly owe money, may Heaven strike me down with thunder!” Unexpectedly, within a minute, Xu was felled by lightning! The Lianfeng border guards of Fuqing received the alarm and rushed him to the hospital. Doctors confirmed that the man had indeed been struck by lightning. They explained to the guards that the electric charge was fortunately mild, sparing Xu from fatal harm. After treatment, Xu survived the ordeal. From this incident, we learn: whispers among mortals reach the heavens like thunder; secret misdeeds are as visible as lightning to the divine eye. Every thought and intention of mortals is known and seen by Heaven, Earth, and spirits alike. Moreover, one must never rashly swear false oaths. Once a person swears, Heaven, Earth, and spirits bear witness and seal the pact. To break such a vow brings grave consequences.

In our village lived a man named Luo Jiting, a scholar of reckless temperament who disbelieved in cause and effect. He often wrote irreverent words against monks and Daoists, plastering them on walls, composing essays that refuted Buddhism and Daoism, drawing upon Han Yu and Ouyang Xiu’s expressions. Though utterly bored, he failed to awaken to his errors. In the early years of the Republic, he stayed at the Wu Family Temple in Rongzhou, teaching. Early autumn days found him leading students to fish and catch toads. One day, they caught over one hundred toads, which were placed in the kitchen. Due to urgent matters, Luo left home. His wife, Madam Zhu, unable to bear the toads’ suffering, skinned them alive and released them. When Luo returned, he beat Madam Zhu relentlessly. In her fury and despair, she hanged herself. Yet Luo’s rage did not subside; he trampled her lifeless body, cursing without end. Suddenly, dark clouds gathered, thunder roared, and a great downpour fell. After a thunderclap, the sky cleared. Luo’s body was charred yellow, his head and body severed into two parts. Madam Zhu revived and remains healthy to this day. This occurred in the first year of the Republic. At that time, I was working in Chengdu and recalled that my great-grandfather, Master Zilan, had recorded this event in a written directive. Twenty years passed, and the memory faded. Recently, my fellow townsman, Mr. Gu Yazhai, visited. We discussed how people today dismiss thunderstrikes as mere electric shocks and deny karmic retribution. Mr. Yazhai recounted this story in detail and urged me to record it for study. Mr. Gu was Luo Jiting’s brother-in-law and witnessed the event firsthand.

In our village, two brothers lost their father early and were raised by their mother, who begged on her back to support them until adulthood. Yet these brothers became notorious for their unfilial conduct, disrespectful and unrighteous. The elder brother and his wife were especially loathed by all. Not only did they refuse to feed their aged mother, they cast her out and frequently beat her until she hovered between life and death. No counsel could sway them. Ultimately, the old woman was worn down and perished from their cruelty.

Shortly after her death, in the year nineteen forty-six, on a rainy noon in the fifth lunar month, the brothers sat smoking on the bed in the main hall, while the elder’s wife washed dishes in the kitchen. When the rain ceased, villagers gathered at the doorway to enjoy the cool air. I was ten years old then, playing with other children outside the house. Suddenly, a thunderclap split the sky, and a fiery ball, slightly larger than a basketball, fell at their doorstep. It rolled inside, followed by a tremendous explosion. A cloud of smoke rose, obscuring all sight. Terrified, we children flattened ourselves to the ground, frozen in fear. Shouts rang out: “The Jin family has been struck by thunder!” People rushed from all directions to the house. As the smoke cleared, the younger brother knelt strangely some ten meters away in the threshing yard. The elder brother and his wife lay dead—one in the main hall, the other in the kitchen.

The villagers applauded their demise, saying, “This is the inevitable fate of those who are unfilial. If humans do not repay, Heaven will. Truly, evil begets retribution.”

A woman without feminine virtue, who stoops to shouting curses over the fence at neighbors, is a thorough shrew. If she also abuses her husband and mistreats her in-laws, she becomes a disgrace among women. Zhang of the northwest (real name withheld) was such a person. None in the neighborhood dared provoke her; any slight offense was met with her crude, vile insults. Zhang often engaged in illicit affairs. Her husband died young, leaving a pitiful mother-in-law and three daughters. After her husband’s death, her bad habits worsened. Her abuse of her mother-in-law was more foul than the vilest harlot’s curses; her beatings were rougher than those dealt to swine or dogs. Yet strangely, this fearless, earth-defying woman trembled at the mere sound of thunder. One afternoon, after a fresh round of abuse, a bolt of lightning split the clear sky, shaking her into the bedclothes where she wailed pitifully without cease. Thunder cracked repeatedly atop the tall poplars by the roof. Her three children wrapped their mother in blankets, climbed atop the bundle, and shielded her with their bodies. The earth shook with several great rumbles; the poplars atop the roof snapped in unison, the ridge was shattered. Then the clouds dispersed and the thunder ceased. The three dutiful daughters pulled their terrified mother from the blankets, but she babbled incoherently. Neighbors came to see, and the children recounted the terrifying episode.

In my aunt’s hometown, a woman washing her face at a pond suddenly noticed several flags stuck into her back, like a general on a stage. When she asked others, none could see them. She was greatly startled. An elder told her these were the mysterious and dreadful “flags of doom.” Those marked by these flags are destined to be struck by thunder, a sure sign they have committed grievous misdeeds against conscience—perhaps failing to honor their mother-in-law. If so, she was told to drink her mother-in-law’s foot-washing water or shoe-rinsing water, swear to honor her henceforth, and keep that vow. Then the flags would vanish unnoticed, and the thunder would no longer strike. The woman doubted this and did not comply. Soon after, she was struck by lightning and died a terrible death. In our neighboring Song Village, another woman faced the same omen. Hearing of it, she was terrified and drank her mother-in-law’s foot-washing water, vowing to honor her. Gradually, the flags disappeared, and she lived in peace thereafter. Our people generally believe that only those who commit grievous wrongs or are unfilial to parents suffer Heaven’s thunder punishment. Before the strike, a warning appears—the flags of doom. If one sincerely repents and acts accordingly, the calamity can be averted. Good and evil receive their due; this is the principle of Heaven.

In the yihai year of Kangxi’s reign, Su Prefecture suffered a great flood. A pregnant woman, whose husband was ill and lacked food, carried her three-year-old son into town to borrow rice. She borrowed four dou and returned home. About one li from her house, heavy rain began. She sought shelter at a household where a child stood at the door. Exhausted, she could no longer carry the rice or hold her son, so she asked the child to watch the rice bag, promising to return after sending her son home. The child and his mother conspired and hid the rice. The woman, unable to retrieve it, dared not return home and hanged herself beside the house. Her husband, bereft of support, soon died as well. The next year, in the sixth lunar month, the child who hid the rice moved with his parents to Yangyu Alley in the prefectural city. One day, he suddenly spoke ghostly words: “I have reported you; the Thunder God will punish you!” Within three days, thunder and lightning raged, and the child and his mother were struck dead in the courtyard, embracing each other in death. This occurred on the third day of the seventh lunar month in the bingzi year of Kangxi.

A man in Jiangxi earned his living herding ducks. His mother died, and his father grew old. The man resented his father’s dependence and often verbally abused him. One day, while he was cursing his father, a thunderclap suddenly lifted him into the courtyard. Villagers came to see him, noting that his beard, hair, and clothes were burned by thunderfire. His soul seemed dazed; he could neither speak nor move. A local who could interpret “thunder writings” urged them to check the bottom of the cooking pot for anomalies. Upon inspection, vermilion seal script appeared, reading: “Thunder’s warning—unfilial.” Later, neighbors invited Daoists to hold a ritual offering to atone on his behalf. He knelt before his father, and after three days, he regained speech. From then on, he reformed and became a filial son. These two cases share similarities—one was killed, the other injured—showing that those who rebel and are unfilial inevitably suffer retribution. Offenders must repent. Remarkably, both bore characters on their bodies, known in ancient times as “thunder writings.” This reveals the vastness of the cosmos, where wonders abound beyond modern science’s grasp. I earnestly advise all: it is better to believe than doubt. For Heaven, Earth, and spirits, one must know reverence.
