# The Scripture of the Northern Dipper: Methods for Cultivation According to the Dharma

The *Scripture of the Northern Dipper*, fully titled *The Most High Mysterious and Numinous Scripture of the Northern Dipper’s Original Fate for Prolonging Life*, stands among the four esteemed scriptures alongside the *Daily Morning Recitation*, *Daily Evening Recitation*, and the *Scripture of the Three Officials*. In ages past, the Most High descended upon the capital of Shu; the earth spirits ascended to the Jade Bureau Seat; Patriarch Zhang, the Celestial Master, received the *Scripture of the Northern Dipper*, thereby unlocking the Gate of Gratitude and Release. Mortal nature, life, and the five corporeal forms—all fall under the governance of the Original Fate Star Officers. The Original Fate Divine Generals and the Constantly Present Star Officers perpetually cast their protective shade, overseeing human destiny and safeguarding heavenly years.

The Northern Dipper dwells at Heaven’s center, the pivot of the celestial wheel, orchestrating the turning of the four seasons. All under Heaven—the sun, moon, stars, the Five Planets, the Heavenly Stems and Earthly Branches, the Twenty-Eight Constellations, and the myriad true immortals—are governed by the Northern Dipper’s supreme command. All beings of the world, their lifespan and fortune, poverty and wealth, birth and death, calamity and blessing, even matters of the nether realms, fall under the Northern Dipper’s sovereign rule. Should one sincerely open their heart and offer supplication, the response is certain.

The *Scripture of the Northern Dipper* is the path to entering the Dao and cultivating the true reality, the pivotal ritual of extending life through reverence to the Dipper, the secret method to dispel calamities and disasters, the key to reversing life and death. After enumerating various calamities, the Most High instructs that if one cultivates according to the Dharma, all calamities and obstacles will vanish naturally, and one will ascend to true realization and attain the Dao.

For the initial seekers of the Dao and the virtuous men and faithful women, if they sincerely invoke on the day of the descent of the Seven Primordial Lords, following the prescribed methods, reciting the scripture, burning talismans, and offering memorials, then the mighty power and divine transformation of the Seven Primordial Lords will manifest, illuminating myriad spirits with wondrous clarity. The *Scripture of the Nine Sovereigns* states:

If there be a benevolent person praying for blessings who wishes to behold the grand ceremony of the Seven Primordial Golden Immortal Great Saints, they must first sweep away worldly thoughts, purify the source of the heart, respectfully bow the body, close the eyes in silent contemplation. At the moment celestial music floats through the air, golden countenances appear, golden bodies reveal themselves—some resembling the Immortal Maiden Magu, others like the Lady of the Upper Origin. The energy of female heroes, compassionate and universally saving all beings. Once the Seven Primordial Lords ascend and descend within the central courtyard, all evil spirits retreat, and a hundred blessings seem to come in pairs.

Should one desire to dispel calamities, atone for sins, unravel difficulties, and humbly report to the Dipper, all wishes will be fulfilled, rescuing sentient beings from sinking into suffering. According to the *Scripture of the Northern Dipper*, the Great Saints, the Seven Primordial Lords of the Northern Dipper, can resolve calamities of the three disasters, four evils, Five Phases, six harms, seven injuries, eight difficulties, nine stars, marital calamities, male and female calamities, birth calamities, recurring calamities, epidemics, diseases, spiritual evils, tiger and wolf calamities, insect and snake calamities, bandit calamities, shackles and rods calamities, sudden death calamities, curses and oaths calamities, heavenly nets calamities, earthly traps calamities, weapons calamities, water and fire calamities, and all manner of calamities.

The *Scripture of the Twenty-Eight Chapters of the Northern Dipper* says:
If one sets their heart to face the Origin, reverently observing the methods of our Dipper, that person shall receive endless sustenance and clothing, their lifespan extended, never seeing swords or evil deeds, nor any suffering or affliction. They shall be granted eleven thousand eight hundred merits, constantly protected by auspicious stars. Their dwelling shall be guarded by all dragon spirits within its boundary, also receiving thirty-two thousand merits and eighty-eight thousand positions of fortune, transcending the realm of ghosts, born into the upper heavens, the heavenly city and palace, enjoying the happiness of gods and men, and rotating among the positions of the Star Officers and True Lords.

Speaking of the *Scripture of the Northern Dipper*, none fail to praise its ornate language, resembling the style of the Han and Tang dynasties with its four-six rhythmic prose. When one considers the extant Five Classics, Six Texts, the myriad schools of thought, and Buddhist sutras and scriptures, if not for composition, whence would they arise? Moreover, Confucian texts have been annotated and compiled from antiquity to the present without end, yet never fully exhausted; how much more so for Daoist scriptures?

The *Scripture of the Northern Dipper*, as one of the four daily recited Daoist scriptures, fulfills all prayers for blessings and disaster relief without fail. The preface to the *Scripture of the Northern Dipper* states: Among all slanders and defamations, the scripture clearly declares that those who fall into the Six Paths lose human form in water, a sorrowful and grievous fate, self-inflicted suffering.

Though the *Scripture of the Northern Dipper* was transmitted by the Most High Lord Lao to Patriarch Zhang Dao Ling as the secret method for prolonging life, the "Most High" in the title does not necessarily refer to Laozi himself, but rather signifies the scripture’s noble and rare status. Of course, interpreting it as Laozi is not incorrect; yet the sacred words proclaimed by Laozi cannot be truly grasped without understanding the scripture’s meaning and thus embodying the Most High’s holy teachings.

The Mysterious and Numinous refers to the Daoist Mysterious and Numinous Way. According to the *Scripture of Doumu for Prolonging Life*, Lady Doumu, through cultivating the mysterious and numinous wondrous Dao, diligently serving the Primordial Heavenly Honored One and constantly making profound vows, nourished the true spirit, refined the essence and soul, gathered the qi in a pure and vigorous manner, the qi entering the profound depths, harmonizing with the spiritual wind, ultimately realizing the mysterious and numinous wondrous Dao. The Mysterious and Numinous confounds the ears, eyes, nose, mouth, body, and mind. In truth, the so-called Mysterious and Numinous are the Three Corpses spirits. Specific methods can be referred to in the earlier explanation of the *Scripture of Attaining Heaven and the Dao*.

By revering the Northern Dipper and practicing the Mysterious and Numinous Scripture’s secret methods, one may ascend to the Nine Heavens within the Dipper. The Nine Heavens within the Dipper are: the Greedy Wolf residing in the Spiritual Splendor Heaven, the Giant Gate in the Divine Splendor Heaven, the Prosperity Keeper in the Profound Yellow Heaven, the Literary Song in the Splendid Yellow Heaven, the Integrity and Chastity in the Primordial Sovereign Heaven, the Martial Song in the Central Yellow Heaven, the Breaking Army in the True Sovereign Heaven, the Auxiliary Star in the Supreme Constant Heaven, and the Assisting Star in the Transformative Spirit Heaven.

This is also why reciting the *Scripture of the Northern Dipper* is chosen on days like Jiazi and Gengshen, when the Three Corpses spirits are particularly vigorous. Daoism customarily holds rites to appease the stars and report to the Dipper on the third and twenty-seventh days of each lunar month, as well as on Jiazi and Gengshen days.

The Northern Dipper refers to the Seven Primordial Lords and Nine Sovereign Star Lords. The Original Fate refers to the Original Fate Star Lord or Star Officer. The Northern Dipper is the essence and soul of the Nine Heavens, the spiritual consciousness of the Nine Earths, the wondrous manifestation of the Nine Stars, the mighty deity of the Nine Provinces. The Original Fate descends to the human world six times each year, examining the sins and blessings of all people. A brief analysis was given earlier on the Original Fate Primordial Spirit; for more, see the annotations below.

Prolonging life means falling away from the register of death. Daoism holds that the Southern Dipper records births, while the Northern Dipper records deaths. Simply put, the Southern Dipper governs the register of births of sentient beings, which is why the Southern Dipper’s name appears in Daoist registers for ascending to heaven. Correspondingly, the Northern Dipper governs the register of deaths. Therefore, in Daoist rites for blessings, the Northern Dipper’s name is frequently invoked. In other words, reciting and holding the *Scripture of the Northern Dipper* naturally extends life and dispels calamities.

True Scripture is the path to cultivating truth. Likewise, the three primordial qi of the mysterious origin: the mysterious is born of earth, the origin is born of man, the beginning is born of heaven. Man models earth, earth models heaven, heaven models the Dao, the Dao models nature. Man models earth, hence called mysterious. Man alone is the spirit of myriad things, hence called numinous. The Dao gives birth to one; one gives birth to two; two gives birth to three; three gives birth to nine.

The three qi are the sovereigns of heaven and earth; the nine qi are the roots of all things. The Northern Dipper dwells at the center of heaven, governing the nine qi, the unity of nine and one in the mysterious unity of the Dao. The mysterious is born of earth and models man, hence called the Northern Dipper Original Fate. Man obtains life, dividing one qi from the qi, born from the mysterious unity. Since life arises from one’s own qi, one must understand its root, return to guard the mysterious unity, thereby extending life.

The *Scripture of the Northern Dipper* is the secret method for prolonging life bestowed by Laozi to the Celestial Master, awakening the lower practitioners to return to the true Dao, return to root and understand destiny. Should one fall ill or face hardship, childbirth or disaster, seek heirs or continuation, or wish to protect and extend life, one must urgently and sincerely contemplate and settle the mind, recognize the Original Fate Star Lord, hold this secret method, recite this scripture, burn this talisman, and then the household will be pure and tranquil, and calamities will be overcome in due time, bringing peace and safety. Its root lies in the Dao giving rise to all.

The *Scripture of the Northern Dipper* states: Knowing the body, nature, and life all depend on the Dao giving rise to them. Realizing this cause, one becomes a person of longevity. The seed never ceases; generation after generation remains human, never born into the land without Dao, never breaking the root of humanity, able to cultivate the mind and correct the Dao, gradually entering the immortal lineage, forever leaving the cycle of rebirth, ascending and becoming the Dao.

Laozi revealed to the Celestial Master the wondrous method, enabling the heavenly people to return to truth and know destiny. On the day of one’s Original Fate, one may fast and set up offerings, invoke and bless the Northern Dipper, the Three Officials, the Five Emperors, the Nine Bureaus, and the Four Departments, recommend blessings and dispel disasters, present memorials with earnest wishes, offer sincere gifts, various incense and flowers, fresh five fruits, according to worldly dignity, in a pure and tranquil altar chamber, following the laws of heaven and images of earth, whether in temples or at home, building merit according to one’s ability, requesting to perform rites, accruing profound merit.

![](/media/202305/2023-05-09_162823_3153880.4513468012551821.png)

Regarding the Original Fate day, many mistakenly think it is the day pillar of birth, but usually the year pillar of birth is chosen as the Original Fate day. For example, if someone is born in the year Jiazi, month Bingzi, day Wuzi, then their Original Fate day is Jiazi day. The Wuzi day is considered the birthday.

The Northern Dipper means the Seven Primordial Lords and Nine Sovereigns. The Three Officials are the Heavenly, Earthly, and Water Officials, Great Emperors. The Five Emperors are the five elders of the five directions: blue, yellow, red, white, and black. The Nine Bureaus are the Nine Bureaus of the Three Officials’ examination. The Four Departments are the Departments of Fate, Fortune, Danger, and Fault. Most people have no trouble with the Seven Primordial Lords, Nine Sovereigns, Three Officials, Nine Bureaus, and Five Elders.

The Three Officials and Five Emperors record their merits and labors. The Nine Bureaus and Four Departments observe their diligence. Those not yet accomplished in the Dao, with the posture of bowing and looking, find the Daoist methods difficult to perfect; actions before and after do not accord with ritual, and so are reprimanded by the Four Departments and held by the Five Emperors. The Three Officials correct errors, the Four Departments supervise faults.

The *Scripture of the True Origin for Communicating with the Immortal Dao* states: Heaven has the Four Departments’ stars, between the Void and Danger, beside the human stars, governing humans. The two Fate stars govern the person’s merits and faults, lifespan, rewards and punishments. The two Fortune stars govern rank, clothing, and food. The two Danger stars govern exile and injustice. The two Fault stars govern evil confusion and selfishness.

Facing the Northern Dipper in ceremony mainly involves setting up the Dipper altar, invoking and blessing the Northern Dipper, the Three Officials, Five Emperors, Nine Bureaus, and Four Departments, able to recommend blessings and dispel disasters. The *Scripture of the Northern Dipper* says: Various incense and flowers, fresh five fruits, according to worldly dignity, pure and tranquil altar chamber, following the laws of heaven and images of earth, whether in temples or at home, building merit according to one’s ability.

### Ten Taboos in Setting Up the Dipper Altar

Setting up the Dipper altar requires enshrining the Three Platforms, Seven Primordial Lords, Nine Sovereigns, and other sacred seats; offering incense, flowers, water, fruits, lamps; making rice talismans to perform fasting and offering rites; presenting memorials with earnest wishes; sincerely offering gifts; requesting to perform rites. When setting up the altar, generally ten taboos are observed, which practitioners must heed.

**First Taboo: Sandalwood**  
Women of the Azure Heaven Law are forbidden to burn sandalwood; violators incur ancestral punishment in Fengdu. This is no trivial matter—please remember carefully. Violating this by burning sandalwood brings yin curses and continuous illness and disaster.

**Second Taboo: Flowers**  
All flowers may be offered to the divine heavens, but the monthly rose has forbidden words. This is because it is untimely and alluring, as recorded in the *Languan Responsive Chapter*.

**Third Taboo: Wu Day**  
On Wu days, the heavenly edict forbids sarcastic words; swallows do not carry mud, snakes do not crawl. Violations bring calamity throughout the four seasons, as the Queen Mother once showed to the Han sovereign.

**Fourth Taboo: Water**  
Water offerings should be drawn from wells or springs; riversides risk pollution and overflow. Please see the phrase in the *Blood Lake Scripture* to believe the heavenly spirits’ admonition.

**Fifth Taboo: Fruits**  
Among fruits, dried and fresh alike, pomegranate is forbidden to be offered to the Profound Heaven. Plums are unsuitable for offering to the Most High, and black dates are generally forbidden before the True Ones.

**Sixth Taboo: Food**  
Heaven abhors three kinds: wild goose, pigeon, and dove; black carp, loach, turtle, dog, pig, and sheep. Forbidden are two kinds of garlic, scallion, coriander, and chives. Thunder and lightning sternly declare this widely.

**Seventh Taboo: People**  
Pregnant women and monks should not approach or observe; mourning clothes, chickens, and dogs are forbidden near the altar. Impure clothing, alcohol, and meat dishes are forbidden; the supervising Dipper generals will not tolerate mockery.

**Eighth Taboo: Place**  
Do not approach graves or unclean rooms; avoid delivery rooms and abandoned shrines. Old qi conceals corpses and spirit coffins; these are not auspicious places.

**Ninth Taboo: Lamps**  
A rack of divine lamps is placed according to the stars, brilliantly illuminating and assisting heavenly clarity. The Original Fate’s flame must not be extinguished; it reports auspiciousness and misfortune to the lord.

**Tenth Taboo: Vegetables**  
Vegetables such as melons, eggplants, and gluten are forbidden; washing with manure pollutes their cause. Impure firewood for cooking is forbidden by heavenly edicts. How could such be offered to the star spirits?

Setting up a Dipper altar according to proper rites and ceremonies, after facing the Dipper, one can judge the efficacy of the ceremony. If wishing to set up an altar, it is recommended to consult nearby Daoist temples. Generally, Daoist temples hold rites to face the True and report to the Dipper; approaching these altars is a good way to learn and reference.

### Setting Up the Dipper Altar

When reciting the *Scripture of the Northern Dipper*, one may choose Dipper days (the third and twenty-seventh days of each lunar month, Jiazi and Gengshen days), Original Fate days, birthdays, or Northern Dipper descent days. As mentioned, setting up the altar requires enshrining sacred seats, various incense and flowers, fresh five fruits, and so forth.

When setting up the altar, sandalwood incense must not be burned; monthly roses must not be offered; melons and eggplants must not be offered; monks, nuns, and pregnant women must not approach the altar; worship on Wu days is forbidden; the three dislikes and five meat dishes are taboo; the Original Fate lamp must be lit; unclean places must be avoided.

As the *Scripture of the Northern Dipper* says: According to worldly dignity, pure and tranquil altar chambers, following the laws of heaven and images of earth, whether in temples or at home. If rites are not proper, the Four Departments will reprimand, the Five Emperors will hold, and the Three Officials will examine.

The above altar arrangement diagram is from the *Great Yellow Register of Fasting*. From the diagram, it is evident that Dipper altars usually enshrine images or tablets of Lady Doumu and the Northern and Southern Dipper Star Lords. Some altars enshrine only Lady Doumu and the Northern Dipper Seven Primordial and Nine Sovereigns. Others enshrine the Northern Dipper Seven Primordial, Nine Sovereigns, and Three Platforms, and so on. Different lineages have slight variations.

Regarding altar offerings, generally there are three cups each of tea, wine, and jujube soup; seven kinds each of vegetables (excluding eggplant), steamed dishes, and fruits (excluding melons). Additionally, a pair of flower vases (excluding monthly roses), a pair of candles (red candles recommended), a censer, incense holders, incense powder boxes, and sets of chopsticks and bottles are required.

When setting up the altar, the method of “following heaven and imitating earth” is often used to create rice diagrams, also called rice talismans. Usually, these include the Purple Tenuity taboo, two Dipper and three Platform lamps, dragons and phoenixes presenting auspiciousness, prosperity horses supporting, Original Fate Primordial Spirit, smooth operation of fate cycles, and other parts or all of these patterns, then lighting lamps and reciting scripture. Generally, altar arrangements vary by date; for example, the diagram shows slight differences between yin and yang days.

In the altar, besides the ritual instruments held by the masters and the musicians’ instruments, there is usually a Dipper. Nowadays, the Dipper typically includes five ritual implements: sword, ruler, mirror, scale, and scissors, as well as five-directional command flags. After worshiping the Dipper, the Dipper is often turned, symbolizing the turning of the stars and the coming of fortune.

![](/media/202305/2023-05-09_162856_6920190.2298836589775768.png)

Submitting memorials and petitions is one of the main ways Daoist practitioners communicate with the incense cloud devotees. Through focused thought on the heavenly spirits’ grace, writing with brush and ink on paper, reaching the celestial archives. After burning the memorials, cloud-like script often forms, ascending to the heavenly court. There are many kinds of memorials and petitions: memorials, petitions, notices, remonstrances, letters, documents, registers, and passes.

These are the letters of ordinary devotees petitioning the immortals, like correspondence with the immortals. If one’s cultivation is good, one may ascend directly to the heavenly court through visualization and meditation, akin to voice messages on WeChat. Some practitioners can also draw upon heaven and earth, take methods from yin and yang, and directly fulfill devotees’ wishes.

Memorials and petitions are the correspondence between devotees and the immortal ancestors, often stored in petition tubes. They usually include the petitioner’s name, birth date and time, current residence, reason for petition, the immortal palace and title, and so forth. In Daoist fasting and offering rites, raising memorials for devotees’ blessings is done in this form.

The memorials for the Northern Dipper Seven Primordial and Nine Sovereigns usually petition the True and Tranquil Earth Lords of the ritual altar, the Direct Talisman Envoys of the Merit Office, the two envoys Zhang and Xie who resolve calamities in the Dipper, the two envoys Qiangyang and Tuoluo who resolve calamities in the Dipper, and so on. Different sects and lineages summon slightly different officials and generals. Some sects or lineages also summon officials, generals, and soldiers to deliver memorials.

Regarding the use of Northern Dipper memorials, different sects and lineages vary. The most commonly used are remonstrances. Compared to petitions, remonstrances are more casual and have no strict requirements. Therefore, many temples choose remonstrances when worshiping the Dipper. Here, as an example, is a longevity Dipper memorial heading:

![](/media/202305/2023-05-09_162906_1757030.31092712459763905.png)

It is worth mentioning that many lineages, before submitting the Nine Sovereigns memorial, often first submit (or petition, remonstrate) to the Department of Fate, the morning worship of the Three Officials, the noon worship of the Azure Luo, and the evening worship of the Dipper. Remonstrances are relatively casual and will not be detailed here.

The *Scripture of the Northern Dipper* mentions submitting memorials and petitions. Commonly used memorials in Daoism include the Feather Memorial for Prolonging Life and the Golden Mysterious Feather Memorial. The Feather Memorial for Prolonging Life is relatively easy to use, whereas the Golden Mysterious Feather Memorial is more complex. Similarly, different Star Lords use different talismans.

Different lineages and temples may vary. The author often worships the palace during the Dipper ceremony; the so-called worshiping the palace means the forty-nine bows to the Original Fate Palace. Thus, devotees who participate in the Dipper ceremony usually have relatively high efficacy. Here is a shared heading of a Feather Memorial for Prolonging Life:

### Thirty-Six Resolutions of the Northern Dipper for Redressing Grievances and Prolonging Life

Speaking of the thirty-six resolutions, many know of the thirty-six resolutions of thunder and the thirty-six gates of exorcism. In fact, the Northern Dipper also has thirty-six resolutions. The thirty-six mysterious resolutions of the Northern Dipper are often written as thirty-six petitions, issued under the command of the plague marshal for implementation. Regarding memorials, petitions, and remonstrances, this is all that will be introduced here; for reference only, please follow your personal lineage.

We have briefly analyzed altar setup, talisman drawing, and memorial presentation when reciting the *Scripture of the Northern Dipper*. So, where are these written memorials, petitions, and remonstrances sent by the True and Tranquil Earth Lords of the ritual altar, the Direct Talisman Envoys of the Merit Office, the Calamity-Resolving Envoys of the Dipper, and the Thunder Officials?

In truth, different sects often send the written memorials and petitions to different palaces to pray for the resolution of related calamities. Even the same deities may have different palaces to which they are sent. Here are some commonly used palaces (for reference only; specific practice depends on lineage; non-lineage practitioners should not use them rashly):

### The Nine Sovereigns’ Holy Titles  
The Great Saint of the Central Heaven, the Northern Dipper Nine Sovereigns, the Most High Honored Emperor Lord, generally use palaces such as the Northern Dipper Xuanji Palace, Ziwei Xuanji Responsive Spirit Palace, Xuanji Responsive Spirit Palace, Xuanji Imperial Radiance Heavenly Palace, Northern Dipper Nine Sovereigns Palace, and so forth.

### The Seven Primordial Holy Titles  
The Great Saint of the Central Heaven, the Northern Dipper Seven Primordial Life-Extending Star Lords, generally use the Northern Dipper Xuanji Palace.

### Reporting Dipper Names and Titles  
Zi Ji Zhao Chong Xun Ling Heavenly Hero Great Star Lord, also called Northern Dipper First Yangming Greedy Wolf Great Star Lord, generally use palaces such as Northern Dipper Yanqiong Palace, Heavenly Origin Palace, Most High Palace.

Zi Ji Ying Ming Ji Hua Tian Ren Primordial Star Lord, also called Northern Dipper Second Yin Essence Giant Gate Primordial Star Lord, generally use palaces such as Northern Dipper Yi Qiong Palace, Earth Origin Palace, Middle Origin Palace.

Zi Ji Tong Xuan Xu Bian Tian Zhu True Star Lord, also called Northern Dipper Third True Person Prosperity Keeper Chastity Star Lord, generally use palaces such as Northern Dipper Yao Qiong Palace, Sun Origin Palace, True Origin Palace.

Zi Ji Zong Cheng Fu Yun Tian Xin Niu Star Lord, also called Northern Dipper Fourth Mysterious Darkness Literary Song Niu Star Lord, generally use palaces such as Northern Dipper Meng Qiong Palace, Moon Origin Palace, Niu You Palace.

Zi Ji Zhi Qing Gang Yu Tian Qin Gang Star Lord, also called Northern Dipper Fifth Dan Origin Integrity Gang Star Lord, generally use palaces such as Northern Dipper Li Qiong Palace, River Origin Palace, Gang Shen Palace.

Zi Ji Zong Yi Shu Jing Tian Fu Ji Star Lord, also called Northern Dipper Sixth North Pole Martial Song Ji Star Lord, generally use palaces such as Northern Dipper Ying Qiong Palace, River Origin Palace, Jing Yang Palace.

Zi Ji Ning Hua Hao Hua Tian Chong Guan Star Lord, also called Northern Dipper Seventh Heavenly Pass Breaking Army Guan Star Lord, generally use palaces such as Northern Dipper Fang Qiong Palace, Sea Origin Palace, Guan Hui Palace.

Zi Ji Yang Zong Fu Qing Tian Rui Fu Star Lord, also called Northern Dipper Ninth Hidden Light Inner Assisting Star Lord, generally use palaces such as Northern Dipper Xuan Qiong Palace, Emperor’s Seat Palace, Emperor’s Degree Palace.

Zi Ji Yin Xi Da Yan Tian Peng Assisting Star Lord, also called Northern Dipper Eighth Cavity Bright Outer Assisting Star Lord, generally use palaces such as Northern Dipper Wei Qiong Palace, Supreme Honored Palace.

### Other Dipper Deities  
Dipper Pivot Supreme Prime Lord generally uses palaces such as the Mysterious and Numinous Dipper Mansion, Mysterious and Numinous Inner Mansion.

Dipper Center Supreme Prime Lord generally uses palaces such as Xuanji Jade Mansion, Xuanji Outer Mansion.

Heavenly Pivot Supreme Prime Lord generally uses palaces such as Northern Pole Dipper Pivot Mysterious and Numinous Mansion.

The above are only some of the palaces for facing the True and reporting to the Dipper. Daoism often uses the twelve-character holy title and wording of yellow-black Dao for memorials, such as “How far is the Dao’s communication? When will the road home be reached?”

Memorial tubes (or petition tubes) also vary greatly. Some use the above palaces; others do not, even writing other palaces and other content, such as official titles, ranks, names of officials delivering memorials, and so forth. For reference only.

### Are the Northern Dipper Nine Sovereigns and Seven Primordial Male or Female?

Many images of the Northern Dipper Nine Sovereigns and Seven Primordial show male forms; others show female forms. The *Scripture of the Nine Sovereigns* states the Northern Dipper Nine Sovereigns are holy sons born of Lady Doumu, while the *Scripture of the Northern Dipper* calls them Primordial Lords.

The Nine Sovereigns and Seven Primordial are originally transformations of the primordial state; the Dipper truth is the primordial Dao body’s transformation, originally without yin-yang or male-female form. The great Dao is formless; the utmost truth has no image. In fact, Daoism generally visualizes and contemplates them as female forms. The Northern Dipper belongs to water and yin; thus, the faithful generally regard the Seven Primordial Lords as female forms.

Daoism has many scriptures and methods related to the Northern Dipper, involving sleep techniques, martial arts, refining and nourishing, visualization, and so forth. Due to space, here is one reclining Dipper visualization method for reference: for example, visualizing Kui covering the head, with Gang pointing forward; or visualizing the Northern Dipper Nine Sovereigns rotating the Primordial Sovereign True Qi to harmonize the body.

The *Precious Decrees*, also called *Decree Chapters* or *True Decrees*, originally referred to the sacred words transmitted by immortals, later mostly referring to ornate prose praising immortals, a unique Daoist literary form of immortal praise. The *Precious Decrees* all begin with “With utmost sincerity, I take refuge and pay homage,” ending with the immortal’s sacred title, recording vast teachings, doctrines, and cultivation methods.

During temple rites or scripture recitations, Daoist priests connect the mortal and the sacred, maintaining spirit and visualization, using *Precious Decrees* to communicate with the holy truth, transmitting messages mutually. The content is vast, mainly praising the heavenly spirits’ sacred records and narrating the cultivation and realization processes of ancestral masters through the ages.

When reciting the *Scripture of the Northern Dipper*, burning talismans, holding spells, and submitting memorials and petitions, we usually also recite some star-related *Precious Decrees* and divine spells. For example, the *Nine Sovereigns Precious Decree*, *Northern Dipper Divine Spell*, *Doumu Heart Spell*, and so forth. Here are several commonly used star-related true decrees for beginners’ reference only.
