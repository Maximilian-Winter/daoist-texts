# Precious Edict of Repaying Grace

With utmost sincerity, I turn my heart and bow in reverent submission.  
The Mysterious Primordial responds and transforms;  
Martial Song divides the true essence,  
Casting compassionate thoughts upon us all beings.  

Form arises and departs from birth;  
Parents bear us nine months within the womb,  
Nurture us with milk for three years—  
Enduring countless hardships,  
Diligently attending every fleeting moment.  

Pitying my parents, who daily grow frail and worn,  
I now hold steadfast remembrance with equal heart,  
Erasing the perilous heights of greed and anger.  
I pay homage to the Emperor as my teacher,  
Praying to repay the root of all kindness.  

May my living parents now be blessed  
With extended fortune and longevity;  
May my ancestors of old  
Swiftly transcend the cycle of birth and death.  

Great Sage, Great Compassion,  
Great Benevolence, Great Filial Piety—  
Eighty-two transformations,  
Teachers of the doctrine of repaying grace.  

Protecting Saint, True Martial,  
God of blessings governing the world,  
Master and minister of the Jade Void,  
Dark Heavenly Highest Emperor,  
Incarnation of the Golden Palace,  
Heavenly Venerable of Great Unity, Savior from Suffering at the end of kalpas.
