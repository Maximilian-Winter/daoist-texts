# Precious Edict of the Mysterious Ancestor of the Purple Mansion

With devoted heart I submit my vow and reverence. The Southern Palace of the Purple Mansion, is the place of the unsurpassed Way. It unfolds the mystery of the primordial extremity, true and incorruptible to the utmost. The true void of the original beginning, the spiritual source and ancestor of the kalpa. The wondrous Way of emptiness and non-being, its wondrous workings are hard to exhaust. Indeed the ancestor and exemplar of all the immortals and sages, whose divine devices are unfathomable. He is the master of the Way, the master of the Law, the master of the teaching; most spiritual, most responsive. Most holy, most compassionate, his virtue is boundless and immeasurable. In the great kalpa he saves the world, settles disorder, and expounds the Law. He is the benevolent and holy matron, the Great Celestial Lord, the Mysterious Ancestor of the Purple Mansion in the Nine Heavens.
