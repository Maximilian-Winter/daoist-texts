# Precious Proclamation of Fuxi

With heart devoted, I bow and surrender in reverent homage.  
The Vast Heaven, the hollow seat, the ancient sovereign of old.  
Perfectly harmonious is the fruit of the Way, the mysterious pivot of creation.  
Established are the principles and observances, striking the changes to become the shaman.  
The law continues through a thousand autumns, pure and serene in aspect; the new transmission moistens the young for ten thousand generations.  
The Five Phases, Four Symbols, and Two Modes are verified; the Eight Trigrams, Nine Palaces, and the Supreme Ultimate charted.  
Yin and Yang, fortune and misfortune, the sun, moon, and stars in awe.  
No man, no vital breath, but surely the earth and I.  
Opening the mountains and inaugurating teaching, setting up the sages and proclaiming the scholars.  
Dispelling the sea of suffering, calamities, and doom; moving the mortal dust, bestowing blessings, auspicious arts.  
Vast is the understanding of divine powers, bright and beneficent grace, for the multitudes now is spread the rosy talisman.  
Great compassion, great vow; great sage, great mercy.  
The Heaven-opening Most Holy, the Ancient Sovereign Emperor, the boundless Holy King,  
Emperor Fuxi, the perfect Fuxi who governs the world, the Celestial Honoured One.
