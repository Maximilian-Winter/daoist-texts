# Sacred Proclamation of Xuanyuan

With devoted heart and reverent bow I pay homage. The august sovereign of the era, enthroned in the mysterious capital. Radiant and perfect fruit, nurturing the myriad young. Overseeing the three teachings of Confucianism, Daoism, and Buddhism alike in their temporal authority, presiding over Heaven and Earth, Man, the myriad phenomena, stars, and talismans. Supervising and issuing commands to the gods, immortals, and Buddhas in their offices; inspecting the registers of right and wrong, of merit and fault. Mountains and rivers are under his dominion; he surveys the wilds and divides their districts. Prefectures, counties, and cities are governed; the timing of administration is duly observed. Through countless ages flows the residue of sun and moon; through a thousand autumns succession continues from Tang and Yu. The Yellow Canon’s meridians and veins, the Su Wen and Ling Shu—illustrious and radiant, first and healthy, thus fashioned the suspended caldron. Scholars gather at court to compile and create; the compass and characters, the carriage and boat. Their achievements partake of the rain and dew; their virtues share in nourishment and moistening. Manifest are good and evil; recorded are ranks and punishments. They amend and fashion yin and yang to secure the state; to dispel calamities and disasters, to deliver ordinary men. Great compassion and great vows; great sages and great mercy. In the high azure jade palace, the Academy of Culture, Xuanyuan the Yellow Emperor, Open Origin, Lord of the Celestial World of Order.
