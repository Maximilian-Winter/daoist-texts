# Precious Admonition of the Southern Peak

With devoted heart and reverent mind I pay homage.  
The Southern Heng, ancestor saint, clear and lofty is the great heaven.  
Rising in tiers, the emerald girdle encircles,  
Stirring the sun and moon to shine in the darkness of night.  
Crossing the sufferings of men, he lays bridge upon bridge for ascent;  
Receiving the multitude in their confusion, he extends the long hair of distant stars in the Dipper.  
In secret and profound awakening, hearts return from near and far.  
He cuts away the thin record of death and lifeâ€™s chapter,  
Extinguishes the root of guilt and registers them in the book of blessings.  
Looking upward to him here, reverence and thought follow in obedience.  
Great compassion and great vow, great saint and great mercy.  
He holds and controls the record of fortune, rank, and longevity;  
The Southern Peak, director of heaven, the great transformation, illustrious holy emperor.  
Clear and vast is the void, presiding over the true lord of the register;  
Receiving refinement and rebirth, the honoured celestial exalted.
