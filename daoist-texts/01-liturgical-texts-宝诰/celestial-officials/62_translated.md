# Precious Revelation of the Northern Peak

With devoted heart I submit my homage and vow obedience. The Northern region holds the Supreme Ultimate, the original and primal spirit. It guards the steadfast earth of Mount Gen, and has received the commendation and investiture of the Jade Emperor. At the single cavern of the North, the vital breath is one root. Encircling it are the mountains of the Nine Nether Regions, to which corresponds the Southern Peak. Beneath the sun it is reflected, at the commencement of the cycle of Gui and Zi. The Great Spirit, the Great Response, rescues from peril and from disaster. It presides over the Alchemical Terrace; the Northern Peak secures the heavens. The Great True and Primal Sage Emperor, the Supreme Vast Heaven, the Master of Registers and True Lords, the Most High and Most Excellent Celestial Venerable.
