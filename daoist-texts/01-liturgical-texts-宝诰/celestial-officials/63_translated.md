# Precious Declaration of the Great Emperor of the Central Mountain

With devoted heart I bow in reverence and surrender.  
The Exalted Sovereign of the Central Heaven, the Four Mountains attend the Heaven.  
He establishes the vital channels of the five directions, and sustains the living beings of ten thousand ages.  
His root reaches the summit of Earth, his essence is pure and spirit clear.  
He restrains the calamity stars in the eight corners, bestows blessings and felicity upon the four boundaries.  
Great in benevolence and great in holiness, great in vow and great in compassion,  
He presides over the Five Soils, the Central Mountain and Central Heaven.  
The Great Tranquillity, Venerable Holy Emperor, vast is the Void,  
The True Lord who governs the reckoning, the Yellow Heavenâ€™s Central Lord, Heavenly Exalted One.
