# Precious Admonition of the Ancestral Celestial Master

Precious Admonition of the Ancestral Celestial Master

With reverent heart I take refuge and make obeisance. Originally from the Southern lands, tracing back to the capital of Shu. First did he obtain from the Yellow Emperor the cinnabar script of the Nine Tripods; afterwards he twice attended the Venerable Lord Lao at the Jade Bureau. A thousand scrolls contain the essentials of cultivating the True; in one instant he perfected the art of breathing in and out. The talismanic registers were fully completed, receiving the vow and rank, and forming the incantations of binding. Right and wrong are distinguished; he seized the court of blessings and in governance transformed the universal springs. Virtue accomplished the great elixir; the Way harmonized the seven luminaries. Great compassion and great vow; great saint and great mercy. The Three Heavens uphold the teaching, assisting the mysterious essence of the Way. The Great Law Celestial Master, the capital of Thunder and Thunderbolts. The Supreme Minister of the Profound Mystery, the Great Law Lord ruling all Heaven. The orthodox and unifying mysterious deity, who responds in stillness and manifests aid, the True Lord. The six directions are unbounded. The Most High Bright Emperor, who descends to conquer demons and protect the Way, the Celestial Venerable.

Upon Crane-Singing Mountain he obtained the true transmission; at the Mysterious Altar of Dragon and Tiger he left the wondrous formula. The Three Caverns’ talismanic registers, the various grades of spiritual writings. One thousand two hundred officers and troops, to uphold and assist the orthodox teaching. Twenty-four grades of secret registers, universally to deliver the later generations. The capital merit jade seals, official robes and numerous attendants. Dwelling in the capital province, constantly serving the Highest Deity; holding sway over the Three Realms and delivering the lower folk. The twin swords of male and female, to punish and slay demons and spirits. Bringing rain or causing clear skies; thundering and lightning flashing forth. Thus he sets up the altar and spreads his transformations, assisting the state to prosper and pacify the people. When his work is accomplished and his practice fulfilled, he ascends in broad daylight. The Patriarch aids the teaching of the Three Heavens.

## Commentary on the Precious Admonition of the Ancestral Celestial Master

The Ancestral Celestial Master is the Celestial Master Zhang of the first generation, also named Zhang Ling, styled Fu-han. A native of Feng County in Pei State of the Eastern Han, he was the eighth generation descendant of Zhang Zifang, Marquis of Liu in Han. Born in the tenth year of the Jianwu era of Emperor Guangwu of Eastern Han (34 CE), before his birth his mother dreamed that the Chief Star descended, whereby she conceived. From youth he was intelligent, at seven years old reading through the Tao De Jing and the books of He and Luo. Afterwards he resigned office to cultivate the Way. At that time in the Bashu region there were the Ba people who followed the original shamanic cult, with widespread licentious rites damaging the people. The law of worshipping ghosts and demons was the shamans’ craft, gathering crowds to extort wealth, committing every evil. Zhang the Celestial Master, with disciples Wang Chang, Zhao Sheng and others, pacified the demons and evil, slaying the shamans; later he founded the orthodox and unifying Oath-Power Way, becoming the founding patriarch of Taoism. This Precious Admonition is the treasure admonition of the Orthodox Unity school’s Ancestral Celestial Master, distinguished from the Quanzhen sect.

### The Supreme Minister of the Profound Mystery, who aids the teaching of the Three Heavens.
Great Mystery signifies profound and subtle Daoist principles. The Supreme Minister is a respectful title for a prime minister. Aiding the teaching means assisting Taoism. The Three Heavens refer to the Three Pure Ones’ heavens, namely the Qingwei Heaven, the Yuyu Heaven, and the Dachi Heaven.

### Upon Crane-Singing Mountain he obtained the true transmission; at the Mysterious Altar of Dragon and Tiger he left the wondrous formula.
The Venerable Lord Lao descended upon Crane-Singing Mountain, bestowing upon Zhang the Celestial Master his position. In the first year of Emperor Shun of Han’s Yongshou era, the Ancestral Celestial Master established the Orthodox Unity Oath-Power Way at Crane-Singing Mountain. The Master once built an altar and refined elixir at Yunjin Mountain, completing it in three years as dragon and tiger manifested, hence Yunjin Mountain is also called Dragon-Tiger Mountain. The Mysterious Altar signifies the protective rites.

### The Three Caverns’ talismanic registers, the various grades of spiritual writings.
The Three Caverns are 'Cavern of Truth', 'Cavern of Mystery', and 'Cavern of Spirit'. Talismanic registers are summons and incantation documents.

### One thousand two hundred officers and troops, to uphold and assist the orthodox teaching.
Refers to the Ancestral Celestial Master receiving the scriptures conferred by the Venerable Lord Lao, decoding secret texts daily, able to summon 36,000 spirits and 1,200 officer lords for service and command.

### Twenty-four grades of secret registers, universally to deliver the later generations.
Namely the 'Orthodox Unity Oath-Power Twenty-Four Grades of Talismanic Registers' conferred by the Venerable Lord Lao.

### The capital merit jade seals, official robes and numerous attendants.
The three-five capital merit jade seals and other ritual instruments conferred by the Venerable Lord Lao. Official robes and numerous attendants refer respectively to the flat crown, Bagua robe, square skirt, and vermilion shoes. These two lines reveal the great responsibility of the Ancestral Celestial Master.

### Dwelling in the capital province, constantly serving the Highest Deity; holding sway over the Three Realms and delivering the lower folk.
The capital province is a divine office in heaven. The Three Realms are heaven, earth, and human worlds. These words signify the functions of the Ancestral Celestial Master.

### The twin swords of male and female, to punish and slay demons and spirits.
Bringing rain or causing clear skies; thundering and lightning flashing forth: the twin swords of male and female were bestowed by the Venerable Lord Lao. These words depict the exalted magical powers of the Ancestral Celestial Master.

### Thus he sets up the altar and spreads his transformations, assisting the state to prosper and pacify the people.
This phrase signifies the great virtue of the Ancestral Celestial Master in establishing Taoism and transforming the world for the benefit of men.

### When his work is accomplished and his practice fulfilled, he ascends in broad daylight. The Patriarch aids the teaching of the Three Heavens.

In the first year of the An Yuan era of Han (156 CE), together with disciples Wang Chang and Zhao Sheng and his wife Lady Yong, he ascended in broad daylight at Yuntai Mountain. In the fourth year of Zhonghe of Emperor Xizong of Tang (884 CE), the Ancestral Celestial Master was conferred the title 'Great Law Master Aiding the Teaching of the Three Heavens.'

### Assists the mysterious essence of the Way, the Great Law Celestial Master. The Ancestral One of the Cavern of Unity, the manifested and aiding True Lord.
Aiding the teaching means assisting Taoism. Mystery is the Way. The essence of the Way is the process of cultivating the Way. In the Southern Song, Emperor Lizong further conferred the title 'Great Law Master Aiding the Primordial of the Three Heavens, Orthodox One, Peaceful Response, Manifested and Aiding True Lord.'

### The six directions are unbounded, the Most High Emperor, the Great Saint who descends to conquer demons and protect the Way, the Celestial Venerable.
The Chongzhen Emperor of Ming posthumously honored the Ancestral Celestial Master as 'Most High Emperor Unbounded in the Six Directions.' The Taoist community calls him 'Great Saint Descending to Conquer Demons and Protect the Way, Celestial Venerable.' The six directions—up, down, east, west, south, north—refer generally to the universe. To conquer demons is to subdue and remove evil spirits. To protect the Way is to safeguard Taoism. Celestial Venerable is an honorific for perfected immortals.
