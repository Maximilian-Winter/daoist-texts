# The Precious Edict of the Flowery Canopy

With reverent heart I take refuge and prostrate myself in worship.  
The Jade Purity, the Most High Sage; the Void Sovereign, the Utterly True.  
Lord of the Primordial Chaos Immortals, manifest and divide the spirits.  
Embracing the True, embodying the Way, whose功行 (merit and conduct) are fully perfected.  
He who drives the thunder and commands the lightning, blessing the realm and fostering the people's health.  
He assists loyalty and filial piety, abolishes guilt and prolongs life.  
The Ancestral Master of the Flowery Canopy, the Teacher of Men and Heaven.  
The collective scriptures say: the Minister of the Three Departments of Thunder and Lightning, the Great Immortal of the Golden Palace;  
the True Lord who manifests with fidelity to protect the nation, the Manifest Spirit of Assistance;  
the Supreme Minister who holds office in the Nine Heavens, the Mysterious and Profound Emperor, Master of the Wonderful Way of the Dao;  
the True Lord of the Great Void, who swiftly and rightly aids the Marvelous Spirit of the Three and Five Flights;  
the Emperor of the Southern Pole who directs life, the Immortal Minister of Profound Brightness;  
the Ruler of Sincerity, Master of the Nine-One Supreme Clarity, who manifests assistance, responsiveness, and true efficacy in the Marvelous and Remote;  
the Emperor of Great Brightness of the Northern Pole, who examines and inspects the Immortal Ministers;  
and the Heavenly Venerables of Three Realms who transform their forms.
