# Precious Declaration of the True Man of Nanhua

With earnest heart I take refuge and submit myself in reverence. He is the mysterious successor of Great Purity, the recluse official of the Lacquer Garden. His scriptures are recorded in Nanhua, and his conduct accords with the heart of Heaven. He assists the obscure and praises the teaching, being without name and without self. He mingles form and spirit, entering and emerging from the Great Void. He was the master and elder, Sang the True Man, who cultivated the Way at Nanhua; he took the fire-elixir of the Northern Meridian, and flew upwards embracing the calf. Riding upon the rectitude of Heaven and Earth, he governs the distinctions of the six breaths. He is equal with myriad things, and together with the Kun and Peng he roams at will. His virtue moistens all under Heaven, and his Way benefits ten thousand generations. Free and untroubled without dependence, he is alike in life and death. Great sage, great benevolence; great filial piety, great compassion. The compiler at the threshold of the Supreme Ultimate, subtle and profound, originally communicating the True Lord of Nanhua, who freely unfolds the mystery and saves the worldâ€”Great Heavenly Venerable.
