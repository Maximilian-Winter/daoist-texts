# Precious Admonitions of Lü the Progenitor

With devoted mind I bow and surrender myself in reverence.  
The Jade Clarity within, the Golden Gate selecting immortals.  
He transforms his body to be the master of the Three Teachings,  
Holding the laws and commanding the edicts of the Five Thunders.  
Awakened from the dream of millet, he forgets the honours and fame of the world;  
With the radiance of the treasured sword, he sweeps away the demons of the human realm.  
The four births and six paths, where there is feeling he surely responds;  
The three realms and ten directions, no request is left unanswered.  
On the head of the Yellow Crane Tower remain traces of the sage;  
Within the Jade Clarity Hall he refines cinnabar for the elixir.  
He preserves the image of the Way in the mountain shrine,  
Reveals the traces of immortals in the cloud caverns.  
He spreads the incense and fire of the dharma gate,  
Governs the ladder and ship of profound succession.  
Great compassion and great vow, great saint and great benevolence.  
He opens the mountain and initiates the teaching, the responsive ancestral master.  
The celestial thunder’s prime minister, the Spiritual Treasure True Man.  
The Pure Yang manifests the right warning and transformation, protecting and aiding the Sovereign Lord,  
Promoting and practicing the wondrous Way, the Heavenly Venerated One.
