# The Precious Edict of the Three Officials

With utmost reverence of heart I submit myself and bow in homage. Only the three holy sages are indeed one Great Ultimate. They advance to receive the mandate of the primordial calamity, and bear in their breasts the praise of countless ranks. The Purple Tenuity, clear and void, penetrates the Yin in its entirety and presides over all; merits and demerits are granted blessings; sins are pardoned and disasters relieved; they universally succour the living and the dead. Their Way surmounts the heavens, and their grace extends through the three realms. Great is their compassion and great their vow; great are their holiness and great their mercy. The Three Origins, the three orders, the Three Officials Great Emperors, and the Three Palaces with the Nine Mansions respond and manifest to the Heavenly Worthy.
