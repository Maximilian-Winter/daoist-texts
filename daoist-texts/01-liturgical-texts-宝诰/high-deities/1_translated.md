The Precious Admonition of Míluó

With utmost sincerity I bow and submit myself. Míluó, the Most High Heaven, the subtle existence, the mysterious and true realm. Remote and boundless is the purple-golden palace; the Great Subtlety, the jade-pure abode. The Limitless, the Most High Sage, the Void without end, shines with resplendent light. Silent and vast is the boundless origin, the mysterious pattern embracing all the ten directions. Deeply tranquil is the true and constant Way, broad and boundless is the great divine power. The Firmament is the True Old One, wonderfully perfect, pure and serene. Wisdom and eloquence, the supreme Way and highest honour. Master of the Three Realms, Ancestor of the Primordial Chaos. The Almighty Holy Lord, the Compassionate Father of the Four Lives. The High Heaven’s Most Holy One, the Great Compassionate and Benevolent. Perfect in ten titles, surrounded by myriad virtues. Boundless is his measure in saving men, delivering them from the pains of birth and death. Teacher of all Buddhas, King of all Sages. The Most High who opens Heaven, who holds the talisman, governs the calendar, contains the truth, embodies the Way in the Golden Palace, commands the Cloud Palace’s nine heavens, presides over myriad paths, in the great hall of spontaneous great illumination, the august Jade Emperor of the Vast Heaven, the Exalted Highest Deity of the Mysterious Firmament.

With sincere heart I bow and submit. The purple-golden palace of gold, the white jade capital. Dwelling in the realm of subtle existence, located above in the mysterious and true heaven.

With sincere heart I bow and submit. Within the resplendent realm and the land of wondrous bliss. The Holy Mother concentrates her spirit in a dream of emptiness; the Lord of the Way bestows the jade essence in a moment of trance. Compassionate and humble, she does not covet the honour of ten thousand chariots; bearing insult with gentleness, she fears not the toils of countless kalpas. Her功 is unparalleled, her virtue weighty and hard to measure. Great Compassion and Great Vow, Great Sage and Great Mercy. Behold the body of boundless功 and virtue, the Jade Emperor, the Most High Heavenly Lord.

With sincere heart I bow and submit. Residing in the imperial seat, high within the heavenly palace. Roaming throughout all the white jade capitals, universally appearing within the golden palaces of the ten directions. Settled and responsive, coming and going freely without restraint; united yet divisible, transformations perfect and unfathomable. Expounding the Way of pure and liberating release, to aid those sunk in ignorance, sorrow, and suffering. Natural and spontaneous, beyond the grasp of knowing or being known. Great Compassion and Great Vow, Great Sage and Great Mercy. Behold the body of pure and natural being, the Jade Emperor, the Most High Heavenly Lord.

With sincere heart I bow and submit. Formerly a royal scion, enduring hardships to establish profound功. The cultivation of over three thousand kalpas is but as a single day; the salvation of myriad living beings extends widely through the ten directions. Though the Dharma body arise from the embryo of the earthly spleen, truly the sacred body is the transformation of the origin of the Way. Indestructible and imperishable, vanishing and appearing without trace. Great Compassion and Great Vow, Great Sage and Great Mercy. Behold the divine and firm body, indestructible true emptiness, the Most High Dharma Body, the Jade Emperor, the Most High Heavenly Lord.

The Precious Admonition of the Jade Emperor

With utmost sincerity I bow and submit myself. Above the pure subtle heaven, in the Great Origin’s jade capital, knowing the appointed time to manifest the six supernatural powers, dividing the Dharma body and pervading the realms of the ten directions. Entering the boundless realm, heaven above and earth below all clearly harmonized. Sending forth wondrous sound, those of the six paths and four lives all attain liberation. Manifesting the auspicious mark of square light, revealing the excellent cause of this original practice. Vast and hard to name, majestic and unsurpassed. Great Compassion and Great Vow, Great Sage and Great Mercy. Dividing the body for response and transformation, the Jade Emperor, the Heavenly Lord who pardons sin.

The Precious Admonition of the Jade Emperor

With sincere heart I bow and submit. In the true void of the North Pole, honoured in the supreme seat. The original practice is all difficult ascetic practice; this body is the pure Way body. Forsaking kingdom and leaving family, bestowing treasures and shedding flesh and blood. Aiding those hidden and manifest, proclaiming correct transformation and displaying divine功. Teaching Bodhisattvas to awaken to the Great Vehicle, certifying golden immortals and entering the wondrous Way. As the compassionate father, truly a great man. Great Compassion and Great Vow, Great Sage and Great Mercy. The manifested body of the Jade Emperor, the pure, natural, awakened King Tathāgata.
