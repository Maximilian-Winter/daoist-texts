# Precious Invocation to Kui Star

With devoted heart I bow and surrender myself in reverence.  
The chief star of the constellations, the pure vital energy of Kui and Gang;  
The primal essence of Kui and Bi.  
The two poles gather their splendour, and the Five Phases hold fast to virtue.  
Upholding the literary destiny, it dwells in the subtle enclosure of the Twenty-eight Mansions.  
It examines the scholar's line, discerning the thirty-six thousand acts of goodness.  
By the merit of kindness it wipes away the cloud from the eyes,  
By virtue of secret deeds it nods approval in darkness.  
It opens the nature of the dull to intelligence,  
It enlightens the perplexed heart to understanding.  
Widely diffusing the transformation of filial piety, friendship, and letters,  
Aiding and praising the power of rank, fame, and emolument.  
In the fields of civil and martial affairs, within the Spring and Autumn garden.  
Beating the brush, flying the phoenix, and shining with colours,  
Shaving the beard and discarding the coarse robe to ascend in honour.  
It adjudicates the Golden List in the seven-curved Celestial Palace,  
It weighs the jade register in the Laurel Fragrance Halls, the Precious Halls.  
Great compassion, great vow, great benevolence, great power,  
Bestowing wisdom to communicate with spirits, supporting letters and assisting the Way,  
The Lord of the Kui Dou Star of the Eastern Wood Mansion.
