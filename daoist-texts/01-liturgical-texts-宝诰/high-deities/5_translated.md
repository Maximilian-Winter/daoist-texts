# Precious Injunctions of the Great Purity

With devoted heart I bow and submit myself in reverence.  
According to place, instruction is appointed; through kalpas men are delivered.  
A teacher to emperors, a teacher to sovereigns, a teacher to kings; names assumed and titles changed.  
He establishes the way of Heaven, the way of Earth, and the way of Men; he conceals the sage and reveals the common.  
He governs the lords of twelve hundred offices, embraces the Brahmanic breath of myriad myriad layers.  
His transformations have been practised from ancient times to the present; in the writings of the Way and its Virtue, in all five thousand words.  
He presides over Yin and Yang, commands thunder and lightning by the number ninety-five.  
Great Compassion, Great Vow, Great Sage, Great Mercy, the Most High Old Lord, the Heavenly Honoured of the Way and Virtue.
