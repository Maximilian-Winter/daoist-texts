# General Proclamation of the Four Sovereigns

With reverent heart and bowed spirit I pay homage.  
Vast and remote is the Purple-Gold Gate,  
Lofty and magnificent is the Jade-Green Palace.  
Here is held the authority of the Seven Governors of Ziwei,  
Here reigns the Lord of the Imperial Cycle in one continuous line.  
The Three Radiances nurture the blossoms,  
The Five Constellations display their rainbow banners.  
This is the pivot of Creation and Transformation,  
The chief handle of the human and divine.  
In the Great Luo Heaven above, within the Golden Gate Palace,  
The Four Sovereigns and the Four August Emperors,  
Their forms of gold and jade, the Celestial Honoured Ones.
