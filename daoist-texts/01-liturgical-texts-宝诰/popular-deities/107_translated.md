# The Precious Edict of Marshal Zhu

With heart devoted and mind bent, I bow and surrender.  
The Most High in the Heavenly Expanse, the Thunder Mansion of Fire and Rhinoceros.  
In his hand he lifts the iron chain, upon his back he bears the bag that pursues souls.  
His body bestrides the Black Tiger, his charge is to examine and affix (the laws).  
He severs and binds the yang souls, he restrains and governs the yin evils.  
He presides over the departments of wind, thunder, and rain; he commands the mountain streams and Fengdu.  
He cuts down demons, severs heads, dispels poison; he heals sickness and exterminates plague.  
No demon escapes his governance; what ghost dares to resist?  
Great compassion and great vow, most sage and most spiritual.  
He shoulders the sky as the Wind Earl, his spirit flies over the seas.  
He commands the great general who punishes those who disbelieve the Dao and its laws.  
He smites evil and destroys sorcerersâ€”the Black-faced Great God, Lord Zhu of Heaven.
