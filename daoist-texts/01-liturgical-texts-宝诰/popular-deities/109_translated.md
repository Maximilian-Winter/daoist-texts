# The Precious Edict of the Lord of Spirituality Wang

With devoted heart I bow and surrender my life in reverence.  
He is the Primordial Lord and General, the God of the One Breath.  
The Great Spirit Officer who governs the celestial realms of the Three Heavens, impartial and fierce in punishment.  
With golden eyes and red hair, he is called the Thunder Lord of the Three and Five Fire Chariots.  
With phoenix beak and silver teeth, he commands a million fierce divine generals, the pixiu.  
Soaring amidst clouds and mist, his commands are like thunderbolts.  
He brings down rain and clears the skies, expels demons and cures sickness.  
He observes faults and errors over twelve years, under the mandate of the Jade Emperor.  
He accumulates merits of countless kinds, vowing to assist the Patriarch.  
Utterly strong and supremely brave, he rescues both the dying and the living.  
Everywhere he proclaims the teachings of the Way, everywhere he opens the altar.  
The fierce officers of the Three and Five Fire Chariots are swift and resolute.  
The Lord of Thunder, Taiyi, responds and transforms as the Heavenly Venerable.
