# Precious Edict of the Heavenly Lord Ma

With a devoted heart I turn in reverence and submit.  
The Spirit Chief of the Dipper Mouth, the Supreme General of the Xuanji,  
Three-headed and open-faced, answering to the form that shines forth from the Three Terraces,  
Nine eyes resplendent, bearing the seal of the ninefold Dipper’s radiance.  
He holds the golden breath of the Western Spirit,  
His feet tread upon the white serpent,  
He wears the awe-inspiring spirit of the Southern Pole,  
Upon his back flies the red crow,  
Transforming and residing in the Court of Wind and Fire that surges to the heavens.  
Solely entrusted with the Northern Pole’s heavenly constellations,  
With treasured sword and pearl bell, he scatters and utterly destroys all demons and monsters.  
With the imperial bell and law seal, he proceeds, and spirits and ghosts all submit to him.  
Following the Zitong he presides over Literary Balance,  
Assisting the Purple Tenuity in managing fate and fortune.  
Great compassion and great vows,  
Great sagacity and great awe,  
Most High in the holy firmament,  
The revered king of the Jade Purity,  
The Primordial Lord of the Law and Marshal of the Original Origin,  
The True Lord of the Jade Mansion who governs fate,  
The bright splendour concealed,  
The silent Dao’s true august sovereign,  
The Great Immortal of the Southern Polar Fire Rhinoceros,  
The Northern Emperor and sovereign of the heavenly constellations,  
The fierce and mighty divine king who commands across the heavens,  
The great god of the Demon-subduing Thunder Command,  
Overseer of the Thunder and Lightning magistracy,  
Examiner, summoner, and captor of fateful generals,  
Master of clouds, thunder, rain, and lightning,  
Inspector of the evil demons of the Three Realms,  
The supreme administrator under heaven,  
The True Spirit Official Ma Tianjun of the Orthodox One,  
The Immovable Heavenly Venerable of the Great Unity and Thunder’s Voice.
