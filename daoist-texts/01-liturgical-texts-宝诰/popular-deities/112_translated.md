# Precious Edict of Lord Guan of Heaven

With devoted heart I take refuge and bow in reverence.  
The Great Sage who beheads demons, who inspects the Three Realms.  
The tribunal of ghosts and spirits, the captains and messengers appointed.  
The explorers throughout the Three Realms, the officers who seize ghosts.  
The Primordial Oneness of Qi, the Seven-ranked Great General who subdues dragons and tigers, the True Lord who guards the nation in lofty tranquillity.  
The Thunderbolt talisman bearer, the Great Envoy who punishes evil and summons to account.  
The Thirty-six Thunder Commanders, the Censor of the Penal Tribunal at Fengdu.  
Supervising the ghosts and spirits of the Three Realms, the great adjudicator of penal affairs.  
The overseer of criminal cases, the mighty Heavenly Ding of the Divine Firmament.  
Commander of the armies throughout the Three Realms, the Great Envoy who recruits soldiers.  
He who governs Heaven and Earth, who executes gods and slays ghosts, Marshal Guan, the Heavenly Lord of Manifest and Subtle Fruition.
