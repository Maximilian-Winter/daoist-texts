# The Precious Edict of General Yang Si

With sincere heart I bow and submit my life in reverence.  
The Primordial Heaven nurtures and transforms; in youth he attained the Way.  
In the realm of the abyssal waters, he calms the winds and waves to benefit boats and chariots.  
Within the gate of the Three Heavens, an imperial talisman commands to drive away pestilence and govern malign influences.  
Clad in golden armour and white robe, the axe and halberd are raised high.  
He cleaves the dragon and exterminates monsters; his divine power responds wondrously.  
The holy traces often manifest at Dongting; his mighty spirit flows throughout Chuan and E.  
No prayer goes unanswered; his virtue shelters the living people.  
Great Sage, great Compassion, supreme Righteousness, supreme Courage.  
Upon the Purple Cloud Terrace, he severed the dragon and attained the Way.  
The spiritual source communicates and aids all; General Yang Si.
