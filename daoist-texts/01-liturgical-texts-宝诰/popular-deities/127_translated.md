# Declaration of the City and Moat Deities

With sincere heart and reverent submission I pay homage.  
The ancient lords of soil and grain, the rightful gods of all under Heaven.  
They weigh the fortunes of the state, displaying deeds of loyalty;  
They receive the reward of good and punish the evil with benevolence.  
Lords of the capital city, attendants of the various prefectures;  
Subject to the thirteen departments of administration, examining and judging the eighteen offices.  
Temples and altars endure for ten thousand years, their grace supporting countless kalpas.  
They establish the sceptres of blessing and awe, and the authority to determine life and death.  
They wield divine power to guard the Ying River,  
Meeting the shadowy hosts and driving away the barbarian invaders.  
Most spiritual, most holy; upright and impartial,  
Protecting the state, preserving peace, assisting the sage kings.  
Mighty and efficacious, reverent gods of response and inspiration.
