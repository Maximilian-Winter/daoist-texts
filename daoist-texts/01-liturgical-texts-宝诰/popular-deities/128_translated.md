# Precious Injunction of the Director of Destinies in the Nine Heavens

With sincere heart I bow and submit myself in reverence.  
The office directs the throat and tongue, and presides over the kitchen and stove.  
It records the causes of human merits and faults, and according to due time presents them above.  
It embodies the transformations of Heaven and Earth in their generation, and shelters and protects the common people below.  
It drives away the spirits and demons that are unrighteous, and sweeps away the faults and diseases in the dust.  
The whole household enjoys felicity, and the dwelling prospers and flourishes.  
Morning and evening it receives the benevolence of assistance, and at the geng-shen hour it observes the eyes of right and wrong.  
Serene is the auspicious appearance, dazzling are the spiritual powers.  
Great compassion, great vow, great saint, great mercy.  
The Director of Destinies of the Nine Heavens, the Supreme Original Sovereign of Taiyi, the Heavenly Venerable who ordains blessings and reports good deeds.
