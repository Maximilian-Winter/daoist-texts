# The Sacred Ordinance of the Spirits of the Household and Dwelling

With devoted mind I bow and surrender myself in reverence. In the realm of the Divine Land, among ten thousand households, with respect to Heaven and the Ancestors, all spirits assemble together. The Generals who guard the dwelling, the Generals who protect the household, the sages and ancestors of successive ages, the Heaven and Earth, the sovereign State, the kinsfolk and teachers â€” all the deities within the home jointly preserve the peace and safety of the family. They punish evil and promote good, succouring the people. In sickness and disease, when prayers are offered, healing is granted. When pernicious arts invade, they are utterly destroyed. When the wind and water are not propitious, the place is transformed into a treasured site. Calamities are dispelled, and blessings and good omens gather in abundance. The house is purified, filth is removed, and ever is there cleanness and auspiciousness. They prosper and protect the household, enabling the clan to flourish. The silkworm spins its fine thread, the granaries and storehouses are full and well supplied. The labours upon the dwelling are accomplished, the renovations and affairs succeed. Only the spirits are to be feared and rejoiced in; I look up and bear the burden of their spiritual grace. Great is their compassion and great their vow; great is their holiness and great their mercy. In the hall, the awe-inspiring General of the Spirits, responding to the prayers of the myriad people, is the Divine Lord who guards the household, the Celestial Venerable.
