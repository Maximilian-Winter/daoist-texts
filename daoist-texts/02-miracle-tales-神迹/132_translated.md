# The Daoist of Wuyi Mountain Preserving the Matters of the Jade Emperor

Xu Huaiyuan was a Daoist of Mount Laoshan. He wandered to Wuyi Mountain, and loving the graceful and beautiful waters and hills of this place, he there took up his lodging at the Zhi-zhi Hermitage, cultivating the Tao and nourishing simplicity. Wuyi Mountain is a blessed land and grotto of Daoism, where spiritual energy gathers; the trees in the mountain rise to the heavens, and the winding Nine-Bend Stream flows clear and melodious, exceedingly suited for cultivation. Therefore, not only do cultivators of the Tao come and go to this place to pursue the Tao, but also the mountain spirits and ghosts are not wanting in the mountain, and they likewise cultivate there.

Behind the cinnabar chamber of the Zhi-zhi Hermitage lies the deep mountain, remote and deserted, where at night sometimes strange sounds are heard; but having dwelt there long, the Daoist took no heed. One night, Xu Huaiyuan, within the cinnabar chamber, burned incense and sat in quiet meditation. Suddenly he heard the sound of tiles upon the roof, and took it for a squirrel, giving no heed. But in a moment of reverie, there was a black shadow which from the window thrust forth its head, and looked about the interior of the room. Its form was like a man but not a man. Xu the Daoist knew at once it was a demon of the mountain, and quickly recited the Golden Light Mantra to protect his person. The black shadow was startled, and leapt through the window into the chamber, seeking to touch Xu the Daoist. Xu was greatly alarmed, and then bethought himself to transform his person into the Jade Emperor, his body shining with ten thousand rays of light, illumining the mountain forest, the three realms, and the ten directions. The black shadow was seized by the radiance, and fled away in dismay.

The Iron-Crowned Daoist says in the Jade Emperor's Repentance: "May I obtain the body illumined with radiance, always to be the light of the Emperor, and be seized and received thereby." When Xu Huaiyuan was tested by the evil demon, by calling to mind the Jade Emperor he was seized and received by the light of the Jade Emperor. Thus it is known that the scripture’s words are not false. If a man can think of the Tao, the Tao also thinks of him. Many in the world are deluded by external demons, though there be many outward causes. Rather than complain, it is better to think of the Tao and seek the true. The Patriarch Bai Yuchan said, "For cultivators, if every day they can hold in mind the sacred name of the Great Heavenly Lord of the Jade Emperor’s Pardon of Sins, then after a hundred years they shall not fall into the evil paths." To hold and recite the sacred name of the Jade Emperor brings deep and wondrous merit. Know that when I think of the Jade Emperor, the Jade Emperor also thinks of me; this body is ever under the protection of the Jade Emperor, calamity is removed and blessing comes, longevity is prolonged — this too may be attained.

Every year on the twenty-fifth day of the twelfth lunar month, at the hour of the Rat, the Jade Emperor descends to tour the heavens, universally inspecting the three realms. Throughout the empire, all the great and small palaces and temples respectfully welcome the imperial carriage.

The faithful devotees from the ten directions reverently offer their common sacrifices, gazing upon the golden countenance.

The Sovereign bestows his grace, universally illuminating the people below, his jade radiance spreading protection, and all beings are thereby saved.

The Jade Emperor’s Seventeen Great Lights: the Great Light of Marvelous Power, the Great Light of Compassion, the Great Light of Joyful Giving, the Great Light of Endurance, the Great Light of Equality, the Great Light of Gentleness, the Great Light of Freedom, the Great Light of Benefit, the Great Light of Fulfilment, the Great Light of Wisdom, the Great Light of Auspiciousness, the Great Light of Liberation, the Great Light of Refuge, the Great Light of Meritorious Deeds, the Great Light of Perfection, the Great Light of Non-Obstruction, and the Invincible Great Light.
