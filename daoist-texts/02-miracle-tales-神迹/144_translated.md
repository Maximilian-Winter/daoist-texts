# The Devoted Believer of Shaoxing Paying Reverence to the Celestial Master

Wang Guiying, a native of Shaoxing, was afflicted with a concealed malady. She sought various remedies, but the effects were not manifestly beneficial. In the autumn of the gengyin year, she journeyed with kinsfolk and friends to Mount Longhu, to pay homage at the ancient sites of the Celestial Master. On the eve before setting out, she dreamed that the Celestial Master Zhang sent a message to her, saying, "Thy health is infirm; when thou arrivest on the morrow, I will dispatch some to attend to thy cure."

On the following day, Wang Guiying, staying at an inn in Shangqing Town upon Mount Longhu, was visited by a female Taoist nun, who knocked at her door and said, “Art thou Wang Guiying? The Celestial Master Zhang hath sent me to treat thy sickness.” Wang Guiying, amazed, found that this accorded with the vision of her dream the night before, and was half persuaded. The female Taoist was of comely appearance and refined speech; after a course of acupuncture, Wang Guiying felt her whole frame unbound and at ease, her long-standing malady dispelled. She expressed great gratitude to this female Daoist, saying, “I came in haste and brought no gifts; on the morrow I shall present offerings at the Celestial Master’s mansion and give thee due thanks. Pray, how may I address thee, Master?” The female Taoist replied, “Blessings without measure. My humble family name is Hu.” After speaking, she took her leave.

On the second day, Wang Guiying purchased suitable gifts and went to the Celestial Master’s mansion to thank the Taoist Lady Hu. She inquired throughout the mansion, but all replied, “In the Celestial Master’s mansion there is no Daoist of the name Hu.” Wang Guiying found this strange. Upon leaving the Pavilion of Imperial Decrees, she happened to find the Fox Spirit Hall open for visitation, and ascended to offer homage. There she saw the spirit image enshrined therein, resembling very closely the Taoist Lady she had seen in her dream the night before. She then understood that the Celestial Master had commanded the Fox Spirit to assume the form of the female Daoist to cure Wang Guiying’s illness; and she bowed in gratitude and withdrew.
