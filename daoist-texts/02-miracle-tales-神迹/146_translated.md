# The Daoist of Liangzhou Who Seized a Ghost

In Liangzhou there was a certain Public Security Bureau troubled by ghosts; even by day when entering, one felt a gloom and chill. At times those on night watch could hear shrieks of anguish, or see dark shadows following behind them, clad in red robes with dishevelled hair, a very fearful sight. Several of the staff in succession met with strange deaths. The whole office was in a state of alarm. Some resorted to going to the Tibetan region to seek protective talismans; others recited incantations, but all were without effect. At this juncture, someone said to the chief, ‘There is at a place called the Jade Emperor Palace a Daoist named Sun Jinglian, who inherits the lineage of the Supreme Clarity, is versed in the art of thunder, and skilled in expelling demons and seizing ghosts; his efficacy is remarkable. Why do you not invite him to come and take a look? What say you?’

Daoist Sun came to the Public Security Bureau, produced a compass, and surveyed the terrain, saying: ‘This place sits facing Bing with Ren behind; the water gate is shut and blocks the passage, concealing the wind and gathering the qi; the feng shui is still good, presiding over both wealth and office in harmony. The former chiefs all enjoyed promotion.’ The chief confirmed this was indeed so. Daoist Sun then came to the northeast of the office building, saying: ‘In the Gen palace is the ghost gate, which ought to be quiet. Now you have installed a ventilation apparatus here; the haunting began since this fan was put in.’ The old public security officer said: ‘That is true; we put in this device in 2007, and from the latter half of 2007 the disturbances began.’ Daoist Sun walked round this corner, turning about, saying: ‘Here, dig three feet of earth, and there will be a coffin.’ The bureau promptly summoned some diggers to open it. Daoist Sun said: ‘No haste; first the ghost must be seized, then you may look.’

So in the courtyard was erected an altar, with offerings to Master Zhang, the Great Emperor of Fengdu, Marshal Tianpeng, and others; a jar was prepared, covered with red cloth, and filled with water. Daoist Sun walked the magic lines, calling upon whatever spirits might be present. Soon a chill wind was felt. The Master rang the three-pure bells, drawing the ghost into the jar, then sealed it with a talisman. When all was done, he said to the chief: ‘The fierce ghost has been caught; what remains is to remove the dead’s remains, and thereafter all will be peaceful.’ The chief asked: ‘How do you know the ghost is caught?’ Daoist Sun said: ‘At Maoshan when catching ghosts, they are sealed inside a porcelain jar filled with water; once the ghost enters, the water ceases to flow. If you do not believe, try for yourself.’ The chief dared not move the jar; Daoist Sun took it up and shook it, asking: ‘Do you hear the water moving?’ The chief was amazed. He asked: ‘What is to be done with this jar?’ Daoist Sun said: ‘Can it be left with you? I shall take it back to the temple gate, to keep watch over the temple.’ At noon the next day diggers were summoned; in less than an hour there was indeed a coffin, the corpse not yet decayed.

The Iron-Crowned Daoist said: ‘A grave, if its feng shui is not good, will easily cause the spirit of the dead to become a fierce ghost; if its tomb be disturbed, it will harm the living. When such happens, call upon a Master to subdue it. Therefore we must be reverent to the dead, respecting the master within the tomb.’
