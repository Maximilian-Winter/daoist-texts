# The Account of Hu Aiguo of Nanchang and the Efficacy of His Good Deeds

Hu Aiguo was a native of Wangcheng in Nanchang, born in the years of the Republic. In his youth he received the precepts at Qingyunpu, being a lay disciple of the Jingming sect. Amidst the troubles of the age, he did not forsake his original purpose, but made the salvation of others the intent of his heart. During the period of the Cultural Revolution, when intellectuals were sent down to the village where Hu Aiguo dwelt, the Hu family all took pains to care for them. Moreover, he delighted in charity and freely bestowed alms; whenever he saw those poor and needy, he would either give them porridge and rice or money. His hidden merit was manifest, and his virtuous deeds daily renewed. In the year 2005 he passed away, and his family interred him by the side of Jiulong Lake.

In the year 2011, Nanchang undertook extensive demolition and reconstruction for a new city; Jiulong Lake was included within the planned district, and Hu Aiguo’s grave was required to be removed. The descendants of the Hu family invited a Daoist priest to perform the removal of the tomb. When the grave was opened, the coffin was found very clean, without any bones, only a single shoe remaining; upon it grew a single fungus of lingzhi. The Daoist was amazed, and inquired of the mourners, “Who is the person in this tomb? What was his occupation in life?” The mourners related to the Daoist the deeds of Hu Aiguo in his lifetime. The Daoist said, “Your honoured father may have by now undergone the process of corpse liberation and become an immortal; this lingzhi is a token of auspicious response, and this is the reward of merit that has attained to divinity.” The family were incredulous, but took the lingzhi away. Should illness arise, but a small piece is needed, and in general one may be healed; it is most efficacious.
