# The Experience of Qian Daxin of Jiyuan with the Scripture of the Three Officials

Qian Daxin was a man of Jiyuan. In his early years he delighted in valour and fierce contention, and was fond of associating with the petty ruffians of the world. Indeed he did many evil deeds. In the year 1906 (of the Republic), the government of Jiyuan City resolved to extend the urban district, which reached to the village of Qian Daxin. Qian Daxin obtained a considerable indemnity, and resolved henceforth to engage in commerce and trade, and to live a good life.

But who would have thought that heaven was not to be content with man’s desires! Qian Daxin invested in several projects one after another, yet all ended in loss. He was greatly troubled, and so he sought out a local sorceress to ask why his enterprises all came to loss. The sorceress said, ‘In your youth you did many evil deeds. You have injured your hidden virtue (yin de), and spoiled your destined fortune and life. Though you now temporarily enjoy splendour and honour, it is because your grandfather once saved a human life. But the Three Officials are examining and recording your deeds, and your allotted years of life are only until the year 1909.’ Qian Daxin was displeased, and took no heed of these words.

But not long after, he felt unwell and sought examination at the hospital. It was found that his liver was afflicted with dropsy, and there were other illnesses also. Remembering the words of the sorceress, he was seized with fear, and again sought her out, to inquire after means of deliverance.

The sorceress told him thus: ‘The sins and blessings of mankind, their causes and conditions, are all subject to the examination and recording of the Three Great Officials. Those who do good are recorded to be born in heaven, increasing blessing and prolonging life; those who do evil are sent down to hell, to poverty, lowliness, and early death. Though in the human world one may escape the punishment of the law, yet the net of heaven is wide-reaching, though loose, it lets nothing escape; the spirits watch over all, minutely and without error. If you now desire to prolong your life and seek blessing, there is but one way. That is, on the one hand to recite and hold fast to the Scripture of the Three Officials, praying the Three Great Officials to grant leniency in their weighing and examination; and on the other hand to do many good deeds and widely sow the fields of blessing. Otherwise, if your evil be full measure, and your appointed time draws near, not even the immortals can save you.’

Qian Daxin, having heard these words, was very heavy of heart, and repented the things he had done; he knew all was the creation of his own making, and could blame no other. Now, to change these things, he could rely only on himself. So on the one hand he distributed money in alms, helping poor students to study, assisting impoverished families, and supporting the Three Jewels; and on the other hand he kept fasts at home, and recited the Scripture of the Three Officials. After more than a month, Qian Daxin dreamed of a youth, whose countenance was bright and lustrous, clad in a blue round-collared robe, and wearing a Tang headdress, who said, ‘I am a functionary under the Three Origins, officer of examination and recording. Because you do many good deeds and recite the Scripture of the Three Officials, the Three Great Officials say they will temporarily grant you a reprieve. If you dare still to do evil, your life shall be taken; but if you can turn to good, you shall be granted long years.’

Upon waking, the matters of the dream seemed as clear as truth. He went again to the hospital for examination, and the measures of his liver were all tending towards the normal. Qian Daxin dared not neglect himself, and henceforth was more earnest in doing good and reciting the scripture; both his body and his fortunes gradually improved.
