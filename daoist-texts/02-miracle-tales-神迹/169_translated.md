# The Verification of the Heaven-Honoured One of Tangxing Weir

Tangxing Weir is but a small dam of a watercourse in a village. Every winter the villagers maintain the embankment, preparing for the spring ploughing. Much labour and wealth are expended; yet when the flood comes the following year, the embankment breaks. Year after year this occurs, and the reason remains unknown. One of the persons in charge of Tangxing Weir had a dream, in which a voice said to him: "I am the statue of the Sage, honoured by all under Heaven and all nations; but the country folk are so ignorant as to use me to prop up the embankment. That man has already been punished by the Spiritual Officer (the Taoist guardian spirit), and is now dead. If you do not fetch me forth from beneath the embankment, this Tangxing Weir will never be completed."

On the morrow, the person in charge told all the villagers of his dream. They prepared an altar with incense and went to cleanse the embankment. Indeed they found a stone statue of the Heaven-Honoured One. Though long immersed in water, the black hair and golden crown were unspoiled; the colours were fresh and bright. The villagers built a temple to offer it worship; all requests were answered, and it proved very efficacious. From that time forth, no breach of Tangxing Weir was ever known.
