# The Official Jin's Disregard in Entering the Temple of the Yellow Emperor

At Xian Du Mountain in Jinyun, Lishui, stands the Temple of the Yellow Emperor, where the progenitor of human culture, Xuanyuan Huangdi, is venerated. From time immemorial its efficacious power has been manifest and cannot be fully recorded. Since the building of the Yellow Emperor's temple, many high officials of the court have come to pay their respects. When the present sovereign held the office of prefect of Zhejiang at Longqian, he also once came to worship Xuanyuan Huangdi; the following year he was summoned to the capital and promoted to a high minister of the cabinet.

Some years ago, a certain officer of a certain department in a certain city, surnamed Jin, came to visit Xian Du Mountain for pleasure. Entering the hall of Xuanyuan, he made no obeisance, professing himself a materialist. After leaving the hall, he found his legs and feet unsteady; often he would fall down to his knees; at first he paid no heed to it. Afterwards he went to Mount Putuo, where an aged monk well versed in cultivation said to Jin, ‘Sir, did you not fail to kneel when you went to the temple last month?’ Jin answered, ‘Indeed I did; how do you know?’ The monk said, ‘I saw a divine soldier with a staff following behind you, striking your calves. Have you not lately been often unable to stand firmly and fallen to the ground?’ Jin was greatly alarmed, and said, ‘Yes! Last month when I went to Xian Du Mountain to the temple of the Yellow Emperor, I did not kowtow and burn incense before Xuanyuan Huangdi. Could this be the cause?’ The monk said, ‘It should be so. This divine soldier claims to be a guardian spirit under the command of Xuanyuan Huangdi.’ At once Jin called the attendant who guarded the mountain and said he wished to come to worship the Yellow Emperor. The attendant answered, ‘Did you not come a few days ago?’ Jin then related the whole affair.

Jin came to the hall of Xuanyuan at Xian Du Mountain, and respectfully offered three incense sticks, performing three kneelings and nine prostrations, worshipping according to the rite. He repented of his proud and arrogant heart; after worshipping, he no longer fell when walking. Thus he knew that Xuanyuan Huangdi was awe-inspiring and mighty; the divine spirits above, how insignificant was he! Yet the divine spirits are transcendent and detached from the world, and do not need to concern themselves whether one kneels before them or not. To worship them does not add to their dignity, nor does neglect diminish their power. This is because the holy spirits, with earnest care, teach by way of admonition, hoping that Jin may lay down his arrogance and cultivate humility. Upon close reflection, this is indeed a skilful and expedient instruction.

In praise it is said:  
The progenitor of Huaxia is called Xuanyuan,  
He forged the tripod and ascended to the ninth heaven.  
The foolish common man, in self-conceit,  
Brings down the mighty spirit’s punishment upon himself.
