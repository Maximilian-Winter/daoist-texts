# Records of Dragon and Tiger Mountain: Wearing the Talisman to Prolong Life by Thirty Years

Records of Dragon and Tiger Mountain relate: wearing the talisman prolonged life by thirty years; donning coarse robes to cultivate the Way, serving the Celestial Master. Though this story be small, yet it may directly point to the characteristics of the cultivation of disciples of the Orthodox Unity, and the efficacy of their methods.

From the time when the Fourth Celestial Master Zhang Sheng returned to Dragon and Tiger Mountain to live in seclusion and cultivate, down to the Fourteenth Celestial Master Zhang Cizheng, there have been eleven successive Celestial Masters of the Zhang lineage who have each chosen to retire and diligently cultivate in solitude. The Fourth Celestial Master Zhang Sheng once sighed and said: ‘Our ancestors transmitted the Daoist arts, often choosing the eldest son to receive the teaching. The eldest son must marry and bear children, so as to transmit the Daoist arts through the lineage. The other brothers voluntarily abstain from marriage, yet serve the Celestial Way.’

Each year, at the San Yuan festival — when the Heavenly Official bestows blessings, the Earthly Official pardons sins, and the Water Official relieves calamities — the successive Celestial Masters of the Zhang lineage would open the altar to confer talismans. Thus, over the course of five hundred years of expounding the Way and spreading the teaching, the social influence of the Orthodox Unity once again became widely known throughout the realm. By the time of the Tang dynasty, even some wealthy and noble persons, who held no faith in the Great Way, would, following the fashion and when convenient, casually accept the talismans of the Orthodox Unity with an indifferent attitude.

In the Tang dynasty, in Jiangxi, there was a great wealthy merchant who was such a case. He was very rich, near Dragon and Tiger Mountain, and was able to give alms according to circumstance. Under these circumstances, this great merchant called Liu Qian, quite heedlessly received the talisman and wore the charm.

In the very year after receiving the talisman, Liu Qian went to Nanjing to conduct a large purchase. Due to the fatigue of travel, upon arriving in Nanjing, Liu Qian immediately took lodging in an inn to rest. The next day, when the sun was already high, the usually early-rising and strictly self-disciplined Liu the wealthy man still kept his door shut and did not come out. The attendants called the innkeeper to open the door, and upon opening, found Liu Qian already breathless and his body stiff.

As they mourned Liu Qian’s passing and prepared his funeral, unexpectedly, two days later, Liu Qian’s body began to grow warm again, and breath returned to him. When fully recovered, Liu Qian related to those present a most extraordinary story. He said: ‘That night, being over-tired from the journey, after lodging, I fell asleep. In my dream, I was seized by the officials of the underworld and taken to Hell. In my despair and terror, crying out with no one to hear, a golden light descended from heaven; a celestial official clad in yellow robes came floating down, holding a court document. He read aloud before the two underworld officials: "Liu Qian wears the Orthodox Unity talisman; his name is registered in the heavens, not among the registers of the underworld. His allotted time having been fulfilled, his life is extended by thirty years."’

Through this experience of death and revival, especially the deeply engraved feeling of terror and helplessness in hell, with cries unheeded, Liu Qian, this great wealthy merchant, came to a true understanding that wealth, fame, and power are but external things. In the most helpless moment, when help is most needed, only the Orthodox Unity talisman obtained without intention of gain actually saved him.

This Liu, a great benefactor and deeply rooted in good origins, resolutely left his home, hastened to Dragon and Tiger Mountain, followed the Celestial Master, and began austere cultivation, ultimately attaining good fruit.

The Celestial Master whom Liu Qian followed was the Nineteenth Celestial Master Zhang Xiu. This Zhang Master was simple in character, often wore coarse cloth, tilled the fields himself, seldom consorted with the villagers, yet annually taught and healed with talismanic methods. At the age of eighty-three he built his own tomb, declaring that he would depart the year after next. At the appointed time, he bathed and changed his garments, sat upright and transformed, aged eighty-five years.
