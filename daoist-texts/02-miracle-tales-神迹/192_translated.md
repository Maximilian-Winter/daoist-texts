# The Story of the Guardian Immortal of Mount Jinkai in Huzhou

Mount Jinkai in Huzhou is an important stronghold of the Quanzhen Longmen sect in the southern region of the Yangtze. It is said that the guardian immortal of this mountain is a female immortal named Hu Ganggang.

Hu was a native of Qingpu in the Prefecture of Songjiang (now Qingpu County of Shanghai), her original name being Manyue. She was the adopted daughter of the family of Yang He. In her childhood she met a stranger who imparted to her the secrets of alchemy; by the age of nine her skill was already very remarkable. At twelve years old her yang spirit went forth, her body remaining in a state of meditation with the form immovable. Her family mistook her for dead, and therefore buried the corpse. The yang spirit returned but found no original body, and often appeared at night in visible form; afterwards she appeared also by day, causing great uneasiness in the Yang household. A Daoist of the Longmen sect, named Qingyun, chanced to pass by; the Yang family did not tell him of the recent manifestations of Ganggang.

At midnight Qingyun heard a voice calling, ‘Return my dwelling place!’ The sound grew nearer. The Daoist thought it strange, and focused his spirit to observe. The soul and form of Manyue appeared; the Daoist bade her come forward. She came calmly, not like an ordinary ghost or spectre. The Daoist’s keen eyes saw no trace of fear, and he concluded that she was no demon. On inquiry he learned the truth, and knew that her body had been destroyed. Moved with pity, yet thinking that she could not be immediately delivered, he first ordered her to depart. Manyue, tears filling her eyes, looked most sorrowful. The Daoist called her again, and read to her the ‘Law of the Female Blue Ghost’ (a code of discipline established in Daoism for ghosts and spirits), and Manyue knelt and received the precepts.

After receiving the precepts, Manyue said to the Daoist, ‘If you can restore to me my body, and let my original spirit dwell therein, then after attaining the Way I will surely repay you richly.’ The Daoist lit a basin of red coals on the left side, and a bowl of clear water on the right, and said, ‘Your body is in the water; try to enter and seek it there.’

Manyue then entered the water basin; after a long while she came out and said, ‘It is not there.’ The Daoist said, ‘Since it is not in the water, then it must be in the fire; try to enter and seek it there.’ Manyue entered the fire; after a long time she came forth in tears, saying, ‘It is not in the fire either; it seems I shall not attain the Way.’ The Daoist shouted, ‘Foolish woman! The mysteries of the immortals are but that one enters the water and is not wetted, enters the fire and is not burned. Now you come and go freely; in neither element is there any hindrance to you. Have you not already reached the goal of your heart? Why then cling to that broken body? From now on, if only you maintain firm your faith, gather together your spirit, appear and disappear according to the right way, protect and guard the orthodox teaching, obtaining three thousand merits complete, and eight hundred kinds of good deeds perfect, to be bestowed with the rank of immortal will not be far off.’

Manyue, hearing this, was greatly enlightened; she bowed nine times and said aloud, ‘Master!’ The Daoist then bestowed upon her several verses, saying, ‘Whenever anyone recites these verses, you are to come at the summons; if you refuse to come you will not attain the Way.’ Manyue wept as she took leave, saying, ‘I will surely obey your teachings.’ Then clouds rose beneath her feet, and she rose slowly, vanishing from sight.

From that time the Yang family was peaceful and without trouble. The Daoist Qingyun recorded the verses for summoning Ganggang in a book. Throughout the ages, whenever a successor Daoist chants the verses, Ganggang will come and obey the law. It is said that she has been conferred the rank of ‘Jade Maiden of the Great Void’ and granted immortality, forever serving as the guardian immortal of Mount Jinkai.
