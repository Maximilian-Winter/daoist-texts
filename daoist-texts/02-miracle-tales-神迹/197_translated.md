# The Great Filial Yang, the Great Immortal of Filial Piety in Hemp Garments

He who is skilled in medicine relieves the world; filial piety moves Heaven. The Immortal of the Medicine Bridge, the Immortal in Hemp Garments, alone for eight hundred years walks the path of old; the incense and offerings have their destined place here. The filial son through the ages, the renowned physician through the ages; for thirty springs competing to transmit the wondrous secrets, his grace and beneficence extend without bounds to these people. This speaks of the great immortal among the folk of Hunan.

The Great Immortal in Hemp Garments is also called Yang the Filial Immortal, because in his lifetime he was a most filial son. According to the Records of Liuyang County, his name was Yang Yaoting; of Liuyang in the era of the Tang, Tianbao period. He pursued the art of medicine and travelled far and wide to treat disease, curing countless cases, especially skilled in the ailments of children. Once, when he went out to practise medicine and did not return, his mother fell ill suddenly and died; grief-stricken and unwilling to live, Yang Yaoting felt ashamed before his mother. Therefore, clad in hemp cloth, he observed the three years of mourning, and then drowned himself in a pond to the left side of the martial exercise ground outside the Eastern City. Several months later, a lotus flower grew in the pond; the villagers discovered that this lotus had grown forth from the mouth of Yang the Filial Son, and Yang’s countenance remained ruddy as in life. The villagers thus believed that Yang’s filial heart had moved Heaven and Earth, and that he had ascended to become an immortal. Hence, they reverently honoured him as the Great Immortal in Hemp Garments, also called the Immortal Yang, the Filial Immortal Yang.

The country folk revered him for his healing and for his steadfast practice of filial piety. Because he practised medicine in life, when any was sick, they wore white garments and went to pray for a medicine lot. If, according to the lot, the medicine was taken and the disease cured, they would proceed from their homes, with a bow every five steps, to the temple to give thanks; thus the number of his worshippers was very great. It was also said that he showed special favour to children; whenever a child was ill, the prayer for a medicine lot was especially efficacious. Later, the range of popular belief in him gradually widened.

In the eleventh year of the Tongzhi reign, a great drought afflicted Pingjiang. The governor prayed for rain, and in a dream saw him come to aid, whereby great rain was obtained. The governor then presented a memorial to the court, receiving an imperial edict conferring the title of “Local Worthy,” and permitting the holding of the spring and autumn sacrifices by the local people. His name is known beyond the ages; filial piety abides between Heaven and Earth; filial piety moves Heaven. His fame and power extend throughout the lands of Hunan and Jiangxi.
