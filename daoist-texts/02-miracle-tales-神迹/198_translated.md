# The City God’s Clever Judgment—The Top Scholar’s Mistaken Burning of the Temple

It is said that at the beginning of the great founding of the Ming, through the vigorous promotion of the illustrious Taizu Zhu Yuanzhang, the faith in the Taoist City God spread throughout the land, and because of frequent manifestations of efficacy, it was increasingly revered by the people.

On one day, at the City God Temple in some place of Jiangsu and Zhejiang, a man named Li the Carpenter brought with him a woman and a child into the great hall.

The matter was this: Li the Carpenter’s hen that laid eggs had gone missing. The child said that he had seen the woman secretly eating the hen, but the woman denied it with oaths. Helpless, Li the Carpenter brought both before the City God to seek verification. Having entered the hall, Li explained the case to the Taoist attendant on duty, and the three then knelt together before the seat of the Lord. The child and the woman even agreed that if either should speak falsely, they prayed that the City God would render them unable to rise.

After lighting incense and bowing their heads, having each in their hearts reported the circumstances to the Lord, the woman stood up, but the child’s legs became numb and he could not move. Thereupon, Li the Carpenter concluded that the child had indeed spoken falsely, and pardoned the woman.

Time passed and stars shifted; in the twinkling of an eye, twenty years went by. On this day, the newly successful top scholar returned home, and unexpectedly, the first matter he did was to go to the City God Temple.

Even more unimaginable was that upon entering the temple, he did not burn incense and worship, but instead threw down the gilded image of the City God, upset the incense burner, and set fire to the place...

For a moment, the villagers stood aghast.

Then the top scholar stood on a high place and explained: “When I was but a child, I clearly saw a woman secretly eating the hen belonging to our neighbour Li the Carpenter. Yet in the temple the City God declared me to be lying. Tell me, should such a deity still be worshipped?”

The villagers heard this and were struck with astonishment.

Suddenly, thunder sounded in peals, and the City God’s image, already cast down, faintly emitted a human voice, revealing the truth.

It was so that the woman in question had been with child, and in a moment of craving, she cooked the hen belonging to Li the Carpenter. When she bowed before the City God, her heart was clear of the facts, contrite for her sin, and she declared that thereafter she would seek means to compensate Li.

The City God’s divine eyes, piercing as lightning, had naturally discerned all, but considering the woman was indeed with child, fearing harm to the unborn, and perceiving her sincere repentance, he judged the child—who is now the top scholar—to have spoken falsely.

At the same time, the City God, knowing his error in judgment, secretly aided the child, taking forms to advise him to study diligently, so that at length he held the foremost place, achieving success and renown.

The top scholar, hearing this, was silent and ashamed in his heart; forthwith he commanded that the gilded image be remade and the City God Temple rebuilt.

Thereafter, the top scholar became a local magistrate, stern and impartial, just and incorruptible, beloved by the people, who gave him the sobriquet “Clear Sky.”

Seeing is not always believing; hearing is not always truth; the peach and plum trees are silent, yet beneath them a path is formed.

Thus it is that “Heaven’s way is manifest and supports the upright; the spirits are illustrious and protect the sincere.”
