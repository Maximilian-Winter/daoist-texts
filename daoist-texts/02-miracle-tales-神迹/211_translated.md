# The Matter of Liu Zhichang of Anhui Requesting a Buddhist Talisman

Li Zhichang was a man of She County in Anhui. Some years ago he went to Thailand and expended several tens of thousands of cash to request a little ghost, a spirit-talisman made by a Thai master of the black arts, who had it prepared by a local adept. Within it was placed the ashes of the bones of a female infant spirit. Upon his return he wore it about his neck, and thenceforth when he went forth to gamble he won almost every day, and was exceedingly joyful. He deemed that the several tens of thousands spent were well bestowed, and that the Buddhist talisman was truly efficacious.

But this good fortune did not endure long; not long after, Liu began to suffer from insomnia. One night Li Zhichang felt a chill wind blowing in his chamber; suddenly opening his eyes, he saw a little girl standing at his bedside. Feeling ill at ease and fearful, Li immediately cast away the talisman.

Yet the matter did not thus end. From that time forth, tumult arose in Li’s household; every night when he lay down and closed his eyes, he heard the voice of the little girl calling him “father.” Li’s wife was with child, but on account of this she miscarried.

In despair, Li sought out diviners and mediums far and wide, engaging several spirit women to examine the case, but to no avail. Afterwards, he entrusted a famous Daoist of the Zhengyi sect from Liu’an to come to his house. This Daoist was surnamed Wu, with the Daoist name Dingye. He followed the orthodox teachings of the Celestial Master, had received the Mandate and the Scripture of the Alliance, and was born in a family of Daoists. From youth he had studied the Daoist arts; his spiritual vision was open, and he was adept at drawing talismans, capturing ghosts, and expelling evil to cure disease. Upon arriving at Li’s house, he asked, “Did you request an object of yin?” Li replied, “I requested a little ghost in Thailand.” Daoist Wu said, “That little ghost is now present in your house, and so on.” Li Zhichang was filled with terror, and earnestly implored the Daoist’s compassionate aid.

Thereupon Daoist Wu chose a day of heavenly calamity and dire constellations, and established a ritual altar. At Li’s house he performed a Lingbao rite of refinement and deliverance, and thus the little ghost was exorcised and sent away. Then he recited several scrolls of the Jade Pivot and the Eastern Peak Sutra, to cleanse away the evil and filth. He admonished Li, saying: “In future you must not again request such things. Whether little ghosts or Buddhist talismans, the initial good fortune is but an early consumption of one’s allotted blessing. When the blessing is exhausted, disaster necessarily comes. Moreover, ghosts are beings of yin nature; to be near them is inauspicious, causing illness and poverty; one must be cautious indeed.” When departing, he gave Li a spiritual talisman, instructing him to hang it behind the door, which would ensure safety.
