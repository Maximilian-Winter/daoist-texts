# The Story of Layman Zhang Who Asked the Way after a Miscarriage

Layman Zhang was a native of Huanggang in Hubei. In the year of Bing-shen, owing to certain causes, he suffered a miscarriage. Under the guidance of a monk of the Temple of Supporting the State, he recited every night the *Sutra of Kṣitigarbha*, and in the spring of the year Ding-you, he made pilgrimage to the sacred ground of the Bodhisattva Kṣitigarbha. Yet Layman Zhang’s condition did not improve; strange and marvellous occurrences became more grievous; he was troubled by nightmares and loss of wealth; and his lover parted from him on that account.

Greatly perplexed, Layman Zhang sought counsel from a Chan master. The master said, “Thy burden of karmic retribution is heavy; if thou wilt but often recite the *Sutra of Kṣitigarbha*, all will be well.” Finding no better means, Layman Zhang turned to the Great Way. A Daoist adept gave him instruction; he thereupon undertook the supreme rite of the Yellow Register, fasting for a whole day and night, and issued the Yellow Register pardon in white slips, thus liberating the souls of the orphaned spirits and unborn infants. From that time onward, the troubles were in great measure resolved.

Layman Zhang was exceeding glad, and he recounted this to the Chan master of the Temple of Supporting the State. The master said, “That Daoist adept was the manifestation of a Bodhisattva, come to aid thee. Now that thy case is settled, thou must repay thy vows by visiting the Bodhisattva’s sacred ground.” Hearing this, Layman Zhang deemed it reasonable; he made ready his luggage, secured his carriage ticket, and went to make pilgrimage.

When descending the mountain, he stumbled and fell, and from that time lost his soul; even to the present his mind is deranged, and he often says that some one follows after him. Again he sought the Daoist adept, who said, “With compassion I say, this poor Daoist cannot deliver thee. Thy burden of karmic retribution is yet heavy; if thou wilt but often recite the *Sutra of Kṣitigarbha*, all will be well.”
