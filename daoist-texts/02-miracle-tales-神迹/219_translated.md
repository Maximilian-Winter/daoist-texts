# Chen Chongmiao of Xiushui and His Lack of Sincerity in Seeking the Method

Chen Chongmiao was a man of Xiushui. When he was but a youth of some ten years or so, he began to follow the local elder Taoist masters in learning to perform the rites. After three years of apprenticeship were completed, he prepared to receive his commission and the register of credentials. Accordingly, he summoned the famous exalted Taoists of Xiushui, who came to act as the Three Great Masters.

When the rites of transmission are performed in various places, according to the ancient custom, the master must pass on the method. How is this method passed on? Practices differ from place to place. In some regions, the master drinks a mouthful of water, holds it in his mouth, then spits it out for the disciple to drink. Elsewhere, the master eats food, masticates it thoroughly, then spits it out for the disciple to consume. There are even places where morsels of meat which have been in the master's mouth are given. In other places, the master spits into a cup, and the disciple drinks thereof.

Now, on the day of receiving his commission and transmission, several venerable Taoist masters, all of them aged seventy or eighty years, ascended the altar. When the rite of passing on the method came, these elder gentlemen chewed their food thoroughly and spat it out for Chen Chongmiao to eat. Chen Chongmiao felt it unclean and would not swallow it; he sought a place apart and spat it out. The ritual was completed; the register of credentials was received; and no one remarked upon the matter.

On the following day, as Chen Chongmiao passed by the place where the food had been spat, he saw scattered on the ground talismans, incantations, registers, and the like. Then did he begin to repent deeply.

The Iron-Crowned Daoist said: 'In general, when the immortals transmit their methods, they sometimes take on shapes that are loathsome to the eye. Very often this is to test the sincerity of the seeker after the Way, whether his heart is true. If the prejudices of the world are not yet cast aside, how can he attain the true meaning of the Great Way? The error of Chen Chongmiao lay in his insincere heart in seeking the Way, and his insufficient faith in it, so that he missed the Great Way as it passed him by. In his eyes, he saw only the aged bodies of the elder Taoists, and not the Taoist methods which they handed down. Some men, relying on their worldly wealth and status, disdain the true and treat the Great Way with neglect. How few such men are there in the world? Yet they fail to know that wealth and status are but dreams, illusions, bubbles, and shadows, fleeting and passing in an instant; while the Great Way is vast and boundless, enduring through endless ages.'
