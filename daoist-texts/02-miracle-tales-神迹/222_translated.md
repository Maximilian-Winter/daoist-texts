# The Story of Master Xiao of Nanning and the Errors in the Scriptures

Master Xiao, the steward of Taihe Temple in Nanning city, undertook the restoration and rebuilding of the temple. The Daoist priests of the temple received many tasks of reciting the scriptures and performing repentance ceremonies. At times, when the work was too pressing, Master Xiao would say to Master Gao Gong, “Perform the rites with speed; if there are places that can be omitted, skip them.” Master Gao Gong replied, “Steward, is this right? Would it not be a fault?” The steward said, “We earn money for the temple’s repair, not for our own feasting and drinking. What fault is there? If there is fault, I alone will bear it.” Master Gao Gong had no choice but to consent. Sometimes a prayer for blessing was finished in half an hour. The Qingxuan ritual of offering and refining was completed in somewhat more than an hour. The sequence of the sections was confused, scriptures were mistaken or omitted; on one occasion, at midday after drinking wine, Master Xiao ascended the altar and recited the Huang Jing. In time, all became accustomed to this, and regarded it as no great matter.

In the turning of three or five years, the temple was near completion. Master Xiao suddenly felt unwell, and upon examination in the hospital it was found that he was already in the last stage of cancer. Before his death, Master Xiao lay in the pill chamber, pulling out the straw laid beneath his quilt and eating it, saying, “This tastes good.” No entreaties could restrain him, and soon he passed away. All believed this to be a sign that in the next life he would be reborn as an ox or a horse.

The Iron-Crowned Daoist said: In the Eastern Mountain there are monks and Daoists who act as officers, specially appointed to examine the merits and faults of monks and Daoists. There is also the Institute of Supplementing Scriptures, wherein are many small dark chambers. When monks and Daoists, in their lifetime, recite scriptures and commit errors or omissions, after death they must go to the place of supplementing scriptures to complete what was left out, before they can be released. Some who dwell dispersedly and go forth to perform rites find errors or omissions in characters, and return to their own altars to supplement and recite the scriptures again. Whether in the recitation of scriptures, or in the building of temples and shrines, or in the making of divine images and ritual implements, all ought to be done with utmost care and diligence, according to law and rite, without neglect or slighting. The Way of the spirits is clear and manifest; it cannot but be believed.
