# The Hermit Daoist: Devoutly Observing the Fasting Ritual to Attain the Immortal Way

Li Dade, a Daoist Master, is a hermit Daoist of the countryside in Jiangxi. He makes the observance of ritual his business, and from his youth followed his Master abroad to conduct the Daoist rites. Cutting paper, writing couplets, divining the earth, choosing the proper days, beating gongs and drums — he is skilful in all these matters.

The Daoist rites in the countryside are all performed at the houses of the fasting hosts; the altars are commonly of a simple and rude kind. But Master Li dares not neglect them; he has several genuine silk ritual robes, a penitential tablet of boxwood, an ivory morning tablet, and portraits of the Immortals — all left by the Patriarchs. When persons have offered high prices for these, Master Li has refused them. According to the line of succession recorded in his ritual manuals, Master Li’s branch descends from the Perfected One Zhao Yuanyang of the Song and Yuan dynasties. Although in the course of transmission errors have crept in, the rites still preserve the style of the Song and Yuan.

Once, Master Li was invited to the Deng ancestral hall at Shenzhen to perform a ritual of deliverance. At more than nine o’clock at night, the ritual was still proceeding. Suddenly there was heard outside a hooting sound, drawing near and near. The Deng family folk, frightened, all withdrew. Only Master Li, with several disciples, remained to continue the feeding of the spirits. After the feeding was over, the sound gradually departed. I asked Master Li if he was afraid. Master Li said, “To be sure, there is some fear. But as Daoist Masters we must not show it. If we lose our measure, then we have no prestige at all.”

Master Li said, “When we perform the ritual, we proceed according to the proper ritual. What the Master teaches, that we do. We who live as hermits among the people say, ‘Taking men’s money, we relieve their calamities.’ We may not cut corners, nor perform incomplete rites, nor deceive the fasting hosts. When we perform the ritual, we must not look this way and that, nor let our thoughts wander. The scriptures say: ‘Submit the body, submit the spirit, submit the life.’ Even life must be submitted; the spirit must not stray abroad; with a single thought of earnest sincerity, and breath undisturbed, only thus will the ritual be efficacious.”

Master Li said that his family has had thirteen generations of Daoists. Of the earlier ones he knew not, but his father and grandfather both lived long lives. His grandfather lived to more than eighty years; when he was about to depart, he washed his head beforehand, put on his clothes, and then ascended to the immortals. His father likewise died without illness, passing away at noon.

The Iron-Crowned Daoist said: “Hermit Daoists mostly know not the method of inner cultivation, but only make the performance of rites their business. They regard the conduct of ritual as an art. But the strictness of their lineage preserves many of the ancient rules. I have seen many hermits of Jiangsu and Shanghai, who having performed rites all their lives, at eighty or ninety years can still ascend the altar, with voices strong and steps vigorous, not inferior to the young. Hence it is known, those who perform rites, if they strictly observe the lineage and the rules of the altar, this is in fact a kind of cultivation, and is able to produce real benefit.”

Now there is current a saying: “Reciting scriptures and bowing in repentance are the actors of the Patriarchs; sitting in meditation and refining the elixir are the disciples of the Patriarchs.” This separates ritual from cultivation as two distinct things. But this is not correct. The ritual originally was called the fasting method. Fasting means to bring into accord. The world’s thoughts are confused and discordant; by observing the fasting ritual one brings into accord what is discordant, and thus attains the state of non-action. When the mind is clear and conduct pure, then one can comprehend the heavenly Dao. If one cannot do these two things, but only adorns the outward solemnity, this is but child’s play, insufficient to move the spirits and enlighten the immortals.

The Patriarch Bai Yuchan said: “The sages of old found the study of the Dao hard to enter; the world’s desires easily mislead. They established ritual and precepts as standards of conduct to unify the outward. They set down methods of meditation and concentration to rectify the heart. They further prescribed ways of refining the vital breath and the embryo of life, to regulate diet and flavour; and used the offerings of prayer and morning and evening acknowledgments to cleanse faults and guilt. Then those who have no learning in the Dao attain to darkness and silence, dwelling in the realm of ‘lessen and lessen again.’ They enter into non-action, so that the gates of evil wiles are not opened, and the calm sweetness of tranquillity can be attained.” The study of the Dao is a matter of non-action, but non-action is difficult for ordinary men to achieve. Therefore they begin with action. In performing the ritual, through solemnity and reverence one preserves thought, to discipline body and mind, concentrating the spirit. By long continuance, the sweetness of tranquillity may be attained, and the immortal way may be hoped for!
