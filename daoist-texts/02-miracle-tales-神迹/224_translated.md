# The Matter of Master Zhang of Qionglong Mountain Performing Transcendence

On Qionglong Mountain stands the True Temple, the very place where the Patriarch Shi Dao Yuan first founded the sect, transmitting the Thunder Methods of the Divine Firmament. There dwell there recluses and men of distinction, adepts skilled in the arts of magic and ritual. In the years of the reign of Emperor Guangxu, there was in Suzhou a gentleman of rank named Hu Jiayou, who came to the guest-hall of the True Temple, and said to the steward, "Last night my mother appeared in a dream, entrusting me to come here and seek out a certain Daoist, Master Zhang, who sweeps the floors, to perform transcendence for her."

At that time there were many Daoists in the True Temple, and the steward wondered greatly why he did not seek out a Master of high accomplishment, but desired to find one who swept the floors. He said, "There are many Daoists here in the True Temple, but only a few who can perform the sacred rites and carry out transcendence. There is indeed a Daoist surnamed Zhang, but he cannot recite the scriptures. Would you not better summon one of our Masters of high accomplishment?" The gentleman Hu said, "My honoured parent specially named the Master whom she wished to have. He should not err in this. Steward, can you lead me to see Master Zhang?"

So the steward took the gentleman Hu to the mountain gate, and pointed to a Daoist, saying, "There, that Master who sweeps the steps is Master Zhang." They saw a Daoist, some forty years of age, of unremarkable countenance, bending his head as he swept the ground. The gentleman Hu advanced and saluted, explaining his errand. Master Zhang said, "I am but a poor Daoist, and I cannot recite the scriptures." The gentleman Hu said, "I see in you a presence most uncommon, doubtless well practised in cultivation. My honoured mother’s request surely has its reason. Pray do not refuse."

The gentleman Hu brought Master Zhang and a band of scripture readers and musicians to his home, arranging the altar and preparing to perform the Doumu Refining rite. Master Zhang donned his ritual robes, but he neither performed the method of stepping the Big Dipper, nor did he summon the gods and generals. The gentleman Hu’s heart was already somewhat displeased. Soon upon the altar, Master Zhang fell asleep. The gentleman Hu grew very unhappy, and went to awaken him, saying, "Master, Master, I have reverently invited you to perform transcendence for my mother, and yet you sleep upon the altar? I must pay you and send you away." Master Zhang took no offence, and departed.

That very night the gentleman Hu dreamed that his mother said to him, "Son, just now Master Zhang had reached the gates of the netherworld, and how is it that you called him back?" The gentleman Hu then understood that the Daoist’s sleeping was a trance in which he had gone forth to the netherworld to escort her, and he was greatly regretful. The next day he ascended Qionglong Mountain to make amends, offering a large sum to invite Master Zhang once more to perform the transcendence.

This time Master Zhang again fell asleep; the gentleman Hu resolved to let him sleep his fill. When the scripture readers finished their chanting, Master Zhang awoke and said, "Gentleman, you are fortunate. Your honoured mother has already been released from the sufferings of hell. She also entrusted me to tell you this: the debt of thirteen taels of silver owed by Li Dan’er of Li Family Village may be forgiven."

The gentleman was much amazed, and asked, "Master, you cannot recite scriptures nor perform rites; how then could you enter the netherworld and see my mother?" Master Zhang said, "In my earlier years I cultivated the Inner Elixir. When the Elixir is complete, the Yang Spirit can go forth. When virtue is perfected, one may ascend to the Golden Palace. The netherworld is the place of the Yin Tribunal. A Daoist well practised in the Way is recorded in the Jade Tablet, and wearing talismans is protected by officers and soldiers; even the lesser spirits dare not detain him. The netherworld and realms of darkness are naturally open and unobstructed to him." Master Zhang’s Taoist name was Zhang Siben, and he passed away in the nineteenth year of the Republic.
