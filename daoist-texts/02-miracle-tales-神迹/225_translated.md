# The Story of Daoist Master Sun Xuanli of Mount Wudang

Sun Xuanli was a native of Zhouzhi County in Shaanxi. In the decade of the eighties, he took vows as a monk at the tower temple of Zhouzhi County; thereafter, having been enlightened in a dream by a divine person, he withdrew to seclusion and cultivation on Mount Wudang. His life was pure and simple, acting in accordance with non-action and naturalness. Yet the Bureau of Tourism interfered in many ways and sought to drive him away, so that Master Sun was compelled to move further into the depths of Wudang.

One day, a wandering Daoist, while making a pilgrimage to the mountain, chanced upon the thatched hut of Master Sun Xuanli. As the day was already late, the wandering Daoist wished to lodge with Master Sun. Sun said, “That is permitted.” He asked no further questions.

He then went to prepare the evening meal for this wandering Daoist. What was brought forth was a bowl of noodles, to which Master Sun said, “Dao-fellow, you have laboured climbing the mountain; eat a bowl of noodles.” The wandering Daoist expressed deep gratitude. Suddenly, a cockroach crawled upon the table, and the Daoist’s countenance showed signs of disgust. Master Sun scolded the cockroach, saying, “Go, go outside.” The cockroach forthwith leapt away.

The wandering Daoist said, “I have learned the art of incantation waters, and can thereby drive off such cockroaches, snakes, and insects; they dare not come again. I am grateful for your hospitality, and would repay it thus.” Master Sun replied, “This mountain is not mine alone; Heaven and Earth are not mine alone. They belong equally to all things. Why should I monopolize this place and admit no other creeping creatures? I am not the Bureau of Tourism.”

The wandering Daoist said, “This place is damp and the miasma heavy; if you dwell here long, you may fall ill. It would be better to move to the Purple Cloud Palace.” Master Sun said, “Though this place be damp, yet there is not so much worldly quarrel and strife here; I can thus do my own affairs. Not to be restrained by others, what is there that is not well? The hour grows late; rest early.”

So Master Sun gave his own bed to the wandering Daoist, and himself lay upon a bamboo bed. Suddenly, at night, he heard the sound of drums shaking the air, and long blasts of the painted horn. Rising he went outside, and saw a person clad in golden armour, wielding an axe and halberd, standing upon the clouds. Immortal officials and soldiers thronged before and behind. That general was the same as the Daoist who had asked lodging that evening. Master Sun quickly knelt and kowtowed. The general said, “Sun Xuanli, I am Marshal Liu who patrols the mountains, by command of the Supreme Emperor of the Dark Heaven; I watch over Wudang, and protect those who cultivate here. Should any among you in this mountain create noise and disturbance, and disturb the pure cultivation, they will be severely punished, and no mercy shown. You are pure in heart and study the Way, not coveting honours or wealth. You nourish the simple and cultivate truth, showing compassion to all beings. I have already reported you to the Supreme Emperor; you shall be enrolled among the ranks of the immortals. Be diligent, be diligent.” Having spoken, he vanished suddenly. Master Sun bowed his head and gave thanks.

Another twenty or thirty years passed, and a certain Daoist at the Jade Spring Temple on Mount Hua saw Master Sun again; his appearance was unchanged from the eighties, yet his complexion was even better. When asked of the secret of longevity, Master Sun said, “The Way of long life lies nothing beyond nurturing the spirit within, and accumulating meritorious deeds without. Guard the spirit to preserve the body; treasure the essence and cherish the vital breath. If one can turn inward and contemplate with perfect emptiness, quietude, and sincerity, with breath flowing uninterrupted, then the true spirit will gather. When spirit and breath are blended, the Way is naturally accomplished.” Master Sun stayed one or two days at the Jade Spring Temple, then departed. It is said he was also seen at the Taiqing Palace on Mount Laoshan, and at the Xuandu Temple of the Southern Peak, appearing and disappearing mysteriously, dwelling freely. Presumably he attained the Way of the terrestrial immortals, wandering the Five Great Mountains, awaiting the hour of ascension.
