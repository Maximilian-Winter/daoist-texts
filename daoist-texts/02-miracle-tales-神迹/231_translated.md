# The Scripture of Three Lifetimes' Resolution of Grievances

Liu Manwen of Guangdong recited the Scripture of Three Lifetimes' Resolution of Grievances.

Liu Manwen was a native of Shunde in Guangdong. In her early years, her parents were divorced, and she attended a local vocational high school. During her studies, she entered into a love affair with a classmate, and thereafter became pregnant. Overcome with alarm and distress, she consulted with her boyfriend, and thus underwent a painless abortion. Her heart was filled with remorse, and her close friends comforted her with kind words. The following year, Liu Manwen conceived again; due to her still weak financial foundation, she had no recourse but to undergo another abortion.

After graduation, Liu Manwen parted with her boyfriend and entered employment. She often felt languid in spirit, and her emotions were unstable. Having worked for several years, her fortune in wealth was poor; her monthly income was insufficient for her expenditures, leaving her in straitened circumstances. Later, Liu Manwen journeyed with friends to Longhu Mountain. Seeing the solemnity of the Daoist sanctuary, as if returning to a familiar place, she felt the thought of taking refuge arise. Thus at the Mansion of the Heavenly Master she took refuge in the supreme Dao. Following the instructions of the Daoist priest, she devoutly recited scriptures, reverently served the exalted perfected ones, and repented of her sins. Her mood and fortune gradually improved.

Subsequently, she found several boyfriends, and when preparing for marriage, inexplicable quarrels arose, causing separation. Liu Manwen was greatly distressed. She therefore engaged a Daoist priest to inquire as to the cause. This Daoist priest was skilled in the art of Ren Dun and the Six Jia, and after reckoning with his fingers, he told her, "Two children follow you about, their moods inconstant, crying incessantly. Have you in times past undergone abortion?" Liu Manwen then recounted her former experiences.

The Daoist priest said, "The great virtue of Heaven and Earth is life. Among the sins of the world, the karma of killing is the heaviest. You have wounded the lives of two unborn children; their infant spirits bear grievances and refuse to reincarnate. The Underworld records this in the Black Register, and your fortune is ill. Thanks to your worship in these years of the Three Treasures and your repentance of sins, you have been removed from the Black Register. Yet the grievances still follow you, with no place to be resolved. The infant spirits, because of their resentment, cannot reincarnate as men, nor have incense-paper offerings to venerate them. They can only remain beside their birth parents, wandering as lost souls. Pitiable! Alas, alas!"

Hearing this, Liu Manwen could not but weep bitterly, and earnestly entreated the Daoist priest, beseeching his great compassion to show her the gate of deliverance. The Daoist priest said, "In former days the Lord who Saves from Suffering proclaimed the single scroll of the Supreme Scripture of Three Lifetimes' Resolution of Grievances, explaining the supreme method of resolving grudges and performing transcendence for infant spirits. When you return, daily recite this scripture three times, and the grudges of your foes will naturally be dispelled. You must know that sin is born of the heart, and similarly it is extinguished by the heart."

Liu Manwen, hearing this, bowed and thanked the Daoist priest and withdrew respectfully. Each day she lit lamps and recited the scripture. After forty-nine days, she dreamed of a child, with twin topknots holding a banner inscribed with the words "The Supreme Lord Taiyi who Saves from Suffering." Two infants of wondrous appearance came to pay their respects and take leave. The infants said, "Because of the calamity of your killing and wounding, our hearts were full of resentment. Now we rely upon the grace of the Great Dao and the vast merit of your recitations. The grievances have been resolved, and spirits and men are separated. From now on, we shall reincarnate; we beseech our mother to take good care of herself." Having spoken, they followed the splendid banner and gradually departed. Liu Manwen awoke, deeply pained.

The Scripture of the Supreme Three Lifetimes' Resolution of Grievances says: "This scripture does not merely resolve the grudges of one person. If all of you bring forth sincere hearts and recite the scripture a hundred times, the grudges of all the people in a country will be entirely delivered." This scripture is of great merit; not only can it resolve the grudges of one person, but it can also dissolve the grudges of all the people of the world. One who can hold and recite this scripture will see the grudges and sins of three lifetimes extinguished; and if one can copy a copy for others, then the entire family and relatives will partake of the blessings of wisdom and merit. If one can finance the printing of this scripture and circulate it throughout the world, so that the four debts and three pardons may all receive the shelter of the Dao, its merit and power cannot be estimated.

Each of us, from the time of our birth, whether intentionally or unintentionally, will commit various errors. It is inevitable to form grudges. Although these may not be equal to abortion or killing, those injured will still bear resentment in their hearts. Such karma accompanies many lifetimes, hence there is the cycle of retribution and sinking. Therefore, we ought diligently to seek repentance, widely make good connections, and avoid forming grudges.

The Lord says:

> Multitudes of beings form grudges,  
> Grudges deep, hard to untie;  
> One day grudges are formed,  
> Three lifetimes' retribution does not cease.  
> I now transmit the wondrous scripture,  
> To dissolve all grudges and sins.  
> Hear and recite with earnest heart,  
> Enemies will vanish of themselves.

I take refuge in the Azure Profound Nine-Yang Emperor, the Supreme Lord Taiyi who Saves from Suffering!
