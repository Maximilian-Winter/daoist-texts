# The Gentry and the Temple Sacristan Conspire in Deceit, Encountering the Manifestation of Lord Guan

The Patriarch Bai Yuchan said: "The Master of the Han, the Celestial Master, has said: 'Those of the present who study the methods of the Way do not root themselves in the Dao, nor do they trace back to the heart. Men make themselves their own masters, families their own schools; they take the opening of light and attachment of spirits as marvels, and regard shadows and traces in dreams as wonders. The officials they summon number by the thousands, and the offices they fill with their methods are called true persons, envoys, and ministers. Some mingle the arts of shamans and sorcerers with orthodox teachings; some use the brush of ghosts and immortals and claim it to be secret transmission. When questioned, they answer according to their ritual; when separated, they insist it is genuine instruction. Alas! The evil masters err beyond measure; it is not the fault of the multitudes. One blind man leads many, and by transmitting perplexity, they are more perplexed. How pitiful!'"

The Patriarch Zhang Sanfeng of Wudang said: "Planchette is a borrowed art; from ancient times, all true men have repudiated it as the conduct of magicians. The Immortal teachers keep aloof from it; how much more so when it is profaned? Men follow the planchette and play with it, using talismans and spells in vain; they thereby invite ghosts into their homes! This is how the artful deceive the ignorant, and why the Immortals abhor the magicians. In my life I have disliked men seeking divination by drawing lots, consulting oracles, or requesting planchette writing. I only wish that every man would cultivate virtue, and continually examine himself. I have heard of those who set up planchette to divine geomancy, or to solicit the heavenly heart; these are but the vestiges of the magician’s art. The gods of the upper realm observe their deceitfulness, and none have escaped heavenly punishment!'"

There was a village that annually held sacrifices at the Temple of Lord Guan, slaughtering living creatures and causing death, consuming the villagers' flesh and blood, thereby making a poor village yet poorer. Some even perished from hunger! In that year, before the Temple of Lord Guan, they erected a stage to perform grand operas. Naturally, the plays were all of Lord Guan. While the drama was in progress, suddenly a villager leapt several metres upon the stage, seized Lord Guan’s great blade, and began to wield it, his movements full of tiger-like vigour, as if a whirlwind.

After a short time of dancing, he leaned upon the blade, closed his eyes slightly, and wore a face of wrath. With a loud shout he proclaimed: "I am the Demon-Subduing Guan Yu! You common folk, deceived and coerced by the gentry and the sacrificial animals of the temple, waste your substance to prop the four walls in worship. I know of these things and now appear in person. The gentry have threatened, and the temple sacristan has colluded, greedy for money, consuming the people's fat and blood. Within five days they shall perish. You must keep good thoughts in your hearts, reverence the Great Way, and your blessings and virtues will be boundless. Such sacrifice is needless. I have become a god by loyalty and righteousness; you yourselves ought to be loyal, filial, benevolent, and righteous — that is the true great offering. I depart now!!!"

Having spoken, he fell down. Before long the villager revived. When questioned, he said: "I saw suddenly on the stage the great Lord Guan, his face red as a jujube, wielding his great blade. Then my body was beyond my control, and I could see Lord Guan Emperor always beside me; yet my speech and movements were not subject to me."

Thereafter, the man became the temple sacristan, but Lord Guan Emperor never appeared again. Yet the people continued their offerings without ceasing. As for the gentry and the former temple sacristan, they both died suddenly within seven days; others were bitten by venomous snakes and died without cure.
