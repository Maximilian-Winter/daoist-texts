# One Life Selling Rice, Darkly Accumulating Hidden Merits, the Corpse Transformed, Becoming an Immortal

In the region of Jiangyin, Guangling, there was a man named Li Jue, who for generations dwelt within the city, and made his livelihood by vending rice. Yet Li Jue was upright and simple in character, differing from ordinary men. At the age of fifteen, he followed his father in selling rice; when his father went abroad on business, he entrusted Li Jue with the management of the trade. When any came to purchase rice, Li Jue would take out a measure of one sheng or one dou, and let them measure it themselves; regardless of whether the price of rice was high or low, he gained only two wen as profit per dou, thereby supporting his parents. Thus, through the years, he accumulated wealth, and yet his family estate was quite ample.

His father was puzzled, and asked the reason; Li Jue related the true state of his dealings. The father sighed, saying: ‘Among our fellows in trade, none fail to use two sets of measures—one for selling out, one for taking in. The measure used for selling out is light, but that for taking in is heavy; by this means they thicken their profits. Though the officials inspect the measures twice yearly, in spring and autumn, yet they cannot forbid such cheating. I long ago felt that this was not right, and therefore possessed only one set of measures, using it alike for selling out and taking in. Over time, I have believed that this is neither partial nor unjust. Now you even let the buyers measure the rice themselves; my conduct cannot compare with yours. Yet your wealth remains ample; is this not the aid of the Spirits?’ After his parents passed away, Li Jue lived beyond eighty years, still following his old trade.

Now there was a magistrate also named Li Jue, who, having been appointed beyond his rank, served as the Military Governor of Huainan. The rice-seller Li Jue, because he shared the same name with the governor, changed his name to Li Kuan. A few months after Military Governor Li Jue took office, he bestowed alms on the Taoist community and held a fasting assembly. On the second night, he dreamed that he entered a grotto palace. There the scene was one of spring, with flowers in full bloom, phoenixes and luan birds flying, white cranes dancing; the heavens were adorned with coloured clouds and auspicious mists, and on the earth the pavilions and towers were linked in one continuous expanse. Li Jue strolled alone within the cave, and saw the stone walls polished bright and glossy, upon which were inlaid large characters of gold, listing many names, among which was “Li Jue,” the characters more than two feet in length. Seeing this, Li Jue was overjoyed, thinking to himself: ‘Born in an age of political clearness, having undergone many years and held illustrious office, even reaching the rank of prime minister, have I not thereby been a benefactor to all under Heaven? Now my name is inscribed in the grotto; surely I have become an immortal.’ The more he thought, the more joyful he became.

Just as he was in his delight, two immortals in youthful form ran out from the sides of the stone wall. Li Jue hastily asked, ‘Where is this place?’ The youths answered, ‘This is the Huayang Grotto Heaven. But the names on the stone wall are not those of the military governor.’ Hearing this, Li Jue was startled, and inquired, ‘If it is not I, this Li Jue, then where is he from?’ The youths replied, ‘He is a resident of Jiangyin under the jurisdiction of the military governor.’

When Li Jue awoke in the morning, the matter of the dream was still clear in his mind, and he pondered its strangeness with increasing wonder. He inquired of Taoists, but none knew of the Li Jue in that locality; he then summoned officials of Jiangyin to ask, but none recognized the name. Thereupon he ordered a search throughout the city and its outskirts for one having the same name as himself. After several days of uproar, and inquiry among the town’s inhabitants, it was at last discovered that Li Kuan was originally called Li Jue. A carriage was dispatched to bring Li Kuan into the government seat, where he was lodged in a pure chamber; the governor bathed and purified himself, and saluted Kuan as ‘Brother of the Way.’ The whole household reverently served Li Kuan, performing the rites of homage at appointed times morning and evening.

Li Kuan was by nature tranquil, with a very venerable appearance; his beard was over a foot long, purely white and lovely. It was said that at sixty years of age, a Taoist had taught him the art of embryonic breathing, and for a long time he no longer ate the five grains. Li Jue honoured him the more. After more than a month passed, he inquired, ‘Brother of the Way, what Taoist arts have you attained, what elixir of immortality do you take? I once dreamed of entering a grotto palace, and saw upon the stone wall your name carved; guided by the immortal youths, I sought you out, and have brought you to the government seat to be my master. I hope you will impart to me the art of immortality.’ Li Kuan hastened to decline, saying he truly knew nothing of immortality or elixir-making. Li Jue reverently kowtowed again and asked: ‘Then what do you cultivate?’

Kuan told him plainly: ‘The ignorant do not know what to cultivate; I merely live by vending rice,’ and related the truth of his life. After repeated questioning, Li Jue sighed, saying: ‘Your conduct is indeed hard for ordinary men to accomplish; the secret merit you have accumulated is one that others cannot attain. Therefore those who attain wealth and rank in the world often fall into harm; those in poverty, if they sincerely help the people, shall have their names inscribed among immortals. You admonish the mundane world by your own behaviour!’

Later Li Kuan lived beyond a hundred years, his movements light and his health extraordinary. One day he suddenly told his descendants: ‘I have dwelt in the world many years; though I nourish my breath and do not eat, I have not benefited you.’ That night he died. After the great mourning of three days, the coffin suddenly split open. On looking, they saw his clothing and sash yet tied, but the body was gone, as if a cicada had shed its shell; in truth he had transformed his corpse and ascended to immortality.
