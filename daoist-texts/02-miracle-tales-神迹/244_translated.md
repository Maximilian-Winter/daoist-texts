# The Departed Grandfather's Love for His Posterity

Last year, before the New Year, an event was personally experienced. In the backyard of my home, upon the flower terrace leaning against the wall, there stood a small-leaved tree as thick as a bowl's mouth; its shade spread wide, a dim and indistinct expanse. On an ordinary day, my father went to the backyard to play with the dog; from the corner of his eye he perceived something moving upon the eaves behind the tree’s shade. Looking steadfastly, he saw a snake as thick as a muscular man's arm. According to reason, in this neighborhood, save for lost pet snakes, none could be so thick; nor did its pattern resemble the usual Burmese python or the golden python, the common pet snakes.

Indeed, my father was frightened; he sought a wooden stick to push the snake from the eaves. But the snake was as firm as a rock, and seemed even to intend to crawl down along the fragile branches of the small-leaved tree. This truly terrified my father; hastily he pulled out the garden hose, increased the pressure, and vigorously sprayed the snake. The snake was likewise tenacious; it fell but then climbed up again. Yet water fees, in my father’s eyes, had become life-saving wealth; after a long time spraying, the snake finally crawled away along the eaves.

Then a strange occurrence took place. From that day forth, my father could neither sleep at night nor rest by day. His body was sound in all respects, but the dark circles under his eyes deepened, and his temper grew irritable. At first, fearing to alarm us, he did not speak of it; afterwards, finding us not afraid but greatly interested, he said that before this, the same snake had appeared upon the small path to the left of the backyard. It lay curled and motionless; seeing my father, it showed no sign of fear, but instead crawled towards him. My father hurriedly called the dog, who fled into the house; only after discovering the snake gone did he go to the backyard.

At this moment, I suddenly recalled that last year at the Clear Brightness festival, my father had not gone to pay respects to grandfather. I therefore suggested to him, "During the New Year, let us go and see grandfather; perchance, having seen him, you will find rest."

Curiously, they indeed went to pay respects. Normally, it took but fifteen minutes to find the place. That day they sought for two hours—from two in the afternoon until nearly five—but could not find it, saying the grass grew higher than men, and no path could be found. Returning, they were scolded by grandmother, saying, "Year after year you go; if you have the ability, why cannot you find it? If you cannot find it, then come back. Lingering so long frightens people."

I laughed at my father, saying, "That snake must have been grandfather longing for us and coming to look upon us. You treat him without good food or drink, you do not burn paper offerings, and you sprayed him with the water hose for half an hour. Grandfather was angered, and does not wish to attend to you." My father only smiled at this; yet after returning from the mountain, his insomnia ceased.

That year at the Clear Brightness festival, my uncle and I went to see grandfather; in fifteen minutes we arrived. We worshipped for a long time, speaking many words to grandfather, saying, "Father has not had much contact with these matters; do not blame him. He still greatly misses you. Last time, not finding you, he returned discouraged for a long while," and so forth. The next day after returning, my father's gout was much relieved; by the third day, it was almost cured.

Perhaps thus it is, that connection does not perish, nor does love ever vanish.
