# The Story of the Child Dwelling in a Hamlet Built upon a Graveyard

I also desire to relate a matter which befell me in my childhood. When I was in the fourth year of my schooling, my family removed from a distant place to a hamlet newly built by a manufactory. The hamlet was but lately completed, consisting entirely of single-storied houses with small courtyards attached, set apart for the reception of new comers from afar who came to serve in the factory. The hamlet was not large: five rows of such houses, each row containing five households. Our family dwelt in the first row, the second household from the east. The small courtyard opened on both sides of the door, with two side chambers. The elders assigned one side chamber as my chamber, the other as the kitchen.

I remember when we first moved thither it was the season between spring and summer. At eventide, when the sky became dim, I sat in my chamber writing my tasks, when I heard my mother calling me from the kitchen. I answered once, but there was no further sound. I ran to ask my mother, saying, "You called me." She replied, "I did not." This happened for several days in succession; then my mother said to me, "In future, if you hear another calling you, do not answer."

After a few days more, on a night when a mighty rain came pouring down with thunder rolling and lightning cleaving the sky, I trembled with fear in my chamber, afraid to sleep. Suddenly, I distinctly heard a floating female voice calling my familiar name. It came from the courtyard of the household to the east, drifting towards our courtyard. The voice called three times in all: at the first call it was in the eastern courtyard; at the second it reached our courtyard; at the third, I felt it at my door. Terrified, I immediately struck a light. That whole night I kept the lamp burning.

The next day I related this to my father and mother, who said I had been deluded â€” such is the way of adults.

Yet a few days later, having some business, I climbed upon the roof of the single-storied house, and looking eastward, I saw a multitude of grave mounds thickly clustered. Before our home, outside the enclosing wall, was also a row of such mounds. It appeared that the hamlet was built upon a graveyard.

That night, when the elders were all asleep, I bowed my head in my chamber to the four quarters, saying, "We are new comers; do not harm me. Henceforth, let us be good neighbours." Now, reflecting, never was I taught thus, yet so I acted. Afterwards, indeed, no trouble came upon us.
