# The Legendary Stealing-Child Old Woman

Many know of the Goddess Who Brings Children; do you also know of the Stealing-Child Old Woman? I will tell a story from my childhood.

I was born on the twenty-ninth day of the twelfth lunar month, the day before the New Year's Eve; my mother said that winter was especially cold.

A few days later, my mother saw an old woman enter the chamber, saying she wished to take me up and look at me. It was during the New Year festival, and my mother did not know the old woman; she thought she was a relative of my fatherâ€™s family, and so she said, "The weather is cold, the child is asleep; wait a while, when he wakes you may look." But the old woman insisted on seeing me. Perhaps my mother had some presentiment, and so did not consent. The old woman failed in her wish, and as she departed, she spoke fiercely to my mother: "In a few days I shall come again."

My mother paid no heed; yet from that day forth, I began to sleep by day and cry by night. The whole family took turns to hold and soothe me.

A week later, the old woman came again; without a word she leapt upon the bed where I lay sleeping. My mother said she felt a pair of icy hands reach under the quilt, and suddenly I was lifted down from the bed. My mother sprang forward, threw herself upon the old woman, and wrested me away, while loudly calling for my grandmother. The old woman was powerless and had to let me go; she turned and departed.

My mother told my grandmother what had happened; my grandmother cursed the old woman vehemently in the chamber, then hung a piece of peach wood upon the door. Thereafter, the old woman came no more.

Though the old woman did not steal me away, my body was frail since childhood, like Lin Daiyu; day after day I took medicine, thin as skin and bones. The doctor, when giving injections, had to pinch my skin to make the needle enter.

My mother said that at one time the doctor said I might not survive, and asked the family to give up treatment; but afterwards, I slowly recovered. That I live is a miracle.

Therefore, I am deeply grateful, grateful to my parents, grateful for all that I have!
