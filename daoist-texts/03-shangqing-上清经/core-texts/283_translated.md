### Scripture of the Opening of Heaven’s Three Diagrams and the Seven Stars’ Passing through the Heavenly Gates of Supreme Clarity of Perfect Truth — Scroll One

**The Method of Passing from Death to Life for Preserving Immortality at the Upper Law**

The Heavenly Gate is the Gate of Birth of the Nine Heavens; it is governed in the southeast corner of the Nine Heavens. It is also called the Heavenly Diagram, and the Heavenly Gate, thus known as the Three Gates. It is the passage of the multitudes of the Perfect Ones, the experience of the spirits and immortals, and the path of the learners. It lies five thousand li from the Golden Palace, seven thousand li from the Jade Clarity Upper Palace. To open the Three Gates is to ascend to the Golden Palace and to roam and feast in the Jade Clarity.

The First Heavenly Gate has above it nine layers of jade terraces, the terraces being one thousand two hundred zhang above the earth. Beneath are thousands of long serpents; flying dragons and venomous beasts stand guard at the jade gate. There are three thousand mighty men, all equipped with golden armour and brandishing their weapons at the gate’s ends. The Supreme Void Jade Morning Monitor, styled Xu Shangming, dwells upon the jade terrace. Flying clouds and drifting rosy mists surround its chamber; sun and moon illumine mysteriously, the light piercing the Jade Clarity. Three hundred attendant true immortals wait upon him, who is the lord of the upper immortal’s comings and goings, and the one by whom the gate is opened.

The Second Heavenly Gate has above it six layers of jade terraces, rising nine hundred zhang. Beneath are thousands of long serpents; flying dragons and venomous beasts guard the jade gate. Three thousand mighty men stand ready, all equipped with golden armour, stationed at the gate’s ends. The Supreme Monitor of True Jade, styled Lang Bo, guards the jade terrace. Red clouds and purple canopies envelop his chamber, mysterious light of sun and moon shining between. Three hundred attendant true immortals serve him, the lord supervising the passage of the multitudes of the Perfect Ones in their feasting and roaming.

The Third Heavenly Gate has above it three layers of jade terraces, six hundred zhang high. Beneath are thousands of long serpents; flying dragons and venomous beasts guard the jade gate. Three thousand mighty men stand ready, all equipped with golden armour, stationed at the gate’s flanks. The Supreme Emperor’s Monitor of True Jade, styled Tian Changsheng, guards the jade terrace. Mysterious clouds cover its upper region, vapours perfume its court. Its light shines forth clearly, its form splendid. Three hundred attendant true immortals serve him. The lord presides over the multitudes of the upper heavens and the beings below, and the registers and records are kept under his charge.

Whoever receives the Way of Casting the Golden Tablets and Jade Names must practise the method of opening the Heavenly Gates. Always, morning and evening, enter the chamber to burn incense, knock the teeth twelve times in communication, face east and reverently bow in the four directions. Maintain the thought of seeing the ends of the Nine Heavens, beneath the Three Gates, seeing the forms clearly and distinctly. When all is done, next maintain the thought of the seven stars above in heaven, moving in their courses; my body is upon the star of the Heavenly Gates; the seven stars move my body, until beneath the jade terrace of the Heavenly Gate, where I cast one jade tally, reporting to the Supreme Void Jade Morning Monitor who communicates with me. I see the Jade Morning Monitor marking the tally on the jade plaque, communicating my body beneath the Heavenly Gate. Next I maintain my body again upon the seven stars; the seven stars move me beneath the jade terrace of the Heavenly Gate, there casting another jade tally, reporting to the Supreme Emperor’s Monitor of True Jade who communicates with me; I see him mark the tally on the jade plaque, communicating my body beneath the Heavenly Gate. Next I maintain myself upon the seven stars again; the seven stars move me beneath the jade terrace of the Heavenly Gate, where I cast a third jade tally, reporting to the Supreme Emperor’s Monitor of True Jade who communicates with me; I see him mark the tally on the jade plaque, communicating my body beneath the Golden Palace and the Jade Clarity Palace. Next I lose the seven stars and my body is upon the Void and Mysterious above, in the midst of darkness and mist, with nothing to lean on or see. Suddenly, I find myself upon the Golden Palace Jade Capital Golden Gate, where I cast a golden tally; I see the Four Extremes Perfected Ones receive the tally upon a jade table and bring it to the Golden Palace Sovereign. The Four Extremes Perfected Ones report, and together with me ascend to the Jade Clarity above. Next I maintain myself above Jade Clarity, the Four Extremes vast and boundless, only seeing the dense azure vitality, no heaven above, no earth below, only the golden gates in the centre reaching in four directions. Within are jade officials and jade trees, golden branches growing on both sides, mighty dragons and running beasts sport upon their summits. I maintain myself roaming therein for a long time, then feel as in sleep returning to the sleeping form; my body feels vague and uncertain, as if treading on empty space. I maintain my roaming complete, then knock my teeth sixteen times in communication, and facing heaven recite the incantation:

“Threefold splendour, precious radiance, jade capital illumines, mysterious brilliance spreads abroad, monitoring without form, golden tablets record the words, recording the jade name, clearly seeing the Nine Heavens, playing above the Three Pure Ones, the Heavenly Gates Three Diagrams, returning to ascend the Purple Court, receiving the title at the Golden Palace, East Splendour records life, granted to ride the Eight Scenes, driving the flying chariot.” Finished, swallow the breath nine times and cease.

All who study and do not know how to open the Heavenly Gates, nor the method of reporting their names upon the tablets, will certainly not succeed. The Three Gates preside over all the heavens and all the earth’s Perfect Ones and flying immortals; and all who begin study of record-keeping must pass through the Three Gates. Any disciple who accumulates learning can cause the Heavenly Gates of the Nine Heavens to have a jade name; the Three Gates’ Jade Morning Monitor reports to the Supreme Emperor’s Palace, whence the Emperor sends twelve jade boys and twelve jade girls to guard the disciple. This is the Supreme Emperor’s highest chapter, to transmit to the Heavenly Emperor, who transmits to the South Pole Supreme Origin Sovereign, who transmits to the Supreme Micro Heavenly Emperor, who transmits to the Golden Palace Emperor; the Golden Palace Emperor entrusts the Prime Minister Blue Youth Sovereign to teach later students who are to become Perfected Ones. According to the Mysterious Code, within seven hundred years it may be heard thrice. The Supreme Origin Sovereign commands ninety Western Flower Jade Maidens to guard the South Pole Purple Chamber.

The Blue Youth Sovereign said: Those who have the corresponding bones and spirit, who see this Way and know the method of casting tallies, will immediately become Perfected Ones. But the method is especially severe and must not be lightly divulged. Students number in the hundreds of millions, but how many meet the truth? Therefore the Central Yellow Elder said: “He who has seen the Great Scripture of Perfect Truth in Thirty-Nine Chapters will rise to heaven in broad daylight.” But there are those who cultivate for many years without success and say the scripture is not true. This is all because the Eastern Splendour has no golden tablets, the Golden Palace no jade tallies; the true spirit will not descend, but the heavenly demons ride instead, causing no result of response, and the scripture of the spirit cannot be attained no matter how many times sought. If first one reports the golden tablets to the Blue Palace, and offers the jade tallies to the Emperor Sovereign, then one will receive the Golden Morning and Jade Boys, Western Flower Jade Maidens, to guard the spiritual writings, universally throughout the heavens and earth, the Three Realms acclaim it good and chant the chapters ten thousand times — how could one fail to receive the response of the jade carriage and purple litter?

**Words of Casting Jade Tallies at the Opening of Heaven’s Three Gates**

At the Heavenly Gate jade terrace before the Supreme Void Jade Morning Monitor, cast several tallies: “From such-and-such county, village, male or female, born Wang Jia, aged so many years, born in such month, styled so-and-so.”

At the Heavenly Diagram jade terrace before the Supreme Monitor of True Jade, cast several tallies: “From such-and-such county, village, male or female, born Wang Jia, aged so many years, born in such month, styled so-and-so.”

At the Heavenly Gate jade terrace before the Supreme Emperor’s Monitor of True Jade, cast several tallies: “From such-and-such county, village, male or female, born Wang Jia, aged so many years, born in such month, styled so-and-so.”

Write three jade tallies thus, each one a foot and six inches long.

**Words of Casting Golden Tally at the Golden Palace**

Before the Golden Palace Emperor Sovereign, cast several tallies: “Lord of such county and village, male or female, born Wang Jia, aged so many years, born in such month, styled so-and-so.”

Write on the golden tally thus, one foot and six inches long.

The Blue Youth Sovereign said: If no golden tablets are had, silverwood may suffice; if no jade tally, the wood of the paulownia may suffice, so long as it be fine and good, the grain unbroken.

The Blue Youth Sovereign said: When opening the Heavenly Gates, Heavenly Diagram, and Heavenly Gate, ascending to the Blue Palace, Golden Palace and Jade Clarity Way, the blue tally and jade tally must, before entering the chamber, be read with twelve tooth-knocks in communication, facing east; after reading the tally, continue with the method of maintaining thought completed; then place the tally secreted in a silk brocade pouch, always burning incense beside it, not lightly exposing it. This is the highest title of the Perfected One, the spirit chapter of the Jade Emperor. If one has a golden name and jade characters inscribed in reverse in the Blue Palace, and sees this Way, one must according to the Great Perfected’s method carry one golden tablet and one jade tally, each one foot two inches long, two inches four fen wide, one golden fish and one jade dragon, one hundred feet of purple silk, thirty feet of blue patterned silk, to serve as the Great Perfected’s oath and be entrusted to the scripture’s master. The master faces south, the receiver faces north, invoking the Northern Emperor as witness, invoking the Seven Ancestors as oath, pledging secrecy. According to the Mysterious Code, within seven hundred years it is passed thrice; if passed to unworthy persons, the Seven Mysteries and Nine Ancestors become eternally servants to ghosts, their bodies perish in the netherworld, and they utterly fail to become immortals. The resolute and mindful seeker of immortality must follow the method and receive and cultivate accordingly.

Such precious texts are always treasured and kept secret by the Supreme Emperor to transmit to the Heavenly Emperor, who transmits to the South Pole Supreme Origin Sovereign, who transmits to the Supreme Micro Heavenly Emperor, who transmits to the Golden Palace Sage Sovereign, who entrusts the Prime Minister Blue Youth Sovereign, to teach those who are to respond and become immortals. Thus within seven hundred years it is issued once; the Supreme Origin Sovereign commands thirty-six Western Flower Jade Maidens to guard the divine writings in the South Pole Purple Chamber.

The Heavenly Emperor said: This text governs the upper writings of the Nine Heavens, the secret writings of the Eight Assemblies, leading all paths, wondrous and unique among jade chapters. Hence the Central Yellow Elder guards thirty-nine secret chapters; the Heavenly Emperor treasures the passing of the seven origins; though the three vehicles each mark their marvels, in practice they are not all equal. The Perfected Ones only know the mystery of flying steps along the celestial thread, maintaining the Five Mornings, swallowing breath and taking in the rosy clouds, chewing the roots of the sun, gathering the mysterious essence of flowing spirit, returning to pure whiteness to extend years; but they do not know the passing of the seven stars, opening and closing the Heavenly Gates, returning the Nine Vitalities for self-observation, preserving the Seven Essences in the mud pellet. Those who attain this Way become intoxicated with the cloud of green litter, and so the Supreme Emperor is honoured with the highest title.

The South Pole Supreme Origin Sovereign said: By wondrously gathering the mysterious light and breathing in the flowing rosy mists, condensing soul and harmonizing spirit, strengthening essence and preserving the spirit, riding the purple pass and measuring the blazing light and flowing golden fire-bells, forming the shining gem and speedily travelling the moon, going at will through ten thousand changes, the Nine Perfect and Eight Paths serve the sun, moon and imperial splendour, jade pendants and gold ornaments preserve the truth of the two scenes. Thus in over three hundred places the mysterious light shines above, feasting in the palace of spirit; yet the seven stars’ passing and the heavenly gate’s link have not been received; nor the riding of the twenty-eight mansions, nor the turning of the sun and moon lights, nor the grasping of the Five Mornings to use in union. Dissolving the union and separation in the sleeping chamber, the purple mist smoke descends from heaven, the Emperor bestows the Golden Morning boys. If one can meditate diligently and accumulate response in the Mysterious Palace, in no more than seven years one may ride the green litter and three white flying carriages, ascend to the imperial morning, and be said to be subtle indeed — the spiritual transformations are boundless.

The Supreme Micro Heavenly Emperor said: The Perfected Ones know only the flying steps and the celestial thread, treading the seven origins, but do not understand the passing of the seven stars opening the heavenly gate, turning the Dipper thread to cover the body, moving the seven degrees to prolong life, separating northeast at the death gate, uniting southwest at the birth gate. Practising fourteen years, one may ascend the mysterious descent jade carriage and flying rosy litter’s carriage, ascend by broad daylight to the morning, and ascend to the Golden Palace.

The Golden Palace Sage Sovereign said: The Way of the Heavenly Gates is easy to open but hard to understand; passing the seven origins is hard to see but easy to perform. Separation and union are the two images, the source of life and death. Man receives breath and has thirteen births; their destiny responds to the end, and returns to thirteen deaths. Therefore the Heavenly Gate is the hinge of union and separation, the seven origins the root of life and death. Those who cultivate nobly, seeking immortality and pondering the truth, yet do not know to close the death breath at the ghost gate, to pass life breath at the human gate, to turn the seven stars northeast, to open the heavenly gate southwest, also do not escape from non-death; to seek the truth is exceedingly hard. If one has the golden name East Splendour and the green characters Supreme Clarity, and sees this Way, then the root of non-death, practising seven years, will be appointed as an immortal of name, riding the green litter flying carriage, with the scarlet child’s body, ascending to the Mysterious Palace.

The Prime Minister Blue Youth Sovereign said: The revolving pivot moves in heaven and earth, the mysterious dipper governs the eight gates, the flowing light shines in the nine heavens, the heavenly power shakes the ten directions, arranging the mysterious images in the heavenly diagram, governing life and death in the seven origins, firmly setting the five separations to suppress death, gathering the six harmonies for self-defense. If one can ride the high Perfected Ones to seek passage, close the death gate at the Heavenly Gate, wear the nine essences to illuminate within, preserve the mysterious dipper with its faint rays, and attain the flying rosy carriage and three white clouds, soaring in the void and riding the empty, ascending to the morning sky.

All who cultivate the Way of the Seven Stars’ Passing must summon the nine lords of the Jade Emperor, the mysterious essence shining within, sever and block the root of death, keep a quiet heart in a secluded chamber, unconnected with dust and wind, standing alone facing the scene, gazing upon the morning sky, burning incense on both sides, scattering mist and rosy mists in the court, concentrating the mind with arduous thought, not sleeping on that day. Practising thus for seven years, one may attain the jade carriage flying canopy and scarlet carriage, which come to welcome the destined body, ascend the Heavenly Gate, block the death path in the northeast, record immortals in the southern immortals. This is the Way hard to seek, the truth easy to descend.

Those who have golden plaques and jade names and attain this Way should do so on the days of Renyin, Bingyin, Jiazi, Jiawu, Xinwei, Xinchou — these are the six meeting days of heaven, times when the high and supreme coincide. The Jade Emperor always on these days commands the attendant jade boys to inspect and register the East Splendour Blue Palace’s golden plaques and jade names for the record of the immortals. On that day, those who diligently aspire and thoroughly penetrate cause the Jade Emperor to respond, who commands the Northern Emperor of Fengdu’s six palaces to sever the root of death records, record the life registers in the human gates, move the seven stars adding to the ghost gates, pass the mysterious pivot, and open the Heavenly Gates.

Whenever one purifies oneself and meditates arduously, eyes closed, maintaining thought within, knocking teeth thirty-six times, thinking of the First Supreme Heavenly Emperor, Mysterious Pivot, Yangming Heavenly Pivot, spirit and soul, the nine high lords, clad in flying cloud brocade skirts, wearing the crown of Mysterious Morning, descending from the mysterious dipper into my body, one chants the incantation:

“Mysterious Pivot, Yangming Heavenly Pivot, spirit and soul, the nine high lords of the upper truth, mixed and transformed, all as one god, I pray that they sever my death path at the ghost gate, pass the life record at the southern pavilion, remove the seven mysteries in the three paths, receive the fetal birth and again be immortal, turn the seven essences to the mysterious shade, pass my form through the Heavenly Gate.” Finished, swallow the breath twenty-seven times.

Practising incessantly, one summons the guests of the Jade Emperor, the Emperor descends with purple rosy clouds, with twelve Western Flower Jade Maidens and twelve Golden Morning Jade Boys attending and guarding the body.

Next one thinks of the Second Origin Star, the Northern Fetal Yin Essence, Mysterious Pivot Spirit and Soul, the nine high lords of jade, clad in yellow brocade flying skirts, crown of Mysterious Morning, descending from the mysterious dipper into my body, swallowing breath with incantation:

“Northern Fetal Yin Essence, Mysterious Pivot Spirit and Soul, the nine high lords of jade, mixed in myriad transformations, all as one god, I pray that they cut off my Yang sins at the Great Yin, pass the Yin breath at the Great Yang, move the seven origins to sever death, open the six harmonies at the Heavenly Gate, extract the seven ancestors from the three paths, again receive fetal birth at the southern pavilion.” Finished, swallow the breath twenty-seven times.

Next one thinks of the Third True Star, Supreme Nine Ultimate Lady, Heavenly Pivot Soul Essence, the nine high lords of upper element, clad in blue brocade flying skirts, crown of Mysterious Morning, descending from the mysterious dipper into my body, swallowing breath with incantation:

“Supreme Nine Ultimate Lady, Heavenly Pivot Soul Essence, the nine high lords of upper element, mixed and transformed, all as one god, I pray that they open and dissolve the roots of the host and guest, sever the source of the death path, make my eyes clear and sharp, oversee boundless, gaze at the mysterious truth, pour essence upon my body, ascend and grasp the imperial chief, fly the seven origins, ride the light and ride the void, lean upon heaven.” Finished, swallow the breath twenty-seven times.

Next one thinks of the Fourth Hinge Star, Mysterious Pivot, Dark Nether, Heavenly Authority, Spirit Essence, the nine high lords of upper emptiness, clad in purple brocade flying skirts, crown of Mysterious Morning, descending from the mysterious dipper into my body, chanting:

“Mysterious Pivot, Dark Nether, Heavenly Authority, Spirit Essence, the nine high lords of upper emptiness, mixed and transformed, all as one god, I pray that they move the seven stars, fill the ghost gates, sever the death breath, open the bright Heavenly Gate, return the northern dipper to the mysterious pivot, pass the life breath to the western earth, separate the northern emperor at Fengdu, record my name in the southern pavilion.” Finished, swallow the breath twenty-seven times.

Next one thinks of the Fifth Thread Star, Heavenly Balance, Scarlet Origin, Jade Balance Soul Platform, the nine high lords of upper mystery, clad in scarlet brocade flying skirts, crown of Mysterious Morning, descending from the mysterious dipper into my body, chanting:

“Heavenly Balance, Scarlet Origin, Jade Balance Soul Spirit, the nine high lords of the upper mystery, mixed and transformed, all as one god, pray that they raise and lower the seven essences, flow and descend in my body, turn four and three, open the seven origins, block the death gate in the northeast, receive the birth palace in the nine mysteries, record the name East Splendour, receive service at the Jade Morning.” Finished, swallow the breath twenty-seven times.

Next one thinks of the Sixth Discipline Star, Fate Mechanism, North Pole Kaiyang, Soul Platform, Scarlet Emperor of Emptiness and Nothingness, the nine high lords, clad in vermilion brocade flying skirts, crown of Mysterious Morning, descending from the mysterious dipper, chanting:

“Fate Mechanism, North Pole Kaiyang, Soul Spirit, Scarlet Emperor of Emptiness, the nine high lords, mixed and transformed, all as one god, pray that they open the heaven of the one and three diagrams, turn down the Northern Emperor Fengdu’s six palaces, subdue the Yin officials, remove the root of nine deaths, turn the three to return four, pass through name seven origins, preserve eternally, coeval with the dipper.” Finished, swallow the breath twenty-seven times.

Next one thinks of the Seventh Gate Star, Mysterious Yang Heavenly Gate, Shaking Light, Great Brightness, Supreme Jade Emperor Tao Sovereign, clad in scarlet brocade gauze skirts, crown of Mysterious Morning, descending from the mysterious dipper, chanting:

“Mysterious Yang Heavenly Gate, Shaking Light, Great Brightness, Supreme Jade Emperor Tao Sovereign, mixed and transformed, all as one god, pray that they summon the imperial morning nine true emperors, nine yin in mixture, turn the heavenly gate, dissolve my seven mysteries’ ancestors, permit me to roam the mysterious clouds, cut off my northern yin death root, record my East Splendour jade chapter.” Finished, swallow the breath twenty-seven times.

Having maintained the seven origins, knock the teeth twelve times in communication, close the eyes and think of the seven stars’ bright light in the north, illuminating the north, the mysterious essence shining within, coming to cover my body. The true lords of the dipper in primordial chaos, changing without fixed form, together riding the green rosy clouds, come to welcome my body, ascending with me amid the seven stars. I suddenly perceive my body beneath the central canopy of the dipper, radiant with essence light, crowned all round the body, revolving with the dipper as with the wheel of a chariot. In a moment, the Heavenly Gate opens. The seven stars and nine lords each confer upon me the talisman of opening and clearing the seven origins, to govern the Northern Emperor’s six palaces, sever and block the root of death breath. Receiving the talisman, I turn about to return to my original source, returning to the dipper. The seven talismans shine like the essence of fire, moving me downward, suddenly treading the void; in a flash I am in the sleeping grove. Knock the teeth thirty-six times in communication, and looking upward recite:

“Mysterious radiance shines essence, flowing light flashes form, abandoning rosy clouds and fleeing transformations, ascending the seven stars, rapid as the wheeling dipper, the heavenly gate opens, passing me to birth, Northern Emperor’s Yin palace, dropping my death name, neither passing nor falling; ascending above to the seven essences, I wear the seven origins, flowing golden fire-bells, clearing the heavenly mechanism, spreading through the eight dark realms, employing the six jia, commanding the six ding, heaven descends mysterious rosy clouds, emperor bestows divine weapons, begging East Splendour to record my jade name, flying through the void and riding the void, ascending to the Jade Clarity.” Then swallow the breath thirty-six times and cease.

This is the Way of opening the Heavenly Gate, severing the root of death breath, and mixing myriad transformations, ending here. Practising for seven years, wearing the talisman clearing the seven origins, the flying rosy and green litter come to welcome the destined body. This is secret cultivation, be careful not to lightly divulge.

### Scripture of the Opening of Heaven’s Three Diagrams and the Seven Stars’ Passing through the Heavenly Gates of Supreme Clarity of Perfect Truth — Scroll Two

**Talisman of the Emperor Sovereign Clearing the Seven Origins**

The right side is written in orpiment in raw green.

The right side in sky blue written in scarlet.

The right side in vermilion written in blue green, also called yellow written in white.

The right side in orpiment written in white.

The right side in orpiment written in raw purple, also called black written in white.

The right side in black written in yellow white.

The right side in vermilion written in blue green.

The right side is the inner talisman of clearing the seven origins, which the Emperor Sovereign gives to the Heavenly Emperor; the Heavenly Emperor transmits to the South Pole Supreme Origin Sovereign; the South Pole Supreme Origin Sovereign transmits to the Supreme Micro Heavenly Emperor; the Supreme Micro Heavenly Emperor transmits to the Golden Palace Sovereign; the Golden Palace Sovereign entrusts the Prime Minister Blue Youth Sovereign to give to those who are to respond and become immortals. According to the Scripture of the Four Extremes Bright Codes, the talismans are issued once every seven hundred years. The method of transmission is: if the disciple announces a fast of seven days, acquires thirty-one feet of blue patterned silk, seventy feet of blue silk, ninety feet of phoenix patterned gauze, seven pairs of golden buttons, one pair each of golden fish and jade dragon, to serve as the oath of announcement. Without faith, receiving the scripture is called light leakage of heavenly treasure; violating faith to transmit scripture is called leakage of the heavenly Way. The sages value the Way but disdain riches, and therefore transmit only with faith. Men are vexed by riches and seek the Way, and the Way is afar. Even amid leakage, seeing the precious texts, if the body perishes in the ghost officials and harms the seven mysteries, it is of no benefit to obtain. If one has earnest will and empty heart, opening to the Jade Emperor, naming East Splendour, dwelling in a secluded mountain retreat, cutting off one's own clothing and food, then one may open and entrust. Students who do not know that heaven has opening gates and earth has Fengdu, that the opening gates govern the spirits and Dengdu governs the ghosts — these are the two Emperors, governing the response of life and death, linked by the seven stars’ pivot. Therefore the seven stars move and pass through, the Northern Emperor has no name of the six officials, the opening gates have the immortal record registers, the mysterious dipper responds as the canopy, the seven origins confer clearing, the path to immortality lies nearby.

The South Pole Supreme Origin Sovereign said: Men with will have their hearts enlightened by the seven stars and nine emperors, cultivating with bitter thought, and obtain this scripture. Cultivating seven years, they ascend by broad daylight to the morning. If only this scripture is held but no thought maintained, burning incense at both sides, the seven stars’ essences will still mysteriously shine upon their chambers, and the Fengdu officials will not dare approach their bodies.

When the passing of the seven stars is complete, next think to maintain the two Emperor Stars, sitting upright facing east, knocking teeth thirty-six times in communication, maintaining thought of the two Emperor Stars, the High Supreme Jade Emperor’s Eight Scenes and Nine Lords, the Supreme Micro Jade Emperor’s Seven Star Lords, all clad in flying cloud purple brocade skirts, crowns of Mysterious Morning, descending from the mysterious dipper into my body, chanting:

“High Supreme Jade Emperor’s Eight Scenes and Nine Lords, Supreme Micro Emperor’s Seven Star Lords, nine transformations mixed with two supreme emperors, open the heavenly gate for me, pass the jade name, sever and block the ghost gate, the Northern Emperor’s six palaces’ death root is cut off, ascend the seven origins, bestow on me the Eight Scenes, Seven Essences, Nine Emperors’ flying carriage and green litter, ascend the imperial morning, govern the imperial consorts, command the myriad spirits.” Finished, swallow the breath twenty-one times.

**Jade Emperor’s Flying Talisman for Opening the Heavenly Gate**

The right side is written in orpiment in raw green.

The two Emperor talismans ascend amid the seven stars’ canopy. The two Emperor Stars govern beneath the canopy, which always covers them, their essence light unseen, unseen by men. Hence it is said in the “Golden Book Jade Characters”: “He who sees the two stars will prolong life six hundred years.” Without the two Emperor’s flying talismans, one cannot ascend beneath the canopy; the two stars are not seen by you. Wearing the two talismans, the two Emperors themselves by their mysterious light shine upon your body; cultivate for seven years and ascend by broad daylight.

**Northern Emperor Fengdu Six Palaces’ Method for Passing from Death**

Mount Fengdu lies in the north, the Gui land, hence the northeast is the ghost gate, the root of death breath. The mountain is two thousand six hundred li high, circling thirty thousand li. Beneath the mountain lies the Grotto Heaven Prime, circling fifteen thousand li beneath the mountain; above and below are palaces and chambers of ghosts and spirits. On the mountain are six palaces; within the grotto are another six palaces, each palace circling a thousand li. These are the six heavens’ palaces of ghosts and spirits.

The First Palace is named the Palace of Absolute Yin of Zhou; it governs men.

The Second Palace is named the Palace of Supreme Killing, Palace of Matters of Reason.

The Third Palace is named the Palace of Bright Morning, Enduring Offences, Martial City.

The Fourth Palace is named the Palace of Calm Illumination, Sin Breath.

The Fifth Palace is named the Palace of Ancestral Spirits, Seven Offences.

The Sixth Palace is named the Palace of Daring Control, Linking and Repeated.

These six palaces are governed by the Northern Emperor, the six heavens’ ghosts and spirits. They govern men’s names; the dead all pass through Fengdu’s six palaces. Therefore the Emperor Sovereign often commands those who study the passing of the seven stars and the immortals to pass through the heavenly gates of the South Pole Palace, severing the death gate in the northeast. When you have completed the passing and the course, knock the left teeth nine times in communication, call the names of the six palaces, and chant:

“I am the Emperor Sovereign’s servant, named in the Jade Clarity, governing the six heavens, Northern Emperor’s ghost palaces, all are my camp; those under my rule, what ghost dares live? Wearing the talisman clearing, bearing the fire bell on the left, casting fire for ten thousand li, commanding myriad spirits; those who offend are executed, those who interfere are punished. The Emperor Sovereign commands, capturing without pause.”

When all is done, one incantation causes the heavenly light to tremble, myriad demons to bind their forms; three incantations cause ghosts and demons to perish; six palaces sever men’s death names; the Heavenly Gate passes men, the South Pole gives life. Those who do not know the names of Fengdu’s palaces, governed by ghosts and spirits, and do not study severing and blocking the death capital, will also not succeed in immortality.

**The Superior Method of Five Separations to Pass from Death to Life**

In practising the Way of Passing the Six Meetings, one should cultivate the Five Mornings’ separation at the death gate, passing at the birth palace, the flying immortals’ upper method. One should choose the days of Renshen, Bingshen, Wushen, Jiashen, Gengshen, the five days of death separation. At that time the Emperor Sovereign holds a high feast in the carriage of the shining dragon, the green rosy flying litter, accompanied by the immortal officials and jade maidens, roving for ten days and descending to the human realm to inspect those who study immortality. He commands the Northern Emperor, the Five Lords of Great Yin, to carry the death registers and ascend to the Palace of the Lord of Evenness to examine the registers of death and life. The Five Directions’ Five Star True Emperor Lords each govern their quarter, commanding the immortals who should obtain the Way, named East Splendour. There are Yin sins and Yin offences, Yang sins and Yang offences, all recorded by the Northern Emperor. The Great Yin Lord names the Palace of Fengdu, separating the good and evil, the living and the dead. Therefore on the days of Five Separation, the chief sin lies at Great Yin; cultivate life at Great Yang; fall into the death register at the Northern Emperor; seek the immortality register at the Five Stars. At each such day, with full purification and proper clothing, burning incense in the chamber, repenting sins and thinking of good, preserving the spirit and concentrating on the mysterious, without other thoughts, the Emperor Sovereign roves the Five Realms, the spirit officials record the merit of disciples, naming it to the Jade Emperor. Thus for five years, one may obtain the Five Stars’ True Emperor coming to descend upon the disciple’s chamber. On this day, at dawn, noon, and midnight, enter the chamber, burn incense, face north and bow twice, knock teeth three times, maintaining the incantation:

“High Supreme Jade Emperor Sovereign, pray remove and eliminate all my sins and offences since birth to this day, down to the seven ancestors, binding my misdeeds and evil ways, killing life, lust, envy, and harming the correct Way, thousands of sins and offences, Yang sins and Yin offences, all named to the Northern Emperor; pray remove and disperse, erase the names of sin, sever the root of death, pass through the Heavenly Gate to attain East Splendour, record the chief chapter, the seven ancestors and grandparents, return fetal to the southern immortals.”

Finished, then think of the Northern Star True Emperor Lord of the Spirit Origin, clad in purple brocade flying skirt, belt with tiger tally, head with yellow crown, riding brocade rosy flying clouds, accompanied by twelve immortal officials, descending from the north, covering my body, light dense and shining, radiant with essence rays, looking upward chant:

“Northern True Emperor, commanding flying immortals, riding clouds and turning carriage, come to crown my body, pray fill and block the ghost gate, sever the root of death, name me in Jade Clarity, open and release the Heavenly Gate, I depart from severance of the Northern Emperor, ascend the southern pavilion, longevity with the True Emperor, together protect the Northern Pole.” Then swallow the breath twenty-five times and cease, face east and bow twice, knock teeth three times, maintain the incantation:

“Jade Morning Supreme Lord, Supreme Ultimate Origin Lord, pray remove all my sins and offences since birth, up to the seven ancestors’ bindings and misdeeds, linked with the three Yin, all named to Great Yin, sin names tied to the Northern Pole, pray open and release, sever and extinguish, fill and block the root of death breath, Northern Emperor remove my old bindings, East Splendour record my jade chapter, seven mysteries’ parents, together ascend the imperial morning.”

Finished, next think of the Eastern Year Star True Emperor Lord Qingya, clad in cloud brocade dragon pattern skirt, belt with tiger tally, head with yellow and jade crown, riding blue rosy flying clouds and jade carriage, accompanied by twelve immortal officials, descending from the east, covering my body, light dense and bright, radiant in the east, looking upward chant:

“Eastern True Emperor, flowing rosy nine gates, light shining within and without, covering and crowning the destined body, I pray you grant me, reporting to the Northern Emperor, sever my death root, pass my jade name, East Splendour Inner Truth, I attain passing and ascent, forever departing the death path, seven mysteries’ parents, all enjoy blessings and happiness, being born with the moon, dying with the sun, riding the void and floating in the air, ascending the flying step.”

Then swallow the breath nine times and cease, face south and bow twice, knock teeth three times, maintain the incantation:

“Supreme Clarity’s Three Origin Lords, South Pole Supreme Origin Lord, Great Yang Nine Vitalities Jade Worthy Origin Lord, pray forgive all my sins and offences known since birth to this day, including envy of the talented, disclosure of scripture, treading pollution and dust, laziness towards the Three Lights, incantation, oath and tears, ascend to the Emperor Lord, old bindings tied to Great Yin, sin names tied to the ghost officials, pray open and release, sever and extinguish, block the root of death, pass the path of life, seven ancestors and grandparents, ascend the northern hall.”

Finished, next think of the Southern Mars Star True Emperor Lord Weiting, clad in cloud frost phoenix and dragon bells, belt with tiger tally, head with Mysterious Morning crown, flying in blue brocade robes, riding scarlet rosy carriage, accompanied by twelve immortal officials, descending from the south, covering my body, light shining brightly as the rising sun, looking upward chant:

“Southern True Emperor, mysterious image flowing light, roaming the three gates, accompanying the scarlet carriage, ascending the seven origins, light shining within, crowning my body, removing and cutting off the Northern Emperor’s sin names, dissolving bindings and stagnation, extinguishing Great Yin, body departing from the ghost gate’s midst, severing the roots of ancient bindings, ascending the Heavenly Gate, entering the southern pavilion, seven ancestors and grandparents, together visit the Emperor’s presence.”

Then eight swallows of breath and cease, face west and bow twice, knock teeth three times, maintain the incantation:

“Great Elemental Three Origin Lords, Four Elders of the Daoist Central Lords, pray forgive all that I have done and committed since birth, including envy of the able, lightly disclosing scripture, treading filth and dust, laziness towards the Three Lights, incantation, oath and tears, ascend to the Emperor Lord, old bindings tied to Great Yin, sin names tied to ghost officials, pray open and release, sever and extinguish, block and close death paths, pass the path of life, seven ancestors and grandparents, ascend the northern hall.”

Finished, next think of the Western Venus Star True Emperor Lord Liaoling, clad in white brocade with flowing bells skirt, belt with tiger marks, head with Early Morning crown, riding white rosy flying carriage, accompanied by twelve immortal officials, descending from the west, covering my body, light shining clearly, radiant in the west, looking upward chant:

“Western True Emperor, white shining mysterious mark, accompanying the jade carriage, white splendor dense in the heavens, returning to morning to descend, true form opening and crossing, turning my nine gates, passing the imperial court, body departing Great Yin’s record, ascending the mysterious palace, together singing praises, longevity surpassing heaven and earth, countless years unspoiled, seven mysteries’ parents, all ascend to the morning heavens.”

Finished, then six swallows of breath and cease, next face the centre and bow twice, knock teeth three times, maintain the incantation:

“High Supreme Great Emperor Lord, Jade Emperor Lord, pray forgive all my sins and offences since birth until today, countless faults and offences, seven ancestors’ old bindings connected and unresolved, affairs tied to Great Yin, pray also remove and open, disperse and sever the mysterious Northern Emperor’s name, cut off the Gui land ghost gate’s death breath root, pass the name through the Heavenly Gate, traverse the Five Mornings, seven mysteries’ parents, all receive renewed immortality.”

Next think of the Central Guardian Star True Emperor Lord Tanchen, clad in yellow cloud dragon brocade tiger skirt, belt with golden tally, head with purple crown, riding yellow rosy flying carriage, accompanied by twelve immortal officials, descending from the centre, crowning and covering my body, light shining clearly, radiant in the middle origin, looking upward chant:

“Central Guardian Star True Emperor Lord, commanding the Five Emperors, turning the mysterious thread, accompanying the yellow rosy carriage, roving the four quarters, for me to sever the root of death, pass the name to the southern sunshine palace, separate the five to return six, flying with me, transforming ten thousand crossings, enjoying boundless, ascending the Supreme Ultimate, Golden Palace Jade Hall, seven ancestors and grandparents, together with talisman and blessings.”

Finished, then swallow the breath twelve times and cease.

The Five Separations begin with the Five Emperors, maintaining the Five Mornings to pass life; the matter is complete here. If one always performs this on the appointed days without neglect, after seven years one will receive the true emperor of the Five Mornings to appear in one’s sleeping chamber. The Supreme Emperor will dispatch five jade maidens from the five directions to guard the body; the Northern Emperor of Great Yin also comes to the door, but dares not detain the disciple’s sins. Those who study immortality and seek the truth should diligently practise. Repenting and seeking immortality in this Way is the Prime Minister Blue Youth Sovereign’s request to the Golden Palace Sage Sovereign’s method, to serve as a warning to later learners, not the Supreme Emperor’s repentance. If one performs the matter, the Emperor Sovereign also watches one’s heart; if old faults remain incompletely removed, the six heavens’ palaces will not let fall the disciple’s death names, the opening gate’s door will not pass the disciple’s body. Therefore the palace of union and separation is the door of passing life, the opening gate the office of passing birth; the palace of union and separation is the source of filling death. Only by earnest seeking can one obtain the truth.

**Emperor Sovereign’s Method of Internal Illumination Lamp for Seeking Immortality**

Received from the South Pole Supreme Origin Sovereign.

The Emperor Sovereign always dwells on the Clear Mysterious Terrace, within the golden chamber and purple door, illuminating himself with a bright mysterious lamp, connecting the rosy light through the eight windows, contemplating the Great Perfected with the five shapes, opening the three wishes in the Emperor’s chamber, the spirit descending with purple canopy, the primal emperor giving the golden boy, naturally naming me the imperial seat, governing all in the Mysterious Palace. The highest grade is born of the origin of subtlety, the Way lies in the faint light; now I tell you, you must diligently serve.

Tell the South Pole Supreme Origin Sovereign: You study the Way of the Spirit and Truth, dwelling above the spirit officials, inside the jade chamber, yet do not know to illuminate the lamp to reflect yourself, to connect the mysterious light within the five viscera, and thereby obtain brightness; the body and spirit obtain their return. If you can illuminate the lamp at evening on your original life, illuminate at morning your active year, and keep the lamp lit always upon the year of the great age, three places of wishful thought, your body will be clear, the breath correct, true light shining, myriad spirits bright and pure. The Supreme Origin Sovereign receives and enacts the method; after three years one will bring forth twenty-four children of night light, the mysterious light shines naturally and bright, needing no lamp but passing light. Yet this highest perfect and pure subtle method is not transmitted to later generations. If one has the golden name, jade characters, and mysterious pattern, and obtains my Way, practising it nine years, the body shines brightly, seeing through ten thousand li, the mysterious view is natural, the children of night light descend to your chamber, give you the true writings, and by day ascend the morning.

Always illuminate the lamp above the resting chamber of your original life; at evening enter the chamber, kneel long facing the lamp, knock teeth twelve times, chant:

“Mysterious light shines on Great Yin, reaching all eight directions, pure spirit wrapped in the chamber, looking upward and penetrating the Upper Clarity, the Five Radiances issuing from the Mysterious Terrace, jade fungus naturally grows, penetrating and passing the Great Perfected, myriad spirits watch my form, cutting and extinguishing the nine Yin breath, recording my East Splendour name, preserving me without end, enduring with sun and moon, lifting and passing the seven mysteries’ difficulties, the southern palace receiving honour, bright light opening the Jade Emperor, ascending to receive the internal view scripture, heaven descends the flying rosy chariot, soaring the void riding green litter, attaining audience at the Supreme Emperor’s hall, advancing to the Jade Emperor’s court.” Finished, bow again, face the original life and look upward, swallow saliva seven times and cease.

Also always illuminate the lamp above the active year; at morning face the lamp, knock teeth twelve times, chant:

“The bright lamp shines upon the active year, scattering light and shining upon the eight directions, the pure and clear colour is bright, internal view bright as sky, opening and releasing the clear spirit collar, you are connected with the Jade Perfected, looking upward towards the supreme Way, faint and distant without form or trace, hoping to receive the descent of the mysterious clouds, holding reins to guide the flying dragon, turning back my hundred-year term, returning to the infant form, granting me the Western Flower Maiden, giving me the Golden Morning Boy, attending incense to tread the year’s life, bowing to the Jade Emperor’s chamber, the spirit calm and the Way also smooth, fearing to enter the incense smoke, regulating the mind to dwell in the Great Mystery, essence responding and penetrating the void, calling down the spirit of the sky, closing eyes to look upon the Immortal Lord, removing the faults of seven ancestors’ difficulties, passing the form and returning to the southern palace.” Finished, bow again, face east, swallow breath twenty-seven times and cease.

Always illuminate the lamp upon the great age to communicate with the spirit, fulfilling wishes to seek truth. After three years the mysterious light will shine within, the spirit and truth will descend, give you the method of immortality. At that time there will be response. Every morning and evening burn incense, knock teeth twelve times, facing the lamp chant:

“The lamp fire shines upon the Great Perfected, bright light piercing the mysterious void, opening and revealing the supreme Way, heart concentrating upon the Jade Emperor’s abode, penetrating and reaching the void inside, the spirit watches and the form naturally relaxes, accumulating response to cause spirit descent, heart serene and principle dwelling hidden, morning rites at the Supreme Emperor’s hall, evening reciting the true book, wandering freely in the mysterious capital, ten thousand years returning to infancy, heavenly crown with purple rosy clouds, emperor bestows six jade carriages, floating and roaming the five mountains’ summits, attaining what the heart desires, the seven ancestors free from three paths, blessings and happiness abound.” Finished, bow again, swallow saliva twenty-seven times and cease.

If one can always keep the lamp lit in the three places without extinguishing, the seven mysteries and nine ancestors will immediately pass the ten sufferings of severance, ascend to the South Pole, one’s body and spirit will be bright and correct, seeing ten thousand li, hearing clearly afar, mind and wisdom reversing to know the not yet, spirit and truth will descend, children of night light will teach you the Way of Immortality. After nine years like this, the spiritual light will be bright, connecting without and within. The Five Separations begin with the Five Emperors, maintaining the Five Mornings to pass life; the matter is complete here.

**Emperor Sovereign’s Five Wishes for Seeking Immortality**

The Emperor Sovereign always on the days of the ninth day of the ninth month, the fifth day of the tenth month, the third day of the third month, the eighth day of the fourth month, and the seventh day of the seventh month — these are the five wishes and ten meetings — ascends the Supreme Ultimate Jade Terrace, within the High Supreme Jade Hall and Golden Chamber, maintaining the five wishes in the jade palace, hoping for the mysterious truth to descend, the void opening with jade edict, golden sound resounding in the sky, summoning the Five Emperors to guard the spirit, celebrating the myriad meetings in the cinnabar chamber. Thus there is response and true descents. On these days, one bathes and purifies, enters the chamber to burn incense, bowing the heart to the four directions, seated facing due east — east is the quarter of the beginning of Yang’s first light. Knock teeth thirty-six times. The first highest wish is: “May I be born of natural breath, may the breath congeal to form my body, my body be equal to the Three Radiances, long enjoying the root of endlessness. The second wish: May my body always dwell above the void in the jade palace and jade chamber, dining with the Jade Emperor in the morning, resting with the Mysterious Mother at night, thirst slaking at the roaring waves’ jade spring and mushroom, hunger fed by dragon fetus, jade fat, scarlet trees and red children. The third wish: May my body bear myriad auspicious signs and seventy-two lights, strange hair and unusual bones, flying feathers and robes, riding the void and driving the air, entering and exiting the imperial palace, myriad celebrations come to me, longevity without limit. The fourth wish: May I be born with none, die with none, die and be born again, born as the true emperor, enthroned over the ten heavens, commanding the multitude of immortals. The fifth wish: May all beings, born and unborn, together preserve the Three Radiances of sun and moon, the Wayful persons, the seven mysteries’ ancestors, ascend the southern palace, the world’s blessings, none to be excluded.” The four directions’ five wishes all assemble in the jade hall.

Next the highest wish is the nurturing of the nine mysteries of my body, soul, and true spirits always dwelling in my palace, ascending to the heavenly immortals, descending to the grotto abyss; may heaven, earth, wind, spirits, and immortals, the five wishes united, fix the record of longevity, heaven descend purple smoke, earth guard five spirits, riding clouds and driving the void, flying chariots and green litter, ascending to the Golden Palace, advancing to Jade Clarity, celebrating with the seven ancestors, again receiving fetal birth, the five wishes united, long enjoying benefit and chastity.

The middle wishes are also five: to attain the root of the Way, praying for Yin, Yang, Supreme Void, Supreme Nothingness, Supreme Mystery, to feast in the jade chamber with the Emperor by fate, roaming the path of birth, opening the waves of the Nine Heavens, the primal father fixing the register, the mysterious mother recording the years, the peach and apricot congealing essence, preserving and strengthening the cinnabar field, body soaring to the Golden Palace, name recorded in the jade chapter, seven ancestors liberated, blessings arriving.

The lower wishes are also five: praying for Supreme Void, Supreme Being, Supreme Highest, Supreme Perfect, and Spirits and Immortals, moving the body on the ridges of the Five Mountains, floating in the nine skies, entering and exiting the opening gates, passing beyond the death gate, praying that heaven and earth be my parents, the Three Radiances guard me for ten thousand years, spirits guard the nine origins’ apertures, spirits descend the natural breath, the eight directions and five wishes together respond. When the five wishes are complete, knock teeth twenty-seven times, chanting:

“Supreme Emperor Supreme Origin, Emperor One Mysterious Scripture, five clouds scatter light, luxuriant and abundant the Three Pure Ones, jade boy and jade maiden, burning incense to attend the spirit, the highest wish opens and displays, uniting with me in form, making me a spirit immortal, ascending the imperial court, Northern Emperor falling death, Southern Dipper noting life, East Splendour Golden Pavilion, gaining my name, endless wishes, equal with me.” When the incantation finishes, knock teeth thirty-seven times, look upward and swallow breath five times and cease.

This is the Emperor Sovereign’s opening and displaying of the upper wishes and the Way of uniting with the spirit in form. One who can do this regularly will have the jade splendour attending and guarding, jade boys scattering incense, ascending through the Nine Heavens, responding with the Emperor Sovereign. Seven years thus, the Way will descend by itself. Throughout the world in ten directions all who have the Way’s wishes will have the Way descending upon them. At the moment of verbal wishing, the mind’s intent must be one, without other thoughts or distractions; if the true spirit scatters and departs, the wish will not descend. Treading pollution and filth, the true spirit is also far off. The Emperor Sovereign’s upper wishes of the five meetings’ Way end here. Each time those days arrive, if one can with earnest heart wish and maintain the Way, the Emperor will dispatch jade boys to guard the body, summon the five directions’ wishes, and the Way of spirits and immortals will descend upon your form. Thus for five years one may ride flying clouds, ascend the Nine Heavens, be listed in East Splendour; seven ancestors and grandparents will also bear the blessings, departing the Three Paths and receiving immortality in the southern palace.

The South Pole Supreme Origin Sovereign said: The world’s people studying only know to seek by morning and obtain by evening, one thought hoping for descent, spitting incantations and hoping for response, not knowing to ascend the ridges of the resting branch, beginning at the mountain path, thousand-zhang wood emerging from a hair’s tip — the Way is high and truly wondrous, how can one set foot and hope to ascend the cloud ladder? The Emperor Sovereign receives breath and governs the truth, yet still illuminates the lamp to communicate, the five wishes to hope for blessings; how could he not embrace nature? The Way of seeking immortality must begin with wishing, then seeking; wishing causes response and spirit to arise. The five wishes are great, encompassing all; blessings cover all; happiness flows freely; it may be said to touch the good wish. If one can with earnest heart maintain the wish, there will be no lack of response; later generations who have feeling will again come to investigate and take heart.

The Prime Minister Blue Youth Sovereign said: I studied for seven hundred years, crossed lofty peaks, traversed east and west, passed south and north, roamed the central plains, studied under thirty-two masters, received over three hundred matters, yet did not ascend to the Golden Palace, did not visit the Sage Sovereign to receive the spiritual purple writings, did not practise the Way of binding spirit and soul with the sun and moon’s yellow splendor, did not form the gem and dense tokens, nor know the Nine Perfect and Eight Paths for dissolving form and fleeing transformation, nor the purple pass, blazing light, flowing golden fire bells, breathing in and out the flying rosy clouds, soaring in the void, treading the seven origins’ precious scripture. The Sage Sovereign treasures the passing of the seven stars; the Supreme Emperor treasures it; he commands an oath and transmission, severing the death names in the six palaces, filling the northeast ghost gate, opening the Heavenly Gates to pass my body, whence one may ascend the three origins to practise, and be appointed Prime Minister, governing the multitudes of immortals. The seven stars shine in heaven, turning the essence of the nine origins, riding the breath of the three origins, governing the names of the six heavens, life and death, union and separation, all arise from the seven stars. Therefore, if man is added by the dipper, he dies; if moved by the dipper, he lives. Therefore the seven stars are the celestial image; the opening gates are the office of passing life. Those who do not know to sever the death gate northeast, nor pass the birth gate south, how can life not be preserved? The Supreme Emperor has hidden this scripture in the palace of the six harmonies, commanding three hundred Western Flower Jade Maidens and Golden Morning Jade Boys to guard the spiritual writings, later transmitting to the Perfected Ones, and it came from the famous mountains.

The Lord of West City, after retiring to fasting for three months, brought a letter to the mountain and received the transmission of opening and reviewing, the seven stars’ passing through, practising the Way, attaining Perfected Ones. None without jade names attaining immortality have heard or seen this Way. Those who have the scripture, the Fengdu six palaces will record their names, passing them through the southern gate, much less those who cultivate it. The Lord of West City said: This originally had three scrolls, the Heavenly Gate and Heavenly Diagram two scrolls, not circulated in the world. The Lady of the Southern Mountain received just this one scroll of the Seven Stars’ Passing.

Scripture of the Opening of Heaven’s Three Diagrams and the Seven Stars’ Passing through the Heavenly Gates of Supreme Clarity of Perfect Truth — Scroll Two
