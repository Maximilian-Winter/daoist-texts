The Scripture of the Eight Primal Essences of the Supreme Cave-Truth: The Secret Formula for Consuming the Imperial Blossoms of Sun and Moon

The Great Emperor of Fusang, having received the scripture, transmitted it to the Four Perfected of the Supreme Ultimate, consulting the Western Tortoise Queen Mother. The Queen Mother told the Great Emperor: The years of the Supreme Sovereign, whereby men learn and behold the precious writings, and ascend their seats in Jade Purity, all depend upon the secret cultivation of the precious Dao, the mystery of spirit—unspoken by mouth, unmanifested to men, silently felt in deepest stillness, thus attaining the Supreme Perfected. Therefore the Dao esteems concealment and quietude, transforming itself in formlessness, issuing from voicelessness.

Since I received the true scripture in the Nine Vacuities, countless eons have passed, and it has not been transmitted to three persons. At the end of the first year of the Central Sovereign, it was engraved in the Northern Primordial Land of the Celestial Middle, in the country of Lona, on the mountain of the spirit mirror man-bird, the peak of Jilai, within the Spirit Palace. Here the Nine Profound, Perfect Unity qi was condensed and formed into characters. Later the Sacred Nine Profound Golden Gate Emperor came to see the Spirit Writings, and commanded the Immortal Capital to wield the brush and write, binding by heavenly oath; cultivating the Way thus attained, his seat ascended the Golden Gate. The Most High, deeming that I had lightly divulged the Heavenly Treasure, diminished my title of True Origin, and demoted me to roaming and scattered spirit official; only after five hundred years was I restored to my original truth.

Primordial Origin established the palaces of the Four Administrators and Five Emperors, placing under divine troops, precisely to inspect leakage and punish with wind blades. How could one not be cautious! Afterwards, the disciples are as numerous as forests, yet not one attains immortality—what reason? All are due to the leakage of the Dao’s writings in form; the celestial truth not descending, heavenly punishments subtly manifest; advancing and retreating with lost will, dying alone in empty mountains, to no purpose and with bitter lamentation. The Dao is not one of diligence without revelation, nor secrecy without action. When the true scripture is seen, one must secretly practice and seek the spirit; the divine and true are easily moved, and by reckoning the days one may become immortal.

Like the Four Extremities Perfected, possessing the complete scripture and myriad precepts, the precious Dao secret and true, holding fast the spirit chart, minds and spirits upright and towering, their names carved in the Jade Purity, the imperial tablets recorded, their seats ascending the Four Extremities, bestowing this unto others—what doubt could there be in this? Thus the Great Emperor transmitted the “Eight Primal Essences Scripture” according to the covenant. The Western City King Lord now enshrines one copy within Emei Mountain, in a curved chamber. The “Eight Primal Essences Scripture” in mysterious script arose within Great Void, seen on the Western Tortoise Mountain, above the Mysterious Garden, beneath piled stones, wrapped in golden halls and jade chambers.

The Eight Primal Essences bear lofty, profound, feathered banners; the spirit script richly resplendent in cave signs; purple characters radiate within jade forests; divine light streams and shines through the Nine Origins; golden sounds ring hollow and clear in purple heavens; cinnabar clouds spread shade in jade chambers; soaring skywards they surge in condensed truth; the purple phoenix shakes its wings, spirit winds raise smoke, flowing fragrance stirs the qi, penetrating subtle mysteries.

On the left moves naturally the Golden Boy; on the right commands the Supreme Void Immortal; the divine consorts attend and guard; Taihua holds the silk scarf; the jade attendants assist at their posts; the Four Administrators approach the throne; the Two Luminaries pause their radiance; the Three Dawns gather their essence; flying immortals gallop among each other; streaming light clouds form encampments; splendid brilliance intermingles and shines; the Three Candles converge in brightness; literary majesty glows and shines; qi spreads through the Purple Court; the assembly of many perfected hold feast and rites, praising Jade Purity. Thus is this divine script the highest sovereign, its virtue lofty and sublime in the High Spirit.

Then the Most High Jade Dawn Supreme Dao Lord, in pure fasting within the Upper Palace, took the purple-gold heavenly vow, receiving it from the Nine Profound. Gathering yellow blossoms from the Eastern Well, plucking the sun’s root at the Golden Gate, turning the Two Luminaries with mysterious infusion, receiving the flying essence to illuminate the face, drawing the Supreme Void as an appointment, sharing the same year as the Three Lights, naming the supreme in the High Above, compiling the purple records in Jade Dawn, directing myriad offices in the imperial chart, governing the Jade Emperor among the upper immortals, consuming the Eight Primal Essences by sun and moon, chanting jade tablets to turn the spirit, appointing the spiritual perfected for their delight.

Through myriad kalpas it has not been transmitted. This Dao flies through void and steps upon emptiness, surpassing and soaring the marvels of the Supreme Perfected. It ought only to be transmitted to those who have gained the Dao and possess the bone chart, that they be true perfected. Among disciples striving for immortality, a million men, not one has seen its chapters or titles.

The Golden Gate above Heaven, the Azure Palace of the Square, and the Earthly Palace, all engraved the tablets backwards before birth, that one may receive the true scripture. Those who receive become supplementary Supreme Perfected, the patriarchs of myriad immortals.

Primordial Origin transmitted the scripture to the Most High Jade Emperor, the Nine Heavens Sovereigns, and the Nine Heavens Elders; in the void and mystery it was displayed on the Western Tortoise Mountain, mysteriously bestowed to the Western Queen Mother. The Supreme Dao Lord received it from the Nine Profound, transmitting it to the Fusang Great Emperor. The Golden Gate Emperor received it from the Northern Primordial, transmitting to the Upper Minister Azure Boy Lord; the Great Emperor transmitted it to the Four Extremities Perfected.

The ancient mysterious Dao, qi begets qi, truth begets truth. The Upper Minister compiled and collected, arranging the spirit writings, secreted in the palace of Great Plenty above the Nine Heavens, guarded by seven hundred jade boys and jade maidens. According to the cycle, over seven hundred years, perfected heard the transmission. The Four Administrators and Five Emperor Spirit Troops, seven hundred strong, correct and punish leakages. Whoever obtains this scripture and transmits it rashly without following the cycle, incurs the blame of the Seven Patriarchs and dies in the Nine Springs.

The sun’s essence is red, round in form but square in appearance; its qi waxing and waning, its movement subtly declining. It customarily arises on the third, ninth, seventeenth, twenty-first, and twenty-fifth days of the month, five times monthly, above the Golden Gate, refining with golden essence, stone scenes, water mother, and spirit blossoms, distilled in the sun’s soul shining with eight rays.

On these days, the sun’s blossoms scatter, flying roots pour down, golden essence overflows, moistening the whole heaven. One who would seek immortality must on these days gather and govern the sun’s root, spirit descending the jade gate, essence filling the hidden passes, body generating wondrous light, sharing the sun’s year. Secretly practicing the Way, ascending to the Golden Gate. The Golden Gate lies within the western gate of heaven, the portal of sun and moon’s communication. The imperial lord is named Red Cinnabar Golden Essence Stone Scene Water Mother, the scripture of the jade embryo.

The moon’s light is yellow, its qi square and pure, round in aspect, revolving and filling, traversing and inclining. It customarily appears on the fifth, fifteenth, and twenty-fifth days of the month, above the Eastern Well, bathing in spirit radiance, polishing essence rays, brightly manifesting the imperial blossom.

On these days, the yang essence scatters, yellow qi entwines within, imperial blossoms overflow, all heaven receives the truth. One who would seek immortality must on these days gather yellow blossoms at the Eastern Well, consume yang essence in the sun’s soul, moistening the nine apertures inside, calming spirits and guarding the five palaces. Cultivating the Way, ascending the moon court. The moon’s body lies within the Eastern Well, the portal where sun and moon shine together. The imperial lord is named Yellow Qi Yang Essence Hidden in Heaven’s Moon, the scripture of the jade embryo.

One who desires to gather the way of the sun’s blossoms and flying roots, before the day arrives, must purify fasting, burn incense, take nine dou of well water, expose it in the courtyard, inscribe the stone scene nine-refined water mother jade talisman, place it in the water, face west, knock teeth twelve times, and softly recite:

“Yang brightness refines essence, light shining in the Purple Court; eight rays brightly reflected, spirit blossoms overflowing; five revolutions and three turns, qi communicates with the Supreme Spirit; flowing fragrance curves and pours, shading and moistening all beings; crowned and girded at the Golden Gate, blossoms and roots brightly clear; consuming the stone scene, water mother pours essence; following heavenly movements, attending to sun’s blossom glory; nine apertures receive truth, liberating the primal form.”

Finished, leave the water in the courtyard overnight. At noon on the next day, take one sheng of the water exposed, consume it facing the sun, knock teeth twenty-four times, and facing upwards, recite:

“Yang essence now communicated, flying blossoms renewed; imperial blossoms flowing and overflowing, shading and entwining within; looking upwards to consume profound moisture, fragrant blossoms arrive to achieve; palaces and chambers expand, cleansing worldly dust; body reflects jade light, face issues golden truth; clouds fly with feathered steps, ascending to the sun’s gate.”

Finished, raise head and draw in the sun essence forty-five times, stop. Bathe the whole body with the remaining water, then return indoors, face west, knock teeth twenty-four times, close eyes and contemplate seeing the five-coloured flowing clouds at midday sun above the left eye and the yellow qi above the right eye, shimmering and sparkling, illuminating the head and face. Softly recite:

“The sun’s soul flows light, five colours pouring; refining soul at Golden Gate, round scene lofty; spirit radiance emits brilliance, receiving the bright heavenly river; jade blossoms overflowing, orchid moist and fragrant; drink my imperial spring, nourish my flying blossoms; pluck roots, swallow substance, longevity like the spirit tree; form joined with great radiance, body soaring in flying clouds; a thousand years, ten thousand kalpas, never failing or erring.”

Finished, bow to the sun gate nine times and stop. This is the gathering of sun root and flying blossoms, the sun’s essence, the profound ancient subtle Way. Practicing for one year, the face develops a jade sheen, the body generates golden light. After seven years the spirit descends, flying through the sun gate; the midday boy converses with the omen. Without golden named imperial charts, green characters in the azure palace, one cannot see its chapters. Careless leakage of spirit writings incurs sevenfold ancestral blame, one’s body perishes, three disciples and five sufferings, ten thousand kalpas without release.

The right stone scene nine-refined water mother jade talisman, inscribed in cinnabar on blue paper, placed in water; also on the day of practice, fully inscribed on blue paper, facing west, consume one piece. Practicing this Way, be cautious of filth, avoid eating the five pungent things, keep the five organs fragrant, one must receive true spirits. If the sky is overcast and no sun appears, practice indoors.

Whoever would gather the moon’s imperial blossoms must on the moon’s arrival at the Eastern Well day, at dawn take one jar of well blossom water, expose it in the courtyard; at midnight inscribe the yang essence jade embryo refining immortal talisman, place it in the water, face east, knock teeth twenty-four times, facing the water recite:

“Yellow qi, yin blossoms, yang essence fresh and clear; bathing the nine souls, crowned and girded at golden dawn; round brightness opens announcement, jade embryo refines immortality; blossoms and light intershine, flowing fragrance washes the ford; nine yang transform together, mysterious clouds scatter smoke; original brightness returns and sets right, curving to reflect my form; flying and ascending to the upper palace, observing the jade pavilion.”

Finished, take one sheng of water, consume it facing the moon; firmly grasp, preserving the moon’s five-coloured flowing essence, all coming to crown and surround the body; within the five colours appears a yellow qi moonlight as large as the pupil, clustered in layers numbering dozens, shining within the moon’s five colours, entering from the mouth into the cave chamber, circling the five organs, then swallowing the essence facing the moon fifty times, swallowing saliva ten times, knocking teeth ten times, softly reciting:

“Yellow qi flows essence, threefold joined condensation of light; mysterious radiance returns to uprightness, crowned and girded with eight rays; refining soul at the Eastern Well, receiving bright flying emperor; golden blossoms scatter spirit, five lords flow fragrance; lady descends with sweet dew, moistening and sprinkling the ten directions; great fungus pours down, filling six bowels; golden essence transforms ninefold, easy scene returns to form; riding the void, descending smoke, roaming and feasting in great void; ascending to the moon court, matched with the true twin; transforming in eight ways, outcoming without incoming; two dawns shine together, forever preserving eternity.”

Finished, bathe with remaining water, complete bathing, return indoors, facing east consume the yang essence jade embryo refining immortal talisman, knock teeth twelve times, softly recite:

“Heaven conceals and enfolds light, yellow qi richly scatters; condensing essence and radiance, eight rays brightly shine; clarifying and adorning yellow blossoms, stone scene washes and pours; jade blossoms overflow, moistening and filling the firmament; all heaven receives refining, opening bright morning; harnessing light to ascend void, attaining imperial residence; long departing the lower world, transcending the eight hardships; shining with the moon, sharing the moon’s year.”

Finished, swallow qi fifty times and stop. This is the consumption of moon blossoms, the Primordial Origin’s subtle method. Practicing for one year, the face grows jade sheen. After seven years spirit descends, body emits golden light. After nine years flying and journeying, ascending the moon realm; the moon’s boy, lady, and five lords tour with oneself. Without golden named imperial tablets, recorded characters of Jade Purity, one cannot inquire or hear. Those who practice this method may attain upper immortality. Careless leakage of spirit writings incurs sevenfold ancestral blame, one’s body perishes in ghost officials’ keeping, long confined in hell; ten thousand kalpas without release.

The right yang essence jade embryo refining immortal talisman, yellow script on white paper, placed in water; also on the day of practice, fully inscribed in yellow script, facing east consume one piece. If the sky is overcast and no moon appears, practice indoors. Missing one day of practice reduces the merits of the previous hundred days.

All advanced disciples who gather sun and moon flying blossoms, at evening rest must knock teeth thirty-six times, firmly grasp, close eyes and contemplate the midday purple light above the left eye and the yellow qi above the right eye, shining and sparkling, illuminating the head and face. Softly recite:

“The Two Luminaries flow essence, light shining upon my form; flying blossoms, imperial fungus, sweet fragrance fills; crowned and girded at the Golden Gate, spreading yellow court; the Three Lights mingle, two qi unite; long preserve the Vermilion Palace, reverse aging and renew; years equal sun and moon, ten thousand kalpas equal in lifespan.”

Finished. Those who constantly practice one year, then at the sun’s midday the director of fate and at the moon the five stars, with true spirit’s radiance and flying blossom’s brilliance, descend to receive the omen body, face bearing golden countenance, head growing purple light. Nine years without loss, once flying, journey through Great Void. The highest wonderful Way, do not transmit to the untrue.

Whoever practices the supreme Dao consuming sun and moon imperial blossoms, every year at one’s birth year and eight seasonal nodes, must inscribe the sun and moon two luminaries flying essence eight primal jade talismans upon bamboo slips, placing them facing forward according to the season, and consume them at dawn. These talismans arise within the Nine Vacuities, visible upon the Western Tortoise Mountain, above the Mysterious Garden, beneath piled stones. The Queen Mother received them in the Nine Profound to guide the flying blossoms of the Two Luminaries’ essence. Thus the Great Primal Three Origins Lord, the Southern Pole Upper Origin Lord, and the Supreme Void Perfected all cultivate this Way, their seats ascending the High Upper Origin Emperor, purple slips of jade void, mysterious spirits and supreme truth. This method is most wondrous, not transmitted to later generations; those who obtain the method fly through mystery, ascend the sun gate, roam freely the moon court, living as long as the Two Luminaries and enduring with qi.

Careless leakage of spirit writings incurs ancestral blame; those who receive must be cautious.

Bamboo slips bear the hollow cave, connecting to the eight primal mysterious radiances, reflecting the two luminaries’ light shining; thus the flying essence is clear upon the bamboo slips. The practice of the female one jade verifying the mysterious mother’s eight gates, performing twelve highest vows, incense rites, summoning spirit energy and seeking the immortal way—without these talismans no spirit will descend, qi will not come down, the Dao will recede far away, and immortality cannot be attained.

After nine years the sun and moon’s mysterious radiance born in the five organs, whole body bright, riding the void flying, sharing the sun’s year. Also named Mysterious Light Natural Golden Spirit.

Also named Three Lights Mysterious Essence Golden Radiance.

The right eight primal flying essence two luminaries jade writings arise in the hollow cave, clear on the peak of Tortoise Mountain, above the Mysterious Garden, beneath piled stones. The source of myriad qi, commanding all heavens’ sun and moon hidden writings, secreted above the Nine Heavens, transmitted once in ten thousand kalpas. Those who obtain the spirit writings, sharing the sun and moon’s year, transforming flowing light, outcoming without incoming, growing purple light, face emitting golden countenance, myriad spirits bowing, ten heavens receiving. After nine years’ cultivation, flying and ascending Great Void, paying court at the Golden Gate, roaming the chambers of sun and moon.

Careless leakage of treasure writings incurs sevenfold ancestral blame, the self perishes, three disciples and five sufferings, ten thousand kalpas without pardon; those who receive must be cautious.

All who practice this Way, on the day of practice must inscribe the talisman, facing the center, knock teeth thirty-six times, close eyes and hold in thought the two luminaries of sun and moon upon one’s own two eyes, above which the purple and yellow qi flourish like smoke, crowning and surrounding the body; then raise the head and draw in the two lights of sun and moon, swallowing the purple and yellow qi fifty times, swallowing saliva ten times and stopping. Softly recite:

“Eight spirits move the mysterious framework, two luminaries return to Great Void; three dawns share spirit light, seven essences shine with eight rays; refining and transforming above Golden Gate, bathing in Eastern Well; flowing radiance shades the cave wilds, stone scenes scatter in the Upper Palace; essence sprinkled beyond the Nine Heavens, great fungus irrigates the ten directions; looking up to consume the eight primal qi, riding heaven gathering flying emperor; spirits descend the six stomachs flourish, reversing form bright with golden countenance; long preserving the sun and moon root, ten thousand kalpas without end.”

Finished, consume the talisman and stop. Practicing this Way, be cautious of filth; if one violates this prohibition, one must cast one weight of true cinnabar in water to cleanse oneself before proceeding. This supreme true secret Way, if divulged, the Way departs; if kept secret, the Way remains. Disciples of study should keep secret and practice diligently, that they may obtain upper immortality.

All advanced disciples who possess this method, if they can long fast and endure hardship, reckon the days to ascend mystery. If they have this scripture but cannot diligently cultivate or meditate on truth and spirit, differing not from the vulgar, they will not lose concealment but remain lower immortals, dissolving the corpse by day. When fate passes to the underworld lord of the moon, or the bones transform the embryo, receiving transformation in the Southern Palace, they must lodge with bone charts and obtain this scripture, ultimately returning to the immortals.

The Supreme Dao Jade Dawn Lord received the Nine Profound Great Void spirit writings, the method of sun and moon imperial blossoms, the imperial lord’s twelve highest vows, the mysterious mother’s eight gate conduct and incense rite spirit, reporting to the bright morning of the Nine Heavens, the incense rite’s summon of spirits. This is the moon blossom and sun radiance qi reflected in the Eastern Well. Those who obtain and practice this Way, the eight primal qi naturally descend, sun and moon flying roots surely may be gathered, the twelve highest vows faithfully fulfilled, the mysterious mother’s eight gates carving the upper immortals. Without this method, one damages spirit in vain toil, gains no profit in seeking immortality. If one desires to carry it out, receive instruction orally from a master; this Way is subtle and marvelous, not practiced in the world; those who obtain it are the Azure Palace’s reverse inscriptions before birth, fixed recorded in Eastern Splendour, surely becoming Jade Purity perfected.

Always on the ninth day of the first month, the eighth day of the second, the seventh of the third, the sixth of the fourth, the fifth of the fifth, the fourth of the sixth, the third of the seventh, the second of the eighth, the first of the ninth, the tenth of the tenth, the eleventh of the eleventh, and the twelfth of the twelfth, twelve days in the year, bathe and fast purely; at midnight in a secret chamber, far and near quiet and settled, men and dogs not hearing, then perform the eight positions. Place eight directional positions, spread a purple-patterned mat two feet four inches square, with white thatch as a cushion; place incense, cakes, dates, and fruits in three baskets, one incense burner before each position, totaling eight incense burners. Inscribe eight slips and place them in the eight directions to invite the officials of the bright morning of the Nine Heavens.

Inscribed in blue on bamboo slip, placed in the due west position.

The right mysterious mother’s eight repeated slips, to invite the spirit of the bright morning of the Nine Heavens, consuming and governing the eight luminary flying essence of sun and moon imperial blossoms, seeking the immortal Way. Written in blue brush on bamboo slips, each one one foot two inches long, to be placed in the eight positions’ seats, demonstrating the incense rite’s spirit summon.

Outside the eight positions, facing north, knock teeth thirty-six times, naming oneself the mountain master Wang Jia, respectfully on the auspicious morning, fasting purely to perform the incense rite, ascending the spirit canopy circling the spirit curve, descending the eight primal qi, coming down to the red heart, all seeing the descent, conferring beggar spirits and immortals.

Next, facing northwest, bow twice long, kneeling to read the first slip to completion, then perform the incense rite, inviting the eight primal subtle azure emperor bright morning Dao Lord, descending the incense seat, conferring the immortal to the subject, to ride the chariot of the first luminary among eight primal purple clouds, ascending Jade Purity, paying court to the Nine Heavens.

Next, facing northeast, bow twice long, kneeling to read the third slip to completion, inviting the six primal purple subtle white emperor bright morning Dao Lord, descending the incense seat, conferring the immortal to the subject, to ride the chariot of the third luminary among six primal red clouds, ascending Jade Purity, paying court to the Nine Heavens.

Next, facing east, bow twice long, kneeling to read the fourth slip to completion, inviting the five primal mysterious subtle black emperor bright morning Dao Lord, descending the incense seat, conferring the immortal to the subject, to ride the chariot of the fourth luminary among five primal azure clouds, ascending Jade Purity, paying court to the Nine Heavens.

Next, facing southeast, bow twice long, kneeling to read the fifth slip to completion, inviting the four primal initial subtle supreme emperor bright morning Dao Lord, descending the incense seat, conferring the immortal to the subject, to ride the chariot of the fifth luminary among four primal yellow clouds, ascending Jade Purity, paying court to the Nine Heavens.

Next, facing south, bow twice long, kneeling to read the sixth slip to completion, inviting the three primal spirit subtle middle emperor bright morning Dao Lord, descending the incense seat, conferring the immortal to the subject, to ride the chariot of the sixth luminary among three primal green clouds, ascending Jade Purity, paying court to the Nine Heavens.

After inviting the Eight Emperors to finish, return facing north, close eyes and contemplate, envisioning within the chamber eight primal clouds, flourishing and filling the chamber, crowning and surrounding oneself. Knock teeth thirty-six times, raise head and draw in cloud qi twenty-four times and stop. Then recite:

“Auspicious day and good time, eight ways’ qi pure and clear; subtle firmament riding cycles, flowing clouds shining on purple court; primal scenes bright in Great Void, reining swift green carriage; flying roots refining eight rays, imperial blossoms shining soul essence; two images emit wondrous ford, flowing fragrance irrigates Great Darkness; mysterious mother binds highest vows, eight slips present true sincerity; incense rite summons spirits to feast, looking up circling eight primal clouds; spirit descends before dawn ends, quickly the mysterious light pours; with vows to court the Jade Palace, binding chapters in Eastern Splendour; bestowing the eight luminary carriages, primal spirits bearing flying carriages; essence thought and mysterious feeling, may wishes not harm my life.”

Finished, all face north and bow nine times and stop. Further incense rites end here; do not rashly share with others. Practice this twelve times yearly, three years thus, then no more additions.

This Way is most secret, not practiced in the world. All who cultivate numerous scriptures, prepare talismans and swallow qi, yet without offering incense rites at bright morning, the true will not descend, meditation will not ascend and respond, vain toil and bitter meditation, damaging spirit and losing qi, no benefit in seeking immortality. Those who obtain this method, relying on the day and offering incense rites three years, the Nine Heavens rejoice, the Eight Primal rejoice, spirits and perfected respond and descend. After eight years one may ride the carriage and lightly ascend, flying through Great Void. The ancient perfected’s incense rites use golden nectar and jade essence; the world lacks these substances, but precious fruits and fine flavour suffice to move spirits and perfected.

The imperial lord opens goodness, wishes to perform eight slips, precisely to bind to spirit and perfected, hoping to summon spiritual immortals. Now the five sacred mountains’ immortals, and the divine maidens of the sacred land, still taste golden nectar and press jade essence, proclaim great vows, present the eight slips, aspire to the Great Primal, serve the Three Origins, intend the morning sky, uphold Jade Truth, rescue the Seven Patriarchs, enter the Broad Cold—how much less the vulgar and base in the world amid the five impurities! Can they replace without cultivation, hear without practice? Though form and spirit accumulate goodness through generations, if seven generations bear unresolved sins, one also surely has no hope of immortality.

Therefore great vows are necessary, presenting eight slips, offering incense rites and fruit, hoping spirit descends, releasing old roots; only then can the omen body attain immortality, surely becoming one of the upper immortals. There is no previously prepared immortal; engraving names in the upper palace, this writing is not to be seen. Those who obtain the spirit chapters are given twelve jade boys and twelve jade maidens to serve and guard the true spirits, correcting leakages. If one violates the clear prohibition, punished by wind blades, seven ancestors blame, bearing stone crushing mountains, three disciples five sufferings, ten thousand kalpas without pardon; those who receive must be cautious.

All who cultivate the Way of the Eight Primal Essences, practicing the method of the eight slips, always on the days of Spring Commencement and Autumn Commencement, at dawn enter the chamber, face north, knock teeth three times, raise thoughts to the Great Primal Origin Lord, head wearing sun round light precious blossom essence, body robed in cloud light and cloud patterned plain sashes; Primordial Essence Lord, head wearing moon pearl precious light night essence, robed in purple cloud silk plain sash. The two essences jointly ride the purple and green two coloured clouds, flying chariots and jade wheels, twelve phoenixes, following the upper palace jade maidens thirty-six, wandering above Jade Purity, moving northeast. Then eight bows, eight kowtows, eight slaps to cheeks, softly reciting:

“Primordial two spirits, pure qi high and bright; wandering jade chariots, auspicious day of purity; ascending spirit light, shining on my form; connecting my nine origins, descending my eight essences; four meetings intercommunicate, five treasures clouds arise; gaining to ride the first luminary, ascending Jade Court; bowing to Great Primal, receiving immortal plain spirit.”

Finished, raise head and swallow eight times and stop.

On the days of Spring Equinox and Autumn Equinox, at mealtime enter the chamber, facing east, knock teeth three times, raise thought to the Mysterious Primordial Essence Lord, head wearing blue splendour of the year star’s nine qi essence, robed in flying cloud nine transformation plain sash; Elemental Essence Lord, head wearing white light of Venus star precious light essence, robed in flowing light flying cloud plain robe. The two essences jointly ride the mysterious yellow two coloured clouds, flying wheels and feathered canopies, twenty-four phoenixes, following the pure spirit jade maidens thirty-six, wandering within Jade Void, moving southeast. Then four bows, four kowtows, four slaps to cheeks, softly reciting:

“Mysterious Origin two luminaries, high and noble pure spirits; transforming qi disperses spirit, flying and soaring at Golden Gate; purple void reins the chariot, five spirits wing the carriage; wandering the splendid court, illuminating nine clouds; on auspicious days, the heavenly origin displays; myriad celebrations converge; my wish is natural; the Most High flows down, forever preserving plain truth; riding luminaries flying through void, ascending Jade Dawn; bowing to Upper Mystery, receiving transformation of high immortals.”

Finished, swallow eight qi and stop.

On the days of Summer Commencement and Winter Commencement, entering the chamber at mid-position, facing southeast, knock teeth three times, raise thought to the Purple Primordial Essence Lord, head wearing cinnabar star eight ray flowing essence, robed in mysterious yellow nine-coloured plain silk sash; Yellow Primordial Essence Lord, head wearing mysterious morning star five-colour essence, robed in flying cloud seamless plain brocade sash. The two essences jointly ride the purple and cyan two coloured clouds, jade wheels and chariots, nine dragons supporting mystery, following the upper palace jade maidens twenty-four, wandering above Purple Void, moving east. Then two bows, two kowtows, two slaps to cheeks, softly reciting:

“Purple and yellow void spirits, two essences high and true; riding void descending luminaries, whistling winds commanding smoke; roaming and circling Jade Purity, observing Purple Heaven; original celebration auspicious, high saint displays; flowing essence by billions, washing fords by thousands; descending and circling without end, spreading through Nine Profound; bestow me eight luminaries, flying ascending without interval; sharing sun’s brightness, matching moon’s year.”

Finished, swallow eight qi and stop.

On the days of Summer Solstice and Winter Solstice, entering chamber at evening, facing west, knock teeth three times, raise thought to the White Primordial Essence Lord, head wearing yellow primordial ruling star three qi splendid essence, robed in yellow-green shining cloud patterned fur; Flying Essence Primordial Lord, head wearing seven luminaries purple primordial flowing light, robed in seven-coloured cloud gauze plain robe. The two essences jointly ride the cyan rainbow clouds, flying jade purple canopies, twelve flying qilin, following Taihua jade maidens thirty-two, wandering above Cave Clear, moving southwest. Then six bows, six kowtows, six slaps to cheeks, recite:

“Flying luminaries eight primal, white primordial binding essence; mysterious qi intermingling, mingling with Jade Purity; flowing clouds two colours, shining true heaven court; Jade Emperor reins the chariot, supporting purple jade; wandering in cinnabar chambers, eight qi fully bright; turning and crossing heavenly origin, flowing gaze on my form; moving my cloud wheels, descending my flying carriage; gaining equality with eight primal, matching luminaries true spirit.”

Finished, swallow qi eight times and stop.

The eight primal practice true feast luminaries, the Way of meeting in Cloud Capital, the high spirit jade name, passed mouth to mouth, without golden books or green characters, listed in mysterious charts, not to be heard or seen. Those who practice this method, the eight primal go to chambers; after eight years naturally clear the eight palaces, flying through void, riding mystery, roaming Jade Purity.

All who receive the Eight Primal True Scripture, disciples and masters fasting a hundred days or thirty days, bearing eight taels of superior gold, thirty feet each of five coloured silk, one set of ritual robes, swearing the vow of the Nine Heavens’ spirits. Receiving the inner name of the eight primal, twenty-two feet of silk inscription, to declare the oath to the precious true ones. Without this trust, one may not rashly proclaim the eight primal name. Careless leaking of high spirit incurs sevenfold ancestral blame; the receiver undergoes the trial of wind blades, true radiance departs, vainly studying, the true form does not descend. Transmission and reception must be cautious, as in the covenant of the Four Extremities.
