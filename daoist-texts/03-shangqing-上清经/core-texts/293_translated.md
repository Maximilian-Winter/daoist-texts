# The Mysterious Truth: Supreme Eight-Element True Scripture, Instructions on Practice and Meritorious Deeds, and Marvelous Secrets

The Scripture is entitled: The Mysterious Truth, Supreme Eight-Element True Scripture, Instructions on Practice and Meritorious Deeds, and Marvelous Secrets. The author is unknown; it is roughly assigned to the Eastern Jin and Southern Dynasties. Originally it was one among the "Eight-Element True Scriptures," later separated for individual circulation. One scroll. The base edition is from the Zhengyi section of the "Orthodox Taoist Canon."

The Four Perfected of the Supreme Ultimate, inquiring of the Supreme Daoist Lord, said: "We have heard of receiving the Dharma and transmitting the Scripture; the stages of cultivation are known to us. But how does one begin?"

The Daoist Lord answered: "Beginners among you, reverently transcribe the Scripture, prepare a separate chamber and desk, and morning and evening offer incense and lamps to preserve the spirit; at dawn and dusk perform worship of what you have received. The exalted proceed according to circumstances; the methods and rules differ, each laid down in the Scripture, or given by oral transmission, depending on the person. Those who receive instruction but neglect morning worship commit repeated offenses and suffer disgrace, their merits and practices do not flourish. If you earnestly desire to become perfected, do not forget the morning worship. Should circumstances hinder you, and you cannot be constant day and night, yet when the morning dawn is not missed, there will be responses and effects. I again admonish you, to take careful charge of each person." The Perfected prostrated and received the order to observe and carry out.

In all practice of meritorious deeds, closely examine the Scripture and admonitions; receive and hold the essential precepts; commit them to memory with understanding in the heart; carry them out without doubt; without laziness or retreat; diligently renew each day; conform to the teachings of the time; act and conceal according to season. The Scriptures of the Three Caves interpenetrate; they rise and fall mutually; conforming to the course of the world to relieve distress; do not force or violate circumstances; employ high and low according to circumstance; do not suppress or cut off. Circumstances should be up and down; do not abandon or cast away; you must attain the mean; do not close or block and force through. If you force through while blocking above, below, and in the middle, disorder and reversal and opposition will bring disaster and retribution; you must be careful. When the great course is harmonious with the time, ranks proceed in order; on inharmonious days, each receives a lesser portion; depth and shallowness vary; you must not contravene the steps; transcending is dependent on circumstance; cautiously do not oppose the course; with a sincere heart seek truth; strictly observe the precepts.

There are ten precepts of the fast:

1. Do not eat anything containing blood; avoid those with raw qi or smoked and finished kinds; only vegetables not gathered in the growing month may be eaten.

2. At dawn sip gruel; at midday eat; after this, all sweet, rich, and delicious tastes are forbidden. By day burn incense; by night light lamps; the burning of incense should not cease for a moment; sitting, rising, reclining, and resting must not depart from the rules.

3. Abandon all reasons for writing; only the Dao is to be pursued.

4. Reflect upon the Scripture and admonitions; cleanse the heart and diligently advance.

5. Be compassionate and filial to all; pity and lament the poor; open the way of life; exhort the foolish and the people.

6. Repent and confess transgressions; seek and beg for life.

7. Forsake honours and glory; treasure is found in the Dao.

8. Labour the body and suffer the flesh; be driven for the Dao.

9. Wish to remove all pains, the ten sufferings and eight hardships; avoid and transcend calamities of the world; bring peace and plant the seed for the people.

10. Honour the Dao and esteem virtue; let heart and mouth accord; cleanse the heart and diligently advance; aspire to immortal fellowship; receive and observe the Scriptures and precepts; do not dare to transgress; on the day of transcendence be united with the Dao.

The Supreme Instruction says: The Master of the Fast supervises the fast; he recites the Scripture and practices the Dao; he ascends the high seat and reads a thousand characters of the Scripture; when he hears one drink taken, he does not neglect the rule of reciting. This rule is drawn from the "Mid-section of the Four Extremes Bright Instructions."

The Supreme Instruction says: Those who receive the governance of the stars and constellations and accept the Three Treasures Scriptures and Dharma, and the Mysterious Scripture of the Mysterious Truth, after bowing and registering as fasting masters, must all accept the five difficult precepts of the Dharma. Those who do not accept these five precepts may not participate among the recorders of the same fast officials. Moreover, those who have received the true contracts of Three-One or above and have not accepted the five difficult precepts may not be listed in the upper palace, nor may they submit official memorials to the great chapters of the stars and constellations. If one submits memorials without having received them, the Immortal Capital gives no recognition; exposed memorials are not presented. This is because without proper rules and conduct, the person is not pure; hence they are not granted presentation. Furthermore, the officers of the stars and constellations do not accept memorials from masters who have not received the precepts and are unclean. Therefore there are laws of major and minor disciplinary precepts, clearly laid down for acceptance. All fasts have five types of rank as follows:

First, emergency relief and healing the sick, employing the heavenly master's directives and teachings. Entering the Three Origins prescriptions for thanksgiving and life begging, self-binding the forehead with mud, and the methods of smearing charcoal and oil, all are contained within the directives and teachings.

Second, the Nirvanic treasure Brahmanical conduct, gathering worthy ones to transform, the method of cultivating the person and planting blessings; among these are methods for life and death thanksgiving, self-censure, and reflection on faults.

Third, Shangqing celestial seclusion, for the seven generations of deceased ancestors’ migration and ascendancy fast, also practiced monthly according to the proper period, the method of good conduct.

Fourth, True Unity preservation of silence, contemplating the spirit and swallowing the qi, the guiding fast.

Fifth, Taiyi divine elixir, suitable for offerings at furnace fires and golden liquids, the fast of closing chambers for a month. Its particular seclusion and quietude nourish the spirit and continue life; chanting and long fasts are not subject to the five rules.

Moreover, Daoist priests, ritual masters, and male and female officers who have accepted the true contract and the Shangqing Three Caves Scriptures, as well as the governance of stars and constellations, desiring to establish their names in the Mysterious Capital and submit memorials for imperial hearing, must accept the five difficult precepts of the Mysterious Capital. The precepts are as follows:

First precept: Do not fail to respect Heaven; do not say Heaven has no spirit, nor call Earth without ghosts; do not lightly slight the earth spirits, mountains, rivers, and great lakes, nor bore and dig without restraint. This is called denying the spirit of Heaven and Earth, and offenses without dread. Nor teach others to slight Heaven and Earth, saying there are no spirits or ghosts.

Offense of this precept removes three hundred heavenly calculations. Each offense reduces lifespan by seven years; seven years of penance; self-censure and reflection on faults; establish merits and make amends. If exceptional to before, perform three solemn oaths, then restore former position; calculate merits and extend life. The Dao does not fail man.

Second precept: Do not kill living beings, nor probe nests or break eggs. Nor teach others to kill living beings or probe nests and break eggs.

Offense removes one hundred and sixty heavenly calculations. Each offense reduces lifespan by five years; five years penance; self-censure and reflection; establish merit and make amends; purity and goodness to completion. If exceptional to before, perform three solemn oaths and restore former position; calculate merits and extend life. The Dao does not fail man.

Third precept: Do not practice deceit, craftiness, or theft; covetousness and unrestrained evil; plan to take others’ persons, depriving others of their will. Nor teach others to be crafty thieves, covet others’ persons, or deprive others of their loves.

Offense removes one hundred and twenty heavenly calculations. Each offense reduces lifespan by four years; four years penance; self-censure and reflection; accumulate merit and virtue. If exceptional to before, then perform three solemn oaths, restore former position; calculate merits and extend life. The Dao does not fail man.

Fourth precept: Do not drink wine; do not violate others’ wives; engage in improper sexual conduct; use public office for private dealings. Nor teach others to drink wine and enjoy wives; violate others’ children; engage in improper sexual conduct; use public office for private dealings.

Offense removes one hundred and twenty heavenly calculations. Each offense reduces lifespan by four years; four years penance; self-censure and reflection; establish merit and make amends. If exceptional to before, perform three solemn oaths, restore former position; calculate merits and extend life. The Dao does not fail man.

Fifth precept: Do not curse, slander, envy, poison, bear grudges, slander good men, or burn houses. Nor teach others to curse, slander, envy, poison, bear grudges; slander good men; burn houses; destroy households to repay grudges.

Offense removes one hundred and twenty heavenly calculations. Each offense reduces lifespan by three years; three years penance; self-censure and reflection; establish merit and make amends. If merit differs from before, then perform three solemn oaths, restore former position; calculate merits and extend life. The Dao does not fail man.

Those who are Daoists or ritual masters who do not accept the Dharma precepts and are not cautious in their Daoist conduct, violating various laws and taboos, submitting petitions and memorials, hearing themselves not accepted, and failing to obtain rescue and deliverance often, all these are because their Dao has no legal rule; they fall into the tests of wine and meat, a most grievous negligence. Since the Three Saints ascended and transformed, the true rules have been hidden; repeatedly encountering the scorn of Heaven and Earth; the laws and rules have decayed; old memorials do not remain. Even if ritual masters have not received the Dharma precepts, their records are taboo. Recently, memorials have been carefully scrutinized and successively contradicted; Heaven’s officials do not perceive or verify many. Among a hundred, only one proves effective; these are good people who present petitions, deeply moved by the elixir’s goodness; the Heavenly Emperor personally protects, granting what is presented, all dependent on nature and life; merit does not lie in the memorial or ritual master. Yet foolish ignorant masters, sometimes relying on the sincerity of good people’s hearts, taking one such effect as their merit, fear stirring the people, seeking desires not one; not knowing the fault of swallowing and concealing, they have already been reproached, their life and name cut, lifespan reduced, soon to depart. Minor faults are not immediately examined as illness, so they say Heaven and Earth are vast and do not check small omissions. Some have minor merits and defer their examination of faults, the tally lengthening without small re-examination, all their internal faults increase and are in the category of expulsion; after extinction, they will be handed over to the punishments of knife mountains and sword trees. Therefore small re-examinations are not frequent. The foolish do not know, saying that faults are not immediately examined as illness, and that Heaven and Earth permit indulgence. They also say Heaven is vast and does not simplify minor faults, so no examination or reproach. The great, by their exclusive ignorance, extend the day’s faults and reproaches, turning and saying Heaven and Earth have no spirits; those who have precepts are only false show; not knowing they are already in the category of expulsion, suddenly reaching unexpected ends. Heaven is clear and bright; can it be deceived? The foolish and ignorant say the Dao is light; I consider this with pain of heart; clarify and carefully be good; do not be greedy and impure; the guilt is not light.

The Supreme Instruction says: Daoists, ritual masters, men and women who have received the true supreme Dharma, and accepted the upper Dharma treasure Scriptures, the governance of stars and constellations, ranked true one and above, and who have also vowed to accept the true good precepts, must not fail to accept the five difficult precepts and the great precepts of causation. Having received the supreme Dharma, but not accepting these five precepts, their names will not ascend to the Immortal Capital’s elixir tablets; the registers and jade calendars will not record their names; the Three Officials’ white registers and ghost names will not be erased; after extinction, they become lower ghosts; their souls do not become immortals; the examination and trial have no end; disaster falls upon their descendants. Their Daoist folk have other tests of sincerity and safety, not included in this article, recorded in the upper section of the registers.

The Supreme Instruction says: Those who study the Dao should diligently strive, establish merit and make amends, redeem the sins of the seven generations of ancestors, and also advance the immortal names of their family and self, escaping from the ten sufferings and eight hardships. They should accept the five difficult precepts, establish merit and virtue, seek the upper immortal name in the Immortal Capital jade calendar, erase the Three Officials’ white registers of death, and remove ghost names. You disciples of the Dao, having received the great internal and external true contracts over many years, but whose conduct does not accord with nature, and who do not accept the five difficult precepts, have bodies defiled by wine and meat, your Daoist conduct is without law; hence you commit faults and sins, lose calculations and reduce life; death leads to lower ghosts, unable to escape the punishments of knife mountains and sword trees, the cruel heart of the underworld; for this I grieve deeply. You, disciples of the Dao, should understand the precepts and rules, observe them without weariness for three years, thereby gaining extended years; Heaven’s assigned calculations increase and multiply. The Heavenly officials examine the registers thrice yearly, calculating merit and increase, reporting to the life office, distinguishing good and evil; merits are recorded on the left contract, offenses and unredeemed on the right contract; matters are clear. The Dao does not fail man, but few believe the truth; many violate laws and precepts; hence suffer guilt and fault. Clarify and be cautious; be cautious to do good.

All Daoists, ritual masters, men and women officers who have received the true Dharma and seek immortal transcendence, to prolong life and carry out precepts, establish merit and make amends, heal the people, and submit memorials to the imperial court, should do so by cultivating fasts and being upright, accepting the Dharma precepts, not violating the rules, offering petitions according to wishes, calculating merits and transcendence, with rank and longevity not harmed.

The Supreme Instruction says: Those born from noble lineage, though not accepting these precepts in writing, if their conduct accords with nature, need not again accept the disciplinary precepts. From ancient times to now many such persons exist, but nowadays only one in a hundred, and they cannot be taken as examples. What is essential is to mark their virtue and conduct as in accord with the disciplinary precepts; those not of resolute and outstanding character must accept disciplinary precepts to achieve the life Dao; thus it is necessary to announce the precepts and establish rules.

The Supreme Instruction says: Anyone who desires to study the Dao and seek truth, to establish merit and virtue in the world, to register a name in Heaven, and ascend to the immortal officials, should accept the five difficult precepts, observe the precepts and practice the Dao for three years, once merit is established with a true name, then submit to the Immortal Capital, register on the elixir tablets, inscribed in the jade calendar, immortal register named; the life office issues orders to the Five Sacred Mountains, reports to the Three Officials below, records known Perfected, erases the Three Officials’ death registers and white registers, removes ghost names; then one can rightly become a practicing Daoist, ritual master. Such true names are diligently kept in the Immortal Capital; what is presented is all thoroughly received. Those who neither accept precepts nor diligently apply themselves have no merit or name in the Immortal Capital; their memorials and petitions are all stopped; their practice of the Dao is unheard of, merely wasting the people’s reverence and expenses on paper, ink, incense, and oil; moreover, they suffer the tests of swallowing and concealing wine and meat; their souls and spirits are often summoned to trial; all is disadvantageous. Some violate the law but are not immediately tried; some have no death registers in the Three Officials’ registers; some have existing grudges; the examiners confuse their minds; offenses accumulate; hence no small reexaminations; they soon fill their internal faults and enter the category of expulsion and premature death in the world, not completing three lifespans; offenses are many; suffer the punishments of knife mountains and fiery pits; death as lower ghosts, long suffering torment; can this not be called grievous? Grievous indeed. Beginning Daoists, ritual masters, men and women officers, desiring to cultivate life and purify, diligently seek truth, and establish ghost control and healing to evidence efficacy, and to be esteemed by the people, shall accept the five difficult precepts. Having accepted the precepts, the Immortal Capital will register their name; cultivate diligently for three years; not violate the rules; the life office lists and submits to the Heavenly Emperor; registers the name in the jade calendar; then they receive the scattered titles of the Perfected; able to control ghosts and heal disease, with all effects clear. Such goodness, can it be not cultivated?

Daoists, ritual masters, male and female officers desiring to practice and learn ghost control and healing shall accept the Supreme Taiyi Middle Platform Life-Establishing Five Precepts. Having accepted these precepts, their position in the Immortal Capital is fixed; recorded on elixir tablets; merits diligently accumulated for three years; names inscribed in the upper register of the jade calendar. The Heavenly Emperor’s officers examine the merit and diligence; inscribe in the registers of the Five Sacred Mountains, Four Rivers, and Three Officials; know your diligent and accumulated efficacious merit; your names are honoured by the Mysterious Capital’s heavenly spirits and earth deities; all ghosts submit; rescue and healing memorials reach the court. Those who only receive the inner and outer great affairs and the subtle true one but do not accept the five difficult precepts and are not cautious in observance have no place in the Immortal Capital; no name in the jade calendar; bear the sins of ritual masters’ concealment of filth; the Five Sacred Mountains, Four Rivers, and Three Officials’ ghosts and spirits do not respect them; memorials are neglected and not presented; because of their fondness for roaming the streets, greed, impurity, disgrace, ignorance of reform, violation of rules and taboos, the life office corrects and reproves, reducing and removing lifespan. Being teachers of men, violating small rules is not often examined; if they repent, offenses are compounded and judged heavily. Nowadays the ignorant say that faults are not immediately examined as illness, saying Heaven and Earth do not know the sins; also say no spirits, not knowing the shadow examination has already reported. With existing grudges and small offenses, therefore not often reported, intending to accumulate their internal faults, all according to the expulsion category. Thus death and name are fixed; no further small reexaminations; suddenly subjected to great removal; premature death in the world; not completing three lifespans; offenses heavy; further punished by knife mountains and fiery pits; death as lower ghosts; long suffering torment; can this be spoken of? You who receive the truth, desiring to establish merit and rescue and heal; wishing to practice qi of the Three Origins and nourish spirit and prolong life; should seek out bright masters, observe the Dharma precepts; do not be greedy for wine and meat; do not indulge in disorderly pursuit; whether great or small, all are reproved. Only by morning and evening fasting and uprightness, accumulating merit and making amends, may you hope for mysterious grace, suspension of examinations and prolongation of years. Thus prolonging life, restoring calculations, renewing beginnings, merits and faults compensating, detailed with no omission. You all clearly be cautious; be cautious and cultivate diligently, preserving long-lasting immortality.

The Supreme Instruction says: Daoists, ritual masters, male and female officers, desiring to cultivate and refine the Taiqing divine elixir, and to practice the arts of the Three Origins female and male, meditating upon the mountains and marshes, contemplating immortality and nourishing will, must first receive the Life-Establishing Five Precepts. Furthermore, undergo the seven trials and nine refineries; break and endure weakness; be insulted and not bear resentment or shame; not entertain external thoughts or evil minds; calm the spirit and focus single-mindedly; endure hunger and cold; accept insult without anger or decline; accumulate diligence and establish wide merit; relieve and save the urgent; rescue and save life; receive the beginning of rebirth; eat sparingly and bitterly; widely manifest secret virtue; before Heaven repays merit, do not hope for reward; deeds and righteousness deeply felt; the great accumulation of diligence; body weak and worn; near and far without distinction; dare not mourn oneself; widely spread benefit; again suffer slander and insult; not taking these as harm—these are the five virtues. Without a dark heart and firm love, one cannot establish this conduct. Therefore, there are five titles of virtue; their utmost and most weighty.

Studying the Dao for many years, enduring tenfold vexations and ninefold insults, filth and evils heaped upon one, yet still cherishing steadfast patience and weakness—this is one wisdom.

Strongly acting broadly, loving both inner and outer, guiding and nourishing the Three Origins, the Five Spirits unharmed, advancing without decline, complexion not withered—this is constancy; this is the second wisdom.

Esteeming cultivation without retreat, circulating the eight directions, one pure and one turbid, one sinking and one floating, diligently working in the world, without record or name, accumulating virtue endlessly, yet daring to call it labour—this is the third wisdom.

Secretly conjoining medicinal qi, containing virtue and nourishing nature, turning and transforming for nine years, at the middle twenty-four years, at the upper thirty-two years; accumulating bitterness and diligent effect, suffering many twists and turns, pitying and considering without measure, calm and peaceful in self-possession, always without merit to record, yet still with sorrowful concern—this is the fourth wisdom.

For Dao, having no worldly merit to match, little practice of master’s teaching, depending on master’s gate, yet amid misfortune and plots, dissipated and ruined the true; enduring tenfold vexations and myriad patience; still cherishing nurturing and gentle weakness—this is the fifth wisdom.

The Supreme Instruction says: All men who learn the Dao, guard the heart true and one, perform good deeds earnestly, yet do not awaken, and undergo seven trials and nine vexations, with heart without anger or retreat, observe the five precepts, harmonizing with the five wisdoms, not violating precepts, not failing Scriptures and teachings, quiet and peaceful, acting in accord with non-action, long stained by dust and wind, ignoring insults, encountering misfortune, begging forgiveness, repeatedly suffering hardship, not becoming angry, but still bestowing benefit and self-joy, distributing alms to others, ever fearing loss of previous merits and diligence, fearing that past roots are deep and heavy and bring no benefit—having this lofty virtue and great merit, it is not called labour; pure and bitter elixirs, all the more firm and respectful, fearing to fall into abyss and valley, if not in the morning then in the evening—such wisdom is truly great and abundant. Such virtue and conduct can indeed establish the Dao and practice; practice it for five years, calmly without desire; one may retire to forest seclusion, entrust life to rocks and wilds. You who seek the Dao and cultivate life and prolong life among men, should first dwell in a humble chamber, harmonize spirit and nourish will, guide and practice the Three Origins, accumulate diligence single-mindedly; above, be moved by the spiritual truth; if afflicted by disaster, do not seek to plead; endure insults and misfortune, glad and joyful, not regarding it as wrong. Practice these five precepts, accomplishing the five wisdoms of life; Daoist conduct pure and clean; able to bear the great burden of merit; dare not hope for reward; but instead be more courageous and diligent; constantly beyond what was before; merits accumulated, what is there that is not obtained? What wish is not fulfilled? What request is not heard? What will is not accomplished?

The Supreme Instruction says: Immortals have nine grades; arts consist of thirty-six gates; and there are one hundred and twenty forbidden laws, all essentials for prolonging life. There has never been any who, following the rules, seeks aspiration and suffers hardship yet fails. The sole worry is that men cultivate without diligence, think of the Dao but not earnestly, hold no constancy, and have no united mind or matched pledges; how can the Dao be cultivated? Only hearing morning offerings and evening hopes, lightly neglecting orthodox teachings, saying there is no spiritual response; often greedy, covetous, quarrelsome, insulted; indulging in wine and meat seats; without aspiration or diligent pain towards the Mysterious Origin; doing things confusedly; sins piled in the heavenly treasury; soul and thought blocked and struck; examined harshly in hell; not yet having been judged or parsed; therefore should deeply reflect and reform oneself, diligently exercise virtue with single-heartedness, seeking the effect of true enlightenment. The wise, hearing and acting on this, observing and carefully keeping the five precepts, is not this marvelous?

The minor fast ritual: the host offers one worthy person; one person for one day pays one hundred cash; rice, vegetables, tea, fruit, honey, ginger and the like.

The middle fast: offering a thousand meals; one person for one day pays two hundred cash; rice, vegetables, incense, flowers, lamps, candles, tea, fruit, honey, ginger and the like.

For the two foregoing, count persons and invite fasting officials; people generally increase them.

Another rule: for those sick or in distress who pray and request a fast, the vegetable diet is as in the minor fast method.

The Nirvanic treasure longevity fast: a thousand meals according to the host’s offering; only not to kill or violate rules.

Shangqing scripture-turning, pure and silent mountains and forests long fast: rice and vegetables, clothing and food are vegetable diet as constant; not counted in cash.

The foregoing five are of such ranks.

Taiyi closing chamber, abstaining from elixirs for one hundred days great fast: not counted in cash. In ancient times, oaths were made by gold and colored belongings; now replaced by forty feet of cinnabar and a pair of golden rings.
