### The True Scripture of the Jade Essence Secret Formula of the Supreme Taoist of the Ninefold Purity

The Ninefold Purity Jade Essence Secret Formula

The Elder of the Nine Heavens and the Jade Youth of the Three Heavens, at the auspicious day of the Heavenly Jia in the first year of the Primordial Beginning, with the North Branch added and the axis adjusted, the Three Primes in harmony, the Nine Emperors returning to the True, ascending high to the Jade Pavilion of the Supreme, the Heaven of Purple Emptiness; with the Ninefold Purity secret words, unlocking the Spirit Pass, the Jade Essence secret formula, regulating fate and lasting long, opening inquiry far and wide, clear, smooth, and desolate; the jade tone elegant and ethereal, the jade sound drifting to the skies; the fragrant wind stirring the void, the wisdom chant reaching afar; the fragrance flows deep within the nape, the Qi crowns the divine tempest, the jade inspection universally governs; myriad immortals come to pay homage. This is the wondrous transformation of the ancient mystery, enduring ten thousand kalpas without decay, the true formula composed as a legacy for those who would observe and strive earnestly. If one be called Golden named East Flower, Green character Purple Court, who receives this wondrous text, will ascend to Jade Clarity; the Three Passes open the mechanism, the Nine Gates receive the spirit; the countenance attains golden radiance, the five viscera flourish; the Golden True is moved and unbound, revealing the cavern bright; the divine candle secretly shines, the precious light born at night; flowing gold intermingles and scatters, shining and falling like fire bells; whistling the life command, one immediately arrives; driving the divine troops; the Three Primes reach the chamber, descending the Green Palanquin; riding the void and directing the empty, soaring up to Supreme Clarity.

The Supreme Minister Qing Tong Lord said: The Ninefold Purity secret words arise from the commands and spells of the Nine Emperors and Three Primes; regulating Qi and stabilizing the years, opening and unbinding the Spirit Pass, the Five Viscera flourish with splendour. If thou hast jade bones and dost see this text, secretly declare and solemnly swear, swearing to the Nine Heavens to cultivate the Way in secret. Be cautious not to indiscriminately proclaim it; to reveal it to unworthy men would bring harm upon thy body, not only by the wind blade but reaching the Seven Mysteries. Be clear and cautious in the heavenly rules; to seek the true Way, if unremitting for nine years, thou canst obtain the Superior Immortal.

The formula was transmitted by the Elder of the Nine Heavens and the Jade Youth of the Three Heavens, concurrently conveyed by the Grand Emperor Lord, the Heavenly Emperor Lord, and the Grand Micro Heavenly Emperor Lord. The Grand Emperor Lord transmitted to the Northern Pole Supreme Prime Lord; the Heavenly Emperor Lord transmitted to the Queen Mother of the West; the Grand Micro Heavenly Emperor Lord transmitted to the Golden Palace Sage Lord; the Golden Palace Sage Lord transmitted to the Supreme Minister Qing Tong Lord; Qing Tong Lord transmitted to the Western City Lord, thus entrusted to later disciples to become true men. Inheriting the true aspect and lineage, the Qi connected to the Imperial Scroll; the Lord has already passed through more than seven thousand kalpas. The Lord was later enfeoffed as Spirit Script at the Western Cave of Mount Wangwu in the Jade Chamber, attended by Spirit Officers who oversee incense rites and texts. Its Way is secret and wondrous, not to be spread in the world; should a mystic name chance upon this text, myriad immortals come to court, heavenly officials guard the body, diligent in practice and earnest in thought, ascending at dawn.

All who receive the Supreme Clarity Taoist Three Treasures wondrous chapters, advancing the Way of stepping into the void and ascending the mysterious, yet do not first open the Five Viscera, unlock the hidden passes, the myriad Qi will not consolidate, the true spirit will not rejoice, and their diligent efforts will be vain, and immortality unattained. Now this Jade Formula is composed, the wondrous words of the Supreme Emperor to transmit to later disciples; keep it secret and revere the truth; be cautious not to lightly transmit it, lest harm come upon thy body.
