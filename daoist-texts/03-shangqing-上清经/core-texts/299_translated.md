### The Hidden Scripture of the Supreme True Spirit Tiger

The Supreme Great Dao Lord, from Himself, struck the shimmering Dragon Cloud Bell, the sound of the firmament escaping a thousand times, myriad echoes entwined and stirring, the flowing brilliance flourishing vigorously, purple mists returning to shade, the mysterious wind issuing eightfold. At this, the jade phoenix extended its neck, the golden luan ordered its qi, the dragon roared upon the blue waves, the tiger leapt in the jade isles, nine cries harmonized in chant, the mysterious sovereign of the caverns and heavens, subdued beasts rolling up their sleeves, fierce horses opened their throats, the fierce mountain blocked the way, biting the sword and seizing the evil, myriad voices in confusion, a hundred demons in wild disorder. Then he commanded the jade-pure upper palace attendants, An Fa Ying, Tian Sifei, Zhao Dingzhu, Li Yunmen, to combine their songs and wave the spirit poems, to extinguish the essence and scatter the spirits with their melodies; their words ran thus:

Long ago, I traversed the reins of the Great Rosy Clouds, the Eight Floating Ones forging the cloud camp. The divine ancestry managed the spiritual bosom, the dragon brush adorned the jade capital.

The Golden Gate entwined luxuriantly, the Nine Chambers shone with purple jade. High in carriage, I crossed the Northern Origin, the desolate reaching into Non-Being.

The Red Tiger guided the spiritual masters, the green chariot ascended the Supreme Purity. The Four Mysteries brightened the morning prohibition, embracing the flower returning to the Phoenix City.

The Seven Calamities still cling to the pure ties, intent on marking the Nine Origins’ thoroughfare. Declaring and shining the precious Great Radiance, the swift wind leaps to display the scenery.

Orderly controlling, opening the pure homeland, the river spirits have gone before. Yin clouds bear the night sun, lighting moon suddenly crossing the first.

Binding the bright Red Birth Spirit, leading and returning to Non-Being. Ten thousand sources paint the northern valley, riding the void returning as a falling star.

Extinguishing the scene, lifting to float and wander, lofty peaks rise from the sky’s waves. Lingering, excellent music lodges, subtle and fine, reaching towards the void.

The secluded dwelling holds cinnabar and mysterious pearls, the Great Void Dao flows unimpeded. Darkness and light grasp the spirit talisman, secretly advancing—how could it err or fail?

Falling into the mystic shows, congregating the assemblies, life’s beginning seems like a long dream. Virtue concealed, void within marks its traces, utmost stillness, unaware of fitting place.

The spiritual essence moves the Great Element, smoke reflects where it dwells. The mysterious sound performs beyond form, how can the subtle thread be doubted?

In accord with the morning drum’s long fan, the shining rosy clouds arise here. Absolute cavernous vast flowing, wings soar on six commanding platforms.

The Spirit King enters the Jade Void, approaching nothing, unviolated by the red troops. Nine nets encounter the dark vastness, wondrous meetings have already been pacified.

The Daoist Canon’s Golden Extreme Chapter, plucking and tuning with radiant cypress glory. A thousand dragons spit green water, nine rivers overturn, exhausted and pouring.

Vast mists engulf the ultimate dwelling, spirit waves cover the four courts. Heads aligned under lofty silken hall, none inspect form or name.

Leaders uproot and receive harmony and excellence, unbound mysteries grasp the transforming principle. Containing essence, scorching the cloud chambers, desolate and pure, clearing the zeroed record.

Spirit Dao hastens to the orchid gate, mysterious indeed, what arises in array? Ten thousand peaks flatten strange sights, above the clouds are jade children.

At the final kalpa, harmonizing jade splendour, unawares the square sun begins. Original spirits unite in cavernous transformation, sinking and yielding, forgetting fixed orders.

The River Marquis forms the upper observatory, scene pearls and jade halls. Governing origin, three spirits displayed, condensing and clarifying, how could it lack fullness?

The sun joins repeated yin, revolving and brushing, preserving fallen darkness. Entirely entrusted beyond the six senses, spiritual songs unite in one voice.

Operating the heavenly path of the revolving Han, resplendent moving the jade gems. Ten thousand spirits mount the red horse, a thousand demons lack leisure to grow.

Demons are destroyed by water and fire officials, the True Form preserves the Great Purity.

The Four Destinies of the northern heights, governing spirit with fixed reins, calling upon the earth deities, earth essences hiding their qi, mountains and peaks hiding clouds, nine sources utterly extinguished, testing and checking a thousand essences, wielding severing thunder’s shock, the Northern Emperor opens the way, the Four Bright Ones bear the chariot, shattering and burning myriad evils, binding and cutting Feng Mountain, nine ghosts united as one, a thousand demons sharing one body, the Five Emperors grasping their halberds, the spirit lord spitting smoke, purple light towering observatory, red qi twisting and entwined, spirit running through the night terrace, essence concealed in long threads, poisonous beasts reaching ten thousand feet, those slain have no kin; what small demons are there? Gathered in hundreds and piled in thousands, exchanging qi in perfect view; when the gate of life opens, the spirit tiger displays its majesty, slaying and seizing the hawks and remnants, the Supreme Origin’s wondrous path, the utmost spirit’s appointed place. You now receive it, to wear forever upon your person, ten thousand trials fail to affect it, a thousand demons cannot harm it, the jade splendour reaches the chamber, heaven’s truth roams and circles, reciting bright spiritual sounds, ascending the court of the Three Origins.

When the song was finished, the Supreme Great Dao Lord commanded the Left Mysterious Jade Gentleman Yu Li Xuan, to wield the golden feathered baton, and summon the Supreme Subtle Heaven Emperor. The Supreme Subtle Heaven Emperor condensed and transformed essence qi, controlled true glory and void, roared and bellowed over myriad spirits, gathered and bound the primal origin, holding the golden truth in hand, serene and vast as the Great Nothing, suddenly heard the command, proceeded to ascend the appointed carriage, feathered spirit crimson emperor, opened the path and carriage armor, ten thousand heavenly tigers drove out the golden dragon, commanded the troops with jade baton, cast the scene flying splendour, entered the dark flowing candle, shining array moved and opened, the sun’s essence struck the blue drum’s side waves, struck the jade bell’s boom boom. Then the Mysterious Sovereign united in harmony, broad music halting the rear, the nine phoenixes extended their necks and cried, a hundred dragons bore the rhythm and blew together, golden essence leapt in sound, entering the luan’s soaring dance, purple banners raised to the sky, brocade banners encircled the wilderness, green canopies arrayed in shade, the winding morning suddenly raised, flowing bells tossed in exchange, moonlight thoroughly resonant, jade rod showing the truth, returning still to the five images, fragrant flowers scattering smoke, splendid blossoms of the triple scene, light clouds carrying brilliance, thin mists bearing light, bridles sounded seven ways, eight carriages floated in the void, the empty carriage nine thousand, guarded by poisonous dragons, running clouds hastening to the mysterious, gathering qi capturing the wind, the dawn bright and flourishing, eight lights veiled in obscurity, true maidens riding on the right, left commanding the spirit boy, swiftly countless billions, already arriving at the upper palace, halted their carriage at Jade Purity, body rose at the imperial wall, turning back to the purple gate, bowed head awaiting passage. After a long time, the Great Central Dao commanded the morning attendants to gently lead forward, ascend the bud pearl gate, enter the seven-reflection inner chamber. The Supreme Subtle Heaven Emperor proclaimed his name, saying: 'Your humble servant now arrives, please open the great command.'

The Supreme Great Dao Lord said: Li Shanyuan’s virtue accords with the Seven Sages, as lord of the Golden Gate, now about to visit the Ten Heavens, governing the destiny of myriad beings, establishing the Central Origin in deep mystery, regulating yin and yang to align the heads, drawing out truth and raising the leader, sealing the rivers and summoning the seas, deciding death and life, wielding heavenly might, beheading the six heavens, summing punishments of the Three Officials, punishments imposed by the Northern Emperor. The noble lord attends the chariot, the Dao is lofty and elevated, his virtue vast and distant, his office also weighty, his charge well matched. Having explained him by wisdom, also recalling him by demon dispelling, wisdom may drive spirits, demon dispelling may destroy evil. Furthermore, granting him the Spirit Tiger’s true talisman, to wield power over the six heavens, chanting the high poem of waving spirits, also aiding to scatter filth and remove calamities. Moreover, the Supreme Subtle Emperor treasures a Golden Tiger true talisman, to command the gods and spirits of heaven and earth; ordering it to act, it can shatter and sever a thousand essences; wearing it on the way, ten thousand ghosts vanish their forms, multitudinous demons falsely invade and instantly die, the host of demons who spy it fall into darkness. Thus may it all be granted to Shanyuan, to fulfill his charge.

Then the Supreme Subtle Emperor reverently bowed, unbound the cloud chest, opened the jade box, seven lights reflected on white, flowing sun opened the truth, nine glories ceased shining, flying fragrance intertwined. Holding the talisman but not yet granting it, personally commanded the Supreme Subtle palace maids Ji Linhua, Yan Caiyun, Zhu Tiaoyan, Han Fangyao, and others to combine song of golden truth, stepping the void’s melody. Their words ran thus:

Great Darkness severs the Four Mysteries, the cavernous scene entrusts divine powers. Jade terrace spreads the red firmament, green mists hold golden ramparts.

Above draws cloud pearl collar, looking up to grant the Blade-less Peak. The spirit mirror fears the purple hall, misty red radiance in the mid void.

Dark transformation entwines the mysterious root, grasping the baton carrying the purple boy. Round path without condensation or desolation, splendid mist again has weight.

Southward pushing the Red Mound Gate, westward crossing the bold window gap. Body agile over myriad ford waves, spirit born to seize the ten directions.

Mystery returns, reversing the silent chariot, upward mounting the heavenly dragon. Darkly lifting the flying scenic carriage, waving bells, seven ways wandering.

Light waves cloud dust ford, suddenly arrived at Jade State. Left seizes jade shining wife, right commands golden true husband.

Above connects flying firmament’s awakening, downward granting spiritual wondrous fields. All entwined in the vast cold cosmos, unfolding brocade entering the divine hill.

Phoenix brain firmly in kalpa’s age, nectar of blossoms turning to decay. Supreme Great truly long-lived, regulating destiny’s myriad divisions.

Three awakenings bear the mysterious numbers, releasing joy, dazzling tooth’s return. Whirlwind shining, halting the floating splendor; purple cassia where does it rest?

Jade fruit rings the nine firmaments, jade baton summons the Supreme Subtle. Yellow rods restrain virtue’s blade, how could it affect the true man’s radiance?

Abandoning purity entering no substance, a hundred images begin to all be left behind. Opening the yang cinnabar qi tip, dazzling red clouds fly.

Equally conforming, jade shining still, dazzling hanging above the Pure Region. Spirits respond to dark numbers, following feeling calling signs of the world.

Vast ford waves flourish in confusion, joining scenes, partaking of the lineage. Lofty golden gate child, desolate entering spirit’s boundary.

Looking down and up, myriad transformations, will follow the same essence and conform. Mysterious dwelling severed silent platform, clear chanting wisdom and intelligence.

Dispelling demons reducing myriad sharp edges, waving poems to chase out filth. Golden Tiger bears heavenly might, crushing spirits to conceal qi.

Sweeping demons ten thousand fold, ten thousand li evil dust.

Here the great god cuts the blood of a hundred essences, blinded the Golden Tiger, raging fiercely to spit majesty, releasing poison to cast ghosts, unceasingly crossing, gutting the six heavens, united head spirits, suddenly closing dark beasts, hiding sounds in forest and grass, lying down the Supreme Origin.

Wondrous and rare the spiritual text, mysterious and dense to wear it, and thus advancing to court the Jade Emperor, bowing in the chamber, all the true ones come to his room. If leaked the Spirit Tiger text, disaster strikes the nine ancestral clans; if divulged the Golden Tiger true talisman, calamity reaches the seven forefathers. Shanyuan guards it, the hero of Dao and virtue. In the fearful night, just reciting these two poems, ten thousand essences scatter and hide, as if lodging with ten thousand men; mountains and rivers hearing these chants all take up whips and face the sound, bowing in reverence.

Afterward a poem appeared, written down by the Nine Blossoms An Consort. On the sixth day of the eleventh month, at the first five drumbeats before dawn, the Purple Purity Nine Blossoms An Consort came to confer this, commanding to write; before dawn it was completed. It is contained within the Supreme Great Eight Techniques Wisdom Demon-Dispelling Spirit Tiger Hidden Scripture scroll.
