### The Scripture of the Mysterious Transformations of the Purple Degree Fiery Radiance of the Most High Dongzhen

Preface to the Purple Degree Fiery Radiance

The Purple Degree Fiery Radiance is not a text written by the Purple Degree Fiery Radiance itself; it is a divine scripture formed by the condensation of qi from the void, mysterious radiance blazing forth, accumulated over seven thousand years, whence its text appears. The Sovereign of the Supreme Subtle Heaven arranged its title with purple orchids, inscribed its main text on golden slips, and recorded it as "The Scripture of the Mysterious Transformations of the Purple Degree Fiery Radiance." The name "Mysterious Transformations" derives from transformation within the mystery. Once the mysterious text was established, the Most High Jade Emperor commanded Golden Morning Jade Boy and Western Flower Jade Maiden, each with three thousand attendants, to serve at the sides of the text, guarding it within the purple chamber of the Most High Sixfold Harmony. The Lord of the Southern Pole presides.

Record of the Sovereign of Supreme Subtle Heaven

The Sovereign of Supreme Subtle Heaven was born at the beginning of the First Azure, the spirit shining through the mystery, before the condensation of qi, forming the pattern and form of the flowing fragrance. Light connects and illuminates the spirit, purple clouds shine with lightning, mysterious smoke flows and drifts, red radiance entwines, wondrous awareness is secretly awakened. He also gathered the supreme contract, arranged the pure and harmonious, inhaled and exhaled the dark stream, thus descending as the embryo of spiritual birth, nourishing with the fountain of the law and spiral ganoderma. At the age of two sevens (fourteen), his golden countenance shines within, jade splendour reflects without; he is penetratingly wise and divinely intelligent, clearly seeing the void mystery. He compiles and masters the imperial titles, his office being amid the clear flows of the nine heavens' mists, flying and looking towards the source of pure mystery, perceiving the pivot in the utmost mystery, mustering and directing countless spirits, accumulating feeling and joining the dark assemblies, wondrously awakening and inspiring by nature. Thus he attained the method of commanding the Purple Degree Fiery Radiance to return the spirit, flying to the heavens and ascending the void; his practice and inner response ascend to the Most High Jade Purity; the Way is entrusted to the Central Yellow Lord Lao.

The Queen Mother of the West Composed Three Hymns upon Bestowing the Scripture

Howl and sing on the Nine Mysterious Terraces, cliffs and ridges congeal in chilliness. The heart is upright; the six senses awake; the eyes clear, casting away worldly dregs. Flowing mists shine on the Golden Chamber; the empty hall diffuses mysterious fragrance. Accumulated feeling brings the spirit down; the single form also divides in flight. In an instant glimpsing myriad kalpas, how can one perceive the cycle of myriad ages?

The lovely garden flourishes the divine steps; vermilion jade and splendid gems adorn the court. Flowing wind scatters through the empty void; jade sounds ride on the brightness of emptiness. Purple smoke entwines the spiral characters; red radiance reflects the green canopy. Flying banners hang over mysterious canopies; feather joints blaze with purple clarity. Ascend to the scene at the edge of the nine heavens; roam and play in the Phoenix City. May I receive the honour of the realm, one joy arising with the morning birth.

Rein up and control the mysterious radiance; the evening scene is beyond the wilds. Roam and seek the spiritual person; unite the form and rejoice at the heavenly border. Hands part the vermilion gates; eyes are like divine surging peace. The Golden Palace rises in rugged majesty; the clear scene is free from dust and filth. Loosen the collar at the mysterious Lang Terrace; it suits my good wish to meet. Remove sandals, three times difficult; preserve and refine firmly in old age.

The Inner Method of the Purple Degree Fiery Radiance: Contemplating the Invoking Void to View the Heavenly Methods

At the beginning of forming his form, the Sovereign also studied the Way of Invoking the True; contemplating afar and looking deeply inward, sitting to observe the boundless, penetrating thoughts into the seclusion of the void. At the age of three, in the center, he carefully examined and rectified; the true spirit shone forth; foreknew what had not yet come to pass; thoroughly viewed the boundaries of the highest heaven; no hidden place not mirrored; no highest point unconnected; no lowest place unlooked upon. Thus he received the title of Great Sovereign, descended by accumulated feeling, not born to rely on chance.

Often at dawn, before the light of heaven dawns, when the clear brilliance begins to issue forth, he rubs his hands together to make warmth, wipes his eyes and the four corners thrice and seven times, knocks his teeth twenty-four times fully, with tongue rinses the inside of the mouth all around, causing the elixir to arise, swallowing the liquid nine times. Then he covers himself with a connected cap, lies still, causing the center to be carefully rectified. He causes inner and outer to be silent, hearing no sound; hands cover the ears; eyes close, inwardly preserving; he sees the eastward ninety thousand li away, mountains, rivers, grasses, trees, birds, beasts, and the old Hu tribes as if before him. He causes clear rectification; does not fix nor again preserve; after a long time naturally the vision appears. Having become distinct, he hears in his ears the sound of bells and drums ringing; after a long while he again sees the immortal official of the Eastern Peak, riding a blue dragon and blue mist, holding five ganoderma, accompanied by twelve jade maidens, wearing flying skirts of blue feathers, bearing the blue essence jade embryo, held in a golden basket, bestowed upon my person. Having seen the immortal official, he feels respect and receives it, immediately wearing it, tasting its sweetness; then wipes his eyes, swallows qi nine times and stops. Thus for three years, his eyes see ten thousand li afar; his ears hear ten thousand li of sound; all is clear and bright; foreknows the coming of good and ill; calculates the length of years and omens; his body emits strange radiance; his vision penetrates the external and internal. The Way of Invoking the Void is most wondrous; it is transmitted mouth to mouth, not formed in writing.

Next he returns to contemplate as before, inwardly seeing the south ninety thousand li away, mountains, rivers, grasses, trees, soil colours, birds, beasts, and the old Yue tribes as before; as if before his eyes, causing clear rectification; not fixed nor again preserved; after a long time naturally the vision appears. Having become distinct, he hears in his ears the multitude of sounds in tumult; after a long time he again sees the immortal official of the Southern Peak, riding a flying dragon with cloud canopy, holding a splendid banner, accompanied by twelve jade maidens, wearing flying skirts of blue brocade, bearing the dark thread and red seed, held in a golden basket, bestowed upon my person. Having seen the immortal official, he feels respect and receives it, immediately wearing it, tasting its sourness; then wipes his eyes, swallows qi nine times and stops. Thus for three years, he naturally penetrates the mystery of the void, his eyes see ten thousand li afar, ears hear ten thousand li of sound; after a long time all is clear and bright; foreknows the coming of good and ill; his body produces jade dew; his face shines with jade light. The Way of Invoking the Void. [Text missing]

Next again contemplates as before, inwardly seeing the west ninety thousand li away, mountains, soil colour, grasses, trees, birds, beasts, and the old Xuan tribes as before; as if before his eyes, causing clear rectification; not fixed nor again preserved; after a long time naturally the vision appears. Having become distinct, he hears clearly in the ears the sound of golden drums ringing; after a long while he again sees the immortal official of the Western Peak, riding a pure mist flying chariot, holding golden liquid and cinnabar essence, accompanied by twelve jade maidens, wearing flying skirts of dark brocade, bearing golden mixture. Having seen the immortal official, he feels respect and receives it, immediately wearing it, tasting its sweetness; then wipes his eyes, swallows qi nine times and stops. Thus for three years, his eyes see thoroughly, examining countless myriad li afar; good and ill, calamity and fortune are clear and bright before their arrival; his face shines with golden light. The Way of Invoking the Void; its method cannot be conveyed in writing, only told mouth to mouth.

Next contemplates as before, inwardly seeing the north ninety thousand li away, mountains, soil colour, grasses, trees, birds, beasts, and the old Qiang tribes as before; as if before his eyes, causing clear rectification; not fixed nor again preserved; after a long time naturally the vision appears. Having become distinct, he hears in his ears the sound of bell and bronze ringing clearly; after a long while he again sees the immortal official of the Northern Peak, riding a dark cloud flying canopy, holding five ganoderma, accompanied by twelve jade maidens, wearing flying skirts of dark brocade, bearing refined jade liquid, held in a golden basket, bestowed upon my person. Having seen the immortal official, he feels respect and receives it, immediately wearing it, tasting its bitterness; then wipes his eyes, swallows qi nine times and stops. Thus for three years, he contemplates all directions, examines the mystery and pursues the void, sits seeing the infinite, body light and clear, sitting and standing in the void. The Way of Invoking the Void is extremely true and difficult to declare.

Next contemplates as before, inwardly seeing his own person thoroughly, perceiving the palaces and terraces above the nine heavens, mountains, rivers, forests, birds and beasts, the limitless ends of clouds and cliffs, connecting with all true beings, the assembly of immortals all converse, clear and distinct rectification, not fixed nor again thought upon; after a long time naturally clear and distinct. Having become distinct, he hears in his ears the sound of the five notes, strings, and stone chimes, as if truly heard; after a long while he then sees the immortal official of the Central Peak, riding a yellow cloud dragon, accompanied by twelve jade maidens, wearing yellow flying skirts, holding five-coloured splendid banners, bearing five ganoderma cinnabar essences, held in a golden basket, bestowed upon my person. Having seen the immortal official, he again feels respect and receives it, immediately wearing it, tasting its fragrance; then wipes his eyes, swallows qi twelve times and stops. The Purple Degree Fiery Radiance's Way of Invoking the Void is supremely wondrous, difficult to express; practicing it for three years, he penetrates the mystery of the void, thoroughly sees the deep darkness, calculates blessings, longevity, and ill-fortune; his whole body is comprehended; his face produces golden light.

Having completed the five directions, he rises sitting facing east, knocks his teeth nine times fully, and utters a blessing:

Ten thousand transformations arise from the undivided birth; the mysterious thread governs the void; the revolving wheel is silent; it turns and moves the four quarters; flowing light extends ten thousand li; penetratingly perceiving the void; the three essence treasures shine; flying mists hang in the chamber; morning essence flows mysteriously; the nine orifices open and communicate; the four meetings and eight expansions; preserving the void, invoking the void; cause my spirit and wisdom to be clear; thoroughly examine good and ill; harness the mysterious chariot; the green canopy flies ahead; ascend to the most brilliant morning; prostrate before the Jade Emperor.

The Sovereign's Inner Method of Invoking the Void for Penetrative Vision of the Heavens ends here. The efficacy is special and differs from common use. The center is carefully rectified; one mind is preserved in thought. Enter the chamber one hundred days, and there will be a faint likeness of the future. Three years, the spirit and darkness are thoroughly penetrated; all is clear and bright; not one is lost; truly a rare truth from the void; truth descends thereby. Its Way is subtle; it is not spoken of in the world. Men value rank and position; I value this Way. The rulers of the four seas seek this method; I have not heard of it. My Way is the root of immortality; foreknowing the future; penetrating the mystery of the void; looking upward to the infinite; hearing the movements of ten thousand li; comprehending the wonders of all under heaven; how could it be surpassed? Those who attain it mount the green canopy, fly the misty mysterious cover, ascend to the emperor's dawn. It is treasured and secret; do not rashly transmit it; violate the bright statutes, leak the true text, and your body, your ancestors, the seven mysteries, and your parents will all be filled with ghostly servitude; your body will perish in the dark springs; bearing the charge of the three officials; enduring great hardship; be cautious and careful.

Wearing and receiving the Purple Degree Fiery Radiance, cultivating and learning the Way of Preserving Truth and Invoking the Void for Penetrative Vision, one should constantly be in a separate quiet chamber, not concerning human affairs; quietly think and preserve thought of the four directions and ten thousand li afar, mountains, forests, grasses, trees, birds, beasts, people, the mysterious Yi, Qiang, Hu, Zang, old and strange tribes; all come to bow before my person. Also think that my two eyes emit flowing fire radiance, like stars shining forth the red brilliance, light filling ten thousand li afar; the four directions, mountains, lakes, rivers, and forests are all dispelled by the light; the utmost heaven is pure and clear without dust or filth; the eyes see the boundless homeland, circumspect and penetrating, nothing not connected. Thus all cause clear rectification; knock teeth nine times fully, raise the head and bless:

Mysterious radiance shines within, penetratingly reflecting the infinite; thoroughly seeing and hearing; nine orifices open wide; flowing essence rushes forth; ten thousand li clear and open; sitting perceiving nature; foreknowing good and ill; attaining to ride the flying mist, ascending the great void. Finished, draw in qi, swallow liquid seven times and stop. If one can cultivate this Way, within one hundred days, one will have a faint likeness of the future; three years, the eyes see the void; sitting see ten thousand li afar; ears hear ten thousand li of sound. The utmost wondrous Way is not to be written; passed mouth to mouth; carefully receive the secret words.

The Flowing Gold Fire Bell

The Flowing Gold Fire Bell is the mysterious radiance of the Most High Great Way Sovereign’s excursions and banquets; it rouses the majesty of the nine heavens above; below it destroys the evil of the six heavens; the mysterious radiance reflects the Sovereign’s neck; flowing and illuminating the eight extremes over three hundred thousand li. At the beginning of the establishment of the three heavens, it dispelled the beginning of the six heavens, and so was transmitted to the Sovereign of Supreme Subtle Heaven. The divine text is hidden within the jade palace’s jade chamber; the empty radiance shines bright; resplendent in the Upper Purity; flying dragons and poisonous beasts wing at its sides; purple clouds and mysterious brilliance cover its summit; jade maidens and golden true youths, each three hundred in number, are appointed to guard the spiritual text and to scatter fragrance in the empty court. Having accumulated seven thousand years, it transformed into five talismans; light penetrates the eight directions; due to the five directions’ officials of camp and guard. The Sovereign of Supreme Subtle Heaven, to transmit to the Golden Palace’s later sage Sovereign; the later sage Sovereign entrusted it to the Prime Minister, the Azure Boy Sovereign, to bestow upon those who become true persons, who wear it and move in the Upper Purity. Those who study the truth but lack the Flowing Gold Fire Bell, their necks produce no round radiance, and they cannot ascend to the three lights. If one has golden bones and jade substance, with the mysterious name Azure Palace, and obtains this text and wears it in practice, all the heavens, all the lands, the four seas, and five sacred mountains, and all the host of holy immortals and officials, none will not bow to welcome, the divine radiance stirring awe; its control is not light; the Three Primes send forth thirty-six jade boys and jade maidens to attend and guard the person. Wearing it nine years, one may ride the eight-scene jade carriage, flying through the great void.

The Flowing Gold Fire Bell is the essence of the nine stars, also called Round Radiance. The Sovereign of the Most High’s majesty; born before the nine heavens; condensed qi formed into text; brilliant radiance shining forth; illuminating the ten directions; suspended essence hanging about the Sovereign’s neck. Accumulating ten thousand years, transforming into five bell divine talismans, descending to the Sovereign of Supreme Subtle Heaven; awe-inspiring to control the demons of the utmost heaven; divine presence spreads through the court of nine mists, commanding all below heaven; none not governed. The Most High Great Way Sovereign treasures this Way; instructing the universal rulers of true immortals; inspecting and punishing leaks. Those with true immortal talent who wear this talisman, without following the mysterious rules and lightly giving it to the untrue, or defiling and neglecting the spiritual text, all the seven ancestors will suffer harm; the examiners and former teachers will join the ghosts’ officials.

To be worn upon the head with purple silk two feet two inches long, written in vermilion. If one has golden name and jade frame, obtains this text, all destined for heavenly response. The person wearing the talisman, entering and going forth, should always imagine a round radiance upon the neck, illuminating thirty thousand li afar. Within nine years, diligently thinking of the truth, pure fasting and firm purpose, one obtains true spirit descending; the round radiance shines forth; rides the void and moves; sitting, preserving, standing, disappearing.

The Five Seals Ascend to the Void, Preserve Immortals’ Highest Talisman also called Fire Bell

The Sovereign of Supreme Subtle Heaven when first receiving qi, the mysterious appearances first dividing, ascended the nine mysterious void born terrace; five emperor divine officials guard the eight directions; five talismans shine in the void, seeming present and absent; obscurely upon the Phoenix Terrace, within the jade chamber and twisted room. After accumulating seven thousand years, its text appeared; flowing light shone in the nine heavens; treasured text resplendent in Jade Purity; the left throw becomes the Flowing Gold Fire Bell; the right wave scatters the seven primes; restraining the demons of the utmost heaven; majesty spreads in the court of nine mists; the utmost wondrous Way, penetrating and subtle, difficult to overcome. The Sovereign, purifying and fasting in the great void jade terrace, the hall of true penetration, the jade chamber, golden splendour’s room, attended by countless maidens, five-coloured divine officials numbering a hundred million; flying beasts and poisonous dragons; mansion gates complete, huge dragons a thousand feet long guarding the walls and banks; phoenix cries and dragon roars; a hundred musical instruments excite the chamber; majesty shines through the broad court; lions howl and roar; the assembly blows spiritual songs; jade sounds shine flowing; divine consorts sing together; jade maidens strike strings and play. Thereupon I summoned the Central Yellow Lord Lao, the Supreme Ultimate True Person, and set out the flowing mist nectar, surrounded by firm fruit, red trees and white seeds, hidden ganoderma mixed and intertwined, all fragrances scattering, accumulating ninety days. Then the Turtle Mother pressed the brush; the Supreme One wiped the mat; the heavenly consorts attended with incense; jade orchids were woven; white jade was made into slips; golden characters were inscribed thereon; entrusted to the left official of the immortal capital; sealed in a jade box of cloud brocade; transmitted to the Central Yellow Lord Lao; according to the oath received the five talismans, prostrated and retired. Then summoned the nine spirits’ flowing light cloud carriage; five-coloured divine officials numbering fifty thousand; flying with azure green feathered dragons’ cloaks; ascended to the Golden Palace and Jade Purity’s palace. If one has golden script of the Eastern Flower, and sees this text, then one’s destiny corresponds to the immortal. Wearing the talisman and moving, ten thousand gods come to pay respects, entering and departing from the void and the realms, circling the five sacred mountains; body born of water and fire; transformations in the ten directions. Wearing it nine years, descends to the green canopy, ascends to the Three Primes, position reaches Jade Purity. Its Way is secret and wondrous; not transmitted to the untrue; lightly leaking the chapters, one’s body perishes and form is mutilated. According to the mysterious true statutes, one in seven thousand years receives transmission; if violating oaths and vows, calamity will befall the seven mysteries, the body and former teachers, all becoming ghost officials.

The Flowing Gold Fire Bell Contains the Great Blessing of Majestic Divine Wisdom

Cultivating and wearing the Flowing Gold Fire Bell, entering and departing far and near, passing through dangers of bandits, sickness, and calamity, at times of peril and harm, one should preserve true light to defend oneself, opening the Way of ten thousand li. Upon beginning practice, facing the proper direction, knock the left teeth twenty-seven times fully, swallow qi thirty-six times, then think of the forms of the place where one is, mountains, forests, grasses, trees, people, birds, beasts, spirits, all clear and bright; all come to bow before my person. Think of the Northern Dipper’s seven stars covering my head; still preserve my left eye as the rushing star, right eye as swift lightning; their light shining brilliantly as a rushing star ninety thousand li afar; seeing the pathway opening with the light; mountains, forests, grasses, trees, people, houses, soldiers, bandits, ghostly qi, all disappear without trace; the four roads open wide; then bless saying:

Open before and close behind, Heaven balanced and Earth lifted; the Divine Duke goes forth wandering; the four roads open; cause Heaven and Earth to open my bridges; front and back, left and right, penetrate the eight directions; left casts the rushing star; right swift lightning light; flowing fire ten thousand li; what demon dares oppose? The Supreme One will escort; ten thousand gods come to welcome; wherever I go, all is auspicious and good; riding clouds and driving the void; ascending the great void. Finished, draw in the essence of the two eyes back to their palaces; left takes seven qi, right takes seven qi, swallowing them; finished. Thus one may venture through dangers, attack ghosts and soldiers; all respond with resonance and clarity. Its method is most wondrous; do not rashly transmit it.

The Five Emperors’ Flowing Bells, Five Talismans, Awe-Inspiring Control of Utmost Heaven’s Demons, Summoning and Commanding the Five Directions’ Divine Spirits, Corresponding Above to the Five Dawns, Participating in the Seven Primes, Corresponding Below to the Human Body; the Nine Orifices and Seven Luminaries, Encircling Heaven and Earth, nothing not involved; no secret unmeasured; fine detail all revealed; preserving the talisman first; casting the talisman then shakes awe; if one wears it, receives the master’s words.

If in the human world one encounters a place of evil ghosts, one should perform the great blessing of shaking awe; face north and close qi for twelve breaths; think of the five directions’ qi covering the crown and whole body; inside and outside bright and clear; nothing is seen. Then knock teeth thirty-six times fully; swallow the qi of the five directions; open the three swallow qi gates; completely enter the destined body; preserve my two eyes’ boyish light as flowing stars; shining forth over five directions; then bless saying:

Heaven’s Origin seven essences; Five Emperors’ Flowing Bells; flashing and scattering electric light; like heaven’s rushing stars; light shining in ten directions; illuminating ghost and true forms; what small demon dares at my life gate? The Most High has decreed; slay without pity; gut the liver and rip the belly; utterly destroy ghost essences; thousands all crushed; tens of thousands all fallen; divine awe utters blessing; capturing and recording without cease. [Finished], then swallow qi thirty-six times and stop. Thus one blessing, the five directions’ divine officials all protect armor and life; diligently record the places with spiritual qi; bind and bring to court; three blessings and the ghost king’s lineage is extinguished.

If entering the five sacred mountains to tour the rivers and mountains, venturing and treading rugged places, one should, before reaching each place within a hundred steps, knock left teeth thirty-six times fully. If to the Eastern Peak, preserve the Eastern Blue Emperor’s rare forest pearl official attendants nine thousand to guard before, behind, left, and right, with azure mist qi covering crown and body; if to Southern Peak, preserve the Southern Red Emperor Dan Xuanzi official attendants eight thousand, guarding before and behind, with crimson mist qi covering crown and body; if to Western Peak, preserve the Western White Emperor Shaohao Ling official attendants five thousand, guarding before and behind, with white mist qi covering crown and body; if to Northern Peak, preserve the Northern Black Emperor Xuanming Hao official attendants five thousand, guarding before and behind, with black mist qi covering crown and body; if to Central Peak, preserve the Central Yellow Emperor Holding Center official attendants twelve thousand, guarding before and behind, with yellow qi covering crown and body. Finished, bless saying:

Heaven above shines spirit; seven dawns, mysterious essence; five dippers, floral cover; encircle and bind my form; five-coloured flying mist; mixed and blended; body wears seven primes; Flowing Gold Fire Bell; shines scattering without direction; utmost heaven dark and deep; five emperor divine officials; driving and commanding heavenly troops; for me control and restrain; mountains, rivers, land; thousand ghosts, ten thousand spirits; all come to bind heads; send true forms; before slay, after slaughter; none captured ceases. Finished. Thus one blessing, heaven’s demons vanish; ten thousand gods come to court; roaming the five mountains; treading rivers and mountains; no more fear to spy and watch; the five mountain immortal officials themselves present five ganoderma and five born jade flowers; come to provide the person.

If in the midst of armies and bandits, under hanging white blades, amid calamity and difficulty, one should knock right teeth twelve times fully; preserve the seven stars covering the body; mysterious radiance penetrating and reflecting; all around one body. Preserve the liver as the Year Star, issuing on the left; the lung as the Tai Bai star, issuing on the right; the heart as the Ying Huo star, issuing before; the kidney as the Chen star, issuing behind; the spleen as the Zhen star, issuing above the chest. Cause the five stars’ essence qi to entwine before and behind; my body resides in the Dipper’s chief; beneath the five stars. Next preserve the five emperor divine officials guarding my left and right; bless saying:

Heaven is my house; Earth is my bed; five mountains, rivers, and streams are my bridges; mysterious Dipper’s primal essence is my clothing; hidden in the seven primes; land of flowing fire; the one who measures me is the Supreme One’s purpose; those who pass me are the White Prime’s no-heroes; disaster cannot touch; soldiers cannot harm; cause my body to ascend to the Golden Palace; capital of nine elders. Finished. Thus amid affliction, the nearing end is delivered and freed.

Five-coloured brocades each fifty feet long, to invite the five emperor immortal officials. Purple gold five taels; translucent and shining on the imperial avenue; agarwood five jin; reaching to the three primes above. True pearls one tael, as the oath of the alliance elixir. Writing knife one piece, as the path to sever death’s qi. Golden pearls seven pieces, to offer the seven primes’ essences. Crimson patterned cloth seventy feet, as the fiery radiance’s qi.

Whoever receives talisman and scripture should treasure and trust, go to the master, pure fasting three days, bathe and burn incense, write talisman and scripture, expose them on a high altar for one night; at dawn ascend the altar together; report to the Northern Emperor; open the alliance text; pass on the talisman and scripture to disciples. Without ascending the altar to swear, none may rashly open chapters; if the master lightly leaks the scripture, the body suffers the test of the wind blade; disciple does not accept and unfolds the scroll; calamity reaches the seven mysteries; body mutilated and blind. The rules of the four extremes forbid lightly leaking scripture; the law of the great scripture forbids without oath. Unless golden name and jade frame, none may hear or see.

Those who seek immortality first lack the five talismans to wear; the five mountain immortal officials do not guard the destined form; ghost talisman does not fall upon death name; resting in caves and crags is defeated by the nine heavens’ demon kings; entering and departing the human world cannot avoid officials, swords, and soldiers. Those who obtain and wear it are covered and protected by heaven; roam freely without bounds, moving according to desire. Preserve thought of the true person returning to original palace; five ganoderma and five births; body shining with jade light; immortal officials protecting and guarding; three primes come to the chamber; riding clouds and driving the void; ascending Jade Purity. After receiving the talisman one hundred days, one should write five talismans on five boards of five-inch paulownia wood, each placed on a board. Also write a needle on each, recording the year, month, day, hour, certain county, certain village, certain mountain gentleman Wang Jia, age certain, certain emperor’s son belonging to certain mountain. Bury the talismans in the five mountains; when burying, knock teeth thirty-six times fully, bless saying:

Above open to the three primes; Jade Emperor most august; below report to the five mountains; five-coloured immortal officials; receiving the flowing bells and five talisman true words; pure fasting with five incenses; record place and name of mountain and river; request to fix true immortals; come to guard my form; five ganoderma flowing yellow, black, white
