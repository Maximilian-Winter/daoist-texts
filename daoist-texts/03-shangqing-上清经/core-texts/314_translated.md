### The Five Registers and Talismans of the Supreme Purity Cavernous Authentic Primordial Scripture

The Five Spirits of the Great Unity receive the Five Talismans and observe the Five Registers, petitioning the Emperor Lord of the Mixed and Harmonized Way, seeking the art of longevity and the immortal divine.

The talisman of the Five Spirits’ inner treasures is the Way of the Great Unity Emperor Lord’s mixed and harmonized radiance. One may, according to one’s natal chart, inscribe the Five Talismans, placing them altogether in a brocade pouch; to carry it is to live long and never die.

Moreover, always in the month of one’s birth, on the day and hour of one’s birth in that month, enter a chamber and inscribe the Five Talismans; facing the king (the recipient), swallow them whole. When finished, recite the blessing:

‘The Five Spirits of the Great Unity, the Registers recording the year of birth, a thousand years and ten thousand years, coeval with Heaven; the Emperor Lord holds the talisman, decreeing life without decline.’

If one wishes to take these talismans repeatedly, the times most auspicious are the night hours of the fifth day of the fifth month, the seventh day of the seventh month, and the ninth day of the ninth month.

The Right Great Unity Emperor Lord talisman to untie the three gates and twelve knots within the womb is to be used according to one’s natal chart or on the day of the Eight Solar Terms. When one wishes to perform the untying of knots, first swallow three copies of this talisman, facing the natal quarter, inscribed in genuine cinnabar on white bamboo strips wrapped in white membranes. It is born within the solid knots, thus entering the void and receiving the spirit. Therefore the bamboo membrane is inscribed with the writing of untying the knots.
