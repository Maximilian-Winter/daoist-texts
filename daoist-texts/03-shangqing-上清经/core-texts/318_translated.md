### The Supreme Golden Truth Jade Radiance Secret Book of the Grand Supreme

The Lord of the Nine Heavens received from the Supreme Void Spiritual Metropolis the Golden Truth and Jade Radiance from the Primordial Heavenly King; he named it the Scripture of the Eight Scenes in Flight. The Vastly Born Supreme True named it the Scripture of Eight Simple Supremes; the Azure True Little Youth named it the Unfolding Seven Primes; the Grand Supreme Way Lord named it the Secret Jade Formula. The Golden Seal originates before the Nine Profundities, and its upper chapters declare the names of the four seasons. Its Way is lofty and subtle, the most revered among scriptures, commanding all myriad truths; it rectifies and governs the host of immortals, with profound talismans streaming forth, illuminating the Purple Morning, secreted within the palace of Great Abundance above the Nine Heavens, the Golden Radiance Purple Hall, the Jade Treasure and Jasper Chamber. Cast in gold as slips to write the spiritual text, carved in cinnabar on jade to elucidate its chapters, its flowing light resplendent, shining through the Supreme Void, the sun and moon shining by its side, five dawns winging the spirit.

He commanded the daughters of Golden Splendour and the youths of Jade Morning, each numbering three thousand, to attend and guard the jade script; the jade consorts managed incense, the spirit winds raised smoke; giant dragons and poisonous beasts guarded the jade palace; the jade phoenix spread its wings; the divine luan shaded the mystery; the host of truths feasted in ritual; myriad sages paid homage at the jade throne. Upon the jade steps, carriages flourished in the heavenly court; the Supreme Emperor bent his will before the desk; the Jade Emperor changed the calendar to regulate the movement; the Stellar Pivot commanded the Dipper to guide the spirits; they sang the Sacred Land in harmony to align the scenes; transformed the seven revolutions to dance through heaven; traversed the three and five in divine transformation; dispersed the courses and measures through the Nine Profundities; marshalled the five phases to summon souls; controlled the unfolding to awe the spirits; commanded the Eight Scenes to ascend the void, seized the heavenly demons under Golden Truth, unveiled the secret book in the silent chamber, chanted the wondrous chapters in the interstices; governed myriad emperors on the highest heights; marshalled the host below in the living cycle.

At that time, the beginning of the established Qi, the Lord of Nine Heavens sat in command at the Spiritual Metropolis, bearing the jade contract, accompanied by the five elders of supreme truth, the thirty-nine emperors, the Former Sovereign Teacher, the Lord of Myriad Beginnings, the Most High Holy Great God, the Grand Supreme Way Lord, the Emperor of Fusang, the King of the Valley of Yang, the Supreme Origin of the Southern Pole, the Three Primes of Purple Simplicity, the Queen Mother of the Western Tortoise, the Three Primes of the Great Origin, the Grand True Lady. Ascending the highest Purple Jade Palace and the Jade Treasure Terrace of Seven Reflections and Vermilion Chambers, they issued edicts to the Five Emperors and the Four Directional Officials, the Spiritual Metropolis Divine Troops, to assist and protect the Supreme Origin. They commanded the Supreme Immortal, the Jade Lady of Supreme Harmony, to wield the Golden Truth talisman to summon spirits and capture demons, establishing it in the five directions. The Four Perfected of the Great Ultimate recited the chapters of the Supreme Void, their wondrous chanting penetrating thoroughly; the Eight Scenes united with truth; the jade radiance shone brightly through the heavens; the unfolding was clear and profound; the three dawns halted their radiance; the eight winds returned their banners; the mysterious drum covered by clouds; the nine breaths mirrored the spirits; the three and five wings praised; the six and six combined; verdant and profound above the profound, splendid and magnificent in the great darkness; fragrant flight surrounded the sun; flowing lightning stirred the essence; radiant splendour intermingled and scattered; divine candles merged their brightness; flowing and lingering for a thousand kalpas, attaining wonderful forgetting of revolving.

Then the Lord of Nine Heavens immediately took his place upon the Mysterious Platform, commanding the left immortal attendant Li Yufei and the spirit supervisor Deng Yuansheng to hold the nine-coloured banners and jade imperial edicts, announcing the covenant to the Four Luminaries, instructing the host of truths. The Grand Supreme Way Lord’s Scripture of the Eight Scenes in Flight, Golden Truth Jade Radiance Unfolding Seven Primes, took its place at the highest summit, roaming the Jade Clarity, aided by the Golden Immortals, guarded by the Five Emperors’ spirits, issuing commands in all matters. Cloud wheels and flying canopies, flying dragons arrayed their carriages; dragons soared to the limits of the sky. In a mere instant, myriad immortals assembled; jade wheels and emerald carriages flowed with essence in verdant lushness; myriad instruments of wind and song; phoenix cries and luan strides; smoke intertwined and gathered; roaming the profound and great, the rustling above the Great Rosy Clouds; wandering beyond the boundless, each returned to the Jade Void’s abode, unfolding as the spirit wind moves the Qi.

The Grand Supreme Way Lord returned to ascend the towering terrace and the nine-bend chamber, inviting the later sages, the Nine Profundities Golden Palace Emperors, the Prime Minister Qingjun, to fast and meditate three months, according to covenant receiving from the two lords, each sealing a scroll in the Golden Palace Upper Court and various Azure Palaces. At the time of the great calamitous cycle, the three ways wax and wane, the two breaths separate and combine, governed by fixed laws; in the age of Tang, the nine yang dispersed calamities, cutting off misfortunes, searching out the most worthy. In such a year, if one cultivates the great cave’s true scripture, the refined unity of essence and shadow at the secret pass, applying the eight ways to summon the void, refining the golden splendour within the Three Primes, chanting the simple spirits in the silent chamber, marshaling the five phases to summon souls, wearing the golden divine tiger talisman, moving the seven stars at the heavenly gate, managing the mysterious names on the imperial charts, establishing the Azure Register in Supreme Clarity, conceiving the jade blossoms to form bonds, embracing the jade embryo within the inner spirit, excelling beyond the world to lengthen prosperity, guarding silence in accord with nature, then one may receive the profound transmissions of the Eight Scenes, announce the wondrous formulae of Golden Truth, apply the summoning spirits within the curved chambers, place the unfolding to control the spirits, extract the seven ancestors from the secret palace, escape the five sufferings on the knife mountain, leave the eight hardships in the fiery village, extinguish the burden stone in the root of fate. Whoever obtains this text will soar beyond the Nine Profundities, traverse the trace of flying shadows, clearly behold the Three Purities. Yet none have it; for many kalpas it remains untransmitted.

The Scripture of the Eight Scenes of Golden Truth and Jade Radiance originates above the Nine Heavens, prior to the Scenes themselves, mysterious radiance streaming forth, as if neither existent nor non-existent, suspended in essence, bright and dense, illuminating the jade palace, accumulated for over seven thousand kalpas; its text is exceedingly clear, gazing upward beyond the empty mystery, amid the great void, its measures are inscrutable, destruction does not extinguish it, shining brightly and limpid, penetrating the ten heavens. Then the Lord of the Nine Heavens, in the first year of the Beginning, in the eastern direction, on a propitious day, purified himself at the Supreme Void’s Seven Treasure Jade Terrace, swore a golden azure covenant with heaven, requesting to receive the spiritual chapters, to summon spirits and capture demons in the unfolding seven primes. After the arcane chapters were measured, having no teacher or school, its origin unknown, suddenly it arose. When the text was applied, the Eight Scenes appeared in form, shining light in the jade chamber, summoning myriad truths; at that time the imperial commands were issued, and no immortal failed to come to court, performing the rites of obeisance and feasting on the jade scripture. This is the imperial trust of the Nine Heavens, the mighty edict of the Jade Emperor; the left assistant held the banner, the immortal capital was placed on the right, the jade attendants and myriad officials of the five directions guarded the precious text, managed its protection and worn by its adepts. Following the Four Brightnesses of the Great Ultimate, transmitted once in myriad kalpas, secreted within the palace of Great Abundance above the Nine Heavens, the Golden Radiance Purple Hall, Jade Treasure and Jasper Chamber, deploying flying gauze natural curtains, jade desks and golden beds, the jade morning youths holding incense on the left, golden daughters dispersing smoke on the right, the supreme consort attended at the front, jade immortals at the rear, mysterious clouds and purple canopies shading the hall, the host of true immortals and highest sages ascending thrice monthly to perform rites. This precious formula and method was announced; the three and five changed their fate; the great calamity recurred; within seven hundred years it shall be enacted in the world. If one has the mysterious imperial chart of the jade character of purple clarity, the golden treasury and jade bones united with truth, such a person may listen to the covenant transmitted. Slightly revealing the imperial treasure, the seven ancestors, parents, and the body of destiny, tried by the three officials, filling the knife mountain hell, among the three disciples, for myriad kalpas never to be restored, the practitioner must be careful.

The Primordial Heavenly King revealed it above the empty mystery, transmitting it to the Lord of Nine Heavens, Grand Supreme Way Lord, Azure True Little Youth, Five Elders Supreme Truth, Thirty-nine Emperors, Former Sovereign Teacher, Lord of Myriad Beginnings, Supreme Origin of the Southern Pole, Three Primes of Purple Simplicity, Queen Mother of the Western Tortoise, Three Primes of the Great Origin, Grand True Lady. The Former Sovereign Teacher transmitted to the Purple Clarity Emperor, the Lord of Myriad Beginnings to the Yellow Stone Teacher and the Jade Youth of the Three Heavens; the Grand Supreme Way Lord to the Eastern Sea Little Youth and the Lady of Purple Tenuity; the Later Sage to the Nine Profundities Golden Palace Emperors; the Emperors entrusted to Prime Minister Qing Tongjun, the Four Perfected of the Great Ultimate, and the Western City King Lord. All these precious formulas were orally transmitted among the highest truths; the Prime Minister Emperor controlled, corrected, composed, and promulgated the rites in order, successively gathered into a precious scroll, now sealed within the stone chamber of Wangwu Mountain. If one is diligent, aspiring to the highest, renouncing worldly glory, ascending the Spirit Mountains, diligently practicing bitter meditation, with mastery of the Azure Palace, then one shall obtain this text, and the Emperor shall dispatch a perfected immortal to mysteriously transmit the mark body. With this text, the Five Emperors guard the quarters, summon spirits and capture demons, regulate essence and control the spirits, cultivate the way and recite scriptures, responding above to the Nine Heavens, no longer subject to trials and defeat. According to the method of application, perfected immortals descend and speak with the mark body; within seven years, they ride the void and travel; within nine years, essence is stirred; by day they ascend the dawn. The highest of ways is not transmitted to the untrue.

All who obtain the Scripture of the Eight Scenes of Golden Truth and Jade Radiance, their bodies respond with mysterious agility; their fated destiny shall be immortal; each day they burn incense in a separate chamber, worship morning and evening, their hearts abiding in the spirit of true jade radiance and violet Qi, filling the fasting hall; they bow and reverently serve as if before the eyes of the gods. The Emperor dispatches twenty-four golden daughters and jade morning youths each to attend and guard the mark body, rewarding merit and punishing faults, distinguishing good and evil. There are also officials of water and fire on the left and right, inspecting leaks and violations of regulations; punishments are by the wind blade’s test, implicating the seven ancestors. The rules of life and death are clear; cultivation must be careful.

All who cultivate the supreme way, entering the mountains to fast, chanting spiritual chapters, yet lacking this scripture and the application of talismans to summon spirits, capture demons, and unfold the seven primes, may not rashly act on the jade text; true beings will not descend, and heavenly demons will invade the body. Therefore this text is the trust of the Nine Heavens, the edict of the Jade Emperor; acting without trust leads to failure in the true way; lightly reciting in pursuit of immortality accumulates toil without effect, bringing disaster; the three officials enforce the trial, destroying the mark body. If the mark wishes to cultivate the way, it must have the many scriptures, with sufficient numbers of sections, complementing each other perfectly, adhering to propriety in every movement, reciting ten thousand times, so as to receive perfected immortals descending to the chamber, achieving immortality on the appointed day; not necessarily ten thousand times but truly refined.

One who wears the talisman to summon spirits, capture truths, and control demons, unfolding the seven primes, is born of the Great Ultimate; the commissioner of life changes the year; the registrar records the rolls; noting the Supreme Mystery, universally announcing to the four bureaus and five emperors’ spiritual officials, the five sacred mountains and nine rivers’ immortals and myriad spirits, all bow and welcome, guarding and protecting the mark body. This is the true imperial edict of the highest deity; hence one gains control over spirits and commands the divine. Whoever pursues this way must not enter filth or defilement, nor tread the stains of life and death. To violate these prohibitions, true spirits depart high, returning to the supreme palace; acting without control brings harm to the mark body; the disciple who obtains the method must be cautious.

On the day of the Beginning of Spring, the Three Primes Supreme Lords ascend to the Heavenly Emperor while the Supreme Emperor roams and feasts; this is the day of the Primordial Scene’s Way to receive immortality. On that day, following the above method, one bathes and fasts, in the morning entering the chamber, burning incense and performing rites; applying the talisman to summon spirits, capture truths, and subdue demons, placing it in the five directions, with the mark at the centre, facing northeast, knocking the teeth twelve times, looking up to the violet, green, and white triple-coloured clouds, returning northeast, then silently reciting the subtle words: ‘Three Primes Supreme Lords, I pray you return the divine chariot, descend upon my body, separate my name on the right, grant me immortality.’ When finished, one recalls the northeast Pure Micro Upper Mansion, the Palace of Beginning Yang; the Primordial Scene Master of Records, surname Ge, named Tai Zhou Xian, seven inches and eight points tall, wearing a dark yellow ribbon, a seven-coloured radiant jade crown on his head, five-coloured shoes on his feet, holding the mighty divine sceptre, riding the chariot of the Eight Scenes, the flying turtle and mysterious cloud carriage, harnessed by the Azure Dragon and accompanied by twenty-three Supreme Harmony youths, descending to govern the mark body in the Mud Pellet official chamber, then softly praying:

This is the way of the Primordial Scene; after eight years’ practice, the clouds of the Three Primes and the flying wheels of the Eight Chariots come to receive the mark body, ascending into the imperial dawn.

‘Mysterious Scene Supreme Spirit, harnessing and feasting on the eight breaths, creating the scene of nine profundities, soaring without boundary, returning truth to descend, resolving my old stagnation, shading with flying clouds, covering with purple canopy, gaining the ride of the Eight Scenes, ascending the heavenly limits.’ Ending with swallowing the eight breaths.

Without immortal name and jade register, arranged in the purple palace of the netherworld, one cannot open this scripture to awaken the mark heart. The mark who obtains this scripture shall be entered in the Eastern Splendour registers, ranked equal to perfected immortals; it is treasured and secret, not to be lightly declared. To rashly reveal the secret words brings death and destruction to the mark gate.

Those who cultivate the Scripture of the Eight Scenes of Golden Truth and Jade Radiance, placing talismans to summon spirits, capture truths, and subdue demons, must first face north to the incense burner, knock the left teeth thirty-six times, chant once the chapter of Golden Truth Supreme Void, then proceed. Chanting this single phrase, it echoes through the Nine Heavens, penetrates the interstices, shines through the mysterious origin; the Jade Emperor is alarmed and listens; all demons are bound; this chapter is most wondrous, hence called Golden Truth. Its chapter says:

‘Heavenly demons ride empty space, myriad essences alarm the divine court. Entrusting transformations in song and verse, following changes into the nameless. Tumultuous Qi, how confused and disorderly, filth and way of the road born as mud. In the clouds gathering in the Vermilion Palace, the Northern Emperor commands divine troops to leap. Drums and flights move from the Dao itself, mysterious movements come to oppose. The upper scene guides the flying reins, flying chariot inspects the cloud camp. Hastening to inspect the Northern Emperor’s records, capturing and collecting the names of demons. Unfolding spreads the heavenly net, releasing might and casting jingling bells. Golden Truth assists the empty cave, jade radiance shines through the eight darknesses. Golden mystery guards the upper officials, divine tigers slay heavenly essences. Cutting off myriad evil Qi, countless all are made equal. Receiving the trust of the Nine Heavens, howling commands none refuse. Summoning truth to the three caves, wisdom chants clear and bright. Eight ways gaze at mysterious rosy clouds, seven revolutions align the heavenly classics. Blending the imperial one truth, lifting and crossing the seven ancestors’ stages. Cutting off and destroying the five suffering roots, restoring souls and receiving honour. Golden light shines in the silent chamber, divine candles naturally born. Floral incense disperses in the jade universe, smoke and Qi penetrate the jade capital. The Emperor dispatches the roaming carriage, the Three Primes descend the green carriage. Swiftly driving the nine profundities, morning rites at the Jade Emperor’s court.’

When finished, one proceeds with the practice. Thus once recited, heavenly troops assist the truth, the Jade Emperor controls demons, cultivation reaches thoroughness, summoning and drawing true spirits. Without this chapter, the immortal way is not formed, heavenly demons defeat one, harming the mark body; thus it was composed as a chapter, carefully to be observed and practiced.

The High Supreme Jade Emperor, the Primordial Emperor Lord, received the Unfolding Seven Primes talismans from the Lord of Nine Heavens, commanding the office of perfected flying immortals, communicating with spirits and seeing through, speaking with the gods, subduing demons and controlling spirits, awe-inspiring the ten directions, flowing fire ten thousand miles, sitting in death and standing in life; practicing it for nine years, one gains the ride of the mysterious chariot, flying and ascending Supreme Clarity.

Applying the supreme way, cultivating and seeking immortality, capturing demons and controlling essence, writing talismans according to the method, facing north knocking left teeth thirty-six times, preserving the essence of sun, moon, and five stars, thoroughly reflecting the mark body; softly praying:

‘Seven primes unfolding, issuing might and casting essence, scattering light ten thousand miles, divinity shining five spirits, above controlling the northern marsh, inspecting and recording ghost names, the heavenly emperor’s command edict, cutting and slaying evil spirits, I prepare the unfolding, flowing golden fire bells, protecting the six palaces within, drawing flowing essence without, flying immortals and perfected immortals, joining with my fast, thoroughly discerning the empty cave, the three ways unite in brightness, gaining control of the mysterious clouds, riding the green carriage, leading the five sacred mountains, directing my ascent to clarity.’ Ending, applying according to position for seven years, one gains perfected immortals descending, granting the mark supreme true scriptures.

Those who have golden bones and jade names, purple characters of Supreme Clarity, who wear the talisman to summon spirits, capture truths, and subdue demons, and the unfolding seven primes talisman, then are recorded in the Nine Heavens, the Emperor reports to myriad truths and four bureaus of spiritual officials, separately guarding the mark body, coming and going, ascending the five sacred mountains, escorted by immortal officials, myriad demons bow their heads, hostile spirits lose essence. Cultivating for one hundred days, communicating with spirits, perfected immortals descend, granting the mark true scriptures. Within seven years, one gains the ride of flying carriage, roaming the five sacred mountains, coming and going within the Three Purities. To reveal to three persons, transmitting to the untrue, seven ancestors, parents, down to the mark body, all filling the knife mountain, the three disciples’ midst, for myriad kalpas never restored. Those who obtain it keep it secret, carefully as the Four Luminaries.

All who learn the Way, when the Dao is accomplished and they fly and ascend, if without this scripture, also the Nine Heavens’ jade officials do not dispatch mark immortals, the gates of the heavenly pass are not accessible, the officials of the five sacred mountains do not guard the mark body. Therefore this is the trust of the Nine Heavens, the imperial edict, applied to perfected immortals, not to be circulated in the world. Those who obtain it become immortals; with left assistant holding the banner, immortal capital on the right, jade attendants, five directional spiritual officials guarding this scripture, it must not be lightly neglected or revealed; to reveal the highest truth causes violation of prohibitions, death and destruction of the mark body. In ancient times, the rules passed once in myriad kalpas; now if there be one, within seven hundred years they hear three transmissions. Following the clear method, master and disciple fast ninety days in facing each other, bringing one golden dragon and one jade fish each, purple ribbons one hundred feet, three taels of gold, to present to the scripture master, swearing by the trust of the Nine Heavens. Without covenant and transmission, one suffers the test of the wind blade; receiving without trust, lightly walking the Way and despising the true, the body perishes before ghost officers, implicating the seven mysteries. Thus the Four Poles clear methods hold only one-third of trust; masters who receive but do not follow the method to employ it otherwise, perish by the three officials, long filling hell, never becoming immortal.

Zhao Boxuan, formerly master of the Lord of Myriad Beginnings, received the scripture and accomplished the Dao, should ascend the Golden Palace, but lacking the talisman to summon spirits, capture truths, unfolding seven primes, in the method of receiving and returning to Rong Mountain, after seven hundred years went to the Pure True Youth, according to the covenant received it, swearing by the Mountain of Feathered Wings, now ascending as Supreme Clarity Left Minister.

Lord Wang passed the scripture on Yangluo Mountain, on the morning of the eleventh month at the hour of the Rat, swore by the Nine Heavens to transmit it to the Lady of Southern Mountain, now sealed within Yangluo Mountain.

Songzi of Southern Mountain, in the year of Yangshuo, transmitted the scripture on Taihua Mountain to Gu Xi, ordering it to be sealed within Bird-Mouse Mountain.

True Man Tong Bai, on the twenty-ninth day of the sixth month, granted this scripture to Xu Yuanyou.

1. At the end of the Dunhuang manuscript it reads: ‘On the thirteenth day of the intercalary fifth month of the first year of Ruyi (692), the scripture was produced by Wu Zhong.’ Hence it is a Tang Wu Hou period copy. The following only corrects errors and omissions in the Daoist Canon text, variant characters are not collated.

2. The Dunhuang manuscript lacks the character “fei” 非. Suspected that “fei” should be “yu” 於.

3. “Primordial Heavenly King revealed it above the empty mystery, transmitting to Lord of Nine Heavens, Grand Supreme Way Lord,” Dunhuang has “Lord of Nine Heavens received it above empty mystery, transmitting to Primordial Heavenly King, Vastly Born True Grand Supreme Way Lord.”

4. “that body,” Dunhuang reads “the body.”

5. The character “jing” 經 originally written as “sheng” 聖, corrected according to Dunhuang.

6. “ten thousand times,” Dunhuang reads “once.”

7. The character “nian” 念 originally “he” 合, corrected according to Dunhuang.

8. “five blossoms knot freshness,” Dunhuang reads “five viscera pure freshness.”

9. “west side” originally “southwest,” corrected according to Dunhuang.

10. The character “ru” 如 originally “fu” 負, corrected according to Dunhuang.
