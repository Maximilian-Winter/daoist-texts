### Instructions for the Practice of the Record of the Fetal Essence of Shangqing, Untying the Knots

In the upper part of the fetus are four knots: one knot in the Mud Pellet, two knots in the mouth, three knots in the cheeks, four knots in the moon (palate). To untie the four knots of the upper part, on the day of one's birth sign at dawn, one enters a chamber and burns incense, bows nine times to the northwest, facing the Primordial Father of the Nine Heavens, taps the teeth nine times, thrice calling the true name of the Primordial Father to guide back. Then turns southeast and bows thrice, thrice calling the true name of the Profound Mother of the Nine Heavens, the name of Chaos Returning. Facing the seat of the birth sign, one sits calmly, closes the eyes, and contemplates the Primordial Father, whose body length is nine inches and nine fen, wearing a black and yellow plain spiritual ribbon, a head crowned with a headdress of seven pearls and jade, the crown of Limitless Advancement of Worthy Ones, dwelling above the Nine Heavens in the Great Ultimate Jade Palace, the Jade Treasure Mansion in the Village of Elixir Spirits, the Cave of Origins. He rides the flying chariot of Blue Mist, accompanied by twelve flying dragons and twenty-four immortals, descending to enter my body to govern the domain of the Mud Pellet.

Next, one contemplates the Profound Mother, whose body length is six inches and six fen, clothed with a blue precious divine-light brocade embroidered with frost gauze and nine-coloured ribbons, her head wearing a purple-origin black-yellow precious crown, dwelling above the Nine Qi Limitless in the Jade Forest Seven Rays Elixir Chamber, the Jade Treasure Cave of Origins Mansion, Nine Light Village of Shangqing. She rides a purple cloud flying canopy, accompanied by twelve phoenixes and thirty-six jade maidens, descending to enter my body and govern the chamber within the face.

One thinks of the parents transforming into the two energies, blue and yellow, turning and intermingling, completing above the head and face. When finished, tap the teeth nine times, a slight incantation is chanted:

"I, so-and-so of the nine spirits’ transformation, with knotting qi impure, segments bound and fixed, blocking the spiritual gate, hereby solemnly by my birth sign report to the High Dawn, Primordial Father and Profound Mother, shining upon my body, eight scenes united as one light, Nine Heavens true together, jointly untie the upper part, the four knots of the fetal root, return the spirit to fill the door, nine orifices knot immortals, internal fetus refined and transformed, nine elixirs condense the spirit, changing blue into red, two energies entwined, longevity equal to the three lights (sun, moon, stars), forever enjoying myriad years."

Think of the three heavenly true kings descending together upon my head and face, transforming into three energies of blue, purple, and yellow, mingled like clouds, entering through the mouth, eyes, nose, and orifices, spreading across one side of the face. Then one raises the head and offers this prayer:

"Three Heavenly Great Kings, Nine Profound Spirit Immortals, grant me the upper untying, the knot at the head’s gate, transform the nine elixirs naturally, descend upon the gate of pure gold, unite the clouds of the three truths, send the current through my body to perfect my spirit, cleanse away deathly qi, extinguish the fetal root, fill the spiritual radiance firm, cast away all evil afflictions, knots untied, segments receiving truth, the mysterious light flows and spreads, penetrating the royal abyss, speaking the name of the Nine Heavens, returning the fetus transformed to immortal, internally full, externally overflowing, manifestly wrapped in perfection,"
