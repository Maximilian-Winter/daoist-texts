### The Supreme Clarity Supreme Lord Nine Truths Middle Scripture Scarlet Birth Spirit Elixir Formula

First, close the eyes and look inward. If you find anything incomplete, then you should burn incense while sitting quietly with eyes closed, firmly grasping both knees, preserving the essence and gathering the myriad spirits, chanting the incantations according to the above method. At dawn and at midday, preserve the spirit, proceeding from sitting quietly, so that no one sees you. All is inward contemplation, guarding at the moment of closing (the eyes). On the first day of the month, at midnight, when spirit preservation is completed, again preserve the white vapor within the two eyes, like the size of a chicken’s egg, before the face; presently it transforms into two bright mirrors, each nine cun in diameter, with which to illuminate front and back my entire body’s twenty-four spirits, clear and distinct in their reflection and examination. After a long while, then the heart utters the prayer:

Great Bright Precious Mirror, dividing form and dispersing transformation, reflecting the original spirit, controlling and subduing myriad demons, flying and moving in Supreme Clarity, unveiling the cloud kerchief and gauze, commanding a thousand spirits, sealing mountains and summoning rivers.

When the incantation is complete, one should perform it once every five days. This is called overseeing the inner essence and inspecting and gathering the Five Spirits. Constant practice prevents calamities from arising, and one’s rank ascends to High Immortal.

The Path of the Whisk-Wielding Boy enables thorough vision of the Emperor Lords’ Five Spirits, and the method of the Twenty-four Spirits. Always on the cycle of sixty days, on the day Gengwu, at noon, take one sheng of pure water, place one zhu of true elixir in the water and stir it, turning left three sevens times, chanting:

Profound Flow, Vermilion Ford, first shining with Eight Brightnesses, the body and spirit in multitudes arrayed, all come to see the form, penetrating ten thousand li, reaching the Nine Spirits. The Emperor Lords reflect the boy, sending me to the essence above.

When the incantation is complete, face east and wash the eyes with the water, turning twice seven times. Those who practice constantly will see through myriad spirits. The incantation should be whispered softly; use the water and the moon to wash the eyes, always facing east.

The Supreme Perfected Person summons the Five Stars in the Grotto Chamber, registers the Flying Soul in the Six Harmonies, secretly preserving the Path.

The Southern Pole Primordial Lord Jade Scripture Precious Formula

At midnight, in quiet calm, sitting or reclining at will, relax the body and purify the heart, expand the breath and regulate the spirit; before the eyes look inward, preserve the Venus Star of the West, between the eyebrows on the face, named Jade Pendant Purple Gate. One cun above the eyebrow, straight in one cun, is Jade Pendant Purple Gate. On yang days preserve the star on the left eyebrow; on yin days preserve the star on the right eyebrow.

Next preserve the Northern Star of the Constellation, in the Emperor and Minister’s Profound Palace at the center of Heaven. The Profound Palace is located straight above the nose, five fen below the hairline, straight in one cun.

Next preserve the Eastern Wood Star, at the Grotto Pass Vermilion Terrace. The Grotto Pass Vermilion Terrace lies one cun behind the eye, straight in one cun. On yang days preserve the star behind the left eye; on yin days preserve the star behind the right eye.

Next preserve the Southern Mars Star, at the Jade Gate Splendid Chamber. The Jade Gate Splendid Chamber lies five fen inside the corners of the two eyes, straight in five fen. On yang days preserve the star in the left eye corner; on yin days preserve the star in the right eye corner.

Next preserve the Central Guardian Star, at the Golden Cabinet Yellow Chamber Long Valley. The Golden Cabinet Yellow Chamber Long Valley is at the center of the philtrum of the nose, straight in two fen; the star appears suspended above. When preservation and contemplation are complete, imagine the star assuming its place; one should feel the Five Stars emitting rays of light, casting five-colored smoke that penetrates the entire body, thoroughly illuminating inside and out; the body feels as if infused with the fragrant star essence entering.

Then knock the teeth five times in succession, swallow saliva twenty-five times, then softly chant:

High Supreme Purple Gate, within see the Emperor Lords, the Great One merged, the purple chamber’s door, within the door brilliance shines; these are the Three Primes. The Three Primes gather essence, there are Five Spirits; precious rays spread radiance, sending forth light that pierces the dawn; essence transforms and accumulates, becoming an old man, head adorned with plain countenance, green robe, scarlet skirt, right side wears flowing bells, left side bears tiger patterns; hands grasp Heaven’s cords, scattering scarlet flying dawn; feet tread the splendid canopy; exhale rays forming the body; Three Luminaries guard and protect, enabling me to obtain truth, nurture soul and control spirit, ride the gale and fly as immortal.

When the incantation is complete, swallow saliva thrice more, knock teeth thrice. Those who practice this way for fifteen years will be met by the Southern Pole Old Man Danling the True, who welcomes on a carriage of green clouds; by the Western Pole Old Man Suling Ziqi, who welcomes on a chariot of yellow gale; by the Northern Pole Old Man Xuan Shang Xian Huang, who welcomes on a dragon of dark radiance; by the Eastern Pole Old Man Fuyang Gongzi, who welcomes on a sedan chair of blue canopy; by the Central Pole Old Man Central Shangxuanzi, who welcomes on a curved dawn canopy. The Five Old Men unite and ascend together to the Purple Void. Practice this without interruption; preserve it with refined precision. Avoid treading on filth; forbid mingling with unclean places; constantly incense and bathe frequently; those who violate this will decay and wither; those who follow it will fly as immortals. When preservation is complete and one desires to make a wish, continue to speak it after the incantation. Preserve the Five Stars’ common resting place, straight entering two cun below the nape of the neck, then part one cun aside; the stars are like round pellets, illuminating the face and body.

On the first day, the full moon, the seventh, the ninth, the thirteenth, the seventeenth, the twentieth, and the twenty-fifth day of the month, at cockcrow, preserve the image of sun and moon in the soul chamber of the Six Harmonies. The soul chamber of the Six Harmonies is above and outside the two eyes, a small raised height in the high sky; pressing upon it and knocking the teeth, one hears the four meetings moving beneath; straight in one cun, nine fen wide, named the residence of the soul chamber of Six Harmonies. The sun is left, the moon right; preserve the envoy’s bright form and hollow shape, causing the star to assume its place; close the eyes and concentrate intensely, so that no escape occurs. When finished, knock the teeth seven times, swallow saliva nine times, and softly chant:

Great Bright Spiritual Dawn, nine degrees of deep blue, summon the rosy clouds to conceal radiance, pour and refine the five forms; the palace carriage of Six Harmonies, the seven spirits harmonize and balance; enable me to fly as immortal, soul ascending to Supreme Clarity.

When the incantation is complete, practice fifteen years and the Jade Emperor will send three pale carriages to welcome you. One should nurture the ability to crow like a cock, so that its office is morning and has regular intervals. If one acts secretly and concealed, one will surely lose the combined radiance of sun and moon. The Southern Pole Lady received this technique from the Supreme High True, named Twin Radiance Winged Form Hidden Preserving Secret Path; those who possess the immortal bones will be able to hear this scripture.

Let the nine stars’ light, one star before the dipper handle, its rays mutually reflecting and reaching this place; then softly chant:

After the meditation, swallow saliva thrice nine times.

If on the day of Six Jia, or the last day of the month, or the day of Six Ding, preservation conflicts or is too close, one may adjust in order, measuring and cultivating accordingly; it need not be frequently close or in succession. In all things, this method is effective, only requiring perfection in the true method. Thus is the Supreme Lord Return to Origin Forgiveness of Sins Way completed. The Supreme Lord hides the Five Passages’ days sealed in the Jade Chest of the Five Mountains, hiding the Return to Origin Hidden Path in the Nine Mornings Palace. Once the Five Passages are cultivated, then practice Return to Origin; the Five Passages belong to the Emperor, and Return to Origin begins and opens at the Profound End. Therefore, cultivating the Five Passages and practicing the Seven Origins Return Path means not eating blood or pungent food; if seeing corpses or filth, those who violate receive the Supreme Profundity’s judgment.

The Five Passages are the auspicious meeting days of the Supreme Lord. Return to Origin is the day of renewal of the Supreme Lord. Not knowing the Five Passages, one cannot absolve sins and remove evil; not knowing the Return to Origin Hidden Path, one cannot carve the name in the Supreme True. Always on those days, meditate on preserving auspicious matters, first thanking for the sins and offenses within the body, so-called release of seven generations, detachment from form and name. This is not shown to immortals in the Nine Palaces.

Those who cultivate matters of the Grotto Chamber and Purple Chamber, and preserve the Nine Mornings and Seven Origins, upon first rising, first lying down, at breathing times, and after meals, first softly chant:

Five Stars, Five Passages, Six Harmonies Purple Chamber, Return to Origin Hidden Path, Dispelling Seven Mornings; the soul begets the Profound Father, the Father transforms and forms the spirit; the spirit begets the Profound Mother, the Mother transforms and births the body; governing my bones and muscles is the Lord; providing my essence and qi is the White Origin; long life and lasting vision, flying as immortal in the ten heavens.

When the incantation is complete, do not let the ears hear the incantation sound; this is the Supreme Lord’s secret incantation, to dispel evil qi, bring forth spirit, so that one does not tire of ignorance throughout life.

The Supreme Lord Nine Truths Emperor Lord Nine Yin Mixed and Extended Radiance Myriad Transformations Hidden Celestial Scripture

The Emperor Lord Nine Yin Scripture says: Therefore, desiring transformation and form division, hiding and sinking in the eight directions, concealing the body and hiding radiance, entering emptiness and creating darkness, coming to produce myriad things, summoning and controlling evil chiefs, one should always fast and cultivate the Emperor Lord Nine Yin’s refined thought.

In the first star, named Supreme Lord Palace, within the palace is the Emperor Lord’s transformation and hidden escaping original inner concubine, named Great One Law Tao, style Xingzheng Fu, wearing a yellow brocade robe, vermilion and blue flying skirt, cloud-coiled hair.

These nine stars of the Emperor Lord’s fight palace, the hidden concubines’ nine yin names, when chanting the incantation, only pronounce their position titles and names; do not mention their robes or hair below. If one can know the Emperor Lord’s Nine Yin, one ascends morning to the upper heavens, attaining the rank of Supreme Clarity Perfected Person, destined never to suffer the calamity of mourning in this life; the spirits of the Great Yin protect in attendance, the essences of myriad spirits pay homage, scattering and transforming mixture, changing heaven and earth. These Nine Concubines of the Great Yin are the Emperor Lord’s Yin Palace spirits. Their destiny is to practice the Way, resolve knots, present talismans to the upper register, secure the soul and control the spirit, transform and produce body and spirit, guide qi and extend essence, seeking longevity; but those who do not know the Emperor Concubines’ names and yet practice the Nine Yin mixed transformation will never become immortals.

Between the two eyebrows, one cun inward is the Bright Hall, a square one cun, where the Emperor Lord’s Great Yin Nine Concubines usually reside. Always on the even days of the month, at evening during the time of vital energy, burn incense in a separate chamber, sitting or lying at will, closing eyes for a long time, preserving the Emperor Lord seated peacefully in the Supreme Ultimate Purple Chamber. Also preserve the Great One Five Spirits in the Six Harmonies; preserve the Big Dipper Nine Stars in the heart; preserve the Great Yin Nine Concubines in the Bright Hall; preserve the Great Micro Boy Gan Jing Essence, facing the Emperor Lord before; the boy holds five talismans in the left hand, five registers in the right. Also preserve the image of Destiny standing behind the boy; also preserve the Great Yin Nine Concubines from the Bright Hall, arranged in order standing behind Destiny; also preserve the Great One Five Spirits from the Six Harmonies, ascending into the Supreme Ultimate Purple Chamber, arranged in order standing behind the Great Yin Nine Concubines. When all is complete, the Emperor Lord and myriad spirits suddenly unite in great transformation, becoming one person, like a newly born infant, named the Impermanent Boy, style Transformation Jade, holding the Nine Stars, wearing the sun on the head, holding the moon in the mouth; the boy with the light of sun, moon, and nine stars illuminates and perfuses the whole body of Destiny, inside and outside thoroughly clear, self-aware that Destiny’s body is red like fire disaster, no longer covered, the coverings all like smoke.

This is the Emperor Lord Great One Nine Yin, the Nine Yin Mixed Transformation of myriad forms. After a long while, knock teeth twenty-four times, swallow saliva nine times, then softly chant:

Cavern Heaven Divine Light, returning and shining purple clarity, Profound Yin Nine Mornings, hidden sinking and ultimate darkness, Lady of the Dipper, three daughters scattering forms, divine concubines inner transformation, myriad things stand formed, lightning flashes and thunder crashes, clouds and mists flow and scatter, ninety transformations, producing elixir and raising blue, Great One Nine Women, palace transforms and mixes pure, impermanence extended sinking, thus dwelling in the shadowy darkness, brocade robe and splendid garment, purple feather flying skirt, left wearing hidden talisman, right girded with tiger patterns, controlling fire and wearing fire, hands embracing scarlet banners, beside are eight winds of demons, four pulling radiant clouds, roaming freely Heaven’s cords, transforming and dispersing Seven Origins, concealing mountains and rivers, overturning and distant Five Mornings, sun and moon blocking radiance, arrayed constellations losing truth, dividing form into hundreds, transforming bodies into thousands, in fire becoming fire, in forest becoming forest, dwelling in water becoming water, dwelling in mountain becoming mountain, what is sought suddenly comes, what is summoned is already before, suddenly satisfying the heart, eyes instantly reaching, thousands of kinds, thousands of things, following the words of the heart; the Emperor Lord is in form, Supreme Jade Morning, no heroes sharing radiance, four and White Origin, water generates heaven and earth, nourishing my body; the mouth has words, following intention transforming and changing, Jade Boy holding talisman, Jade Flower holding kerchief, divine concubines offering incense, four truths sharing conveyance, all things and objects are as I say.

When the incantation is complete, again preserve the stars Mercury, Mars, Venus, Jupiter, Guardian Star, combining into the mundane Five Stars, each from its direction, all coming into the mouth, causing the Five Stars’ light to illuminate upward the mud pellet purple chamber, illuminate the five organs in the middle, illuminate the Yin chamber below; causing the form of the whole body to be thoroughly penetrated. This is the Emperor Lord’s use of brightness to return the Nine Yin’s Way. Meditate long, knock teeth five times, swallow saliva five times, then softly chant:

Five Stars arranged in a row, shining brightly in five directions, Mercury dispels disaster, Jupiter brings prosperity, Mars eliminates calamity, Venus averts war, Guardian Star guards the four quarters; I obtain auspiciousness, the Emperor Lord’s use of transformation harmonizes and returns the Nine Spirits, Great Yin pure radiance, palace dwelling Nine Stars; inscribe my jade registers, record words in the Emperor’s chamber, riding the gale, fanning the radiance, flying soaring in the great void, entering and exiting darkness, roaming the ten directions of darkness, covered by five clouds, summoning spirits and commanding winds, commanding myriad spirits, guarding the immortal lords above.

When finished.

This Emperor Lord Nine Yin Hidden Scripture is an inner matter of the Nine Truths. The ranks of the Five Spirits, the ways of the Three Primes. The Central Yellow Old Lord, Southern Purple Essence Lord, Eastern Blue Boy Lord, Northern Supreme Lord, Western Supreme Origin Lord, all return the Nine Yin to scatter form, arrange the Five Stars to extinguish radiance, mix and transform myriad things, respond to events and stand formed, long lasting and enduring, ascending as Perfected Persons. If Destiny often practices it, transformation is without limit, the body generates water and fire. Thus the Emperor Lord Nine Yin Way is complete.

The Supreme Jade Morning Yu Yi Running Sun Scarlet Radiance Jade Writing Binding Lin Running Moon Yellow Radiance Jade Chapter

This right method of running Sun and Moon is the Precious Secret of the Supreme Lord Supreme Clarity Supreme Ultimate Nine Emperors Four Perfected Persons, the Jade Chapter of the Mysterious Void Jade Lord. Except those self-named in the Golden Pavilion and recorded in the Eastern Splendor, none may hear or see these two chapters’ texts. Those who practice it first purify and fast one hundred days, severing human affairs; only then may they do it. Practiced long, the upper realm Sun and Moon provide each with fifty Jade Boys and Jade Girls.

The Supreme Yu Yi Scarlet Writing and Binding Lin Yellow Chapter is the Supreme Jade Emperor Lord’s Spirit Secret text, stored in the Nine Heavens’ chamber, the Elixir Jade Terrace; those not earnest in heart and fond of truth, without the bones record of flying Mysterious Heaven Immortals, may not see or hear it. Hearing its titles, all must not speak rashly; to mention or offend the Three Officials Heaven and Earth is unforgivable. At first one in three hundred years may transmit it to one person; after seven hundred years it is transmitted again; if the spiritual darkness reports a suitable recipient, it is transmitted to him. The method of transmission is always between teacher and friend, to uphold the Mysterious Discipline. If transmission is to one unfit, not observing laws, it is a leak of heavenly writing; violating oaths and being negligent causes death as a lower ghost, the Seven Ancestors’ judgment of wind and fire sins; if not of the same breath, better to keep silent.

In the Western Mysterious Mountain Grotto Terrace there are these two scriptures, engraved on jade slips, written in gold characters. Also in Wangwu Clear Void Heaven, they have them but not complete; only the Supreme Profundity Palace High Supreme Terrace, and Penglai Mansion North Chamber Golden Pillar Jade Wall have the inscriptions complete. The Central Palace immortals, Supreme Clarity palaces, do not know what these books are about. In the northern cave of Mount Emei, in the stone chamber door hinge, there is carved stone text: Yu Yi leads the Sun Essence, Binding Lin summons the Moon Spirit, attaining the Way dwelling supreme palace, rank titled Emperor Lord True. In total twenty characters; lower immortals see this and do not understand its meaning or matter. Among immortals many do not see the texts. Its Golden Liquid Spirit Elixir is merely a minor art, not attaining flight to Supreme Clarity. Those who desire to practice this Way need not be foolish or wise, but on earth there is no such text. The True Officials’ Profound Method, starting with oath, then transmission; those who obtain and practice it attain the rank of Supreme True, riding the Eight Radiance Jade Wheels, roaming the Nine Mornings, visiting the Supreme Origin Palace, seeing the Great One Emperor Lord, all worshiping the Original Morning. Therefore the secret words say: if you receive Yu Yi and Binding Lin, you then become a Supreme Clarity True, without cultivating the Supreme Way, you shall not see the Three Prime Lords.

Thus for twenty-four years, one may ascend to heaven by day, and need not practice the running preservation Way. Always preserve them by my side, and chant the old incantations; do not let the ears hear.

To practice the Yu Yi Running Sun Way, at dawn look upon the sun at its first rising; when there is no sun, first close the eyes and hold the breath ten breaths, then swallow the sun’s radiance ten times, preserving the rosy light, causing it to enter the mouth and immediately swallowing it. When done, softly call the Five Emperor names and the Moon Soul names, in total three times. Then preserve the Blue Emperor Lord, coming from the sun’s light on my left; then the Red Emperor Lord, coming from the sun’s light on my right; then the White Emperor Lord, coming from the sun’s light behind me; then the Black Emperor Lord, coming from the sun’s light on my left hand; then the Yellow Emperor Lord, coming from the sun’s light on my right hand. The Five Emperors all come, preserve their attire colors, causing the manifestation. Then knock teeth five times, swallow saliva nine times, softly chant:

Red Furnace Elixir Radiance, round brilliance nine brightnesses, great splendor opens the dawn, shining radiance scarlet essence, Five Emperors initiating rosy clouds, reflecting and penetrating myriad life, observing the fallen true, emptiness without trace or level, moving qi, refining colors, flowing and wandering five forms, enabling my spirit to transform, six orifices fully filled, sharing with Emperor Lord, Great One Without Hero, riding the scarlet cloud, Yang fire nine chariots, ascending and running mid-sun, united with the Emperor spirit, longevity equal to heaven and earth, two mornings inclining.

When the incantation is complete, knock teeth three times, swallow saliva three times, then softly chant:

Moon Soul Spirit, Ai Xiao Tai Biao, enable me to obtain the Sun’s Cave Heaven, East Meng Long Hill, to receive the Chapter of Dispelling Spirits, bearing the talisman of the Nine Existences, eating green essence sun, drinking cloud blue essence, feasting in the Eight Extremes city, ascending the bright true platform, sitting in the Hope Forest hall, chanting the Jade Morning’s words.

When finished, again preserve the Yang Fire scarlet cloud carriage, driving the nine red dragons, coming from the sun’s light to before me, still riding with the Five Emperors together running the sun. After long losing form, again swallow saliva fourteen times, then open eyes and concentrate intensely; preserve the manifestation naturally. Those who can long practice this Way will certainly obtain riding the radiance running the sun; thus the Yu Yi Way is complete.

To practice the Binding Lin Running Moon Way, at evening look upon the moon and face it; when there is no moon, in the quiet chamber close eyes and hold breath nine breaths, then swallow the moonlight nine times, preserving the moonlight, causing it to enter the mouth and immediately swallowing it. Then preserve the preceding Five Ladies’ names #1, and the Sun Soul names, in total three times. Then preserve the Blue Emperor Lady of the Moon, coming from the moonlight, descending, left and right in order, as in preserving the Five Noon Emperors’ method. All come, preserve attire colors causing the utmost manifestation. At this point knock teeth nine times, swallow saliva nine times, softly chant:

Yellow Essence Opening Radiance, Original Yin Inner Chapter, reflecting and viewing Supreme Profundity, opening and piercing myriad directions, dispersing cold fierce wind, Seven Mornings hanging jade, returning Yin and Three Harmonies, Heaven and Earth issuing light, purple radiance roaming and falling, floating flowers nine voids, round brightness assigning color, six qi transforming and connecting, Five Emperor Ladies treading clouds and grasping wind, spirit robe dense gauze, wearing jade belts and pendants, feather skirts brushing the sky, ethereal spirit fanning east, soaring trees spreading canopy, jade branches elegant and flourishing, cloud toads refining and churning, supporting and nurturing the Wood King, piercing roots ten thousand li, shading and luxuriant my body, soul harmonizing spirit transforming, six profound spirits filling, those returning return as infants, jade reflecting and reversing boy, Emperor Lord combining transformation, and radiance peach health, timely riding flowing bells, flying clouds ten dragons, ascending the bright palace, position as protector of the emperor, longevity matching two images, heaven and earth without end.

When finished, again knock teeth seven times, swallow saliva seven times, then softly chant:

Sun Soul Spirit, Zhu Jing Chi Tong, enable me to go west to the six territories’ gate, enter the harmonious morning jade palace, eight strings white mound, eight radiance upper chamber, to receive the talisman of ten brightnesses, wear the chapter of flowing stars and night light, sit in the Great Harmony hall, ascend the Seven Spirits platform, drink moon essence ointment, eat yellow jade purple ford, chant the highest chapter, recite the Jade Morning true words.

When the incantation is complete, again preserve the flowing bells flying cloud carriage, driving ten yellow dragons, coming from the moonlight to before me, still preserving and riding with the Five Ladies running the moon. After long losing form, again swallow saliva thirty times, then open eyes and concentrate intensely; preserve the manifestation naturally. Those who can long practice it will certainly obtain riding radiance running the moon; thus the Binding Lin Way is complete.

If one has already attained immortal Daoist status, having perfected essence and thought completely, after two years of preservation one will have manifestation; three years appearance; five years practice; then one obtains the ability to run the sun and moon. Those not yet immortal, beginning to desire essence and thought, thus are premature. Those who can long cultivate reach the two radiances above and become Supreme Clarity Perfected Persons. Once every seven hundred years transmitted to one person.

#1 This sentence is obscure in meaning; it is suspected to read ‘when finished, softly pray the Five Empresses’ names.’ See the lower scroll of the Nine Truths Middle Scripture.
