# The Scripture of the Supreme Clarity Great Unity Sovereign’s Secret Book on Disentangling the Twelve Knots of the Fetus Diagram and Formula

The title of the scripture is: The Scripture of the Supreme Clarity Great Unity Sovereign’s Secret Book on Disentangling the Twelve Knots of the Fetus Diagram and Formula. The compiler is unknown, and it is approximately from the Northern and Southern Dynasties. It is extracted and adapted from the Great Secret Book on the Elixir. One scroll. The original source is the Zhengyi division of the Daoist Canon.

Man’s life arises from the fetus within the womb, whereby he transforms himself, drawing upon blood and essence to form himself. Hence, after birth, the fetus within again knots itself; after formation, the blood and fluids do not remain. If they do not remain, the Sovereign combines and causes them to remain. The fetus has twelve knots, which bind firmly the five viscera. The five viscera are hindered and obstructed; the knots cannot be untied, the nodes cannot be removed; thus man’s sickness arises from the obstruction of the nodes, and man’s death arises from the firmness of the knots. Regularly, on one’s birth-day or on one of the eight seasonal festivals, one prays to the Sovereign together with the Great Unity to combine and regulate the hundred spirits, and to untie the firm knots within the fetus, the death nodes fixed to the root. The fetus has twelve knots, and within these knots there are twelve nodes; the nodes lie within the knots. He who does not know how to untie the knots and nodes of the fetus likewise cannot escape death. He who constantly unties them attains longevity.

The knots above the fetus: one in the mud pellet, one in the mouth, one in the cheeks, one in the eyes; these four knots of the fetus are in the upper part.

The knots within the fetus: one in the five viscera, one in the great granary, one in the large intestine, one in the small intestine; these four knots of the fetus are in the middle part.

The knots below the fetus: one in the bladder, one in the yin (genitals), one in the rear gate, one in the two feet; these four knots of the fetus are in the lower part.

The method of untying the knots is to enter a chamber, close the door, and preserve the thought. First read the names of the Sovereign and the hundred spirits below him; then after completion, proceed in order to untie the knots. This method is the way in which the Great Unity Sovereign combines the twenty-four spirits to untie the knots and remove the corpse’s vapours. Mark the day according to one’s birth-date or one of the eight seasonal festivals; at midnight or noon, at will, sit upright facing the direction of birth, hold the hands at the heart’s end, tap the teeth twenty-four times and say: 'Man born in the year of Jia, I summon the fetus-father and fetus-mother, the day of first birth, the accumulation of three deposits of blood, transformed into twelve great knots; now on this day of birth, I respectfully request the spirits of the three nines and the twenty-four perfect beings to untie the three gates and the twelve knots.' Then speak the names summoned:

The nine lords of the lower fetus, the true essences within the fetus, produce and transform the nine vital airs; these are the nine souls. The nine souls are the essence knots, the nodes firm within the fetus, causing the person to have no longevity and to perish prematurely in middle years. Today, on this birth-day, as if at first birth, we beg to obtain their scattering and dissolution — the twelve death roots, inscribed in the Jade Register above, the five talismans entering the body, the lower calming of the nine airs, eternally obtaining entanglement; above opening the nine palaces, below opening the nine gates.

The ritual reading is repeated twice; when all is complete, harmonize the qi beneath the heart, and do not let the voice cease or be hindered. Close the eyes and silently call on the Great Ultimate Purple Chamber Heavenly Sovereign, the Great Emperor Sovereign, surnamed Lichangling, also named Seven Spirits, also named Divine Elder. Thus offer the prayer; thrice preserve the true sovereign who unties the three nines knots, the Eastern Blue Emperor Diao Liang Ji, and others; below is the Mysterious Mother, Uncle Fire King, and twenty-seven persons, all attired in vermilion robes and yellow kerchiefs. The yellow kerchief resembles the form of the traveling cap. Their countenances are like infants, some having length, some not. If one cannot clearly perceive and remember one or two, one may enter a chamber to carry out the text and method.

Henceforth, the colours of mountains, clouds, and figures should be suitably arranged.

Next, summon the Great Ultimate Purple Chamber, facing north toward the Great Emperor Sovereign, and each kneel fully. Their words are: 'The upper gate: Diao Liang Ji and eight others; the middle gate: Great Unity Wu You Shou and eight others; the lower gate: Yellow Court Shi Ming Jing and eight others. The three nines, twenty-seven persons, on this day absorb the qi into the throat, opening the three gates. Each gate has twenty-four knots, each knot has twenty-four sinews. When the sinews are severed and the knots dissolved, the fluids and blood ascend and fill the mud pellet; the jade liquids descend and nourish the hundred spirits. On this day, so-and-so Jia’s name is inscribed in the Register of the Sovereign, attaining immortality as a divine immortal.' When finished, silently summon the Great Unity and ascend before the Sovereign. The Sovereign says: 'The fetal knots are now open, the light pervades within and without, granting thee longevity, thy fate not to decline or fall. Thou mayest now unite with my form.' The Sovereign then opens his mouth, and I sense myself suddenly entering the Sovereign’s mouth, directly reaching the Sovereign’s Six Harmonies Palace. Within the Sovereign’s Six Harmonies Palace is the Most High Spirit named Chong Ming Kong, styled You Liao Wu. He then tells me: 'Thou mayest now eat the essence of the sun.' I immediately take the sun-essence and eat it, swallowing nine times and stopping. Presently, I see before me the twenty-seven perfect beings, all standing by my side. The twenty-seven perfect beings say: 'So-and-so Jia’s fetal registration is now untied, all defiling vapours removed, the face now like jade’s sheen, the body open to the great void, longevity unto billions, united with the Sovereign’s talisman.' Then the Sovereign offers the following prayer:

Heaven above united truly, this is Jia’s body;
Heaven above united in spirit, this is Jia’s form.
Long time passes, all is complete.'

Thus is the combination of the nine lords, the inner transformation of the hundred spirits, the untying and scattering of the fetal knots, the opening and benefit of the three gates, the concord with the Six Harmonies, and the shining Sovereign’s transformation of the fate register, the qi stabilizing the mud pellet, the longevity receiving the talisman—only then may one be called a celestial immortal. Upon completion of the meditation, one then lets down the hair, combs the head again, loosens the clothing, rebinds the garments, and washes the hands and feet.

Within the Sovereign’s mud pellet is also the Six Harmonies Palace, in which dwells the Great Emperor Great Unity Sovereign, named Chong Ming Kong, styled You Liao Wu. He who knows him finds decayed bones restored to life, the five viscera blossoming with splendour, and fears no terror throughout his life. In times of fear, one faces north and calls this name thrice, offering the prayer:

Luo A Chong Ming Kong,
Thunder and wind You Liao Wu,
Above born the Sovereign’s form,
Protect the sign to be without care.

Thus is he as one journeying with a thousand companions.

The Great Unity says: 'Man has three souls, which benefit his existence; man has seven po, which harm his life. The seven po rise in the morning beneath the left eye, and in the evening descend beneath the nose at the philtrum. The disciple of the Way who desires to lie down first presses the left eye beneath and the philtrum with the right hand claw, each three times seven passes; this is the method to regulate the seven po.'

The Sovereign says: 'The Great Unity Precious Mysterious Jade Scripture is concealed by the Most High Perfected One within the Hua Chamber of the Five Mountains. Without a celestial register, one may not hear or see this. To see it is to live; to practice it is to become immortal. Therefore, heavily sworn is the binding of the heavenly truth, to prevent its divulgence and dissemination.

From the Most High Honoured Immortal comes this secret Way; those without immortal bones are not granted it; those without utmost sincerity do not hear it. Hence the scripture says: "Those who receive from the teacher must honour him." The transmission of the scripture is from master to disciple; receiving the scripture and using it is the disciple’s Way. At the time of transmission, each fasts for seven days, or ten days; before and after, they again declare a fast, each for eight days.

In ancient times, oaths were sworn by spitting blood and cutting hair, standing on altars to report to Heaven as a pledge not to reveal or breach the faith. Now, one may substitute golden and blue silk threads for the hair and skin, arrayed separately with solemn prayers to the Supreme Emperor. The method uses three golden rings, bright and shining red; blue silk nine feet long, substituting for the triple contract to swear by the Sovereign and twenty-four spirits; these may be joined to twenty-seven feet. On receiving the scripture, one writes two copies, each for one use. The pledge items are all recorded and may not be privately used for self-interest.

Hence the Great Middle Scripture says: "The teacher’s cause is the scripture’s affairs; hence it is called the giving of life to the receiver, who practices to be uniform in his sincerity, upholds the oath to Heaven, firmly announcing to spirits, binding joys and sorrows, holding to life and death. Here begins the proof of success, all hoping for the immortal court." Then one binds and bows to consult and receive, preparing the covenant chamber, making distinctions of rank to display the triple contract, diligently distinguishing the heartfelt mind, treasuring the scripture and its mysteries, implementing the essentials of the words, with sincerity preserving single-heartedness, revering the master and scripture, and not daring to be negligent. Thus only may one speak of communication with the spirits and the covenant of the Way and virtue. One reveres the scripture and secrets the Way; acts according to the oath; then the Sovereign inscribes the name upon the Jade Tablets, and records the sovereign register in the Great Ultimate. Should one violate the Way, then the seven ancestors suffer the test of the wind blade, the Mysterious Mother suffers the harm of fetal distress, the body becomes a lower ghost, the gate is likewise sealed, cast among the stones of Mount Zhanmeng and cast into the river of accumulated night. Alas! Let those with heart be cautious and secret! This is the Most High Perfected One’s covenant order, expounded by Heavenly Master Zhang in the Elixir Scripture; this is the book of careful oath-taking.

Three golden rings are the oath of the Three Primes. Blue silk twenty-seven feet long is fine silk, the oath of the Sovereign and twenty-four spirits. Red silk five taels is the oath of the Five Divine Lords’ sons. Two bundles of fragrant incense are used as the cause for reporting and communicating with spirits. One brush, one hundred sheets of paper, one tael of cinnabar for writing the oath.

These five kinds, contained in vessels, not disclosed, are all items to be had by those receiving the scripture. When the disciple finishes writing, he bears the scripture and the oath to the master’s chamber to receive transmission. After receiving the scripture, he may then apply it. Those who steal to use without swearing the oath, according to the Female Azure Edict, lose both lights. Those who receive but do not act suffer heavenly calamity. Those who act and divulge suffer the calamity of the wind blade. Those who transmit to unworthy persons cause their parents of seven generations to suffer the test. This is the essence of the Mysterious Capital Ghost Law Female Azure Edict.
