### The Supreme Purity Primordial Transformation Precious True Supreme Scripture

The precious Scripture of Supreme Purity, established from the beginning of the Nine Heavens, all arise spontaneously and coexist with the qi. The three lights shine together, manifesting above the Nine Heavens, in the boundless void. Sometimes they form flying mysterious purple qi, thereby completing the spiritual writings. The heavenly script is exquisite and subtle; its characters are one zhang square, with twisted strokes, difficult to trace or explain. Unless one be a True King of the Nine Heavens, none can understand its meaning or sound.  

Above the True Kings of the Nine Heavens, in the first year of the Void, the Supreme True of the Mysterious Capital was commanded to cast gold into slips. The many sages clarified meanings, lofty secret formulas, composing spiritual chapters, with the Jade Emperor annotating and inscribing the slips into chapters. According to the protocol of prostration and obeisance, all are arranged by rank and order, restrictions and categories, all issuing from the subtle meanings of the high sages. Sealed above the Nine Heavens, within the palace of the Great Ultimate, inside jade chambers, guarded by the West Flower Jade Maidens and the Pure Spirit Palace’s Golden Morning Purple Youth.

The Turtle Mountain of the West, also called Dragon Mountain, is the root and bond of the Nine Heavens, the reservoir of myriad qi, located at the northwest corner of heaven. It encompasses four hundred thousand li, rising to the boundary contiguous with Jade Purity. To the southeast it connects with the rosy mists of Yang, upholding the gate of the Azure Palace guarded by the Divine Tiger; to the northwest it joins the wilderness of the Cold Abyss, ascending to the divine court of the Golden Gate Immortals; southward it extends to the land of Great Dan’s floating pear, where the qi harmonizes with the luminescence of the Yang Grotto; northward it points toward the Hook Array, meeting the Floral Canopy, with qi treading the broad spirit; centrally it aligns with the eight-way mountain peak of Jade Capital, extending winds. The sky is level for thirty thousand li, entirely composed of golden walls and jade gates, with golden terraces and jade towers, twelve divine palaces. Above is the hall of spontaneous flowing essence, the Purple Pavilion of Golden Splendour, with chambers of precious jade, adjoining the caves of the nine apertures, producing clouds of purple qi, intertwined with phoenix patterns, nine colours falling in array. Cliffs bear purple laurel, ridges flourish with jade groves, coral forms branches, jade grows as roots, the soaring grove’s trees bear fruit, red infants with white rings, three splendours shine in vermilion light, emitting fragrance flowing in the Great Mystery. The eight airs fan the wild winds, the jade chimes sing in the void, dragons roar in the cloud towers, phoenixes whistle over the distant ridges, venomous beasts spread in myriad nets, long snakes a thousand zhang, the divine palaces resplendent, cloud immortals in throngs, the majestic prime mansion, each likeness exudes nectar—this is the wondrous transformation of the Primordial, truly the spiritual root of Heaven’s Origin.  

In the Hall of Golden Splendour, above the northern window, there arises spontaneously purple qi forming mysterious script, characters one zhang square, shining with resplendent rays, the heavenly script exquisitely subtle, not to be traced or explained. The Nine Heavens’ Elders, formerly in the first year of the Supreme Celestial Ablution at the Cloud Palace, feasted upon Turtle Mountain, then engraved golden slips and carefully copied the mysterious writings, resolving their hindrances, expounding their spiritual sounds, recording it as Turtle Mountain’s Cinnabar Emperor Flying Mysterious Purple Writings.  

The Western Queen Mother, on the day of the first yin hour of the first month in the opening of the Huang period, riding the void and traversing the spirit, roamed the nine skies. In the quiet fast upon Turtle Mountain, she ascended the hall of spontaneous flowing essence, Purple Pavilion, Golden Splendour, and jade chambers, toured the northern window, performed obeisance to the mysterious writings, gazed upon the cliffs and contemplated the spirit, her heart conceived the Supreme True. Thereupon, a wondrous response and mysterious awakening appeared, her cinnabar heart clearly manifested. Suddenly there came a great celestial deity, bearing sun and moon, shoulders adorned with round light, among the assembly of immortal feathers and canopies, riding a flying chariot of purple clouds of nine essences streaming through the skies, bowing and kneeling before the Queen Mother, saying:  

"I am the Phoenix Official of the Nine Heavens, Leader of the Immortal Kings, surname Shangxuan, styled Open Brightness. By command of the Primordial Heavenly King, I bring the golden books of the Nine Heavens, the purple characters, the blue gold and cinnabar writings, to bestow upon the Queen Mother. I confer the title Western Era Nine Spirits Supreme True Immortal Mother, enfeoffed over Turtle Mountain. Also I grant a volume of the Pure Writings, the Supreme True Primordial Transformation Registry, overseeing the immortal registers, inheriting the Jade Purity. Furthermore, with a green jade tablet, I provide the Nine Heavens’ phoenix robes, flying azure feathers, crimson morning infant’s jade crown, phoenix cloud shoes, divine phoenix purple wheels, flying feather canopies, twenty-four chariots, and five-coloured banners commanding the spirit’s season. Also, seven hundred Golden Maidens of the Upper Palace of Golden Splendour, attend and guard the Immortal Mother."  

She was commanded to govern the flowing essence of the Purple Pavilion of Golden Splendour, jade chambers; thrice monthly to ascend Jade Purity, twice to feast at Kunlun, and inspect the assembly of immortals. Upon completion, the celestial deity returned to the Jade Palace. At that time, the Immortal Mother received the mandate and took her seat, announcing the fast in the jade chamber. She commanded the maidens Wang Zi Deng, Dong Shuang Cheng, and others, with divine light brocade scarves to solemnly receive the golden books, purple characters, blue jade tablets, and blue gold cinnabar imperial script, the Supreme True Primordial Transformation Registry, and Flying Mysterious Purple Writings, four matters in all, sealed with the cinnabar imperial seal, stored in the jade chamber. She ordered thirty each of the Golden Maidens, Purple Morning Jade Youths, to attend and guard the spiritual script.  

According to the old protocol of the Three Heavens’ prostration and obeisance, she reported to the Five Emperors, the Five Sacred Mountains, the spirits of mountains, rivers, and seas, all the righteous gods. On the fifth day of each month, five names of scholars were submitted, their merits and faults distinguished, with reports accorded according to rank. The Immortal Mother customarily, on the day of the eight festivals and also on the fifth day of the month, feasted at the Cloud Palace. Then proceeding to the Five Sacred Mountains, she inspected the river sources, roamed the eight extremes.  

At such times, the five stars emerge in division, the sun and moon suspend their light, a hundred yang energize lightning, flowing gold brightens the essence, heavenly soldiers lead the way, five elders bear banners. The Immortal Mother always rides a nine-coloured carriage, purple clouds flying wheels, accompanied by five thousand Jade Maidens of the heavens. The maidens ride phoenixes, the men guide dragons, dressed in flying feather robes, all holding splendid banners, playing pipes, flutes, drums, and wind instruments, a hundred harmonies combined, phoenixes sing and dragons whistle, stirring bright clouds, splendid light intermingling, the three lights unite, the Purple Youth waves incense to dispel filth, divine consorts scatter blossoms to nourish the true, the heavenly balance sounds their banners, purple smoke veils the empty court, jade radiance flows in the great space, divine transformations impose their authority upon myriad spirits.  

At such times, the six heavens follow the mandate, evil shapes are bound, demons lose their sight, heaven brightens and air clears. This is the wondrous vision of the High Immortals, the profound spirit of the Cinnabar Emperor’s abode.

Turtle Mountain’s Cinnabar Emperor Flying Mysterious Purple Writings

The flying mysterious purple qi condenses the spiritual root, the framework of jade void governs myriad gods. In the void, it burgeons naturally, above are twelve towering passes. Jade towers resplendent, shining with cloud light, flowing essence of the Purple Pavilion with golden pavilion. The jade hall glittering resounds eight strings, midmost issues blue gold nine spirit immortals. The Cinnabar Emperor’s True Mother named Jingyan, flying azure feathers, horned unicorn, scroll carrier, frost-covered, holding the spirit banner, five-coloured commanding demons, facing the Emperor. Holding the tally of birth gates, chewing moon, crunching sun, sipping jade springs. From gauze robes issuing brilliance, refining the five souls, internal full and external overflowing, crimson mansion joyful. Golden light dazzling, form perfectly round, entering from the north, entering golden confusion. Only Open Brightness understands these words. On the tenth day of the fifth month, engraved in the north origin, inscribed is the Floral Canopy’s Leading Immortal Lord. The purple qi turns left with the Dipper’s rotation, passing through twenty-eight lunar mansions, returning above the Golden Gate. Truly the Cinnabar Emperor reviewing myriad immortals, diligently mastering this formula. Enveloping forms, subtle thoughts always dividing, wondrous visions responding to gatherings, obtaining essential writings. Three years to examine and preserve completeness, nine years to ascend the void and attain feathered robes. Phoenix robes lightly soaring to Dragon Mountain, obeisance and prostration to the Nine Spirits, visiting the Jade Morning.

The Southern Pole Supreme Origin Lord said: This is the inscription of purple qi flying mysterious writings, carved and inscribed above Turtle Mountain, above the northern window of the Purple Pavilion of Golden Splendour. The Nine Heavens’ Elders have seen this chapter, titled Turtle Mountain’s Cinnabar Emperor Flying Mysterious Purple Writings. The Western Queen Mother always treasures it as a secret; its purpose is profound and obscure, all are the subtle harmonies of the Nine Heavens. Without the immortal name, one may not glance upon its chapters. Those who obtain it are those recorded in the Nine Heavens’ archives, their names inscribed as Turtle Mountain.

The Nine Heavens’ Elders say: In cultivating the Way, always on the third, fifth, ninth, fifteenth, and twenty-fifth days of the months of the first, second, third, fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth, ninth, eleventh, and twelfth months—that is ten months a year—one should fast and recite the mysterious writings once each time. After midnight, when dew appears in the courtyard, looking up towards the Dipper and the Floral Canopy, there is the purple cloud qi, turning left with the Dipper’s beam, passing through the twenty-eight constellations and returning above the Golden Gate. If one is in the human world where the sky is dark and without light, one should meditate silently indoors, contemplating within according to the method above, making it distinct. After contemplation, one should bow to the purple cloud four times, knock teeth thrice, and raise the eyes in blessing, saying:

"Heaven is clear and bright at night, the mysterious void reveals the truth; flowing clouds linger, golden splendour unfolds; the Cinnabar Emperor spreads radiance, spiritual flight in the purple pavilion; tonight the formation opens, blue gold grants immortals; fulfill my supreme wish, embody natural response; bind the fate’s moonlight, protect the year and day’s root; the three spirits unite with light, eternally halting at Dragon Mountain; in secret night’s clear unveiling, I pray as said."  

Having finished, one then intakes the purple qi’s twenty-eight breaths, pausing at each. Practising thus for three years, one shall have signs of divine truth descending upon the resting bed. The body will bear purple qi, illuminating one shape; the Nine Heavens’ scriptures will name it, surely restoring one to the ranks of the immortals.

The Nine Heavens’ Elders say: The heavenly script is layered in myriad folds, each discussing its subtlety. Such a practice suffices to bring down the spiritual truth, to spread wings and soar to the nine skies, to ascend and feast at Jade Purity’s halls. If not for wondrous methods, the Western Queen Mother would not keep it secret within her inner robes, nor would the Great Existence be unaware of its restrictions.

The Supreme Origin Lord said: Heaven has forbidden clouds of qi, affecting the divisions of sun, moon, and five planets. In their regions, there are those who unite with the Way, those who obtain immortal lordship. When such signs appear, their omen is manifest.

The Nine Heavens’ Elders say: When seeing such clouds, one should perform ritual and blessing according to the text; it need not be on ordinary days. Diligently attend to it; when the cloud descends, one will ascend and meet. It should be sealed in the heart and not lightly shown to others; if the Way leaks, the spirit scatters, and the immortal will not thereby respond.

Primordial Bestowal upon the Western Queen Mother of Blue Gold and Cinnabar Imperial Script

The Most High Primordial commands the Spiritual Nine Heavens and Supreme Void Ancestors. The Western Queen Mother, named Wanqin, is the qi of the Nine Spirits of the Sovereign Heaven, blending the essence of Western Gold, forming the purple cloud’s embryonic bone, refining the sun’s essence glow, breathing in the seven luminaries’ splendour, combining morning mists and dining on the solar phoenix marrow, inhaling the moon’s essence and orchid brain, condensing into the jade root and golden store, linking to the cinnabar form, eightfold encircling purple heart, manifesting in the Cinnabar Emperor’s wondrous diagram. High arrayed in the imperial pavilion, resting in spirit peaks, ash-hearted above Supreme Purity, merit aiding myriad things, grace overflowing life, holding the season’s command alone, enduring through numerous kalpas. Hence the Most High curved blossom Primordial bestowed this. Because Wanqin possesses the golden true virtue, bestowed the title of Meditation Western Era Nine Spirits Supreme True Immortal Mother, Blue Gold Cinnabar Emperor, enfeoffed as mistress of Turtle Mountain, overseeing the primordial registers, according to the protocol of prostration and obeisance with green jade tablets, golden books, and jade characters, providing the Nine Heavens’ phoenix robes, flying azure feathers, crimson morning infant’s jade crown, phoenix cloud shoes, divine phoenix purple wheels, flying feather canopies, twenty-four chariots, five-coloured staffs commanding the spirit’s season, flowing golden fire bells, night shining candles, demon extinguishing jade seals, Nine Heavens edict tokens, guarded by seven hundred Golden Maidens of the Upper Palace, governing Turtle Mountain’s flowing essence Purple Pavilion Golden Splendour Palace, thrice monthly ascending Jade Purity, twice feasting at Kunlun, inspecting the assembly of immortals, the Five Sacred Mountains, rivers, and seas, all supreme officials, reporting accordingly.

Implementation of Blue Jade Tablets, Golden Books, and Jade Characters

The blue jade tablets, golden books, and jade characters, the Blue Gold Cinnabar Emperor’s bestowed script, all come from the Great Existence Palace of the Nine Heavens’ prostration and obeisance protocol, all composed with lofty mysterious void and natural void chapters, attesting to the officials of the Supreme True High Sages, not given to beginners. Similarly, the Golden Gate East Flower region has ritual texts to summon beginners of flying immortals. These also all come from the Great Existence protocol but differ in rank and order only. Unless one has a name in the Nine Heavens, recorded in the registers, their chapters will never be seen. Those who see their writings have all been engraved on slips for future life, listed in the imperial registers, destined to become gods and immortals; thus the reverse table is arranged in spiritual ranks. On the day the Way is completed, there shall be further descent of celestial truth, receiving the book and bestowed writings.

The Southern Pole Supreme Origin Lord said: The golden books and jade characters are all inscribed on blue jade tablets or blue jade boards, each board nine cun nine fen long, two cun four fen wide, with golden thread characters. Two jade youths and two jade maidens attend, overseeing incense and inspection. According to the Four Extremities’ bright divisions, within a hundred years there shall be such a person to transmit.

The Southern Pole Supreme Origin Lord said: Jade of purest quality is not for the use of worldly men. If one be famed in the regions and sees such writings, they may also engrave them on blue wooden tablets, with golden thread characters, contained in blue brocade bags, burning incense and performing worship for nine years, thereupon celestial truth shall descend and bestow the jade tablet.

The Southern Pole Supreme Origin Lord said: The Supreme Primordial Transformation Registry arises together with the Nine Qi Primordial Caverns. The Most High Jade Emperor, the Supreme Sage Emperor, all form from the qi of the Primordial Cavern to make form, name, and title; their robes, crowns, and colours all arise from the Nine Heavens’ Great Existence prostration and obeisance protocol and from natural spontaneous generation. Heaven has the qi of eight meetings and the movement of the four transformations, governing the jade void, distributing and ordering yin and yang, mysterious transformation governing the beginning, completing the generation of myriad things. The Most High multitudes of sages transform form and light, all following seasonal change, adapting to the cycle and responding to the command, moving and shifting, without decline or old age, ultimate transformation enduring long. Therefore it is said, the Way has no constant name; this is what is meant. The Queen Mother’s virtue rewards the high mysterious, hence the Primordial bestowed the title Cinnabar Emperor, mysteriously granting a pure registry volume, to entrust the later holy immortal disciples to know the Primordial Way and the natural titles, the qi of transformation. Those who see its chapters are recorded in the immortal registers of the Nine Heavens, inscribed in the regions, engraved names upon the Cinnabar Terrace, adding meticulous thought; not beyond nine years, one may obtain and unveil the resting chamber, following seasonal transformation, flying through the Nine Heavens.

The Southern Pole Supreme Origin Lord said: The Way of Supreme Purity and Primordial Transformation Precious Scripture is by preserving thought to cause response, and by swallowing qi to cause meeting. Once one obtains its chapters, one should understand its preservation of thought, the image of primordial transformation, to know its form, colour, light, qi, and literary hue changing with the four seasons. One will arrive without speaking with eyes closed, will meet without drawing qi by swallowing. If within ten years one has not beheld spirits, within ten months one will not have qi filled. Later scholars and sages may diligently refine their thought; then the mysterious void may be named, and connection to immortals may have its means.

The Southern Pole Supreme Origin Lord said: In all cultivating the Way of the Upper Immortals, thinking on spirit and contemplating truth, swallowing qi and swallowing liquid, yet not knowing the title of the Primordial, the root of the four seasons’ transformations of light, image, and qi, only closing eyes in the vast darkness, swallowing emptily without thought, how can spirit and truth descend? How can qi and liquid be filled? Glaring and staring, there is obscurity; much less in the vastness and distance can one distinguish form and qi. This is called vain effort in sleeping and breathing, of no use to empty chanting.

"Emperor opens truth, nine ways unite in brightness, transforming and refining the void, illuminating Supreme Purity, dividing form and transforming light, four movements yielding life, I enjoy its truth, unite with truth’s spirit, internally binding jade immortals, externally entwining eight darknesses, eight lights supporting wings, moving to the cinnabar chariot, riding clouds and driving smoke, guiding Supreme Purity, flying through cloud chambers, paying court at the imperial capital."  

Having finished, raise the head and swallow the nine breaths to cease. Those who know the secret names of the primordial transformations of form and light shall live nine hundred years. Cultivating for nine years and communing with spirits and countenances, one can transform the light and fly through the great void.
