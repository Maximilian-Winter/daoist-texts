### The Scripture of the Seven Sacred Mysterious Records of the Jade Emperor of Supreme Clarity Returning to Heaven's Ninth Heaven

The Supreme Scripture of the Seven Sacred Mysterious Records of the Jade Emperor of Supreme Clarity Returning to Heaven's Ninth Heaven is the scripture by the Most High Holy Emperor Lord, whereby the beginning of the establishment of qi by the Nine Mysteries is described; the void and spirit are divided and adjudicated, the Two Principles are already manifested, the Nine Primes harmonize in accord, the Nine Emperors command the spirits, assembled in the Pavilion of the Radiant Firmament. Thereupon the Most High Holy One, bearing the tablet of the Jade Void and the Purple Guest, returns and encircles the cinnabar heavens and the jade wheel, ascending the nine layers of the seven shining vermilion palaces, lingering above the bright rosy clouds, desolate in the nine voids. The heavenly origin is dark and sluggish, the Three Scenes unite their light, the flowing essences shine in the void, the Eight Assemblies and Four Passages cross and harmonize the truth, whistling and chanting the Great Nothing, the Mysterious Beginning illuminated and clear, the heavenly scenes spread and arrange themselves, the rivers and seas are still in their waves, the Eight Winds raise the wheel, the drifting smoke thickens in the Dragon Pavilion, floating scenes ascend in the Nine Mysteries. The Golden Immortals hold their battle-axes, the Four Officers wield their banners, the Five Emperors and spiritual officials with hundreds of millions of men, flying qilin and feathered steeds are all prepared to guard the heavenly truth. Westward are the Jade Maidens and Golden Morning Spiritual Children, their shining clouds poised at the jade side, containing immortal countenances within the orchid chambers, scattering spiritual incense to repel filth, wafting floral essences with feather dusters. Dragons intertwine and race within the Purple Pavilion, poisonous beasts brandish their claws at the Jade Pass, golden wings stroke their feathers in the jade forests, spiritual cranes fly and chant on the cloud heights. The Western Consort beats time, the heavenly maidens play their bells, dragon roars and tiger howls, phoenix dances and phoenix cries, the Four Truths sing in unison, the Eight Sounds blend their voices, the cloud chimes ring clear, startling the Three Purities, flying songs and mysterious music, grand music fills the empty court, flowing fragrances veil the rosy clouds, the spiritual wind scatters the truth, brilliant light flashes and intertwines, the Three Candles combine their brightness. At this time the Most High Supreme Great Dao Lord, wears the nine-coloured Li Luo cape, robes adorned with flying frost pearls, a crown of a hundred transformations, girds the sword of morning light and sun bell that nurtures and extends, is adorned with the jade seal and phoenix emblem of the interlacing sashes, shining gold illuminating the void, the Seven Essences stirring the limitless, riding the green mist with nine spirits and eight scenic flowing clouds, accompanied by flying immortals who bear the feathered canopies, ten thousand spirits of the mulberry forest, and three hundred thousand purple void children, displaying the nine clouds, returning heaven and tilting light. The heavenly troops march ahead, the six divisions brandish their sharp blades, lightning rushes and spirit flies, the Four Bright Ones support the spirits and open the path, the Five Elders pass through the passes, flying banners on the jade paths, flowing light shining clearly, ascending to the nine layers of the seven shining vermilion palaces. The Dao Lord arranges the seats, the Nine Emperors rejoice together, the Three Truths harmonize, the Seven Sacred Ones share delight, the heavenly music is clear and resonant, the Most High rejoices. The mysterious heart fills the imperial tablet, flying writings flourish upon the celebratory smoke, the spirits are bustling, virtue is void and body mysterious, the dragon pattern shines in the deep abyss, radiant clouds spread to the nine heavens, the lofty appearance is cleansed in the orchid jade, golden essence issues forth from the jade spring, the Seven Records are arranged in the supreme register, clearly engraved in the hidden volumes, the brush deftly employed, the stagnant wheel turns, gathering the Five Phases, assembling the supreme truth, truly the lofty and high transformation to instruct the myriad directions. Thereupon the Seven Sacred authored the chapters of the Supreme Mystery, collected into the Spiritual Text, commanding the Turtle Mother to mark the brush, the Great One to brush the mat, the Heavenly Consort to attend with incense, the Jade Flower to hold the cloth, the cinnabar script and purple characters engraved on silver, the hidden arising spiritual rhyme sealed in the jade volumes, titled in the azure register as the name of the Way attained, entrusted to the Five Elders, Supreme True Immortal Left Duke of the celestial capital, stored in the purple bud jade box, sealed with the chapter of command, with three hundred jade boys and jade girls scattering flowers to attend the spirit. The Seven Sacred each preside over one passage, the Western Turtle determines the record, the Eastern Flower checks the names, summoning the Five Sacred Mountains and myriad Immortals. Later students who have the record of the Three Primes, respectfully record the Azure Palace, yearly making seven selections, listing the names of the Supreme Clarity, all are carved and annotated in the Mysterious Diagram, thus attaining the Supreme True of Peace. This is the celestial sincerity manifesting in the Most High, the bright virtue united in the Three Primes. Therefore the Most High commands and records in jade texts, mysterious contracts and deep chants, the celestial radiance internally fresh, the thorough mystery with lingering rhyme, the rotation of the wheel responding to the mystery, the lofty forms transcending the Three Realms, the cinnabar scene rising to the Supreme True, inscribed upon the white tablets, recorded in the azure script, the enigmatic diagrams most subtle, not to be declared by mere brush and ink, roughly recording one-thousandth part, briefly marking the distant traces of truth.

Returning to Heaven's Ninth Heaven, White Tablets and Azure Registers. The Most High Emperor Lord receives from the Nine Voids, composing flying mysterious purple qi natural characters; the Mysterious Records declare the names of those who attain the Way for later students; the spiritual sounds and rhymes harmonize, jade brightness receives the truth; sometimes by script form, sometimes by hidden sounds, the four assemblies above and below all express the mysterious names born of void; inscribed and written in the hall of broad spirits. The old text has one hundred thousand jade words, the characters without proper form, the rhymes without proper sound; none but the Most High can comprehend their meaning. After accumulation of seven thousand years, inscribed in the chamber of Kunlun, source of the northern cave. Characters one zhang square, the text flourishing and splendid, four sides hanging rays, the voids born with gentle solemnity, as if present and absent, flowing light and purple qi brushing away their filth, golden essence coldly refined polishing the text, thus through many kalpas the script remains distinct. On the seventh day of the ninth month of the first year of the middle sovereign, the Seven Sacred together in spirit, purify the long palace, the golden-green pact with heaven, the hazy mother-mare receives the spiritual text. The Most High smooths its difficulties, the Seven Sacred communicate its wondrous sounds, recording it as the chapter of returning to Heaven's Ninth Heaven and attainment of the Way, engraving it on silver tablets, binding it with flying azure script, storing it in a cloud brocade pouch, sealing it with the chapter of command, entrusting it to the Five Elders of the immortal capital, Left Duke, custodian of the jade palace. According to the Four Extremities bright methods, transmitted once in ten thousand kalpas, checked by the laws of the Four Officers, punished by the divine troops of the Five Emperors. Named the Participating Mystery Tablets, those who obtain this text, if lightly revealed, bring disaster upon their nine clans, examined and burdened by the Seven Mysteries, their own body perishes, long charged by the ghostly officers; though having the mysterious name, they may not enter immortality.

The Seven Sacred Mysterious Records Returning to Heaven upper texts, sometimes harmonizing rhymes, sometimes mutually referring to categories, sometimes using the four assemblies above and below to form characters and sounds, sometimes marking the true taboo names, sometimes combining single and double forms, all arise from the mysterious ancient cave, the Most High composing and collecting to clarify the spiritual text. Later students name and consult the chapters, receiving the treasured formula and naturally becoming high immortals. Yet there are the Six Harmonies, and again the Seven Wounds. Treasure them and they combine, neglect them and they perish. The body is divided; diligent sincerity is needed; long fasting and spiritual abundance; seeking the remote secluded mountains; burning incense and performing rites; chanting scriptures morning and evening; abandoning all miscellaneous thoughts; the mind fixed upon the Great Truth; able to receive mysterious descent; flying soaring by daylight.

All later scholars and disciples, whether their name is not recorded in the mysterious tablets but have fully obtained the treasured scriptures, all have in past lives great virtue and ample protection, passing down to their person; or their body has dark功 [mystic功], their will surpassing the crowd, single-heartedly earnestly seeking, above responding to the Jade Emperor, the Four Extremities reporting, the Five Mountains recording names, meeting a teacher of scriptures, receiving the treasured texts.

All who see the text of the Supreme Mystery Records of the Most High Sacred Ones, all by the mysterious names have divisions of flying immortals, inscribed in the image of the next life, reversely annotating the chapters of the mysterious void, having received the human way, the Azure Palace selects names, the Four Officers protect, the Five Emperors explain, the Jade Void seals and stores, the Purple Network plants roots, the bones have wondrous light, their form raised and joined to immortality, the Four Officers secretly descend, the yin receives the treasured texts, the Great One registers the book, the officers of fate and years, the soul firm and the spirit at peace, the six viscera join the truth, myriad spirits altogether, able to complete the high immortal. Cultivating for seven years, the spirit should descend, riding the void flying.

The Most High Emperor Lord said: All who obtain the Seven Sacred Mysterious Records Returning to Heaven's Ninth Heaven, though not yet ascending, are registered by the Azure Palace selecting names, reported to the Five Mountains, entrusted to the spiritual mountains, rivers, and seas officers to guard their person, with twelve jade boys and twelve jade girls attending and guarding the spiritual texts, reverently carrying out the scriptures truly. This mysterious upright response assembly, the principle accords with nature, the Most High always annotates the true register reversely, ranks according to the immortal ministers; the Four Truths come to the chamber, descending the cloud chariot, commanding the daylight ascension to morning, the rules of bowing and looking up and down, advancing according to rank to immortality.

All hidden texts are the same ancient mysterious void texts, to express those who attain the Way and join immortality. Those who see these texts are all supervised by the Four Extremities, raised by the Five Emperors, myriad spirits attending and guarding, many truths respectfully greeting. Those who know their sounds fly to Supreme Clarity, the Three Primes descend, ascending together with their destinies. Those who wear these texts carve jade tablets in the splendid palace, the Five Emperors supporting and protecting, immortal officials respectfully greeting, their bodies emitting purple qi, their nape having a round radiance, reflecting the void without obscurity, sitting and observing nature, in nine years spiritual descent, the Three Primes entering chambers, spiritual carriages and feathered canopies welcoming destined bodies, flying in the mysterious void, their rank increased to immortal villages. If secret, then spirit descends; if revealed, then body perishes; rash conduct not true, the Seven Ancestors charge, ten thousand kalpas no pardon, self lost and life ends, never again becoming immortal. Those with resolve must be cautious and secret with this text.

The Most High Emperor Lord said: Later students who love and diligently cultivate, benevolent and harmonious, gentle in conduct, their colour fills the four elements, receptive to classes and accommodating, such persons all have mysterious names inscribed in the imperial registers, purple characters sealed in jade volumes, receiving the origin and opening in the divine map, their virtue outstanding in joining immortals, internally responding to the Supreme Ultimate mirror and reflection, externally summing the great craftsman's sect, their merit complete and Dao fulfilled, they naturally ascend by daylight.

The Most High Emperor Lord said: Later students, some have fine skin and hope for immortality, morning diligent and evening lax, internally hoping to soar, externally valuing honour and profit. Some form strict but heart lax, some heart diligent but mouth slow, some study not broad and deep, contending against sect leaders, judging all things, disparaging the worthy and envying sages, loving some and hating others, weak towards friends and strong towards enemies. Some indulge in wine and lust, losing their spirit and essence. Some meet scriptures but do not ally, secretly viewing secrets, lightly diminishing the spirit's secrets, showing themselves different, transmitting without informing, no alliance with the Five Mountains, all are revelations and leakages, violating the four bright tests. Such persons only have the appearance of immortals, their names inscribed in imperial volumes, their conduct contrary to their root, further inviting investigation and punishment, above burdening the Seven Ancestors, their sins extinguish their body, forever losing the Way of immortality, long filling ghostly servitude, revolving through the five sufferings, bitterly lamenting what can be said.

The Most High Immortal Prohibition of the Seven Wounds

All scholars with mysterious records and names, bodies having immortal aspect, naturally joining the truth, yet whose hearts are not firm and upright, suffer the Seven Defeats and Wounds.

The First Wound: Bearing truth but acting falsely, lust and lustfulness disturbing the spirit, consuming fluids and leaking, essence and light drying up, qi scattering and spirit dissipating, bones hollow and form incomplete, spirits weeping in the exhausted mansions, above hearing the heavenly pass, true immortals traveling afar, demons coming to disturb, joining with the dark shadows, mysteriously removing the record, nine prisons forming the cause, six heavens intimate, sinking into endless suffering, how can they again attain immortality?

The Second Wound: External form in the Way, skin fair but mind treacherous, heart holding evil bandits, cruel and hard in nature, wishing others ruin, jealous and envious of the worthy, beautiful words but reverse mind, face joyful but inner anger, judging form by gain and loss, delighting in creating sources of sin, slandering and spying on learning, attacking sect roots, recorded by the Three Officials, marked as evil gate, immortals and truths abandoning, evil ghosts affixing, running as shadow and form, flying embodying spirit, thus causing crookedness and perversity, extremely evil affliction, examination complete form perishes, soul sinks to nine springs, only having mysterious names, how to preserve nature?

The Third Wound: Loving wine and drunkenness, damaging qi and losing spirit, five palaces disrupted and broken, myriad spirits startled, soul and spirit flying apart, inside and outside decaying spirit, original chamber desolate, red children lamenting, true immortals departing high, demon essences entering form; such a form only accumulates earnestness, though having mysterious records, ultimately losing the jade name, spirit confined in six palaces, body ashes in the dark, by this seeking extension, years yet long halted.

The Fourth Wound: Conduct not broad and pure, blaming sect and respect, heart angry and mouth cursing, delighting in strife and contention, anger and joy lacking moderation, nature unstable, qi excited and spirit scattered, inner truth flying away, soul leaving and spirit wandering, bringing disaster and illness, years and life declining; all due to nature; true immortals ascend high, many diseases come to harm, though diligent in learning, not escaping this calamity, hoping for immortality but days long, hell eternal.

The Fifth Wound: Some show mysterious diagrams, receive treasured scriptures, or meet spiritual masters who bestow divine writings, yet do not follow regulations and alliances, form leaking heavenly truth, not passing nine years, throwing themselves into famous mountains, being recorded in the Azure Palace, Golden Pavilion compiling chapters, then transmitting to others, scattered in the world, lightly revealing truth and leaking treasure, examining and binding their own bodies, only having mysterious names, instead burdening the Seven Mysteries, the Way of immortality ascending high, body dying in the dark springs, long filling ghostly responsibilities, ten thousand kalpas no pardon.

The Sixth Wound: Body treading filth, form and shadow not fragrant, inside no purity and void, outside no orchid fragrance, the Way not descending truth, spirits not dwelling in chambers, qi disturbed and essence turbid, spiritual origin losing light, five spirits dispersing, red children flying and soaring, evil demons coming to attack, inside and outside suffering, by this learning and hoping to increase, instead harming, true immortals ascending high, corpse alone walking, sinking and lost without rescue, how can immortality be attained?

The Seventh Wound: Eating flesh containing blood, killing and harming those who provide the delicacies, putrid and fishy filling the viscera, harming life and destroying what is not self, true qi disturbing the spiritual gate, roaming souls frightening red children, soul and spirit departing the chambers, filth and impurity clinging to mouth and teeth, the immortal truth far abandoning in the clouds, one's body sinking deep in the earth, only having mysterious names and imperial tablets, ultimately not escaping form death.

The Most High Emperor Lord said: The basis for learning must urgently consider the Seven Wounds. Once you have seen and inspected the hidden door, read the jade volumes, and do not violate the prohibition of the Seven Wounds, you shall sit awaiting spirit descent, ascending by daylight to morning. If externally diligent in study, yet internally violating the Seven Wounds, this will be hoping for immortality and instead failing, hoping to be born and instead perishing, hoping for good and instead misfortune, hoping to fly and instead sinking; spiritual immortals roam in clear heights, the five spirits on the right scatter in the eight wildernesses, red children crying in the central chamber, roaming souls lamenting in the mysterious void. Therefore immortal aspect has success and failure, higher learning has Seven Wounds; those earnest and devoted must thoroughly refine their truth.

The Most High Emperor Lord said: All who have jade bones and cinnabar writings, names inscribed in imperial maps, obtaining to see the Seven Sacred Mysterious Records. All who have golden marrow and purple stores, names inscribed on golden tablets, obtaining to see the hidden writings inner texts. All who have spiritual marvels and strange hairs, purple membranes and jade nets, names marked Supreme Clarity, obtaining to see the white tablets and jade volumes. All who have flowing essence and purple light, inner reflecting outer spirit, treasured golden countenance, names inscribed in the Jade Void, obtaining to see the azure register writings. All who have divine responsiveness and national uprightness, jade embryo and purple void, names inscribed Eastern Flower, obtaining to see the Seven Wounds inspection texts. Without this uprightness, spiritual chapters cannot be obtained for rash opening, treasured writings cannot be obtained for viewing. Those who see these texts all have mysterious essence joining immortals, nine years cultivation, able to fly in mysterious void, ascending to Jade Pure.

All who receive the Seven Sacred Mysterious Records Returning to Heaven's Ninth Heaven white tablets and azure registers texts, master and disciples fast facing each other for ninety days, or thirty days. Disciples offer seven liang of refined gold, seventy zhang of purple silk, seven liang of cinnabar, going north to the master, reporting to the Most High, making a pact with heaven to transmit. If the master instructs without pact, lightly revealing the treasured texts, disciples receive without faith, recklessly opening the jade volumes, all suffer the trial of the wind knife, the Seven Ancestors charge, three paths and five sufferings, ten thousand kalpas no pardon. The Five Emperor divine troops constantly correct leakage, be clear and cautious in practice.
