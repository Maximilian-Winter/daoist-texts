### The Scripture of the Supreme Three Heavens' True Rites

Composed by the Little Heavenly King of Pure Emptiness

The Nine Heavens' True Kings and the Primordial Heavenly King were both born before the primordial breath (shi qi) began; the light of Heaven was not yet bright, the dense accumulation was not yet clear, the boundless ocean was without limit, chaos and great emptiness prevailed, and the vast sweat flowed obscurely for over seven thousand kalpas. Then the mysterious light began to separate, and the Nine Breaths existed therein; the interval between one breath and the other was ninety-nine thousand nine hundred and ninety years. The Youthful Lord said: At that time, there was no reckoning of years; the Nine Breaths existed already, and the interval between one breath and another was ninety-nine thousand nine hundred and ninety li, one li corresponding to one year. The pure breath was lofty and clear, the turbid and mixed spread below. The Nine Heavens' True Kings and the Primordial Heavenly King, inheritors of the natural lineage, were set in the title of the Nine Heavens. The Nine Heavens' True Kings and the Primordial Heavenly King were all first born amid the Nine Breaths, their energies coagulating into form. The Nine Breaths were profoundly condensed, formed in the diagram of the Nine Heavens. The sun, moon, stars, and constellations then shone forth, all revolving and traversing within the realm of the Nine Heavens. 

Then there came the Emperors of the Nine Truths. The Youthful Lord said: The Nine Truths are the pure breaths of the Nine Heavens, condensed to form the positions of the Nine Palaces. The Upper Truth, Middle Truth, and Lower Truth were born in the highest Pure and Subtle Heaven; the Pure and Subtle Heaven is the clarity of the primordial breath. The next three Truths were born in the Heaven of Yu Yu; the Heaven of Yu Yu is the clarity of the original breath. The lower three Truths were born in the Third Great Vermilion Heaven; the Great Vermilion Heaven is the clarity of the mysterious breath. When the three appellations became manifest, the Three Primal Ladies were born from the breath; Heaven was their father, breath their mother; hence they are called the Three Primal Lords of the Great Essence. Each was born naturally from the breath. Born of the Three Primal Lords, all bear titles of women. The Youthful Lord said: The White Essence Lord is the mother of the Right White Lord; the Yellow Essence Lord is the mother of the Yellow Elder Central Lord; the Purple Essence Lord is the mother of the Left No-Shadow Lord. They formed empty wombs, relying on breath to be born. Each was assigned a palace and residence, and thus came the officials of the Upper Purity's military encampments. Three thousand Golden Mornings and Jade Youths, three thousand Western Flower Jade Maidens attended on the Three Primal Ladies in the bridal chamber palace. 

The three paths flourished, and all bore the title of Supreme Great Dao Lords. The Supreme Great Dao Lords are the emperors of all truths, their positions high and their breath pure; thus they bear the title Supreme. All are descendants inheriting the truth of breath, receiving titles by degrees, not that there was but one Supreme in the beginning Heaven. Those who receive the title Supreme become leaders of myriad spirits. They are placed in jeweled palaces and jade halls, dwelling in the Supreme, lords of the Great Dao, presiding over the Nine Heavens, and next in rank over the eight directions. The eight directions have eight emperors; thus, the Upper Three Heavens have twenty-four emperors, including the Jade Sovereign. The eight emperors all inherit natural lineage and receive the title of emperor; this is not the task of later scholars.

Each then traced their inheritance and composed the chapter of the Supreme Sovereigns as a treasured scripture, kept secret in the Palace of Jade Clarity, to aid later scholars who attain the truth. Upon the Yellow Emperor there was established the governance of the people, and later generations arose from the Yellow Emperor. The Yellow Emperor shaped the earth as a symbol and placed it upon the broad wilderness. Within three hundred years, five colours changed and there were those who could speak and converse, each governing a direction; hence there were the tribes of Cang, Qin, Di, Yi, Man, and Cha. When the five surnames combined virtue, also following nature, inheriting the breath of the Upper Truth, they became human. They had the measure of life and death and the span of their years. If one had the bone breath connected to the truth, one would be immortal and attain the supplement of the upper immortals; if one’s conduct was not pure, one would die and return to the earth.

The slow-moving beings clothed in original breath wore garments of five colours, all born from original breath and clad in five-coloured robes. The governance of the Six Heavens arose from this. Therefore, the Supreme Great Dao Lords were given ghost soldiers to drive out wicked men during the Three Dynasties. The Youthful Lord said: The Yellow Emperor created the people, but they all began to kill and harm one another, not receiving the natural breath, which angered the heavenly breath, causing disorder in the Three and Five (phases). Hence the breath of the Six Heavens was used to punish the wicked people. Those who act virtuously and diligently, who think of long life and do not offend the Three Officials, are the seed people and shall be given the true scripture.

When the two breaths separate and unite, the principle of things has its period. Yang Nine spreads breath, One Hundred and Six resolves calamities. The Three Paths wax and wane, revolving and giving birth, their term ending in the years of Renchen and Guisi. The Youthful Lord said: The Great Yang Nine and the Great Hundred and Six each last nine thousand nine hundred years; the Lesser Yang Nine and Lesser Hundred and Six each last three thousand three hundred years. The Six Heavens received their titles until the Zhou, by now three cycles of the Great Yang Nine; yet good and evil still are not equal. The Later Sage, the Lord of Nine Profound Dao, inquired of the Supreme about the time of non-response; the Supreme said: The affairs of the Six Heavens are arranged by the Supreme True; seeking the Nine Scriptures of Yang Nine, One Hundred and Six, to return to govern the Three Heavens. The term is calculated to the years of Tang, under the Jin clan’s reign, the end of Dinghai, the year of Renchen; then good and evil shall be made clear, and fortune and misfortune decided.

The Nine Heavens' True Kings bestowed upon the Supreme Great Dao Lord the texts of the Supreme Subtle Spiritual Metropolis and the Wanyuan True Three Directions Scripture, the numerous books and true registers to regulate the laws of the Six Heavens and Three Heavens. The True Rites of the Three Heavens were given by the Nine Heavens' True Kings and the Primordial Heavenly King at the beginning of receiving breath in the empty mysterious space. The law of governance of the Six Heavens was given to the Supreme. When the Yellow Emperor arose to govern, the Supreme entrusted it to later imperial lords, the Prime Minister Youthful Lord, and the Western City Lord, to entrust to those who become true men. By the breath of the Six Heavens and the law of the Three Heavens, those who obtain it become spirits and immortals.

The Three Heavens' Nine Subtle Mysterious Metropolis Supreme True Spiritual Registers issued from the Nine Heavens' True Kings, transmitted to the Supreme and then to the Jade Emperor of the Three Heavens. The Primordial Heavenly King gave them to the Queen Mother of the West; Lingfei, the Supreme True Supreme Elder, gave them to the many immortals who attained the Dao and became true men. This text is kept secret in the Palace of the Supreme Spiritual Metropolis, carved on purple jade tablets with golden characters, entrusted to the Five Elders, the Supreme True Immortal Capital Left Duke, sealed in a purple-tinged jade case and contained in a pouch of cloud brocade. The Heavenly Consort attends with incense, the Jade Flower carries the towel, guarded by three hundred Golden Boys each. Thus, the Later Sage, the Imperial Lord of the Golden Gate, and the Prime Minister Youthful Lord, all thrice monthly, during the period of pure fasting, ride the azure mist on the nine spiritual flowing luminous clouds, accompanied by the blue feathered canopy, through the Mulberry Grove of a thousand truths, ascending to the Palace of the Supreme Spiritual Metropolis to pay homage to the True Father and enjoy festivities in the jade court.

The Supreme Great Dao Lord at times with the Nine Profound Holy Lord and the Prime Minister Youthful Lord ascend together within the jeweled palace and jade hall, attended by thousands of millions of maidens of truth. Flying dragons and poisonous beasts guard the spiritual passes; giant serpents reach a thousand fathoms, brandishing claws over the broad court; streams of light shine clearly, dazzling the jade purity, suspended on banners and canopies, with floating flags surrounding incense; jade pipes chant emptily; the divine forest stirs with sound; ten thousand echoes raise the voice; the nine origins are open; the multitude blows cloud songs; the unicorn dances and the phoenix cries; all stir the jade void, the jade vibrates the Three Purities, setting forth streams of rosy dew, the fruit of hard rings, and a mixed array of vessels fall; the flowing gaze reaches the great darkness.

Then the Supreme himself takes up the cloud flute zither, strokes it and plays it; the jade sound is splendid, resounding through the highest heavens, chanting the ode of the divine phoenix and the tune of the nine spirits. Its words are:

"Subtle are the Nine Profound Breaths, the source opening the dregs of the Three Purities. Spirit transformation follows the course of fate; the abyss resounds through lofty imitations. The six senses open the mysterious gates; without awakening, the path only begins. Holding the robe in the jade emperor’s court, unveiling the principle of great emptiness. Purple radiance shines on the mysterious terrace, reflecting endlessly. The great kalpa has a final number; the One Hundred and Six suddenly arise. Divine delight is without age; it soothes the sorrow of later born children."

Then the Supreme finished singing; the Nine Profound Emperor Lords named themselves and sang:

"Driving the reins of the nine dragons, attending the jade emperor’s court. The great void’s Nine Profound Breath, its law and transformation sink into the Three Spirits. The high assembly at the mysterious dawn gate, personally ordered by the Primordial Essence. Binding the radiance at the great rosy pavilion, gazing endlessly at long life. The spirit shines through the hidden gates, refining the embryo back to original form. Soothing the sorrow of the five turbid children, their fate shared with the floating morning birth."

Then the Nine Profound Holy Lords finished singing; the Prime Minister Youthful Lord named himself and sang. His words were:

"The Nine Heavens’ hollow original record, transforming and producing boundless breath. The Three Spirits clarify the mysterious light; the six essences follow their course and pass away. The cinnabar sky veils the hollow void; the three truths transcend boundlessness. Gazing up and down the Supreme Emperor’s hall, inheriting the law of the Three Heavens. Driving away and cleansing the six heavens’ misfortunes, establishing uprightness without dust or filth. Thoroughly probing the Supreme True chapters to save those who inherit Tang’s world. Enlightening the late learners with heart, matching the obscure covenant. Plucking free from the three sufferings, quickly controlling the dragon reins. The serene pavilion of Upper Purity, who would perceive any lingering obstruction?"

When the songs ended, the Supreme with the Later Sage Nine Profound and the Prime Minister Youthful Lord jointly arranged the True Rites of the Three Heavens purging the Six Heavens' text, applying the precious talismanic incantations and offering rites according to regulations, entrusting the two lords to teach later disciples who become true men, to regulate the Six Heavens and punish the evil hordes. Then the Emperor Lords and the Prime Minister Youthful Lord respectfully received the true formulae, kowtowed, and returned.

The Little Heavenly King of Pure Emptiness said: Whoever receives the many texts of the Three Heavens’ Nine Subtle Mysterious Metropolis Supreme True Yin-Yang Spiritual Registers must always with focused mind and diligent thought enter a chamber to burn incense, petition the true spirits, seek to receive and welcome the holy lords at the Upper Purity Palace, and constantly recite the spiritual chapters and talismanic scriptures once. Thus for nine years the spirit will announce a response, and the Supreme shall surely send a Supreme Ultimate True Man to descend into the disciple’s sleeping chamber.

The Supreme instructed the Later Sage Lord: Whoever comes to the scripture master to receive texts must face north to make an oath and transmit to disciples. The disciple, after receiving the texts, must turn east and make nine bows, which may be done with heart only, and recite a secret petition:

"Above, I open to the Nine Heavens’ True Kings, the Primordial Heavenly King, and the Supreme Great Dao Lord. I, born in the latter age, distant from the highest mystery, inherit the true succession, and receive the True Rites of the Three Heavens purging the Six Heavens’ text, overwhelmed with joy and celebration. I respectfully relate this above, beseeching the true truth, granting the descent of true spirits, might to command the ten directions, to govern myriad essences, to roar forth and stand present, to raise a sound piercing the darkness, to receive the eight illuminations, and to welcome the holy lords."

When finished, the scripture is copied once, placed in a separate chamber, with incense burned morning and evening, and the talismanic scriptures worshipped. The Supreme will dispatch ten Jade Boys and ten Jade Maidens to attend and guard the wearer.

The Supreme instructed the Later Sage Lord: Whoever has the bone form and is named participant of Donghua, receives to wear the true talismanic texts of the Three Heavens’ Supreme many texts. Nine years hence, on their natal day or the year of the Grand Duke, a complete talisman written in white and cinnabar is to be taken to the mountain they belong to and buried, to regulate the breath of the Five Mountains and myriad spirits. At burial, one must face north and knock the teeth thrice, raising a petition:

"The Six Heavens revolve; the Three Paths are upright and clear; the upper immortal true texts govern the Nine Spirits; sealing and holding the Five Mountains; recording and gathering myriad spirits. The present true immortal comes to my form; reporting to myriad gods; recording and distinguishing my name; washing away a thousand heresies; later ascending to Jade Clarity."

Then the text is buried deeply nine feet. Thus for twenty-seven years, combining three burials, the Supreme can dispatch the Four Extremities True Men to welcome the body to the Upper Purity Palace. The Five Mountain Spirit Officers must always guard and patrol, granting natural pleasures, clouds, chariots, and feathered carriages to welcome the body.

You, having received nine years, on your natal or Grand Duke’s day at midnight, in a separate chamber, with people silent and still, dew on the courtyard, must sit facing north, placing five tables to the five directions; one with incense and fire, one with a handkerchief covered over. Also place a three-foot crimson patterned cloth, the scriptures and talisman upon the table, with a plate of fruit, one sheng of dates, all placed in a basket. Facing north, bow twice, knock your teeth twelve times, and petition the Nine Subtle Eight Paths Supreme Emperors, the Nine Blossom Emperors, the Profound Yellow Ladies, the Nine Spirits Officials, and the Overseer of Truth, stating your name and that you once received the numerous scriptures of the Eight Spirits’ True Talismans. After nine years you petition to offer subtle rites, present to the many truths, hoping for their descent and acceptance of your sincere heart, to make your form clear in breath and bright, commanding the ten directions, subduing a thousand evils and myriad heresies, all seized and subdued, gaining spiritual communion. At the completion of nine years, you shall again petition to make manifest the truth. Thus concluded. The offerings of fruit and dates are buried at the mountain to which you belong, buried nine feet deep. At burial, facing north, knock teeth nine times, and recite the incantation:

"Heaven pure above, subtle path distant and remote, the Three Righteous principles revolve, the Six Breaths sink and vanish. The upper true spiritual talisman governs myriad heresies, offering rites to the Five Spirits, beseeching acceptance and summoning, sealing and returning to the spiritual mountain. May my body with the mountain rest in unity."

Pour the remaining offerings above. Three such sacrifices complete, the Supreme can dispatch True Men, granting you the title of Primal Lord, and the Five Mountain Immortal Spirits shall guard your body.

The Supreme informed the Later Sage Nine Profound Emperor Lord: You receive the title of Upper Clarity Golden Gate Later Sage Emperor Lord, ascending to Upper Clarity, passing through the great pole, governing the Ten Heavens, sealing and ruling myriad beings, including the heavens, rivers, seas, divine mountains, and earthly sources, inspecting the spirits below, all under your governance, diligently seeking the upper truth, assisting the rectification of the Three Heavens, extinguishing evil. Now the numerous texts of the Eight Spirits’ True Talismans are issued to you; you should be diligent, granting them to bone divisions, to be holy rulers, to eliminate heresies and restore the Three Heavens, so that by the years of Tang, the year of Renchen, our Way shall prevail.

The Supreme told the Later Sage Lord: Whoever receives the Three Heavens’ True Rites must establish efficacy for the Three Heavens, assist the era to remove evil, cause the right path to flourish and be clear, and the Six Heavens to perish. They must always bathe and purify, enter the chamber to burn incense, write true texts and spiritual talismans five times, place them in the five directions of the chamber where they reside, their body in the centre, sitting evenly facing north, knocking left teeth thirty-six times; closing eyes, inwardly contemplate the breath emitted from oneself, transforming the breath into a stream of fiery light, filling the heavens and obscurity; burning and consuming all directions, the mountains, forests, grasses, earth, spirits, officials, and people, entirely clearing away, till the heavens are dark and obscure, the fiery breath all consumed, the pure breath flourishing; above there is no heaven, below no earth; all beneath heaven return their root to emptiness; the golden gates, jade towers, jeweled palaces, purple halls, and one’s own body all dwell in the void, inside the pure breath. Then raise a petition:

"Heaven’s yang, earth’s stirring, the Three and Five and spirits, flowing light to the utmost edge, filling the heavens with obscurity, from below without outside, all returns to formlessness. The Six Heavens’ myriad heresies, none are unequal; the Great One urges the course; the true Way shall prevail; the Nine Heavens command; seizing and gathering all born beings; revolving heaven encompassing earth, none is halted; the holy emperor’s manifest canopy controls the purple court, examining the ten directions, presenting memorials to Jade Clarity." 

When finished, draw in the breath of the five directions, swallow it, then draw in the Nine Breaths and stop.

This is the petition of the Nine Heavens, given by the Nine Heavens' True Kings to the Supreme, who gives it to the Later Sage, commanding them to constantly practise, govern the Six Heavens, and command myriad spirits. If one can diligently focus the mind, and attend closely to the Three Officials, assisting Heaven in removing evil, in an age of great peace the Supreme will naturally inspect and regulate therein, following the diligence to supplement and employ the true immortals.

The Supreme instructed the Later Sage Lord: Whoever receives the Three Heavens’ True Rites, wearing the true texts, must always bathe and wash as a matter of urgency, always keep one’s clogs, shoes, and garments clean and pure, not allowing impurity; for the true spirits keep at a distance, and evil spirits ride on impurity to cause ruin. Practitioners should understand and be cautious. Those who violate this prohibition, the Supreme Ultimate Leader of Immortals will withdraw and remove their rank and promotion among the true.

The Supreme instructed the Later Sage Lord: Whoever receives the Three Heavens’ True Rites must not enter places of filth and concealment rashly; must not weep or shed tears in grief, nor mourn the dead. Those who violate this lose and are removed from rank and promotion among the true.

The Supreme instructed the Later Sage Lord: Whoever receives the Three Heavens’ True Rites, wearing the true texts, when going in and out at the three lights (heavenly times) and at night’s rest, must not expose their head without wearing a cap or turban, nor undress to reveal the form, nor insult the form and spirit, nor shame the true texts, causing the noble spirit to depart and leaving an empty corpse alone. Those who violate this prohibition lose their count and are removed from rank and promotion among the true. Practitioners, be cautious.

The Supreme instructed the Later Sage Lord: Whoever receives the Three Heavens’ True Rites must not rashly sleep or sit on the same bed with yin families; nor wear the same clothes with those whose breath is different; nor share bedding and rest; nor intermix clogs or shoes. Those who violate this lose their count and are removed from rank among the true. Practitioners, be cautious.

The Supreme instructed the Later Sage Lord: Whoever receives the Three Heavens’ True Rites, gathering and binding myriad spirits, commanding and pacifying the Six Heavens, must first make themselves pure and tranquil, solemn and upright, not violating the prohibitions. The true spirits will always be respectful, myriad gods will guard the form. When practising the rites, the evil of the Six Heavens naturally declines and withdraws, and will not harm your right path. If you make yourself unclear and are carried by myriad heresies, on the day of punishment you will not have cause to lament this scripture. Practitioners, be cautious.

The Supreme instructed the Later Sage Lord: These five articles come from the eleventh chapter of the "Four Extremities Bright Rules." The Jade Boys attend and guard; those who wear it and violate prohibitions are reported by the Jade Boys, their bodies punished in the underworld, calamity striking seven mysteries. For this reason they are copied here to show later learners; those who wear them should practise accordingly.

The Supreme instructed the Later Sage Lord: Whoever obtains the talismanic writings of the Three Primal Lords Purple Text shall be given twelve Jade Boys and twelve Jade Maidens to attend and guard the wearer. Whoever obtains the many true talismans of the scriptures shall be given ten Jade Boys to attend and guard the wearer. Whoever obtains the Supreme Subtle Spiritual Metropolis Wanyuan True Three Directions Text shall be given thirty straight talismans and twelve Jade Maidens to attend and guard the wearer. Whoever obtains the Heavenly Emperor Lord’s Compassionate True Scripture shall be given ten Jade Boys to attend and guard the wearer. Whoever obtains the Supreme Primal Lord’s True Text shall be given twelve Jade Maidens to attend and guard the wearer. Whoever obtains the Purple Subtle Mysterious Palace Jade Text Flying Divine True Scripture shall be given twenty-four Jade Boys and twenty-four Jade Maidens to attend and guard the wearer. Whoever obtains the Penglai High Supreme True Scripture shall be given twelve Jade Boys to attend and guard the wearer. Whoever obtains the Heavenly Emperor Elder Lord Yellow Supreme True Scripture shall be given one hundred Jade Maidens to know fortune and misfortune. Whoever obtains the Mysterious Continent Immortal Elder Open Heaven Ten Thousand Immortals True Scripture shall be given twelve Jade Boys to attend and guard the wearer. Whoever obtains the Broad Life Supreme True Five Mountains Military Talisman shall be given twelve Jade Maidens to attend and guard the wearer. Whoever obtains the Primordial Heavenly King True Scripture, which issues and does not receive, shall be given twelve Jade Boys and twelve Jade Maidens to attend and guard the wearer.

The Supreme instructed the Later Sage Lord: All who have bone divisions, called Donghua, recorded in the Upper Purity, who receive the many true talismanic scriptures, shall be given Jade Boys and Maidens to attend and guard themselves, recording merits and virtues, correcting prohibitions and leakages. Those who wear them must not transmit them recklessly; those who transmit not being their own person or not according to the term, lightly leaking the treasured texts, shall have their bodies judged by the wind blade, lose their lives to ghost officers, and calamity shall strike the seven mysteries and ancestors; the mountain stone shall cover their fate, the river of nine sources be blocked, and they must carefully and solemnly observe and practise.

The True Rites of the Upper Purity purging the Six Heavens, the Three Heavens’ True Rites, were received by the Later Sage Lord from the Supreme, collected by the Little Heavenly King of Pure Emptiness, and the Upper Immortal True Registers. All are called the Six Heavens Text and Three Heavens Supreme True Rites, to catch myriad ghosts and bind myriad evils. Transmitted thrice in seven hundred years, there are those in a hundred years who may receive it again.

Vermilion and azure threads thirty feet long are the essential trust; blue cloth forty-three feet long is the secret oath; five pairs of golden rings are the great oath pointing to Heaven. Men receiving the investiture must not fail to offer sacrifice; women receiving it must offer sacrifice. When passing it on, a fast of three or seven days is required. Also, during the fast, there is a scripture master to whom ten taels of gold are offered as the trust of spirit communication. Those who leak or do not follow the rules will be judged for seven generations, as per the Four Extremities rules.

Those who wear the scriptures but do not enter the Yin breath, the Yin breath being turbid and muddy, then their bodies suffer great punishment and after death become lower ghosts. If observed according to the law, they surely ascend to Upper Purity. The Eight Emperors regard this as the secret immortal certificate; those who have it call it the Taiyin Scripture Jade Tablet.

Thus ends the Scripture of the Supreme Three Heavens’ True Rites.
