# The Supreme Cave-Truth Purple Script Red Chapter

Name: The Supreme Cave-Truth Purple Script Red Chapter. The author is unknown, roughly dating from the Eastern Jin. Originally it formed one chapter within the Jade Purity Secret Writings, but was later separated out as a single tract. The base edition is found in the Zhengyi section of the Daoist Canon.

The Supreme Cave-Truth Purple Script Red Chapter

Also called the Nine Heavens Jade Purity Green-Character Secret Script

The Purple Script Red Chapter Green-Character Secret Script, comprising one hundred and twenty words, is the qi above the Nine Heavens. It condenses the essence of purple radiance, forming a natural chapter, visibly manifesting in the Jade Purity Palace. Its writing shines brilliantly, illuminating the Supreme Clarity; the Supreme Exalted annotates it, communicating its secret sounds, by which it governs the Jade Void, ordains the Nine Heavens, constantly controls awe-inspiring spirits, and summons the true to inspect the numinous. It is the amulet worn by the Primordial Heavenly King, transmitted to the Jade Purity Sovereign, the Demon-Dispelling Great King, the Jade Purity God-of-Heavenly-Spirits King, and others. Attending upon the script are twenty-four Jade Boys and twenty-four Jade Maidens, who correct the faults of negligence, organizing the guards who wear the script on their persons. Those who obtain this amulet become true to the Nine Heavens, their name inscribed on the Red Altar, their rank reaching the High Profound; their bodies emit purple light, their necks bear the Round Radiance, they roam the Great Void, the Ten Realms conduct their reception, and the Three Primes descend to feast together on the celestial carriage.

In cultivating the Way of the Divine Immortals, when reciting the Supreme Jade Purity Secret Writings of the Great Cave-Truth Scripture, you should seat yourself upon a square platform; with heart reflecting upon the Purple Script Red Chapter, holding in the left hand the flowing-gold fire-bell, and in the right guiding the Seven Primes of the Release and Falling; then the Jade Void will descend without invitation, the Great Cave will open without knocking, myriad true ones will respond to the occasion and assemble, multitudes of demons confine themselves and perish of their own accord. Employing the eight qi to govern the wheel, revolving the five stars, commanding and bestowing life upon myriad spirits, directing and guiding the multitudes of immortals, qi unites with the High Void, the form raises the Purple Guest. The secret profundities of the Nine Heavens, the secret script of Jade Purity, if this chapter be disclosed, the body is struck by the wind-blade, subjected to the test of the Seven Mysteries of Life and Death, just as with the Nine Heavens Covenant Text.

There is gold inscribed with jade characters, setting forth a chart of the Nine Heavens. Whoever attains to see this text should spread a three-foot square of crimson-patterned silk as ground, and with a purple brush write the Red Chapter upon the silk. Carry the Purple Script of ninety feet, with golden fish and jade dragons, to the master’s pure fasting chamber for ninety days, facing north to announce the covenant to the Nine Heavens and transmit it. The disciple who receives it should carry it in a brocade pouch upon the breast. Those who wear the Purple Script Red Chapter attain rank equal to the High Profound, receive the Jade Purity Secret Writings, rank equal to the Great Truth; in sitting, rising, and sleeping, they intertwine with the Jade Void; the Jade Radiance guards the true ones upon left and right; the Five Emperors appear in their sleeping pavilion. They must not mingle with the common world, nor be sullied among the High Truths. If transgressed, the spirit departs whilst the demon advances; the test is met and immortality is lost.

To wear the Purple Script Red Chapter, at times of entering, resting, and walking the Way, one should always first think that one’s body is suffused with the light of purple radiance, the mystery covers above, qi encircles the body; then knock the teeth nine times in succession, and softly utter the prayer:

Jade Void ninefold,  
Purple Radiance eightfold entwined,  
Mystic Light hangs down and shines,  
Jade Purity exhales its dew,  
Purple Script Red Writings,  
Manifesting the Nine Heavens,  
Ordaining myriad spirits,  
Summoning and directing multitudes of immortals,  
Awe-inspiring ten thousands,  
Inspecting and pruning thousands,  
Sounds resound and assemble,  
Five Clouds send forth smoke,  
Flying chariot and purple canopy,  
Suddenly come before me,  
Grant me to ride on the void,  
High ascend to the Jade Morning.

When finished, draw in the twelve throat points of the purple qi to a stop. After nine years thus, one will have the canopy of purple clouds, covering and reflecting upon the body; the body will produce purple light, shining clearly in all directions, communicating with spirits and summoning the true, piercing through and perceiving the Great Void.

Formerly, the Lady of the Upper Origin bestowed the secret script upon the Jade Maiden of Great Harmony; the Jade Maiden of Great Harmony transmitted it to the Young Yang Lord, who accomplished the Way and ascended to the Void, sealing the text in the cave chamber of Nine Peaks, to be given after seven hundred years to one who unites truth and penetrates mystery. Later students who are refined in thought will naturally respond and be fated to receive it beforehand.
