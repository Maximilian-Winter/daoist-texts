## The Supreme Jade Scripture of Flight through the Nine Mornings

The Supreme Great Dao Lord addressed the Northern Pole True Lord, saying: In former times I revolved among the northern heavens, guiding the chariot to the Vast Cold, my feet stepping upon the Flowery Canopy, my hands pushing aside the Nine Origins, roaming the Cloud Palace of Evasion, playing in the Northern Mystery, at ease within the Pavilion of the Northern Yin, admiring the Gate of the Penetrating Brush, turning the Celestial Gnomon to summon the appointed times, hastening the kalpa meetings with dancing transmissions, sighing over the decay of myriad things, bowing to the long subsistence of Heaven and Earth. Then I perceived the wondrous subtleties of the Nine Stars, and comprehended the utmost spirit of the Dipper Chief.

The Nine Stars are indeed the spiritual roots of the Nine Heavens, the bright beams of the sun and moon, the primordial sources of myriad beings. Therefore, Heaven having nine vital airs, regards the Nine Stars as their fine spirits; Earth having nine continents, regards the Nine Stars as their divine lords; man having nine orifices, regards the Nine Stars as the mansions of his destiny; Yin and Yang having nine palaces, regards the Nine Stars as their portals; the Five Great Mountains and the Four Seas, regard the Nine Stars as their deep reservoirs. The arrangement of the Five and Nine is perfect, the framework is unending, controlling the celestial mansions, revolving the three stars, regulating the four and five, ensuring Heaven and Earth endure, the source of myriad beings, the reliance of spirits and immortals.

If Heaven were without the Nine Stars, there could be no clear brightness; if Earth were without the Nine Stars, there could be no supreme spirit; if man were without the Nine Stars, the nine orifices would not be clear. The Supreme Emperor unites them with the True Way; spirits and immortals rely on them to attain accomplishment; the Five Elements ride upon them to achieve measure; myriad things receive their life from them. When Heaven is pure and Earth tranquil, the Nine Stars shine brightly; when Heaven is agitated and Earth obstructed, the Nine Stars are veiled and dim. The Celestial Gnomon summons the kalpa's appointed time, the Heavenly Gates move the vital airs of the Five Elements, transmit the great spokes of the void cavern, hasten the response meetings of the Nine Heavens.

Therefore the divine light revolves and burns, mysteriously overseeing myriad lives, moving beside their appointed stations, to announce disaster and auspice. Thus Heaven and Earth have great transmissions and exchanges, the one hundred and six correspondences and signatures—all are the turning and final calculations of the Nine Stars, by which Yin and Yang wax and wane, the two airs obstruct and stimulate, Heaven overturns and Earth transforms, the Nine Seas become one dark unity, gold and jade transmute and vanish, not a speck is lost. All returns to the Nine Stars, all hastens by the Celestial Gnomon.

Illumining the function of Heaven and Earth, the wondrous framework’s subtlety, he who attains the midst thereof has empty permanence and hidden steps, conceals the radiance and escapes the form, transforms the three stars, and all things are established. The black point disappears and sinks, twenty-five names, their tendencies subtle and profound, secret and not transmitted below. Above are the Nine Morning Splendid Lords, within are the Nine Sovereign Ladies, souls, spirits, and essences, all the majestic powers of the Nine Dipper, emitting the brilliance of the Seven Luminaries, streaming and reflecting at the gates of the Nine Heavens, penetrating the profound void, nothing is not revealed.

Their star yang rays are flowing golden fire bells; their yin rays are the falling Seven Origins—all are the exalted spiritual strategies, the primordial sovereign’s majestic inscriptions. The Dragon flies the secret of the Measuring Rod, hidden and tabooed mouth to mouth, arrayed beneath the embroidered morning silks. The Lamb’s Sore worships Heaven to summon the True; thus the mysterious light curves and shines in the covenant place, the Nine Mornings descend upon the spiritual palace, the ladies rejoice upon the resting mats, the mysterious Dipper records names in the hidden books.

Whoever knows this Way, preserving it is enough to escape the great kalpa meeting, to cross the great flood on Jia Shen year. Cultivating it for twenty-seven years, one may obtain peaceful swan wings and soar aloft, repel the Purple Firmament and ascend the morning. This is the supreme Way of Jade Purity, not comparable to the Middle Immortals of Shangqing. Jade Purity is the highest truth of Shangqing; Shangqing is the highest god of Taiqing; Taiqing is the highest spirit of the flying immortals. Whoever follows the Way of Jade Purity, when going forth is attended by the heavens, given three thousand jade boys and girls each, establishing the tri-seven colored festivals, riding the purple cloud flying car with twelve jade wheels, led before by phoenix song, followed behind by the mysterious Jun, six masters opening the road, flying dragons as wings to the chariot, their rank equals the high immortals, arranged in the maps of Jade Purity.

Whoever follows the Way of Shangqing, when going forth is attended by five constellations as guards, given one thousand five hundred jade boys and girls each, establishing the purple fur festival, riding the flying cloud cinnabar carriage, led before by phoenix and luan horn, followed behind by heavenly jun music, the mysterious dragon opens the way, the five emperors join the carriage; their rank equals the left and right ministers of Shangqing.

Whoever follows the Way of Taiqing, when going forth is attended by the five emperors as guards, given eight hundred jade boys and girls each, establishing the five-color festival, riding the dragon carriage flying mist, led before by nine phoenix whistles, followed behind by eight luan horns, the white jiu opens the way, Tai Shuan joins the carriage. Thus among the True there is high and low, among the mysterious there is order. The Way of Jade Purity is profound and distant, not comparable to the Middle Truth and the flying immortals.

The supreme method of the Nine Stars’ upper law and mysterious reflection, I formerly received from the Primordial Beginning; through seven hundred million kalpas, Heaven and Earth have risen and fallen, orders have declined and perished, yet this Way alone survives. Even now it is cultivated above the cloud scenery, and cannot be forgotten at the appointed seasons. Therefore I delight in this Way’s high subtlety, cherish the ladies’ reception and greeting. How much more for those who in this life begin to learn the flight and peaceful conduct, but know not the secret of searching the void and stepping the emptiness? How can they open the gates of the highest clouds, and behold the beginning and end of Heaven and Earth? Without this Way, estranged from the Nine Mornings, the ladies’ companionship is severed. Only having the mysterious title of Imperial Record, soaring and transcendent, one may steer the cloud dragon and roam the five mountains, but only without death. Thus to hope to tread the Dipper Chief, to revolve through the Splendid Morning, to soar in Jade Purity’s radiance, will be without appointed time.

You now must govern the kalpa’s transmission, seal and hold the ten celestial registers and mysterious records, regulate and judge the spirits and immortals. You should receive this method, to oversee myriad lives. Now I entrust it to you, keep it secret and cultivate it.

Whoever cultivates the flying steps of the seven origins and the Way of the Nine Stars without these songs and chapters must not rashly ascend the heavenly framework nor tread the Mysterious Dipper. To violate the Nine Stars is to seize the soul and spirit, closing beneath the framework of the Dipper; it causes madness and loss of nature, wrath and folly arise; within three years none escape death. The Way does not wish men to attain immortality, but men do not understand the origin of the Way. How could one not proceed cautiously!

The Nine Stars are the roots of the Nine Heavens, the bright essence of Jade Purity, the nine souls are the bright spirits of the Nine Stars. Men only know the subtlety of stepping the seven stars but not the utmost spirit of the nine stars’ souls and spirits. Not for the seven stars does one wish to move men to the Dipper, but the body’s soul and spirit fear the spirit of the Dipper stars and dare not follow men in soaring aloft. Whoever desires to cultivate the flying steps ought to know the souls and spirits of the Dipper stars, the Nine Sovereign Ladies’ inner secrets of empty permanence.

According to the diagram practice, how could one not fly and ascend the Northern Origin, paying homage at the Splendid Morning? But this Way is most subtle, the precious secret of Jade Purity not practiced, few among the middle immortals obtain it. Knowing its method, the Nine Stars reflect within, the Ladies descend to the seat, the Dipper soul is pleased, and together they raise the omen and enter the inner palace of the Nine Origins.
