### Diagram of the Seven Primal Constants

The Way of Flying the Five Stars consists in tracing steps through the five stars Water, Wood, Fire, Earth, and Metal, to bring down the spirit of cloud and feathered canopy, and to ascend the steps of the Grand Mystery. The method of Gu Xi-zi is to close the breath and ascend the stem, going back and forth fifteen times. At each arrival at a star, the left hand pats the heart, and silently utters a blessing: “The Five Stars arrayed and shining, so and so.” Before ascending the stem, one first stores the quintessence of the Five Stars within the five viscera. At the completion of each step of the stem, one presses and performs the act. Practising for fourteen years, the dragon flies by day; the essential Way lies upon the lettered slips — such is this diagram.

The Supreme Perfected One’s Way of stepping the Five Stars is to cause the Five Stars to descend within the chamber. Closing the breath and ascending the stem, one first calls the names of the Sovereign Lords and their Consorts of the Five Stars; then one crosses the stem and treads upon the stars. It is said, at first ascent of the stem one pauses and calls the names; when the calling is finished, one then crosses the stem and treads upon the stars. If at each arrival upon a star one again grounds the centre and calls the name of the star reached, pronounced “Yi,” so much the better. If it be difficult and wearisome to be exact, one may proceed according to the old method. Formerly, Yu Sha Gong, Bei Li Zi Sheng, and the Elder of Changling, all by this method ascended to Heaven, not declining on account of weariness or difficulty. This is what is called the regulation of life. Merchants and traders are eager and busy; would they shrink from toil and difficulty? Their aim is only for money and goods. If the seekers of the Way had ever the heart of merchants and traders, how could they fail to become Immortals? But alas! beginners all say they will exert themselves to the utmost; afterwards they slacken and relax, like a cart about to break down, the hundred joints slackening and falling apart; like a beast bearing a heavy burden on a long journey, faltering and slow. This is the trouble of novices and the laughter of the successful. If a man can search his heart with the inner mirror, this is to be stirred to the Spirit, and there will be the inspiration of the Spiritual Man to awaken him, bearing the carriage of the stars and constellations. The Five Star diagram is always set facing south, because Tai Bai (Venus) lies in the west, and Sui Xing (Jupiter) lies in the east. So it is arranged. The reason is that the Five Stars are hidden and wandering, without fixed position, unlike the Big Dipper, which is always in the same arrangement, fixed in its place at the five points, not following the stars’ whereabouts.

The Supreme Elemental Perfected One said: In stepping the Five Stars, before first ascending the star stem, and also when descending from the stem, one should first store the quintessence of the Five Stars within my five viscera. When stored, click the teeth five times, swallow saliva five times, and softly bless:

The Five Celestial Bodies arrayed across, shining brightly on the five directions; Mercury repels misfortune, Jupiter brings prosperity, Mars dispels calamity, Venus wards off war, Saturn guards the four quarters; I attain benefit and constancy, my name recorded on the jade slips, the characters inscribed in the imperial chamber. Riding the rushing breeze, fanning the light, soaring through the Supreme Void, entering and exiting the dark nothingness, roaming and feasting on the ten directions, covered by five clouds, summoning spirits and commanding the winds, serving myriad spirits, elevated as a Celestial Lord. Finished. Right mind toward the mouth of the stem, to be blessed at the moments of ascent and descent.

The Eastern Sui Xing True Sovereign Lord is named Cheng Lan, styled Qing Ning. His Consort is named Bao Rong, styled Fei Yun.

The Southern Mars True Sovereign Lord is named Wei Ting, styled San Rong. His Consort is named Hua Ping, styled Xuan Luo.

The Central Saturn True Sovereign Lord is named Cang Lu, styled Tan Yan. His Consort is named Kong Yao, styled Fei Xian.

The Western Venus True Sovereign Lord is named Liao Ling, styled Zhen Xun. His Consort is named Sou Ying, styled Ling En.

The Northern Mercury True Sovereign Lord is named Xian Xu, styled Jing Yuan. His Consort is named Xuan Hua, styled Long E.

In closing the breath and ascending the stem, one must first call the names of the Five Stars and their Consorts. Having done so, one crosses the stem and treads upon the stars. First raise both feet upon Tai Bai (Venus), ascend from Tai Bai to Zhen Xing (Saturn), from Zhen to Huo Xing (Mars), from Huo to Mu Xing (Wood star), from Mu to Chen Xing (Mercury), from Chen return to step upon Tai Bai. Three times over. Then again close the breath and ascend the crooked stem, proceeding fifteen times back and forth according to the old method. At each arrival upon a star, call out the Sovereign Lord and Consort’s names, left hand placed upon the heart, blessing thus and so.

The scripture says: In acting, all face north holding the secret book, saying it is for beginners to learn the true mystery, not having yet reached the subtle and distant; not understanding the star positions and their first directions, nor recognizing the pointers of the Mysterious Dipper; therefore it is proper to face north holding the book, in order to seek it gradually. When the meaning of the book is understood, and the star’s turning and following the time are recognized, one should follow the pointer of the Dipper, foot by foot. Thus there will be no constant direction, not always facing north. All facing north is only for beginners. It is feared that this may suffice to understand by analogy and touch upon categories, and there is no need for further questioning.

The three-eight phases combine the twenty-four spirits, to be recited in order. One may store all three-eight at once, or store the upper phase at dawn, the middle phase at midday, the lower phase at midnight — it depends on the person’s intention. If the outer body is secluded in a quiet chamber, screened off from human affairs, inwardly contemplating the spirit palace, gathering the true morning breath, one may at dawn store all the three-eight phases, and at the three times each may again store one phase, so much the better. But the world is full of affairs, and it is difficult to perform this constantly. If the matter cannot be kept constant, the benefit will be slight. Formerly, the Lord of West City and the Perfected One of Tongwu both followed this Way. According to the "Baoxuan Jade Record, White Slips, Azure Scripture": those who do not store the twenty-four spirits, or do not know the names of the three-eight phases, cannot be commoners of great peace, nor ministers of latter sages.

The Supreme Elemental Perfected One said: If one desires to transform and divide form, to sink and vanish into the eight directions, to hide the body and conceal the phases, to enter the void and create the dark, to come forth to produce all things, to hunt and capture all traitors, one must constantly cultivate the essence and thought of Void and Permanence. On the Eight Seasonal Days and the Six Ding Days also cultivate it. If these days coincide, repeat the practice; or follow the stepping of the stem and continue afterwards; this is also good. This is the Way of concealment and sinking.

Upon the Void and Permanent stem are twenty-five black points:

1. The first point is called Nine Permanences of the Earth, dwelling there to escape form.

2. The second point is called Nurturing Permanence, transforming into grass, trees, and all things.

3. The third point is called Mao Permanence, changing form into mountains and hills and all things.

4. The fourth point is called Flowing Permanence, escaping breath and transforming breath.

5. The fifth point is called Moving Permanence, escaping fire.

6. The sixth point is called Upper Permanence, seen by men as heaven above and earth below.

7. The seventh point is called Heavenly Permanence, escaping fire.

8. The eighth point is called Mysterious Permanence, escaping water.

9. The ninth point is called Three Permanences, escaping soldiers.

10. The tenth point is called Chen Permanence, escaping death.

11. The eleventh point is the central blessing place of Void Permanence, the heart.

12. The twelfth point is called River Permanence, transforming into water and fire.

13. The thirteenth point is called Primal Permanence, dwelling here, transforming into grass and trees.

14. The fourteenth point is called Ancient Permanence, dwelling here, transforming into black and following the heart.

15. The fifteenth point is called Si Permanence, transforming form into black beasts.

16. The sixteenth point is called Nine Permanences, escaping calamity.

17. The seventeenth point is called World Permanence, escaping spirits.

18. The eighteenth point is called Bright Permanence, escaping water and forming earth.

19. The nineteenth point is called Jade Permanence, dwelling here, forming the tiger.

20. The twentieth point is called Law Permanence, transforming the body into a thousand.

21. The twenty-first point is called Yin Permanence, dwelling here, transforming into dragons.

22. The twenty-second point is called Yellow Permanence, transforming into women, dividing form into a hundred.

23. The twenty-third point is called Fixed Permanence, dwelling here, transforming into myriad things by will.

24. The twenty-fourth point is called Flying Permanence, escaping the body as the six domestic animals, unseen by men.

25. The twenty-fifth point is called Six Permanences, escaping ghosts that kill men.

In stepping the Way of Void and Permanence, begin at the Nine Permanences, arrive at the place of the eleventh central star, and softly bless:

Four bright primal origins, sun and moon’s breath bright, flowing light shining, twenty-five stars, pouring liquids condensing the soul, spirit waters dissolving form, cleansing defilement and refining, penetrating the dark and deep, jade slips and azure registers, high chambers carved with names, stone mirrors and jade horses, revealing ghostly forms, hiding the spirit’s warp, ascending the supreme clear.

Within the first Big Dipper Taiqing is a transformation of concealment and escape, the Primal Inner Concubine, named Void and Permanent Law Wall, styled Xin Zheng Pi, wearing yellow brocade cape and vermilion-blue flying skirt.

The second star is the Guardian of the Fetus and Transformation of Form Inner Concubine, named Void Permanent Three Porcelains, styled Luo Zhu Ying, wearing blue brocade cape and green feather flying skirt.

The third true star is the Six Escapes and Seven Concealments Upper Primal Mother, named Void Permanent Spirit Yi, styled Chong Shuang Zhao, wearing blue brocade cape and embroidered feather splendid skirt.

The fourth knotted star conceals the phases and hides the light Inner Concubine, named Void Permanent Seven Rows, styled Heng Dan Pan, wearing purple brocade cloak and yellow splendid feather skirt.

The fifth main star transforms form and changes phases, great lady of the Dipper, named Void Permanent Yu Shu, styled Chou Qiu Lan, wearing vermilion brocade cape and purple-blue flying skirt.

The sixth discipline star hides the winding scattered images, middle lady of the Dipper, named Void Permanent Qi Jing, styled Bao Ding Ling, wearing vermilion brocade cape and blue embroidered flying skirt.

The seventh pass star divides phases into myriad forms, young lady of the Dipper, named Void Permanent Yu Mo, styled Tian Fan Shu, wearing red brocade cape and blue splendid feather skirt.

The eighth emperor star transforms the sun, moon, water, and fire, high sovereign left consort of the Dipper, named Void Permanent Shi Qi Zhu, styled Luo Mao Hua, wearing purple brocade cape and embroidered feather flying skirt.

The ninth honored star transforms gold, stone, mountains, and rivers, high sovereign right consort of the Dipper, named Void Permanent Ai Shang Tiao, styled Ling Yu Xuan, wearing green brocade cape and emerald feather splendid skirt.

The nine heads are gathered in dishevelled cloud bun. Closing the breath and ascending the stem, first call the nine stars’ inner concubines’ names, then tread upon the stars.

Tai Bai (Venus) hangs horizontally, scattering the sharp rays, forthwith emitting three parts and two golden sparks, mapping the boiling, augmenting the cosmic flow, the Mysterious Chamber bright and flourishing is the Tai Bai star. Moving horizontally and hanging, scattering upon the sharp edges, extending through the nine heavens. The Perfected One says that this star has seven rays, always emitting three rays to the west, drawing two rays to the south, so that the golden brilliance penetrates the eyes, mapping brightness boiling and horrifying, to penetrate the whole body. Having penetrated, one may join with the star spirits to enter the palaces of cosmic augmentation and flowing spread; within the palace is the Mysterious Chamber, already peaceful and then roaming, paying homage as a Perfected One. These are all the names of the Tai Bai star’s central palace chambers.

### Acting according to the Supreme Secret Book

The scripture says: In acting, all face north holding the secret book, saying it is for beginners to learn the true mystery, not having yet reached the subtle and distant; not understanding the star positions and their first directions, nor recognizing the pointers of the Mysterious Dipper; therefore it is proper to face north holding the book, in order to seek it gradually. When the meaning of the book is understood, and the star’s turning and following the time are recognized, one should follow the pointer of the Dipper, foot by foot. Thus there will be no constant direction, not always facing north. All facing north is only for beginners. It is feared that this may suffice to understand by analogy and touch upon categories, and there is no need for further questioning.

The Supreme Perfected One’s Way of stepping the Five Stars is to cause the Five Stars to descend within the chamber. Closing the breath and ascending the stem, one first calls the names of the Sovereign Lords and their Consorts of the Five Stars; then one crosses the stem and treads upon the stars. It is said, at first ascent of the stem one pauses and calls the names; when the calling is finished, one then crosses the stem and treads upon the stars. If at each arrival upon a star one again grounds the centre and calls the name of the star reached, pronounced “Yi,” so much the better. If it be difficult and wearisome to be exact, one may proceed according to the old method. Formerly, Yu Sha Gong, Bei Li Zi Sheng, and the Elder of Changling, all by this method ascended to Heaven, not declining on account of weariness or difficulty. This is what is called the regulation of life. Merchants and traders are eager and busy; would they shrink from toil and difficulty? Their aim is only for money and goods. If the seekers of the Way had ever the heart of merchants and traders, how could they fail to become Immortals? But alas! beginners all say they will exert themselves to the utmost; afterwards they slacken and relax, like a cart about to break down, the hundred joints slackening and falling apart; like a beast bearing a heavy burden on a long journey, faltering and slow. This is the trouble of novices and the laughter of the successful. If a man can search his heart with the inner mirror, this is to be stirred to the Spirit, and there will be the inspiration of the Spiritual Man to awaken him, bearing the carriage of the stars and constellations. The Five Star diagram is always set facing south, because Tai Bai (Venus) lies in the west, and Sui Xing (Jupiter) lies in the east. So it is arranged. The reason is that the Five Stars are hidden and wandering, without fixed position, unlike the Big Dipper, which is always in the same arrangement, fixed in its place at the five points, not following the stars’ whereabouts.

The three-eight phases combine the twenty-four spirits, to be recited in order. One may store all three-eight at once, or store the upper phase at dawn, the middle phase at midday, the lower phase at midnight — it depends on the person’s intention. If the outer body is secluded in a quiet chamber, screened off from human affairs, inwardly contemplating the spirit palace, gathering the true morning breath, one may at dawn store all the three-eight phases, and at the three times each may again store one phase, so much the better. But the world is full of affairs, and it is difficult to perform this constantly. If the matter cannot be kept constant, the benefit will be slight. Formerly, the Lord of West City and the Perfected One of Tongwu both followed this Way. According to the "Baoxuan Jade Record, White Slips, Azure Scripture": those who do not store the twenty-four spirits, or do not know the names of the three-eight phases, cannot be commoners of great peace, nor ministers of latter sages.

Receiving the Great Cavern True Scripture, one should receive the Highest Way’s method; clothing and head-kerchief not borrowed from others, nor different vessels; carriage, clothing, bed, and bedding not shared. Thus one blocks the paths of defilement and filth, and guards against the coming and going of evil winds. This is very easy to practice, yet considered difficult; this is what is called faith in the Way not firm, desiring to fly but sinking back.

All cultivators of the cave chamber practising the stepping of the Seven Primal Constants, at waking, at first going outside, and after meals, first softly bless thus:

Five Sovereigns and Five Passages, jade letters in the cave chamber, returning to the origin and concealing the Way, opening and letting go the Seven Dawns; the engendering soul is the Mysterious Father, changing the One into spirit; the engendering corporeal soul is the Mysterious Mother, transforming the Two to produce the body; the one who governs my sinews and bones is the Noble Son; the one who refines my essence and breath is the White Origin; long life and enduring vision, flying Immortal of the ten heavens. Finished. Do not allow ears to hear the sound of blessing. This is the Supreme Secret Blessing, to expel evil spirits and bring forth the spirit; to desire to transform and divide form, to sink and vanish into the eight directions, to hide the body and conceal the phases, to enter the void and create the dark, to come forth to produce all things, to hunt and capture all traitors, one must cultivate the essence and thought of Void and Permanence. On the Eight Seasonal Days and the Six Ding Days cultivate it also. If these days coincide, repeat the practice; or follow the stepping of the stem and continue afterwards; this is also good. This is the essential Way of concealment and sinking.

In stepping the Five Stars, before first ascending the star stem, and also when descending from the stem, one should first store the quintessence of the Five Stars within my five viscera. When stored, click the teeth five times, swallow saliva five times, and softly bless:

Riding the rushing breeze, fanning the light, soaring through the Supreme Void, entering and exiting the dark nothingness, roaming and feasting on the ten directions, covered by five clouds, summoning spirits and commanding the winds, serving myriad spirits, elevated as a Celestial Lord.

First raise both feet upon Tai Bai (Venus), ascend from Tai Bai to Zhen Xing (Saturn), from Zhen to Huo Xing (Mars), from Huo to Mu Xing (Wood star), from Mu to Chen Xing (Mercury), from Chen return to step upon Tai Bai.
