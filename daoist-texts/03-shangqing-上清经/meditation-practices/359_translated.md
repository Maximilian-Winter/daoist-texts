1. To accuse others of their faults, to manifest what is right here, to suppress the evil of others, to extend one’s own goodness, to blame oneself and not others, to understand principles and thereby pray to the gods for their aid, to remove sin and extend blessing — thus make petition to the Supreme Commander of Heaven, the First Jade Emperor.

2. Officials who study Yin and Yang, who seek rank and office — make petition to the Supreme Administrator of Heaven, the Second Jade Emperor.

3. Those who study the Dao and aspire to immortality, who communicate with gods and reach sages — make petition to the Minister of Works of Heaven, the Third Jade Emperor.

4. Those who subdue ghosts and evil spirits, who punish rebels, who destroy the hideous and wicked — make petition to the Patrol of Heaven, the Fourth Jade Emperor.

5. Those who establish merit and build virtue, who augment calculations and extend life — make petition to the Dou Lord of Heaven, the Fifth Jade Emperor.

These nine Jade Emperors and nine Empresses conceal their surnames and secret names; those who know them may extend their lives by thousands upon thousands of years. At every evening, contemplate them; imagine meeting the form and majestic radiance of the Emperors and Empresses; recall their surnames and secret names; observe attentively and keep them in mind; thus one may behold the Eighth and Ninth Stars, and extend life without end.

The Nine Jade Emperors and Nine Empresses are the souls and spirits of the Nine Vital Energies, the spirits of the Nine Heavens, the wondrous images of the Nine Emperors, the mighty gods of the Nine Transformations. Men and women who study the Dao, wearing their ritual garments, as they go out and come in, sit and lie down, think of the truth; in times of sorrow, anger, illness, and calamity, they are saved from sickness and aided in decline; cultivating themselves and benefiting others, they constantly remember them, disasters are dissipated and misfortunes dispersed, blessings enjoyed and communication with the gods attained. In days of emergency, one should write talismans according to the law on bamboo or silk with vermilion brush, bow twice facing north, and wear them with water from the Jinghua spring. When worn, they take effect; the nine watches begin anew; if one, two, or three worries are removed and illnesses cured, one may then rest. There are no other incantations; only the nine secret names are kept. Diligently establish good works; if unremitting for nine years, one will surely attain divine power. The essential teachings of the Jade Emperor must not be rashly divulged, but kept secret and cultivated; one attains the rank of Perfected One, Lord of Origin, and associates with the Highest Sages, the Three Pure Ones, and Perfected Lords. Receiving it, one tears the silk to establish the diagram, issues commands and transmits it; keeping the secret name in mind, then one becomes an immortal.

All who receive the River Chart should first request the secret names of the Nine Emperors, and fast for nine days, seven days, five days, three days, or one day; at the appointed time perform the incantations and petitions; when the fasting period ends, in the mountain abode or altar hall close the gates and remain quiet, then present the memorial as above.
