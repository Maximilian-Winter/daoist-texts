The Scripture of the Golden Gate Sovereign Lord, True Unity of the Three Primal Ones

Juanzi imparted to the Azure Youth Lord of the Eastern Sea:

The Perfect Man esteems Unity as the True. Above, there is the Heavenly Emperor of the One Body; in the middle, the Red Palace’s Cinnabar Emperor; below, the Yellow Court’s Primal King. They together oversee and govern the twenty-four vital airs within the body, corresponding to the twenty-four True Ones of the Supreme Subtlety. Now, the qi is formed from condensed empty vapours and completes the spirit. Each Sovereign of the Three Primal Ones commands thousands of chariots and myriad horsemen, with cloud-chariots and feathered canopies, constantly entering the Purple Palace within, ascending to the Supreme Clarity, arranged in the primal registers, holding the rank of Perfect Man, and flying through the nine firmaments. If one can guard it ever steadfastly, then the Three-in-One may be perceived. If the Three-in-One may be perceived, then the myriad chariots and myriad horsemen have arrived. The feathered canopy may be borne, the cloud-chariot may be ridden, by day rising to heaven, ascending to the Supreme Subtlety.

Within the Supreme Subtlety are twenty-four airs, mingled with yellow and blended, which gather qi and transform, sometimes suddenly dividing and streaming forth. Among the qi are the twenty-four Perfect Ones, all the qi of the Three-in-One Emperors, who effect division of the Dao and transformation. Having preserved the Three-in-One within the body, then the Sovereigns of the Three-in-One in the Supreme Subtlety descend and appear without, speaking with you.

Within the body again are the twenty-four Perfect Ones, also formed from the essence, light, and pure qi of the body. If the cloud-chariot comes to welcome, it ascends to the Supreme Subtlety; the twenty-four Perfect Ones of the Supreme Subtlety, together with the spirits within the body, feast in the midst of the mingled yellow, rising in shared radiance, all equal in virtue within and without. They all enter and leave the Supreme Clarity, rest in the Supreme Subtlety, and concurrently traverse the Cave Chamber. Within the Cave Chamber is naturally the Yellow Gate, Purple Door, and Chamber of Mysterious Essence; the Three-in-One Revered Sovereigns dwell there constantly. As they traverse, one spirit becomes yet swifter. The Perfect Man of the Cave Chamber must guard the One as root; guarding the One Perfect Man must regard the Cave Chamber as the floral canopy. Thus the Three-in-One mutually require each other; the Cave Chamber mutually sustains; though their abodes differ, the effect of the Dao is equal and mutual. If each but attain one way, with a firm fixed mind, one may enter the Supreme Purity and no more, holding the rank of Supreme Purity Immortal King alone, but may not wander in the Supreme Subtlety nor float to the Supreme Clarity. Above is the extremity of the True Emperor; in the middle is the utmost of the Cinnabar Emperor; below is the mystery of the Primal King. The Heavenly Emperor attains the utmost, thus above completes the imperial pole; the Earthly Emperor attains the utmost, thus above completes the Perfect Unity; the Human Emperor attains the mystery, thus above completes the Lord of all mysteries. The Three Emperors embody the True and guard the One; thus the One reveals no form, its truth is the utmost. The Three-in-One all shine; attaining the One they come to birth. Therefore the Three Emperors, the men of the world who learn therein, all esteem the guarding of the True One. Guarding the True One, the heart is simple and the spirit concentrated, blended and devoted to mysterious response; thus no hundred thoughts arise, the essence and intent do not disperse. But within three months inwardly inspecting, concentrating the heart on one spirit, the spirit’s light transforms and produces the outer body, and accompanies it wandering; this is fixing the thought without dispersion, concentrating the qi to effect harmony, arising from simplicity to utmost, attained swiftly. Since the simplicity dispersed, since the truth departed, artificial and false things gradually arise, contending thoughts and confusion arise; thus the One is not fully seen, the spirit does not immediately respond. It is not that (the spirit) does not wish to abide; those who preserve it are not focused; those who think on it are not exact; thus (one) begins to accumulate years of practice, and only then is there semblance of success. If one can fast the heart and distance the world, with a concentrated heart without striving, then certainly by the feeling of three months one will face the One also. The Three Primal Ones are the Jade Truths of the Nine Heavens, the Perfect Dao of the Most High. Therefore the Perfect Unity Way issues from the True Emperor; the Perfect Mysterious Dao gives birth to the Great Spirit; the Three Primal Ones unravel change, thus the One is the origin of birth, so all True Ones return to the One and the Mysterious Work is completed. This is the origin of the Perfect Way, the root beginning of primal qi.

Now the method of the Three-in-One embraces the Dao perfected in the Three Primal Ones, comprehends the spiritual chapters, and grasps the treasured divine scripture. The first secret is the Great Cave True Scripture; the second secret is the Great Abundance Wonderful Scripture; the third secret is the Most High Simple Spirit. Therefore the Sovereign Lord above treasures the Great Cave True Scripture; the middle Cinnabar Emperor treasures the Great Abundance Wonderful Scripture; the lower Primal King treasures the Most High Simple Spirit. These three texts are the utmost essence of the True Way, the supreme chapters of the Three-in-One, and the secret instructions of the Supreme Clarity. Wonderful indeed, nameless, the Way is not far. Guarding the One born, the Three-in-One is seen. Since you have seen the One, you may seek this scripture; it must also be secretively transmitted to guard the method of the Three-in-One. The Sovereign Lord of Heaven above the Supreme Clarity, Golden Gate, is the head chapter of the True Scripture, the wondrous secret of all True Ones. If you can guard the One, the One will guard you; if you can see the One, the One will see you. In your going forward or backward, in myriad affairs, always think on the One. In eating and drinking think on the One; in joy and sorrow think on the One; in sickness think on the One; in danger think on the One; in walking on water or fire think on the One; in riding chariots or horses think on the One; in emergencies think on the One. Men’s thoughts on the One, their actions and looks, their thoughts are many, but their thought is concentrated. The misfortune is that men have wills not firm; firm wills cannot last long; though they know the name of the One, they cannot guard it; guarding it they cannot keep their will steady; many have a pride of heart, cannot keep it constant. Thus when the Three-in-One departs, the correct qi leaves; he who loses correct qi has evil qi; evil qi means death draws near. Ordinary men learning the Dao seek much showiness, and do not believe that the True One is precious. At first they have the will, but afterwards it changes and decays, because their will is not one, and evil qi enters. The caution in guarding the One is to beware of lack of concentration; concentration again will not last; if lasting cannot be refined, then the Three-in-One departs, the body becomes an empty house with no master, how can disaster be long delayed?

Qi condenses into essence; essence moves to spirit; spirit transforms into infant; the infant above is the Perfect Man; the Perfect Man ascends to the Red Child—this is True Unity. Heaven has three mysteries, called sun, moon, and stars; also has three essences, used for long life. Man has three treasures, the three cinnabar fields; also called three truths, used for eternal existence. The Scripture of the Numinous Treasure says: heavenly essence, earthly truth, the three treasures endure eternally, this is what is meant.

Between the two eyebrows is the Upper Cinnabar Field; the heart’s Red Palace is the Middle Cinnabar Field; three cun below the navel is the Lower Cinnabar Field; these three form the three cinnabar fields. The Red Child dwells in the Upper Cinnabar Palace; the Perfect Man dwells in the Middle Cinnabar Palace; the infant dwells in the Lower Cinnabar Palace. Between the eyebrows and upwards, one cun within is the Bright Hall; two cun within is the Cave Chamber; three cun within is the cinnabar field Mud Pellet Palace. To go inward means to go towards the back of the nape. The Mud Pellet Palace of the cinnabar field measures one cun on each of the four sides; purple qi rushes to heaven, reflecting ninety thousand li outward, covering the Big Dipper’s seven stars with a canopy, the ladle’s handle pointing forward and outward. Transformations, great and small, flying forms indistinct, are held in thought and preserved in mind. The Upper Primal Red Child dwells in the midst beneath the Dipper’s canopy. The Red Child is called Mysterious Condensation Heaven, named Three Primal Predecessor, holding the rank of Mud Pellet Heavenly Emperor. On his right is an imperial minister in opposition, the spirit of teeth, tongue, and brain, ascending and transforming into life. Called Initiating Essence, named Middle Mystery Birth, ascending to become Imperial Minister Lord. These two jointly govern the Mud Pellet, both clothed in red embroidered robes, appearing as newly born infants. The Heavenly Emperor holds the Supreme Clarity Divine Tiger Talisman; the Imperial Minister holds the Great Cave True Scripture, both seated facing outward or sometimes facing each other. Within they guard the Mud Pellet, the face, mouth, tongue, teeth, ears, nose, and hair region; without they awe and terrify the six heavens and myriad evil demons. The three souls and five spirits come once every five days to court and receive orders.

The heart is the Middle Cinnabar Field, called the Red Palace, governing the very center of the heart, one cun on each of the four sides; vermilion smoke reaches heaven, illuminating thirty thousand li outward, transformations indistinct, preserved in thought. The Middle Primal Perfect Man dwells therein, called Spirit Motion Pearl, named Southern Child Cinnabar, holding the rank of Red Palace Cinnabar Emperor Lord. On his right is the Auxiliary Imperial Minister, the spirit formed from the four viscera. Entering the Red Palace as Auxiliary Minister, called Radiant Firmness, named Four Spirits. These two jointly govern the Red Palace, both clad in vermilion brocade robes, appearing as newly born infants. The Cinnabar Emperor Lord holds the Mars star in his left hand and the Grand Protector Scripture in his right; the Auxiliary Minister Lord holds the Great Abundance Wonderful Scripture’s Eight Scenes, seated facing outward or facing each other. Within they guard muscles, bones, five viscera, flesh and blood; without they frighten away myriad evil omens, nurture light and calm the spirit, prolong life and lengthen sight, flying as immortals to the Great Firmament. The three souls and seven spirits come once every three days to court and receive orders.

Three cun below the navel is called the Life Gate Cinnabar Field Palace; the Lower Primal Infant dwells therein, one cun on each of the four sides, white qi rushes to heaven, illuminating seventy thousand li outward, transformations great and small, flying forms indistinct, preserved in thought. The Lower Primal Infant is called Beginning Bright Essence, named Primal Yang Flourishing, holding the rank of Yellow Court Primal King. On his right is the Guardian Minister, the spirit of essence, qi, and bodily fluids, condensed smoke ascending and transforming. Entering the cinnabar field palace as Guardian Minister, called Returning Supreme Brightness, named Valley Lower Mystery. These two jointly govern the Lower Cinnabar Field, both clad in yellow embroidered silk robes, appearing as newly born infants. The Yellow Court Primal King holds the Venus star in his left hand and the Jade Morning Golden True Scripture in his right; the Guardian Minister holds the Most High Simple Spirit Scripture, the Nine Courts produce Radiant Talismans, seated facing outward or facing each other. Within they guard the limbs, fluids and blood, stomach and intestines, bladder and other organs; without they dispel disasters and calamities, repel myriad evils. The three souls and seven spirits come thrice daily to court and serve the Primal King.

The method of guarding the One: on the day of the Beginning of Spring, at midnight, sit upright facing east; blow qi nine times; swallow saliva thirty-five times; then preserve the Big Dipper’s seven stars, slowly descending above my head, facing heaven, with the ladle’s handle pointing straight before towards the east. Preserve the Yin Essence and Perfect Man stars, close to the crown of the head; the Yang Bright and Mysterious Dark stars are behind, the Mysterious Dark and Perfect Man stars before; thus the positions of preserved thought and semblance are fixed. Again think of the Sovereigns of the Three-in-One, suddenly transforming and arising, coming forth in the Dipper’s head; in a moment the three ministers arise as the three revereds; in a moment all six ascend the Mysterious Dark, swiftly proceeding eastward, reaching the heavenly gate and halting, all facing my mouth. Again preserve, seeing the Upper Primal supporting the Upper Minister, the Middle Primal supporting the Middle Minister, the Lower Primal supporting the Lower Minister. I then swallow qi once, a long time remaining still; the two of the Upper Primal come from the qi into my mouth, ascending and returning to the Mud Pellet Palace. Then swallowing qi a second time, a long time remaining still; the two of the Middle Primal come from the qi into my mouth, descending and returning to the Red Palace. Then swallowing qi a third time, a long time remaining still; the two of the Lower Primal come from the qi into my mouth, descending and returning to the Lower Cinnabar Field. Preserve the Heavenly Gate star, commanding it to be seven feet from the mouth, the star commanded to face before the mouth; the Three-in-One enter my three palaces. All complete, then the essence contemplates the True One, each resting in its place; sitting or lying, think of it in the heart; if the heart has desire, in all matters the heart should open it; if seeking anything, also the heart should open to seek it. Preserve the thought, only to cause stillness and silence; quiet the sleeping chamber; even by day one may preserve the thought.

At the Beginning of Summer preserve the Three-in-One, facing south as at the Beginning of Spring.

At the Beginning of Autumn preserve the Three-in-One, facing west as at the Beginning of Summer.

At the Beginning of Winter preserve the Three-in-One, facing north as at the Beginning of Autumn.

Preserve the thought of the Three-in-One, each resting in its office; when complete, then softly intone:

The five directions command the Dipper; the spirits summon the seven stars; the three revereds condense and transform, ascending to the Purple Court; the six spirits wander; the three palaces, cinnabar city; mysterious communication with the great Emperor; descending to the Cave of Yellow Tranquillity; heavenly truth guards and defends; summoning and drawing the six Dings; spirits and immortals together float, riding smoke to the Three Purities; the four bodies are firmly refined; the five viscera naturally arise.

Thus guard the secret of the Scripture of the True Unity of the Three Primal Ones.

The Scripture of the Golden Gate Sovereign Lord, True Unity of the Three Primal Ones.
