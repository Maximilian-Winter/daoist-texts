## The Jade Scripture of the Supreme Clarity’s True Youth United in Inner Transformation

The Jade Protector King, the Azure Youth Dao Lord, beginning to enter the Way Realm, ascended to the floating firmament of cinnabar groves, and looked down upon the Grotto Sea; he drew forth the essence of flavours and circulated the refined essence, thereby forming and nurturing the Flowery Youth. The sun’s palace lies ten thousand li distant; suddenly the nine gates open; the cinnabar light and purple clouds, the vapours and brightness combine; the Five Emperors clap their hands; the Divine Crow pecks at the brightness; the heart and eyes focus their gaze; the essence and spirit are united; Great Harmony arises spontaneously; the golden body is harmonious and free-flowing.

The Jade Protector Azure Youth Dao Lord, in leisure, saluted and gestured; with utmost emptiness he engendered spirit; he rested peacefully in the Mysterious Palace; the Three Origins and Nine Beginnings cast their glance yet did not come to the courtyard. Suddenly a divine person appeared, traversing clouds and bearing the moon, garbed with celestial cords and heavenly stars, the Jade Immortal graceful and sharp, with azure bones soft and bright, who thus spoke to the Azure Youth:

‘Thou hast afar received the sun’s essence, and seated obtained the moon’s fluid; thou shalt attain heavenly essence and nourish thy golden form.’ Thereupon the twin lights divided their beams and illuminated thy body; within thy cinnabar field there arose spontaneously the fungus of essence, jade and bright and glittering. I show thee the essential secret, that men may know the true One, and obtain the essence without birth so as to become an immortal body. The essence without birth is the luxuriant sprout of the Azure Yang; the true youth is the male child of the Azure Youth. They reside within the child’s body, and the child’s thought calls them forth; when they come, they co-travel, mingling and transforming. Their summons has its order, the principle must not be rashly transgressed.

The body’s qi transmits the water’s essence, which is the will. The will is earth, born of fire. The earth transmits the fire’s essence as spirit; the spirit and qi accumulate and form the bones; the bone’s essence is the pupil in the eye of the child. The eye’s frame is the mysterious window of the child’s body. The twin pearls glowing brightly are the child’s spirit mirrors; above they communicate the light of sun and moon, below they pour into the child’s concealed ox. These numbers are the reason why the essence without birth comes. Essence without birth is a spiritual thing; when it comes, the child himself knows it. At the appointed day observe it; when it comes, it moves its place; there is something settled within the child’s body.

If one desires to effect it, face the sun and offer worship and prayer; first approach the eyes; one will see before one a red vapour filling the front. Closing the eyes, one will see the red colour becoming intense and rising in waves. Then, closing the eyes tightly and with the eye’s essence looking through the skin and the principle, one sees red and purple forming precious colours, with hundreds of floral patterns revolving like a turning carriage. The child then draws it in by the nose, from beneath the nape, piercing the spine, passing the kidneys, reaching the heels, and returning through the cinnabar field; one sees the colours as before. The heart prays thus:

‘The spirit summons, the qi connects; within I imagine what comes from without; the spirit and qi closely meet; the sun’s crystal flows as smoke; it washes my old marrow; prolongs and changes to produce truth; essence without birth, Azure Yang, the luxuriant sprout flourishes; the yin and yang open wide; demons and goblins lose their form; the sun and moon’s light is blended; it nourishes my sacred body; ascending above to Jade Protector, minister of the Later Sage.’

The moon is likewise so observed, for at the time of sun and moon alone one dwells in rest and watches with the mind; there will be something entering from that spot. It is said the left foot corresponds to the Beginning of Spring, the days Wu Yin, Ji Chou; the left breast corresponds to Spring Equinox, the day Yi Mao; the left hand corresponds to Beginning of Summer, days Wu Chen, Ji Si; the chest and throat correspond to Summer Solstice, day Bing Wu; the right hand corresponds to Beginning of Autumn, days Wu Shen, Ji Wei; the right breast corresponds to Autumn Equinox, day Xin You; the right foot corresponds to Beginning of Winter, days Wu Xu, Ji Hai; the base of the loins corresponds to Winter Solstice, day Ren Zi. On these days and hours one observes, drawing inward to the cinnabar field to see what is obtained. It is not necessary that all reach their places, but essence without birth unites with the year’s Jia, naturally journeying within the one body.

The two mingling lights intercross; day by day this is done; sitting at night suddenly a flash of light comes before the child; the child looks and it vanishes. Long continued, one may fix the observation, and the light encloses a form complete, which is the appearance of the essence without birth. The cinnabar field also has this appearance. The practice is the True Reality of the Supreme Clarity, and is not to be proclaimed to the lower learners.

The Azure Youth Dao Lord practised his Way, and by secret formula issued it from the bound Flowery Jade Palace, delivering it to the Perfected Person, according to the clear ritual.

Thus is transmitted the teaching of the Right Eastern Flower Protector, Morning Mysterious Yellow Dao Lord.
