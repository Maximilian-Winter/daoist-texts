Secret Instructions on Ascending to the True

### Secret Instructions on Ascending to the True, Scroll I

By Tao Hongjing, Recluse of Huayang

Transmitted by Lord Su, Chief of the Mysterious Continent

Within the transmission is the practice of Guarding the One, fracturing and piercing through the cave, and within the scripture there is the Flying Step scripture, which is somewhat interrupted. These are all matters difficult for the learner, hence detailed notes are added to dispel doubts and remove obscurity.

True Talismans

The True Talismans of the Supreme Ultimate Emperor Lord, all four talisman chapters speak of the Supreme Ultimate Emperor Lord, who is the Heavenly Emperor of the Supreme Ultimate, the Holy Lord of the Golden Palace, and the master who received the teaching of the Three Ones in the initial study of the Way. The six talismans of the Upper Origin, five of the Central Origin, five of the Lower Origin, the Upper, Middle, and Lower Origins, refer to the three palaces of the three origins within the body, each talisman character corresponding to a place of generation. The discovery of the carp by the scholar Juanzi is the Supreme One summoning the Three Ones to guard the form. By talisman one summons One, commanding One to guard the body, just as the Purple Script announces to the Three Souls. The beginnings of spring, the vernal equinox, the beginnings of summer, the summer solstice, the beginnings of autumn, the autumnal equinox, the beginnings of winter, the winter solstice, these are the starting days, each of these eight seasonal festivals being the beginning. Written in cinnabar, at daybreak facing the ruler, one talisman is swallowed. When finished, bow twice, and then make wishes at will. First, on the day of the beginning of spring at daybreak, facing the Tiger, write on white paper in cinnabar, beginning with the first of the Upper Origin; hold with the left hand and make the prayer; after the prayer swallow the talisman; after swallowing bow again; it is also permissible to simultaneously draw sixteen talismans, cut and place them, taking one each morning to swallow; after swallowing the talisman of the Upper Origin, store it in the upper palace; take one from the upper palace; the Central Origin talisman is stored in the middle; the Lower Origin in the lower, all likewise. When writing and swallowing talismans, first burn incense to the left; according to various scriptures, there are many prayers for swallowing talismans, but here it says 'at will' in sound, which is not mandatory; one may also make four-character rhymes, taking the intent of summoning and greeting and praying accordingly, which is separately established. Wear it on the head, contained in a brocade pouch; do not tread upon filth; after five years, one meets the True One. Wearing the talisman is also begun with the initial guarding, on the day of the beginning of spring at daybreak, after drawing the talisman, before swallowing, again write the three origins talisman in cinnabar on white plain paper, cut into three pieces; hold all and pray; after prayer, place them all together in a purple brocade pouch worn on the head; then swallow one paper talisman. This is only done at the beginning of spring; thereafter one may meet the True One; the other festivals need not be repeated except for writing and swallowing anew. The swallowing of talismans begins with the eight seasonal festivals, sixteen days for one set; in later festivals swallow as at the beginning. Each festival swallow at daybreak, taking one as the beginning; there are sixteen talismans; thus when all are swallowed, it ceases. The interval between festivals is forty-five days; the interval of a qi is fifteen days; thus swallowing talismans from the festival ends with the completion of the correct qi day. In June, the Middle Dipper is stored; one must not omit swallowing talismans. This only mentions the eight festivals; as also below is said of four festivals; these are but one prayer event; it is said one must swallow talismans, hence it is arranged to avoid the summer solstice and beginning of autumn.

Precious Seal

The Precious Seal of the Supreme Ultimate Emperor Lord, conferred upon Juanzi by the Azure Youth Lord of the Eastern Sea as a seal of the mastery of the famous mountains. This too was gained by the splitting of the carp, but is not described here, as previously spoken of with the talisman. Written in cinnabar on plain paper, wear on the left elbow; do not get it soiled; wear for eight years, and the Three Ones will be seen together. After swallowing the three origins talismans written in white, also write again on plain paper facing north, as if of gold in length and width; hold with the left hand and pray at will; after prayer, roll up and place in a purple brocade pouch; wear on the left elbow; wearing thus also leads to meeting the True One. If the beginning of spring falls in the twelfth lunar month of the previous year, still write and wear it on that day; only on the first day of the first lunar month is it renewed. When wearing this seal and talisman, do not tread upon filth; now immediately keep to guarding One; wear it; after the matter is finished, take it off and place in the bed or utensils. It is said that after eight years the Three Ones are all seen together; before, the talisman said five years to meet the True One; this is not all at once. Speaking of meeting One is not merely to see One’s own Three Ones, but also to see the Three Ones of the Supreme Emperor of the Taiwei; and the master who transmits the scripture is likewise included. Therefore one must diligently accumulate this practice before one can sense that One. On the first day of the lunar month, at daybreak, write one talisman in blue; this is also a precious seal. After swallowing it, call it a talisman; engraving it on gold and wearing it on the belt completes the seal. The seal is like the seal of an official; its dimensions are fixed and may not be deficient; talismans, like edicts, may be of any size, here made small and abbreviated in comparison with the seal. Every year on the first day one swallows it; one must see One and then stop. One must use finely ground blue or dark blue, finely processed with water to remove steeliness, then mixed with glue, thinly written on white paper; do not make it thick; may also use indigo blue. Facing north, bow twice and swallow it; after writing facing north, hold with left hand and pray; after prayer bow twice and then swallow it; also store in the upper palace. Whenever swallowing talismans to summon and inform the body spirits, bowing is necessary; but if informing external spirits, no bowing is required; this is the rule. After meeting the Three Ones, write on gold of length nine cun, width four cun, thickness three fen. The gold should be pure gold; the material is the original subject engraved. Such a method uses tens of catties of gold, beyond the capability of a Daoist. May also use white gold, i.e., silver, called gold here; thus either may be used. Characters are engraved in thread style as in seal script, all written left to right; dimensions follow ancient measures; used to seal and master the evil spirits of mountains and rivers, masters of the Five Sacred Mountains’ true energies. At the appointed time, the three origins True One Lord will personally instruct. The sealing and mastering is a means of employment; its method as a system is not yet declared; one must meet the Three Ones to receive instruction. This matter is from the Supreme Basic Spirit Scripture, Scroll One. This true scripture is not yet in circulation, being the fundamental source of Guarding the One.

Nine Palaces

Concerning the nine palaces in the head, first let their regions be set forth. For the application of cultivation, their regions are first listed. Between the two eyebrows, upwards three fen is taken as the Guardian Inch Twin Fields; facing the nose straight upward, the lower boundary is one inch above the eyebrows, forming a square. ‘Returning’ means returning backward; the boundary of the bone is taken; three fen inside the bone anteriorly all belong to the domain of the Guardian Inch; the Terrace Gate is also included therein; the Bright Hall is only the remaining seven fen. Having established the central one inch and the sides arranged, it is hence called the Guardian Inch Twin Fields. To the left is the Azure Chamber; to the right the Purple Gate; two gods dwell there. Returning inward one inch is the Bright Hall Palace; on the left the Bright Youth True Lord; on the right the Bright Maiden True Lord; in the center the Bright Mirror Spirit Lord; three gods dwell there. Returning inward two inches is the Cave Chamber Palace; though the head is connected for the cave chamber, this is the main part of the cave chamber; on the left is the Worthless Hero Lord; on the right the White Origin Lord; in the center the Yellow Old Lord; three gods dwell there. According to the sequence from here on, speaking of returning inward one inch, two inches, or three inches, it remains clear that the brow is the base, not that an inch is added after the three fen. Some say that one obtains the Guardian Inch only after returning three fen, or the Bright Hall only after returning one inch; is this so? Here an example is taken for evidence. According to the Five Celestial Bodies method, the Stationary Star is in the Yellow Chamber Long Valley; the Yellow Chamber Long Valley is in the philtrum; centrally straight inward two fen; the star is like a hanging bead above; this chamber is small and the star large, thus the rest extends upon the skin; if entering two fen is required for the Yellow Chamber, how could the star extend outside? It is also said that straight inward one inch with an additional square inch suffices to aid brightness. Now the scripture also says that one inch above the Bright Hall is the Heavenly Court Palace; should one leave one inch empty above for the Heavenly Court? The second inch above the Bright Hall is the Imperial Hometown Mysterious Palace, the place of the Stationary Star; these may serve as clear evidence. If one can see the true palace, one should know these words are not false. Returning inward three inches is the Elixir Field Palace, also called the Mud Pellet Palace; on the left is the Upper Origin Red Child Emperor Lord; on the right the Imperial Minister; two gods dwell there. Returning inward four inches is the Flowing Pearl Palace, with the Flowing Pearl True God residing there. Returning inward five inches is the Jade Emperor Palace, with the Jade Pure Divine Mother residing there. One inch above the Bright Hall is the Heavenly Court Palace, again above the Bright Hall, within the external returning inward one inch; not necessarily exactly one inch above the Bright Hall. Because the human forehead is already elevated, thus after measuring three fen outward from the brow to above the cave chamber, its palace’s front entrance is like the mid-Guardian Inch; it has the Upper Pure True Maiden residing there. One inch above the Cave Chamber is the Supreme True Palace, returning inward two inches; the Supreme Ultimate Empress resides there. One inch above the Elixir Field is the Mysterious Elixir Palace, returning inward three inches; also called the Mysterious Elixir Brain Essence Mud Pellet Mysterious Palace, with the Central Yellow Supreme One True Lord residing there. One inch above the Flowing Pearl is the Supreme Imperial Palace, returning inward four inches; the Supreme Lord and Queen reside there. These are the nine palaces within the head. The other eight palaces each have one inch square; only the Bright Hall and Guardian Inch share one inch square; the Guardian Inch is not another palace but the terrace gate outside the Bright Hall. Inside the Bright Hall, top and bottom and sides are also each one inch, but north and south are shallower, only seven fen. Though all nine palaces are within one head, their grades differ. The first is the Jade Emperor Palace; then the Supreme Imperial Office; then the Heavenly Court Office; then the Supreme True Palace; then the Mysterious Elixir Palace; then the Cave Chamber Palace; then the Flowing Pearl Palace; then the Elixir Field Palace; then the Bright Hall Office; this expresses their gradations. The scriptures of the Bright Hall, Cave Chamber, Elixir Field, Flowing Pearl all relate to the Way of the True Man among the gods and immortals; the Way is transmitted in the world. At present, only the Bright Hall has an existing meditation scripture, lacking prayers and ritual formulas, doubtfully incomplete. The Cave Chamber is the advanced internal scripture of the Cave Chamber; only one text is chanted, and there is no use for meditation; its Way is already propagated but the true original is not seen. The Elixir Field scripture is precisely this Way of guarding the three origins True One. Its root source comes from the Basic Spirit, and its matters are complete herein; nothing is lacking. The Flowing Pearl scripture states that the Supreme Ultimate Ministers of Fate practice it; the Middle and Lesser Lords also receive it; though said to be transmitted, the world has never seen it. Hence the Middle Lord says: Diligent and unceasing, I shall provide the Flowing Pearl True; this also is the upper Way of the Central True; these words seem to be spoken to the visitor for explanation; it is not certain whether they were actually received.

The Mysterious Elixir Palace scripture is also the essential words of the True Official Fate Lord; it is the head of the four palaces. This scripture must be given by the Supreme Ultimate Emperor Lord; it is only occasionally imparted. The Mysterious Elixir scripture is the one after the Three Ones; its source also comes from the Basic Spirit. This Way is excellent; it is placed in the same scroll as the three origins, because Lord Su last practiced it to receive the True Ministers; thus Zi Yang compiled and recorded this matter after transmission; it was not originally part of the same scripture. Because the oaths are not of the same kind, when receiving the transmission, one need not receive it together with the Three Ones; but the Mysterious Elixir scripture says: Keep the Three Ones day and night until finished; the one who has not guarded it is the Mysterious Elixir family; thus the Mysterious Elixir family may first keep the One; the family who guards the One need not know the Mysterious Elixir. All the ways of the five palaces practiced in the world with true names have been encountered; unless one has a strong bone and firm fate, these words are not heard. Many in the world have received this Way, yet no one cultivates and guards it. The spirits within the body are less than other methods; the treasures of the Upper True are sufficient as a field of study; if this one Way is practiced, then life is prolonged; if not, death ensues; these are not for those of strong bones and firm fate. Also there is the Jade Emperor Palace, where the Jade Pure Divine Mother resides; the Heavenly Court Palace, where the Upper Pure True Maiden resides; the True Supreme Palace, where the Supreme Ultimate Empress resides. Previously called Supreme True, here called True Supreme; the two words are inverted; which is correct is not explained; perhaps a later error. Also there is the Supreme Imperial Palace, where the Supreme Lord and Queen reside. These four palaces are all Female True One; their Way is superior to Male True One; there are precious scriptures transmitted and the True Man already perfected; those not yet perfected are not known to us; the essentials of the Female True are not imparted. The five palaces’ gods are all male, thus called Male One; these four palaces are female, thus Female One. The nine palaces of the Upper Pure Taiwei have True Lords residing there; hence the human head also has these places correspondingly; so it is said the Void Harmonious guards the male, the Desolate guards the female. The Desolate means solitary light going alone; in the world’s learning, though True Man has not yet been perfected, the chest harbours dregs and stagnation, thus it cannot be cultivated. The Five Thousand Words also say to know the male and guard the female. All have these four palaces, but if this Way is not cultivated, the palace is empty; if the nine palaces are not fully cultivated, the palaces are empty; this applies not only to the four female palaces. As to the Elixir Field Palace, there is always an Emperor Lord; the Guardian Inch always has a great god; no question is made whether one must guard to see them in the palace. Those who cultivate it are gods and immortals; those who do not cultivate it live and die. Thus the common vulgar person also has the constant Three Ones within the body, but cannot cultivate and guard; when his life is ended, departure ensues, which is death. If one obtains the method and constantly cultivates and preserves, then even the empty palaces will receive gods according to circumstances; not only the Emperor Lord in the Elixir Field. Guarding the One without danger, when the lifespan is exceeded, there is no more death, until meeting; meeting means obtaining the Way. The male and female One God can be cultivated together without distinction; only by resolving essence and bitterness to the utmost does one obtain benefit. This is called the male and female One; both men and women may cultivate without distinction of difference. If a man guards the female, he also takes female form; if a woman guards the male, she takes male form; but the Three Ministers are the essence and transformation of my body, so each according to original separates men and women. The principle of Guarding the One requires first one or two years of intense essence and thought; one must obtain the model; then it is easy to meditate and imagine.

The Guardian Inch is the beginning method of Guarding the One. Seeking the scripture’s sequence, the order is not continuous; sometimes beginnings are not distinguished; sometimes the matter transcends; it cannot be all declared and written from the original. Now a new explanation and order is given; extracting the source and main points; the large characters are all as recorded in this text, without addition or diminution, only arranging the topics in order for easier following. At the midnight of the beginning of spring, sitting upright facing east, the scripture says that at the beginning of summer face south, beginning of autumn face west, beginning of winter face north; the secret says this is the method of Guarding the Three Origins True One; all use the nights of the four beginnings; after the hour of Hai (9-11 pm) one may proceed; each faces the monthly branch; the four beginnings are the four leaders, not the cardinal directions; the five Dipper divisions reach the four middles only. Each time sitting level, closing the breath, eyes focused, hands grasp firmly on the knees, then first meditate to guard the Guardian Inch according to method. Between the eyebrows upward is wrapped the Yellow Gate and Purple Gate, Red Terrace and Azure Chamber, all forming the center of the Guardian Inch; the ears on left and right. This is the region returning inward three fen; the Terrace Gate is within the three fen; each side one inch broad, arranged left and right three fen each; the middle opens four fen as the Way; internally connects the Bright Hall; above it leads to the front gate of the Heavenly Court. On the left side of the Guardian Inch is the Red Terrace, shaped like the gate towers of a city, with red jade all about; the tower’s middle has windows; curtains all in blue; and gods dwell within. On the right side is the Yellow Gate; the gate is like the tower, also square and open outside, made of yellow jade; the gate’s middle has windows; curtains all purple; and gods dwell within. The nine palace True Spirits enter and leave through the path between the Yellow Gate and Red Terrace; thus the Way has the Terrace Gate on left and right to manage irregular qi and watch the True Spirits coming and going. This is description only, not for meditative thought. The place where the nine palaces’ True Spirits enter and exit is so; though there is the Supreme Emperor’s faithful fate, it may not immediately be present; thus two gods always hold bells to guard and protect, just as city gates are guarded. The cave chamber says that entry through the Purple Gate means the Dipper Star; entering from the middle of it into the cave chamber, not only from inside the Yellow Gate and Purple Gate; this is but one name. Each palace has front and rear gates to communicate; above the cave chamber the four palaces have connections; from the front gate of the Heavenly Court, still downward through the Guardian Inch Terrace Gate to outside; only the Mud Pellet Palace has a lower gate to connect with the throat and the middle and lower two palaces. The Purple Gate Great God is named Peaceful One, styled Law King, on the right side. The Azure Chamber Great God is named True Heart, styled Exact Square, on the left side. These two gods dwell inside the chamber gates; thus they are not called by the Terrace Gate. Their form is like infants, like newborns, jade coloured, sitting facing each other. Each wears clothes coloured as their chamber gates; the right purple, the left blue, both veils, not brocade. Each holds a flowing golden bell, each holding one bell, both hands grasping the bell; the flowing golden bell is a fire bell; without material and shining red; shaped like fire burning. These two gods’ bodies also have the qi of wind and cloud, brilliantly guarding the domain of the Guardian Inch. When reclining at night and meditating, if meditating only on the nine palaces at evening, at first sleep also meditate thus; if encountering the night of guarding the nine palaces, before sleeping meditate thus again. First imagine the two great gods in model form as seen, close breath, meditate fully as per their forms; once in their palaces, it is as if seeing them. Call their names three times, chanting thus in the heart: The Purple Gate Great God named Peaceful One, styled Law King, two two two two; the Azure Chamber Great God named True Heart, styled Exact Square, two two two two. Thus connect the qi and softly pray:

Purple Gate and Azure Chamber, there are two great gods, hands hold flaming bells, body born of wind and cloud, protect the true way; not hearing outside; make me think and feel; penetrate the spiritual passes; come and go smoothly; ascend the nine gates; behold the nine truths; the Supreme One’s honored six tones. When prayer is finished, then meditate upon the Three Ones and Cave Chamber’s nine ways and essential ways. The nine ways are the ways of the nine palaces. Those who cultivate singly the Bright Hall, Cave Chamber, or Mysterious Elixir all first meditate and pray thus. The wonder of the Female One also follows this method. The nine palaces in the head have two gods; the left god is superior, next the right. If there are three gods, the middle is superior, then left, then right. At the beginning of meditation and cultivation, one must begin from below; thus in the Guardian Inch first the Purple Gate, in the Cave Chamber first the White Origin; in the Bright Hall first the left side; females are generally more honored than males. Only the Elixir Field Imperial Hometown is the essence and transformation of my body, not an external item; hence it is the last to be meditated upon. If the upper palace is not beneath the body, then the left is superior, next the middle, next the right.

Bright Hall

After meditating on the Guardian Inch, next meditate here. If not guarding One, using this alone is also good. If one guards One above, doing this is also without blame; those who can combine both are even better. On the left is the Bright Youth True Lord, named Xuan Yang, styled Shao Qing; meditate as male form. On the right is the Bright Maiden True Lord, named Wei Yin, styled Shao Yuan; meditate as female form. In the center is the Bright Mirror Spirit Lord, named Zhao Jing, styled Si Ming; meditate as male form. These three lords govern the Bright Hall Palace together; all wear brocade green clothes, belts with four jade bells; mouth holding a red jade mirror; mirror and bells all red. Up and down all wear green brocade clothes, belts with four red jade bells; one each front, back, left, right; mouth holding a red jade mirror at the nose; the mirror face outward. Though the bells and mirror have substance, their red light illuminates the cave, bright and clear, its sound resounds throughout the nine palaces. Head like a baby, form likewise, sitting facing outward or facing each other. Like newborns, golden light, jade colour; by day the three face outward, by night left and right face inward. This is the Bright Hall’s way. If guarding One and then meditating on the Bright Hall, at this point call their titles and names three times: #1 Bright Youth True Lord named Xuan Yang styled Shao Qing, two two two two; Bright Maiden True Lord named Wei Yin styled Shao Yuan, two two two two; Bright Mirror Spirit Lord named Zhao Jing styled Si Ming, two two two two. Then knock teeth nine times to end, then next meditate on the Cave Chamber. If not guarding One, and only doing later matters, also first meditate thus; then follow later methods.

If the Daoist fears, that is, one who cultivates the Way, having dwelt in the mountains alone and is free from demons’ attack, yet the heart is not at peace and trembles in fear, this method should be used. Meditate on the three gods; cause the jade bells to sound; make the sound heard in the Supreme Ultimate; each of the three gods shakes a bell; with four bells on the waist belt, the hearing is awakened; the sound shakes and resounds in the heaven of the Supreme Ultimate Palace. Meditate causing the red mirror to emit light, ten thousand zhang long, also feel the mirror light coming forth from the Guardian Inch, illuminating the four directions, encircling fifty li each side and one hundred sixty-six steps four chi; wherever one dwells, first walk the four sides around; when arriving at some mountain, village, or boundary, let it accord with these numbers; then when meditating on the light, let the carp reach here and stop; then it is easy. Each matter must be done with such precision; not only this one method. After all meditations, call the three lords’ names three times; knock teeth nine times; all evil spirits are subdued; myriad ghosts vanish. After meditation call the names and positions as above in sequence. This one article is the method to dispel evil spirits and myriad demons.

If the Daoist is thirsty, this means thirst for drink; or perhaps it also means famine and thirst. Also meditate on the three lords, each breathing red qi from the mouth to pour into one’s own mouth; the mouth then inhales and swallows; in a moment one is satisfied. This should be meditating on breathing out red qi into the Guardian Inch, dense and entering my mouth; the mouth inhales and swallows countless; practice breathing out and swallowing, as much as to be full. This one article is the method to stop hunger and thirst.

If the Daoist travels at night and cannot see the road, again meditate on the three lords; following previous matters, hence the text comes. Make the mouth emit three fire lights to illuminate ahead; in a moment the road is bright. This also breathes out a red light, shaped like fire’s brightness, coming from the Guardian Inch, extending forward and far illuminating clearly. Meditate as if seeing with the eye; when bright, then go; when going, do not rest. This one article is the method to illuminate darkness.

If one travels through danger and difficulty, in a place of weapons and soldiers, unable to sit or stand or flee to a deserted place, where worldly matters are full of suspicion and suddenly urgent, and there is no way to ward off or protect, this method is made manifest. Even those with sharp insight may use it, hence it is not only for the eyes of Daoists. Quickly meditate on the three lords; cause the jade bells to sound; intensify the thought; each shakes the four bells vigorously; vibrate the red mirror light; to cover and strike the enemies and dangerous places; when armor meets this light, it immediately collapses. The enemy’s heart naturally is terrified and frightened; no longer dares to harbor hostile intent. ‘Cut’ means to cut off; it may also mean harm. This one article is the method to dispel danger and evil.

If the Daoist wishes to seek longevity and immortality, when illness and distress come seeking rescue and life, one should lie correctly, reclining, grasp firmly, close breath, close eyes, calm the heart; first imitate and meditate on the sun and moon in the Bright Hall, sun on the left, moon on the right; meditate on the three lords as above. Meditate on the Bright Hall three lords, all facing outward kneeling long. Night meditation also lets them face outward. This person’s form lying down, the spirits also recline, yet still in long kneeling posture as if standing. All the spirits within the body have lying posture, and meditation here is brightness, like the Guardian Inch Terrace Gate; how can they turn back? Thus they attach to the form and are sideways, yet one must imagine sitting. Breathe out red qi causing light to penetrate my body all around; each emits red mirror light qi, coming forth from Guardian Inch and gradually surrounding the body. My mouth by swallowing red qi, endlessly many, should close eyes and swallow lightly, inhaling and swallowing the qi penetrating; only feel it rushing in and down the chest and abdomen. In a moment the red qi surrounding the body changes to fire; fire burns the body; body and fire become one; inside and outside are thoroughly illuminated; lasting a long while then stops. This is like the method to bind the soul; causing fire to burn through the body and wrap bones and flesh, like the state of charcoal is fine. It is called Sun and Moon Refining the Form; death is followed by rebirth. At the first encounter with disease, this method should be used to cure it. If waiting till critical illness, fearing meditation will no longer be precise, then at slightest feeling immediately practice. This one article is the Way to cure and dissipate diseases; may be done at any time.

Also, if done at evening sleep, one will surely not die for many years. It means to do it night after night, to seek longevity; though not the highest method, yet just not dying; this is a minor Way worthy of regard. This one article is the method to simultaneously cultivate longevity, commonly used in the Bright Hall family.

Also often meditate on swallowing red qi so that one’s complexion returns to youth, colour like a child. This is not curing disease; and at evening sleep meditation it is also commonly practiced to meditate on swallowing red qi; also meditate on the three lords expelling from the mouth, coming out from the Guardian Inch, downward entering my mouth and swallowing. This one article is the Way to restore youth.

Thus ends the essentials of the Bright Hall. All these matters of the Bright Hall are seven articles, all complete methods, except that there is no prayer formula; according to the usual True Way, this is also the Bright Hall family method; and meditation and prayer are especially subtle; also fearing the Bright Hall has a separate supreme scripture; this transmission is probably an excerpt.

At dawn, always swallow saliva thirty times; wipe face and rub eyes as routine; swallowing saliva produces red nectar saliva. This one article corresponds to the Bright Hall family matters. Where ‘always’ is mentioned, it means those practicing the Bright Hall longevity method should do so daily; it may also be combined with the guarding family’s use; though both methods are practiced, they are the same practice.

Cave Chamber

Also practice the Cave Chamber in addition; from the Guardian Inch, Bright Hall, then Cave Chamber; only then may one reach the Elixir Field; thus it is said one should practice together and not skimp in the middle. Within the Cave Chamber is the Yellow Gate and Purple Gate, the Chamber of Mysterious Essence; the Three Ones True Lords of the body’s residence. These Yellow Gate and Purple Gate are not the Guardian Inch but in the Cave Chamber Palace separately; like the Mysterious Elixir’s Purple Room and Green Chamber. The upper Emperor Lord sometimes enters therein; the jade character stored is this. The middle and lower two Ones do not dwell therein; this speaks of the Three Ones; using the title Lord, meaning the Emperor Lord is the honored lord of the Three Ones. Practicing together, seeing the One God is quicker. The more meditations, the more rapid the effect. The Cave Chamber True Man must guard One as the foundation; from outside to inside, from beginning to end; the root comes from One and rises. The True Man guarding One requires the Cave Chamber as the canopy; the light and majesty cover and shade, to complete the Way. Thus the Three Ones must be united; the Cave Chamber mutual; though their residences differ, in the effect of Way use they must be equal. The Way of the Nine Palaces is each palace used; for combined cultivation, the more the better; though the matters differ, they do not obstruct each other; but the scripture is difficult and incomplete; truly the learner is like a shoulder-bearer; none has grasped even a fraction. Within the Cave Chamber are three true spirits; left is Worthless Hero Lord; right is White Origin Lord; center is Yellow Old Lord; three govern the Cave Chamber; this is the Way of the Flying True, with a separate scripture. These three true spirits are the constant gods of the Cave Chamber; the nine true spirits are used as illusion and transformation; separating the White Origin and Worthless Hero into one true; also White Origin is in the lungs, does not enter the Cave Chamber, and in the jade characters only Yellow Old Lord is mentioned.

Thus ends Secret Instructions on Ascending to the True, Scroll I.

### Secret Instructions on Ascending to the True, Scroll II

Lady Yunlin said: When lying at night, first quickly close the eyes, face east; according to later words, one should practice at times of vital qi; thus early evening lying down is not suitable; after the hour of Zi (11 pm – 1 am) lying and feeling, then get up and sit to practice; before noon all may count and pray; only mind the east face, do not follow the four seasons. Use the thumb of the hand to press the back of the palm, left and right, rubbing eyes then ear gates, until the two palms meet at the nape after thirty-nine times; this is close to the back of the palm, starting from the thumb edge; first gently press the eyes, as said; then rub eyes left and right, rub ear gates, meet at back of nape; do again until thirty-nine times stop. Within the eyes each has purple, green, and red three-coloured qi issuing before the eyes. This is internal pressing of the three elements qi to nourish the child within. At the appointed time, meditate on the three-coloured cloud light dense, issuing on the face; after thirty-nine times, pause briefly; suspecting moving the three qi, causing brightness to irrigate the child of the eyes, then do again. Dark prayer says:

Eye child’s three clouds, two eyes’ true lords, bright and clear directing essence, opening and connecting clear spirit, Supreme Mysterious cloud instrument, spirit delicate and graceful, guarding the twin gateways, opening and penetrating the nine gates, all points respond in sound, morning fluid Mud Pellet, body ascends Jade Palace, arrayed as Supreme True six tones. Prayer finished, then swallow saliva fifty times; open eyes as routine. Sitting up may practice; not necessary at night; must be at vital qi time. After about a year, ears and eyes become sharp and bright; long practice, see through a thousand li; catch and reflect spirits; hear the most distant sounds. This also is the superior Way of the True Immortal; not merely to brighten eyes and open ears. I, Canglang, the square-foot Immortal, always treasure and practice it. This Way comes from the Supreme Four Bright Kings Scripture; transmission only after swearing with gold and blue; then begin practice. Seeking the Way of ear and eye, none is more excellent than this method; thus the oath was established to receive and apply it. All matters of cultivation, meditation, and prayer should also swear to the Mysterious Master; otherwise no effect; gold and blue have much in human intention.

Right side, Yunlin informs Yang Shu.

On one side of the face, always desire to use both hands to rub and wipe, to make warm; high and low follow the form; all make full circles. First rub and clap the two palms to make warm; then rub the face and eyes many times; then clap palms again and rub; four or five times thus; then measure the hands behind the neck and both temples; rub temples mutually; upwards following the scripture, like combing hair; several tens of times then stop. This method is indeed a good prescription to dispel old age and restore whiteness. The character here is to be interpreted as the literal use of the character.

Right side, from the Danjing Scripture, causes the face to have lustre, no wrinkles or spots appear, hair not white, pulse not floating externally; practice five years, complexion like a young maiden; called the method of the mountain and river flow of qi, constantly full and unending. This is what is spoken in the lower grade Danjing Dao Essence Scripture, saying ‘constantly like the mountain and river flow of qi, always filled and the wood and stone flourish and moisten.’ Chief steward Shu.

Lying down and rising, need not be early; whenever lying or rising may do this. Control qi and calm qi; make breathing slow and slight. Sit upright, facing the moon ruler’s direction; first cross hands, then reverse; stretch arms fully forward; then reach back to cover the nape; then look upward, raise the nape; lift both hands, hands strive to do it three or four times and stop. ‘Raise’ also means ‘rise’; after crossing hands covering the nape, raise the nape, exert force and strive fully, then lower gently; thus three or four times; one should also hear the neck bones sound; ‘raise’ may also be written as ‘with.’ Afterward, move and bend body, loosen hands, lower head and bend waist; turn back; legs may rise and lean. Stretch hands in four directions; lift both hands above head; exert force spreading to both sides; from front then back together; still spread and stretch. Spread and stretch and pull sideways; first bend waist and spread; then again clasp hands following the body; stretch body left and right; pull sideways and shake off. Declare and shake the hundred joints; then move the limbs, legs, arms, knees, all make full circles. Do this three times; each such matter, do three times; then repeat; not to do all at once. This is the secret formula. Means to move the four limbs; not all recorded; the secret formula carefully indicates the form and use; means one should practice as annotated.

Right side, from the Great Cave True Scripture, Essence Scenery Massage chapter; causes one’s essence and blood to flow freely; wind qi does not enter; able to practice long; not die nor fall ill. This is the example of the Great Cave; the scroll title is very many, not only thirty-nine chapters; later it mentions the Great Cave Essence Scenery upper scroll, also the Great Cave Repelling Evil Great Prayer, and so forth; thus all are not few. Chief steward Shu.

Lying down and rising, first use a cloth like thick silk to rub the four sides of the nape and behind the ears, all in circles; warm and gentle. Follow hair rubbing the nape, like combing hair innumerably. Long after, rub both hands to treat face and eyes; all completed, swallow saliva thirty times to guide internal fluid. Means when lying or rising, first face the ruler and do this method; then cross hands and reverse for other matters.

Right side, from the Great Cave Essence Scenery Scripture upper passage; long practice causes one’s eyes to be bright; evil qi does not dry; form and body not soiled or produce filth. Chief steward Shu.

If the body is not calm, meaning feeling some unwell place but no definite suffering, then reverse the tongue to block the throat; rinse saliva and swallow countless times; strongly curl tongue upward to block throat and rinse and swallow. In a moment the unset ailment disappears; at the time one should feel the body relaxed and soft. May also concurrently practice the various massage and meditation and prayer methods herein.

Right side, from the Dispersing Massage Supreme Spirit preface. Dispersing Massage chapter title also like the Great Cave chapters; examples are not few. Chief steward Shu.

Right side, so far these nearly forty matters, yet unclear what truth is told.

Ears desire many presses to suppress left and right, also many; to make hearing clear and penetrating; called managing the city walls; named recording the Imperial Register. One True scripture says managing the city walls; meaning the ears are the domain of one face, so should be managed. The nose also desires pressing left and right many times, to make qi balanced; called watering the central mountain; named recording the Imperial Register. The nose is the mountain of the face, the inner view called the mountain in the center of heaven. Carefully cultivate the nose; hairs in the nostrils also desire many to be destroyed and removed; always kept clean and sharp. These two matters may be done at leisure; use hands to press and suppress, rub and treat many times up and down; thus the city walls are strong and complete; the mountain peaks stand tall and elegant; the Imperial Register may be obtained and recorded.

Right side, these two methods, from the Great Square Platform, used by Mistress Li of the Spirit; from the Dispersing Massage Scripture upper chapter; the character ‘Zhao’ should be ‘Zhao’, a writing error. Chief steward Shu.

Always able to cover mouth and nose with hands, breathing slightly at the eyes; long time hands produce fluid; rub and wipe face and eyes; often practice, causes the body to be fragrant. Using both hands vertically covering nose and mouth, cause breathing to flow under the hands; must have fluid; then rub and wipe; finally cover again; no fixed number; also causes one’s complexion to shine.

From the Stone View Red Character Scripture.

Always desire to press eyes and nostril corners with hands, holding breath to do so; qi flows then stops; exhale then begin again; continually practice; eyes then become penetrating. Use the two hands’ third fingers near the nose, press the lower inner corners of the eyes; no fixed number; open qi, slightly raise fingers, close again and press; may also be thirty-nine times.

From the Supreme Heavenly Pass Three Scriptures. Note that the lower grade eye has the Heavenly Pass Three Map Scripture; possibly ‘Map’ is missing. 

Always desire to close eyes when lying down, calm body and qi; make it like lying; so others do not notice; this day and night is without fixed time; not only when wishing to lie down; place pillow flat and face the correct direction; regulate qi and quiet. Then look inward and listen far to the four directions; cause my ears and eyes to attend to a million li lying; long practice; also see ten thousand li lying affairs; with sharp mind do so; then see ten thousand li lying affairs. Later it says to first arise one direction; thus each direction each meditate; all finished; then meditate on the four directions as if hearing and seeing. Initially the ears and eyes attend east; let one see mountains, rivers, cities, hear mysterious sounds; vaguely form images; feel my ears and eyes seeing and hearing far away; faintly forget form; this is good; should begin from one li, ten li, hundred li, thousand li, gradually extending. Also in the ears always hear music of gold, jade, silk, bamboo; this is a wondrous method. At first meditate hearing it; later actually hear it. The four directions means, generally speaking; first arise one direction, then inwardly watch and listen; initially no imitation; long time sincerely enter the mystery. The ways of cultivation and meditation are all thus; if years do not accumulate and sincere thought not deep, the principle not understood, one may think no effect soon and abandon; worshipping stones and bowing to mountains may be called having aspiration.

From the Purple Crossing Flame Light Scripture, inward vision of the center direction.

Sit often desiring to close eyes and look inward; meditate seeing the five viscera and intestines; long time practice; naturally clearly distinguished. When meditating, imagine their form, colour, sequence, size; as if self-speaking; their names and order; and note the twenty-four spirits; no longer two records.

From the Dan Character Purple Scripture Three Five Sequential Practice Scripture.

Before eating do not mention death matters; do not expose food; so evil spirits do not come. When eating, always face one’s life and ruler qi; all warm food must not be uncovered; ghosts and evil spirits delight to come first to feast; then the leftover taste becomes turbid and impure; also causes disease. Often bathe; each Jiazi day should bathe; if not, then each month’s first day, to let one be clear and spiritual. The ‘month’ means odd months; that is first, third, fifth, seventh, ninth, eleventh months; if the month contains Jiazi day, then bathe again. To dispel corpse, use the four seasonal ruler days; the immortal taboo days are the eleventh day of the eleventh month; the nine truths also use third day of third month, and fifth day of fifth month; all should bathe; if one month passes once or twice, that is best. Bathing is not about frequency; but people’s inability. Bathing dispels corpse stench and lets true qi enter. Zi Yang True Man said: bathing many times dispels disease qi, removes accumulated faults, and also leads the steps of true attainment. Mistress Zi Wei said: bathing not many times is the nature of the po; violating the po is turning back; refining one’s turbidity, the po dies itself. Knowing this, bathing must be frequent; this matter is easy; in winter months hot water is scarce and difficult to obtain. When washing one should always meditate on the Six Ding, to make all things as wished. The Six Ding are six spirit maidens; this spirit is good at communicating with people; easy to meditate and summon; should also face where the Six Ding are; the Jiazi ten days means facing Mao. The Jade Maiden has another name and dress colour, in the spiritual fly. Hair combing faces the ruler; means the monthly branch’s direction; comb and wash hair all this. The immortal taboo forbids combing facing north; now the eleventh month is established; Zi should still face Hai; this is true north and must not be violated. When first combing, at the beginning of combing, pray and comb; and softly pray thus:

Mud Pellet Mysterious Flower, Preserve essence and long-lasting, left is hidden moon, right is sun root, six harmonies refined, hundred spirits receive grace. Prayer finished, swallow saliva three times. In this prayer it says left moon right sun; this is yin and yang mutually entering, thus the Purple Script’s three souls fly essence meaning, hence the hidden root’s sight. Mysterious Flower is the name of the hair spirit; Six Harmonies is the temple under the temples. All prayers have meaning and teaching, not only this text.

Right side, eight articles of the Mysterious Master Lady of Southern Mountain, ordered to be practiced. Chief steward Shu.

For hair combing face the ruler; at beginning of combing no hair character; takes beginning as initial. Soft prayer said:

Mud Pellet Mysterious Flower, Preserve essence and long-lasting, left is hidden moon, right is sun root, six harmonies refined, hundred spirits receive grace. Prayer finished, swallow saliva three times. Lady of Southern Mountain has already received this method; now Lady An also reports it; it seems unaware of each other yet method is the same. Constantly practicing it, hair does not fall and the sun rises. Count combings and change combs; comb many times without causing pain; means many combings; Purple Wei also says change combs; this is to prevent combing once and getting hot and damaging head and hair. Now use four or five combs alternating to cool. May also have attendant comb often. Practitioners’ clothes and seats should not let others near; how can one let others comb the hair? One should do it oneself. Thus blood and qi do not stagnate; hair roots remain firm.

Right side, according to Nine Blossoms’s report for use, from the Supreme Ultimate Green Scripture. Chief steward Shu.

The True Declaration says: combing hair and arranging hair, desire many passes, allow free flow of blood and qi, disperse wind and dampness. Frequently change combs; also need not loosen hair. Combing hair is frequent mantra three true words; this is urgent to practice; also should diligently inform the Immortal Marquis to make it the Way to restore whiteness.

Right side, Mistress Zi Wei speaks. Chief steward Shu.

If treading or covering filth or other unclean places, one should bathe and loosen the form to remove it. The method uses ten liang of bamboo leaves; all bamboo leaves may be used; the essence above the northern machine does not specify its kinds. Also four liang of peeled white peach skin; dry may be used; the peach skin is of edible fruit, also good when fresh from mountains; not mountain peach. Both used by ancient weights; dry peach skin is halved. Using clear water one dou two dou, boil in a cauldron; allow one boil only; not to make strong. Take out and cool to warm; bathe the body; remove all stench and bad qi; also repel dampness, rheumatism, sores and itching; bamboo is hollow and pure white internally; peach repels evil and removes filth; thus these two things are used to remove dregs and turbidity in the form. Bamboo is hollow and pure and upright; peach governs expelling filth; both qi mutually needed to form. The Ritual says: When the sovereign mourns ministers, the shamans first remove with peach branches. This also is to remove evil qi. After heaven and man return below, never without using this water to cleanse. When a true man descends to the world, his essence must be stained by filth qi; using peach and bamboo at named mountains with palaces to bathe. This speech may be also of the fierce persons; if so, immortals are not much different from men; only able to transcend void and not die. As for worldly talisman waters for rinsing and prayers, outer lying near methods, none compare with this method. Formerly there was method to dispel stench; compared with this is like Peilou and Fanghu. If bathing, even better, but not using this water to bathe hair; refining corpse essence pulp, appropriate for bathing. After bathing, also use ordinary method to wash hair; not use this water. If after bathing wash with this water little by little, that is also not blameworthy. This water also called refining corpse essence pulp, only for bathing. Removing stench is urgent for learners; this secret prescription is worth a thousand gold pieces.

Right side, Mistress Zi Wei Wang ordered for use; from the Supreme Ultimate Nine Changes and Ten Transformations New Scripture. Chief steward Shu.

When taking immortal medicines, always face one’s life; after swallowing, do not speak of death or calamity; violating the fetus and injuring the spirit is useless. All medicines for immortals and world formulas are so; only the initial Spirit Pill and Golden Elixir say to face east.

Right side, Eastern Minister reports to Yang Jun; chief steward shu, two books.

Lord said: Always at midnight, leave pillow and lie flat; grasp firmly and release the body; regulate qi gently; body and spirit are complete. If not complete, quickly arise, burn incense, sit upright, close eyes, grasp firmly on knees; mind the body and spirit; make white qi in both eyes like a chicken’s egg, size of an egg, before the eyes; then restore; five days once practice. This method is after meditating the twenty-four spirits, only says to meditate spirit, not its origin; should be describing that matter. The white qi in the eyes is the Way of the Bright Mirror; only practice once every five days; only the mirror matter, not full spirit like this; perhaps should be cross-referenced for use; now having cultivated the great scripture, may omit this.

Lord said: The regulating method causes eyes to be bright; long time see through; the twenty-four spirits call it the Way of the Dispersing Child; method to thoroughly see the twenty-four spirits. Always on Jiazi ten days, use day Gengwu, at noon, take east-flowing clear water with true elixir; use one dou water, two zhu pearl; facing the monthly branch left, stir two seven times. Use to wash eyes; day facing clear east morning two seven times. Scripture says ten thousand facing east two seven times washing eyes. Always practicing is excellent. This also roughly speaks scripture matters; those who have begun this method no longer use this. All methods and formulas and numbers used often are unverified; matters all like this; this brief explanation is not like original scripture; if not seeing that method, then should use this Way; thus those with white hair without attainment are all of these classes.

Lord said: To pursue the Way, imagine the sun and moon with the eyes; eyes always see shapes of sun and moon; also simultaneously meditate left eye as sun, right eye as moon. Ear hears master’s voice; in ear always hear master’s sound; also words and tones likened to master. Mouth always breathes out dead qi taking in living qi; following four seasons decline and rise breath out dead and take in living; e.g. in spring breath out yellow and take in blue. Form resembles five stars; like Lord Pei meditates; five stars at left, right, front, back, top of head. Usually walk like on clouds; stepping as if in empty clouds; not like walking on a pole or riding a rope. Mind always thinks of longevity; sitting, lying, walking, always remember gods and immortals. Careful about laughter and words; do not laugh without matter; no need for many words. Always think of one’s form; always recognize one’s own face, form, and colour. Essential Way. Though these Ways have no proper technique to cultivate, all are the source and basis of learning.

Right side, two articles of Lord Pei. Chief steward and attendant two books.

Right side, so far nearly thirty-seven matters, all morning bowings, nurturing, use of daily life.

Whenever passing dangerous roads, among ghost temples, in mind having doubt and difficulty, heart having slight avoidance, order those who travel to first reverse the tongue inward, reverse the tongue inward and prop in the throat, before prayer then extend it. Swallow saliva three times; after finish, use left hand’s second and third fingers to pinch the root beneath the two nostrils at the philtrum, the inside boundary of the nasal septum; thirty-six times; pressing quickly, do not raise fingers to count. This quick pressing, counting in quick pressing as one breath as one count’s duration. The inside boundary of the nasal septum is called Mountain Source; also named Ghost Well, Spirit Pool, Evil Root, Soul Terrace. These five names appear later in the prayer; thus first clarify their meaning. Mistress Zi Wei says: The Mountain Source is the base side of the philtrum below the nose, small valley inside the nose. Using a needle to prick it also treats sudden death. After pinching, knock teeth seven times; then advance palm to cover nose; after pinching but not removing hand, still knock teeth; after knocking teeth, advance palm to cover nose and mouth; finger tips to the hairline; bow covering the Bright Hall above. Then face forward; inwardly meditate on the Bright Hall three lords; with bells and mirrors red light shining and cast forth; also meditate on Mud Pellet Red Child Emperor Lord; hold and recite the Great Cave True Scripture to awe and subdue. Then softly pray:

Red Crow soaring heaven, divine power inwardly extended, Mountain Source four garrisons, Ghost Well fled, Spirit Pool breathes out, Evil Root lies hidden, Soul Terrace four lights, Jade Chamber sparkling, Jade True lofty, sitting guarding the Bright Hall, hand waving purple dawn, head erects morning light, chanting the Cave Scripture thirty-nine chapters, containing repelling evil dragons and tigers, cutting mountains and ridges, fierce beasts and bulls, holding knives and swallowing weapons, raising mountains and ringing heavens, divine birds and poisonous dragons, six leaders breathing fire, devouring the king of ghosts, lightning blocking thunder father, controlling stars flowing crosswise, owl pecking and scorching, walking against the wind, heavenly beasts arrayed, all are by my side, breathe fire ten thousand zhang to remove misfortune, myriad spirits open the Way, seal the fallen mountain villages, thousand gods hundred spirits, all bow with heads, marshals holding incense burners, burning incense for me, wherever present and passed, myriad gods welcome. Complete, then knock teeth three times; open eyes, remove left hand; then excite the spiritual root; heavenly hunters come to guard; myriad spirits tremble and submit; none dare harm my qi. In this prayer are names of divine beasts and spiritual officers; thus able to terrify and expel evil spirits.

Right side, from the Great Cave True Scripture High Upper Inner Chapter, Great Repelling Evil Great Prayer Upper Method. Chief steward Shu.

Northern Emperor’s method to kill ghosts: first knock teeth thirty-six times; then incant:

Heavenly Peng, Heavenly Peng, nine origins kill children, Five Ding chief commanders, High Knife Northern Lord, Seven Governments Eight Spirits, Supreme Vast Fierce, Long-headed Giant Beast, hand holds Emperor Bell, Plain Owl three gods, strict carriage Kui Dragon, mighty sword Divine King, cut evil and destroy traces, purple qi rides heaven, cinnabar glow glaring, swallow demons eat ghosts, cross body drink wind, blue tongue green teeth, four-eyed old man, heavenly Ding strong man, mighty south resists evil, heavenly steed fierce and violent, mighty north bites blade, three hundred thousand soldiers guard my ninefold, dispel corpses a thousand li, remove misfortune and evil, dare any little ghost, wish to see form, chain heaven great axe, cut ghosts five forms, Flame Emperor tears blood, Northern Dipper burns bones, four lights break bones, heavenly plan destroys species, divine knife one strike, myriad ghosts collapse themselves. Complete; four words one bite of teeth as rhythm. There are thirty-six sentences, then three plus six bites of teeth.

If in dark night or day the prayer is obtained, it is a constant prayer; this has no fixed time to practice; when idle or at early or late night, in places of doubt and darkness, one may pray. Soft words. Ghosts have three kinds affected by this prayer; eyes blind and rot; body then immediately dies. This means killing ghosts, evil ghosts, and all evil strong ghosts in heaven and earth; hearing this they die; not the souls of dead men who become ghosts. Such ghosts with eyes have eyes; thus blindness causes immediate death. This highest divine prayer is the name officers to cut ghosts; the incantation contains the office ranks of Fengdu and various gods’ names; thus ghosts hearing it are terrified and die. Xu certain commands three hundred southern soldiers; these repel dangers; Flame Emperor is the Hai Emperor; four lights are the lords. Northern Emperor keeps this secret method; is said to dispatch ghosts and spirits; when encountering this prayer, they cannot escape; hence the method is secret. If worldly men obtain this prayer and can perform it, then it is the Way of not dying. When men die, all are killed by ghosts and gods; now this cannot be taken, so it is never dying. Men, women, big and small, all may be examined; only fearful is not knowing this incantation; those who know secretly use it; then infinite for big or small. These words seem to be directed to inform the chief steward’s household. When ill or dying, practice this and surely recover. Ghosts flee; illness is surely removed. When knocking teeth, face forward meditate seeing five viscera, fully five spirits, naturally meditate. Means first knock at the twenty-six times of the mountain ridge; then face inward and see; meditate fully on five viscera in order; all made clear; five viscera spirits all present inside; then may ride the correct qi to control evil and command spirits; next exterminate ghosts. Fengdu secretly keeps this prayer law; now secretly given; not to be disclosed except for those with Way; share it secretly. Though not the highest scripture of the Supreme True, this is the highest art of cutting ghosts; when danger is removed, then correct qi may be controlled; also used to exterminate evil to test; this is the essential method for learners. Yet many people lightly regard its shallowness; thus transmission is lost; divine incantations lose efficacy; refusal to perform is very blameworthy.

Right side, Yang Jun, attendant books, two versions.

Luo Feng Mountain is in the northern Gui direction; above and below are ghost and spirit palaces and chambers. The mountain has six palaces; caves have six palaces; all have the same names and images. The first palace named Zhou’s Severing Yin Heaven Palace; then eastward, second palace named Great Killing Honest Affairs Ancestor Heaven Palace; third palace named Bright Morning Enduring Violent City Heaven Palace; fourth palace named Tranquil Shining Crime Qi Heaven Palace; fifth palace named Ancestor Spirit Seven No Heaven Palace; sixth palace named Daring Commander Connecting Wanlue Heaven Palace. These six palaces inside and outside have the same names; the first is most to the west; next east arranged, south facing; each palace surrounds a thousand li; all are the mansions of ghosts and spirits. Those in the world who know the six gates of Fengdu’s six heavenly palaces, a hundred ghosts dare not harm. Previously said stone is palace name; here and in incantations also said to be gate names; thus gate named from palace; hence same name only. Ghosts hearing men know these names say they are the lord of these palaces; thus dare not molest and harm. Before lying, first face north and pray three times, softly sound. Also slight incline to Gui; make one round prayer; then knock teeth six times; then repeat prayers; all three times and stop. Prayer says:

I am the Supreme Disciple, commanding six heavens; six heavens’ palaces are my domain; not only my domain, but also the Supreme Lord’s; I know the six heavens’ palace names; therefore long life; dare to offend, Supreme Lord cuts off your form. The first palace named Zhou’s Severing Yin Heaven Palace; then eastward; second palace named #1. One round, one hundred and nineteen characters. From here onward in order to the six palaces only. Calling out in order the palace names written before. Then knock teeth six times; then lie down. Three times done; then proceed with other matters; this is lying down, only doing one method.

Expelling all ghost and evil qi, at evening first pray the Stone Bamboo Scripture; then read this item: Liang City composes Feng Palace Ode:

Zhou’s Severing marks Emperor Morning, Honest Affairs build heavy arch. Flame like sky’s marriage, rising like radiant brilliance. Martial Sun wears divine blade, Tranquil Shining swallows clear river. Changhe faces cinnabar well, cloud gate dense and lofty. Seven No passes miraculous canopy, Connected Wan also spreads demons. Six heavens cross northern path; this is the home of ghosts and spirits.

The ode has twenty thousand words; now only the six heavens’ palace names excerpted; may be softly read at night; also called to repel ghosts. Since these have palace gate names, ghosts also fear them. According to previous, the third palace named Martial City; now the ode says Martial Sun; perhaps two names; or different meaning; seemingly not mistaken.

Right side, two articles of Middle Lord report; Yang Jun, attendant, two books.

When traveling at night, always knock teeth; knocking teeth has no fixed number; killing ghosts and evil ghosts always fear the knocking teeth sound; thus do not molest men. Killing ghosts is done by Fengdu Supreme Lord’s agents; evil ghosts are the evil spirits and monsters of heaven and earth harming men. If combined with rinsing saliva and incantation, better. Immortal formulas say: always swallow saliva and knock teeth; makes one return to youth. Knocking teeth means no outer ghost invasion; inner spirits always guard; swallowing saliva harmonizes qi, muscles and marrow moist; thus no disease and no aging.

Right side, Middle Lord report; Yang Jun, attendant, two books.

In the world are low earth evil strong ghosts; often take female form to confuse and test men; old strong evil ghosts are skilled in such transformations; not only women; also according to persons’ preferences transform accordingly; all to cause confusion and inability to distinguish. Beginners’ hearts are not yet pure; often harbor evil thoughts; often attract such matters; thus order to repel them. If such exist, then close breath, think of the Heng and Fu stars in the Heavenly Pass; constellations’ images; Xuan Heng Fu Bi all in the Guardian Inch; pointer finger is the front body spirit. Correct colour; steady will and intention; carefully watch the pearl in the regulation square; if the pearl is turbid and unclear, then the ghost tests. Must make convenient approach; also look at their eyes; if the child is dim, know it is not an immortal, then it is an evil ghost. May also try with Bright Mirror to reflect it. Knowing the ghost tests, think of the seven stars in front; may also be above the head; to dispel it. Also think of the seven stars emerging from the Guardian Inch covering the head; pointer finger forward; strike it; may also silently recite Heavenly Eye, Heavenly Peng and other incantations. The regulation square is square and bright; immortal Daoist. Though not square and upright, yet eyes clear; also is a gentle person; fire sun shines on it and has no shadow; more proof. The awakened bows; the unawakened fail the test; if meet evil and call it True Man, also a failure; be cautious. These two things are most difficult to distinguish; in the second scroll’s precepts and order, they are discussed in full detail.

Right side, Lord Pei reports; chief steward and attendant two books.

Right side, so far six matters, all to exterminate evil demons, and prevent ghost tests.

Bright Hall Inner Scripture opening the heart dispelling delusion talisman, written by Lord Wang; talisman in sixth scroll talisman diagrams and secrets; this is the method to enter the heart Guardian Inch Bright Hall. Also there should be a supreme scripture; now excerpted dispelling delusions. Lord Wang is the chief true supervisor. At sunrise, face ruler, write in cinnabar, bow twice and swallow. At daybreak according to monthly branch, write on white paper in cinnabar; after finish, hold left hand and bow; after bowing pray; after praying swallow. Prayer says:

Five spirits open the heart, hear thoroughly the silent sound, three souls gather essence, all guard the red heart, make me not deluded, five viscera far to seek. After bowing pray; after praying swallow; swallow saliva five times; knock teeth five times; do not let others see. If not using sunrise, then use the first day of month, fifteenth day and twenty-seventh day; three times a month; one year then effective secret talisman. Means not necessary to know sunrise; just a few days; now may also combine; five or six times a month.

Eastern Splendour True Man wearing sun and moon image upper method; this is the Eastern Splendour palace’s men and women to become True Man, still wear this. Thus the method of sun rays, the Azure Lord still meditates. Men wear sun image; women wear moon image; sun one must not omit; causes one to be wise and bright; five viscera form flowers; souls and spirits refined and controlled; six palaces peaceful; Way of longevity and immortality. Always at daybreak facing east, write sun image in cinnabar on blue paper; hold left hand; meditate as sun form like shot ball, red colour with purple rays; then swallow; let enter the heart; brightness illuminates thoroughly. After complete, knock teeth nine times; swallow saliva nine times. Women wear moon image; yellow writing on blue paper; hold right hand; also face east swallow and meditate entering heart. Returning moon; these two characters imitate the true original in cinnabar.

Right side, writing the sun and moon image method; also may write sun in round shape. Now there are square and round; also sun character unchanged; thus should follow this; and the Purple Script Supreme Mysterious talisman has sun character; it is rounded; already called sun and moon image; conveniently resembles sun and moon characters; also ancient books sometimes use moon character; also similar in form; thus the eight shapes writing forms are called pictographic. Now if swallowing round, then character should be thus; all have separate established methods; in talisman diagrams and secrets.

Right side, Yang Jun writes.

Supreme Void True Man Southern Mountain Red Lord internal method says: on the fifth day of the lunar month at midnight, meditate sun image in heart; sun enters by mouth; let it illuminate within one heart; integrate with sun and mutually shine. Sitting or lying at will; first meditate sun red purple light nine rays; suddenly come into the mouth; directly stay in the heart; wrapping cave light as one. After completion, feel heart warm; rosy glow manifests. At the beginning of practice stop meditating until heart warm; long time then truly feel heat; with spirit and mind imagine it; easy to sense effect. Long after, softly pray:

Great Bright nurtures essence, internally refines red heart, light and brightness mutually reflect, divine truth comes seeking. Finished, swallow saliva nine times. At the fifteenth, twenty-fifth, and twenty-ninth days, repeat as above. These three days are odd; also days counted. Later says practice should be often; need not count days; then daily midnight commonly do so. Causes one to be clear and wise; all joints open; face has jade light; body has golden luster. Practice fifteen years; Supreme One sends escort carriage to come receive; ascend to Supreme Heaven. Also one True scripture says: practice five years; Supreme One sends Jade Escort Lord to come receive; perhaps it is written ‘escort carriage’ wrongly. This directly says escort carriage is Jade Escort Lord’s carriage. Practice should be often; need not these counted days.

Right side, one article from the Supreme Ultimate Dispersing Massage Scripture; this is from the Dispersing Massage Wisdom Scripture; Red Lord transcribed it; thus called internal method. Chief steward Shu two books.

Eastern Splendour Palace has wearing sun and moon rays method; True Man already completed still wears this; directly meditate in heart having sun image, as large as coin; in heart; red colour. ‘Directly meditate’ means not entering via the world’s mouth; only seeing sun shape in heart; though as large as coin, not flat; like a shot ball; diameter nine fen; purely red. Also meditate sun with
