## The Supreme Cave-Truth Eightfold Destiny Registers, Upper Fascicle

### Formulae for the Removal of Guilt

The Eightfold Destiny Registers, also called the Eightfold Intervals, or the Eightfold Passages, are otherwise known as the Scripture of the Eightfold Resolution to Untie Knots, Release Bonds, Express Contrition, and Extend Blessings in a Wonderful Manner. The Supreme Lord of the Three Primes received them from the natural pattern; he sealed them within the Purple Chamber of the Supreme Spiritual Capital, guarded by three hundred attendants of golden seals and jade splendour, who kept the incense. The Eastern Sea Child, the Four Extremities Perfected Ones, and the King Lord of the Western City were sealed in the western chamber of Mount Emei. Transmitted but once in myriad kalpas, bearing the mysterious imperial title of Imperial Register inscribed in purple characters, treasured in the Azure Palace—within a thousand years the three transmissions may be heard. The sons of higher learning who do not possess this text will be vainly wearied amid mountains and forests, never attaining the Way.

The so-called Eightfold Paths are the movements of the sun, moon, four seasons, and eight solar terms. The sun travels the equator; the moon travels the ecliptic; the yellow and red paths are the constant courses of yin and yang. As for the Beginning of Spring and the Spring Equinox, the moon travels two courses of the azure path, emerging eastward from the yellow path. At the Beginning of Summer and the Summer Solstice, the moon travels two courses of the red path, emerging south from the yellow path. At the Beginning of Autumn and the Autumn Equinox, the moon travels two courses of the white path, emerging west from the yellow path. At the Beginning of Winter and the Winter Solstice, the moon travels two courses of the black path, emerging north from the yellow path. These are the Eightfold Paths.

On the days when the moon travels the Eightfold Paths, there are various transformations; flight and writhing movements, the flow of vital breath, plants and trees rising and sinking, responding to conditions and sensations, changing the old to the new, the light becoming heavy and the heavy becoming light, good and evil exchanging places, the movement of qi and images follows its course naturally. The Perfected Ones of higher learning, following these transformations, practise to remove calamities and promote auspiciousness, advancing the good and banishing evil, manifesting the abandonment of darkness, entering righteousness to govern wickedness, refining falsehoods into truths, urging the foolish to ascend to sainthood. Their methods are most profound and subtle; this Way is mysteriously thorough; hence it is called the Eightfold Passages, ultimate and boundless.

### The First Destiny Register

On the clear morning of the Beginning of Spring, looking northward, one may see clouds of purple, green, and white—these are the Three Pure Flying Clouds of the Supreme Lord of the Three Primes. One should kneel and press the cheeks nine times each, with the heart offering the Fourfold Salutation, then bow thrice. Then silently recite the secret incantation: "Descendant’s name, today fortunate to encounter the departure of the Three Primes, may longevity be granted, to serve and attend upon the wheel’s hub; the words I speak follow the will of the person. Some petition relief from illness; some beseech escape from calamity; some pray the extinguishing of disaster; some seek the fruition of matters." When three times seeing the clouded chariot and the sun ascending to immortality, no further thought is needed. Those who perform this practice shall assuredly have their names recorded among the immortals; thus it is called the Eightfold Destiny Registers.

---

### The Second Destiny Register

At midnight during the Vernal Equinox, looking northeast, one may see dark blue, yellow clouds—these are the Three Pure Clouds of the Supreme Celestial Emperor of the Supreme Microcosm. One observes the rites and secret incantations as above.

---

### The Third Destiny Register

On the clear dawn of the Beginning of Summer, looking northwest, one may see purple, blue, and yellow clouds—these are the Three Pure Clouds of the Supreme True Lord of the Supreme Ultimate, the Perfected One of the Inner Palace of the Three Primes. Observe rites and secret incantations as above.

---

### The Fourth Destiny Register

On the clear dawn of the Summer Solstice, looking southeast, one may see red, white, and blue clouds—these are the Three Pure Clouds of the Emperor of Fusang. Observe rites and secret incantations as above.

---

### The Fifth Destiny Register

On the clear dawn of the Beginning of Autumn, looking due west, one may see white, red, and purple clouds—these are the Three Pure Clouds of the Supreme True Lord of the Supreme Element, the White Emperor. Observe rites and secret incantations as above.

---

### The Sixth Destiny Register

On the clear dawn of the Autumnal Equinox, looking south, one may see white, red, and yellow clouds—these are the Three Pure Clouds of the Supreme Perfected One of the Southern Pole, the Red Emperor. Observe rites and secret incantations as above.

---

### The Seventh Destiny Register

On the clear dawn of the Beginning of Winter, looking southwest, one may see green, purple, and blue clouds—these are the Three Pure Clouds of the Supreme True Lord of the Upper Clarity, the Imperial Ancestor. Observe rites and secret incantations as above.

---

### The Eighth Destiny Register

On the clear dawn of the Winter Solstice, looking due east, one may see vermilion, blue, and yellow clouds—these are the Three Pure Clouds of the Jade Consort of the Supreme Void, the Supreme True Lord of the Supreme Firmament. Observe rites and secret incantations as above.

---

On the days of the Eightfold Destiny Registers, one should bathe and burn incense one or two hours before sunrise, then look out at the appointed time for about a quarter of an hour, then return indoors. Do not gaze upon the clouds if there is wind or rain. If such clouds are seen on other days unexpectedly, perform the rites and incantations as above; they are thrice as efficacious as on the appointed days.

---

If the guilt and knots of past and present lives are not removed, and contrition is made in vain, forgiveness delayed, achievements difficult to advance, the tests of demons unknown, many reversals incurred, decay and old age come swiftly, ascent difficult to attain, and once gone, nothing returns, suffering in the netherworld without end: the sons of higher learning, awakening to this trembling of the heart, vow to admire and aspire, feeling the mysterious penetration of the spirit, may obtain the Destiny Registers, decisively cutting the root of guilt, untying evil knots, nourishing sources of goodness, daring to resist all evil, rapidly accomplishing true being. They diligently meditate and practise secretly, and there shall be proof.

---

All removals of guilt must begin with the establishment of an abstinence period, strictly observed on the days of the Eightfold Paths, with body and mind purified and severe. Those who are not like-minded must not rashly partake in the Great Way. The holy perfected immortals, male and female, constantly assemble in the Mysterious Capital, observing long fasts and pure gatherings, directing heart and form to transform myriad beings, spreading their conduct to aid all living creatures. All beings have not been without such, transformations and responses never absent, always have the masters and responders in place—the Jade Capital's platform is the place of constant response. Life is never without death; death is never without life; birth and death are innumerable and endless. Heaven and earth are countless; lands are boundless; birth and death succeed one another without rest; arising and ceasing interrelate; being and non-being mutually complete. Life affirms existence; death regards non-existence; nothing is not nothing; something is not something; not something is not not something; constant response is ever present; existence does not perish; wisdom is boundless.

The sons of higher learning mutually gather and proceed, ascending by stages, entering by qi; they conceive spirit, record qi, practise methods, ascend the steps, which is called fasting. Fasting means to be uniform. Washing the heart and purifying the body, heart and body responding mutually, inward and outward alike, refined, reverent, disciplined, consistent throughout, with no disparity, no slackness or substitution, no negligence or pride, peaceful and devoted to the Supreme Way; hence it is called fasting. The methods of fasting are many and cannot be fully recorded; the holy perfected pass them down orally, teaching from mouth to mouth. Various scriptures have rites; here are briefly enumerated some prayers and cautions for careful use, depending on the person.

To learn without fasting is vain labour, like a fireless fuel heap, like a fire without a torch, like ascending to heaven without a cloud-ladder, like flying without the qi of stars; though one strive bodily, can one fulfil the heart’s desire? The heart’s fulfilment must come through fasting; fasting and quietness must precede contrition; if faults are not cleansed, blessings will not come; if blessings do not come, calamities will assuredly ensue; when calamities arrive and cannot be averted, there is no cause to become immortal or saintly. The saints and immortals fast long, concentrate their thoughts, accumulate diligently, remove many faults, sever misfortune and accept auspiciousness, accumulate blessings and great virtue; when virtue is full, one enters the Way, unites with the spirits, and is always joyful without suffering. Those aspiring to this must dispel all dust, vow to observe pure fasting, and employ the Three Primes’ methods. The method chiefly guards unity; unity makes quietness its home; the home is in the human heart, where harmony and smoothness are proper and beautiful, things prized by men. To practise this and to promote it is most difficult; this is because past and present sins and knots entangle, evil demons interfere, and calamities are not easily attracted away.

Urgent is the need to observe fasting at the three times and six times, with great and small vows of repentance, exactly following the victorious words of the Capital. According to the order, when fasting is complete, give alms, relieve hardships, uphold the weak; secretly establish karmic merit, change heart and conduct, diligently build yang virtue, avoid known faults, know faults and do not repeat; if repeated, then again express contrition. After three contritions, disasters vanish and blessings come. If yet unfulfilled, diligently cultivate and do not slacken; if wishes bear fruit and the Way is attained, then rest may be had. After three repetitions no further contrition is permitted; if contrition is not forgiven, be clearly cautious.

### The Threefold Calamities

Before receiving the method, there are first calamities and hardships; after receiving the method, there are second calamities and hardships; since birth, there are third calamities and hardships. These three categories include many causes, some shallow, some deep, too numerous to fully record. Briefly listed and attached are similar cases. Ancestors and present lives, former and present selves, though distant or near, have the same categories of guilt, which must be resolved according to their source, by merit and virtue.

---

### Conditions of Birth and Life

Born into wealth and honour, cultivating both Dao and worldliness, their coming and going calm and safe, joy and happiness attending. Some serve in office or as merchants; some till land or rear silkworms; some fish or hunt as a calling. Though common occupations, they do not indulge in excess, steal, confuse, or disturb; parents do not lament children; rulers do not lament subjects; elder brothers do not lament younger; masters do not lament disciples. The old die free of illness; the young free of trouble, caring for each other; death is sent off, life received; mourning and celebration are in due order. This is called equipoise, and those who preserve it are rare.

The heavens rejoice and no longer establish merit; former blessings exhausted, yet still entering evil paths. Therefore the wise and sagacious wish to be born in the next life, follow masters to practise the Way, receive and confer in mutual completion, attain immortality, long life without death, called higher learning, their work exalted above the mean. Equipoise may rise, then the higher learning is attainable; the method of higher learning is not for the ordinary and lowly to discuss.

### The Twenty-Four Conditions of Guilt and Their Remedies

1. Frequent bereavements, of grandfathers, teachers, rulers, relatives, near and distant, old and young, not due to proper calamities, oneself clad in mourning, sharing the calamity. Guilt arises from unfilial conduct, rebellion against superiors, self-considered exhortation of others without repentance. Remedy: use gold and silk, buying many living beings, feeding and releasing them, each finding its place.

2. Infantile sicknesses, born often ill, one illness after another affecting the family and oneself, included in the third category. Guilt arises from lack of benevolence, injury to contained qi, laughing at others’ sufferings, cursing and wishing sickness. Remedy: use wine and medicine, placed at city gates and market places, in poor and destitute areas.

3. Public and private affairs, though not one’s fault nor forcibly connected, among nobles and commoners, men and women, relatives and strangers. Guilt arises from harshness, fondness for dispute and litigation, restraint and oppression of the living creatures. Remedy: use paper, brush, vermilion ink, and knives; give these to people encountered, no need to explain the source.

4. Quarrels and slanders, among Daoists and laymen, blind writings and debates without truth, illusory born of emptiness. Guilt arises from not accepting advice, estrangement of kin and acquaintances, Daoist slander and evil-speaking, opposition to remonstrances. Remedy: use food and drink, soups, fish dishes, fruits, and vegetables, set at crossroads, no need to watch.

5. Encounters with thieves going in and out, public and private journeys, residence in mountains and villages, oppression by evil men, plundering and destruction. Guilt arises from lack of compassion, slight theft of all things, harming person and spirit, indulging desire for self. Remedy: use treasures, village bamboo, tiles, grass, earth, bricks; guard and protect homes, change laws and objects.

6. Failure to advance in learning and occupation, externally studying classics, histories, collections, books; internally studying true texts, prescriptions, and secret formulas; despising listening and seeking, seeing or not seeing; reading and reciting without understanding, wasting years. Guilt arises from unchastity, impurity of heart and body, discord with teachers and friends, jealousy of others’ talents, breaking the Yi Jing texts. Remedy: use ointments, oils, fuel, torches, candles; hand-copy scriptures and diagrams; encourage like-minded companions.

(These six cases correspond to the three grades, with 99,999 offenses to be practised.)

7. Decline in official career, being ruler, minister, or clerk, incompetent and dismissed, or virtuous yet unjustly demoted to remote places, destitute and exhausted. Guilt arises from lack of propriety, usurpation of position and false authority, arrogance to three courts, oppression across four wilds. Remedy: use broom and dustpan, secretly send them to other places, sweep roads morning and evening, without letting others know.

8. No offspring, many daughters; wives and concubines for years without children; if sons born they die; if daughters born they survive. Guilt arises from disobedience, rebellion against superiors, cutting off bloodline, illicit adultery. Remedy: use gold, silver, pearls, and jade, cast into flowing water; shrine without descendants, relatives, or sages; succession and morality cease.

9. Harm to fetus and loss of birth, wives and concubines miscarrying, or children dying within days or youth. Guilt arises from neglect and carelessness in intercourse, harming others’ pregnancies, abhorrence of prayers public and private. Remedy: use incense, oil, gold ruyi, mats and shrine seats, send to treatment dwellings.

10. Jealousy and envy between men and women, husbands and wives, rulers and concubines, intercourse without measure, idle suspicion and jealousy, disharmony inside and out. Guilt arises from unchastity, spouses communicating with others, vying for beauty for self, anger borne for others. Remedy: use five-coloured ink and five-coloured silk, dispense on roads regardless of wealth.

11. Oppression of nobles and commoners, emperors encountering thieves, ministers meeting robbers, Daoists facing misfortune, insult and injury on paths. Guilt arises from non-intervention, abandoning good and following evil, overturning men and women, defiling purity. Remedy: use incense burners, caskets, copper and iron utensils, secretly send to mountains and wilds, assist marriages, encourage fasting and gatherings.

12. Harm by water, fire, insects, birds, ghosts, and various disasters at dwelling, going out and in, mountains, waters, roads; those nurtured become disasters. Guilt arises from unrighteousness, physical harm, slaughter and cooking, harming rulers, teachers, and superiors, internal disorder and threats. Remedy: use caps, clothes, boxes, tables, knives and daggers; cast into mountains, waters, roads, and court.

(These six cases correspond to the three grades, with 33,333 offenses to be practised.)

13. Unintentional loss or misplacement of scriptures, treasures, money, rice, cloth, officials, servants, slaves. Guilt arises from negligence, sloth, self-indulgence, intolerance of others’ demands, theft for self-gain. Remedy: use lacquer, locks, keys; send to treatment dwellings.

14. Drunkenness and forgetfulness causing errors in reading, reciting, speech; spreading false tales. Guilt arises from carelessness, heedlessness as though permitted, reciting scriptures and precepts but neglecting correction of faults.

15. Living in remote places, humble lanes of China, border towns among barbarians, mountains and waters with dangerous passes. Guilt arises from ceaseless flattery, favouring own kin, harming others’ homes. Remedy: use knives, axes, saws, chisels, hammers, drills, nails, and rods; distribute on roads.

16. Receiving blessings yet suffering disasters, fasting and offerings, disputes and offences, encountering thieves and calamities, spirits and ghosts adding together. Guilt arises from misunderstanding, transgressing the Three Respects, falsely invoking gods and ghosts, divining dreams and casting lots without truth. Remedy: use gold dragons, jade fish, binding forms in bundles; cast into mountains and waters.

17. Doing good but causing evil, advising auspiciousness but it breeds suspicion, advice causes resentment, derision, anger, blame, hatred, and emptiness. Guilt arises from lack of wisdom, mistaking folly for cunning, slandering teachers and the Way, forcibly seeking name and fame. Remedy: use lit lamps, ten, hundred, thousand, ten thousand, with numbers of days; practise accordingly.

18. Endeavours turn to failure, establishments and enterprises, public and private plans, reasoning to success, yet destroyed by ghosts and spirits. Guilt arises from ignorance, movement and rest blocked, self-willed acts, ruining others’ achievements. Remedy: use slaves, carriages, horses, oxen, boats, lamps and lanterns; provide to treatment centres.

(These six cases correspond to the three grades, with 77,777 offenses to be practised.)

19. Having gained but again lost, what was sought publicly and privately, what was seen coming and going, clearly obtained, soon forgotten or lost. Guilt arises from unclearness, indiscriminate acceptance of all things, seduction into deceit and secrecy, bestowing benefits then blaming. Remedy: use clothing, worn items, and toys; give on the path, giving to all met regardless of possession.

20. Being envied by others, talented and virtuous, attaining position and wealth, surrounded by attachments and jealousy. Guilt arises from injustice, favouritism, arbitrary conduct, love of victory and interference with the masses, suppressing the worthy and wise. Remedy: use mats, beds, and tents; offer to those with the Way, whether known or unknown; give when meeting them.

21. Being suspected by others, advancing in Dao, virtue, fame, daily progress, sometimes hiding or revealing tracks, preserving self and guarding constancy, yet suspected and mistrusted. Guilt arises from disloyalty, deception, many betrayals of vows, misleading and ruining the good. Remedy: use cold bowls and plates, combs and bathing utensils; send to treatment centres.

22. Being possessed by ghosts, suddenly seeing ghosts arrive, men and women united, or hearing curses, foul speech, ugliness, without awareness. Guilt arises from disbelief, deception, falsehood, licentious worship, disorder of truth, frightening the common people. Remedy: use peachwood tally boards, trimmed and purified; offer mats and vermilion; send to treatment centres.

23. Being influenced by evil, ordinary becoming strange, sometimes due to sickness and suffering, seeing fears and anxieties, seeking truth for relief, having symptoms without harm, evil increasing daily. Guilt arises from improper conduct, mixing Dao with customs, men and women in confusion, bewildering heaven and man. Remedy: use scripture halls, beds, tents, tables, hats, kitchens, boxes; send to treatment centres.

24. Being tested and failing to transcend, teachers, friends, demons, kings, public and private mishaps, unexperienced, which should be abandoned; now all are good, but moving the mind and consciousness. Guilt arises from lack of concentration, learning diffusely, hoping for swift satisfaction, weariness, leaking treasured secrets. Remedy: devote the body, serve the teachers, next construct treatment centres, personally carry incense and lamps, sweep and clean with all effort, establish teaching for later generations.

(These six cases correspond to the three grades, with 33,333 offenses to be practised.)

All these cases of four, six, or twenty-four matters, among which three and eight are included, encompass myriad clauses, great and small doubts, right and wrong, confusion and reflection. Attached herewith are notes clarifying them distinctly. According to origin, fasting, contrition, resolution, and release are practised. What is offered and scattered, cleansed with utmost sincerity without regret or stinginess, great blessings will come. If not using gold and silk, then the heart and form must be moved in accord, calculating strength and effort, reckoning days precisely, able to offer without counting, all depending on the person. Those unable may have poverty or wealth, adjusted moderately, the key is to have no reluctance; reluctance is again the first fault, three faults without pardon.

The Eastern Sea Blue Child Lord told the Lords of the Directions and all Perfected Ones: "Your response and transformation of all living beings, if there is aspiration, should be encouraged and accomplished. Transmit this formula, secretly and gravely." Former generations have passed; if now not fully expounded, immediately amend today by this method. After fasting and contrition, minor calamities will be dispelled, major calamities not yet removed must be quickly escaped. Where to escape is to be determined by reference to the celestial charts, looking up and down with care and precision, not to be divulged. Moreover, as the celestial writings say, great calamities must be removed; after removing calamities, blessings are invited. This scripture is the essential method, treasured inside and out, esteemed by all the saints, its fame will endure eternally.

The Two Kings came to keep this secret; Wei Huacun received the command and practised with success; later it was transmitted independently and kept hidden. Few cultivate this text; few perfect the true being; the mysterious imperial register must be obtained.

Those above serve as national masters; in the middle as teachers among the people; those below learn to cultivate the person; the lowest become instructors of men—these are the three grades.

## The Supreme Cave-Truth Eightfold Destiny Registers, Lower Fascicle

The Supreme Great Way’s qi pervades the ten directions; human movement and stillness are but eightfold. The four sides and four corners belong in submission above and below; below and above govern and encompass the eight. The eight trigrams’ true spirits execute the eight qi; the Great One presides, the Three Primes circulate. Circulating in the human realm, there are paths among the intervals; paths connect good men; those with jade registers practise towards untroubled ease, emerging from the eight gates, guiding and reaching delight, fitting the ten directions.

The holy hosts of the ten directions all issue from the eight gates; the Eightfold Destiny Registers fully record all that the holy ones practise. Acting and transforming to aid goodness, sun yang and moon yin, yin virtue hidden and communicating, communicating the wondrous formula, secret to saints and perfected ones, fasting and prohibitions strictly enforced; those who cannot resolve guilt may not see or hear; those who see and hear but do not understand, who understand but do not practise, who practise without effect, only increase their faults.

If one has utmost sincerity, keen thought, and mysterious feeling, one will surely remove guilt, surely see this scripture, surely understand this matter, surely receive great blessings; adhering to cultivation will surely bear fruit, accomplishing true being.

The methods of contrition and fasting require solitary cultivation of the Dharma body; if comrades be present, two or three up to nine persons may gather, no more. When severing ties of goodness and fortune, occasionally there are wise and sagacious; beyond nine persons one should make separate fasts, do not forcibly join, lest one offend the Nine Heavens, seeking blessings but gaining calamities; all must be cautious.

When teachers and friends are ill and unable to fast for themselves, those fellow disciples may assist; if alone and with a companion, the utmost is nine persons. The Dharma Master instructs all, supervising fasting, attending on scriptures, incense, and lamps, holding the register according to the method.

The practice of the Eightfold Paths, four seasons, six affairs, eight solar terms, five elements, and twenty-four energies, faith, virtue, and earth merit, pervades inside and out; hence there is no longer fasting for four seasons.

Those fasting on behalf of others may not accept or view the master’s use of the four ritual objects. When contrition and fasting conclude, what is given from the four objects is silently executed, not letting others know. If asked, answer expediently. Occasionally giving alms or saying offerings are made above, the recipient suffering does not accept, do not forcibly force suspicion; give to others who will accept, no need to tell people whether they accept or not.

The methods of contrition and fasting universally use the Three Primes; the number of days varies: spring nine, summer three, autumn seven, winter five; day and night the paths proceed, six times three times in the morning; in the morning dry vegetables and fruits are given according to the person. Before reaching the number of days, sweep and clean inside and out, arrange ritual objects, examine and distinguish the pure and new, no sudden filling or exceeding limits. Separation and isolation must be strict, no noise or confusion.

The fasting body must not go outside; if going outside, do not return; if returning, lodge elsewhere; do not rashly violate, lest mistakes come to the fasting place. Outside messengers stay at the gate to deliver messages; the household translates; first wash and rinse throat, and rinse again; neglect not. Set up altars, halls, chambers, beds, tents, tables, incense utensils, offerings, mats, curtains, screens, and canopies; all must be pure, complete, and secret. Kitchens, tents, stoves, bathing rooms, and latrines all burn fragrant incense, avoiding foul vapours emitting to disturb people’s dwellings. Set separate privies; sitting, lying, and relieving must not intermingle; high and low must not confuse; all subject to calamity and examination; guard against disasters and seek blessings; be clearly cautious.

On the eve of fasting gatherings, sometimes one eats, sometimes not; broths and medicines vary; bathing must be the same. Even during long fasts, bathing is appropriate. Announcements and communications are determined; pure and strict entering the room, according to usual morning rites. At great repentance, one who leads chants the names and ranks; the Dharma Master knocks teeth thirty-six times, kneels long holding the text as follows:

### Invocation of the Supreme Daoist Masters of the Three Caverns

The Supreme Daoist Masters of the Three Caverns, Mr. Mou Yue, the Little Omen Perfected One, disciple of the Three Sceneries, devoted to practising the Great Cavern Scripture affairs; if not receiving the Three Caverns, directly call oneself disciple of the Supreme Mysterious Capital, Jade Capital, Purple Palace, Jade Chamber, disciple of the Three Sceneries; Great Cavern Master, Little Omen Perfected One, Mr. Mou Yue and his wife and lady; the lords, ministers, and servants’ names; above open to the Supreme Limitless Great Dao, the Three Primes Supreme True Old Sovereign, the Highest Immortal Capital, the Supreme Emperor Jade Emperor, the Nine Mysterious Dao Lords, the Limitless Heavenly Venerable, the Supreme Mysterious Natural Void Emperor, the Five Directions and Five Emperors, the Five Sacred Mountains Flying Immortals, the Jade Office and Golden Gate and all spirit officials; I, the humble, presumptuously approach the Supreme Way, sincerely rejoice and bear it, laden with fear and shame, yet unable to concentrate on the wondrous method, soon to ascend to immortality, pushing forth the path of the world, faults and calamities removed, sun and moon passing, life difficult to keep, always fearing suddenness, one direction with no return, self-startled and self-sorrowful, heart and bowels aching, looking up to the mysterious mercy, beseeching pity and aid. Now in the operation of driving away, fortunate to see the method of immortality, long forgotten the guilt and filth of the body, vow to admire the art of longevity, perusing the Eightfold Destiny Registers, the essential texts of the Eightfold Passages, looking up to the Three Pure Ones, observing ritual to the Eight Lords, practising contrition and fasting, untying knotty guilt, dispersing calamities before and after, able to obtain immortality, not acting as walking corpses, vowing and wishing to cultivate and practise. If others say: now there are teachers, friends, superiors, rulers, parents, children, men and women, all receiving this method; now I am ill, public and private impeded, unable to fast personally, therefore servants and attendants report and enter the mind as prescribed; servants and attendants are of like mind; daring to speak thus, respectfully read to hear. According to the regulations supply and arrange, secretly follow the essential words, wash the heart and carry words, carefully read to hear.

At such-and-such prefecture, county, township, village, men and women, officials, wine servers, Daoists, disciples of such a cavern, I, servant and attendant, name such and such, age so many years, households so many, now residing at such-and-such place, I prostrate and thank, beseeching grace with words: those presenting, fully list residence, rank, and names.

I, the lowly and humble, descendant of the earth, fortunate to register a good affinity, borne with wondrous grace, deeply profound without limit, but born and raised among the common world, habitually evil and changing time, moving and stillness becoming faults, day and night accumulating; though observing scriptures and precepts, unable to practise; coming and going in a world of disaster and poison, encountering the time of expulsion, hence fearing to be ground to powder, bowing head in terror and sorrow; sparrows and mice eager for life, dragonflies and reeds longing to live; not reckoning the residue of guilt and filth, daring to delight in ascent and advancement.

Worry and fear, screen and camp, fearing incomplete aid; or born often sick, poor and distressed, young and orphaned, old and alone; rare among heaven and men; such matters thus and so.

Because old offences are already deep, now faults are again heavy, thus bringing these evil calamities; ashamed and fearful, dare not complain.

Humbly seeking to examine the guilty self, accepting the proper affliction; how should one presume to offend; daring to report above, only looking to the mysterious mercy, generously containing dust and filth, good lending and good accomplishing, not leaving even the slightest part; carefully washing the heart and cleansing the body, first fasting and contrition, humbly begging to remake the grace, bestow the triple pardon, dispel disaster and sickness, resolve official matters, according to origin and announcements, extend the years of life, vow not to offend, display new self; the cultivation received, able to obtain the seed of the immortal Way, now petitioning this inscription, bearing the grace of accomplishment.

After conclusion, rise and proceed, reciting three wisdom chants; upon finishing, face north, heart offering to all directions, then proceed east to west, reciting seven reports and seven harms, reciting the great precept of watching the body. Those not yet familiar hold the text and read.

### The Seven Reports

The Perfected One says: Bearing yin and embracing yang, conditions differ; by abandoning death one gains life; the fruits of retribution vary; doing good brings good, doing evil brings evil; as a shadow follows form, not a hair’s breadth erring. Good and evil have many branches; blessings are hard to count; broadly speaking, marked by seven.

1. Former self performed kindness and bestowed virtue, saving all; current self’s conduct is no different; must receive the transformed hall of blessings, surpass the eight hardships, be celebrated by men, and receive Heaven’s natural reward.

2. Former self loved learning, aspiring to immortality, revered mysterious methods, honoured spiritual texts, remembered good and changed evil, established conduct and entered truth; current self’s conduct is no different; gains reception by the emperors, name inscribed on purple registers, ascending to the Jade Morning.

3. Former self delighted in the Way, did not fear hardship or cold, followed the master, engaging in labour first, striving when hungry and thirsty without complaint; current self’s conduct is no different; gains the riding of flying ploughs, wandering and feasting on the Five Sacred Mountains, riding the void and descending the smoke.

4. Former self was chaste, neither licentious nor adulterous, not greedy nor desirous, seeing beauty with no joy, heart like dead ashes, holding fast to the source of the Way; current self’s conduct is no different; gains reward by spiritual beings, transcending the three paths, not enduring the five sufferings.

5. Former self did good deeds, wishing Heaven to universally raise; together attained ascent and crossing, departing the eight hardships; many bodies passed, own self uneasy; cutting one’s own clothes to save the poor and cold; reducing provisions for crows; leaving goods in empty mountains; current self’s conduct is no different; the Four Officials proclaim good, moving the Jade Emperor thoroughly, recording names on purple registers, revering and supplementing the immortals above.

6. Former self was loyal and filial, respectfully serving parents, revering elders above self, observing ancestral rites, respecting teachers and lords, harmonizing eye and belly as if one body, heart without jealousy, mouth without harsh words, inward and outward united, moving and stopping in accord with truth; current self’s conduct is no different; gains reception by spiritual beings, does not pass through the three paths, surpasses the eight hardships; good begets good, blessings follow blessings; such reward, how could the Way fail men?

7. Born into an ill fate, harbouring evil and deceit, attacking and slandering the root of teachers, reviling sacred texts, not revering spiritual chapters, doubting the two truths, outwardly appearing fair, falsely seeking splendour and glory; mouth says yes but heart no; conduct betrays the source of the Way; stealing scriptures and divulging secrets, breaking agreements and transmitting, leaking treasured secrets, wandering falsely afar; current self’s conduct is no different; violating rules and taboos, body entering the source of guilt, seven ancestors suffering harshly, burdening poor souls; death body robbed, feeding fire, treading mountain knives; three paths and five sufferings, ten thousand kalpas without pardon; punished in dark night, painfully lamenting the body. Those wishing to cultivate and learn should thoroughly study this text, change evil to good, and quickly ascend to immortality.

### The Seven Harmful Conditions

The Perfected One says: Learning values the six harmonies, one must beware the seven harms.

1. Bearing truth but practising falsehood; lustful colours rob spirit; soul fluids leak; essence and light dry up; qi scatters and soul disperses; bones hollowed and body shakes; spirit weeps in the dark mansion; above the Heavenly Pass; true immortals depart afar; thus tied to mortal dust; earth mansion suffers the same fate; how could immortality be regained?

2. External form on the Way, skin seeming good and thinking truth, but heart harbouring hidden devils; inner wickedness complete; wishing others’ ruin; jealous and envious of ability and wisdom; mouth flattering but heart contrary; face smiling but inside angry; judging gain and loss; falsely creating causes of guilt; slandering fellow disciples; attacking the root of teachers; recorded by the Three Officials as evil gates; immortals depart high; evil demons attack the body; wandering as forms and shadows; flying and dispersing body and spirit; thus causing crookedness; the utmost evil source; examined until body is ashes; destroying one’s nine springs; scheming with mysterious names; how could naturalness be preserved?

3. Drinking wine to drunkenness; damaging qi and losing spirit; five organs attacked and broken; ten thousand gods alarmed; soul and spirit flying apart; inside and outside rotting and disintegrating; original chamber empty; infants wailing; true immortals depart high; evil demons enter body; such learning only damages sincerity; though having mysterious records, emptily losing the jade name; spirits ascend to high palaces; body ashes in darkness; vague extension of years; how can longevity be maintained?

4. Acting without reverence for things; blaming ancestors and craftsmen; anger in heart and mouth; cursing without constancy; anger and joy losing measure; temperament erring from norm; qi stirring and spirit scattering; inner truth flying; soul separating and spirit departing; nine apertures dusty; five organs mourning; all due to impurity of nature; conduct unlucky; true immortals depart high; external illnesses enter body; such learning, what can it cover; though having mysterious diagrams, cannot escape this calamity; yearning for immortality delayed; geography prolonged.

5. Sometimes from mysterious diagrams appearing; receiving precious scriptures; sometimes encountering spiritual masters; being taught divine texts; yet not following regulations and oaths; form leaks heavenly truth; not passing nine years; casting lots on famous mountains; recorded in the Azure Palace; compiled in the Golden Gate; quickly transmitted to others; spreading in the world; lightly revealing truth and treasures; examining and binding oneself; only having mysterious names; instead accumulating the seven mysteries; immortality departs high; body dies in dark springs; long charged with ghostly blame; ten thousand kalpas without pardon.

6. Body splattered with essence; spirit gate losing light; five gods flying apart; infants soaring; evil demons attack; inside and outside mourning loss; such learning hopes for success but harms self; true immortals depart high; empty shadows walk alone; sinking into confusion; how can immortals be deceived?

7. Eating the flesh of six domestic animals, killing creatures with limbs and mouths; foul qi filling the storage chambers; destroying life and punishing the unselfish; true qi disturbed at the spiritual gate; roaming spirits frightening infants; souls wandering palaces; turbid stagnation entwined in teeth and mouth; immortals ascend to Jade Clarity; self sinks into the earth; only having mysterious imperial registers; yet not escaping certain death.

The High Sage Emperor Lord says: The foundation of learning must urgently avoid the seven harms. Upon seeing the cave gate, perusing the jade chapters, not violating the prohibitions of the seven harms, one will await spiritual descent and ascend to daylight immortality. If externally diligent in study but internally not avoiding the seven harms, this will lead to hoped success but failure, wished life but death, seeking flight but sinking; spiritual immortals wandering in high clarity, five gods scattering in the eight wildernesses, infants crying in the middle chamber, wandering souls lamenting in the mysterious void.

Hence immortal appearances have success and failure; higher learning has seven harms; those earnest and devoted refine their truth. Those with spiritual ardour see the diagrams, jade embryo, purple void, name inscribed East Flower; seeing the examination of the seven harms. Without this ardour, the spiritual chapters may not be rashly revealed; treasured texts may not be lightly read.

Those who see this text, whose mystery blends with immortality, after nine years of cultivation can achieve flight in the mysterious void, ascending to Jade Clarity. Reciting the precepts from the fifth onwards to the last then back to the first, taking the first around to the fourth, need not read the preface or postscript. Many texts are not heavily recorded; at times read separate fascicles. Upon finishing recitation, rise to the front lamp, knock teeth thirty-six times, secretly recite the lamp hymn three times:

---

### The Lamp Hymns

The Supreme scatters the ten directions; glorious lamps communicate sincere essence. All heavens glow brightly; all lands are clear. My body also shines through; the five viscera generate splendour. The blazing sun illuminates the Supreme Nothingness; remote reveries abound in Jade Clarity.

The cinnabar essence lodges in the Great Origin; mysterious intestines echo in the void. Containing form extinguishes the root of suffering; subtle and profound ultimate thoughts. Hanging splendour unrealized; by causes and conditions showing light and image. My body is likewise thus; riding transformation entrusted to flowing light.

The night light manifests the yang cinnabar; faintly shining in the spiritual chamber. All lamps shine universally; all shadows immediately vanish. My spirit is also intelligent and bright; always delighting in wisdom and insight. Untroubled, fitting the Way’s movement; changing and declining, obeying Heaven’s force. Raising the form, treading the empty cave; night candle illuminating flowing splendour.

Upon finishing the incantation, turn west to east, again kindle the furnace, recite incantations and rinse, then return to the room; movement and stillness all as morning rites. At dawn, at the hour of the ox, rise together purified and solemn; at the hour of the tiger ascend the platform to the doorway, rinse and recite incantations, preserving the master, as in morning rites.

Those who do not follow the world’s master, reporting the mysterious alliance, preserving the mysterious master, the Blue Child Lord at the Directions and Officers, beseech bestowal of descent and manifestation, the formula of longevity, swift attainment of immortality, endless proclamation and transformation.

Upon preserving the master, again knock teeth thirty-six times, incantation:

---

### Invocation of the Great Demon King of the Northern Emperor

Northern Emperor Great Demon King, serving before the Emperor Lord, ghosts of springs and bends, four bright Feng Mountains, a thousand demons of mixed forms, nine heads and one body, divine tiger releasing poison, severing and destroying thunder’s shock, the true voice divine lord, uttering incantations to slay, no kin at Supreme Microcosm; having command to record, mountains and rivers ringing bells, casting and pouring flowing light, nine heavens’ wind and fire, campaigning the divine blade, ten layers of cruel trials, subduing and destroying myriad spirits, daring demons and poisons arise, sealed behind three gates; beseech to follow cave methods, all as commanded.

Upon finishing, again knock teeth thirty-six times, kindle the furnace, separate knock teeth.

After kindling the furnace, kneel long facing north, may sit briefly small; knock teeth thirty-six times; issue official summons:

This is the most sublime and wondrous method, the root of seeking immortality. I, the servants, love the Dao and delight in truth, willing to cultivate practice. Some recite scriptures and precepts, some combine cinnabar essence; those not yet combined say: wishing to prepare medicines, immortal essential methods, harmonize divine elixirs or forbidden pills, powders, wine and bait.
