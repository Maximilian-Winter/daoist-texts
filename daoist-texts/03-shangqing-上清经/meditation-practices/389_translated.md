It is a compilation and excerpt from the Scriptures and Instructions of the Supreme Clarity School of cultivation, including the Great Cavern True Scripture, the True Instruction, the Secrets of Ascending the True, and others. One scroll. The original source: The Daoist Canon of the Orthodox Tradition, Zhengyi Section.

The Scripture of the Jade Forest of the Immortal Abode of Supreme Clarity

The Scripture states: Heaven has a Mysterious One, born from the Great Sun, named Flowing Pearl, the gate of all mysteries; if attained and preserved, one may obtain longevity. Man has the Three Ones; their abidings differ. If all are guarded, one may become an Immortal King. One dwells in the Northern Pole Great Abyss; before it is the Bright Hall, below it the Crimson Palace, above it the Floral Canopy, and the Jade Tower of ten thousand layers.

Again it is said by the Perfected of Purple Yang: In former days I studied the Way, and received the True Names of the Three Ones from the Perfected of the Central Mountain, Su Zixuan. Zixuan taught me the method of guarding the One, in all more than two hundred matters, which I have reverently followed. Thus I became a Perfected of Supreme Clarity, whose Way is most true.

Again it says: The twenty-four energies correspond to the twenty-four truths of the Supreme Subtle; there are thousands of chariots and ten thousand riders, feathered canopies and cloud chariots, to unite with the Purple Palace and the Supreme Clarity Original Diagram. If guarded firmly and continuously, the essence responds swiftly and harmoniously; then the Three Ones may be seen, and when the Three Ones are seen, the thousands of chariots and ten thousand riders appear; the feathered canopy can be borne, the cloud chariot ridden; ascend above the Supreme Subtle, blend with the twenty-four energies, perceive the twenty-four truths, fly through Supreme Clarity, arrayed in the Original Diagram. This is the ascent to Heaven by daylight, also practicing the Way of the Inner Chamber.

Again it says: The Supreme One is the utmost of the Highest Truth, the Central One is the ultimate of the Middle Truth, the Lower One is the subtlety of the Lowest Truth. The Heavenly Emperor attains the utmost and so becomes the Emperor of the Supreme Pole; the Earthly Emperor attains the ultimate and so becomes the Perfect Unity; the Human Emperor attains the subtlety and so becomes the Lord of all Mysteries. The Three Emperors embody the True to guard the One; therefore the One hides no form; Immortals seek the True to find the One; thus the Three Ones are all luminous. The One hides no form, that is its utmost truth; the Three Ones are all luminous, by attaining the One and no more.

The Record of the Primordial Birth and Transformation of the Supreme True says: The Supreme Emperor opens the Truth, the Nine Ways unite in brightness, transforming and refining the primordial void, illumining Supreme Clarity; dividing forms and transforming images; the four movements proceed harmoniously; the eight images support the wings; movement brings the cinnabar carriage; mounting clouds and driving smoke, steering and governing Supreme Clarity, flying through the cloud chamber, paying homage at the Imperial Capital. It also says: Whoever cultivates the Way of the Nine Heavens True Kings customarily on the day of the winter solstice bathes and enters a chamber, facing west and performing nine bows, paying homage to the Nine Heavens True Kings, and naturally obtains to ride the nine-coloured cloud chariot, flying through Supreme Clarity. Further it says: The Nine Heavens Supreme Spirit, the Primordial Nature, and so forth. The Middle Treasure Purple Origin, the Three Simples encircled outside, and so forth. Penetrating transformation into the subtle, my Way early divides; eyes summon the spiritual radiance, heart unfolds five clouds, riding the rod and eight images, flying into the Imperial Morning. Further it says: Containing the True Nurtured Vitality, form elegant in the Purple Heaven, riding clouds and driving floating smoke, bathing in the images of the eight smokes, and so forth. Obtaining to ride the firmament carriage, flying and ascending the Jade Morning. Further it says: The Palace of the Seven Reflections of the Jade Forest. Again it says: Within it contains the Immortal Spirit, without refining the True Countenance, the Jade Pool and Floral Dew, marshes flowing into the Purple Chamber. Again it says: The Supreme Jade Morning, returning images to the void and brightness, dividing forms and transforming unities, refining nine times the Three Truths.

Again it says: The Prayer of the Morning Radiance of the Three Primal Lords of the Supreme Primordial Great Simplicity: The Three Simples return to the Primordial Origin, clearing the sky and supporting the Jade Spirit, and so forth. Though the great rosy clouds are vast and remote, the cavernous reflection and mirror have feeling; together they bear the jade tally, synchronizing with the nine heavenly carriages. Again it says: The Great Simplicity steers and moves, the four images fly in the void. Again it says: The Emperor of Supreme Clarity sends forth morning radiance, spiritual energy wings the void and transfers, drifting aloft the nine origins, softly entering the Imperial Morning. Again it says: The Four Elders of the Middle Truth scatter flowers in the cloud chamber. Again it says: The Mysterious Morning bears the High Spirit, the Perfected governs the Eight Clarities, jade flowers unfold in the cinnabar chamber, the Purple Phoenix shines upon the cloud encampment. Again it says: I ride the auspicious sun, reporting to the Imperial Spirit, seeking to ascend and fly as an Immortal, obtaining to govern the flowing carriage. Again it says: Purple Emperor of the Primordial Beginning, the Way unites the Mysterious Void, three transformations and nine divisions, blending and transforming the Great Beginning, flying clouds and flowing assistance, azure canopies and green chariots. Again it says: The sky is clear and bright at night, the secluded void opens the Truth, flowing clouds wander, golden flowers fourfold, the Cinnabar Emperor spreads radiance, clouds fly the Purple Pavilion.

The Supreme Jade Scripture and Precious Instructions say: Ascending to Jade Clarity, inviting the serene and remote beyond the nine quarters. Again it says: The Spirit Wind fans the floral fragrance, splendid and opening in abundance; the Supreme True caresses the cloud drum; many Immortals play the spiritual zither, elegant songs of the three heavenly images, scattering blessings through the jade floral forest. Again it says: To study the Way is by cinnabar faith, to serve the Master as the closest kin, drawing in images occasionally pure and void; diligently renewing daily; raising body to ascend Supreme Clarity, transcending images to roam the Nine Heavens; preserving the origin and holding the essential law; roaming the mystery to attain untroubled ease; ten thousand kalpas like last night, a thousand years like morning; the spirit banner disperses with the wind; multitudinous thoughts respond and vanish in due time.

The Great Cavern True Scripture says: The supreme banquet surpasses the nine mysteries, the cavernous images entrust divine powers; the Jade Emperor rides the vermilion firmament, green clouds shining upon the golden walls; the upper pavilion within the cloud pearl, looking upward to the primordial blade peak. Again it says: The Flowing Pearl halts the radiance, purple clouds leap in smoke, sevenfold return paths, three lights illumine the True.

The Supreme Simplicity Spirit Cavern Great Abundance Scripture says: Dwelling in the Spirit Cavern, feasting on the seven mornings' images, clearing and sprinkling the floral garden, resting in the nine mysteries, transforming images into jade void, leading the various heavens. Again it says: The Supreme True Yin Spirit, called the Female Spirit, transforms images in the nine mysteries, rides the True Hidden Darkness, guiding the flying clouds, ascending to the Imperial Court.

Again the Scripture says: The Nine Mysteries and Nine Heavens are said to be above the Three Realms. Again it says: Roaming the Nine Mystery Platform, resting by the Western Feather River. Again it says: The eight images move the heavenly chariot.

The Great Cavern True Scripture says: Crimson clouds arrest the bright radiance, eight images fly in the vast empty space. Again it says: The Eight Vows Mysterious Mother journeys with me between the Three Mysteries, then unbuckles reins in the Great Desert, turns the carriage among the Three Mysteries; Five Spirits support the back, the Queen Mother beside, dancing wheels upon the divine hill, stopping the chariot in the Nine Heavens.

The Inner Chamber Scripture says: Infinite Supreme True, morning in the vermilion court, dragon robes and tiger belts, reading the Great Cavern True Scripture, wandering the Nine Heavens, gathering in the seven voids. Riding the void flow carriage, bridled in the great firmament's round chariot. Again it says: We mix among the five energies, jointly transforming to ride the sun chariot, feasting and viewing beyond the cloud firmament, breathing in the seven spiritual essences, circling the nine mysteries within the cypress, sitting and rising amid the clouds. The text is from the Scripture of the Five Elders' Female One.

The Scripture of the Three Primal True Ones says: Left rouses the cloud wheel, right drives the flying dragon; looking upward commands the twenty-four spirits, thousands of chariots and ten thousand riders, calling the Yang and summoning the Yin, ascending in the daylight to Heaven.

The Tortoise Mountain Original Record says: In the morning soaring at the Sun Temple, at evening resting hidden in the Lang Wind. Again it says: Many Immortals sport among cloud images, cinnabar blossoms spread spring sunlight; the imperial carriage halts the cloud companions, drifting and soaring freely; gazing beyond the eight extremities, who comprehends the length of their motion? Again it says: The Three Primal Lords each follow the forms and images of the four seasons; then return the original energies, receiving refinement and restoring form.

The Great Cavern True Scripture says: Northern Ridge thick with mist, crimson trees bear purple flowers, green herbs fall in the Phoenix Grove, jade cliffs adorn the mountain recess, the Spirit Gate towers in the vast sky, jade chambers join the great rosy clouds, and so forth. The dragon blows entwined five clouds, and so forth. The cinnabar clouds cover the morning firmament.

The Jade Pendant and Golden Dangling Scripture says: The golden dangling above the Nine Heavens is called Rainbow Reflection, also the Pavilion of Supreme Clarity, in the midst of the Great Firmament, condensing white smoky energy, spiritually reflecting the Nine Heavens, and so forth. Its colour like white clouds, its form like jade mountains, having the palace of the Jade Forest. Again it says: The Nine Heavens Emperor Lords reside within the Sun Gate Golden Court. Again it says: The jade pendant contains the souls and essences of the Nine Heavens; above the Nine Heavens it is called the Morning Lamp, and so forth. Condensing the blue Yang energy, spiritually reflecting the Nine Heavens, and so forth. Its colour like blue jade, its form like the full moon; within is the void and mystery, the jade platform and purple palace. Again it says: The sun's splendour and moon's essence, sun's radiance and moon's reflection; left holds the jade pendant, right grasps the golden dangling; the two images entwine, the twin souls are peaceful; ascending the Great Ultimate above, descending to the ten directions below.

The Purple Scripture and Golden Root Scripture says: The Emperor of Blue Essentials is the disciple of the Nine Yang Primordial Emperor Jade Emperor, nurtured in the Mysterious Mound Jade Kingdom Primordial Cliff in Heaven, beneath the seven treasures of the Jade Forest, sheltered by the seven-coloured jade phoenix. Again it says: Dwelling heart in the realm of radiant clouds, teaching flow in the ruins of the Jade Kingdom; holding the strategy of the Nine Emperors, descending upon the hills of the nine regions, and so forth. Using purple clouds for a roof, blue rosy clouds for a city; gold for the hall, white jade for the bed.

The Scripture of Guarding the Mysterious Elixir says: Between the two eyebrows, entering upwards one division is the measure of guarding the double fields; entering one inch is the Bright Hall Palace; entering two inches is the Inner Chamber Palace; entering three inches is the Elixir Field Palace; entering four inches is the Flowing Pearl Palace; entering five inches is the Jade Emperor Palace. One inch above the Bright Hall is the Heavenly Court Palace; one inch above the Inner Chamber is the Ultimate True Palace; one inch above the Elixir Field is the Mysterious Elixir Palace; one inch above the Flowing Pearl Palace is the Supreme Emperor Palace. Thus there are nine palaces within one head. The Scriptures of the Bright Hall, Inner Chamber, Elixir Field, and Flowing Pearl Palaces are all the Way of the Perfected Immortals transmitted to the world. The Mysterious Elixir Scripture is also the essential words of the True Officials of Fate, the heads of the four palaces. This Scripture must be given only by the Supreme Emperor. Again it says: The Jade Emperor Palace is inhabited by the Jade Clarity Spirit Mother; the Heavenly Court Palace by the Supreme Clarity True Female; the Ultimate True Palace by the Great Ultimate Emperor Consort; the Supreme Emperor Palace by the Supreme Sovereign Lady. These four palaces are all Female True One: the Way excels the Male True One. Together with Precious Scriptures, they are transmitted only to those already Perfected; those not yet Perfected do not receive them; the essentials of the Female True One are not taught to them. The Supreme thus sends forth the banquet of the eight images, entering the jade pavilion; three thousand jade maidens attend the True and support the pavilion; the Spirit Consort sings in chivalry; the Divine Empress holds the handkerchief: all indeed by means of guarding the Female One, used to gather the Mysterious Morning. This is the root and origin of the Supreme, transmitted by the Void Emperor. Again it says: The Way of guarding the Mysterious Elixir of the Supreme True One, at dusk and in quiet sleep, letting go of all thoughts, sitting or lying as one pleases, first preserving the Purple Qi of the Northern Polar star descending into oneself and into the Mysterious Elixir, and so forth. Again it preserves the sun entering the Mysterious Elixir Palace; the sun fills the palace within, amidst the Purple Qi’s centre; gazing as if looking in the dark at a fiery pearl. Then it preserves the Supreme True One of Yellow Great Unity in Supreme Clarity, coming from the Northern Polar Purple Qi, descending into the Mysterious Elixir Palace, seated in the sun's centre; the lord’s name is Guiying, styled Huaxuan. Again it preserves the self suddenly ascending into the Mysterious Elixir Palace sun’s centre, sitting opposite the Supreme True One, and so forth. Then the Supreme True One together with oneself rides the sun to enter and proceed the path of Scarlet Qi, and so forth. There is indeed a True Response, and so forth. Thus together with the Supreme True One arriving at the seven primal principles, entering the Supreme Clarity Palace. Again it says: The Supreme Dragon Scripture says, sitting upright in the Mysterious Elixir, neither inclined nor twisted, these are essentials of the Way. One must preserve the Supreme True Purple Qi to surround the body and swallow it, and always preserve the Supreme True One in the Purple Qi of the Mysterious Elixir Palace; longevity without limit, ten thousand evils do not affect; thus is the Way of the Mysterious Elixir completed.

The Scripture of the Daoist Mechanism says: Man regards the body as his realm, the spirit as his lord, the essence as his minister, the breath as his people; the breath changes into essence, essence transforms into spirit, spirit transforms into the infant.

The Inner Transmission of the Origins of the Immortals says: On the days of the eight festivals, the great saints and honored spirits of the heavens, the Perfected of Marvelous Conduct, all gather at the Spirit Treasure Mysterious Capital Jade Mountain Palace, to pay homage and celebrate the True.

The Cavern Spirit Section says: The Palace of the Controlling Radiance and Great Rosy Clouds, aligned with the nine heavenly courts.

The Tortoise Mountain Original Record says: The Perfected dwells in the golden hall and jade chamber, amidst the seven treasure floral groves, above the clear water floral pool, and so forth. Flying the True Step in the void, roaming and feasting in jade chambers, golden terraces shining with precious light, the eight rare delicacies; ascending the immortal cavern space, within Tortoise Mountain, taking morning meals of jade fungus, evening rinsing from jade springs; all come thither, the twelve mysterious dragons, purple phoenixes and spirit dragons, divine birds and cinnabar carriages, feathered canopies and true riders, the various gods on cinnabar, the lords following spirits, come descend to me.

The Scripture of the Natural Jade Characters says: Beyond the Southern Cross above the Mysterious Capital lies the mountain of the Void Peak, the place where myriad saints wander; the Way accomplished, they ascend directly to the summit of Void Peak, receive titles, and soar into the void. Again it says: Above the Emperor Egg is the mountain of Golden Splendour; the mountain has the palace of the Five Emperors; it ever produces clouds of five colours, the sun and moon guard on left and right, flying Immortals wing the pavilion.

The Spirit Treasure Scripture says: The Supreme Dao Lord at the Western Na mountain of Yucha, the floating Luo peak, sits beneath the seven treasure tall forest, and so forth. The Dao Lord plays the dragon cloud drum, the firmament's sound drifts afar, flowing and rousing a thousand fathoms, the heavens flourish, purple canopies encircle the mystery, celebratory firmaments gather, eight ways shine brightly.

The Supreme Precious Instructions say: The faint and mysterious ancestral gate, shining and clear through the void, the supreme Way proceeds by silence and stillness; one must see the Three Simples Palace. Again the Tao Te Ching says: To look at it is not to see it clearly; to listen is not to hear it distinctly; to grasp it is not to obtain it subtly; this is the title of the Three Primal Old Ones. It is further said these three cannot be fully questioned; thus they blend into one; the Three Simples unite as the Primordial One Lord, the original father and mysterious mother of the Three Honoured Ones. Reading this Scripture, the two Elder Lords behold it; the Immortal Way is formed; the Way is completed in this. Again it says: The great simplicity is originally without substance; the sages call it mystery; dual meanings from beginning to end; all things proceed to the abyssal spring. Again it says: On Kunlun Mountain many Immortals compose Middle Xia, chanting the Nine Heavens, desolate yet far and clear; pure sounds ring clear; hearers surpass the firmament, causing men to forget their passions. At times the gathered Immortals sing cavernous chants of mystery, in harmony and chorus, new voices striking and resonant, distant and faintly heard, and so forth. This is what the Highest Truth holds dear.

Again, the Inscription of the High Terrace says: If you desire to ride the void and ascend the void, recite my Step of the Mysterious Feather Scripture. The Immortals do not understand these words. The Step of the Mysterious Feather Scripture, these two books, the Supreme Mysterious Scriptures, are not transmitted to the Middle Immortal.

The Purple Scripture and Golden Root Scripture says: Commanding fate over the Nine Heavens, summoning the spirits of the Five Emperors, drifting and returning the blended winds, condensing the nine revolutions in the mysterious essence. Again it says: The Supreme Sovereign Lady’s head bears the nine mysterious jade essence cloud bun, dwelling above Supreme Clarity in the Nine Mysteries. It is a platform’s name, also in the Nine Heavens Cavernous Origin Ultimate Truth Palace.

The Great Cavern True Scripture says: Fluttering and drifting over the three rosy peaks, wandering the guidelines of the seven primaries; the eight images enter the Great Void, flying and scattering beyond the Nine Heavens. The jade door produces image clouds, spirit smoke ends the secluded haze; the Western Palace chants the cavernous mystery, clear songs support the Fusang boundary. Again it says: The seven palaces shine flowing rosy clouds, the jade chamber breeds dragon clouds, left reins the Three Simples chariot, right strokes the eight images wheel. Again it says: Left holds the jade floral canopy, flying images ascend the seven primaries.

The Supreme Flying Jade Scripture says: Ascending the Heavenly Mansions, flying through the nine stars, left holds the hidden book, right grasps the feather scripture; paying homage to the Imperial Lord, receiving the Lord’s name, attaining to transcend the floral canopy, soaring in the Purple Court. Again it says: Driving images and purple smoke, flying and stepping the nine primaries. Again it says: The Five Empresses, internal and hidden in name; the Supreme hides them in the Mysterious Dipper Purple Canopy Palace; these five ladies all revolve the heavens and turn the earth, expanding and contracting the three lights, transforming mountains and rivers, altering the five elements, moving myriad things, concealing the hidden darkness; those who know their Way no longer pass through earthly gates, their souls pass over Mount Tai. Again it says: Dao energy lacks radiance, vast and boundless, primordial form of chaos, void and natural; Supreme has no root, silent and mysterious in communication. Again it says: At the juncture of the Great Cataclysm of Heaven and Earth, the most true honored spirits of the heavens and the Perfected of Marvelous Conduct descend to the Five Mountains, directly observe the top disciples of all under Heaven; a mighty current fills the sky, all greeted by Five Dragons, ascending to the blessed land, attaining to roam with the Primordial Together.

The Spirit Treasure Scripture says: The Perfected of Marvelous Conduct, countless in number, gather at one time; the land is all irrigated with molten gold; four-sided stairways are adorned with jade and lapis lazuli treasures, encircling evenly and brightly. Again it says: Primordial Heavenly Lord at the blue sky sings in the great floating Li kingdom, sitting above the blue clouds; the land is all jade, four-sided stairways all adorned with gold, silver, and treasures in all manners of marvels. Again it says: The Chan Li world of the Red Bright Kingdom, the Southern Garden of Dan Huo’s recess, the Three Primal Caverns, the Heavenly Lord sits above the crimson clouds; the most true great gods and great cinnabar jade maidens gather at once in Dan Huo’s recess; this land always produces red breath, like scarlet clouds.

The method of guarding the One involves always taking little food and drink, avoiding pork and fish with strong smell; all diet should follow the season's temperature, neither against the time. The method of guarding the One carefully forbids drinking turbid wine; turbid wine harms the essence of the five organs and life breath; essence and breath do not flow, the blood and vessels do not circulate.

The Scripture of the Supreme Emperor Master Purple Lord says: The Divine Land lies north of the Heavenly Pass; the sun and moon revolve in their courses; to its south are the seven stars, revolving within.

The Supreme Clarity Scripture says: Meditate on the Three Primal Ones in the Mud Ball, guard the Nine Truths in the form's dwelling; exhale and inhale the five splendours, breathe the jade liquid; morning and evening seek Immortality in the void cavern; sleeping and waking sense the spirit in the Great Desert. Again it says: Those who serve ascend the Three Mornings, roaming the Great Firmament. Again it says: The Great Cavern Scripture is the wondrous secret of the Nine Heavens, the chief scripture of the Supreme Primordial Lord's golden writings. Formerly the Central Yellow Elder Lord concealed this book; at that time the Primordial knew it; only the Supreme Mysterious possessed golden towers, jade titles, jade slips and purple tablets. To read this chapter a myriad times is to ascend by daylight to Heaven, ascend Supreme Clarity, receive the Great Ultimate, and be installed as a High Supreme Minister. But those who have this book yet do not read it, the Supreme Emperor of the Supreme Subtle plucks out death slips, edits the true register, measures the Great Ultimate, carves names East Flower, reports to the Supreme, records and seals the Tortoise Platform; myriad spirits and thousand gods all claim titles as Nine Mystery Grand Masters, their ranks equal the Supreme Clarity Immortal Elders.

The Great Cinnabar Hidden Mysterious Five Mornings Golden Splendour Jade Scripture says: The Mysterious Mother’s Eight Gates Chapter says: May the Mysterious Mother be born with me amid the vital breath of life, be preserved with me between sun and moon, be protected with me within the Nine Heavens, be preserved with me in nature, drink with me from the Gourd River, rest with me at the Jade True, sleep with me in the Immortal Hall, roam with me among the Three Mysteries. Again it says: The Nine Heavens Emperor Lords’ twelve supreme vows, the Nine Spirits Mysterious Mother’s eight gate spirits, the great return of the origin and five communications, quiet in the secret chamber, scattering incense and stove smoke, whilst reading the Great Cavern Golden Splendour Scripture.

The Ancient Inner Chamber Scripture says: Kunlun is high but does not incline, the place where Immortals dwell; golden halls and jade cities; the nine breaths separate and unite; clouds and rain are obscure and dark; the yellow gate and purple door, most mysterious essence; above strikes the utmost rosy clouds, below shines the nine spirits; on the left connects the Blue Palace, on the right guards the White Clarity; golden terraces and eight simples; roaming and transforming myriad forms; jade nectar and clear liquid; jade essence naturally produced; the six directions’ hidden gates, the eight pavilions meet the scripture; within is the Supreme True, most unnameable; subtle and without centre, called the Unmanifest.

Again it says: Formerly Chang An’s Li Zhong, knowing not other ways, nor also the practice of Supreme Elixir, the method of the Three Primal Ones. Only a corner obtained this hidden morning Way, guarded and practiced thirty years, obtained riding clouds and driving swiftly, ascending into the Mysterious Continent. The Immortal Kings Wang Lu Bing, Zhao Shuang Cheng, Fan Shu You, Guan Ping He, Li Ming Xian, An Sheng and others all obtained this Way, ascending to the Kunlun chambers, or dwelling in the Three Mystery Palaces of the Mysterious Continent.

Again it says: The Supreme Primordial Three Primal Lords are True One females, wearing purple breath floating cloud brocade capes, nine-coloured dragon brocade feather skirts, wearing the precious jade-supporting morning feather crowns, waists adorned with golden fire bells, tiger tally and dragon writings, sitting in the void; beneath their knees always are cinnabar, green, and blue clouds of the Three Simples, luxuriantly crowning their forms. Also the Supreme Primordial Three Primal Lords always chant: The Great Origin connects Jade Clarity, the Three Caverns shine brightly; the eight images revolve the morning wind, scattering clouds thickly flying spirits; the round wheel casts the void cavern, gold reflects the crown’s essence; jade blossoms bind the Five Elders, purple smoke illumines the morning carriage, riding qi to stir the mysterious chamber, golden form shining the nine rosy clouds. This is the chant of the jade clarity upper palace.

The Jade Morning Bright Mirror Scripture says: The White Simple Right Primal Lord is the mother of the White Origin Cavern Yang Lord, the child of the Supreme Primordial Three Lords; named Qiming Xiao Ren, styled Golden Gate Above; from the mouth constantly breathes white qi, called the Jade Morning White Precious Born Soul Qi, with which I fumigate my body, making man Immortal and undying.

The Yellow Simple Central Primal Lord is the mother of the Central Yellow Elder Lord, the child of the Supreme Primordial Three Lords; named Yuanhua Huang Ren, styled Great Zhang Above; titled the Sun Yellow Simple High Primal Lord; having the substance of gold, breathing yellow qi from the mouth; called Jade Morning Yellow Precious Great Spirit, born of the five viscera's qi, fumigating my body, making man a flying Immortal ascending to Heaven.

The Purple Simple Left Primal Lord is the mother of the Elemental Lord, the child of the Supreme Primordial Three Lords; named Yi Chuan Wu Ren, styled An Lai Above; a spirit mirror to the eight directions, yet appearing as a young infant; breathing purple qi from the mouth, called Jade Morning Purple Precious Life Embryo Flowing Cloud Image Smoke, fumigating my body, making man ascend by daylight to the jade clarity upper palace. This is an excerpt; the full text is in the Scripture.

Again it says: The Three Simple Primal Lords each have a precious shining jewel on their necks, the sun’s qi in nine colours, a round light brightly illuminating within a chamber of cinnabar clouds; the three simple primal lords each breathe qi as per the above method; the three qi combine, entwine, and transform into one sun image nine inches in size within the cinnabar chamber.

Again it says: The Supreme Jade Morning, guiding the nine subtle smokes, the Five Elders scatter images, the eight spirits give birth to gates, the Three Simples’ precious qi, the Great Mystery Jade Morning, golden splendour female one, within it the Purple Origin, mixing and transforming the seven nines, ascending and drawing clouds, three ups and three qi, entering the void and emerging as cinnabar, always with the Purple Simple, all listed among the jade Immortals.

The Great Cavern Female One Great Ultimate Five Elder Emperor Lord Scripture says: The Golden Splendour True of the Great Ultimate engraved this Scripture on the eastern window wall of the Mysterious Jade Palace of the Purple Subtle Palace of the Heavenly Emperor; its text says: The five qi differ in direction, the river of light combines forms; some have an end and die, some have a beginning and are born; myriad beings return to their origins; a thousand veins return to darkness; qi ascends as floating smoke; blood flows clearly; alas the destined body. Afterwards one administers the elixir of cinnabar and ingests the pills.

Again the Mountain Lord of the South says: I formerly had an inner disciple Immortal named Zhao Chengzi, who first received from me the Scripture of the Preservation of the Five Viscera; he copied it for himself. Afterwards Chengzi sought to return to the Great Yin, seeking to change his form, but died at the Stone Chamber below the Mysterious Hill of Upper Valley in Youzhou. Five years after death, a mountain traveller saw white bones in the chamber, exposed in the dark room; also saw the five viscera in the belly, naturally unrotting as before, five-coloured blossoms shining within. The mountain traveller sighed: "I formerly heard the five viscera may be nourished to become immortal and uncorrupted; the white bones blossoming in the chest I now witness; this man may have the Way but will not complete it, will fail the test midway." Taking the bones, he found in each of the five viscera a white stone, preserving the five colours of blossoms, as if their forms were there. The man said: "If your five viscera do not rot, it must be by these five stones giving birth to the blossoms; you have attained the Way and may commune with me." He took and swallowed them. After four or five years, when Chengzi’s corpse was to be revived, the man first took the stones; at Chengzi’s dawning revival, the five stones flew out from his mouth like cicadas, with faint thunder, the five colours illuminating the sun directly returning to the viscera of the dead body. Thus Chengzi changed form and arose, as if awakening from a night’s drunken sleep. The man’s heart was fearful and confused; his illness worsened daily until he entered the mountains to seek the corpse’s place; at the stone chamber he saw Chengzi lying and howling in the cavern, his face shining with jade light; he asked: "Who are you?" Suddenly five elder Immortal Lords appeared, wearing brocade belts and talismans, holding feathered rods, wearing purple crowns; they said to Chengzi: "The man who stole and swallowed the Master’s five viscera treasured stones was this man." When they finished speaking, the man’s face broke out in evil scabs, was mute and lost speech; on returning home, scabs covered the whole family; adults and children died together, and the family was extinguished.

Again, those who always take the sun and moon’s essence desire to always eat bamboo shoots; bamboo shoots are the embryo of sun splendour, also called Great Brightness. They desire to always eat wild goose meat; the wild goose is the feathered crow of the moon embryo, also named Moon Egret. To take the sun and moon one must eat these things, so qi responds and connects.

The True Immortal says: The wild goose is the general name of the feathered clan; magpies, wild geese, geese, and thrushes are all called wild geese or egrets.

An ancient song says: Wild geese and egrets of a thousand years, prepared as dishes to attain heavenly truth; the Five Emperors hold the moon splendour in their beaks, seated as guests in the void. This is the ancient song of the fishermen.

The Jade Morning Bright Mirror Scripture says: Again it preserves the names of the five spirits, each seated in their palace; the five spirits all breathe purple qi, entwining my body; inside and outside merge mysteriously until the hands and feet cannot see each other and then cease. Again it preserves the sun and moon issuing from between my cheeks; left the sun, right the moon; the two lights shine through; then the purple qi suddenly clears, and slowly the sun enters my mouth, the mouth immediately consumes it, tasting sweet like candy, stopping at the nine swallowings. Again it preserves the moon entering my navel, at the life gate, shining upon the yin chamber; meanwhile it preserves my hand holding the handle of the Big Dipper’s seven stars, wearing it as I walk and step, entering the purple chamber of Supreme Subtle, seeing the Emperor Lords saying: "Your attainment of Immortality I give you the jade talisman of ascent, inscribed with the nine heavens."

Within the pine and nine mysteries, arise and sit amid clouds; five talismans given to the imperial son ascend and return as the infant Hua. Again it says: The three and five reverse, Heaven covers earth as beginning; I have five talismans, ascending to the imperial son; the three do not remain long, tending the chamber within. Above is excerpted from the Scripture of the Five Elders Female One.

The Mysterious Inner Chapter says: The Supreme says: The primordial Way originally arises from no prior, ancestor of ten thousand breaths, origin of ten thousand ways, above the void and nothingness, no existence before, no form nor image, neither having nor not having, honouring non-existence above, precious beyond measure.

The Jade Morning Bright Mirror Scripture says: The Supreme One Emperor Lord’s Cavern True Mysterious Scripture preserves the five spirit methods; also preserves the spirits Supreme One, Unmanifest, White Origin, Controller of Fate, Peach Lord and others; altogether five female spirits and nine male spirits, named the Three Five Nine Seven; upon reaching the mysterious gate, their forms all resemble newborn infants; the five females and nine males each breathe white qi from their mouths, mutually fumigating the destined body; thus the five females and nine males blend one body, mixing into one unity, all forming one white qi round shape, like the sun’s luminous orb; presently the round light white qi transforms into two young children, one male and one female, both as newly born infants; the male is called the True of the Nine Primal, the female titled the Soul of the Supreme One; the male named Juzhi, styled Three Yang; the female named Shanggui, styled Imperial Son. Presently again appear the boy Juzhi and girl Shanggui, both standing in the sun and moon; the male in the sun, the female in the moon; sun and moon suspend in the Supreme Heaven; sun in the east, moon in the west; at that moment they realize their bodies have already together transformed into the white qi of the direction. Again it is heard the child Juzhi in the sun chanting: "Juzhi Three Yang, True of the Nine Primal, this is my title; the sun binds my body, tally and register in Jade Clarity, intimate with Heaven, mixing male and female, Immortals entwined." Again is heard the female Shanggui in the moon chanting: "Shanggui Imperial Son, Soul of the Supreme One, this is my title; the moon binds my essence, master of tally and register, already in Great Brightness, intimate with the Mysterious, longevity of ten thousand hundred million ages, mixing male and female, naked and radiant."

The Inner Transmission of Han Wu says: The Queen Mother of the West bestowed upon the Emperor the Scripture of the True Forms of the Five Mountains and the Scripture of the Spirit Light Birth; the Supreme Lady of the Upper Origin bestowed upon the Emperor the Twelve Matters of the Six Jia Spirit Flying Summons, and so forth. Some ride the void and step the mysterious feather method, various essential wondrous phrases; the Emperor himself compiled into one scroll; all received matters were sealed in golden boxes, enclosed in white jade cases, with coral beds, purple brocade pouches, placed on the beam platform; several times daily paying homage, burning incense, sprinkling and sweeping; the Emperor and Empress’s intentions were confused and mistaken; failing to cultivate the utmost precepts, always disregarding the Queen Mother’s words, so the Queen Mother ceased to come. At the beginning of No Year the heaven fire burned the beam platform, and the twelve received matters were thus lost.

The Scripture of Transforming Form, Concealing Image, Ascending and Preserving Immortality says: It preserves the nine morning Emperor Lords’ hidden consorts’ nine yin inner names; their forms, colours, and garments all shine clearly, coming from the Big Dipper, descending flame flows reflecting, splendid in the void, revolving spirits and mysterious illumination, entering my body. The nine mornings are the essences of the nine stars. The Purple Degree Flame Light Scripture speaks similarly.

The True Instruction says: The Lady of the Southern Mountain says the Treasure Spirit Scripture is the embroidered brocade bag book of Pei Qingling, which attendants always carry; Pei formerly received this book from the Lady of Purple Subtle; I also have it copied thus in the Western Palace’s fixed edition. Again asked the location of the Western Palace, the answer was: It is the northern altar of the Mysterious Garden, the upper terrace of the Western Jade; the Heavenly True precious writings are all stored therein. Pei the Perfected again said this is the same matter as the Hidden and Complete peers, immediately usable, also called the Seven Hidden Mysterious Books.

The True Instruction says: On the night of the twenty-fourth day of the sixth month, the Lady of Purple Subtle King came down; then descended to earth to inquire of the True Spirit, and so forth; daring to ask herein, wishing to instruct the obscure. The Lady then sat again, and immediately saw the divine command book; in reply it says: The vast empty void and mystery, no path to seek; speech emanates in the void, no thing to grasp, and so forth. Therefore the drifting primordial river entrusts itself to the wind stirring the oar, abiding on the void boat and moving; thus the void within the reality, the existence within non-image. As to the scriptural marks, they are inscribed on paper slips, and so forth. Exposed are relics of corporeal things, able to advance and retreat with the world; above blemishing the Immortal’s chant, below violating the forbidden boundary; also things we do not follow, the spiritual methods do not permit. Please state the origin of the book. After creation has begun, the five colours first sprout, the literature completes its elegance; the distinctions of peoples, the divisions of yin and yang; there are the Three Primal Eight Meetings, the texts of myriad directions flying to Heaven; there are also the Eight Dragon Spirit Seals, the bright light chapters; later, reaching the times of the Three Emperors, the Eight Meetings’ writings develop into dragon and phoenix chapters, abbreviating the cloud seal traces; these are called the proper form Sanskrit writings, dividing and breaking into two paths, ruining the Truth by ease; pairing and distinguishing the original branches; thus becoming sixty-four kinds of writings. They were disseminated throughout the thirty-six heavens and ten directions, above and below, and so forth. Comparing and discussing, the Eight Meetings’ writings are the ultimate truth of the book, the origin of literary composition; now the Three Primal Eight Meetings’ writings are used by the Jade Emperor, the Great Ultimate, and the high perfected Immortals; the cloud seal bright chapters are the characters of the divine spiritual talisman writings now seen.

The True Instruction says: The Lady of the Southern Mountain speaks to disciples, saying: "Tomorrow I shall go to the Clear Void Palace of Mount Wangwu, letting you know where I go."

The True Instruction says: The Purple Clear True Consort sat long, not speaking; the consort first held three jujubes in her hand, their colour like dried jujubes but elongated, lacking kernels, nor tasting like jujubes, tending to the taste of pears; the consort first gave one, then another to the Lady of Purple Subtle, keeping one herself, ordering all to eat; the True Consort asked about years and ascents, and so forth. The True Consort again says: "The Lady Master of the Southern Truth, Controller of Fate and holder of power, the Dao is lofty and wondrous, truly the ancestor of good virtue."

The True Instruction says: On the night of the twenty-sixth day of the sixth month, descended the Eight Perfected, the Left Lady of Purple Subtle King, the Purple Clear Upper Palace Nine Flower True Consort two, the Supreme Controller of Fate Southern Mountain Lady three, Purple Yang Perfected four, Clear Spirit Perfected five, Mao Central Lord six, Mao Little Lord seven. Also one spirit, very little organized, wearing a lotus crown, red robes, belt and sword, never seen before, secretly suspected to be Prince Qiao of Tong Mountain Perfected. Much discoursing of Golden Court Mountain affairs, many things are hard to understand; respectfully the Purple Subtle Upper True Nine Flowers Consort greeted all. The Official Supreme True said: "Yesterday with Uncle Shen we went to Clear Void Palace, comparing the gains and losses of True Immortals only; lately removing and eliminating forty-seven persons, restoring three persons; also reviewing your names and registers; now all is well; permitting certain persons to be in the official tally; certain names are the chief registrar’s." The day is the reality of the rosy clouds; the rosy cloud is the sun’s essence; though you have heard the method of taking sun reality, you have not yet known the method of eating rosy cloud essence. The Scripture of Eating Rosy Cloud is very secret, the way to bring forth rosy clouds is very easy; this is called the essence producing jade light, the method of rosy clouds reflecting Supreme Clarity. The eyes are the mirror of the body, the ears the windows of the frame; seeing too much dulls the mirror, hearing too much darkens the window; the concubine has a stone to grind the mirror and a method to open windows, so as to penetrate all spirits and perceive the utmost silence; is it possible?

The True Instruction says: Langye is the mansion of the Lang Wind. Above Kunlun are nine mansions, called the Nine Palaces; the Great Ultimate is the Supreme Palace. The Immortals are merely officials of the nine offices, but as for the Perfected, they are the lords and ministers of the Nine Palaces. The Immortal officials have higher and lower ranks, each with order and rank; the Immortals have left and right mansions, with left and right lords, left and right ministers, left and right supervisors. The Bright Great Cavern are Immortal ministers; wearing golden elixirs are ministers; wearing Ganoderma are supervisors. If one obtains the Great Ultimate hidden Ganoderma elixir, they become the Left Immortal Lord and Perfected.

The Perfected said: Men follow the vulgar in seeking illustrious fame, like burning incense; many hear its fragrance, yet do not know the smoke; thinking the flame burns out, the qi expires; fame established the body perishes; therefore the high ones smile and keep their distance, thus becoming pure and tranquil. Again it says: It is like riding an ice chariot in the fiery province, drifting on a fire boat over drowning ford. Unless truly authentic, one loses in myriad ways.

The True Instruction says: Zhang Jiangzi and others were formerly in the second rank, only beginning to enter the Easy Transition; the Easy Transition Childhood Second Palace is the hall of the Way of men and women; within it is quiet; the Blue Lord of the Eastern Sea visits twice a year; examining these palaces, observing the multitude.

Zhao Sutai, dwelling in Easy Transition for four hundred years, unwilling to move, claiming nowhere else under Heaven is more pleasant. Sutai was daughter of Zhao Xi, who was Prefect of Youzhou in the Han; she aided the poor in the river, rescued Yu Hui and others from clan extermination, practiced dozens of acts of hidden virtue; thus her body attained to Zhu Ling; her sons now all dwell in the Cavern Heavens; Xi often entered and left the Fixed Register Office.

In Easy Transition are lofty and desolate ones: Dou Qiongying, Han Taihua, Liu Chunlong, Wang Jinxian, Li Xizi, Guo Shuxiang; these several all of heavenly talent and elegant bearing, pure and lofty, their abilities as if surpassing the norm; their demeanor startling the crowd; these are the high ones among the masters, the capable immortals. Next are those like Zhang Jiangzi and Deng Bommiao’s mother, who had good deeds; thus later generations mostly seek their protection. Dou Qiongying was sister of Dou Wu; the seventh ancestor named Zhi was skilled in hiding dry bones to revive the dead; thus blessing extended to Ying. Han Taihua was sister of An Guo, wife of the Han Second Master General Li Guangli; Li had merits and virtues in past lives; Li now also dwells in the palace receiving transformation. Liu Chunlong was daughter of Liu Fengxian, Han Grand Tutor. Li Xizi was grandmother of Li Zhong, Governor of Eastern Ping, whose grandfather and ancestors performed many acts of hidden virtue; once on a heavy snowy cold day, often left grains exposed in the garden, fearing birds would starve to death; such was his care. Wang Jinxian was daughter of Wang Yan; served Xu Chief Clerk. Guo Shuxiang was mother of Wang Xiu; Wang Xiu styled Shuzhi, a native of Beihai, secretary to Wei Wu; lost mother at seven years; mother died on the society day, unknown who she was. In the Childhood Office were Wang Shaodao, Fan Shusheng, Li Boshan; all exemplary in the Childhood Office.

The True Instruction says: Lang Zong, styled Zhong Sui, a native of Anqiu in Beihai, served as county magistrate of Wu County; studied the Way and arts, divining wind qi; one day there was a violent wind at the window; divined a great fire would burn the city gate of Daxia; sent men to verify; the lords hearing this summoned him by doctorate; he was ashamed to be summoned for divination, and at night removed his seals and ribbons, carrying his books fled, dwelling beneath Mount Hua; taking hemp pills he attained the Way; now dwelling in the cavern. Also there was Zhu [name], of Chenliu, a lawless man engaging in robbery; later discovered, fled afar to the Shaoshi Mountain of Runan; saw Master Feng hidden in study; after three years was taught the True Way; remained on the mountain taking food, cultivating the Dao thirty-eight years; later entered East Pit Mountain; lived one hundred forty-seven years; an Immortal descended to take him into the Great Abundance Mountain Cavern to become a Perfected. Also Guo Jing, of Yingchuan, orphaned young; at sixteen summoned as official; later convicted and escaped hiding; two months did not emerge; met Master Zheng; followed Zheng’s commands; seven years did not slacken; was taught key guides of breathing and movement, taking herbs and Poria, attaining three hundred years; later on Tianwei Mountain, Chisongzi descended and bestowed True Way to them two; now in Great Abundance Cavern is a Perfected.

Again it says: Sima Ji Lord entered the Stone Chamber of Great Abundance Palace in Weiyu Mountain, receiving the Stone Essence Golden Light Hidden Image Transformation method from Xiling Zidou; Zidou was the Supreme Mysterious Immortal Maiden. At that time those now in Great Abundance Chamber were Bao Shuyang of Guangning, Wang Boyang of Taiyuan, Liu Weihui of Yingchuan, Duan Jizheng of Daijun; all received the Way of Master Xiling Zidou. Ji Lord at his departure entrusted his form to pillow and mat as his likeness; his tomb is in Shupan Mountain south of Chengdu in Shu Prefecture; Zhuge Wuhou formerly built a stele praising virtue before Ji Lord’s tomb; the stele’s inscription ends: Vast and silent is the mysterious desert, blending yin and yang; Heaven and Earth join and separate; myriad things grow and flourish. The Master divines yarrow stalks, distinguishing soft and hard; spirits observe, the six degrees manifest clearly. Ji Lord’s face was like a young girl, beard and sideburns like three heavens, his blackness like ink. He appointed two persons each to practice the Way; the male named Ruyu, the female named Jihua; now both dwell in Weiyu Mountain; Jihua today is reading the thirty-ninth chapter, not yet finished.

The Preface Instructions of Lord Pei say: Lord Pei styled Xuanren, in youth was of decent appearance and bearing; his eyes had piercing light; his arms hung down to the knees; his voice was clear and penetrating, calling out like a bell ringing.

The True Instruction says: The tree of fire jujube and crossing pear is in the heart of the lord; now the heart still has thorns and brambles intermingled; hence the two trees are not seen; it is uncertain whether the brambles can be cut to reveal the tree. This tree grows alone, how good it would be.

The Secrets of Ascending the True says: The Supreme Subtle forms the twenty-four inner spirits of the Purple Origin; the vital breath transforms spirits; the lords of Immortality and Supreme Essence; those able to cultivate and preserve the true name govern and guard the body, preserve the original essence; the Purple Void joins and condenses the qi of the mysterious ancestry, completing the body’s spirit apparatus, linking and guiding clouds and mist, bearing the true smoke of life; each is able to summon jade carriages and dragon riders, tens of thousands arrayed; united as one carriage; ascending by daylight to the morning; this is the Way of the Great Perfected who ride the rushing storm; practiced for eighteen years, the Supreme ordered the Supreme Subtle Mixing Spirit Lord to command the twenty-four Perfected Lords, thousands of chariots and ten thousand riders, speeding the wind and treading the clouds, breathing and flowing upward, ascending by daylight to Heaven’s annotation within. According to the Scripture of the Three Ones: Within the Supreme Subtle are twenty-four energies; within the energies are twenty-four Perfected Lords, all ministers of the Emperor Lords, thus producing the divisions of Way and transformation. Having attained to guard the Three Ones within the body, then the Three Ones of Supreme Subtle, the Emperor Lords, descend to appear outside, speaking to their sons; all enter and exit Supreme Clarity, resting in Supreme Subtle. According to this saying, guarding the three parts within the body can also summon the twenty-four Perfected Lords, thousands of chariots and ten thousand riders to come to greet. Entering the sun’s left dragon named Storm Spirit, right dragon named Swift Pavilion, preserving the two dragons both breathing white smoke; not only the true spirit of oneself, but able to leap the mysterious firmament.

The Inner Transmission of Master Ge says: My uncle Xiao Xian said: You have passed beyond vulgar tastes, rushing after the splendid Way, admiring Immortals; indeed this is the highest achievement of the Perfected of Nest Qi.

The Scripture of the Jade Forest of the Immortal Abode of Supreme Clarity ends.
