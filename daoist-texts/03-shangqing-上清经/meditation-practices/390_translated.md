The Great Clarity Perfected Man’s Instructions for Binding the Life

The Yellow Elder said: The soul is not merely the soul itself, but is my ghost. The ghost is that which precedes man. Where there is breath there is soul. The soul as ghost is to guard my soul#1. The spirit (po) is my form; the person (ren) is my po. When a person dies, the soul departs; the po alone remains with the form. The po returns to the earth, the soul ascends to heaven. Therefore it is said that the po is the inner country, and the soul is the outer country. He who cultivates the Way should know that the inner and outer mutually correspond, thus communicating with the divine brightness. He who does not know the inner and outer is lost. He who is ignorant of the outer country’s people wanders about the five viscera and six entrails, ceaselessly day and night. The soul and po are the sun and moon; how then may they be spoken of?

The Yellow Elder said: Heaven has sun and moon; they are the soul and po of heaven. To practise the Way is thus; how should one proceed? In heaven they are the sun and moon; in man they are soul and po. The will and desire are to be their agents. How then can the true Way be attained, to be raised together with heaven, and whence to come from the inner country? The outer country is the soul; the inner country is the po. The soul guards at night, hence it is said to guard the soul. The po guards by day, hence it is said to guard the po. The sage said: One yin and one yang are husband and wife; their name is the Way. By day guard the yang; how is that spoken of? At dawn when the sun rises, the soul governs itself, and the soul should guard the po. When the sun sets the soul departs from itself, and so the po guards the soul. Two persons mutually obtain and follow; joy attends the union of yin and yang; how can one obtain another? Hence it is said one yin and one yang are clearly united in form and appearance. The sun moves by day, the moon by night; the sun is man; how is that spoken of? The sun and moon, soul and po, are the unique spirits of heaven and earth; yet they do not know themselves. They correspond with heaven and earth, and are of one mind. The kidney is called the moon, the heart the sun; the liver is soul, the lung is po; but it is not so. Heaven illumines and perceives sun, moon, and stars; the wise see birth and death; the moon also has birth and death. The sun is one; the moon is two; the form is three. Therefore the Old Lord said: One begets two, two begets three, three begets the myriad things; yet they do not know it themselves. Without this knowledge there is no Way, no birth of myriad things. When the moon is present it is the White Tiger; when the sun is present it is the Azure Dragon. To walk the Way is thus; the man should be careful not to neglect it.

The Yellow Elder said: The soul governs the po and form, communicates light with sun and moon; the spirit remains yet does not know itself. The five viscera and six entrails, where is the foremost place? It is not said to be to save the world, but it may make the form strong and flourishing. The ghost is not ghost; it is called the human soul. The po is called my form.

The Immortals’ Chart says: I am the Way. Divided into yin and yang three spirits, situated in the Mud Pellet. Marked and preserved in thought, it may be called the heavenly treasure. Formerly the Way asked the spirit: Heaven therefore sent a son down to dwell with man, to preserve and guard the body, so that spirit and essence are not lost, the five viscera at peace, soul and po always present. Departing from roaming, unwilling to assist the spirit, going far away and not returning, or ascending to heaven, the body dies and life is ended. Daily is heard the sound of weeping; the blood and vessels decay; the bones enter the spring. Each should know where to direct treatment for cure, sit up and arise to act as a kitchen servant. It is like a great palace, a thousand li without food kept; all serve on either side. The master leaves great grace; one may exert all effort.

The Master said: To desire to serve the Way’s method, first one must confess crimes and faults, then openly seek pardon and removal, repent and correct oneself, change evil for good; then may one worship and visit the heavenly officers, with rank of ten thousand shi, salary from the heavenly granary, honoured above the supreme emperor, esteemed above kings and nobles. How then may one again do evil? The first is to preserve the five beasts. The five beasts are called Azure Dragon, White Tiger, Vermilion Bird, Black Tortoise, and Yellow Dragon. The second is to pass through the storehouses from head to foot, preserving their spirits, nourishing their roots, practising their qi, calling their names. The third is to guard one earth, called the cinnabar field, pure white as snow, five colours mixed yellow; the mother of the Way dwells there, in the weak water cell. The fourth is to guard one person, called the scarlet palace, Great One of the South Pole; a red child and small boy; on left and right sun and moon, soul and po united. The fifth is to guard one heaven, called the purple palace, as large as a chicken’s egg, five colours mixed yellow, governed by the double dipper, regulating stars and annals. Six is to take the cinnabar field, governing birth of three, five, seven, and nine, and with the moon at mid-Jiawu it is auspicious. Seven is to take the golden liquid, essence of dark water, to be used at the fifteenth hour plus midnight. Eight is to take repeated five-coloured gold yellow, morning meal, evening meal, noon, midnight. Nine is to take the supreme ultimate purple cloud, narrow beyond heaven, rising above and below, chaotic and formless. If you desire to unify the three parts into one, know that the visible has form, but one still guards the formless. If you desire to preserve the upper part one, yellow as the orange, still preserve the middle part one, red as blood, guard the lower part one, white as snow. Within them is the divine person, wearing red clothes, nine inches tall, crowned with the nine virtues’ crown, wearing green jade hairpins, named Xuxu. Constantly imagine and see it, causing one’s ears and eyes to be intelligent, increasing the clarity of vision, dispersing confusion, removing blindness and want. If much thought troubles you, or you long see written documents so that your eyes lose brightness and heart is confused, blame this too.

The liver is wood; it lies beneath the left ribs; its colour is pure green, like the crest of a wild duck; its six-leafed gallbladder hangs in the centre, coloured like a swollen blood sac. Within the liver dwells a divine person, clad in green, eight inches tall, named Lanlan. Within the gallbladder is a divine person, three inches tall, clad in white, named Huhu. Constantly imagine and see them, causing no alarm, fear, or joy. If the heart is startled, the gallbladder spirit is damaged. Imagine and see the liver and gallbladder to restore it. When ill, if one is vexed by joy or anger, fearful or timid, blame this also. The spleen is beneath the right ribs, above the stomach’s upper end, straight and upright; its colour is like gold. Within it is a divine person clad in yellow, six inches tall, named Bibi. Constantly imagine and see him, causing joy without harm; men are also prudent, women serene. If sorrow and thought arise, then the spleen spirit is damaged. Imagine and see the spleen to restore it. If there is grief or pain, also recall it to restore the spirit. The stomach lies three inches below the liver in the chest; its colour is yellow, governing the full five tastes. Within it is a divine person clad in red, five inches tall, named Dandan. When food and drink cause distension and fullness, first lie on the right side, stretching hands and feet, greatly distending the belly; then breathe out qi through the mouth, calling its spirit’s name, and with the hand press two inches down to suppress it; soon it will be cured. It is said that the spirit drives out the food qi. The kidneys lie beside the spine at the waist, shaped like a crouching rat, streaked with yellow-white fat. Often they appear like large soybeans, black and shining like lacquer above. Within the kidneys is a white person, four inches tall, named Piaopiao. Constantly think of him, causing yin and yang to harmonize, ears not to be deaf. If for long one hears sounds, then the kidney spirit is damaged. Constantly imagine the kidney’s form to restore it. If the ears hear nothing, blame this also.

Transmit to later learners: exert effort. You are in a perilous age; you should cultivate my Way. The radiance is in the red line; look and wrap the ninety-nine; the five jades illuminate the central palace; guard one and you may endure long. Learn the Way with no early or late, but only practise it. To obtain the Way is vast and broad, truly as though the belly had a treasury. In the accumulation of gold upwards and downwards, think of the three palaces, sit up, remember not to forget the solitary, and it will endure long. Learning the Way requires abiding in the discourse upon the carriage. The unworthy like the sage, each should be for himself; he who contains harmony with nature, there is nothing he cannot stumble over. High and low mutually serve; beware lest you envy or resent the divine brightness. Then record the faults and offences; afterward you will lose by a hair’s breadth and differ by tens of thousands of li. The three corpses oversee human offences at the end of the month; all are your husbands and wives; care is in your feelings and heart’s unkindness.

The spirit said: I dwell with man; is it always well? I dwell with man, thinking to be of benefit; man himself neglects, does not love his body, pushes me away, injures me, insults me, restrains me by women, wears me out by beauty, disturbs me, abandons me, deceives me; and does not keep me by the Way. I also abandon him. Each is in man; how can it be in me?

The Way asked the spirit: When man is born, there is no male or female; all contain the kingly qi of yin and yang. If one desires to nourish the nature, preserve the spirit, endure long and not die, looking over the world, what shall be done? The spirit replied: The dwelling of man receives the supreme qi; the four limbs and five viscera each have their spirit; the heart is red, the lung white, mutually connected. Those who go against it die; those who accord with it live. Carefully recollect the five viscera, call their names; below to remove sickness, above to become immortal. Truly to know the Way in full, hereafter you may transmit it.

The spirit said: Always think of the left eye as the scarlet palace, the right eye as the jade hall; within is a red person, causing the eyes to be bright, at night to have light as by day. The eyes face the wind moving; eyes suffer sudden illness; at dusk go to rest; close the eyes and think of it, inward vision will heal itself. At night it may illuminate fish; by day one may read books.

The spirit said: Always think that upon your head and forehead is a person five inches tall, wearing five-coloured clothes; sometimes think three inches forward from the forehead; its colour is pure yellow, a perfect disk; causing the head and forehead to have abundant refined thought; evil spirits dare not approach.

The spirit said: Always think of a person emerging two inches below the nose, clad in yellow robes, sitting upright in a bright pavilion; causing one to know fragrance and stench, no longer suffering from impediments or illnesses.

The spirit said: Always think of the brightness of birth; causing the five viscera to be stable and peaceful, blood and vessels to flow harmoniously; women’s complexion to be fair, men to be upright and strong.

The spirit said: Always think that on your left is blue light, on your right white light, before is red light, behind is black light; all coming to attach to you. To see this light constantly is not lasting; therefore it is said to constantly produce brightness of birth.

The spirit said: Always at the time of cockcrow, think of the east being truly blue; fix your mind and think your own body is truly blue. From the time of Chen (7 a.m.) to Si (9 a.m.), think of the south being truly red; fix your mind and think your own body truly red. From Wei (1 p.m.) to Shen (3 p.m.), think of the west being truly white; fix your mind and think your own body truly white. From Xu (7 p.m.) to Hai (9 p.m.), think of the north being truly black; fix your mind and think your own body truly black. At the time of Wu and Ji (midday), think of it truly yellow; fix your mind and think your own body truly yellow. Do not forget through the four seasons; suddenly one is exalted. Women who think thus have fixed mind; milk is easily produced; at menstrual times there is no disease of yang.

The spirit said: The five viscera, always think of the names of the five viscera inside the intestines, each in fullness. Each viscera has its own fullness: the liver is green, master of the soul, within is the green person; the lung is white, master of the po, within is the white person; the heart is red, master of the spirit, within is the red person; the kidney is black, master of the will, within is the black person; the spleen is yellow, master of the thought, within is the yellow person. Therefore it is said the five viscera. Constantly think of their spirits, causing no retention of blood sickness in the belly, no accumulation of qi, no heaviness or greasiness in the intestines; regulate and benefit the mechanisms. If one who requests to be born loses spirit, also think of this to restore it.

The spirit said: Constantly think of yourself as the five jades. The law of the five jades: on days Jia and Yi, think of yourself as green jade; on days Bing and Ding, think of yourself as red jade; on days Wu and Ji, think of yourself as yellow jade; on days Geng and Xin, think of yourself as white jade; on days Ren and Gui, think of yourself as black jade. So everywhere sitting and thinking of it, closing the eyes internally, only avoid shaking hands and feet, dispersing and dissolving; after a while suddenly one says oneself to be formless. Spirit and essence are settled, no longer wandering afar; lying down no evil dreams or evil spirits; it is said evil spirits fear the five jades.

The spirit said: To settle the spirit, think of the six dragons. What are the six dragons? The liver is the Azure Dragon, the lung the White Tiger, the heart the Vermilion Bird, the kidney the Black Tortoise, the spleen the Yellow Dragon, the gallbladder the Flying Snake. The scripture says: Dragon and snake combine their essence, firmly guarding without desire, roaming in thought.

The spirit said: All men’s faces, limbs, five viscera, hands and feet all have spirit, each with its own name and place of dwelling. For example, the nose’s spirit is called Nose; the heart’s spirit is called Heart. Heaven’s Way is thus. In one day, one should think to preserve all these spirits; then the bones and joints become strong and firm, the qi force vigorous. If the names are not known, the soul and po do not know entering and departing. If one desires to cauterize or prick, first with the hand pat and say: Spirit and essence together move, needles and fire apply in the proper place; pursue and avoid the person accordingly.

The spirit said: The throat extends from the root of the tongue downward to the heart, one foot long; it enters the heart’s middle node, like a string of jade rings, countless in number; in the midst is a red robe; on left and right are two divine persons guarding it. Constantly imagine and see them, causing one not to forget, no cough or reversed illness; if desirous of joy or forgetfulness, blame this.

The liver causes the colour to be like white silk folded with pure green; the jade leaf lies before, covering the upper half of the heart; three leaves lie behind, embracing the heart. Within the lungs is a divine person, pure white, seven inches tall, holding a jade halberd, dwelling among the leaves, named Chui. Imagine and see him, causing no affliction, no nausea or vomiting, complexion like jade’s sheen. If one sees death, bleeding, foul rat-like form, it is the spirit that is damaged; constantly think of the lung spirit to restore it. The foul form means that which the heart does not usually approve. The heart is fire; its colour is red and bright like a flower, with a large root below, placed above the diaphragm, straight to the breasts.

Above is a floral canopy; below, in the midst, is the Dipper’s Door; below that is the path of the sun and moon. The three ones are in man, bright as the pearl moon; if you diligently guard it what more do you seek? To preserve one earth is at the path of the sun and moon; to preserve one man is at the Dipper’s Door; to preserve one heaven is beneath the floral canopy. The original qi lightly and swiftly leads and moves, within is a divine tortoise sharply elevated; if you desire to know the one, you should ask me, inquire where I am. Not only is there a male one#2, but also a female one, in the formless, very difficult to know. If you do not know, ten thousand affairs are lost; as large as a pellet, yellow as an orange, disjoining and joining in the jewel chamber, divided into two halves yet united as one; flowing to illuminate the world, red as the sun, if you guard it all affairs are concluded.

The lower cinnabar field is two inches below the navel, three inches wide and long; above white, below black; left blue, right yellow; in the centre a red child like a yellow chicken’s egg. The middle cinnabar field is the heart; big above, small below; the centre red as fire; within is the Great One, eight inches tall, wearing a red cap. The hall of Wu and Ji spirits is at the upper border of the heart, red, white, and red. The upper cinnabar field is beneath the floral canopy, between the two eyebrows, half sun on the left and half moon on the right, penetrating one inch; only the centre is the red child, the Yellow Elder Lord; on left and right the jade boys of the two kidneys, attending the Lord with cap and sash. As large as a pellet, yellow as an orange; only you guard it carefully and do not lose it. Disjoining and joining in the jewel chamber, divided into two halves yet united as one; flowing to illuminate the world, red as the sun; you know it, guard it carefully and do not lose it. To expel and preserve as stars, beneath the floral canopy three stars cover the Lord; the head round resembling heaven, hair blue-black and long; two males square and correct; eyebrows like a stretched bow; ears spread to the four directions; below they wear jade pendants; the left eye is the sun, the right eye is the moon.

From the left kidney comes the Supreme Spiritual General, seventy-two zhang tall, wearing a red cap and great crown, crimson robe and cinnabar clothes, holding a golden tally in the right hand, commanding three hundred thousand troops; going forth dressed in red clothes, residing at my left. From the right kidney comes the Deputy General, seventy-one zhang tall, wearing a red cap and great crown, crimson robe and light clothes, holding a jade halberd in the left hand, commanding three hundred thousand troops; going forth dressed in red clothes, residing at my right. From the spleen comes the General of the Self, eighty-one zhang tall, wearing a red cap and great crown, crimson robe and light clothes, holding a baton in the left hand, commanding three hundred thousand troops; all going forth in red clothes, residing before me#3.
