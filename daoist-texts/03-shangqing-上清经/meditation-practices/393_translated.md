The Five Yang Palaces

One inch is the Palace of the Bright Hall, where the Great Emperor of Longevity dwells.

Two inches is the Palace of the Inner Chamber, where the Central Yellow Lord resides.

The Bright Hall Palace: The First Way of Ascendance

From the corners of both eyebrows, inward three inches, on the left is the Crimson Terrace and Blue Chamber, on the right the Yellow Gate and Purple Door. The Crimson Terrace is a platform of red jade, with chambers of blue jade; within is a great deity clad in blue brocade, holding a flowing golden fire bell, named Right Heart, styled Cutting Square. The Yellow Gate is a platform of yellow jade, with chambers of purple jade; within is a great deity clad in yellow brocade, holding a flowing golden fire bell, named Tranquillity, styled Law King. They breathe forth clouds of blue, yellow, and purple qi, sitting within, forbidding all evil and malevolent spirits. If there is a sound as of metal ringing or jade striking within the ears, it is the arrival of external matters entering the palace; the two deities sound the golden bell and jade chime to announce to the Nine Palaces. Quickly rub both hands until hot, cover the ear gates, strike the teeth nine times, and silently recite the incantation of the heart:

The infant dwells in the palace, the nine palaces in the chambers, please heed the spirit's command, to repel misfortune; the Great Oneâ€™s flowing fire, remove calamity and harm.

When the incantation is finished, one feels heat on the face; this is the approach of evil qi. Quickly preserve the two deities casting the flowing golden fire bells, issuing forth from the corners of the eyebrows. After a while, again rub both hands until hot, cover the ears; if the head and face feel warm, then the evil qi is gone. If feeling cold and chilling, then the evil qi remains; strike the teeth nine times again, recite the heart incantation thrice, the two deities cast the flowing golden fire bells throughout the mud pellet, and the evil is immediately expelled. Then lie down briefly; after a short time stand and recover.

One inch within the eyebrows is called the Palace of the Bright Hall. On the left is the image of the sun, nine fen in diameter, with nine purple rays. On the right is the image of the moon, one inch in diameter, with ten yellow rays. In the centre is the deity Mirror Bright Lord, appearing like a newly born infant, clad in green brocade, wearing a flowing golden fire bell, holding a red jade mirror in the mouth, radiating red light. He is the spirit division of the Great Emperor of Longevity, styled the True Lord of the Bright Hall, named Four Bright, styled Illuminating Essence. On the left is Lord Bright Boy True Lord, like the imperial image, being the spirit division of Lord Han, named Mysterious Yang, styled Lesser Clear. On the right is Lady Bright True Lord, likewise like the imperial image, named Mysterious Yin, styled Lesser Origin. After invoking their names thrice, strike the teeth nine times, and recite the heart incantation:

Purple Door, Blue Chamber, within are great deities, cutting the law, the square king; next entering the Bright Hall, Mysterious Bright, Primordial Clear, Four Bright Illuminating Essence, sitting to guard the Bright Hall, holding the jade mirror, cutting off misfortune, flowing golden fire bells, removing evil and harm.

As if in a night journey, keeping the three lords in mind to illumine the path with the red jade mirror as a light, after some time it grows bright. When encountering evil men and demons, passing through evil temples and places of bandits, keep the three lords shaking the red jade mirror, like the sound of thunder, causing soldiers, bandits, and demons all to tremble and fall. Should one meet pestilential evil qi, chills and heat, dryness of the body, then keep the three lords shaking the jade mirror forty-nine times, transforming into great fire, burning the body of the supplicant; after some time sweat issues warmly, and the illness immediately recedes. Whenever on a journey food is lacking or one suffers hunger, keep the three lords shaking the red jade mirror thirty-six times; the red qi in the mirror turns to red liquid upon the tongue and palate; hold it in the mouth without swallowing; after a while a warm sensation arises, swallow three times in three portions; hunger and thirst are immediately removed.

Whenever sounds of combs striking, waves rising, or drums beating are heard within the ears, it is a sign of bodily fatigue and impending chronic illness. Quickly burn incense, lie down upon the couch in a quiet chamber, keep the three lords shaking the jade mirror twenty-four times; the red qi pervades the body, transforms into great fire, refining the form to redness; after some time the illness is immediately removed. Should there be sudden and unexplained bleeding, or the smell of blood be perceived, it signifies calamities of war and violent misfortune; quickly observe fasting, enter the chamber, do not meet with others, and seek aid of the Three Primal Emperors and the Three Lords of the Bright Hall; within a month the misfortune shall be transformed to good fortune. Should evil dreams be encountered, turn the pillow and quilt; lay the left hand on the heart, strike the teeth twenty-four times, and silently recite:

Great Cavern of True Mystery, refine the three souls, receive the heart's command, swiftly open the Supreme Three Primal Palaces; on encountering misfortunate dreams, these are the seven souls wandering corpses aiding evil sources; hasten to summon Peach-Kang to protect the life, report to the Emperor Lords, the Five Elders and Nine True Ones all guarding the body's gates; the Yellow Gate Divine Master and Purple Door General, holding axes and swinging bells, dispel and wear away evil spirits, reverse misfortune to good, life and death without bond.

After reciting thrice and waiting a while, open the four great directions, lie down briefly; surely there will be auspiciousness. If practiced for three years, no dreams of all kinds will occur; all that seems dreamlike shall be the portents of future good or ill.

The Inner Chamber Palace: The Second Way of Ascendance

The supplicant enters the chamber, burns incense, strikes teeth, sits upright, calms the heart and quiets thought; within resides the Yellow Lord, breathing forth purple qi; he draws in the qi through his own nose, swallowing it thirty-five times; he governs the water, fire, and weapons of the three realms, the myriad calamities and hardships of the human world, extending life and measuring fate, turning death into life, as the Great Cavern's revolving wind mixed with the Way. The supplicant preserves himself beside the Yellow Lord, silently reciting nine chapters, eighty-one chapters counted nine times, constituting one cycle; then all names of the three realms are raised, the five emperors fixed in their stations, arrayed as perfected beings, all the myriad spirits present within the person. Then one exhales and inhales the purple qi, irrigating the whole body.

The Mud Pellet Palace: The Third Way of Ascendance

The supplicant enters the chamber, burns incense, strikes teeth, sits upright, calms the heart and quiets thought; within is the Heavenly Emperor, appearing as a newly born infant, clad in red brocade, sitting at midday, reciting the three heavenly secret names; he is the division of the Primordial Supreme. On the left is the Upper Primal Red Infant Emperor, likewise a newborn infant form, clad in red embroidered splendid robes, named Condensed Beginning Heaven, styled Primordial Foremost, holding the divine tiger talisman. On the right is the Imperial Minister, likewise like a newborn infant, clad in red splendid robes, named Beginning Essence, styled Mysterious Life, holding the "Great Cavern True Scripture," with seven stars covering above, pointing forward with the handle; the palace is filled with purple qi, soaring ninety thousand li to the heavens.

The Flowing Pearl Palace: The Fourth Way of Ascendance

The supplicant enters the chamber, burns incense, strikes teeth, sits upright, calms the heart and quiets thought; preserves the True Spirit of the Flowing Pearl, who is the division of the Supreme Tao Lord. He is also able to gather and direct all acts, and is the palace where the grass immortals dwell.

The Mysterious Elixir Palace: The Fifth Way of Ascendance

The supplicant enters the chamber, burns incense, and prays to open the Purple Micro Mysterious Elixir Palace, to the Supreme Central Emperor, styled Jueguiying, styled White Transformation Origin, with golden bed and jade curtain, purple embroidered skirt, belt with fire bells, cutting off evil and destroying treachery, holding the star essence in hand, with a round light about his neck, sitting upright breathing forth qi, extinguishing the traces of demonic smoke, feasting with the spirits and qi elixir, harmonizing soul and refining spirit, to preserve the flying immortal. The supplicant now offers his sincere rites, the myriad transformations are generated.

Next burn incense, preserve the northern dipper where a single strand of purple qi descends; entering through the eyebrow gate into the Mysterious Elixir Palace. Next preserve the sun image in the ladle mouth descending; from between the eyebrows directly entering the palace; in a moment like purple mist filling the brain, resembling a fiery pearl. After a while, suddenly the Mysterious Elixir Lord descends from the ladle mouth, enters through the brow gate, sits at midday, clad in purple embroidered jade robes, with a purple embroidered splendid skirt, wearing a purple jade morning crown, holding the ladle handle in the left handâ€”this is the star Wei; in the right hand holding the rotating root, that is the Purple Micro Dipper mouth, facing, arrayed with six stars in horizontal rows of brightness, the sixth star. He breathes forth purple qi diffusely, with a belt of fire bells. Next preserve oneself, appearing like a lotus seed, clad in blue robes and hat, holding a slip before the Mysterious Elixir Lord, bowing nine times, silently praying:

Juegui White Transformation. Invoke thrice, strike the teeth nine times. After a while, the Mysterious Elixir Lord and the supplicant ride the crimson qi together into the ladle's golden platform and jade palace, with shining gem curtains, golden bed, jade table. The supplicant and Mysterious Elixir Lord bow thrice, kneel, and swallow eighty-one breaths of purple qi. The Mysterious Elixir Lord rides the purple qi with the supplicant back to the Mysterious Elixir Palace to sit. The supplicant then rests before the Mysterious Elixir Lord, concentrates for a long time, and a miraculous response appears; after a moment of waiting, he calms and leaves the chamber. This is the usual practice.

Next, upon the Beginning of Spring and the Spring Equinox, riding purple qi into the ladle, reaching the Morning Star, each drinks nine breaths of blue qi. Upon Beginning of Summer and the Summer Solstice, reaching the Elixir Star, drinks three breaths of red qi. Upon Beginning of Autumn and the Autumn Equinox, reaching the Yin Essence Star, each drinks seven breaths of white qi. Upon Beginning of Winter and the Winter Solstice, reaching the Mysterious Darkness Star, each drinks five breaths of black qi. The four seasons arrive at the Heavenly Pass Star, drinking twelve breaths of yellow qi. When completed, the Great One returns with the supplicant to the Mysterious Elixir Palace; the supplicant then returns within the mind. Practiced for eighteen years, with a thousand steeds and ten thousand chariots, greeting the rising white sun at dawn. Its efficacy is most wonderful, restraining myriad demons, beyond full description. If one follows this Way, there is no need to practice the San Yi method further.

The True Yin Inner Spirits of the Four Yin Palaces: The Jade Secret

Whoever studies the Way of Supreme Truth, if ignorant of the names of the True Yin of the Four Yin Palaces within, can never attain immortality. The learner receives the teacherâ€™s secret instructions, then respectfully practices.

The Divine Mother of Jade Purity, surname Lian, named Xian, styled Huangyan, is nine inches and nine fen long; clad in black and yellow simple spirit ribbons, her head adorned with a headdress of seven strings of pearls and jade, wearing the Crown of Infinite Worthy Advancement, dwelling in the peerless Supreme Ultimate Pearl Palace, the treasury of seven treasures, the five spirit township of Mysterious Origin; beneath she governs the supplicantâ€™s body in the Jade Emperor Palace.

The True Lady of Supreme Purity, surname Jue, named Hui, styled Bilei, is six inches and six fen long; clad in blue treasure divine light brocade cloud ribbons of nine colours, her head wearing a jade treasure flying cloud headdress, crowned with black and yellow Worthy Advancement crown, dwelling in the peerless Upper Supreme Kunlun Supreme Hidden Palace, Bright Hall Office of Nine Lights, township of Great Transformation; beneath she governs the supplicantâ€™s body in the Heavenly Court Palace.

The Empress Consort of the Supreme Ultimate, surname Xuan, named Xusheng, styled Bowu, is seven inches and seven fen long; clad in black gauze flowing light five-coloured phoenix patterned ribbons, her head crowned with seven treasures of mysterious cloud headdress, wearing the Crown of Infinite Worthy Advancement, dwelling above the Original Scenery in the Supreme Clear Utmost Mysterious Palace, Jade Chamber Office of Three Elixirs, township of Elixir Origin; beneath she governs the supplicantâ€™s body in the Utmost Truth Palace.

The Supreme Lordâ€™s Consort, surname Qian, named Hanhai, styled Hexiansheng, is three inches and three fen long; clad in seven treasures flying essence mysterious light cloud brocade frost gauze nine-coloured patterned ribbons, head wearing a nine mysteries jade essence drooping cloud headdress, crowned with black and yellow infinite three treasures jade crown, dwelling in the Supreme Clear Nine Mysteries above the Cavern Floating Utmost Truth Palace, Elixir Essence Office, township of Cloud Light Mysterious; beneath she governs the supplicantâ€™s body in the Supreme Sovereign Palace.

Those who walk the Way of the Mysterious Elixir, guarding the San Yi secret, must preserve the spirits of the Four Yin True Ones, with their clothes, forms, names, styles, and abodes. This precious scriptureâ€™s upper chapter is transmitted to the perfected ones who have appeared; beginners cannot grasp its essentials. The secret of the simple spirit is not practised in the world. All who receive the Supreme Truth method, the Three Treasures Divine Scripture, though they penetrate spirit and subtlety, if ignorant of the methods of the Four Yin True One, shall accomplish nothing. Therefore the Supreme One imposes a grave prohibition against light divulgence; it is not recorded upon paper or ink. Those who have it should examine their true heart, then receive it. At every New Yearâ€™s Day, new moon, and the yearâ€™s birth day, bathe and observe purity; enter the chamber, face the directions, preserve and think on the spirits of the Four Yin True Ones, their abodes, names, clothes, colours, lengths as above. When completed, strike the teeth thirty-six times and recite the incantation:

Supreme True Yin Spirit, styled the Lady Spirit, transmuting the Nine Mysteries, riding the True Hidden Darkness, daily reporting to Heavenly Mystery, reporting to Supreme Purity; with heart and gaze, penetrating divine form, returning to palace guarding the abode, jade splendour fragrant and full, five colours changing, flowing yellow, purple, blue, directing the flying rosy clouds, ascending to the Imperial Court.

When the incantation is finished, swallow the breath thirty-six times and cease. If practiced thus for nine years, the face develops jade splendour, golden truth reflecting light; the spirit sees the body, and speaks with the supplicant; when the child has seen the spirit and the heart knows itself, be careful not to rashly transmit.

These Four Yin True One spirits are the yin officials born of Heavenâ€™s beginning, styled Empress Consort; their primordial qi is not yet established, the five agencies not yet opened, light and scene not yet linked, boundless and voidless, without above or below, without outside or inside, without left or right, without front or rear; the Supreme Oneâ€™s primordial essence, the Mysterious Beginningâ€™s wondrous truth, prior to the extreme void, condensing qi and coagulating, mingling and transforming myriad things, Heaven and Earth preserved, all arise from these Four True Ones. Whoever with intention and heart preserves and thinks on them, for a thousand years shall not perish; within the Prenatal One, all spirits share longevity.
