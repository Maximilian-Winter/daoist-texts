Returning the Spirit, Flying to the Firmament, Ascending on High, and Summoning the Five Stars Method

The method of returning the spirit, feeding and drinking, summoning the five stars, and ascending on high: the upper movement reaches the seven mysteries; the lower resolves the myriad forms; mingling and harmonizing the myriad transformations; immediately establishing the profound order; bathing in orchid fragrance; entering the chamber with pure fasting; cultivating the prescribed method; the five viscera shine clearly; the seven orifices are bright; the spirit guards the scarlet palace; the form ascends the five dawns; this is the utmost wondrous method, not transmitted save to the true. That which is called the Way of the Dao is easy; the cultivation of the method is difficult. The Way which is difficult to cultivate, can it be otherwise than secret?

One should constantly on the days of Jiazi, Jiawu, Yiyou, Yimao, Jichou, Jiwei, Wuchen, and Wuxu, bathe and fast purely, enter the chamber, sit or lie at will, closing the eyes and resting the hands upon the heart, imagining and preserving the Eastern Azure Emperor, whose name is Tongming, style Gaiching; he wears a blue kerchief, blue robes, blue crown and blue shoes, girded with the shining pattern of Yang glow and rosy clouds, entering into my body. Also think of the four true ones within the liver, named the Azure Bright Lord, styled Minglun the Youth, who constantly guards my liver, watches the gate of my stomach tube, beneath the oily membranes, firmly sealing the path of deathly breath; for me he sends down azure essence, moon water, and jade fungus. Thereupon preserving the light essence of the planet Jupiter, drawing it by the mouth and swallowing it ninety times, so that the qi may be fully charged in the liver mansion. Practising thus for nine years, the Eastern Azure Waist Jade Maidens, nine in number, attend on either side.

Next think of the Southern Red Emperor, whose name is Taiyang, styled Huanlin; he wears a red kerchief, red robes, red crown and red shoes, girded with the pattern of four clear vermilion and turquoise; entering the corporeal form. Also think of the One Origin Dan Emperor of the Scarlet Palace, named Shen Yun Zhu, styled Zinan Dan; also called Sheng Shang Bo, another name Shi Yun Ju; who constantly guards my Scarlet Palace, watches the gate of my nape and head bones, cutting off the path of deathly breath; for me he sends down cinnabar essence, red water, and jade fungus. Thereupon preserving the light essence of the planet Mars, drawing it by the mouth and swallowing it eighty times, so that the red qi may be fully diffused in the Scarlet Palace. Practising thus for nine years, the Southern Red Jade Maidens, eight in number, attend on either side.

Next think of the Western White Emperor, named Tongyin, styled Yuanqi; he wears a white kerchief, white robes, white crown and white shoes, girded with the pattern of bright spirit and supporting hope; entering the corporeal form. Also think of the six true ones within the lungs, named Upper Pure Lord, styled Liang Nanzhong Youth, who constantly guards my lungs, watches the twelve gates, cutting off the path of deathly breath; for me he sends down pure fungus, moon water, jade essence cinnabar. Thereupon preserving the light essence of the planet Venus, drawing it by the mouth and swallowing it sixty times, so that star qi may be diffused and fill the lungs. Practising thus for nine years, the Great Pure Jade Maidens, six in number, attend on either side.

Next think of the Northern Black Emperor, named Tongshen, styled Zigui; he wears a dark kerchief, black robes, dark crown and dark shoes, girded with the pattern of abundant truth, flute, and phoenix; entering the corporeal form. Also think of the seven true lords within the kidneys, named Xuanyang Lord, styled Mingguang Master, who constantly guards my two kidneys, watches the gate of my back bones and earth gate, sealing and blocking the path of deathly breath; for me he sends down profound yin cinnabar fungus and nine liquid waters. Thereupon preserving the light essence of the planet Saturn, drawing it by the mouth and swallowing it fifty times, so that star qi may fill and diffuse within the two kidneys. Practising thus for nine years, the Great Profound Jade Maidens, five in number, attend on either side.

Next think of the Central Yellow Emperor, named Wanfú, styled Taicang; he wears a yellow kerchief, yellow robes, yellow crown and yellow shoes, girded with the pattern of middle origin, eight poles, and jade gate; entering the corporeal form. Also think of the five true lords within the spleen, named Yangguang Lord, styled Taichangzi, who constantly guards my spleen, watches the door of my root and base, sealing and blocking the path of deathly breath; for me he brings yellow water, moon radiance, jade fetus, cinnabar fungus. Thereupon preserving the light essence of the central guarding star, drawing it by the mouth and swallowing it twelve times, so that qi may fill the spleen. Practising thus for nine years, the Yellow Pure Jade Maidens, twelve in number, attend on either side.

Next think of the Supreme Mysterious Origin Father Lord, named Gaotongsheng, styled Zuo Huiming; and the Lower Origin Mysterious Mother, named Shuhuo Wang, styled You Huiguang. These two spirits guard the root of my original destiny, sealing the source of deathly breath; for me they bring yang cinnabar and yin essence, feeding and nurturing my body. Preserving the light of sun and moon, shining upon one form, drawing the colour of light by the mouth and swallowing thirty-six times, so that luminous qi may fill and overflow the palace of the cinnabar field beneath the navel. Practising thus for nine years, the face grows golden in aspect, eyes have streaming light, commanding the six jia, summoning and controlling the six dings, as desired.

The perfected man proceeds to the chamber and contemplates the five emperors and two luminaries, the true spirits; when the affairs are completed, he utters this prayer:

"The five stars encircle and link, their radiance flowing and shining within; the two luminaries fly as rosy clouds, irrigating the five essences; true spirits guard the treasures, preserving long the yellow tranquillity. The Great One of Great Brightness applies his intentions; transforming the fetus and returning the infant; the liver and lungs conjoin in blossom; the heart and kidneys glow fully; the spleen preserves the middle origin; the five fungi are born; the sun and moon’s precious light; merging with the emperors; flying on high soaring to the Jade Pure;"

When the cultivation of returning the spirit, feeding, summoning the five stars, and flying on high is complete, one practises for nine years, preserving prayers unbroken, true spirit inwardly reflected, the Three Origins come to the chamber, cutting off deathly breath in the nine chambers, crossing over to birth registers in the Southern Palace, receiving the profound instruction of the five spirits, swallowing the two luminaries to endure long, the five viscera conjoin in blossom and do not perish, soul and spirit are preserved and guarded, prolonging life.

## The Superior Method of Spirit-Calming and Life-Nourishing Internal Contemplation for Flying Immortals

The Heavenly Emperor of the Great Microcosm calms the spirit, contemplates internally, resolves the fetal knots, stabilizes the soul and condenses the spirit, mingling and transforming the mysterious truth; opening the six palaces, the five sense organs receiving the spirit; swallowing the breath and contemplating the true; fragrant fungi spontaneously born; stomach tubes conjoin and link; spirit pure and the body clear; the jade chariot stands ready; ascending in the white sun at dawn.

One should constantly bathe and fast purely, burn incense and enter the chamber, clear the mind, abandon burdens and cast away dust; be bright and unblocked, fix the thoughts without slumber; then the true form can be seen, the roaming spirit can return. Always at dawn, facing east, sitting upright, closing the eyes, inwardly preserving the form, shining clearly; calling on the correct name to return and guard the original palace; knocking the teeth thirty-six times to open. Then preserve and manifest the divine names:

- The brain spirit named Jinggen, styled Ninian, length two inches one fen;
- The brain spirit named Jinggen, styled Ninian, length one inch one fen;
- The eye spirit named Mingshang, styled Yingxuan, length three inches;

- The tongue spirit named Tongming, styled Zhenglun, length seven inches;
- The teeth spirit named Yaofeng, styled Luoqian, length one inch five fen.

The seven spirits of the face are arrayed, all dressed in flying gauze skirts, in the form of infants. Preserving them carefully, arranged upon one face, each guarding its palace. When finished, knock the teeth twenty-four times, swallow the breath twelve times, and recite the incantation:

"Spirit sources scatter breath, conjoining breath to become spirit, distinguishing before and after; presiding over the Ninian; supporting one another above and below; the seven spirits displayed; flowing forms escape and transform; loving to nourish the splendid origin; guiding the eight spirits; ascending through the cavern gate; guarding the body and seizing the light; ascending to the Emperor’s morning."

When ended, next think of the heart spirit named Danyuan, styled Shouling, length nine inches; the lung spirit named Haohua, styled Xucheng, length eight inches; the liver spirit named Longyan, styled Hechangming, length seven inches; the kidney spirit named Xuanming, styled Yuying, length three inches six fen; the spleen spirit named Changzai, styled Huntíng, length seven inches three fen; the gall bladder spirit named Longyao, styled Weiming, length three inches six fen. These six palaces’ true spirits, all dressed in cinnabar brocade flying skirts, dwell within the five viscera, the six palaces, each in the form of an infant, their colour like splendid children. Preserve them carefully, array their forms from morning to evening, not forgetting in thought; knock the teeth twenty-four times, swallow breath twelve times, and utter the prayer:

"The five viscera and six bowels, true spirits all return; presiding over the Scarlet Palace, mutually accompanying; the golden chamber, red youths; facing the four gates; the secluded chamber, mysterious palace; spirit halls and linkage machines; mingling and transforming to generate spirit; true breath and essence subtle; preserving and refining the cinnabar field; shining as brightly as the sun; obtaining union with the eight luminaries; conjoining form and ascending to fly."

When ended, next think of the three true essences of the blood and vital essence, named Yuansheng Lord, styled Huangningzi, who constantly guards the source beneath my two orifices; the two true ones of bone and joints, named Jianyu Lord, styled Ningyuzhu, guarding my Tai Cang palace and the orifice of the five intestines; the one true within the heart, named Heavenly Essence Jin Ye Lord, styled Feisheng Shangying, guarding the four extremities’ orifices in my chest; the nine origins’ true male, named Ju Zhi, styled Sanyang, guarding the left ear’s morning gate; the sovereign one soul maiden, named Shanggui, styled Dizǐ, guarding the right ear’s morning gate; the purple pure left origin lord, named Yiyu Wuren, styled Anlaishang, guarding the head and face border; the yellow pure middle origin lord, named Yuanhua Huangren, styled Taizhangshang, guarding the chest and abdomen border; the white pure right origin lord, named Qiming Xiaoren, styled Jinmenshang, guarding the lower gate border; the mid-day life director, named Jiesheng, guarding my left hand center; the mid-month peach lord, named Fangying, guarding my right hand; the one origin white qi lord within the fetus, named Wuxuanzi, styled Yushangsheng; the Supreme One Essence Soul, named Xuanguizi, styled Shengchang, two spirits guarding the upper conjoining above the five viscera, the root of the throat; the conjoining blue qi lord, named Anyanchang, styled Heheying; the origin lord essence soul, named Baogutong, styled Mingfu, two spirits guarding under the five viscera, above the great stomach; the joint black qi lord, named Binlaisheng, styled Jingshangmen; imperial true essence soul, named Youtaisheng, styled Guanshangsheng, two spirits guarding the orifice of my nine intestines, beneath the source; the yellow qi lord within the womb, named Zumingche, styled Shenwuji; the Heavenly Emperor essence soul, named Li Weicang, styled Fazhu, two spirits guarding within my lower abdomen, the root of the two orifices; the red qi lord within the blood, named Hunlizi, styled Shubaojian; the life director essence soul, named Fa Niuzi, styled Qingxuan, two spirits guarding my hundred gates and blood junctions beneath; the Supreme Mysterious Origin Father Lord, named Gaotongsheng, styled Zuo Huiming; the Lower Origin Mysterious Mother, named Shuhuo Wang, styled You Huiguang; the Imperial August Supreme One, named Chongmingkong, styled Youliaowu; the nine honored emperors, named Mingzhen, styled Zhongdi Sheng; the Supreme Emperor essence soul, named Youyang Tangyu, styled Baling; the nine gate souls, named Lühuidao, styled Jueming; the Heavenly Chronicle emperor soul, named Zhaowua, styled Guangshen; seven spirits guard the root of my original destiny, sealing the gate of death’s path. With prayer preserved, all true spirits from head to navel, none not bright; then cause golden liquid to flow round, jade radiance to shine on the soul, spirit overflowing to the utmost intestines, imperial qi filling the nine gates; the seven ancestors spread and dispel within the three apprentices, receiving the renewal of the fetus in the Southern Palace; guarding the living spirit in the one body, diffusing true qi to consolidate the years. When finished, knock the teeth thirty-nine times, and pray:

"Qi born from nothing, conjoins qi to spirit; yang qi fixed without, yin qi formed within; the two images entwined and interwoven, conjoining the original spirit; inner truth guards and defends; the nine orifices receive life; preserving soul and stabilizing spirit; myriad spirits rest in peace; guarding my three gates; splendid fungi fill and overflow; ascending with me; together ascending to Jade Pure."

When ended, swallow the breath thirty-nine times. To guard the thirty-nine chambers, the qi moistens, flows, and diffuses throughout the whole body. If one can abandon burdens, not cling to worldly dust, calm the heart and unify the mind, gaze clearly upon the empty chamber, glance inwardly and observe; calm the spirit and stabilize the soul; cut off deathly breath in the nine chambers; guard the living palace in the upper gates; circulate and preserve prayer, as if speaking face to face; day and night for three years, true spirits manifest form; brilliant radiance returns to root; decayed teeth grow anew; the five viscera conjoin and link; internally replenish and fill; command and summon the six jia; drive and urge the six dings; the chamber receives the guests of the Nine Skies; spirits descend the three pure palanquins; spirits fly and forms rise; ascending in the white sun at dawn.

The above are the names of the true divine treasures of the Upper Truth, which dwell within the human body, move with the qi of the nine heavens, and strengthen the mechanisms of the six palaces. The myriad essences transform and generate all by virtue of the spirit; when the spirit guards, then life is; when the spirit departs, then death is. With diligent heart and accumulated feeling, one may raise the human form and ascend to the mysterious palace. To seek the way of immortality without knowing the internal names of form and spirit, and without knowing to seal the gates of death, how can life be hoped for? Those who cultivate this Way must not wear soiled shoes, nor eat the five pungent spices, wine, or meat; nor touch or offend the correct qi, lest the spirit depart. Men know the delicacies that please the mouth, the emoluments that honour the person, yet they do not desire the food that is sweet to the mouth, which is the axe that wounds life; the emoluments and splendour are the source that consumes the true. Hence the spiritual man loves solitude and quietude, not dwelling in the body, not revealing form in the common dust. Those who cultivate life should be cautious indeed.
