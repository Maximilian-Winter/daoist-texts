# The Inner Canon of the Supreme Clarity of the Perfected of Cavernous Truth

The title of the canon: The Inner Canon of the Supreme Clarity of the Perfected of Cavernous Truth. The compiler is unknown, roughly dating from the Southern and Northern Dynasties or the Sui and Tang periods. It is falsely ascribed to the Heavenly King of Primordial Beginning commanding the Supreme Dao Sovereign to record, reciting the true names and talismanic methods of the Perfected of the Nine Heavens. One scroll. The original source: The Orthodox Daoist Canon, Zhengyi Section.

The Inner Canon of the Supreme Clarity of the Perfected of Cavernous Truth

The Supreme Clarity High Perfected Primordial Heavenly King, at that time with the Five Elders Supreme Emperors, the Nine Heavens True Kings, the Great Saints of the Ten Directions, and the Lords of Infinite Supreme Truth, together in the world of Red Brightness, in the Ling-she (Mansion), sitting in the incense garden, beneath the long mulberry tree. The Heavenly King returned his chariot, and the Heavens lowered their seats. At that time the clouds and mists were dense and abundant, the four scenes were dark and united, the nine days and nine nights, the profound Yin did not disperse, Heaven and Earth had no light, as it was before the Dragon River, dim and obscure. The Five Elders Supreme Perfected advanced and made obeisance, addressing the Heavenly Venerable: 'Today at the seat of attendance, such a time has never before been experienced; the Heavenly Venerable goes forth, all the Heavens incline their vehicles, the Supreme Emperors and High Perfected Ones, the spirits and jade maidens, the sun, moon, stars, the Polar Star and Jade Balance, the officers of the three realms, the mountain gods of the Five Peaks, the river and sea water emperors, all the spirits without exception are alert and solemn, guarding the Celestial Perfected. At this time the sky is bright and the air clear, the wind does not shake the boughs, the earth has no flying dust, the rivers and seas are quiet and silent, the mountains are veiled with smoke; the harmony of the season and the qi is settled, making life and death rejoice together; yet closing the heavenly light, the white day is dark, Heaven and men are alarmed, the four quarters are disturbed, uncertain for what reason; such is the cause. We pray that you will graciously bestow instruction, so that the multitude may see clearly, be richly benefited, and universally attain safety.'

The Heavenly King Supreme Perfected Primordial Heavenly Venerable declared: 'Today at this assembly, the joy is hard to meet; Heaven sends auspicious responses, naturally the jade characters and golden writings shine resplendent, obstructing the heavenly light, the beginning of ignorance, making it as dark as the day. The conjunction of day and auspicious time is rarely met. Now I shall open to the four hosts the miraculous truth of Heaven, the true names and titles of the Nine Heavens, to deliver those who respond to the Supreme Perfected and obtain the body of the Way. All are to fix their single mind on the true, close their eyes and bow upon the ground.' Thereupon the great saints and high immortals, the multitude of Perfected from the ten directions, innumerable as sand grains, all simultaneously prostrated to hear the commands. In a brief moment, the heavenly qi cleared away, the darkness was dispelled, the five-coloured radiance penetrated the ten directions. Suddenly a heavenly book arose spontaneously in the void, the characters one zhang square, naturally appearing above the void, within the mysterious emptiness in the midst of five-coloured light, the script brilliant and resplendent, with eight-cornered rays hanging down, the essence-light dazzled the eyes, impossible to behold. The Primordial Heavenly Venerable universally proclaimed to the assembly of the ten directions and infinite multitude: 'This is the spiritual book of the true names of the Nine Heavens, the qi of harmony, born of emptiness and nature, the obscure profundities spoken of in the Nine Heavens, hard to seek and examine. Formerly I entrusted the Perfected with the secret formulas, hidden in the golden palace of the cavernous chamber; now I reveal them to you, that you may obtain the body united with the Supreme Perfected and the Dao, not merely by morning or evening. Be clear and cautious, keep silence, cultivate and practice accordingly.'

The Primordial Heavenly Venerable instructed the Supreme Dao Sovereign: 'The marvelous Way should be clarified, so that you may write and explain its correct pronunciation, that the imperial Way may be promptly made smooth, its grace extend to the ten directions, traversing the eight extremes and six harmonies, and beyond the six harmonies, there shall be manifestations of spiritual auspiciousness and fortunate transformations, those with ancient karmic affinities united in truth. It is fitting to inform the Upper Immortals and address the Heavenly Venerable.' The Primordial Heavenly King said: 'I always follow the spreading waves, riding the wind and raising banners, according to the turning wheel of destiny. For countless kalpas I have repeatedly served at the seat, instructing all. Before this day it was not as now, meeting the holy Way, opening all the gates of the Law, seeing the heavenly book, the naturally supreme truth, the corresponding forms of body and countenance, harmonizing the five harmonious sounds, which cannot be thoroughly comprehended by ignorant and shallow thought. Now I am seated here, looking up with joy to the mystery, daring not to conceal my feelings, I shall follow the model, traverse the eight extremes and six harmonies inside and out, according to what I see recorded in the book, hoping that among myriad beings there may be one accord. Bowing and receiving the command, I compose a hymn as follows:'

'Primordial Beginning unfolds the great abundance, the resplendent heavens shine bright. Marvelous indeed is the Dragon River Way, the eight meetings concluded in a canon. Radiant and flying within the void, the flowing light fills the courts of the three realms. The spirits and perfected open the spiritual assembly, the jade characters respond to the auspicious time and arise. The heavenly perfected communicate the marvelous purpose, the five harmonies compose the chapters. Clear and bright the jade tones sound, drifting and gathering the Supreme Clarity. Opening the path without beginning or end, the nine abyss receive the brightness. Lofty is the great door of the Law, instructing all living things. This merit is beyond measure, joyful celebration for myriad years.'

The above Supreme Clarity Purple Plain Primordial Lord Supreme True composed the true text, as a palindrome. The Most High Primordial Lord by this true text delivers those in the thirty-two heavens, in the Purple Micro Upper Palace, where the Mysterious Named Imperial Records reside, to supplement those who become Upper Immortals; not transmitting to middle immortals, nor permitting terrestrial immortals to hear or participate. Without countless kalpas of planted blessings, blessings flowing to this body, they shall never behold it. If any obtain it, they shall attain Upper Immortality, their bones and flesh both flying. This is a true essential formula, transmitted by the Supreme Clarity Purple Platform Mysterious Gate where the Golden Name Jade Records reside; those who receive the text but do not study it must become immortals by themselves. It is also called the Supreme True Yin-Yang Spirit Talisman, and also the Nine Stream True Book. This true formula excludes all and removes all. To learn the Way of the Upper Immortals, one must receive and bear it; do not rashly reveal it to others, for there is the test of the Wind Blade; all according to the clear regulations of the Four Extremes.
