Transmission of the Purple Register of the Supreme Taoist of the Cavern of Truth

The Supreme True Elder wore it and handed down the text to the First Master. Also named the Secret Instructions of the Five Concealments, Six Mysteries, and Three Nines, One Correct and One Secret Scripture.

The Most High Pure and Exalted Great Sage, Mysterious Spirit, the Unoriginated Heavenly Venerable, together with the Five Elders Supreme Emperors and innumerable Saints who have attained the Tao from all directions, convened in the northeast, at the Beginning Blue Heaven, in the Great Country of Fuli, upon the Mountain of the Jade Capital, within the Palace of Clear Countenance of the Seven Treasures and Fine Jade Forest. Heavenly music arranged in ranks, fragrance and flowers in profusion, wondrous beings and Qiongqi, extraordinary birds and beasts, all assembled in a grand spectacle beyond description. The Heavenly Venerable smiled with cordiality, and all were joyful.

Then the Supreme Taoist Lord mounted the Wheel of Naturalness, attended by the Infinite True Saints, Immortal Boys and Jade Maidens beyond reckoning, sent forth from the Mysterious Capital to the Heavenly Venerable. After the rites were performed, they respectfully made their address. The Heavenly Venerable laughed joyously, and the assembly rejoiced. Yet the cause was not fully understood, and the Mysterious Reward was manifest.

The Heavenly Venerable bade them take their seats and discoursed on the clear and subtle, with speech and laughter exceeding in gladness. All chanted in praise, rare indeed, yet none made requests.

At that time the Primordial Heavenly King rose from his seat, knelt long, and addressed the Heavenly Venerable: “The Supreme Taoist Lord has accumulated merits and virtues through countless kalpas, so that his divine marvels are vast and profound. To hold this assembly today is joy rare to behold. His thoughts are deep beyond measure, compassionate towards myriad beings. He wishes to speak but has none to whom; he desires to teach but none able to receive. On this great day of rejoicing, I dare to inquire: by what Tao may one broadly benefit? By what method may joy endure?”

The Heavenly Venerable answered: “Excellent! Excellent! What a great question! I possess a subtle Tao that cannot be exhausted, a profound and mysterious essence beyond words. Its depth and subtle secrets you have briefly grasped. Now I reveal the Five Concealments, Six Mysteries, Three Nines, One Correct and Secret Instructions, conferring them upon the Supreme Taoist Lord, so that together you may illuminate the path, save and guide all beings, and cause them to attain the Way of Everlasting Abiding and Eternal Joy.”

Then the Primordial Heavenly King and the Supreme Taoist Lord, along with countless holy true ones and all the assembly, joyfully obeyed the mandate, performed their rites, and departed. The Supreme Taoist Lord and the Primordial Heavenly King returned together to the Palace of Great Abundance, feasting in the Pavilion of Marvels, where violet clouds condensed, seven treasures surged, vermilion clouds spread, arranged on terraces, myriad flowers gleamed brilliantly, illuminating the Jade Void and shining through all the heavens. Fragrance filled the ten directions, radiant and resplendent beyond description.

Then they gathered the Infinite Spiritual Deities, the Utmost True Great Spirits, the assembly of Immortals and numerous Saints, struck cloud bells, played heavenly chimes, entertained with lions, rode pure unicorns, danced the white cranes gracefully, soared with vermilion phoenixes, resounded the eight-tone music, shone with nine colours, played flutes, bells, and drums, a thousand wonders and myriad performances, with myriad voices and faces singing the clear and subtle. Heaven gods, men, and ghosts, even creeping things, all responded with joy.

At that time the Great Deity who attained the Tao, called the White Jade Queen Mother, rode in a nine-canopy splendid carriage, attended by many true ones as guards, cloud dragons winged her path, Immortal Boys led before, Jade Maidens formed the rear. Parasol flowers crossed on the left, banners and incense on the right, dancers made music, reverently they approached the Taoist Lord, kowtowed and reported. Then she inquired: “I have heard that the Primordial Heavenly Venerable told the Primordial Heavenly King that the Six Mysterious Secret Instructions would be delivered to the Taoist Lord. May this secret be heard?” The Taoist Lord answered: “The Heavenly Venerable’s secret instructions have been kept for countless kalpas, revealed only to the rare true sages, and so are not proclaimed openly.” The Queen Mother now asked: “If one wishes to verify these, may I hear them? You may ask the Unoriginated Heavenly King.”

Thus the Queen Mother descended her seat, prostrated on the ground, and implored the King: “The Heavenly Venerable’s secret instructions, taught by the Supreme, I humbly request to hear them.” The King said: “This instruction is subtle and wondrous, inconceivable. Those with refined mind and will can naturally apprehend it. The most true oral transmission and essentials flow and spread. The walking dead of dust kalpas do not encounter it; those who encounter it attain longevity, communion with spirit, union with the Tao, infinite transformations, everlasting joy without end. Those who do not encounter it are mere wheel infants, suffering in vain, how lamentable! Since the Mother is compassionate towards all and aims at broad salvation, your merits accord with the Heavenly Venerable’s covenant. How can you neglect to consider practising the secret? I desire you return to your seat and speak briefly on it; the Queen Mother’s divine brightness will surely elucidate it.”

“I once heard the Heavenly Venerable say to the Taoist Lord: ‘Neither Heaven nor Earth, neither Yin nor Yang, neither Sun nor Moon, neither soft nor hard, neither non-being nor being, subtle and secret without divulgence; this is the essential point of the wondrous instructions. Will the Mother interpret it?’” The Queen Mother pondered long, then looked up and answered: “Neither Heaven nor Earth denotes the supreme mingling of the Primordial; neither Yin nor Yang denotes the mysterious passage of the central palace; neither Sun nor Moon denotes the two halves forming one; neither soft nor hard denotes the meeting of mountains and rivers; neither being nor non-being denotes the utmost transformations of five and nine without end; subtle and secret without divulgence denotes the silent and cautious cultivation, not to be rashly transmitted.”

The King said: “It is so; the Mother comprehends it. The Heavenly Venerable’s great compassion extends to all; how could he withhold these secret instructions without transmitting them? But men are many and false, uncomprehending of supreme principle, their roots of sin and obstruction deep; true and false confused; if they hear the subtle, they cast blame, treat it lightly and unbelievingly, falling to evil paths, enduring wind blades and bitter poison, unable to escape through kalpas. The Heavenly Venerable’s great compassion is boundless, thus hides the wondrous instructions awaiting true sages. The true sages are rare indeed, throughout the ages few have heard of this. Various grades cannot be without teaching; therefore I broadly explain my causes, with rules, dignity, prohibitions, and precepts, various analogies created as occasion demands, the lineage divided and extended, not to be fully recorded here. I hope to give a rough entrance into the subtle so that at length you may meet this instruction. This instruction is subtle and wondrous, the root of all principles. Therefore the Five Elder Emperors, the Thirty-two Heavens and ten thousand Saints all revere it. When there is no speech, this Tao lies hidden; when speech arises, this instruction is foremost, highest and incomparable, highly esteemed by the Heavenly Venerable, treasured by the sages; only this one instruction, while other scriptures, though weighty, are secondary to it. Through countless kalpas of diligent study, refinement without ceasing, merits and virtues revolve as a wheel, one shall meet it. Those not destined to attain the Tao never meet it; those not attaining the Tao cannot know whom to transmit it to. Now the Queen Mother embodies the Tao and harmonises with Spirit, penetrating and comprehending all, examining being and non-being, exhausting principle and nature, comprehending all persons and things, discerning great and small alike. She rescues all, distinguishes truth from falsehood, rewards good and warns evil, liberates without hindrance. To understand this instruction is great merit indeed, majestic and venerable beyond words. Yet this instruction is the utmost teaching of the Heavenly Venerable embracing all subtleties; all nurture and teaching depend on this alone. It may be clearly transmitted to worthy and superior men; do not reveal it to the middling or lowly.”

The Queen Mother said: “By the Heavenly Venerable’s secret instructions, the Six Perfections are to be practised in four grades, enduring through kalpas without end. I speak to thank and repay the grace, earnestly exerting heart and caution, only following the commands of the instruction.” The King said: “Respectful indeed, proceed without end.”

Then the Queen Mother addressed the Taoist Lord: “In countless kalpas have those with affinity met this instruction, thereby converting and saving all, with blessings and felicity immeasurable. I only fear that true sages are rare and to be lamented. From now on, if great-minded superior men deeply delight in this Tao, renounce wealth and body, entrust their fate to receive the secret instruction, regardless of number or kalpa, if auspicious times and clear mornings appear, let them fast and transmit it. Is this feasible?”

The Taoist Lord answered: “Far from light matter, far from light matter. Select carefully those who accord with the Mother’s mind; as you say, it may be granted, but the principle must not be forgotten. Words must not cease; severity and reverence are appropriate; pledge to be cautious and secret; diligently cultivate silence and caution; be sensitive to numbers and fate until one attains the true Tao.” The Queen Mother kowtowed, accepted the command, then returned to the Jade Gate of the Turtle Mountain, residing in the Green Jade Palace, in the vermilion and purple chamber, with pearl and jewel canopies, Immortal Boys and Jade Maidens, myriad wondrous musicians and attendants, various guards, all pure and clear.

At that time the True Youth of Great Harmony and the Jade Maiden of Great Mystery waited on the banquet music, observing the Mother’s tranquility, carefully restraining mind and body, fasting and purity through the day, mutually pledging vows, inward and outward complete, spending all possessions, combining to obtain the Three Districts of the Hall of Seven Treasures, jade beds, golden screens, pearl canopies five sets, nine sets of divine incense, ten perfect floral banners, one boy and one girl attendant each, one golden and jade dragon carriage each, hundreds of rare delicacies and sweets for a thousand days’ offerings, thousands of brocades and nets, ten thousand pounds of gold and purple and yellow, all borne upon jade tables, together performing before the Queen Mother. They prostrated and kowtowed, reporting: “By the kalpa of dust, we are fortunate to serve near, sincerely joyful and comforted, with gratitude endless.
