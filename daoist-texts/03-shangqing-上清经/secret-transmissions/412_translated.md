# The Scripture of the Essential Way of the Supreme Cavernous Truth and the Elixir Illumination

Title of the Scripture: The Scripture of the Essential Way of the Supreme Cavernous Truth and the Elixir Illumination. The compiler is unknown; it is roughly dated to the Southern and Northern Dynasties. It is said to be transmitted by Gu Xizi. The book recites the method of the "Curved Simple Formula, Words of the Jade Illumination, Inner Truth, and Golden Seal." One scroll. Original source: the Zhengyi section of the Daoist Canon.

The Scripture of the Essential Way of the Supreme Cavernous Truth and the Elixir Illumination

Master Tai Gu, the Yellow Boy Perfected, Gu Xizi transmitted it; I received it and follow it, establishing a sect within Mount Tai, standing apart from the Eight Arts of Hidden Earth, though the names are the same. The Eight Arts and their Eight Names are stored in the Jade Chest, sealed with a Golden Seal, attended by Jade Boys, guarded by Jade Girls, each numbering eight hundred. The Jade Morning was bestowed at the Nine Profundities; only after seven thousand years was it transmitted to me. This Elixir Illumination also bears two names: one is the Scripture of the Essential Way of the Supreme Elixir Illumination; the other is the Supreme Simple Three Origins Curved Simple Formula, Words of the Jade Illumination, Inner Truth, and Golden Seal, also called the Words of Joy and Sorrow—same name but differing in substance. Within the seven thousand years, it is permitted to hear three transmissions; within a hundred years, those who receive it likewise obtain three transmissions, giving to each two Jade Boys and two Jade Girls.

However, the Curved Simple Formula, Words of the Jade Illumination, Inner Truth, and Golden Seal is indeed the supreme chapter of the Void Emperor Lord, the treasured words of the Supreme Simple Three Origins Lord. Smoke arises forming patterns, jade waves of emptiness and non-being, revolving truly in the cavernous mystery of curved discourse, the formulae and simplicity brightly shining in the golden chamber. Thus it can remove the Six Heavens at the origin of the Three Transformations, summon the Five Spirits in the seven revolutions, govern the single array of the threefold norm, whereby the spiritual immortals descend to rest; turning the seven transformations and the five rules, responding to summons without limit; reverence is paid to the Two Sovereigns in the secluded pavilion; the pure wisdom is shaken in the cold spirit. Thereupon the mountain and marsh spirits are examined and refined, the water sources lie concealed and extinguished; a thousand monsters are uniformly executed, nine demons fall and are lost, the five hundred are opened by the golden seal, summoning Feng Hua to the imperial seat. Then the Jade Splendour lodges to rest, the Five Elders chant together; divine troops bind the demons, evil smoke ceases its clamor, the Seven Ancestors are drawn forth from the Southern Palace, receiving their forms and embryos at dawn; they worship the Supreme in the Bud Palace, pay homage to the Supreme Simple in the Western Court, transcend the five ranks in the imperial chamber, exhaust the two principles without decay. Therefore this is the highest chapter of utmost truth, the place where demons are repelled. According to the regulations of the Four Extremes and the Bright Disciplines, in five hundred years it is permitted to hear a second transmission.

If one is often able to recite the Curved Simple Formula, Words within the Quiet Chamber, then the guests of the Five Elders attend the morning court, the daughters of Jade Splendour descend at evening; they guard the literary and military forces to suppress misfortune; the spirits of the source and marsh all come to worship him; the true spirits of the Five Mountains bow their heads before him. If one wishes to summon and employ spirits, one must perform the seven revolutions and five transformations. First, correct the heart and face northward, preserve ritual towards the Supreme Simple Three Origins Lord in the palace of Golden Splendour, then worship the Supreme Jade Morning Lord in the house of Seven Reflections. These two sovereign lords are jade-like, clear and bright; golden in form, shining among the spiritual herbs; their perfect light gathers in the splendid chamber, dazzling and shining keenly upon the Eight Profundities. When preservation is complete, knock the teeth twelve times, first read thrice the sacred Golden Truth blessing; then read the first high-grade fourth chapter; next the second chapter; next the sixth; next the third; next the fifth; next the seventh; the high and middle two grades together make fourteen chapters, all completed. Then fix the eyes and mind on the summoned object, and it will come according to will. Request the summoning of the spirits of the Five Mountains, also the officers of life, the officers of records, the three officials of the Northern Emperor, and command them to remove the registers of crime, inscribe the names of the living, cut off the smoke and breath of evil demons, close and block the root of the trial and observation. When the orders are finished, dispatch in due time, taking care not to detain them long. Within a month, this Way may be practiced thrice. If one only wishes to drive away misfortune and suppress demons, one must not proceed after mere fasting and purification. One should first read the middle-grade third chapter; next the high-grade second chapter; next the middle-grade seventh; next the middle-grade fourth; next the high-grade sixth; and then thrice read the Golden Truth spell. This is called the Way of the Five Transformations, to invoke and subdue demons and devils; but when done singly, no further ritual is preserved. If one wishes to atone for the sins of the Seven Ancestors, and draw forth the embryo palace in the imperial honoured presence, then one must first preserve the ritual as above, following the first high-grade chapter of the scripture in three successive cycles, each time reading once the Golden Truth blessing; within a single day perform three cycles up to five hundred times, and thus for one grade up to five hundred grades. Then the Seven Ancestors and fetal immortals, the diviner, ascend to the three heavens. When chanting the scripture, take care that no errors occur in the chapters or words; ten errors incur the penalty of one grade.

If one desires to undergo the great and excessive purification of grades, one must first fast three hundred days, bathe in five fragrant herbs, make the body clean and pure, utterly sever human affairs, be free from care and thought; then one may be permitted to proceed.

Whoever receives the method of the Curved Simple Formula, Words of the Jade Illumination must have thirty feet of cinnabar brocade and two pairs of golden bangles, as tokens of the emperor lord's mysterious truth. When the book is bestowed, one must fast seven days, bathe in five fragrances, avoid contact with people, and seek to induce response and inspiration. Only those truly capable may be transmitted the teaching; if transmitted to unworthy persons and the precious scripture is rashly divulged, then the Seven Ancestors and Grandparents will suffer tortures in the nether hell; can one not be cautious?

The Scripture of the Essential Way of the Supreme Cavernous Truth and the Elixir Illumination ends.
