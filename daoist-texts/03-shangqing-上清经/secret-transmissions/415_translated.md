The Supreme Cavernous Truth Returning to the Mysterious Chapter

The Supreme One unfolds the profound store,  
Brilliantly spreading the patterns of the True.  
Scattered and shining the heavenly treasures,  
Revered in all the ten directions.  
No beginning, nor end,  
Neither bright nor dim.  
Looking upward to ascend the Jade Capital Terrace,  
Carefree and resting on Kunlun.  
Crossing over the winding springs and rivers,  
The Demon King wishes to hear.  
Seven ancestors receiving transformation and birth,  
Resolving my resentments of former lives.  
Entering to control the flying mysterious light,  
Emerging to ride the floating purple clouds.

Double radiance shines the jade morning,  
The mysterious light opens the round brightness.  
Far off lies the cavernous truth palace,  
Glittering with the essence of seven treasures.  
One thought overcomes the eight difficulties,  
Long abiding with the Supreme One together.  
Spinning and offering the yellow radiance,  
The sun’s splendour born in the void midst.  
The world knows the mixed vulgar paths,  
But none has heard the Scripture of Wisdom and Benevolence.  
Great is the cavernous truth’s precept,  
Profoundly affecting the sincerity of the Demon King.  
Ten thousand years like a single breath,  
How can it depend on a thousand million ages?

The Supreme One’s essence is originally naught,  
Scattering forms to transcend weakness and loss.  
Diligently spreading the mysterious art,  
Heavenly Lords together praise and extol.  
Those with affinity manifest the text themselves,  
Not relying on scriptures to conceal.  
If one can obtain this Way,  
At once is born the primal light.  
The body crosses without need of ferry,  
Floating lightly to the immortal hall.

Non-being endless, non-being eternal;  
Being exists and safely enters the subtle.  
Heavenly feathers flourish beyond the highest,  
The mysterious school has its essential point.  
Turning the triple treasure wheel,  
The ten directions universally quake and shine.  
The Supreme One views the Jade Capital,  
The Demon King laughs in empty air.  
The Heavenly Emperor clasps hands and sings,  
All the truths ride the void and howl.  
Scattering flowers is my true thought,  
Eight vows naturally transcend.

The spirit-immortal rides the auspicious cloud,  
Driving dragons treading the mysterious waves.  
Harmonizing the truth to manifest good omen,  
Rising foot to the eight heavens’ heights.  
Blessings respond without my seeking,  
Therefore the Buddhist net is loosened.  
The Way attained crowns the three realms,  
The earthly cords are likewise surpassed.  
Touched by the cloud-true assembly,  
The Pure Wisdom Scripture, the lotus.

Supreme awakening of the four ranks,  
Boundless beyond the great expanse.  
Hidden and manifest surely have their cause;  
Without the hidden, darkness cannot be.  
Swiftly revolves the mysterious wheel,  
True immortals fortunate in splendid azure.  
At times wandering in the vast boundlessness,  
Heaven and men have no meeting limits.

Spirit subtle and wondrously proclaimed,  
Heaven and men have the ferry shore.  
Sailing a boat over the fathomless abyss,  
Always fearing the scattering storm-waves.  
Its affinity has wondrous power,  
Who can reckon the wisdom’s might?  
Slowly following the mysterious pivot,  
Clearly manifesting the obscure cause and effect.  
Eminent and acute answering the true child,  
The spirit zither sounds in empty air.  
Competing thoughts respectfully honour the ten directions,  
The mysterious lingers, I do not envy.

The Supreme One spreads the cavernous text,  
The worthy return to the primal affinity.  
Desolate are the triple treasure enclosures,  
Flourishing and splendid is my cause.  
Bo Shi and Ru Jing,  
Pure in quality, born the golden body.  
Ends and begins the kalpas anew,  
More keenly feeling the spirit’s face fresh.  
Rare is the crossing with reverence supreme,  
Treasure texts descend to the utmost truth.  
The Taoist forest luxuriates in the heavenly capital,  
Shining upon the immortals of all lands.  
Allowing the scattering spirit’s might,  
Vastly the great law is proclaimed.

The Supreme One views the ten directions,  
Dark and dense blending like phoenix and crane.  
Round light reflects the three stars,  
The true men don the heavenly robes.  
The Demon King stands with folded hands,  
At the market beside Fengjing.  
Sun and moon obscure the shining rays,  
Seven treasures blaze without limit.  
All who engage at this moment,  
Calamities cease and hells are at rest.  
Vast and floating the shadowless heaven,  
Venerable men no one can fathom.

The triple treasure flourishes in the ten directions,  
Diligent and pure in the empty air.  
Revolving following transformation’s principle,  
One perception raises the Dharma wheel.  
Dim and bright in the void,  
The four elements arise in time.  
Empty and existent, nothing is missing,  
Ghosts cluster on Mount H.  
The Supreme One has no lingering thought,  
Extinguishing thought returns to the great vehicle.

There are ten directions of Returning to the Mysterious Hymns,  
First the Northern, next the Northeast, East, Southeast,  
South, Southwest, West, Northwest, Above, and Below.  
One hymn and one worship each.  
The Returning to the Mysterious grade comes from nature and spontaneity,  
Standing empty for over nine thousand kalpas;  
Its text then appears.  
The Primordial Heavenly King bestowed the Way to the Supreme One;  
After the Way was accomplished, the Supreme One followed the Primordial King’s command to select it,  
To correspond with the Great Precepts.  
It is to be recited on one’s natal day,  
To explain the three hundred divisions of the precepts,  
And to chant this text.  
If at noon or midnight it is practiced,  
One first fasts and then proceeds on the Way.  
If the natal day is unknown, use the day of the sexagenary cycle.  
If after ten years, it may be practiced on the first day of the first month.
