The Golden True Chapters Sung at the Time of the Transmission of the Scriptures by the Perfected Ones of Shangqing

Residing in the Palace of the Supreme Morning Mist,  
The Golden Gate shines with violet clarity.  
The fasting gatekeepers reflect the Great Element,  
Four pavilions all composed of cinnabar and jade.

Casting the wheel at the hollow ford,  
Reining the bridle, dancing the green canopy.  
Jade blossoms fly as clouded canopies,  
Western consorts bear banners of brocade.

Suddenly beyond dust and filth,  
Swiftly at the fair courtyard of the Perfected Ones.  
From past responses the appointed time has come,  
What is gained already lies in the dark.

Riding the wind, I imagine the Ninth Heaven,  
Sweetly immersed in the cinnabar blossoms.  
Turning to thank the children of the world,  
How know they the spirit within the void?

Northward I ascend the Mysterious and Dark Gate,  
Hand in hand binding the high net.  
Fragrant smoke spreads over the eight scenes,  
The mysterious wind drums the crimson waves.

Looking up beyond the clear ford,  
Looking down upon the winding mountain recesses.  
Jade flutes sing above the clouds,  
Phoenix cries echo in the Nine Mists.

Riding the energy, roaming the Great Void,  
Why do I linger at the mountain recess?  
The golden tally commands the winged spirits,  
Leading troops to crush myriad demons.

Washing and drawing in the round morning light,  
The ancient tree now embraces its buds.  
In the midst of competing multitudes,  
Not understanding how to act rightly.

Northern ridges dense with heavenly mists,  
Crimson trees bear purple blossoms.  
Blue herbs fall in the phoenix forest,  
Jade cliffs flourish in the mountain recess.

The Spirit Gate soars beyond the Great Void,  
Jade chambers join the Supreme Morning Mist.  
Clouds rise within the winding chamber,  
Eight winds fly the dark sands.

Nine strings are plucked at the Emperor’s window,  
Dragon roars sing the rhythm and harmony.  
Fan winds sweep the Five Mountain peaks,  
Grasping the tally to march against myriad demons.

Looking round in a moment,  
Suddenly the ancient tree has passed.  
Alas for those born at dawn,  
How know they how many years they have?

At the corner of the rare forest palace,  
The spirit journeys through the silent wastes.  
Reaching the observatory shining on the six voids,  
Great and small all wander at ease.

Dragons blow, entwining the five clouds,  
Tigers roar, startling myriad branches.  
Three elements form the high picture,  
Cinnabar mists adorn the morning sky.

Feathered banners cross the spirit ford,  
Purple canopies fly with flower-like finery.  
Reining the bridle beyond the Ninth Heaven,  
Looking up and down with boundless ease.

Dust and mire form noise and uncleanness,  
Spirit lost, energy also withering.  
Why not seek the distant refuge?  
Eight thousand is but one morning.

In the morning crossing the blue sea waves,  
Flying wheels depart the green chamber.  
Loudly singing to old dark friends,  
Fanning the canopy beyond the vast ocean waves.

Three contracts with jade sky guests,  
Five appointments with Eastern Flower youths.  
Feathered winds rise to the imperial dawn,  
Feasting here in the vast Cold Palace.

Eight palaces struck in the void,  
Purple phoenixes sing the spirit wind.  
Crimson mists arrest the bright radiance,  
Eight scenes fly across the Great Void.

Chewing the jade spring ford,  
Vastly flourishing and returning to embrace the dark.  
Highest joy nurtures the five spirits,  
Years accumulate, calamities mount.

To slip off the sandals — how difficult!  
To bear the toil and lose the heavenly spirit.

Morning carriage at the dawn radiance,  
Loose reins launch the violet clarity.  
Floating wheels hasten the Supreme Morning Mist,  
Raising the canopy in the vast Cold Court.

The high Perfected stand in the Emperor’s chamber,  
Walls and palaces array the Western Spirits.  
Scholars cease and dance in the empty spaces,  
Flying smoke surrounds the brocade banners.

Tiger banners fan the divine wind,  
Auspicious clouds surround the dragon canopy.  
Swiftly looking to the eight directions,  
A glance, and the ancient tree has already toppled.

Rustling, the mysterious mirror child,  
Why not seek the Supreme Life?

The divine garden flourishes with hidden mushrooms,  
The Kun pool waters the jade fields.  
Looking up to the Jade Clarity Gate,  
Lofty and towering over the crimson ford.

Purple mists reflect the Emperor’s seat,  
Five clouds shine over the Nine Mysteries.  
Eight winds transcend the universe,  
Dark mists lie between the green pavilions.

Three origins lodge in the Western Palace,  
Eastern Flower holds a fair youth.  
In the Northern Ocean seven cries are sung,  
Bright maidens sing of the Southern Truth.

Playing the tambourine and tuning the vermilion strings,  
Jade tallies sound out the eight strings.  
In accord and at rest with the governing fate,  
Together resonating with the broad phoenix union.

At the appointed time, commanding myriad demons,  
Dwelling here with the assembled thousands.  
Transcending to come — how difficult?  
Beginning the endless years.

Harnessing the breath, looking to the empty spaces,  
Riding the radiance, resting in the Ninth Heaven.  
Dragon banners cluster in the broad light,  
Feathered canopies birth eight clouds.

Whirlwinds convey without tracks or obstacles,  
My horse has no ford.  
Grasping the tally, entering the Eastern Flower,  
Evening feast at the mysterious Lang peak.

Binding the belt, bringing five spirits,  
Loosening the collar, a fair person.  
Dark response flows at ease with fate,  
Silent also has its affinity.

Together bearing swift wings,  
One fan stirs millions and thousands.  
Crimson scenes float the mysterious morning,  
Purple pavilions ride the cloud procession.

Looking up beyond the Golden Gate,  
Looking down upon the Western Flower city.

Eastern mists open the five radiances,  
Divine origins shine with seven spirits.  
Shade and reflection mark the three lamps,  
Flowing duties arrange themselves in the dark.

The wind drums the empty void,  
Fragrant smoke disperses in the jade court.  
Hands hold the weaving maiden’s dance,  
Twin collars entwined with brocade blue.

Left turning, crossing feathered banners,  
Flowered canopies incline with the clouds.  
Feasting and resting beyond the nine measures,  
Right and wrong do not oppose me.

Embracing emptiness within the mud pellet,  
Heavenly form daily grows bright.  
How unlike the faults and pollutants,  
Mournful, dull, and burdensome life.

Supporting the green empty peak of Fusang,  
Vermilion clouds bloom faintly bright.  
Wave platforms rise above the sky’s void,  
Four observatories reflect the clear high.

Flying radiance reins the purple wheel,  
Three elements rein the cinnabar canopy.  
Reclining in the Great Emperor’s hall,  
Clamorous cries in the mother’s court.

Washing feet in the blue river waves,  
Lifting the jade nectar vial.  
At dawn’s curve riding the wind fan,  
Fluttering and drifting, now inclining downwards.

Temporarily dwelling in the collapsing mists,  
Turning carriage to the pure and good.  
Mysterious assembly binds itself,  
Wandering freely in the dark.

Only then knowing the bitterness of honor and disgrace,  
Only then perceiving the hastening of life.

The winding chamber may be pure and still,  
Nourishing truth awaiting the sincerity of the sun.  
Why teach the way of the marketplace?  
A hundred ailments arise from it.

Heaven’s court brings forth golden splendour,  
Within it guards against the shadow and evil.  
Jade valleys join the mysterious echoes,  
Jade vapours support each other in spiral.

Heavenly truth stands above the sun,  
Flying medicines emit the spirit sands.  
Perfect morning, the heavenly horse,  
Turning carriage to the mysterious divine home.

Immortals come to enter the chamber,  
Their writings destroy myriad demons.

The twelve right Golden True Chapters are all the secret names among myriad spirits, all hidden names of palace chambers. Those who recite them have all their hundred gates opened and enlightened, their ailments dispersed and destroyed. At the time of their transmission, all should sing them.
