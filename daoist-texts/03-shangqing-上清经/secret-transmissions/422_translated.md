The Supreme Clarity Cave Mystery Bright Lamp Superior Scripture

Now the Great Subtlety is penetrating and exquisite, illuminating the far and the hidden; it continues the mysterious radiance of the sun, and unfolds the precious chapter of the bright lamp. It begins with Nature itself, receiving the essence of the sun and moon's splendour, clear and bright, subtle and obscure; it scatters its light and illuminates the sky; there is no heaven that it does not pervade, no hidden place it does not shine upon, no boundary it does not transcend. Unless by the meeting of the mysterious excellence, and after seven generations of accumulated merit, this writing cannot be gazed upon. Those who encounter it are treasures and are encouraged thereby.

He who receives this Scripture must bear the oath of bright gold, blue and jade, and be conferred upon the sheer precipice. If he lacks sincere covenant, and has no particular conduct, then he is but a careless person; let him not rashly proclaim it. Whoever desires to receive it must first observe a fast, only allowing it to be transmitted upon signs of spirit and auspicious response.

The Most High Supreme Mystery Perfected Man ascended to the jade terrace of the nine heavens, bowed beneath the window and verandah, and humbly inquired of the Purple Palace Lord, opening the gates of ignorance to enlightenment. With elbow stepping and knee advancing, as the time passed by moments and hours, he then announced: What I have inquired is most wondrous. Now by illuminating the seven mysteries to decide good and evil, unfolding the precious chapter of ritual and recitation, I announce the meaning of the Scripture. Then ascending the severe heavenly regulations, truly the Long Quiet Rosy Clouds, elevating it by the steps, it is ever covered by the mysterious clouds, guarded by flying dragons, and heavenly soldiers and feathered riders without rest day and night. All decorated with lapis lazuli, pearls, and jade, shining and resplendent; unless he be of the highest truth, none can glance upon these palace walls. To study and taste the void mystery, to chew and digest the flying roots, to open and expound the precious chapter, nothing surpasses fasting and thanksgiving. None excels the Supreme Clarity Cave Mystery, burning incense and lighting lamps with ritual recitation. The lamp method is to space them apart by one zhang and five chi, placing ten lamps upon a pole, and orally proclaiming their meaning. The mysterious principle of the many lamps, arrayed like ceremonial order, is an expression of sincerity. The bright lamp is a symbol of the stars, next the seven ancestors, whose traces are subtle and hard to declare; cultivating it for three years, one ascends to heaven by day.

The method of lamp ritual begins facing the east, then west, then south, then north; then looking upward to heaven, the heart is preserved, and the ritual is performed at the centre, following the true text of the recitation.

Those who fast together sing praises; afterward arrange incense and fire with solemnity before them, so that the smoke does not cease. This method is widely extended, delivering from the sufferings of the dark night, pardoning the calamities of birth and death. The devout son who reverently believes, whose family lies stained by examination, sick and desiring to establish a fast to deliver himself, should offer pure incense and clarified oil, in weights and measures as each chooses, diligently cultivating and earnestly practising. Those who fall short must use the incense and oil brought by the master to pay the expenses of correction and punishment, to make amends for faults. The generation who cultivate the Way, though their days near and their hopes are swift, yet respond late; they say the Way is vast and extravagant — what fate has it? If the generation cannot transcend the border and the utmost heights, how can the seven ancestors descend blessings? Retreating they cannot prolong at home the comrades' fast and lectures, always flying wheels and swift competitions, delighting themselves with wine's noise; thus opposing the mysterious teaching above and falling below the ancestors' fullest measure. Slaughtering the three victims to show filial piety — alas, how grievous! It brings sorrow to my heart. As for fortune consumed and calamity excessive, they then blame the gods, spirits, and directions, praying in darkness; this is like digging a well when one is already thirsty — what avail is it? The dead infant suffers torment; calamities flow to later generations; to the children and grandchildren there is famine and disease, all owing to present failure to practise good deeds, abandoning transformation and yielding to thought, indulging in the poison that they themselves have invited. Foolish and wicked men, hearing the kind admonitions like a gentle wind crying to heaven, or like the flying cries of pheasant and goose, laugh like dogs; how lamentable it is, to be so given and yet unbelieving!

The generation who desire to prolong life and endure, to dispel calamity and cure sickness, to cultivate great virtue and arrive at the truth, to release the seven mysteries, should understand the Supreme Clarity's great precepts concerning the rewards and retributions of good and evil, combined with ritual recitation; then calamity and misfortune may be dispelled, and the luminous Han may be ascended.

The method of lamp ritual is simply to perform the rites and spells properly, especially to endure hardship and remove suffering — this is not forbidden.

The Most High Supreme Man said: When performing the Lamp King ceremony and the Lamp procession, the hymns are as follows:

Great indeed is the Seven Treasure Palace, naturally producing the lotus flower, shining brightly opening the night light, swiftly ascending the great rosy clouds.

Looking up to the mysterious true gate, the clouded towers rise lofty and steep; streaming radiance shines in the mysterious sky, summoning troops to conquer myriad demons.

Delivering from suffering, gathering amid hardship, accumulating kalpas yet in embryonic teeth; fasting and lecturing to save the seven ancestors, accumulating merit to enrich the household.

Most wondrous issuing divine radiance, formless, silent, without shadow; beyond the boundary and limit, suddenly universal salvation proceeds.

Raising and delivering the seven mysterious sufferings, vast and clear to behold the Long Quiet; delivering from the five difficult obstructions, responding with feeling to ascend on clouds.

The bright lamp penetrates the ten directions, in the dark lacquer all is illuminated. Resplendent is the hall of the Mysterious True, blazing and bright shining upon the ten directions.

Vastly open, clearing the closed and blocked, revealing and resolving all suffering bodies; the seven ancestors free the three tortures, no longer have worry or suffering.

Green canopy reflects the ten directions, flying and spreading through cloud and wave; the divine lamp brightens the nine darknesses, illuminating and embracing mountain recesses.

The Brahman body of the six meetings’ palace, generation after generation becoming immortal households; the empty smoke all lodging conditions, blessings descend dispersing myriad demons.

Suffering souls respond and scatter, ice departs from drifting sands. Accumulated calamities are unknown to cease — is it but a single day's fault?

The seven ancestors receive this calamity, ever dwelling between rivers and seas. The Most High truth contemplates this suffering, with a humble heart at the ninefold gates.

Bowing the head in worship before the mysterious lamp, crossing over to the Eastern Flower Palace.

When the Lamp King ritual is completed, then follows the nineteen hymns of the lamp procession, as follows:

A thousand truths bow to the jade gate, clearly penetrating the hollow void; looking upward to preserve the Unacted Honoured, flying rosy clouds playing amidst the clouds.

Pure and tranquil without obstruction or difficulty, the body produces seven treasure lights. I am the sea boat master, therefore I can release the three net.

Night light passes through secluded valleys, washing away and opening the suffering body; empty smoke disperses the eight extremes, shining brightly into the Great Subtlety.

Ritual recitation of the unsurpassed teaching, blessings and felicity truly majestic. Fluttering and falling, passing through, stillness fills the eight hills.

The Three Qin produce cloud shadows, void and without twin great origins; penetrating the utmost ten directions, roaming freely scattering suffering bodies.

The flying wheel envelops the great space, formless and without trace; letting the wheel fly wherever it will, sighing and surpassing beyond the boundary.

Clad in coarse cloth singing the night light, all the heavens surpass the great; guilt and fortune depend on none else, measure is free to your own person.

If merit is not early accumulated, morning and night establish fields of blessing; return and entrust to the Unacted Way, at end you shall see the true right.

Shining brilliant bright radiance, clearly penetrating without hiddenness; blazing beyond the utmost darkness, blessings descend, accumulated blessings increase.

The schools and academies observe the ten directions, universally saving all men. Guard my mysterious true reins, hand in hand holding the jade tally.

The bright lamp strikes the jade bell, responding with sound already perfect; in one day see the three reaches, releasing my accumulated worldly worries.

Advancing to the Seven Treasure officials, turning the wheel around curved mountain recesses; resting the carriage at the green canopy chamber, who knows how many years pass?

Rinsing and inhaling golden liquid essence, kalpas yet in embryonic volume; looking down on the contests of glory, unable to understand or restrain.

Mysterious radiance reflects the curved valley, clear and bright penetrating springs and fountains; freely illuminating flowing and dense interlacing, entwining and filling Feng mountain.

The seven ancestors return to fetal birth, Chang’an Five Colour Palace. Thick and luxuriant pavilions shine, flourishing bursting into the Great Purity.

Heavenly guards are left and right attendants, turning the wheel returning to the southern tilt; faint and distant beyond nine years, momentarily surmounting the stone to open the spirit.

The seven ancestors obtain fetal immortality, again receiving birth at the southern palace. The flying wheel envelops the empty cave, gazing upon a thousand fathoms.

Principles understood and harmonized in one sweep, gathering smoke to inhale and then disperse; the body light, the form without activity, four bright ones responding to the scene and shining.

The hells and three evil paths, all are freed from cages and bonds. Howling and singing on the nine mysterious terraces, lofty ridges condensed and desolate.

The mind's six senses are clear, self-abandoning dusty and polluted conditions; drifting clouds shine on the golden chamber, empty halls scatter mysterious radiance.

Accumulated feeling causes spiritual descent, the form alone yet the Way is also divided; swiftly gazing upon myriad kalpas, how can one perceive hundreds of thousands of years?

The elegant garden luxuriates on divine steps, vermilion and jade embroidered with glowing streams; winds drum the empty jade, perching shadows, the void phoenix cries.

Purple smoke entwines the curved eaves, red radiance encircles the green canopy. Flying banners adorn the mysterious canopy, feathered joints shine purple and clear.

Pure bright scenery at the nine heavens’ edge, roaming and playing at the phoenix city; turning back to see the competing glory children, one joy sharing morning and birth.

Reining in the reins controlling mysterious radiance, sunset clearing the wilds without; wandering seeking spiritual people, combining forms to celebrate the cloud’s edge.

Hands unveil the vermilion jade gate, bright as divine rushing peace. The golden gate towers lofty and steep, clear shadows without dust or filth.

Unfurling banners on the mysterious Lang platform, fitting my good wish to meet; delivering from the three tortures’ difficulties, preserving and refining firm old age.

Wisdom arises originally from nothing, bright and clear surpassing the ten directions; tied to emptiness standing in the mysterious sky, all heavens imbibe flowing fragrance.

Its mystery is hard to think upon or conceive; void feeling is truly indeed connected; being and non-being, not not being; non-being and non-non-being, all are contained.

Wisdom constantly observes the body, the study of the Way's first place; subtle and entering the mysterious market, naturally recording my spirit.

Heavenly Honours constantly protect, demon kings speak protection; dazzling diamond body, surpassing the highest immortals.

Wisdom produces the root of precepts, the true Way has precepts as lord; the three treasures arise from this, the venerable saints honour and confer.

Sailing this boat of immortality, swiftly crossing the great existence; when this teaching of precepts is spoken, all immortals come bowing.

The Great Subtlety Heavenly Emperor’s Recitation at Taking the Precepts

When seeing the bright lamp, all should recite this text, not only when taking precepts. Gently tap the teeth to pronounce it, not letting others hear the sound; all by mouth and teeth is all to the ear.

The Supreme One scatters to the ten directions, splendid lamps through sincere essence; all heavens are splendidly bright, all lands entirely luminous.

My body also shines bright, the five viscera produce splendid honour; fiery brightness shines on the Great Nothing, distant thoughts multiply clear jewels.

Red essence, wondrous Great Nothing; mysterious yang echoes in the void; containing form, eliminating roots of suffering; subtle and wondrous, arriving at true perception.

Drooping splendour does not display treasure; conditions do not shine with form; my body is likewise so, riding transformation entrusting flowing light.

Night light manifests yang cinnabar, far shining on the spirit chamber; all heavens universally light and manifest, all darkness then at once perishes.

My spirit also is intelligent and bright, always delighting in wisdom and understanding; roaming freely, fitting the Way's movement; changing and yielding to Heaven’s force.

Raising form, treading the empty cave, night lamp shining bright and gathering.

The Great Subtlety Heavenly Emperor said: To light lamps without knowing to recite this, the six heavens’ great demon palaces are but the fate of the dead; the eight directions’ heavens do not dispatch jade boys or jade girls; flying celestial beings do not descend upon the son; the ten directions and three realms do not cross over the generation’s name to the Eastern Flower Southern Palace; they do not accept the son’s seven ancestors’ parents’ Way of transformation and birth.

The Food Offering to All Beings Spell

Diligently cultivate the great Way method, sincerely touching the Great Darkness; truly descending, demons and evil spirits disperse; all monsters lose form.

The seven ancestors cross the Southern Palace; the generation’s body ascends to Supreme Clarity. Once blessed, nothing is not universal; the Dharma food is offered to all beings.
