## The Supreme Clear Mirror True Classic

Laozi said: The interior landscape of metal and water, issuing yin to produce yang, able to effect this Way, divides the body and scatters the form; making one into ten thousand, establishing the six armies. Beyond a hundred billion li, breathing comes and goes, riding on clouds and treading on water, entering and exiting without hindrance. The celestial spirits and terrestrial deities, the evil ghosts and aged spectres, and all concealed kinds, are all visible. When one carefully contemplates with essence and thought, and contrary visions come from the directions, if you can guard them, you become an immortal king.

Laozi said: If you desire to practise the bright mirror, do not enter the house of mourning or where women are nursing infants. Wear pure garments scented with incense, bathe with five fragrant herbs, and drink the liquid of orchid and cinnamon. Do not eat pungent or spicy things, absolutely reject fishy and hot foods, avoid women; in a quiet and secluded place, a chamber remote from noise, where no sound of carriage or horses, no noise of drums or metal, no clamour of birds or beasts is heard, then you may begin. The greatest taboo in this Way is fright; once gone, there is no return; once broken, there is no repair. At that time, the mind must desire no further possessions; the ear must desire no further sounds. Fix the heart and steady the eyes, as if in contemplation; with utmost essence steadfast and unwearied, then it may again be accomplished.

Laozi said: When obtaining the bright mirror, it should be nine cun in diameter; the face must not have any partial defect, damage, flaw, or blemish. Endeavour to have it clear, bright, complete, not losing the human countenance and colour, that is good. In old times, my former master took a mirror of twelve cun, placing one on each of front, back, left, and right, called the Four Rules. Those who practise this Way find it very difficult to rapidly complete or easily obtain. If frightened, great calamity follows; it is for the few who have capacity. Wen Zi and Hao Cheng each used a single mirror of one chi, placed directly before them, also for seeing spirits, yet they could not achieve long life.

Laozi said: Use a nine-cun mirror on each side, called the Sun and Moon, also to extend life. If you wish to divide the body and scatter the form, sitting or standing in deathlessness, ascending the Yellow Court, attaining long life and immortality, commanding a hundred spirits, entering water, fire, metal, stone, wood, and earth, flying and moving at will, then you must use the Way of my Four Rules. If you only desire to know fortune and misfortune in reverse, the Sun and Moon suffice.

Laozi said: The method of setting the rules is to measure one chi five cun from yourself, aligning with the eyebrows, each suspending a purple-green thread, below which is flower water, carefully making it level. Do not close the eyes day or night for effect. The reason not to close the eyes is fear that at the moment of closing, the spirit suddenly appears but you do not immediately see it; or the spirit departs from you; or suddenly opening the eyes you see it, and gradually become frightened and broken.

Laozi said: The Way of the Four Rules must see the honoured spirits; those not of the highest true men should not be shown this. My Way is most secret; the world has no such person, better to be seen by the gate of the Way. Those who desire to practise the Four Rules should set them one chi five cun from themselves, three chi high. The Eastern Rule should see two immortals, wearing red cinnabar caps, their faces narrow, ears high, their bodies covered with black hair; when seen, do not be startled. The Western Rule should see the Queen Mother of the West, attended by jade maidens. The Southern Rule should see the Sovereign of Central Harmony Without Limit, with one body and eleven heads, wearing the crown of Nature, robe red in colour. The Northern Rule should see the Heavenly Emperor Sovereign with thirteen heads, wearing ceremonial robes as in his time.

Lingyang Zi Ming obtained this method and said: Sometimes one sees two persons, clothed in yellow, crowned in yellow, with white beards; the elder is the Lord of Longevity, the younger the Lord of Fate. Sometimes one sees two persons, dressed in red with red caps; the younger is the Lord who receives the Mandate, the elder the Lord of Life. Sometimes one sees two persons, clad in feather garments, yellow with black caps, the Lord who observes conduct. Sometimes one sees three persons, in feather garments, red cloaks, and blue caps, the Lord who listens to sounds. Sometimes one sees a single person, wearing a great cap and vermilion robes, holding a brush and a tally; the Lord of Judgment. Sometimes one sees a person in yellow robes and cap, covering the face, the Lord of Added Years. Sometimes one sees two persons in red skirts, the Lord who watches forms. Sometimes one sees a jade maiden in blue robes, called the Maid of Beneficent Essence. Sometimes one sees a jade maiden in black robes, called the Maid of Great Mystery. Sometimes one sees a jade maiden in red robes, called the Maid of Crimson Jade. Sometimes one sees a jade maiden in yellow robes, called the Maid of Constant Yang. Sometimes one sees three boys, wearing blue robes and purple lower garments, their names are Constant Presence, Severed Cave, and Five Virtues. Sometimes one sees nine jade maidens, all dressed in five colours, their names are Above, Tiger, Support, Spirit Gate, Kong Lin, Feng, Residence, Many, and [missing name]. Sometimes one sees a person with eyes three cun in diameter, in yellow robes with blue lower garments, called the Lord of the Same Eye. Sometimes one sees an infant two or three chi tall, smiling at people; these are the Nine Capital Boys. Sometimes one sees boys five or six chi tall, standing and smiling, those with natural caps are Noon Boys, those without natural caps are Midnight Boys. Sometimes one sees a human head with a birdâ€™s body, five-coloured black and yellow; this is the Supreme Great One Sovereign, the Dao Father. Sometimes one sees nine persons, all in blue robes with white hair; this is the Great Lord of Limitless Origin. Sometimes one sees a person six chi five cun tall, crowned with horns, white robes with red collars, sometimes with tiger and phoenix patterns, named Li Er, styled Boyang; he is always seen at dawn. Sometimes one sees a person six chi seven cun tall, crowned with a heavy floral cap, white robes with blue patterns, named Li Tan, styled Boyang; always seen at sunrise. Sometimes one sees a person six chi nine cun tall, crowned with a heavy floral cap, wearing five-coloured robes, named Li [missing], styled Boyguang; always seen at mealtime. Sometimes one sees a person seven chi two cun tall, crowned with a Pixie, wearing gauze robes, appearing as dragon and snake, named Li Shi, styled Menggong; always seen in the middle of the region. Sometimes one sees a person seven chi three cun tall, crowned with a flying dragon, wearing vermilion robes, named Li Chongquan, styled Ziwen; always seen at noon. Sometimes one sees a person seven chi five cun tall, wearing the Three Heroes crown and vermilion jade robes, named Li Ding, styled Wuyang; always seen at sunset. Sometimes one sees a person eight chi tall, crowned with fur and leather, wearing black robes, named Li Yuan, styled Boshi; always seen in the late afternoon. Sometimes one sees a person eight chi five cun tall, crowned with Nature, wearing dragon and snake robes, named Li Yuan, styled Yuansheng; always seen at sunset. Sometimes one sees a person nine chi five cun tall, crowned with Nature, wearing blue-purple robes, named Li Yuan, styled Bowen; always seen at dusk.

Laozi said: The superior man makes it in seven days; the middle man in ten days; the inferior man in one month.

Laozi said: Purple and green form the lining, combined to nine cun; the rule is one chi two cun.

Laozi said: The superior man, when making it, first sees his own form, then the ghosts and spirits in the house, then the heavenly spirits. Some ghosts or spirits sometimes have only one form and are not all seen; mostly no more than six or seven spirits come. But look closely in the rule, do not closely regard the spirits seen. Speak not, bow not; quickly settle yourself without fear.

Laozi said: Those who practise this Way shall not cut wood in spring; in summer shall not water to quench fire; in the months of the four seasons shall not dig earth; in autumn shall not smelt metal; in winter shall not dam water or weave wells.

Laozi said: Those who practise this Way shall not eat liver in spring, nor heart in summer, nor spleen in the months of the four seasons, nor lung in autumn, nor kidney in winter. The spirits of the five viscera when angry cause obscurity and shorten life.

Laozi said: Those who practise this Way, if they persist without weariness for seven days, having obtained it, apply it every seventy days, always as on the first day. This Way can return years and reverse old age. Lingyang Zi Ming said: Calm and serene, already at peace.

Laozi said: After seeing the spirits, again apply it. If asked the essentials of long life, then fully reveal them.

Laozi said: When the Way of the Four Rules is completed, you may hold to the Way of one rule and apply it, not again using the four. Twofold fasting and purification of the dark palace, wearing green caps, ascending to the North Pole above, descending to the Mystic Traces below, to mirror the affairs. In practising this Way, always place the vermilion bird three chi high above, the black tortoise five chi high below, the azure dragon nine chi high to the left, the white tiger seven chi high to the right, and also tread the sun and moon.

Laozi said: Not only oneself, but also have the vermilion crow carry the nine-cun mirror, the black tortoise bear the twelve-cun mirror, the azure dragon carry the sun, the white tiger carry the moon, oneâ€™s form resembling dragon and snake. One must be able to divide the form; sitting, to see beyond the four seas, then stop. Stopping means the true spirit comes. At night use lamps, candles, and hemp oil as fire, very good. If wishing to treat the sick, or enter great mountains fearing mountain spirits and a hundred ghosts who test men, place one rule above the door, one vessel of flower water below; draw a sword or knife across the water with the blade outward; a hundred ghosts will not advance; there are aged spectres who enter the door, but cannot pass the water and will immediately die, blood remaining in the water. Keep secret; do not show to the common people.

Laozi said: If you desire to repel five weapons and a hundred evils, take one three-cun rule, cast it with the Round Heaven Talisman, place it in your bosom; yin day on the right, yang day on the left. Entering the multitudes, it prevails; all fear it. My Way is secret indeed.

On a certain year, month, day, in a certain prefecture, county, village, a Taoist named so-and-so, using Laoziâ€™s Four Rules Bright Mirror Essential Formula, imparted it to a learner of certain prefecture, county, village, in exchange for forty chi of white silk, one dou of rice, one bundle of firewood, and five sheng of salt as a pledge. He must not fail to communicate the essential words; if he did not serve the body and enter the Yellow Springs, together with the former master, the Mysterious Lord Zhang Baiyu by chance formed, the Golden Master so-and-so, and Bing, jointly drew it as a bond; valid for three years. If not transmitted to the proper person, the recipient must thank heaven, earth, water, and the Three Officials; to attain immortality one must not go against the original words.

Laozi said: The Returning Heaven Talisman, also called the Round Heaven Talisman and the Cover Heaven Talisman, is secreted by Left Prime Minister. Written in vermilion.

(original talisman missing)

Laozi said: Round Heaven Talisman wards off disaster; one may obtain long life and prolonged vision, assured with Heaven. Tigers and wolves break teeth and gnash jaws; a hundred weapons dare not attack; when they see it, they prostrate and do not rise. One wearing this talisman, who can know? On the left is She, on the right Ji; surely receiving Heavenâ€™s blessings, a thousand autumns and ten thousand years, long life without limit. Urgently, urgently, as by law and ordinance.

Formerly, the Yellow Court Perfected Taoist, respectfully asked: The qi of Heaven, Earth, and Five Elements, man is most precious; yet some live not long, what is the reason?

Laozi said: Men receive the qi of Heaven and Earth, all should live one hundred and twenty years. But joy, anger, greed, lust, craving for delicacies, fondness for fat and sweet tastes, not restraining the mouth, not pleased in emptiness, dwelling daily in the vulgar world, unable to meditate on the Way, are all accompanied by evil ghosts, thus causing shortened life.

Taoist asked: If one can restrain the mouth, not delight in sweet, fat, licentious tastes, can one thereby measure oneself and not grow old?

Laozi said: If you can love the Way, be careful of body and mind, faithfully guard your one body, you may obtain non-aging. The human head is round, patterned after Heaven; the feet patterned after Earth; the five viscera patterned after the Five Elements; the four limbs patterned after the Four Seasons; the nine palaces patterned after the Nine Provinces; the eyes patterned after the sun and moon; the hair patterned after the stars and constellations. You should correspond to the foundation of Heaven; hence among all things man is most precious.

Heaven has a divine herb, named Jiu Heng, scattered throughout the world, growing in damp places. Its leaves shine like long male birds, growing robustly in the Way. In the eighth month of autumn, male and female unite at the root, branches and leaves intertwine; dragons and snakes obtain it, carrying and hiding it. In the third month of spring, when thunder sounds, it sprouts. When men eat it and store it in stone chambers, it becomes a treasure. Yao, when faced with a flood, and the people hungered and thirsted, ordered the people to gather it; all used it to revive themselves. Properly examined and taken, one may become a spirit-immortal; saints who take it close their mouths and speak not. Now I tell you this; you may thereby save your body. Gather it in mist, collecting when male and female meet in late autumn; very excellent. Hang it in the north of the dwelling to dry in shade, pound it a thousand times, place it in a large dish, mix with honey, form pills like firmos; take three pills daily. The number of days is three sevens, twenty-one days; then the Way is complete. Taking one day, one ascends the Mud Pill; the second day, one roams the Jade Hall; the third day, passes through the Jade Gate; the fourth day, disperses the Floral Canopy, stops at the Crimson Palace; the fifth day, circles the Floral Mountain, greatly excellent; all the spirits escort to ascend the Jade Heaven, to the Jade Hall. Completing twenty-one days, men and women, mature, young, all obtain their place. Can you not strive? Transmit this to the worthy.

The Grass-Carrying Diagram says: Born by the wayside in the second month, its colour is blue, with nine nodes; at the third node below are twelve leaves, at the fourth node twelve leaves, at the sixth node again twelve leaves, altogether thirty-six leaves. The lower root resembles a seated person, about three cun long, central and white, bark yellow. Its taste is sweet and pungent.

The Complete Medicine Talisman of the Seventy-Six Spirits combines the medicines and talismans; each of the four directions makes a separate talisman with the medicine having spirit.

North has the Talisman of Heavenly Harmony, West the Talisman of the Great General, South the Talisman of the Red-Clawed King Maiden, East the Talisman of the Azure Toothed Youth.

Written in black placed in the North, to collect the day of action.

Written in white placed in the West, to build the day of action.

Written in vermilion placed in the South, to fill the day of action.

Written in blue placed in the East, to complete the day of action.

Yellow Youth Jade Maiden presides over the medicine essence, able to combine medicine and create talismans in the four directions, not fearing any waste.

Laozi said: The downward form contains corpses like worms; if the Taoist takes it, worms descend, the qi moves, the eyes become clear. To expel this evil corpse, only gaze upon the bright breaking sun, dispelling and removing the form. Then drink purity and cleanliness. No residue remains seven breaks; the subdued corpse worm descends no more than seven breaks; for the elderly fewer. Then one should quietly withdraw. Also two talismans, both from Laoziâ€™s Thirty-Nine True Talismans, the eighth talisman, originally from two scrolls, differing talisman forms, hence repeated writing. Breaking and subduing corpses are also two talismans. In all who expel corpses, do not speak beforehand to others. Though the Three Corpses have no ears or eyes, they secretly know the person. Combining medicine must be in quiet place, entering mountains according to the proper season: first day of first month, twenty-fifth day of second month, twenty-fourth day of third month, sixteenth day of fourth month, eleventh day of fifth month, sixth day of sixth month, second day of seventh month, twenty-fifth day of eighth month, twenty-first day of ninth month, sixteenth day of tenth month. These are days when the Heavenly Granary opens; it is auspicious to go to named mountains. The first month corresponds to Rat, second to Ox, third to Tiger, fourth to Rabbit, fifth to Dragon, sixth to Snake, seventh to Horse, eighth to Goat, ninth to Monkey, tenth to Rooster, eleventh to Dog, twelfth to Pig. These days are Heaven and Earth opening days; entering the mountains is most auspicious; one may reside long, secure and free from calamity.

Laozi said: The entering mountain talisman, written in cinnabar on white silk ribbon, proceeds throughout the world.

Laozi said: The nameless name is my dwelling; the named name loses my bag. The unpossessed possession is my complete virtue; the possessed possession loses my treasure. There is no greater guilt than licentiousness; no greater calamity than greed; no greater fault than desire. These three calamities are called the chariot of calamity; on a small scale they endanger the person; on a large scale they ruin the family. Yet fasting the heart, thinking of three spirits: one called Spirit Vermilion Lord; second, Spirit Bright Lord; third, Spirit Yellow Lord. Constantly think of them; in walking, standing, sitting, lying down, thrice daily call their names; this may pass the years of calamity. Keep secret and do not transmit.

The first spirit wears crimson robes and yellow skirts; the second spirit wears yellow robes and yellow skirts; the third spirit wears crimson robes and yellow skirts.
