This single line on the right, in seal script, is for personal wearing. Originally, the seven primal talismans correspond to the sun, moon, and the five planets; beyond these there are six further talismans, which seem to be those of the Scripture of Dispelling Demons. But in that Scripture of Dispelling Demons there are altogether forty-nine talismans, and in its text all are left blank, with varying breadths and lengths; here several are shown, the rest being scattered and lost. There is also a single yellow talisman, which tradition says is taken from the Scripture of True Declarations.

The talisman of the Supreme Ultimate Perfected Person commanding the Northern Emperor of Fengdu is found in the Scripture of the Jade Horse; it is not certain whether this is the same.

The seven primal talismans, according to the world’s scriptures, roughly have methods of use. But here they are for wearing; therefore no explanation is given, save that it is proper to follow the Scripture of True Declarations, and write them in variegated colours on variegated silk, to be received and worn. The talisman commanding Fengdu, according to the Scripture of True Declarations, is said to be kept in a pouch of heavy purple, and worn on the head.¹
