## Diagram of the Grades of Verification in Cultivating Reality in the Seven Regions

In the leisure of the Yellow Emperor’s habitation in Yan, he ascended the Terrace of Enlightenment, where six sages attended him. These were Tian Lao, Li Mu, Da Hong, Tai Shan, Qi Xi, and Peng Zhang, who discoursed concerning the Way of Non-action and the essentials of long life and cultivation of Reality. The Yellow Emperor said: “If I were to visit the Purple Mansion Lord in Qingqiu, Master Ning in Qingcheng, the Lord of Supreme Harmony in Yanzhou, the Celestial Perfected One on Emei, and inquire of the meaning of the Five Teeth and Three Ones, and of the wondrous methods of flying upwards to long life, yet in practice I have not fully understood them. Moreover, man receives life, having form and body, blood and flesh in conglomerate; the use of the Way is emptiness, void, limitless, and placid without form. With the impediment of substance, to verify the formless Way—can it be attained? Tian Lao replied: ‘Heaven, earth, and all things follow the transformation of the Way; from non-being arises being. The use of the Way in human relations is to fly and run; from being returns to non-being, this is as turning the palm of the hand. If one can cultivate the essentials of the Way and attain it, one refines essence into spirit, spirit into qi; qi harmonizes with the Way. Though there be the impediments of form, body, bone, and flesh, and the vastness of mountains, rivers, and seas, they can be borne aloft and transformed; there is nothing impossible, nothing that cannot be done.’”

Tian Lao said further to the Yellow Emperor: “The people of the world are children of the Way; they receive qi and are born, they divide form and regulate their life. Heaven and its spirit, earth and its essence, the Way and its qi—these three mutually obtain, and thus man is born. Having obtained his body, he should preserve his qi, cherish his essence, and conserve his spirit; if these three are mutually obtained, then long life is possible. The people of the world do not know that the body is born of the Way; they abandon the root and pursue the branch, seeking death in error—how great is their delusion! The method of cultivating the Way proceeds from the ordinary to the sage, ascending and descending the seven regions; in one region are cultivated fourteen thousand methods of the ordinary, and among the seven regions are ninety-eight thousand gates to the Way, and the paths to ascend to Reality. All these depend on diligence and perseverance, by which one may hope to ascend to Heaven.”

The Supreme Daoist Lord’s “Silent Dao” says: “Those who learn the Way have nine ailments, all great diseases of men. If the ailments be carefully known, immortality may be attained. The nine ailments are: First, to have the will but not the time; second, to have the time but not companions; third, to have companions but not the will; fourth, to have the will but no teacher; fifth, to have a teacher but not learn; sixth, to learn but not be diligent; seventh, to be diligent but not able to preserve the Way; eighth, to preserve the Way but the will is not firm; ninth, to have firm will but not enduring. Therefore it is said: among a thousand ordinary men, there is one who knows the Way; among a thousand who know the Way, there is one who cultivates the Way; among a thousand who cultivate it, there is one who is devoted; among a thousand devoted, there is one who is diligent and enduring. Cultivate and be diligent and enduring, and the Way may be hoped for. If from youth one loves the Way and is single-minded without wavering, water and fire cannot frighten his heart, glory and wealth cannot perplex his will; cultivating Reality and embracing simplicity, in time he shall meet a teacher—then he will not fear lack. Thus he needs no companions to attain success, nor is he moved by outward influences. This is the broad essential teaching for learning immortality. Cultivators of the Way should think and be diligent. The grades and rewards of cultivation are arranged as follows:

The Daoist Lord said: ‘The marvels of the Immortal Way all have their methods. Those who can exhaust these methods become the Perfected of the Nine Palaces, not merely ascending to immortality. Yet the many methods of the Way are all complete and can be known. Life in the world, those who do not know the Way are no different from grass and trees, no different from birds and beasts; they are called ordinary men. Among ordinary men, those who have clear awareness, know that there is a great Way, and arise in their hearts to cultivate and learn, seeking to save the world, are called Daoists, also called travelers on the path.’

### Postscript

The Celestial Venerable’s love of life is great; the Daoist Lord’s teachings are extensive; the Elder Lord’s salvation of men is thorough. The three Saints rotate transformation, rescuing and elevating the dim and confused, all desiring to preserve the form of flesh and blood, like gold and stone in perpetuity, to prolong the life of the morning mushroom, equal the years of the great arbor, to ascend from the ordinary to immortality, from immortality to Reality, from Reality to verification of the Sacred, to ride the dragon chariot, to roam the great void, to raise the nine ancestors from the obscure shadow, to enjoy a long life through boundless kalpas. Yet the people of the world receive the qi of the Way and are born from the Way, but they despise the sect of clarity, emptiness, and placidity, and pursue the toil and splendour of the mundane realm, like oxen and horses drawn by heavy harness into mud, unable to extricate themselves, sinking deeper and deeper—how grievous this is! It is wished that the superior men be diligent in practice and seek many blessings for themselves.

Thus ends the Diagram of the Grades of Verification in Cultivating Reality in the Seven Regions.
