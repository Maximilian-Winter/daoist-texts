#### Preface to the Commentary on the Supreme Cavernous Profound Spiritual Treasure Primordial Boundless Salvation Scripture of the Highest Grade

The Great One embraces the true qi, indeed the wondrous Dao and immortal origin. The Scripture of the Spiritual Treasure for Salvation of Men is called the Cavernous Profound Highest Grade. It causes the birth of Heaven and Earth, opens and closes Yin and Yang; operation of transformation proceeds; primordial merit relies upon it and is vast and extensive. It illumines and suspends the sun and moon, revolves and turns the stars and constellations, universally nourishes the spirits, transforms and generates the varieties of beings. In the Tao Te Ching it is said that non-action is foremost, action is secondary. The highest virtue is non-action; the lower virtue is action. The highest benevolence is non-action; the highest righteousness is action. But this Scripture of Salvation ranks action first, non-action last. The mysterious seat floating in emptiness is action; the profound wisdom clear and penetrating is non-action. The celestial pivot and jade balance, wheels at rest for an instant, are action; the solemn purification of the ten directions, rivers and seas silent and still, are non-action. Therefore the Scripture is read through ten times; dry bones become men; merits diligently presented to the heavens, and then myriad gods pay homage. The thirty-two heavens and thirty-two emperors reveal the transformation of the ancestral kalpa, the birth of the heavens’ secret names. The heavenly secret names are guarded lest the heavenly beings become careless. Carelessness brings calamity upon the seven ancestors; diligent practice leads to attainment of the rank of immortal elder. Not transmitted through myriad kalpas, treasured by the heavens, what is this Spiritual Treasure? Qi is called spirit; essence is called treasure. Silent and unmoving, responding and thus communicating, it is called Spirit; above there is no further ancestor, only the Dao is the body; this is called Treasure. Qi joined and essence gathered is called Highest Grade. Spirit communicated and Dao united is called Salvation of Men. Thus the Spiritual Treasure is essence and qi. Essence and qi are mercury and lead. Mercury and lead are yin and yang. Yin and yang are Li and Kan. Li and Kan are not the way of action; once completed, how can they congeal and form grains of millet as pearls?

When man is first born, non-being combines with being; he steals the true and one qi of Heaven and Earth, and thus assumes his form. Gestating ten months, shedding the foetal membrane, taking day’s nourishment and night’s milk, then the form is complete and spirit kingly, spirit complete and essence pure, essence full and the qi of perfect harmony flourishing and filling. The sages say: when qi is complete, there is no thought of food; when spirit is complete, there is no thought of sleep; when essence is complete, there is no thought of desire. At this time it is called Pure Yang. Pure Yang is Qian. The superior man at this point pursues the highest virtue of non-action; cultivating inwardly and practising outwardly, the demon king reveres his form, and he attains immortality. Those of shallow learning in the Dao who do not delight in the immortal path are few who preserve the truth, many who are confused. They burn in the sea of desire in the field of drunken life and dreaming death; the true and one qi inherited from Heaven and Earth is secretly lost and dwells in Kun. Following this, Kun rides on one yang of Qian to become Kan; Qian is broken and deficient in one yang and becomes Li. Carefully consider: desire arises from love, love follows feeling, feeling is disturbed by circumstance. Much less the joys and angers, griefs and pleasures, anxieties and sighs, changes and vexations, day and night replacing each other, contending and wasting with things, how can one know the teaching that things are infinite while the heart has boundaries? Therefore the path of immortality is hard to fix, the way of ghosts easy to err, fate responding to destruction and salvation, the body passing through Taiyin, returning without limit; what sorrow and compassion! The perfected man and immortal child who meet a true master and suddenly comprehend the human way, their heart honest and not swayed by others, early follow the way of the Spiritual Treasure for Salvation of Men to restore it at the time that one qi is secretly lost. What is restoration? It is the way of lower virtue and action, the way of highest righteousness and doing, the way of suspending the primordial pearl, the way of flowing Wù to Jǐ, the way to subdue dragon and tiger, the way to refine lead and mercury, the way of golden liquid returning to truth, the way in which form and spirit are both wondrous. Only after understanding this can one believe the marvel of the discharging of Kṣitigarbha and the power of the golden jade dew form. Preserving the original year, all attain longevity, crossing the three realms and flying to the highest space, all within their due affairs. These are those who accumulate virtue and establish merit.

Carefully examining this Scripture, the Primordial Heavenly Honoured One, at the beginning of the Dragon Kalpa when Heaven and Earth first divided, inscribed the jade characters and compiled this Scripture. At that time the purple brush wrote in the forest of vacant azure, characters each extended one zhang, to present to the Jade Morning Daoist Lord. Jade Morning passed it to the Mysterious Unity Perfected Man, who passed it to the Heavenly True Sovereign. The Sovereign carefully wrote the text as the correct pronunciation and kept it secret. In the time of Xuanyuan, the Sovereign met with the Three Immortals of Supreme Purity on Mount Emei; the Yellow Emperor twice bowed and inquired of the Way, and the Sovereign gave him the Five Teeth Three Unity text, together with the upper scroll of the Scripture of Salvation. The Yellow Emperor cultivated it and became an upper immortal. Later, Emperor Ku at the Platform of Past Virtue received from the Sovereign the “Original Chapter” and “Jade Calendar Chapter”. During the Western Han Yuanfeng period, the Queen Mother of the West presented the upper scroll and two chapters to Emperor Wu, completing the entire Scripture. In the Eastern Han, the Supreme One descended to grant Gan Ji the addition of the “Spiritual Book Upper Chapter” and the “Great Peace Scripture” of one hundred and fifty scrolls. During Emperor Huan’s time, Laozi descended to Shu, granting the Celestial Master the Scriptures of Salvation and Northern Dipper, numbering over a thousand scrolls. In the Hao era, the Supreme True Man at Mount Shangyu of Kuaiji granted the Supreme Ultimate Left Palace Immortal Elder Ge Xuan the Scripture of Salvation, adding the “Spiritual Book Middle Chapter”. Zheng Real Man Siyuan bestowed to Baopuzi Ge Hong the classic text, further adding the “Spiritual Book Upper and Lower Chapters” and “Postscript of the Supreme Ultimate Real Man”, comprising the present complete text. During Jin, King Zuan received the Daoist Lord’s Scripture and several dozen other scrolls. In the Yuan and Wei times, Kou Qianzhi cultivated at Mount Song, inspired by the Supreme One to give this Scripture and over sixty other scrolls. As the Scripture circulated, people knew to recite and analyze it, but not that it contained the method of returning the elixir and long vision through prolonged observation. Since Zhenghe’s imperial commentary, followed by those of Xue Youqi, Yan Dongqi, Cheng Xuanying, Li Shaowei and other families. Further in the early Baoqing, Xiao Guan recompiled “Inner Meaning and Alchemy of Salvation”. These are all those who delve into the heart and reach the end.

I, by fate meeting the True Master, was taught the secret of the Golden Liquid Great Return Fire Talisman, desiring to make known this Way to all the world. Thus I annotated the Tao Te Ching and Diamond Sutra, expounded the Great Essentials of the Golden Elixir, then compared with worldly and Daoist usages, dividing my notes on this Scripture. Further citing the earlier sages’ discussion of goodness to confirm it. May those who regulate fortune and misfortune know to diligently recite and turn towards good; those who transcend creation know to cultivate and ascend to truth. Alas! The world knows to delight in life and hate death; knowing hatred of death, they must think how to escape death. But now it is not so. Knowing hatred of death, yet burying themselves in scenes of fame, profit, craving and desire, and not knowing repentance, this hastens death. Knowing delight in life, yet not seeking true masters to indicate the essence of longevity and return, blindly wandering side paths and walking evil roads, this hastens life. Among mountains and forests, cities and towns, the wise knowing to recite this Scripture ought to seek in it the shortcut of the Golden Elixir for eternity. The Supreme One, by the Way of Spiritual Treasure to save men, straight desires the world to walk this Way. If one can advance diligently, then the upper stream and Supreme Clarity of the formless realm will surely be attained. At the mid-autumn of the Dingchou year of the Zhiyuan era, at the Northern Purple Heaven Crimson Palace of Mount Jinluo, Preface by Upper Yangzi Chen Guanwu.

#### Commentary on the Supreme Cavernous Profound Spiritual Treasure Primordial Boundless Salvation Scripture of the Highest Grade, Upper Scroll

Annotation by Upper Yangzi Chen Guanwu

Upper Yangzi said: Supreme, the Dao alone is greatest; Above, Heaven and Earth are uniquely honoured. Cavernous, nothing is not penetrated; Profound, its mystery is hard to describe. Spiritual, transformations are incalculable, responding and thus communicating. Treasure, hard to obtain, cherished by men. Boundless, how can it be reckoned? Salvation of men, from the mundane to the holy. Highest grade, unmatched under Heaven; Wondrous, containing spirit and nurturing excellence. Scripture, a raft and ladder to Heaven. Summarily explained: most honoured and exalted, communicating spirit and transformations, the true Way of the Primordial True One for forming the Elixir. Thus it is spoken for the great root superior man, called the Way’s application. The Scripture has two uses, one for the Way’s application, one for the worldly method. The Way’s application is to rely on it to cultivate and ascend to immortality; the worldly method is to diligently recite and seek blessing. If explained by the worldly method, Supreme means lofty and exalted title; Cavernous Profound is the three Cavern grades: Cavern Truth, Cavern Profound, Cavern Spirit, indicating the Primordial profound path of True Unity. Spiritual Treasure is the title given to Jade Morning Daoist Lord who received the Primordial True Unity’s qi transformation, honoured as Spiritual Treasure. Boundless Salvation of Men is since the great kalpa’s beginning, transforming the heavens, generating myriad beings, by which the world is saved beyond count. Highest grade is the chief among 36 divisions, 48,000 scrolls of the Daoist Canon, numbering 400,000 chapters, with this Scripture foremost. Wondrous means indescribable; Scripture means the right path of the Dao. This is the worldly method. The great cultivator pursues both Way’s application and worldly method together, hiding worldly method within Way’s application, perfecting Way’s application by worldly method, thus cultivating nature and life together. The world says Buddhist cultivate nature, Daoists cultivate life; albeit wise and intelligent, they also hold to this view. Who knows that in this Scripture nature and life are mingled and form and spirit both wondrous! Upper Yangzi dared but reveal the heavenly secret, presenting the nature-life substance and use of this Scripture. Supreme means the substance of nature and the response of life, the body of the governor of creation; nature’s use is able to transform the heavens. Cavern is what true nature shares; Profound, the secret of working use; Spiritual, nature’s transformation; Treasure, life’s production; Boundless, not known to the ordinary; Salvation of men, men need men to save. Highest grade, there is no other Way under Heaven; like kinds may easily perform works. Wondrous, when one yang first moves, all things are spring. Scripture, having things, there is then a path of cultivation. Thus exposed, is it not straightforward? The Hunyuan Chronicle says: Laozi, at the Dragon Kalpa, incarnated to teach, issuing true texts in the Middle Heaven Great Blessing Hall Country, South Pole Red Bright Country, East Pole Floating Li Country, West Pole Xina Country, North Pole Yudan Country, all receiving Spiritual Treasure’s teaching. The Western King Hu asked: what is the Way? Laozi said: It is Supreme Spiritual Treasure, born before Heaven and Earth, vast and all-encompassing, subtle and all-inclusive. Heaven obtains it for clarity, Earth obtains it for peace, spirits obtain it for spirit, things obtain it for life, men obtain it for form. Those who cultivate it may become immortal, flying swiftly to the Jade Capital, therefore called Supreme. The Cavernous Profound Spiritual Treasure Boundless Salvation Scripture praises: Supreme abides before the Supreme Ultimate, originating before parents were born. Salvation requires the true Scripture for salvation; if asked about the true Scripture, Gui is lead.

The Dao says: In the beginning, in the first azure Heaven, the blue vault empty sings over the Great Floating Li Land, received the “Primordial Salvation Boundless Highest Grade”. The Primordial Heavenly Honoured One then spoke this Scripture, passing through it ten times to call the ten directions. Beginning to approach the seat. The Heavenly True Great Spirits, Highest Saints and Venerables, Wondrous Conduct Perfected Men, countless beings without measure, riding air and coming on flying clouds and cinnabar skies, green chariots and jade wheels, feathered covers shading, flowing essence and jade light, five colours flourishing, illuminating the great void, seven days and seven nights. The heavens’ sun, moon, stars and constellations, the celestial pivot and jade balance, wheels stop at once. The divine wind is silent, mountains and seas hide clouds, the sky has no drifting shade, the four qi are bright and clear. A kingdom of land, mountains, rivers and woods, all levelled equally, no longer high or low. The soil all becomes jade-green, without different colour; myriad spirits serve the seat.

Upper Yangzi said: By worldly method, this is the narration of the Scripture’s origin; by Way’s application, it all speaks of the wondrous Way of the Primordial True Unity Great Elixir. Laozi said: There is a thing confusedly formed, born before Heaven and Earth, we know not its name, but call it Dao. The Dao itself is wordless; words are used to reveal the Dao’s use. Therefore it is said: “The Dao that can be spoken is not the eternal Dao.” By worldly method explanation, the Dao Lord expounds the Scripture’s meaning, directly called the words of the Dao. By Way’s application, the Dao precedes the vast void and forms the Supreme Ultimate, which in secret darkness divides Yin and Yang; Yin and Yang form bodies, which become nature and life; when nature and life arise and transcend, then comes the solar spirit qi. Spirit qi arises from the breaking of chaos and is called lead and mercury. Lead and mercury operate at the gate of Wù and Jǐ, the mystical female gate. Thus the mystical female gate is the root of Heaven and Earth, this is called Dao. To follow and use the Dao is the meaning of words. Therefore the Scripture begins directly: The Dao says. “In the beginning in the first azure Heaven.” “In the beginning” is before the Supreme Ultimate; “first azure Heaven” is the beginning of all things. The blue vault empty sings is the beginning of transformation; the Great Floating Li Land is the place of birth of things. Receiving “Primordial Salvation Boundless Highest Grade”, practising this profound unity great elixir. This is Way’s application. By worldly meaning, “In the beginning” refers to the first azure Heaven, the foremost Heaven in the east, the Heaven of the seed people. Above is the widespread bluish cloud, called the Blue Vault Heaven. There is qi drifting as divine wind stirring sounds, like hollow singing; below is a country called Great Floating Li. “Inner Meaning” says: Great Floating Li Land shows the beginning of creation; things are born of the land and return to the land. The Yin Fu Scripture says: Fire is born of wood; calamities arise and must be overcome. He who knows this cultivation is called a sage. Within wood is fire; if it arises without control, ashes scatter and vanish without return to nature. He who can control it, though fire burns wood to ashes, can gather ashes into earth, preserving the original nature. First azure Heaven is the place of wood; Blue Vault empty song is the image of fire; Great Floating Li Land is the source of earth. Earth is the base of the returning elixir. The returning elixir is the way to return to origin and return to the source. The Scripture says: “Reaching the utmost void, guarding stillness firmly, myriad things all produce, I observe their returning.” All things flourish, each returns to its root; returning to root is stillness, stillness is returning life. This is the principle of return. The Book of Changes’ Return hexagram says: “Returns reveal the heart of Heaven and Earth.” Heaven and Earth are the substance of Yin and Yang; the heart is to illuminate their function. Heaven moves and Earth is still; Yang moves and Yin is still. Heaven moves to the utmost and Yin arises; Earth is still to the utmost and Yang arises. Thus peeling above and returning below; movement and stillness, decline and growth, thus reveal the heart. So it is with man. The Return hexagram has one Yang under five Yin; its body is Zhen below and Kun above. Zhen, wood, is first azure Heaven; wood gives fire, the blue vault empty song. Fire produces earth; therefore Kun earth is Great Floating Li Land. Earth is the root of creation; earth produces metal, called empty qi metal embryo, indeed the primordial ancestral qi. The Primordial Heavenly Honoured One is “Primordial” and “Mysterious One”; Heaven is the highest qi, the most exalted honour, the extreme of all existence. The Way’s application is the primordial qi of the Dharma body, also called the original face, the imperishable primordial spirit. Therefore the Alchemical Scripture says: Primordial Heavenly Honoured One is myself, thus speaking this Scripture. At the appointed time it is spoken; Way’s application is the Scripture, indeed true lead. Laozi said to Master Wen: “If you can know the One, all matters are complete.” Again: “The One is lead; lead is lord; the two is mercury; mercury is minister. If lead be not true, mercury is hard to unite. If lead is true, it does not lose its household and ministers.” Passing through ten times to call the ten directions. By worldly method, the Heavenly Honoured One speaks the Scripture, summoning true beings and spirits. “Passing through” means widely announcing; “calling” means universally summoning. Summoning is the principle acting in ten directions. Approaching the seat, the Way’s application is that the elixir has the power of nine returns in ten months. Beginning to approach the seat is the arrival of the golden elixir to its chamber. The great cultivator enters the chamber to do the lower work, pursuing two qi on the Yellow Path, uniting three natures at the primordial official, passing the seventy-two gates of essential passages, gathering the three thousand six hundred correct qi; is it not the true supreme highest saint, countless beings without measure, collecting into the elixir cauldron, assembling the golden embryo? Is it not riding air and coming, uniting spirit and qi, refining qi? Is not the form like flying clouds and cinnabar skies, feathered covers shading, golden splendour shining, silver essence emitting brilliance? Is it not flowing essence and jade light, five colours flourishing, illuminating great void? By worldly method, the Heavenly Honoured One’s divine power summons; how could it be otherwise! Seven days and seven nights, the great transformation of Heaven and Earth; ten months pure Yin without Yang, until the eleventh month belongs to Zi; though Zi has Yang, it has not returned; after seven days, Yang first returns; this is Heaven and Earth’s Yin and Yang. The moon meets the fifteenth day and is full; by the twenty-seventh night, the moon is dark and without Yang. By the third day of the later month at Shen hour, the moon’s one Yang is reborn at Geng; this is the Yin and Yang of moon and sun, all returning by sevens. Heaven One produces water; Earth six completes it; this is the seven number of the five phases. The way of the Golden Elixir gathers numbers; at one time there are six phases, one phase governs five days. When gathering herbs, only one and a half phases are used, also seven days and seven nights. The Book of Changes says: “Hard and soft are the image of night.” The sages say: “Hard and soft are the coming and going of one qi.” Man’s breathing is the coming and going of one qi. One inhale and one exhale is one breath; between one breath, Yin and Yang are divided. Exhaling brightly is Yang; inhaling dimly is Yin. The seven orifices’ exhalations are seven days; the seven orifices’ inhalations are seven nights. The golden mother’s work proceeds, the heavenly mechanism unmoving, spirit steady and eyes fixed, pulse steady and heart at rest; therefore seven days and seven nights. The heavens’ sun, moon, stars and constellations, the celestial pivot and jade balance, wheels stop at once; breath neither entering nor leaving; the divine phoenix silent; qi neither rising nor descending; this is the mountain and sea hiding clouds. All false attachments are purified, as if the sky without drifting shade; the six roots firmly established, called four qi bright and clear. Way’s application reaches this, then is seen the wondrous mingling of nature and life. One kingdom of land; worldly method is Floating Li Land; Way’s application is one body. Man takes the body as kingdom, essence as people, qi as lord, spirit as commander. Mountains, rivers, forests and trees are all within the body. True stillness is deep and clear; this is level and equal, no longer high or low. Nature is like jade’s purity; what difference is there in colour? The Inner Meaning says: Earth is nature and feeling; nature is empty and transforms to produce spirit, residing in the chamber, called Wù earth. Qi is stirred and has feeling, gathered in the cauldron, called Jǐ earth. When Wù and Jǐ meet, spirit delighted, qi quiet, nature returns and feeling is obscure, like the blue qi flaw of colour, like the true jade free from impurity; thus earth all becomes jade-green, without differing colour. The heart and eyes inwardly observe true qi; three souls return to body, seven spirits return to truth; the heart master is one and peaceful; myriad gods obey commands; therefore myriad spirits attend the seat. These are all the Way’s application of action. By worldly method explanation, the Heavenly Honoured One’s power influences heavenly spirits, Earth and Earthly Deities, sun, moon, stars and constellations, responding to occasions, the scenes are so. The praise says: Blue vault empty sings the most wondrous sound, Great Floating Li Land seeks Kun. Flowing essence illuminates, divine wind silent, deep stillness subtle Yang refines five Yins.

The Primordial Heavenly Honoured One on the mysterious seat floating above the five-coloured lion spoke the Scripture once; all the heavenly great saints simultaneously praised it. At this time a kingdom of men and women deaf and sick, all their ears opened and became clear. Reciting the Scripture twice, the blind regained sight. Thrice, the mute recovered speech. Four times, the lame and sick all rose up. Five times, long diseases and chronic ailments all at once recovered form. Six times, white hair returned black, fallen teeth regrew. Seven times, the old became strong again, the young all vigorous. Eight times, women conceived, birds and beasts bore unborn young; all that are born or unborn all gained generation. Nine times, Kṣitigarbha discharged and revealed, golden jade dew manifested. Ten times, dry bones were renewed, all rose and became men. At that time all men and women in the kingdom, none were not wholeheartedly devoted, all received protection and salvation, all attained longevity.

Upper Yangzi said: By Way’s application, the Primordial Heavenly Honoured One is the primordial spirit. The Purple Clear White Perfected Man says: This spirit is not the thinking spirit, it may be compared shoulder to shoulder with the Primordial. The Inner Meaning says: The mysterious seat is the spirit chamber; floating in emptiness is the Dharma body. Five colours are the qi of wondrous transformation; the lion is the heart’s knowledge. The primordial spirit in the chamber moves the heart to gather qi; the Dharma body is void and tranquil; heart’s knowledge is bright and wondrous. The spirit governs qi; the heart images the master; is not this the Dao sign of the Heavenly Honoured One? Is it not my true nature? Then the mysterious seat floating in emptiness is deep stillness and true quiet, always responding and always still. The hardest to subdue in man is the heart and nature. The Scripture says: Man’s spirit loves clarity but the heart disturbs it, the heart loves stillness but desire draws it away. Spirit is true nature; if the heart is still, spirit is naturally clear. Entering the chamber, subduing the heart is like subduing a wild beast. The sages compared lead and mercury to tiger and dragon, saying they are hard to subdue. Pure Yang says: Warm lead cauldron, light penetrates the curtain. Creation contends and hastens; tiger and dragon mate; advancing fire work is perilous as the ox and dipper fight; much more the lion who is king of beasts, sitting floating and empty on top; slight negligence is greatly perilous. The Azure Origin Perfected Man says: One must first subdue and sit upon it, as if voiding the heart, extending the form, then the Dao can respond; this is the root of transcendence. Speaking the Scripture once, all the heaven’s great saints simultaneously praise it. The cultivator of the profound unity and highest truth spiritual treasure great return elixir, revered by myriad saints, honoured by heavens, protected by demon kings, admired by ghosts and spirits; how much more when receiving the Scripture seat, is this not praised? By Way’s application, practising the Way once, the spirits in the body all become joyous. A kingdom of men and women, deaf and sick ears all open and become clear; twice the blind regain sight; thrice the mute recover speech. By worldly method this seems shallow; by Way’s application understanding, its reason is most exact. Why? All ordinary men cannot calmly listen and nourish qi, gather vision and store spirit; therefore ears are deceived by sound, eyes disturbed by colour, mouth enslaved by taste, long without enlightenment, in the end inevitably blind, deaf, mute and dumb. Laozi said: “Five tones make men deaf, five colours make men blind.” The great cultivator listens to no sound, long becomes more acute; sees no form, long becomes more clear; mouth does not taste mixture, long becomes more pure. How much more at the moment of entering the chamber, when my five senses, how should I fear and guard against hunger? Wei Perfected Man says: The three treasures of ear, eye, mouth are closed and not opened; the Perfected Man is deep in the abyss, floating and wandering within the rules. Sitting amidst the three colours of blue, yellow and white clouds, inside and outside mingled in obscurity, there are Azure Dragon, White Tiger, Vermilion Bird, Black Tortoise, Lion and White Crane arranged left and right; sun and moon shine brightly, illuminating the chamber; neck produces round image, light reflects ten directions, thus clearly displayed. The secret mantra says:

Gan Luo Yu Luo, talisman no Sutra. Great Void Supreme Ultimate, Yin heart, no wine no lust, change garments, burn incense, recite Scripture, practise goodness, sit without sleep, yang embraces harmony. Outgoing has incoming not, incoming gives birth out death. Ghosts and spirits are unfathomable, transformations natural. Primordial mixed qi, profound within profound. Above solid has end, below cavern great abyss. Reciting once, chronic sickness self healed. Refining soul bathing spirit, true Yang self complete. Fasting, reciting rites, myriad passages fly to immortality. Supreme secret mantra, receive command continuously. Repeat heart mantra, Gan Luo penetrating. Jade Clear Supreme, Brahma qi dense. Distribute spirit lay qi, descend inject assign body. Form and spirit both wondrous, united with Dao true. Minister body attains Dao, seven ancestors ascend. Hanging like golden grid, commanding myriad spirits. Urgent urgent like Primordial Mysterious Capital law decree.

The Supreme Mysterious Origin Highest Dao Lord summons from my body the three-five officers of merit, left and right officials and messengers, incense attendants golden youths, passing words jade maidens, five emperors’ direct talismans, direct day incense officials, each thirty-two in number, opening and closing the gates as spoken. Today is auspicious, prolonged fasting and pure hall, practising to the Scripture, boundless salvation of men, turning the Scripture to receive life, wishing the opening of the above to reach through, the path to the Supreme Thirty-two Heavens Primordial Heavenly Honoured One Supreme before the throne.

Then, gathering qi thirty-two passages, facing east recite the Scripture.

Upper Yangzi said: This Scripture is indeed the essence of cultivation, revealing the true ancestral qi; therefore it states the day of practising the Way rather than the day of Scripture recitation; one must know Scripture is elixir, elixir is Dao, Dao is Scripture. Without Dao, Scripture does not arise; without Scripture, elixir does not arise; without elixir, Dao is not accomplished. This is the fixed principle, there is no other path. This must be explained both by Way’s application and worldly method. Cultivating the Way has two kinds, internal practice and external practice. Now first refer to external practice: bathing and fasting, strictly establishing altars, burning incense and reciting Scripture, walking in the void to pay homage, this is external practice. The Azure Origin Perfected Lord said: Using five fragrant waters and mantras to wash the body; besides bathing greatly with Brahma qi, circulating through the ten directions, to reach the central regulation of the five qi, mingling myriad spirits; this is internal bathing. Fasting is not only to forbid meat and filthy food, but also first to cut off lustful desire; then unity of heart prevents calamity, guarding nature removes disaster. Entering the chamber is entering peace and dustlessness; body and heart concentrated, able to communicate with spirits. Facing east is the direction of longevity, gathering living qi, the method of knocking teeth; left is heavenly bell, right is heavenly chime, calling the immortal spirits. Centre is heavenly drum paying homage to the Highest Saint. Heart worship means body unmoved, focused on preserving ceremony. Closing eyes means gathering vision and inward observing, qi is quiet and still. Blue is the qi of Profound Unity, yellow is the qi of Primordial Unity, white is the qi of Original Unity; the meaning of three colours is taken from the Three Pure Ones; sitting and preserving them, spirit and brightness naturally appear. Inner and outer scenes, thick and obscure mingled. Next preserving Azure Dragon, issuing from the liver, on the left. White Tiger issues from the lungs, on the right; Vermilion Bird from the heart, in front; Black Tortoise from the kidneys, behind. Lion and White Crane each preserve by six, issuing from the six entrails, divided left and right. Left eye becomes sun wheel, showing purple-red light ninefold; right eye becomes moon wheel, showing yellow-white light sevenfold. Three feet apart from the body, the light shining brilliantly, shooting into the nose, passing the brain behind, entering the Golden Splendour Palace, forming a round light as large as a cartwheel, interspersed with blue, yellow and white three colours; this is the nine-coloured round image. With this brightness, illuminating the ten directions, then recite the secret mantra. Secret means without sound. After the mantra, the gates are announced as before. After gates announced, facing east sit upright, preserving the spirits of the four beasts and others in front listening to the law and hearing the Scripture; then aloud intone without distracting thoughts or chatting, nor interrupt Scripture or law. As if speaking before sovereign or father, not a little laxity; striving for communication to Heaven thoroughly. This is the external Way, all naturally worldly method. If internal Way, then is Way’s application. The matter is entirely different; why? People look at Scripture only superficially, unaware that the Scripture is a great cultivation, teaching people to walk the Way in the Scripture, thus it says the day of practising the Way, not the day of reading Scripture. Cultivating the inner elixir has entering the chamber and doing the lower work, hence entering the chamber facing east, not climbing the altar. Ascending the hall means practising the returning elixir. Scripture means reverence. The Heavenly Honoured One speaks the Scripture to let the ignorant know their return; reverence turns the heart to good, not doing wrong, preserving spirit and nourishing qi, thus avoiding calamity. If not bathing, fasting, changing garments, entering the chamber and reciting, one instead invites calamity. If superior man or perfected man practises the Way in the Scripture, hence the day of practising the Way. Scripture is Dao, Dao is elixir; to cultivate the elixir there is entering the chamber. Cultivators first refine themselves and preserve the heart, hence bathing. Men of the Way first sever desire and thought, hence fasting. The ignorant know not this matter, yet loudly read and recite and will surely fail. What is practising the Way? It is cultivating the returning elixir; what is returning elixir? It must have master’s instruction. The Pure Yang Perfected Man said: Without master’s point, this matter is hard to know. Laozi said: I am not a saint, I learned by study. Therefore to learn alchemy one must first seek a master, and not rashly guess and explain. Once receiving master’s transmission, one must first refine oneself. What is refining oneself? It is to cast away desire and thought, nourish essence and qi. Pure Yang said: First must refine oneself and await time; after refining oneself, must gather elixir friends as external protection. Liu Haichan said: This matter is extraordinary, seek one’s companion among men. Chen Niwan said: Without comrade to arrange, fearing that the furnace’s fire stage is not right. Once obtaining partners, first seek furnace and cauldron. The Awakening Truth says: First take Heaven and Earth as furnace and vessel, next capture black rabbit medicine to cook. Once having furnace and vessel, then select day. What is selecting day? The Purple Yang Perfected Man said: Mercury meets Gui and must promptly seek. Also: When sweet dew descends, Heaven and Earth unite. That is it. Having the day and having the time, one must then practise the hexagrams and qi. Thus Awakening Truth says: Take the center solid of Kan position, point and transform the Yin within the Li Palace. Therefore knocking teeth thirty-two times, heart bows thirty-two times is returning the sixty-four hexagrams. Closing eyes and silent thought, Bo Yang Perfected Man said: Ear, eye, mouth the three treasures, closed and sealed, do not open. Perfected Man in deep abyss, floating and wandering guarding the middle. Sitting amidst the blue, yellow and white three-coloured cloud qi, my master Yuan Duzi said: Primordial one qi comes from emptiness and nothingness. Blue qi is mercury, white qi is lead, yellow qi is earth. Because mercury and lead are not yet combined, they rely on earth to unite. The Purple Yang self-preface says: Pursuing two qi on the Yellow Path, uniting three natures at the official, gathering five phases, harmonizing four images, dragon roars, tiger growls, husband sings, wife follows; thus knowing inner and outer mingling, four beasts arrayed, sun and moon shine, illuminating chamber, neck produces round image, thus clearly displayed. Secret mantra means great sound, rare voice. This is called practising the Way, this is called reciting Scripture, this is called inner and outer two images. When elixir is completed, then gates are announced, and the spirits and souls in the body all transform into gods. Praise says: The work of entering the chamber cuts off false emotions, reciting Scripture and practising the Way early cultivates.

Annotation by Upper Yangzi Chen Guanwu

Upper Yangzi said: Scripture is Dao and reverence. Dao is to honour and practise it; reverence is to guard it and not lose it. The world knows what to revere, the Three Treasures. The Three Treasures are indeed the root of the wondrous Dao; by Way’s application, they are called the Three Treasures within the body; by worldly method, they are the Three Treasures in the teaching. The Three Treasures within the body have two aspects. The Three Treasures of teaching have two explanations. Now speaking of the teaching’s Three Treasures: they are Dao, Scripture, and Master.

The “Three Treasures Great Possession Golden Scripture” speaks of Heavenly Treasure, Spiritual Treasure, Spirit Treasure, all divided qi and transforming, also the three treasures within the body. If speaking of the returning elixir golden liquid way, the three treasures within the body have two explanations. Spirit, qi and essence are the internal three treasures; ear, eye and mouth are the external three treasures. If one can honour the external three treasures and not act rashly, then the internal three treasures can form the returning elixir and complete the embryo infant. Therefore true texts, precious talismans, dragon and phoenix script, jade slips and golden writings, the profound classics of the three Caverns, thirty-six divisions and 48,000 scrolls, all issue from the three treasures; thus Scripture
