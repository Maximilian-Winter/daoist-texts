Memorial for Presenting the Scripture

The humble servant Xue Jizhao, with reverence and awe, bows his head, prostrates himself, and twice respectfully presents the following words: I have heard that the millet pearl is the work of creation, bestowed by the Primordial Origin to reveal the profound mystery; the Spiritual Treasure Scripture as its original chapter depends upon the Dao Lord for its unfolding. Heaven loves not the Dao, yet the world obtains to see the Scripture, verily a rudimentary document of Chaos, named the Supreme Mysterious Beginning. The primal thread unfolds to the thirty-two emperors; the divine script guards the twenty-four attendants. The upper dispels heavenly calamities, the lower wards off poisons and harms. Therefore, those who lightly reveal, leak, or act with disdain shall suffer the body’s hell; those who offer homage and reverence shall ascend to the rank of Immortal Lords. Yet though many recite the Scripture, few are those who truly comprehend its intent. The ancients were not without annotations, but many enter into the profound and mysterious; the late learners find it not easy to understand, increasing doubt. The mind is dim and confused, the sounds loud and resonant. We, the humble servants, being ordinary men, delight to inquire into the mysterious orifice, receive the master’s heart seal, lead the manifest thunder altar. Ashamed of no inch of merit to dispel the three evils, we assist in explaining the sentences of the Six Classics, refer to the profound discourses of the ancients, collect them into one school, widely opening the eyes of the multitude. We dare not impose upon the supreme Dao, but only guide the inferior roots, explaining according to the text, analyzing chapter by chapter, only desiring to illuminate the sage words as the sun and moon, how could we avoid guilt before the hills and mountains? We pray for the emperor’s grace to forgive our presumption. With trembling awe, we bow our heads and prostrate ourselves twice. Humbly we contemplate the incomparable Great Luo Three Realms, the Golden Gate, the Jade Emperor, the Supreme Sovereign of the Jade Throne, who illuminates the Three Scenes, transforming and producing the various heavens. The celestial seat expounds the Scripture, all at once proclaiming goodness. Life and death depend thereon, blessings difficult to surpass. The profound mystery may be detailed; the salvation of beings is boundless. Humbly we hope the emperor pities our uncleansed defilements, regards our diligent study of the Scripture, penetrating mysteries and seeking subtleties, roughly comprehending its chapters; burning incense and reciting the Scripture, wishing to fulfill this intention. Relying on imperial protection, we obtain the cause, completing the heart unfulfilled over many years, opening the eyes that once were closed since former lives. Benefiting all beneath the six heavens, whether male or female, all may attain longevity. Perhaps in a single day, neither wise nor foolish, all may enter the Dao. Mutual absence of false thoughts, ancestors only wish for ascension. We again request protection and transmission for ages to come. Formerly the heavens recorded human merits and faults with no loss of detail; now a whole country devotes its heart in reverence, joy unspeakable. The servant’s feelings cannot bear but to gaze heavenward and worship the sage; risking death, bowing low, confessing guilt and praying for grace to the utmost. Respectfully submitted.

In the seventh year of the Great Virtue, the day of Jiachen in the first month, the humble servant Xue Jizhao respectfully presents this memorial.

Commentary on the Supreme Mysterious Scripture of the Primordial Origin’s Boundless Salvation of Beings, Volume Upper  
By Xue Jizhao, Manifested Elder of Ice Lake of Jiujiang

The Supreme Cavernous Profound Spiritual Treasure Boundless Salvation of Beings Supreme Scripture

The “Supreme” is the High Dao Lord of the Jade Morning. Disciple of the Primordial Heavenly Venerable, Teacher of the Supreme Emperor of the Supreme Micro Heaven, dwelling in the Upper Clear and Upper Origin Jade Morning Palace. Having been granted the Scripture, he therefore titles its beginning as “Cavernous” — the three Caverns being the Cave Truth, Cave Profound, and Cave Spirit. “Profound” means mysterious; when dispersed it is Scripture, when gathered it is Dao. The Spiritual Treasure is one chapter among the Three Treasures. According to the “Scripture of Generating Spirits”: The Dragon Han opened the diagram, transforming and producing the Spiritual Treasure Lord; in the first year of the Red Brightness, the Scripture was issued for salvation, called Upper Clear. The Jade Capital of the Profound Metropolis, the Purple Tenuity Palace, is the heaven where the Dao Lord resides. This “Salvation Scripture” is collected by the Supreme Dao Lord Spiritual Treasure Heavenly Venerable, thus called Spiritual Treasure. “Boundless” means immeasurable, indicating its vastness. “Salvation of Beings” is the opening of salvation to all beings. “Supreme” denotes the highest grade of salvation. “Mysterious Scripture” means mysterious and profound, “Scripture” means the path. This Scripture is the quick and subtle way to salvation.

The Dao says: In times past, in the Primordial Blue Heaven,

This Scripture was bestowed by the Primordial Origin upon the Dao Lord. “Dao says” are the words compiled and narrated by the Dao Lord. The Dao Lord says: I, in the distant past immeasurable kalpas ago, was in the Primordial Blue Heaven. This heaven is one among the eight northern heavens, namely the heaven of the Azure Vault, Floating Li Empty Song Baozhen. The “Daoist Canon” says: The six heavens of desire realm range from the first Supreme Emperor Heaven of the East to the sixth Upper Clarity Heaven; these are the desire realm, destroyed by the fire calamity of the kalpa. The eighteen heavens of form realm range from the seventh Void Heaven of the East to the eighth Limitless Heaven of the West; these are the form realm, destroyed by the water flood calamity of the kalpa. The four heavens of formless realm range from the first Bright Court Heaven of the North to the fourth Supreme Element Heaven; these are the formless realm, destroyed by the great wind scattering calamity of the kalpa. Moreover, from the fifth to the eighth northern heavens are the four kinds of people heavens. Though collectively called the formless realm, these kalpa calamities are long-lasting and water, fire, and wind cannot reach them. When the three realms are destroyed by calamities, these heavenly sages again open and transform the peoples, and the Primordial Blue Heaven is one of the four kinds of people heavens. It rules over the kalpa and transforms and produces the various kalpas.

The Azure Vault, the Great Floating Li Land,

Describes the Primordial Blue Heaven, the azure and blue Brahma Qi, vast and unbounded, within which the heavenly beings sing hollow songs in echo. The Floating Li is the hidden name of the king of the Primordial Blue Heaven.

Receiving the Primordial Origin’s Boundless Supreme Salvation.

The Dao Lord says: I, in the Primordial Blue Heaven, received this highest supreme Scripture. This is the Dao Lord’s record at the beginning of the Heavenly Venerable’s preaching.

The Primordial Heavenly Venerable will speak this Scripture, circling ten times, summoning the ten directions, and then shall seat himself.

The Dao Lord says that the Heavenly Venerable will at first speak the Scripture, making ten circuits, universally summoning the ten directions, then shall seat himself. Circuit means to encompass. The ten directions are east, south, west, north, northeast, southeast, southwest, northwest, above and below, beginning at one and ending at ten. Ten circuits thus complete a full cycle.

The Heaven-born Great Spirits, Supreme Saints, Mysterious Acting True Men, innumerable as the sands, riding the void come.

These denote those who have attained the Dao and verified the truth, all coming to hear the Heavenly Venerable’s preaching. Innumerable means countless. Riding the void means to ride the qi and come to the place of preaching without attachment to form or formlessness.

Flying clouds, cinnabar skies, green chariot, jade wheel, feather umbrellas hanging as shade. This describes the ceremonial attire of those coming to hear the Dharma at once.

Flowing essence, jade light, the five colours luxuriantly flourishing, illuminating the vast void, seven days and seven nights.

This describes the immortals refined into true beings, nurturing the five viscera internally, their radiance issuing forth as five colours, shining through space without dispersal. Luxuriantly flourishing means flourishing; illuminating means light penetrating. The heavens of day and night differ from the human world. The Dao Lord manifests all heavenly beings as coming to hear the Dharma.

All heavens’ sun, moon, and stars, the Dipper and Jade Beam; at this time the wheels pause.

Every heaven has three lights; for hearing the Scripture the wheels stop turning. The Dipper is the Big Dipper constellation; the Jade Beam is the handle of the Dipper.

The divine winds are still, mountains and seas hide clouds, the sky without floating shadows, the four quarters clear and bright.

All attachments cease and are silent; not a speck remains.

A single country’s land, mountains, rivers, forests, and trees are evenly levelled, no more high or low.

Refers to the Great Floating Li Land, all equal, without height or depth.

The earth all appears as jade, without difference of colour. All true beings sit attending.

Without difference of colour means the earth is like jade in appearance. The Scripture says: the place where the Dharma is spoken, the palaces are all formed of seven treasures. The Dao Lord reveals the Heavenly Venerable’s Dao power manifest.

The Primordial Heavenly Venerable’s mysterious seat floats above the five-coloured lion.

The Heavenly Venerable suspends in emptiness and ascends the seat, riding darkness and floating in space, neither clinging to form nor formlessness. The lion is king of beasts, symbolizing the Heavenly Venerable’s sovereignty above all heavens. The five colours are the light of Dharma signs.

As the Scripture is spoken once, all great saints of the heavens simultaneously acclaim goodness.

Once a circuit is completed, all beings in the heavens receive according to their root faculties, each attaining awakening, all acclaiming it good.

At that time, in one country, men and women who were deaf and ill, all had their ears opened and became hearing; after the second circuit, the blind had their eyes opened; after the third, the mute could speak; after the fourth, the lame and chronically ill all could stand and walk; after the fifth, those with long-standing chronic diseases were immediately restored; after the sixth, white hair returned black, lost teeth regrew; after the seventh, the old became vigorous, the young all strong; after the eighth, women conceived, birds and beasts pregnant, all born and unborn obtained form; after the ninth, the earth’s treasure manifested, gold and jade appeared; after the tenth, dry bones came to life, all rose as humans.

At the first circuit, summons were made to the east for the deaf to hear; at the second, to the south for the blind to see; at the third, to the west for the mute to speak; at the fourth, to the north for the lame to walk; at the fifth, to the northeast for those long ill and disabled to be restored; at the sixth, to the southeast for white-haired to blacken and teeth to regrow; at the seventh, to the southwest for the aged to be vigorous and the young to be brave; at the eighth, to the northwest for all born and unborn to obtain form; at the ninth, to above for the treasures buried underground to shine; at the tenth, to below for dried bones to rise from death. At this time, all in one country, male and female, wholeheartedly turn in reverence, all receiving protection and salvation, all attaining longevity.

During the preaching, no distinction is made between male and female; all partake of the blessing’s power. Those already born to heaven are protected by the Scripture; those yet to be born are prolonged in life by it. This is the Dao Lord’s preface to the Heavenly Venerable’s Scripture preaching effect.

The Dao says: At the first circuit when the Primordial Heavenly Venerable spoke the Scripture, the east was filled with innumerable true great spirits, innumerable hosts floating in the air.

At the second circuit, the south was filled with innumerable true great spirits, innumerable hosts floating in the air.

At the third circuit, the west was filled with innumerable true great spirits, innumerable hosts floating in the air.

At the fourth circuit, the north was filled with innumerable true great spirits, innumerable hosts floating in the air.

At the fifth circuit, the northeast was filled with innumerable true great spirits, innumerable hosts floating in the air.

At the sixth circuit, the southeast was filled with innumerable true great spirits, innumerable hosts floating in the air.

At the seventh circuit, the southwest was filled with innumerable true great spirits, innumerable hosts floating in the air.

At the eighth circuit, the northwest was filled with innumerable true great spirits, innumerable hosts floating in the air.

At the ninth circuit, above was filled with innumerable true great spirits, innumerable hosts floating in the air.

At the tenth circuit, below was filled with innumerable true great spirits, innumerable hosts floating in the air.

“The Daoist Canon” says: The eastern An Tai Tang village is the World of Acceptance of Goodness; the southern Wan Li city is the World of Abandoned Worthies; the western Fu Tang continent is the World of Universal Practice; the northern Yu Dan wilderness is the World of Purity; the northeast Fu Ji village is the World of Eternal Peace; the southeast Yuan Fu field is the World of Worthy Use; the southwest Yan Fu village is the World of Benevolent Stillness; the northwest Fu De village is the World of Extended Worthies. The upper thirty-two heavens are the thirty-two heavens of the Profound Capital, Jade Metropolis, Purple Tenuity; the true beings below are the thirty-six palaces of the five sacred mountains, nine fortresses, cave abysses, water palaces, northern capital Luo Zheng, and subterranean true spirits.

When the ten circuits are completed, the true great spirits of the ten directions arrive together at one time. The men and women of one country incline their hearts in reverence; the coming hosts are as fine rain and dense mist, innumerable hosts, half the nation. The land is uneven and sunken, not to be restrained.

All ten directions come without appointment in unison. Fine rain and dense mist denote their multitude. “Yi” means overturning or inclined, like narrow land, incompatible with one another. This is the Dao Lord’s preface to the Heavenly Venerable’s circling Scripture preaching, and the ten directions’ turning towards him.

Then the Primordial Origin suspends a precious pearl,

Then the Heavenly Venerable reveals the image of the precious pearl, skillfully opening salvation, manifesting the sacred and distinguishing the mundane.

As large as a millet grain, in the void of the mystery, five zhang above the earth.

Millet is a minute object; the pearl is as small as this. The Heavenly Venerable manifests this pearl, the spatial distance in the void from the earth being five zhang. Such subtle principle cannot be spoken by pen. The Primordial millet pearl is fully possessed by everyone’s nature, but especially obstructed by the five desires, filling and expanding without departing, hence being suspended afar. If one can detach from the five desires, this single point of spiritual light illumines heaven and earth, how different from the Primordial millet pearl?

The Primordial Origin leads the heaven-born great spirits, supreme saints, mysterious acting true men, the infinite true great spirits of the ten directions, innumerable hosts—all enter within the pearl.

The Heavenly Venerable, compassionate, suspends the pearl to show people, first ascending into it to lead all true beings. The Dao Lord reveals the Heavenly Venerable’s skill in showing the pearl.

The heavenly beings look upward,

The Floating Li heavenly beings still have encumbrances, only able to gaze at the pearl, unable to enter from the manifest into the unmanifest.

Only see the bustling multitude entering the mouth of the pearl, upon entering the mouth of the pearl, whereabouts unknown.

The heavenly beings only see the throng of true beings entering the pearl’s mouth, no trace to be seen.

The country’s people disperse, the land returns to level, no more leaning or sinking.

The Dao is again concealed, the earth again returns to its origin.

Within the pearl, the Primordial Origin completes speaking the Scripture, the true beings supervise salvation, and hand it over to me.

After leading the true beings to ascend into the mystery and wonder within the pearl, the Heavenly Venerable transmits the Dao and speaks the Dharma. The Supreme Dao Lord personally undertakes his intention. Completion means perfect fulfillment. Supervising salvation means overseeing the opening of salvation.

At this time, joy and celebration are beyond words, all ritual matters are complete, the heavens again take their places, gathered together in stillness without residual sound. “Zhu” means briefly; “xi” means detailed. The Great Dao does not require brief or circuitous routes, but directly awakens the true mystery, thereby joy arises. Returning to place means all return to their original stations. Stillness means no sound to be heard. The Dao Lord manifests the differences among heavenly beings, saints, and mundane. At this time, heavenly and earthly beings encounter the Dharma method, universally obtain salvation, completing their original years without injury.

At that time in the Floating Li country, the heavenly beings were detained in form; though unable to enter within the pearl, yet encountering the Heavenly Venerable and taking advantage of this cause, all received salvation without interruption or harm. The lifespan of heavenly beings is but to comprehend the true permanence, then verify entry into the wondrous Dao of emptiness. The land inclines in reverence, all act with a good heart.

Throughout one country’s land, none does not turn towards it. They cultivate the twelve good deeds below.

Do not kill or harm, do not envy or resent, do not lie or steal, do not be greedy or desirous, do not hate or be angry; speech is without flowery adornment, mouth without evil words. These are the twelve good deeds. To break all life is killing; to injure all things is harm; to ruin a person’s success is envy; to be jealous of another’s victory is resentment; to stain without colour is lust; to take things unjustly is theft; to desire without satisfaction is greed; to rise with false intent is desire; to resent and detest others is hate; to deceive and harm oneself is arrogance; flowery speech is called adornment; rude speech is called evil words. All equal in compassion, different bones become kin.

Having removed the three karmas, the six roots are pure; one body is viewed as one, no great or small distinctions.

The country is peaceful and the people prosperous, rejoicing in happiness and peace.

Good causes mature, evil thoughts melt away. Country peaceful and without trouble, people rejoice in peace. If a person in the twelve hours of the day keeps heart and ground pure, equalizes self and other, without hate or anger, this is also the peace of the mind.

The Scripture first issues teachings to a country, for those with sincere hearts who observe rites and reverence, all obtain worldly salvation.

The Dao Lord says: I first received the Scripture from the Heavenly Venerable, then issued it throughout one country, universally teaching heavenly and earthly beings; those with past cultivation are born with rare form, revered in faith; from the mundane they cultivate, and can enter the sage. To save the world is to transcend the mundane world. This is the Dao Lord’s urging people to cultivate the twelve good deeds. Above is the Dao Lord’s preface to receiving the Scripture.

The Dao says: What is spoken by the Primordial Heavenly Venerable in the Scripture is the hidden rhyme and sound of the heavenly emperors’ inner names, also the taboo names of the demon kings, the hidden names of the myriad spirits, not the common words of the world.

The inner hidden rhyme means such as the emperor Yu, succession of the jade brightness till the great choice of the gate of method. The taboo names of demon kings mean such as Ba Yuan, Chou Bo, to Liu Ling Ba Chong. The hidden names of myriad spirits mean such as those who save beings and do not die in the middle, to Tao Kang and He Yan. These are all not the usual words of the mundane world. This is the Dao Lord’s detailed explanation of the Scripture’s utterances.

The Supreme Saint has become a True Man, penetrating the profound and subtle, able to exhaust its chapters. Reciting it ten times, the heavens chant remotely; ten thousand emperors arrange rites; rivers and seas are silent; mountains and hills hide clouds; sun and moon stop their light; the Dipper does not move; demons bind their forms; ghosts and spirits extinguish their brightness; corpses return to life; white bones become human.

The high heavens’ supreme saints all descend from the primordial qi of the Primordial Ancestor, hence can comprehend mysteries, exhaust subtleties, fully detail its intent. When the Heavenly Venerable circles ten times reciting it, the heavens afar hear and chant; the myriad emperors draw near and bow; the river and sea gods are silent to hear; mountain gods hide clouds to hear; the seven luminaries do not move but suspend light; demons bind their forms and vanish; the dead may return to the corpse; white bones may become humans. The Dao Lord’s preface to the middle grade persons reciting the Scripture’s cause and effect.

The earnest scholar reciting it ten times is served by the five emperors’ attendants; the three realms bow. Demons lose their eyes; ghosts’ brightness extinguished; salvation descends on the dying; dead are born again.

The sincere practitioner also so recites ten times; the five directions’ five emperors and myriad spirits all come to salute and protect him; demons and ghosts may be subdued; the dead may be reborn. The Dao Lord’s preface to the lower grade persons reciting the Scripture’s cause and effect.

The reason is that the scholar’s defilements are not yet cleansed; the body not yet penetrated truth; summoning the ten directions; authority not yet controlling heavenly governance; virtue able to subdue earth spirits, bind demons, but only to prevent death, cannot achieve rebirth. This is near. Nowadays learners’ minds are not stained by the six dusts, yet defilements not fully eliminated; bodies not yet penetrated the true profound; yet the ten directions already obey summons; authority not yet able to govern the seven heavenly administrations, but virtue can subdue earth spirits. Though body cannot transcend and be reborn, such a person may be freed from impermanence and prevent death. The Dao Lord’s preface to the lower grade persons reciting the Scripture’s cause and effect.

Light recitation of this chapter causes calamities; offerings and reverent rites bring prosperity. Generation after generation flourish in brightness; with good causes, ten thousand disasters do not touch; spirits guard the door.

Light recitation receives evil reward; reverent recitation receives good reward. In life, the door prospers; after death, descendants are many. Not only oneself without disaster but also having divine protection. The Dao Lord explains the sins and blessings of reverence and disdain.

This Scripture is honoured and wondrous, unrivalled in the Jade Metropolis, saving beings boundlessly, the ancestor of myriad Dao. Lofty and vast is the Great Brahma; virtue difficult to surpass.

The Jade Metropolis is the capital on Jade Mountain. The Great Brahma is the true source of Brahma. This Scripture’s Brahma black assembly forms and completes the merit of saving beings; how can it be described? Therefore it is alone above the Jade Metropolis. The Dao Lord summarizes this Scripture’s power as incomprehensible.

The Dao says: Whoever recites this Scripture ten times, all the heavens assemble. Countless ancestors and suffering ghosts all receive salvation, ascend the Vermilion Palace. All undergo nine years of transformation, reborn as noble persons. Generally, reciting the Scripture in all ten directions, all heavens come to witness, all kin of many kalpas obtain release; through refining salvation, they enter the noble rank. The Vermilion Palace is the southern world’s Vermilion Mound Fire Mansion, which has the flowing fire courtyard.

All who save the world are refined thoroughly in the Vermilion Palace to form the immortal bones. The rank has three classes: upper three years, middle nine years, lower twenty-four years. This refers to the middle class refining salvation. The Dao Lord’s preface to those who recite the Scripture, souls of the dead obtain salvation rank.

The diligent learner of the Scripture, when merits are full and virtue attained, all become spirits and immortals, flying and ascending the Golden Gate, roaming and feasting in the Jade Metropolis.

“Love of the heart” means fondness; this is to cultivate the heart by Spiritual Treasure. When功行圆满, the Seven Ancestors ascend together. The Purple-Gold Gate and White Jade Metropolis are all Great Luo Jade Clear realms. The Dao Lord’s preface to those who delight in功 is superior to mere reciting.

Advanced scholars who cultivate and recite this Scripture all immediately receive salvation and ascend to the Southern Palace.

The highest scholars having recited and cultivated are not confined to the Southern Palace rank but can directly ascend. The Dao Lord’s preface to those both cultivating and reciting is superior to those who merely delight in the Scripture.

People of the world who receive and recite the Scripture thus extend life and longevity; later they all attain the method of corpse liberation. The soul and spirit temporarily extinguish; without passing through hell, they immediately regain form and roam the vast void.

Those men and women of the world who receive and recite the Scripture shall surely have longevity in life; after death not subject to the netherworld but immediately regain form and perform corpse liberation; spirit and soul roam the great void. Corpse liberation means though the form dies, the spirit is not extinguished. The Dao Lord urges the world’s people to receive and recite for such cause and effect.

This Scripture is subtle and wondrous, universally salving endlessly; all heaven and earth beings receive blessings. Boundless blessings, life and death obtain grace.

This Scripture of salvation, merit is boundless; above for the heavens, below for all men; the living and the dead all rely on it. The Dao Lord summarizes that all who cultivate, recite, and uphold it surely obtain blessings.

Treasured by the upper heavens, not transmitted to later ages. The most sincere carry gold and treasure, pledging heart and heaven to transmit.

Those who sincerely cultivate the Dao and desire this Scripture must first establish faith, solemnly swear an oath, announce it to heaven and then transmit. This expresses the Scripture’s rarity. The Dao Lord declares its transmission must not be light.

Lightness, leakage, and disdain bring calamity to nine ancestors, long servitude under ghost officials.

Light negligence, leakage, disdain, and ease, for those not reverent and faithful, accumulates to harm nine ancestors; after death, serve ghost officials, as pushing sand and stones, filling mountains and seas, treading thunder chariots, shaking lightning fire, enduring such sufferings with no end in sight; this is called long servitude under ghost officials. The Dao Lord admonishes recipients not to be light and disdainful.

Attending the Scripture are the five emperors, each with twenty-four jade boys and jade girls, guarding and protecting the recipients’ bodies.

As soon as the Scripture is opened, divine guards appear. The five emperors each command twenty-four jade boys and jade girls to come guard. Jade boys and girls are pure cultivated beings without defilement. Five groups in total, five times twenty-four equals one hundred and twenty. The body refers to the recipient’s body. The Dao Lord describes that opening and reciting the Scripture immediately brings divine protection.

The Dao says: In the first month’s long fast, reciting this Scripture is for the departed souls of past generations to sever earth’s bonds and servitude, and ascend to the Southern Palace.

On the first month’s first day, the Heavenly Official bestows blessings; fasting and reciting this month may sever the long-standing suffering servitude of ancestors receiving punishment in the netherworld. Their souls and spirits may ascend to the Red Bright Heaven Palace and undergo Southern Prosperity’s refining salvation.

In the seventh month’s long fast, reciting this Scripture grants the body to become immortal; the heavens record names on yellow and white tablets, erasing death and adding life.

In the seventh month, the Middle Origin; Earth Official pardons sins. Fasting and reciting this month may enter the immortal ranks. The heavenly beings record names, registering those cultivated; the Northern Dipper erases the death register, the Southern Dipper notes the names of those born above.

In the tenth month’s long fast, reciting this Scripture is for kings, emperors, sovereigns, ministers, fathers, and sons’ peaceful reign, securing national longevity, eternal stability; always for human rulers to pacify their domains; the people call it peace.

In the tenth month, the Lower Origin; Water Official removes disasters. Fasting and reciting this month may secure the kalpa’s operation; sovereign and people obtain blessing.

On the eight seasonal festivals, reciting this Scripture grants the status of the Nine Palaces True Men.

Beginning of spring, vernal equinox, beginning of summer, summer solstice, beginning of autumn, autumn equinox, beginning of winter, winter solstice—these eight festivals. The “Book of Response and Recompense” says: on these days, the Three Officials and Nine Offices record crimes and blessings. Fasting and reciting on these eight festivals may increase good results. After death, spirits are born in the nine heavens. The Nine Palaces are the nine heavens palace of spirit generation.

On one’s birth day, reciting this Scripture purifies soul and spirit, all qi persists; no suffering or distress; the body shines with brightness; the three realms attend and guard; five emperors oversee reception; myriad spirits pay homage, names registered in the upper heavens;功 is full and virtue complete; one flies and ascends to Upper Clear.

Birth day means one’s own birth day. On this day, the body’s original spirit flies to report merits and faults. If the learner can fast and recite, then in life he has good strength; in death no evil fate. Sitting, the three realms attend and guard; walking, five emperors watch and welcome. Many perceive this, only observing the ancients say: the Dharma operates the primordial one qi, employing one’s own original spirit, thus can be understood by intention. This describes the three origins, eight festivals, and birth auspicious days, the cause and effect of practice and recitation. The Dao Lord’s preface to the scholar’s功 of cultivation and recitation.

The Dao says: On the day of Dao practice, one should bathe in fragrant water, fast, enter the chamber, face east, knock teeth thirty-two times, hear the thirty-two heavens above, and heartily bow thirty-two times.

From here on are the methods of cultivation and recitation. There is no need to read aloud, but only to hold this in imagination. The practitioner is to elaborate the Scripture. Bathe hair and body, fast the heart and hold precepts, intending to connect heavenly and earthly true qi. Enter the pure chamber facing east, greet the living qi and sit. Knocking the teeth is to gather all the body’s spirits and summon myriad spirits. Each knock corresponds to one heaven, holding self and bowing to the thirty-two heavenly emperors. From the Supreme Ancestor Heaven downward, each secretively recites the heavenly names, holding a vision of heavenly palaces, towers, imperial lords and attendants, solemnly following the heart’s kneeling and bowing, knowing the body’s sincere homage.

Close eyes and quietly contemplate, sitting amidst the three-coloured clouds of azure, yellow, and white qi.

Gather light and inwardly observe without miscellaneous false thoughts. The three-coloured clouds are the three realms’ profound primordial Brahma qi. Hold self sitting amid the three-coloured azure, yellow, and white qi.

Within and without are dense and dark, with Azure Dragon, White Tiger, Vermilion Bird, Black Tortoise, Lion, and White Crane arrayed left and right.

Inside penetrates the five viscera; outside fills a chamber, dense and merging, always surrounding the Scripture table. Hold azure qi issuing from the liver and eyes, transforming into Azure Dragon on the left. White qi from the lungs and nose, transforming into White Tiger on the right. Red qi from the heart and mouth, transforming into Vermilion Bird in front. Black qi from the kidneys and ears, transforming into Black Tortoise behind. Next hold Lion, a fierce beast, and White Crane, a pure bird, arrayed left and right.

Sun and moon illuminate, illuminating the chamber.

Two small holes behind the brows are the six harmonies’ residence; hold the sun and moon issuing from within. The sun issues from the left horn, purple-red light with nine rays; the moon from the right horn, yellow-white light with ten rays. One cloud says the left eye is the sun, the right eye the moon; within one chamber, golden purple light shines splendidly.

The round image arises at the nape, light shining in all directions, clearly manifest.

Hold the sun and moon’s light pouring into my nostrils, entering four inches behind the brain’s golden palace. The round image issues from the nape, as large as a carriage wheel, illuminating inside and outside, every part distinct as if seen by one’s own eyes.

Secret mantra says: according to the following summons the many spirits within the body arise.

Supreme Profound Origin, Supreme Dao Lord summons from my body the three or five 功曹, left and right officers and messengers, incense attendants jade boys, message bearers jade girls, five emperors’ direct talismans, direct day incense officials, each thirty-two persons come forth.

Silently hold within self and issue, each arrayed in decorum, solemnly arrayed left and right, front and back.

Opening and closing according to words, today is of auspicious celebration, long fast in pure hall, cultivation reaching Scripture, boundless salvation of beings.

Receiving the Dharma means to possess position. If not yet receiving the Dharma mirror, one says: disciple of the Dao, so-and-so, with utmost heart speaks; also worthy of note. If knowing the way of the three caverns’ covenant, see practice and say cultivation reaching Scripture. If not such person, say only pure hall reciting Scripture. If reciting for all under the ten directions, say boundless salvation of beings; if for one matter, say reciting Scripture for such matter.

I and A and B, turning Scripture and receiving birth, wish that what is revealed reaches thoroughly, directly commanding the supreme thirty-two heavens of the Primordial Origin Supreme Emperor.

“I and A and B” means if for oneself or others, say “I and so-and-so.” If considering oneself reciting, only use own name. Turning Scripture and receiving birth, if for others, say “I for so-and-so,” for the heart cannot be two. What matters is utmost sincerity, reaching the heavenly emperors above.

After prayers, draw qi thirty-two times, face east and recite Scripture.

Starting from Supreme Ancestor Heaven, each name is solemnly proclaimed, holding true qi of each heaven, like the brilliance of jade mist, flowing down to my body, drawing in by nose and mouth, flowing into the five viscera. Inside and outside is pure white, thus facing east to greet living qi and recite. The right orthodox Scripture preface above is the Dao Lord’s method for scholars’ cultivation and recital.

Commentary on the Supreme Mysterious Scripture of the Primordial Origin’s Boundless Salvation of Beings, Volume Middle  
By Xue Jizhao, Manifested Elder of Ice Lake of Jiujiang

This true Scripture is spoken by the Primordial Origin, hence named Primordial Origin Boundless Salvation of Beings, signifying the Primordial Origin’s opening of boundless salvation by this Scripture.

Primordial Origin’s Cave Profound, Spiritual Treasure original chapter,

The Primordial Heavenly Venerable spoke this Scripture to reveal the profound Dao of the three Caverns. The Dao Lord received the Primordial Origin’s Cave Profound mandate, making it the foundation of Spiritual Treasure cultivation of truth, unfolding and forming chapters. This refers to the Scripture’s two chapters, upper and lower.

Supreme Mysterious Beginning, ten times salvation, one hundred demons’ hidden rhyme, separation and union natural.

These two chapters are the head of all supreme mysteries, the purpose of the Primordial Origin’s tenfold preaching of the Scripture. The words are all secret meanings of one hundred demons; gathered they are the primary text; dispersed they form the script; one separation and one union, all natural. This is the Scripture’s small preface.

Chaos Cave Crimson Script, no highest truth.

Below speaks of the ancestral kalpa’s opening and transformation hand.

At the beginning of Chaos, the hollow qi, after many kalpa fires, refined into crimson script. The Heavenly Venerable, in the void, regards this crimson script as the foundation for the highest true beings to save beings. The Primordial ancestral kalpa transforms and produces the heavens.

Dragon Han, Red Brightness, Supreme Emperor, Extended Peace, Opening Emperor, all are kalpa names. The ancestral kalpa is the primal kalpa. To transform and produce the heavens means from the Dragon Han primordially clear ancestral qi to open and transform.

Opening the bright three scenes, this is the root of heaven.

The ancestral kalpa of Jade Clarity gives rise to one black and becomes Upper Clear; two blacks give rise to three and become Supreme Clear; three qi give rise to nine blacks and produce the nine heavens. Above the nine heavens are further thirty-two heavens, each with a sun, moon, and star, called the three scenes. Opening means to reveal; bright means light; root of heaven means the Primordial ancestral qi is the root of transforming and producing the heavens.

Above no further ancestor, only Dao as body.

From the Primordial Origin upwards, no further original ancestor, only this Dao as body. This means all myriad laws arise from the Primordial’s own origin.

Five scripts open wide, universally planting spirits.

The Chaos Cave Crimson Script, after kalpa fire forming the chapters, unfolds into the qi of five heavens, transforming into the script of five qi. From the void arises all existence, the three realms’ spirits universally arise from this crimson script and are established.

No script without light, no script without brightness, no script without establishment, no script without completion, no script without salvation, no script without birth.

Therefore heaven and earth and myriad things without this crimson script would not shine, not be bright, not establish, nor complete; would not open salvation nor be born and transformed. Formerly the heavenly true emperor said: Without the Chaos Cave Crimson Script, one cannot contain and transform the nine bright yang heavens, saving and attaining heavenly realms.

This is the great Brahma heaven within heaven.

The above all speaks of the ancestral kalpa, the great Brahma of Chaos, fusing and forming crimson script, opening and transforming the heavens. This Jade Clarity heaven is the highest among all heavens.

Yuluo Xiao Terrace, Jade Mountain Capital.

Beneath this heaven is Jade Capital Mountain, opposite Kunlun Mountain; surrounding more than eight hundred li, atop is the realm of Yuluo Xiao Terrace.

Highest utmost, Great Luo Jade Clarity.

These are all the brahma formed by the fusion of the kalpa, the supreme utmost unbounded greatest Great Luo Jade Clarity realm.

Subtle and minute kalpas, as if existing and not.
