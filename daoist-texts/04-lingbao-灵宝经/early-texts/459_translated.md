# Precepts of the Original Truth

The Discourse on the Precepts of the Original Truth says:

'He who is able to receive and hold these precepts, does not merely desire that men should exhaust their hearts and their natures; but also desires that men should know their destiny and know Heaven, to be in the world without being of the world, and to be clear within themselves through self-examination. This truly aids the kingly transformation, and corrects men in the many virtues. The precepts of the Law are nothing else than the study of rectifying the heart and making the intention sincere; the methods within the precepts are the transformation of governing the state and ordering the family. It is only desired that men should follow the text strictly and uprightly, and thereby know the profound mystery… manifesting the kingly law in the clear, and the Way’s law in the hidden; the law of the Way governs the self, the kingly law governs men; these two are exterior and interior, to sustain the teaching of the world.

Nowadays, men know only the kingly code of law, without understanding the law of the precepts; others know only the law of the precepts, without knowing the kingly code of law—this is called partial and mistaken view… As for that which is called ‘original,’ it means the beginning; ‘truth’ means without falseness; ‘precept’ means prohibition. It is said that in the beginning men have the true nature without falseness, originally by the destiny of Heaven, without thought and without action, spontaneously and naturally, with no good to cultivate and no evil to commit. Therefore it is said: "To do good without seeking fame, to do evil without fearing punishment; use the governor as the thread and classic, so as to preserve the body, to complete life, to nourish parents, and to exhaust the years."

Myriad laws arise from the self-nature; one thought of thought and reflection preserves the transformations. When thought and reflection produce evil, they transform into the evil ghosts of hell; when thought and reflection cultivate good, they transform into the benevolent spirits of heaven. Lewdness transforms into dogs and swine; violence into rhinoceros and tigers. Envy transforms into snakes and scorpions; kindness into sages and worthies. Gentlemen and mean men are all in one thought of reflection; the nature changes accordingly, hence it is said: "A hundred thousand million transformations of the body." When men are confused and know not the Way, have not heard the scriptures, have not met the master, and the knot of doubt is not yet untied, the mirror of wisdom not yet opened, they cannot reflect or be alert; their light is obscured, their hearts unrestrained, their thoughts incessant and thought not returning. All are enveloped by the ten evils of greed, anger, ignorance, lewdness, killing, theft, evil speech, frivolous talk, double tongue, and false words, together with the dust-like external conditions that disturb body and mind. This causes the six faculties to act erroneously, gladly enduring the driving toil and suffering, wandering in birth and death without rest. Now, by self-reflection, returning to the Way, returning to the scriptures, returning to the master—the threefold refuge and precepts—cleansing the heart and repenting. Repentance means to atone for past faults. All the past ten evils, the deeds of ignorance, attachment, deceit, jealousy, and other sins, are all entirely repented and prohibited, never to arise again; remorse means to be sorry for future faults. From now on, all the ten evils, the deeds of ignorance, attachment, deceit, jealousy, and other sins, now awakened to, are all forever cut off, never to arise again. Without thought and without action, not a single thought arising, returning once more to the original beginning of boundless natural true nature, restoring the original destiny of Heaven; thus it is called the Ten Precepts of the Original Truth.

… Therefore, those who use and wear the precepts do nothing else but employ matters to seize the heart, in order to exhaust the original nature, restrain the nature by conditions, and thus complete the ordinary heart. Hence the man who labours for the Way, if he does not seek the precepts as his master, nor hold the precepts as his life, is a man who does not understand the nature and principle, does not comply with the destiny of Heaven, and does not observe the sacred teaching.'
