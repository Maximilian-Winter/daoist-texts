# The Nine Precepts of the Nü-jen

1. To be filial and respectful, gentle and harmonious; to speak with care and without envy.  
2. To be chaste and preserve the body; to abstain from base conduct.  
3. To borrow all things from the Mandate; to be compassionate and to refrain from killing.  
4. To be diligent and cautious in reciting the rites; to renounce flesh and wine.  
5. To have plain and simple clothing and belongings; to avoid gaudy adornments.  
6. To regulate and adapt the temper; to give no place to vexation.  
7. Not to attend fasting assemblies in numbers.  
8. Not to maltreat slaves or servants.  
9. Not to steal the possessions of others.

These nine precepts of the Nü-jen, if followed as the way of women, as by faithful daughters, and held fast without backsliding, will bring great benefit; one will not suffer the pains of hell, but be born among families of the ten virtues. Further, if one can strive earnestly to cultivate and maintain them, perfecting the fruit of the precepts, one’s name will ascend to the Purple Mansion, and one’s rank be set among the company of immortals.
