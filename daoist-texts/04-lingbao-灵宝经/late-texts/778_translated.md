# Precious Ordinance of the Southern Pole

With devoted heart I bow and surrender myself in reverence.  
The Lofty and Supreme Spirit of the Heavenly Firmament’s Abode,  
Who condenses the spirit and brilliantly illumines the Palace,  
Uniting the primal ancestor’s breath to divide the true.  
Responding to the wondrous Dao of emptiness and non-being and thus unfolding transformation,  
His station is above the nine heavens,  
Presiding over the myriad heavens,  
Encompassing the ten extremities of the universe.  
He governs the myriad transformations,  
Proclaiming the Golden Talisman and shedding light to succour suffering,  
Bestowing grace and nurturing the myriad living beings.  
His favour extends throughout the primal origin,  
His benevolence spreads through vast kalpas,  
Great is His compassion and mighty His vow,  
Great is His saintship and boundless His mercy.  
The True King of Jade Purity,  
The Southern Pole’s Long-lived Great Emperor,  
Sovereign of the Primordial Heaven, the Sacred and Venerable.
