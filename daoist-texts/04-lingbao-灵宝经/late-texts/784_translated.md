The Dongxuan Lingbao Five Elders’ Summoning of the Northern Feng Ghosts and Demons: The Red Script Jade Formula

This Red Script is the essential key for those who study the Way. Alas, its original text is incomplete and awaits further collation and supplementation.

The Lingbao Eight Majesty Divine Strategy Formula

The vermilion writing calls upon the Three Heavens’ Supreme Ones to summon and subdue the flood dragons, tigers, leopards, and mountain spirits, inscribed upon a silver wooden tablet. Another tablet records the date, and the teacher’s surname and given name, also placed upon a tablet. The two tablets are combined and enclosed in a pouch. The vermilion writing next to the text is set upon a third tablet, placed outside the pouch. In all, three tablets are sealed as the Divine Strategy, as the tradition shows.

All the tablets are of silver wood, one foot four inches long, and two inches four fen wide. A pouch is made of crimson patterned silk, one zhang two chi in length. The tablets are covered, and sealed upon the outer tablet. At the lower end is impressed the seal of the Five Elders of the Primordial Origin within the mouth.

One should use a cypress box, covered with crimson silk, and place the Strategy Text inside in a separate chamber. Burn incense on either side, attending with a pure heart and spirit, receiving the text to wear on the person. The gods and spirits of all under Heaven attend morning and evening at the gateway, providing each of the Five Emperors’ jade youths and jade maidens with twelve attendants. When they go out or come in to traverse, the Five Emperors guard them; the Three Realms govern the reception; birth and death no longer suffer the three evils; without passing through Mount Tai, they ascend directly to the Nine Heavens, food and clothing come naturally, their rank equal with the Great Ultimate, and they thereby become immortals.

The Daoist who receives and studies the Way, wearing this text, performs the divine incantations. By pointing the Strategy Text to Heaven, the heavenly gods descend. Pointing to the earth, the earth spirits pay homage; the Three Realms are bound and girded. Pointing to the gods, they salute the gods; pointing to ghosts, the ghosts destroy themselves. Pointing to water, the water spirits respond. At the great calamity’s turning, the floods and four meetings, the Strategy summons dragons, which bear their burdens. Through long cultivation and accumulation of feeling, the divine spirits assemble; wherever the summons is made, it rises forth and stands ready. A thousand changes and myriad transformations follow at will. In going forth and returning, their rank accords with the Great Ultimate; all are preceded by flying dragons, followed by the Heavenly Balance; the phoenix cries and the luan sings; twelve splendours shine forth the two seven-coloured banners, the flag of the life spirit. After nine years of concentrated thought, the heavenly apparatus is complete.
