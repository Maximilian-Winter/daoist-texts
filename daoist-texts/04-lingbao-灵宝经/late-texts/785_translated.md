# The Wondrous Scripture of the Flight Art of Elixir Water of the Spirit Treasure of the Cavern Mysterious, the Transport and Passage through the Lesser Kalpa

The name of the scripture: The Wondrous Scripture of the Flight Art of Elixir Water of the Spirit Treasure of the Cavern Mysterious, the Transport and Passage through the Lesser Kalpa. The author is unknown; roughly traced to the Southern and Northern Dynasties. The catalogues of the Spirit Treasure Scriptures have not recorded it. One scroll. The base text is from the Corrected Daoist Canon, section on the Cavern Mysterious.

The Supreme Great Dao Lord said: The Primordial Heavenly Honoured One said, 'When the great kalpa of the bright radiance and empire of the great world comes to an end, its radiance is boundless, its light without limit, and cannot be at rest. The sun and moon cannot illuminate it, the constellations cannot mark it; there is neither above nor below, no point of reliance or approach; its number is hard to exhaust.'

The Dao says: 'Without above or below, all-encompassing and convergent, light reaching the measureless paths, sinking into the void and mystery. The two share the same name, thought and conception vast and silent, returning and again the same, ending in the mysterious circle; above it strikes the utmost summit, beneath it sinks into fine dust; to the left it reaches the vast azure, to the right it communicates with myriad rivers. The great net covers the array, the Dipper severs and connects with the darkness. The Sovereign of the Mysterious Capital, the Spirit Movement revolves and conceals; great mountains and rocky valleys are all turned over and united. The Six Perfections having been cultivated, the Brahmanic conduct in dual places, ascending the gates of the heavens, the heavenly traces vast and clear, the root of void and non-being profound. Minor movements flow about, transport and passage open the origin; the rotations of the heavens turn, the fiery periods unite; the numbers corresponding to the lands also lightly turn over. The heavens are high without limit at the cavern’s source. The heavens use the soaring tree as the proper framework; the earth uses man and bird, dwelling among the fiery smoke. When the kalpa transport arrives, it constructs the high heavens above, transporting and passing from the heavens without ceasing the dark gates. Thereupon the record of many spirits is noted, called the number of the intersection of heaven and earth; the lesser kalpa is already intersected. The Primordial Heavenly Honoured One measures this number of the rotation and intersection, being altogether three hundred and sixty thousand kalpas, which is called the lesser celestial wind passage, the intersection of the lesser kalpa. The great heavens number three thousand nine hundred and sixty, encompassing the small heavens of the ten directions. Each heaven is governed by a perfect person, each has ten-directional perfect persons; once in three hundred years passing through, circling about this soaring tree and man-bird mountain, this is called the lesser celestial transport intersection of the lesser kalpa cycle. The perfect persons emerge from the centre of the present heaven out of the great heavens. The great heavens have three thousand nine hundred and sixty great kalpas; the bright radiance perfect person performs the rites of this heaven completely, called the lesser kalpa transport cycle.

The Primordial and Bright Radiance Perfect Persons said: There are hundreds of billions of great heavens in the heavens, hundreds of billions of caverns in the earth. One heaven endures three hundred and sixty thousand kalpas, the years fully expended, called a lesser heaven. This heaven has perfect persons of the great cavern township. At the time of the lesser kalpa transport cycle, it returns to its establishment; the stars of the five constellations, the five Dippers, the seven registers, the chief star Kuau begin their formation; the sun and moon shine brightly, the heavenly origin newly established. At that time the Mysterious Passage appears and transforms; the Dao flows in response. Lady Purple Spirit emerges from the Spirit Shining Heaven, with about ten flying celestial maidens, who seek far the Mysterious Passage. At that time they are at the Five Mountains, suppressing the fiery smoke, clearing and dispelling calamities, subduing all evils. The heavenly beings seeing the Mysterious Passage respond in the ten utmost voids with ritual.

The Lady said: In ancient times before the kalpa transport was intersected, the Heavenly Honoured True One already beheld and the Mysterious descended with its words, unfolding the ancient Spirit Treasure scriptures and their subsidiary scrolls, storing them in the great cavern mysterious township. Those with immortal bones saw the scripture texts. Afterwards there was the Supreme Ultimate Perfect Person, before attaining the Dao, who constantly dwelt in the world, roaming mountains to gather herbs. From seven years old travelling to ninety, never killing living beings, often cultivating the scriptures of the world, making the Laozi’s Dao and Virtue Scriptures his study, penetrating the subtle and internal. The divine and true universally fulfilled, wherever he roamed, not questioning the dark mountains and deep valleys, the dense forests and rocky hills, the places of precipitous ravines. Later in the warrior man’s mountain cave, he saw the Primordial Lord, obtained the traces of the Dao attained, the eight plain bands of true writings and wondrous scriptures, The Supreme Cavern Mysterious Spirit Treasure Lesser Kalpa Transport Number Wondrous Scripture. Students should impart it to their disciples, so that the numbers of heaven and earth in transport and conjunction reach their end; the Mysterious Passage descends again, fearing the great number is about to come, how can it be passed? This is the sight of the lesser kalpa.

The Primordial Heavenly Honoured One said to the Mysterious Passage Perfect Person: The numbers follow one hundred and six; born at the end of the transport, at that time is a man of immortal bones; I myself teach to him methods to transcend the body. The student should constantly seek to pass through fiery disasters; those who deliver from smoke and affliction should study the three caverns wondrous scriptures, establish the Spirit Treasure fasting rites. If among men, then erect a high seat and precious canopy, splendid lamps and incense machines, morning rites six times a day, one meal at noon. If forsaking worldly duties afar in mountain forests and deep valleys, practicing fasting rites and standing alone in the Dao, long fasting by only swallowing breath and swallowing elixir, constantly sitting upright, holding the left hand towards the North Pole star, saying: At a certain auspicious time in the month of Jia, establish a field of blessing, wishing the Northern Pole Supreme to transport the form of Jia. Close breath with three breaths, perform this six times daily, and one obtains the true way. When the heavenly transport lesser kalpa intersects, the Mysterious Passage Perfect Person employs this secret text of nine talismans to pass it.

The Primordial said: The nine talismans are nine chapters. They correspond to the Supreme Nine Strategies text, receiving the Spirit Treasure talisman, wearing these nine talisman water texts, which are the Cavern Mysterious Spirit Chapters. Recite and chant the scripture while wearing them on the person. The elixir script and plain registers circle the talisman; place them in a pouch and respectfully carry them to remove the lesser kalpa intersection; this is secret.

The Primordial Heavenly Honoured One unfolds the Supreme Cavern talisman nine chapters.

The secret talisman texts are the Supreme Cavern Mysterious Hidden Strategies. The student wears them on the person, constantly chanting these nine chapter sounds, and the true way descends by itself.

The Primordial Heavenly Honoured One said: The three elements are Purple Essence, Yellow Essence, and White Essence. Now each is a Supreme Cavern Mysterious Spirit One Perfect Person; the three essences combine into the three perfect persons, forever leading the present governance.

The scripture says: The Spirit Treasure Dharma Masters establish fasting rites and robes; the ritual skirt is of yellow cloth, with an inner garment of clay pellet brocade. The clay pellet brocade’s upper part bears a blue horizontal band as a cape, and yellow silk as a turban. Neither cold nor heat changes the Dao; this is always taken as the ritual garment, continually guarded by divine males and jade females.

The scripture says: The ritual robes, if in mountain forests and secluded places, establishing fasting rites, their skirts, brown turbans, and capes are all made of deer skin. Yet they must not fast as ordinary people do; if the worldly learner should follow the scripture, he must not wear the mountain learning ritual robes and wander out among men; the worldly clothes may not enter mountain forests. Also, this would violate scripture and break the precepts; the great true gods of the heavens watch the loss of observance and law, and laugh at the demon kings; the proper gods do not respond, the mysterious truths do not arrive. In former ancient times, before the Supreme Excellent Heavenly Perfect Person attained the Dao, he observed the Spirit Treasure rites but did not follow the ritual and rules, wearing the mountain learning robes and wandering out among men; the true Dao was nearing completion, as one royal family fasting; thus this ritual robe violated precepts and undermined the true Dao. Later he became the perfect person of the Five Mountains, now therefore in the world. When the lesser kalpa numbers are exhausted, this perfect person attains a kalpa height of one ren, from this true secret precept violating the nine passes of heaven and earth, passing the lesser transport ten times; when the transport desires to cycle, this perfect person roams the spiritual mountains, not yet having ascended the ten voids; thus this ritual robe is not made according to ritual norms. Scholars, take heed. When the heavenly transport lesser degree has passed ten times, this perfect person again becomes a perfect person among the ten-directional numbers in concealment.

The scripture says: There is another Dharma Master cultivating the Cavern Mysterious fasting rites; therefore his trace is not extinct. He supports the treasure scripture in the world, governs precepts and cultivates Dao work, having accumulated time. Mistakenly wearing worldly ritual robes into the mountains, he thereby does not attain the Dao. At that time also there were three jade maidens, wearing nine-stitched embroidered capes, purple silk sashes, hair tied in triple horn knots, upper head wearing orchid embroidered turbans, feet wearing shoes crossed with dragon nine patterns, hands holding transport spiritual banners, burning elixirs blending nine colours and incense. They sport and laugh, saying: The heavenly transport is about to end, who can understand it? Here is an ancient immortal who sees these jade maidens as not ordinary persons; he therefore bows his head to make obeisance. The jade maidens at first do not look upon him, saying: You are an ancient wise lord, why suddenly do you make obeisance? The jade maidens then rise, wandering and uneasy. Then two more jade maidens come, each holding a scroll of wondrous scripture, saying: Lady Purple Star sends us to hold these eight lines, coming from the centre of heaven, not to connect with worldly persons. The scripture text is secret and not to be disclosed.

The Bright Radiance Perfect Person discourses on the numbers of heaven and earth, the large and small kalpas finished, fearing that afterwards no more seed people shall exist, and thus composes the lesser kalpa transport, saying that those who have contracted to pass are true, and to cultivate and study the secret. The eight seasonal days are the times to cast jade tablets for use.

The Bright Radiance Perfect Person’s Hymn for the Transcendence of Seed People through the Kalpa

Rotating past the cycle, ritual passing through emptiness. Ascending to the Spirit Cloud constellation, descending into the abyssal subtle palace. The dwelling is round and square above; meditating in the treasure chamber township. The counting is not excessive; the heavenly transport’s plain words are remote. The palace of flourishing origin is established; the eight extremes constantly come and go. The three are of one contract; ritual transformation comes not late. The six directions come and go; the world’s blessing is long and great. The golden horse’s brilliant essence is flourishing; its words will bring about peaceful times. Who marks the path of wisdom? Reflecting on origin inside and out. The framework and order all exhaust at once; the number one hundred and six intersect. The rotation and flow of the three essences are seen; honoured by the heavenly emperor. The past has formed no seed; the heaven and earth’s transport will overturn. How can one obtain passage? Looking up, remembering the Spirit Treasure’s words. Responsive influence can pass calamities, grasping the season chanting jade chapters.

At the time of transport by the Bright Radiance Perfect Person, having finished this hymn, he summoned the Wind Elder and many heavens, small heavens, and heavenly spirits to assemble; the term was ended; new small heavens were created and established. The perfect persons now divide forms, becoming ten heavens’ great heavenly honoured ones, roaming and observing the five turbid Spirit Treasure ten extreme perfect persons. Now those who properly teach and transform the scripture and Dharma to attain truth should become these ten-directional perfect persons. Although the text is not yet obtained, during the day they soar and fly, seeing the Dharma and then turning the wheel, to become the minor heavenly perfect persons.

The Primordial Heavenly Honoured One said: The lesser kalpa is the perfect person’s three completions of the ultimate heaven; the heavenly numbers intersect the earth; the earth’s numbers universally assemble, hence called the lesser kalpa transport. At that time, the sun, moon, and stars all perish of themselves; the land’s beams and frameworks have no root or origin. Then the three Bright Perfect Lords transform and deliver many lesser saints who have not attained truth, fearing the present transport is ending. They say formerly there was one Mysterious Passage person, born naturally from the nine recesses of the empty subtlety, spontaneously transformed, with radiant visage like a young child, holding the eight divisions Supreme Origin Cavern Tranquil Spirit Treasure two essence true scriptures; he ascended to proclaim to the Five Mountains, suppressing past calamities and disasters, arriving to pacify the fiery smoke and organize the universe, sitting in the eight trigrams and establishing records, imparted to the Supreme Ultimate Perfect Person. He opened the three sages for joyous observation; the transport passed him. One jade maiden holds one scroll suppressing the fiery weeping stream of the lesser kalpa jade characters, said to have been given to the morning township heavenly man Xia Yu. He may serve as the teaching of all heavens at times of great disaster, having passed before. The ancient immortal now becomes the Supreme Ultimate, presiding over the record of those who obtain immortality.

The scripture says: The perfect person before the time of Yao received the heavy net heaven jade maiden to suppress fire and mark smoke lesser kalpa wondrous scripture, now sinking to teach methods to deliver the body. This scripture is:

Circling around, the framework is destroyed, the mountains and seas hidden, the mighty deity arrives. Leaving and returning, the sun and moon are eclipsed, the chief star Kuau transforms, now it has arrived.

The Primordial Heavenly Honoured One said: The Great Mystery has six Stems of the Earthly Branches, widespread and clear and pure, responding to rotation without end, teaching observation of the distant void, ascending high above, precipitous and boundless, ten voids without standing, vast and empty wandering, dark kalpa moving and passing, five stars incomplete, constellations overturned, rotation and numbers finished, sun and moon without light, yang fluid disharmonious, time responding losing qi, heaven and earth leaking, five mountains sunk and vanished, blessed lands flooded mounds, obtaining passage to the shady cool, converging to become the past. The three realms fly about; at that time the peoples are all absent; great true heavens refine the bones of passage to unite with the Dao; recording the name Yellow Essence. Thus when the numbers exhaust, the cavity is empty; the cavity unites with emptiness and establishes the great township, approaching the ten voids without cliffs. The Northern Pole’s past and future great number, together with the great number, enters the expedition emptiness; numbers empty create void; its name is hard to exhaust.

The Great Net Perfect Person said: The Dao may be spoken of as Dao, but is not always to be discoursed upon. The recorded words form a name, but may also be nameless; it is to be called hidden. The lower three return to the void; the great enters the spaciousness; the fine reaches the unfathomable; moving secretly in the empty township, shining in the cavernous palace; the four rivers are the cavern gates; the past dwelling is the great township of refining immortals.

The Primordial Supreme Ultimate Perfect Person and the Mysterious Passage Perfect Person, at the lesser kalpa cavern gate, unfold the way of exhausting transport, recording the cavern township mountains; the mountains have cavern heavens, the cavern heavens have four gates, these are the great cavern gates; upon reaching these gates, the student obtains passage.

The Supreme Great Dao Lord said: The Primordial Heavenly Honoured One said, the great and lesser kalpa transport comes to an end, the time of passage approaches; the Dao Lord therefore speaks of the birth of names and different streams, species multiplying one another; the high dwell on their summit, the low return to their base. The great return and rest, one origin as their circle; the lesser fixed entering the subtle; the origin is within the centre. Dividing forms and being born, some dwell high or low, some enter the great or lesser and are born, some are born of roots established, some are born of embryo and pregnancy, some born of waxing and waning, some born of transformation naturally, some born in void and no breath. At first no form or shadow appears, sinking into seclusion and born; such as these, each has blessings in response, all coming from transformation, all following their origin. When the numbers exhaust, those with many blessings do not; their passage is unbroken, following the species as they begin to live; if rooted and born, their light and beauty increase. Like the tree of seven jewels’ register born in the Spirit Treasure country’s seven jewel forest; the many immortals and great saints come to observe and illuminate. When the great and lesser kalpas are exhausted, cycling and transforming, attaining the human way. Cultivating the writings and purposes, one sees the many truths, the Spirit Treasure’s radiance shining, universally suspended in ten persons. If embryo transformation, previous lives’ blessings are great, obtaining birth in the embryo, having form and body, soul and spirit joined, naturally following the words of the Supreme Emperor. The Primordial Heavenly Honoured One and the High Supreme Old Lord, at the Mysterious Capital Upper Township Jade Capital Shaoshi, unfold the supreme cavern mysterious spirit treasure thirty-six divisions wondrous treasure upper scriptures. At that time the High Supreme Old Lord, using the calculation of having primordial emptiness’s longevity and limitless numbers, not yet reaching the Supreme Emperor, world cycles turning, blessings and fate desirous to intersect, transformations changing, cycles rotating, ascending the kalpa height, stars dividing and breaking, constellations renewing, five mountains changing, directions changing and settling, four rivers cleared, seas becoming mountains, waters becoming great stones, insects flying and stirring all living beings, suddenly passing like thirty-two thousand kinds of people. The Primordial Old Lord unfolds five thousand script Dao and Virtue upper, middle, and lower scriptures, three caverns true texts, many essential wondrous scriptures, teaching and transforming later learners. Its words say:

White Stone Lord, of empty surname. At Man Bird Mountain, receiving the study method of four hundred thousand words. Remaining at this mountain, establishing fasting and uprightness, vegetable and plain midday meal, repenting sins and blessings, opening passage for all, seeking release from the calamity world, attaining peace. Morning rites to all heavens, paying homage to the ten directions. Looking up to the Mysterious Truth, Brahmanic assembly of many heavens, eight kinds of sounds, burning incense and lamps, reciting, rotating ritual, ten extremes remembering the Dharma, meditating and dispatching floating evil, discoursing on the utmost wondrous, accumulating study six hundred years, returning to the Mysterious Capital Warrior Man Mountain northern chamber. Studying again two hundred years, on the twenty-fourth day of the fifth month of the year Jiawu, the Spirit Treasure responded to see, suddenly seven jewel flying celestial beings twelve persons, riding on the clouds’ chariot, from beneath the nine mysterious platforms, immediately taking positions to welcome the Vast Void Primordial Lord, White Stone Empty Cavern Perfect Person, lightly flying and ascending, constructing nine clouds, teaching and transforming many immortals, learning the true immortal’s arts and methods. On the first year of the Supreme Emperor, ninth month tenth day, the Turtle Mountain King’s Lady came to receive the eight births primordial record upper scriptures eight scrolls. The Red Pine Master on the fifth day of the tenth month of the same year received the great cavern treasure chapter thirty-six divisions wondrous scriptures, three caverns true method Dao and Virtue essentials and precepts at the Mysterious Capital Treasure City Mountain, breaking gold and casting fish, dragon hooking, ascending the altar with one treasure faith as pledge. Using flying cloud brocade one hundred feet, jade tablets two pieces, golden dragons two, fish one pair, swords twenty-four sets, white essence forty feet, five direction bright mirrors to pass the text. At that time Brahmanic many heavens, eight kinds of sounds, composing three contract hymns, receiving study and thereby obtaining the true immortal’s way, speaking and leading the kalpa height mysterious cavern palace, called the Empty Cavern Primordial One Lord, Great Light Lord, Old Lord, Supreme One Lord’s dwelling township; at the boundless and abyssless subtle images monitoring demon kings; in the great thousand three caverns originally had Supreme Essence true method, Spirit Treasure robes treasure method most wondrous. One called Empty Cavern True Guard, Great Cavern Fasting Method, Plain Spirit Praise Scripture as hymn, making the Brahmanic Heaven mysterious sound fasting method, Jade Capital Mountain Scripture Floating Void Hymn, Brahmanic Heaven Sound Mysterious Fasting Method, Eight Plain Yin Yang Scriptures, Central China Sound Great Cavern Fasting Method; vanishing traces cliff concealment, far fleeing the world, long fasting, taking food, swallowing original and filling qi, not joining worldly ways. Those not observing such fasting and food prolongation differ in lecturing. The ten directions’ supreme saints and heavenly honoured ones observe men’s good and evil, called High Supreme Utmost True Mysterious Wondrous Fasting Method. Establishing fasting and standing alone in the Dao, the Vast Void Primordial Lord at Man Bird Mountain received the Supreme Cavern Brahmanic Heaven Majesty Brahmanic Heaven Great Precepts, repenting to countless ancestors, fathers and mothers seven generations, birth and death, sins and blessings, cycles of transformation and embryo birth afflictions, wishing to long dwell in non-action, burning incense and lamps. One meal at noon, six times a day repenting all before and after, ancestors and grandparents of mystery, all attain ascending to heaven, transforming and being born in the ten directions, walking with the Mysterious Capital. Reciting the three cavern true texts, at that time the Spirit Treasure Perfect Person cloud light descended, ten extreme flying celestial beings spirit males and jade females about ten persons each, Brahmanic many sounds and seven jewel radiance shining brilliantly in the Jade Capital, reciting the three contract Brahmanic Heaven hymns. Ten extreme perfect persons each chant one contract, Brahmanic Heaven hymns by flying celestial beings spirit males and jade females jointly present a poem; the Vast Void Primordial Lord then descends and worships the heavenly honoured one, thereby receiving the poem saying: The wondrous high true of the chapter spirit, the Primordial Lord regards it as best. The Vast Void Primordial Lord replies in the mystery with one poem, then suddenly vanishes. Where all the truths direct, White Stone Lord learned the truth.
