# The Scripture of Wandering in Emptiness on the Jade Capital Mountain of the Mysterious and Numious Treasure

Title of the Scripture: The Scripture of Wandering in Emptiness on the Jade Capital Mountain of the Mysterious and Numious Treasure. Also named "The Chapter of Ascending the Profound and Wandering in Emptiness." The author is unknown; it was composed about the Eastern Jin dynasty. It is a part of the ancient Scripture of the Numious Treasure. One scroll. The original source: The Continued Daoist Canon.

The Jade Capital Mountain of the Mysterious Metropolis lies above the Three Pure Ones; it is without colour and without dust. Above there is the Jade Capital, the Golden Palace, the Seven Treasures, the Mysterious Terrace, the Purple Tenuity Supreme Palace; within it are the Three Treasures’ Divine Scriptures. On the eight sides of the mountain arise naturally seven-treasure trees; on each side grows one, the eight trees fill the eight directions, covering the heavens, encompassing the Three Realms. This is under the governance of the Most High Great Luo Heaven, the Supreme Limitless Emptiness Sovereign Heavenly Venerable. The mountain, its groves and palaces, all are recorded in the registers of the holy hosts of heaven. The holy emperors and kings of heaven, exalted immortals and perfected men without number, thrice each month ascend there to offer sacrifice; they burn natural sandalwood which returns to the spirit with fragrance; flying immortals scatter flowers, revolving thrice around the Seven Treasures Mysterious Terrace, chanting the songs of the void. At that time the heavens perform music, tens and hundreds of thousands of musicians, their sounds clear and penetrating; true consorts sing in unison with measured cadence; immortal children look solemn and sing sweetly; jade maidens advance slowly with graceful motions; they release gentle movements and flow with dance lightly, most majestic and dignified. On the mountain are groves of seven-treasure flowers, their light bright and splendid, their red fruit sparkling; all are of gold and silver, pearls and jade, crystal, glaze, agate, and turquoise. The numinous wind stirs them, and their sound forms its own musical scale, elegant and exquisite beyond compare. The heavens hear the sound and soar aloft without ceasing their strings or songs, sighing over the perfect tones, unable to describe them. Divine beasts, dragons and qilin, lions, white cranes, rare birds, phoenixes, wail with lament and leap in joy. The Supreme One strikes the Law Drum of Resonance, summons guests to the Jade Hall, sits serene on the lotus, lectures on the Dao with quiet truth, clearly chants the Mysterious Scriptures, expounds the profound writings, tasting afar the rare and obscure; joy moves the assembly of immortals. At that time the eight winds raise banners; fragrant flowers scatter, drifting smoke and dense mist.

The Supreme One declares: "Good indeed! The Non-Non is called the Dao, its meaning most profound and mysterious. The wondrous enlightenment is great and broad, enduring through kalpas and years. The Dao, in its essence obscure speech, is committed to two chapters, foretelling the able long fasting and deep thought, reciting the Mysterious Scripture, knocking teeth and swallowing saliva, breathing the Great Harmony, the body like golden radiance, the nape bearing a round light, the head adorned with the illuminations of sun, moon, and mysterious splendour; hands grasp the talisman, the banner of ten perfections. Such virtue is lofty, the supreme of the Dao, silent in profound transformation, he is the Perfected of the Supreme One. He will move the Great Nothingness, stir the Ancient of Heaven, summon the flying dragons, bring down the heavenly immortals. The Three Realms and Nine Earths, the cycle of great kalpas, the course of nine hundred and six yang, the calamities of water and fire—all are dissolved and transformed by the Jade Purity Supreme Dao. The Three Caverns’ True Scriptures, the Divine True Precious Writings, inscriptions in gold and jade, phoenix seal and dragon text—all are returned to the Most High Great Luo Heaven, to the Jade Capital’s Seven Treasures Mysterious Terrace, beyond calamity’s reach. The kalpa reopens twice, chaos is judged anew, true saints are transmitted, descending to transform the human world. It is at the highest heaven of five hundred and five thousand five hundred and fifty-five layers of heaven, removed from below by eight Brahma heavens and the realm of sun and moon, ninety-nine million nine hundred ninety-nine thousand nine hundred ninety billion qi, one qi extending three thousand li. The immortals of heaven name this mountain: one, the Head Mountain Covering Heaven; two, the Upper Mountain of Boundless Mystery; three, the Mountain of Luo Profound Emptiness; four, the High Supreme True Origin Mountain; five, the Mountain of Many Treasures and Hidden Kalpa Blade; six, the Colourless Great Treasure Mountain; seven, the Mountain Observing Mysterious Emptiness; eight, the Mountain of Splendid Radiance and Supreme Truth; nine, the Inconceivable Mountain; ten, the Great Mysterious Metropolis Jade Capital Great Mountain. To know the name of this mountain is to enter immortality. On the mountain the groves of seven treasures all form the writings of the Three Caverns’ Dao and Virtue Scriptures of the Supreme Clarity. Eating these flowers and fruits, one becomes an immortal of golden radiance; those who read this scripture long, swallowing its flavour to the utmost truth, the Dao spontaneously forms."

#### Chant of Wandering in Emptiness

To cultivate the numinous treasure and mysterious fasting, to recite the empty and profound chapters of wandering in emptiness: first knock the teeth thrice in succession, swallow three times. The heart holds the sun and moon upon the face; their radiance pours into the nose, the sun entering from the left nostril, the moon from the right nostril, entering the Golden Radiance Palace; the light issues from behind the head, suddenly forming a nine-coloured round image, permeating the jade pillow, illuminating the ten directions, following me as I circle the scripture and revolve in motion. When finished, again knock the teeth thrice, swallow saliva three times, holding the three original sovereigns in the Golden Radiance Palace, in the form of infants. The fasting of perfected beings is all according to rites and manners, only neglecting the issue of dispatching officials and soldiers. For other wishes and worships, all rest on the great law establishing fasting; on the first day officials and soldiers are dispatched, but without conferring scripture or teaching outsiders, no officials or soldiers are dispatched. The Supreme Ultimate Perfected treasures this scripture, forbidding the names of residing immortals and perfected beings to see it.

#### Ten Chants of Wandering in Emptiness

I bow my head to the Supreme One, burn incense and return to void and non-being. The flowing brightness follows me in return; the Dharma wheel likewise revolves thrice. The Mysterious Origin’s four elements arise, numinous blessings reach kings and nobles. The seven ancestors birth the heavenly hall, splendidly shining with radiance spread abroad. Whistling and singing I observe the great desert, heaven’s music suits my pleasure. Unified fragrance, supreme virtue, untainted by the vulgar. Wondrous thoughts illuminate profound awakening, majestic and solemn I traverse emptiness and roam.

I circle and walk upon cloud ropes, riding emptiness and pacing the mysterious record. Chanting the One Emperor, a hundred gates are self-regulated. Bowing to command the children of the eight seas, looking upward to carry the exalted immortal children. The heavens scatter fragrant flowers, the numinous wind rises desolately. Old wishes fix the root of destiny, thus bringing forth lofty aspirations. Joy and delight before the Supreme One, ten thousand kalpas have not yet begun.

Craggy is the Mysterious Metropolis Mountain, the ten directions’ ancestral sovereign as one. Lofty is the Heavenly Treasure Terrace, brightness radiant like flowing sun. Glorious and splendid jade and golden groves, shining and gleaming with red fruit. Constantly I remember to partake of prime essence, refining liquids to consolidate form and substance. Golden radiance scatters the purple constellations, graceful and profound the great vehicle’s escape.

Bowing and raising I hold the Supreme One, the splendid radiance shines on the cinnabar field. Turning left, I raise the solemn rite; looking right, I carry the jade jade ornament. The six perfections crown the Brahman conduct, Dao and virtue renew daily. Old fate accumulates blessings and celebrations, hearing the scripture is like welcoming dear kin. The heaven-surpassing extraordinary talent rejoices in chanting rare and subtle chapters. The pure Great Harmony qi moves gently, breathing out and in flowing mists and dews. Embryonic breath quiets the hundred gates, leisurely observing the three conveniences. The mud pellet reveals the clear image, thus becoming a golden radiance immortal; the demon king reveres and serves, hence able to attend the heavens. All starts from fasting and observance, accumulating merit and knotting old destiny. Flying in the lofty void, carrying and raising the exalted ones.

Reining the reins I journey to the ten directions, briefly resting in the mysterious brightness’s cleft. Looking up I observe the kalpa’s lofty terrace, looking down I see the purple cloud net. Free and at ease in the Supreme Capital, together sitting upon lotus flowers. Accumulating learning to become a perfected one, tranquil and flourishing, protecting and harmonizing. Ever enjoying unending lifespan, ten thousand trunks are not enough.

The great Dao is the teacher of profound silence, ascending immortals are friends without fame. The noble son wields the numinous talisman, the Supreme One holds the profound chapters. The relics shine with golden form, the dragon chariot swiftly comes to greet. The Heavenly Venerable rides the cloud carriage, drifting and riding the void. Fragrant flowers fall like flying snow, mists and vapours flourish on the mysterious beam. Revere the golden palace with head bowed, hand in hand roaming the Jade Capital.

The tall trees of the mysterious brightness garden, glowing splendidly among the seven treasure groves. Three hundred named heavenly beasts, lions of vast measure. Flying dragons hesitate and cry, divine phoenixes respond with timely song. The numinous wind fans strange flowers, pure fragrance spreads to men’s garments. Without lofty immortal talent, how could one indulge this heart?

I command my nine-dragon chariot, riding the void to roam at ease. The eight heavens are like my palm, the six directions how can they be vast? The assembly of immortals chant the Scripture of Emptiness, the Supreme One sings clear melodies. Fragrant flowers scatter with the wind, jade tones arise to violet firmament. The five sufferings break forth at once, the eight difficulties pass in quiet. Wonderful indeed is the numinous treasure enclosure, raising this great law’s bridge.

The Heavenly True One Emperor’s palace, misty and bright crowns the spirit. Flowing brilliance forms the Dharma wheel’s thread, revolving in emptiness entering formlessness. The Emptiness Sovereign holds the cloud chimes, the assembly of perfected ones chant the Mysterious Scriptures. High immortals clasp hands to praise, kalpas are preserved to uphold purity.

The utmost truth waits for nothing; sometimes reins the flying dragon. Long fasting gathers at the Mysterious Metropolis, sounding jade and striking the jade bell. Ten blossoms and various immortals assemble, purple smoke forms the palace. The treasure canopy covers the Supreme One, the perfected one holds the lotus blossom. Scattering flowers I present my vows, grasping the banner summoning the demon king. The law drum gathers the immortals, the numinous chants none differ. Nothing and not-not, thought and rare communication.

#### Eight Praises on the Wisdom Scripture of the Supreme One

The Supreme One’s profound void sect, extends the Dao and reveres its Scripture. Looking up and down he has attained immortality, crossing kalpas with countless years. Lofty indeed is the great true virtue, silent and arising from non-being. The heavenly scene builds the empty structure, riding the void to go naturally. The sun and moon shine brightly, peaceful harmony and endless joy.

To learn immortality one must sever worldly thoughts, thoughts depend on one another and accumulate. Coming and going disturb my spirit, restless spirit touches all. Extinguish thoughts, stop and rest in vacancy, desolate entering empty silence. Treat the Scripture as though starving and thirsty, hold your resolve like metal and stone. Guard the path of the flying immortal, the five spirits cross talismanic registers.

Aid me in the six perfections’ conduct, thus able to untie the three snares. Pure fasting honors the Great Origin, breathing out and in nurturing cloud sprouts. Free and at ease inside the golden palace, the Jade Capital is my home. Naturally grow the seven treasures, all sit upon lotus flowers. Looking up I chew the Mysterious Metropolis apple, looking down I drink the hollow and profound melon. Appearance shines with ten suns, what reckoning of kalpas and years? The law drum summons the heavenly immortals, ringing the bell to summon the great demon.

The numinous wind fans fragrant flowers, sparkling opening the abundant garments. Supreme Truth holds the cloud chimes, many immortals pluck the numinous zither. Elegant songs of the three heavenly scenes, scatter wisdom in the jade and golden groves. The seven ancestors ascend the blessed hall, from here stepping the mysterious sound. Past life blessings insufficient, this book is far and difficult to find. Believe in the Dao, feelings are unending, seeking to fly but only sinking deeper. The Supreme One’s non-action Dao, proclaims it in the countless hearts.

Learning the Dao depends on alchemical faith, serving the master as dearest kin. Drawing from the scene to clear emptiness, diligently following daily renewal. Most men have not attained crossing-over, will not ultimately save me. Great vows have heavy reward, profound virtue must be surely so. Yin evil sins are extremely deep, the future is like a revolving wheel.

Learning the Dao is also greatly toilsome, at morn and night establishing fields of blessing. Planting virtue is like planting trees, piling up baskets to make a mountain. If you can indulge in the profound and lofty, you will float and ascend to the blue heavens. Cultivate this non-action Dao, you should form ties with goodness. The Supreme One’s most hidden writings, called the chapters of wisdom. To拔苦 by great talent, surpass the vulgar to attain truth. The numinous form is wondrous in the world, splendid as a lotus within a deep abyss.

Men act as if having a root, all by the merit of past lives. To establish virtue is to act timely, issuing vows all follow them. Good and evil both await response, depending on principle they are hard to exhaust. Worthy men serve the law’s words, the Dao also lies in combined forgetfulness. To understand this is great wisdom, above is the Supreme Ultimate Lord. The treasure canopy connects the jade chariot, commanding driving over nine dragons. Golden radiance alarms the Mysterious Scriptures, holding incense attended by immortal children. Whistling songs penetrate the Mysterious Metropolis, striking jade and knocking the jade bell.

Standing tall I ascend the Supreme Clarity, surpassing the scene to soar in the violet firmament. Guarding the void holding the law’s thread, wandering the mysterious utmost at ease. Ten thousand kalpas are still like last night, a thousand trunks like the morning dawn. Lofty and majestic shading the cloud flowers, hand grasping the treasure grove’s branch. Fragrant smoke naturally departs, the mysterious call and soaring upwards. The numinous banner scatters with the wind, abundant thoughts dissolve with the times. Extinguish knowledge and expand the great chaos, non-action becomes a clear melody.

The words of the Supreme Ultimate Perfected are often recited by many immortals, not revealed to the vulgar below, but secreted within the Golden Palace and Jade Chamber. The Immortal Master says: "It should be transmitted to those who cultivate the Numinous Treasure Fasting, not shown to the frivolous and vain; be cautious, be cautious."

The Profound Master Supreme Origin Perfected, in person, bestowed upon the attendant Xu Changshi the Secret of the Great Mysterious Scripture of Jade Capital Mountain, composing three hymns. The same evening, Lady You Ying likewise chanted them.

#### Hymn

Eight assemblies traverse the path of no sect, riding the course observing the noisy net. Transforming to remove floating dust, loosening collar there is a Daoist. Summoning smoke no sooner than a moment, carrying truth to the numinous cleft. The void scene fills the jade pavilion, mysterious balance composes phoenix song. Journeying the road without track or hindrance, divine sounds dance on clouds and waves. The united virtue shines in Jade Capital, what use is the world’s abundance?

Left hand holds the jade radiance canopy, flying at dawn stepping the seven origins. The three stars shine with purple splendour, standing tall stroking the bright truth. Changing and leaping awaiting the moment, all sides are already divine. The numinous writings have no limit, diligently pondering the Supreme Clarity’s texts. Why sit in crosswise paths, causing you to feel distraction? Yin sickness loses the mysterious pivot, unaware the years divide.

The mysterious waves stir the vast ocean, great ferry drums ten thousand currents. Driving the radiance looking to the six voids, thinking to roam with the perfected. Wonderful singing no one answers me, pure tones lacking whom to throw. Racing the jade wheel in the clouds, who is dust and dirt’s companion?

The Supreme Ultimate Five Perfected, at Mount Kuaiji and Mount Yu bestowed to Immortal Master Ge the Scripture of Mysterious and Numinous Treasure, each chanting a hymn.

#### Hymn of the Supreme Ultimate Perfected

The Supreme Ultimate Great Dao Lord, produces and shows the Numinous Treasure chapters. Lofty and wondrous hard to describe, like the profound within profound. Naturally the ten directions’ lands, all look up to the Most High Immortal. Great indeed is the Scripture of Emptiness, seated at court before the heavens. On the upper treasure purple constellations’ terrace, below hiding many famous mountains. Radiant and splendid dragon and phoenix patterns, shining and glowing between them. Wonderful is the Supreme Dao, non-action always natural. Kings and nobles and commoners, value only the worthy. Old fate has blessings and celebrations, eminent through past affinities. The Dharma Masters pass it on each other, precious faith for kalpa and years. Broad heart crosses all, great blessings repay your person. To offer and nourish you must attain the Dao, to serve and act completes utmost truth. The great Dao has no this or that, the transmission must reach the perfect man.

#### Hymn of the First Perfected of the Mysterious One

All wonders come from the Mysterious True, shining bright and dazzling the Supreme Clarity. Those who serve are called immortals, their essence forever eternal life. Free and at ease playing in the profound void, palaces array their forms. Radiant seven-treasure groves, shining with sun and moon essence. Dragons and qilin cross and gallop, phoenix soar and sing mournfully. The Supreme One governs the purple terrace, many perfected chant the Mysterious Scriptures. Holding incense bowing the head, circling thrice the palace city. Thrice returning to the high seat, the Dao King responds to the voice. The ruler promotes the utmost Dao, all under heaven widely peaceful.

#### Hymn of the Second Perfected of the Mysterious One

Void and non-being always natural, forcibly naming the great Dao. Sounds overcome the distant without change or limit, all wonders return to the Numinous Treasure. Closing eyes keeping utmost truth, refined thought descends the ten elders. Ascending immortals forever non-action, numinous countenance always wondrous and fair. Thirsty drink the jade pool’s sweet wine, hungry eat golden flower herbs. Purify the world crossing the eight hardships, aid the world’s many afflictions.

#### Hymn of the Third Perfected of the Mysterious One

Wonderful indeed the Scripture of Numinous Treasure, the Supreme One’s natural writing. Those who serve attain the Dao, called the true descended to the world. Receiving mandate to proclaim the Dao teaching, truly a transcendent talent. When affairs are done ascending to divine immortals, palaces govern the mysterious terrace. At times descending to Mount Kunlun, free and at ease resting in Penglai.

#### Hymn of the Supreme One Perfected of the Orthodox Unity, the Supreme Three Heavens Dharma Master Zhang the Celestial Master

The Numinous Treasure and Great Emptiness, the Scripture of the King of the True Dao. Only five thousand characters, lofty and wondrous without equal or pair. To serve and act is to attain flying immortality, the mysterious dwelling governs the void. Guarding the Supreme One’s terrace, free and at ease in the Purple Tenuity Palace. Ten thousand kalpas like a lightning flash, long lasting and eternal without end. The Dao robe is already complete, freely opening and profoundly penetrating. Darkness is called not knowing, sitting at ease viewing the ten directions.

#### Three Ritual Scriptures of Incantations

The Perfected says: The formula is that attendants of the scripture, immortal children and jade maidens hearing this incantation, are all joyful and protect the destined body. This great scripture all uses this incantation in worship. If one worships the scripture with sincere heart, also consciously chants its text, this is the secret of the highest immortals.

Music law is the wife, love the scripture as pearl and jade. Holding precepts restrains the seven emotions, thinking of Dao dispels desire. Indifference and upright qi cease, desolate and spirit silent and still. Heavenly demons both revere and yield, generations enjoy great blessing.

Flourishing is the family and country, abundant is the scripture and Dao. Heaven and men share their desires, drifting into the great vehicle. Based on the heart establish the field of blessing, the Dharma wheel rises unceasing. The seven ancestors birth the heavenly hall, my body soars in broad daylight.

The great Dao of Emptiness and Mystery, has thought and nothing is not in accord. Refine substance to enter immortal truth, thus forming the adamantine body. To transcend and cross the three realms is difficult, the five sufferings of hell are resolved. All turn to the Supreme One’s scripture, quietly think and bow in worship.

(The Supreme Ultimate Left Immortal Master Ge the Perfected, named Xuan, styled Xiaoxian, at Mount Tiantai bestowed upon disciples Zheng Siyuan, the monk Zhu Falan, the monk Dao Wei, Wu Shixian lord Sun Quan. Later Siyuan in the Horse Track Mountain bestowed upon Ge Hong. Hong was the great grandson of Immortal Master Ge, styled Baopuzi, authored internal and external treatises. At that time Zheng spoke of the Immortal Master Ge, saying: "The upper clear three caverns Supreme True Dao Scripture which I bestowed, on the day I die, one copy shall be given to the famous mountain cave terraces, one to disciples, one to my family and disciples, to be recorded and transmitted through generations. If a perfect man only pursues my scripture to chase worldly affairs, he is not fit to take charge of records and transmission; it may all be entrusted to famous mountains and five sacred peaks, but not lightly transmitted to those unworthy. If there are worthy persons, it should be transmitted to them, not closing the way of heaven.")

The Scripture of Wandering in Emptiness on the Jade Capital Mountain of the Mysterious and Numious Treasure is completed.
