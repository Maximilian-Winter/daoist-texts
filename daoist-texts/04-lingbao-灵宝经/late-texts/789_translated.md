# Preface and Commentary on the Scripture of the Ascending Mystery and Stepping Void of the Cavernous Mystery and Spiritual Treasure

Title of Scripture: Scripture of the Ascending Mystery and Stepping Void of the Cavernous Mystery and Spiritual Treasure. The compiler is unknown; it is approximately from the Sui and Tang dynasties. One scroll. The original source: the category of eulogies in the Cavernous Mystery section of the Orthodox Daoist Canon.

"Ascending Mystery" is the common name for wondrous awakening; "Stepping Void" is the utmost of divine creation. "Ascending" signifies proof and certainty without error; "Mystery" denotes profound similarity with the highest virtue. "Stepping" is a name for passage and connection; "Void" is a term for transcendence and release. Moreover, "Chapter" means brilliance and openness, praising the vast stream of the law’s essence; thus there is mysterious speech that is only now uttered, and all eight directions harmonize; the spirit and charm are twice displayed, and the ten splendours compete to assemble. The revolving mystery always casts the spirit, treads the web of clouds, and carries the secret contract. Surely this is the method field to delight the spirit and cleanse the will, the subtle place to dissolve form and perish the heart; therefore it is called the Scripture of Ascending Mystery and Stepping Void.

Further, it is said that the Supreme One spoke the Scripture of the Jade Capital Mountain of the Mysterious Metropolis. The Supreme One is a borrowed title of the sage, able to expound the perfected law. The Jade Capital is a metaphor for the essence of the law. The original law is without words, also without form or image; now it borrows the name and image of the Mysterious Metropolis to discuss the law, hence there is discourse on the Jade Capital Mountain and its city towers and other scriptures. This is the third section of the Cavernous Mystery, eighth scroll of the Spiritual Treasure. Therefore the next "Void Cavern" means the praise of all heavens; the law’s essence is perfect and complete, uniting the knowledge of ancient and present as one; it includes both the coarse and the subtle and unites the followers; hence the sequence. This writing is a comprehensive summary by the Supreme One, entitled the eulogy of the great pure law-gate. It reveals the great principle of conditional teaching, and the common fellowship of wondrous awakening. Hence every law is entirely the Jade Capital, every thing is all recorded as Dao and virtue. Further it is said the Jade Capital is the law’s essence and profound unity. The metropolis is a title. By this title the three thousand great thousand worlds are regarded as one Jade Capital Mountain, as the Supreme One’s dwelling-place in this realm. Also it is the dwelling-place of the human heart and spirit; therefore it is called a name of teaching, the essence of teaching instructing the heart and spirit. When the heart and spirit are awakened, it is called awakening; when confused, it is called confusion; when wise, it is called wisdom. Respect makes them accord as the human law, therefore it is called scripture. Scripture is the ferry to understanding. Principle is the cause of exposition; exposition is born of principle. The learner’s spirit awakening is then called scripture. Jade means pure. Capital means great. To say the Mysterious Metropolis is the great pure principle, therefore it is the law’s essence. The Supreme One is the person; the Mysterious Metropolis and Jade Capital are the law, also the realm of wisdom. Speaking of realm and its place, they are all named treasures; speaking of wisdom and its place, they are all named spiritual treasures. Thus it is said the Scripture of the Mysterious Metropolis and Jade Capital Mountain.

This scroll is divided into four classes. The first raises the Mysterious Metropolis as the Dao-realm, to establish the essence of the law, explaining the method of teaching by form and elucidation, describing the summary from principle to application. The second shows the method of cultivation and practice. The third enumerates ten hymns praising the law’s essence, summarizing the meaning from external to internal principle. The fourth scatters broad recitations, every law being correct, to show gains, losses, and circulation.

The Supreme One said: The Mysterious Metropolis Jade Capital Mountain is the discourse itself. It crowns the eight directions; the mountain has four faces, four edges, and four eaves; hence there are eight directions. This is the realm of heaven and earth, the dwelling-place of many worlds. Compared to the earth’s form, there are the upper, middle, and lower three mysterious metropolises; the mountain’s name is also called the three great encircling mountains. The great encircling is the crown, spreading over the eight directions; all heavens are contained within. The first lower small metropolis corresponds to the eight directions compared to the world’s eight heavens, as one world, one encircling mountain enclosing it. When piled up to a thousand, it is a small thousand world, and it rests in the four directions. Another enclosure encloses this, becoming a middle world; again piled to a thousand, it is a middle thousand world, also resting in the four directions. Another enclosure encloses this, becoming a great thousand world. Piled again to a thousand, it is the crowned enclosing mountain. Altogether viewing middle and lower, it is called the three thousand great thousand worlds. This is the crown of the eight directions encircling the heavens. Its body is the seven treasures, also called the treasure cluster, hence the name Jade Capital. This borrows form to reveal the beauty and subtlety; by the eye of the spiritual treasure’s law essence, one surveys the cavernous void; hence the mountain naturally produces trees of the seven treasures. The naming of the mountain is not a discourse on trees; taking tree as essence is also called the tree of the Dao. One sole trunk with branches and leaves spreading and covering all around, hence it is called the law encircling heaven. It is the place where the great Dao Lord governs transformation, conducts sitting and walking, the law realm place, the Dao field place, the place to calm the spirit, the place to discourse the law. It does not stand apart from the truth; everywhere is the truth. Throughout the world there is no place empty or idle; the three poisons and four arrivals, the spiritual ferry and law sea, six feelings and five skandhas. The Jade Capital Mountain is the mysterious metropolis of the high immortals; the myriad saints convene together, also the great Dao Lord and sages. Now all things consider themselves the body, is it not only the sages indeed? Therefore it is called the great law sage. The heavenly honoured, emperors and kings, high immortals and supreme truths, each hold fast to their observances and reverence the law, venerating the Supreme One here. The observance is to cleanse the heart, called abstinence. Day is time. Also it is the heart’s purity and awakened illumination as day and time. If our purity is complete, there is nothing not pure. To name the Supreme One of the Mysterious Metropolis is its meaning. Burning natural sandalwood, it produces spiritual incense, that is, the incense of the spirit. The realm is pure. The flying immortals scatter blossoms; all laws are blossoms. Revolving around, singing the cavernous spiritual chapter. The heavens play a hundred thousand myriad sounds collected together. These are wondrous discourses, all matters of the spiritual awakened law essence, but depend on the text to complete.

The mountain has ten names, naming the law essence. Having ten names, one meaning only.

1. Named the Crown Heaven Chief Mountain. Its law nature is true void, encompassing past and present, as the head and origin of all things, hence called Heaven Chief.

2. Named the All-Profound Upper Mountain. Its mountain is boundless and unsearchable, with no above or below reachable, hence called All-Profound.

3. Named the Encompassing Profound Cavernous Void Mountain. Its mountain is everywhere and nowhere, hence called Encompassing Profound.

4. Named the Lofty Supreme True Origin Mountain. Its mountain is the congregation of myriad saints, hence called Lofty Supreme.

5. Named the Multitude of Treasures Hidden Calamity Blade Mountain. Its mountain’s every law is treasure, both profound and shallow are seen, hence called Multitude of Treasures.

6. Named the Colorless Great Awakening Mountain. Its mountain’s wondrous awakening is without form, hence called Colorless.

7. Named the All-Observing Cavernous Profound Mountain. Its mountain’s great brightness is boundless, hence called All-Observing.

8. Named the Radiant Magnificent Supreme True Mountain. Its mountain is one essence, splendid and liquid radiance, hence called Radiant Magnificent.

9. Named the Inconceivable Mountain. Its mountain is true void, beyond thought’s reach, hence called Inconceivable.

10. Named the Great Mysterious Metropolis Jade Capital Supreme Mountain. Its mountain is the unity of person and law, taking purity as essence, hence called Great Mysterious.

Mountain means body, also the Supreme One’s body. Knowing the purpose under this name, it accords with the law; name and essence both unite, hence it enters the immortal register.

The seven treasures of flowers and leaves, mountain trees and realm, branches, stems, leaves, earth, stone, terraces, and pavilions are all seven treasures; the flowers and leaves are all from the scriptures of the Upper Clarity’s Three Caverns and the Dao and Virtue, thirty-six scriptures altogether. The signs can be consumed as food, self-constituting golden flower immortals. It urges to swallow and taste the spiritual treasure’s pure cup; the realm refreshes with the heart; the great earth also becomes the seven treasures and the mysterious scripture. Mountains, forests, grasses, and stones all have wisdom, able to declare the treasure law; where could it not be the Jade Capital? The Cavernous Mystery Stepping Void Ode, the title below is the taste of the seven treasures’ flowers and leaves law. The heart communicates with the profound Dao; the spirit chants the stepping void, wandering and roaming the scriptures and law. The learner’s spirit awakening calls it scripture; observation follows sound and wanders, hence it is called chanting. The kowtowing and reverence have three kinds, as commonly understood. Now since herein is the purpose of swallowing and tasting chanting, it is proper to explain from the heart and leaves.

#### The Supreme One’s Cavernous Mystery Stepping Void Scripture Chant

First

Kowtow and reverence to the Supreme One, burning incense to return to the void origin. The flowing brightness follows me back, the law wheel also turns thrice. The profound origin and four great arise, spiritual felicity and kings and nobles. The seven ancestors give birth to the heaven realm, resplendent and spreading light. Whistling songs observe the great desert, heavenly music suits my delight. Harmonious fragrance of supreme virtue, lower immortals not matching. Wondrous forms illuminate profound awakening, splendidly circulating through the void to roam free.

(Kowtow and reverence to the Supreme One. Kowtow means to open; head means heart; reverence means essence. Opening the heart’s essence causes the Supreme One’s wisdom fire to burn the body’s forms all clean. Burning incense returning to the void and nothingness means to consume and extinguish all forms; the incense’s purity returns to void and nothingness. Void and nothingness do not return to the Supreme One, but the Supreme One returns to them; thus it is said. The flowing brightness follows me back; I myself become the Supreme One; the law wheel turns thrice; by this uniting with the Supreme One, the three law wheels complete their revolutions. The profound origin and four great arise. Profound origin means accomplishment; my four great prosper and unite with the profound Dao constantly. Spiritual felicity and kings and nobles. Spiritual wisdom and felicity unite to nourish parents, benefit the ruler, and aid beings, thus including kings and nobles. Therefore the seven ancestors give birth to the heaven realm, resplendent and spreading light. Whistling songs observe the great desert. The song chants the sound of spiritual wisdom. One tone encircles and covers, observing the path of the great desert; the path’s unity is joyful, naturally joined with heavenly music, heavenly music suits my delight. Harmonious fragrance of supreme virtue. Fragrance means reception. The seven ancestors and rulers receive the supreme virtue with me; they are not companions of lower immortals. Wondrous imagination unites myriad wonders without cause, profound awakening. Splendidly means abundant; multitude of beauties circulate through the void and roam freely.)

Second

Revolving motion treads the web of clouds, riding the void stepping the profound order. Chanting and singing the emperor, sole honour, all hundred joints naturally regulated. Bowing commands the eight sea children, raising and carrying the high immortal offspring. The heavens scatter fragrant flowers, desolate spiritual winds arise. Ancient vows fix the root of life, thus achieving the high standard. Joy and delight before the Supreme One, myriad kalpas not yet begun.

(Revolving motion treads the web of clouds. Revolving in the void and moving. To move is to forget. Feet tread the law’s web of clouds’ order, riding the void stepping the profound order. Chanting and singing means communicating with nature. When nature communicates, the emperor, sole honour, naturally unites with my body. The hundred joints are the body’s bones and joints, all regulated and returning to ultimate principle. Bowing commands the eight sea children. All things considered as my body, thus the eight directions’ nature is the sea, one infant child. Child means without mind. Heavenly beings rely on it, raising and carrying the high immortal offspring. The heavens scatter fragrant flowers. Heaven and earth scatter true law flowers. The realm follows the heart’s refreshment; the jade writing responds to the realm’s arising. Desolate spiritual wind arises. Desolate means the wind of spiritual awakening, rising desolately. Ancient vows fix the root of life. For uncountable kalpas, the ancient assembled vows, spiritual wisdom without limit, vow to understand. Thus the root of life is long fixed, now to be received. Thus achieving the high standard. The high standard is now obtained. Now the Supreme One is before my heart; the Dao fruit is boundless; the solemn vow is fulfilled; hence joy and delight accord with constancy. Myriad kalpas not yet begun means to understand constancy.)

Third

Lofty towering Mysterious Metropolis Mountain, the one sovereign of the ten directions. Lofty heavenly treasure terrace, radiance like flowing sun flames. Brilliant jade flower forest, shining and dazzling red fruit. Constantly contemplating to consume primordial essence, refining fluid to solidify form and substance. Golden light scatters the purple micro, graceful and mysterious Mysterious Metropolis recluse.

(Lofty towering Mysterious Metropolis Mountain. Describes the realm’s pure law essence, lofty, the Mysterious Dao capital’s law mountain. The one sovereign of the ten directions. Sovereign means the honoured heart of pure wisdom. Awakening embraces and includes the ten directions’ Mysterious Metropolis, same clan returning to the sovereign one’s honour. Lofty heavenly treasure terrace. Embracing all things as my body. Realm and wisdom are one reflected; radiance is like flowing sun flames. The sun and moon’s light is dim and ineffective, the sunlight travels. The commentary explains "brilliant jade forest flowers, shining red fruit" is this. Constantly contemplating to consume primordial essence. This describes the practice of contemplation. Primordial essence means spiritual wisdom. Daily contemplation refines the vital breath before death, thus root, form and substance become golden light law essence, scattering and illuminating my body, producing the purple micro dwelling, gracefully residing in the Mysterious Metropolis abode and wandering freely. Later generations changed this to Mahayana, the utmost folly. Riding this vehicle to transport to the goal, the Mysterious Metropolis is the utmost place of the supreme Dao home. To approach and believe in it is like walking, labor and rest being most extreme.)

Fourth

Bowing and raising preserve the Supreme One, floral radiance bright in the cinnabar field. Looking left raises the cluster and gathering of jade, looking right carries and knots the lapis lazuli. Six perfections crowned with Brahman conduct, Dao and virtue daily renewed. Accumulated fate and blessings, hearing the scripture like close kin. Heavenly talent surpassing the world, delighting in chanting subtle chapters. Void-pure great harmonious breath, exhaling and inhaling flowing rosy ferry. Embryonic breath quiets the hundred joints, vast and profound reaching the three portals. Mud pellet cavernous bright radiance, thus becoming golden flower immortal. The demon king reverently receives command, hence able to court the heavens. All proceed from abstinence and precepts, accumulating merit to bind ancient affinities. Flying and roaming above the great void, carrying and raising the lofty ones.

(Bowing and raising preserve the Supreme One. Here each section separately establishes a gate of observation, practices of consumption and chanting. Practice gates differ; the hymn says radiance and awakening returning to the one root. Each section is separate and unrelated. Now bowing and raising to preserve the Supreme One means preserving the heart. The body’s movement has bowing and raising; the heart’s movement has preservation of thought; the moving heart’s spirit is wondrous; wondrous thought self-gathers; the body follows the spirit. Preserving spirit accords with the Supreme One and moves; the Supreme One follows the spirit and acts; thus the bowing and raising body equals the Supreme One; the Supreme One following the spirit returns to me; hence floral radiance brightens the cinnabar field. Looking left raises the cluster and gathering of jade, looking right carries and knots the lapis lazuli; these follow the awakened wisdom’s gathering. The six perfections crowned are Brahman conduct; therefore Dao and virtue daily renew and complete. Accumulated fate and blessings. Describes the ability to act as above, that is ancient practice long established, now revered and unyielding. Hearing the scripture like close kin means accumulated blessings respond. Close kin as father and mother; just as one long separated from parents suddenly sees them. Scripture is the lawful mother, Dao the lawful father; meeting them is joyful and respectful, acting with accumulated fate. Heavenly talent surpassing the world. Thus delighting in chanting the subtle two chapters. Soundless means subtle; formless means fine. Without accumulated habitual binding of karma, one does not believe scripture, hearing but not hearing. Even if practiced, soon withdrawn, lacking control and holding power. Void-pure great harmonious breath. Describes correct contemplation practice. Void means heart. The heart obtains the wondrous breath of void pure great harmony, exhaling and inhaling, flowing and illuminating, rosy ferry nourishing my body. Also called embryonic breath. Like the embryo’s stability, like breath without mind, void and calm nurturing, quieting the hundred joints. Quieting then the heart is vast and tranquil, clear and illuminating, reaching the three realms’ convenient gates. Mud pellet means non-action; non-action clearly illuminates within, light and scene illuminate without; the path of true constancy and great brightness; thus becoming golden flower immortal. Naturally causing the demon king to reverently receive command; thus able to court the heavens. All proceed from abstinence and precepts. Describes the original cause, the ancient habit accumulating myriad good deeds over vast kalpas, cleansing the original dust of primordial beginnings; thus obtains body and law realm, flying and roaming above the great void. Gathering the coarse and subtle, carrying and raising lofty ones.)

Fifth

Holding the reins going to the ten directions, revolving and resting in the profound scene’s retreat. Looking up to the kalpa’s lofty terrace, looking down at the purple cloud canopy. Free and easy in the Supreme One’s capital, together sitting on lotus flowers. Accumulating learning to become a true person, serene and flourishing in protection and harmony. Eternally enjoying unending life, what is the use of many ten-thousand springs?

(Holding the reins going to the ten directions. The reins mean holding the heart; that is, using the body to follow the heart and be pure, the heart reins the body and moves it, riding it to go all around the ten directions. Hence revolving and resting, sitting at the profound Dao’s scene, in the retreat hall. Looking up at the body and mind sitting on the kalpa’s terrace, looking down at the returning light, being the purple cloud’s covering. Purple cloud canopy, spiritual wisdom’s utmost law, the cloud’s colour of law. Sitting thus and roaming freely, abiding in the Supreme One’s Jade Capital place. Sage friends all meet, together sitting on lotus flowers. Accumulating learning to become a true person. Describes ancient habit long established, now obtained. Serene and flourishing in protection and harmony. The law of flourishing and protection is true wisdom and serenity, the stomach’s inner harmony and brightness. Eternally enjoying unending and limitless lifespan, not needing many ten-thousand springs; thus what use is abundance?)

Sixth

The great Dao master is profound stillness, ascending immortals friendly to no hero. The noble son crosses the spiritual talisman, Supreme Unity holds the cavernous chapter. Relics shine with golden form, dragon chariot suddenly comes to welcome. The heavenly honoured looks to the cloud carriage, drifting and riding the void to soar. Fragrant flowers like flying snow, mist and haze abundant on the profound beam. Head and brain revere the golden palace, holding hands to roam the Jade Capital.

(The great Dao master is profound stillness. Those seeking the great Dao ought to take the realm of profound stillness as teacher; stillness the external realm, obtaining non-action within; stillness realm is non-action, non-action is stillness realm; this is obtaining the great Dao, this is stillness realm as teacher. Hence ascending immortals friendly to no hero. Having as friend no hero, the spiritual talisman naturally revolves within me. No-hero noble son, the title of heavenly truth. Supreme Unity emperor lord bestows the cavernous chapter upon me. Cavernous chapter is the heavenly middle sound. Relics mean bones. The cavernous chapter irrigates my bone form; the bone form becomes golden visage. Dragon chariot suddenly, in the air comes to welcome, reins loosened to roam; the heavenly honoured carries and supports me, the cloud carriage drifting, riding the void and soaring together. Fragrant flowers spread across the empty realm, like flying snow covering all around, dense and abundant, the profound Dao’s high beam. Head and brain revere within the golden palace; the heavenly honoured carries and holds the hand, roaming and sitting in the Jade Capital.)

Seventh

The lofty trees in the profound scene’s garden, splendidly shining seven treasure forest. Heavenly beasts three hundred named, lions vast and many miles. Flying dragons lingering and crying, divine phoenix responding in season with chant. Spiritual wind fans wondrous flowers, pure fragrance scatters on garment. Without high immortal talent, how can one indulge this heart?

(The lofty trees in the profound scene’s garden. The scene follows the purified heart; thus the scene forms seven treasure lofty trees; now it speaks of the scene’s wonder, also the mind’s wonder; it sets heart and wisdom to speak of the scene, thus called profound scene garden. The wondrous heart illuminates the round pure scene; treasures form seven treasure lofty trees, the law realm’s garden and park; thus called splendid seven treasure forest. Heavenly beasts three hundred named. Natural law beasts appear in forms and images, being the law king lion sovereign; hence the name lion. The three hundred names and vast miles are only numbers to express magnitude. As for name and reality, infinite, essence vast boundless. Below listed flying dragons and divine phoenix, all heavenly beast aliases. The spiritual phoenix fans below, that is to say wondrous wisdom. Spiritual wisdom is clear and pure, majestic and wondrous in manner; fans myriad scenes and forms light and pure law; fragrance scatters on garments in the realm. The following text explains that without possessing the talent and wisdom of high immortals and great sages, how can one indulge and play with such a heart?)

Eighth

Adorned with my nine dragon chariots, riding the void to roam free. Eight heavens like finger palms, six directions how can they be vast? Multitude of immortals chanting cavernous scripture, Supreme One singing pure ballad. Fragrant flowers scatter with the wind, jade sounds form the purple firmament. Five sufferings suddenly erupt, eight hardships follow scripture’s vastness. Wondrous indeed the spiritual treasure enclosure, arising this great law bridge.

(Adorned with my nine dragon chariots. To adorn myself means to purify and adorn my five senses and four hearts with spiritual treasure’s true wisdom, thus forming the six penetrations and three clear knowledges; to pacify the rough and coarse, hence nine dragon chariots. Hence it says riding the void to roam free. Eight heavens lie like finger palms; six directions how can they be vast? Riding in accord with unity of all things as one body, immortals and Supreme One, honoured teachers and good friends meet spontaneously; all chanting cavernous and void ballads forming the teaching. Hence it says fragrant flowers scatter with the wind, jade sounds form the purple firmament. The purple firmament’s scenic realm colours all form scripture; thus the five sufferings at once, along with scripture, erupt and scatter, also forming scripture. The eight hardships are likewise. Hence it says wondrous indeed the spiritual treasure enclosure, arising this great law bridge.)

Ninth

The heavenly truth emperor’s sole palace, misty and radiant with spirit. Flowing dazzling law wheel order, revolving void entering formlessness. Void sovereign holds the cloud harp, myriad truths chant cavernous scripture. Lofty immortal clasps hands to praise, myriad kalpas protect, prosper, and preserve.

(The heavenly truth emperor’s sole palace. Palace means body. The essence of natural Dao, thus the heavenly truth’s own place, true emperor’s sole home. The abode, emperor one’s home. Radiant and illustrious essence, encircling, crowning, and shining with spirit. The body’s law essence flows and dazzles, being the law bridge’s order. The wheel turns to unite void and nothingness; the great Dao revolves the void entering formlessness. Void sovereign and myriad truths suddenly arrive, being great teacher friends; holding the cloud harp and singing, chanting cavernous scripture and forming within me. Lofty immortal folds hands in praise and rejoicing. Myriad kalpas protect, prosper, and preserve. Accord with constancy.)

Tenth

Utmost truth has no dependence; sometimes reins the flying dragon. Long fasting meets the Mysterious Metropolis, sounding jade tapping the jade bell. Ten splendours gather immortals, purple smoke forms the palace. Treasure canopy covers the Supreme One, true person holds the lotus. Scattering blossoms sets forth my vow, grasping the baton commanding the demon king. Law drum gathers the assembly of immortals, spirit singing without discord. Neither possible nor impossible, thought and subtlety communicate.

(Utmost truth has no dependence; sometimes reins the flying dragon. The essence accords with utmost truth; therefore able to ride all things without object, without form yet carrying all; thus no dependence. Sometimes reins the flying dragon. Long fasting cleanses the heart and is pure; naturally the mysterious assembly meets in the Mysterious Metropolis. Sounding jade tapping the jade bell means calling the law drum, which naturally sounds. Ten splendours below are the assembly of myriad saints responding and gathering. Emitting purple smoke naturally forms the palace and pavilion. Treasure increase means the law crown. Covering and assembling the Supreme One’s own countless true immortals holding lotus law flower banner, the canopy offering to the empty-born; all scatter the blossoms of law wisdom, displaying and completing my ancient vow; the ancient vow becomes boundless wisdom and solemn vow; now explaining the vow’s fulfillment. Grasping the baton commanding the demon king also means the vow is fulfilled and affairs terminated. Law drum is the drum of law wisdom, gathering the assembly of spirits. Spirit singing without discord. Hence neither possible nor impossible, thought and subtle subtlety communicate. Inner illumination therefore outer use; thus inner thought spontaneously communicates with subtlety.)
