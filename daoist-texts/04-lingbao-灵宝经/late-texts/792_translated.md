#### Preface to the Chapter on the Birth of Spirits of the Nine Heavens

Form cannot long endure; what endures is the movement of qi. Qi cannot always move; what moves constantly is essence as its root. When these three are blended into one, the Way of spirit-immortals is not difficult to attain.

The main points of the Chapter on the Birth of Spirits of the Nine Heavens are fourfold. First, to cherish the form; second, to preserve the spirit; third, to value the qi; fourth, to firm the root. Man has form as a house; though it be said a temporary union, how can one allow it to be damaged and to decay day by day? Then there would be none in the world dwelling in the open. Moreover, form is the abode of a hundred spirits, the seat of one’s nature, the trust of intelligence. The practitioner must rely on this before success is attained, and must first say, cherish the form. Yang accumulates to generate spirit; yin accumulates to generate form. Form and spirit must not be separated even for a moment. When the form is firm, the spirit can remain long; when the house is firm, man can long dwell. If the work be not complete, yet the yin shell first withers, this is often the trouble of the learner. The fool knows not, thinking the external form and bodily appearance are as dust, dirt, and chaff seen by the eye and ear — thus he is a man of attainment. Once he cast himself into the realm of profit and loss, honour and shame, and ends his life without accomplishing anything, what difference is there between him and the dead? Now not only cherish it, but must make form and spirit mutually serve; it is precious that flesh and bone together fly. Not to be exposed to wind in heat, nor to lie wet in summer; sitting long harms the bones, labouring long harms the sinews. Considering this reason, moving and changing, not one moment passes without cherishing. No leopard’s food outside, no disease of Zhang Yi within. Beginning with cherishing the form, ending with practising the form — is this done lightly? Form and spirit are together, not distant; hence second, preserve the spirit. Spirit is the essence of yang, the portion of heaven. Zhuangzi says: “Not departing from essence is called spirit.” How can man’s spirit descend? It comes by fate. Therefore, in the ninth month, spirit is dispersed, and fate is complete. When spirit comes to dwell, as a house with inhabitants, it sets up beams and rafters, carves windows and doors; sight, hearing, eating, breathing, all proceed through it. Its birth startles heaven and shocks earth; in movement, it grasps with hands and walks with feet. By communicating and transforming it, sitting, standing, and departing, all become our use. There are some who abide in it all their lives without knowing; suddenly they perish and rot with the earth; the spirit does not wait, but bears itself away at midnight. Such a man does not know what spirit is; sad indeed! The Scripture says: “Why does death cause the spirit to weep?” Spirit can control qi; hence third, value the qi. Heaven and earth are great; nothing moves without qi. The light of sun and moon is not bright without qi. Man and all creatures alike discern this. Where there is difference, it is between right and wrong. That the tortoise and crane do not wither is because they get pure qi; that the pine tree withers later is because it gets firm qi. Man alone obtains the right qi, yet not in full. The Scripture says: “The three qi are the honour of heaven and earth; the nine qi are the root of all things.” If man can preserve the root of the nine qi, and unite with the honour of the three qi, how precious is such holding! The trouble is ignorance. Man values his qi but knows not whence it comes; is this not shallow? Qi originally is born from essence; essence is stored in the kidneys; so knowing qi is knowing the root in essence. Knowing its root, one may speak of achieving life. Hence fourth, firm the root. The Scripture says: “All things, manifold, each returns to its root. Returning to the root is called stillness; stillness is called returning to life.” The practitioner must hold stillness, then the root will be deep and the base firm. Therefore Zhuangzi says: “Do not shake your essence; then you may live long.” Form obtains spirit to abide, spirit obtains qi to be quick; one may return to the origin, may complete the elixir. This is to unite the three origins in virtue, to bring the nine qi together. The original Chapter on the Birth of Spirits of the Nine Heavens is indeed a forbidden book of the upper heavens. Not following the turning of kalpas, it has no cause to be transmitted except for the desire that the common custom be overturned, to place it in the land of benevolence and longevity, to enlighten those not yet awakened. First it sets forth the Three Treasures, opening and enlightening heaven, earth, man, and all things, which all receive nurture. Next it unfolds nine chapters, giving birth and establishing the nine heavens. Man receives the nine qi as his vital origin; the head symbolizes the nine heavens, above are the nine palaces, the body contains nine organs symbolizing the nine provinces; outside are nine doors symbolizing the nine fields. The use of one’s whole body, is it not all from the nine qi? Those who use it fully ascend the nine heavens; those who use it secondarily end in corpse liberation; those who know not its use receive only a form, like one who relies on qi to move. This Way, though possessed by all, few can attain it; why? Because private desires prevail and affairs seize the way. In the time of the Three Sovereigns, the people were simple and honest; the Great Way was not concealed; all knew the essentials of self-cultivation; therefore there were those who after twelve hundred years weary of the world and ascend. Hence the Scripture says: “In ancient times there were true men who held heaven and earth, grasped yin and yang, breathed essence and qi, stood alone guarding spirit; their flesh and blood were as one; thus they could live as long as heaven and earth, having no end.” Since the burning of the Qin fire, the books of the Three Sovereigns have vanished, and only the “Difficulty Scripture” and “Simple Questions” remain, studied by physicians. The preface says: “The books of the Three Sovereigns spoke of the Great Way; in later times these were lost. The methods of cultivating body and preserving life, though continuous like a thread, were succeeded by the Buddhist teaching gradually entering China, taking quietude and extinction as delight, yet cutting off the root and thus increasing loss; so that our Great Way is ever more obscure.” Recently returning from the southeast, a countryman, Ren Gong, virtuous, said: “The Chapter on the Birth of Spirits is indeed the great origin of the Daoists. Many have looked upon it; though there is the commentary of Yu Chanzi, its words are brief and essential, regrettably difficult for learners to construct. If it be explained in detail, so all may easily understand, it is not without benefit. Its words accord with the heart; in leisure from burning incense and practice, I wish to study it.” Formerly Ouyang Wen Zhonggong disliked Daoist learning all his life; in late years guarding the Bo altar, he then had enlightenment. One day seeking Dao from the recluse at Shitang, he wished to learn. The recluse said: “Your dwelling is already ruined; it is hard to speak of this. If you can understand the previous state, it will be near enough.” Wen Zhonggong’s virtue and literary merit were outstanding in his time; was he not qualified to receive the Dao? Yet he said he lost the former state; much less the unqualified! Those who obtain this Way, the Nine Ancestors are all immortals; what matter the former state? If forcibly taken crookedly, or softly bound, how can one not strive? The first year of the Kaixi era of the Great Song, in the month of May, on the first day, at Mianzhou Chongxu Temple, the Daoist Wang Xichao, recluse and worthy, wrote this preface.

#### Commentary on the Jade Chapter Scripture of the Spontaneous Birth of Spirits of the Nine Heavens of the Mysterious and Primordial Spirit Treasure, Scroll One

Commentary by Wang Xichao, Daoist of Chongxu Temple, Mianzhou

The Heavenly Treasure Lord is the Venerable Spirit of the Great Mysterious. The Venerable Man is the ancestral qi of the Heavenly Treasure Lord. The Venerable Man is the qi of the Mixed Mysterious Supreme Void of the Great Primordial Jade Emptiness, ninety-nine thousand nine hundred ninety billion qi. Later, in the first year of the Dragon Han, the Heavenly Treasure Lord was transformed and born; at the time of issuing the book, he was styled the Supreme Great Possessing Jade Pure Palace.

(Heaven and Earth are the great form. Kalpas and cycles are the great time. Where there is form, there is number; where there is time, there is change. When number is exhausted and time changes, all returns to decay, save only the Three Pure Ones, the Most Holy, and the True Kings of the Nine Heavens; these are not bound by form, nor controlled by number. Thus, kalpas endure long; later heaven is not old. The Heavenly Treasure Lord is the ancestor of all ways, styled the Venerable Spirit of the Great Mysterious. Above the Three Mysterious Caves is the Great Mysterious Method, discussing the way of returning wind and mixed blending, not for lower grade minor immortals. In man, this is the Supreme One Emperor Lord. Carefully according to the “Supreme Clear Great Mysterious Scripture”: above joins the Three Origins, below joins all things; stillness used as body, movement used as spirit. The Venerable Man is called the father of all fathers. The Three Origins are: first, the Mixed Mysterious Great Primordial; second, the Red Mixed Great Primordial; third, the Dark Quiet Mysterious Penetrating Origin. The “Zhengyi Scripture” says: The Great Primordial is without change; the three qi shine therein. The Great Primordial is the unchanging beginning of beginnings; the Three Origins are the roots of creation, rooted in nothing and beginning with the origin; the three qi are born therein. The name of the Origin of Origins is taken from this. Thus the Three Origins give birth to the Three Qi, the Three Qi are the natural qi of the Great Void. Void is born of the mysterious, mysterious born of the origin, origin born of beginning; hence the “Opening Heaven Scripture” says: The primal qi moves and heaven and earth stand. Though the three qi are born, they are not yet sealed, hence called the Mixed Mysterious. The “Scripture on Deliverance” says: Mixed Mysterious Red Script, the supreme truth, opens the bright kalpa, transforms and produces the heavens. In the palaces of the Three Origins, the Three Qi true gods are the origins of water and fire, corresponding below to the two kidneys of the body, ruling the Northern Dipper in heaven, and the talismanic spiritual texts and covenants. If man cultivates the Way and preserves truth, merits complete, then these Three Spirits ascend with oneself, that is the way of blending. The Three Spirits are the three generals Tang, Ge, and Zhou. Formerly in the Zhihé era, Emperor Renzong was ill for three days. Awaking from sickness, he said he dreamed of wandering amid brambles, confused and lost, when a divine man clad in golden armour said to the emperor: “Heaven grants Your Majesty a heart of transformation and bestows the longevity of one era.” The emperor said: “Whither shall I return?” The divine man said: “Allow me to escort you in my chariot.” The emperor mounted and asked who he was; the reply was: “I am the general Ge.” The emperor awoke and ordered the Daozang to be examined; indeed there was the general Ge, in charge of the heavenly gate, and so a temple was established in the capital. Alas, none reported this then, thinking him a spirit of the body. The Jade Emptiness qi is originally a single qi. Thus the three titles are the same. The Daozang has the titles Jade Emptiness and Jade Emperor, both honorifics. Jade signifies virtue, Emperor signifies heaven. The year of the Dragon Han is the ancestral kalpa. Dragon denotes change, Han denotes greatness. Before heaven and earth took form, one qi wandered in the Great Void, its body winding and turning, changing without constancy, forming spirit and essence. The celestial sovereign saw the kalpa open and named it Dragon Han. Thus the “Scripture of Divine Transformations” records that the Three Sovereigns all had dragon bodies and human heads. At the beginning of the kalpa was the dragon ancestor great emperor, also the star of the dragon ancestor, the thirty-two heavens have the dragon transformation Brahma Emperor, all signifying this.)

The Spirit Treasure Lord is the Venerable Spirit of the Mysterious and Primordial, the Venerable Man is the ancestral qi of the Spirit Treasure Lord. The Venerable Man is the qi of the Red Mixed Great Primordial Mysterious Supreme Purple Void, ninety-nine thousand nine hundred ninety-nine million qi. Later, at the opening of the Dragon Han, the Spirit Treasure Lord was transformed and born; after one kalpa, at the first year of the Red Bright, he issued books, guiding people, styled the Supreme Clear Mysterious Capital of Jade, Seven Treasures, Purple Micro Palace.

(Jade Clear is the Heavenly Treasure Lord; Supreme Clear is the Spirit Treasure Lord; Great Clear is the Divine Treasure Lord, thus understanding the titles belonging to the Three Treasures, the Heavenly Treasure Lord should be styled the Venerable Spirit of the Cave of Truth. Now he is styled only the Venerable Spirit of the Great Cave, not the Cave of Truth. Why? Because before the Three Caves were divided, the whole was called the Great Cave, like the undivided Two Forces called the Supreme Ultimate. Yet the Great Cave is originally the way of returning wind and blending; blending is the undivided Three Caves. The Origin of Origin Dharma King is the lord of creation; the Pre-Heavenly Sage obtained this name. The Cave of Truth appears after the Three Caves are divided; the Origin of Origin also is called thus. Now the scripture speaks of the Great Cave from the root, and of the Spirit Treasure Lord from the manifestation. According to the “Preface to the Many Texts of the Daozang”: The Mysterious and Primordial is the root; the Spirit Treasure is the manifestation, speaking from the manifestation. The qi of the Great Cave is born in the Void, flowing to become the Cave of Truth, next becoming the Mysterious and Primordial. The teaching of the Mysterious and Primordial is specially named Spirit Treasure, indeed the ancestor of the teaching. The manifestation is the writing. In the first year of Dragon Han, there was no writing; at the opening of the chart, writing first appeared. The “Origin of Daoist Teaching” says: The teaching of the Daoists begins from the Three Origins, descending from root to manifestation, then unfolding scriptures and proclamations. Now the Spirit Treasure Lord is born at the opening of the chart of Dragon Han, indeed the beginning of issuing books and guiding people; observing his title and his time, one knows he is the ancestor of the teaching. Also called the Capital of Origin, Jade Capital, Seven Treasures, Purple Micro Palace, the place of the Daozang. Yet the qi of Supreme Jade Emptiness reaches ninety-nine thousand nine hundred ninety billion qi; the Red Mixed Great Primordial qi is somewhat less by a hundred million qi, thus the kalpa qi numbers differ, no longer as before; this is man’s self-summoning. In ancient times there were those of ten million years’ lifespan; in the Tang and Yu times still those of more than a hundred years; now people barely reach seventy; is this not different from ancient times? All receive this qi; why the difference? Because life and death revolve; born, then extinguished; extinguished, then reborn; intelligence dims; qi and number waste away. Now is less than then, later not equal to now. Like a sheng of water, often changed to another vessel; drops leach away; gradually less than a sheng; days pass, months come; its drying is to be expected. Thus life and death revolve like a turning wheel, never ceasing; deeply to be pitied. Reverently considering the Flying Heavenly Spirit King, who takes life and death as his responsibility, he braves prohibitions and prays earnestly, so that men may know the origin of spirit birth, the turning of transmigration, ultimately returning to the Way of Immortals, his heartfelt concern may be called utmost. Having obtained human life, do not wastefully undergo birth and death; should return to reflect and turn the light, so as not to lose oneself to other species; then on the Way of Immortals there may be hope.)

The Divine Treasure Lord is the Venerable Spirit of the Cave Spirit; the Venerable Man is the ancestral qi of the Divine Treasure Lord. The Venerable Man is the qi of the Dark Quiet Mysterious Penetrating Origin, Supreme Clear Void, ninety-nine thousand nine hundred ninety million qi. Later, in the first year of the Red Bright, the Divine Treasure Lord was transformed and born; after two kalpas, at the first year of the Supreme Emperor, he issued books, styled Three Sovereigns Cave Spirit Supreme Clear Supreme Ultimate Palace.

(Yu Chanzi Master Zhao regards Jade Clear as the Golden Palace, Supreme Clear as the Fire Palace, Great Clear as the Earth Palace, not reaching Wood and Water. Scholars have doubted his saying but did not seek its principle. Yet of the Five Elements, Metal is the principal; Metal has no qi, it produces qi in the Zhen direction, which is Wood. Metal overcomes Wood, as husband and wife; Metal engenders Water, as parent and child. Of the five things that decay, only Metal does not corrupt; it enters Fire without burning, enters Water without wetting, enters Earth without harm, enters Wood without damage. When the perfected man understands this and refines the elixir, Metal, Fire, Earth combine by analogy; for Water and Wood they meet without arrangement. An ancient immortal poem says: “All Five Elements are in Earth, the Four Symbols do not depart from Metal.” The ancestral qi of the Three Treasures is from the Three Origins. Examining the scripture, the characters “Dark Quiet Mysterious Penetrating Origin” occur not only in the Sichuan edition but everywhere. The Chapter on the Birth of Spirits of the Nine Heavens, even the editions examined by princes and lords of our dynasty, have such issues; much the same with other scriptures. Also the character “Taiyi” mistaken for “Jieguan,” many such cases. The qi of the Mixed Mysterious Great Primordial High Jade Emptiness, the Red Mixed Great Primordial Mysterious Supreme Purple Void qi; the previous said High Jade Emptiness qi, the Red Mixed Great Primordial lacks one character, should be just High Jade Emptiness qi. The Heavenly Treasure Lord calls himself High; the Spirit Treasure Lord should call himself Origin Supreme, without the two words “High.” As for Dark Quiet Mysterious Penetrating, the character “Luo” is missing, should be Supreme Jade Emptiness qi. Recently collating, the Daozang’s versions missing the character or including it; the dot strokes are similar; it is feared that at the initial transmission there was a scribal error and repetition, hence removed; otherwise it would be a missing character, how could the Three Origins have qi, only two origins? The principle would be incoherent. The character “Luo” should be added below Dark Quiet Mysterious; High Jade Emptiness qi to be corrected by the learned. This is the doubt passed by Spring and Autumn. The Three Origins appear in the “Scripture of the Sect of the Three Caves.” Since Wang Xichao entered the Dao, he has troubled that the teaching is too diffuse, lacking a master teacher, with many errors. Occasionally there are those claiming to know but arrogantly exaggerating, with so-called engraving and delineation without salt. Considering recent times’ ritual publications and written signs, often calling white black and nothing something; the knowledgeable should see this.)


Though the three titles differ in years and names, they are essentially one. Divided into the three mysterious origins and three qi, governing the Three Treasures; all are the revered gods of the three qi, named as giving birth to the three qi; the three titles together produce nine qi. The nine qi arise before the Great Void, hidden in the emptiness. No light, no image; no form, no name; no colour, no trace; no sound, no voice.

(Yi shot the center of the target but could not make man without self-praise; the Dao descended and became qi, but could not make man without name and title. From one to three, from three to nine, though the three titles differ, their essence is one and the same. When one strives for them and cannot attain, is this not above form? When one reads the titles, is this not below form? The three titles are Heavenly Treasure Lord styled Supreme Great Possessing Jade Pure Palace; Spirit Treasure Lord styled Supreme Clear Mysterious Capital Jade, Seven Treasures, Purple Micro Palace; Divine Treasure Lord styled Three Sovereigns Cave Spirit Supreme Clear Supreme Ultimate Palace. At the Origin of Origins’ beginning, there was no heaven and earth; with one body all things were born; thus styled Great Possessing Jade Pure Palace. At Dragon Han’s opening of the chart, heaven and earth divided; the Spirit Treasure was born in the Western Heavenly Yucha mountain; at that time, Origin of Origins Heavenly King sat on Jade Capital Mountain, inhaling celestial qi and drinking earth springs. The Jade Capital Mountain palaces were decorated with seven treasures, gold, and jade; the central administration was at the Purple Micro Upper Palace. After the Spirit Treasure was born, the Origin of Origins Heavenly King appointed him lord; hence the title. At Red Bright time, the division of the Three Sovereigns, the Divine Treasure was born, marking the beginning of the descent of the Cave Spirit; thus styled Three Sovereigns Cave Spirit Supreme Clear Supreme Ultimate Palace. The Supreme Ultimate Palace is one of the nine palaces, where the immortals dwell. The palace officials, true men, ministers, and nobles have their ranks. Though the three titles differ, they stem from one Origin of Origins body. Taking Dragon Han as the former kalpa, Red Bright as the middle kalpa, Kaixiang as the present kalpa. The Mysterious Origin is the mysterious qi without birth, accumulating clear qi to become blue; the Cave Origin produces original qi, accumulating void to form white; the Void Origin produces primal qi, accumulating light to form yellow. When the three qi are sufficient, then produce the nine qi. The nine qi are the one yellow performing qi, the nine qi. The three qi all originate in the three voids: Great Primordial belongs to Jade Clear; Great Void belongs to Supreme Clear; Cave Void belongs to Supreme Clear. One qi is born in Great Primordial, called Great Beginning; originating before the Great Void, called Great Origin; hidden in the Cave Void, called Great Element. Formerly the Origin of Origins Heavenly King and Nine Heavens True Kings were born before the nine qi, when there was yet no year or month; they measured one year as the distance of ninety-nine million nine hundred ninety-one thousand li between one qi and the next. When they emerged before the Great Void, hidden in the Cave Void, one cannot see their head or tail following; no light, form, shape, name, colour, trace, sound, or voice; who can know them? Therefore it is said the Dao follows nature.)

The Dao moves and rules the world, opening and illuminating mystery. The three colours of chaos appear and vanish. The movement pushes to the utmost, the three qi open light. Qi is clear, high, and pure; accumulating yang forms heaven. Qi congeals and thickens; accumulating stagnation forms earth. The nine qi stand upright as sun, moon, stars, and constellations. Yin and yang, five phases, people’s grades and things all receive and generate.

(Heaven moves it; who is its master? It must rely on qi to move. When heaven and earth are newly divided, the Divine Treasure Lord governs with Dark Quiet Mysterious qi, opening and dividing it. Closed door is called Kun; opened door is called Qian. Closed, all things begin to wrap; opened, all things begin to be born. This is the three births of all things. When chaos is divided, the three qi of blue, yellow, and white first appear; as if existing and not existing, without form or shape; called having and not having. Who pushes this? When movement comes, it moves; who closes and opens? When number reaches the limit, it opens. Heaven and earth wait for this to stand; sun and moon wait for this to shine; then the nine qi stand upright with order, and the order is within bounds; yin and yang, five phases interweave in order; people and things all come to be, accomplishing creation’s work; what is greater than this?)

Heaven and earth and myriad changes, if not nurtured by the three origins and guided by the nine qi, cannot be born. Three qi are the honour of heaven and earth; nine qi are the root of all things; thus the three combine to form virtue, the ultimate of heaven and earth.

(Qi coming to the body is called birth; qi leaving the body is death. All with teeth and hair, all moving and stirring, are the same. Except for those nurtured by the three origins and guided by the nine qi, none can be born. Man alone is the most spiritual among all things; among the myriad things he occupies the place of the three powers, thus is to be esteemed. Zhuangzi said: Heaven and earth are born with me. Having obtained birth, their arrival is no different; after endowment, all their acts differ. Why then is heaven and earth long-lasting, and man’s life short? Because they do not understand the principle of the combining of three to form virtue, the ultimate of heaven and earth. Ultimate means the middle. The “Spring and Autumn Annals of Zuo” says: Man receives the middle to establish life. The “Book of Documents” says: The Supreme Deity descends to the common people, that is the Daoist Yellow Court. Yellow is the colour of earth. The Court is the centre of the four directions. Heaven one produces water, in man it is essence, stored in the kidneys. The “Yellow Court Scripture” says: Left is lesser yang, right is greater yin; behind is the secret door; before is the birth gate. The kidneys are the gate of life and death; thus the work of nourishing must begin with the Yellow Court. Essence is stored in the kidneys; qi is born of essence; mingled in the heart, the heart’s fluids mingle, refined in the Yellow Court. If one knows the mingling is not mistaken, then essence unites with qi, qi unites with spirit, spirit unites with Dao; thus the principle of life and life is not lost, the middle of heaven and earth. Thus the combining of three to form virtue is the extreme of heaven and earth.)

Man’s birth is within the womb; nurtured by the three origins, the nine qi form the shape; hence in the ninth month spirits are scattered, qi full and able to sound; the voice has spirit complete; the nine heavens celebrate. The Supreme One holds the talisman, the emperor ranks and orders fate, records and registers, manages fate and determines calculation, the Five Emperors oversee birth, the Holy Mother guards the chamber, heavenly and earthly gods and spirits, the Three Realms are all guarded. The nine heavenly stewards stand in the court, facing east, reading the “Chapter on the Birth of Spirits of the Nine Heavens” nine times; men then all the myriad spirits sing respectfully; women sing to serve the myriad spirits; men respectfully accept the mandate; women respectfully obey the mandate; thus is born. The Nine Heavenly Stewards do not send down the life chapter; the myriad spirits do not sing respectfully; life does not come.

(Explanatory note from the “Great Elixir Hidden Book”: Man receives birth from the heavenly soul, formed in the primordial spirit, revolving the nine qi, supporting the fate of the Supreme One, opening the three ways, accumulating spirits in the hidden palace. Therefore the mysterious fluids wrap seven times, flow and spread dew; the sun and moon shine on the six voids; mouth and eyes move their sacred instruments; clouds move and rain fall, virtue resembling heaven and earth; within the womb formed, the five causes complete. The Way of man is so weighty. The five causes are five spirits; the three ways are three truths; the five spirits are the souls of heaven; the three truths are the way of heaven; the nine qi are the womb of heaven; the Supreme One is the source of heaven; the sun and moon are the eyes of heaven; the mysterious fluids are the moisture of heaven; the hidden palace is the mansion of heaven; spirit qi is the transformation of heaven and the change of the origin. Also it says: The Origin Father and Mysterious Mother, Origin Father rules qi, the transforming ruler precedes the emperor, Mysterious Mother rules essence, transforms and forms the womb. The Supreme One blends, the five spirits hold the registers, set forth talismans for the five spirits, each having its lord. Thus the three palaces guard the true, the myriad joints receive spirit; emperor lords set the registers, fate is without deviation; a thousand chariots and ten thousand riders lift the body to dawn. To consider this poem, its meaning is largely the same as the “Chapter on the Birth of Spirits.” The so-called birth within the womb, nurtured by the three origins, nine qi form shape, means the Mysterious Mother produces essence and forms the womb, revolving the nine qi, the three ways spirit. The ninth month spirits are dispersed, qi full and able to sound, means the sun and moon shine on the six voids, mouth and eyes move their sacred instruments. The nine heavens celebrate, the Supreme One holds the talisman, the emperor ranks and orders fate, records and registers, manages fate and determines calculation, the Five Emperors oversee birth, until life is not born. That is, the Supreme One blends, the five spirits hold talisman and registers, the emperor lords set registers, fate is without deviation, a thousand chariots and ten thousand riders lift the body to dawn. The Supreme One is, carefully according to the “Mysterious Mirror Scripture”: The Supreme One is the great lord of long life, holding the spirit and revolving the wheel, being one with heaven and earth. As to noise and dust, how could he be burdened? This is why Zhuangzi called the husks and chaff of Yao and Shun, roaming freely beyond dust and dirt. Thus Madam Fengdu says: The eight ways meet the original ancestor, riding the motions, viewing dust and sand.)

The Heavenly Treasure Lord chants it to open the light of heaven and earth. The Spirit Treasure Lord chants it to open the soul of the nine dark nights. The Divine Treasure Lord chants it to control myriad spirits. The Supreme One chants it to perfect body and spirit. The Emperor Lord chants it to form shape. The Nine Heavens chant it to give birth to man. The scholar chants it to ascend heaven.

(The Dao is not far from man; man’s way is distant only from himself. Man and heaven united, originally without separation. Reasoning thus, Heavenly Treasure is the Origin of Origins; Spirit Treasure is the Dao Lord; Divine Treasure is Lord Lao. Heavenly Treasure born at Dragon Han’s beginning; heaven and earth newly divided, no more colours above, no more abyss below; a vast deep Brahma, vast and empty without light. The Heavenly Treasure Lord opens and divides with the Chapter on the Birth of Spirits, arranging ranks above and below; as the “Scripture on Deliverance” says, all writing shines. The Spirit Treasure Lord born at Dragon Han’s opening of the chart, the leader of deliverance; hence opening the soul of the nine dark nights; the “Scripture on Deliverance” says nothing written is not delivered. The Divine Treasure Lord born at the first year of Red Bright; myriad forms spread, the great void nurtures wonder, the great image manifests spirit; by the qi of yang essence the supreme sage and high true are born; by the qi of quiet and emptiness the Origin Lord and Holy Mother are born; by the fierce qi the heavenly warriors are born; the remainder of qi nurtures myriad spirits; hence controlling myriad spirits. The “Scripture on Deliverance” says: Five writings open and broaden, universally spreading spirits. Control means to prevent false acts’ might. As to the body, the qi of the Heavenly Treasure Lord is in the mud pellet; spirit leaks from the eyes as light; hence opening the light of heaven and earth. The Spirit Treasure Lord’s qi is in the crimson palace, the place of the spirit’s birth in the blood. Blood is yin, stored in the liver; the liver governs the soul; hence opening the soul of the long night. The “Great Mysterious Scripture” says: It cuts off and blocks the dead gate, so that the Supreme Deity solidifies the elixir origin; it releases and liberates the seven ancestors’ hidden souls, ascending the southern palace. The Divine Treasure Lord’s qi is in the lower cinnabar field, the Yellow Court, the seat of spirit birth. The Scripture says: It scatters and transforms into five forms, changing into myriad spirits; this is the Yellow Court called the inner chapter. Hence controlling myriad spirits. The Supreme One commands all spirits, called Wuyou Shou. The Emperor Lord is Fengling Fan. The above are the body’s spirits. When form is formed, the four limbs and five viscera are complete; the nine month spirits are dispersed, about to bear man. The Daoist who understands this principle, seeing the three palaces as the Three Treasures, the nine heavens united, will not perish but ascend the nine heavens; how can the Way be far from man, if he cease his non-acting?)

Ghost spirits hearing it ascend and move upward. Common men hearing it long endure. The shades hearing it open deliverance. The decayed hearing it emit smoke. Infants hearing it gain speech. Dead bones hearing it return to man.

(From the Heavenly Treasure Lord to the scholar, those gaining our Way are emperors and kings above and below. From ghost spirits to dead bones, those losing our Way see light above and earth below. Yet there is difference between chanting and hearing. Chanting means to obtain the Way, chanting Yao’s words and acting Yao’s deeds. Now, alas, those not obtaining the Way fall into ghost spirits, common men, and shades, far from the Way. Once they hear this scripture, among ghost spirits they ascend, their name enters Donghua, no longer subordinate to the Three Officials’ ghosts. Carefully according to the “Scripture of the Flying Immortal Sword”: Those with likeness and talent, surpassing all hopes, at last receive the Three Officials, recorded as virtuous ghosts; after four hundred years become underworld rulers; from then onward, after three hundred years they form one step. Now hearing this scripture, without waiting for the limit, can ascend. Common men possess all six desires; hearing this scripture, six desires are unsoiled, and live long in the world. Shades are those imprisoned in hell; now hearing this scripture, they are delivered to the southern palace. Decayed are plants and trees; decayed means substance no longer; now being made to emit smoke, what reason is there? This scripture is the flying mysterious qi, forming spiritual text; the world’s plants and trees are born by qi. Now making them emit smoke is their qi; smoke is the wood’s qi. Wood contains fire; substance possesses fire. Now decayed, the principle of life is lost. Now it responds to this scripture by qi nourishing qi, gradually gaining living substance; hence decayed hears it to emit smoke. If applied to man, it means loss of spirit. Essence is the decayed thing; smoke is like man’s qi; if qi cease, is he not then decayed? Hence Su Dongpo harmonized Yuanming’s “Form and Shadow Poem”: You rise as smoke to fire, when fire is exhausted you part. The scripture speaks thus; only then is the spirit’s wondrous power known, inseparable with things. Formerly, Zhongyang said: Those with the Way carry one gourd, containing the great elixir, mixed with millet, freely given to men. At evening, the millet is used up but the elixir remains; he said: “Why is men’s blessing so little?” Thereupon he left the elixir on the withered palm tree of the jade bureau; the next day he saw the palm tree reborn, the decayed emitting smoke; is this not reason? Infants can only cry but cannot speak; now hearing this scripture they gain speech, for their orifices open and are enlightened. Dead bones have soul and spirit separated, the human way is far; now hearing this scripture they again pass as men. Formerly Xu Jia had died, passing many years; once the Old Lord by the Great Mysterious gave him a talisman to revive; his power was talisman’s, this power scripture’s, both returning by different routes.)

The mysteries of the Three Treasures are the roots of myriad beings; hence unknown to ghosts and spirits, but can be heard by common men.

(The Three Treasures are Heavenly Treasure, Spirit Treasure, Divine Treasure. They give birth to heaven and earth, gods and ghosts, emperors and spirits; utmost stillness without change, utmost purity without mixture, covering the great heaven and earth with nothing left out, hiding the deepest ghosts and spirits beyond description. The myriad beings, continually changing and never exhausted, may be called mysterious. Hence the scripture says: The Dao is the mystery of all things. The Three Treasures are again the mystery of the Dao. Mystery means depth, great origin and great ancestor. The “Great Mysterious” says: The mystery of heaven is northwest, accumulating essence. The mystery of earth is the yellow spring, hiding souls. The mystery of man is thought, storing the utmost spirit. The “Nanhua Jing” says: Auspiciousness is born in mystery. The old commentaries say “not yet” is mystery, referring to Kun. Now the “Great Mysterious” points to yellow as Kun. The great Brahma’s qi arises from the northwest, all living things seek it, thus establishing heaven’s Way. Souls dwell in Kun, all things prosper, establishing earth’s Way. When heaven and earth are established, yin and yang are complete. What is born cannot not be born; what changes cannot not change; thus it says the mysteries of the Three Treasures are the roots of myriad things. Formerly saying ghost spirits hearing it ascend, common men hearing it long endure, now again saying unknown to ghosts and spirits, but can be heard by common men. Where ghosts and spirits do not know, and common men have not heard, and where they know and have heard, there is difference; they cannot be spoken of on the same day. Those who obtain this Way cannot be examined. Is this what the world commonly hears? The utmost words cannot be so lightly obtained; the Way of spirit-immortals is rare.)

The Way of the Superior Way is sevenfold; the Way of the Highest Way is threefold; the Middle Way is sixfold; the Lower Way is eightfold. The “Chapter on the Birth of Spirits” corresponds to the “Thirty-nine Chapters of the Great Mysterious” as front and back. Examining the “Thirty-nine Chapters of the Great Mysterious,” it is the Way of the Highest Truth, hence called the Highest Way. The Way of the Highest Way is to desire immortals and to seek corpse liberation, extinguishing transmigration, ending in the Way of Immortals. Without this text one is like relying on qi only, until chanting the scripture nine times; having obtained this text, one must keep a long fast and observe precepts, exhaust dust leaks, quiet the heart and meditate, then practise this method; having obtained this method, one must reach nine times, then may the three realms raise one’s name, befriend the Five Emperors, be called a true man. Being called true man, if not fully prepared, then to ten thousand times, when the Way is complete, one ascends the white day, that is the true origin. Now this scripture’s meaning has reached this point; the Origin of Origins Heavenly Lord imparts it to the Flying Great Sage Infinite Spirit King. After passing it on, the ritual is complete, the heavens resume their places. The Heavenly Lord again solemnly warns the Flying Spirit King: This chapter of the Nine Heavens is the mysterious flying qi of the three caves, the three combine to form sound, forming true text, mixing the myriad spirits, hidden in rhyme and inner name. This is the circulation part. Though the middle words are many, the true purpose is fully expounded in the true part. Hence the strict warning: the Origin of Origins forbidden book, do not lightly transmit. The Flying Spirit King repeatedly entreats; the Origin Heavenly Lord also repeatedly warns, explaining why the words are many. Though nine chapters form one scripture’s purpose, placed after, it is like the “Scripture on Deliverance, Great Brahma Hidden Text,” written by the Dao Lord, attached after the preface of the “Scripture on Deliverance,” with no different meaning; the learner should obtain it himself. The mind of the sage aiding all beings is always present; yet placed above all heavens, who in the world can know it? Hence the scriptures of the Three Caves circulate among men, all are voices of the sage’s heart. Now chanting the scripture one obtains that heart; by that heart one meets all the sages; the scripture’s presence is the sage’s presence; how can it not be revered? The “Chapter on the Birth of Spirits” is the ancestor qi of heaven and earth, the father and mother of myriad life; the Three Treasures themselves esteem it, so much more man. In Fengdu Six Caves Palace there is the place especially for punishing slanders against the Three Treasures’ Great Vehicle; this scripture is the words of the Three Treasures; if one does not esteem these words, what differs from slander? The nine heavens most true. Most means highest. Secret in the Great Possessing Palace, the place of the Daozang. Carefully according to the “Dance of the Seven Transformations Scripture”: The Supreme Clear Treasure Scriptures three hundred volumes, Jade Secrets nine thousand chapters, talismanic diagrams seven thousand chapters, and the Chapter of Nature, are secret above the Nine Heavens, in the Great Possessing Palace. The Great Possessing Palace is the Jade Clear Palace. Also according to the “Scripture of Golden Truth and Jade Light”: The ninefold golden frame, purple yang jade platform, the ninefold means deep sealing; the frame is like a case. According to the “Scripture of Dao Treasures” there are jade frames and golden frames, both belonging to the Nine Heavens. Above the three passes is the jade platform, on the platform a jade frame, the place where the Supreme Emperor Supreme Truth High Deity Jade is enshrined. To explain this is not only to esteem, but also to keep secret. Without Dragon Han’s opening of the chart, the Spirit King braving prohibitions and earnestly entreating, how could this text be seen? Likely the thief will suffer punishment, the reverent will be with immortals. The thief deserves warning; the reverent may not fail in effort.)

In the palaces of the Three Origins, there are always golden names, purple characters engraved in books; in the next life one should be a person of the Three Pure Immortals, and will obtain this text. Having the affinity and meeting, one should bear gold treasure to offer the master, sincerely follow the covenant, close the heart and faithfully carry out, and not lightly divulge; the wind knife tests the body.

(The Three Origins’ examination is not only of dead souls. All who obtain the Way and those who have not, both are involved. Only the golden name and purple characters are used to distinguish those who study immortality; thus in the Daozang’s records, the Three Origins’ examiners of hell’s grades are called the black register. Those who have the golden name and purple characters indeed have such a difference. Formerly Li Jue, a common man of Jiangyang, his merit long recorded in the immortal register; though not yet ascending to heaven, his name was already written in gold in Huayang Cave Heaven. Not only among those who study immortality there are such characters and ranks. The historian Liang Yuandi when King of Xiangdong, once recorded loyal ministers, righteous men, and literary beauties, writing them with three kinds of brush: loyal and filial with golden pen, persons of virtue with silver pen, literary beauties with bamboo pen. The “Supreme Jade Secret Scripture” says: In the Purple Micro Palace there are golden frames, jade books, red gold writings, blue jade slips, all of such sort. If one has past good merit, all will
