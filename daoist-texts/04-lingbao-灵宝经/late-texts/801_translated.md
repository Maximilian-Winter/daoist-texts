The Heavenly Exalted One addressed the Supreme Great Way Lord, saying: In the Middle Origin Palace of the Spiritual Treasures of the Mysterious Profundities there were formerly the Jade Register and Brief Text of the Immortals’ Rites, subdivided into three parts: Supreme Origin, Middle Origin, and Lower Origin. Each part contained eight hundred articles, the three parts combined numbering two thousand four hundred articles. All were inscribed on golden and jade tablets, recorded by Lord Zuo of the Immortal Capital in the Middle Origin Palace. Since the Dragon-Han era, it declined into chaos; its texts were altered and many were no longer complete. Until the first year of Red Brightness, the Supreme Sage collated and composed anew, selecting essentials, the sections numbering eighty articles each, the three parts together numbering two hundred and forty articles, kept secret within the Three Origins’ Palace. Two hundred and forty attendants, daughters of Jade Splendour and Golden Morning Jade Children, respectively, burn incense and attend the scriptures, checking and amending omissions and delays. Following the mysterious method of transmission once every forty thousand kalpas. The divine and true ones descend to teach; the transition is urgent; the Way requires perfected true men to descend every four hundred years to instruct and transform; the three transmissions are heard within forty years. Should the time not be fulfilled, the spiritual text will be lightly proclaimed; the seven ancestors will be imprisoned in hell; their bodies bear the wind knife; for myriad kalpas there will be no origin.

The Heavenly Exalted One said: The natural majestic rites, the reverences and obeisances of the heavens, the rites and rules of perfected true men, those who obtain and observe them have had countless kalpas of causal connection, their earlier lives having golden tablets and jade names. Among the Immortal section, those who are to obtain immortal transcendence should see the text, to perfect their truth. Those who cultivate it shall swiftly ride the dragon chariot, ascend in the white sun of the morning. Those who serve it, the seven ancestors shall immediately leave and depart from hell, ascend to Heaven’s Court, roam freely in the Middle Origin Jade Immortal Palace, where the gates are pure and solemn, ten thousand disasters shall not afflict, the three realms shall revere and protect, myriad spirits shall attend the gates. This Way is noble and venerable, and should be kept secret. The Supreme One bows and makes reverence, delivering these essential words.
