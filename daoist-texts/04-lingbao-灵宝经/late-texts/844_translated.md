## The Scripture of the Creation of the Supreme Mysterious and Numinous Treasures of the Many Heavens and Worlds

### Chapter One: The Exordium of the Scripture Spoken by the Celestial Venerable

The Most High Celestial Venerable dwelt in the Spirit Bird Mountain, discoursing with the celestial beings upon the twelve divisions of the Scripture. Then he divided it into four hundred thousand sections, which his disciples wrote down; hence it is called the Wonderful Dao. At that time the Celestial Venerable transformed himself into a layman, possessing boundless wisdom, and declared to the assembly: Since my study of the Dao, through ninety-one kalpas, I have ceased seeking and thought, attained the state of no-thought and the perfect communication of the kings of saints. By penetrating illumination I have seen the heavens and earth decay and be renewed, sentient beings die and be reborn, without end or exhaustion. As the sun and moon revolve about the Kunlun Mountain, encircling and illuminating the four directions, so the world revolves and renews without cessation. There are four thousand Kunlun mountains, four thousand suns and moons, four thousand worlds; there are four thousand great seas, four thousand palaces of the great dragon kings, four thousand palaces of the great golden-winged bird kings; the great evil paths rise tens of thousands of li, the great divine mountains thousands of li in height, and the great divine trees myriad in variety, with vast hells of the earth. All these form what you call the number of the minor kalpa worlds; a thousand such minor kalpa worlds constitute a middle kalpa world; a thousand middle kalpa worlds constitute the three realms. The great kalpa worlds begin their formation from there, and after seven days all appear at once, burning and destroying everything utterly, then again are renewed as before, without end or cessation. Such is the natural order, without agency of any god. Likewise, sentient beings die and are reborn, but their lives are prolonged and hidden from men’s knowledge. Moreover, when sentient beings die, their form is destroyed and their spirit moves according to the karmic causes and effects wrought in their lives, arriving at the Five Paths. What are the Five Paths? The first is the heavenly path, the second the human path, the third the path of hell, the fourth the path of hungry ghosts, the fifth the path of beasts and insects. If a man in life accumulates deep virtue and enters the highest blessing, he is born into the heavenly path, enjoying long life, good form, unending peace and happiness, and retains knowledge of past destinies and causes. If he obtains middle blessing in life, he is born into the human path, attaining gates of wealth and honour, lacking nothing. If his blessing is slight and sins many, he is born into the lower blessing, entering gates of poverty and lowliness, meeting with all manner of evil, stricken with blindness, deafness, dumbness, paralysis, and six diseases, with foul and ignoble forms, like slaves and servants with loathsome bodies. Though the upper two paths vary in excellence, they are still better than the suffering of birth in the three lower paths. If in life one is covetous, stingy, refusing to give to the hungry and thirsty, and not aiding the desperate, one is born into the path of hungry ghosts. One takes on the form of a ghost, belly like a hanging drum, throat narrow as a thread; though good food is seen, one cannot obtain it, suffering long hunger, with ugly form and colour, and long years, wishing for extinction but not obtaining it. If in life one disrespects parents, has no kindness to the nine clans, harms the common people, and is detested by the multitude, one is born into the path of hell. One suffers the form of the punishment ghosts, ever tortured and tormented beyond description. If in life one delights in killing living beings, hunting as a trade, slaughtering as an occupation, not knowing to cultivate virtue but only to do evil, one is born in the path of beasts, becoming sheep, cattle, pigs, geese, chickens, ducks, receiving the karmic retribution of being slaughtered and sold by weight. Such is the fruit of the deeds of previous lives; who can see this except those who have attained the Dao? Since you do not yet believe, I recite this verse:

Heaven and earth truly change, what can remain forever?  
Born one must enter death, spirit follows the five paths.  

Should any dare deceive, hell will bind and connect;  
Only cultivate good deeds, repent and root out sin.  

The talisman of the Most High’s radiant spirit, practice it without sloth,  
Surpassing the three realms, escaping the five sufferings, the wheel turns unceasing, attaining the rank of the Perfected Man.

### Chapter Two: The King Kunlun Mountain and the Four Worlds Under Heaven

The Dao says: Before the profound transformation I bore the title of the Most High. I saw the King of Kunlun Mountain, made of gold, silver, glazed tiles, and crystal water. Its height is three million three hundred and thirty-six thousand li above, surrounded by a great sea of the same depth and breadth. The earth beneath is two trillion li deep. Next below is earth also two trillion li deep. Next below is millet gold twenty billion li thick; next below is strong iron twenty billion li; next below is water eighty billion li deep; next below is the great wind, five hundred and twenty billion li deep and thick. This great wind supports the earth, which floats upon the water, which floats upon the wind, beneath which is great emptiness, differing from heaven and earth. North of Kunlun Mountain shines with golden light; its world is called Yudan Yue, extending forty thousand li; its people live a thousand years, hair and nails of a metallic hue; men and women are equal in stature, none higher or lower; the people delight in goodness and do not teach one another to do evil. These four worlds under heaven are the finest among the three worlds. To the west of Kunlun Mountain shines crystal water; its world is called the Great Tang Domain, shaped like a crescent moon, thirty-two thousand li broad and long; its people have human affairs of varying length and shortness of life. To the east of Kunlun Mountain shines silver light; called the Bilu Domain, it is forty-six thousand li in extent, perfectly round; its people live three hundred years, some long, some short, all with human affairs and deaths. To the south of Kunlun Mountain shines glazed tile light; extending twenty-eight thousand li, named the Discarded Worthy Domain; its people are sometimes long-lived, sometimes short, suffering the most among mankind, less than the other three worlds; their years are uncertain. Yet there is one thing surpassing the three worlds and the upper heavens—its people are courageous and fierce, and seeking the Dao is easy. If they cultivate virtue and follow my Dao, they will directly rise to the heavenly path, or emerge from the three realms, attaining the supreme Dao. If they accumulate sin, they die and enter hell; in a moment, no fixed rank is given. The Kunlun Mountain lies in the Yellow Tseng World, where the Emperor Taiwei may dwell centrally. There are four heavenly kings, each guarding one of the four borders and ruling a portion of the heavens. On the first and eighth days of the month, they send envoys down to inspect the earthly world, scrutinizing emperors, ministers, dragons, ghosts, and the myriad creeping and crawling creatures, their thoughts, words, and deeds of good and evil. On the fourteenth day, perfected men descend; on the fifteenth and eighteenth days, immortal kings descend; on the twenty-third and twenty-fourth days, envoys descend again; on the twenty-eighth and twenty-ninth days, immortal kings descend; on the thirtieth day, the celestial kings descend. These four descents include the sun, moon, five planets, and twenty-eight constellations, among which the many heavens come down in force to inspect evil and offences. You should, on these days, change your mind and improve your conduct, keep fasts and repent your faults, recite the scriptures and observe precepts, and do only good deeds. Those who can do so will be loved and protected by the heavenly officials, their fates calculated by the officers of destiny, their life spans fulfilled without injustice. When their life ends, they rise to the heavenly path, clothed and fed by nature, in endless happiness. This is the utmost truth, and since you do not believe, I recite this verse:

Behold the four worlds beneath heaven,  
Proud in these words without secret.  
Life passes like lightning,  
How can the field of virtue be unplanted?  

In dark hells, countless kalpa years,  
Heaven’s laws have no pardons,  
Why then boast of rank?  

Heaven’s laws ride the truth,  
Upholding righteous gods and demons;  
Talismans ascend blessings with the Dao,  
Mystic capital officials enforce laws strictly,  
Offenders receive no pardon,  
Swift as the law commands.

### Chapter Three: The Sun and Moon Revolving, Illuminating the Four Worlds and the Celestial Ranks

The Dao says: On Kunlun Mountain, thirty-six thousand li square, dwell the holy and divine, each having their proper place. Moreover, there are the sun and moon celestial sovereigns, full of light and splendour, illuminating the world everywhere. Within the moon city, five winds circulate, and in the moon are four palaces and five consorts. There is a lofty tree four thousand li high, casting a shadow upon the moon’s interior; the good see it, and its fruit is ineffable. There are also seven immortal abodes, and seven precious mountains, with seven precious trees. These immortals always cultivate my Dao, never suffering premature death or loss of lifespan. If you desire to be born in this long-lived heaven, you must cultivate these five practices:  
1. Compassionate heart, no killing, love preserving life.  
2. Virtuous and upright, not stealing, aiding the poor and needy.  
3. Pure in thought and conduct, not violating others’ persons.  
4. Observing fasts and precepts, diligently without weariness.  
5. Sincere and truthful, without deceit, reducing wine and guarding against faults.  
Doing these five things surely brings birth in heaven. Since you do not believe, I recite this verse:

Time’s course cannot be bound,  
Alas! Life passes swiftly;  
How can one generate sins?  
Heaven’s officers record strictly.  

Once gone there is no rescue,  
The soul sinks to hell;  
Hasten to be born in good heaven,  
Touch not the three paths of misery.

The talisman of the Most High’s revered spirit scripture, nurturing all beings, opening the blind and darkened, mixing wondrous fragrant flowers, cultivating the heart with reverence, attaining the body of golden light, unbounded lifespan, swift as the law commands.

### Chapter Four: The Great Profound Worlds of the Many Heavens

The Dao says: The people of the three realms have three kinds of birth: flower birth, transformation birth, and womb birth. Flower birth occurs from deep accumulation of virtue, born in the lotus as celestial beings. Transformation birth arises from the power of their merit, born by transformation. Only womb birth, with shallow virtue and small merit, is the lowest, relying on spiritual fleshly form, with short and fleeting life, unlike the celestial beings. Although the celestial beings enjoy happiness, they still dwell within the three realms; at their life’s end, they are reborn in the nether earth, unable to attain the Dao. The perfected man never dies, able to be and not be; adamantine is not fixed, stone walls cannot obstruct, thunder cannot hasten, water and fire cannot harm, the many heavens cannot separate, wisdom cannot be prolonged; ghosts and spirits all submit, all who live look up to him. This is the supreme person of the three realms; those who attain the Dao unite their body with the void, becoming endless. Transformation birth occurs first with good merit, responding and transforming accordingly. To aspire to ascend and be saved is like escaping the body to save a beast, seeking the Dao forgetting death. One should perform myriad good deeds, sever worldly ties, dwell in mountains and forests, observe the rites of the grass sages, keep fasts day and night, bathe and purify, cleanse the mouth and teeth, avoid foul and filthy food. Now the spirit is attached, not harming living beings, only following the Dao, vowing never to cease, to attain the Dao and fly as an immortal. Such teaching is spoken to the celestial officers; Daoists have the method of wearing the ceremonial robe, which is not to be practiced by emperors or commoners. But if one can uphold the ten good deeds, cultivate and observe the five precepts, avoid the ten evils, one will surely be born in the upper heavens, with the lifespan of eight kalpas, and when accompanied by sages will attain the Dao; I do not deceive you.

The many heavens work in concert, responding as wished, recording merit at the immortal capital, and the various demons, ghosts, and spirits who come to listen increase their ranks and families, early attaining the heavenly path, becoming golden light perfected persons, never lightly disregarding the mysteries of the capital law, the officers are clear as the law commands.

### Chapter Five: The Great and Small Kalpas of the Heaven and Earth’s Ruin and Renewal

The Dao says: The earth suffers three disasters: first fire, second water, third wind. The small kalpa comes first, followed by the great kalpa. When the small kalpa arrives, yin and yang qi change, drought and flood are irregular, the five grains are deficient, all wood, stone, grass, and thorn, and the fingers and claws of living beings become swords and knives, slaying one another; the people all die, and human life grows short and shallow, deceived suddenly and deluded; within seven days all kill one another utterly. Then the great flood rises, washing and purging heaven and earth, mountains and rivers are changed, the land made level. Sweet dew descends; perfected men descend, their bodies shining bright, called Kunlun. At that time the flood waters are beautiful and sweet, removing ailments, one kind obtains seven gains; if there is any impurity or inconvenience, the earth immediately cracks and heals. Human life is eighty thousand years; women marry at five hundred years; the world is joyous, as with the upper heavens. After the perfected men depart, later generations gradually accumulate sin, and after many tens of millions of years, hell overflows, and the great kalpa is to come. Emperors, ministers, fathers and sons, all destroy one another; the people have no loyalty or filial piety; rulers lack compassion and benevolence; bandits rise rampant; rebellion and violence persist; the suffering of evil is greater than before the great kalpa. Under the four heavens, human nature is wholly evil; the simple customs of old are gone. Then the great kalpa begins; great disasters arise; on the second day two disasters appear, on the third, fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh days all come together lasting tens of thousands of billions of years, rivers and seas dry up, all sentient beings perish. The Celestial Venerable looks upon the earth; men and women scatter like grass, their colours foul, losing their light, their bodies heavy, unable to fly away, dwelling always in suffering below. Then the Celestial Venerable pities these sufferings, commands the sun and moon to be reborn, the constellations to pass again, wind and rain to be timely, sweet dew to fall, springs to well forth, no disease among men, glorious colours shining. Their lives last sixty thousand years, eating natural grain and wearing natural clothing. Later generations grow thin in nature and conduct, sins arise, years shorten, natural food and clothing fade, they perish suddenly, eating the flesh of birds and beasts, wearing their skins and feathers, killing one another, sins accumulating day by day; yin and yang are unregulated, rain and drought unseasonable; in winter they dwell in holes, in summer nests, to avoid calamities, without food, clothing, rites, and propriety; dying they enter hell, not born in heaven. For countless billions of years, the sages and holy ones descend in compassion and teach, riding oxen and horses, making fire, farming, and sericulture, clothing and feeding rulers, maintaining order, establishing differences of rank and honour, able to practice supreme good. Those who conform to the Dao survive in heaven; those who do not enter hell. Endless kalpas with no end. For this reason I recite this verse:

Hell is full of sin and suffering,  
No end to the kalpas of release.  
Malice and poison take root in the body,  
Believe this, do not mock.  

Form is destroyed and returns to soil,  
Spirit follows merit’s foundation.  
Heaven and earth but a moment,  
You have no time like a swift wind.

Lower worlds give birth to original life,  
Harmonising the spirits’ measure,  
Wings of this sacred scripture,  
Heavenly beings rejoice and admire,  
Supporting blessings in the three realms,  
Removing your sins and causes.  
Should one dare to destroy,  
The laws of hell grant no pardon,  
Swift as the law commands.

### Chapter Six: The Nine Dark Hells

The Dao says: In the Yellow Tseng world there are nine continents, all surrounded by minor seas, connected to the great Kunlun ocean. The place I now teach is called the Red County Minor Continent, the centre of the nine continents, following the laws of the great continent. The people of these nine minor continents are clever and crafty, few are sincere and true, few attain birth in heaven, most enter the nine dark hells, extending tens of thousands of li in all directions, utterly dark and filled with sinners. Some are poured into copper cauldrons, some boiled, some burned by fierce fire, some pierced by iron forks, some hammered by iron mallets, some whipped by fiery rods, some dismembered, their heads hung up, some forced to carry sand and stones, filling rivers and blocking seas. Great gods govern the punishments, sinners have no pardon. Some endure one kalpa, two kalpas, three, four, even a hundred kalpas. There is a great pit forty li square; sinners are commanded to work for a hundred years, casting in a mustard seed; when the pit is filled, that is one kalpa. There is also a great stone forty li square; sinners are commanded to work a hundred years, wiping with a heavenly cloth; when the stone is worn away, that is one kalpa. At that time sinners weep and speak to one another: ‘The mustard seed is so small; the pit is deep and wide; when will it be filled? The stone is hard and strong; the heavenly cloth is thin and slight; a hundred years for one wipe; when will it be worn away?’ Hearing this the jailers are angry and say: ‘There are twenty such kalpas; this is not even half a small kalpa.’ The sinners hear and sigh in sorrow, dying and being reborn, entering these punishments without release. They regret their past lives for unfilial and evil deeds, theft, murder, slandering the Dao and scriptures, taking life and wealth, cunning theft, disobedience to the gods, and thus receiving these punishments. I see this and think the men and women ought not to be sinners; thus I recite this verse:

Pits and stones are no fame,  
Twenty are not the great kalpa.  
Endless are sins among them,  
Spirit and soul are not destroyed.  

In a moment form arises,  
Briefly again dismembered.  
Boiling cauldrons cook,  
Knife winds cut as boards.  

Pity the beings below heaven,  
Why not build merit and virtue?  
Birth in heaven surely attained,  
Much more, the immortal way.

### Chapter Seven: The Assembly of the Holy Ones

The Most High Celestial Venerable having spoken this Scripture, all the holy lords, the Nine Elders of the Immortal Capital, the Nine Qi Lords, and others, all being present, unanimously exclaimed, ‘Excellent!’ and reported to the Celestial Venerable: ‘Having thus comprehended the Dao, we all revere it. We ask about the worlds of the many heavens: is there yet supreme transformation?’ The Celestial Venerable answered: ‘Since I began my study of the Dao in ninety-one kalpas, I have taught and transformed six hundred and twenty billion dust-worlds, sometimes dividing spirits and dispersing bodies, sharing their birth and death, sometimes transforming as adamantine and glazed light, sometimes as emperors, sages, elders, and children, sometimes as auspicious benevolent beasts, lions, white deer, qilin, phoenixes, and other expedients, none inaccessible. Yet all the sentient beings of the world are deeply sinful; the time has not yet come that they can receive transformation, and they finally return to hell. Those who do receive transformation attain the supreme Dao, do not arise in the three realms. Since you have beheld the Dao field, you should manifest the Dao teaching, aid and save all beings, make great vows, universally cause sovereigns and emperors, and all the laws of the heavens and earth, all ministers and subjects, down to the smallest creeping and crawling creatures, to be enlightened, not entering the three paths of suffering, nor the ten agonies and eight hardships, dying to obtain endless joy, living to possess the Dharma body and boundless lifespan. Seven precious palaces and mansions lack nothing. If you can thus aid and save, you will be teachers of the celestial beings. Can you not strive for this?’ The Celestial Venerable said: ‘This Scripture is to go forth into the world and may not be concealed. Transmit it by mutual accord, and brightness and blessing will flourish. If falsely transmitted and spread among the vulgar, it will bring sin and invite calamity.’ Then all the holy ones bowed their heads, all praised it as good, believed it, accepted it, and practiced it.
