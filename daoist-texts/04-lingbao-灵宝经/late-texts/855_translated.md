# Scripture of Birth into the Pure Land of the Supreme Cavernous Mysterious Spiritual Treasure (Dunhuang Manuscript)

The Scripture is entitled: Scripture of Birth into the Pure Land of the Supreme Cavernous Mysterious Spiritual Treasure. The author is unknown; it probably issued from the Southern and Northern Dynasties. It speaks of cultivating and accumulating merit to be born into the Pure Land. One scroll. It is not included in the Zhengtong Daozang. It is recorded in the Daozang Quejing Mulu. The base text is the Dunhuang manuscript P.2383. Collated with P.2401V and the fragmentary manuscript P.4703.

The Primordial Celestial Venerable, at that time, was in the Dragon Luo World, in the Xiangji Kingdom, within the Jiuhua Cloud Hall, sitting upon a great lotus, discoursing upon the Law with the holy multitudes from the ten directions and the innumerable denizens of the states, holding a great assembly of preaching for one hundred days without rising from his seat. Throughout heaven and earth, whether knowing or unknowing, the countless living beings all departed from suffering, obtained benefit, awakened to the body’s illusory and false nature, its impurity and foulness. Mindful in every moment of impermanence, they entered profound and subtle meditation, abandoning all bonds, able to comprehend the true Way, turning back the good heart, with single intention returning, sincere and unretreating.

The Primordial Celestial Venerable, of great compassion and observant kindness, taught with equality, instructing all to awaken and understand, to meet the true and constant realm, to confirm the fruit of non-action. The Celestial Venerable concentrated his spirit to return to the hall of constant happiness, emptiness, and tranquility. Suddenly, there appeared from the Abandoned Worthy World ten splendid immortals and others, five hundred and forty persons, all joining their palms, bowing their heads to the ground, and addressing the Celestial Venerable: 'We disciples have, from boundless kalpas, wandered through birth and death, guided by causes and conditions, have now met the Celestial Venerable. The joy of this day is indeed boundless and inconceivable. Yet though we have attained the rank of immortals, our defilements are not exhausted; we constantly fear the wheel of transmigration and cannot escape birth and death. This parting from the Celestial Venerable may last ten thousand kalpas; none know when we shall meet again. We desire to inquire, but fear to offend your august countenance; we particularly pray for your great compassion to bestow a little leniency.'

The Celestial Venerable said: 'Ye who have for countless kalpas set your hearts, though studying the Way of Immortals, have not entered the Great Vehicle, whereby ye have not ascended to the supreme state of immortals, and thus have not escaped birth and death. Now that ye part from me, it is difficult to meet again for ten thousand kalpas. Ye now have questions; this is the very time. Each should settle the heart and entertain no fear or anxiety.'

Then the immortals all bowed and knocked their heads, and said to the Celestial Venerable: 'We will follow your teaching and see the lands of the ten directions, where men and women are pure and clean, joyful and effortless; and again see the lands of the ten directions, where men and women are foul and filthy, beset with worry and a hundred vexations. We have not yet examined which practices produce that purity and noble form, and which practices produce the foulness and vexation. We humbly beseech the Celestial Venerable to deign to distinguish and clearly reveal the future.'

The Celestial Venerable said: 'There is no gate for sin or blessing; it is only what man summons. The retribution of good and evil is all from one’s own body. If one cultivates good deeds, one obtains birth in the Pure Land, with noble and upright form, and a long life. If one creates evil and sins, one abides in the defiled land, with ugly form and premature death. The causes and conditions of good and evil all arise from the body’s acts, and certainly not from another. Ye should listen attentively and understand my explanation.'

The Celestial Venerable said: 'When man is born, he should build great merit and cultivate various practices; according to past wishes, he obtains birth in the Pure Land,自在无为 (free and effortless). All merits overall have five kinds, embracing all gates of blessing.

First, the merit of preaching the Law. This means always using the three Caverns scriptures and laws of the Celestial Venerable to teach living beings by skillful means, adapting to their root natures, superior, middling, and inferior grades, intellects of foolish or wise, quick or slow, equally balanced persons, sometimes broadly, sometimes briefly, allegories and realities, all made to open their awakening, to enter the true and correct, to see the worlds of men and gods, to protect all, to revere the past, to attain birth in the heavens, or to become wise and intelligent, great masters of the Law.

Second, the merit of giving alms. This means giving body, life, and wealth without any stinginess. There are four kinds of causes.

One is inner giving, meaning the head, eyes, marrow, brain, hands, feet, hair and skin given for almsgiving to hungry hawks and famished tigers, poisonous snakes and fierce beasts, kin and others, according to their desire, begging head for head, eye for eye, body for body, hand for hand, with no attachment, rescuing living beings.

Two is outer giving, which again has four causes.

One is compassionate giving, meaning to the hungry, cold, aged, sick, prisoners, starving dogs, poor and needy, establishing great fields of compassion, giving clothes and food according to their needs, to rescue people.

Two is giving of the Law, meaning to repair and establish spirit temples, to make images and write scriptures, to spread flowers, bells, chimes, incense, oil, ritual implements, fasting, precepts, and monasteries, to supply the Three Treasures and all necessities.

Three is difficult giving, meaning the kingdom, city, wives and children, all beloved and precious beyond life itself, giving such is difficult; but he who knows all dharmas to be impermanent, and that wife, children, and kingdom depend on cause and condition and soon separate, awakening to the body’s illusory and void nature, originally without self, how much less to his wife and children, who are but dependents on causes and conditions, this giving is without regret, abandoning the hard-to-abandon, inconceivable.

Four is easy giving, meaning carriages, horses, servants, clothing, food and drink, gold, silver, silks, rice, wheat, and implements, all floating and dependents, easily relinquished. This is easy giving, universal to all, without distinction of saint or commoner.

By these four are again twenty kinds.

One is giving the body. Two, giving strength. Three, giving wife and children. Four, giving kingdom and city. Five, giving garden and house. Six, giving servants. Seven, giving carriages and horses. Eight, giving clothes. Nine, giving utensils. Ten, giving treasures. Eleven, giving rich silks. Twelve, giving rice and wheat. Thirteen, giving timber. Fourteen, giving incense and oil. Fifteen, giving food and drink. Sixteen, giving music. Seventeen, giving flowers and medicines. Eighteen, giving ritual vestments. Nineteen, giving ritual implements. Twenty, giving power and influence. All these twenty matters fall under the gate of giving. Giving means wide diffusion without limit; giving means bestowing upon all; hence it is called giving.

Third, the merit of establishing. This means to build and erect, making past, future, and present to rely upon all forms of thought. There are fifteen kinds, according to the degree of aspiration.

One is to build spirit temples, sacred and true immortal traces, mysterious altars and pavilions, halls and towers, master’s rooms and enclosures, terraces, pavilions, courts and gardens all complete, so that they may endure for ages without end.

Two is to make images. The three times and ten directions’ Celestial Venerables, supreme holy true immortals, Vajra warriors, jade boys and jade maidens, guardian deities and kings, carved in gold, engraved in jade, bronze, iron, wood, stone, embroidered, painted, clay, and tile, according to their capacity, adorned and decorated, their appearances full and perfect, so that all may take refuge.

Three is to make scriptures and laws. The three caverns and seven parts, records of holy true immortals, talismans, charts and methods, hymns and praises, on paper, silk, bamboo, and stone tablets, elaborately edited and printed, circulated, read and chanted, to teach men and gods.

Four is to make tents and seats, large and small, high and low, suitably decorated timely, so as to obtain the essence.

Five is to make embroidered flowers of gold, silver, pearls, jade, painted, carved, woven and tied, all according to ability, to supply the Three Honoured Ones.

Six is to make banners, flags, pennants, carriages and chariots, with nine lights and seven treasures, sandalwood and fragrant water, exquisite and subtle, prepared for majesty.

Seven is to make incense and minerals, flower plates and candle holders, gold, silver, copper, iron, jade, stone, tile and wood, all according to share and requirement, lacking nothing.

Eight is to make beds and seats, felt mats and cushions, produced according to the season, all made fresh and fine.

Nine is to make scripture repositories, boxes and chests, painted, carved and ornamented, decorated with gold and silver, to safely place the precious scriptures, preventing defilement and mixture.

Ten is to make kerchiefs, handkerchiefs, robes and outer garments, fine silks and cottons, of three and five colours, all fragrant and clean, spread before seats.

Eleven is to make desks, tables, scripture racks, knee supports, sandalwood and carved wood with delicate patterns, each fulfilling its purpose, to support scriptures and images, and also for those who have left the household life.

Twelve is to make bells and chimes, gold, silver, copper and iron, jade and stone, of various sizes and times, so that day and night they sound continuously, near and far all take refuge, constantly fulfilling the role of ritual instruments, a field of blessing for ages.

Thirteen is to make utensils, bowls, water basins, staffs and standards, pots and cauldrons, regularly offered in ceremonies, fulfilling needs without shortage, merits hard to conceive.

Fourteen is to make tables, wash basins, seats and cushions, ritual utensils and handkerchiefs, supplying the monastics, a field of boundless blessing.

Fifteen is to make ritual vestments, turbans, crowns, shoes and clothes, bedding and cords, all given to the monastic Law body in the ten directions. These fifteen in past and future merit are mighty.

Fourth, the merit of relief. This means kings and common people, and insects, fish, birds and beasts, all in many dangerous sufferings, must be supported and helped, made into fields of blessing, surely made safe and peaceful, not made to suffer anxiety, their blessing boundless and inconceivable.

Fifth, the merit of wisdom and beneficence. This means always by wisdom and beneficence to comfort and delight the living beings, so that men and gods all return to the good Way, forever free from the prison of suffering, and long abide in the hall of blessing.

Therefore these are called merits, constantly practiced without weariness is called merit, merit extending everywhere is called virtue. These five are always carried on, with the sixteen vows constantly made, greatly opening the good heart.

One is for heaven and earth, wishing eternal and unending duration.

Two is for sun and moon, wishing their light to shine universally.

Three is for the stars, wishing they always abide their proper orbits.

Four is for mountains and seas, wishing to guard springs and sources.

Five is for kings, wishing they long guard their lands.

Six is for ministers, wishing their offices and emoluments be ever secure.

Seven is for the nine mysteries, wishing to be born in the Pure Land.

Eight is for parents, wishing they long preserve heavenly longevity.

Nine is for brothers, wishing to practise benevolence and filiality.

Ten is for sisters, wishing to keep purity and chastity.

Eleven is for kinfolk, wishing all be harmonious.

Twelve is for the world, wishing all be peaceful.

Thirteen is for the three evil paths, wishing to depart from poison and suffering.

Fourteen is for all, wishing all be born.

Fifteen is for self, wishing to meet with the scriptures and the Way.

Sixteen is for the Dharma realm, wishing the three caverns be disseminated.

If one can constantly practise without weariness, making all take refuge, past and future, one can ascend to the Pure Land.

By practice is meant always purifying the three karmas, cleansing the six senses, practising the Way, reciting scriptures, observing fasts, bowing and worshipping, burning incense and making vows, repenting and lighting lamps, observing precepts, scattering flowers, releasing life, not killing, not stealing, not committing adultery, not being defiled, not hating, not flattering, not greedy, not desirous. Always for kings and rulers, queens and consorts, ministers and assistants, princes and nobles, dukes and counts, all the people of the world, the three evil paths and the five sufferings, hungry ghosts and beasts, constantly building a hundred halls, calling great virtuous Dharma masters and those wise and kindly to expound the thirty-six supreme scriptures, the unsurpassed wonderful meaning, to awaken all, day and night without weariness, burning incense and scattering flowers, lighting lamps to illumine the night, assisting the heavenly light, digging wells by the roadside, planting fruits and building houses, constructing bridges and roads, rescuing the laborious and suffering, never ceasing for a moment. By this practice, diligently and with effort, it is called daily practice.

The immortals bowed and asked: 'Living beings are weak and unable, we have not yet discerned what essential Dharma obtains birth in the Pure Land.'

The Celestial Venerable said: 'If good men and good women can but make my images, read and recite this scripture, bow day and night, and keep remembrance in their hearts, they will obtain birth. If they follow the previous practices, commit no evil, all the heavens will descend, and they will ascend by day to heaven.'

The immortals further said: 'Living beings are foolish and confused, attached to worldly affairs, and cannot obey the Celestial Venerable’s commands. We have not yet examined, at the time of death and after passing, what merits and vows lead to birth.'

The Celestial Venerable said: 'When men and women of the future at their death approach, first they must repent the countless heavy sins of their lives, next accept the precepts, set up offerings and practice the Way, make images and write scriptures, and perform merits, give alms to monasteries, support the monastics, each according to their ability, with more being better. On the day the eyes close, they are born into the Pure Land, not entering the three evil paths. If after death, their relatives must build yellow registers, bright truths, and the five disciplines of the Way, from the first day to the hundredth day. Make offerings, images, write scriptures, burn lamps, count days, bow day and night, recite scriptures and repent, burn incense and scatter flowers. Also use at birth clothes, bedding, carriages, horses, servants, gold, silver, pearls, silks and brocades, resources and wealth, divided into seventeen parts. Give one part to building spirit temples, mysterious altars and pavilions, halls and towers, rooms and corridors, houses and enclosures; one to making images of heavenly worthies and holy true immortals; one to writing scriptures and teachings; one to attending monasteries; one to supplying what is needed in offerings and fasts; one to giving to those observing precepts and mountain forests practising the Way; one to supporting monastics, clothing, food, drink and medicines; one to bells and chimes; one to scattering flowers; one to tents and seats; one to incense and oil; one to aiding prisoners; one to giving to the poor, aged and sick; one to releasing life; one to providing compassionate fields; one to building bridges and roads; and one to unimpeded giving. By this classified almsgiving one can obtain birth in the Divine Pure Land, blessed and protected. All calamities and diseases are made into fields of merit; this is the foremost inconceivable matter. Now I have fully explained to you the blessings and merits of the Pure Lands of the ten directions. These men and women, according to their vows, are born.'
