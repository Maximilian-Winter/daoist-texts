## Scroll One of the Most High Cavernous Mysterious Spiritual Treasure Heavenly Venerable Name

The Names of the Primordial Heavenly Venerable with One Thousand Five Hundred Titles and Various Repentance Texts

At that time, the Primordial Heavenly Venerable, on the fifteenth day of the seventh month, in the country of Xina-yu, upon Mount Yucha in the forest of Long Mulberry, delivered all the peoples. The Heavenly Venerable, with his disciples, the Perfect Lords, Most Holy Ones, and various heavenly emperors, heavenly dragons, ghosts, spirits, and miscellaneous beings, all returned together to the house of Chang Le. Beneath the stub of a tree, spontaneously there rose the seat of the Great Mysterious True Unity, formed of nine lights, jade barriers, and seven treasures. The seat was lofty and broad, adorned with gold, silver, pearls, jasper, coral, tiger’s soul, chariot stones, and agate, carved with neatness and splendour. Amidst it were mixed treasure banners, suspended flags and canopies, within and without radiating light that illumined the ten directions of the infinite world. Incense, flowers, and music surrounded it; lions and maned beasts, dragons’ scales and fierce hunters, celestial tigers, guarded its sides; phoenixes, peacocks, golden-winged vermilion birds, all emitted elegant sounds, flying and calling upon it. Though the seat had form, it was not obstructed by any object; people passed and repassed without hindrance. Furthermore, many small glassy seats spontaneously rose from lotus flower pedestals, surrounding on four sides. When the Heavenly Venerable rose, he ascended the treasure seat, placed himself upright and sat, his spirit tranquil and serene, dignified in stillness and non-action, entering the wondrous gates of the assembly, departing from spoken teaching.

All the assembly respectfully bowed once, took their places and sat. Having seen this event, they all pondered within themselves, and sighed: never before had such been seen. The foremost disciple, the Perfect Lord of the Left, named Fa Jie, arose from his seat with ten thousand similar disciples from the ten directions, advancing forward to make their obeisance, prostrating with body, mind, and spirit, and with single-hearted right thought, addressed the Heavenly Venerable, saying: ‘This seven-treasure seat is wondrously beautiful and rare; its form is vivid and unobstructed by things.’ The Heavenly Venerable on his seat immediately understood that Fa Jie had come to inquire of the meaning and intent; from before his face he emitted five-coloured light, illuminating the ten directions of the boundless kingdoms, all manner of strange and diverse worlds, heavens and hells, all fully seen within; furthermore, the heavenly venerables of the ten directions, all the great immortals, all were seen within; birth and death, suffering and joy, the measure of blessings, all were fully seen; the stages of cultivation of the Way were also seen; pure and defiled lands were also seen. The multitudes from the ten directions were like fine dust, innumerable; all saw the utmost bliss of the heavens, the acid pangs of hell, the boundless sufferings. Further they saw the great blessed hall country, the house of Chang Le, utmost bliss incomparable, surpassing the Southern Palace. Fa Jie, the Perfect Lord, the Great Ultimate Perfect Lord, the Great Wisdom Perfect Lord, the Rescue and Liberation Perfect Lord, the four great Perfect Lords, addressed the Heavenly Venerable: ‘Now in this light we see various lands whose sufferings and joys differ, heavens and hells with different retributions. We only wish the Heavenly Venerable, with great compassion and pity, would save and protect sentient beings, to work for their benefit, that they may obtain liberation, forever depart from sorrow, and swiftly be born in the pure land.’

The Heavenly Venerable said to the Rescue and Liberation Perfect Lord: ‘Well said, well said! Listen attentively. I now for you distinguish and explain the names of the heavenly venerables of the ten directions; with wholehearted reverence, worship, and repentance, one extinguishes limitless sins, generates boundless blessings, and immediately attains rebirth in the utmost blissful world of the heavens. One must perform limitless merit and virtue, give alms to the poor, accomplish the practice of contemplation, have a single heart without two, and forever sever attachment and desire; then one obtains release from boundless vexations.’

The Rescue and Liberation Perfect Lord said: ‘This Wanli (Ten Thousand) Heavenly Abandoned Worthy World is a place of mixed evil; hells, hungry ghosts, and beasts are full, with many unwholesome assemblies. May it be in my future that I do not hear evil voices, nor see evil men.’ Observing these words, this place is truly an impure land; men have no joy. In such a world there are four seasons and eight festivals, which consume human life; spring, autumn, winter, and summer, wind, rain, cold, and heat; day brightness and night darkness; sun and moon alternately hasten; the earth is gravelly, high and low slopes and perils; mountains and rivers impede; grass and wood are prickly and thorny; none is to be enjoyed. The human body received is subject to birth, aging, disease, and death; impure and transient, unstable, the retribution of dangers and difficulties; the body requires clothing and food, hard to be sufficient; hunger and thirst often arise; royal laws drive and urge, no freedom is possible. Even if gathered together, only the ignorant children and unknowing are companions; they use oxen, horses, pigs, sheep, and miscellaneous beasts as company; all are causes of grievance and consequence. Eyes see evil colours, ears hear evil sounds, nose smells evil perfumes, tongue tastes evil flavours, body feels evil touches, mind is moved by evil dharmas; such affairs, how can they be pleasant? Furthermore, lifespan is impermanent, especially to be feared; breathing out and breathing in, mindful of the past death. Even if living a hundred years, counting the days, only three and sixty thousand days are lived, how much more so when life is often shortened; death is without doubt. Not striving against death, one must seek a peaceful and joyful world, desiring rebirth in the Chang Le pure land, but there to be forever enjoy boundless joy; clothed in heavenly silk, fed from the celestial kitchen; there are no four seasons of cold and heat, no day and night darkness; also no birth, aging, sickness, and death; no name of the three paths and eight sufferings; the land—‘Northern Catalogue No. 18 manuscript breaks off here, text missing below.’

(p. 3775, beginning missing)

May we together with all sentient beings be born in the hall of blessings land. See the heavenly venerables of the ten directions, always wishing to fully offer them worship.

The Rescue and Liberation Perfect Lord addressed the Primordial: prostrating to the holy true dharma king, ‘Within the hearts of sentient beings is a priceless treasure, often robbed by the six thieves. Anger’s arrow shoots and pierces the heart; ignorance and love bind with iron chains. Human desire is a fetter and restraint of the body; the six relatives and kin mutually torment one another. When will the five turbidities and defiled lands be passed? The great waters of ignorance cannot be crossed by any means. Rescue and Liberation Great Compassionate addresses the Heavenly Venerable: we only wish thy compassion and many skillful means. For all sentient beings, produce in the future a priceless dharma boat to help and ferry across, bearing sentient beings to the other shore. No wine or meat or spicy smells are eaten; cleanliness and sweeping into one room; statues and banners placed on four sides; strictly holding incense, flowers, and canopies; reciting the Way and worship; seven days and seven nights dreaming of visions, then a perfect lord comes to instruct; the Heavenly Venerable manifests in various forms, named the heavenly venerables of the ten directions in the billions, transforming and saving sentient beings beyond measure. We only wish the Heavenly Venerable at the time to speak; we forever worship and never retreat.’

At that time there were the Perfect Lord of the Left and the Rescue and Liberation Perfect Lord, who prostrated and praised the true pure heavenly venerable country of Xina-yu, and the scene thereof; they wished together with the beings of the dharma realm to go to that pure land of Xina-yu. They wished to see the bright treasure forest, with seven treasure dharma places; the tree was four million li high, its base circumference thirty-five million four hundred thousand li, its branches and leaves spread twenty thousand li. Those who see this tree have their cloud of sins removed, and are born into the highest dharma of the law of birth; born in the country of Xina-yu. They wished to see the pure country of Chang Le, the true pure heavenly venerable, majestic and dignified, surpassing all other worlds, radiating light, with perfect features and adornments. They wished to see the seven treasure bathing pools of the Chang Le country, the water of supreme goodness, clear and full, with treasure sands below, fragrant trees on the banks; if entering the treasure pool, the spirit delights the body, washes away the heart’s dross, and obtains the true Way. They wished to see the jade country of Chang Le, the true pure heavenly venerable, dressed in seven treasures and bright pearls, wearing the nine-light treasure cloud robe, sitting upon a thousand-leaf lotus treasure pedestal, the base of gold with lions and nine-coloured sea dragons, celestial youths and jade maidens offering incense and scattering flowers. They wished to see the great compassionate Perfect Lord of the Chang Le jade country, possessing thirty-two marks and eighty-one excellences, his body golden in colour, a treasure crown on his head, a round halo about his neck, with rings of light hanging down all around. The Perfect Lord of Smooth Transformation, with perfect features and adornments, skilful in guiding sentient beings, purifying and removing karmic obstacles. They wished to see the great compassionate Perfect Lord of the moon-clear Chang Le country, his whole body luminous, shining purple gold throughout the ten directions; all sentient beings with conditions could all see him. They wished to receive his power, to remove the sins of birth and death, attain enlightenment, and return to the Right Way. They wished to see the assembly of Perfect Lords of that land, possessing wisdom and light, with divine powers penetrating all things, bodies of emptiness, forms without limit. They wished all to personally visit, cultivate all excellent merits and virtues, and be born in the Chang Le country. If any one recites and day and night worships this true pure heavenly venerable of the Chang Le land, it washes away the boundless sins and stains of sentient beings, inconceivable indeed.

At that time the Primordial Heavenly Venerable began to recite the names of the heavenly venerables of the ten directions, one hundred and eighty Dao Lords, and twelve hundred Laozis. Were one to expound widely the names of the heavenly venerables, their number would be as the dust of the world; to speak of them through countless kalpas could not exhaust them; the heavenly venerables of the same name also could not be exhausted. (Here follows an abridgment of the one thousand five hundred heavenly venerables’ names of the ten directions.) Worship and praise thus performed, their merit is difficult to excel. Thus is the worship made. After fifty such worships, two great Perfect Lords pronounced the worship, inconceivable, each thrice repeated.

Having worshipped the Three Treasures, next follows repentance.

With utmost sincerity I bow to the Ever-Present Three Treasures of the ten directions, repenting the sin of greed and love. The scripture says: ‘Because of greed and desire, one is imprisoned in the dungeon of ignorance, drowning in the river of birth and death, none able to escape.’ Sentient beings due to these five desires and conditions have wandered in birth and death since ancient times. For each sentient being, the bones accumulated in one kalpa are like great mountains; the milk taken in as food is like the waters of the four seas; the blood emitted by the body surpasses this. Parents, brothers, kin, and relatives at death weep, their tears streaming like the waters of the four great seas. Therefore it is said: ‘Where there is love, there is birth; when love is exhausted, then is extinction.’ Thus is known that birth and death arise from greed and love. Hence the scripture says: ‘The sin of lust causes sentient beings to fall into hell, hungry ghosts, and sufferings; if born among beasts, one takes forms of pigeons, crows, ravens, owls, and so forth; if born among men, wives are unchaste and improper, and follow not their kindred.’ Lust having such evil karma, therefore the pure men and women, to this day and until now, bow to the Three Treasures.

With utmost sincerity I bow to the Ever-Present Three Treasures of the ten directions: we repent that from limitless kalpas until today, among the dharma of the Way, all the obscurities spoken of in the scriptures, the human body is hard to obtain, the Way venerable hard to hear, the great teachers hard to meet, faith hard to arise, the six roots difficult to be complete, good friends rare to find. Now together we meet, with past good roots, having obtained this human body and complete six roots, and meet good friends, hearing the great Way and orthodox dharma; yet each is unable to give full attention and diligent practice, fearing in the future to be long immersed in ten thousand sufferings with no time of release. Therefore today we must with utmost sincerity feel shame and remorse, bow and take refuge, and now all repent.

With utmost sincerity I bow to the Ever-Present Three Treasures of the ten directions: since no-beginning until today, we have often through ignorance covered the heart, with vexations and afflictions; seeing venerable forms and images, unable to give full hearted reverence, slighting great teachers, harming good friends, breaking altars and destroying monasteries, burning images; sometimes in our own mansions placing venerable images in low and vile places, so that they are smoked and exposed to sun, wind, rain, and dust, defiled and spoiled by birds and rodents, with no reverence; sometimes exposing images naked, not properly adorning them; sometimes covering lamps and candles, closing and opening halls, obscuring images and light. Such sins, today with utmost sincerity, all are repented.

Having worshipped the Three Treasures, next follows repentance.

As for the discourse of repentance, its root is to change the past and cultivate the future, to extinguish evil and promote good. Man living in the world, who can be without fault? Even the learned, when losing mindfulness, still raise vexations; immortals, with habits formed, sometimes speak harmful words. How much more then the common man, who can be without fault? But the wise learn first and are able to repent; covertness and concealment become dissolved, and thus habits accumulated through long nights are cleared, and awakening dawns without limit. If one can feel shame and remorse, and disclose and repent, is it not only truly to extinguish sin, but also to increase boundless merit and virtue, and to establish the Heavenly Venerable’s supreme wondrous fruit? If one desires to practice this dharma, one should first outside keep body and conduct pure, reverently look upon venerable images, internally arise reverence, affected by their form and law, and strive to the utmost, producing two kinds of mind. What are these two? One is self-reflection: ‘My body and life are difficult to preserve; one day they will be scattered and destroyed, and I do not know when this body may be restored. If I do not meet the Heavenly Venerable and the Worthy and Holy, and suddenly meet evil friends and create many sinful acts, then I shall fall into the three evil paths.’ The second is self-reflection: ‘Though in this life I may meet the Heavenly Venerable’s orthodox dharma and attain and understand the true dharma, continuing the holy lineage, purifying body, speech, and mind, and dwelling in good dharmas, yet now I myself commit evil and cover it, saying others do not know, thinking they do not see, hiding it in my heart without shame. This is indeed the greatest of all offences in the world.’ Now there are the heavenly venerables of the ten directions, the great perfect lords, the heavenly gods and immortals, who all with pure great eyes watch the sins and evil acts we commit. Further, the hidden and manifest spirits note and record sins and blessings, with no difference in the minutest detail. Yet those who commit sins, when life ends, the ox-head jailers record their spirits, in the Luo Deng Palace before the Northern Emperor, judging right and wrong, examining faults and mistakes. When in the netherworld, all those injured come as witnesses, each saying: ‘You first slaughtered my body, roasted, steamed, and boiled me,’ or ‘You first stripped me of all my treasures and separated me from my kin; now I have obtained you, and here now is the evidence at hand. How dare you deny it? You must only willingly endure the past calamity.’ As the scripture makes clear, in hell there is no wrongful judgment of men. If in life one has committed sins and foolishly lost the path, this is so.

Having worshipped the Three Treasures, next follows repentance.

With utmost sincerity I bow to the Ever-Present Three Treasures of the ten directions: we again repent that in the animal realm there is no knowledge or recognition of sin and retribution; we repent that in the animal realm there is no freedom, for that which was evil in life, all appearances now present before us, each saying: ‘You formerly were at my side, committing these sins; now how can you deny them? This is sin committed, without place to hide.’ Thus the Northern Emperor of the Netherworld gnashes his teeth and scolds, about to hand over to hell, passing endless kalpas with no way out. This matter is not distant; [text missing] people, truly is my own body self-made and self-experienced; though father and son and closest kin [text missing], the recipients, all together, and with their bodies and forms broken [text missing], many sufferings, each striving and fearing for life; again at the right time, repentance is too late. Therefore pure men and women, with utmost sincerity, bow and take refuge in the heavenly venerables of the ten directions, and now all repent.

The Heavenly Venerable said: ‘Ordained monks and pure men and women, and all the worthy ones, [text missing], learn the great vehicle, always speak the profound meaning, but the heart dwells in existence and does not believe in retribution; arrogant and haughty, holding power and making gestures, speaking for their own profit, acting unlawfully, not following precepts, with unclean hands grasping scripture scrolls, not placing pure cloths, further not carefully placing them, on the ground and at places of rest…’ [text missing]
