The Scripture of the Supreme Mysterious and Spirit Treasure on the Causes and Conditions of Leaving Home

The Dao thus speaks: In former times, on the fifteenth day of the seventh month in the first year of the Kaihuang era, at noon, in the country of Chiming, on the Zhu Yang Upper View, at the Three Bright Precious Altars, one approached the Supreme Heavenly Venerable, and received the unsurpassed Three Caverns Great Vehicle Mysterious Scripture, numbering thirteen thousand and five hundred chapters, and seven thousand talismanic diagrams. The Heavenly Venerable was about to return to the realm of Non-action in the Great Void. At that time, two hundred kings met, together with their consorts, ministers, and all the people, men and women alike, all stirred to the intention of the Way, and bowed their heads to the Heavenly Venerable, forsaking their kingdoms, cities, wives, and children, desiring to leave home, and making a solemn vow to uphold the Three Caverns classics, to offer lifelong support, and to make merit for the three lives to come. The Heavenly Venerable smiled gently, and emitted nine-coloured precious light, illuminating this assembly, and all the kings and their peoples, men and women, so that within and without all was clear as if a crystal pearl; the internal organs, bowels, hair, and skin—nothing was unseen.

Within this light, these kings saw themselves clearly, their forms manifest and luminous, fully knowing their predestined fates, past and future three lives of good and evil, all shining before their eyes. These kings and all men and women present were struck with awe and fear, and they again developed the supreme and most excellent resolve, prostrating themselves and worshipping, addressing the Heavenly Venerable thus: ‘Your disciples, by virtue of past causes and conditions, have met with the compassionate Venerable’s unsurpassed assembly, and again encounter the Supreme One, receiving the Three Caverns Great Law. Further encountering these scriptures, they reveal past affinities; this is not the fortune of ordinary men in a thousand years, but specially through the Heavenly Venerable’s great merciful grace, wishing to open deliverance, the kindness extended to all, gathered all at once today. Though like insects and ants, tiny beings, little perceive such deep benevolence, yet their earnestness is sincere, truly desiring to abandon the impure world and wives and children, wishing to leave home, uphold the scriptures and precepts, to create fields of merit beyond the world. Graciously, the Heavenly Venerable has especially granted permission.’

The Heavenly Venerable said: ‘Before you had stirred your hearts, I already knew. The reason I emit this light is to show you your predestined fate, so that you may recognize good and evil causes and conditions. Those who leave home have heavy causes and conditions. You are able to set your minds upon this, which is inconceivable. But I fear that you remain attached to worldly affairs, having long been dissipated, unable to endure hardship and sweetness, receiving this labour with a beginning but no end, diligence at first then negligence, not concentrating upon the Way, finally falling to the evil gate, belittling teachers and scorning the Law, bringing ruin upon yourselves.’

Then these kings again suddenly bowed their heads, knocking their foreheads, tears and voices mingling. They made a vow: ‘If after leaving home, we have a beginning but no end, diligence at first then negligence, violate this original vow, turn back midway, we will fall together with our nine ancestors and grandparents into hell, suffering for myriad kalpas without redemption; in future retribution we shall be born in non-human forms, and dare not speak further.’

The Heavenly Venerable said: ‘You all listen attentively, I now for you expound the causes and conditions of leaving home. Those who leave home may have ancestors who established spirit views and mysterious altars, and various dwellings, holy perfect immortal traces, extensively building halls and pavilions, making images, true responsive incarnations, adorned and offered unto, copying scriptures to lecture and expound, reciting and circulating, enlightening men and gods. Or ancestors who abandoned kingdoms, cities, wives and children, heads, marrow and brains, gold, silver, pearls, jade, silks and brocades, carriages, horses, servants, bedding and garments, playthings and utensils, entering the Three Treasures, using these as fields of merit. Or ancestors who held fast to fasting and precepts, bowing, burning incense, practising the Way, chanting praises, repenting sins and removing faults, constantly carrying out good vows without pause. Or ancestors who released life, succoured the poor, prisoners, aged and sick, and all birds and beasts, blind, deaf, sick with six diseases, all living beings. Or ancestors who cured illness and healed disease, revived those in peril or dead. Or ancestors who widely read scriptures and treatises, lectured and taught, encouraged children to know the good Way. Or ancestors who planted orchards and forests, built wells by the road, made boats and bridges, to ferry all across. Or ancestors who greatly established charitable fields, giving clothes and food, to the hungry, cold, sick and suffering, insects, fish, birds, and all poor, each made to be satisfied. Or ancestors who built charitable halls, pitying cold and heat, giving drinks and firewood, helping travellers to find peace and rest. Or ancestors who everywhere set their hearts, with equal appearance, widely converting men and women, encouraging and helping the Way-place, establishing views to save people, copying scriptures, casting images, granting scriptures and transmitting precepts, bowing and incense-burning, lighting lamps and reciting, giving alms and repentance, enlightening the multitude of the lost. Or ancestors who were loyal, faithful, benevolent, filial, assisting the country and promoting civilization, upright, pure and honest, gentle and kind, harming not things, giving peace and joy to living beings. Or ancestors who were rulers, widely practising charity, humble in palace and simple in food, pitying the people, equal to all things, the country peaceful, though all evils not yet ended, all good not yet fulfilled, their merit and fame yet established, they were not promoted but followed their destiny to be born among men, again encountering scriptures and Law, and so leaving home. Or the seven ancestors accumulating merit, blessing progeny and descendants. Or seeing the world, establishing merit, their name known in the heavens, not arising suddenly but earned. Your ancestors all trusted in the Three Treasures, copied scriptures and made images, established mysterious altars, saved people and helped things, upheld fasting, bowing, reciting, burning incense and offering, practising the Way, giving alms, repentance and vows unceasing, greatly making merit, causing kings to repay, being foremost among men, inconceivable. Moreover, they could abandon kingdoms, cities, wives and children, forsake worldly joy, seek and beg for leaving home, uphold the scriptures with sincerity, stir the unsurpassed heart, make merit for long life in past and future, exceedingly rare and inconceivable. These kings all at once prostrated themselves, throwing their bodies upon the ground, disturbed by joy and sorrow.’

Then the Heavenly Venerable commanded the nine Earthly True Officers to spread out the true seats, the Four Heavenly Emperors to array the record of degrees of immortals, the Three Heavenly True Kings to issue certificates of true faith, the Five Emperors to hold banners, the Three Realms to bear talismans, the Four Departments to carry slips, the Three Officials’ registers and ledgers; the heavenly emperors, immortal youths and jade maidens, divine immortal troops numbering hundreds of millions, all came at once, scattering flowers and burning incense, waving banners and shaking flags, striking bells and gongs, heavenly music of myriad kinds, ranged on left and right, all in one voice praising good, all reaching the Way-place, overseeing the Dharma assembly, opening deliverance and good conditions. The Heavenly Venerable commanded me and the Jade Pure High Sage to impart to these kings and others the rites of sincerity for entering the Way and the dignified deportment. The Four Heavenly Kings added the Dharma robes, facing north, worshipped the Heavenly Venerable with three bows. Returning the greeting to me and the heavenly immortals, sages and saints, they faced east and prostrated, receiving the true sincerity of the first stage.

The sincerity is thus: After leaving home, first, one must not lightly scorn the scriptures and Way, nor the original master. Second, one must not dishonour the Dharma garments, nor damage the dignity of the Way. Third, one must not retreat halfway, or pursue worldly honours and glory. Fourth, one must not abandon one’s Dharma robes and follow heterodox studies. Fifth, one must not associate or dwell with those not leave-home or with heterodox studies, thus defiling the Dharma robes. Sixth, one must not eat meat or drink wine, nor harbour thoughts of killing. Seventh, one must not associate with men and women, nor give rise to lustful thoughts. Eighth, one must not violate the sincerity of the scriptures, nor produce faults and evil. Ninth, one must not be arrogant, rude or cruel, nor oppress fellow Way-folk or the uninitiated. Tenth, one must not be disrespectful to parents or sovereigns, nor be disloyal or unfilial.

First, one must always develop great heart, establish views to save people, copy scriptures and make images, to promote the sacred teaching. Second, one must always develop great heart, preach the Three Caverns scriptures and teachings, exhort and transform living beings, causing wide understanding and enlightenment. Third, one must always develop great heart, uphold fasting, bowing, incense-burning, to make merit for past, future, and present lives. Fourth, one must always develop great heart, make great merit for sovereigns, ministers, and the people of the world. Fifth, one must always develop great heart, make merit for the nine mysteries and seven ancestors, one’s parents, family, and all living beings, through kalpas. Sixth, one must always develop great heart, for all beings on earth and in the heavens, sentient or insentient, conditioned or unconditioned, human or non-human, all with consciousness, to read scriptures, bow, chant the Way and the masters, all to be freed from suffering and ascend to the Way’s shore. Seventh, one must always develop great heart, wishing all beings to awaken to the right Way, forever freed from birth and death. Eighth, one must always develop great heart, wishing past kalpas, future kalpas, this and next lives, the Great Way to flourish, never to be lost, opening deliverance for all beings.

These kings each bowed thrice, then turned their hearts and bowed toward the ten directions, each once. Then addressing the Heavenly Venerable, they spontaneously made vows: First vow: after leaving home, swear not to scorn scriptures, Way, or original master. Second vow: after leaving home, swear not to dishonour Dharma robes or damage Way dignity. Third vow: after leaving home, swear not to retreat halfway, nor pursue worldly glory. Fourth vow: after leaving home, swear not to abandon Dharma robes and follow heterodox learning. Fifth vow: after leaving home, swear not to associate or dwell with non-leave-home or heterodoxs, nor defile Dharma robes. Sixth vow: after leaving home, swear not to eat meat or drink wine, nor entertain killing thoughts. Seventh vow: after leaving home, swear not to associate with men and women, nor generate lustful desires. Eighth vow: after leaving home, swear not to violate scripture sincerity, nor produce faults and evils. Ninth vow: after leaving home, swear not to be arrogant, rude, cruel, nor oppress fellow students or uninitiated. Tenth vow: after leaving home, swear not to be disrespectful to parents or sovereigns, not disloyal or unfilial.

First wish: establish views to save people, copy scriptures and make images, promote the Three Treasures. Second wish: preach the Three Caverns scriptures and teachings, cause wide enlightenment. Third wish: uphold fasting, bow, incense, unceasing morning and evening. Fourth wish: make merit for sovereigns, ministers, and people of the world. Fifth wish: make merit through kalpas for the nine mysteries, seven ancestors, parents, and family. Sixth wish: universally for all beings on earth, read scriptures, bow, and reach the Way’s shore. Seventh wish: all beings awaken to the right Way. Eighth wish: past and future kalpas, ever abiding in the Way’s gate, heart never wavering. Ninth wish: all men and women in the ten directions, having Way-heartedness, jointly attain leaving home. Tenth wish: through kalpas sowing causes, soon attain immortal Way, forever free from birth and death.

Having uttered these vows, the assembly all praised good, and each returned to his place.

Then the heavenly immortals and sages, jade youths and maidens, raised banners and held standards, scattered flowers and burned incense, chanted praises to the Heavenly Venerable’s immeasurable merits, played heavenly music, led the kings and new leave-homers in three circuits of the Way, ten voices praising good. When the vows concluded, they went directly to the blessed hall, partook of heavenly food and drink, observed fasting and purity. The heavenly men and women, and the people, brought down myriad kinds of flowers and fruits, rare and precious Dharma flavors, successively circulated, offered and completed. Then from the treasury were brought seven treasures, pearls and jade, silks and cotton, garments, bedding, playthings and utensils, incense burners, brushes, scepters, food vessels, seats and cushions, beds and stools, banners and flags, bathing pots, scarves, sheaths and daggers, servants, carriages and horses, gardens and groves, bamboo, trees, orchards, flowers, medicines, ponds and marshes, all manner of Dharma items, given in alms and offerings.

The new leave-homers and all present together voiced: ‘We are fortunate indeed to meet this day. The Heavenly Venerable’s compassion greatly expands deliverance, having these kings and others abandon kingdoms and leave home, thus making great benefit for us, opening blind foolish hearts, allowing us to see the true Way. We only pray that these kings uphold the Dharma form, abide in the great Dharma gate, follow the Heavenly Venerable’s teachings, open deliverance for us, so that we may extinguish sin, be born with countless good merits, and in the world to come attain the leave-home Dharma body.’ Having spoken this wish, thrice they praised good, looked upon the Heavenly Venerable, bowed their heads and sat.

The Heavenly Venerable said: ‘You men and women, for boundless kalpas have upheld fasting and precepts, offered support and worship, now encountering this day is inconceivable. Furthermore, you should bestow alms upon the new leave-homers and all assemblies; merit is boundless, heaven and men rejoice, surely upon closing your eyes you will be born into gates of wealth and honour. The wise and virtuous shall also leave home, surely without fault.’ These men and women all voiced praise, and at once bowed and worshipped, seating according to rank.

The Heavenly Venerable said: ‘Those leaving home have three meanings: first, leaving home; second, entering the Way; third, abandoning the mundane. What is leaving home? Home has two meanings. First, the home of affection, that is, benevolence of parents, brothers, sisters, husbands and wives, kin and kindred, mutually entangled and bound, tied and clinging in the heart, producing evil deeds and all manner of attachments, causing affliction and unrest, unable to be free, to cultivate the true Way. Now by leaving this home, one severs affection forever, always obtains freedom, and mindfully contemplates the Non-action of the Way. Second, the home of all existence, this body, five aggregates, four elements, combined and formed, dwelling in the world, mistakenly generating attachment, six roots and three karmas, broadly constructing dusts, worldly circumstances clinging, producing manifold evil deeds; colour, sound, scent, taste, afflict and purify the mind, filth and defilement arise, cyclic birth and death, unable to be freed, sinking eternally, born life after life, receiving non-human births. Let it be known that the body is no body, now foul and stinking, pus and blood gathered, temporarily lodged for a short time, one day one transformation, the hundred bones without master, like bubbles and illusions, gathered and dispersed in a moment, all dharmas uneven, all false and unreal, not truly mine, distinct from myself, mistakenly striking existence and non-existence, producing attachment, defiling and burdening the consciousness and spirit, thus falling into dark hell. Now by leaving this home, sever affliction forever, contemplate body as empty and false, all conditions clear and bright, movements of thought and heart all return to the Supreme Way, body and spirit enter the subtle, refine substance returning to non-being, neither dying nor living, eternally attesting constant joy. Therefore it is called leaving home.

What is entering the Way? The Way has two kinds. First, the Way realm, meaning the mysterious altar, spirit view, mountain forest stillness and order, under trees and in gardens, pure and unmixed, not mingling with the mundane world, body ascending this place, facing the true countenance, mouth chanting spirit texts, free from clamor and disturbance, burning incense and bowing, practising the Way and reciting scriptures, lecturing the Great Vehicle, focused and single-minded, abandoning that worldly realm, entering this Way place, tempering heart and form, surely attaining constant joy, mastering true saintliness, attesting the jade purity fruit, no coming nor going, pure and ever abiding. Second, the Way body, meaning upright body and quiet meditation, contemplating inner body, examining one’s form, viewing all things from afar, all are yet to be completed, all are empty and non-existent, briefly and temporarily born, suddenly transformed and extinguished, arising and ceasing, myriad dharmas without rest, one life is not long, carefully observing the world, moment after moment impermanent, liking to master the body, who is truly so? Know that it is false conjunction, already prepared by causes and conditions, gathering and dispersing in an instant, how can it ever dwell constantly? One must hold the three and guard the one, refine substance to attain truth, long be with the Way, escape birth and death, constant joy, pure self, attest the fruit of the Way place, transform this mortal body, this is called entering the Way.

What is abandoning the mundane? The mundane has two kinds. First, the mundane realm, meaning heaven and earth, sun and moon, mountains, rivers, rocks and walls, grasses, trees, insects and fish, all living beings, all are things, briefly born and briefly destroyed, quickly broken and decayed, dispersed in a short while, not to be attached to, polluting and defiling my body. Know that the three realms are all empty and false, able to be abandoned, forever ceasing craving. Second, the mundane body, meaning this body of mine, eyes, ears, nose, mouth, flesh, skin, hands, feet, hair, the hundred bones and nine orifices, all combined, called man. Ultimately seeking, no place for man, birth, old age, illness and death, moment by moment impermanent, unclean and foul, temporarily dependent, why cling to distinctions of this and that, self and other, killing, stealing, licentiousness, jealousy, stinginess, anger and hatred, flowery words and lies, double tongued, foul mouthed, quarrelsome, arrogant and rude, rich and poor, mutually injuring and taking, love and hate, choosing and rejecting, all manner of clinging, wandering after colour and sound, craving scent and taste, always accumulating gold, jewels, silk, brocade, rice, wheat and grain, hoarding without satisfaction to fill ten thousand generations, who knows that one day the form turns to dust? Now abandoning this body, ceasing all attachment, eyes sever all colours, ears sever all sounds, nose severs all scents, mouth severs all tastes, mind severs all dharmas, body severs all desires, even to six roots and six consciousnesses, six desires and six thieves, six entrances and six defilements, six dusts mutually arising, thirty-six causes, all roots of evil, all abandon and forsake, purified one mind, forever severing affliction, therefore called abandoning the mundane.

Summing these three, they are called Waymen.

Why called Waymen? It means that in action, rest, sitting and lying, and the stirring of mind and will, one only pursues the Way, observes fasting, bows, offers sincerity, recites scriptures, burns incense, scatters flowers, lights lamps, repents, gives alms, makes vows, lectures the Great Vehicle, teaches living beings, develops great Way heart, makes merits, universally for all, after self putting others first, not mixing with worldly toil, only acting in Way deeds. The word ‘man’ means ‘business’. Business varies in quantity and learning leads to differences; there are seven ranks, all called Waymen.

First, the Heavenly True, meaning body conjoined with nature, inside and out pure and simple.  
Second, the Spirit Immortal, meaning transformations unfathomable, transcending the mundane world.  
Third, the Hidden Recluse, meaning containing light and concealing radiance, not bound by worldly troubles.  
Fourth, the Mountain Dweller, meaning secluded, silent, and retiring, the benevolent find peace.  
Fifth, the Leave-homer, meaning abandoning all affections, shedding the noisy dust.  
Sixth, the Inhabitant, meaning blending light with dust, embracing the Way and cherishing virtue.  
Seventh, the Sacrificial Wine, meaning humbling oneself below the mundane, rescuing the distressed and suffering. Thus they gain the respect of all men and gods on earth, the six paths and four births, who bow and offer homage, most supreme and excellent, not attending the Son of Heaven, nor saluting dukes and marquises, but making merit for men and gods, receiving offerings of the Three Realms.

Why so? Because they inherit my Law and teaching, wear my Dharma robes, uphold the scriptures and precepts, guide living beings, so that past, present and future three lives forever escape suffering and enter the gate of constant joy. These beings in heaven and man are the Dharma body’s parents. Though emperors and kings possess ten thousand kingdoms, exalted and honoured among men, they cannot escape birth and death, cannot escape disease, cannot escape affliction, cannot escape destruction, cannot escape cold and heat, cannot escape going and returning; but the Waymen can escape these ills. Yet if one leaves home without following my Law, not holding Dharma robes; or turns back from the Way to the mundane, forsakes truth and follows falsehood; or follows heterodox teachings and evil ways, revering foreign doctrines; or pursues worldly honours and wealth; or is oppressed by royal laws, crooked officials, taking off robes and damaging the Dharma body; or abandons Dharma robes and sinks into the mundane world; or is not trusted or respected, reviled and insulted, beaten and expelled from the leaving-home Dharma body; or develops levity and disrespect, mind not reverent or solemn; or mocks and laughs, quarrels and is arrogant; such persons, when seen in the world, will suffer leprosy and scabies, eyebrows falling out, whole body swollen and rotten, people dislike to see them. Or suffer lawsuits, prisons, chains and shackles, pain cutting the body. Or blind, deaf, mute, hands cramped, feet lame, ugly in form, poor and lowly. Or suffer wind madness, epilepsy, evil spirits and demons, enemies and foes, mutually repaying misfortune, sickness and sorrow added. Or be harmed by poisonous snakes, fierce beasts, fire and water, weapons and soldiers, evildoers and robbers, harm unintentional. Or be born with ugly form, poor and lowly, always incomplete. Or long ill in the body, seeking life but not getting it, seeking death but not getting it, always lying on bed and pillow. Or be born among border barbarians, mutually killing and warring, day and night alarmed, father and son separated; one day death comes, straight to hell, swallowed by fire, eating coal, feet treading knife mountains, hands grasping sword trees, body bearing iron rods, boiled in cauldrons, pounded in mortars, ice and cold piercing the body, myriad pains cutting the body, day and night tormented, suffering complete, moving causes for myriad kalpas, later born again, becoming six kinds of beasts, poor and lowly, blind, deaf, with six diseases, manifold sufferings cutting the body. If after leaving home, the mind turns back, scorns the Dharma robe, violates scriptures and precepts, eats meat and drinks wine, kills, steals, indulges in licentiousness, does not uphold Dharma appearance, damages the Way gate, such will be likewise. Then the assembly all in one voice praised good, bowed to the Heavenly Venerable, and recited the eulogy:

‘Good indeed, O Supreme Venerable, compassionate, universally saving and protecting.  
Granting the Supreme Scripture, the kings gain awakening.  
For this cause jointly vow, cast sincerity and forever cherish.  
Abandon kingdoms and seek to leave home, according to conditions opening deliverance.  
Receive precepts, hear teachings and vows, men and gods deeply moved.  
Broadly expound the cause and condition Dharma, and enter the path of refuge.  
Forever make fruits of birth and death, disseminate endlessly for myriad kalpas.  
We all assembled here rejoice, drinking sweet dew together.’

If the four seasons lose measure, yin and yang not balanced, one must establish views to save people. If there be water, fire, weapons and soldiers, the world damaged, one must establish views to save people. If epidemics spread, people die, one must establish views to save people. If the sovereign meet disaster and misfortune, one must establish views to save people. If the kingdom’s life is about to perish, war and strife arise, one must establish views to save people. If newly ascending the throne, seeking to transform and govern the people, one must establish views to save people. If governing all under heaven, the land is not peaceful, one must establish views to save people. If bearing children, ill health and disasters, one must establish views to save people. All disasters and changes, all dangers and sufferings, one must establish views to save people. Whether for parents, self, wife and children, ministers and people, ancestors, current life, or final demise, or the three paths, one must establish views to save people. To establish views to save people is to dispel heavenly disasters, to settle and protect the kingdom’s life, to protect the emperor and king, to eliminate poisons and harm, to open deliverance for the people, and in birth and death to obtain blessing, the merit vast and towering, universally now and ever, so that all have refuge, merits boundless, inconceivable.

The Dao thus speaks: Those who leave home, making fields of merit in birth and death, receive superior rewards of men and gods. They should always bow and offer support, provide necessities, clothing and bedding, playthings and utensils, incense oil, brushes and scepters, carriages, horses and servants, halls and houses, terraces, pavilions and towers, flower groves and medicine gardens, bath pools and orchards, food and drink, rare treasures and silks, banners, flowers, lamps and candles, bells, chimes and Dharma implements, incense burners, bathing pots, fly-whisks and ruyi scepters, according to their possessions, employed in almsgiving, offering and supporting the leave-home Dharma body, so that it may obtain peace and joy. They develop wisdom, turn to reading the honored scriptures, bow and burn incense, uphold fasting and precepts, build seats of precious treasures, lecture the Great Vehicle, constantly make merit for sovereigns, ministers, and people, and all living beings, making fields of merit for three lives. Emperors, kings, ministers and common people, if born without faith, reviling and cursing, reproaching and insulting, imprisoning and shackling, damaging the Dharma body, or causing injury or killing, scourging and tormenting, causing suffering, defiling Dharma robes, forcing back to the world, causing leprosy and scabies, myriad disasters fulfilled, past souls and spirits straight to hell, suffering various afflictions, for myriad kalpas without redemption. If those leaving home cherish insult, do not uphold Dharma appearance, give rise to hatred, causing living beings to arise in disbelief, in past lives becoming swine, dogs, snakes and vipers. You men and women, be cautious, be cautious.

The Dao thus speaks: You men and women, would you rather strip five hundred men of their clothes than remove a single leave-home Dharma robe? Would you rather harm all evil men than harm a single leave-home Dharma body? Would you rather offend three thousand fierce beasts than offend one leave-home? Would you rather insult five thousand strong men than insult one leave-home? Would you rather lightly deceive ten thousand evil ghosts than lightly deceive one leave-home? Would you rather sit in a great fire than sit with a leave-home? Would you rather lie on a hot iron bed than sleep with a leave-home? Would you rather touch fifty thousand venomous snakes than touch a leave-home Dharma robe? Would you rather blow mountains to dust than slander leave-home? Would you rather swallow myriad measures of fierce fire than eat leave-home persons? Would you rather labor in filth ten thousand feet deep than lust after a leave-home? Would you rather spill the blood of a hundred thousand men than see leave-home disputes?

Why so? Leave-home are disciples of the Heavenly Venerable to promote scriptures and teachings; leave-home are unsurpassed masters of all men and gods; leave-home are the bridge of birth and death for all beings; leave-home are the refuge parents of all people; leave-home are the cause builders of good for sovereigns and kings; leave-home are the power of deliverance for the nine mysteries and seven ancestors; leave-home are the awakening of the original heart of all immortals, sages and saints; leave-home are the boat of the other shore beyond the three paths and five sufferings.

Receiving support and offerings from sovereigns and kings, parents and kin, the heavenly demons, kings, and ghosts of the three realms, bowing and binding their forms, all declare themselves subordinates receiving instruction in the leave-home Dharma gate. Why so? To receive the Heavenly Venerable’s transmitted teaching, to practise the Heavenly Venerable’s scriptures and laws, recite the Heavenly Venerable’s Dharma words, wear the Heavenly Venerable’s precept talismans, hold the Heavenly Venerable’s talismanic charts. Always have the Three Realms, Five Emperors, generals, officials and soldiers guarding, welcoming and sending; those who transgress shall receive punishment. If sovereigns, kings, ministers and people can develop good hearts and leave home and enter the Way, the nine ancestors and grandparents shall ascend to the upper heavenly palace, and seven generations of descendants shall not enter hell. If Waymen widely exhort those with affinity to leave home, one person counts as fifteen hundred, if three or more, their names enter immortal ranks, seen in the world rejoicing, clothes and food naturally supplied, past life born in heaven, blessings without end.

The Dao thus speaks: You men and women, having already left home, must protect Dharma robes, respect teachers and remember the Way, uphold scriptures and sincerity, diligently cultivate deeds, bow and burn incense, long fast and uphold precepts, recite scriptures and practise the Way, lecture the Great Vehicle, widely attain merit, mutually open deliverance, teach and illustrate the multitude, promote Dharma teachings, always practise compassion, aid all, carefully study the Highest Way, transform spirit and enter the subtle, always enduring, moment by moment advancing, never falling away, surely attaining true Way.

The Dao thus speaks: You men and women, all from boundless kalpas have abandoned and taken on bodies, practised good Ways, upheld fasting and precepts, now having left home, must know your predestined fate and causes of birth. Man inherits past merits and karmic strength of the Way, is born among men, lodged in parents’ womb, harmoniously formed, two halves making a body, patterned on heaven and earth, endowed with six roots, receiving primordial energy, born and transformed by myriad spirits, moving yin and yang, filling the body, eyes, ears, nose, mouth, bones, joints, skin, organs, blood and vessels, inside and out connected, gathering true qi, nourishing and guarding five spirits, making firm and stable, inner source one, sun and moon flowing and illuminating, born and transformed by myriad spirits, three origins and eight illuminations, transforming without end, inside and outside conjoined, thirty-six thousand, from beginning to end, in order and sequence. Now I tell you, you must recognize this.

Man begins gestation, causes and Way as one, heaven and earth, yin and yang, each half. Before body, lodged in parents’ womb, nine heavens forming qi, three origins arranging spirits. One month called ‘bao’ (encasement), qi encases, gathers, mixing yellow, revolving and transforming, within is true essence. Two months called ‘tai’ (embryo), spirit rides predestiny, descends into parents’ body, forms yin and yang, expands form. Three months called ‘hun’ (soul), soul means cloud, essence of yang, thin and producing spirit, clouds not abiding, revolving and managing. Four months called ‘po’ (bodily soul), po means mooring, pure qi of yin, condensing spirit, calming form, quiet and still, to fix the body. Five months called ‘zang’ (organs), zang means store, yin and yang take form, five elements arranged, placing five organs—liver, heart, spleen, lungs, kidneys—storing five spirits, controlling myriad spirits, producing and transforming the body. Six months called ‘fu’ (bowels), fu means gather, gathering pure fluids, watering and nourishing five spirits, large and small intestines, stomach, gall, bladder, excreting food and drink, forming all body. Seven months called ‘qiao’ (orifices), qiao means passing through, going out and coming in, seeing and hearing, inside and outside bright. Eight months called ‘jing’ (alertness), jing means vigilance, three parts and eight illuminations, guarding the body. Nine months spirit complete, heaven, earth, sun, moon, stars, five elements, four seasons born and transformed, all spirits, inside and outside conjoined, passing in and out of the body, upper and lower three parts, encircling three palaces, myriad things and eight thousand forms, covering, shadowing, shining, one moment born body, golden hall and jade chamber, twelve layers of towers, purple door and jade pavilion, sun, moon, stars, five mountains and four marshes, symbolizing earth and law of heaven, complete and perfect, all filling the body.

Ten months heaven and earth deities, five emperors and four directors, nine heavens’ officers, gods of ten directions, immortal youths and jade maidens, all at once watch over, the Great One guards the pavilion, Mysterious Mother guards the chamber, moving heaven and stirring earth, all saints rejoice, life officers register, heavenly emperor fixes years, according to predestined karma, receiving retribution without error, guarding form and spirit, pure mind naturally, transforming and refining dregs and obstructions, repeatedly repairing good merit, communicating to spirit by Way, nurturing form by virtue, form and spirit conjoined and fitting, returning to void and non-being, neither born nor dying, constant and solitary, man must preserve form and spirit, carefully not to damage. You Waymen must preserve and guard form and spirit, cherish and nourish essence and qi, not harm hair, not harm skin, inside complete spirit, outside complete form, head crowned with lotus, feet treading Mount Tai, midst clad with sun and moon, four images distinct, heaven and earth in the body, sun and moon sustaining the body, having a Way to follow, having virtue to respect, all things obey, all beings take refuge. Hence called Dharma robe, leaving home Dharma body.

The Dao thus speaks: After my passing, half a kalpa later, there shall arise heterodox teachings and demonic ways, not following my teaching, making their own methods, the people trust them, the world succumbs, damaging body and destroying self, accumulating treasures, making images on a grand scale, widely building houses and mansions, falsely claiming sage fruit, past blessings, lust and desire, deceiving and confusing hearts, gradually spreading and growing, men and women revere and trust, never awakening, kingdom broken, family destroyed, body perished, clan scattered, following one after another; the whole world sunk in delusion, finally without awakening. At such a time my Law greatly declines, men refuse to practise, only revering ghostly methods, silent and extinct teachings, long life and longevity, yet no belief; alas, alas! Waymen are ignorant and also follow, practising this method, forever without immortal portion or hope of longevity, can you not be cautious? Why so? Because it is the yin teaching and demonic path, the Law of death and extinction. Like grain rotting, no sign of life; like rotten earth, not able to generate life; like dead ashes, yet still existing; like dry wood, gaining new growth or not; dispersing, decaying, transforming to fertilizer, this is the silent extinction non-arising Law. The world takes life as good, death as evil, all desire life, all pity death, so I taught the Law of longevity, to cause non-death and eternal abiding. But for beings confused and inverted, unable to believe, so there is death and ruin, yet they seek to learn the Law of death and extinction, can it not be error? Moreover, the dead need no learning. Therefore the immortal Way values preservation of the body, the demonic Way values destruction of form. The immortal Way values brightness, the demonic Way darkness. The immortal Way values permanence, the demonic Way disappearance. The immortal Way values purity and emptiness, the demonic Way impurity and disgrace. The immortal Way values peace and security, the demonic Way instability and danger. The immortal Way values having a body, the demonic Way values no form. Those who have the Way live long without action, refine spirit and enter subtlety, return to the Great Way, form and spirit conjoined and fitting, always abiding and never perishing. Those without body die and dissolve to dust, form decays and spirit departs, sinking into nine nights, dark and gloomy. You Waymen should resolve on this. Therefore I pre-record, so that those with heart may know.

The Dao thus speaks: After my passing, there shall be Waymen who wear Dharma robes, appear as leave-home, but their hearts are truly fierce and evil, eating meat and drinking wine, killing, stealing, licentious, inverted, committing all manner of evil. They specialize in minor Ways, greedily seeking fame and profit, attacking roots and cutting foundation, turning from right to wrong, not believing in immortals, long life and true Law, but seek heterodox teachings and the Way of death and extinction, thousands and ten thousands of them. I shall dispatch the Five Heavenly Demon Kings to successively exterminate them.

The Dao thus speaks: There are Waymen, men and women, who uphold scriptures and precepts, bow and burn incense, give alms and aid the poor, build spirit views, copy scriptures and cast images, lecture and open enlightenment, lead and receive the willing, swallow saliva and fluid, keep the three and guard the one, extinguish despair and thoughts, aspire to true immortality and deathlessness, purely sincere and never turning back. I send heavenly spirit officers and nine earthly chief commanders to teach them great Law, further receive true scriptures, divine elixirs and spirit medicines, immortal fungus and jade blossoms, extending life and transformation, refining substance and changing spirit, the Way of abiding always, according to their studies, summoned to enter immortal palaces, Five Mountains and Grotto Heavens, gradually becoming spiritually communicative, transforming spirit and entering subtlety, flying and soaring among the heavens. Such students are difficult to measure in the world, the immortal Way secret and unknown. These kings and their kin, immortals, sages and saints, all at once praised good, bowed their heads and withdrew.
