#### The Most High Cavernous Mysterious Spiritual Treasure Scripture of the Fivefold Refining and Perfect Departure of the Living Corpse, Upper Scroll

At the time of the Celestial Venerable, in the incense-wooded garden of Chang Le Pavilion, he taught and transformed seven thousand two hundred and forty boys. The ritual was nearly complete. The Wise Boy and the Wheel Heaven Boy advanced first and made obeisance, and addressed the Celestial Venerable: 'Today, serving at your seat, joy is beyond bearing. The heavens open forgiveness, all light is universal; the dark prison of hell, the land of accumulated cold night, the three paths of suffering, the five pains, the famished ghosts and dead souls, all have received release and return, and remain in blessings. The Three Officials cease opposition, life and death both rejoice. But the dark souls newly opened, not yet entering the turning wheel, the corpse spirits run wild, the rotting bones without moisture, sinking into the nine lands, traversing the earth officials, flying cool and wandering, cannot return. The earth office hastens assembly, the shaped corpses have no peace, and suffer new distress; they look up and appeal to the heavens. Now that forgiveness is opened, all things are renewed; the august Way is already clear, its beneficence spreads to the ten directions. Humbly it is heard that the Celestial Venerable has already descended great mercy, willing to universally bestow imperial grace. Those who should be delivered, deliver; those who should be born, bring forth; those who should turn, change; those who should return, bring back. If the old ties are not yet severed, those who cannot return, their shaped corpses dwell in the old house, lingering in the nine springs, oppressed by many spirits, incompatible and unenduring, their flying souls have no resting-place, and their return affects their descendants. The great transformation having arisen, it is fitting to universally remit. If there is yet any essential matter within the law, please make it manifest, and inform the Earth Officials below, to settle, soothe, and comfort, so that all may be at peace; the nine offices right separately, to guard and protect their bodies. If pity is granted, then universal happiness and peace will ensue; life and death without grievance, blessings flowing through myriad kalpas, for generations without end.'

Thereupon the Celestial Venerable universally commanded the Celestial Emperors, the Great Supreme Lords of the Boundless Great Way, the ten directions’ great holy assemblies, the Most True Lords and Elders, the Flying Heavenly Divine Kings, the Five Elders Imperial Lords, the Southern Superior Life-Saving World-Delivering Sima, the Registrars of Life and Fate, the Supreme Saints of Longevity, the Mysterious Harmonious Jade Maidens, the various Perfected Ones, and countless hosts, all sat again together. 'Now then, we shall further open to the Wise Boy the various gateways of the law, declare the old canon of Dragon Han and Mysterious Capital, the Jade Treasury of the Netherworld, the Female Azure Jade Script, to rescue from the dark prison of hell, the land of accumulated cold night, the three paths, the five pains, the famished ghosts and dead souls, that they may all see the light.' The proclamation was made to all the heavens, each clarifying the jade writings and natural mysterious texts, universally announcing to the heavens, the earth, water offices, sun, moon, stars, the celestial pivot and jade balance, the three realms and five emperors, the five sacred mountains, the nine lands spiritual officials, the caverns of origin, abyss, emptiness, spirit, and non-being, boundless and infinite, without height or low, without form or colour, without sound or noise, without great or small, all spirits clarifying their various offices. Now those under command are the souls punished for past sins, their merits and faults, years, months, and days; all matters are enumerated, distinguishing the old homes where their shaped corpses lie, according to their jurisdiction, all to be soothed and comforted, guarded and supplied by the earth deities, so that no disturbance shall arise, according to the accomplishment of merit. Those who should be transferred, transfer; those who should be delivered, deliver; those who should turn, turn; those who should be born, bring forth.' At the earth office simple response was made, the water covenant cut off, the heavenly writings erased, all seen clearly. Then the four assemblies of Wise Boys rejoiced and made obeisance, simultaneously raising their hands and snapping fingers, declaring 'Good!'
