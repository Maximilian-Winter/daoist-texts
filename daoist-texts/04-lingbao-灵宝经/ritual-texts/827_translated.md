The Supreme Cavernous Profound Spiritual Treasure Scripture of Predestination and Cause and Effect

At that time the Supreme Dao Sovereign feasted above the Great Radiance and Supreme Glow, and spoke to the attending Perfected Ones, saying: The great virtue of Heaven and Earth is called the Primordial Dao; the precious virtue of Heaven and Earth is called the Original Dao; the binding virtue of Heaven and Earth is called the Human Dao. These three Dao combine their virtues; the precious transformation lies concealed and abiding; the origin of emptiness and non-being, preceding the august transformation. Nuwa with serpent body, Fuxi with scaled form; Yin and Yang in chaotic mixture, creation yet undivided. The Three Sages meditated together; the Five Emperors established the beginning; the Dao was accomplished and virtue fulfilled; good and evil apportioned. Radiant transformation spread and flowed; gradually arose causes and conditions; the tokens of good and evil; changes already manifest.

In primeval simplicity and innocence, the teachings of the wind were gentle and easy to follow. In the middle antiquity falsehood grew gradually, the harm and devastation overflowed the heavens; appearances of faith were not maintained, the original root of the Dao was violated. The virtue of Yu was bright in governance, his merit in controlling the waters; he was raised up by Shun, governing the labour of mountains and rivers, opening and connecting the four great rivers, rescuing and saving ten thousand people. He received the abdication and yielded; at death governed Zhong Mountain. The Lord of the Great Yin Palace, the illustrious overseer of the water officials, was bestowed heavenly precious talismans; crossing waters and drowning were made complete. The method of the Three Treasures here ascended and transformed. Excellent indeed, excellent indeed! The Dao thus is proclaimed.

The Dao Sovereign said: My Dao is lofty and subtle, obscure and manifest, easy to communicate, transforming according to goodness, descending and bringing forth precious writings. In later generations, evil will turn strong, faith in words become rare; men will mutually obstruct and stagnate, deeply mislead their descendants; in death they will meet threefold punishments and fivefold sufferings, intolerable pain beyond words. I constantly ponder this deeply; good and evil must be distinguished; good virtue not cultivated, one will suffer wrongful guilt. You must diligently cultivate purity, ever seek release and liberation; your body will pass through calamities, long preserve joy and gladness; attain to following the teachings, flourishing prosperity can be spoken of.

The Dao Sovereign said: I am concerned for the future, birth and death, guilt and blessing, the entanglement of past fate; accumulated goodness is a blessing; the reward naturally comes; the essence of the Way is to be obtained, and those who obtain it also become transcendent.

Yin Sheng bowed with head touching the ground, saying: Excellent! Excellent! Now receiving the precepts, they spread without bias. Yao preserved and had Shun and Yu; what sort of past fate, what sort of causes and conditions led them to be born as sages with wisdom, enjoying long blessings, their merit in controlling waters seen in the world? What cause then have I, feeble and dejected? Why then do I suffer vexation, painful and unhappy? What great virtue then is there that I should be a heavenly man? What secret virtue can fix one’s flight to immortality, avoid the eight calamities, and preserve the salvation of descendants? Now I bow my head and flow with tears, beseeching to know the causes and conditions.

The Dao Sovereign said: Excellent! Excellent! What you ask is most true. The precepts for the next generation you may fully hear. My precepts on predestination and cause and effect, birth and death, guilt and blessing, are burning and very clear; only I wish that future generations may clearly accept the teaching; the heavenly Way shows no partiality, it is only with the good. Be cautious, be cautious. Speak as I say.

The Dao Sovereign said: The supreme great Dao of the Three Realms, divine transformation of all things, diligently save the multitudes, universally rescue all living beings, to obtain release in the world of the Five Turbidities, can merit be spoken of? Now the five poisons are arriving; drive away all the evil rebels of the world; distinguish the worthy and the good; I fear you may fall into evil, be born a beast in the next life. For this I grieve and lament; how shall this pain be borne?

The Dao Sovereign said: At that time, princes and ministers will contend and kill one another; there will be no good nor evil, no great nor small, no high nor low, no teacher nor friend; all will suffer violent calamities; bodies perish and names vanish, not one left behind. Those born without cultivating virtue encounter these fatal disasters. Within, cherishing jealousy, no kindness or compliance; mutually slandering one another, gazing confusedly and lost. Such persons fall into the hells and hungry ghosts. They seek only the fame of a moment, do not diligently cultivate blessings; beware lest future lives be born in foul and evil states, be troubled and dishonoured by men, be butchered and tortured cruelly. Can this be spoken of?

Yin Sheng asked: The offspring suffer the calamities of the kalpa; by what method may they be instructed? Truly to care for all living beings is pitiful and lamentable, all obtain good retribution through great merit, are born in good conditions, at death depart from the three paths and five sufferings, long ascend the hall of blessings, food and clothing come naturally; this can be called excellent, excellent indeed.

Yin Sheng said: As the sage sovereign has spoken, I ask: what causes and conditions in life lead to birth among immortals and nobles, to be desired and joyful? What causes and conditions lead to birth among ordinary men? What causes and conditions lead to birth in the earth mountains, with sufferings hard to speak of? What causes and conditions lead to birth among slaves and servants, hated by men, troubled and unhappy? What causes and conditions lead to birth among wise and virtuous good men, with fragrant breath and pure mouth, honoured by men? What causes and conditions lead to birth among coarse and ugly men, constantly suffering hate and disgrace, encountering evil conduct? What causes and conditions lead to birth among the leisurely and free, honoured by men, always receiving support, wishes fulfilled? Such conduct, I only wish to be told the source of enlightenment and release, that I may well obtain salvation, long enjoy precious blessings; thus prosperous and serene, not suffering heat and distress.

The Dao Sovereign said: Hear carefully my precepts, ponder my bitter words; now for you I fully tell the essentials and subtleties. The responses of virtue have only six matters. First, a compassionate heart that kills not living beings, nourishes and sustains all things, universally assists and saves, ensuring their safety. Second, a loving remembrance of the worthy and good, not acting with a thieving mind; only desiring to give alms, to relieve the poor and destitute. Third, holding the mind pure and chaste, concentrating on diligence, abandoning distant sights and sounds, not transgressing precepts. Fourth, sincerity and earnestness, not deceiving men falsely, guarding the mouth from faults, not being greedy or impure. Fifth, no drunkenness or intoxication, keeping the clean and wise pure. Sixth, holding the mind in reverence and awe, personally believing in the Way. Practising these six matters, one obtains birth above the celestial beings, leisurely flying immortals, clothing and food supplied, honoured by men, able to be teacher and friend. At that time the blessings, the Dao constantly sings:

Not killing brings long life, no pain and ever free from suffering. All receive heavenly rank, the body peaceful and secure. Not stealing brings constant purity and honour, wealth naturally accumulates. Seven treasures form the palace, joy and peace for man. Not licentious then no disorder, the body always pure and clean. The born are upright and proper, conduct and virtue naturally wise. Not deceiving, breath fragrant, words always loyal and true. Speech issues from the Primordial Dao, discourse makes merit accomplished. A drop of wine does not pass the mouth, no mistaken deeds. Always wish to see the flowery fruits, obtain service of heavenly beings. At death ascend the heavenly halls, twenty-five spirits welcome. Ten thousand blessings come down, light and shade ever resplendent.

The Dao Sovereign said: Next, again six matters bring birth among men. What are the six? First, giving alms to save the poor and needy, the mind always mindful of suffering and little. Second, holding precepts and diligence, not violating the ten evils. Third, bearing insult and tolerating, not spreading false words. Fourth, exhorting and transforming the ignorant and stubborn, urging reverence and carefulness. Fifth, single-heartedly serving the Law, compassion and benevolence fully loyal. Sixth, loving life and hating killing, not falsely doing evil. Practising these six, one obtains birth among men, riches and honour always fulfilled, all wishes attained, giving and charity extensive; future generations born as kings of men, the ten thousand kingdoms revering. Virtue and conduct thus, the Dao then praises:

Giving alms obtains great blessings, wealth naturally comes. The born are always noble, passing on joy and gladness. Holding precepts always respectful, serving the nine exalted. Diligent and respectful, not committing evil, preserving the body long. Bearing insult humbly, anger not shown in mouth. Cursing and reviling endured without reply, salary and longevity always natural. Diligent and not slack, mindful of the Dao always true. Conduct in accord with the Dao, at death become heavenly beings. Mind true and not retreating, loyal and believing not false. Offering to all Dao virtues, birth without hardships. Able to practise these six good deeds, immediately obtain birth as man. Countenance upright and proper, naturally becomes noble body.

The Dao Sovereign said: Again there are seven ugly evils, who die and enter hell, being examined for countless kalpas, without limit. What are the seven uglies? First, unfaithful and unfilial, insulting the revered Dao, dying young or maimed, falling into hell, examined tens of thousands of years. Second, falsely invoking ghosts and spirits, reviling good men, body suffering trials, wretched beyond words. Third, destroying the Divine Halls, disrespecting the Three Exalted, body bearing heavy punishment, grievous pain in the body. Fourth, much doubt and little faith, saying there are no ghosts or spirits, inverted and without Dao, naked and filthy the three lights; body suffering all manner of diseases, always bound in heavenly prisons, associating with all evil; children born crippled, prematurely falling to hell, suffering evil calamities for ten thousand years. Fifth, bone and blood estranged, hearts invading and robbing one another, slandering ghosts and spirits, impure, arrogant, not clean; cruelly not believing the truth within; thus prematurely dying, failing to reach allotted years, death falling to hell, suffering myriad agonies. Sixth, rebellious and disobedient to law, shackled and imprisoned by father and lord, disrespecting and not loving elders, mouth uttering evil first; body torn and flayed, premature death without fulfilling faults; in next life bitten by tigers, calamity pursuing descendants. Seventh, suffering leprosy and scabies, jealous and quarrelsome, eager for strength and violence; sin and evil never leaving the body, encountering disasters and calamities, dying entering hell, falling into the caldron for countless kalpas. Such evil deeds, the Dao then praises:

Stingy and greedy, not giving alms; selfishly stealing, not supporting parents. Hoarding wealth, greedy and covetous, not helping old and poor. Wife, children, and servants not clothed, neglecting hunger and cold. Sitting upright guarding wealth, at death become famished ghosts. Body never full or satisfied, sores and ulcers arise. Begging east and west in vain, family entirely extinct. Crafting and playing with tongue, life and death stripped and mutilated. Molten copper poured in the mouth, tongue pulled out halfway. Mouth forced to swallow, entering belly and intestines rotting. In life not mindful of good, at death cast into burning tar. Ulcers and sores lightly torment men, suffering for tens of thousands of years. When sins are complete, body comes out again, becoming base person. Original evils loving to kill and harm, steal and rebel. Body maimed enters hell, suffering disasters for countless kalpas.

The Dao Sovereign said: Again there are five evils, born into beasts. First, violating precepts by stealing, bearing debts, refusing and resisting repayment. Second, lewd love of close kin, disrespecting Heaven and Earth. Third, unjustly harming innocent men, lightly swearing and not regarding law. Fourth, seeing others good and not liking, hearing evil and following; thus the body suffers cruel trials, calamities flow to descendants. Fifth, deceiving superiors and cheating inferiors, serving rulers not loyally; holding office and taking advantage, perverting loyalty and goodness; delighting in butchering fish and meat, skinning oxen and sheep, pain and poison unbearable; inwardly like wolves and jackals. These five deeds, at death falling to earth mountains, born as beasts; life harmed by five poisons; wise and foolish alike. The retribution is such, the Dao then praises:

Always practising thieving mind, bearing debts refusing repayment. Killing living beings, loving hunting and farming, acting unlawfully and worldly. Acting without integrity, small words often angry and wrathful. Sinful and evil, not self-aware, liking evil and not believing truth. In the next life fall to beasts, cattle, sheep, donkeys, and horses. Stinking and foul always bearing burdens, thus examined for countless kalpas. Inner lewdness violating Heaven, struck down by thunder and lightning. Death falling into hell, hung upside down burned by fire. Playing with tongue slandering true Dao, next life extremely painful and difficult. Molten copper poured in mouth, always hungry and cold.

The Dao Sovereign said: Again there are five virtues, bringing honour and respect, followed by all men, practised throughout the world, to which hearts incline. What are the five virtues? First, giving alms without reluctance, blessings widely flowing, universally aiding and relieving the poor and urgent, merits spreading to the eight directions. Second, offering service to the supreme Dao, reverently serving the Three Treasures. Third, pure intent in fasting and precepts, tranquil, mild, and humble to men. Fourth, enduring insult without complaint, not seeking to argue. Fifth, fond of refining the Dao Qi, clearly believing in heavenly patterns, entrusting the heart to the Dao; the Dao always within the body; penetrating the nine palaces, able to become an earth immortal; the worldly ignorant call this false. Verified thus, the Dao then praises:

Giving alms always without reluctance, universally helping to bring peace. The body receives purity and honour, the world sees one ascend to immortality. Offering to good Dao virtues, fasting and precepts reveal true spirit. Quietly meditating, mind not lazy, seven ancestors ascend to heavenly halls. Enduring insult without anger, born always upright and proper. Learning and loving Dao virtues, obtaining honour among men. Conducting mind gently, humble and lowly to men. Rescuing urgent dangers, able to prolong life and years. Reverently serving the spiritual treasure precepts, clearly refining the nine palaces Dao. Entrusting heart, believing in emptiness, life and age like Heaven.

The Dao Sovereign said: Again there are five evils, always born lowly, as servants and slaves. What are the five evils? First, pride and arrogance, not revering parents. Second, obstinate perversity, mind not respectful and reverent. Third, licentiousness and looseness, not revering the Three Exalted. Fourth, self-centeredness, stealing on the person. Fifth, bearing debts and fleeing, resisting and not repaying. These five deeds, always born lowly, as servants and slaves, beaten and oppressed, always suffering hunger and cold, life insufficient. The Dao then praises:

There are indeed ignorant fools, proud and arrogant to parents. Without reverence or respect, offspring born lowly. Seeing treasure not revering rites, offending elders. Acting without kindness or filial piety, offspring born servants and slaves. Clothing and food dependent on others, beaten without day or night. Born always suffering distress, death not escaping liberation. Licentious and loving lust, utterly not believing ghosts and spirits. Offspring suffer hunger and cold, deeds encounter hardship. Bearing debts and cursing, poor and scolding ancestors. Offspring become cattle and sheep, oppressed and tormented by men.

The Dao Sovereign said: Again there are five good virtues, always seeing good conditions, born among men, mouth fragrant and pure, body and mind always at peace, honoured and respected by men. What are the five virtues? First, utmost sincerity and love of truth, born not deceiving or cheating men. Second, reciting scriptures and practising the Dao, single-hearted with no division. Third, diligent fasting and precepts, fond of and joyful in the path of immortals. Fourth, teaching men to do good, not doing wrong or evil. Fifth, earnest and compassionate, universally helping those in urgent need, much faith and no doubt. These five good virtues all arise among noble men, mouth fragrant and pure, not falsely committing wrong, mind and intention always at peace, honoured and venerated by men; throughout life not poor, accumulated merits long; gradually becoming heavenly immortals. The reward is such, the Dao then praises:

Loyal faith and love of life’s way, compassionate heart always pitiful. Plain food keeps the body pure, after transformation ascending heavenly mysteries. Reverently serving the Three Treasures, not proud to parents. Utmost sincerity not deceiving, this conduct is loyal and filial. Guarding mouth not speaking false, conduct mind encompassing all. Exhorting men away from crimes, mindful of Law not violating. Universal aid saving urgent danger, merits exceedingly great. Increasing counting prolongs life, through life receiving joy and peace. Making friends practising righteousness widely, mutually respecting as father and mother. Closing evil and promoting good virtues, filial and brotherly moves divine spirits.

The Dao Sovereign said: Again there are six misfortunes, their conduct without Dao, filthy and degraded in body, bodies low and emaciated, going forth always encountering hunger and cold. What are the six evils? First, constantly practicing without sincerity. Second, utterly without belief in true Dao, hearing the Law but desiring to destroy it, never having a love for good, always being slandered. Third, not mindful of good precepts, mocking true men. Fourth, insulting elders, conduct full of faults. Fifth, cruel hearted and rebellious, slandering good men. Sixth, mind constantly thinking evil, without cause angry; born lowly, always suffering hunger and cold, driven and used by others, day and night without rest; body foul and odious, never attaining joy. The Dao then praises:

Deceitful and fond of false words, always without utmost sincerity. Mouth and heart contrary, always suffering filthy humiliation. Perverse and evil, fond of slander, death falling into hell. Molten copper poured in mouth, bitter poison long enduring. Indulging in wine, fond of cursing, not believing in ghosts and spirits. Iron hook binding the tongue, tormenting pain beyond words. Escaping to be born among men, breath always foul and rank. Hated by men, many calamities striking. Evil thoughts always meeting, wherever going encountering punishment. Without cause suffering evil, pain and poison unpassed. Death again falling to hell, next life becoming beast. Tossed about among five poisons, troubled, distressed, dishonoured.

The Dao Sovereign said: Again there are five virtues, born to good places, always abiding in Dao and Law, honoured and respected by all men, words never disobeyed. Accumulating goodness to five hundred, next life seeing immortal lords. Next born to be Daoist priests, studious and open. The highest wish of those with five virtues is to commune with the Most Subtle. One virtue is rejoicing in immortal truth, reverently serving the Three Treasures, chanting scriptures and practising the Dharma wheel, travelling throughout kalpas and old ages, offering incense preserving emptiness, ascending and departing from suffering and distress. The second virtue is to wander as immortals and sages, merit and virtue protecting the body. The third virtue is desiring to be among men, refining the three origins Dao. The fourth virtue is praising the Supreme Clarity, not eating and self-sufficient. The fifth virtue is roaming the void, sins temporarily overturned. The good reward is such, the Dao then praises:

Reverently serving the Three Virtues, proclaiming transformation and encouraging good deeds. Wishing to see immortals and sages, long receiving true persons. Wishing to cherish all the worthy, with us all alike. My heart and mind even, polished and refined the hundred truths of the Dao. Day and night diligently cultivating learning, wisdom becoming heavenly men. Yin Sheng goes west to transform, universally making known the true Way. Sincerely loving to think on immortal truth, accumulating thoughts without difference. First wishing to ascend to the void and roam, communing with the Most Subtle. Accumulating goodness not wearying of much, giving benefits without stinginess. Merit and virtue touching immortal truth, naturally descending the cinnabar elixir.

The Dao Sovereign said: Following the world and practising this method, again issuing the Dao of the Three Realms, the supreme Law is the Highest Clarity, flying and transforming contracting the Cavernous Truth. Next, the Infinite Kalpa, dividing the body called Tathagata, roots the same but transformations slightly different, later teaching the utmost barbarians. The ten directions and the central land, difficult to transform but thus accomplished the West. I am the Way’s Old Master; I guide Yin Sheng’s time, mouth uttering five thousand words, refining the embryo for ten years, circumnavigating the heavens three times, gathering complete blessings and foundations. Only my Way practises goodness, seeing this be deeply cautious.
