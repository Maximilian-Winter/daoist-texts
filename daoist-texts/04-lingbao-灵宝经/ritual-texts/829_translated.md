The Scripture of the Twenty-Four Births of the Mysterious and Numinal Treasure

The three divisions and eight scenes of natural divine verities, the great cycle's announcement of its period, the red brightness unveiling light, the three scenes shining clear, the five kalpas first divided. The Primordial Heavenly Worthy, with the great sages of the ten directions, the supremely true reverend deities, the Limitless Supreme Great Dao Lord, flying celestial spirits, Mysterious Harmony Jade Maidens, the multitude of the Limitless, sit together in the upper hall of the Southern Floating Mysterious Yang, in the Cypress Mound Lodge, discoursing in pure and vacuous ease, speaking simply and naturally, the numinal sounds combining tenfold, wondrously chanting the clear truth. The heavens rejoice; the sun and moon cease their wheels; the stars and constellations silently pass; the nine heavens revolve their gates; the rivers and seas are still; the mountains and peaks swallow the smoke; dragons and scales surge and leap; men and spirits rejoice thereat.

At that time, the Limitless Supreme Dao Lord bowed and made obeisance, and addressed the Heavenly Worthy: 'Today, attending the seat, the great desert opens the dusk; in the Limitless world, all is manifest; the Dharma sounds resound afar; the grace extends to the ten directions. By the great cause and effect, kalpa after kalpa is transformed and born, the rotation of holy offices, placed in charge of the total truth. Now is the time to foster and govern; to analyze the six heavens; to examine the principle and operation of kalpas; to calculate the measure of sentient beings; to reckon the long night; to scrutinize the Three Officials; to perform labourious duties of heavy burden, joy and sorrow difficult to express. I dare to attach myself to the numinal wind, and by the sound disclose my heart. Formerly with the Primordial Heavenly King, together in the verdant mulberry grove of the long mulberry, we heard the Heavenly Worthy universally proclaim to the great sage reverend deities: The Mysterious and Numinal Jade Secret of the Celestial Pattern has three divisions, eight scenes, twenty-four images of divinities; above respond the twenty-four truths; the middle part the twenty-four vital energies; below guard the twenty-four births. The numinal chapters gleam resplendently, wondrously surpassing the void; those who behold them, the nine heavens inscribe their names in golden slips; by these are life and death exchanged for immortality. The coming age will be urgent; three and five ill-fated losses; myriad multitudes with short lives; drifting amid eight calamities; wind blades torment the body; the five sufferings all present in the infant; sinking into the long night, without seeing the three lights, unknowingly accepting the opposite; letting birth and death take their course; caressing it wounds the breast; painfully touching men and gods. Now the great compassionate Dao practice universally extends its grace and exaltation. I humbly pray that the Heavenly Worthy may have pity and mercy, directly abiding in the mysterious methods, teaching what is not yet heard; causing those who have not seen to see; those not yet accomplished to accomplish; blessings to flow to all; receiving grace through countless kalpas. If instructed and taught, immediately should one bear the divine drum and wind, cause the waves to flow and spread, cleanse and stir the three realms, solemnly inspect the multitude of demons, direct and regulate the six heavens, behead and slay the multitudes of evil, pacify the land and nurture the people, so that yin and yang may be at peace; the clear transformation already flourishing; the Dao unimpeded in the great void.'

Then the Heavenly Worthy looked upward with a smile, emitting from his mouth vital energies of blue, yellow, and red hues; the radiance thoroughly illuminating, within and without the ten directions, leaving no darkness nor concealment, an awakening of the kalpa's dawn. Golden script, purple characters, jade writings, cinnabar seals, the colours shining gloriously amidst the three vital energies; the three eight-scene gods, twenty-four truths, each with thousands of chariots and myriad riders, above the empty mystery, supporting and guarding the numinal writing; the heavens, sun, and moon shed brilliant splendour; the myriad ferryings blend and irrigate; flying incense and eightfold encirclements; myriad saints acclaim and celebrate; in one time they worship the truth.

The Heavenly Worthy proclaimed: 'Now all births, their joy is beyond comparison; hearts fully disclosed and treasures revealed, feelings without concealment. One must follow the mysterious methods, the seven treasures to guard the numinous; gold is the altar; impart to the son the path of divine truth. The reverence of the Dao and the weight of the Dharma, performed once every forty thousand kalpas, descends to the world to save men. The secret, if true, descends; if disclosed, calamity comes. Now I thus inform you; clearly perceive it.' The Supreme Dao Lord rejoiced and sighed with pleasure, standing facing north to hear the decree.

The Heavenly Worthy commanded the Nine Light Supreme Truth, the flying celestials of the ten directions, the attendant jade youths of the scripture, to unfold the nine-light jade treasures, produce golden script, purple characters, jade writings, cinnabar seals, the three divisions, eight scenes, twenty-four images, grandly placing them on a white jade table suspended in space; a nine-coloured kerchief, cloud essence knotted as flying brocade canopy, hung over the scripture. The great sages of the heavens, Limitless Heavenly Worthy, flying celestial kings, the three celestial perfected beings, simultaneously supervised and pledged; burning incense and scattering blossoms; chanting the numinal chapters; circling the palace city; three rounds around the scripture; conforming to ancient texts with respectful demeanor and natural majesty, delivering it to the Dao Lord for transmission. The ritual roughly completed; the three scenes restored to their places; all truths withdrew from the seat. At that time in the midst of the red brightness heaven, whether male or female, none failed to model virtue, return heart and faith, all obtaining liberation in the world.

In the first year of the Supreme Emperor, on the second day of the ninth month, the later sage Lord Li journeyed to the Western River, traversing and observing the eight gates. At that moment the Primordial Heavenly King rode the eight-scene jade chariot, driving the nine-colored mysterious dragon, with three pure flying clouds, leading a host of immortals, holding aloft splendid banners, lions and white cranes, howling and singing resoundingly, floating in the air to meet at the Western River. Lord Li bowed and requested to ask the Heavenly King: 'Formerly I was instructed and given the celestial book with jade characters of the twenty-four images; though I obtained the text, I had not fathomed the wondrous chapters; though there are images and praises, the likenesses are absent; cultivating the hermitage with reverence, the wondrous principles are difficult to explain. Now encountering the Heavenly Worthy, my joy and celebration are beyond words; I beseech your mercy to complete and perfect the supreme Dao truth.'

Then the King spat forth from his mouth the Mysterious Jade Talisman of Inner Vision, and gave it to Lord Li, bidding him to observe a pure fast for a thousand days, fumigate his body with five fragrances, face eastward and wear the talisman. The forms and spirits of the sons appeared fully; he would naturally attain comprehension; all doubts were suddenly resolved. Lord Li bowed and accepted the teaching, fully observing the celestial rites, fasting a thousand days, facing east and wearing the talisman; the three eight-scene gods all manifested within his body. The golden script and jade characters, twenty-four images, shone in the void, the text and colours brilliant, penetrating without end, weaving naturally. At that time he was commanded to appoint the chief diagram immortal to paint the images. Golden script, purple characters, jade writings, cinnabar seals, from the Southern Pole Upper Origin Nine Light Supreme Lord’s wife, the east and west two flowers, north and south true lords, the five sacred mountains' immortals, the pure and empty perfected beings, all received the true text; and these are the images inscribed later by the sage, each accordingly attached.
