## Supreme Clarity Great Ultimate Hidden Commentary on the Jade Scripture, Precious Secret

The Most High is profound and subtle, the Three Caverns and First Origin. Its inscrutable words are deep and hard to hear, lofty and dark-crowned, encompassing all ranks. Vast is its supreme virtue, majestic and exalted, fully possessing the abode, the gate of myriad wonders, the origin of spirits and immortals, collected and formed into text. Reciting and chanting ascend to the void, urging dragons to ride the clouds; only faith and utmost effort control the emotions and cause concentration. 

Therefore, men of aspiration seek this scripture afar, revering the master, bowing at the hall of virtue, truly questioning and consulting, requesting to receive the precious scripture. Without transgression or doubt, true faith and right way, immortality can be expected. Spitting out the old and taking in the new, imbibing the heroic fungus, the void calls mutually, flying immortals have their appointed time. The Dharma wheel fixedly awakens, penetrating the nine limits; far and mysterious are the wondrous secrets, how can the middle immortals know?

Then the true disciple, if able to meditate alone facing the scene, aligning the path with the elixir of emotions, refining and testing color and imagery, enduring hunger and braving cold, bitter but never weary; at midday he dines, slanders come but he is not saddened, praise gathers but he does not rejoice. Virtue alone within, externally indifferent to many faces, bathing in blue calamus, with no residue of embryonic qi, ascending to fasting and entering the chamber, burning incense of true sandalwood. 

Then he dons cape and cap, arranges solemn ritual garments, sets rites in the lower quadrant, submits himself to the Supreme True, thrice bows before the scripture. He then unfolds the eight-colored aggregates, displays the unsurpassed treasure trove, and holds the reading of the Great Cavern Dongxuan, the Tao and Virtue esteemed scripture, Eight Plain Hidden Chapters, Golden Truth and Jade Radiance, dispersing demons and scattering spirits, summoning immortals to step into the void, flying along feathered scriptures, pure sound soaring to the skies, myriad immortals descending to the court.

The Most High commands the carriage, jointly riding cloud carriages, lush and flourishing, distant and darkly united, the Three Essentials aligned with radiance, bearing the perfect brightness on the nape, garbed in gauze robes, jade pendants and fiery bells, solemn and lofty is the True One, floating afar on expedition, jade blossoms support the wings, jointly ascending Supreme Clarity. Not asking high or low, it depends on utmost sincerity; the Three Realms offer tribute, the demon kings attend and welcome, long years without limit; who can know the kalpa lifespan? Here is freedom and ease, eternally my advantage and steadfastness.

## The Most High Jade Scripture Hidden Commentary says:

Teaching the method of the Tao and Virtue Scripture. The master faces north, holding the scripture on the table; the disciple prostrates to the left; the master holds the scripture, the disciple holds the method talisman. The master clicks his teeth thirty-six times, the heart holds the three palaces: the Mud Pellet, the Elixir Field, and the Crimson Palace; the Three as One emerge, a thousand chariots and ten thousand riders, forming the guard of the Dharma master; then he chants:

> Floating high, great void ridge,  
> Flowing radiance at the upper mystery.  
> The scripture begins without end to the kalpa,  
> Long preserving heaven, earth, and man.  
> The world ruler studies to attain Yao,  
> The Taoist chants to gain immortality.  
> The worthy now receive it,  
> Transmitting by the law, by mutual transmission.  
> When no supreme virtue child appears,  
> Guard the secret, do not falsely proclaim.  
> To the sect ascending Supreme Clarity,  
> To abandon it is to fall into the Nine Springs.  
> I speak the path of non-action,  
> Pure tranquility and virtue are natural.  

Thus the disciple thrice bows and receives the scripture. If a female disciple, prostrate to the right. All scriptures are thus.

---

## The Most High Jade Scripture Hidden Commentary says:

Teaching the Great Cavern True Scripture method. The master faces north, scripture on the table; master holds the scripture, disciple holds the method talisman. The master clicks his teeth thirty-six times, heart holds the Most High Jade Emperor, commanding the light of sun and moon to illuminate the bodies of master and disciple, then chants:

> How subtle and distant is the Great Mystery,  
> True men bind the void to give birth.  
> The empty ford is the natural Tao,  
> Gathered into the Great Cavern Scripture.  
> The true worthy reverently hold to the law,  
> Riding the motion through the Yellow Court.  
> The Most High erases death records,  
> Life officers record immortal names.  
> Guard the secret accumulated over years and kalpas,  
> To leak is to fall to hell.  
> Disasters and tests reach the seven ancestors,  
> The wind blade dissolves your form.  

Thus the disciple thrice bows and receives the scripture.

## The Most High Jade Scripture Hidden Commentary says:

Teaching the Most High Spiritual Treasure Dongxuan Scripture method. The master faces north, scripture on the table; master holds scripture, disciple holds method talisman. The master clicks teeth thirty-six times, heart holds the five viscera colors, commanding completeness, forming a precious canopy cloud, covering master and disciple; then chants:

> What then should one desire?  
> Writings shine beyond the Great Void,  
> Brilliant and profound, veiled and dense.  
> Transmission all accords with law,  
> To leak is to fall to hell.  

Thus the disciple thrice bows and receives; then once more bows to the ten directions, starting from the north, turning east and around. One imagines the Most High’s true forms in all directions, as if present now.

---

## The Most High Jade Scripture Hidden Commentary says:

Teaching the Most High Three Sovereigns Heavenly Pattern. The master faces north, scripture on table; master holds scripture, disciple holds talisman. The master clicks teeth twenty-four times, heart holds the three palaces, each with a true man, like an infant's form, unclothed, mouth exhaling purple qi to fumigate master and disciple; then chants:

> The Most High’s heavenly pattern,  
> Transmitting the beginning of heaven and earth.  
> The sovereign man proclaims the profound decree,  
> This is the scripture of supreme truth.  
> The worthy are ordered to reverently receive,

Thus the disciple twice bows and receives the scripture.

---

> The seven ancestors ascend to heaven,  
> This world is the gate of Tao and Virtue.  

Thus one may read the scripture.

---

## The Most High Jade Scripture Hidden Commentary says:

When reading the Tao and Virtue Scripture, click teeth thirty-six times, swallow saliva thirty-six times, first holding in mind the left Azure Dragon, right White Tiger, front Vermilion Bird, rear Black Tortoise, feet below the Eight Trigrams, thirty-six divine tortoises, lion crouching before, head adorned with seven stars, five viscera generate five qi, embroidered patterns cover the body, the Three as One attend the scripture, each with thousands of chariots and myriad riders; heaven and earth each have eighteen thousand jade maidens and jade youths guarding them.

---

## The Most High Jade Scripture Hidden Commentary says:

When reading the Dongzhen Scripture, click teeth thirty-six times through, swallow saliva thirty-six times, first hold in mind the return wind mixing with the emperor of one hundred gods, myriad true ones; then chant the Dong Scripture.

---

## The Most High Jade Scripture Hidden Commentary says:

Reading the Dongxuan Scripture, click teeth thirty-six times, swallow saliva thirty-six times, hold the five viscera five colors of qi, inscribe the five planets’ essence above, and then read the scripture.

---

## The Most High Jade Scripture Hidden Commentary says:

When chanting the Most High Dongxuan Stepping-Into-Void Scripture, first click teeth three times, swallow saliva three times, hold in mind the sun and moon on one’s face, enter by the nostrils into the golden flower chamber of the inner chamber, the radiance emerges behind the nape, manifesting the nine-colored circular image, penetrating the jade pillow, illuminating the ten directions, following me traveling afar, revolving and returning. The sun enters from the left nostril, the moon from the right nostril; after completion, again click teeth as initially.

---

## The Most High Jade Scripture Hidden Commentary says:

When reading the Ascending Immortality Scripture, first click teeth twelve times, swallow saliva twelve times, chant one chapter, thrice complete the teeth clicking; each scroll has its method; if not recorded, this secret may be used.

---

## The Most High Jade Scripture Hidden Commentary says:

The Tao Scripture without receiving a master, the spirit will not function. If the world has no lawful master and no talisman transmitter, then with the method talisman cast into tranquil governance, perhaps can secretly open to the mysterious master Laozi, facing north with three bows; then with offerings to the hungry and poor, with a heart of equality, use the scripture. If one has a master, this method is not necessary.

---

## The Most High Jade Scripture Hidden Commentary says:

Turning the scripture, sit upon a small bed, five feet high, breadth and length equal; only with headscarf and cape, no need for rough robe. The Most High True One’s scripture reading ritual garments are a nine-rayed brocade cape of Li silk, a cinnabar gauze shining turban, lion-patterned shoes. Now Taoists reading scripture diligently perform rituals, roughly their cape and robe; upon attaining the Tao, the Heavenly Emperor bestows the Li silk nine-rayed cape, heavenly treasure tassels, flying immortal ritual garments, to reward past virtues. Do not envy the world’s crowns and caps, nor forsake the Taoist’s humble garb. Worldly dress though presently glorious, cannot escape death; the Taoist in coarse garments ascends immortal, wearing heavenly robes. Wearing heavenly robes causes one to fly as immortal, riding the void.

---

## The Most High Jade Scripture Hidden Commentary says:

The method of reading scripture uses the Hua Xia (Chinese) sound; this is the correct sound of the Nine Heavens. The Sixty-four Great Brahman Praise Scripture, chanting and controlling sound, is also the correct sound. The reading voice must conform to this correct sound. The Immortal Elder said: Laozi westward to the Hu taught foreigners to read scripture; mostly it was the great Brahman heavenly sound, which Taoists liked.

---

## The Most High Jade Scripture Hidden Commentary says:

After reading five hundred words, click teeth thrice, licking upper and lower lips with the tongue, swallowing saliva thrice; this causes the breath to not exhaust, and after time the voice becomes clear. Not knowing this method damages breath and wastes spirit. The True One said: boil thick bamboo leaves for drink; reading scripture preserves thought, enhances spirit, and harmonizes qi to flow.

---

## The Most High Jade Scripture Hidden Commentary says:

The Most High Great Hidden Talisman, nine pieces, taken at midday with water in one gulp; after a thousand days, ingress and egress are uninterrupted, invisibly present in thought, becoming an immortal. Wearing the five talismans of the Spiritual Treasure upon the body, one rides dragons and controls qi, passing through water and fire; the Five Emperors support and assist, roaming far and soaring high, also becoming immortal. Wearing the true forms of the Five Mountains and the Great Talismans of the Three Caverns, one must not approach rooms or chambers, or engage in yin filth; death is certain without doubt, no hope of immortality; be cautious indeed.

---

## The Most High Jade Scripture Hidden Commentary says:

When a Taoist enters a chamber to fast, reading the Most High Stepping-Into-Void Jade Chapter and the Flying Feather Scripture, he can gallop the nine dragons, cloud carriages come to meet; these two matters should be kept secret.

---

## The Most High Jade Scripture Hidden Commentary says:

Regularly recite five thousand words ten thousand times; the Most High Cloud Dragon descends to welcome. If after ten thousand recitations it does not come, read thrice in one month; the cloud carriage must arrive, then one ascends immortal.

---

## The Most High Jade Scripture Hidden Commentary says:

Constantly read the Yellow Court Inner Scene Scripture, thus becoming immortal. Constantly nourish original qi, also the path of not dying.

---

## The Most High Jade Scripture Hidden Commentary says:

Always maintain head upright, azure like jade, two hands like cinnabar, two feet like snow. With this essence and thought read scripture, conduct wondrous affairs, nearing immortality. Always click teeth twelve times, day and night twelve hours, once at each hour; also will not die, spirit constantly guards.

---

## The Most High Jade Scripture Hidden Commentary says:

Clicking teeth is named the Heavenly Drum, summoning body and spirit, gathering heavenly truth, assembling myriad immortals. Left teeth clicking is named ringing heavenly bell; right teeth clicking is striking heavenly chime. Taoists fearing and avoiding ghosts and thieves, ring bell and chime each twenty-four times; no demon spirit dares approach; heavenly demons protect the body; a hundred blessings arrive together.

---

## The Most High Jade Scripture Hidden Commentary says:

The Laozi Tao and Virtue Scripture says: "Look and see not the barbarian, hear and listen not the rare; grasp and catch not the subtle"—these are the titles of the Three Primal Elder Lords. It also says: these three cannot be interrogated; therefore mixed as one. The Three Essentials combined as the Primal One Lord, the mystical father and primal mother of the embryonic honored. Reading this scripture, the Three Elder Lords see the child, the child sees them, the immortal way is accomplished. The Tao exhausts here; the book does not exhaust speech, speech does not exhaust meaning. The profundity of principle is none greater than this writing, meaning it is seen but none can fully know it.

---

## The Most High Jade Scripture Hidden Commentary says:

Kunlun, Penglai, Zhongshan, Songgao, Wangwu mountains, Supreme Clarity scriptures are also complete there.

---

## The Most High Jade Scripture Hidden Commentary says:

The nation of Nara Wei, Kunlun Bird Mountain, ruled separately by the Primordial Heavenly King, seven treasure palaces, high terrace reaching heaven. The Western Queen Mother first studied the Tao, also ascending this mountain. There are all Three Cavern scriptures complete; writings created within the void, each character square measuring one zhang. This mountain’s true form map is weighty; wearing and bearing it one obtains the Three Caverns’ profound truth. All beasts on the mountain can fly and do not die, much less humans. Many wondrous things come forth there. The mountain’s many saints chant scriptures, all in great Brahman heavenly voice, neither mournful nor harsh, neither slow nor fast, broad and elegant, essential and subtle, listeners melt with joy. On Kunlun Mountain many immortals chant in the Chinese language, the Nine Heavens’ recitations, desolate and clear, pure sound ringing, listeners reaching heaven’s heights, forgetting emotion. At times all immortals assemble, singing Dongxuan, together reading and chanting, new voices striking, deep and far-reaching, raising ornate voids, strings plucked in the void, and Jade Clarity is moved with joy. Chanting scripture is what the Supreme True most values. The "High Terrace Inscription" says: "You desire to ride the void and soar in the empty; chant my Stepping Dong Feather Scripture." Immortals do not understand these words. The Stepping Dong and Feather Scriptures are two books; the Most High profound scripture also is not transmitted to the middle immortals.

---

## The Great Ultimate True Man says:

The Stepping Void Scripture is the Lingbao fasting stepping and chanting; the Feather Scripture is the Dongzhen chanting.

---

## The Most High Jade Scripture Hidden Commentary says:

At home studying the Tao, one must receive five thousand words. On new and full moons, natal day, eight festivals, midday and midnight, each once recite. If one cannot read, request a master to read; one should attend incense offerings, wholeheartedly listen and receive the scripture’s meaning, intending to practice the scripture’s supreme affairs. Entrusting form to the Taiyin day, the Heavenly Emperor’s cloud chariot welcomes the person’s spirit, not passing through the Three Officials’ hell examinations on Mount Tai. Born above in heaven before the Heavenly Emperor, born below in the human world in a marquis family. Appearance complete, spirit radiant; observers’ hearts rejoice; even changing female to male, connecting fate to Supreme Clarity, the immortal way can be achieved. This scripture communicates among all ranks, no great or small; as desired, no obstruction; aiding death and nourishing life, all are appropriate. Also able to pacify country and calm people, subdue border barbarians, all who follow the Tao. This scripture is wondrous; none surpass it.

---

## The Most High Jade Scripture Hidden Commentary says:

Though a scholar cultivates good conduct, sometimes due to past life confrontations, sickness, calamity, frequent troubles and weariness, Taoist masters should hold fast to fasting, turning five thousand words, and dispelling demons, wisdom, Jade Clarity, Golden Truth, Dong Scriptures; middle grade mighty spirits, guarding and protecting the sick, so-called aiding those in distress to attain help. No method wheel surpasses this.

---

## The Most High Jade Scripture Hidden Commentary says:

Receiving the Three Cavern Scriptures, one must sever worldly affairs and act accordingly. The Three Caverns altogether are named the Most High Dong One, the highest scripture. If three people share these words, none shall ascend immortal. Be cautious, be cautious.

---

## The Most High Jade Scripture Hidden Commentary says:

Receiving scriptures, all compare characters thrice; one character mistaken shortens life by one year; exceeding this count adds on; adding or subtracting one character also deducts one year. If one recklessly destroys scripture books, in the next life will undergo wind blade body dissolution test. Receiving scripture without revering master, cultivation is without blessing; in the next life afflicted with disease and among six beasts. Among the world’s evils none is worse than Yin thieves; if one cooperates with this in the path, one surely faces world trials. Deafness, blindness, heart and nose vexation, stomach fluid blockage, bodily worm disease, dying to hell, enduring all afflictions, knife mountains, sword trees, boiling and swallowing fire, orifices ulcerate, seeking death in vain, born as swine or dog, being cut and carved—these are the triple evils.

---

## The Most High Jade Scripture Hidden Commentary says:

Teaching from middle grade scripture downwards, facing east, click teeth twelve times, chanting:

> Solemn, solemn is the Most High true virtue,  
> Erasing traces, ceasing void leisure.  
> Radiance ascends to Great Essence,  
> Coming and going without ferry crossing.  
> If one has heart, it will respond naturally;  
> If not concentrated on Tao, it is continuous.  
> Passing to and fro mutually transmitting,  
> Forming bonds in the nether darkness.  

Masters and disciples marry without clothing. Holding scripture and practising many good deeds, always as if facing a deep abyss. Externally rescuing disaster and illness, internally protecting and ferrying the body. Thus finishing, bow and receive scripture transmission. Immortals’ original occupation also uses this spell method.

---

## The Most High Jade Scripture Hidden Commentary says:

The Great Cavern True Scripture, sometimes called the Most True Tao Scripture, sometimes the Supreme Clarity Upper Tao View Heaven Inner Scripture Highest Grade, has ten scrolls. The Supreme Clarity Golden Elixir Scripture has seven scrolls. Its highest grand subtle great elixir dispels demons, wisdom Great Cavern True Scripture has thirty-nine chapters.

---

## The Most High Jade Scripture Hidden Commentary says:

The Supreme Clarity’s highest meaning, the utmost subtle words, the flying immortal wondrous scripture. The Lingbao Scripture, sometimes called Dongxuan, sometimes Most High Ascending Profound Scripture, all are the highest grade of high immortals, utmost truth of the void, profound treasure of the great Tao. The Three Sovereigns Heavenly Pattern, sometimes called Dongshen, sometimes Dongsian, sometimes Most High Jade Plan. These Three Cavern scriptures and talismans are the Tao’s skeleton and discipline, the Great Void’s profound sect, the Supreme True’s chief scripture. How could the middle immortals have heard them?

---

## The Most High Jade Scripture Hidden Commentary says:

The precious secret is the ancestor of many scriptures. The Most High commands transmission to the Great Ultimate Immortal Lords, Immortal Kings, Immortal Elders, Immortal Ministers. Without receiving this appointment, none transmit it. Taoists who see this book should all be persons of Immortal Lords; their mysterious register names will be determined. Transmit it with method talisman of five taels gold, ninety feet of white silk, three hundred sheets of scripture paper, presented to the Tao master; then know that the seeking of the Tao’s utmost sincere elixir is complete, and may then be told this precious secret. The master and disciple first fast in pure fasting for nine days, or seven, five, three days; at midday receive scripture. When transmitting scripture, master faces north in a quiet chamber, left hand requests scripture, holds it; disciple’s right hand holds the Tao oath talisman, agreeing not to falsely divulge to the world. Inscribe the ink words: with seven ancestors as witness, will practise benevolence, filial piety, great compassion, wishing to fly immortal and ascend the void, the seven ancestors escaping bitter poison, all born in heaven. After master finishes reading, orally blesses the disciple:

> Great simplicity has no substance,  
> The holy holy call it profound.  
> The two principles from beginning to end,  
> The myriad things’ ultimate abyss.  
> The Tao transforms through countless kalpas,  
> Revolving as a round ring.  
> Profound principle returns without forgetfulness,  
> Dark meditation responds to past fate.  
> Great awakening, unsurpassed wisdom,  
> None surpass this Dharma wheel.  
> Aspiring to Tao and following faithful law,  
> Sincerely fully what master should proclaim.  
> If the world has no worthy man,  
> Seal it in famed mountains,  
> Follow and hastily grant,  
> Embrace the stone and cross the Nine Springs.  
> You are the Great Ultimate Lord,  
> Highest honored grants me transmission.  
> The Three Realms report and open,  
> Mysterious Capital heard at one time.

Thus six bows, both receive. Receiving this method object, the master should establish scripture ritual fasting, giving to those poor and destitute in the world, with one heart of equality, no partiality. This scripture constantly has jade maidens and jade youths each thirty attending, also examining Taoist’s virtue, reporting to the Most High. Be cautious, be cautious. In reading scripture, hold in mind the Three Primal Lords in the Mud Pellet Palace. Master clicks teeth thirty-six times, then blesses. 

Thus ends the Hidden Commentary on the Tao Scripture.

---

## The Great Ultimate True Man says:

All true men from ancient times mostly follow their cultivation, separately receiving their secret formulas, not suddenly receiving all. Thus immortals each have their own transmission of this one matter. Divided transmission requires method talisman of one tael gold, one hundred sheets of paper, no need for plain silk; holding blessings as above.

---

## The Great Ultimate True Man says:

The immortal’s original occupation transmission is called the Tao Trace Scripture. Method all should be received from master, facing west, using many scriptures’ blessings, with cinnabar silk ten feet, embodying utmost sincerity. Upper immortals have ten jade maidens and ten jade youths attending; middle immortals five; lower immortals three; always attending to transmit, burning incense, protecting the disciple’s body and family. Always be loyal and filial, honor and reverence to master, practice four kinds of heart, endure humiliation and diligently progress, give charity and accept faults, do not contend with vanity; mind guards will, think of Tao and always wish, soaring with great clarity, flying the upper mystery, supporting high immortals, learning the great path of Tao. If able to receive the Most High Hidden Commentary method words, practice the Great Cavern Scriptures, then called Most High Great Dharma Master. Those who have received the Three Cavern Scriptures are called Most High Profound Scripture Great Dharma Masters; Dharma Masters themselves transmit the immortal Tao Trace Scripture. If a person does not receive this Tao Trace Scripture from a master, jade maidens will not protect him; practicing Tao is of no benefit to the body. In times of illness, suffering, or demon affliction, one may fast and chant the Tao Trace Scripture in quiet; all ghosts and goblins, disasters and calamities, should respond and disperse. Jade maidens and jade youths sing praise; their sound reaches the Nine Profound; immortals rejoice and save the disciple.

---

## The Great Ultimate True Man says:

Since the beginning of kalpas, Chi Songzi, Wang Qiao, Xianmen, Xuanyuan, Yinzi, all received the five thousand words hidden commentary secret, diligently practising the great Tao, becoming leaders among true men; truly essential secrets. Until Emperor Xiaowen of Han, fond of Tao and Virtue, sincere and exhausted, the Most High True Man descended by the river to transform Emperor Wen. The True Man recited scriptures; the emperor had not yet expanded the profound principles of Tao and Virtue, but his heart thirsted for it; when hearing of an extraordinary man rising, he personally drove to bow, reverently questioning, consulting the Daoist. The True Man explained the verses, briefly a corner, unblocking his obstruction. This scripture’s profundity is difficult to exhaust; thus said not to be thought over and discussed. Yet enough for Emperor Wen to entrust publication to the heaven and nether regions, riding radiance on clouds, reins loosened flying dragons, directly entering the Golden Flower Palace of heaven, and teaching the heavenly beings; also next in line on immortal path. Joyful indeed. Emperor Wen practiced Tao and Virtue Scripture; thus magnificent. Emperor Wu only labored at immortality, but by nature firm; he also obtained a place among heavenly beings. Learning Tao is based on gentleness and faith. Reading one chapter of the river True Man scripture penetrates the Most High Jade Capital; heavenly immortals cross hands and praise; transmission sounds through the Three Realms; demon kings respect in the hall; Fengdu respectfully bows to the Dharma Master. The river True Man is the Dharma Master of the Tao and Virtue Scripture, hence the honor of his verses. The secret of self-cultivation must not be shown to the vulgar; the vulgar often laugh at this scripture as empty and false, saying it cannot ascend immortal or save the world; this depends on past fate, and cannot be forced taught. If teaching does not succeed, both gain sin; hence it is proper to keep it deep and secret.

---

## The Great Ultimate True Man says:

In venerating this scripture, mind on Most High Laozi, thrice bow; then recall Mr. Yin and the river True Man as central Dharma Masters, thrice bowing and facing the scripture. Always thirty-six thousand immortal youths and jade maidens attend the scripture, burning incense and scattering flowers, bringing all immortals; for the disciple petition for immortal life, seek the way to ascend in broad daylight.

---

## The Great Ultimate True Man says:

When Taoists make the golden elixir, recite it through one day and one night; the Great One is joyful, coming to the disciple’s chamber. Dispelling ghosts and testing inauspicious changes; what is done will surely succeed.

---

## The Great Ultimate True Man says:

Learning Tao is based on fasting and purification. Reciting scripture must fast; checking scripture must fast; copying scripture must fast; writing talisman must fast; combining medicine must fast; making golden elixir must fast; meditating must fast; requesting master must fast; bowing must fast; receiving scripture must fast; rescuing illness and dispelling disaster must fast; invoking True Ones must fast. Fasting is what the Most High reveres, what Laozi protects, what all saints rely on; fasting methods are many, to be practised by the disciple receiving.

---

## The Great Ultimate True Man says:

When I first obtained immortality, I heard this instruction from the Most High True Man, obediently practised it, now transmitting it to you. Keep it secret and cultivate it; secretly teach future generations of those with past fate; to respond to the Most High Immortal, is this acceptable?

---

## The Great Ultimate True Man says:

Those who gain birth in the immortal saint gate and delight in Tao and scripture, with gentle nature and compassionate heart, all have past fate wishing to meet today. Nearing immortality, one ought diligently to do ritual affairs, to be surely a Most High Immortal.

---

## The Great Ultimate True Man says:

If a person has immortal true appearance, its essence is compassionate heart touching things, to assist the appearance; then one obtains immortality. If one cannot endure nature and accept faults, the immortal appearance fails. These words are true; you must be cautious, reflect, and observe—these words are utmost.

---

## The Great Ultimate True Man says:

I have the Nine Heavens Yellow Plain Hidden Secret to transmit to people. Sometimes called Dongzhen Dignified Ceremony, or the Dharma Wheel Primordial Outline Scripture Most High Hidden Secret, or Most High Jade Clarity Inner Teaching, or Most High Three Caverns Dignified Ceremony Scripture, or Most High Jade Scripture Great Ultimate Hidden Commentary Secret. Transmitted to those with past fate responding to the Most High Jade Capital Mysterious Capital Great Void Great Ultimate Immortal Lords, Immortal Kings, Immortal Elders, Immortal Ministers. Not told to beginners. If in the world one meets such scripture master, all are already in the Mysterious Capital with recorded gold names.

---

## The Great Ultimate True Man says:

Serving the Upper Scripture, Taoists must make heart and mouth correspond; see others as oneself, honor the master as father, think on scripture as thirst, consider relief of suffering, remonstrate and exhort goodness, be gentle and tolerant of faults, love those on the Tao, avoid love of mountains and waters, always practice compassion, benevolence, and management. Taoists in high place do not arrogate, endure hardship and affliction, yet hold purpose unwavering; these may be spoken to about the Tao. They should be told the Hidden Commentary. If one’s appearance is finely decorated but heart and mouth diverge, keep secret in the precious secret, forever hidden. After receiving scripture for three years, conduct should be observable, certainly recognizable. Therefore this scripture is most secret for upper immortals; middle immortals rarely see it. Those whose past life merits are insufficient to propagate the great law, the Most High Mysterious Capital Jade Capital has no registered name, and will never encounter such scripture master. If one foolishly reveals the secret to one person, he cannot ascend immortal, dies as a low ghost, suffers bitterly in the Three Officials’ hell, in the next life with six diseases, revolving in retribution; the sin is very great; therefore it is hidden; thus called hidden commentary.

---

## The Great Ultimate True Man says:

One who fasts long and quietly, meditates deeply and recites scripture repenting sins, burning incense and bowing, will see flying heavenly beings. Immortal youths and jade maidens descend to the disciple’s chamber. Sometimes one hears words of praise in the chamber, or radiance illuminating the body, or sounds of gold and jade, eight musical tones; all these are the disciple’s Tao desire to succeed. Diligent, diligent; the Most High will not fail you. The trouble is that you are not firm and have not fully reached the scripture; thus the immortal way is difficult. Always remember these words.

## The Great Ultimate True Man says:

When I first attained immortality, I received the Most High Great Tao Lord’s Great Wisdom Scripture, reciting it seven times, clicking teeth thrice, swallowing saliva thrice, holding the Three Essentials Lords in the Golden Flower Palace, like an infant’s shape, chanting this text. The Wisdom Original Scripture has thirty-one thousand one hundred words; the supreme saint copied and proclaimed this chapter, fitting for Most High Jade Capital Great Ultimate Immortal Lord Taoists. Now I tell you; do you not desire to hear it?

## The Most High Wisdom Scripture Eulogy

The Most High Profound Void Sect,  
Extending the Tao, respecting its scripture.  
Looking up and down, one attains immortality,  
Enduring kalpas without number.  
Majestic is the Most True Virtue,  
Silent arising from non-being.  
Sky radiance binds empty structure,  
Riding the void following nature’s command.  
Sun and moon shine brightly,  
Peaceful, joyous, endless.

Learning immortality ceases worldly thought,  
Thought upon thought accumulates mutually.  
Coming and going disturbs my spirit,  
Spirit restless, none unexperienced.  
Cease thought, stop in void leisure,  
Desolate entering empty stillness.  
Request scripture as hunger and thirst,  
Holding purpose like metal and stone.  
Guard you on the flying mysterious path,  
Five spirits cross talisman register.

Aid me in six perfections’ practice,  
Thus able to dissolve three nets.  
Pure fasting honors Great Essence,  
Breathing out and in nurtures cloud teeth.  
Free and easy within golden towers,  
Jade capital becomes my home.  
Naturally born seven treasures,  
Each person sits on lotus.  
Looking up chewing the mysterious capital’s Nai,  
Looking down holding the empty hollow melon.  
Countenance bright as ten suns,  
Who counts the many kalpas?  
Dharma drum gathers heavenly immortals,  
Ringing bell summons great demons.

Brilliant opening many collars.

This scripture is distant and hard to seek.  
Faith in Tao and feelings incomplete,  
Seeking flight only leads to sinking.  
Most High non-action Tao,  
Promoted in the disciple’s heart.

Learning Tao by elixir faith,  
Serving master as dearest kin.

Diligently following daily new.

Will not finally cross my person.  
Great vow has heavy reward,  
Profound virtue must be thus.

Morning and night planting blessing fields.  
Sowing virtue is like planting trees,  
Roots deep, fruit also abundant.  
If you can immerse in the profound,  
You will float and ascend clear heavens.  
Cultivate this non-action Tao,  
Should tie with good conditions.  
Most High promotes supreme Tao,  
Scripture named Wisdom Chapter.  
Uprooting suffering by great talent,  
Transcending the world to attain truth.  
Spiritual appearance rare in the world,  
Brilliant as lotus in abyss.

People’s conduct each has origin,  
All come from past life merit.  
Establish virtue, take timely measure,  
Vows arise and all follow.  
Good and evil await counterpart,  
Depend on principle, hard to exhaust.  
The worthy uphold law and words,  
Tao and Virtue are in forgetting attachment.  
Understanding is great wisdom,  
Above is Great Ultimate Lord.

Command carriage driving nine dragons.  
Golden flower holding Dong Scripture,  
Presenting incense with all immortals.  
Whistling song through Mysterious Capital,  
Striking jade and knocking jade bell.

Standing tall, soaring Supreme Clarity,  
Transcending radiance fleeing purple sky.  
Guarding unerring method outline,  
Wandering the profound extreme at ease.  
Ten thousand kalpas are like last night,  
A thousand springs like morning.  
Majestic shading cloud blossoms,  
Hands holding precious forest branches.  
Incense and smoke naturally arise,  
Mysterious steps raise soaring winds.  
Spirit banner scatters with the wind,  
Prolific thoughts fade timely.  
Extinguishing wisdom expanding great chaos,  
Non-action is clear song.
