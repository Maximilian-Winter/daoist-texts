# Chapter the Second: Two Drops of Dragon's Tear Falling to Form Wangniang Beach, One Immortal Sword Piercing the Bamboo Dragon's Eye

Now it befell that the spirit of Erlang Shen was suddenly stirred; he had already learned of the transformation of Pinghe into a dragon. Moreover, he perceived a grievance that filled the vast heavens, and reckoned that Pinghe, having suffered wrong at the hands of officials, must surely seek revenge and to clear his hatred. If perchance the dragon-body should turn again, then within two thousand li of Guankou, it could well become a great sea. He hastily commanded the yellow-turbaned strongman guardian spirits, with divine weapons, to speed to the spot and bind the wicked dragon to the deep pool, taking care not to harm its life. The strongmen received the decree and rose aloft in the air.

Just then they beheld the dragon with furious eyes and brows raised, still upon the rooftops of the Ping family’s house, looking down again and again, as if loath to part from the scene. Just as they thought to exert their magic power, there arrived Piao-miao Zhenren, riding on clouds, who smiled and said to the strongmen, “Gentlemen, take no trouble; this humble one has a certain measure of karmic connection with this creature. Pray entrust this matter to me. You may return and report the decree.” The strongmen, seeing it was a true immortal, dared not disobey, and respectfully withdrew.

Piao-miao Zhenren brought the dragon to the water’s surface, repeating words of incantation, and cried out, “Old dragon of the deep, your transformed self has come; why do you not emerge? What more are you waiting for?” When he had spoken, a great wind arose from the sea’s surface. From the deep water there flew up a dragon likewise, but a shadow without form or substance. The two dragons met as old acquaintances; the immortal seized the dragon shadow and struck thrice upon the dragon’s head in mid-air. In an instant, the dragon’s form vanished entirely, and the two dragons became one.

The immortal then commanded, “Henceforth, conceal yourself and cultivate for fifty years, and you may ascend to the Heavenly Court and receive official investiture. Should you commit any violent crime, I will assuredly sever you with my flying sword.” The dragon respectfully received the decree and bowed in thanks. Just as it was about to enter the water, its heart was still unwilling to part from its mother, and it could not but look back thrice, shedding two drops of dragon’s tears. Where the tears fell, there instantly arose a beach. To this day, at Guankou, the site of this beach remains. From ancient times it has been called Wangniang Beach, and thus this tale arose.

But to digress no further, Piao-miao Zhenren having settled one case, mounted his cloud and rose, desiring to return to his hermitage. Scarcely had he risen when a coloured cloud drifted towards him; looking face to face, it was his elder brother, Huo Long Zhenren. The two immortals paused in the clouds and met. Huo Long asked, “Brother, whence come you?” Piao-miao smiled, “Merely to settle that wicked dragon’s matter; now that it is concluded, I would return to my cave on Mount Heng and await your arrival, that we may together submit the decree. And how fares your affair?” Huo Long laughed, “Your affair was the transformation of a dragon; ultimately spiritual and easy to dispatch. Mine is the binding of a dragon—though the sound is alike, the character differs. This small difference entails many more contrivances. At present I am about to go to the Eastern Sea to handle this case.” Piao-miao also laughed, “You should indeed hasten to attend to it! Soon there will be great water calamities in the lower world; a sage of flood control will be born, and the realms of water and land will be clearly divided. That will be the day these two wicked dragons rise. If delayed, and their merits lost, would it not be our fault? How then can we explain ourselves before the Patriarch?” Huo Long laughed heartily, “You rustic fellow, when did you learn such cold speeches? You do well to dispatch your easy matters, and yet dare to talk thus before me! Truly, it is unreasonable!” So both immortals laughed and raised their hands in parting. Huo Long then proceeded southeastwards, straight to the Eastern Sea coast, to attend to his duty.

Now as to the origin of this case, it arose about the same time as the wicked dragon aforesaid. The author, lamenting his own two hands which cannot write both matters at once, could only tell one task and then the other; this also is a matter of necessity. The so-called binding dragon of Huo Long Zhenren dwelt in the Western part of the Eastern Sea, within the Qiantang River. In what is now the central part of Zhejiang Province, there is a shallow waterbar that stretches across the upper and lower reaches of the Qiantang River, which modern folk call the Seven-Li Rapids. The water is shallow and the current swift, making navigation difficult. Sometimes when the wind blows strong, passage is easier; hence there has long been a saying: “With wind, seven li; without wind, seventy.” All river folk and riverside inhabitants know this well. In ancient times, however, it was not called Seven-Li Rapids but伏龙潭, the Hidden Dragon Pool. This name requires no explanation, since it was the haunt of the binding dragon. The name “binding dragon” is but Huo Long Zhenren’s jest; indeed the character for binding is ambiguous, for it is actually a tremendously thick and vast rope of bamboo strips. At that time, the name Hidden Dragon Pool was not yet discovered, nor did the author investigate the earliest name of that pool. In short, this place is the deepest part of the Qiantang River, whence the name pool. In ancient days tools were crude, and boats and rafts imperfect; encountering this deep pool was perilous. They could devise no other method but to link many large boats together, advancing and retreating as one. This increased the strength of the vessels and prevented their being blown away by strong winds; also the greater number of hands made for better mutual care. Such a method, though clumsy, is still used by the raft folk in our enlightened days. The instruments used today to bind boats are mostly iron chains; in former times they were all made of bamboo strip ropes. This is one difference between then and now.

Since the invention of the linked boat system, safety has greatly improved; accidents on the river are no longer frequent. But it cannot be said that danger no longer exists. For example, the bamboo strip cable of the proving dragon, because of several large boats linked together, once encountered a great wind and sank to the bottom of the pool, with all aboard—men and beasts—perishing utterly in a moment. Even the sturdiest bamboo vessels and huge wooden hulls in a few years, exposed to rot and decay, mingle with the mud and soil at the bottom of the pool. Yet when all things have transformed, only that bamboo rope remains. It suddenly becomes free and untrammelled, sometimes floating upon the surface, drifting ten or eight li; sometimes sinking to the bottom, hiding three or five years. After three hundred years, it neither decays nor vanishes; rather it flashes with a shining light, faintly showing colours. This is because the nature of bamboo strips is tougher than ordinary bamboo or wood, and its substance is light, easy to float. It is sometimes tempered by sunlight, sometimes immersed in moonlight; over the years it becomes a kind of reincarnated living being, a spiritual organism. While Heaven and Earth did not intentionally nurture it, it received their natural shaping and became a dragon-body. Its scales, mouth, nose, whiskers, and beard are all complete; only lacking is the cultivation of eyes. Thus, though it rises and falls, living and vivid as a real dragon, it is tormented by its blindness, unable to see the variegated world and myriad beings, blindly moving and groping daily for water creatures to fill its belly. Being a vast and well-cultivated creature, the ordinary fish and shrimp cannot contend with it. Whenever the blind dragon opens its mouth, a great number of creatures are inevitably sent to its belly. Year by year, the creatures slain by it are countless. It is a joy that it has already attained spiritual understanding and good roots, for besides filling itself with fish and shrimp, it has never swallowed boats or harmed people. Yet its immense body, when turning or rolling, unavoidably stirs waves and wind. Sometimes, owing to its blindness, it cannot see the people of the world; encountering boats passing by, its brief appearance is enough to terrify humans. This is a matter beyond remedy. Though the blind dragon has no mind to do harm, many have suffered at its hand.

It is unknown in what era or year, but Huo Long Zhenren once journeyed by boat with two upright ministers in office; they chanced upon this dragon’s appearance, and immediately the sky darkened, the sun and moon lost their light, and the immortal’s boat was tossed. The immortal, angry, cried, “What wicked beast is this, daring to make mischief here?” He summoned the local earth gods to inquire. The earth gods related the true situation and the dragon’s origin and nature. The immortal laughed, “A mere rope dares to be so rude!” The ministers then asked, “Is there a way to subdue it?” The immortal nodded, “A tiny creature like this is no match for my sword! Only it is a pity it has cultivated many years and done no great harm, so I cannot bear to destroy it.” The ministers all said, “Such a creature has what good heart? Now it has no eyes and cannot do harm; but when it has eyes it will be like a tiger with wings, how can ordinary men withstand it? Even if the master were to try to subdue it then, it would not be as easy as now.” The immortal sighed, “The crimes are not yet manifest, the evil fruits not yet apparent; how can I rashly slaughter it?” The minister most concerned for the people, hearing this, could not let it go, and quickly said, “Master immortal, if you will not slay it, we two are high officials of the court, and should remove this harm for the people. Pray lend us your precious sword to use; if there be heavenly fault, we will bear the blame ourselves, and it will not concern you. What say you?” The immortal smiled, “You gentlemen serve the state and people; there is no great fault therein. Since you say so, I will lend you my sword.” With that he produced a sword about an inch long. Shaking it in the wind, it divided into two, and he pointed, saying, “This is the female sword, and this the male. The earth gods say this dragon has formed a female body, and only the female sword can cut it; gentlemen must take care not to err.” The ministers took both swords in their hands, examining them carefully. Though only about an inch in length, they shone with flashing brilliance, cold air pressing fiercely. Looking closely, one could not help but shiver. Smiling, they said, “The dragon is great, the sword small; can it be effective?” The immortal laughed heartily, “Gentlemen, do not slight this sword. I learned the Heavenly Flight Sword Art from the Primordial Lady, and this sword has been tempered three thousand years. It can be large or small, visible or hidden, as you will. When not in use, it can be reduced to the smallest size conceivable, or enlarged as needed. Now that it must be used, if you wish it longer, it grows; if shorter, it shortens. When cast like an arrow, it is swift as the wind. Its point reaches ten thousand li without being distant, a hundred paces without being near. It is truly a wondrous treasure of the immortals, not to be compared with the coarse iron wrought by worldly fire.”

The ministers were much pleased and sought the blind dragon’s location. Suddenly the dragon turned again, the boat shook greatly. The immortal sat at the stern with unchanged countenance, pointing to where the dragon’s head was. The sword-wielding minister was already bewildered and forgetful of the immortal’s instructions. He stretched out his hand and cast the male sword. A blue light sped toward the dragon’s head. The immortal cried, “Wrong! Wrong! Why use the male sword?” Before he finished, the sword returned to the minister’s hand. In a moment the wind and waves grew greater, a huge dragon’s head broke the water’s surface. Amidst swirling mist it nodded repeatedly to the immortal and party a dozen times, then gently turned and gradually sank into the distance, unseen again.

This frightened the two ministers into confusion, their minds disordered; for a long time they could not speak. The immortal sighed, “What is decreed by fate, man’s power cannot change. This creature has concealed itself in the water and cultivated many years; by means of a rope it has reached such a degree, yet has developed good roots and dares not behave badly; this is a rare matter, worthy of Heaven’s favour. Though it has small appetites, it is all excusable. Just now I would not destroy it, from compassion for life and a yearning for the Way; it is not like the petty kindness and righteousness of mankind. But you two gentlemen would not listen, insisting on removing the harm for the people. Who knew in your haste you confused male and female, misused my sword, and by harming it, did so out of love; by killing it, you preserved it. This creature’s body is perfect save for lacking eyes; to form eyes would require at least five hundred years’ cultivation. Now with this sword’s single thrust, two holes were pierced, just enough to become a pair of eyes. Is it not as if you gentlemen have completed its five hundred years of hard work?” The ministers, hearing this, looked at one another, at a loss for words. The immortal took back his sword and joined the two halves into one. Meanwhile the waves calmed, the wind stilled, and the sun stood at noon, the hottest and brightest hour.

The immortal held the sword to the sunlight and laughed, “This creature is truly hateful; I perfected it, yet it has soiled my treasure!” Saying this, he blew toward the sun, and the sword emitted a ten-thousand-fold golden light, dazzling the eyes. Looking again, the immortal was left with empty hands, and no one knew where the treasure sword had been concealed. The ministers recovered their wits and asked, “Master, how do you know this sword gave it two eyes? One strike must naturally make only one eye; how then are there two holes?” The immortal laughed, “Yin and yang respond and give birth to myriad things. When two yins or two yangs meet, often harm results. This creature having formed a female body, you gentlemen used the yang sword to pierce it; the yang qi arriving at the point of contact causes response and growth. Your sword just struck its forehead; is this not the making of the two eyes not yet fully formed? Moreover, when a sword pierces a body, it often passes through, entering one side and exiting the other; entrance and exit make two holes. All this was decreed by fate, and so a fortunate coincidence occurred. It seems this creature’s life was not to be cut off, but to enjoy future blessing. Even our meeting here today seems specially arranged to give it eyes pierced by the sword; is it not strange?”

The ministers said, “If so, then if it should harm the world and people in future, the fault will be ours! Master, please exert divine arts to cut it down early, lest it poison the world and increase our guilt.” The immortal laughed, “No need; did you not see the dragon nod repeatedly when it entered the water? That was profound gratitude and sincere reverence. Since we have received its worship, how can we hate it without cause? Besides, this creature is of humble origin, yet has such fierce nature and good fortune; it is clearly not one given to wrongdoing. The future need not be feared. To speak arrogantly, if this creature, when fully formed, should behave violently, then we too shall not escape punishment. Fate having brought us to this point, no escape is possible. When the time comes, we shall reason it out. We must not harm it when it is single-mindedly cultivating the Way, nor yet complete it and then harm it. Such reversal is not fitting for immortals. Know that to oppose Heaven brings misfortune; to act against reason brings disaster. Disaster will come to the doer. It is not that I fear this trivial creature and dare not contend with it.” The two ministers were silent. The immortal added, “Though so, to prevent it from doing harm and encourage progress, I may exert a slight magic power, that it may know warning and feel admonition; this will not be without benefit to it.”

Thus saying, he stretched out his hand to the water’s depths. The great dragon slowly rose again, cautious and reserved, yet still causing the water to rock like waves. It raised its head and nodded in salutation to the immortal. The immortal, with serious countenance, commanded, “You are a bamboo rope, having formed a dragon body, and by my sword have gained eyes, saving much cultivation. Your fortune is not shallow. Henceforth you must redouble your diligence, be neither idle nor remiss, and do no more harm to living things or travellers. Your eyes are now formed; in three months’ time they will shine fully, and as they are opened by my immortal sword, their radiance will be unlike others. Near or far, you shall see with great acuity; near as to discern the smallest speck, far as to reach a thousand li. This is a rare chance, hard to meet and seek. If you grow complacent and fail to advance, how lamentable! Not only will your proper fruit be delayed, but you will incur Heaven’s displeasure, betraying your years of cultivation. If you rely on petty skill to do evil, your life will be difficult to preserve; after death you will be cast into the nine hells, with no hope of ascent! Now to encourage you and aid you on the Way, within a hundred li of here I have set a great sword gate. Not only you, but all living beings who cultivate the Way in this river must pass through this gate to leave the world behind and ascend to the immortal realm. Should they fail to pass, they may not lightly attempt it. The gate’s cover leaves only a slit, as fine as a rope; unless one can reduce the body to finer than a silken thread, it is impossible to pass. Moreover, if one touches the gate, the cover will suddenly close, and head and body shall be severed. This is the most dangerous and fearsome pass. It is not that I wish to make things hard for you; first, to show the difficulty of attaining the Way and thus the preciousness of success; second, that those not yet accomplished may not be self-satisfied but remain reverent; third, that with this magic power they become no different from immortals, and after true success shall not be lightly scorned. What think you of this method?” The dragon bowed repeatedly, showing great submission. The immortal cried, “Go!” The dragon nodded several times again and swiftly departed. The immortal having done this, bade farewell to the ministers and returned to his hermitage.

The immortals’ day and month are unlike mortal reckoning. In the blink of an eye seventy or eighty years passed until that was the time when Piao-miao Zhenren at Guankou enlightened Pinghe and fulfilled the old dragon. Piao-miao and Huo Long Zhenren were both disciples of the Patriarch Laozi. Their perfecting of the two dragons was originally unintended, yet the Patriarch knew early on, and calculated that the eastern and western dragons should be completed under these two immortals. After completion, great circumstances ensued. He instructed them to hasten to reap the fruit of the causes they had sown. All creatures who become immortals must first transform into human form. Piao-miao having used the method of uniting two souls completed the old dragon at Guankou. Huo Long must also devise means to have that bamboo rope dragon pass through a human belly. Thus bidding farewell to Piao-miao, he hastened on clouds to the Seven-Li Rapids.

Knowing that the bamboo dragon had opened its eyes, it had cultivated steadily for seventy or eighty years. At first it could not avoid eating some creatures to fill its belly; later it learned the art of evading hunger by the Way’s energy, daily seeking only water reeds to swallow, finding no hunger, and cultivating its body to be able to grow large or small, thick or thin, truly becoming a dragon enlightened and transcendent. How could Huo Long not be pleased? He used the Dragon Summoning Spell to call it to the water’s surface. The dragon, seeing the immortal, seemed both sorrowful and joyful, coiling its body into a great circle, embracing the immortal, and nodding its head repeatedly before him. The immortal could not but praise it and led it to pass through the dragon gate.

The dragon indeed transformed into a body as fine as hair and short as an earthworm, trembling as it darted through the dragon gate’s middle. The gate was a device set by immortals; if any creature passed, the two blades above and below would suddenly close. One heard the dragon’s roar from the water, and the mountains and valleys on both sides trembled together.

Whether this dragon’s life will prosper or decline, we shall see in the next chapter.
