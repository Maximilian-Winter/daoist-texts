# Chapter 4: Bearing False Reproach Without a Husband, Distinguishing Mind and Deeds, The Maiden Casts Herself into the River

Now it happened that Xiuchun, hearing her mother speak thus, was smitten with a sudden grief, and tears fell like rain. From that day forth she ceased to smile or speak, and took but little food or drink. Daily she knit her brows, and on her forehead appeared line upon line of wrinkles. Such was her condition, that it was plain she harboured some great secret sorrow, too deep to be uttered. Months passed, and her body became more and more emaciated, her spirit quite extinguished. Though living in the world and outwardly like other folk, she was bereft of soul and spirit, joyless and dispirited; so that even strangers who saw her would be moved to pity. At this time her parents perceived her strange state, and the husband and wife together strove to comfort and counsel her with all their might. But Xiuchun neither revealed her grief nor the cause of her illness; whether they urged her by this way or that, she only made a show of obedience, saying “I will obey,” yet her mind was unchanged, and her sickness remained as before.

Moreover, misfortunes rarely come singly. Because of Xiuchun’s illness, the household lost all interest in life; and in that year a pestilence raged, so that the village lay strewn with the dead. Xiuchun’s parents passed away one after another in that time. Xiuchun and her child could do naught but weep and mourn, and buy coffins and prepare burial. When the funeral rites were done, Xiuchun suddenly called to Feilong, saying, “My son, dost thou know that thy mother was never married? Dost thou know whence thy body came?” She pursued, “Why did thy mother not wed? Since she did not wed, why then did she bear thee? And why did she rear thee to this age?”

Feilong, hearing the talk of schoolfellows who insulted and mocked, longed indeed to inquire after his origins and the story of his mother’s bearing him without wedlock. But the villagers were curious and fond of marvellous tales. What was simply unremarkable was embroidered into strange and wondrous forms in their mouths; and were there indeed anything remarkable, they would add branches and leaves, many a detail, often so that the truth and the matter were as mismatched as ass’s lips and horse’s teeth, and the story ran far afield. Zhang Jia would say it thus, and Li Yi thus — between them they made Feilong’s story like a play, “Better not to ask at all; ask and thou art the more confounded.” He dared not question his birth mother nor the two great ancestors, but kept it buried in his heart, hoping some day to find the chance to ask. If his mother indeed had no fault, yet was truly pregnant without wedlock, he must find out which schoolfellow had thus insulted her, and bring stern dealings to bear, to win back her reputation for chastity, to restore his own lost dignity. These thoughts were hidden in his heart, unseen by others. When his mother suddenly asked about this matter, he hastened to kneel, striking the ground with his head and shedding tears, saying, “Mother, why dost thou ask this today? Had I known the truth before, I had already found a way to save thee from days of sorrow and tears.”

Feilong’s words were fitting and proper. They did not cause his mother to lose standing, and they fully revealed the secret grievance he had long wished to understand but dared not speak. His mother, hearing these words, could not but burst forth into loud lamentation, allowing her beloved daughter to kneel before her, yet made no attempt to restrain her, but said mournfully, “Ignorant child, thou knowest not whence thy body came! How then could I, thy mother, know?” Saying this, she choked with sobs, yet still let Feilong kneel on the ground. Seeing this, Feilong dared not rise, nor utter a word. After a while, his mother withdrew a piece of paper from her pouch, flinging it before her, and cried aloud: “If thou wouldst know the story of thy birth, all is in this paper. Had I not borne thee, this wicked child, I would not have had to suffer so many idle rumours and endless injustice in this world! If I do not give thee an explanation now, I fear thou shalt live in vain among men, and I, as thy mother, shall suffer unbearable wrongs. Now since my parents have gone hence, my duty to them is fulfilled; my duty to thee I must also discharge. Henceforth, thou mayest be a person pure and innocent; and I, as mother, may early end my debt of sin, and suffer no more in this world.”

So saying, she turned and, with sleeves drawn, went back to her chamber. Feilong held the paper in both hands, kneeling to read carefully. Now he understood his origin, and the reason his mother had conceived without wedlock, and the bitter years of hardship and slander she had endured. At the end were words of farewell, and from his mother’s tone it appeared she had resolved to die to show her resolve. At first he was so absorbed he noted not her movements; but when he had finished reading, his heart was full of sorrow and pain, tears fell in drops upon the paper. Lifting his head, he found his mother was no longer seated there, and he knew not when she had departed. Feilong was greatly disturbed, his grief was deep and extraordinary; even the tears he had shed seemed to shrink within him. He was sure his mother’s departure portended ill. Hastening in three steps and two strides, he sought her; but found no trace. Frantic, he searched about house and yard, but she was nowhere to be seen. Then he reasoned that she could not have gone far in so brief a time; if she had cast herself into the river, she could not have been drowned in so short a moment. Therefore he hurried to the riverbank to look, and there he found lying a letter, addressed: “To my son Feilong, personally.” Feilong, regardless of life or death, tore it open, and read:

“If I had died early, thou couldst not have been born; if I do not die, thou canst never be a man. Years ago, I conceived thee here at this very riverbank; today I part from thee at this same place. If we cannot stay apart, come here first and call my spirit. In a day or two, my body will float up; bury me on the high mountain. Our family is poor, with nothing to change; I recall the immortal’s earnest counsel: if in urgent need, seek help from thy stubborn shell. For many years I served thy grandparents and reared thee with hardship and bitterness, yet the worst is past. Having no urgent need, I have not sought help. Now I know it is difficult; I tell thee thus: thy stubborn shell lies in the rice bin behind my bed. Thou hast the root of immortality, and shalt become a great vessel. I, but a woman, have little knowledge, and cannot teach thee; thou must strive of thyself. Thy mother Xiuchun’s last words.”

Feilong gazed upon the mighty waters, the waves still, the silence profound. Only the crowd of curious folk thronged the riverbank. Having read the farewell letter, Feilong burst into loud lamentations and swooned; neighbors helped him back to the house. When he recovered, he sought his mother’s body; neighbors and friends armed with tools followed him to the riverside to search. Some measured the depth with ropes; some probed the waters with poles; others skilled in swimming circled the place, seeking any sign of the body. Yet all their efforts were fruitless. Feilong wept aloud, then suddenly plunged into the water to search with his own hands. The crowd cried out, “Dragon maiden, do not go! Thou canst not swim; art thou not afraid to drown?” But Feilong was truly the incarnation of a dragon: though in human form, his nature was unchanged. Entering the water, he felt no distress but a refreshing ease, more pleasant than on land. His eyes were clear; even at the greatest depths, he could see every blade of grass and insect. He dived to the bottom, searching everywhere; the onlookers shook their heads and sighed, saying, “What a filial child! Yet this may cost her life!”

As they watched helplessly, unable to save him, suddenly the water’s surface rose in waves, mingled with white foam. Then countless fish, shrimp, turtles, and tortoises fled like flying arrows downstream. For the dragon is king of the water creatures; Feilong’s entrance sent them fleeing in fear. While the people marveled, Feilong appeared, bearing a corpse, and swam to the shore. The crowd rejoiced, saying, “Surely a filial daughter is guarded by spirits! She who knew no skill in water has found her mother’s body beneath the waves — is this not miraculous aid?” As they spoke, they helped raise the body. Feilong climbed ashore and lay upon it, weeping without cease.

They sought to restrain him, and helped carry the body. Yet beneath the corpse was tied a great weight — a large stone. They understood then the mother’s resolve to die; fearing her body might float, she had bound herself with stone to sink easily. They sighed, “We did not guess this sister’s fierce courage.” Hastily they removed the stone. Seven or eight bore the burden on their shoulders and carried the body home, where a coffin was bought for burial. Feilong showed the farewell letter to all, then led them to the rice bin behind her mother’s bed. There they found a shining round orb, cracked with seven holes. Some neighbors knew its nature and had seen such before, and they said, “Indeed! The immortal, before departing, gave this charge; and since the mother’s last words, Dragon maiden may silently recite and sincerely ask for the immortal’s aid; surely it will be fulfilled.” As they spoke eagerly, they turned to see Feilong, whose gaze was fixed upon the orb as if entranced; none knew his thoughts. The crowd nudged him to rouse him, and he smiled, saying, “This is my own possession; there is no need to ask for help.”

Then, stretching a finger to the orb’s fissure, the hole widened to admit a hand. Feilong put in his hand, and brought forth a bar of silver; reaching further, he found mourning clothes, incense, candles, shoes, caps, and other funeral implements. Save for the coffin, which must be bought with silver, all was here provided. The people marvelled and exclaimed that henceforth Dragon maiden need fear not poverty; with these rare treasures, building a prince’s palace would be easy.

By this time Feilong had some understanding of the Way, and heard such words without joy. He bade them quickly buy a coffin, and prepared his mother’s body for burial. The coffin was placed in the main hall, where he watched by night and day, offering sacrifices and weeping at every meal. After seven days, before the spirit tablet, Feilong prayed: “I shall avenge my mother, and seek out her enemies. Mother’s shade is near; I pray she will look after me.” Having prayed, he reached into the orb and took out a sharp blade. Going forth, he hastened to the home of the schoolfellows who had slandered his mother, declaring vengeance.

But the house belonged to wealthy folk. Hearing that Xiuchun had cast herself into the river, and that Feilong vowed to stab the offenders, they had prepared beforehand, hiring two warriors at great cost, who followed Feilong’s every step. Hearing of his coming, they were bid to engage him in combat. Pitiful Feilong, though possessed of innate root, had no martial training in this life; driven only by filial piety, he came on without fear. As to true skill, he could not contend with the two. After a brief struggle, he was wounded in two places. Fortunately, one warrior had some conscience and would not strike with full cruelty. Seeing Feilong already hurt, he bade his companion desist, saying, “We are paid to ensure he fares no worse than others. This young sister is truly a wronged child; we must not harm her. To harm her would bring Heaven’s punishment.” The man counselled Feilong kindly, concealed this from his master, and sent him home, giving him medicine for his wounds. When the master learned this, he rebuked the warriors, dismissed them, and hired others to guard him.

Feilong returned home, casting himself upon the coffin, weeping day and night. Overcome with grief, he grew faint and fell beside the coffin as if in a dream. Suddenly a voice called in the room: “Hu Feilong, thy teacher is come; rise and welcome the holy presence.” Feilong, thinking of praying for a master to teach him martial arts, to strike again, opened his eyes. The room was full of incense smoke, with four boys, eight youths in green, sixteen yellow-clad warriors. There was immortal music, melodious and wonderful. All surrounded a celestial being, holding a jewel sword, standing on a lotus; his bearing was solemn. Feilong remembered vaguely having met this immortal before, but could not recall. He disregarded this and prostrated himself at the immortal’s feet, head bleeding, weeping aloud: “Immortal Master, save me! Master, save me!” The immortal bade him rise, smiling, and asked: “Where didst thou see me come from? Canst thou remember?” Feilong pondered long, but answered not.

The immortal sighed softly, saying, “Since we parted not long ago, whence comes this demon hindrance?” Then he bade a boy bring a small round mirror, bidding Feilong look therein. Feilong bowed trembling, took the mirror, and gazed. He saw the shipwreck at Qili Pond, the drowning of men, beasts, and goods; only a single bamboo rope remaining. He saw the cultivation to become a dragon, until the Fire Dragon True Man sent him to be reborn, and changed him into a Daoist maiden to attend his birth, taking the pearl from his mouth. All was displayed clearly. Feilong saw the vision, suddenly enlightened, and worshipped repeatedly. The True Man spat forth an object and cried: “Still hankerest after this trifle? Take it back.” Feilong saw a smooth round bead, the size of a green bean, a most excellent spirit pearl. Understanding it to be the elixir cultivated in his former life, he hastily took it in hand and put it into his mouth, swallowing with a “wah” sound.

The True Man commanded, “Go look again for thy stubborn shell; where is it?” Feilong searched and found the great orb was gone. He returned to report, lost in thought. The True Man snapped, “Now thou hast the real thing, why hanker after the false?” Feilong’s mind was cleared indeed. The True Man rejoiced, saying, “From this time thy work is accomplished; thou shalt roam freely between the mortal and immortal worlds. Soon shalt thou receive the Jade Emperor’s decree, and be joined in marriage to the Old Dragon of the West, co-heirs and begetting offspring, ruling the four seas. I fear thy magic is yet slight, and thou mayst bring mockery from the immortals. Therefore I first impart to thee the arts of the Five Elements’ flight, the thirty-six transformations, and the methods to summon spirits, dispatch generals, and drive away demons and monsters. Thou shalt go in and out of darkness, ascend heaven and descend earth, traverse the four great continents, visit the three mountains and five peaks, and roam at will unimpeded. When thou dost receive the imperial commission, I will again guide thee to pay homage to the Jade Emperor, the Primordial, the Venerable Lord, and the great golden immortals; also to thy master uncle, the Profound True Man, who is the teacher of the Old Dragon of the West. He now imparts many arts to the Old Dragon; in future ye shall be spouses. If thy skill be wanting, thou shalt not match him, nor uphold my own face before thy master uncle. Therefore thou must practice diligently, applying thy mind to thy studies, not disappointing my care and hope.”

Feilong bowed and said, “Disciple receives the grace of Heaven and Earth, the virtue of rebirth; how dare I neglect diligent study, and disappoint the master’s fulfilment?” The Fire Dragon True Man smiled, saying, “Thou knowest well. Our meeting is by fate, not thanks or favour. In brief, to love me is to love thyself; the greatest love is self-love, the greatest respect is self-respect. If thou canst understand this, I have no fear.” Feilong bowed to accept the teaching. The True Man sat down, closing his eyes in silence; the attendants were quiet. That night, in the surrounding hundred li, each household beheld above the Hu family’s house five-coloured clouds descending from the sky into the chamber, and a strange fragrance breathed in the nostrils, refreshing the spirit and invigorating the mind.

The nearby villagers knew the Hu child was an immortal descended, and many strange tales spread, yet they were little amazed. Only the more distant folk, strangers with no ties, marvelled greatly at these signs, and held much discussion. Some zealots journeyed far to see for themselves; some seeking immortals and the Way, believing such auspicious clouds and light must betoken divine descent, and so came in hopes of salvation. Within one night, several hundreds gathered from all sides, making a clamour till near the fifth watch. All saw the coloured clouds and incense from the Hu residence, peering through door cracks, climbing branches to glimpse inside.

Most strange was that each beheld a different sight. Some said they saw the immortal teacher discoursing, disciples sitting in order to listen; others said the chamber was silent, but in the courtyard were many lions, elephants, tigers, and leopards patrolling as guards; others again said they beheld a great dragon crouching at the immortal’s feet, hearing the teaching. Such was the variety of reports. In truth all were right; but differing roots and karmic connections caused some to see nearer or farther, some within or without.

If thou wouldst know what arts the True Man wrought that night, and how Feilong received his teaching, await the next chapter for full account.
