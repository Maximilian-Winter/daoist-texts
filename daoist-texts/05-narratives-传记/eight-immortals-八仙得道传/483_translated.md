# Chapter 15: The Thousand-Year-Old Fox Expounds Cause and Effect; The Young Noble Severeth Worldly Bonds

It is related that the immortals Sun Xianci and his wife journeyed together until midway on the road, where both suddenly met their deaths. The band of men escorting them were one and all distraught, at their wit’s end. Suddenly a furious wind arose, sweeping in all directions; in an instant the heavens darkened and the earth blackened, the sunlight vanished; the streets were filled with flying sand and stones, smoke and mist enveloped the air. The travellers upon the road could not discern each other. The escort of the Bo family sought a place to take shelter, and for the time abandoned the two lifeless bodies within their carriage. After the passing of an hour or so, the wind abated somewhat, the clouds dispersed and the sky cleared; all hastened to the carriage to look upon the two dead. Yet, strange indeed, only an empty vehicle remained; where were the bodies?

This sight so terrified the onlookers that it was more grievous than before. They had no choice but to seize men of the locality as witnesses and then disperse in different directions to report to the Bo and Sun households. The lady of the Bo household had lost her beloved husband and daughter, and her grief was needless to speak of. As for Sun Jie and his wife, though stirred to bitter hatred by the slanders of Jiao’er toward the immortals Xianci and his spouse, upon hearing of their demise on the road and the disappearance of their corpses, the natural affection of father and son moved Sun Jie to weep for a time. Luo Yuan also wept bitterly. Only Jiao’er was quite contented, saying, “Mother need not grieve. Their manner of death shows the unerring course of Heaven, and only reveals the malice of their hearts the more! Otherwise, why should one die and the other perish likewise? After death, not even their bones return home! Such unfilial persons, death is a fitting end! If their parents grieve, it is most perverse!” The old couple, hearing these words, also thought there was much truth therein; after shedding tears a while, they ceased.

Leaving this matter, we now relate Sun Xianci’s death by poison. His wandering ghost, dim and confused, was borne upon the wind, drifting over many places unknown. Suddenly a voice called out, “Where is the wandering soul of Sun Xianci?” The spirit was greatly startled, and, regaining composure, perceived before him a woman attired as a Taoist nun, holding a jade tablet, smiling kindly as she touched him lightly and said, “Old friend, art thou well? Dost thou yet remember Sister Hu Sanjie?”

The ghost of Xianci was pleased at this, and no longer timid. He said, “Sister Sanjie, whence comest thou? Why hast thou not visited my home for so long? Now your disciple has suffered betrayal at the hands of a brother, died unjustly, fulfilling thy former words. Since thou hast met thy disciple here, I humbly beseech thy great mercy to aid me!” Sanjie smiled and said, “If not to save thee, why else should I be here? Enough words—follow me quickly. I will take thee to a good place, and there relate the cause and effect within.”

Xianci, half joyful and half sorrowful, unconsciously followed Sister Sanjie. His body was as a leaf blown by the wind, light and powerless to command itself; fortunate was it that he clung close to Sanjie, lest he be carried elsewhere. Presently they arrived upon a mountain peak, where three stone chambers stood. Sanjie entered, and Xianci followed, bowing to her and saying, “Your disciple hath been foolish and ignorant, daily in the presence of the revered master yet never knowing to pay reverence and submit. Now, as a wandering soul, homeless throughout the four seas, I earnestly implore Sister Sanjie, recalling our years together, to graciously accept me, to enroll me among your ranks, which would be my great fortune!” Sanjie laughed and said, “Nay, nay! Young sir, thou needst not such humility. Pray be seated, and I will unfold unto thee the cause and effect. Dost thou know who I am?”

Xianci sat down, bewildered, pondering what to say. Sanjie sighed: “Young sir, thou art truly a man of rare cleverness, yet at times art dull of understanding. I am not thy kinswoman, yet have great employment concerning thy many affairs. Recall the words thy master Wenmei the Perfect Man gave in the Imperial Garden; then thou wilt know the relation 'twixt thee and me. Not by direct affinity, but by command I come, having charge of all matters.” Xianci suddenly understood: “So then Sister Sanjie is sent by my master to watch over thy disciple? Is it so?” Sanjie smiled: “Dost thou only now perceive? I am the ancient fox of the western hills. Long ago I strayed upon the wrong path, committing many misdeeds, suffering twice the calamity of thunder and fire. Later, by the grace of the master Wenmei, I was spared the dreadful fate. Before him I swore solemnly, and from thence washed away my former ways, devoutly cultivating the Great Way, humbly soliciting to be enrolled among his disciples. Yet the master, fearing my evil nature was not changed, and that old habits might bring further lawlessness and thus implicate him, hesitated long before consenting. At length, unable to resist my entreaties, he allowed me within a hundred years to serve in errands and missions, performing small tasks. If I proved earnest and free of fault, then he would receive me as a true disciple. My first commission was to be sent to thee, to guide and watch over thee at all times. Half was to test thee; if thou wert to falter or transgress, I would report back, and the master would smite thee with a flying sword or smite thee by thunder and fire!”

When Sanjie spoke thus, Xianci shuddered and reverently said, “Fortunate that I have not changed my heart; had I fallen into thy snare, I should not now see my master, nor even thyself!” Sanjie laughed heartily and continued, “After repeated trials and tests, I was convinced thou wert truly earnest, single-minded, and free from all distracting thoughts. Therefore I taught thee many important incantations, and revealed to thee some of thy fate, hoping thou wouldst strive with vigour, undaunted by peril, unyielding.” Hearing this, Xianci arose and performed eight profound bows, thanking his master and then Sanjie. Sanjie, smiling, fled from the homage, saying, “I dare not accept! Though thou hast my guidance, I also gain some merit by thy good deeds, to report to the master. If thou art so ceremonious, I must thank thee for granting success.”

Having thus spoken, Sanjie sat with Xianci and asked, “Dost thou know why thy younger brother hath so opposed thee?” Xianci was perplexed and said, “Indeed, I have not been indifferent to my brother; I know not why he is so jealous.” Sanjie sighed: “This is what I mean by cause and effect. Dost thou know of what spirit thy brother is the reincarnation?”

Xianci pondered long, then suddenly stamped his foot and said, “Ah! I understand! No wonder when my mother was about to give birth, she dreamed of a great beast neither dragon nor flood-dragon that came into her embrace, bearing a son. My father said that by the form in the dream, if not a flood-dragon, then a sea flood-dragon; hence the name Jiao’er. Alas, we were all too foolish. Though we heard of the strange dream and my father by chance took this name, plainly pointing to this cause and effect, I could not think of it at all—was it not strange?”

Sanjie laughed: “If men’s wit could comprehend all, it would no longer be the course of Heaven.” Xianci was silent a long while, and said, “If so, my brother was not born to be a scion of the Sun family, but solely to revenge! But after his revenge, will he repent and serve my parents with filial duty?” At these words tears fell from his eyes.

Sanjie smiled coldly and said, “What good is such a thing? Thou art a man of benevolence and filial piety, still mindful of thy parents despite such injustice. This alone is merit beyond many. But thy father and mother were indeed foolish in nature. Now, having believed thy brother’s words, they have suffered death at his hand; ere long they too shall suffer loss by him. There will be no happy end! The time is not far; wait and see!” Xianci wept, saying, “If so, my parents, who laboured half their lives, have not only left their line vain but their end is wrought by their son’s hand. Is it not most lamentable? Sister Sanjie, since thou art sent by the master to rescue thy disciple, canst thou not, for my sake, also rescue my parents? I should be boundlessly grateful!”

Sanjie spat and laughed, “Thou speakest foolishly again. Fate is fixed; how may man turn it? Thy parents have such a worthy son as thee; how is it that their line is light and vain? Dost thou think that because thou hast left home and cannot procreate, the progeny is ended? The reason man needs descendants is to transmit his blood and name after death. If one might live forever, as long as Heaven and Earth, what need of children? The worth of life is to become immortal and attain the Tao.”

Xianci said, “My father was a man well known for goodness; my mother, though of strange birth, never did evil, always aiding my father in good works. How then comes this calamity?”

Sanjie replied, “This is hard to say. According to the law of cause and effect, often many lives combine to produce one destiny; men judge the present by the past life’s deeds, and so err greatly. Thy parents are good in this life, but know not the nature of their former existences. Leaving thy father aside, as to thy mother: I know that as a snail spirit she killed countless creatures, ensnared young men to draw vital Yang, replenishing essence. Luckily she attained some magic to transform and assume human or other forms, hence her acts of extraction. Yet such harm to others for self-gain is not permitted by Heaven! If such deeds could make one immortal, the gods of Heaven would be the very abyss of evil. When I became human, my actions were similar; twice did I suffer thunder calamities, a sure punishment from Heaven. Law is law, Tao is Tao. When law is fulfilled but Tao not followed, the result is that one harms others before harming oneself. My evil was not great; by the master’s mercy I escaped death to renounce evil and turn to right. How could thy mother, skilled in magic and transformations, fall to vulgar men and nearly lose her life? Truly this is Heaven’s way of punishment, using men as instruments. Fortunate was it that thy father and mother were benevolent and filial, as I was fortunate in meeting the master and escaping endless calamity. Thy mother ought to have awakened quickly, cultivating the Way and meriting to atone her faults. Yet for decades she has been but a woman of no merit, doing no good for others, never cultivating the Way nor keeping a day’s fast. Recently she trusted a worthless son and poisoned a good one. Though thou hast no hatred, the lord of justice in Heaven has deemed this a great crime, and will surely punish her in due course. Such is the way of cause and effect, deep and obscure, beyond human ken; its principles subtle and unforeseen. Judging by outward deeds alone, how can one be sure?”

Xianci, hearing that his mother suffered partly for his sake, was filled with shame and grief, and called out in anguish. Sanjie sighed: “Young sir, thou art a true filial and good man; no wonder the master treasures thee. The master knew of these events and the future; he said thy mother must still rely on thee for salvation, and thou shalt have opportunity to repay her. Now thou must labour diligently, cultivating the Tao; all else thou must not trouble thy mind about. Even the matter of thy parents springs from thy filial piety; since the outcome is revealed, thou must let go and devote thyself to thy proper course. If thou livest as before, daily worrying and following, why didst thou become a recluse? The master also said thy hope is great, yet many tribulations lie ahead. This life differs from the last, when thou passed from beast to man; now from man to immortal. The higher thy station, the more arduous thy cultivation; the greater thy future attainment. Know this well; strive earnestly, and be not burdened by worldly dust, that thou mayest fulfill the master’s hope.”

Xianci bowed and accepted instruction. Suddenly he recalled his wife, and smiling said to Sanjie, “I am not covetous of conjugal affection; yet this woman is virtuous, and I have had instruction from thee before, deeming her a promising talent. Now I know not if she can return home, or if in future I may beg thee to instruct her more in cultivation, that she too may attain some measure; then thy favour would not be in vain.”

Sanjie laughed loudly, “Thou wert praised, yet now art obstinate! Clearly thou canst not give up thy wife, yet lay this burden upon me. I will not meddle, nor hope to bring success! If thou lovest Yu Cheng, when thou hast attained immortality and the Tao, thou must thyself save her!”

Xianci knew Sanjie’s nature was playful, and laughed, begging, “Sister Sanjie, be not so perverse! How couldst thou be so compassionate and fail to complete thy virtue? My request is but a thought; no wonder thou art displeased. Now I dare not ask thee further, but pray tell me but a word of her present condition.” Sanjie smiled and told him that Huigu had died. Upon hearing this, Xianci again wept torrents of tears, sobbing aloud and crying, “I have harmed her! I have harmed her!”

Sanjie stood by, gazing at him until he ceased weeping, then burst into wild laughter, holding up a finger to Xianci: “Truly a man of deep feeling and loyalty! Seeing thee so pitiable, I will take some responsibility and return to heal her, and bring her here, still as thy wife. How sayest thou?”

Xianci, abashed by this jest, blushed to his ears, and the tears and snot that had just flowed were swallowed in fear; he dared not speak, but stared at Sanjie in dumb amazement. Seeing his honest nature, Sanjie forbore to mock him further, and said: “The young lady of the Bo family is a person of character and disposition rare among mortals and also of excellent immortal rank; her attainment will be no less than thine. Now another junior sister of thine has been sent to save her and take her as disciple. In her former life she was a flower attendant in the Jade Emperor’s palace; because of the Jade Emperor’s long life the assembly of immortals celebrated, but for some reason quarreled with an incense official, offending the Emperor’s will, and both were banished for ten generations. Through ten reincarnations, if she does not lose her true nature, she may return to the Heavenly Office and receive promotion and reward. As to her relation with thee, when descending to the mortal world thou didst chance upon her coming from the underworld; thy adversary the old flood-dragon, knowing thy descent, went before to spy upon thee. Because she was fair, the old flood-dragon mocked her; she was distressed when thou didst arrive, roused to righteous anger, and with the aid of underworld guards drove off the flood-dragon, rescuing her. She was very grateful and vowed to repay thee; thus this kinship was established. This is no chance matter. Now she hath repaid her debt and thou hast fulfilled thy part; this old account is closed. Henceforth thou needst not ensnare her, lest thou bring thine own demonic hindrance. The master, if he knew, would again reprimand thee. Mark this well.” Xianci heard and reverently thanked her.

Sanjie then tidied the three stone chambers and bade Xianci cultivate within the cave. She herself returned to Xiqi to report to the Perfect Man Wenmei.

Time among immortals passes swiftly; in a moment, four or five years passed. Xianci’s Dao heart was firm and well rooted; his progress was easier than others. He had ceased all worldly desires and fully realized his nature. Each year Wenmei sent Sanjie to teach him methods of summoning spirits, commanding generals, and protecting the body; Xianci comprehended them all.

One day, while sitting in contemplation and nurturing Qi, he suddenly heard a voice by his ear: “The snail spirit is in peril; go speedily to repay thy debt.” Xianci awoke with a start, and opening his eyes, saw Sister Hu Sanjie once again.

What peril the snail spirit suffered, we shall relate in the next chapter.
