# Chapter 24: The Immortal Li Exercises Magic to Warn the Licentious and Violent; Filial Son Yang Is Moved by Virtue and Enters the Mysterious Gate

It is related how Yang's mother spoke to Li Xuan, saying, "The Immortal Master, with good intent, fosters my son; how could we mother and child fail to be grateful? Even though my late husband is departed and beneath the earth, if he still has consciousness, he would certainly feel this gratitude. Yet there is one difficulty which I dare not leave unspoken before the Immortal Master. Consider that Niu Jing is steward of the Prince of Zhongshan's mansion, and is ordinarily most trusted by the prince; therefore he dares to act so presumptuously. Though this time the Master’s great power rescued us from danger, I fear that once you depart, that villain will surely contrive revenge. Although my son may not be able to save me, with that man by his side, it seems his courage is somewhat strengthened."

When the lady had spoken thus, Li Xuan laughed heartily and said, "Madam, please set aside one hundred and twenty-eight worries. That villain Niu is already thrown upside down by me and your son; shortly the Prince of Zhongshan will surely sentence him to death, and he will distribute the millions of property he extorted and obtained by deceit among many victimized households. Even if madam is not greedy for this unexpected wealth, nor desires to recover losses, still she will not suffer his manipulation again. This I, the poor Daoist, can guarantee for sure. Madam does not believe me? Then I beg you to inquire carefully of your son. His very joy just now was for these reasons alone." Yang’s mother, hearing this, found nothing to doubt, but wished to understand the truth clearly; therefore she sharply rebuked Yang Ren, saying, "When it is your turn to speak, why do you keep silent?" Yang Ren hurriedly replied, "It is not that I will not speak, but since the Immortal Master is speaking with my mother, how could I interrupt? Now I am about to report to my mother."

Li Xuan saw that they were so respectful and orderly, and could not help but silently nod his head, thinking: These mother and son amid adversity do not neglect rites of seniority and junior; truly this is not easy. Smiling, he said, "Young Master, quickly report what we have done to your honored mother. When we have finished speaking, we shall determine a plan for advance or retreat. I, the poor Daoist, wander from mountain to mountain and river to river, having no fixed home, and cannot remain long in one place." Yang Ren then recounted the above matters in full. When he had finished, Yang’s mother smiled faintly and said, "The marvels of the Immortal way are indeed different. Such licentious and greedy men deserve severe punishment; if not, then there would be neither earthly law nor heavenly justice, and the world could not endure. Pray, Immortal Master, as for my son following you henceforth, it would be a great blessing indeed. As a widow, though this son be all I have, I would not suffer him to linger or neglect his studies, nor bury his innate nature. Yet the love of a mother for her child is not to be escaped even by the wise. My son now goes forth; I know not when he shall return."

Li Xuan said, "Madam, your understanding and insight must know that all drinking and eating, assembling and dispersing, have their ordained measure. For example, I, the poor Daoist, was at first cultivating the way in the extreme North; how then did I come here but by fate, meeting your son? Even if beforehand an appointment were made, it could not be so exact as this meeting. Thus, though your son has a thousand and one lives, he would have perished long ago. By the reckoning of his destined number, your son was to have this calamity, and I was to save him. Therefore, though a thousand li away and with mountains and waters between, meeting as strangers, this connection was made. Is this chance? Surely there is a principle within. This principle is that which the Daoists call destiny, and the Confucians call Heaven acting without knowing it. Such is the explanation."

Hearing this, the lady’s heart was suddenly enlightened, and unexpectedly she sorrowed, saying, "According to the Immortal Master’s words, it seems that the widow and my son, at this parting, may not meet again?" Before Li Xuan could reply, Yang Ren suddenly wept bitterly, saying, "If it be so, I would rather serve my mother, and attend her at her knees all my life. If there be indeed an Immortal fate, it shall wait till after my mother’s hundred years. For now, I beg the Immortal Master to pardon me, and grant me some decades’ leave." Yang’s mother, hearing her son thus speak and seeing his grief, could not but shed tears, but made no sound, quietly awaiting Li Xuan’s instruction.

Li Xuan sighed and said, "Madam, your words are somewhat wanting in understanding. Life is like a dream; we cannot know our own life and death, how much less can we know the meetings and partings of mother and child, husband and wife? Consider us three here — today we meet without cause. Before meeting, did madam ever think that on this day and hour, one named Li Xuan would come to meet you? I, Li Xuan, having cultivated the way and attained success, can know some of the future, yet not without reason expect to meet madam at this very year, month, day, and hour. Meetings are not fixed, and partings have no constancy; dispersals cannot be foreseen, and gatherings are harder to predict. Thus, madam, mother and son relying on each other in hardship, at this moment of parting have many attachments. Knowing well that the future is uncertain, yet the heart cannot restrain itself, naturally there arise these ties and conjectures. This is the common feeling of men, which even one like me, who has set my mind in emptiness and dwells in the realm of the ethereal, cannot wholly avoid. Even the knowledge of my own existence or non-existence is not perfect; how much less that of an observer? Therefore I admonish the virtuous lady that your son’s heavenly nature must not be wasted, and life’s time must especially not be squandered. Since the great way is found and the immortals are no fictions, you must seize the moment to make a clean severance and perfect the matter. Though I dare not rashly reveal heavenly secrets, I have promised your son that in twenty years, after his studies are complete, he shall return home and may then see you. Then your son will have achieved greatness, and your meeting shall be long and enduring, never to be sundered. Would this not be far better than the tens of years now spent side by side? I, a man of the Way, dare not interfere more, nor impose on others. My earnest advice is but the fruit of my compassion and respect for your motherly virtue and filial spirit, and so I make this great vow. I hope your noble example may show the law of Heaven’s retribution and blessing as a model for the world, that even after hundreds or thousands of years, it may still be followed and encouraged. This is the merit of you and your son. I, the poor Daoist, am but fulfilling the duty which I as a cultivator must discharge. I have said enough; whether you consent or not, the decision is yours. Should madam resolve never to part, this is human feeling, and there is no fault in it; I shall take my leave at once. But I fear that when in future you seek me, it will be only to sigh and regret the belatedness."

Hearing this, madam rose determinedly, folded her garments, and bowed down, saying, "The Immortal Master’s words are as firm as metal and stone; your heart is that of Heaven and Earth. This poor widow’s shallow view has almost caused offense and delayed my son. Now having been enlightened, my heart is clear. At once I shall order my son to follow you. Surely my son by your side will fare better than by his mother’s. The widow is at peace indeed. Once the word is spoken, this heart shall not be changed. Let alone twenty years, even if fifty or sixty or seventy or eighty years, if my son’s cultivation be weak and he fail in the way, he shall be a most unfilial and rebellious son; even if he return, I vow not to see him." Li Xuan, hearing this, greatly admired her. Yang’s mother bade her son bow to the teacher. Though still reluctant, Yang Ren was sternly admonished by his mother and dared not disobey; he bowed eight times to Li Xuan. Li Xuan personally escorted Yang’s mother home, transmuted stone to gold to provide for her, and drew a boundary around the house to guard against thieves. He also drew dozens of fierce spirits with a bare brush; if danger arose, these could be hung within the dwelling, and by invoking the Master Li’s orders for protection, the spirits would appear and drive off robbers. Yang’s mother thanked him and accepted his commands.

Later, local ruffians, seeing Yang’s mother well supplied, suspected hoarding, gathered a band, and made a raid. They entered the gate shouting, but Yang’s mother hastily took down the pictures and hung them up; by the law she tested them, and the men saw countless fierce ghosts holding knives and spears come to resist; terrified, the band of thieves fled for their lives. Yet the magic circle drawn by Li Xuan was such that one could enter but not leave; awakened by the commotion, the neighbours captured all the men. Wishing to avoid further trouble, kind words were used to send them away. From then on, no villain dared to invade. Ten years later, Li Xuan saw that Yang Ren’s heart was sincere in cultivation, and that the lady was aged and thought of her son day and night. Therefore, by Li Xuan’s order and grace, Yang Ren was commanded to descend the mountain and bring his mother northward, to meet once yearly, thus fulfilling the filial love between mother and son. This is to be told later.

Li Xuan took Yang Ren north from Qiantang, crossing the river and entering the lands of Qi and Lu, where he found for Yang Ren a cave dwelling at the foot of Mount Tai, named Wuyadong, where the method of breathing and exchanging breath was taught. He ordered him first to practice exercises for nourishing the heart and circulating the breath. Since Yang Ren was a novice in cultivation, like Master Wen Shi once protected him, besides applying magic for protection, he specially summoned Lady Baiyu from Mount Hua to attend him. Because her name was too presumptuous, it was changed to Yu’er. Every three years she came to Mount Tai to test Yang Ren's skill and give instruction. Though Yang Ren had a good nature, he could not compare with Li Xuan, who was born with an immortal root, and after ten years’ cultivation had severed all mortal ties and mastered the arts of riding the clouds and summoning spirits. According to Li Xuan, compared with ordinary cultivators, Yang Ren was progressing swiftly indeed.

Now, without further mention of Yang Ren, let us speak again of Li Xuan, who after guiding Yang Ren, continued to roam about the north and south lands and the isles of the sea. In ten years, he had accomplished many deeds benefiting men, aiding the good, removing evil, and securing peace. When the twenty years’ term was near completion, remembering the promise of his master, he first returned to Zixia Cave on Mount Hua. Originally, Li Xuan’s descent to the mortal world was a solitary journey, but he left Feifei and Diandian in the cave to cultivate. Grateful for Li Xuan’s teaching and protection, they dared not be careless. Over several years their progress was notable; they were able to shed their animal skins and bones, forever abandoning beastly form, and became earth immortals of undying longevity. In leisure, sharing Li Xuan’s heart, wherever demons and evil spirits disturbed the human realm around the mountain, they went forth to suppress and eliminate them, thereby accruing much merit. The cave and surroundings were made serene and elegant; many immortal flowers and fruits were grown, and many immortal birds and creatures nurtured. Compared with Li Xuan’s time, the place was even more orderly and tranquil, indeed becoming a celestial immortal land, a cave of the Golden Immortals. Li Xuan returned to the cave and, seeing this, was pleased in his heart. He examined their merit and learning, and seeing their progress was manifest, could not conceal his joy. Seeing the two prostrate before his seat, he stretched out his hand to raise them; they stepped back to either side. Li Xuan said, "Since I descended the mountain that year, following the master’s instructions, I have wandered the mortal world. Though I have done no great deeds, I have received one disciple with root and capacity, and established some merit in aiding the world. I feel ashamed that my achievements are so small, and it is hard to meet my master’s face. Now you have my orders; you may do many good deeds, and your wisdom and merit surpass mine. When I first entered the cave, seeing how well you have arranged all before and behind the mountain, inside and outside the cave, I knew you were greatly capable. It is not that I love these externals, but I rejoice in this sign because it shows your diligence and dedication. If such small matters are so, greater things may be imagined. When examined more closely, it does not fail to be as expected, and this is my greatest joy. You who advance so diligently, say nothing of your original root — even if you are first learning the Way, you will surely soon attain true enlightenment."

Feifei and Diandian hurriedly knelt and said, "We owe everything to our master’s teaching and support; as beasts given these skills, it is beyond what we hoped. Moreover, to be thus praised by the master fills us with shame." Li Xuan nodded and said, "You have already become men, and do not hide your former birth; this shows your self-discipline. Rise! Rise! I shall now teach you the essentials of cultivating the heart and nature. This method is not ordinary, nor common magic; it is the highest work of the immortals to cultivate body and extend life. Once successfully practiced, truly you may live as long as Heaven and Earth. If you also perform merit, then after hundreds of years you may keep pace with the immortals of Heaven, and the precious palaces of Lingxiao and the Three Isles of Penglai shall be open to you."

The two were so joyful that tears fell, and they knelt again to thank him. Li Xuan further said, "I cannot remain here long this time; tomorrow I must go to Kunlun Mountain’s Eight Scenes Palace to pay respect to my master and follow the ancient instructions. You two be sure to be diligent; I need not admonish you further. My new disciple, named Yang Ren, I have already sent Yu’er to Mount Tai to serve him. But as his skill is shallow, you two shall visit him twice in three years, testing whether his heart is firm and his effort steadfast. Report back to me, and I will deal with him accordingly. Yang Ren is of excellent root and his filial piety moves Heaven; his success will be swift. I am eager to promote him. After paying respects to the master, I intend to personally go to teach him." They answered, "We obey."

On the next day, Li Xuan sat solemnly in the cave. At midday he suddenly heard the clear music of immortals in the air, and rose, saying, "This is my master sent to welcome me." He tidied his robes and stepped out of the cave. Surely he saw clusters of colourful clouds descending from Heaven, within which was a youth in green holding a whisk and controlling a crane in waiting. Li Xuan hastened to make a kowtow, saying, "What can Li Xuan do, to have the honour of such courtesy from my master?" The youth said, "My master and many elder brothers await you! You must please hasten your journey!" Li Xuan kowtowed again, mounted the crane’s back, and rose into the sky. The immortal clouds and colours faded and vanished. Feifei and Diandian, full of admiration, looked at each other and said, "To attain this degree of cultivation as immortals is not in vain all the hardship."

Leaving aside their private talk, we say that Li Xuan arrived before the Eight Scenes Palace, alighted on the clouds, dismounted the crane, and awaited the master’s summons. Two youths laughed, saying, "Brother, you are too courteous; the master has sent us to meet you; you need only enter and pay homage; why the further summons?" Li Xuan whispered, "This foolish elder brother is unlike juniors; it is hard to come here; how dare I be rash?" The youths smiled and departed. Soon they returned and said, "The master bids you enter." Li Xuan straightened his dress and cap, and slowly and reverently entered by the wall. There he saw the Old Master seated in the great hall upon a lotus throne, with several generations of immortals standing beside him. Seeing Li Xuan arrive, each bowed and paid respects. Li Xuan first made eight great bows toward the upper seat before daring to meet the immortals. The Old Master smiled and said, "You have done considerable real work in ten years; now you may finish what you must do. There are debts from former lives and affinities in this life; debts must be repaid, and affinities hastened." Saying thus, he looked up and smiled faintly, then closed his eyes and sat. Li Xuan, not understanding, was about to ask, when the Old Lord suddenly opened his eyes and said, "Your parents await your transcendence; if you do not hasten this opportunity to act, you will only drag them through the bitterness of the mortal world longer, and that will be your fault." Li Xuan kowtowed and said, "Yes, it is as you say." The Old Lord said further, "Go then! When you have guided your parents across, come again to see me!" Li Xuan obeyed and withdrew.

How Li Xuan enlightened his parents is to be related in the next chapter.
