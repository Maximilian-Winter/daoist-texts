# Chapter 37: The Fairy Admonishes the Tyrant to Turn to Goodness; The Child Bravely Wrestles the Great Leopard

It is said that when the First Emperor heard that Zhao Gao’s household had discovered a supernatural person, he was not alarmed but rather rejoiced. He quickly said, “You rise. I think that beneath my chariot wheels, within the capital city, with myself present, how could there be so bold a supernatural being, daring to manifest in broad daylight? Surely it is someone in your household who has offended a true immortal, causing her to descend to your mansion, to show a slight intent of punishment. I am now seeking immortality and the Dao; since a true immortal is here, she will not forsake me. Perhaps she wishes to see me, but lacking opportunity to advance, has purposely manifested her marvels near a minister’s household, so that I may go to meet her in person—this cannot be known.” Zhao Gao, hearing the First Emperor thus speak, was truly taken aback; yet he was a man of great cunning and knowing the emperor’s fixed opinion, he knew it could not be changed. Moreover, by means of this, to gain introduction to the immortal would be no small gain for himself. So he immediately changed his expression, bowed his head, and said, “Your servant is truly ignorant, having been for a time bewildered by the immortal’s seeming trickery, and mistakenly took her for a demon. Now in reflection, with Your Majesty’s mighty and divine power, wherever Your Majesty’s chariot goes, no demon dare remain in the capital. By this reasoning, what my household saw must be a true immortal without doubt. If not for Your Majesty’s heavenly wisdom, how could you at once perceive this truth? Now I beseech Your Majesty to come to my house and summon this immortal, so that she may know Your Majesty’s sincerity in seeking the Dao, and early transmit the Golden Elixir and the wonderful medicine of longevity. I pray leave to return first and inform the immortal, and together receive Your Majesty’s approach.” The First Emperor was greatly pleased, saying, “Your words accord with my heart. Go quickly to your house; I will come at once.” Thus Zhao Gao turned anger into joy, and anxiety into delight, and went home with a proud and happy countenance.

Who would have thought that the fairy, since no one in Zhao’s household took charge, was left alone mixing with the household’s women in the great hall. Finding little to be gained, she resolved to admonish the young master, then at once leave the mansion to return to her borrowed dwelling, the Pure Emptiness Temple. Thereupon she withdrew her magic power, and in a moment many false young masters vanished without trace, leaving but one true young master who had recovered his spirit and mind. Seeing the fairy and all the household, he seemed to awaken from a great dream; recalling all that had just passed, he was perfectly clear, only lamenting that at the time he could not move hand or tongue. Now that he was free, he knew the fairy was no ordinary woman but indeed a heavenly being reincarnate. Yet for the moment he did not know what was best to do.

The fairy beckoned with her hand, and the young master, no longer master of himself, ran straight over and knelt upright on the ground. The fairy then sternly rebuked him: “Your foster father is but a petty man of the marketplace; what talent or virtue has he? Only by cunning and craftiness has he flattered the emperor into favour. Though a mere eunuch, he has risen to such eminence, and should be careful to keep within his bounds, content and self-restrained—this is the true way. How is it that, relying on favour and rank, he behaves as a villain? Above, he blinds the Son of Heaven; below, he oppresses the ministers; the people’s life-blood he sucks dry and withers utterly. Yet he dares to incite the Son of Heaven to commit tyranny. Such conduct is intolerable to Heaven’s principle; destruction is near at hand. You, as his son, do not seek to do good and lessen his guilt, but instead arrogantly abuse your power, seducing virtuous women and causing families to ruin and death. In guilt you are not less than your father. This day, by chance encountering me, a poor Daoist with some slight magic, you have escaped his poisonous hand. Had it been otherwise, you would by now be a wronged ghost in the Halls of Retribution. According to your deeds, you deserve instant death by the sword, to relieve the many victims within and without the capital. Yet I am bound by my master’s law not to kill lightly; and though your father and you are full of wickedness, your evil fate is not yet complete. You must live some years more, and when your crimes are at their height, the retribution will be manifest. Tell your father, all await to see it!”

The young master of Zhao, hearing this sharp rebuke, understood in his heart but was wont to harm others without restraint; he had never known what it was to acknowledge guilt or repent. After the fairy’s severe admonition, he only opened his eyes to reveal a fierce glare, glaring evilly at the fairy. She sighed softly and said to those on both sides, “Look at your young master’s expression! Were it not for me, he would by now have fallen upon you, intent on taking my life. Alas, I spoke many kind words to him, but he heeded not one. I will not trouble myself further with him. If he had not encountered me, it would be nothing; but since he has fallen under my hand, I will not allow him to go forth to ruin other women, nor am I pleased to lightly break my vow of non-killing for such a useless fellow. See now, with my finger I will point to his vital points, so that his entire body’s qi and blood vessels cannot flow as before; at least he will gain a wasting disease. Not to mention going forth to do evil, even to move a step will exhaust all his strength, and thus he will become a useless man.”

Hearing this, all were greatly alarmed. They fell upon their knees before the fairy, bowing their heads with sound, pleading mercy for the young master. The fairy smiled and said, “I know well that had he truly repented, this would be the gateway into the Dao; not only might he be spared, but he might cultivate to become an immortal—all depends on this one thought. Now seeing that he shows no sign of repentance but only anger and hatred, he is plainly a hardened and unrepentant wretch. Sparing his life is already great mercy; how could I allow him to go forth to harm others?” She spoke and extended a finger to the young master’s upper body at the acupoint. At once the young master cried “Ah!” and fell backward, lying on the ground moaning. The people were greatly frightened, hastening to aid him, when the fairy laughed, “You at once have two men carry him inside. He has no strength to move.” Before she finished, there came outside the sound that a great man had returned. The fairy was somewhat surprised: how could that villain Zhao Gao still have the courage to see her? So she sat with dignity in the great hall, awaiting his coming, to hear what further words he might have.

Unexpectedly, Zhao Gao upon seeing the fairy immediately knelt on the ground, crawling forward and crying aloud: “Immortal, forgive my guilt. Your servant truly did not know the immortal had descended; just now there were many offenses. Also, I heard that the young master was recalcitrant and was graciously punished; your servant is most grateful. I have just reported to the Son of Heaven, who commanded me to send an imperial order to invite the immortal to stay her magic chariot a while, to come forth at once and meet with you.” Hearing this, the fairy was somewhat puzzled; yet since he approached with courtesy, she could no longer be arrogant. Smiling, she waved her hand and said, “Rise, rise. Your son is ungoverned; this poor Daoist cannot bear to see the people suffer, and only showed slight punishment, so that he cannot do evil, and in future will not burden your family. As for the emperor’s arrival, this poor Daoist dare not presume; I will present myself before the court. I am not a golden immortal of the upper realm, but know somewhat of the way of cultivation, and will certainly report the facts face to face without concealment. If one outside seeks the name of cultivation yet harbours lustful thoughts, even if he meets the immortal ancestors and the Jade Emperor, he will not obtain the effect of longevity. Moreover, I have no merit or virtue, and what magic could I wield on his behalf?” Having said this, she laughed and said to Zhao Gao, “Please extend my thanks to the emperor. I take my leave.” She waved her sleeve, and the hall was filled with red light and waves of strange fragrance, which caused the hearts of those who smelled it to be refreshed with reverence.

Zhao Gao was asking about his son’s illness when the First Emperor arrived; he hastened out to kneel and receive him, and repeated the fairy’s words in report. The First Emperor could not help but say in displeasure, “The immortal wishes to ask if I am sincere, but without approaching, how am I to declare it to her?” Zhao Gao reported, “From the tone of the immortal’s words, it seems she deeply feels the imperial grace, and will certainly enter the palace to present herself. Your Majesty is to dwell in the inner palace awaiting her descent, then to entreat the Divine Dao. I believe there will be success.” The First Emperor then asked a few questions about the circumstances of the immortal’s descent. Zhao Gao then reported his son’s illness clearly.

Returning to the palace, the First Emperor found the Empress and other concubines gathered in the imperial garden. He ordered two great eunuchs to follow and enter the garden. A small eunuch hurried forward to announce their arrival. The Empress led a group of concubines in kneeling to greet. The First Emperor entered the gate, taking the Empress’s hand with a smile and asked, “Why have you all come here at once?” The Empress reported, “We would report to Your Majesty that just now there arose in the air many clusters of coloured clouds, and in their midst stood an immortal lady, dressed in outer garb, holding a whisk, and dropping a white silk cloth which fell within the garden. Therefore, all have come to see.” She then presented the white silk to the First Emperor with both hands. He took it and saw written thereon: ‘To nourish the heart, none is better than few desires; to seek the Dao, none is prior to loving the people.’ At the end was the character ‘He.’

The First Emperor, seeing this, could not help but laugh bitterly, saying, “This is the female Daoist from the Zhao household. If she is an immortal, how can she speak such pedantic words?” The Empress also laughed, saying, “Such words of a rotten scholar! The hundreds of gentlemen who were buried last time all spoke such words. Who would want her to speak more?” Hearing this, the First Emperor suddenly recalled something, and said, “I heard some ministers report that every mountain, sea, river, and lake has a god who presides over it; only the god of the Yellow River has the most Daoist power. If we offer white jade and sacrifice silk, it surely will guarantee my sacred longevity for ten thousand years. I sent ministers to offer sacrifices in my place, but to this day they have not returned. Yesterday there was another alchemist who claimed he could summon wind, rain, thunder, and lightning, and command ghostly envoys and divine soldiers. I planned to summon him to court to test him, but was so busy I forgot. Tomorrow I must investigate these two matters clearly.” The Empress and others reported, “Immortals certainly exist, but there are also those who only know a little magic and have not much power. Hearing that the Son of Heaven loves the Dao, they seek riches and honour by displaying their talents, but truly have nothing to do with the Great Dao. Such people the Ten Thousand Years must guard against.” The First Emperor nodded and smiled, saying, “The consort’s words are wise. I often guard against such deceivers, so I must test them face to face before I trust them.” The Empress and others said together, “Your Majesty is sagacious.” The First Emperor was greatly pleased, and ordered the eunuchs to issue an edict, setting a banquet at the pavilion on the lake in the imperial garden, to drink and amuse with the consorts.

Here the narrative pauses, and we return to He Xiangu, who having left the Zhao household, used her invisibility art to wait near the house. After a while, seeing the First Emperor indeed arrive in person, she was not without feeling moved, thinking that when a man has good thought, Heaven must follow. Although the First Emperor is violent, he is after all the lord of all under Heaven. If he could instantly repent his misdeeds and renew the people, turning his fate by a single hand, it would be no difficult matter to create boundless blessings and reverse destiny. Since he has such sincerity toward me, I cannot but fully exert my own heart and go to admonish him a few words. Having resolved this, she wrote those two phrases upon white silk, rode on a cloud into the palace, and purposely revealed her original form, dropping the piece of silk from within the palace. This was nothing other than to hope that those within the palace, marvelling and praising, would be convinced of the truth of immortality, and when the First Emperor returned, all would report the matter, further strengthening his belief in the immortal Dao. This was her heartfelt intention, but who would have thought the First Emperor would take it as pedantic and ignore it? This was indeed beyond the fairy’s expectation. Having dropped the silk, she at once returned to that temple, and seeing the young master of Zhao and his retinue, found them all vanished. She laughed, “No need to say, this is the work of that Daoist master. I was just about to look for him; now I must go and ask that old Daoist.”

As she thought this, she was about to step forth, when unexpectedly the old Daoist came toward her. Seeing the fairy, he cried out, “Fellow Daoist, you have harmed people! I told you not to seek a residence, but you did not listen, and met that Zhao young master. You are a person of cultivation; a little trickery does not harm, but you have caused his family to be turned upside down. Have you thought how, under such great power and influence as his, how can you escape his grasp? Just now he sent soldiers to take our Great Master Liu; we do not yet know what charges will be laid against him. No need to say more; you cannot manage all these things. But from now on, our temple will not shelter passing Daoists. You must bear this grievance, and find lodging elsewhere.” Hearing this, the fairy was at once surprised and angry, but seeing his resolve was firm, she could not argue. She said, “Master Liu also has Dao power; how could he be harmed by that villain? As for this poor Daoist, I need no fixed dwelling; if I must go, I shall go, and need not trouble you. Only one thing I would ask: when you escorted the Zhao young master out just now, a Daoist and I greeted each other briefly. Because of business I had no time to inquire further. May I ask if that Daoist was the Master Fei? Does he live in the temple, or elsewhere?” The Daoist replied, “Master Fei lives on West Street, very near here. He is a renowned man of ability; wherever you go, just ask and you will know.” Saying this, he bowed and left without looking back. The fairy was left standing alone, with no one to attend her.

The fairy was angry and somewhat amused, and could only walk slowly away. She came to a street, asked directions, and indeed was pointed to the West Street home of Master Fei. Upon asking, a child opened the door and seeing the fairy spat, then laughed, saying, “My father hates monks and Daoists. My uncle is bewitched every day by a crooked Daoist. Now a female Daoist comes looking for him—what a laugh indeed!” Having said this, he shut the door, and however loudly she cried, no one paid attention. The fairy could not help but smile, saying, “Having come to the capital, I have been driven away twice; it seems at the feet of the Son of Heaven, truly there are many bad men and few good.” Having said this, she turned and found a quiet solitary place to sit and meditate all night. At dawn, she opened her eyes, came to the stream to draw some spring water to wash her eyes. She was pondering how to find that Master Fei again, to consult on ways to save Master Liu, and to ask him some Daoist methods, but troubled because his household would not receive her. What was she to do? Thinking thus, she sat on a stone for washing clothes, lost in thought.

Suddenly she heard a strange wind arise from behind the western mountain; the trees on the mountain rustled; the insects and birds all gave a great whistle, calling and crying confusedly, then scattered flying away. Listening down at the spring water, it sounded rushing and tumbling, raising many ripples, tossing many fish and shrimps in disorder, up and down, rolling and tumbling in a commotion. The fairy could not help but nod and sigh, saying, “Insects, birds, fish, and shrimps dwell in mountains and waters without wrongdoing, yet suffer the harsh wind. I hear that this Son of Heaven now commits many unjust acts. Zhao Gao and a band of villains lead him to evil; the four seas are in uproar; the people wander and flee, not knowing where to die. How are these different from the fish and birds just now?” At this thought she felt a great compassion, and lamented that her cultivation was too shallow to expel the violent and establish the good, to save the innumerable suffering people of the world and dispel the countless vexations of humanity.

Lost in thought, suddenly another great wind arose, more violent and swift than before, more fierce in force. In a moment, the sounds of mountain trees, water, insect and bird cries, stones rolling and sand flying, all answered each other, mingling into a scene of fearful noise. The fairy saw the wind come from nowhere, and with a wave of her sleeve drew a divination. She was greatly alarmed, saying, “There must be a great tiger or leopard in the mountain.” Before she finished speaking there came a rumbling sound from the mountain, fiercer than ordinary thunder. The fairy drew her sword, left the side of the stream, and stepped step by step around the brook, seeking to ascend the mountain. Halfway there, she saw a great spotted leopard rushing out from the mountain, running but frequently looking back, as if fearing pursuit. The fairy was astonished, saying, “So great a beast! Could there be one pursuing it?” As she spoke, she saw a strange sight. Behind the leopard indeed was a person flying in swift pursuit, and this person appeared no more than eight or nine years old. Seeing him bare-handed and bravely coming, as swift as the wind, he shouted, “Wretched beast, you dare to flee? Do you think I, your young master, will let you go?”

This sight astonished the fairy, leaving her dumbfounded and at a loss. How the child could fight the leopard, and what the outcome might be, will be revealed in the next chapter.
