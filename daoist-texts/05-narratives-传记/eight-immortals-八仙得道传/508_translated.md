# Chapter XL: Discourse on Past Lives of Men and Beasts, Unraveling Doubts — New Friends Are Old Acquaintances

Meanwhile, the Immortal Maiden and Old Jun, father and son, listened to Master Tieguai recounting the ties of old between the Leopard and Zhongli Quan; in their hearts there was much doubt, and they hastily asked the Immortal Teacher, "How can it be shown that these beasts also hold ties of old with men?" Master Tieguai smiled and said, "Soon you shall know; there is no need for lengthy questioning." The company dared not inquire further.

After a time, they passed many places, all exceedingly fair; what met their eyes were flowers that never withered through the seasons, birds which sang in winter and summer alike, and many creatures never before observed, all fashioned with singular neatness and rare grace; in short, they were unlike any found in the world of men. Master Tieguai pointed to a small bridge ahead, saying, "There flows a stream yonder, with boats prepared upon its water. When we reach there, we shall embark upon a boat to a certain house; this I count my humble abode, whither I have already commanded some slight refreshment to be prepared. May we offer you gentlemen a brief repast?" Old Jun and the Immortal Maiden were filled with gratitude and thanks; Zhongli Quan and his elder sister, the Great Maiden, were so pleased that they leapt about in joy; Zhongli Quan even embraced one of Master Tieguai's short legs, exclaiming, "My Master, my good Master, how is it that you have such a fine place? If only I might follow you here and live out a lifetime in this place, it would be enough." Master Tieguai smiled and nodded, saying, "That is no difficulty. If you but attain the Path of Immortality, not only this little trifle, but the whole heaven and earth will be laid within your bosom; all things are easy of accomplishment."

Old Jun hastily rebuked, "Child, do not be so headstrong; if you vex the Master, he will cast you off." Master Tieguai and the Immortal Maiden both laughed and stopped him, saying, "Children ought to be lively in this manner. Our Taoism esteems a heart without guile. When a child is as he is now, it is the time of perfect guilelessness, which in their Confucian school is called the 'heart of an infant.' Confucius said, 'In the ancient time Yü Shun ruled by non-action.' This is the principle. Our ancestor Li Laozi composed the Tao Te Ching in thirty chapters, wherein he highly esteems non-action. Non-action means the absence of guile; when guile arises, manifold changes arise. How can one then govern by non-action? Therefore, in cultivation of the Immortal Way, it is most precious to take the path from childhood, opening the orifices and attaining the mysterious; it is much easier than for grown men." Old Jun then ceased speaking.

The five in company reached the bridge-side, and saw that though the bridge was not broad, it was built without roots or seams, as if of celestial growth; the materials used were strange and rare, unknown in name, and adorned with precious jewels and strange ornaments. Zhongli Quan stood upon the bridge and stroked a pillar, smiling to his father, "This thing is indeed amusing."

Before he had finished speaking, suddenly Master Tieguai shouted, "What is there to be amused at? Though trifles be small matters, they can move the heart; once the heart is moved, it hinders the cultivation of the Way. Is there need to become a recluse?" Zhongli Quan was startled and quickly withdrew his hand and composed himself, saying solemnly, "Master, your disciple has never loved trifles; but now because of seeing the unseen, I unwittingly uttered it. Master, please forgive me." Master Tieguai smiled and said, "Did I not just say that the cultivation of the Way must be founded upon an unmoved heart? When the heart is moved, external demons arise, and throughout life no accomplishment is had. You say you see the unseen and are amazed — this is not the conduct of a cultivator; henceforth you must also guard against this."

The Immortal Maiden stood beside, nodding with admiration, and stroked Zhongli Quan's neck, smiling, "This is truly the supreme word of the Way. Good child, since you would learn the Way, first you must firmly engrave this saying upon your heart; pursuing to the final step, you must not even permit yourself to remember this saying, for to have heart to remember it is also a kind of effort!" Master Tieguai heard this, nodded, and smiled as though in approval.

They boarded the prepared boat, where two women held oars to attend them. The five disembarked and propelled the boat swiftly down the stream. Presently they arrived at the house indicated by Master Tieguai, who said, "We have come; let us all go ashore." The two women drew the boat to the bank, and the five stepped out one by one. Though the house was not large, it was exquisitely built, its connections above and below like the bridge, with no signs of joining. Master Tieguai claimed it as his abode, and invited the four within, whereupon male and female attendants came forth to serve.

Master Tieguai led them into a small, exquisitely arranged study, furnished in antique style. Once they were seated, he spoke to Zhongli Quan, "You must understand why the Leopard holds ties of old with you; come and see for yourself." Zhongli Quan laughed, "I have always doubted how a good man could have any ties with such an evil beast." Master Tieguai did not answer, but took from his sleeve a small gourd, which had a hole through which one might look. "Child," said he, "come and see what is within." Zhongli Quan looked through the hole and saw a palace upon a lofty mountain; around the palace was a vast garden, more exquisite than what was seen before in the jar, and many immortals came and went riding on clouds and mists. Within the main hall of the palace sat an old immortal, whose face was very familiar, though he could not recall where he had seen him; he sat in the centre, with many immortals standing about to hear his instruction, and Master Tieguai was among them.

The old immortal first sent Master Tieguai down to the mortal realm by sea; shortly thereafter he himself also set forth downwards. Before departing, he charged a boy to tend and watch over his blue ox, bidding him be careful. But when the boy was left alone, he went off to play in the garden with a group of children, and at one time brought the ox into the garden to play games; the ox disobeyed, so the boy struck it several times, stirring up the nature of the ox, which then fled down to the mortal world, causing many great disasters. Most strangely, the first place it came to resembled the mountain behind the village where Zhongli Quan dwelt; there it somehow befriended a leopard, often going out and returning with it, sleeping beside it and rising with it. Later the leopard bore a cub, and the ox abandoned it and went elsewhere, taking human form to seduce women, even carrying off their lawful husbands, and becoming their husbands himself, drinking and reveling with these women. This so enraged a Taoist maiden who went to confront it — this Taoist maiden’s form and attire were exactly like the Immortal Maiden who came with them — that Zhongli Quan was so frightened he almost cried out aloud.

Master Tieguai saw this and smiled faintly, asking what he had seen. Zhongli Quan suddenly raised his head to look at the Immortal Maiden, then back at the maiden in the gourd. Master Tieguai laughed, "Perhaps she is within there also?" Zhongli Quan said nothing, but continued to look closely. He saw that the Taoist maiden could not overcome the ox; fortunately another fairy came to rescue her, and the ox’s master, the old immortal, sent another boy to lead the ox back to the palace, while the original ox-tending boy was demoted to the lower realm, reincarnated into a human family. That child’s features and form were exactly like his own, with no difference whatsoever; even the child’s father, mother, and elder sister were exactly his own parents and elder sister. At this, Zhongli Quan was greatly astonished, nearly dropping the gourd in his hands with a loud cry. Old Jun and the Immortal Maiden were also greatly startled, hastily asking what fearful thing the child had seen, but Master Tieguai only smiled faintly and said nothing.

Zhongli Quan held the gourd in his hands, no longer looking within or speaking, but was lost in thought. After a long while, his heart was fully enlightened; suddenly tears fell like rain, and with a voice full of sorrow and pain, he fell at Master Tieguai’s feet and would not rise. Master Tieguai smiled and helped him up, comforting him, "Do you now know your own origin? Do you understand why you came to the mortal realm?" Zhongli Quan rose and wiped his tears, saying, "Your disciple understands all. Your disciple was well in the Heavenly Court, but through carelessness wrought such great calamity, and was banished to the mortal world; the remorse is beyond words. I earnestly hope the Immortal Teacher will have pity and grant me salvation, that I may return to the Heavens; that alone suffices for my wish." Master Tieguai laughed, "Go and ask this Teacher whether the scene in the gourd is indeed so." Zhongli Quan earnestly questioned the Immortal Maiden about the scene of the maiden subduing the ox; the Immortal Maiden was herself amazed. Master Tieguai then commanded Zhongli Quan to look again within the gourd, whether anything else could be seen. Zhongli Quan said, "Indeed, there is yet one thing unclear; is the leopard born of that old ox the very beast we caught today?" Master Tieguai laughed, "If it were not, how could there be ties of old?" Hearing this, Zhongli Quan smiled.

The Immortal Maiden seemed to understand somewhat, and asked Zhongli Quan, "This leopard must surely be born of that ox I subdued; is it not so?" Zhongli Quan said, "It is exactly so." The Immortal Maiden said no more. Zhongli Quan looked again into the gourd, and saw the story of a young leopard following its mother in the mountains; the mother was slain by men, and the young leopard went forth alone, often preying upon fat beasts, but never was seen to eat a man.

Zhongli Quan, seeing this, could not help but say to himself, "No wonder I escaped death today; this beast, having been brought by my Master, must have some good fortune." The others observed him speaking to himself, but were puzzled.

Zhongli Quan looked further, and saw his own history of growth and the events of his meeting with the leopard and the immortal, and even the journey with the Immortal Maiden leading the leopard home, and the meeting with Master Tieguai, until the gourd became pitch-black, and nothing further could be discerned. Master Tieguai then took the gourd and handed it to the Immortal Maiden, saying, "Fellow Daoist, you should also look; there is some principle here that can tell you a story." The Immortal Maiden took it and looked with a smile into the opening, and found it also showed her own story. What surprised her most was how, since parting with Li Xuan, the segment concerning Tieguai also appeared in full. The Immortal Maiden then understood the origin of Master Tieguai, and that he was indeed the former Li Xuan. Having discerned Master Tieguai’s identity, she turned and smiled at him, "So it is Brother Li after all, no wonder you speak so often of ties of two lifetimes. Reckoned thus, there is no other but Brother Li. But you have changed your form and name so, how could I have recognized you?" Master Tieguai laughed heartily.

Thus the Immortal Maiden and Zhongli Quan related to Old Jun and his daughter the matters seen within the gourd. Master Tieguai laughed and said, "Since you all understand fully, there is little reason to linger; return now." Saying this, he raised his staff and struck the gourd; there was a great crashing sound like thunder, and all were startled. When they recovered their senses, they found themselves once more in Zhongli Quan’s hall. Recalling what they had seen in the gourd was like a strange dream; they all bowed anew to Master Tieguai, thanking him for his guidance.

Master Tieguai dwelt at Zhongli Quan’s home, conversing morning and evening with the Immortal Maiden and Zhongli Quan. The Immortal Maiden often petitioned him to rescue Master Liu and seek Fei Changfang; Tieguai only said, "Patience, it will not be amiss." After three days, the Immortal Maiden ceased questioning. Suddenly Master Tieguai smiled and said, "The Fei Changfang you seek will surely return today. Why do you wish to see him?" The Immortal Maiden replied, "There is no great matter; but formerly, when troubled by the bandit Zhao, he assisted me with the art of swift travel. Though a minor thing, the kindness is felt, and besides, there are those of his comrades. This Master was seized by bandits, and his life uncertain; I would also inform him. Moreover, this calamity arises from me alone; if I stand aside and take no concern, how can my conscience bear it?"

Master Tieguai nodded and smiled, "I will tell you; Fei Changfang’s art of swift travel was taught by me. Seeing the ox-tending boy demoted to the mortal realm, I petitioned our Ancestor, and by the ties of fellowship came to the mortal world to aid his progress in the Way. If he can be diligent and unremitting, his future merit may equal ours; he is no mere ox-tender. If such be so, truly 'a loss of the horse may prove a blessing.' Among misfortunes, there may yet be great good; all depends upon one’s cultivation. If one does not follow the true Way, willingly tending to the mundane, bound by the seven emotions, indulging the six desires, injuring the spirit and blinding the original nature, then do not speak of success in the Way; one’s debt of sin will be full, and one may seek death in vain, only to fall again into the animal realm, unable to return to man — is this not terrible? Thinking on these dangers, I feared that if care were lost, and a youth whose blood and qi were yet unsettled were led astray by demons and lusts, to lead him back to the right path would require great effort. Therefore I hastened to see how matters were with him in this boyhood, and took occasion to settle many mundane affairs, among them concerning my junior sister, about whom I am also concerned. Before my sister came here, did Master ever mention me?"

The Immortal Maiden answered, "He did indeed mention Brother Li Xuan, but Master only said Li Xuan, and never spoke of your change of form and name, so at our meeting we did not know each other; but if it were not for your bright gourd showing cause and effect, perhaps even now it would be a sealed gourd!" Master Tieguai laughed heartily, and added, "I have been here long, and have observed the child of Zhongli’s household — brave, filial, and friendly, truly a rare talent destined for immortality — my heart is glad. I also awaited your coming, that you two might meet before we journeyed on, and in the meantime rescued that leopard. This creature not only has ties of old with Zhongli Quan, but even I am but one generation senior to it; we all count as fellow disciples. I also found that it has done no harm or man-eating; such wild nature coupled with such good knowledge is indeed extraordinary. The extraordinary, be they man or beast, are noble. Therefore I especially placed it within my gourd, intending in due time to train and uplift it; in future it may serve as a mount, or be given another path of advancement, so that its goodwill is not in vain." All nodded in approval.

Old Jun sighed, "If beasts can refrain from killing men, it is because of Master’s aid. Yet I, a man, possess ambition and have slain countless wild beasts; I know not what suffering I shall meet in the future." Saying this, he patted his son’s back, smiling, "Good child, if you can be truly filial, hasten to cultivate the Way; hasten to perform merit for your father, that you may atone for past sins." Zhongli Quan received his father’s instruction and said solemnly, "Father, rest assured; though I am but a child, my ambition surpasses that of grown men. Since I have resolved to become a recluse, even if my heart be pierced or my body slain, I shall not fear; I must perfect the Way before I return to see you. Should I waver or lack resolve, and give up halfway, I beg my Master to strike me down with thunder and fire; I shall have no complaint."

Old Jun, hearing these resolute words, was moved to tears. Master Tieguai laughed heartily, "If you can resolve thus, how can you fail? Yet your words, a child’s speech becoming an adult’s, are but a paradox. From ancient times, only he who retains the heart of an infant can attain the Immortal Way; but after growing to manhood, with knowledge increased, the allure of external things grows day by day, becoming the chief obstacle to attaining the Way. Therefore I hope you remain always of such childlike heart, even after adulthood, so that you may be twice as effective with half the effort. You are one with an immortal fate and root, and can be thus single-minded and diligent; I guarantee that within fifty years you will have accomplished more than half the Way, and then when you return home, you may even save your father and make him an Earth Immortal."

Hearing this, Zhongli father and son were exceedingly joyful. Master Tieguai further said, "Now I will tell you, Fei Changfang met me quite by chance. Seeing his good qualities, I sent him on a certain mission, first teaching him the art of swift travel." The Immortal Maiden then asked, "What mission does Brother wish him to accomplish?" Master Tieguai said, "You have been here two days, and may have heard of the cruelty of the Qin Emperor. One such ruler is not destined to end well; yet his heart is never satisfied, and he seeks the elixir and the Great Way. Last time he toured Mount Tai, I sent my disciple Fei Fei to seize his white jade seal; now he sends messengers to sacrifice to the Yellow River, so I bade Fei Changfang hasten to return the seal, and with four words warned him: 'The destroyer of Qin is Hu.' This 'Hu' is not the Hu of barbarians, but a secret heavenly plan not to be revealed. Unexpectedly, he misunderstood, and now among the Hu peoples the strongest are the Xiongnu, who roam the northern lands. He has sent General Meng Tian forcibly to draft men and levy supplies, building a great wall from the Eastern Sea to the Western Kunlun Mountains, which some call the Heavenly Mountains, four thousand li in length, causing widespread complaint and hardship among the people."

Master Tieguai, speaking thus, was heard by the Immortal Maiden, who nodded and sighed, "So there is such tyranny; no wonder when I first reached the capital I saw the people with knitted brows and sorrowful faces, as if under great grief. It must surely be this matter." Master Tieguai nodded, and spoke further words.

What the future holds is not yet known; we await the next chapter for further unfolding.
