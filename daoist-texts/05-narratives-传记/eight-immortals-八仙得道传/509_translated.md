# Chapter 41: To Guard Against the Tyrant of Hu Building the Great Wall, Thereby Welcoming the Guest Child Who Encounters a Monster

It is said that the Master Iron Crutch spoke to the Immortal Maiden He: “At that time my heart was full of deepest unrest concerning this matter. I once summoned my soul to Kunlun to petition the Patriarch, and was then made to understand that the merit and harm of the Great Wall lay in a single moment; its benefit extended to ten thousand generations. It was also the destined term of Qin Shi Huang’s reign that was short, and the Heavenly Heart grew weary, making use of his hand to accomplish this great work. Though the suffering of the people was grievous, yet without the undertaking of this great labour, the world could not be swiftly brought to disorder; the true Sovereign could not arise, and the people’s distress in water and fire would be hard to escape. Rather than have them suffer piecemeal, they could not finally avoid this calamity. What if this calamity were shifted upon the building of the Wall? When the calamity on the Wall was finished, the tyrant’s evil would be complete, and the people’s perilous plight would be resolved. Truly, it is a contrivance of Nature, harming men in order to save them — how wondrous is this! I sought instruction, and on returning to the capital, Chang Fang again earnestly beseeched deliverance. Seeing his sincere heart, I employed a stratagem. At the time when the court was everywhere levying labourers, I transformed into a public officer and went to his home to deliver a letter, saying that Chang Fang had been summoned, thus severing the thoughts of his family.”

The Immortal Maiden heard these words and laughed, saying: “So it was thus. No wonder on that day when I personally visited the Fei family, they showed such strange behaviour at my presence. It seemed they were timid and afraid lest further calamity should befall others, and therefore shrank back, not daring to come forth and draw trouble. Pray tell, Master Brother, where is Chang Fang now?”

The Master Iron Crutch replied: “Now the Great Wall has begun construction, and it is said that the term of completion is fixed. Therefore, the number of labourers required is truly great — some hundreds of thousands are indispensable. I know that in the North there is a pitiable young woman whose wedding day draws near. Unknown how, she was seen by a villain who, seeing her beauty, reported to the court. The unrighteous and foolish Emperor issued an edict to take her as a concubine. The young woman remained steadfast and refused, for which the Emperor was filled with hatred, and caused her husband’s name to be placed on the conscription rolls for building the Wall. Alas, this man was of a weak constitution, how could he endure such labour? Moreover, the Emperor had a mind to oppose him, but finding no charge wherewith to slay him, he sent him to the conscripts. Had there been any accusation, this man’s life would have been ended long ago. But in this state of affairs, this man’s life was more endangered than the other robust conscripts; the others had strength to work and no enemies to oppose them, and when the work was finished they could return home. But this man, firstly, was unable to labour, and secondly, had great foes. On arrival there, if he were but negligent in work, he would be beaten and scolded day and night, and death would be at hand. A woman of spirit and talent, knowing her husband would have no hope of survival, was daily urged by court officials to change her mind, to abandon her husband sentenced to this hard fate, and to accept the riches and glory of becoming a concubine. The woman, knowing her husband’s plight was irretrievable, yet unable to do other than preserve her own life, feigned willingness to enter the palace, only seeking to escort her husband to the North, fulfilling the duties of husband and wife. The officials who urged her, on her behalf, petitioned the foolish Emperor, who granted permission. To prove her sincerity to her husband’s family, she came personally to their home, and before her husband and mother-in-law requested immediate marriage, to be married hastily and journey together, so that on the long road there would be no suspicion of impropriety, and so that no one would suspect her of changing heart or loyalty. Her husband’s family, moved by her chastity and honesty, consented to all. After marriage, on the next day they set out together. Along the way, as she was to be a person of the palace, guards were necessarily posted to protect her. The woman thus displayed her future status as imperial concubine, defending her husband at every turn. This couple was now in adversity; I had calculated that both would have no hope of survival. Yet we had a fellow Daoist who pitied their bitter fidelity and sought to act against Heaven. This man is now in Youzhou, struggling with palace people; truly, it is of no avail. I, remembering this friend on the Way, could not but save him; and moved by the woman’s lonely fidelity, I must leave some memorial of her in the world of men. Further, I wished to receive and save her soul, so that when she reincarnated, if fate allowed, she might be brought to success in time. I have now again sent Chang Fang to handle this, though fearing his power in the Way is insufficient and may not carry it through properly. Let us wait for the right moment; I will then personally go with my junior sister to make the journey.”

The Immortal Maiden rejoiced, saying: “In this world there are such women; that we can save and deliver her is truly fortunate. Pray, Master Brother, be sure to take me with you, and not go alone.” The Master Iron Crutch laughed, saying: “What matter is that? Not only may you go, but if A Quan desires to come along for a pleasure trip, that is also allowable!” When Zhongli Quan heard he might accompany them, he was so glad he could not speak. The Immortal Maiden asked: “The Emperor Qin is so cruel; if Master Brother’s Daoist arts could with a single stroke remove such a great evil, would it not be better for the people? Why then the broken and wearisome undertaking of such matters?”

The Master Iron Crutch laughed heartily towards Heaven, saying: “Junior Sister, you have cultivated the Way many years, and yet do not understand the principle of calamity? Wherever a calamity lies, do not speak of exemption; the best that can be done is to diminish it and shorten its duration — even this is utterly impossible. Qin Shi Huang’s nature was cruel; certainly he did not do good, yet this was not of his own will. Truly, he was born to meet this calamity, and served only as the executor of the calamity’s course. If he, as Emperor, could not govern himself, how much less others?” The Immortal Maiden listened and suddenly comprehended. From then on the Master Iron Crutch devoted himself to instructing Zhongli Quan, pointing out all the places where the Maiden was lacking. As both had prior affinities and some accomplishment, it was not long before they acquired substantial skill.

One day the Master Iron Crutch suddenly said to the two: “Fei Chang Fang is coming soon; A Quan, go forth to meet him.” Zhongli Quan was astonished, saying: “I do not know Chang Fang, nor whence he comes; how can I receive him?” The Master Iron Crutch rebuked: “So many words! I tell you to go, so go quickly; why more questions?” Zhongli Quan dared not reply further, and sullenly left the house. In his heart he thought: The Master said Chang Fang has gone North; this time he must be coming South. It is best I go North to meet him. But the northern road is many-fold; I do not know which path he takes; how can this be?

After some hesitation, he suddenly thought the Master’s falsehood had reason; he would not concern himself further, but trust Heaven’s divination, and take the road due North. He resolved thus and set out. From noon till evening he walked, and seeing the darkening sky, found a great mountain blocking the way. To proceed, he must cross the mountain. Zhongli Quan, still a child in nature, did not think of how high or far the mountain was; trusting only to his feet, he knew not how many days it would take to pass the peak. Moreover, he carried no provisions; when hunger came, where could he find food? He also had no weapon; if beasts appeared, he could not rely on his fists alone. These difficulties he did not consider, but gathered courage and stepped forward upon the mountain.

After much walking, the sky was fully dark. Though there was moonlight, the wind was fierce and clouds heavy; only faint rays pierced the layered clouds. He could not distinguish the trees on the mountain, nor determine the directions East, South, West, or North. Zhongli Quan then felt somewhat insufficient in position; but he was a child of great strength and hardiness, having passed many dangers and hardships since birth, never having uttered a complaint or shed a tear. Now he worshipped his immortal Master with great faith, and regardless of how perilous his situation, trusted that his Master would not deceive him. Standing alone in the wild mountain, he looked up at the dim stars and moon, glanced aside at the dark woods and deep hills, but what was worse was hearing from afar the howls of foxes and wolves, the strange cries of uncanny birds, one after another, entering his ears. There was also a piercing, sharp sound he had never heard. After listening a while, he laughed aloud, saying: “I have heard from father that the mountain contains many resentful ghosts — spirits eaten by tigers and leopards. Father once saw them and said their forms were strange and fearful. Alas! I have roamed little, and never seen what sort of thing they were; now, hearing this sound, it must be of that sort. I will see for myself and open my eyes.” Thinking thus, his spirit was greatly raised; though his stomach was somewhat hungry, he felt nothing of it then.

He followed the sound to a mountain hollow, where the moon suddenly shone bright. Beneath the clear moonlight there stood a figure with dishevelled hair and bare feet, seeming human in body but with a round shape, seeming a beast but standing on two feet. It was there bowing repeatedly to the moonlight. Zhongli Quan thought: this must surely be the thing I seek. Since it bows to the moon, does it seek to refine some elixir, to practice some art? Yet how strange that such a hideous thing should aspire to become an immortal — is it not laughable? Thinking this, a laugh actually escaped his lips.

This laugh was no slight matter, for it frightened the monster so that it jumped several times. Zhongli Quan, wishing to see what it would do next, concealed himself behind a large tree, peering through a gap. The monster turned about in confusion, and at length its face was toward Zhongli Quan. The moonlight grew clearer, and the face was plainly visible — not only strange, but most terrible. The monster was human in shape, but had a face covered in white hair, and two emerald black eyes which glanced several times this way. Even Zhongli Quan, bold as a mountain, shuddered. Finding no one to be seen, the monster turned and resumed its work. Zhongli Quan, mischievous as he was, thought: these strange eyes, if I could dig them out and take them to my sister, they would make a pair of earrings to play with. Thinking so, he laughed heartily again.

This laugh proved perilous. Though the monster heard clearly, it ceased searching, turned sidewise, and leapt toward Zhongli Quan. Its gait was unlike ordinary men’s; it seemed a black furry mass driven by a swift wind, and in a moment had passed over the tree, spreading two waxen arms to seize Zhongli Quan. As it came near, he clearly saw its countenance — it was covered with fresh blood, which dripped all the way, emitting a foul stench. Its tongue was a cubit in length, like the image of a strangled ghost said in the world. Zhongli Quan, who had been somewhat fearful, now grew angry and shouted: “What ghostly thing are you? How dare you invade this young lord?”

At this shout, his courage grew. The monster, like encountering a whirlwind, involuntarily retreated some ten steps. Zhongli Quan grew even more confident, and seeing the monster filthy and foul-smelling, did not hesitate to grapple it barehanded. As it retreated, he broke off a branch and before the monster could rush again, swept it away. The monster, realizing it could not resist, shook its head at Zhongli Quan, uttering a harsh cry unlike the previous sounds.

Zhongli Quan laughed: “How fortunate, today I have seen a ghost.” Before he had finished speaking, the ghost turned and fled. Yet Zhongli Quan’s skill in running was no ordinary matter; though not as swift as the art of earth shrinking, it was enough to keep pace with the monster’s rolling flight. In a moment he passed a small hill, and seeing the distance not great, raised his branch and struck at the ghost’s head. With a crash, the ghost dissolved into fragrant smoke, vanishing without trace, and the foul smell disappeared. In an instant, it reappeared beneath a tree, still in the former shape. Kneeling, it bowed and called out to him. Zhongli Quan laughed: “You are a thing three parts not human, seven parts not ghost, yet you know fear of death. Since you know fear, I need not surely quarrel with you; but if you can show me a way out, for I would go north, and you can lead me, I will be grateful. If later I learn from my Master and attain immortal realization, I will surely come to bring you some benefit.”

The monster seemed to understand his words, suddenly rolling over beside Zhongli Quan, bowing its head to the earth with a rattling sound. After a time it rose, and with the wind’s aid rolled northwards. Zhongli Quan followed. At midnight the monster stopped, stretched out its hand thrice pointing north, then turned back and bowed again. Zhongli Quan laughed: “I suppose dawn is near, and you, a ghostly thing, cannot bear the light, so hasten to return?” The monster nodded.

Now Zhongli Quan felt great pity for it, and comforted it thus: “Go then. If ever I make progress, I will not forget your guidance today. But you too must strive to be a loyal, good ghost, and not alarm or harm people, nor trouble travellers — this is most important. Further, whether you be ghost or demon, since you cannot speak, I cannot know, but you must keep a name. When I come to find you, on this mountain peak, when the moon rises, call thrice; you must come out to meet me. Do not fail or the misfortune will be yours alone, not mine. Here we meet on this moonlit wild mountain; I will name you Shan Yue’er — Mountain Moon Child. Remember this well. Go now! I must hasten on to find a place with people, and beg a mouthful to eat, to fill my belly before journeying onwards!”

The monster, hearing this, suddenly pulled at his clothes. Zhongli Quan laughed: “Could it be you have prepared me some food?” The monster nodded. Zhongli Quan was greatly pleased: “If so, excellent! Go quickly and bring it; I will wait here for you.” The monster flew off. Zhongli Quan laughed: “This ghostly thing is rather amusing.” So he wandered alone in the mountain, looking about until near dawn. The moon hid behind dark clouds, and the mountain scenery was no longer visible. He felt anxious for the monster.

As he hesitated, he suddenly heard a rattling strange sound, and laughed: “Surely it has hurried back.” Before he finished speaking, a whirlwind stirred at his feet, and looking down, he saw a black furry thing crouched beside him. Zhongli Quan asked: “Friend, have you brought me the food?” The monster cried several times, and holding up a thing in a furry black hand, placed it in Zhongli Quan’s palm: two barley cakes, already hard beyond bearing, and in the other hand a bamboo jar of water.

Zhongli Quan laughed joyfully: “You have gone to much trouble. Pity that we cannot speak, else you might tell me if there is any nearby habitation.” The monster shook its head, spreading both hands wide, seeming to say there are villages, but not near. Zhongli Quan understood his meaning, and was about to question further, but the monster said no more, bowed, and flew away like the wind. Zhongli Quan sighed: “He is a ghostly thing; how can he bear the daylight? I, unthinking, have taken his kindness and yet would cling and entangle, lest I miss his time — would that not be my fault?”

Reader, the faculties of men are ever limited. Zhongli Quan was but a child, having walked a whole day and night without rest; his stomach was hungry, his mouth dry, and naturally he was near collapse. Having water and barley cakes, he forgot his worries, found a big stone and sat down, consuming the cakes and water. Looking at the sky, it was still dark; he laughed: “Disturbed by this black ghost all night, yet dawn has not come. Let me rest a while longer before going.” Saying so, he lay down upon the stone and fell fast asleep. Children, when once asleep, are deep sleepers; no pushing or beating can rouse them easily. Zhongli Quan’s sleep lasted until dusk, when the sky grew dark again. He turned, sat up, rubbed his eyes, looked up, and was greatly startled: “How have I slept a whole day? This is a great loss of time! If I miss Chang Fang, how shall I face the Master?” Thinking thus, he was overwhelmed with anxiety. As he hesitated, suddenly a fierce wind arose; sand and stones flew in a mighty whirlwind.

Zhongli Quan, having since childhood mingled with beasts, understood the situation well. Seeing the rising wind, he knew it was no common wind, but the coming of tiger or leopard. He laughed, saying: “These beasts are too unlucky. Had I still been asleep an hour ago, ten bodies would have been devoured; they must suffer for waiting until I rose. Is this not their deserved misfortune?” Though he said this, he did not dare be overbold. He roused his spirit, grasped a handful of stones, and prepared to strike the beast’s eyes first should it come unawares — this was the family’s ancestral art of hundred-step throwing, sure to hit the mark. Zhongli Quan was ever brave beyond his years; beasts like tigers and leopards were no matter to him. Yet such preparedness was the first time; he knew he was a guest in strange lands, and vigil must be kept.

But the affairs of the world are most hard to foresee; the more cautious you are, the more unforeseen misfortune occurs in such watchfulness. Zhongli Quan waited long, when suddenly he heard a whoosh behind. Hastily turning, he saw a small figure lifted by the beast behind, and borne away on clouds, soaring into the air.

His fate is unknown; we await the next chapter to unfold.
