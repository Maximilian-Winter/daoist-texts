# Chapter 62: A Python Clambers Between Two Mountains, Cleaving the Rock to Form a Path; Alone He Seeks the Great Way, Forsaking Life for the Tao

Now it happened that Cai He, beholding upon the high mountain two suddenly appearing red lights, was much astonished in his heart. He could not but raise his head and look, and then he clearly saw that these were not lights, but a great serpent of peerless greatness and unmeasured length. The red lights which he saw were its eyes. The head of the serpent was larger than a bushel; its girth was ten times about; its length stretched ten li. Its head rested upon this mountain, its belly upon the opposite peak, some five li apart. Cai He, having studied from childhood, had heard men tell strange tales of loaches ten zhang long, which swallowed whole a fat pig. Then he deemed this a marvel, and was afraid to sleep at night. Who could have thought that what he now saw was more wild and strange and incredible? It even surpassed the loach that swallowed the pig. This was no wonder that he was greatly frightened and fell down on the ground. But he had now resolved to seek immortality, and had already set life aside; hence his courage was a hundredfold greater than before. After a moment's gathering of his mind, he sprang to his feet and cried aloud, “Cai He, Cai He, thou seeker of immortality and visitor of the Way, though this serpent be ten li long and ten times about, though it be but a little crooked worm, though it cover heaven and earth and overturn seas and rivers as a true dragon, yet fear it not. Go, go, it do its work, I will go mine; what is there to fear?”

Taking large strides, he pressed forward. Yet in his heart he could not forget the little crooked worm; his small heart beat fast and unbidden. Yet he reproved himself, “Think not of it, think not of it; to think of it is not the part of a man.” But though he spoke thus, his little mind obeyed him not, but rolled about in fearful and confused thoughts. In such mood his legs would not obey his will; he walked, but with faltering steps, ill at ease. While he struggled desperately onward, the two great lamps on the mountain seemed to know his course; suddenly they turned, and shot their rays this way, shining upon Cai He as two lightning torches; with them came a rank and loathsome stench, which entered his nostrils in waves. This was not all: the monster, as if bent on opposing him, suddenly rushed forward with its huge head; there was a great crash in the air, and a great thing stretched across half the sky, its huge head resting on a great ancient tree ten zhang distant from Cai He’s body.

Cai He was already faint with fear, and had no leisure to examine where the tail rested. The ancient tree, with trunk and boughs, swayed as if about to break, showing the serpent’s strength. At this moment Cai He was clearly under the serpent’s neck, its body raised no more than a zhang and a half from the ground; with a slight stretch it could crush him. A mere sneeze would shake the body and hurl him leagues away. More fearful still, the serpent's eyes faced forward, showing it had a purpose of traveling the same way as Cai He. Now the only way was to hasten back by the path he came; if he pressed forward, he would surely be swallowed.

Sobered somewhat, Cai He turned the matter over in his mind. In such peril, to save his life, he must for the present retreat to some place broad and level, sit out the night, and await the dawn for further counsel. But suddenly he remembered the bold words he had spoken at Mount Tai. Though his master and Yueying were not by his side, yet having made such boasts, and the road before him fraught with danger, if he should flee at the first peril, how could he reach Mount Wangwu? This would not only offend his master and bring ridicule from Yueying and Yang Ren, but his cultivation would never advance. Besides, life and death are indeed decreed by Heaven. If fate ordained a violent death, then though he fled, the serpent might turn and pursue; his small body would be but a morsel. Or he might fall to beasts or robbers, dying not by serpent but by their hands. But if fate spared him, and there remained hope of becoming immortal, then if he could but quietly and stealthily pass beneath the serpent’s body, would such a huge creature be so careless as to lose so small a morsel?

Thinking thus, his courage grew. And a childlike fancy arose within him; he raised his hands to Heaven and, with reverence, prayed: “Your humble disciple Lan Cai He is resolved to cultivate immortality, and fears no peril. If the Great Way be to be attained, and there be hope of ascension, may I safely pass this little crooked worm’s peril. If the road hold no hope, then it is not meet that I should toil in vain all my life. All men die; who may claim exemption? Death by violence or natural death, what difference? Early death or late death, no reason. I pray the gods send their will, and bid the old serpent swallow me; then I would lie in its belly as a little roundworm, without complaint.”

Thus saying, he let his hands fall, fixed his mind, and strode forward. But no sooner had he taken a few steps than the crooked worm showed no courtesy. Whether it was yawning or stretching cannot be told; but a great dark mass fell from the air, head still on the tree and tail still on the mountain; the long middle section lay across the ground, blocking Cai He’s way.

This sight crushed the courage he had just regained, making it smaller than a yellow bean; he trembled, uttering, “Heaven! Heaven! Is it truly hopeless for me to cultivate immortality, and am I to become a roundworm in the serpent’s belly? Then why did my master bring me here to die in vain? Why, if he wished my death, did he rescue me from the hands of the evil uncle? Master, you are indeed a trickster!”

He wept a while, then looked again at the serpent’s body, which moved little and barred no further. Retreat was still possible and safe. But Cai He, as a cultivator of the Way, must practice self-restrain and solitude. Though life hung on a breath, he held fast to his vow, with no thought of retreat, and resolved to find means to pass beneath the serpent’s body.

The dusk deepened; no light shone in all the wilderness. His only guide was the pair of great red lamps of the crooked worm. As before, the serpent’s eyes faced forward, traveling in the same direction as Cai He. The two flashes of light illuminated his path clearly. In boredom, a childish thought arose: “If I could become brothers with this crooked worm, I might rely on its light to guide me safely to the village.” He knew it was a childish fancy and that such good fortune was unlikely. After a long while, the serpent stirred slightly, frightening the birds from branches on mountain and valley. Cai He too was terrified, crouching low to await death in its belly.

Sure enough, after this slight movement, the serpent made a great stir. Suddenly a fierce wind arose; trees shook and dust flew; stones struck Cai He’s head, leaving lumps. He was terrified beyond thought, caring little for these small pains.

Unexpectedly, the serpent leapt high into the air, rising over ten zhang from the ground. Cai He then saw the whole body; it was not as large as the celestial dragons he had imagined. His hope for life revived. He silently prayed for heavenly aid, stretching out a hand to grasp the creature to Heaven. To escape now would be a sign of future attainment of the Way. But the serpent did not linger or meet with any god’s hand; it comfortably leapt down. The two red lamps no longer shone east or west, but fixed solely upon Cai He. Needless to say, the little roundworm within had acknowledged Cai He as a new comrade. This fright overcame Cai He more than when first he saw the great serpent; beyond submission to be devoured, he had no hope. Yet as the serpent neared the ground, it suddenly leapt with force, landing between two mountains, cleaving the twin peaks to form a great road. This road led straight to the mountain village.

For centuries this mountain path remained passable. The elders called it the “Divine Python Pass.” The village at its mouth came to be known as “Python Wandering Pass.” But after the Tang and Song dynasties, the pass was depopulated, for it became the haunt of demons, and was sealed by Lü Dongbin with a pellet of earth; no one could pass. Yet to this day the locals know the name and the story. But that is for another time.

Now the serpent was wedged between the mountains, unable to move, and it struggled mightily, shaking the mountains, stones, and trees. Were it to break loose, Cai He beneath would be crushed either by serpent or by falling rocks. But he cared not, thinking that as the serpent’s body was confined, if he could but be swift, he might escape. The serpent’s body twisted wildly, its black eyes growing larger and fiercer with flame.

Cai He had no time to watch the serpent’s body, but sought to seize this chance to escape. Whether by Heaven’s grace or sign of immortality’s approach, he rallied his spirit and courage. First he looked closely at the serpent’s body, but dared not glance back at its eyes, fearing their fierce look would chill his heart. Judging the serpent’s body thick, he resolved to leap over it, saving much trouble. Otherwise he must seek another path, around the serpent’s head; but that would add three or five li, and the serpent’s sharp eyes would not endure it, and might chase him. After careful thought, the leap was the only way. Being simple in mind, he made up his plan without hesitation. He gathered his robe, closed his eyes, and with all his strength leapt, landing upon the serpent’s belly. The serpent’s body was slippery, and he could not stand; he slipped and fell to the side path. The serpent seemed to feel the touch, and from its head came a low buzzing. The foul stench was unbearable. Though it had been present before, Cai He had not noticed, being absorbed in flight for his life. Now that he was safe and calmer, the stench grew stronger, and he felt sick; vomiting much, his body softened and his mind grew faint; his courage was gone, and he could not take another step. He lay beside the serpent’s belly, unconscious.

The serpent saw its morsel still beside it; it leapt upward, freeing its body from the mountain cleft, casting its tail from west to southeast. A great wind roared along its path.

Many ancient trees were felled and broken, their lives lost. But we need not speak of them. As for Cai He, small and frail, under the watchful eyes of the great red lamps, two drops of saliva fell from his mouth into a low hollow, forming a small lake. The fainted Cai He lay soaked therein. The stench, more than the buzzing before, seemed to have a sharpness that revived the dying man from death’s door.

Opening his eyes, he knew the great serpent was relentless, pursuing him bitterly. But he knew not whence came the cold, slimy water flowing so suddenly. He lay exhausted, unable to stir, while the serpent’s huge mouth slowly approached. In a moment he would fulfill the prophecy and become a roundworm in its belly. He sighed and called out his master and Yuejie: “Always I hoped to succeed in the Way and hear your teachings again. Who knew that before reaching Mount Wangwu, I should lose my life, disappointing your expectations?” The serpent’s mouth opened and closed near him; it winked with its little eyes and said, “Good fellow, I have long meant to make you my morsel. I regret my small size may not fill your great belly, and I am sorry.”

Before finishing, the serpent’s mouth was over his head; a long blood-red tongue stretched out three feet, first licking his tender cheek, while drops of saliva fell like twin waterfalls from the mountain. The low land could not contain them, and they overflowed the plain. Poor Cai He was wholly submerged. Darkness deepened, silence reigned; save for the two fiery eyes, no other light or living thing was near. The wind howled, the water moaned; a desolate scene, as if pitying this innocent boy laid to rest in the serpent’s belly. Cai He, feeling the tongue upon his cheek, lost all spirit and feeling, and knew no sorrow.

Gentle readers, lent your pity to Cai He and close your eyes to imagine the scene; surely you would sigh thrice and shed a measure of tears. Yet the author advises you, though you may weep and sigh again and again, do not lay down the book. Have you not heard the ancient saying, “From utter peril comes life; from disaster comes good fortune”? Though Cai He’s case seems most perilous, know this: some parts are cunningly devised by the author to rouse your spirits. Being one of the Eight Immortals and under celestial protection, how could he die so easily?

If you doubt, take up the book again and read on. At the moment of his doom, a great voice shouted in midair: “Impudent python, show no disrespect! Speedily deliver Cai He to the earth temple of the village. His merits shall offset his faults.” The serpent answered with a hum. Before the words ended, it retracted its long tongue into its mouth. Suddenly it straightened its body from its former coil. Cai He knew a deity was come to protect him; his heart rejoiced, his mind cleared. Then from the air came the words: “Cai He is devoted to the Way, with resolve and breadth; worthy and beloved. Let him ride upon the python’s back, which will convey him to the village; no hesitation is needed.” Then silence.

Cai He heard the words but saw no divine figure; he looked upward and prayed with reverence. Looking down, he saw the python lying on the ground, as a mount awaiting a rider, docile in shape. Cai He feared it no more; he sprang up and clasped the serpent’s body. It was icy and slippery, uncomfortable to hold. As he wondered, the serpent set forth swiftly as an arrow, steadier than a boat, passing through thickets with rustling sounds. In a short time the serpent stopped, raising its head to nod to Cai He. Looking forward, Cai He saw that they had reached the earth temple indicated by the deity. Hastily he dismounted, bowed deeply, and stroked its body, saying, “Fellow Wayfarer, thanks to thee for carrying me here; but thy body is too cold. When I prosper, I shall send thee a cotton robe.”

Thus speaking, he saw the serpent nod once more and then turned back along the path. Perhaps ashamed of its clumsiness, fearing to harm other living things or frighten Cai He, it departed. Cai He watched it go; dawn was breaking and his body was weary beyond words. He approached the temple and knocked softly. After a while the mountain gate opened, and forth came a woman of surpassing beauty, peerless in grace. Cai He, seeing her, was struck dumb.

Whether Cai He was lost in thought for her beauty, or for some other cause, we shall see in the next chapter.
