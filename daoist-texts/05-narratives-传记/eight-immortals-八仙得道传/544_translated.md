# Chapter 76: Lan Caihe’s Long Song Rebukes the Worldly Visitor; Fei Changfang’s Short-sightedness Leads Him Astray

It is said that Changfang, after much toil and hardship, climbed to the summit of White Cloud Mountain. Originally he had seen from afar the ancient temple towering in grandeur, standing amidst the deep forest; but when he reached the mountain’s peak and raised his eyes to look, the ancient temple was nowhere to be found. Changfang was struck with both fear and astonishment, and he feared the immortals might be angry at his insincerity, having deliberately hidden the temple to signify refusal. Musing thus, he could not help but wail to heaven and earth, bursting into bitter tears.

After weeping for a time, he glanced at the sky; night was drawing on, the dim yellow light of the setting sun slanted through the trees, mingling with the withered branches and yellow leaves, all reflecting one another, showing a melancholy hue. At this moment, Changfang truly felt that before him there was no path forward, behind him no way back, and he stood alone in desolation, looking about with hesitation.

Having wept his fill, he cast himself upon a towering crag, his eyes turned toward the vast sky, and uttered a long, mournful howl. The birds in the woods were frightened and scattered in flight. Changfang fell into deep reflection: “Life among men is truly as a passing guest in a floating world, dwelling like a wayfarer in a hostile inn. When one’s appointed time arrives, all things are at an end. Upon careful thought, I know not why. Reflecting on my own life, I have suffered many hardships; having grown, I studied the arts under Wang Yizhi’s tutelage, and with difficulty attained some skill, though the Way remains distant. Later, inheriting my master’s office, I had even less time to cultivate myself. By fortune I met three immortal elders, believing that the obscure paths could be traversed and the Great Way attained. Yet, after trials and dangers, after arduous effort in following their commands to reach this mountain peak, I do not know by what offence I have displeased the immortals, that even the ancient temple was transformed and vanished — a sure sign they resolutely refuse to reveal themselves. Having missed this chance, when and where shall I meet the immortals again? If I cannot meet immortals, then I cannot attain the Way. Death is inevitable; rather than be burdened by mortal cares, it is better to seek release early.”

So thinking, his mind involuntarily turned askew. Suddenly he stood up shouting: “Since the immortals will not receive their disciple, and life in the world has no great benefit, for man death inevitably comes. I now wish no longer to be a vain mortal, but here to bid farewell to the three immortals and go to the netherworld.” Saying so, he knelt and kowtowed several times. Just as he was about to hang himself, suddenly he heard singing behind the mountain. The song went:

> “The ignorant seek the cloud road,  
> But the cloud road is lost and without track.  
> The mountains are high and perilous,  
> The ravines wide and few are delicate.  
> Green barriers before and behind,  
> White clouds to west and east.  
> If you would know where the cloud road lies,  
> The clouds themselves are in the void.”

Then another verse:

> “I see men in the world, born and then dead.  
> Yesterday still two persons,  
> Vigour spilled across the bosom of the scholar.  
> Now past seventy, strength exhausted and form wasted.  
> Like spring flowers, open in the morning, fade by night.”

Another:

> “White crane carries bitter flowers,  
> A thousand li as one breath.  
> Intending to go to Penglai Mountain,  
> Carrying these for provisions.  
> Unmet by falling feathers,  
> Parting from the flock, heart mourns.  
> Seeks the old nest,  
> Wife and children no longer known.”

Another:

> “Drooping willows dark as smoke,  
> Flying flowers drifting as hail.  
> Husband dwells in the state of separation,  
> Wife in the county of longing.  
> Each at opposite ends of the world,  
> When shall they meet again?  
> Sending word to the bright moon tower,  
> Do not harbor the pair of swallows in flight.”

Another:

> “Chestnut horse with coral whip,  
> Galloping the Luoyang road.  
> Pity the handsome youth,  
> Unbelieving that age will come.  
> White hair is bound to grow,  
> Red cheeks cannot last.  
> But look to Mount Bei Yin,  
> It is indeed Penglai Isle.”

Another:

> “My aim is to seek the Way of the Tao Lun,  
> Tao Lun is always close at hand.  
> Often meeting the guest Du Liao,  
> Each time speaking with the Chan visitors.  
> Talking of profound things on moonlit nights,  
> Exploring principles from dawn to morning.  
> All affairs vanish without trace,  
> Then one knows the beginning and end of man.”

Another:

> “My hand writes broad and bold,  
> My body is strong and tall.  
> Born as a body with limits,  
> Dead as a nameless ghost.  
> Since old times so many,  
> What can you do now?  
> Come to White Cloud,  
> I will sing you the Purple Grass Song.”

Another:

> “The mighty Yellow River water,  
> Flows eastward without cease.  
> Forever unseen is its clarity,  
> All men’s lives have their limits.  
> If you would come to White Cloud,  
> How shall you grow wings to fly?  
> Wings are only for hair at temples,  
> Walking and standing require effort.”

Another:

> “I now have a jacket,  
> Neither gauze nor fine brocade.  
> Pray tell what colour it is?  
> Neither red nor purple.  
> Summer it is worn as shirt,  
> Winter as quilt and cover.  
> Winter and summer alternate,  
> Used so year after year.”

Another:

> “Worldly affairs are ever so,  
> Greed of heart ceases not.  
> Hearing all the names of heaven and earth,  
> When shall one find rest?  
> Four seasons wither and change,  
> Eight festivals rush like flowing stream.  
> To repay the lord of the great mansion,  
> Riding the sun’s ox across the open ground.”

Another:

> “On the high mountain’s peak,  
> Looking about to boundless ends.  
> Sitting alone unknown,  
> The solitary moon shines on the cold spring.  
> The spring has no moon,  
> The moon is free in the blue sky.  
> Singing this one song,  
> The song is originally Chan.”

Another:

> “An old woman in the eastern house,  
> Rich for three or five years.  
> Once poorer than I,  
> Now laughs at my lack of money.  
> She laughs at my being behind,  
> I laugh at her being ahead.  
> Laughing at each other not knowing,  
> East again and west again.”

Hearing these songs, Changfang was greatly amazed and said, “These songs are no common lay, they bear great immortal significance. Could it be that the immortal elders yet dwell on the mountain and have not gone afar? Surely they pity my foolish heart and still wish to save me.” Thereupon he prostrated himself on the ground and cried aloud, “Immortal masters, where are you? I, your disciple Fei Changfang, have come up the mountain in obedience to your command but have seen none of you. Now I am prepared to end my life here to thank you. If you still find me worthy, I beg that you manifest your power, so that I may behold your countenances before I die. Even in the netherworld I will close my eyes content.” While he lamented thus, the singer stepped forth from behind the mountain opposite, climbing the hill step by step. Seeing Changfang, he stared silently and asked, “Sir, you are indeed a strange man. You come to this high mountain and perform such great ceremony — is this not strange?” Changfang looked up and saw that although the man was not one of the three immortals, he bore the air and bearing of an immortal, with a graceful and refined countenance. Moreover, it was dusk deep in the mountains, and to walk and sing alone was surely not the manner of a common man. Perhaps he was a friend or disciple of the immortals, specially sent to look upon me.

Having kowtowed several times, Changfang rose and said, “Honoured elder, you must indeed be sent by the immortals to assist a disciple, is it not? Just now I overheard your singing and knew you were no ordinary person or worldly man.” The man smiled, returning the salutation, and asked the reason for Changfang’s sorrow. He sighed, “So it is; no wonder you are distressed. But as for the three immortals, I know something of them. They do not refuse to see you, nor bear any hatred. They know that you have braved dangers and come here lightly, and are very glad indeed. But this meeting is your first great barrier to transcendence and sainthood, and may not be so easily passed. First, you surely have a wife at home, and whether you can sever ties is uncertain; secondly, your courage is great, but whether you harbour any desire for ease and trickery is unknown.”

On hearing this, Changfang suddenly understood. The immortals refusing to grant an audience was indeed to test his use of the earth-shrinking art on the mountainside. This man’s words plainly referred to this matter; thus he must be surely sent by the immortals. Hastening, he begged to know his name. The man laughed, “You and I are chance acquaintances, soon to part ways. If you really were to die now, it would be a case of my life and your death; there is no need to exchange names. If in future fate allows us to meet, we shall surely know each other without names.” Changfang dared not ask further, and confessed that he had been somewhat negligent. He added, “As to affections of wife and children, I trust I can cast them aside. Could you, honoured elder, convey my repentance to the immortals, with sincere resolve to amend and be accepted?”

He smiled and nodded, saying, “Cultivation depends on oneself, not on others. If one can set the will pure and strive unremittingly, the Great Way will be in the heart, needing no external search. Otherwise, daily talk of seeking a teacher and constantly seeking the Way is but self-deception and self-disgrace — what good can it do?” Changfang was indeed very intelligent, having studied long under Yizhi, and recently received his methods, making progress. Hearing this, how could he not comprehend? In a moment, his mind was as if bathed in fresh clear water, indescribably joyous and refreshing. Reflecting again on the verses, he opened his eyes and looked at the man, suddenly enlightened, certain that this was one of the three immortals of the day before yesterday. What he now said was the very beginning of the Way they permitted, like the first chapter of their doctrine.

He prostrated himself anew, saying, “Disciple understands that effort must be grounded firmly, without the slightest insincerity. Seeking the Way requires all attachments to be silent, admitting no entanglement. May I ask, honoured immortal, is this so?” The man smiled, “To keep feet firmly on the ground is the first and most difficult thing. Easy to say, hard to do; easy to say and hard to fulfill — that is called consistency of word and deed. The teachings of Confucianism, Buddhism, and Taoism all share this principle, which is harder than anything else. No matter how eloquent you are, if not seen in practice, what is the difference from empty words? Empty words are insincerity. Those who are insincere are abhorred by the immortal families; how can they learn the Way?”

Hearing this, Changfang bowed low. The man smiled and asked, “Where do you intend to go now?”

Changfang mournfully said, “Disciple came only to pay respects to the three immortals and gain instruction. Not seeing them, I have instead met an immortal elder’s clear words, and my mind is opened. I now resolve to renounce the world and seek the Way myself. If the heart is not resolute, daily empty talk is useless. Even with the will to cultivate the Way, if there be fears and attachments, fondness for things not resolute to abandon, speaking today and tomorrow, saying this year and next — that is self-deception. Such a one is not only insincere but greatly despised. Those who can firmly resolve, once enlightened, decide at once; deciding, they turn back no more. This is in accordance with the steps of cultivation and the possibility of becoming immortal. Now that I have thoroughly awakened, if I do not resolve to cultivate immortality, but only cling to the dust of the world, delaying the years, fearing that time will not wait for me, that the chance is lost, and the future will be empty, and only the subject of laughter — how futile!”

The man smiled and nodded, “If so, can you resolve to abandon your beloved wife and child, and all delightful things of the world, beginning now, and practise asceticism and seek the Way?” Changfang kowtowed, “As you command.” The man smiled, “Though so, your love for your wife is good, and your young son is handsome and clever, like a jade ball; such a joy. Will you also abandon them all? That would be too cruel.” Changfang answered firmly, “Only those who are deeply attached can forget attachment; only by forgetting today can true affection come tomorrow. Do not try to test or try me further. I have laid down the butcher’s knife and resolved to advance, loving nothing.” The man said, “Since so, I will make you a small device, so that your family may believe you have died, thus ending their anxiety; then I will take you to meet the three immortals. Is this well?” Changfang rejoiced, “Such kindness is most appreciated.” The man produced a pill, saying, “Swallow this; it will remove hunger and clear the eyes. After taking it, you can go a year without food, and discern objects even in the dark.” Changfang accepted and swallowed it, immediately feeling invigorated and his vision clear. Night had fallen and the moon was dim, yet when he opened his eyes he could see the path and discern objects almost as well as by day, and he joyfully gave thanks.

The man bade him fetch a dry branch from a tree opposite and place it upon the ground. Changfang asked, “What does this mean?” The man smiled, “This will serve as your substitute for a while.” He muttered incantations over the branch and shouted fiercely. The branch vanished at once, and in its place stood a figure dressed and bearing the likeness of Fei Changfang, standing beside the true Changfang. Changfang asked, “Is this the substitute for my feigning death?” The man laughed, “I have no time to send him off. I will find someone to help.” Summoning the local earth spirit of the mountain, he commanded him to take the false Changfang to the gate of a local earth temple outside the west city. There, the spirit was to go in a dream to Fei Changfang’s wife, telling her to lead the children and others to collect the body. The earth spirit accepted the command. The man then blew upon the false Changfang, and the earth spirit pulled him along, saying, “Come with me.” Strange indeed, the false Changfang followed like a living person down the mountain. Changfang looked on with mixed feeling — some emotion and some amusement. After a long silent reverie, the man laughed and asked, “How is it? Do you miss those at home? Honestly tell me, if you return thus, your wife will doubt and suspect enough; think when you went away.” Changfang replied, “Only two days ago.” The man laughed heartily, “This is the immortals’ realm, where time is not as in the mortal world. Ask below and you will find you have been here several months. If you doubt it, just attend to your own body, is it not first hot then cold, then gradually warm?” Changfang, hearing this, recalled that when he left home it was the early autumn weather with a single light jacket.

When arriving at the mountain it was very cold. Not finding the three immortals, he grew anxious but was not much troubled by the cold. When meeting the man and discussing profound principles, he felt warmer, for now the weather had changed to spring again, which greatly surprised him. He asked, “Is this White Cloud Mountain the dwelling of immortals?” The man laughed, “Immortals have no fixed abode, nor do they hold property as mortals do, needing no great space. In short, the blessed lands and cave heavens are all within your heart. The more sincere your heart, the nearer you are to the immortal realm. The more false your heart, the farther from the immortal village. Think again, from the time you first climbed the mountain, how did the weather change? And upon reaching the summit, how did the weather then change? You must know that mountains have no height or low; it depends on the sincerity of your heart. The higher you ascend the mountain, the more sincere your heart, and the nearer to the immortal realm. So at first the mountain slope is still the dusty world; the higher you climb, the longer time seems than in the mortal world — such is the principle.”

Changfang, hearing this, reflected on the warmth and cold of the past two days and found every word to be true, especially the phrase that the immortal realm lies in the heart, which awakened him greatly. After long thought, his heart gained a further layer of enlightenment. He begged the man to accompany him to seek the three immortals. The man agreed, smiling and asked, “You have the earth-shrinking art; would it not be easy for us to descend the mountain?” Changfang, recalling their former discussion, hastened to say, “Disciple’s heart in seeking the Way is sincere, and does not dare to show off small skills or seek ease and cleverness. It is better to follow you down the mountain on foot.” The man laughed, “There is no need to trouble thus. Come, even with cloud-riding and earth-shrinking it takes half a day to reach. Since you do not wish to use earth-shrinking, come with me to ascend the sky.” He blew a breath under their feet, and a rainbow cloud appeared, enveloping them. Then he shouted, and the cloud rose high into the heavens, and together they ascended.

After half an hour, the man pointed with his hand, and two clouds descended straight to the earth. From the cloud the man said, “Immortals, Buddhas, and sages cannot forget their flesh and bone ties. Now your home is in sight; lower your head and look upon your wife — how fares she now?” Changfang hastily said, “Honoured elder, do not jest with your disciple. First, my foundation is shallow; though I have resolved to become a recluse, this is but a faint strength. When I see my wife again, I will surely be troubled by worldly thoughts. Second, if my wife sees me, she will weep and cling to me and not let me go. Would this not hinder my great cause?”

The man laughed, “You are in the air, they are in the mortal realm. If I do not let them see you, how can they see you? As for your own stirring of heart, that depends on your own strength of will. If you force yourself to be a recluse, then seeing your family and being moved, there is no need to cultivate immortality.” Saying this, he lowered the cloud, opened his eyes, and looked down; the scenery was clear below, and indeed they had reached Changfang’s home. Most strange was that though Changfang was in the clouds, he could hear the cries and laments of the family below. His wife had received the body of the false Changfang, and it was just past the second watch. His wife recalled past events and wept wildly, as if dead and revived. Changfang’s son kept calling, “Father come back, father come back. If you do not return, mother will surely die of grief.”

Changfang heard each word, and his heart was pierced. Though he tried to maintain a composed face toward the man, tears streamed down his cheeks, soaking his clothes. The man said nothing, but smiled faintly. Changfang was overwhelmed with grief and pain, paying no heed. The man summoned the cloud, and they ascended again. Changfang’s eyes kept turning back toward his home, as if stepping forward and looking back at every step. From then, the man’s words and Changfang’s answers often became discordant, of which Changfang was unaware; the man, however, laughed unceasingly.

Before two hours had passed, the man said, “Now we must cross the sea; let us descend.” Changfang was alarmed, “Have the three immortals all gone overseas?” The man nodded silently, then pointed downward, and the cloud shot down like a falling star. Changfang was unused to such travel and somewhat fearful; he closed his eyes, feeling his feet on solid ground and a slight tremor in his body. Opening his eyes, he saw that indeed they had come to the seashore, standing beside the man.

The man beckoned to the sea, saying, “Bring a boat, bring a boat.” Calling several times, a small boat appeared from nowhere. Now the sea was tempestuous, white waves raging. From afar the boat was no larger than a cart; drawing near it appeared smaller, until at the shore it was no bigger than a large banana leaf. Moreover, the boatman occupied half the space, leaving barely room for a foot, much less two passengers. Changfang was struck with fear and wonder, not knowing what to make of it. Hesitating, the man leapt aboard and stood beside the boatman. The remaining space was even smaller and narrower.

The man beckoned repeatedly, saying, “Come quickly, come quickly, the boat is about to depart.” Changfang hesitated briefly and asked, “Honoured elder, there are many of us; how can such a tiny boat carry us? And with such fierce wind and waves, is the voyage not dangerous?”

The man continued beckoning. Suddenly a great wave swept over and engulfed man and boat beneath the sea. Changfang, unskilled in water and seeing no one about to help, could not call for aid. He sighed for a while, then sought a path, regardless of direction, and pressed forward hastily. Unbeknownst to him, the beach stretched hundreds of li; after some time his body was exhausted. Looking back, he was still at the shore with no end in sight. He rested on the ground and thought that if he used the earth-shrinking art, he could reach the marketplace in one leap; but he wished to inquire for better passage to cross the sea by boat. Yet resolved to cultivate the Way, he must seek the immortals. Having said he would not take shortcuts, how could he now change his original mind? Standing in such a vast wilderness with no shore nor resting place, he knew not how long he must walk before seeing any habitation. His heart was deeply troubled.

He thought again: the immortal elder who came with him — could he be one of the three immortals? Why then not travel by cloud, but choose this little boat to cross the sea, risking death in the fish’s belly? How pitiful, how lamentable!

Suddenly he recalled that the immortal elder possessed such power that he could not drown. There must be some reason in this, and he must not be caught in a great deception. Thinking thus, he became dazed. After a while, as if enlightened, he suddenly leapt up and cried, “Alas! I have fallen into the immortal master’s snare!”

What matter this snare was, remains to be seen in the next chapter.
