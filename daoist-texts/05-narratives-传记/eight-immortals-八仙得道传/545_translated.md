# Chapter 77: Seeking Immortals but Returning; When Immortals Preside; Mastering Spirits Yet Bewildered by Spirits

Meanwhile, Changfang was greatly perplexed, having mistaken the immortal who came with him for one who had drowned in the sea; he himself considered it a great fortune that he had not boarded the boat with him, thus escaping with his life. Had he rashly boarded, he would long since have been ground and whirled away within the belly of some great fish or huge tortoise. As he walked on, thinking thus all the way, he journeyed on and on. After some distance, he looked back and saw still a stretch of seashore; the place where the immortal had drowned was clearly but an arrow’s flight away. Looking ahead, there was boundless and shoreless sea, gazing afar for a thousand li, and no sign of human habitation was in sight. A thought suddenly struck his heart; he suddenly perceived that this immortal was not one without the power to divide the waters and control the waves, and moreover, having attained an incorruptible body, how could he perish in the sea?

Again he considered that the immortal had been travelling on clouds all along; why now cross the sea? Moreover, there was no boat upon the sea; at his summons one would surely have come to receive him. Common vessels, when seen from afar, grow smaller, and as one approaches grow larger; yet this boat was the reverse of that principle. These matters were extremely strange. Further, that little boat seemed so narrow that one could scarcely stand upon it, yet when another person boarded, it did not appear any narrower. The immortal had already gone aboard and was beckoning him thither; did he not fear death? Or did he not reckon his own seeking of death as sufficient, and yet would drag him along as companion? A thousand doubts arose without end; all tended to prove that these were phantasms conjured by the immortal. Even looking down from the sky to his home, he could hear the lamentations of his wife—this was impossible. So he thought these were all mysteries wrought by the venerable one himself. Yet he who climbs mountains fears not the perils and obstacles, nor does he much heed the crossing of waters; though in climbing he is mindful first of daring the danger, and having the art of contracting the earth to defend himself, unlike crossing the sea and treading the waves without resort to magic arts, his heart cannot but distinguish the easy from the hard, the smooth from the rugged; yet from the immortal’s standpoint, lack of sincerity is but one and the same.

Just now he had repeatedly declared, 'Without sincerity there is no need to pursue the Way.' It was evident that he had been rejected by the immortal, and no further chance of entering the Way remained. Now reflecting, not only was this companion immortal one of the three met, but even the boatman who steered was surely one of them. The sayings that immortals reside beyond the seas were all before his eyes. No wonder that on the mountain the immortal repeatedly said, "The immortal realm is in the heart-field." Yet though he understood the principle, he failed to carry it into practice. It seemed the immortal had foreseen him from the beginning, and so spoke words of the difficulty of practice. He thought that having met the three true immortals with great difficulty, braved many dangers, and ascended to the summit of the White Cloud Mountain; then by the immortal master’s art, had severed the longing for his family, and fancied his resolve to be firm; having gained the immortal’s pity and guidance, he expected to succeed in cultivation and hope for ascension. Who could have known that in a moment, still for lack of resolute cultivation, he would be discarded by the immortal master! No need to say that great error was done and regret was too late; how could he face his old home and kin henceforth? Thus at this stage of life, he truly felt there was nothing to be done. Though he had risked death on White Cloud Mountain, it was without cause that the immortal master awakened him from error, and he had followed thither. Now he thought it better to return and die; yet even if the immortal master knew, he would not surely come to rescue. So thinking, he burst forth into loud lamentation.

At this moment there was suddenly heard a woman’s voice from the air, crying, "Fei Changfang, thou hast not renounced thy heart’s desire, nor is thy heart firm in the Way; if thou forcest thyself to pursue the hermit’s life, it will be hard to reach the end. Better to return soon and enjoy the blessings of the human world for several centuries. Be careful of thy duties, be humble and gentle toward all things; if thou canst thus end well, thou mayest become an earthly immortal. Otherwise, thy master Wang Yizhi will be thy example. The misfortunes of the past are not far away; be not negligent nor careless. This place is within the borders of Mount Penglai in Shandong, three hundred li thence is a market town, to which thou mayest use thy magic to go. Early on the morrow, again use thy art to journey west; in half a day’s time thou shalt reach home. I am He Xian’gu; the boatman thou sawest is the Daoist Zhang Guo. The one met on White Cloud Mountain is the Daoist Lan Caihe. The three of us hearing of thy progress in cultivation have greatly wished to aid thee to completion. But since the karma and the Way have not yet come, this great opportunity thou hast lost by thine own error, which is deeply to be lamented. Yet among the three teachings, Confucianism speaks not of immortals; success is but one. From now on, if thou canst be steadfast in goodness and diligent without slacking, thy future will be bright and full. Why must thou be an immortal? Be diligent, be diligent. Lan and Zhang are awaiting in the sea, going together to pay respects to the Daoist Zhongli. I cannot tarry to speak further; I go now."

Changfang looked upward, and all the while beheld but a single cloud of colours suspended alone mid-heaven, but no human figure. Yet the voice was clear, each word entering the ear without obscurity. Knowing it to be the wondrous power of the immortals, he quickly bowed down and prostrated himself upon the ground, acknowledging his fault. After the woman had gone, he rose and sat upon the shore, lost in thought for a while, reflecting that his immortal fate was lost, all from his own fault. Life in this turbid world was indeed without interest. Only the words of the immortal maiden seemed to hold some hope for the future. Since the immortal earnestly exhorted him, how dared he show disrespect or desertion, lest he incur the crime of defying Heaven? In a moment, his heart in the Way wholly vanished; worldly thoughts surged and swirled, and he longed to hasten home to see once again his long-separated beloved wife and son, to enjoy the blessings of family. Truly the human heart is fickle, and now is unlike then. Changfang hurriedly employed his art of contracting the earth, hastened to the market, and passed the night there.

At dawn next day he set out, and in half a day returned home. His wife, meeting him, suspected a devil or ghost and was greatly alarmed. After explanation, he took them all to the place where the coffin was kept. Opening it, it was indeed but a withered branch. Changfang reckoned the days—from his departure to his return no more than four days—but his household had already passed a whole year. Moreover, according to his wife, hearing the bad news and the arrangements for mourning, more than a hundred and fifty days had passed. The husband and wife and children were reunited after death, in a mingling of sorrow and joy beyond pen or brush to describe. From then on, Changfang ever remembered the immortal maiden’s injunction, and in dealing with the world and others, in handling affairs and interactions, he grew more peaceful and cautious. Since the death of Wang Yizhi in the reign of Emperor Wu of the Western Han, the office had passed to Changfang. Changfang’s quest for immortality failed; disheartened, he devoted himself to the office of master of spirits. The foregoing lengthy account is but a supplement to previous matters recorded in this book.

Later, Changfang lived through the Western and Eastern Han, and the Two Jins and Five Dynasties, truly healthy and safe, wandering freely in the world. Though not becoming immortal, his years passed at ease. Yet who knew that the end of life is fixed? When the immortal maiden advised him to return home and enjoy happiness, she also vaguely foretold that he should not become the successor of his master’s office. Reasonably, having received immortal instruction and striving to be a good man, he suffered no calamity amid the troubled times. In the end, though not becoming immortal, he did not fall into ruin. It was ordained for him thus—that he should not have a good end. Perhaps as the ancients say, "He who swims well will die by drowning; he who masters spirits will die by spirits." From Wang Yizhi, Fei Changfang, to the Tang scholar Zhong, three generations of spirit-masters, not one died otherwise than at the hands of spirits. This matter cannot be spoken of lightly. Here we pass over it, and speak only of Changfang’s unhappy end.

In the late Jin dynasty, he made a close friend named Huan Jing, a gentleman of renown at that time. Those who have read the Jin histories will have heard his great name. Huan Jing was also a remarkable man. It is said that in his youth he met a lame Daoist, who said that in a former life he had eaten too many dogs, and in this life would be bitten to death by many dogs. Huan Jing, seeing the Daoist’s uncommon countenance and elegant bearing, though clad in tattered clothes, was doubly impressed by his noble and pure spirit. He suspected him to be the famous Li Tieguai of popular tradition. Hearing his words, he was greatly frightened, and detained him, pleading for a method of escape. The Daoist was at a loss how to avoid him, but gave him a talisman, saying, "Go to a certain mountain; at the time of the meeting of the zi and wu hours every day, there is a great wolf-dog who vomits a red pill to the moon. I now grant thee a talisman; swallow it, and thou shalt be invisible and concealed, not seen by the dog. Come at the appointed time, hide behind the dog, and when it vomits the pill, seize it immediately and swallow it. From that time the dog shall not approach thee. Another benefit is that thy eyes shall see spirits, whether old ghosts or new, great or small, none can escape thy sight. Thou mayest thus defend thyself, and also cure diseases of men—a method that kills two birds with one stone." Having spoken, he gave the talisman and vanished like a clear wind, whither none knew. Huan Jing swallowed the talisman, went to the place indicated, and indeed saw a massive and fierce dog on the mountain top, worshipping the moon. At each bow it emitted the pill, which floated in the wind, a most beautiful sight. When it finished worship and stood up, it took the pill back into its mouth and swallowed it. Huan Jing dared not be careless, but hurried close to the dog, his heart greatly anxious, thinking, "If the talisman be not effective, my life will not end by the dog’s bite in the future, but I shall be swallowed now by this wolf-dog." Unexpectedly the dog felt nothing at each step he took, and thus emboldened, he put the dog’s pill into his hand and hastily swallowed it.

Immediately the dog seemed frantic, leaping and rolling on the mountain top, barking and howling; Huan Jing was greatly frightened, unable to move. The dog kept its distance of half a li, crying and raging at will, but could not approach him. Sometimes it opened furious eyes, raised its tail, and howled directly at Huan Jing. He knew the pill was effective. Though the dog was extremely fierce, it could not harm him; it merely barked and jumped about, and when he advanced a few steps, the dog fled as though it had met a tiger or leopard. Huan Jing rejoiced, ceased joking with it, and hurried home.

Since then his eyesight seemed to have an added brightness, quite different from its former light: on one side he saw the men and things of the yang world; on the other he could illuminate the spirits. Wherever he went, whenever, wherever his footsteps reached, he beheld all manner of strange, fierce and cruel ghosts. At first, seeing what he had never seen before, and in such strange and terrible form, he was greatly frightened and dared hardly open his eyes freely. Later, having seen much and grown accustomed, he no longer found it strange. At last, when visiting kin and friends’ homes, he was invited to inspect those possessed by spirits and made ill thereby; some could be sent off well with writing and paper and offerings; others, who would not desist from mischief, he would find his friend Fei Changfang and dispatch ghost soldiers to seize the spirits, thus incurring the hatred of many fierce ghosts. Among them a few cruel, cunning, nimble, and lowly ghosts, the cleverest in the nether world, assembled a great meeting of all sizes and sexes of ghosts, to deliberate on some method to take Changfang’s life, so that he should die at the hands of spirits and not even become a ghost himself.

After some discussion, a cruel ghost proposed a good plan: "We are souls detained in the nether world, suffering countless hardships. When there are evildoers, or those who owe us ghost debts from former lives, we go to disturb them, and gain some benefit; or if there are special relations, we may obtain a substitution and quickly return to mortal life. But Huan Jing lives well in the world, and is on a different path from us of light and darkness. Moreover, by means of the dog pill, without cause or grievance, he opposes us all, even calling upon our chiefs to punish us severely. Many of us have suffered at his hand. If we allow him to remain in the world, our torment will be endless, and we shall never see the light of day."

Hearing this, many male ghosts gritted their teeth and clenched their fists, full of rage. The female ghosts, one and all, wept bitterly, their sorrow pitiable beyond words, and asked, "Honoured spirit, what is thy wise counsel? We are tormented by this man; if he may be destroyed, all will obey thy command." The cruel ghost shouted, "Huan Jing is a clever man, with bright eyes and many schemes, and aided by our officers. To openly confront him in battle is impossible. The best plan is to strike by secret arrow. In my judgment, now that autumn has just passed and epidemic plagues are rife, we may send several comrades from the pestilence department to his home, spreading pestilential seeds in all directions. This will not only kill Huan Jing, but utterly destroy his whole family. Know that many of us, brothers both elder and younger, have been hurt by him—this is but just retribution. Even if Fei Changfang should know, by then Huan Jing will be dead. He need not take revenge for his friend and thus offend all our subordinates; moreover Huan Jing’s reckless violence without cause, and saving some who should die and thus robbing heaven and earth of their due, is most heinous. Should there be a trial, we will all accompany him to the Court of the Netherworld and present the case clearly; King Yan will scarcely favour him. As for Fei Changfang, blindly trusting Huan Jing and assisting his crimes, causing us brothers to die unjustly and become resentful ghosts who can never emerge from perdition, he too should be dealt with. He is wise and should not oppose us further. Should he unwisely help his friend and oppress us, he will bring misfortune upon himself. First, we are many; if all oppose him, he cannot keep his position, and losing office his life will be in our hands. Second, we shall all rise against him before King Yan and fight him; the King cannot go against the will of the many, and if he sides with us, Fei Changfang will no longer be feared. Consider, is not my plan feasible?"

The ghosts shouted joyfully, "A most excellent plan! No wonder thou art called the cruel ghost among men. Thy schemes are indeed crueler and more feared than others; truly thou art worthy of thy name. We will follow thy plan with all our might. First we will utterly destroy Huan Jing and his family; then see how Fei Changfang deals with us, and then decide on the next step."

The ghosts agreed on this poison plan, and sent a thousand pestilence ghosts to advance upon Huan’s house. To avoid detection by Huan Jing, once entering his gate they hastened to find a hiding place. All concealed themselves in a storeroom filled with goods. By day they dared not act; at night, when Huan Jing’s family and servants were all asleep, they joyfully emerged and set to work. Hurrying and bustling, they tampered with all the food and tea, the utensils and clothes, all within their power. In no time the whole household, inside and out, was filled with seeds of pestilence, and to quicken the effect, as if for those eager to die and hasten to Heaven, they used poison in great quantity. When all was done, they noisily withdrew.

Poor Huan Jing’s family slept sweetly, not dreaming that man deceives not man, but ghosts use such cruel stratagems for revenge. It seemed that though Huan Jing’s life would not end by the dog, it must end by the ghosts. Yet the ghosts have their thousand schemes, but Heaven has but one. Huan Jing’s fate was not to be cut off, and a great person came to rescue him—none other than his friend and spirit-master Fei Changfang. That night, Fei Changfang, returning from a friend’s banquet, passed a place where many wild graves lay and ghost-fires flickered. Ghosts themselves can call and cry with shrill voices, commonly called ghost-calls by men; but to Fei Changfang they were not so simple. Many turnings and meanings could be heard. Among those sharp calls he discerned many ghost words.

What he heard was the laughter and boasting of those pestilence ghosts who had left Huan’s house, each recounting their deeds, and every word pierced Fei Changfang’s ears. Greatly startled, he did not return home, but hastened to Huan’s house, knocked and entered, asking to see him. Huan Jing, surprised by Fei Changfang’s late-night visit, asked the reason. Fei Changfang thought, I have saved only one family’s life; there is no need to tell the whole truth, which would only deepen hatred and grievance with the ghosts. Therefore he spoke vaguely, uttering some empty words.

At last he said, "A great calamity is upon thy house; on the morrow at dawn, lead thy whole family, great and small, men and women, to the high mountain for a day’s outing. Each must bind an arm with a bag full of cornelian cherries. If no bag is at hand, put them in a pocket. This thing can avert poison and dispel pestilence, resist demons and ghosts. More is to be said: do not forget that once you set out, immediately depart, taking no food, drinking no broth. If you disobey me, even if you flee to the mountain, your life shall still be in danger. When you have gone, I shall dispatch persons to send ghosts to remove the evil from you. You must wait until sunset, when the moon rises, before returning. An earlier return is not permitted." Having spoken, he took his leave.

Huan Jing pondered long, never suspecting ghost mischief. Knowing Fei Changfang’s high cultivation, he believed his words had reason, and roused his family, explaining carefully. All were fearful and dared not sleep again. At dawn they locked their doors, and all went forth, great and small, taking bundles of cornelian cherries, each carrying some, placing them at their sides, and hurriedly fled to the mountain. They played there for a day, returning only at dusk.

Entering the house, the first sight was that all the domestic animals, pigs, sheep, chickens, ducks, had died without exception. Huan Jing then believed Fei Changfang’s art of divination. They were full of gratitude, and were about to send for Fei Changfang to ask how to remove the ill luck. Before the messenger could go forth, urgent news arrived that Fei Changfang had been killed by evil ghosts.

If thou wouldst know how the master of spirits might die by spirits, look to the next chapter for explanation.
