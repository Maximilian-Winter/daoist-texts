# Chapter 83: The Dog Spirit of Peach Blossom Mountain Afflicts Miss Wang — The Dog of Xiakou Bites Lü Dongbin

Now it happened that Lü Dongbin was suddenly startled by a sharp shout from Zhongli Quan. In the moment that he opened his eyes, he found himself astride the back of a white crane, soaring aloft in mid-air, wheeling about in flight; and his heart was filled with still greater amazement. Taking advantage of the crane’s motion, he gently tapped upon its long neck and said, “Senior Brother, go slowly, I have a matter to ask.” The Crane Boy slightly spread and relaxed his wings, stretched out his neck and raised his head, and, uttering human speech, said, “Master instructed me to convey you to the northern bank of the river. When there, others will come to escort you to Mount Lu. Brother, have you any doubts?” Dongbin answered, “It is not so. Just now I was speaking with Master; how is it that in the twinkling of an eye I was already upon your back, and have flown half the sky? What manner of method is this?” The Crane Boy laughed, saying, “This is Master’s immortal art. If you know it not, how could I?” Dongbin further asked, “Where is Master now? Do you know?” The Crane Boy laughed again, saying, “Is he not still in your home? These things I know not at all. I only know that Master summoned me specially to see you off. If there were other words, since he does not say them, how should I dare ask?” Dongbin was aware that his knowledge was limited, much like his own. The question just put forth was but the sudden product of surprise, a restless word arising from an unsteady mind; since no answer came, he let it pass. The Crane Boy spoke no more and spread his wings, flying swiftly. In less than half a day’s time, they had already passed from the river to the north bank. Eastward along the river stood the city of Nanchang. The white crane set Dongbin down, bidding him farewell, and flapped its wings to depart. Dongbin hastened to salute with his hands pressed to his forehead.

Dongbin quietly composed himself and thought within: Master bade me go to Mount Lu; according to the Crane Boy, there will be one to receive me and ferry me across the river. But who might this be? After some thought he decided not to concern himself. This place, backed by hills and facing the river, was fair and clean. Since he had arrived, a visit and recreation would do no harm. As he was about to step forth, he caught sight of a man dressed as a steward hastening towards him, his face and head all bathed in profuse sweat. Drawing near to Dongbin, he brushed against his Taoist robe unwittingly. Dongbin, unprepared for this, stepped back several paces and, unable to suppress a smile, said, “Good sir, you walk somewhat recklessly. Such a broad road, and yet you strike against another with your eyes open — is it not laughable?”

The man was exceedingly courteous; hearing this he hastened to smile and clasp his fists in apology, bowing repeatedly: “I am indeed burdened with urgent business, and must speed to a place thirty li hence to request a higher Taoist to aid our master’s household in subduing a demon. Seeing that the day draws late, and that the demon causes great disturbance within the home, we fear our master’s affairs may be harmed, so I hasten in frantic speed. Who could have guessed that I, confused by haste, would collide with you, clearly the Taoist ahead? I beg your pardon most humbly.” Dongbin laughed and said, “It is nothing. But pray, tell me more of this demon. Such talk is sudden and strange. The heavens are bright and the world clear — what bold demon dares appear by broad daylight? Brother, will you tell me in detail?”

The man said, “To talk is no trouble, but alas, the day grows late and I must still hasten.” Dongbin smiled, “I am quite idle and without affairs; I will accompany you on the way, if you please.” Hearing this, the man glanced over him and asked, “You speak as though you are not from these parts. Could it be that you are an immortal from afar?” Dongbin laughed, “Immortal is a term too lofty. I am indeed from afar. I am from the River region, surname Lü, given name Yan, styled Dongbin. I come to learn the ways of immortality on Mount Lu, but I am not yet an immortal.”

The man smiled and said, “If such be the case, you are surely a man of some learning, quite different from common adepts. Can you assist my master in exorcising demons? My humble abode is the famed town of Xiakou, a place of many thoroughfares. My master is a well-known good man here, with vast estates. His surname is Wang, and all call him Master Wang. He has a young lady, just sixteen years of age, of rare beauty and talent, dutiful to her parents and courteous to us servants. Yet, in the third month of this year, when she followed her lady mother, Wang An, to offer incense on Peach Blossom Mountain, she was seen by a demon, who tracked her and attached himself to her person, uttering wild nonsense beyond expression. He claims that the young lady and he are fated to wed. He is an immortal; if the master would consent to wed her to him, he promises to raise the whole family to heaven. But Master Wang will not agree, and has summoned many Taoists to exorcise the demon. Alas, those men are all cheats, only seeking money to drink and feast. They cannot subdue the demon. In fact, they have all suffered defeat at the demon’s hands, beaten with broken noses, bruised bodies, and driven away in disgrace, not even daring to collect their fees. The demon, angered by the master’s refusal, now daily causes strange and fearful disturbances within the house.”

Dongbin laughed, “Oh? And what strange things?” The man stuck out his tongue and said, “The demon’s arts are fearsome indeed. He can cause wildfires to blaze up in empty air, setting your houses and possessions aflame with leaping flames, frightening men and beasts alike to shrieks and flight. But in a blink, the flames vanish; the houses remain intact, not a leaf or blade of grass harmed. Sometimes the family sits in peaceful discourse, when suddenly crashes sound, and walls fall down before your eyes. When you flee to escape, the walls are restored, not a speck of dust or stone remains. More cruel yet, he can deceive the eyes so that the steward mistakes the wife for the mistress, and sons mistake their mother for wife. Though all is soon seen for what it is, many a laugh is caused. Taoist, consider this demon’s mischief: though he cannot truly harm, he upsets the whole household in ceaseless turmoil, so that not a single proper matter can be done; and all hearts are uneasy, ever fearing his mischief. Such a burden is hard to bear.”

Dongbin asked, “And the young lady? Has the demon defiled her person?” The man said, “This is the strange part. The demon daily presses the lady to wed him, yet by his manner he seems to fear her greatly. When he comes, he only sits in her chamber. Several times he has thought to mount her bed, but never dared to do so. If such a demon still speaks of reason or affection, none will believe it. He neither knows reason nor dares offend the young lady. What can this mean?” Dongbin asked, “Have you all seen the demon’s shape?” The man said, “None but the lady has seen him, for she keeps company with him day and night. It is said to be a monstrous creature, hairy and tailed, fierce and cruel. The lady is of noble birth, seldom leaving her chamber; now she is forced to keep such a dreadful demon by her side. Poor lady, how she suffers!”

Dongbin, roused to anger, exclaimed, “Say no more. I will accompany you to summon a higher Taoist. If it be possible to subdue this demon, well; if not, I will ascertain its nature and then devise means to subdue it. If my skill be insufficient, I will return to Master to aid your master’s household. What say you?” The man was overjoyed and said, “If this be so, our master will be most grateful to you.”

Dongbin said no more, but followed him to an old temple called the Baoguo Chan Temple. The man entered and sought audience with the guest monk, Master Zhiyuan, and Dongbin followed close. Zhiyuan was a short and stout monk, broad-headed and large-eared. The man presented a letter from their master. Zhiyuan examined it, but said neither yea nor nay, instead asking Dongbin who he was. The man replied for him: “He is Taoist Lü on the road, whom we met and who accompanies us to visit our master.” Zhiyuan smiled and asked Dongbin, “Are you the Lü Yan of the River region?” Dongbin was greatly astonished and asked how the master knew his name. Zhiyuan made no answer, but smiled slightly. Dongbin watched his expression closely and saw a cunning look in his smile. He thought secretly, “I am bound for Mount Lu; I should not meddle with trifles, lest I meet evil men and be troubled. This would be dangerous; and it would hinder my proper business. Better to find a way to slip away and cross the river by myself, whether or not there is one to meet me.”

Having made this resolve, he saw Zhiyuan bargaining with the man over the reward for subduing the demon. The man offered two thousand silver taels, but Zhiyuan would not consent. Meanwhile he instructed the temple workers to fetch the senior master, saying: “Lü Yan of the River region has arrived.” Dongbin was more alarmed, thinking the monk must bear him ill will, and knew he had come to exact revenge. Yet the matter stood thus, and he could only await events. To show no fear was necessary lest he lose face and accomplish nothing. So with a faint smile he said, “This is strange indeed. If you know my name, who is this senior master, and how does he also know me?” Zhiyuan smiled, “Do not suspect. This senior master is a man of great Tao power, knowing past and future, possessing arts to overturn heaven and earth, and summon rain and clouds. He is kind to all, and loves talent. Soon you will see him and know he is a man of Amita Buddha’s own spirit.”

Dongbin had no choice but to wait. Meanwhile Zhiyuan and the steward agreed that after the demon was subdued, the two thousand silver would be paid. Dongbin came of a noble family and was generous by nature; he had always striven to help others, but had never known such affairs of exorcising demons to be matters of trade and bargaining. He found this most strange. He also thought that the monks of this temple were probably a set of mean fellows, yet how could they possess such powers? As he mused thus, sounds of footsteps came from the rear courtyard. Zhiyuan smiled, “The senior master has arrived. Taoist Brother Lü, come quickly with me to meet him.”

Dongbin rose and followed Zhiyuan to the back, where they saw an old monk with white beard and flowing locks, bright in spirit, with a rare and noble frame, walking steadily forward. Zhiyuan hastened to greet him with some words. The old monk’s face showed joy as he asked, “Where is this man?” Dongbin heard his voice ring like a great bell and was much amazed; he hastened forward and bowed, saying, “Taoist disciple Lü Yan respectfully greets the Chan Patriarch.” The old monk took his arm and laughed heartily, “Good, good. I have waited long for you. Come with me; I have much to say.” Dongbin noted the old monk’s stern and dignified bearing, unlike the slippery air of Zhiyuan, and thought, “This is indeed a good monk. I ought not to have doubted him.” He followed respectfully to the meditation hall, bowing again.

The old monk said, “No need for ceremony. My secular surname is Zhang; two hundred years ago I shaved my head and took vows, and my Dharma name is Tongming. This year I am two hundred and forty-five years old. Recently, in meditation, I knew you would come today, and instructed my disciples to await your arrival. You have a deep capacity; whether to cultivate immortality or learn Buddha’s way, it will be easy for you. I desire to persuade you to enter the Buddhist fold. I will take you as disciple and hand down my life’s Tao practice to you. Soon I shall enter Nirvana; you may then reside in this temple as abbot, lead the monks, and your future destiny will be great indeed! Will you accept?”

Dongbin was taken aback. Luckily he was quick-witted, and promptly replied, “Master, your great kindness to nurture your disciple is well known. Yet I, before entering the order, have already been taught and guided by an immortal master. This journey is by my master’s command, to go to Mount Lu to learn swordsmanship. I have entered the Taoist fold and cannot change path. Fortunately, the three teachings share a common source, their purpose to enlighten mankind and dispel evil. Though I am Taoist, I am as one with those who take refuge in Buddha. The Buddhist fold is vast, and the master’s virtue is great and age venerable; your mind is unlike common men’s and will not blame me for my failure to accept your generous offer.” The old monk was silent for a time, then sighed, “A man without fate, to force him to have fate is to go against the course of nature. I was wrong, I was wrong.” Saying this, he closed his eyes and sat, silent a long while. Then Zhiyuan came forward and stood by him. At last he opened his eyes and said, “Go to Master Wang’s house, but be cautious. The demon is Erlang Shen’s Howling Celestial Dog. Now, while its master is occupied, it is left untended and roams freely below, not easily dealt with. The treasure given to you before may drive off the dog, but do not kill it. For it has rendered many merits to Erlang. Its small misdeeds do not deserve death. Moreover, Miss Wang is the reincarnation of a tigress; though a fierce beast in former life, she was kind-hearted and never harmed humans. Now in human form, she is tender to her underworld ghosts, who cling to and protect her; thus the dog cannot come near. Since it has not defiled a person, its guilt is lessened. If you kill it, you not only affront Erlang Shen but commit a serious crime, sowing enmity for the next life. Do you understand?” Zhiyuan said, “I obey.”

The old monk further said to Zhiyuan, “Since Lü Yan has resolved not to enter our fold, take him with you to visit the Wang household, and help settle a troublesome karmic matter.” Zhiyuan looked at Dongbin and Dongbin, hearing the old monk, felt a new doubt arise. He wished to ask, but the old monk closed his eyes and entered meditation again; so he and Zhiyuan took leave. Zhiyuan drew two sets of armour and horse trappings, binding one set each to their feet, and traced talismanic symbols, saying this was the art of divine travel, enabling three thousand li travel a day. Dongbin was pleased and they left the mountain gate. He instructed the Wang steward, “Take your time in returning; we will go ahead.” So saying, he called to Dongbin to keep pace. Indeed they moved like the wind, and in a moment reached a marketplace.

The dusk was not yet full, and Zhiyuan pointed to a spacious mansion ahead, saying it was Master Wang’s home. They went straight to the gate and explained their mission to the gatekeeper, who hurried to inform his master. Soon Master Wang, his wife, parents, and children — six or seven in all — came out to welcome them and invited them in. On first meeting, all exchanged the usual courtesies. Then Zhiyuan inquired about the demon’s mischief; Master Wang’s account was much as the steward had told Dongbin. He asked Zhiyuan whether the demon’s species was known, why it could cause trouble in the human world yet had not shed its fur or skin, and why it seemed afraid of the young lady. Zhiyuan related the old monk’s instructions.

He added, “Though this dog does not yet know of us, it is sharp of sense; if it should learn, it will flee. If it waits for us to leave and then returns to cause trouble, this is very dangerous. Since we have just arrived and it knows nothing, it is best to seize and subdue it at once. I ask Master Wang to lead us to the young lady’s chamber, that we may perform rites and subdue the demon.” Master Wang was delighted and personally took the lantern, leading with his wife and the two monks by winding paths to the young lady’s fragrant chamber upstairs.

At the door, Zhiyuan produced a cloth painting and instructed Dongbin to wait at the door and hang the painting on the curtain. When the dog entered the painting, it could be quickly rolled up and its bones turned to ashes. Dongbin hastened, “Did not the senior master bid us spare its life?” Zhiyuan spat and laughed, “That old fellow is troublesome in such matters. If we come to exorcise a demon, clean exorcism is proper; what use is saying spare its life? If it is to be spared, then let us not trouble ourselves. A cat crying over a mouse — sheer hypocrisy. I hate such things most of all.”

Dongbin was silent and took the painting, keeping guard at the door. After Zhiyuan entered the chamber, Dongbin hung the painting. Zhiyuan, Master Wang, and his wife entered inside. The young lady lay asleep in the bed, the gauze curtains falling all around, and no sound was heard. Only the snoring of a dog was heard. Opening his eyes, Dongbin saw a fierce and frightful evil dog curled beneath the bed, sound asleep. Zhiyuan laughed, “This beast knows how to enjoy itself.” He bade Master Wang and wife step back as he drew his sword and performed rites. Master Wang and wife beheld many divine generals and spirits suddenly appear before them. Zhiyuan explained the cause and the generals raised weapons against the dog beneath the bed. The dog donned sharp weapons and howled fiercely, leaping forth and biting wildly. The generals’ weapons could not harm it and several were bitten and wounded. Zhiyuan was enraged and wielded his sword himself, the dog fiercely countering with claws. The sword flashed like a silver stream, visible in light but not in form. The dog, a celestial beast familiar with great battle arrays, was unruffled and fought valiantly, at times lunging with all four feet, at times opening its mouth to swallow. After much fighting, the sword could not wound the dog, nor could the dog hurt the men. Yet the gods greatly outnumbered the dog, which was alone and could not prevail.

Seeing its strength waning, the dog fought while retreating, till it reached the door and sought to escape. Looking up, it saw before it a vast garden, with mountains and waters, trees and flowers, and many small animals it loved — pigs, sheep, chickens, geese — all roaming freely and at ease. The dog hesitated not, for it was weary and hungry. But the dog’s knowledge was far less than man’s; it knew not that this garden was but an illusion to lure it in. It stepped inside. Outside, Lü Dongbin fixed his gaze without moving his eyes as it entered the painting and suddenly vanished. He hastily rolled up the painting. Halfway through, he recalled the old monk’s words; and thinking that the dog’s master Erlang Shen was acquainted with his own master, he feared harming the Howling Celestial Dog might cause trouble. Better to set it free. So he unrolled the painting again. Halfway through, suddenly a fierce dog leapt out and, unawares, bit at Dongbin’s nether parts. Dongbin cried “Ah!” and fell backward. This is the story commonly told in the world as “The dog bites Lü Dongbin, not recognizing a good man’s heart.”

Whether Lü Dongbin’s life was spared or not shall be told in the next chapter.
