# Chapter 88: Lost on the Way, Suddenly Hearing of a Heinous Murder; At Midnight, a Glimpse of Ghosts Appearing

Now it happened that Dongbin was kicked by Erlang Shen’s foot into mid-air, and he felt his body light and drifting, wavering and falling amidst thick clouds and dense mists. After about half a meal’s time, he at length felt his feet touch the ground. Opening his eyes and fixing his gaze, he looked about on all sides, and found himself standing upon the summit of a mountain, the peaks fair and lovely, the woods and valleys deep and secluded. Though it was the dead of night, by virtue of his penetrating eyes, he saw quite clearly that it was a noble mountain forest. He thought within himself, and found it somewhat laughable. Since he had become a recluse, first he was thrown by Crane Boy, and now kicked by Erlang Shen; his body was like a leather ball, tossed about at others’ will, unable to make any decision for itself. Moreover, where was he? What realm was this? Both times he had not known. The first time he had inquired of the steward, and then knew he had arrived at Xiakou. Now he was cast down upon a high mountain; the moon was dark and the stars few, the mountains deep and the woods dense — for the moment there was no one to ask for directions.

After some thought, he said to himself, “Let it be. I will sit here meditating for the night. At dawn I shall seek a way out, and not depend upon a messenger to ferry me across the river. Now that Erlang Shen has descended to the world below, I suppose it is the Old Man under the Moon who sent him. Since the Howling Celestial Dog is by his side, he surely will not seek out the Lady of the Wang family again. My duty may be deemed fulfilled. Here at Xiakou, there was nothing very important; why should I wait on Crane Boy’s instructions, expecting someone to send me across the river? What if this child was playing a joke on me, intending to tease me? Would I not fall into his trap? But how far did Erlang kick me? To Lushan is on the way; or did he kick me farther and farther, and leave me in some remote and pestilential place where no man treads? That would be an unspeakable misfortune.” Thinking thus, he could not help but spit and laugh: “How can a recluse entertain such cares? Such wild imaginings would only give the Moon Lady cause to laugh.” Then he sought out a stone on the mountain, sat cross-legged with danger, and practised the mysterious art for a while.

The sky was already dawn, when suddenly from the woods came the voices of children playing. Much surprised in his heart, he hastily rose and followed the sound, pacing slowly onward. Indeed, he saw three or four country children, boys and girls mingled, playing with great spirit. Dongbin thought, “From this it must be that there are dwellings below the mountain. I had better bring these children here and ask them a question; if I learn the place, I can then determine my course.” So he stepped forward and stood beneath a tree, watching them play awhile. The children also saw him.

They all ceased their play and exclaimed in wonder, “So early in the morning, from whence comes this Daoist?” A girl laughed and said, “This Daoist seems not to be a local.” A boy asked, “How do you know?” The girl laughed again: “My uncle is also a Daoist; he often goes out with a company of Daoists to perform rites and exorcisms. How should I not know them? But I have never seen this Daoist before. Besides, the Daoists here are like us farmers, all dark and coarse of feature; how could this Daoist be so fair, so handsome, and so amusing?” At these words Dongbin could not forbear laughing aloud. Then the boy who had spoken first said, “Oh, you like this Daoist? You two are about the same age. You are eleven this year, and he can be only two or three years older than me, at most fifteen or sixteen. Today Heaven grants a good match; to meet so early in the morning shows you two would make a good husband and wife. Let me act as your matchmaker, shall I?” Although the girl was still young, she felt shy, her face reddened, and she scolded the boy. The other children clapped hands and made a commotion.

Seeing their merriment, Dongbin felt both amusement and irritation, and thought it not fitting to question them; so he stood there dazed. After a while, the girl, unable to hold out against the others, began to sob. The children laughed loudly: “Little Jinzi is crying. When her mother finds out, she’ll say we bullied her daughter. Let us go home quickly.” Saying this, they all scattered in disorder. Only the girl remained sitting on the grass, sobbing unceasingly. Dongbin, seeing that no one was left, fixed his gaze on the girl and was secretly startled. He thought, “How can such a fair and ethereal girl be found in such a wild mountain? Her countenance is not particularly extraordinary, yet with that delicate face and singular frame, according to the Daoist teaching, she must be of immortal bone and immortal spirit. No wonder they say Lushan is a famous region of the world, where the spirit of the land and the excellence of men meet; even country children possess such talents. I must not miss this; I will carefully investigate her.” Having resolved thus, he approached and said, “Little maiden, do not weep; do not weep. They are but jesting with you. If you weep, you will only fall into their trap again.” Little Jinzi, hearing Dongbin speak, indeed ceased crying, and with a pair of small, round black eyes surveyed him from head to foot. She said nothing, nor rose, but shyly looked down and plucked grass from the mountain. Dongbin asked again, “Pray, little maiden, what place is this? What is the name of this mountain?”

Little Jinzi laughed and looked up saying, “People say Daoists are somewhat dull. You, Daoist, really have a touch of that dullness. You do not even know where your own body is — is that not pitiful dullness?” Having said this, she laughed again. Dongbin thought to explain the matter to her, but feared the strangeness of the affair. If she spoke of it, it might terrify the common world. So he made a careless excuse, saying he had been so taken with the mountain scenery that he lost his way and had to ask. Little Jinzi, half believing, half doubting, said, “Are you really not from here?” Dongbin smiled, “If you listen to my accent, do you not know?” Little Jinzi then nodded and said, “This place is called Lushan…”

That word startled Dongbin into silence, but filled him with great joy; he hastened to ask, “Little maiden, is it so you say? This is called Lushan?” Little Jinzi laughed, “You say I am dull, and yet you will not admit it. I tell you the place, and you refuse to believe. Is your body fallen from Heaven or grown from the earth? Or was it bought and sold by evil men, or blown here by some wind? How can you be so dull!” Dongbin, teased by her, had just begun to explain his origin, but blushed and laughed and said, “Little maiden, do not ask me such things. I only ask if this is the domain of Nanchang, and if the Lushan you speak of has a great waterfall, famed far and wide?” Little Jinzi raised a small hand and pointed afar: “Under the mountain peak over there is the great waterfall; that is called Xianglu Peak. All the year round, tourists come in unceasing flow. My grandfather, when he had leisure from farming, would carry sedan chairs for the mountain visitors. All through the year he earned much silver. When it came to my father’s hand, because of poor health and a fondness for drink and idleness, he hardly carried chairs nor went much to the fields. Fortunately, grandfather earned some land, and sold it yearly for his use. Sometimes, when he was in good spirits in spring, the busiest season for visitors, he would set up a fruit stall beneath the mountain, earn some money, drink more wine, and be quite happy.”

Hearing the girl recount so much family detail, Dongbin laughed heartily. He knew this was truly Lushan, the mountain he desired to reach. He deeply felt the grace of Erlang’s kick, and greatly admired his divine cunning; this was just like on the day when his master had merely spoken once, and he was borne on the crane’s back, ascending half heaven — the same effect indeed. After a moment’s thought, he asked again, “Is your uncle also a recluse?” Little Jinzi, surprised, said, “How do you know?” Dongbin, seeing she had forgotten her words to the boys, found it very amusing, and nodded, “I have the secret art of divination; I can know the matters in one’s heart. Pray tell me, little maiden, have you heard the uncles speak of any new immortals arriving here?” Little Jinzi laughed, “You are a Daoist, yet say such ignorant things!” Dongbin, astonished, said, “How so? Are these ignorant words?” Little Jinzi answered, “How not? Such words should be spoken by others, not by you Daoists.” Hearing this, Dongbin was more puzzled than ever. Little Jinzi smiled, “I often hear my uncle and a band of Daoists say: ‘As for immortals and demons, all are tales told by Daoists to deceive people. People believe their words, and their business comes in.’ It is clear such talk is utterly unreliable. Others may say they have been taken in by Daoists; but you, a Daoist, whom have you been taken in by? Is that not ignorant talk?”

Hearing her words, Dongbin suddenly had a great enlightenment, and laughed aloud, “So it is. I suppose your uncle is not a true Daoist, but only does rites for others to earn some money. So having become a Daoist himself, he does not believe in immortals or demons. Is that so?” Just as Little Jinzi was about to speak again, from below the mountain came a woman’s voice calling, “Jinzi, Jinzi, you little baggage, in the blink of an eye, where have you wandered off to?” Then a child’s voice said, “Your daughter has grown up now. She already has a good man, a Daoist like yourself, and your second brother is their kin. If they marry, they will be well matched.” No sooner had the words ceased than came the clear sounds of slaps, the woman scolding, the child stamping and wailing in great sorrow, their cries drawing nearer to the mountain. Little Jinzi seemed not afraid, but still smiling, plucking many grasses. Dongbin could no longer stand by; fearing Jinzi would be beaten by her mother, he said, “I must go. Have you not heard your mother’s scolding? Why do you not go to meet her?” Little Jinzi laughed, “What is there to fear? I have not truly stolen this Daoist; why should she eat you up? Even if I had a man, she could not interfere. People fear her fierceness; I do not. If she is good, good. If not, humph! Let me tell of her secrets and see if my father beats her.”

Dongbin secretly stuck out his tongue, thinking, This little girl’s speech is so wanton; what will become of her when she grows up? Yet it is a pity for her fair face and frame. Probably the local customs are too bad, or the family base too low; unknowingly they have led this pure and noble little spirit astray. Thinking thus, he resolved to follow his own path, not to meet here the scolding of that vile woman. Having made up his mind, he set off. After a few steps, the shouting and scolding behind grew louder. Dongbin, being kind-hearted and the most meddlesome of cultivators, hesitated, saying, “Though these children are bad, I would not have this matter cause the woman to beat and curse, lest I be the cause of harm. Since I have no pressing business, why not go back and see what is happening?”

So he turned about and returned to the place, where he saw a loud-mouthed country woman driving Little Jinzi down the mountain, beating and scolding her. The boy who had teased Jinzi followed behind, crying and lamenting, saying he would tell his father and mother, and would not yield to this woman. Dongbin looked on, laughing and angry. Then Little Jinzi suddenly spoke a most startling word: “If you dare strike me, do not blame me for wronging you. I but ask, how did my grandmother die? And how did my brother die? When I tell my father, see if you can live or not.” This speech frightened the woman dumb; she dropped the firewood she held and, wagging her tail like a dog, comforted Little Jinzi: “Good child, if you are so stubborn, you will not be a proper daughter. If you say such things, your mother will be beaten to death by your father; what will become of you then?”

Little Jinzi was clever, and having the wind, turned her course. She looked up at the hilltop; Dongbin quickly dodged behind the woods. Seeing no one, Little Jinzi laughed and said, “Mother, if you do not beat me, I will surely help you and be of one mind with you. If you want me to ask Uncle Wang, I will do so for you, and not let father and uncles know. Is that well, mother?” The two laughed and went down the mountain, turning round the peak and vanished. Dongbin, concealed behind a tree, was stupefied long.

He had inadvertently overheard this secret, and suddenly understood the matter: a heinous case of murder, where aunt kills nephew, was hidden within. He ground his teeth and said, “How can there be such wanton and cruel women in the world? I ought not to have turned back to see this commotion, and yet this grievous matter has come to my ears. But other men’s family affairs are none of my concern; I must walk my own quiet path.” Yet how could his fervent heart for saving the world lay quiet? After a while, he saw the boy still crouched beneath a pine tree, lost in thought. Dongbin walked over, and the boy, seeing him, suddenly smiled and said, “You, Daoist, why do you not go back, but run about in these mountains?” Dongbin laughed, “You like to meddle in other people’s business; no wonder the woman beats and scolds you.” The boy cursed between his teeth, “If I catch that merciless murderous thief, I will tell everyone her deeds. Then she will know the power of Niu Damao’s hand.” Dongbin asked, “You are called Niu Damao?” “Yes,” he replied. “My brother is called Ermao, and my sister Sanmao. They are much better than that Jinzi.” Dongbin laughed, “Why do you call that woman a murderous thief? Such words are rash.”

Niu Damao was angry, “Did you not hear what her daughter said about her? I should at once lead her to the village and tell her deeds, to disgrace her! Perhaps the officials would hear and arrest her, and she would be beheaded! But then I thought it was a serious matter. My father and mother forbid us to speak. If trouble arose, they would beat me. So I hide here and do not speak.” Dongbin laughed, “If you have caused no trouble, why hide here?” Damao smiled, then said, “Daoist brother, do you want to know about this woman? I will tell you. Everyone in our village knows, except her husband and two sisters, who do not know. This woman is the wife Niu of the village’s Zhu Xiaogui. Xiaogui, you never saw him; if you had, you would laugh till your belly broke. His head is crooked, with a great tumour under the neck, so that from afar he looks as though he has two heads. His body is short, about the size of us children. His face is all pockmarks and black, with one swollen eye, red eyelid turned to the nose — a frightful sight. We call this woman Xiaogui’s Sister-in-Law. Though she is not handsome, people say she has a slender figure and fair skin. How could she look up to such a husband? Long ago she secretly took a man. Xiaogui loves drink, and when drunk is senseless. This woman opened the back door for that man — oh, I have not told you who he is. That man is the Wang family uncle Jinzi spoke of, a certain Mr. Wang. We hardly know him. But my parents and many others say he is a gentleman, a good man. Many in our village speak well of him, for he is wealthy and does good deeds, saving many lives. So he comes and goes at the Zhu house, and with this Niu woman, secretly. No one seeks to discover his affairs. Therefore their illicit love has not been exposed. People are not afraid of Sister-in-Law, but respect Mr. Wang.”

Dongbin heard all this and was much perplexed, saying, “This Mr. Wang must be a libertine.” Niu Damao laughed, “Not so. Elsewhere he is very proper, only intimate with this Niu woman. When he comes, she dresses in rouge and powder, like a courtesan of the East Street. They have been mingling openly and secretly for three or four years. Everyone knows, only Xiaogui himself is still in the dark. Yet that cursed wife, the wife of Xiaogui’s sister-in-law, has repeatedly caught them in their treachery. She said she would tell her son. The woman was enraged, and with her lover, threw her on the bed, strangled her until she died. The next day the drunkard knew his mother was dead; he was a fool and knew nothing; the coffin was carried out and that was all. But the woman’s eldest son, now twelve years old, the same age as me, seems destined to die young. Though big, he spoke without sense, and everywhere told of his mother and her lover killing his grandmother. Xiaogui’s sister-in-law often beat and scolded him. He grew angry and openly spread his mother’s secrets. His mother hated him, and gave him arsenic to poison him to death. When he died, I went to see; his face was streaming black blood. Ah, terrible and fearful! Yet the drunkard still paid no heed; the body was carried out and buried on the mountain. Now all say Zhu Xiaogui is a fool, to have such a wife. Surely his life will be claimed by this woman!”

Dongbin was filled with rage, wishing to pursue and kill her outright. But since it was no concern of his, nor kinship, he refrained from taking their part. After a while Niu Damao left. Dongbin went down the mountain alone, walked about the village, and took note of Zhu Xiaogui’s household. At night he guarded behind a great camphor tree opposite the Zhu household. About the second watch, he saw a finely dressed man come to the back door of the Zhu house. At a peck, the door opened and he entered. It was the woman, laughing and chatting with him, entering together. Dongbin said to himself, “This is clear proof. The matter is indeed true. Most strange is the manner of this lover — he looks like a gentleman; why then is he entangled with this woman? It must be a karmic sin from a former life.”

His words were not ended when suddenly a cold wind rose at his feet, swirling around his body, twisting and turning as if something clung to him. Though bold, Dongbin shivered. Focusing his spirit, he saw a black smoke suddenly fly off and roll ten paces away, uttering mournful chirrups, the sound pitiful and heart-rending. Dongbin was greatly alarmed, and softly cried out, “Spirit of wronged one, if you bear grievance, appear before me; I will surely redress your wrongs.” Hardly had he spoken, when a traveler on the road rushed up beside him, knelt, clutched Dongbin’s feet, and wailed and sobbed, beseeching the great immortal to redress his grievances. This startled Dongbin to a cold sweat.

Who could this be, and why did he seek Dongbin’s aid? Let this be explained in the next chapter.
