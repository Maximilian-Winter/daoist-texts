# Chapter 92: Warning Against Lewdness and the Calamities of the Barbarian Land of Wa — The Old Man Withdraws to the Pear Garden Amidst the Doom of the Ages

Now it is told that by the banks of the Xiang River, Chang’e of the moon and the two immortals Zhong and Lü, having gathered together to save the Crane Boy, found occasion to discourse leisurely on the matters of the times. Immortal Zhong had already outlined in brief the causes and consequences of the Tang emperor’s allotted trials and tribulations. But Wang Tai alone, though in his youth he loved his country and caused a demon calamity upon the land of Wa, slaying countless people, was thought excessively cruel; yet never had the imperial command been heard to punish him.

Immortal Lü was puzzled, and so asked his master about this. Zhongli sighed, saying: ‘What I have seen is not without reason. Yet you must understand that the Wa people are base in nature and cunning in deed, long despised by the Celestial Court. Wang Tai was but a young child, having no duty to guard the land, dwelling apart from the world, separated from the Central Kingdom. Though even if the Yue were poor or rich, and heedless of the rise and fall of China, it cannot be said that he had a cold face and cold heart, indifferent to state affairs. Yet he was stirred by loyalty and righteousness, and moved by solitary indignation. Having no desire for reward nor ambition for fame, he was able by his own power to strive for the survival of his homeland, and resist the violent tyranny of strong foes; such resolve should surely be cherished by Heaven’s heart. Moreover, the burden of war rests upon the emperor alone. Those outside the emperor’s charge may well be spared, in order to show the kindness and mercy of the imperial Heaven. Furthermore, the spirit of the Wa people is too unruly, their customs greatly corrupted, and hereafter they will surely disturb the world. With Wang Tai’s subjugation of the volcanic method, he can at any time bring disaster upon the whole land; perhaps thus his wild ambition may be checked, who can say? Therefore this strategy has won the approval of Heaven. Yet because the Wa have died in great number, his guilt is indeed involved. If a clear decree of reward were made, it would lead men to suspect that disorder was being rewarded. Hence it is concealed, to count as merits balancing guilt. Otherwise, some merit might have been allowed — who can say?’

They talked at leisure for some time, and before they knew it the dawn had broken. Chang’e, being charged with the movements of moonlight, could not stay longer, and took her leave in haste. Thereupon the two immortals Zhong and Lü escorted the Crane Boy to the nether courts, entreating the King of the Underworld to entrust him to be reborn as a son in a family of loyal, gentle officials. This was the Han Xiangzi among the Eight Immortals. His father was Han Hui. His uncle, Yi Wei Kong Jiao, was the founder of Confucian learning for eight generations, Han Wengong, who dwelt in Changli. Later generations called him Han Changli, the paternal uncle of Xiangzi’s father.

After sending off the Crane Boy, Zhongli took with him Dongbin to the Cloud Veil Cliff upon Mount Emei in Shu, to practise alchemy and cultivate energy. Before departing, Dongbin inquired after his family and parents. Zhongli laughed, saying: ‘You need not trouble yourself. Your father and mother have by a dream of mine been enlightened; they have grown weary of the red dust and now cultivate the Dao at home. I have taught them many secret formulas and methods of cultivation. When you succeed, they will have attained some merit. If you visit them in person, a little progress will be made — that is not easily achieved. As to your son, he is destined for rank and honours; in time he will pursue his achievements. You need not fret over him.’ Dongbin gratefully bowed and thanked him.

Later Dongbin dwelt for five years at Cloud Veil Cliff, comprehending cause and effect, returning to his original true nature. Counting from the time he left home, no more than ten years, he had attained the form of a Great Daoist Immortal of the highest order, rivalled only by Tieguai and Zhongli among the Golden Immortals. Truly he was the swiftest to attain immortality in all antiquity. This was because his root nature was extremely profound; moreover, his intention was to aid the world and save men, sent by command to descend to earth, not like one fallen to the red dust due to some fault. Who could hope to equal him? After his attainment, he was given by the Patriarch the book of the Profound Capital Secret Pivot. All the spells and arts known to immortals of the Three Realms were therein recorded, embracing all phenomena, wresting from Heaven and Earth the power of creation. It was the first complete and nameless manuscript in the Three Pure Ones’ official collection. Not only ordinary immortals were forbidden to see it; even among the Eight Immortals, save Tieguai and Zhongli, few could behold the whole.

Later, Dongbin also took over the former charge of the Eastern Emperor, and the book was kept in the Eastern Emperor’s Hall. Dongbin read it through, and his divine powers grew great, his holy deeds many. The world called him Lü Zu, or Pure Yang Son, and dared not speak his true name. Dongbin himself called himself sometimes Huidao Ren — ‘Returned Way Man’, for ‘Hui’ is the two mouths of ‘Lu’, with like meaning. He was also called ‘Mountain Rock Master’, the character ‘rock’ split into its parts. He also signed as ‘Gu Ke’ — the combined meaning of his two characters, because he held fast the great vow to save all beings. All the immortals had ascended to heaven, seldom treading the dust; only Lü Zu alone often took human form upon earth, wherever he went changing his name at will to hint at secrets — but that is another story.

Now to return to after Lü Zu’s attainment, he wandered for several years with his master through many places within and without the realm, accomplishing many merits; then his master, together with Tieguai, Caihe, and He Xiangu, four immortals, paid respects to the Supreme Emperor. The Emperor gave a banquet in the Lingxiao Hall, specially sending warm commands, urging him to perform his duties with diligence. After leaving the hall, Zhongli took him to pay homage to the Three Pure Ones, the Queen Mother, and the Mysterious Maiden, bowing before the gods of every mountain and cave. These were the ceremonies requisite upon an immortal’s attainment. When all was done, Zhongli held a banquet in his own mansion, inviting many immortals. At the feast, mention was made of Zhang Guo now in the capital, whom the Tang Emperor wished to see. But he refused to present himself, because the Emperor favoured a band of sorcerers, who filled the palace with demonic airs; Zhang Guo despised to consort with such fellows, yet would not openly oppose evil men, and so hesitated much. Zhongli smiled at Lü Zu, saying: ‘Old Zhang is too stubborn and reserved. Since he is charged with the conduct of the Doom, perhaps he must conform a little to custom. I think that this time you descend from the mountain, you should first go with me to see old Zhang. If you can help him a little, that will be your merit.’ Lü Zu gladly said: ‘Your disciple will go.’ After the feast, each immortal gave gifts, which Lü Zu respectfully accepted. That day he accompanied Zhongli to Chang’an.

At this time Zhang Guo had taken the form of a theatre official, mingling among the Pear Garden. Zhongli found him and introduced Lü Zu, explaining that he came to assist. Zhang Guo was much delighted, laughing and saying: ‘Though I mingle here, I am greatly weary of their noisy and boisterous ways. Now there is a thing most wonderful. There is a sorcerer named Ye Fashan who, before the new Emperor, babbles that in the Pear Garden there is an old man without name or surname, who calls himself Mad Old Man. This man is Zhang Guo’s incarnation, of great magic. The Emperor has several times commanded the eunuchs to summon me. I have feigned illness and dared not go. Meanwhile he has commissioned our chief repeatedly to declare that Mad Old Man is a fool and an old stubborn fellow, who can do nothing but teach plays, having no real skill. He prays the Emperor not to believe the words of the sorcerer.

But when Ye heard this, he was angry to the face and ears, and secretly reported, “If so, the Emperor should summon him to court, to teach these theatre boys to sing before the Emperor’s dragon countenance. Whether he is truly an immortal, we have ways to make him unable to hide.” The Emperor, hearing this lie, immediately summoned our whole troupe to court. I would not show my true form, and entered in the guise of a poor old man. I do not like the official system, so I feigned ignorance and bade them take me for a wild man. The Emperor was much concerned, and after the play was done commanded the eunuchs to summon me. I then changed into a young lad’s shape. The Emperor said, “This is not the man I saw before; that was an old man, but now you summon a child?” The chief was confused, prostrated himself and said, “I am doomed! I truly brought him in as an old man, but do not know how that blink of an eye has changed him so. This man, none of us have ever seen before; whence he came no one knows.”

The Emperor was greatly suspicious, and asked me in person: “Who are you?” I replied that I was a Pear Garden teacher. The Emperor laughed and asked how many teachers were in your troupe? I answered that I alone was the teacher, with two assistants, who had not entered the palace. The Emperor was much amazed, and ordered me to go down and teach another play. When I went down, I turned once more into the old man, and laughter and wonder filled the palace. Ye Fashan could not endure this, and reported to the Emperor: “Your Majesty, surely this man is a mighty immortal; how else could he change shape so before Your Majesty? If he were not a true immortal, how could he have such boldness?” The Emperor, hearing this, nodded several times, and again summoned me, smiling and kindly saying: “Some say you are the immortal Zhang Guo, come to play in the red dust; is this so? I am devoted to the Dao and admire the Immortal Teachings; if indeed you are Immortal Zhang, why not show me your true visage? I wish to receive you with utmost sincerity. Pray dwell in the palace, that I may consult you morning and evening. What say you?”

Lü Zu, hearing this, smiled and asked: “Pray how did you answer, uncle?” Zhang Guo laughed and said: “How could I consent? I merely lied and said, ‘I have never had a friend named Zhang, nor can I write the character Zhang; how can you say I am Immortal Zhang?’ The Emperor, finding no way, had to let us withdraw. Hearing the imperial heart blaming me for being old and young in turns, he nicknamed me Old Man. This word has not been forgotten.’ The two immortals laughed, saying: “A good title, a fine name. This is a fine story in the Pear Garden indeed.”

Immortal Zhong nodded and said: “I have long known you possess a special fate, destined to receive among the arts a cult and veneration. Perhaps this name ‘Old Man’ will be handed down long, who can say?” Immortal Lü laughed and said: “The Pear Garden is the ancestor of all troupes. Old Man has become the progenitor of theatre teachers. If the sacred mouth so promises, the future men of the arts will surely venerate Old Man as a god, and this accords with my master’s words of a special fate.” Zhang Guo laughed aloud at this.

Immortal Zhong then solemnly said: “Since this is a game, it is real indeed. Brother Dao, since you bear a heavy charge and have entered the Forbidden City, how can you be so stubborn, refusing to meet the Emperor? We who have left the world make connections with custom, with no fixed rule. But seeking the benefit of the people, we should all strive to do so. Though the Emperor is fated to suffer calamity, if he can lead and transform true hearts who love the Dao, govern with diligence and love the people, purge desires and cherish blessings, then though doom is fixed, it may yet be averted or the disaster diminished. This benefits both state and people. Such ready merit, how can you not wish to perform it? Otherwise you are not truly a Golden Immortal of Heaven.”

Zhang Guo, hearing this, as if waking from a dream, said: “Your humble servant is ignorant and narrow-sighted, and by nature stubborn, disliking to approach the imperial presence, hence this fault. Now I have been instructed, and my mind is enlightened. Hearing the Emperor’s command to Ye Fashan to hasten and urge me to enter the palace, to be respected as national master and consulted day and night, it seems that Fashan will come soon to seek me. But I have already contrived; if I admit now that I am Zhang Guo, what shall I say to this?” Immortal Lü laughed and said: “That is easy. The Emperor will surely summon the Pear Garden again. Then I may appear as your Mad Old Man, while you sit somewhere high. When His Majesty asks after you, you may speak for yourself and bring him forth. This will not expose your fib, sparing you the crime of deceiving the sovereign; and it will show Ye Fashan’s reports to be false, so the Emperor may distance himself from him and prevent his mischief. This is a plan that gains two ends. What say you, uncle?” Both immortals Zhong and Zhang said: “This plan is excellent!”

The three immortals were thus in discourse when suddenly the Pear Garden chief entered. Zhong and Lü hid themselves. The chief, seeing Zhang Guo, frowned with troubled face, stamping his foot and sighing, saying: “Master, this is truly bad. I know not what joke Master Ye is playing on us, but he is sure to say you are the Great Immortal Zhang. Now the Emperor has summoned us again to perform. It is said to be your solo. He wishes to prove whether you are truly the immortal Zhang. This was said by Master Ye in person. He also told me that if you still will not admit it, first he will imprison me in the Heavenly Prison, then talk to you. Master, though you are not Zhang Immortal, yet you have some power of transformation; otherwise how could you change old and young to produce that play? Since you have such power, when the Emperor summons you, why not admit it in a muddled way? It will be to your advantage, and save my life. Is that not good?”

Zhang Guo laughed and said: “Oh, this Ye Fashan is truly hateful. The Emperor wishes him to find me; he dare not face me, which is well. But why must he frighten others with such lies? Since he is so unreasonable, I cannot but play a trick on him and show the craft of my madness. Chief, do not trouble yourself. When I meet the Emperor, all right and wrong shall be my burden alone, and will not involve you. Rest assured.”

The chief half believed and prepared the costumes and instruments, gathering the troupe, and led Zhang Guo into the palace. At that moment the Old Man’s part was taken by Lü Zu. After entering, the Emperor did not order a play, but summoned the chief and Old Man to appear before him. First there was much gentle urging, repeatedly calling Zhang Guo an immortal and earnestly requesting him to reveal his true form and accept the office of national master. At last, finding Old Man still would not admit it, the Emperor’s face darkened with anger, and he ordered the chief to be arrested and thrown into prison. The chief was pale as death, prostrated before the throne, striking his head till it bled.

Lü Zu could not help laughing secretly, and then loudly asked: “May it please Your Majesty to say how you know this man is the immortal Zhang?” The Emperor said it was because Master Ye said so. Lü Zu then said: “I would fain see Master Ye and ask him for the truth.” The Emperor was troubled, for when Master Ye said these things he repeatedly begged not to be named. To call him forth to testify would be a breach of trust. At last he smiled and said: “You need not seek to see Master Ye; he is not much given to seeing men.”

Lü Zu bowed and said: “I do not need to see Master Ye; but after the court I would ponder why Your Majesty takes me for Zhang Immortal, and so must seek my master, Immortal Zhong. Zhong said, ‘To see Zhang Immortal is not hard, except that Master Ye himself must go to Zhongnan.’ From this it appears I am not Zhang Immortal. Zhang Immortal may be on Zhongnan Mountain, but the Master must be sent to ask.” The Emperor asked: “Why did you not say this at first, but only after I would seize the chief did you speak?” Lü Zu replied: “I feared Master Ye’s blame and dared not interfere. Now seeing Your Majesty’s thunderous anger, if I did not speak truly, I would offend the sacred heart and bring guilt upon the chief; that is my fault. How dare I keep fearing and bring upon myself disaster?” The Emperor bowed and dismissed him. Presently Master Ye was summoned. Lü Zu and others waited below the steps and saw the Emperor point at him, saying that Old Man was not the true immortal, and that the true immortal was at Zhongnan, bidding him seek him in person. Then Master Ye prostrated himself, saying something unknown. The Emperor’s countenance showed displeasure, and he withdrew angrily.

Lü Zu returned to the Pear Garden and laughed heartily at Zhang Guo, saying: “Uncle, you may now breathe freely. Tell Zhong and Zhang what has passed.” Both immortals laughed, saying: “This method is excellent. Early tomorrow morning, Ye Fashan will surely come seeking Old Man. You must deal with him, making him take a tiresome journey. Then by such and such a method you may first go to see the Emperor, so that he need not send for you, and Ye Fashan will have no chance to seek merit.” Lü Zu smiled and assented.

The next morning, indeed Ye Fashan came, seeking Old Man. Lü Zu again assumed the guise of the false Old Man and went to meet him, asking his purpose. Fashan hesitated and said: “I dare not deceive; it is because of my carelessness that I spoke before the Emperor that the Great Immortal Zhang Guo is here. The Emperor’s urgent desire for worthy men and deep love for the Dao compel him to find the Great Immortal at once. But alas, the Great Immortal refuses to admit it, and instead recommended me to make a journey to Zhongnan Mountain. Now I do not mention other things, but ask if you really know whether Zhang Immortal is there or not. If truly Immortal Zhang is there, I shall run the journey, seeking the worthy for the nation — who would say not to seek him? But if there is no Immortal Zhang there, how shall I report? For this I earnestly come to pray that you will speak truly for my sake and the Emperor’s; it would please us beyond measure.”

Lü Zu saw that he was still obstinate, thinking: ‘Unless I show him some power, he will think us fools.’ He smiled and said: “Master, you speak too highly. What manner of man am I, that I should take the Emperor’s favour or your great presence? As to whether Zhongnan Mountain has Zhang Immortal, I have only heard my master say this in jest. Now my master has gone to Tiantai, and I do not know when he will return. I have no way to inquire. Pardon my presumption; I have no words and am most anxious. I pray you pardon me.”

Ye Fashan was filled with anger, thinking: “Clearly you are Zhang Guo himself. Where else would I find a second Zhang Guo?” Yet he dared not say so openly, and endured his rage. He asked softly: “Whether there be a true immortal at Zhongnan, I do not care. But I ask if you are Zhang Immortal, may I then be granted an audience? I pray you to speak for me, and not delay.” His face flushed red with haste and terror. Lü Zu saw his stubbornness and intended to test him further, but seeing his distress was moved to pity, and smiled: “I have said I have no relation to Zhang Immortal; how can I say whether he will see you or not? All I report is truth, and I see no evasion. Is there some fault in what I say? But I will not trouble you further. Since you ask thus, I will report as I know. I have asked my master if the Emperor should send for Great Immortal Zhang, whether he would grant an audience. My master laughed and said: ‘Immortals base their conduct on loyalty and filial piety, and regard aid to others as their aim. If the Emperor himself should go to Zhongnan, surely he would welcome him with all sincerity. But if he sends others, it depends on their sincerity; if they show the least disrespect, craftiness, or if they meet the immortal without true heart and try to deceive with words and tests, then not only will they not see Zhang Immortal, but even if they do, he will refuse to accompany them and may give them a lesson.’” Hearing this, Fashan broke out in cold sweat, but was comforted by these words, which assured him that if he went with true heart he would be received. He hurriedly saluted Lü Zu, thanked him, and took his leave.

A day later, Fashan took the Emperor’s commission and set out for Zhongnan. The journey took more than one day; the way was lonely and difficult, crossing mountains and ridges. Though he had some minor magic, he could not soar on clouds nor shrink the earth beneath him, and so went by carriage, horse, and on foot. Sometimes he failed to reach an inn or missed a meal, enduring hunger and waiting till dawn. If he met robbers or beasts, he must fight for his life. Such hardship was rare even in his former cultivation. Now as a sorcerer and close servant of the Emperor, he had to endure these pains and labours. Moreover, having been taught by Lü Zu, he dared not complain, truly a calamity without cause.

Whether Zhang Guo met him at Zhongnan, we shall see in the next chapter.
