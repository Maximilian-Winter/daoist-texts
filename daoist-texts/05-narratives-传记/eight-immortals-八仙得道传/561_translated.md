# Chapter 93: Ye Fashan Respectfully Pays Homage to Zhang Guolao; Lü Chunyang’s Three Trials of Bai Mudan

Now it happened that Ye Fashan, having endured hardship and bitterness, borne hunger and thirst, travelled many a league and passed through countless perils, yet with a sincere and earnest heart, dared not utter a word of complaint. At length he arrived upon Zhongnan Mountain.

At this time, Zhongli Quan, having parted from Lü and Zhang, two immortals, intended to journey beyond the seas to visit friends. He commanded the two immortals to remain in the capital, whilst he himself, in the meantime, should represent Zhang Guolao at the foot of Zhongnan Mountain, assuming the guise of a Taoist boy, awaiting the arrival of Fashan.

Zhongli Quan busied himself gathering herbs, paying no heed to him. But Fashan, as one who had found a precious treasure, hastened forward, saluting him and saying, “Little brother, I am much obliged.” Zhongli turned his head to look, still attending to his tasks, but murmured to himself, “Whence comes this rustic fellow, who has barely lived four or five decades, and dares call me little brother? If you would be my grandson, you are a good ten thousand years too soon.” Fashan, hearing this, was sorely amazed and said, “So you are a Taoist master. I, poor Taoist, have words to ask, and humbly beg you not to withhold your instruction.” Zhongli flung down the implements in his hand and asked, “What is it you would ask? Has a messenger from the capital been sent to summon the Great Immortal Zhang?” Fashan was more greatly alarmed, and quickly prostrated himself, saying, “Indeed so! Your disciple Ye Fashan, by imperial command, has been specially sent to invite the Great Immortal. I pray that the Taoist Master will communicate the matter for me.” Zhongli answered not a word, but still muttered, “Had I known you were so respectful, I had not needed to suffer such hardships; nor what devilish misfortune has caused me to lose so much time.”

Fashan understood that the boy mocked him, yet dared not reply; standing respectfully aside, he waited patiently for his answer. Zhongli smiled and said, “Foolish fellow, return home, for he long since has become the imperial tutor. Why do you linger here?” Fashan was struck dumb, and said, “So the Great Immortal Zhang, having received the message, has already gone to the capital.” Zhongli spat and said, “What is this going to the capital? What is first going and then coming? They are great Celestial Immortals of the Great Luo Heaven, shining as the sun and moon, everywhere present, one with heaven and earth, responsive and efficacious. To say he is in the capital is to say he is not here; to say he went first, perhaps he yet sets out behind you. This little universe is nothing at all. You, running about in your sweat and filth, fancy you have travelled a thousand leagues, but in the eyes of the immortals, whatever the distance, it is but a step or two. What matter is it? Go, go! I have really no time to trouble myself with you.” Saying this, he turned again, picked up his implements, and resumed gathering herbs.

Fashan was stunned a while, and suddenly a thought arose in his heart, doubting whether the boy before him was none other than the Immortal Zhang. If he were to miss him face to face, it would be a jest for all men. Should he be deceived into setting out, yet not go himself, would it not bring his death? While pondering, he saw the boy fling down his implements again, laughing aloud: “I will tell you, and you who think thus are truly bewitched. Where in the world are there deceiving immortals? Since you come with sincerity, he has perceived your humble mind, granted your request, and is already in the palace. If you do not believe me, rent a cottage near this mountain, and wait for the Great Immortal Zhang to retire; surely there shall be a day when you meet him.”

Hearing this, Fashan knew that Zhang Guolao had indeed never left the capital. This boy, whether his transformation or friend, he knew not; but he lamented his own shallow cultivation, which prevented him from discerning clearly. With this thought, Zhongli laughed heartily: “Since you know your cultivation is insufficient, why do you not hasten home and apply yourself? Yet you vaunt your slight skill, taking upon yourself to act as a magician — is it not a jest?” Fashan, seeing that he knew all beforehand, as if he had looked into his very heart and liver, was greatly terrified, and prostrated himself. Zhongli laughed again: “I tell you to return, yet you will not go; I advise you to stay and study, yet you will not consent, but only entangle yourself with me in idle talk. Very well, I pity you, who have come a long way, enduring hardship and scare enough. Now I will send you with a gust of wind back to the capital.” Saying so, he opened his mouth and called forth a mighty wind, which suddenly caught Ye Fashan from the plain and bore him aloft to the ninth heaven, drifting as a kite loosed from its string, blowing northward. Fashan, frightened, shut his eyes, not daring move hand or foot. After a time the wind seemed to cease, and his body seemed to have found footing; he opened his eyes and, behold, to his amazement, he was lying in his own bed. Hastily looking about, not a doubt, it was indeed his own dwelling. This so startled him that he cried out, rousing servants and women of the inner chamber to come inquire. Seeing Fashan, one and all were dumbfounded, not knowing what to make of it.

Fashan’s wife, Madam Wang, first asked: “Ah, when did you return? How is it that you did not enter from outside, nor look about the house, but lay down to sleep here first?” Hearing this, Fashan closed his eyes again, and recalling all the past scenes and the manner of his return, reviewed it all, then suddenly rubbed his eyes and asked, “Are we not dreaming?” Wang spat and said, “In broad daylight, what dream could there be?” This caused all present to laugh. Fashan collected himself, and, barely audible, bade all depart, leaving only Madam Wang in the chamber, to whom he related the entire affair.

Madam Wang understood somewhat, and, hearing this, laughed: “I thought you were a man of the Tao, yet you fail to see this simple truth. One who has attained the Great Luo Heaven Immortality naturally possesses boundless magic powers and vast supernatural faculties. As I see it, all these events from start to finish are naught but the Great Immortal Zhang playing a jest upon you. He was angered by your chatter and lack of reverence, and so made you suffer some hardship. Now seeing your heartfelt sincerity, the immortal will not treat you harshly, but send you home with a gust of wind. In short, the old fool, the old sir, the old sir’s master, the Taoist boy of Zhongnan — all are illusions of the Old Zhang himself. From beginning to end, it is just so. Frankly, with your chattering tongue, he but made sport of you.” Fashan still doubted, and so tidied his attire and hastened to the palace. There he found the emperor and an old Taoist engaged in deep discourse upon profound scriptures. Then he was fully convinced of his wife’s insight.

The emperor, seeing him return, smiled and said, “You have laboured much on this journey.” Fashan, knowing that the Taoist was Zhang Guolao, at once bowed and said, “The Taoist Master Zhang is indeed come. Your humble servant, for a word of loose speech, nearly failed to return. Farewell, Your Majesty.” The emperor smiled and enquired as to the circumstances. Fashan rose and saluted Zhang Guolao, saying, “Your Majesty need not ask of me; all matters lie within this Imperial Tutor’s breast. Your Majesty may question him at leisure.” Zhang Guolao laughed and said, “Nonsense! Have you forgotten how your wife spoke to you?” Thereafter Zhang Guolao was installed by imperial decree in the Academy of Worthies, attending court each day in the palace. At leisure he was summoned to the palace to expound on Taoist mysteries. At first he hoped the emperor might cultivate heart and virtue, becoming a sage ruler. Despite the calamities, some recovery might yet be possible. This emperor, Emperor Xuanzong, at first was diligent and loving of the people, the Kaiyuan era being compared with the Zhenguan of old.

Later, as the world grew peaceful and the people joyous and prosperous, this emperor became arrogant, licentious, and befogged. After the change of era to Tianbao, he had the favored consort Yang Yuhuan, and the minister An Lushan, who colluded in wanton debaucheries within the palace. The ministers formed factions, disturbing the realm. Zhang Guolao, having served long at court, saw the world troubled, and that the doom was set. This An Lushan was the old fox reborn at the foot of Mt. Tianping. His deeds were beyond bounds. Knowing the realm would soon be in chaos, and unable to save it, why linger long at court? After court one day, he spoke with Lü Zu of his desire to retire. Lü Zu, however, had lately fallen into a delightful affair. Hearing Zhang Guolao speak, he laughed and said, “Master Uncle, you would fain depart. I have taken a lover, and just now things are at their best. How could I bear to leave the capital in such a time?” Zhang Guolao laughed and said, “Immortals have lovers? That must be a jest of yours.” Lü Zu replied seriously, “Why should immortals not have lovers? If you have no great affairs, come with me and see my lover, truly a peerless beauty, worthy of my devotion.” Zhang Guolao, hearing this sudden speech, said, “I will go with you for a play.” Saying so, he rose to accompany him. Lü Zu laughed: “Wait! In such a fragrant and dazzling place, we are thus dressed — is it not somewhat improper?” Zhang Guolao smiled: “So you do not meet others in your true form. This shows your lack of sincerity; how can you call that a lover?”

This silenced Lü Zu, and the two smiled at each other. Lü Zu transformed into a young scholar; Zhang Guolao took the semblance of a middle-aged merchant. The two left the Academy of Worthies, walking through many streets and markets, until they reached a large courtyard. Lü Zu knocked on the door, which was opened by a servant in humble dress, who greeted him as Young Lord Wang, with a smiling and respectful countenance; he also bowed to Zhang Guolao. Zhang Guolao smiled: “You have some face, though reduced to Young Lord Wang.” Lü Zu quickly gestured for him to say no more. The two entered, passed through a great hall and a long corridor, to the main inner chamber. Zhang Guolao whispered to Lü Zu, “Pray, what place is this?”

Lü Zu whispered back: “Master Uncle, it is not good to ask; you shall know soon enough.” Zhang Guolao was puzzled. Presently, many young women in rich apparel came forth from the rear chamber, all smiling brightly, and called out to Young Lord Wang. Among them was one woman, most beautiful of countenance, though somewhat older, yet of natural grace and charm, surpassing the rest. Lü Zu smiled to Zhang Guolao and said, “This is my lover, Bai Mudan.”

Hearing the name Bai Mudan, and seeing the scene, Zhang Guolao knew that Lü Zu’s play had brought them to a brothel. Though inwardly he could not restrain his laughter, he held it back. Bai Mudan parted the crowd and approached, taking one of the two immortals by each hand, drawing them in. Passing behind the hall was a small flower chamber. On either side hung heavy curtains, fragrant with incense. Bai Mudan led the two immortals into a room at the east end. Zhang Guolao, looking up, saw the furnishings were all exquisite. Most striking was a small couplet hanging beside the dressing table, bearing the signature of a certain Taoist. Pointing at Lü Zu, he laughed aloud. Lü Zu said, “What is there to laugh at? Master Uncle, you are too easily amazed.” Zhang Guolao said, “I laugh not at other things, but at your great passion. Are you not afraid to fall into the Avici hell?” Lü Zu laughed: “Better to die beneath the peony, and be a ghost of grace. She is called Bai Mudan; I would gladly die for her.” Zhang Guolao made no reply. Bai Mudan would not suffer such words, but stretched out her slender hand and covered his mouth, smiling: “When one speaks, one desires auspiciousness. I have not seen a gentleman so always speaking of death and life. You would die for me, yet do you know I would not die for you?”

The two immortals laughed heartily. Bai Mudan, seeing their laughter, feigned shyness and anger, clung to Lü Zu, and began to dispute with him. Lü Zu hastened to excuse himself: “Good sister, I was but jesting with you; why be angry with me?” Zhang Guolao sat aside, shaking his head and smiling: “You are indeed to be commended for such skill.” Lü Zu said seriously: “That is naught. I yet intend to invite Master Uncle to a drinking party! After the feast, this night your humble servant means to be wanton, and live some amorous hours with this sister.” Zhang Guolao laughed: “Enough! That drinking party is best entrusted to others. I, an old man caught between you, may not displease you.” Lü Zu laughed: “Master Uncle is truly an ancient gentleman. If so, I will invite other friends, and hold another feast another day.”

They laughed and talked a while longer. Zhang Guolao prepared to leave. Lü Zu accompanied him out of the courtyard and back to the Academy dwelling. Zhang Guolao marveled at this affair, and knowing Lü Zu had no idle intent, laughed and asked the cause. Lü Zu then told him: “As to this woman, we are old acquaintances. In a former life she was called Xiao Jinzi, surname Zhu. Before I studied sword in Mount Lu, we had such a connection. I then once spoke a word of consent to her. Now, by chance we meet here. After my success in swordsmanship, the Great Immortal Miss once jested with me. At that time my cultivation was shallow, and I thought it a jest. Now I know that a cultivator may not lightly promise another. Because of that one word, I owe a debt of sin. Moreover, I came to the capital, and this woman was twice reborn, falling into the brothel. Seeing her form, spirit, speech, and manner precisely as in her former life, I was moved, and recalled the words of the Immortal Miss, and secretly reckoned — surely she has great destiny, and must be saved by me. Therefore I resolved to take this opportunity to promote her, so as not to lose the fate of our former lives.”

Hearing this, Zhang Guolao suddenly understood and said, “I thought you had some reason at heart; so that is the matter. Then no wonder you have taken a lover.” Lü Zu said, “To tell you truly, I have already put her to two tests. The first was to try her conscience. As a child she was cruel and ruthless in holding her mother captive. Such a heart is hardly human. But then she was defending herself, and this was somewhat excusable. I played hard with her. One day, pretending to be gravely ill and dying, I watched her weep and beseech physicians and soothsayers, a very sincere show.”

Zhang Guolao laughed and said, “You were deceived. In such places, where is true sincerity? Though she wept in earnest, it was but another trick to deceive.” Lü Zu would not let him finish, shaking his head and laughing: “Master Uncle is too scrupulous. Such courtesan arts only deceive men. If even we immortals were deceived, then... then...” He left the sentence hanging; Zhang Guolao took it up: “Then what? Then you become a courtesan among immortals.” This caused Lü Zu to laugh heartily. He added: “The second test was to try her courage, whether she had a determination to give her life. This test pleased me greatly. Now I am to proceed to the third test.” Zhang Guolao laughed: “This is no longer immortal testing mortal, nor gentleman playing courtesan, but a national examination of talent. I fear for you that your methods, though with secret intent, may in time be misrepresented and transformed by later generations into ‘Lü Chunyang’s Three Trials of Bai Mudan,’ rendered in song and drama, with white-haired old women and yellow-mouthed children acting the parts of amorous immortals, transmitted as eternal legend. I wonder whether you could endure it?” Lü Zu laughed: “Others will not play such pranks. Unless it be you, Master Uncle, who would make sport of your humble servant. Should you utter one word, the tale would spread, and the three trials become three tricks. Fortunately, I hold to practical helpfulness, and keep my honour; my heart is clear, and I heed not such matters. As for the words ‘amorous immortal,’ what ill name! It is hard for an immortal to be amorous, and how can an amorous man become immortal? Now I am both immortal and amorous; amorous and yet immortal — is this not the finest tale of immortals? I willingly accept this fair title.” Zhang Guolao laughed: “Very well, I will fulfil your wish, and spread your amorous fame among future generations.” So they laughed together.

Later, when the Eight Immortals convened, Zhang Guolao told this story to the assembly. Among them, Lan Caihe was most mischievous, and Han Xiangzi also playful, and they fabricated a whimsical tale, entitled “Lü Chunyang’s Three Tricks on Bai Mudan.” It spoke largely that Lü Zu was by nature carefree, the most amorous and unrestrained of immortals. This was the playful invention of Han and Lan, yet later generations took it for truth. As Zhang Guolao said: “Shaped into poetry and drama, known even to women and children.” Lü Zu’s amorous immortal was indeed famed. Yet the story contained evident incongruities. Such jest among fellow cultivators was no harm. But if uttered by the vulgar, it were not only disrespectful, but a jest to be scorned by Taoists — a most unseemly thing. Therefore later generations held the “Three Tricks of Bai Mudan” was another Lü Dongbin, unrelated to Lü Zu, to correct the record.

This explanation, though well meant, cannot be blamed; but it is no fundamental correction. The author of this book, having investigated many secret texts, has obtained the story of the Three Trials, and knowing the cause of the erroneous “Three Tricks,” has hastened to relate it fully. Henceforth, such slanders of sage and disrespect may cease.

Again, Lü Zu told Zhang Guolao of the two trials on Bai Mudan. Zhang Guolao asked about the third. Lü Zu laughed: “Such matters arise as occasion serves; there is no fixed principle. Now I would ask Master Uncle how best to withdraw from court affairs.” Zhang Guolao sighed: “Since I entered court as imperial tutor, twenty years have swiftly passed in the mortal realm. Seeing the emperor grow ever more licentious and confused, he invited me to court. Except for rare moments when we discuss Taoist scriptures, it is but pastime and jest. One matter more than all makes it impossible for me to remain: that fox reborn at Tianping Mountain, An Lushan, who desecrates the palace and commits many vile deeds. The emperor is ignorant, and calls him his godson. Such shameful acts I cannot endure. My true heart would have him put to death at once. I ask how he preached before, and why upon entering the world he should act thus. But as he is born to calamity, how can I restrain him? Since I must leave, best to go early and be free and clean. Nephew, what think you of this?” Lü Zu, striking upon a plan, laughed: “Master Uncle, have you calculated when you may return to the mountains?” Zhang Guolao said: “Not yet laid out.” Lü Zu smiled: “I have reckoned for you; in about three or five days you may leave court and retire. But you must bring a disciple with you. Keep this counsel secret, and it shall surely come to pass.” Zhang Guolao said nothing more.

How Lü Zu performed the three trials on Bai Mudan, and when Zhang Guolao returned to the mountains, we shall see in the next chapter.
