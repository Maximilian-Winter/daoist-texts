# Preface

The human heart is but the breadth of a finger; if it thinks good, it is of the nature of the Immortal; if it thinks not good, it is of the nature of the Mortal. How should Immortal and Mortal be a path apart? The difference lies only in the withdrawal of the fences and barriers within oneself. Sa Jun was a man of the Five Dynasties, whose rank was recorded in the registers of the Western River of Shu; formerly he was an Immortal. Yet when one examines closely, he was but a petty clerk, who changed his profession to that of the Xuanqi school; but his practice was not yet perfected in samādhi. He afterwards became a follower of the Dharma school, and passed his days in doubt and discrimination; it is not a matter to be measured by years. But his mind had something to admire; no profit could vex it; his thoughts were fixed on one point; no desire could shake it; his spirit was concentrated alone; no peril or obstruction could discourage it — such was the purity of his heart.
In antiquity the tranquil ones — whether Confucius among the scholars, or Muni among the Buddhists — were of like rank and standing; thus their merits covered the six curtains, and their beneficence flowed over nine regions. They entered and came forth from the hidden and the manifest, and ministered to the people and things; the heavenly hosts then raised them and enrolled them among the pivot of heaven.
Alas! Alas! When did Sa Jun ever swallow moonlight, eat the essence of the sun, gnaw on the fumes of the mist, boil the yellow and cook the white, wash the marrow and cut the hair? This was but the work of the mind. Therefore I say: Immortal and Mortal are not a path apart, but in the withdrawal of the fences and barriers within oneself. When the fences and barriers are withdrawn, one can master the thoughts and become sage; when the fences and barriers are not withdrawn, one is lost in wild fancies. Immortal and Mortal are indeed the key and lock of the human heart.
At leisure I have examined the collection entitled The Search for Spirits, admiring Sa Jun’s spontaneous kindly influence, and have selected his remaining deeds, unfolding them in the Record of the Cursed Dates. The cursed dates are a single example embracing all methods and arts. This is not only to elucidate the Jade Registers of the Immortal families, but also to exalt the spirit and brightness of those who cultivate the heart.
If any should regard this as an ungrounded theory, and the clamour of flutes and drums be loud in the land, how then should I dare? How then should I dare?
