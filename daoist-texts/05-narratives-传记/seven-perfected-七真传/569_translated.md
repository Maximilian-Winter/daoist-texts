# Chapter the First: Charity in Poverty, Compassion by Chance — Entering Dreams, Clearly Pointing the Future

In the practice of goodness one should proceed from what is real; let not vain fame and empty honour be sought.

What use are vain name and empty honour? They but provoke the poor to utter their grievances.

In the late days of the Yan and Song, in the county of Xianyang in Shaanxi, there was a great village called Dawei. Within the village were more than a hundred households, the greater part bearing the name Wang, so that it might be reckoned a large clan. Within this Wang clan was a widow woman, whose age was more than forty; beneath her knees were a son and a daughter. She had once given them in marriage, but the widow’s nature was charitable and kind. When she saw the little boys and girls of others, she took them as if they were her own flesh and blood, never ceasing to scold and coax them as if they were her children. When these little ones cried, they cried aloud to call her mother, and she would answer them with a word, so that all called her Wang Mama.

This Wang Mama’s house was somewhat ample, and in her days she loved to do good works, most fond of the Buddhist and Daoist ways. She often gave alms to monks and priests, and bowed to Buddha and read the scriptures. All said she practised benevolence, so that many monks and priests came to her door to collect alms. Also there were many poor who came to the village to beg; whether more or less, she always gave timely help. In the late winter of that year, snow fell thickly in the skies. Wang Mama stood at her door, and saw two beggars coming through the snow to seek her charity. Wang Mama reproved them, saying, ‘You do not go to hire work and earn your living, but come from door to door to beg; you are not lovers of food but lazy idlers who seek idle ease. Where then are the many empty cups and meals to serve you?’ Before she had ended, several monks and priests came to collect alms. Wang Mama gave them money and grain, and after the monks and priests had gone, the two beggars asked, ‘Good woman, you delight to give to monks and priests, but not to the poor and indigent; what is the cause of this?’ Wang Mama said, ‘It is not that I love to give to monks and priests. They can recite scriptures, they can practise the Way. Though I give them some money and grain, the monks may avert my misfortunes, the priests may prolong my life. But to give to you, what good would it do? It would only make a clamour at my door.’ The two beggars said, ‘To give grace without expectation of return is grace indeed; to expect return is not grace. You now give a handful of grain, a few coins; and yet you would thereby avert misfortune and prolong life — is it not absurd?’ Saying this, they departed.

Giving alms to priests and monks to establish good relations, but sparing not a thought for the poor and suffering.

The poor and lonely are also worthy of pity; Heaven regards good deeds of this kind as foremost.

Now these two beggars, seeing that Wang Mama would not give, proceeded onwards. After a short while they reached a vermilion-gated mansion, where they loudly called ‘Grandfather!’ and begged for charity. Soon a man came forth. His face was ruddy, with long beard; his countenance was clear and spirited; he bore the magnanimity of a generous man, the bearing of a chivalrous one; his age was about forty. This man’s surname was Wang, his given name Ji, his courtesy name Zhiming, and styled Desheng. In his youth he had read poetry and books, but had failed in the examinations, and therefore abandoned letters to practise the martial arts, and was made champion among the martial candidates, also holding the office of filial and incorruptible. On this day, snow fell heavily, and the cold was intense. He sat with his wife Zhou and son Qiulang before the hall, warming by the fire, when suddenly he heard a shouting at the door, ‘Grandfather! We beg for charity!’ Wang Wuju found this cry strange, and went out to see two beggars standing at the door. Wang Wuju asked them plainly, ‘Do you seek charity from Grandfather, or is Grandfather seeking charity from you?’ The beggars replied, ‘It is not meet to speak freely; to speak freely would breed suspicion.’ Wang Wuju, seeing that their words were reasonable, asked no further.

At that time the wind blew strongly and the snow fell thickly, whirling in the air like pear blossoms falling in profusion; the mountains were deserted of birds, the roads cut off from men’s footsteps. Wang Wuju saw the beggars wore but a single layer of clothing, how could they endure such cold? Suddenly a feeling of compassion arose in his heart. He said to the beggars, ‘Let us put aside those idle words. In such great snow, how can you journey on? At the side of this gate is an empty room, within which is a heap of stray grasses; you may sit or lie there. Why not come in and shelter from the snow?’ The beggars answered, ‘That would be excellent.’ Wang Wuju opened the empty room, and the beggars entered and took refuge there. Wang Wuju returned to the hall and bade his servant Yuwa bring out some food for the beggars to eat.

There are some who are ready to give from their means, and welcome poverty within.

Only in those days was Wang Wuju so generous in nurture and growth.

The two beggars abode within Wang Wuju’s house for two days; the sky then cleared, and they purposed to take their leave. At that moment Wang Wuju entered, and behind him Yuwa carried wine and food. Wuju said to the two beggars, ‘I have been busy these days, and could not come to keep you company; today I am free, and desire to drink a cup with you, and talk of cold and warmth; is it agreeable?’ The two beggars answered eagerly, ‘Excellent!’ Wang Wuju bade Yuwa set the cups and dishes, and the two beggars did not refuse nor thank, but fell to eating and drinking; in a moment, they emptied two jars. Wang Wuju bade Yuwa bring more wine, and as the beggars drank heartily, Wang Wuju said, ‘Friends, what are your surnames and names? What business have you followed in life?’ The beggars answered, ‘We can do no business. He is called Jin Zhong; I am called Wuxin Chang.’ Wang Wuju said, ‘I would fain gather some capital with you, to do some small trade to earn a living; would not this be better than begging? What say you?’ When he had finished, Jin Zhong waved his hand and said, ‘It is ill; ill indeed. I have long been used to a light and careless life; I am not fit to do such troublesome things.’ Wang Wuju saw that Jin Zhong would not engage in business, and asked Wuxin Chang, ‘Since Brother Jin will not do this small trade for a living, are you willing?’ Wuxin Chang answered, ‘My carelessness is even greater! I have heard that the domestic fowl has the soup-pot near at hand; the wild crane has no grain but flies free on high. If I seek petty profit from trifling gain, how can I attain to leisure?’ 

Wang Wuju sighed and said, ‘From your words I see your loftiness of spirit; yet now the world prizes robes and caps, delights in silver and coin. If you are thus pure and indifferent, who will recognise you?’ Wuxin Chang said, ‘We do not desire to be known; if we did, we should not fall to begging.’ Hearing these words, Wang Wuju saw their surpassing speech, and spoke no more, but bade Yuwa clear away the cups and enter.

The next day the two beggars took leave and rose to go; Wang Wuju escorted them out of the village, yet lingered with reluctance, and went some steps farther with them. Suddenly he saw a bridge blocking the way. Wang Wuju thought within himself, ‘There was no bridge before the village either behind or before.’ He looked back at Dawei village, but it was faint and unclear in the distance. As he was in doubt, Wuxin Chang called him back, ‘Filial and incorruptible sir, come quickly.’ Wang Wuju turned and saw the two sitting by the bridge. Jin Zhong clapped his hands and sang:

‘Wealth gathers and scatters; robes and caps at length decay:  
How unlike ourselves, who dwell beyond the world!  
We owe not grain to the state, nor debts to sons and daughters;  
We speak not of good or bad, nor of rise and fall.  
We hold no commerce with the world, to avoid their blame.  
A tattered sleeve-coat, year after year I wear it;  
When rotten I patch it anew, wash it and dry it in the sun.  
By day it shields my body; at night it serves as bedding.  
No thief need fear to steal it, no petty man need love it.  
Ever cherishing high ambition, one heart to wander the upper realms.  
If men knew my mind, they would bow down in reverence.  
I hold a truth without end, which shall last a thousand years:  
Alas that men know it not, turning grace to harm.’

Wang Wuju hastened to the bridge; Wuxin Chang said, ‘Sir, having escorted you far, I must offer you a drink.’ Saying this, he took from his sleeve a small tin bottle, covered a cup, took it out and poured fine wine, and handed it to Wang Wuju. Wang Wuju took it in hand and drank it all at once; thrice he drank, and was drunk upon the bridge, drowsy and ready to sleep. Suddenly he saw Wuxin Chang coming to him, who took him by the hand and said, ‘Do not sleep, do not sleep; come with us to see a sight.’ Wang Wuju, drunken and dazed, followed Wuxin Chang a few steps and saw a lofty mountain, towering before the path. Wang Wuju exclaimed, ‘So high a mountain! How can one climb it?’ The Golden Boy said, ‘Follow me, and you may ascend with ease.’ Wang Wuju indeed followed him, without difficulty. In a moment they reached the summit, which was very level; there was a great pool, filled with clear water. In the water bloomed seven golden lotuses, large as plates, exceeding lovely. Wang Wuju’s heart greatly admired them, and he praised, saying, ‘Beautiful lotuses! Beautiful lotuses! How can I pluck one to keep?’

Before Wang Wuju had finished speaking, Wuxin Chang leapt into the pool, plucked the seven golden lotuses together, and gave them to Wang Wuju, saying, ‘I give these to you; take good care of the seven lotuses. There are seven masters — Qiu, Liu, Tan, Ma, Hao, Wang, and Sun; these seven stand to you as master and disciples. When you meet in days to come, be good to enlighten one another, so that you may not fail the trust I place in you by giving you these lotuses.’ Wang Wuju took the lotuses and held them to his breast. About to return home, he asked Wuxin Chang when they might meet again. Wuxin Chang said, ‘The time of meeting is not far; only two threes — still to meet from the place of parting, at the bridge where ten thousand ties are ended.’ Hearing this, Wang Wuju moved down the mountain; suddenly his foot caught upon a vine by the roadside, and he fell headlong down the mountain. What became of his life and fate, we shall hear in the next chapter.
