# Chapter the Second: Patriarch Lü Personally Transmits the Way on the Bridge of Myriad Affinities — The Worthy Youth of Great Wei Feigns a Stroke

To attain enlightenment is as when in the night a lamp is obtained; a dark chamber without window suddenly becomes bright.

If this body is not to be delivered in this present life, then when else shall it be delivered?

It is told that Wang the Worthy Youth, embracing seven lotus flowers, descended the mountain; when suddenly his foot was caught by vines and creepers, and he fell headlong. Awakened with a start, all phenomena were void, and it had been but a dream. Opening his eyes, he found himself lying in the study chamber of his own home. His son, Qiulang, stood beside him. Wang the Worthy Youth coughed once; Qiulang heard and cried aloud, “Father is awake! Father is awake!” This cry alarmed Lady Zhou, who hastened to inquire, saying, “Has my lord awakened from his drink?” Wang the Worthy Youth said, “Most strange! Most strange!” Lady Zhou replied, “All things proceed from self-delusion; why is it strange?” Wang the Worthy Youth said, “I clearly sent the guests away; how is it that they are still within the house?” Lady Zhou answered, “My lord is too dissipated. Yesterday you sent away two beggars, who did not return for half a day. We sought for them several times, but all in vain. I was uneasy, and sent Second Uncle Wang Maotong with Yuwa to search for you. They found you, some twenty li away, lying drunk upon the bridge, senseless and stupefied. They hired a carriage and brought you home. You have slept a whole day and night, and just now awakened. Henceforth, my lord must cherish himself, drink less wine, act uprightly, and avoid intercourse with those of unknown origin. Now that you bear the imperial badge, and are revered by our townsfolk, how can you lie prostrate in the wilderness? Is it not a loss of dignity, to be laughed at by the country folk?”

Wang the Worthy Youth rose and thanked her, saying, “Lady, your words are like medicine and stone; how could I not engrave them upon my heart? I think those two poor fellows were surely two immortals.” Lady Zhou said, “Plainly they were two beggars; how can you say they were two immortals?” Wang the Worthy Youth said, “By their speech and by their movements I knew they must be immortals.” Lady Zhou asked, “What words did they speak? What deeds did they perform? Where was their resemblance to immortals?” Wang the Worthy Youth then recounted how they helped him gather capital and how he declined it, and on the morrow how they sent him on his way for but a few steps, then at some twenty li distant, how they sang, how they offered wine, how they gathered lotus on the mountain, and their words at parting — all these he repeated to Lady Zhou in full. He added, “I drank but three cups of their wine, and drank for a whole day and night. Such strange and wondrous things! Were they not immortals, whence such marvels?” Lady Zhou said, “I have heard men say that there are all sorts of scoundrels in the world, who have the art of traversing the earth in an instant, and with a single step cover ten li; they may travel a thousand li in a day. They add opiates to their wine, and keep it at hand. When they see a lone merchant or trader, they offer wine. Once the lips have touched the wine, the victim is stupefied and unconscious; then they steal the money and strip the clothes. When you awoke, no trace of them was to be found. If one is not wary beforehand, one will only repent at the end.”

When Lady Zhou had spoken, Wang the Worthy Youth reflected: Lady Zhou is after all a woman, and if he were to contend with her, he surely could not explain himself clearly; better to follow her counsel and settle the matter thus. So he replied casually, “Lady, your words are right; I will certainly be mindful.” Lady Zhou withdrew. Wang the Worthy Youth often sat alone in the study, pondering the words of Jintong Wuxin Chang, revolving them over and over and silently understanding their principle. After many days, he suddenly awakened to the characters “Jin” and “Zhong”: joined together they form the character “Zhong” (bell). Wu Xinchang’s “Wuxin Chang” — the character “Chang” without the “Xin” is the character “Lü.” Clearly it was the two immortals Zhong and Lü who came to deliver me. Now I have no affinity with them, and have missed them in person. The more I think, the more it seems so. Unable to restrain himself, he sighed aloud, “Alas! Alas!” Suddenly he recalled the parting words; the appointed time was not far off, only two threes — still to meet at the place of parting, beside the bridge to resolve myriad affinities. The “not far” must signify nearness. Two threes must be the third day of the third month. The place of parting and meeting: to know whence one comes, one must seek it where one goes. “To resolve myriad affinities” signifies that myriad laws all return to it. Thinking thus, his heart arose with joy. Time passed like an arrow; the sun and moon like a shuttle; in a moment, the late winter had passed, and the new spring returned.

Each year the aspect of the world is renewed; myriad plants contend to bloom in another spring.

The young children have all grown; behold, now they are white-headed men.

Meanwhile Wang the Worthy Youth passed the New Year; in a twinkling it became March. On the third day, he secretly left his house, and by the old road came to the bridge, waiting long. Not seeing them come, he pondered their appearance, his heart most sincere. Standing at the bridge’s head, looking east and west, suddenly from behind he heard a voice call out, “Why so early, Worthy Youth Wang?” Wang turned and saw the two poor fellows of the previous year. Hastening forward, he grasped their sleeves, saying, “Two great immortals, I did not expect to see you again.” Wuxin Chang and Jintong sat down at the bridge head. Wang the Worthy Youth knelt on both knees before them, saying, “Your disciple Wang Ji, with mortal eyes and earthly form, did not recognize your descent; much have I profaned you, and beg your pardon and pardon. To see your immortal countenances again is truly the fortune of three lives. I earnestly seek instruction to guide me from confusion to the path of awakening; your disciple’s gratitude is deep.” Having spoken, he bowed his head repeatedly. Then the two laughed heartily, their mouths emitting golden light dazzling to the eyes. In the twinkling of an eye, their forms changed: the one on the left had his hair tied in double buns, wore a loose robe; his face was like a dark jujube, his eyes like bright stars; a long beard hung to his chest, and a few goose-feather fans were in his hand. The one on the right wore a nine-beam kerchief, a yellow Taoist robe; his face was like the full moon, his gaze piercing; at his side hung a sword. Truly they were Patriarch Zhongli and Patriarch Lü Pure Yang. Wang the Worthy Youth bowed low, head down, not daring to raise his eyes.

Patriarch Lü said, “In antiquity men’s hearts were simple and honest, customs pure. Those who taught the Way first imparted magical arts to protect the body, and then transmitted the profound skill to perfect the true. In these times, the world is degenerate and men’s hearts no longer as before. If magical arts were taught first, they would only harm the body. Therefore the profound skill is first transmitted, without resorting to magic to bring peace to the body, without transformations the Way is achieved; once the Way is achieved, myriad laws are all accessible; without seeking magic arts, magic arts are naturally attained. This is called the teaching of Complete Truth.” Then he explained the wondrous principle of Complete Truth:

“The so-called Complete Truth is the meaning of pure truth without pretence. Who has not a true heart? But once it turns, it is no longer clear. Who has not true intention? Once it is mixed, it is lost. Are not man’s words without true feeling? Once partial, they are erroneous. The original heart is true; change and transformation are false hearts. The beginning intention is true; calculation and scheming are false intentions. The utmost feeling is true; perversity is false laziness. The so-called original heart is the innate heart; the so-called beginning intention is the first arising intention; the so-called utmost feeling is the feeling of one’s original nature. Within the heart there is true intention and true feeling; only in feeling is the true heart and true intention seen. From true heart arises true intention; from true intention arises true feeling. This feeling is the natural scene, ever the manifestation of Heaven’s mechanism. How then could man be untrue? Without true heart, there is no true intention; without true intention, no true feeling. I have seen those who cultivate the Way, and when moved their private thoughts arise in succession. Such private thoughts are where the heart is untrue. When still, desires follow one another; desire is where the heart is untrue. Private desires never cease; their arising may be wholly without true intention, or half true, half false. At the juncture of half true, half false, Heaven and man mutually act. Intention is such, and feeling cannot conceal it. To verify the true Way one must first verify true feeling; to verify true feeling is to know the heart true or not true, to know intention true or not true. Therefore the Way of cultivating truth must begin with intention. When intention is sincere, heart is also sincere; then the feeling arising from the heart is also sincere. Sincerity is truth. If sincerity is not true, it is seen in words, then words are not from the heart and are not true words. If seen in deeds, then deeds are not natural and not true deeds. The cultivator must remove the heart outside the heart, intention outside the intention, feeling outside the feeling. Whenever thought arises or words are spoken, one must raise the heavenly conscience, lay down the human heart, not allow the mind to be divided, nor the intention to be mixed. Only then is it a true heart, true intention, true feeling, without the least falsehood — that is the true Way. The true Way pervades all, hence it is called Complete Truth.”

When Patriarch Lü had finished explaining the principle of Complete Truth to Wang the Worthy Youth, he further instructed him in refining himself and establishing the foundation, in preparing the furnace and setting the cauldron, in gathering herbs, returning the elixir, the timing of fire, and in all other techniques. Wang the Worthy Youth bowed twice to receive this teaching. Patriarch Lü further said, “After you have attained the Way, hasten to Shandong to save the Seven Truths. The Seven Truths are the masters of the seven golden lotuses I spoke of before.” Having given these last injunctions, he and Patriarch Zhong then sprang up, their bodies emitting golden light everywhere, and in a flash vanished from sight. Wang the Worthy Youth looked up and bowed in thanks; after bowing he still gazed into the empty air, silently recalling their immortal forms. Just then Wang Maotong and Yuwa came, saying, “By order of Lady Zhou, we came to seek the master. Suspecting he was here, we have now found him and ask that he return home so as not to cause anxiety.” Wang the Worthy Youth then slowly took his way, silently recalling the Way Patriarch Lü had taught him. Upon returning home, he did not enter the inner chamber, but went to the study and sat down. Lady Zhou, hearing her husband was home, came to inquire; seeing him silent and thoughtful, she urged him, “My lord has repeatedly risked his health by going out, often making me anxious; I fear his conduct may bring shame and laughter among the townsfolk. Yet my lord does not heed my words; what is to be done?” Wang the Worthy Youth was deep in thought upon the profound skill, and did not notice Lady Zhou’s coming, nor what she said. Only at last he heard Lady Zhou say, “What is to be done?” and not knowing what to say, answered casually, “How can there be any ‘to be done’ or ‘not to be done’?” Lady Zhou, seeing his words were unreasonable, ceased speaking and withdrew.

Wang the Worthy Youth thought to himself: with such disturbances, how can success be achieved, how can the Way be attained? Unless some method is devised to sever worldly ties, there can be no emancipation in this life. Bowing his head in thought, he conceived a way: unless he feigned a stroke and silence, he could not cut off these entanglements. Having resolved this, he feigned a state of stupor and dullness. When anyone came, he made groaning sounds, but would not return to the inner chamber. He lay down upon the cool couch in the study. Lady Zhou, seeing this, was full of worry and came many times each day to ask. She saw him muttering within the day, speaking incoherently, groaning and calling out, shaking his head incessantly.

Lady Zhou was at her wit’s end and sent Yuwa to bring several of Wang the Worthy Youth’s usual acquaintances to accompany him in idle talk, to see what was amiss. These friends were all men whom Wang the Worthy Youth respected and loved; when invited, they came immediately. They entered the study together and all asked in unison, “Worthy Youth Wang, are you well?” Wang the Worthy Youth shook his head several times, gestured with his hands, and muttered incoherently, only sighing deeply. Seeing he could not speak, only groaned, they wondered what illness he had that he did not even know. An elder among them said, “I observe that Worthy Youth Wang’s condition resembles stroke with speechlessness. I do not know if this is so or not. There is a doctor named Zhang Haiqing in the east end of our village; a wise physician. Let us fetch him to examine the pulse, and we shall know for certain.” Lady Zhou, hearing this at the door, ordered Yuwa to invite the doctor. Soon the doctor was brought in. The friends all rose to let him enter and seat himself. They explained Wang the Worthy Youth’s symptoms and condition. Zhang Haiqing then took Wang’s pulse with both hands. Having examined, he found no sign of illness, but followed the common talk, saying, “Truly this is a stroke with speechlessness. Take these medicines and you will surely recover.” Having spoken, he wrote out a prescription for some medicines. Whether the doctor’s cure would be good or not, shall be told in the next chapter.

Because the martial art is in truth no illness, it is not that the doctor’s skill is poor.
