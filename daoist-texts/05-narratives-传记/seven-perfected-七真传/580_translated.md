# Chapter Twelve: Clarifying the Subtle Principle by Sitting in Meditation — Joyous to Meet a Teacher of the True Way

Love and affection, once entangled, cannot be untied; when the body departs at last, they do not follow together.

Now I let go my hold without clinging or hindrance, and rise straight to the Jade Pool by the steps of jade.

It is said that the boy of the western village was about to relate to his mother the words of Master Chongyang on the hand method, when suddenly five or six men appeared at the gate, asking the way to Majiazhuang. The boy said, ‘You seek Majiazhuang? Do you indeed intend to meet the living immortal?’ They answered, ‘That is so.’ The boy, hearing that they wished to meet the living immortal, was exceedingly glad, and said to them, ‘It is not far; I will lead you there.’ So saying, he went forward; the men followed him and left the western village. Soon they arrived at Majiazhuang.

By good fortune, Master Ma Yuanwai was sitting before the hall; seeing them enter, he rose and welcomed them inside to sit down, and inquired of the company the purpose of their coming to his humble village. They said they had come to seek the Way. Ma Danyang, hearing this, led them to the thatched hermitage to pay respects to the Master. Among them was a man surnamed Tan, called Chuduan, styled Changzhenzi. In former years he had been afflicted with a chronic illness; when Wang Chongyang first came to Shandong, he had imparted to him the art of curing disease. His illness was cured, and with a single heart he sought the Way, visiting masters everywhere but to no avail. Now hearing that at Majiazhuang there was a living immortal called Wang Chongyang, he knew the Master was there. Also he had invited a man fond of the Way, surnamed Hao, named Datong, styled Taigu, a native of Wendeng County in this Prefecture. The others also were men who loved the Way; their names it is unnecessary to record.

Presently Tan Changzhen, having thanked the Master for the cure in former years, began to speak of his present intent to study the Way. Master Chongyang said, ‘The gate of the Law is wide open; those who go, go; those who come, come; those who go, are not detained; those who come, are not refused.’ He then ordered Ma Danyang to lead them to the second thatched hermitage to take up their quarters. After a few days, two more practitioners arrived; one surnamed Liu, called Chuxuan, styled Changshengzi; the other surnamed Wang, called Chuyi, styled Yuyangzi; both natives of Shandong. Ma Danyang received them and inquired their purpose. They also came seeking the Way, and he led them to the thatched hermitage to pay respects to the Master. Master Chongyang ordered Ma Danyang to lodge them in the third thatched hermitage. Thus one came from the east, another from the west; in less than a month dozens had arrived. Master Chongyang bade Ma Danyang arrange among them officers to each take charge of a sect, all according to rules and regulations, forbidding overstepping; with all matters settled, Master Chongyang discoursed upon the practice of sitting meditation. The disciples divided into two classes, arranged in order; bowing, they listened to the teaching.

Master Chongyang said: ‘The human body is based on qi; the heart is the root; the nature is the curtain. Heaven and earth are distant eighty-four thousand li; the human heart and kidney are distant eight cun and four fen. The kidney here is the inner kidney, three cun and three fen below the navel. The channel connects to link the breath. The floating and sinking breaths comprise all the hundred vessels; one exhalation opens all the hundred vessels; one inhalation closes all the hundred vessels. The operation of heaven and earth’s transformation and circulation is not beyond the two words, inhalation and exhalation. Human breathing lies between heart and kidney; thus blood and qi follow their course, original qi becomes firm, the seven emotions do not run wild, a hundred diseases require no treatment and vanish of themselves. The method of sitting meditation is: at the hours of zi, wu, mao, and you, in a quiet chamber, spread thick matting; sitting cross-legged thereupon, with eyes slightly fixed upon the navel, ears stopped with cotton, heart free from thought and care, mind following the breath, one going and coming, up and down following the breath, neither slow nor fast, letting it be natural. Sit through the burning of one incense stick, feeling the breath at mouth and nose no longer coarse, gradually soft and fine. Then one stick’s time more, feeling the breath at mouth and nose as if it were and yet not, then slowly stretch the legs and open the eyes, remove the ear plugs, rise and walk a few steps, then lie upon one side for a while, rise again, and take half a bowl of gruel; but do not make this a feast, and take care not to anger, for that would injure the work and harm the true qi.’

The work of sitting meditation does not lie in length of time; it depends entirely upon dispelling demon qi and banishing devils.

First remove all obstacles together; let not the mind be caught in a net.

If the obstacles remain, vexations will gather; if the net is not untied, how can one escape from the world of sorrow?

Clearly the highest principle is thus imparted; take heed not to follow old ways and bring on your own ruin.

After Master Chongyang discoursed on the work of life cultivation, he rose to rest. The disciples all returned to their chambers; we pass over what followed. It is recorded that in Dou Village, Qixia County, Dengzhou Prefecture, Shandong, there was a man surnamed Qiu, called Chuji, styled Qifa. He had three brothers, the eldest named Qiming, the next Qisao. His parents died early; Qiu Qifa was much cared for by his brothers and sister-in-law, so that he grew to manhood. He had read for several years and could compose poetry and songs, but had no interest in fame or rank; he loved quietness, often sitting alone all day, speaking little, as if he had found a secret meaning, beyond which none might enter. His brother and sister-in-law often urged him to seek fame by study; he replied that reading was for the investigation of principle, not for the pursuit of rank. When they wished to marry him, he firmly declined, saying a man who had not established himself might not be bound by marriage. Hearing his extraordinary words, they dared not press him, and left him at his own will. Qiu Qifa once said to others, ‘Life in the world is bitter; one should seek a way out. People spend their days striving for fame and gain, coveting wife and child, but when the hour of change comes, all things are empty. People think worldly affairs are true; but to me they are as floating clouds, morning dew, dreams, and illusions.’

One day he heard men say that in Majiazhuang, Ninghai County, there was a Master Wang Chongyang, widely virtuous, a great practitioner; that several from Qixia County were also there studying the Way. Qiu Qifa, who all his life loved the Way, hearing this, resolved to go and study. Without explaining to his brother and sister-in-law, fearing they would forbid him, he secretly packed a little money, took a few changes of clothes, and left home silently, setting his face towards Ninghai County.

In less than a day he arrived at Majiazhuang. That day Ma Danyang was on duty. When he inquired the purpose of Qiu’s coming, and recorded his name in the register, he found that Tan, Liu, Wang, Hao, and others had all come to inquire; all were glad, saying, ‘Such a youth, if he can sincerely seek the Way, is rare indeed.’ Saying this, he led him to the thatched hermitage to pay respects to Master Chongyang. Ma Danyang then told the Master of Qiu’s intent to study the Way. The Master looked at him and shook his head, saying, ‘This man has too many thoughts, is too clever; he cannot learn the Way; let him go back soon, lest he deceive himself.’ Qiu Qifa knelt and said, ‘I earnestly seek the Way, without any other intention; I beg the Master to receive me.’ Ma Danyang also pleaded for him, but the Master would not consent. He said, ‘It is not that I do not accept him; this man has a heavy root of suffering; I fear he will not endure the trials to come, and will surely repent; better not to receive him.’ Qiu Qifa again wished to entreat, but Master Chongyang went out of the hermitage to view the flowers. Ma Danyang and the others were at a loss, and had to lead Qiu to the hall to lodge, setting him to clean the hall; secretly they taught him some meditation methods.

One day Qiu said to Ma Danyang, ‘Since the old Master will not receive me, why may I not take you for my teacher?’ Ma Danyang said, ‘No, no! One must seek a great man; to take a teacher one must take a clear teacher. I only know a little of the preliminary work. As to the great Way, I have not heard of it. Stay quietly, and I will deal with you little by little.’ Hearing this, Qiu was much pleased, attentive morning and evening, ready to obey every order, calling out when there was a need. After a few days, he was familiar with everyone, and all liked him. One day, following the elder brothers to the thatched hermitage, he saw Master Chongyang sitting in the midst, disciples standing on either side respectfully listening to the discourse.

Master Chongyang said, ‘Since my coming here, I have patiently endured the world, bitterly spoken to transform men, intending to make all return to the path of awakening, everywhere leading out of the labyrinth of error. I am also a man; born loving the Way; in youth foolish and dull; in manhood strange; in strength communicating with spirits. The strange men of the world all call me different! How could I be different? I am but dull, common, and foolish! What difference have I? Not proud, not jealous, not scheming, not fanciful — dull indeed! Not knowing calculation and thought, not skilful or clumsy — foolish indeed! Not speaking strangely, not falling into dust and worldliness — common indeed! The world calls me dull, laughs at my foolishness, censures my commonness; I turn and pity the world’s utmost dullness, folly, and commonness, unaware of awakening. I use the Way of utmost dullness, folly, and commonness to awaken the world. If you cannot understand, then you do not understand. Therefore those who cultivate the Way must begin with refining the heart; and refining before arising is especially precious, refining after arising is also precious. The wandering heart, the mind that lets go of all miscellaneous thoughts, are hearts already arisen. To make them quiet and unmoving, one must surely guard the heart, fix the heart, and collect the heart. To lose guard of the heart is to guard it before motion; to fix the heart is to fix it when it must move; to collect the heart is to collect it when it has moved. To collect is not easy; first one must follow arising and collect at once; the swifter the collection, the firmer the guard; the firmer the guard, the longer the fixation; this is the subtlety of my Way’s method of heart cultivation! One must make this heart empty and without a single thing. The heart is formed from the true yang of the primordial qi; hence the heart belongs to fire, not pure yang without yin. Within yang is true yin; hence the little form has three numbers covering above, below a crescent carrying above. It is evident that yang cannot grow without yin, yin cannot be born without yang; true yin comes from true yang; hence the name heart. Therefore when a thought moves, the heart loses a portion of true qi. When one thing enters the heart, a demon obstruction is added. Hence when the heart moves, it is no longer called small name, but is called “thought.” The character for thought shows that man has two hearts. Man has two hearts, and cannot be single-minded; hence no undertaking is accomplished, and still less the Way.’

Master Chongyang said, ‘The heart is the master of the one body; it is one and not two; if two hearts arise, that is called thought! At this beginning, many vain and false things arise, and the heart cannot be master, so the body falls into sinking and submersion. Alas! Hard to extricate and cross over!’ While thus discoursing, Qiu Qifa listened joyfully among the crowd, repeatedly exclaiming, ‘Wonderful!’ The Master cast an angry glance at him and ceased speaking. The disciples came out and blamed him for causing the Master to stop teaching. Qiu feigned ignorance and let them complain; secretly he pondered the Master’s words on refining the heart, which were the secret of the Way! To cultivate the Way is to first refine the heart; without this, even the wondrous Way cannot be accomplished. So each day he examined his heart, seeing if there were faults or no faults, errors or no errors. Whenever he found the elder brothers absent from the front hall, he would be behind listening to the Master’s teaching, though not knowing what he heard. Let us listen further to the explanation.

All under heaven originally has no difficult matter; only to be feared are those who have heart in the world.
