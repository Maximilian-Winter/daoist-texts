# Chapter Fifteen: Showing Master Yuhua His Retirement, Escorting the Spirit-Bier—Disciple's Toil

Where the banner moves, the breeze is not truly there;  
The original nature, round and bright, is the dharmakāya.  
Comprehending the meaning in plucking a flower and smiling,  
Thereafter no place to lay a speck of dust.

It is told that Master Chongyang, seeing those who studied the Way still gathered together, observed that among them none had true sincerity towards the Way, but only clung to empty fame, pointing to the Dao as excuse, desiring that men know they cultivated and comprehended the Way, yet truly had not a single thought of the Dao; it was hard to disperse them. Men confuse the false with the true, so that the dharma-gate cannot remain pure and tranquil. He thought out a subtle method, nodded once, then suddenly shouted several times, "Not good! Not good!" Alarmed, those people hurried to attend him. The Master said, “I should not have gone abroad; on the road I suffered the heat and damp, causing my heart to congeal, and blisters to arise upon my body.” He loosened his garment for all to see, and indeed there was swelling on his heart, his whole body covered with blisters. Alarmed, Ma Danyang and Qiu, Liu, and others hurried to seek physicians and remedies, summoning several famed doctors in succession, using many wondrous medicines, yet no cure was effected. After two days more, the blisters all broke and rotted, pus flowed and mingled, the stench was unbearable. Those who studied the Way in secret spoke among themselves: “Master Chongyang surely has no Way; he cannot maintain himself, how can he save others? If he cannot cure his own sickness, how can he become an immortal? Let us each return to our homes, lest we delay great matters.” Thus one departed in secret, another openly; within two days they had all gone clean away, leaving only Qiu, Liu, Tan, Ma, Hao, and Wang—six in all—attending him day and night.

When the Master saw all had departed, he called these six near and instructed, saying: “I shall surely die tomorrow at noon; but since my coming here, the sum left by Ma Yu of silver money, I have used it to relieve the poor and to assist others in burial and marriage, and to send off servant girls and handmaidens, fulfilling all the bridal gifts for my family and household, expending a considerable sum of silver. Also there are those who come to study the Way, whom I have supported for one or two years; thus the silver is all spent. Now the treasury is empty. After my death, if funeral arrangements need to be made, there must be fields sold and land alienated; but according to my instructions, no money is to be spent. When I die, there must be no wailing or weeping; no rites of mourning or lamentation. Only a few thin boards to hold this foul skin-bag are needed. Let Qiu, Liu, Wang, Tan, and Hao take turns bearing my coffin back to under Zhongnan in Shaanxi; where the ropes break there shall be my burial place. This must not be mistaken. If my words are disobeyed, I shall not rest in peace.” Hearing the Master’s words, Qiu, Liu, and the others wept aloud. Master Chongyang said, “Do not act thus as children!” Though so instructed, Qiu and Liu could not but be full of sorrow and sadness.

At the next day’s noon, the Master, dressed in order, sat upright on his mat, and called the six near to speak: “The method of cultivating both nature and life requires both inner and outer; lacking outer work, virtue and nature are incomplete; lacking inner work, the original source is not clear. What is outer work? It is the mind in daily life, requiring that it be without fault, every word must be cautious—words are work; every deed must be careful—deeds are work; no matter one matter is neglected or one person lax, all these are accumulations and promotions of work. And what is inner work? To keep clear and not fall into confusion; to guard the mind as one guards a fortress; to be empty, attaching to nothing; to guard the heart more strictly than the body. There come times when Heaven and Man meet but by a hair’s breadth; Heaven and Man are then at war. I now speak chiefly of inner work. Inner work cannot be seen by form, nor sought by sight; it cannot be trusted to chance, nor allowed carelessness. To sweep away one iota of form is to have one iota of yang in mastery; to sweep away boundless form is to have boundless yang arise. To sweep away the toxins of form, leaving no residue or slightest stain, is to have a pure yang body. There are those who cultivate the Way, not lacking faith or firmness, but their fault lies in haste to succeed; their skill is insufficient, yet they think to attain the fruit. Again, there are hundreds who practice my Way, not without care and turning over (their thoughts), but their fault lies in leisure; day after day they drag themselves, half-asleep; at every moment they are sullen and unhappy; their spirits flag; they find the practice hard to carry through; they are unwilling to apply effort. Do they not know that to master one skill, to exhaust infinite contrivances of mind, so as to work with ease and at will, to handle half a thread and half a fibre, to spend much strength, is the way to be content and satisfied? Is it not necessary for those who would learn to become true immortals to undergo hard work?”

When Master Chongyang had finished speaking, he took up a book named “The Collection of Concealed Light,” which he had himself written, containing the Way of Hidden Traces and the marvels of retirement, and entrusted it to Ma Danyang, saying: “You six must explore therein the highest principles; to know is not difficult, but to practice is difficult; you must exert yourselves to practice and not fail my heart. Your disciple Daoyou’s fruit is nearly mature; do not tarry in thought. Only Qiu Changchun’s merit and practice are still scant; you must instruct him a little. Liu Changsheng’s form has not yet been fully emptied; he yet rides another wave. Hao Taigu wanders east and west; the places he sees are the places to attain the Way. Tan Changzhen meets Gu and penetrates the Mystic. Wang Yuyang meets Yao and enters the Marvelous. Qiu Changchun, near Shifan Creek, has exhausted bitter roots; on the Gate of Dragon Flight he shall perfect the Great Elixir.” When Master Chongyang had spoken thus, he smiled and passed away.

Qiu, Liu, and the others carefully followed the Master’s last instructions, making no noise; they prepared the coffin according to law, binding it fast with cords, seeking a carrying pole and two crossbars. Early the next morning, Qiu, Wang, Tan, and Hao lifted the spirit bier and set out; Liu Changsheng, bearing luggage, followed behind. Ma Danyang sent them more than twenty li on the way; at parting he took out a packet of loose silver, some forty or fifty taels, and handed it to Liu Changsheng, saying: “The silver at home has all been spent by Master’s good works; I could not prepare more at once. Here is some loose silver for incidental expenses; it will suffice for a few meagre needs on the road. After the burial, quickly return; our elder brothers and Way-friends all cultivate in one place.” Liu Changsheng took the silver and parted from Danyang. After not many li, they saw many people bearing incense and paper offerings to block the road and pay respects. Liu Changsheng came near and looked, and all were those false cultivators of the Way who had studied under the Master. Liu Changsheng gave thanks, but the Master, while yet alive, could not suffer false cultivators; now having passed to immortality, his true spirit was unclouded; seeing them, he still manifested his displeasure, sending forth from the coffin a foul stench, so that all held their noses and were sickened, unable to stand, they clumsily kowtowed a few times and all departed; then the foulness ceased.

Qiu Changchun and Hao Taigu and others bore the coffin westward; after no more than ten li, someone stopped them with provisions. Qiu, Liu, and the others thought this was of one who had known the Master and now, hearing of his passing, came to offer a meal in kindness; so it was not strange. They hurriedly set down the coffin and ate; after finishing, they gave thanks and lifted it up to continue. After a short time, they saw by the roadside an ancient temple and could carry no further; they set down the coffin and rested in the temple. At dawn they lifted it again and reached the time for morning meal; again someone stopped with food. At midday also, the same; toward evening they found a cold temple to lodge in. Thus for more than a month they proceeded; upon reaching the border of Shaanxi, Qiu Changchun thought within himself: “This matter is indeed strange! How in Heaven and Earth could there be such coincidence? Nearby, men thought those who stopped were acquaintances of the Master, and gave freely; but farther on, still others stopped with food; this matter is truly extraordinary.” While he mused thus at noon, suddenly one came with food to invite them to eat. Liu, Hao, Wang, and Tan gave thanks, took bowls and chopsticks and ate. Qiu Changchun drew the food-bearer aside and asked: “How did you know we had come here, and why bring us food? For what reason?” The food-bearer said: “Since dawn an old Taoist in yellow robes has been in our village, spreading the tale that five disciples bear a coffin from Shandong, requesting to refresh host and guest with a meal. My master is most kind-hearted and hearing this, sent me to bring food to this place.”

Changchun heard and noted this in his heart. The next morning at meal time, feigning stomach pain, he went on ahead to the village to ask for a bowl of broth. He asked Liu Changsheng to help bear one shoulder; Changsheng agreed, receiving the luggage from him and taking up the carrying pole. Qiu Changchun bore his luggage on his back and strode forward several li, and indeed saw an elder in yellow Taoist robes, resembling the Master, going into the village. Qiu Changchun hastened and ran forward, seizing the Taoist robe with one hand, and knelt down, saying aloud: “Master, please walk slowly; your disciple serves here.” Master Chongyang turned and, face full of anger, rebuked Changchun: “You wicked disciple, ignorant of Heaven and Earth’s waxing and waning, and the Way of Hidden Traces, you blindly strive to show cleverness, leaking the secrets of immortality. For this you shall need three more years of demon refining—this is your own fault!” Having spoken, he vanished like a clear wind. Changchun repented deeply. Then the spirit bearers came; he hastened to take up the burden again, giving the luggage back to Changsheng. From then on no one sent food; but for the loose silver sent by Ma Danyang, they would surely have suffered hunger.

Half a month later they arrived at Zhongnan; the ropes all broke, and the coffin fell to the ground. Changchun looked and saw an old man standing outside the village before them; he went to pay respects. Before he could speak, the old man asked: “Are you those who bear a coffin from Shandong?” Qiu Changchun replied: “Indeed so. Sir, how do you know?” The old man said: “Last night I dreamed that Wang Xiaolian said he was dead, and that five disciples bore his coffin from Shandong here, asking me to give a burial place to inter him. I thought of old times with him at the provincial capital examinations; we were intimate friends, and so I consented. I asked when the burial would be; he said at noon today. I awoke, half-believing and half-doubting, and came out to look several times, only to see you bearing the coffin, now resting on this old man’s land.” Changchun pointed to where the rope had broken and the burial was to be, telling the old man all. The old man was greatly pleased, went in and called out several village men, each bringing mattocks, hoes, and baskets; they came before the coffin, moved it aside, then dug a grave and buried the Master. In a short time they made a large mound.

Qiu, Liu, and the others bowed in thanks to the old man, and gave thanks to the villagers. The old man then invited the elder brothers and friends to the village, entertaining them with a vegetarian meal. Afterward Qiu, Liu, and the others bade farewell to the old man, inquired the way to Dawei village, and all bowed as they departed. What befell them thereafter shall be told in the next chapter.

To seek the Way eastward, the true Way perfected;  
To escort the Master westward, the great matter accomplished.
