# Chapter Twenty-Six: Praying for Rain to Turn Heaven and Change the Sun; Employing Marvelous Arts to Exchange Phoenix and Steal Dragon

A piece of utmost sincerity may move Heaven,  
Turning a year of calamity into one of plenty.

Speak not lightly of the Sovereign’s earnest love for his people;  
It is truly the wondrous mystery of the Perfected One’s Way.

It is related that the Yuan Shundi issued an imperial proclamation, calling forth those of pure and lofty Taoist conduct to pray for rain. The Prefect of Longzhou submitted a memorial to the capital, saying: ‘There is in Longmen of Longzhou a recluse named Qiu Changchun, whose virtue is pure and exalted. Last year the region suffered drought, yet by this man’s power sweet dew was prayed down, saving the people universally. Now the Emperor desires to seek rain to relieve the people’s distress; none but this man will do. I, mindful of saving the people, therefore report thus.’ When Yuan Shundi read the memorial, his dragon-heart was greatly pleased; he immediately commanded the Grand Master Halitutu to visit Changchun. In a few days he arrived at Longmen, presenting jade and silk, and declared the Sovereign’s intent. Changchun joyfully accepted the summons, and accompanied the Grand Master to the capital. On the morrow he had audience with the Sovereign, who honoured him with the ceremony due to a master, gave him a seat above the Nine Ministers, and entrusted him with the matter of praying for rain.

Changchun reported: ‘Your Majesty, in your deep concern for the people, how dare I withhold my humble effort? Yet it is necessary to set up two altars with great solemnity. When Your Majesty personally lights incense and worships, then will I address the Supreme Deity, and within three days there shall be rain.’ The Emperor was greatly delighted, and commanded the officials to manage the affair, sending eunuchs to escort Changchun to lodge at the Jixian Pavilion. On the next day’s early court, officials reported the rain altar was prepared, and the Master Duanhou mounted the altar. The Sovereign then proclaimed that Changchun join him there. The Son of Heaven reverently burned incense and worshipped; when the rites were done, the imperial carriage returned to the palace. Changchun bowed upon the rain altar and prayed fervently. At the third day’s noon hour, the red sun stood in the heavens like a burning wheel, scorching the earth and raising dust; all were bathed in sweat. Changchun took a willow branch, sprinkled pure water towards the red sun. Soon a streak of dark vapour appeared by the sun’s edge, swiftly changing to clouds that covered the sun; in a moment the sky darkened, and rain poured down like a torrent. It continued for days, turning drought to abundance, decay to renewal; the people rejoiced, creatures great and small all benefited. Yuan Shundi’s dragon-heart was overjoyed, and he ennobled Changchun as the Hongdao Perfected One, retaining him in the capital with the honours due to a foremost guest.

One day the Yuan Earth Perfected One entered the inner court and strolled to the imperial gardens. Within the garden were evergreen grasses and never-fading flowers, strange stones and curious trees, beyond naming. The Sovereign and the Perfected One sat upon a living stone, discoursing on the Way and profound mysteries, while five-coloured auspicious clouds hung above like a splendid canopy.

Speaking to the subtle essence of things, the Sovereign sighed: ‘Were I not to inherit the great succession, I would follow Chisongzi and, when I have a heir, bow to the Perfected One as teacher and enter the mountains to cultivate.’ Qiu the Perfected One said: ‘Your Majesty, do not worry; the Empress already carries the dragon embryo, soon to give birth to the heir apparent.’ The Sovereign privately thought, ‘The Perfected One is indeed a transcendent being.’ Knowing the Empress was with child, he asked casually, ‘The Empress indeed is with child, but is it a boy or a girl?’ Qiu answered: ‘I have calculated it to be a boy, without doubt.’ The Emperor said: ‘If as you say, it is my good fortune.’ The Perfected One withdrew. Yuan Shundi returned to the palace and told the Empress: ‘Qiu the Perfected One has calculated that your womb bears a dragon embryo; whether this is true I know not.’ The Empress said: ‘How could he be so accurate? Why not summon the National Master to the hall to calculate along with the Perfected One? If their words agree, then it is certain.’ The Sovereign greatly rejoiced, and next day summoned Baiyun Chan Master from Baiyun Temple; he came to the hall to calculate with Qiu the Perfected One whether the Empress’s pregnancy was male or female.

Baiyun Chan Master counted on his fingers and said: ‘According to my calculation, the lady Empress carries a phoenix embryo, surely to be born a princess.’ The Sovereign again asked Qiu the Perfected One, who replied: ‘Yesterday I explained clearly to Your Majesty, the Empress carries a dragon embryo, surely to bear the heir apparent. Why ask again?’ Baiyun Chan Master laughed: ‘Since you are versed in the mysteries, you surely know the principles of numbers; count again.’ Qiu said: ‘Whether counted or not, it remains a dragon embryo, surely a boy.’ The Chan Master was angry: ‘My calculations leave nothing out; how dare you speak recklessly and disturb the sacred virtue!’ Qiu answered: ‘Numerical calculations are not equal to heavenly principles. The power of secret virtue can turn Heaven; good deeds have the merit to alter fate. Now the Sovereign himself prays for rain to save the people universally; the insects, plants, all share the blessing. This is great secret virtue; perchance it moves Heaven to change female into male, to transform phoenix into dragon — this is not impossible.’ The Chan Master said: ‘I regard you as a man of the Way, but you are still ordinary. Pregnancy precedes the prayer for rain; how can the foetus change after formation?’ Qiu said: ‘I have already determined it; why argue further!’ The Chan Master said: ‘Do you dare to bet with me?’ Qiu said: ‘A bet then, why should I fear?’ The Chan Master said: ‘If it is a dragon embryo, I will hand Baiyun Temple over to you.’ Qiu said: ‘If it is a phoenix embryo, I willingly offer my head to you.’ The Chan Master laughed: ‘Do not regret it afterwards.’ Qiu said: ‘A word is final; why regret?’ The Chan Master said: ‘Words alone are not proof; write it down as witness.’

Qiu the Perfected One then sought paper and brush before the imperial desk and wrote: ‘I, Qiu Changchun, wager my head with Baiyun Chan Master, that if the Empress bears a phoenix, I lose and will readily surrender my head without complaint.’ Baiyun Chan Master likewise wrote: ‘I, Baiyun Monk of Baiyun Temple, wager with Qiu Changchun, that if the Empress bears a dragon, I lose and will surrender Baiyun Temple to Qiu Changchun without complaint.’ Having written, they sealed their documents and exchanged them; each read aloud, then presented them to the imperial desk. Yuan Shundi’s dragon eyes perused them and personally preserved them, awaiting the Empress’s delivery to know the truth. The day’s court dismissed and all returned to their places.

Meanwhile, Baiyun Chan Master returned to Baiyun Temple, pondering Qiu Changchun’s boldness. Could it be that the Empress indeed bears a dragon embryo, and that I have erred in calculation? Unease troubled him; he recalculated but found no error. Secretly he rejoiced and muttered: ‘Qiu Changchun, you cannot blame me; this is your own disaster, losing your life despite your cultivation.’ Qiu the Perfected One returned to the Jixian Pavilion, and upon determining the Empress’s childbirth time, he prepared a talisman. He borrowed from the Nine Heavens’ Maiden Palace a divine maiden named Yuzhen Fairy, of wondrous transformations and great power, who came by the command of the Nine Heavens’ Holy Mother to obey Qiu’s orders. Qiu respectfully said: ‘At the hour of the Ox tonight, at the Prince’s mansion, the princess will give birth. You may transform the gourd into a baby girl, exchange her for the boy, and hold him in the Golden Throne Hall. After I have exchanged the phoenix, you shall return the phoenix for the gourd.’ The fairy took her orders and went to perform them.

That night at the hour of the Rat, the Empress gave birth to a girl, fulfilling Baiyun Chan Master’s prediction of a phoenix embryo. The officials reported this to Yuan Shundi, who greatly admired the Chan Master’s accurate calculation, yet feared for the Perfected One’s life and resolved to save it, as befits a sovereign. An early court was called, and all officials knowing the Empress had borne a princess came to congratulate. Baiyun Chan Master also came, felicitating and saying: ‘I have heard the Empress has borne the heir apparent, continuing the sacred line; I rejoice heartily and pray for the Emperor’s long life and the Crown Prince’s eternal reign.’ Yuan Shundi sighed: ‘My fate is to lack a successor, but this is no cause for regret. Yet Qiu the Perfected One miscalculated the yin and yang, and must lose his wager. Yet I consider his prayers for rain, and wish to save him; I will donate 100,000 in imperial funds to compensate Baiyun Temple, and redeem the head of the Perfected One.’ Having spoken, Baiyun Chan Master was still in thought when a eunuch reported Qiu the Perfected One had come for court. The Emperor ordered him in, and after obeisance, Qiu congratulated the Sovereign: ‘The Empress has borne the dragon heir; I come to felicitate Your Majesty.’ The Emperor said: ‘You are mistaken; the Empress bore a girl.’ Qiu said: ‘My calculation is infallible; if it is a girl, I ask to see the child and will gladly die.’

The Emperor wished to protect him, but seeing his obstinacy was displeased, and called in palace maids to bring out the baby. It was now the hour between Yin and Mao. The fairy had transformed the gourd into a baby girl, exchanging her for the boy, concealing divine radiance, waiting in the Golden Throne Hall. The palace maid carried out the girl and presented her before the Emperor. Yuan Shundi handed the child to the Perfected One, who covered it with his sleeve. The fairy had already swapped dragon for phoenix, exchanging a boy for the girl, and taken him to the Prince’s mansion. The officials, all mortal-eyed, could not perceive this; Baiyun Chan Master had some wisdom but no divine power, and could not know. Presently Qiu the Perfected One held the boy in his hands and invited all officials to look; whether boy or girl, the officials saw and proclaimed ‘Long live the Crown Prince!’ This made Baiyun Chan Master’s face pale; he rushed forward, took the child in his arms, and saw clearly it was a boy, not a girl. His face flushed red; he too congratulated the Sovereign: ‘Indeed the heir apparent is the dragon.’ Having spoken, he presented the boy. The Emperor, seeing this strange matter, immediately changed his words: ‘I heard the palace report of a girl and had not seen the child myself; this was a palace mistake.’ He ordered the Ministry of Works to hold a feast for three days and proclaimed amnesty throughout the land. The Emperor retired from court, and the civil and military officials dispersed. Qiu the Perfected One asked Baiyun Chan Master: ‘What did you command?’ The Chan Master said: ‘A word once spoken cannot be recalled. I will hand over the temple to you tomorrow; you move in, I move out; all is settled. What else is there to command?’ They each returned to their temple.

Qiu the Perfected One returned to his pavilion; the fairy came to return the gourd and ascended to the Nine Heavens. Baiyun Chan Master returned to Baiyun Temple, dissatisfied, recalculated again and again but found nothing; ‘One move ahead is hard to overcome. A weaker skill held back by three parts is always destined to fall.’ He sighed in regret. A servant beside the Chan Master said: ‘Qiu Changchun is alone; how can he occupy so large a temple? We must have one for one, exchanging one to offset another; if we cannot finish, we shall continue to reside here and slowly work out the matter.’ The Chan Master was glad at this; on the next day when Qiu the Perfected One came, the Chan Master said: ‘Many monks, spacious temple, numerous people. You come once, I go once; one for one, one for one; if we cannot finish, we cannot leave; the monks stay, the Tao stays.’ Qiu said: ‘Excellent! This is the way.’ He went out the mountain gate, took a dust whisk from his sleeve, plucked some brown hairs from it, and scattered them into the air. What happened then? Let it be told in the next chapter.

Speak not of my present scanty strength; know that about me mysteries abound.
