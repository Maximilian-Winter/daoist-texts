# Chapter Twenty-Seven: Exhortations to the Assembly of the Way and Layered Discussions on Cultivation

The flowers fall and bloom once more in a year, how often does man behold the moon in full?

To open the locks of fame and gain is to blaze like a fierce fire, well suited to sow the lotus.

It is said that Master Qiu the Perfected One went forth from the mountain gate, and from within his sleeve took out his whisk. In secret he plucked some of the brown hairs from the whisk, breathed out his vital breath, and cast them into the air; they were scattered by the wind, and none knew where they fell. Suddenly innumerable disciples of the Way arrived, following Master Qiu within, and replaced all the monks in the temple. Master Baiyun the Chan-shih took up residence in the Hall of Gathering Virtue where Master Qiu dwelt; the monks were dispersed among various temples for lodging. You ask why Master Qiu was so resolute in taking Baiyun Temple? Because the region of the capital, Beijing, was then in a flourishing state of royal vitality; such a place as this, a city of men, was sought to be the site for opening a platform and expounding the teaching. Moreover, Master Baiyun the Chan-shih should arise in the southern regions and open up the teaching over the three rivers area; but if he remained guarding Baiyun Temple in the capital, it would be difficult for him to develop his work. Therefore this temple was seized, that he might more easily go south to universally save all beings. Thus in heaven and earth, each Perfected One has his place; what benefits one may harm another, what benefits another may harm one. The superior cultivator of truth must choose to dwell where the mutual generation and correspondence is, and avoid places of mutual overcoming and injury; this is called obtaining the advantage of locality.

Meanwhile, Master Qiu gathered together his fellow Wayfarers at Baiyun Temple; within less than a month, scores of disciples arrived. In attending to affairs, each sect had its duties and offices, and the place became lively at once. Master Qiu seeing that among the disciples were both wise and foolish, deemed it necessary to instruct them.

Master Qiu said to the assembly: 'The so-called leaving the home life is to quit dust and renounce the world! One must first have a determination to see through the dust and worldliness, and a heart to retire in search of the Way; then only can it be called a true hearted leaving of home life! If one, in a moment of vain hope to become an immortal, or from anger, or for the sake of peace and leisure, leaves the home life, this is but taking the Way as a pretext, while in fact arranging a resting place for the body. Hence a fierce and brave mind springs up, but a long enduring mind is hard to obtain; the Way becomes optional, and thus one loses the profound mystery in the end. There are also those who in youth lack dependence and tranquility, and in old age, lonely, leave the home life; these merely cherish the door of the Way as a lodging place, what seeing through is there? In sum, those who come must be settled; whether they see through or not, having come to the place of the Three Jewels, all are men of predestined affinity. Those who enter my gate are not poor, those who leave are not rich. Having entered my gate, you should embody my heart: the superior ones reverently pursue the mysterious sitting in meditation; the middling ones observe the scriptures, rites, and precepts; the lower ones perform hardships and labour—all these suffice for the conduct of those who have left the home life. What men cannot do, I strive to do; what men cannot endure, my heart endures. The able are able to cut off passion and desire; the patient can endure hunger and cold; thus they transcend men. One must make the heart empty, suffer no hindrance, not allow the slightest partiality; not only be without another, but also without self. Where there is no self, whence can demons arise? Seek the Way in this void and non-being, and the work will be attained naturally. If one sits in effort, contriving, one loses the true Way. In all things act within your measure, neither exceeding nor falling short; recognize what is great and accomplish the great, recognize what is small and accomplish the small; walking beside the measuring line and returning by the compass, though you neither become an immortal nor a Buddha, you shall not fail to be a good man. You will not have wasted your leaving of the home life. If you only know that tying the topknot is the Way, that shaving the head makes one a monk, yet the five aggregates remain undestroyed, the four appearances not forgotten; outwardly resplendent in robes and cap, inwardly little different from beasts; the mind of fame and profit not faint, the mind of right and wrong always present; thoughts of luxury, fearing that robes and food be worse than others'; hoping all works be as wished—such a man, though he leave the home life, has not truly left it. The name is called the Way, but it is not the Way. Seeing this, it were better to return to secular life and home, to accept suffering as enjoyment. Why linger long in the mysterious gate and make the Way an occupation, thereby incurring boundless sins? To fail to transcend in this life, and in the next to fall into the sea of suffering—this is the misfortune not yet obtained in this life, and the sin early sown for the next. Reflect on this!'

While Master Qiu spoke thus, more than ten men came from outside the mountain gate, all tall and strong men. Who were these men? They were the valiant brothers who once rescued the Perfected One on the Qinling Mountains—Zhao Bi, Wang Neng, Zhu Jiu, and others of their company. They had formerly saved Master Qiu on the Qinling Mountains, and the Perfected One had spoken to them a few words of cause and effect of merits and faults, warning and awakening them. Each had reformed and turned from evil, setting up a miscellaneous goods business, travelling the land of You and Yan, through which they could subsist for more than ten years.

Zhao Bi, Li Xiong, Zhang Jian were already aged; only Wang Neng and Zhu Jiu had not yet grown beards. Hearing it said that at Baiyun Temple there was a Great Perfected One named Qiu, a man of the Way, who last year prayed for sweet rain and saved ten thousand people; later he foretold that the Empress would bear a Crown Prince, and by a wager with Master Baiyun the Chan-shih obtained possession of Baiyun Temple. Now he was widely recruiting those who study the Way and practice cultivation, lecturing and expounding there. Hearing this, they rejoiced. Zhao Bi said: 'When we saved that elder on Qinling Mountain, his tablet bore the words of Master Qiu; could it be that he has now attained the Way? Why should we not go to Baiyun Temple to see?' Zhang Jian said: 'We often travel in search of men of the Way; now perhaps our wish may be fulfilled.' Zhu Jiu said: 'If he has the Way and virtue, we shall bow to him as master and leave the home life.' Zhao Bi said: 'Brother Zhu speaks with a frankness that is pleasing.'

So they all came to Baiyun Temple, and just then Master Qiu and the Wayfarers were sitting in the great hall yard, discoursing on the words of leaving the home life and learning well. Seeing them enter, Master Qiu rose and said: 'Valiant men, how have you fared since last we met?' Zhao Bi and the others did not recognize Master Qiu; they asked in haste: 'By Heaven’s protection we have found peace. You, Master, we have met before, but have forgotten; pray reveal yourself.' Master Qiu said: 'Do you not remember the Daoist who fed you on the Qinling Mountain when you were hungry?' Zhao Bi said: 'Are you the Daoist who instructed our elder then?' Master Qiu said: 'If not I, who else?' Hearing this, Zhao Bi and the others all bowed, saying: 'More than ten years have passed since we parted; we have all grown old and frail, the elder’s visage has become less; truly you are a man of the Way! You once said that after the elder attained the Way, we should come to seek you; we hope you will receive us and allow us to become disciples. What is your will?' 

Master Qiu said: 'The debt of saving lives is not forgotten. If you say I have attained the Way, truly I have gained nothing; only by the Way I enlighten the world. Alas! The sea of suffering is boundless; return and seek the shore! My words were only to warn myself. Who knew that the valiant men hearing them would cleanse their hearts and courageously reform? They are not bad men, having held strong their resolve for more than ten years. Now having seen through the red dust, they seek to leave the home life; this is also a joyful matter. But having come to leave the home life, you are all men who in previous lives have accumulated good deeds, else this thought could not arise. Though you have the heart to become monks and Daoists, you must carefully observe the precepts and teachings; you must be compassionate and humble, respectful to all; do not let nature run wild, nor let false thoughts arise. You should abandon self for others, and above all avoid taking life and harming living beings. Do not say I am less than others and thus give rise to jealousy; do not say others are not as good as I and thus conceive contempt. Do not let the spirit of rivalry oppress others; do not foster pride. If I am not as good as he, it is that my cultivation has not arrived; if he is not as good as I, it is that his time has not come. The Way has no great or small; the official has no rank high or low; neither rich nor poor, what distinction of rank or age? He who has the Way is great; he who has virtue is honoured. The studious are like gold and jade; the unstudious like grass and weeds. They do not sell gold and silver, but prize benevolence, righteousness, and virtue. The Son of Heaven who leaves the home life is not noble; the beggar who leaves it is not lowly. In my youth I lost dependence and peace; thanks to elder brothers' aid I grew up, knowing no connection with the red dust, with one heart seeking the Way and cultivating truth. I met my master, the Perfected One Chongyang, who gave me the supreme Way; I also had the great assistance of my senior brother Ma Danyang. Since parting at the Xie Valley, I have striven hard; I have endured great hunger 7,200 times, nearly dying; suffered innumerable lesser hungers; the hardships are too many to tell; yet my heart was like iron and stone, willing to die rather than turn back from the original intent. The more trials I suffered, the firmer my resolve became. I worked six years of hard labour in Fanxi; the difficulties are beyond words. There is a saying, "After suffering comes sweetness." One day I suddenly awakened, and Heaven showed favour. My many prayers for rain were answered with sweet dew. My fame then spread through the empire, and I was summoned to the court. Though it is said "the fruit of the Way is not yet formed," to have come this far is not easy. Since you desire to leave the home life, you should bear these thoughts: do not let riches and honours move your heart; do not let poverty and lowliness change your resolve; regard me as one dead to the world. Having found life in death, you should arise with a great mind and seek the method of immortality; then you may be called a Perfected One.'

When Master Qiu finished speaking, Zhao Bi and the others wept and lamented, deeply moved by the hardships the Perfected One had endured in cultivation. Master Qiu said: 'Until you have reached the utmost of suffering, the tongue’s root is not exhausted, and wisdom is hard to open. Now I wish you to seek it in suffering; for each suffering endured, a demon obstruction retires; endure ten parts of suffering and the demon energy is wholly dispelled.' When the Perfected One finished speaking, he chose a day to invest them with caps and bind their hair, each taking a name of the Way, which need not be mentioned here.

Meanwhile, the Empress reflected thus: I gave birth to a girl who, when carried out of the hall and made to turn, changed into a boy; Master Baiyun lost so great a temple to Qiu Changchun, all because of me, causing this calamity. Fearing that Master Baiyun was troubled in his heart, she sent an attendant to summon the Chan-shih to the palace to comfort him, saying it was on account of this child that her master had suffered. Master Baiyun said: 'By calculation it must be a phoenix; but I do not know by what sorcery Qiu Changchun changed it into a boy. I fear it is not a blessing for the realm.' The Empress said: 'His Majesty is concerned for the lack of an heir; I dare not speak plainly. His Majesty esteems Qiu Changchun as a divine immortal, and daily he lectures on the Way and discusses the mysterious in the imperial gardens, rarely returning to the palace.' Master Baiyun said: 'In the time of Emperor Ming of the Tang, the court celebrated Zhang Guo as an immortal. Emperor Ming secretly put poison into the wine, and Zhang Guo drank three cups. He said, "The wine is not good, the meat is not good." Then he fainted for half a moment, his teeth all blackened; when he awakened he urgently sought the iron ruyi before the throne, broke all the black teeth away, and after a moment all the teeth behind grew white. Only then did Emperor Ming believe he was truly an immortal descended. Now, Madam, why not imitate Emperor Ming’s story and place poison wine on the table for Qiu Changchun to drink? If he drinks and does not die, then he is a true immortal.' The Empress, hearing this, was greatly pleased, and immediately ordered the attendant to proclaim this; not knowing what would happen when Changchun came to drink the wine. Let us see what is revealed in the next chapter.

The immortal’s little stratagems are hard to escape.
