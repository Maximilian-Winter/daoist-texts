# Preface

I have pondered on the origin of the Way and Virtue, the root of life and nature; it is the Qi, it is the principle. It is diffused in the midst of the Great Void, condensed within the Six Directions, establishing Heaven and Earth, the primal beginning and essential end. It has extended through antiquity without change, endured through myriad kalpas to long existence, ever higher and farther, most true and most spiritual. The Most High forcibly named it the Way.

Fuxi beheld the River Diagram and the numbers of Heaven and Earth, Yin and Yang in their generation, and from these numbers produced the trigrams and lines. Cangjie, following the numbers of the Luo Writing, took near things from the body and distant things from objects, and saw the traces of birds and thereby made characters. Wen, Wu, and Duke Zhou elaborated on the Zhou Yi, explaining the subtle workings of the Later Heaven, thereby formulating transmissions and legends, expounding on the Heavenly Way, and reaching the root origin of creation.

Confucius edited the Book of Songs and the Book of Documents, established the rites and music, and made clear the beginnings of benevolence and righteousness. The Empress Nü Huang taught the rules of betrothal and marriage, establishing the beginnings of human relationships. Thus the Three Powers were fixed, and the Six Arts completed; literature and writing flourished, and rites and music were produced.

As for the hundred schools of writings and the scriptures of the Three Teachings, they are so numerous as to fill the barns and houses, and their number is beyond counting in the millions and billions. Contemporary men cannot exhaustively investigate the root source, but only seek at the branches and pluck the leaves; the more they see, the more bewildered they become, and the more they seek, the farther they stray.

Now the affairs of the world are dissolute and corrupted, and men’s lives are frivolous and unstable. When they behold luxury and licentious discourse, it seems like sugar and honey; when they hear the true and genuine principles, it is as if it were a fissure or enmity. Therefore, evil and delusion increase daily, and the righteous spirit wastes away day by day. All who are wise seek to refine themselves through pen and ink; those who serve as officials are intent on fame and profit.

Hence the national customs decline, the hearts of the people depart, how can there be security without ruin? Now those who hold fast to a heart of loyalty and uprightness, and establish a will of firmness and courage, are rare indeed; those who in their hearts cultivate the Way and Virtue, and place their footing upon life and nature, are even rarer.

Alas! Every one in the world contends for fame and strives for profit; every man delights in wine and is lost in flowers. Who knows that when joy reaches its extreme, sorrow will surely come; when fortune is exhausted, calamity will immediately arrive? If one does not practise the Eight Virtues, though he attain the Three Honours, he is ultimately a petty man; if he does not cultivate the Ten Goods, though he be rich with all under Heaven, he will die a poor ghost. In life, he seeks a false name; in death, he falls into the prison of incessant suffering; only a foul name is left to flow through ten thousand generations — what profit is that to me?

The wise and enlightened should quietly reflect upon this, swiftly reform themselves, return from error to right, repent past mistakes and cultivate the future, so that their bodies be not sunk in the bitter sea, overwhelmed and lost in ruin.

How mournful indeed! Now the world declines, the Way is faint, the days of the sages are far away. Those who have true resolve find not their gate; men are all led astray by inferior sects and wild teachings. Those without old roots, by their empty feelings and illusory scenes, take seriously (what is false); they seek pleasure in wine, women, wealth, and anger; they contend for fame like snails for their horns, they seize for profit like flies for a spot. How know they that time is limited, and in a moment changes? When the illusion is awakened from, all things are not true; where the puppets are drawn together, all is false. The bitter sea has no bounds; turn back and you reach the shore.

I have seen the old copy of the "Transmission of the Seven Perfected," wherein not only are the Way and Virtue utterly lacking, but the words are confused and disorderly; also, the origins of the Perfected and the traces of the immortals are nowhere verifiable, so I fear it will mislead and harm later ages by feigning seriousness. Therefore I have thoroughly read the treasures of history and proclamations, searched for sayings and recorded alchemical scriptures, and compiled this book, recording altogether four volumes and twenty-four chapters.

Among them, the chief is the Seven Golden Lotuses by Chongyang as he crossed over, named the "Golden Lotus Immortal History." In it every matter is substantiated, every word is true; it is the precious raft that ascends to Heaven and the kind vessel that ferries through the world. I only wish those who aspire to the Way would carefully and quietly ponder and enjoy it, and not treat it as a petty book or worldly writing.

If one can reach the significance within this book, the gate of the Way and Virtue may be entered, and the path of cultivation of the Perfected may be sought. The learner should emulate the steadfast and determined hearts of the two ancestors Qiu and Bai, be brave, vigorous, and diligent, cultivating the Way’s work; how then need one fear that Virtue will not be established, or the Way will not be accomplished? Thus have I written this preface.

In the autumn full moon day of the Jiachen year of Guangxu.
