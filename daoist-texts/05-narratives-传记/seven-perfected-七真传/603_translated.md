# Chapter Four: The Drunken Immortal Bridge — Shi Xiong Meets the Dao Ancestor; At Liquean Temple, Zhong and Lü Test the Mortal Mind

Verses say:

From ancient bonds a seed of heart is early known,  
Seeking to learn of true immortals’ way alone.  
One draught of nectar, drunk, ensnares in dreams profound,  
Water and fire in topsy-turvy round.  
When flowers bloom, the infant clasps with twin hands tight;  
When moon is bright, delighting without sense of night.  
Illusive realms are not the truth,  
Transformations of myriad demons now laid to ruth,  
Fear not the coming of change, fleeting and slight.  
— To the tune “White Snow Chant”

Now it is told that Wang Shi Xiong and his wife, both with tranquil hearts, set forth in quest of the Dao. They entrusted the household affairs to their eldest son, Jin Yu. In the year of Ji Mao, Shi Xiong journeyed to Zhongnan, arriving at the bridge by Ganhe town, where he beheld two men of the Way sitting silent and serene, their countenances like mist and clouds, their spirit lofty as the heavens. Shi Xiong knew at once they were men of the Way, and hastened forward with reverence, saying: “May I inquire, venerable immortals, what immortal descent are you of? From whence is your celestial register? In what famous mountain cave do you now cultivate? What has brought you hither? To behold your immortal visages is truly a three-life fortune. Pray, master, instruct me in the cause.”

The two immortals smiled and said: “Though we are not deities of the heavens, we have been reckoned as recluses beyond the dust. Our births are in different ages, our arts diverse in civil and martial skill. Yesterday at Penglai we attended a meeting; this morning we intend to journey to Qingcheng, here only to rest briefly. You, now cast down, have awakened from worldly passions; what more is there to seek?” Hearing these words, Shi Xiong knew they were genuine immortals descended, and bowed deeply, saying: “Though your disciple has cast off name and fetter, yet cannot leap beyond the dust of the world. My family name is a maze, I have not attained the path of True Cultivation; my mortal body is impure and common, hard to approach the land of learning the Way. I humbly beseech the immortal masters to bestow a thread of mystery, to open the road from my dullness to awakening, that with gratitude I may not forget in death.”

Seeing his earnestness, the two immortals taught him the secret of the Returning Elixir, pointing out each step, and further said: “On the holy birthday of Lord Lao next spring, we may meet again at Liquean Temple.” Then from their waists they took out a small gourd, and from their sleeves a wine cup, which they filled to the brim. They said to Shi Xiong: “This is the jade nectar, rare among men. Drink this cup, and your life shall be lengthened by a decade. Your destiny’s root is deep; today you are met.” Shi Xiong bowed in thanks and drank. The wine was extraordinarily sweet, and he thought: “Such fine wine, why not give me a few more cups?” The immortals perceived his thought, and said: “One cup is enough; it will bring sleep for seven days. How can you drink more?” With that they parted, transformed into a pure breeze and departed.

Shi Xiong, seeing the two immortals vanish as wind, prepared to return home. Suddenly his limbs became weak, and he fell drunkenly upon the bridge. Passersby found a drunken man there, with a poem upon his robe collar, which read:

This man is no mortal born,  
Once he bore the imperial edict, descended to dust forlorn.  
Today he meets immortals, drunk on wine divine,  
Seven days he sleeps ere consciousness incline.

All said: “This is the Drunken Immortal indeed!” And thus the bridge came to be named Drunken Immortal Bridge. But this is a later tale, and will not be told here.

Meanwhile Shi Xiong slept deeply on this bridge for seven days. The Ganhe town lies at the foot of Zhongnan Mountain, some fifty or sixty li from Dawei village, along a great road leading to Chang’an. The words of the Drunken Immortal had already reached the ears of his sons, Jin Yu and Jin Bao. The brothers conferred: on the one hand, their father had gone to Zhongnan and was absent without news for several days, causing suspicion; on the other hand, they had heard of the Drunken Immortal’s marvel, and wished to see him. They sought out Ganhe town and found their father sleeping upon the bridge. Seeing the poem on his robe, they knew he had met immortals and drunk their wine, fallen intoxicated there. They hastened to hire a carriage and bore their father home. Upon awakening, Shi Xiong recounted all about meeting the immortals and drinking their nectar; all marvelled exceedingly. Shi Xiong, reflecting on meeting his masters on the ninth day of the ninth month, took the name Chongyang; with understanding and enlightenment, he renamed himself Zhiming. With the two masters’ secret instructions he daily pondered mysteries with his wife, cultivating the subtle Way together. In the second month of the Gengchen year, recalling the promise to meet again, he bade his wife farewell and journeyed south to Mount Taibai, seeking Liquean Temple.

It was that Liquean Temple stood on the boundary between Duxian and Shengli counties, not far from Zhongnan town, about two hundred li from Dawei village. On that day Chongyang reached the foot of Zhongnan Mountain, watching the sun set behind the western hills and the moon rise over the eastern sea. Inns were scarce, and people few. In his wandering he saw lights shining through the forest. Following the lights, he entered and found a lofty house. An old man lit the door lamp, on which was written the plain characters “Jia Mansion.” Knowing the surname Jia, Chongyang bowed and asked: “May I inquire, sir, is this the Jia Mansion?” The old man returned the salute: “This is indeed Jia Mansion. The night grows late; what business has a guest come with? Pray speak, so I may report to my mistress.” Chongyang said: “I am from Dawei village, Xianyang, surname Wang, named Shi Xiong. I intend to offer incense at Liquean Temple. Passing your esteemed mansion, I found no inns, but saw your light and sought shelter here. Seeing ‘Jia Mansion’ written, I come to lodge for a night, if you have room?” The old man said: “Passing through is welcome to lodge, of course. But my master has passed, and all matters are ruled by the lady. Pray wait a moment, so I may report to her and bring her to receive you.” Chongyang said: “Much obliged, sir.” The old man went in and soon returned, saying: “My lady bids you enter.”

The old man closed the great door and led the way, Chongyang following. Passing through many corridors, they arrived at a guest hall, where the rooms were elegant and corners uneven. Entering and seating, Chongyang saw famous calligraphy and paintings of mountains and water hanging on either side, serene and graceful in style. Suddenly a young girl of fourteen or fifteen brought fragrant tea. Shortly after, the kitchen brought forth a table richly laden with dishes, utensils exquisite beyond the common. A pot of fine wine, two sets of cups and chopsticks. Then three or four maidens supported a beauty like jade and flower. Chongyang beheld and wondered at her attire:

Face like the full moon, eyebrows like twin spring mountains;  
Lips red as vermilion, eyes hiding an autumn pool.  
Clad in white silk robes, like Lady Yang of Tang;  
Waist girded in a green gauze skirt, surpassing the famed Xi Zi of Wu.  
Her speech was like the warble of orioles, her smile like flower petals unfolding.  
Hair like black clouds veiling willow leaves, figure like spring waters floating peach blossoms.  
Aroma like orchid and musk fragrant, voice ringing like metal and jade.  
Truly: the moon palace’s Huan’e descends to the mortal world,  
The jade pond’s fairy maiden alights the dust of men.

The lady advanced and performed the customary kowtow, saying: “I did not expect the arrival of such a noble uncle; I failed to go forth to welcome, and beg pardon for the neglect.” Chongyang returned her greeting: “I come to offer incense at Liquean Temple, passing by. The night falls and I sought shelter here. Your hospitable welcome is much appreciated. Yet to call you ‘uncle’ may be mistaken.” The lady smiled: “While my late husband lived, he spoke of Wang of Xianyang, his old friend and schoolfellow, a man of military command and literary talent. Now seeing you, your bearing is indeed extraordinary, words not vain.” Chongyang said: “Through decades of official toil, friends are forgotten. Pray, madam, since your husband passed, have you any sons?” The lady sighed: “Alas, my husband died long ago, leaving no issue, only this estate. Though filled with gold and silver, jewels and treasures, there is no one to manage them. Never mind nephews, even intimate kin are none. I would fain select a worthy man to take charge, to be my support to the end. Of men these days, I find none sincere. If, uncle, you could condescend to grant me this favour, I would count myself most fortunate.” Chongyang bowed his head in silence, thinking: “This woman is without shame; by mere chance meeting, she entrusts me with a lifelong pledge. Little does she know my heart is set on the Way; the dust and world’s ways are already cut through; wine, women, wealth, and lust are all crossed out in one stroke.”

Seeing his silence, the lady approached with wine: “Hunger must afflict you, uncle; pray drink and eat.” Chongyang said: “I have vowed to fast and abstain these days, holding to vegetarian fare, as I prepare to worship Lord Lao on his birthday. Since you graciously offer, one meal will suffice.” The lady replied: “Have you not heard the sages say: ‘In sacrifice, act as if present; in worship, as if the deity is near’? Sincerity of heart and abstinence of mouth suffice; why bind yourself to forms of abstaining from wine and flesh? Yet if you insist, I cannot compel you.” She then ordered the kitchen to prepare vegetarian food.

After eating, the lady bade two maidens to accompany Chongyang to rest. He took leave, following them to a chamber where the bed was splendid and pure. Sitting in meditation long, he fell asleep. In his dim dream, two maidens entered, bringing the lady with them. The maidens withdrew; the lady closed the door, removed her outer clothes, revealing a body like snow. A fragrant breeze blew forth as she approached to share the bed. Chongyang was greatly alarmed, thinking: “If this beauty ensnares me, my life is lost!” He hastily pushed away the covers, leapt from the bed, opened the door and fled. The moonlight shone as bright as day. The place was a garden; he quickly leapt over the flower wall and saw a great road. Taking advantage of the bright moonlight, he walked slowly.

Suddenly before him a blaze appeared; a mountainside collapsed, revealing two great stone coffers of gold and silver, dazzling with radiance. Chongyang thought: “Gold and silver are of no use to me now; if Heaven grants these, let them serve to aid the needy.” He prayed aloud: “If these treasures are to be given to another, let me have no share. If to me, I dare to keep them until my Way is perfected, to benefit the world.” Suddenly the gold and silver vanished.

Then a black tiger came rushing down the mountain, with sharp teeth and claws, intent to devour Chongyang. Chongyang said: “Tiger, lord of beasts, can understand human speech. I, Wang Chongyang, seek the Way with single heart; what have I to fear? Past sins of ancestors now meet retribution; if you would eat me, then eat; if you would go, then go.” The tiger shook its head and wagged tail, returning up the mountain.

Chongyang pressed onward. Not three li distant, he was beset by bandits, armed with spears and knives, surrounding him, demanding money: “This man is rude and unreasonable, trespassing on our road. Have you silver to leave? Spare your miserable life! If no silver, we’ll send you to Yama at once!” Chongyang saw their weapons brandished. He thought: “If I flee, others will be harmed. Better to seize a blade and slay them clean, so no more harm is done.” Resolute, he rushed forward, kicking one bandit to the ground, snatching a knife in hand, about to strike, when a voice behind cried: “No, no!”

Chongyang turned abruptly and fell backward, awakening to find himself in a wilderness at dawn. Reflecting on his dream, all worldly thoughts were cleansed, only spirit and nature remained to be cultivated gradually. As he journeyed, he asked of the Jia Mansion’s origin. For twenty li around there was no sign of habitation; he knew it was a divine manifestation testing his heart. Chongyang’s resolve for the Way grew steadfast. His journey proceeded unrecorded.

Meanwhile, the two immortals Zhong and Lü had revealed various transformations at Jia Mansion to test him. Wine, lust, and wealth were overcome, but one breath yet remained: “This youth’s former causes are not dark; he may be instructed in the secret of the Golden Liquid Returning Elixir.” The two immortals transformed into two disciples quarrelling at the mountain gate of Liquean Temple.

Chongyang arrived at Liquean Temple, bought incense and candles, first to offer incense with respectful worship and prayer; then sought out the two masters. Outside the mountain gate sat two disciples fighting. Chongyang approached to mediate: “For what cause do you two quarrel here?” They said: “We are beggars, fighting for food. What brings you here?” Chongyang thought: “They speak with reason. They fight for food, I seek the Way. Do they know my intent?” He advanced and bowed: “I hear your words have cause; do you understand my purpose?” The two immortals then revealed their former forms at Ganhe town, saying: “Can you recognize us?” Chongyang, seeing them, bowed deeply. The immortals ceased, joined hands, and departed. At a place deserted by men, the three sat, imparting the true essence of the Golden Elixir. Then they pointed eastward, saying: “Why do you not observe it?” Chongyang looked east and saw golden light dazzling, with seven golden lotuses bearing seed. The immortals laughed: “Not only so: there will be ten thousand jade lotus pods.” Then the two masters swept their sleeves and departed.

Chongyang, bewildered, returned to Xianyang, renaming his wife He Yuchan. Together with Daoist friend Li Lingyang, they built a hermitage and cultivated for three years. When Chongyang’s embryo breath was perfected, he severed smoke and fire, dwelling in a cave, nurturing spirit for twelve years. Men named him “Tomb of the Living Dead.” When he emerged, his wife He Yuchan’s Dao fruit was also ripened. At that time, Shi Chuhou, Liu Tongche, and Yan Chuchang successively attained the Way, wandering to accumulate merit.

Hearing the court abandoned the lands of Sichuan and Shaanxi, Chongyang left the eastern passes to guide the lost masses, to fulfill the omen of the golden lotus. At Mount Song, he met two men, semblance unlike the ordinary; the three bowed and sat to converse. Chongyang asked the two friends their names. They said: “Our surname is Xue, styled Zixian. Formerly monks, we met our master, the immortal Shi Xinglin, and with ancestral master Zhang Ziyang discoursed on the Six-Character Sutra verse. Thereupon we left the monastic path to seek the Returning Elixir’s true meaning. Now with disciple Zhang Huanwei we seek a place to refine the elixir. Pray tell your master’s name and title.” Chongyang related his attainment and origins. Though the Way came from Zhong and Lü, Zixian’s elixir was completed first, and the two showed mutual respect. Chongyang asked: “Where is your master now?” Zixian said: “My master passed away last year, leaving a verse:  
‘Thunder breaks the mud pellet’s cave,  
The immortal rides the fiery dragon.  
Who first struck the hand unknown,  
Breaking the vast void alone?’”

Chongyang said: “From this verse one sees the return to spirit and void. Whither do you now journey?” Zixian answered: “We will visit master Haishan at Mount Hua. I have a disciple Chen Cuixu at Huizhou; may the master instruct him in the mystery, increase his faith?” Chongyang agreed, and they parted.

Chen Cuixu, from Baishui Rock, Boluo county, Huizhou prefecture, named Nan, styled Nanmu, made barrel hoops for a living. He met the mountain spirit Li Laosan, who taught him the Great Thunder Sutra of Jingxiao, able to heal with talisman water and earth pills; called Chen Mud Pills by the people. Later he met immortal Zixian who taught him the Returning Elixir secret; then master Pilin who imparted the Way of Taiyi’s blade and divining rod. When his cultivation was complete, his marvels were unfathomable; hair uncombed, he could summon heavenly spirits, command dragons to bring rain, wield iron whips to aid the world, travelling hundreds of li daily. Once he served immortal Zhang Ziyang, who warned him not to use the methods lightly, lest he invite profanation. Thus Cuixu heeded the warning, restraining himself.

So it is said:

Though methods aid the Way and found its root,  
Without root, methods shall ever come to ruin.  
When Way and method both are cultivated with merit,  
Surely the path to the elixir’s gate is near.

To learn more of Chen Mud Pill’s deeds, await the next chapter’s telling.
