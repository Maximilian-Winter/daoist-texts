# Chapter Fifth: Lord Li Laojun Assembles the Worthies at Kongtong; Wang Chongyang Ferries the Disciples across the Sea of Tranquillity

Verse says:

The Immortal Register esteems merit as the highest Way,  
Fit it is to seek it in the world of dust.  
Three thousand eight hundred fruits perfect and whole,  
In a single day, clear and free, mounting the crane to meet the host of immortals.  
In accord with circumstance, responding, transforming, the good causes and conditions.  
Once receiving the elixir’s summons, now gathering the Seven Golden Lotuses.  
When fruit is ripe and merit fulfilled, fleetly ascending to the Jade Heaven.  
(Tune: Yu Meiren)

The narrative tells: Wang Chongyang, the Perfected One, arrived at Huizhou to visit Chen Cuixu. There, he saw a cooper repeating the chant:

"From the fleeting comes the non-fleeting; how can water leak through?  
Once it is perfect and complete, inside and out is one true void."

Meanwhile, the Mud Pellet concealed within the market, when once working with the cooper, recited this very verse. He perceived a Taoist whose eyes shone with a divine radiance, unmistakably not of the ordinary sort. In haste he approached, bowing deeply in greeting. Chongyang inquired, "What did you see that you thus welcome me?" Cuixu replied, "The Immortal’s eyes emit divine light, and from his head flows purple vapor; hence I recognised you." Chongyang asked, "Have you been a disciple of Zi Xian?" He answered, "Indeed." Chongyang and Cuixu then withdrew to a secluded spot to discuss the principles of the Golden Elixir, in all respects agreeing. Together they journeyed to Mount Tiantai to meet in person the Perfected Zi Yang, lingering long in discourse. Chongyang then took leave, inviting a visit to the sea shore.

In the year Guǐwèi, before the era was changed to Longxing, in winter, the imperial edict summoned Guo Yong of Shanzhou, but he did not appear. Yong’s father was loyal and filial, studied under Cheng Yi, and composed the “Yi Commentary”; Yong inherited his learning. He had once debated with Chongyang the Way of Nourishing Life, styling himself the White Cloud Master. The Emperor bestowed upon him the title of the Recluse Chonghui.

In the summer of Jiashen, Zhang Jun passed away. That winter, the Jurchen attacked Chuzhou, and Wei Sheng died resisting the enemy.

In the spring of Yiyou, the Song changed the era name to Qiandao. Chen Kangbo died. At the Bureau of Military Affairs, Wang Gangzhong sat at midday reading documents when he saw Chen Kangbo arrive. He said, "I was near the Laurel Palace yesterday, and the loyalty and steadfastness of your son are commendable; the Emperor commands that you return to the Bureau, and attend the meeting at Feng Mountain." Gangzhong then passed away.

Meanwhile, the Supreme Lord Laozi commanded the Perfected Yin Xi to summon the assembly of Worthies, listing the merits of the immortals. On the eighteenth day of the third month in the year Dinghai, all gathered at Kongtong to report their merits and renew their vows. When the Dao instructions were issued, all immortals assembled to pay homage to the Lord. The Lord bade each to speak of the profound Way, to separately recount their true merits, their words differing in kind but returning to the same root purpose. The Lord commanded a Heavenly Feast to be prepared, and all were seated in order. The Heavenly Official of the Upper Origin, Tang Yao the Holy Emperor, said, "Men arise with greed and anger, thus brewing this calamitous fate. We cannot transform the ten thousand assemblies; to maintain the Great Harmony, though diligent in our duties, truly we are ashamed of having no merit." The Lord looked upon Wen Shi and the others, saying, "Well said, my sons; great are your merits and virtues! Saving all beings from fire and water, transforming vexations into coolness. The Heaven’s heart follows smoothly, the golden inscription hangs down as honour. But in the matter of delivering and aiding the world, what shall be the purpose? Say it again."

Wen Shi Perfected said, "Among the customs of past and present in the four quarters, first is harmony, then affairs; casting away anger and blocking desire, simplifying in things and forgiving men, weighing their light and heavy and guiding accordingly is sufficient." The Lord said, "Your words are very good."

Zheng Yang said, "The minor methods of the side doors easily show merit, and men delight in them, teaching one another, yet to death they do not awaken, and so they ruin the Great Way. They themselves are deep in the sea of bitterness; they return to pull others in; they exhort the foolish; they make their laws and rules manifest; the dead weigh heavily in the nether world. Truly, this is sad." The Lord said, "This is surely because ordinary men have little understanding, and because false teachings prevail, making it hard for confused followers to awaken. You must urgently rescue the correct course, so that they may become enlightened." Zheng Yang offered the “Song to Break Confusion and Correct the Way”; the Lord examined it and said, "This is sufficient to shatter the side doors and cause the confused to awaken. Though they may not attain the Truth in this life, in the next they can tread the path of the Great Way."

Chun Yang offered the “Knocking the Lines Song,” and “Directing the Great Elixir Song,” and “The Fisherman’s Words.” Hai Shan presented the “Returning Elixir Ode” and “Song of the Utmost Truth.” Yin Changsheng offered the “Dragon and Tiger Song.” Yan Junping presented the “Lead and Mercury Song.” Xu Shiyang advanced the “Drunken Thoughts Immortal Song.” The immortals submitted their works in succession. The Lord viewed them and praised, saying, "This shows how eager you sons are to deliver the world; you may be called the Great Wall of Our Way." He then ordered the attendants to serve refined cream, and all the Worthies drank deeply.

The Middle and Upper Earth Official, Yu Shun the Holy Emperor, said, "Just now I received the Jade Edict: The loyal Yue family has ascended to the celestial realms; the treacherous Qin Hui has gone to the Three Paths. But what will be the outcome of Song and Jin, the strong and the weak?" The Lord said, "The Jin men delight in killing, their cruelty is too great; in the future they shall be repaid by the Mongols, surely doubled in measure." He then commanded the Great Custodian to open the “Dao Treasury,” selecting scriptures and entrusting them to the immortals, saying, "These are the ‘Scriptures of Delivering Men,’ ‘Jade Pivot Scripture,’ and ‘Three Officials Scripture.’ Those who can receive, uphold, and recite them may dispel disasters and resolve distress. The ‘Great Brahman Dipper’ and ‘Morning Authentic Ritual’—by their rites one may invite blessings and prolong life. The ‘Life Spirit Chapter,’ ‘Aid Refining Ritual,’ ‘Deliverance from Suffering Scripture,’ and ‘Great Life Scripture’—by reciting these one may deliver the dead and ascend. The ‘Jade Emperor Scripture,’ ‘Three Caves Scripture,’ ‘Great Cave Scripture,’ ‘Dao De Jing,’ ‘Yellow Court Scripture,’ ‘Dragon and Tiger Scripture,’ ‘Yin Conjuring Scripture,’ and ‘Pure Tranquillity Scripture’—by understanding these, one may obtain the Way and attain Truth. You may pass these scriptures to those who believe in the Way, so that they may read, recite, and contemplate them. Those with aspiration will by themselves surpass men and become saints." The assembly bowed and took leave. The Lord commanded Ling Lun and others to escort them out of the mountain; each then ascended on the cloud path.

The Lord knew of the great pestilence in the two rivers; though Feng Chang and others were there to aid, the relief was insufficient, and he wished to go to assist. Li Ningyang also desired to accompany him.

Meanwhile, Feng Jian of Hedong, who was Feng Chang transformed, had first entered official service by passing the classical examinations. His nature was contrary to the world; he abandoned office to live by the Yi River, treating pestilence with medicine. At the time there was a Taoist named Master Li, practising the Way in the Jin realm, especially skilled in seeing ghosts. Master Li respected Feng Jian highly; men called him Jian by name, and ghosts fled at his approach. Master Li also taught afflicted households to write the character “Jian” on their doors, which ghosts would avoid.

Turning to Li Ningyang, who left to roam Chang’an calling himself Li the Guest. He often wore a straw raincoat and bamboo hat, with a gourd at his waist, selling rat poison in the city, marked by a wooden rat. When someone bought the poison, he would say, "This poison not only kills rats, but also cures disease." Zhang Zan, a bookseller, bought some rat poison; by lamp-light he saw several rats contend to eat it, and soon the rats grew wings and flew away. Surprised, Zan asked Li the Guest for more poison. The Guest said, "The poison is all gone." Zan returned and told his father, who, aged over seventy, had long suffered rheumatism. He took what was left of the rat’s poison, licked it, and immediately felt healed.

Ningyang went to Zhongnan to meet Zheng Yang and Chun Yang. At just that time Wang Chongyang arrived, paid respects, and thanked his master for his grace, also relating in detail how his wife He Yushan had attained the Dao. Zheng Yang said, "Your wife was originally a blue bird spirit guarding the flowers of the Jade Pool, descended to the world. By her early clarity and steadfastness, you transmitted to her the method to cultivate and attain the Dao; furthermore, she has accumulated merit and conduct; in time she will take rank as a Golden Immortal, no longer encumbered by feathers."

The three immortals were laughing and chatting when Ningyang arrived. Zheng Yang and Chun Yang emerged from the cave to welcome him, commanding Chongyang to pay homage to the Dao Ancestor: "This one is none other than the Strange Form True Immortal Li Ningyang, the Dao Lord." Chongyang bowed low, but Ningyang hastily detained him, saying, "You are the incarnation of the Perfected Tongcheng Wang Sheng, not forgetting your former causes; luckily you obtained the transformations of the Two Immortals Zhong and Lü, thus attaining the Dao and becoming true. Your ancient wish was profound, your heart eager to save men; in time your merit will be complete, and your immortal rank exalted." Hearing this, Chongyang knew his true origin. He again saluted Ningyang, saying, "Were it not for the transformations of my two masters, how could I have attained the appearance of the Dao Ancestor? Now that I have received your guidance, I vow to devote myself fully to salvation." Thus he bade farewell to the three immortals and returned to the Eastern Sea. The three immortals saw him out of the cave and parted. Ningyang remained to roam with the Two Immortals Zhong and Lü at Zhongnan. No more is told here.

Meanwhile, Ma Yifu married Lady Sun. The man was talented, the woman beautiful; the married couple were like fish in water, morning and evening reciting poetry and answering each other; their joy was manifest. Later, Ma Yifu served as a gentleman in the Yellow Gates, not seeking advancement nor delighting in office. They bore three sons: the eldest named Tingzhen, the second Tingrui, and the third Tinggui. When the three sons grew, each took a spouse. Time passed swiftly; Ma Yifu was now forty-five years old. Lady Sun had come to her fortieth spring, at forty-nine years of age. One day, Yifu was taking a midday nap when he dreamed that a Taoist led him to ascend Heaven, touring the holy realms, scenes beyond compare. Awakening with a feeling, he composed the following poem:

The dreamt man Hua Xu reaches the Ninth Heaven,  
In heaven everywhere dwell the assembly of immortals.  
Fragrance wafts at Purple Palace, dragons and phoenixes dance,  
Auspicious light shines on the cinnabar terrace, lions rest in leisure.  
The mortal realm is originally not the joy of true realms,  
The human body cannot compare with the firmness of the Dharma body.  
Wealth and honour in the red dust are finally not lasting,  
Leaping beyond the cage, one’s life extends ten thousand years.

Lady Sun, seeing this poem, inwardly marveled, and asked her husband the meaning. Yifu said, "The dream journey to the Heavenly Mansion moved me, so I composed this poem. I think that life in the world cannot last long; the longest lives reach a hundred years, the middling eighty, the shorter sixty. The sage says: at fifty one knows the mandate of Heaven. You and I have reached that age; the sun sets near the western mountains. If we do not turn our heads and examine ourselves swiftly, in old age we cannot escape impermanence. While our bodily forms remain strong, we should seek a wise teacher early, to find methods of saving the world, to cultivate the immortal spirit of long life; to roam free beyond things, becoming immortals as long-lived as Heaven. The Ten Continents and Three Islands come at a thought; the Great Thousand Worlds are free to invite and visit. When that time comes, is it not joyful!"

Lady Sun said, "My husband’s talk of cultivating immortality is most marvelous. But you and I are but ordinary folk; how can we rashly hope to reach such heights? I fear that one may attempt to paint a tiger and fail, ending up like a dog, inviting laughter." Yifu said, "From ancient times to the present, there have been tens of thousands who have attained the Dao; hundreds have left their homes and became true immortals. Have you not heard the ancient poem say:

Countless kalpas and births have led to this life; this life is but a predestined birth.  
If in this life one does not deliver the body,  
One will vainly contend for profit and fame in the world.

Careful study of the immortal records shows how many with shallow foundations, facing myriad demons and difficulties, diligently cultivate their bodies; failing in this life, they seek the next. Those with deep roots meet a true master early, receive the highest Way, and within three to five years transcend the Three Realms. As to roots, you and I are neither high nor low, but somewhere in between. In this life we have wealth and honour, a heart to aid the world; now surrounded by children and grandchildren, the couple free of illness—this is a great foundation. I wish to go abroad to seek masters of virtue and the Way, to transmit the method of long life, to cultivate into a Heaven Immortal; then my lifelong wish shall be fulfilled."

Lady Sun laughed, saying, "The ancients said: ‘A man’s honour is his wife’s glory.’ If my husband becomes a god-immortal, how can his wife fail to be immortal?" Yifu said, "The two words ‘god-immortal’ are the honours of Heaven, not to be compared with mortal matters. Honour and glory are words of mortals; cultivation of immortality is said, ‘the husband cultivates and the husband attains, the wife cultivates and the wife attains; self-cultivation leads to self-realisation.’ This means, ‘each one cultivates the body, each one attains; each one eats, each one is full.’ The food is in my belly; how can you be full? Moreover, as men live in the world, father and son, husband and wife, brothers and friends—when great calamity comes, the son cannot follow the father, how can the wife follow the husband? Each one flees by his own path; parting and death are inevitable."

This discourse made Lady Sun as if awakened from intoxication. She asked her husband, "If you find a wise master, might we cultivate together?" Yifu said, "If hearts are in accord, outsiders become intimate friends; if hearts differ, even kin are strangers."

A few days later, Ma Yifu had business at the city gate. Because of the summer heat, he sat for a moment and bought a melon to quench thirst. He saw an old Taoist approaching, and also sat down. What manner of appearance? Behold:

He wore a pure breeze kerchief on his head, sandals of many-eared rushes on his feet; holding a dust-cleaning whisk, clad in a jacket with a thousand needles in the sleeves. His eyes were bright and clear; twin beams of golden light flashed like thunder; his spirit within was silent; a cloud of harmonious energy like a turtle concealed. His ears large, nose prominent, face shining golden; forehead high and eyebrows broad, tongue patterned like brocade. Sitting like a rock, walking like a light breeze. Truly:

No one, no self, the true thusness body;  
Neither perishing nor arising, the free heart.

Ma Yu saw this venerable and extraordinary figure, and bought a melon, saying, "Master, the weather is hot, yet you wear a jacket; are you not afraid of the steaming heat? I buy this melon to make a bond with you." Chongyang said nothing, took the melon, and ate it starting from the stem. Ma Yu said, "The stem is bitter; why not discard it?" Chongyang said, "Fragrance comes from the foul; sweetness arises from bitterness." Ma Yu asked again, "Master, from where do you come? What brings you here?" Chongyang said, "I have come a thousand li, only to support a drunken man." Ma Yu was amazed, knowing he was a man of the Way. He stepped forward and bowed deeply, saying, "Your disciple sees that your appearance is extraordinary and your words uncommon; having a mind to save men, I request you to come to my home to rest a few days. Might I know your honoured intentions?"

Chongyang saw his sincerity and reverence, knowing him to be a vessel of the Way, and went with Ma Yu to his house. Sitting in the hall, he bade the servants prepare tea and offerings. Chongyang said, "This poor Daoist has come down from the mountain, long avoiding the smoke and fire (world)." Ma Yu heard this and became more respectful, hastening to call out Lady Sun, saying, "Today I entered the city and met this true immortal. He has not eaten smoke or fire foods for many years; this man surely has the Way." Lady Sun came forward, and the couple both bowed. Chongyang saw the woman, though near the age of destiny, having an extraordinary form and countenance; she will become a great vessel in the future, but her present Dao heart is not yet firm; I shall slowly probe it.

Ma Yu invited the Master to stay in the flower hall for quietude, buying daily melons and fruits for his support. Chongyang renamed Ma Yu as Chu Yu, styled Tong Bao, and titled Dan Yang. Dan Yang bowed and asked the Master, "What is the Way?" Chongyang answered, "The Way is the empty and formless essence, forcibly named the Prior Heaven. It is where the Five Elements have not yet reached, before father and mother gave birth."

Dan Yang immediately grasped the general principle, serving the Master tirelessly, daily discoursing on the mysteries and the Way. Chongyang shared a pear with Dan Yang, and composed a poem for reflection:

This fruit is round without, firm within;  
Within lies a single point, the Prior Heaven.  
Gathered and tasted with condensed flower dew,  
Released it appears like a lotus rising from water.  
Cleaving open the primordial chaos to cultivate the wondrous Way,  
Splitting the Great Ultimate to select the true lead.  
The common men do not know the profound origin;  
Who knows that eating pears has secret transmission?

Every division of the pear was tenfold, each time accompanied by a poem to transform it, with many instructions. Dan Yang still had not fully awakened. No more is told.

Meanwhile, in the prefecture of Dengzhou, Ninghai Prefecture, there lived a man surnamed Tan, named Yu, styled Boyu. His ancestral home was Luoyang in Henan. When the Jin armies crossed south to attack Bianjing, he fled to Shandong’s Dengzhou, Ninghai to lodge. The three prefectures of Deng, Lai, and Qing are near the sea shore and off the main roads. Though the Jin men arrived and took cities, the people yielded, and no great conflict arose; the place was peaceful. Thus many outsiders fled in. Tan Yu was born in the first day of the third month of the year Guimao of the Jin Taizong’s Tianhui era. At birth, auspicious colored clouds shone about the chamber. He was somewhat intelligent but met with Jin soldiers’ disorder, fleeing with his father to Ninghai, opening a shop to make a living. His father died; he lived contentedly and simply, devoted to purity and emptiness, without thought of marriage and heirs, determined to guard his primal essence. At forty-two, suddenly he suffered from wind-damp disease. Seeking physicians was fruitless; medicines had no effect. For three years he suffered, walking was difficult. He heard that at Ma Yu’s household there was a true immortal, clad in single garments winter and summer, who did not eat smoke-fire foods. "If there be efficacy, curing my disease as before, I will beseech to become a monk." His resolve was firm. He took a sedan chair and came to Ma’s door, alighting and entering to inquire. Ma’s household led him to the flower hall to meet.

Dan Yang asked the cause of his coming and introduced him to the Master. Tan Yu, seeing Chongyang, majestic and extraordinary, knew him to be a celestial immortal come to earth, and hastened to bow low, beseeching cure of his stubborn malady. Chongyang examined his spirit, seeing that his past predestined seeds were present, his root and vessel extraordinary. Taking from the gourd three elixir pills, he said to Tan Yu, "You must decoct these in rootless water and take them; after a deep sleep for some time, your disease will immediately be healed." Truly:

A past seed met in this life,  
Attaining the Way and cultivating here.  
Were it not for Tan’s diligent and earnest will,  
How else could he see the true Heaven in days to come?

To learn what follows for Tan Yu, wait for the next chapter to unfold.
