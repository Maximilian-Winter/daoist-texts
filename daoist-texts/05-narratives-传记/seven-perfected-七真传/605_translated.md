# Chapter Six: Wang Chongyang Sends Forth His Spirit to Test True Heart; Sun Bu’er Loses Her Face to Seek the Supreme Way

Verses say:

To truly aspire to learn the Way of Immortals,  
One must diligently apply oneself within.  
With earnest practice and resolute will, patiently refining,  
Harmonising mercury and lead to form the cinnabar’s head.  
Transformation and flight come gracefully and at ease.  
The three trials of the maiden’s heart are truly stringent;  
Losing one’s visage in quest of the Way, the dustly passions retreat.  
When passions retreat, profound skill is shown to refine soul and spirit.

Now it is told that Dan Yang hastily bid his servant fetch water from the Rootless Spring to brew tea, which he gave to Tan Yu to drink; then leading him to the bedchamber, caused him to fall into a deep sleep. Tan Yu, having taken the elixir, slept and upon waking found his illness cured, his spirit refreshed. He then approached Chongyang, bowing and beseeching guidance to save the world. Chongyang said: “For all who cultivate the Way, entering it is easy, hearing of it is difficult; hearing of it is easy, yet keeping it is hard; keeping it is easy, yet accomplishing it is hard; accomplishing it is easy, yet understanding it fully is hard. Thou art already over forty years of age; thy spirit is spent and returning is not easy. Though thou must set a brave heart and strong resolve, first cleanse thy thoughts, next guard thy attention amidst the dusty world, until no thought arises, no speck of dust remains; then the true Way may be heard, the true Dharma cultivated. I now accept thee; thou must change thy guise and name. Take the name Chuduan, styled Tongzheng, and called Changzhen.” Changzhen bowed in thanks to the Master, then to Senior Brother Dan Yang. Returning to his inn, he pledged his goods and came to serve Dan Yang. This will not be further told.

Meanwhile, Chongyang had dwelt with the Ma family for over four months; Madam Sun still lacked full faith. Though Dan Yang came and went bearing messages, she was yet to understand. It was the tenth month, the air crisp with the first frost, golden chrysanthemums blossomed by the fence, and hibiscus bloomed resplendently in the garden. Chongyang’s heart was joyful and he composed a poem:

Entering the realm, I once saw jade hibiscus,  
Delicate and graceful, perfume dense upon the verdure.  
Its splendour owes all to the moon of late night,  
Diligent is the sudden breeze that stirs it.  
Flowers fade and leaves fall as time flees,  
Trees age, branches wither, frost and snow meet.  
If one would have the roots endure unending,  
I urge thee swiftly to seek the Golden Lord.

When Chongyang had finished, he sat down with bowed brows. Dan Yang entered, perceiving the Master’s meaning in the poem, seeing it might touch Madam Sun’s heart, but alas, she remained lost and unaware; thus he gently copied the poem to take back to his own alchemy chamber to nurture quietude. This will not be further told.

Chongyang saw Madam Sun’s obstinacy and sent forth his yang spirit, entering her chamber and embracing her. Madam Sun struggled with all her might and freed herself, hastening out to inform Dan Yang. She thought: “My lord esteems this man as a living immortal; how is it that yet his lusts remain unbroken? Where lies the Way? Surely he has but deceived my lord. This man has been here over four months, not eating cooked food; how can his desires be unextinguished? Doubtful indeed. If I tell my lord, he may not believe me and it will be an embarrassment. I must endure.”

Days passed, and Chongyang entered her chamber again. She hastened aside and turned her face, saying: “Thou madman, shameless indeed! Since thy coming to my house, my lord has held thee as a living immortal; months have passed, yet thou comest to my chamber to molest me. If I tell my lord, how wilt thou save thy face? Depart swiftly!” Chongyang said: “When I dwelt at Zhongnan to cultivate the Way, I tasted simplicity and detachment, and my desires vanished. Now, these few months in thy house have replenished my spirit; there is a saying: ‘When full and warm, desires arise; when hungry and cold, nature is preserved.’ I dare pray for means to bind our fate.” Madam Sun, hearing this, was vexed and went to Dan Yang’s chamber, recounting the Master’s repeated molestations and saying: “You regard this man as a living immortal and keep him at home these months; yet he has acted shamelessly. Fortunately, I have avoided being entangled. Were I caught, and had I cried out, all would see, and I would be disgraced; if I did not, would I not be defiled for life? In my view, send him away quickly to avoid further trouble.”

Dan Yang, hearing this, was inwardly angered and said: “You base woman, know you not the Way? My Master has been at my house for four months, sitting in the flower hall daily, never stepping out. You yourself are lost and unwilling to return, yet do not trust the Way and Morality. This is the root of your shallow faith. It is one thing not to believe, but to come before me and slander the Master as one who molests thee—this is grievous sin indeed!” Madam Sun replied: “Do you mean I lie?” Dan Yang said: “If this be true, next time have him in thy chamber when I come to witness it with mine own eyes, then will I believe you.” Madam Sun was silent, perplexed. Returning to her chamber, she pondered: “If he no longer comes to my room, my lord will deem my words false. If he comes again, I shall lock him in, so he may be seen, and so relieve my grievance, and make my lord believe me.”

Days passed, and Chongyang came to her chamber again. Madam Sun hastily took a lock and fastened the door, then called to Dan Yang: “Lord, come quickly! Today I have locked the Daoist in the chamber.” Dan Yang hurried with her to the door, which she unlocked. Entering, Dan Yang looked all about, but found no sign. He asked Madam Sun: “Where is the Master?” She searched the room, on and under the bed, all corners, but no trace was found. Bewildered, she seemed as one dazed or drunk. Dan Yang said: “You said you locked the Master in the chamber; where now? Such lies and nonsense! If you find the Master in the room, well and good; if not, I will surely punish you so you dare not lie or harm another next time!” Madam Sun, ashamed, lowered her eyes and wept: “Did I see a ghost by day? If not a ghost, the room was empty; I locked the door and called you to see—did I not bring disaster upon myself?”

Dan Yang considered, and hastened to the flower hall, where he found the Master sitting with eyes closed and curtain drawn. Returning to Madam Sun, he said: “You have wronged yourself. I spoke with the Master, who said: ‘When the Great Way is perfected, the yang spirit appears. Outside the body there is another body, responding to circumstances, with powers unfathomable. Entering metal and stone without hindrance, treading sun and moon without shadow. Able to ride cranes and mount phoenixes, able to harness light and soar through space.’ Just now in your chamber it was the Master’s spirit manifesting to test your true heart. A few days ago, the Master composed a poem on the hibiscus, whose meaning contained his intent to test you.”

Madam Sun, hearing Dan Yang’s words, as if awakening from a dream, said: “If the Master’s poem contains such meaning, why did my lord not say so sooner?” She went with Dan Yang to the chamber and took out the poem. Seeing it, her heart was enlightened. She said to Dan Yang: “This poem, using the hibiscus as a symbol, contains its meaning clearly. Though the hibiscus is fair and beautiful, it cannot escape the pain of the tree’s aging and flowers falling. I am nearly fifty years old, my qi and blood declining; if I do not hasten to cultivate, in the future I shall surely fall into bitter distress. Who would have thought the Master’s spirit would come several times to my chamber to test my heart? Fortunately, I held no resentment; though some words offended, I bore no ill will. I trust the Master will not blame me. Pray inform my lord of my heart’s intent, and ask him to instruct me in the Way, that I may find the human path and the road to truth.” Dan Yang said: “Fortunate indeed that at the time of the Master’s test you bore no resentment; had you spoken roughly, he would not have accepted you. Yet the Master’s spirit test, though harsh in words, was not blameworthy. I shall now report to the Master and await his judgment.”

He went to the flower hall, where the Master and Changzhen were discussing the Way. Dan Yang approached and bowed: “I have just received great favour from the Master to enlighten Madam Sun. If she has been ignorant and spoken offensively, I beg the Master to pardon her.” Changzhen said: “Where is Senior Brother Ma? I see the Master sitting here, never going out; how could he have come to enlighten Senior Sister Sun?” Dan Yang: “That is not for you to know.” Chongyang heard but feigned ignorance. Dan Yang said: “My wife, Madam Sun, having seen the Master’s spirit manifestations, is greatly ashamed and wishes to come before the Master to seek liberation. I do not know how the Master will respond and pray for guidance.” Chongyang said: “Since Madam Sun is awakened, bring her here; I shall speak with her.”

Dan Yang obeyed and summoned Madam Sun. Before the Master she prostrated herself: “I, a disciple with mortal eyes, cannot discern the descent of a celestial immortal. I pray forgiveness for my blindness. I humbly beg the great kindness to accept me, and grant me a thread of true opportunity, to open the path of enlightenment in my life. Should I receive the Master’s great compassion and Heaven’s mercy, that I may cultivate to immortality, never forgetting my Master’s grace.” Chongyang said: “The Great Way perfected is not only immortality but may leap beyond Heaven beyond Heaven. Yet thou art near fifty, and still thy appearance is fair; I fear thy heart in the Way is not firm, and may harm thy companions. Moreover, with qi and blood declining, returning the elixir will not be easy. Thou shouldst store much merit, seeking chiefly the cause and effect of future life, to be reborn as a male, not forgetting past causes. When Dan Yang attains the Way, I shall command him to come to aid thee; cultivate the fruit of the Way, and thou mayst enter the ranks of immortals.”

Madam Sun heard the Master’s words: in this life she could not attain the Way; she must await rebirth as a man, and Dan Yang’s attainment, before she could be saved. She pondered that the cycle of birth and death was fixed, and merits and retributions just; now having seen her past errors and met a true Master, still she could not be saved, and who knew if she might awaken in the next life? If she failed to awaken, would she not fall forever into perdition? She had heard that all creatures could attain essence and fruit; how much more, having now the human form, should she not? But the Master, seeing her fair appearance, feared her heart was unstable and might harm her companions. Thus she resolved with a firm and courageous heart; taking leave of the Master, she returned to her chamber. Taking an iron lamp bowl, she sealed it with a fire bell, filling it with oil and setting it to boil on the stove. Closing eyes and mouth, she dashed the oil upon her face. The burning blistered her skin, which she then wiped clean. Looking into a mirror, she saw her visage like a painted face in the theatre. She went to the flower hall.

Dan Yang, seeing this, was greatly alarmed and could barely restrain his tears. Changzhen saw it and sighed: “Where in the world is there such a woman? Such resolve—how can she fail to attain the Great Way? Rare indeed in all antiquity; truly hard to find!” Madam Sun knelt before the Master: “My appearance is thus; may I cultivate my person?” Chongyang looked and was greatly amazed: “Since thou hast such aspiration, fear not the failure of the Great Way! Truly rare in the world! Such firm resolve may be called a man among women. I shall name thee Bu’er, and strengthen thy resolve.” He then composed a poem in praise:

Envious of the worthy whose past ties meet,  
Today she sits in the lotus-gathering boat.  
Losing visage and body to seek the true Way,  
With firm resolve and steadfast heart refining lead and mercury.  
Like Ma Gu descending to Earth,  
Like a wondrous form alighting from Jade Heaven.  
When work and fruit are complete the decree arrives,  
She may be reckoned the foremost immortal among women.

Chongyang said to Bu’er: “Though thou hast true resolve to cultivate, thou must not cling, lest demonic troubles arise. Thou art near fifty, and hast borne children; true essence is deficient. The work of cultivation has no fixed limits; thou must set a persevering heart from beginning to end, ever watchful and vigilant. Fortune favours thy past seed and the innate has not yet been utterly broken; thou mayst yet refine the returning elixir. If the heavenly essence be exhausted and qi and blood spent, though the thought be of the Way, attaining it will be difficult. Women’s heavenly essence descends at fourteen, and by forty-nine the hexagrams are broken and essence cut off. That thou hast not yet lost it shows thy innate not yet destroyed, and the wealth and peace in thy house. Men in cultivation first descend the White Tiger; women first sever the Red Dragon. Once the Red Dragon is cut, the foundation of the elixir is laid. For men to descend the White Tiger is not easy; for women to cut the Red Dragon is yet harder. To sever the Red Dragon, desire must be removed. When desire is removed, the original spirit is fixed. With spirit fixed and mind clear, primal qi rises again; gathering and refining it fills the five viscera, intertwining the five qi, forming the embryo. When the spirit embryo is complete, it enters and exits the dark and light realms. Thereafter nourished and refined, ascending to the Three Pure Ones. I now transmit to thee the Celestial Talisman’s Spiritual Record and the Taiyin Secret of Form Refinement; diligently cultivate and refine. With Dan Yang seek to exhaust the wondrous meaning. Ye shall all change guise and form, and may call one another Senior Brother and Junior Brother alike; naturally the Way will be attained. But be cautious and keep true; do not waste days and months, nor fritter away time. Life is brief, swift and uncertain; be wary, be cautious!” Bu’er bowed twice and rose, then bowed to Dan Yang and Changzhen; they returned the salute, and Bu’er withdrew.

Days passed. Bu’er and Dan Yang conferred: “Now that we have received the Master’s transmission of the wondrous meaning, we must begin the work. But the household affairs are not yet settled. I think if the Master remains at my house, with visitors coming and going, there can be no quiet; moreover, with Senior and Junior Brothers entering and leaving, inconveniences arise. Might you consult the Master about building a separate temple, where the Master and Wayfarers alike may dwell in peace? What say you?” Dan Yang answered: “Thy words accord with my thought; it must be so for peace.” Dan Yang then went to the flower hall and related Bu’er’s plan to the Master. Chongyang said: “Your words please me well. But you must choose a quiet place, spend several thousand silver taels, and build a fine temple. Should more Wayfarers come later, it will also be needed.”

Dan Yang obeyed, selecting a most excellent site about two li from the house. They fixed the day and began work; within two months it was complete. Over eighty rooms were built, at a cost exceeding ten thousand taels of silver. They invited the Master to name the temple; Chongyang said: “Since this temple is built for the dwelling of the Quanzhen Wayfarers, it shall be named Quanzhen Hermitage.” Thus the Master and disciples rejoiced, and chose a day to move in.

Chongyang and Changzhen entered to reside at Quanzhen Hermitage. Dan Yang entrusted household affairs to Ziting Zhen; the couple devoted themselves to the Way. Chongyang imparted to Dan Yang five treatises of the Golden Elixir Secret, along with the formulas. Dan Yang, having mastered the formulas, changed his guise and image, binding his hair in three coils to show his eternal remembrance of the Master’s kindness. Day by day he and Bu’er cultivated and penetrated the profound meaning, diligently refining. By day he managed affairs at Quanzhen Hermitage; by night he returned home to nurture quietude. Truly:

The Great Way knows no difference 'twixt man and woman,  
All depends on the mind and foundation laid.  
With past ties sown, awakening in this life,  
Turn quickly, lest delay be too late.

If thou wouldst know what thereafter befell Dan Yang and Bu’er,  
Attend the next chapter’s unfolding tale.
