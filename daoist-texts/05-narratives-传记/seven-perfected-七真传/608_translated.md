# Chapter IX: Wang Chongyang Establishes Teaching and Practices the Way and Virtue; Sun Bu’er Feigns Madness to Learn the Immortals

A Poem:

With single heart intent on crossing the Seven Golden Lotuses,  
The orthodox teaching unfolds and manifests the natural body.  
From mouth to mouth is passed the supreme Way,  
Connecting to the worthies who come after.  
The great Tao lies clearly before our eyes;  
Seek not the former heaven in the gate of non-action.  
Within the crescent furnace seize the jade spirit,  
Refine the true lead.  
(From the tune "Washing Stream Sands")

It is told that Wang Xiaoxian arrived at the mountain gate of the Quanzhen Hermitage, and saw on either side a couplet engraved:

Seeing through earthly passions, desiring to ascend the nine-rank Lotus platform,  
Come to our gate to seek the path of enlightenment;  
Realizing the emptiness of worldly affairs, to avoid the sufferings of the Three Paths,  
One must come here to ask the ferry across confusion.

Xiaoxian thought to himself: "This couplet truly expresses the sincere truth for delivering men." Presently a Daoist priest came forth from within, his hair bound in three topknots, three strands of long beard, his bearing extraordinary, his spirit lofty.

Meanwhile Ma Danyang, since his master’s journey southward, during the day came to the hermitage to attend to affairs, at night returning home to cultivate the profound arts with Bu’er. Now, just as he was about to leave for home, he walked out the gate and saw a guest arriving, about thirty years of age, of heavenly mien and jade-like bones, with refined and surpassing bearing. He advanced and asked: "Sir, from which honored place do you come? What brings you to this humble hermitage?" Xiaoxian hastened to salute and replied, "I am from Wendeng County, surnamed Wang, named Xiaoxian. I have long heard that in this precious hermitage dwells Master Chongyang, a man of the Way. By my mother’s command I have come specially to visit the Master, humbly beseeching his instruction. May I ask the Master’s immortal surname and dharma name?" Danyang said, "I am a poor Daoist, surnamed Ma, styled Danyang. Hearing your words, a person from afar coming specially to seek the Way is indeed rare! Pray enter the hermitage. Yet my master has journeyed south and his return is uncertain; for the present rest here a few days, then we shall consult further." So he led the guest into the hall, ordering the steward to arrange lodging for Master Wang. Danyang then returned home. (No more to tell here.)

The next day at noon, word came that the Master had returned to the hermitage. All hurriedly donned their robes and caps, and went out to greet him. A large crowd pressed about the Master, men and women encircling him, countless in number. Whence came these people? It was because the Venerable Chongyang was expounding the teaching and delivering men at this hermitage, his fame vast, heard far and wide. All the good and virtuous throughout the four quarters came to take refuge under his banner. Hearing the Master had returned from the south, all who met him came forth to welcome him. Danyang and others advanced to pay respects, conducted the Master inside, and then with the elders Zhen and others made their salutes, reporting the hardships of the journey.

Danyang led Wang Xiaoxian forward to pay respects to the Master, and related Xiaoxian’s circumstances. Chongyang said: "Since you have true heart towards the Way, desiring to enter our gate, you must first make a great vow. As the ancients say: No practitioner of the Way succeeds without establishing a vow, and no vow is fulfilled without a practitioner." Hearing this, Xiaoxian swore an oath to Heaven: "I, Wang Xiaoxian, devote myself to the Master and take refuge in the Way. Should I violate the Master, turn my back on the Way, break precepts or rules, and thereby suffer a cruel death or fall into Hell, never to emerge, may Heaven so punish me." Chongyang, seeing the earnestness of the vow, said to Xiaoxian: "I now change your name to Chuyuan, styled Tongjing, you shall be called Yuyang." Then he commanded Liu Dade to come forward to pay respects to the senior brothers, and further said: "I change your dharma name to Chuxuan, styled Tongmiao, and grant you the title Changsheng. You two may choose an auspicious day to change your clothes and wear your hair in the topknot." Liu and Wang bowed to the Master, then to the senior brothers and fellow disciples, and returned to their chambers, single-hearted in cultivation. (No more to tell here.)

It is told that after returning to Quanzhen Hermitage, Chongyang recalled his Master’s words and vowed to universally transform the Three Continents, all to gather at the Five Assemblies. The Five Assemblies are: first, Equality; second, Golden Lotus; third, Jade Splendour; fourth, Three Lights; fifth, Seven Treasures. He therefore set up a placard, suspending it wherever he went, with these words:

I hold that Equality is the ancestor of Way and Virtue, the source of purity; it is the root of Golden Lotus and Jade Splendour, the origin of Three Lights and Seven Treasures. It universally aids all living beings, illuminating the secular world throughout. Silver flames fill the eight poles; coloured clouds steam the ten directions. Each man wishes to spit forth the yellow sprout, and everywhere avoids the black path.  
Jade Splendour is the ancestor of the spirits; Golden Lotus is the root of the energies. When spirit and energy combine, that is called the divine immortal; if the heart forgets thoughts and cares, it transcends the desire realm; if the heart forgets the attachment to circumstances, it transcends the form realm; if the heart does not cling to emptiness, it transcends the formless realm. Departing from these three realms, the spirit dwells in the domain of immortals and sages; its nature is in the realm of pure emptiness. May all men attain this, each and every one enter this realm.

A venerable wanderer seeing this placard sighed and said: "The vow is vast and deep, truly worthy to be called the reincarnation of Master Wang Sheng."

In the summer of the Xinmao year, the dynasty changed its era-name to Qianyou. The Court Gentleman Fan Chengda returned from Jin, learning that Emperor Qinzong had perished under the Jin.  
In the Renchen year, Yu Yunwen was appointed Left Chancellor. In the twelfth month of winter, Zhu Peng completed the "Outline and Details of the Comprehensive Mirror for Aid in Government", clarifying rites and righteousness, carefully scholarly, but did not mention the affairs of the two schools, Buddhism and Taoism, for fear of disturbing the minds of ruler and subjects. At that time, Master Lü saw that the Song Emperor was reverent towards Heaven, diligent for the people, and fond of the Way; therefore he delighted in journeying widely to propagate the teaching: passing Huating, he used elixir to revive the camphor tree; touring Jiangling, he discoursed on restraining Fu Sheng. The Minister of Rites Wang Lun guarded Yuezhou; a recluse called Hui came to visit, saying: "Sir, you are a mad monk of Jingzhou, named Xie, who has been reborn many times to serve you." Lun was astonished and said: "To know the causes of many past lives, you must be an immortal." He wished to speak further, but Hui suddenly vanished. Lun then feigned illness and retired home, devoting thought to the Way of Immortals. Later he encountered Immortal Liu who taught him the method of elixir and the secret to the corpse’s release; later he passed away by corpse release. The Minister Liu Hong recommended Zhu Xi as compiler at the Privy Council, but he did not come. The Song Emperor praised his incorrupt retreat, ordering him to oversee the Chongdao Temple at Taizhou. Zhu Xi heard that Zhang Pingshu had attained the Way and at Chongdao Temple had soared in transcendence, inspiring great admiration. Pingshu in youth studied alongside Xiang Chuan Weng, but failed the imperial examination; now he was eminent. Zhu Xi sighed and said: "The eminent sink into the sea of suffering; the unsuccessful attain the Way and ascend. Earthly wealth and honour cannot compare with the path of immortals." At that time there was Sun Baoguang, styled Yuanming, deeply versed in the learning of nature and life; during the Yuanfeng era he met Guang Mengzi who taught him the secret of returning elixir; he styled himself Wumingzi. Wandering in Yingtian Prefecture, he made his living by planting vegetables and styled himself the Old Gardener of Shangqiu. He selected disciples and delivered them across.

In the spring of the Jiawu year, the Song changed its era-name to Chunxi. Yu Yunwen died. The King of Annan Li Tianxiang passed away; his son Longhan succeeded him and reported the mourning to the Song Emperor, who sent envoys to confer the title. Zhu Xi was summoned as secretary but did not come. He was transferred to supervise the Chongyou Temple on Wuyi Mountain, and again commanded to oversee the Nankang army, lecturing with scholars. That autumn the Song Emperor made Xie Guifei his Empress.

In the Dingyou year, the calendar was changed to Chunxi. Chongyang saw the Song Emperor enfeoff the Empress and enact the calendar, revering sages and loving scholars, fulfilling the way of sovereign, yet dwelling in the land of gold, he felt unease. At this time a gathering of Daoist followers assembled to discuss scriptures and debate the Way; the Daoist and lay alike gathered.

One day in the lecture hall, Chongyang broadly explained: "Since you have entered my gate to cultivate body and learn the Way, you must first refine your nature then cultivate your life. Nature belongs originally to wood; when pierced it gives rise to smoke and fire. Fire is the heart; the original nature is fixed and tranquil, and the heart fire thus extinguishes itself. Therefore the 'Yinfu Jing' says: Fire is born of wood, calamity arises and must be quelled; treachery arises in the state, when the time moves it must collapse. To know this and cultivate accordingly is called sagehood. Hence those who cultivate the Way first refine the nameless primal fire, ruling the heart by the heart, extinguishing all greed, ignorance, jealousy, harm to others for self benefit, arrogance, hardness, violence, and all manner of evil hearts; then they sweep away past, future, and present hearts, purify the human heart completely, and the Way heart naturally manifests. The Way heart is the essential spirit of the void and stillness beyond time, awakened and illuminating from the heart, refined until perfectly bright and clear, allowing no speck of dust of the heart to disturb it. Encountering circumstances, no smoke or fire arises; purely and purely, allowing empty space to shatter, my nature remains serene and alone. When the nature work is complete, the elixir base is firm. If the nature base is not solid, though the great Way might be formed, it also may be ruined. To cultivate the great Way demands cultivation of both nature and life, passing from form to formless, using the formless to control form. Thus the one who penetrates the spirit is the spirit; the one who attains long life is the energy; without nurturing the original spirit, one cannot penetrate spirit and effect transformation; without subduing the original energy, one cannot attain long life and prolong years. So it is said: Life is not separate from nature, life without nature cannot stand; nature is not separate from life, nature without life cannot exist. Nourish spirit with energy, embrace energy with spirit; naturally metal and wood unite, water and fire are complete, forming the embryonic cell, called the Golden Elixir, also named the Mysterious Governor. Further, by the copulation of Heaven and Earth, the fetal immortal is formed, nurtured for three years, like nursing an infant; after nine years settled and complete, like mastering the entire curriculum. Then entering and exiting without hindrance, transformations and marvels—all are but seeking within oneself."

At that time Sun Bu’er received the Master’s transmission, diligently cultivating without remiss, breaking down barriers for seven years, returning through the three fields, all the hundred orifices flowing freely; he styled himself the Quiet and Detached Man. He listened within to the lectures, came forward to bow. Chongyang descended from his seat, summoned Bu’er to the elixir chamber, and further taught the Way of Golden Liquid Returning Elixir, the nurturing of the embryo and emergence of spirit, the method of soaring and riding cranes. All was transmitted one by one. Then he instructed: "Your affinity lies in the lands around Luoyang in Henan. You may go there feigning madness to temper yourself: by day beg alms in the markets, by night lodge in broken kilns, refining body and mind. When your Way is complete, you will naturally transcend body and spirit. Then you may accumulate功 and merits; at that season I shall come to lead you to worship at the Golden Palace, and you may enter the Western Pool." Bu’er thanked the Master, saying, "If I attain the Way, I shall never forget the Master’s grace." Then he took leave of Danyang, relating the Master's transmission and his mission to go to Luoyang. He took leave of the senior brothers and friends, returned home, and arranged to set out the next day. That evening Danyang returned home, giving many instructions.

At dawn, after breakfast, Bu’er unbound his hair, rubbed dust upon his face, changed into a tattered robe with ragged sleeves, and feigned the appearance of a madman. In hand he carried a broken cattail fan, a torn hemp kerchief hung over his shoulder, and he carried a gourd ladle. Laughing loudly, he bowed to Danyang with folded hands and said: "Farewell! If fate allows, we shall meet again." Then he ran out. Danyang, seeing this, wept tears. The whole family of Tingzhen and Tingrui came rushing out, seeing this appearance, each burst into loud cries. Tinggui and others asked: "Why has mother suddenly gone mad to this extent? Where is she going?" Danyang said: "Your mother now follows the Master’s command to go to Luoyang to temper body and mind. But the matter of Way cultivation is not for you to know, nor should you worry about her. You should go about your own affairs."

At that time a group of Daoist friends from Quanzhen Hermitage came to bid farewell. Danyang said: "Bu’er has already gone." The Ma family, in tears, each bid him farewell. (No more to tell here.) Danyang and the Daoist friends praised Bu’er’s resolute heart on the Way, each sighing, then returned to the hermitage.

It is told that Sun Bu’er feigned madness and begged along the road for alms. After more than two months he reached the borders of Luoyang. He sought out Henan Prefecture, and beyond the city, behind Yunxi Temple, was a broken kiln, where he took up residence. By day he begged alms in the city, by night he lodged in the broken kiln to cultivate himself. Before long, a mad woman often came to keep him company. Whence did this mad woman come? It was Immortal Gengxian, who had attained the Way of Magu, cultivated to truth, manifesting in form, guiding later learners. Seeing Sun Bu’er’s resolute heart on the Way, and fearing he might encounter misfortune, she often accompanied him in the kiln. Bu’er thought secretly: "I am a false madman here refining myself. There is a true madwoman to accompany me; truly rare."

After several days, one day Bu’er went into town to seek alms and met two proselytizers. Seeing Bu’er though mad, yet not old, with the bearing of a wealthy man, fair and plump, likeable, they conferred: "This mad woman lodges nightly at Yunxi Temple kiln. If we go to the kiln and lodge with her, would not we be benefited for life?" United in purpose, that night they went to the kiln, laid down their belongings, and began to stir lustful thoughts. They lit a fire to illuminate the mad woman and saw Bu’er sitting in meditation, beside him an old woman sleeping. They said: "This mad woman still speaks of cultivation and sits in meditation here." They were about to advance, when Bu’er, steadying his spirit, heard voices; opening his eyes, he saw the two proselytizers approaching. Knowing their ill intent, he quickly rose and dodged behind the old madwoman. The two proselytizers shone their fire upon them and rushed forward. The mad woman rose and said: "This is our immortal’s cave; what manner of persons come here to walk about?" She stood and seized the two proselytizers, beating them until their heads were broken and eyes bruised. They sought to flee but could not move. Fighting desperately, the mad woman pointed at them, and their own companions pulled them back and beat them. The two were beaten out from the kiln, fighting until the gates of Yunxi Temple, crying out loudly. The Daoists within the temple heard and opened the gate. Seeing the two proselytizers bleeding and bruised, the Daoists persuaded them apart. The two regained composure and saw that they had been beaten by their own companions all night, their bodies sore and bleeding. The Daoists asked: "For what cause have you fought to such a state?" The two had no words and only wept. The Daoists closed the gate and departed.

The two proselytizers dared not return to the kiln and conferred: "We know not what magic this old madwoman possesses to bring us to such a state. First she said: ‘This is our immortal’s cave,’ forbidding us lodging. That might be tolerated; but she beat us so that our whole bodies bleed and ache intolerably." They had no choice but to sleep outside the mountain gate that night. At dawn they returned to the city.

Meanwhile Bu’er saw the two proselytizers crying out and being driven away. He thought: "This madman wished to harm me. If this old madwoman had not driven him off, would I not have suffered a great loss? Truly the heavenly spirits protect me; such a marvel! I will pray to the void in thanks." Bu’er knelt and kowtowed; the old madwoman laughed heartily and departed. (No more to tell here.)

It is told that after the two proselytizers were driven off by the madwoman, after a few days, having healed their bodies, they conferred: "This young madwoman is indeed a fish in our net, a bird in our cage; surely we can capture her. Only the old madwoman fears her somewhat." One said: "I have a plan. The madwoman begs alms daily around the northeast gate; I and you will go to a desolate village where no one treads to lie in wait, and surely she will find no wings with which to fly." The two agreed and went to the desolate village to keep watch. From afar they saw the madwoman coming, and rejoiced.

But Immortal Geng had already foreseen Sun Bu’er’s danger and secretly sent the mountain gods and earth spirits to protect her. When Bu’er had walked to the wilderness, looking up she saw the two proselytizers hastening towards her. Knowing their ill intent, she fled quickly. Yet as Bu’er was a woman, and a scion of a wealthy family, she could not run far, and was driven to close company by the two. With no way to resist, Bu’er thought: "My life is ended." Just as the two were about to lay hands on her, suddenly a great wind arose, flying sand and stones, knocking the two proselytizers to the ground, breaking holes in their heads, blood flowing upon the earth. Seeing the great wind, Bu’er hastened back to the kiln. Truly it was:

The upright heart is ever guarded by immortals;  
A thousand demons hence self-vanish.  
Free and untroubled, body unhindered;  
At last I trust the profound功 is abundant.
