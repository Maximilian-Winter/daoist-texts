# Chapter Twelve: Qiu Fu and Yang Pan Crossing the Stream in Endurance of Hardship; Sun Bu'er and the Three Wells Manifest the Spirit

Preface:

Two friends separate ways, each attending to their former causes. For six years Pan Gu endures hardships. Battling and repelling the sleep-demons, the spirits tire not, but diligently cultivate themselves. When the fruit is full, they depart the red dust, a body beyond the body. Mounting the phoenix and riding the crane, they pay homage at the Maple Palace. Feigning madness to cultivate, men find them hard to recognize; broadly they guide across the bewildering ford. (Right tune: "Lang Tao Sha")

The narrative proceeds: That Zhang the Second Elder returned home and reported to his mother, who said, "These two must surely be great practitioners, protected by hidden spirits, and so they come in dreams to you and me. Old man, take this bowl of noodles and deliver it to them to eat. I see that the snow has not yet melted in these days; why not invite them to our home, wait until the sky clears and the snow is gone, then permit them to depart? Would not that bring us both some blessing?" Zhang the Second Elder heard his mother's words and took up the bowl of noodles, delivering it to the temple, calling out, "Two Perfected Ones, please accept this meal."

Fu Yang, hearing someone call out for a meal, hurriedly sat up and looked: there stood an old man holding a bowl of noodles beside him. He called to his senior brother. Dan Yang, in the midst of steadying his spirit, heard voices and opened his eyes: it was the old man bringing the meal. The two hastily rose and bowed. The two elders placed down the bowl and bowed deeply themselves. When the two had finished bowing, the elder said: "These days, the heavens have sent down such great snow, causing hardship to the two Perfected Ones. The poor old man has no fine offerings; early this morning my mother made some noodle soup, which is presented to you to keep out the cold." Dan Yang said: "Our blessings and roots are shallow; how can we accept the offerings of an elder patron? We dwell in the temple; how could kind people know of us?" Zhang the Second Elder then related in detail the dream he had the previous night. Dan Yang said: "We truly have no blessing to enjoy this. Now that we are pitied by kind people, we reluctantly accept it." The two ate the noodles.

Zhang the Second Elder said: "Two Perfected Ones, being in this temple, I see your garments are plain and your bodies cold; come to my humble home and rest a few days. When the sky clears and the snow disappears, then you may consider your affairs." Dan Yang said: "Having received the kindness of a meal today, I cannot repay such grace, and dare not accept more." The Elder said: "You Perfected Ones need not be so modest. In my poor home there is only my mother; there are neither old nor young besides us. Moreover, we two have always loved monks and Taoists. Though poor, we can support you two. Whether it be for a few days or a month, it can be borne. Come to my home; it will be warmer than this temple, and I need not deliver meals; would not that be two conveniences?" Hearing the kind words, the two had no choice but to go with him. The mother at home was already anxiously awaiting; seeing the two Taoists come with the elder, she was overjoyed, and prepared the kang (heated bed) for their rest. Three meals a day, tea and rice, they were served diligently, from beginning to end alike.

After resting five days, seeing the snow was melting, they prepared to take leave and depart. The two elders would not permit it, and after pressing them, three more days passed. Dan Yang, seeing the elder to be of fine character, taught him the arts of guiding and nourishing life, and then bade farewell and went out the door. The elder wished to detain them and made some steamed cakes for them to take, but the two refused with difficulty. Zhang the Second Elder escorted them two li from the village before returning home. The elder and his wife practiced the Way together and both lived beyond a hundred years, passing away peacefully without illness. This is a later matter, not to be told here.

Meanwhile, Dan Yang and Fu Yang parted from Zhang the Elder on the road. Dan Yang asked: "Junior Brother Qiu, we have endured cold and hunger in this temple for three days, and yet a spirit came to his home to send a dream. This is strange indeed. Do you perhaps have some deluded thought?" Fu Yang replied: "I will not hide from you, senior brother. In the temple, starving and freezing for three days, my heart was truly unbearable. I formed a deluded thought: to pray that tomorrow someone might bring some noodle soup for me to eat, so as to relieve hunger and cold. Yet who knew that spirits secretly took note and went to the Zhang household to send the dream? I myself hardly believed it." Dan Yang was angry: "I have before warned you, one who cultivates the Way must not entertain a deluded thought. You now have such a thought, shaking the void and the spirits, causing them to send dreams. Yet we have made no inch of progress day by day, and receive such offerings; what blessing have we to bear it? If I were to act as you do, I might become like a beast of burden, repaying debts as an ox or horse. It is better we part ways. I shall return to Shandong to cultivate; as for you, take whichever road of heaven or hell you will, and follow your heart."

Fu Yang, hearing Dan Yang’s words, felt as if pierced by a knife; tears streamed down his face. Kneeling before Dan Yang, he wept bitterly, saying: "Since I came to the Quanzhen Monastery to seek a master, through your recommendation I was admitted; for more than twenty years I have followed the master, enduring many trials of the demons, yet have never received a single word of instruction. Suddenly the master passed into immortality. Now, by your mercy, senior brother, you guide me on the path of True Cultivation; I have but just heard of the Great Way’s subtlety, an unrepayable grace. In the temple, from cold and hunger unbearable, I formed a deluded thought; I beg you, brother, to open your heart and pardon my sins. I will not dare again." Dan Yang said: "Your karmic roots are deep and heavy; you cannot avoid demonic trials. The master, when manifesting the alms, said though you have true intention and cultivation, great demons are hard to escape; Changsheng said you will starve to death hereafter. Since you came with me, I have given many admonitions which you have wholly disregarded. Now I must summon my spirit to leave this body and return to Shandong. If you have true will to cultivate, when the Way's fruit is fulfilled, we shall meet again. But if your heart is not firm, after this parting you shall never see me again." Having said this, he took from his side a small paper-cutting knife, split the meditation mat in two, taking half and turning toward Shandong. Fu Yang beseeched bitterly but said no word, and drifted away.

After Dan Yang departed, Fu Yang sat by the roadside weeping half a day before ceasing. He thought: "My senior brother says I have no will and so parts from me. My Liu senior brother once said my face bears the sign of a soaring serpent locking the mouth, and I will surely starve to death. Now here I kneel on the earth, burn incense, and mourn to Heaven, Earth, Sun, Moon, and the void spirits, making a solemn vow and leaving fate to Heaven." He knelt on both knees and set a great vow, with this poem as witness:

> Forgetting wine and women, wealth and breath removed,  
> Ignorance rising falls into the three paths below.  
> Secretly hoarding grain, heart and liver torn apart,  
> Silently amassing silver, body withers to bone.  
> Selfish gain harms others, struck by thunderbolt,  
> Defying master and the Way, smitten by Heaven's punishment.  
> If I now do not sincerely guard,  
> Endless cycles as horse and ass shall be mine.

Having sworn, he bowed to the void several times, then rose and set out for Chang’an.

Meanwhile, the venerable Master Lü Chunyang passed over Huazhou in the clouds, seeing that Chǔjī (Qiu Chuji) had a great and profound vow, fearing for his life, sent a protective spirit attendant to accompany him so that later he might perfect the fruit of the Way. From then on, Qiu Chuji was ever in the Way, mindful at every moment. Whenever hardship arose, heavenly spirits came to his aid.

Fu Yang arrived in Chang’an city and dwelt for several days. Weary of its bustle, he ascended to Zhongnan Mountain and found an ancient temple, where he sat in meditation. That night great snow fell, continuing for five days without cease. Fu Yang thought: "Changsheng said I am to starve to death; now I see the time of death draw near. I have heard Dan Yang say: Though men die, holding to the Way they perish; preserving spirit and qi, their nature is not obscured; in the next life they also have the heart to seek the Way. Now I concentrate spirit and guard breath; I merely wait."

Meanwhile, the protective spirit ordered the temple’s earth god to bring some steamed cakes that night. At dawn, the earth god took human form, holding the cakes before Fu Yang, saying: "Perfected One, please accept this meal." Fu Yang was concentrating on spirit and breath, when suddenly he heard someone call; opening his eyes, he saw an old man holding cakes, standing before him. He asked: "Old good man, seeing such weather, great snow falling, why do you come to this temple?" The earth god said: "My home is near this village. But last night I had a dream that this temple shelters a Perfected One freezing and starving, so I specially brought some cakes to relieve the hunger." Having spoken, he placed the cakes before Chǔjī and turned to leave. Fu Yang wished to ask his name, but the earth god suddenly vanished from the temple. Going out to the temple gate, he saw no trace. Looking carefully, not even a footstep in the snow remained. Returning to the temple, he thought: "This old man must indeed be a transformation of the temple’s earth god." He ate some cakes, thinking: "As I near the time of starvation, a spirit visibly manifests to send food; could it be that my lifespan is not yet ended, and I am not yet to die?"

Two more days passed, and seeing the sky clear and snow melt, he descended the mountain and went westward. Arriving at the border of Baoji county, at the foot of the southern mountain, there was a great stream named Pan Creek, more than ten zhang broad. This was the main road to Chang’an, but when the waters rose, the current was fierce and no bridge could be made; when the water receded, it was less than a chi deep, and rafts could not be used. Travelers all came to this place and had to cross barefoot. Fu Yang thought: "My roots are shallow in this life; how can I attain the Way? I will ferry people across Pan Creek, accumulating merit to cultivate future roots." Resolute in this plan, when he saw a person coming, he called out: "Do not take off your feet; I will carry you across." From then on, regardless of age or sex, he always carried them on his back.

Beside the creek was an ancient temple. By day Fu Yang ferried people; by night he sat in meditation at the temple. Nearby, kind people brought grain to fill his hunger. In the bitter cold of winter, he labored without complaint. When great waters flooded, he rested quietly in the temple. At night, though faint and dreaming, he hung on a tree and sat, intending to repel the sleep demons. When he fell asleep and tumbled to the ground, he suffered no injury, for a spirit secretly guarded him. When great rain and snow blocked the way and he was near death from hunger, help would naturally come. Thus he diligently cultivated without slackening; in dying and reviving he knew no fear. In the spring of the second year, once crossing the creek carrying someone, he was swept away by the flood and floated over twenty li; the Dragon King appeared to save him, and he returned alive. He was thenceforth more vigorous and diligent, cultivating without pause.

Meanwhile, Ma Dan Yang parted from Chǔjī and returned to Ninghai in Shandong, again dwelling in the Quanzhen Monastery to cultivate the Way. At that time he accepted disciples with predestined roots: Li Dacheng of Shenyang, Zhao Penglai of Laizhou, Han Qingnan of Jiangnan, Song Piyun of Haizhou, and others; all were taught the Way. Dan Yang relied on Song, Li, Zhao, and Han to guard his stillness for three years, at last able to transcend the body and spirit. He reflected that immortality never leaves the mountain: though the spirit transformation is formless and surpasses heavenly gates, one finally returns to the blessed land of grottoes and heavens, the ten continents and three isles. He casually composed twenty characters of verse for the Mountain Sect:

> From the origin comes true intent,  
> Pure longevity achieves the immortal elixir.  
> Loyalty and tranquility attain rites and righteousness,  
> Clearly and thoroughly seeing the Court of Heaven.

By this sect and his writings — the "Gold and Jade," "Gradual Awakening," "Subtlety," "Ten Directions," "Three Treasures," "Records of Sayings," and others — his teaching was transmitted to later generations.

At this time Ma Dan Yang was seventy-one years old. In the fourth year of Shaoxi of Song Emperor Guangzong, that is the fourth year of Mingchang of Jin Emperor Zhangzong, on the first day of the first month of the Gui-Chou year, he suddenly told his Taoist friends: "On the fourth day of this month, Sun Bu’er will return to Truth; I too must go now." The crowd begged him to stay, to remain in the world for several years more, guiding later students along the True Cultivation path. Dan Yang said: "From this time on, Wang Yuyang will transform Yushan, Hao Taigu will propagate the sect at Mount Hua, Tan Changzhen will extend teachings in the South, Qiu Chuji will spread them over the great earth, Liu Changsheng will follow the mountain wind. In the future, the great propagation of the sect will arise, and those with aspiration will establish great works. The sources of the southern and northern sects will be continuous and distant; the eastern and western roads will be long. Where there is desire there is a resting place; where there is a road there is passage. Cultivate and bear the true fruit; we shall meet in time." Then he left a quatrain and passed away. The verse ran:

> Originally it is true emptiness,  
> Fundamentally the same as the Vast Void.  
> Today the beginning is finally returned,  
> Eternally dwelling in the Palace of Penglai.

The monastery quickly reported to the Ma family. Ting Zhen, with more than ten family members, came to the monastery to mourn, urgently preparing a wooden coffin and selecting a day to bury him. On the day of the funeral, Song Piyun moved the coffin, which seemed empty. The people were astonished; opening it, they found only clothing and shoes. All were joyful, knowing he had transformed and departed. The coffin and clothing were buried to express their affection. The monastery’s affairs are not further recounted here.

Meanwhile, Sun Bu’er, since departing from Wang Yuyang, had mysterious transformations, appearing and disappearing unpredictably. In Luoyang city many kind people, seeing Bu’er though mad and wild, seemed to find the Way in him; his words of fortune and misfortune all came true. Many men and women became his disciples. He left a twenty-character poem that was transmitted later, called the Sect of Purity and Tranquility. The poem reads:

> Quanzhen penetrates profound principle,  
> The Great Way attains non-action.  
> Nature united with the freed corpse,  
> This is the hundred labours.

Sun Bu’er was seventy-five years old. On the fourth day of the first month of the Gui-Chou year, he suddenly told his disciples: "The Master truly commands; I must go to the Jade Pool." The disciples begged him to stay, but Bu’er said: "The heavenly decree is fixed and cannot be contravened."

Meanwhile, Immortaless Geng often appeared to Sun Bu’er after his completion of the elixir, returning to her original form and lingering with him. Now knowing Bu’er’s achievement was full and true, she came to invite him to go with her to the Jade Pool, then later return to the mortal realm to accumulate merit. At this time Dan Yang had already arrived. Bu’er knew Dan Yang had transcended form, and said: "Now he comes to invite me, together to see the Master True." The three immortals manifested together, each mounting a white crane and soaring through the kiln roof, circling and dancing in the air. The people saw this and swiftly reported to the Prefect’s Lady. The Prefect hurriedly set up the incense altar, arranged offerings, held out gold and jade to present, and prayed toward the sky. Suddenly the three immortals each rode white cranes down from the sky, clouds swirling about, circling above the government office. Officials, soldiers, and common people all saw clearly and bowed deeply. Bu’er left a poem:

> Spirit and aspiration rise soaring through the blue heavens,  
> Holding authority in the dusty world, receiving heaven’s mysteries.  
> Foolish men do not recognize the guest of mist and clouds,  
> Ten thousand taels of gold, they grudgingly bow not.

Having chanted, the cloud cranes rose slowly and ascended to heaven. All present earnestly prayed. The Prefect inspected the site and saw three holes in the kiln, shaped like wells, naming it the Cave of Three Wells. Within were sculpted images of the three immortal sages, incense burning continuously through generations. This is not further recounted.

Meanwhile, Ma, Sun, and Geng, the three immortals, each riding white cranes, arrived together at the True Cave of Zhongnan’s extreme summit. At that time, Chongyang and Zhongzu were out traveling, only Lüzu remained in the cave. The three immortals bowed to Lüzu, who rejoiced and ordered the cloud kitchen to prepare a feast in welcome. Dan Yang related the story of himself and Bu’er’s cultivation. Lüzu said: "Your Way achievements are high, but your external merits are not broad; it is hard to respond to the summons. You must further establish great merit, await the gathering of the Seven Perfected Ones, and together go to the Jade Palace. Only those whose merits are treasured in the Heavenly Registers are honored; if merit is lacking, though the Way be lofty, it is secondary. Cultivators of the Way, like men though talented as the Northern Dipper and strong as Mount Tai, if without merit cannot receive rewards. So too for cultivators of immortality. Those with great merit, though the Way be incomplete, ultimately ascend to higher realms. Those with high Way but no merit become scattered immortals of the Peng Isles." Dan Yang and the others heard this, then bowed farewell to Lüzu and returned to the mortal realm to accumulate merit. Lüzu escorted them to the cave mouth; the three immortals took leave and mounted their cranes, departing. Truly it is:

> Without merit, the Way will not endure,  
> Without the Way, merit is no path to immortality.  
> The Way perfected with merit, spirit transformations,  
> Surely you shall step this day on Jade Heaven’s path.

To learn the later stories of the three immortals, await the next chapter’s exposition.
