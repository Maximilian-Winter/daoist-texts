# Chapter Seventeen: On the Stone Speaking of Profound Emptiness, a Flying Canopy in Midair; The Altar Rites Astonish as a Mirage on the Sea

Verse:

To cultivate the Way and seek the True Lead,  
The utmost emptiness precedes Heaven’s course, follows Earth’s deed.  
At nine and two behold the dragon’s whiskers, a mystic deep;  
With open belly, plainly told to the wise to keep.  
At noon and midnight fires roast and brew,  
Examine the former strings and latter too.  
At rabbit and cock, the east and west, bathe is due,  
Soft and gentle, the civil and martial, strong and mild, in order pursue.  
(Tune: “Southern Village Son”)

It is said that the Perfected Qiu Changchun spoke to the monk Baiyun, “I now intend to build several monastic groves; since the Chan Master has true heart to aid me, I will for the time receive it, and with you cultivate the root of the Way.” The monk, hearing the Master’s words about building the groves, went to fetch a hundred taels of gold, and said to the Master, “Disciple hears that Master wishes to build groves, which is my original wish as well. Here is another hundred taels of gold; I beg Master to take it, and seek for some repentance on my behalf.” Thus the Perfected Qiu received in all two hundred taels of gold and fifty silver taels. The monk bade two monks escort the Master down the mountain. The assembly of monks accompanied him to the mountain gate, and five li beyond, they knelt and bowed farewell; only when the Master had vanished from sight did they return. The two monks escorted him for a day, and at the foot of the mountain was a hall where they lodged for the night. On the morrow the two monks returned to the temple, and the Perfected Qiu returned to his country. No more shall be told here.

Now, in the Dragon Gate Cave dwelt Zhao Xujing. Since his master journeyed westward and did not return, the discipline and decorum of the school were strictly observed; those who cultivated themselves grew all the more flourishing. One day, he spoke to his fellow Daoists, “Our master went westward seven years ago and has not come back. When the master descended the mountain, I asked him of his return, and he said that when the incense-bearing wind comes from the west, then would be his return. Friends, remember this well.” As they were conversing, a strange fragrance suddenly wafted in their nostrils. Xujing said, “This fragrant wind comes with various changes; let us go forth from the cave and see what wind this is. If it be the west wind, then our master has returned.” The assembly all went outside and saw the west wind indeed, bringing waves of sweet scent. Xujing said, “Friends, let us go together westward to welcome him.” There were more than ten persons, all joyfully went; only one remained to watch the cave.

The company proceeded westward for ten li and indeed saw their master coming from afar. They rejoiced beyond measure and thronged about him, each eagerly taking his bundle upon their back. The Perfected Changchun went first, followed by the disciples, and they reached the cave and sat down. After all had reverently bowed, Zhao Xujing said, “Our honoured master has journeyed west for seven years, and only now returns. The journey was dusty and toilsome; we have long awaited you. Master, did your travels in the western lands bring conversion to the peoples there?” The Perfected Changchun briefly related the conditions of the western states, and then told at length of the White Cloud Chan Master of the Sacred Vulture Temple composing the Investiture of the Gods, and of his own writing of the Journey to the West. Then he opened his bundle and took out the draft of the Journey to the West, and gave it to Xujing, saying, “You may engrave this for printing and circulate it to later generations; it will benefit those who cultivate and perfect themselves.” He then ordered that a day be chosen to begin construction of dwellings, opening the Dragon Gate Cave as a monastic grove for the worthy to dwell.

The Perfected Changchun dwelt at Dragon Gate for more than a year. He instructed Dao Jian to entrust the household to Song Dao’an, and with Zhao Daojian, Zheng Zhixiu, and three others, journey eastward. Passing Tong Pass, they came to the border of Dengfeng County in Henan. There they saw two great mountains, cloud-capped and exquisitely fair; the east was called Taishi, the west Shaoshi. Taishi is the Central Peak, Mount Song. Changchun said, “Among the famous mountains of the world, the Five Sacred Mountains stand foremost. Among them, Mount Song is the middle. I wish to widely disseminate the mysterious influence; this must be set first, and then other places may arise.” The disciples exclaimed, “Master’s words are indeed most excellent.”

Thus the master and disciples came to the foot of the mountain and made a full survey of the four directions. At the southwest foot, beneath Xuanyuan Peak, near the Central Peak Temple, lay an ancient temple called the Palace of Longevity. The master and disciples dwelt there, and commenced rebuilding. Benevolent persons from all directions gathered with joy and assistance. Within several years the work was completed. They built over one hundred rooms and thirty-six halls, renaming the Palace of Longevity the Palace of Great Blessings. You may wonder how the Perfected and his disciples could erect such a grand temple in so few years. The truth is that after his attainment, the Perfected Changchun was constantly attended by one hundred thousand heavenly soldiers; the Eight Great Primordials—Zhu, Wang, Yin, Pan, Yue, Wen, Ma, Zhao—never left his side. Moreover, mountain gods, earth spirits, city gods, dragon gods, and many others supported him secretly. In no many years the Palace of Great Blessings was fashioned as an immortal’s abode. Lofty halls stood majestic as jeweled palaces; the temple’s aspect was like the celestial garden of Langyuan and Penghu. Above the mountain gate were carved seven large characters: “Palace of Great Blessings, Grove of the Ten Directions.” From that time forth, the Daoist brethren came in throngs, and the world’s worthy men flowed in. The ancestral customs flourished and the mysterious teachings rose daily; the thirty-six clear rules were each strict and exact; the eighty-one offices of officials were each competent. The dwellers, in their conduct, whether standing, walking, sitting, or lying, were like immortal beings of Peng and Ying. Both old and young, wise and foolish, all responded to the call of the Way; the strong, violent, and wicked had no words left unheeded nor hearts unturned.

One day, the Perfected Changchun, at leisure and with no affairs, wandered with the company over the mountain scenery, enjoying the sights everywhere. They came upon a great rock, flat and regular, capable of seating several dozen. The Master ascended and sat upon the stone. It was the third month, and a gentle breeze brushed the face, while fragrance filled the air; fishes leapt, kites flew, waters flowed, and flowers bloomed. The Perfected’s heart was suddenly stirred with profound mysteries, and his spirit blossomed. He said to the company, “Such fine scenery is rarely met with in the world. Life in this world is likewise thus. You who have life in China and have entered the Mysterious Gate, if you do not quickly turn your hearts to the Way, your time in the world will be wasted. Time swiftly passes; fine scenes are hard to find. Flowers fall but have their season of return; men die but few return to life. If life’s breath does not come, then life is no longer; the flesh dissolves to clear wind, the bones turn to foul mud. Glory and wealth all become but illusions.”

At that moment, disciple Wang Zhiming advanced and knelt before the Master, asking, “Disciple now hears the Master say that flowers falling have times of returning, but men dying rarely return to life. Is there in the world indeed such a thing as immortality or resurrection? Is it so indeed?” The Perfected said, “Good question! Sit again and hear well what all delight to hear, wash your heart and listen attentively, not allowing other thoughts to arise; sit upright and be silent in mind, listen to my expounding. Since the times of the Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors even to today, none has not died. Only immortals and Buddhas do not die. There are those who die but whose spirits remain—these are gods and ghosts. Men living in the world, acting justly and sincerely, holding a whole heart, having loyalty, filial piety, integrity, and righteousness—these have not lost their original nature completely. After death, they may become gods. This is because their spirit is bright and not obscured, and their righteous energy not dispersed. The gods and ghosts are pure yin without yang. Because men in the world act confusedly, with evil and licentious speech, deceit and theft, harming others for their own benefit, greed and covetousness, committing acts contrary to heaven’s principle, arising various evil thoughts, consuming their spirit, qi, and the three treasures by day and night, their heavenly nature is destroyed and spirit lost—these become ghosts. The yin court judges in the underworld examine and punish, sending some to the Three Paths or rebirth as beasts; the retribution is exact and cannot be fully told. Immortals and Buddhas are pure yang without yin. A ball of spirit and brightness is their original nature, like the bright moon; when the clouds of confusion are brushed aside, a solitary moon hangs high in the sky, illuminating earth, mountains, and rivers. This is called nature, called sun; the fairy maiden and azure dragon are called mercury and sulphur, named variously. In short, the one point of spirit and original nature is thought of as the knowing spirit, contained as the primordial spirit, cultivated as the embryonic spirit, and manifested as the yang spirit. It is the east among the directions, the Zhen trigram, and the wood of the five elements. Wood generates fire; fire is the heart; the heart is the child of nature. Those who know how to cultivate themselves cut away passion and sever desire; the hearts of false thoughts and plans are utterly extinguished, and the true nature manifests itself. Those who do not cultivate themselves indulge passion and desire; their false thoughts and greed consume them from morning to night; the heart manifests and the nature is lost; the more they use it, the more it is lost; the nature is darkened and the spirit confused. Hence the dead dwell in the ghostly realm. Those who cultivate the Way must seek no heart. No heart is Confucius’ “no intention, no necessity, no obstinacy, no self,” Yan Zi’s “sitting forgetting,” Zi Qi’s “losing self,” and Zhuangzi’s “old immortal land of no-thing.” All these refer to the doctrine of no heart.”

Wang Zhiming again asked, “Disciple hears the Master say, ‘no heart, then the Way is wondrous and boundless.’ Yan Zi has the功 of sitting forgetting; why then did he die at thirty-two?” The Perfected answered, “Have you not heard the Purple Sun Elder say: ‘The East Flower Old Immortal Elder sits alone in an empty chamber and has no功. Suddenly he meets the Golden Holy Mother of the Western Pool, and with one pill he soars aloft.’ Gold is the ancestral qi of the West. Within the human body it is cultivated as primordial qi, refined as true lead, manifested as true essence, sun and moon, white tiger, infant. It is west in direction, the Dui trigram, and metal in the five elements. Metal produces water. Water is metal’s effect, the yang essence in the kidneys. The great cultivator knows how to nurture water to produce metal and nurture fire to produce wood. Hence it is said the reverse Way can produce Buddhahood and immortality. This water can generate wood to control fire. Human nature is originally fiery; without water to restrain it, it cannot remain; water is moist below; without earth to restrain it, it flows on unchecked. Metal not forged by fire is not hard; wood not carved by metal is not shaped. Earth not warmed by fire does not produce; wood not rooted in earth has no root. The five elements thus mutually employ one another. Yan Zi only knew to follow the five elements and return to their proper place; he did not know the reverse five elements to master creation. How could he know the gathering of the five elements and the interpenetration of the eight trigrams? Therefore he died. The cultivator seizes the creation of heaven and earth, observes the waxing and waning of the moon, discerns the decrease and increase of yin and yang, exhausts his kind and performs works. The Golden Crow and Jade Rabbit are medicines within my body; heaven and earth, heaven and earth are all furnaces within the measure. Those who understand this can exhaust the workings of myriad transformations; those who cultivate this Way can step into the realm of great emptiness; those who acquire this method can assist the foundations of emperors; those who comprehend this Way can ride whales and phoenixes, bestride dragons and govern tigers, feast in the Jade Capital and Golden Palace, and ride alongside the Emperor of Emptiness. But the Way has three vehicles, immortals have nine ranks, laws have eight rules, and entry has five gates. The five gates are sect, discipline, teaching, method, and ritual. The gate of discipline is to receive precepts and observe rules, to manifest forms but cultivate formlessness, to manifest existence but realize non-being. The gate of teaching is first to accumulate external功, then cultivate internal fruit, to teach and transform the ignorant and open their path of awakening, leading them to do good and cultivate virtue, entering the gate of virtue. The gate of method is to employ talismans to cure disease, expel demons and bind spirits, to help men by arts, rescue from disasters, and prove功 by deeds. The gate of ritual is to recite sutras and offer repentance, to perform morning rites and align the stars, to pray for blessings and dispel calamities, to save the dead and relieve adversity, and benefit men by use. These four gates each have their object of attainment, all within my teaching, and none beyond the three vehicles. Our sect values above all the seeing of nature, and the matching of water and fire in order. The chief point is to still the mind and congeal the spirit as the initial step; to illuminate nature and see emptiness as the true ground; to forget consciousness and transform obstacles as the functioning; to turn and review the dragons, tigers, mercury, and lead, all as dharmic appearances which must not be clung to. If one clings to the dharmic appearances, that is an external Way, not our path. You who study the Way, having entered the path, should withdraw and conceal in secrecy, washing your thoughts from the mind. The heavenly principle is ever more subtle, and thus you will see the difficulty of conquering the human heart; the human desire wishes to be pure, but finds the heavenly mind obscure and lost. You may consider this.”

The disciples, hearing the Master’s words, each stepped forward and reverently bowed, thanking him. Suddenly a hundred birds flew together in the empty air, and above their heads formed a canopy like a precious cover. The assembly said, “This is strange! Our Master talks the Way here, and these feathery ones come to listen. Now the Master’s words are done, they gradually disperse.” The Perfected said, “All beings born of womb, egg, and moisture have their own spirits. Those with long lifespans can all be cultivated to spirit fruition. Those born of transformation who have consciousness but no nature cannot return to a human body.” 

While the Master was speaking thus, a Daoist friend reported, “The Song Emperor’s envoy has arrived.” The master and disciples returned to the palace, and indeed outside the mountain gate horses were tethered. The Perfected Changchun said to the assembly, “You go forth to see him; I will return to my chamber and say I am ill in bed and cannot receive orders; ask him to take back the edict.” The assembly did not understand this, but obeyed.

Zhao Xujing went to the guest hall, and after greetings, the guests and hosts took their seats. Xujing asked, “Sir, may we know your noble residence? What brings you to the old palace?” The envoy replied, “I am Liu Zhong, imperial commissioner before the Song Emperor’s carriage. My lord is a sagely and enlightened ruler, who frequently issues edicts to seek worthy men and secure the realm. Yesterday, upon hearing the court’s memorial, I was sent to summon the Perfected Qiu, who is lofty in Way and virtue, with talents to regulate heaven and earth, and stratagems to stabilize the state, to come to the imperial capital to bring peace and order so that ruler and subject may depend on him and all the people receive benefit.” Xujing advanced with a salute, “We were unaware of the arrival of the Song imperial commissioner and did not come out to welcome you. Forgive our ignorance.” Liu Zhong said, “Sir, ignorance is no fault. I pray the Perfected will come forth for our audience.” Xujing replied, “The commissioner carries the Song Emperor’s edict to summon my master, who should serve the state and relieve the people’s burden. But we are all rustic mountain men unworthy of the Way, and moreover my master is ill and confined to bed, unable to receive the orders. Pray take back the edict and report to the emperor; choose other worthy men. We lack virtue within and talent without; we are but famous in name, not in reality, how could we be used?” Liu Zhong, hearing these words, thought, “These Daoists seem famous but without substance.” He took the edict back and left. Xujing escorted him to the mountain gate. No more shall be told here.

Meanwhile, the Perfected Qiu in the palace soon had envoys from Jin come to pay respects. He lay abed, not rising. The disciples could not fathom his intent. Suddenly one day he said to them, “You must diligently propagate the teaching and not neglect cultivation. I intend to journey south on some business.” So he bade farewell and floated away. The disciples accompanied him five li, then returned. No more shall be told here.

Now the thirty-third generation successor Zhang Bojing, as Wei Wang guarded Mingzhou, fell ill and summoned the successor to perform rites and prayers for his safety. At that time, the Perfected Liu Changsheng was traveling in Mingzhou and saw the Wei Wang’s household setting up rites in the Flower Hall. Seeing that the successor had not yet come, the garden was quiet. He began performing the ritual, manifesting an illusory city on the altar, like the immortal palace of Peng Island. Tens of thousands of people beheld it daily. The Wei Wang heard of it, doubted and disbelieved, and was too ill to come see. Liu Changsheng used talisman water and medicine, and the illness was immediately cured. The Wei Wang came out to observe and knew the perfected one was performing magic, exceedingly joyful. When the successor arrived, he saw the altar and doubted he had mistakenly entered an immortal palace, and dared not speak. Soon Liu Changsheng appeared and met Zhang Bojing; the Celestial Master hastened to bow, saying, “Disciple mistakenly entered the immortal palace; I pray the Perfected forgive me.” Liu said, “This place is indeed the mortal realm, why did the Celestial Master mistake it?” Bojing said, “How can such an immortal realm be in the mortal world?” Changsheng said, “This is but an illusory scene set up by this humble one, not a true realm.” Thus the Perfected and successor developed mutual reverence and trust, invited to stay seven days; when the rites concluded and magic was withdrawn, they took leave of Wei Wang. Liu Changsheng and the successor parted at Hangzhou.

Liu Changsheng traveled in Minzhong and dwelt at the Hall of Kindness in Fuzhou. Knowing of his Way, many came to his door, numbering over two hundred. The Perfected chose a day to lecture on the meaning of the Tao Te Ching, gathering Dao and laymen together, expounding the ancestral custom and universally saving those with affinity. It was truly:

When the Great Way is perfected, the laws flow freely,  
The spirit’s perfect transformation brings endless joy.  
Preaching and saving wherever one meets,  
For ages eternal abiding in vast space.

To learn of the later affairs of the Perfected Liu, hear the next chapter unfold.
