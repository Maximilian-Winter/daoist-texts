# Chapter Twenty-Two: The Immortal Liu Plants Peonies in Luoyang — The Yellow Stone Elder Leaves the Purple Cypress

Verses say:

He who attains the Way is without attachment,  
In all things, as will and heart incline.  
Planting flowers and trees grows thick and lush,  
From withered wood spring buds and shoots arise.  
Transforming, soaring in the azure sky,  
How can he be held by market or forest?  
A thousand-year pine’s seed is easy to find,  
Not racing in the dust of mortal strife. (Tune: "Moon over the West River")

The narrative tells: The Perfected One Qiu, at the White Cloud Temple in Yanjing, widely proclaimed the Daoist teachings of the Great School, sending disciples Song Dao’an, Zheng Zhixiu, Yu Qingfeng, Yin Zhiping, and others to instruct in various places. This shall not be further told.

Now, as for Liu Changsheng the Perfected One, after liberation in Fuzhou, he journeyed throughout the grotto heavens and blessed lands, the Three Mountains and Five Great Peaks, paying homage to immortals and sages, sometimes manifesting, sometimes hidden, accumulating merits everywhere, awaiting the summons to ascend. At this time he was wandering in Luoyang, recalling how Sun Buer nurtured the Way in a broken kiln; after the Way was accomplished, he and Dan Yang and Geng Shi ascended the crane flight, and the place was named the Three Wells Cave, where incense and offerings flourished. Desiring to visit and see once more, he transformed his body, taking the form of a Quanzhen Daoist companion, about twenty years old, distinguished in bearing, free from ordinary measure, carefree beyond the world. How was he arrayed? Behold:

On his head a silk kerchief, two silk ribbons fluttering;  
Upon his body a crane’s cloak, embroidered with blossoming flowers;  
His face like the full moon, cheeks glowing with peach blossoms,  
Lips as if painted vermilion, eyes concealing autumn waters.  
No painting can match the portrait, no beauty of courtesans excel;  
His ten fingers shine like jade bamboo shoots, his whole frame seems like smooth cream.  
Truly: his grace yields not to the Immortal Pei,  
Nor his bearing to the Song beauty.

It was the fifteenth day of the second lunar month, the day of the Blue Ox appearing, the sacred birthday of the Supreme Lord Laozi. In Luoyang’s towns and villages, great and small households, men and women alike, all came to the Blue Ox Temple to burn incense. Liu the Perfected One first toured the Three Wells Cave, then proceeded to the Blue Ox Temple to offer incense. The young women there, seeing Liu’s extraordinary beauty, each felt their limbs grow numb, saying, "Where in the world is such a handsome man? Why has he forsaken the world to cultivate the Way?" Some said, "In his former life he endured great hardships in cultivation; now born with such beauty, continuing his cultivation surely he will become an immortal." The people talked, and all who saw him were filled with fondness.

Liu the Perfected One saw a maiden with a peony bud in her hair, and approached, saying, "Fair maiden, though this peony on your head is beautiful, alas, it cannot be admired by the crowd. If you would give this flower to the poor Daoist, instantly I shall cause it to be shared among all." The maiden, pleased by his words, plucked the peony from her head and gave it to him. Liu took it in his hand, breathed upon it the breath of immortality, inscribed a talisman of resurrection, then summoned the primordial water of True Unity to nurture the flower. He planted the peony in the wild mountain earth, chanting the sacred words, adding talisman and sprinkling water. In an instant, sprouts grew, branches extended, buds formed and blossoms appeared. The flower was even more radiant, its fragrance rare and pure. Liu said to the crowd, "This flower is not like those in gardens, which, once cut, fade within a day. This peony, once plucked and worn on the head, will not wither for seven days, and will grow more fragrant the longer it is worn. Those who desire one may freely pluck them." At once, the people swarmed in great numbers, men and women pressed close, all came to gather, and as soon as plucked, the flowers sprang forth anew. Word of this spread far and wide, and people came from places near and far to see. Truly it was: The fame reached Luoyang, adding to its scenery, and wherever one went, people were to be seen admiring flowers.

When Liu the Perfected One saw the crowd’s tumult, he transformed into a clear breeze, vanishing without trace. The people, surprised at the sudden disappearance, saw on the peony leaves the five characters, "Changshengzi Liu Shu" inscribed. Then all knew the manifestation of Immortal Liu, and all called him "Liu the Perfected who Plants Flowers." Later generations built temples and sculpted his image, naming it the Liu Immortal Temple, where incense ever rises in unbroken succession. But this is another story, and shall not be told here.

Now, after his manifestation in Luoyang by planting flowers, Liu the Perfected One wished to journey to Zhongnan once more. Passing through Chang’an, reaching Mengzhi county’s borders, he suddenly recalled that there was an ancient tower and temple here, a place where the Supreme Lord’s Dao and Virtue were transmitted, reckoned a relic of the ancient sages, a place not to be missed. So he ascended the mountain to visit, and beheld:

Layered and rugged ridges, sheer cliffs uneven;  
Glow of rosy clouds reaches the azure sky, as if jade and precious stones;  
Purple mists curl about the dark gate, surpassing an immortal’s mansion;  
Tiger’s roar, dragon’s chant vie for supremacy; willows redden, peaches green contend in spring.  
The Scripture Platform resembles the palace of Doushuai Heaven,  
The Law Transmission place like the shell palaces of Pengying.  
Sacred traces remain on the ancient tower’s stones,  
Immortal footprints by the Maidens’ Spring.  
Beneath Lü Immortal’s Rock, thoughts turn to Tang and Song immortals;  
Within the Five Elders’ Cave, memories of the Old Master of Shang and Zhou.  
Riding the Blue Ox, the purple vapors cross Guan Yin;  
Passing Hangu, crossing the flowing sands, transforming the Hu barbarians.  
To know the past and present, this is Zhongnan’s blessed land;  
Tracing and seeking its traces, worthy to praise the tower and immortal palace.  
Truly: Five thousand profound truths passed down through ages,  
Ten thousand ancient airs shall never be effaced.

Liu the Perfected One, while touring the ancient tower and immortal sites, was filled with admiration. From afar he saw white clouds advancing westward, knowing immortals were passing by. Shortly he beheld Wang Yuyang and Tan Changzhen arrive, touring the mountains of Zhongnan.

Now Wang Yuyang had dwelt on Zhongtiao Mountain, standing alone on a perilous cliff for nine years, shedding his mortal form and ascending, accumulating merits awaiting summons. One day while wandering Xiong’er Mountain, Tan Changzhen was undergoing transformation there; they met and agreed to tour Zhongnan together. Upon reaching Zhongnan town, they saw the ancient tower suffused with purple vapors entwining, knowing a true immortal rested there. The two immortals ascended to tour, and saw Liu Changsheng there. The three immortals met with joy, exchanging salutations, and each recounted their origins in attaining the Way.

Changzhen said: "Today the three of us meet unexpectedly, a rare occurrence indeed. Only Dan Yang and Buer have long since transcended, yet remain in the south accumulating merits, soon to meet at the southern mountain. Master Hao Taigu, having attained the Way at Zhao Prefecture Bridge, dwells with Mistress Teng on Mount Hua; he has carved seventy-two stone chambers to aid future worthy ones in peace and repose. When Mistress Teng’s elixir was completed, they traveled the world, accumulating merits and saving beings. Only Qiu Changchun’s fame spreads through the realms, his virtue surpassing all true immortals; now he serves as northern prime minister, widely proclaiming the Great School’s teachings. Truly he is a man of great achievement late to ripen; we all fall short of him." Wang Yuyang said: "Qiu Changchun abandoned home to cultivate the Way for over forty years, endured countless hardships, died and was resurrected, his resolve never wavering. When he attained the Way, he was revered far and wide. Since ancient times, none have sought the Way with greater perseverance than Qiu Changchun and Bai Yuchan. If men would emulate their cultivation and unwavering single-mindedness, all could attain the Way, and every one could ascend to truth." The three immortals praised and admired him without ceasing.

Liu the Perfected said: "Since the four of us have met here, shall we go together to Ji Zhen Cave to pay homage to our Master Ancestor?" Wang and Tan agreed gladly, each showing their divine powers. Wang Yuyang summoned a tiger; Liu Changsheng called forth a deer; Tan Changzhen brought a leopard. Each mounted their steed, and quickly they arrived at Purple Cypress Mountain. Before them appeared Ji Zhen Grotto Heaven, mist and auspicious vapors swirling, oriole songs and crane cries, phoenix dances and luan flights. The three immortals dismounted and entered the cave, beholding fragrant jade grasses and rare flowers, fragrant fruits of the spirit mountain. Within, immortal children came to announce them. Presently many true immortals emerged. Liu, Tan, and Wang hastened to prostrate and bow.

Lüzu led the three immortals to the rear cave. Chongyang pointed to He Yuchan and said: "This is your teacher’s consort, He Yuchan." The three immortals advanced and paid respects, then sat. Tan Changzhen said: "Once in western Shu, a madwoman struck me a blow, saying, ‘One blow repels many lifetimes of sins.’ Was this your consort’s enlightenment?" He Yuchan smiled: "Long ago, knowing your character and power, I left this saying, awaiting your attainment to complete the verse." Changzhen bowed and thanked her: "By your noble grace I have attained the Way. I desire further to accumulate merits in the world, to repay my master’s kindness." Chongyang said: "Since you have this mind, no merit is too much, no path too broad; the more you accumulate, the higher you rise, the greater Heaven’s blessings. Go forth again to perform great deeds; when Changchun’s work is complete and Way perfected, we shall all go to the immortal capital to pay homage at the Golden Gate." Liu Changsheng and Wang Chuyi each recounted their origins in attaining the Way and transforming beings. The immortals praised them without end. Suddenly, auspicious light shone far outside the cave, signaling the arrival of a High Immortal. The immortals hurried out to welcome him.

Behold an immortal riding a red dragonqiu, followed by a celestial child carrying a gourd, descending from the air. It was known at once to be the Red Pine Elder descending. The True Yang led the immortals to welcome him, guiding him into the cave. None had yet met him; the True Yang Emperor raised his fist in salute, and the others advanced respectfully. The True Yang spoke: "We did not know the elder’s descent to the desolate mountain, and failed to meet him afar; we beg pardon for this discourtesy."

The Great Red Pine Elder said: "Yesterday at the Southern Pole meeting, I heard words from the Perfected Xu, and learned the cause of Jingwei’s descent. Now, having been enlightened and attained the Way by the True Yang, Pure Yang, and Chongyang Perfected, he has entered the immortal ranks. Thus, relying on their grace, I come to escort him to Kunlun to meet the Queen Mother, then await the summons for arrangements." He Yuchan heard and hurried forward, kneeling, saying: "Hearing my master’s words, I have just awakened to the origin. Were it not for my master’s enlightening grace, I would have lost my original nature." The Red Pine Elder said: "You were the daughter of the Flame Emperor, once my disciple; at that time you had not heard the Way, and hastened to seek truth at Peng Island, perishing drowned at sea. Your spirit transformed into a blue bird named Jingwei, filled with wrath, desiring to fill the Eastern Sea with wood and stone from the Western Mountains. Then I saw her and brought her to the Jade Pool, where the Queen Mother took her in charge, ordering her to watch over the peach garden and accumulate merit until her wrath was purified, then she might return to the world to cultivate the Way’s fruit. Now she has shed her feathers and attained the rank of Golden Immortal."

Having spoken, he produced several pine seeds, saying to the immortals: "Yesterday at the Southern Pole meeting, I brought these pine seeds, produced by Li Nong, a rare fruit once in a thousand years. Mortals who eat these may live long without aging; immortals who eat them double their divine powers. I divide them among you; each may eat one. I keep one to plant here on this mountain, so that future aspirants to the Way may eat it to extend their years and lives. Those who take it long and cultivate may attain longevity and immortality." These are indeed the pines of Purple Cypress Mountain, from that very planting. This shall not be further told.

The immortals each took a seed and ate; indeed, the taste was sweet and fragrant, and they praised it highly.

The Red Pine Elder commanded Huo Lu to go to western Shu to admonish the people, taking He Yuchan with him, riding the red dragonqiu, going to the Western Pool. The immortals escorted them outside, watching the red dragonqiu depart westward.

The immortals returned to the cave; at this time True Yang and Pure Yang wished to descend the mountain to accumulate merits and transform beings; Tan, Liu, and Wang immortals also wished to follow. Only Chongyang Perfected remained in the cave, awaiting the completion of all disciples’ merits, until the seven golden lotuses gathered, then they might answer the summons to ascend. The immortals left the cave; Tan Changzhen and the three immortals bade farewell to their master and ancestors, each going off separately to transform beings, which shall not be told.

Meanwhile, immortals Zhong and Lü left Zhongnan and roamed Lin’an, where they met Cui Yuzhi. After Cui Yuzhi had accompanied Emperor Song to the front, took leave of illness to return to Guangzhou, he met the Perfected Bai Ziqing; seeing his Daoist spirit, Bai transmitted to him longevity and eternal life techniques. Now roaming Lin’an, they met Zhong and Lü immortals, imparting to them the Way of Three and Five Returning to One.

In the autumn of the jia-shen year, Emperor Ningzong of Song passed away. The historian Shi Miyuan forged an edict, enthroning Prince Gui Cheng of Yi, renaming him Lizong; honored the empress as Empress Dowager, jointly ruling affairs. Crown Prince Hong was conferred Jiyang Commandery Prince. Ningzong had no sons; Hong was named heir, being Lizong’s elder brother, but was killed by Shi Miyuan.

In the yi-you year, Song changed the era name to Baoqing. At this time there was a holy monk Daoji who passed away. He was from Tiantai; gifted and quick-witted in youth, fond of studying Buddhist scriptures. After losing both parents, he abandoned home to cultivate the Way. Visiting Lin’an, he roamed Lingyin Temple and became disciple to the old monk Yuan Xiangtang. Later he attained sudden enlightenment, feigning madness to blend with the world, drinking wine and eating meat. The monks all despised him for his antics, calling him "Crazy Daoji." After Yuan Xiangtang’s death, he left Lingyin Temple, feigned madness in the city; sometimes healing palace disasters, sometimes curing serious illnesses in the red chamber; all his words were efficacious, all demons subdued. Later residing at Jingci Temple as steward, he once dreamed visions of gratitude to the Empress Dowager for rebuilding the great hall. He gathered wood from the Mount Si’an area, and when brought to the temple well, the water rose miraculously. When blamed for bringing meat and wine, he vomited what he ate, all of which flew away; even aquatic fish and scales all swam away freely. At sixty years old, he suddenly abstained from meat and wine. When officials invited him to drink, Daoji said, "Let (the creatures) be released." Creatures burnt or maimed, when released into water, revived. His reputation grew. That autumn he departed. Monks cremated him, finding countless relics. The next day, a monk brought a letter to Jingci Temple, telling the abbot: "Yesterday on the road I met Daoji’s letter, warning of Mongol cruelty and destruction of Buddhist lands; he now wishes to return to Taizhou." Later generations said Daoji was the reincarnation of the Purple-Gold Arhat of Guoqing Temple.

At that time the Mongols invaded Korea and Western Regions, the Quan and Xia; armies marched in all directions. Xia lord Dewang died from worry and fright; his nephew Ni took the throne.

On ding-hai day, the Mongols captured Xia lord Ni and ended Xia. The generals fought over gold, silk, and children; only Chu Cai took several books and a large quantity of rhubarb, loaded on two camels. Soon after the army returned, an epidemic struck; only rhubarb could cure it. Thanks to this rhubarb, the lives of ten thousand were saved, and the army was preserved. Turning back, they breached the three passes; the Jin only held Henan.

That year Mongol lord Temujin died, his four sons Taolei supervised the realm. They took Xihe Prefecture; the prefect Chen Yin’s wife Ms. Du died from poison, standing stiff without falling. Taolei said she was loyal, and only after temple rites was she able to fall. She was buried with the rites of a great officer. The Mongols renewed their invasion; monk Chen of Taichang led four hundred cavalry to a great victory.

That autumn the Mongols enthroned their third son Wuqutai as Taizong. Employing Chu Cai, with abundant order and peace, military fame greatly revived. Taizong issued an edict, renaming the Northern Palace Immortal Isle to Wan’an Palace, and Tiangchang Temple to Changchun Temple. He decreed Qiu Chuji to manage all monks and Daoists across the realm; good men everywhere were subject to him. He granted a golden tiger plaque, so that in all teaching matters he might fully decide. Wang Zhiming, pacifier of Shandong, returned with an edict from Taizhou to White Cloud Temple in Yanjing.

On the twenty-third day of the fifth month, during the hour of si and wu, thunder and rain suddenly raged; the southern bank of Taiye Pool collapsed, water rushed into the Eastern Lake, the sound was heard for dozens of li, fish and turtles all fled, and the pool dried up. The northern mountain pass also crumbled. The Master sighed and said: "The mountain falls, the pool dries; shall I perish with them?" On the fourth day of the seventh month, the Master said to disciples Song Dao’an and Yin Zhiping: "Brother Dan Yang once told me: After my passing, the Way’s teaching will flourish; all regions will become Daoist villages; Daoist temples will be granted official names and quotas; you should preside over the great temples and great halls, and there will be messengers bearing talismans and riding messengers’ horses to manage the Daoist gates. My master Chongyang’s words—all have come true." Truly it is:

Now comes to the earth the whole spring scene,  
The wind is right, joy everywhere, peace supreme.  
Since ancient times, the Mysterious School revives,  
At Dan Platform, Purple Mansion records immortal names.
