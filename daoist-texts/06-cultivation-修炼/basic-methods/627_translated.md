# III. Confession of Guilt and Karmic Offences

O multitude! Having already taken refuge in the Three Treasures, it is necessary to observe and cultivate the subtle practices. The Supreme One says, "There is no gate to calamity or happiness; it is man who summons them himself. The retribution of good and evil is like a shadow that follows the form." Therefore, Heaven and Earth appoint divine regulators of transgressions, who, according to the lightness or severity of the offence committed by man, take away his allotted span. If the offence be very slight, and amount to hundreds of deeds, he who desires longevity must first avoid them. The term "karmic offence" means fault or error. Now the practitioners of cultivation, being themselves blind to their true knowledge, and deceiving their own nature, see only the faults of others, and know not their own faults. Even in this ignorance of their own errors, their guilt is already deep, their karma heavy. To deceive the heart and darken oneself, how then can one enter the Way? Hence it is requisite to repent. Repentance means reverently facing the holy and true, not daring to conceal past faults, earnestly setting forth vows, that former errors be not again committed. Thus only can one advance upwards.

I now, without sparing rebuke, will plainly explain those who deceive their hearts and darken themselves. O multitude, each one listen and understand clearly. Now I speak of what is meant by deceiving the heart and darkening oneself. With mouth they speak loftily and extensively, but in their hearts they desire goods and covet wealth; outwardly they put on the person of rank and virtue, but inwardly they plan machinations; they accept precepts but do not observe the rules; they exhort others not to fear reproach. By day they are Daoists, by night they consort with knaves; in company they speak distrustfully; in their official duties they commonly excuse themselves. They hear the Way but do not practice it; knowing the law they yet offend. They use cunning to cheat the simple; they seek advantage as their station. Habitually arising in ignorance, they are often stubborn and obstinate; they make nothing to be something, and something to be nothing; they take what is false for true, and true for false; they call a stag a horse, sell a dog and hang a sheep; in secret chambers they wrong their conscience, under blue sky they plot evil; in their belly they make dark calculations, behind smiles they hide blades. All manner of evil deeds, every one contrary to the Way, and not one unaware of himself. Those unaware are fools and ignorant, deluded and fanciful men. Those who know and yet deliberately offend are called knaves and villains, evildoers and base men. Is this not deceiving the heart and darkening oneself? Their guilt and karma is deeper and heavier than that of fools and ignorant deluded men. Why so? The fools and ignorant have no wisdom, and through ignorance make mistakes; they only harm themselves and cannot harm others; if they harm others, they ultimately suffer harm themselves. Only the knaves and evil men, secret, sly, and crafty, having harmed others to benefit themselves, yet also darken themselves to deceive their own heart, so that Heaven and Earth know not their craft, and ghosts and spirits know not their evil. With cunning schemes they always practise concealment; plotting deep and intricate plans, and craftily covering their tracks. They lay nets for men, and men do not perceive whence the nets are set; they push men into wells, and men cannot tell who opened the wells. Such men are many in the world. But those who cultivate the Way cannot allow such. As before taking refuge in the Three Treasures, if one has such a heart, now having received the precepts, change and reform quickly; seek repentance without delay.

Of late the primal wind has slackened, precepts are often relaxed, the Way’s transformation declines; the yellow-crowned lose their teaching, repeatedly admonished yet offenders of rules and vows abound. I now, sparing no bitter words, admonish and entreat, to exhort the multitude. Not only must the sins and offences of many births and kalpas be repented, but also those sins against parents of many lives must be repented; now the sins against parents, the nine primal and seven ancestors, must be repented. Even one’s own former karmic offences must be swiftly and secretly swept clean from the mind. All wrongful and delusive thoughts, all the slightest vain imaginings, must be confessed for past faults, repented of for past errors; only thus can one attain the grade of the Way. Otherwise, to cover one’s ears while stealing a bell, how can one be liberated? The great Way is afar indeed! I now compose a Confession and Vow text, which the multitude shall recite morning and evening.

Confession and Vow Text

Disciples all, from the time of receiving the precepts until now, have only sought the vain name of receiving the precepts, and have not been able to uphold the reality. The robes and crowns are worn loosely, the alms bowls are empty in transmission. Neither can they be diligent in the original truth, but have fallen deeply into faults and errors. The heart is without wisdom, unable to earnestly inquire of a wise teacher; the nature is clouded with ignorance, and often cannot endure insult from peers. Narrow is the mind, unable to bear affection; the intellect is biased and perverse, causing many offences. Not understanding true enlightenment, they take illusion for reality; not discerning causes and effects, they take the thief for their son. They deem the worthy as bandits, inverting right and wrong and hard to understand; they take gentlemen for villains, the right and wrong are indistinguishable. Some solicit mistaken causes and effects, money and provisions going into private purses; some recite scriptures with textual errors, their minds entirely unexamined. Some are moved in heart by present beauty, their root of lust stirred; some hear holy words yet their belly is in doubt. Various corrupt deeds, forever falling into the common current. If from now on they do not reform themselves, in future the evening and the end of the road will come, surely sinking like a stone into the sea. If still they act at will, when the bell tolls and the water-clock runs out, then they will know the sword trees and knife mountains. Therefore, here are offerings of fragrant incense of the heart, the lamp of the heart, offerings of the heart’s waters, with all sincerity of body, spirit, and life devoted. At all times muttering softly, looking to the cinnabar firmament and pacifying life; morning and evening hastening, looking up to the Golden Palace and surrendering sincerity. With devout fasting and washing, unafraid of hardship and toil. Turning the body over, continuing to knock on the Master’s compassion; setting forth offerings, earnestly beseeching Heaven’s pardon! From this time entirely removing all evil, forever becoming persons of goodness; henceforth striving to serve the truth, earnestly keeping the original truth’s precepts. If again they offend former rules, in life they shall suffer Heaven’s punishment, in death fall to Fengdu; as if violating the sun’s decrees, in Yang they suffer extreme punishment, in Yin they are buried in Avici. But may after repentance, sins be extinguished, blessings arise, disasters disperse, misfortunes cease, ice melt and the awakened earth open; the dim month shine forth. The pitch-dark chamber be lighted again; the sun of wisdom illuminate the black night; the shoots of goodness increase, sweet dew fall on the barren branches. The primal threads flow with the compassion of regeneration, the Dharma-rain abundantly moistens the restoration’s grace. So that the black books of condemnation be erased, and the blue slips bear their titles. Diligent cultivation of great serenity, securing and strengthening the true body. The eight consciousnesses all diminish, the hundred hindrances and thousand demons vanish like clouds; three lives deeply realized, nine clouds and seven ancestors ascend in rosy clouds. The spirit wind widely known, myriad breaths raise the ferry. Continuously and greatly invigorated is the ancestral spirit; all branches and streams converge on the ancestral seat. Conduct and concealment lead to auspiciousness, quelling the storms outside the world; concealment and manifestation in peace, the sun and moon within the peaceful calabash. Again I wish for the Master, teachers, fellow students, relatives and clan, the great earth’s multitude, and all believers under heaven, that every heart and mind be clear and bright, each nature shine with heavenly light. May the seasons be harmonious and the winds fruitful, the land peaceful and the people secure. May arms and weapons be laid to rest, waters and fires balanced. May the imperial plan be firm, the imperial work far-reaching and prosperous. May the holy emperor live long, with worthy ministers. May all peoples be united in sincerity, and a thousand states delight in the Way. Equal with all living beings, returning together to purity and stillness. I humbly implore! The holy compassion to bend down and aid salvation.

The foregoing Confession and Vow text is to be devoutly recited morning and evening. It is necessary for one’s own Dharma body, facing the supreme sovereign of the heavens, to be at all times sincerely devoted; heart by heart to be ashamed; sentence by sentence to recite clearly; word by word to repent and hesitate; with courage and vigour to advance. In life and death, survival or perishing, in distress, hunger, or cold, all are to be let go. Only with holding fast to precepts and concentration shall there be a future.
