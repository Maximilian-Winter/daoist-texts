# VI. The Precepts: Exactness and Strictness in Conduct

The cultivators of the Way, having already severed their attachments and cast off their entanglements, earnestly seek to transcend the world in order to resolve the problem of life and death. But if love and attachment remain unextinguished, and desires are reborn with force, then the heart is still bound and entangled, falling again into nets and pitfalls; such a one will never attain liberation. It is necessary, before the first sign appears, to make preemptive provision and be on guard. Otherwise, the efforts of the past are wasted, and the demons and obstacles of the future cannot be escaped. Therefore, in accordance with the ancient sages of old, one should direct the heart to the Precepts.

This word “Precept” is the pestle to suppress demons, able to subdue devils and evil spirits; it is the talisman for protection of life, able to increase blessings and prolong longevity; it is the ladder to ascend to heaven, able to pay respects to the Three Pure Ones and transcend the mortal to become a saint; it is the lamp to guide the way, able to dissolve the six desires and dispel darkness and gloom; it is the precious boat and raft of the immortals, able to ferry living beings from the sea of suffering; it is the merciful bridge and ferry, able to save living beings from the river of attachment. Truly, it is the safeguard of earnest practitioners, the main outline for advancing on the Way. Without a gate to the immortal and sage, all enter by the Precepts; the sages and worthies have a path, all proceed by the practice of Precepts. It is indeed the essential road and thoroughfare for the immortals and perfected ones, the central gate and straight path for the wise and virtuous.

The multitude, having now in this present life heard the Precept teachings sown by causes and conditions of former lives, have attained the greatest of fortunes. Yet if they do not walk and uphold the Precepts with exactness, strictness, and diligence, this greatest of fortunes will turn to the greatest of crimes. This Precept and rule is the ordinance of the Primordial Capital, the regulation established by the Primordial Supreme Treasure, constantly examined by the Celestial Qing Court, guarded by divine soldiers and heavenly generals on patrol. Those who reverently observe it are recorded on the elixir tablets; those who violate it are recorded in the black books of wrongdoing. Not a jot or tittle is omitted, not even a hair or thread escapes. Yet nowadays the disciples receiving the Precepts are altogether ignorant. In what way are they called ignorant? Only in that they have not yet understood the principle. If they knew this principle, they would surely be exact and strict and not transgress. If they break the rules, is it not ignorance?

Therefore, among the multitude, if one has received the Precepts, it is necessary to earnestly reflect upon this word “Precept.” How to make Precepts? Precepts are prohibitions; what is prohibited and restricted? Why did you receive them in the first place? If it is indeed for the sake of the Precepts, then you should observe them every day. If you do not observe them daily, why receive the Precepts at all? This intention is not for the Precepts, but only for the empty fame of receiving the robe and the transmission; it is but to gain the robe and the transmission of the Way. Otherwise, why not keep the pure rules? It must be earnestly remembered that in our Way, since the teaching of the Seven True Ones revealed the Way, the teaching has declined and weakened. The dignity and solemnity of the Precepts has not appeared in the world for four hundred years. The cause is that in the sect there has been no one to undertake the responsibility. Hence, the heavenly lamp that illumines the Way has never been lit brightly, causing practitioners to be darkened and confused, abandoning the staff that supports the body and losing its handle. No wonder that heterodox and heretical sects run rampant throughout the world; the pure, quiet, liberated, upright, and illustrious Way is silent and unheard. Now, by fortune, the Way is to be propagated and the time of flourishing has come. Above, there is the imperial blessing of the august sovereign, and the world is at peace; the court has many able officials and pious believers, and within the teaching there are protectors of the Dharma. There are also patrons and donors, robes and crowns prepared, already made ready. This is a chance rarely met in a thousand lives, seldom encountered in many generations; all of this is the result of your past causes meeting at this time.

Having received the Precepts, you should diligently seek to understand this word “Precept.” What is called a Precept? Alas! The disciples who receive the Precepts differ in wisdom and folly. The foolish, when first receiving the Precepts, have good intention, but once having received them, they hide away their original mind and cannot persist in the Precepts. Is it not a great pity to lose the original intention of receiving the Precepts, to treat a Precept robe or a Precept kerchief as if they were cast into the Eastern Ocean—sometimes discarded, sometimes sold, sometimes altered into ordinary clothing or patched into sleeves? This desecrates the heavenly spirits and ruins the place of the Way. Again, the pure alms-bowl is turned into an incense burner, to hold money or grain. Breaking the fasts and the Precepts, drinking wine and eating flesh, they go to all extremes, extinguishing their wisdom and severing their immortal root. There are cases now on record that clearly prove this. There was once a disciple of the Precepts who destroyed his practice of the Precepts, defiled and sold the Precept scriptures, sold the Precept robe, abandoned the alms-bowl, then suddenly died. He saw many ghostly officers coming with chains and ropes to bind him. Arriving at the underworld, he saw a tribunal office, very imposing, with many ghostly officers lined up on both sides, locking many people—these were the companions who had died in the same fellowship but had broken the Precepts. The disciple was greatly alarmed and asked, “How have you come to be here?” The other disciples answered, “We know not why; one after another we have gathered here.” On the door was a plaque inscribed with the three great characters “Office of Examination and Verification.” He inquired of the ghostly officers, “What is this Office of Examination and Verification?” They answered, “This is a new heavenly regulation. There are two legal offices, each responsible for matters of the Precepts for monks and Daoists. Whenever anyone in the world resolves to receive the Precepts, the local earth god records their name on the register. On a certain day they receive the Precepts; on certain days they have meritorious conduct; on certain days they transgress; on certain days they rebel against the Way and their master; on certain days they destroy the rules and ruin the teaching; on certain days they sell their robes; on certain days they defile their alms-bowls; on certain days they slander the masters; on certain days they plot against patrons; on certain days they are greedy and corrupt; on certain days they indulge in lust. All these are carefully recorded and monthly reported to the various offices for examination and verification. Only after verification by this office do they proceed to other offices. You disciples who have received the Precepts, unless your virtue is exalted and your heart for the Way strict, do not come to the underworld. Those among you who do not observe the Precepts first are examined and removed from the register at this office, then within the appointed time are seized and die. If not examined by this office, other offices will not sign to arrest you. Hear this, disciples! This one who died has now been out of his body for a night and half a day, yet he speaks this case.” 

The multitude, when blaming others for faults, are sharp and clear in perceiving them; but when it comes to their own faults, they are altogether unaware. Day by day and month by month, they one by one forgive themselves, thus creating boundless evil karma and still seek to conceal it. This is called deceiving the heart. Those who have received the Precepts must examine the conduct of their own hearts, what they do daily, what they speak daily and nightly, thinking always; when good, act accordingly; when evil, correct immediately. They must not excuse themselves, nor forgive themselves. If you have faults unexamined and unawakened to, immediately turn towards the holy perfected ones, mournfully repent, carefully study the rules of the Precepts, diligently seek a wise master, and cultivate profound learning. Respect teachers as parents, respect fellow practitioners as elder brothers, delight in the Dharma as in one’s spouse, love the scriptures as one’s precious jade. Holding the Precepts in the heart is like holding an object in the hand; if the hand lets go, it is lost; if the heart lets go of the Precepts, they are broken. The laws and ordinances of the world’s kings punish those who transgress; the heavenly laws of the Way, the rules of the Celestial Qing, punish those who break them. Do not say the underworld is dark and unseen; life and death, birth and passing, are only in your heart. Do not say the Precept spirits are hidden and unmanifest; entering and exiting depends only on your thoughts. 

The four words “Precepts, exactness, strictness, and perseverance” mean: to lower the heart and follow the Way is called “Precept”; to endure and practise is called “conduct”; to be without the slightest admixture is called “exactness”; to avoid the minutest transgression is called “strictness”; to be unchanging from beginning to end is called “perseverance in the Precepts”; to be unshaken in poverty is called “guarding the Precepts.” Among you who have received the Precepts, some do not even remember the ten rules of the Precepts. This is having a name without reality; why should it be so?

But there is a saying in the Dharma that I must teach the multitude to take to heart and practise. The heavenly ruler’s original mind is one of cherishing life; great compassion and vast mercy save living beings. If there be any who have broken the Precepts, but from this time repent, with true heart awaken and again observe the rules, becoming strict and exact, and no longer dare to offend twice, with such earnest and remorseful repentance, the heavenly heart will also be moved with pity, and pardon and restore them. I have now a story of cause and effect concerning one who broke the Precepts and then again kept them, which I relate to the multitude. A disciple of the Precepts said that after receiving the Precepts he suddenly encountered demonic tribulations and broke the fasts and Precepts, doing all manner of things. One night he dreamed of the underworld, seeing the tribunal. There were many ghostly judges, hanging gauze lamps and arranging incense tables. Presently King Yan came out the great gate, majestic as the world’s emperor. The judges reported that the heavenly envoy had arrived, and ordered the incense table to be prepared for receiving the edict, no different from receiving an edict in the world above. The heavenly envoy was an immortal official, wearing a golden lotus crown, a five-cloud crane cloak, holding a yellow tube, and going forward; the ghosts were not allowed to enter. The dreaming Daoist also wished to enter. The ghost soldiers shouted, “What wandering ghost are you, daring to come to this solemn great hall?” One ghost said, “He looks like a Daoist.” The other ghost answered, “The edict of the other day ordered that all who cultivate and keep the Precepts shall at death be permitted to wear their robes and crowns to enter; those whose light is bright enter the main gate; those of less light enter the east gate; those without light have their Precept names removed and are chained outside the west corner gate, and sent for trial according to their list. This Daoist has no light, is a lump of black vapour, just like me, pretending to be a Daoist—go away quickly, go away!” He brandished an iron rod. The disciple awoke, clearly remembering. Immediately he turned over, rose from bed, hastened to wash his face, took pure fire to burn incense, greatly feared, mournfully repented, and resolved to strictly observe the Precepts. Another day he dreamed again of visiting the Yan Court, again the place he had visited before. He saw ghostly soldiers holding iron rods and chains running and calling out, “May I ask, Immortal, to what place are you bound?” The disciple replied, “I have come wandering here, and dare not disturb the great King; I will now return.” The ghost soldier said, “The King has the rule that all immortals whose Precept practice is bright may first sit in the tea hall and give their name to be registered for inspection.” The disciple said, “I have no business and will take my leave.” Immediately he turned and suddenly left the scene, waking to relate this to the multitude. Formerly wandering he was beaten and cursed by ghosts; afterwards he knelt and was asked his name. This is truly the advance and retreat of a single heart, yet having two different appearances. Were it not for the repentance of past errors, it would remain as before. Seeing the spirit as the Way, the hidden and the manifest are one principle. How may one not be afraid? 

The multitude, time passes swiftly, and the nature of the heart must be bright. Do not wait until impermanence arrives and you walk in the darkness of the underworld, where the Ox-Head is not kind and the Horse-Face has no mercy. If you have faults, you must quickly amend them, all depending on exact Precept practice. Among the myriad dharmas and thousands of gates, the cultivation of the heart is the highest vehicle. The boundless and shoreless sea, follow the Precepts—the light of wisdom is bright.
