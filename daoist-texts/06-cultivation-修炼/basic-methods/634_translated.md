# Ten: The Equilibrium of Concentration and Wisdom

The great assembly, those who have but received the Initial True Precepts, may advance to receive the Intermediate Ultimate; first, having thoroughly practised the subtle and secret conduct of the ten Initial True Precepts, persevering in their diligent observance, then may they proceed to receive the three hundred great precepts of the Intermediate Ultimate. The great assembly, what distinction is there between the Intermediate Ultimate Precepts and the Initial True Precepts? The former forbids nothing; the latter truly knows no bounds. How is it that after the Initial True there is the Intermediate Ultimate, and after the Intermediate Ultimate there is the Celestial Transcendence? Why this order of precedence and sequence? The great assembly, this principle is indeed clear and easy to understand. I will draw this principle from the void and declare it unto you. Generally, the precepts you have received are the ten Initial True Precepts; these instruct you to restrain the corporeal body, to ride the wind and cleave the waves, forbidding frivolous movement and reckless wandering, the arising and ceasing of which is uncertain. The Intermediate Ultimate three hundred great precepts teach you to subdue the stubborn heart, forbidding wild imagining and wandering thoughts, the seven thoughts and eight intentions. The Celestial Transcendence subtle precepts teach you to liberate the true intent, forbidding attachment and clinging. The great assembly, the ten Initial True Precepts are coarse; the three hundred of the Intermediate Ultimate are refined. The Initial True Precepts govern the external six roots; the Intermediate Ultimate Precepts sweep away the internal six dusts; the Celestial Transcendence subtle precepts cause the three bodies to be freed, the eight consciousnesses to dissolve, and the nine demons and ten calamities to dare not intrude.

The great assembly, the Initial True Precepts arise because you have already awakened to your former faults, deeply pursued your old errors, and yet consider that life in the world is fleeting, that time is limited, that birth and death are uncertain. Having renounced the world and become Daoist priests, you call yourselves Quanzhen. But ponder carefully, from the time of renunciation till now, when have you truly been complete in your truth? The whole year you squander your days, and grow old just as the common people do. All day you wade through water and climb mountains, flee south and north; though you have paid respects to several famous mountains, and have seen more rocks and trees than the vulgar, yet in the end you are like worldly merchants and guests, engaged in trade and toil. Eating wind and lodging on water, what is the reason? When have you met immortals? The so-called secret instructions you repeat are all the ordinary men’s bargaining, the vulgar eyes and mortal frames; you recite the alchemical scriptures a few times, memorizing them in detail, called swallowing stones, yet you cannot transmute them, wholly lacking flavour. Thus you are no different from the common people, how can you transcend the world and surpass the ordinary? Having received the Initial True Precepts today, this mind that knows fault still retains its original form. Why not change the usual false heart into a true heart, the usual false intention into a true intention, the usual false visage into a true visage? Reveal your true heart and extend repentance. The day you receive the precepts call it the day you become a child of the Initial True Precepts. This Initial True Precept discipline observes the four great solemnities, dignifies the bodily form, but has no relation to the Dharma-body, and has nothing to do with concentration or wisdom. It is known that you are too restless and cannot be tranquil, so the ten precepts are made to subdue the body. If you can observe and maintain these precepts, then the body will be quiet and settled, and you may proceed to the Intermediate Ultimate Precepts.

The great assembly, the Intermediate Ultimate Precepts are the功 of concentration and differ from the Initial True Precepts. The Initial True is the character of Precept; the Intermediate Ultimate is the character of Concentration; the Celestial Transcendence Precepts are the character of Wisdom. At the beginning the Heavenly Lord, out of compassion for living beings, established these precepts, concentration, and wisdom, to subdue the body, mind, and intent; this功 is to transcend the world and surpass the ordinary, the golden elixir and precious treasure. Apart from these precepts, concentration, and wisdom, there is no other method. Though outside there may be eighty-four thousand methods, none can transcend these two words, concentration and wisdom. Relying on divine pills, taking elixirs, rising to heaven by day, levitating one’s dwelling, miraculous transformations, complete bodily liberation, instantaneous transformation and sitting dissolution, transmigration of souls and usurpation of bodies, and many other immortal arts, yet the light of concentration and wisdom stands unmoved. It illuminates these miraculous powers as a bright mirror in the courtyard; whatever goes out and comes in all shows its own form, and is still within concentration and wisdom, not beyond.

The great assembly, the character 中 (middle) of Intermediate Ultimate is the Heavenly Pivot of Doumu, firm and unmoving; the character 极 (extreme) is the Southern Pole that injects life, the Northern Pole that injects death, the utmost of birth and death, all depending on the silent movement of the handle of the Dipper, the spiritual pivot of the extreme. The two characters of Intermediate Ultimate hold the power of Heaven and Earth and grasp the handle of birth and death. The character 中 is neither internal nor external, neither left nor right, neither before nor behind, not偏 nor倚, neither excess nor deficiency, the true middle that faithfully holds the mean and attains harmony. Much speech exhausts itself; better is to hold to the middle. The gentleman walks the middle way, is upright and does not lean. The mysterious pearl and millet, the relics of Muni, the great ultimate golden elixir, and many other false names and titles in truth do not go beyond this subtle brightness and true nature that is void, spiritual, and unclouded. The great assembly, how is concentration and wisdom held in equipoise?

The great assembly, this point of spiritual mechanism has been entangled from beginningless time by the three karmas, besmeared by the six dusts, bewildered by the seven emotions, invaded and oppressed by the six desires, steamed by the three poisons, and overpowered by the ten demons. It secretly steals your spiritual mechanism; it dares not live though it would die; it dares not die though it would live. It cannot observe the Way of Heaven, nor grasp the course of Heaven. The great assembly, this point of spiritual mechanism is a precious Dharma-treasure, fit only to be reversed, not to be followed in sequence. If it be followed in sequence, it will move with things, be moved by circumstances, attract demons and assemble monsters, invite harm and calamity, enter and exit the wheel of rebirth, the four births and six paths, wandering and drifting. But those who receive the Intermediate Ultimate Precepts must reverse this course. Reversing means not conforming to the changes of all things, nor to the changes of all circumstances; demons, monsters, and calamities dare not violate it; the wheel of rebirth can be left; wandering can be surpassed. And what is called following the course? In the worldly law, to beget sons and raise daughters, to take wives and buy concubines, sons and grandsons, fathers and children, fame and wealth, to scramble for family and estate, to buy fields and lands, to wear fine clothes and silk, embroidered and with trains, to be greedy for lust and pleasure, to kill and harm life, to fill mouth and belly with fine food—these all are but the convenient enjoyment of the bodily form. This bodily form is originally earth, water, fire, and wind, artificially combined into the skin bag of man; by reason of the father’s essence and mother’s blood, copulation and lust, vital energies responding to one another, gathering blood and forming lumps, spirit-consciousness projecting and entering the spirit, settling the embryo and establishing life, all arise from the transformation of two energies into the body; ultimately impermanent and returning to the earth. Yet these two matters of功and罪 do not concern the bodily form but rather the Dharma-body which suffers.

Ah! The great assembly, those who do not believe say that the Dharma-body is originally within the bodily form; when the bodily form dies, the Dharma-body is already empty; when man dies, the spirit energy returns to emptiness and disperses; where, then, is there any talk of heaven and hell, hungry ghosts and beasts, Dharma-body receiving retribution? Now I ask you: when the human body dies and the spirit disperses and returns to emptiness, why do people’s parents afterwards, at the four seasons and eight festivals, set up sacrifices and offerings? If it be said that after death this spirit energy is not taken by the underworld to be examined and judged, the good and evil deeds, the fierce and gentle conduct, the debts, the plans, the killings, the thefts, and all manner of grievances committed in life, then this spirit energy would not come to receive offerings and sacrifices from the sons and grandsons of the world. If it does not come to enjoy the offerings and sacrifices of the world, then the ancient books of the Zhou rites should not fabricate so many sacrificial texts, vessels, ceremonies, and rites; Confucius the great sage should not say that to serve the dead is as to serve the living, to serve the departed is as to serve the present, to sacrifice is as to be present, to sacrifice to the gods is as if the gods are present; in Qi, bright and splendid garments are worn to perform sacrifices, as if the spirits were above, as if they were at the sides; the odes say the spirit’s nature is too deep for thought, King Wen is above, manifesting in Heaven. The great assembly, since this saying has been handed down, “as if above, King Wen is above,” my heart already holds the truth of ghosts and spirits coming. Since my heart already holds the sincerity of ghosts and spirits coming, then on that day the Duke of Zhou and Confucius and these great sages must have deeply known the condition and appearance of ghosts and spirits, and then established these sacrificial texts, vessels, ceremonies, and rites, to instruct thousands and hundreds of generations unto infinity. Is there a sage who utters falsehoods and lies and fabricates monsters? And now the officials and gentry who grant posthumous titles and official ranks and add grades, if after death the one spirit energy disperses and knows nothing, then the posthumous honours are already excessive. Who enjoys the golden plaques and purple edicts, the favours and ascent to heaven? If blessings bring ghosts and spirits and punishments bring none, then still this person’s mind lacks clarity, and his spiritual mechanism is not awakened. The first-class knaves and fools only know greed for wine and lust, bewildered by wealth and power, have not examined the root of karma after death, only recognize the present blood and breath, and compose a few lines of poetry chanting: “Do not think on endless affairs after death; drink up the cup of wine while alive.” Yet they do not chant the next two lines: “When the body is gone, all things do not follow; in the dark realm, only karma follows the person.”

The great assembly, karma has three kinds. The first karma is unwholesome karma, all its branches and leaves unbroken and unceasing, endless and inexhaustible karma, with cause and effect, with fruit and retribution. If one does not believe in ghosts and spirits, does not revere Heaven and Earth, is not afraid of law, is not loyal to the sovereign, is not filial to parents, has the three bonds disrupted, the five relations corrupted, slanders sages and worthies, kills, steals, is licentious, deceitful, cruel, reckless, brings fear upon the household, is bullied by the village—after death such fate falls into hell, hells shifting and flowing, enduring infinite suffering and retribution, then is born again in the yang world as a beast. After beast retribution, again is reborn human, but with incomplete senses, foolish and dark, unmindful of human affairs, hated by all, despised and loathed, the body engaged in menial service. Then again becomes a beggar, covered with sores and rot, foul, with lice and vermin, clothes not covering the body, food not filling the mouth, hungry and cold without complaint, suffering in myriad ways. Dies in the wilderness, eaten by ants and dragged by dogs, a faint and lonely soul, again sinking into hell. The second karma is wholesome karma: intelligent and upright, honest and fair, kin joyous, village peaceful, reverent to parents, reverent to spirits, respectful to Heaven and Earth, loyal to sovereign, respectful to elders, loving friends, pure in body and controlling desires, prudent with wealth, not greedy for beauty, five relations in order, all affairs proper. Including those in the mountains like Biqiu, old Daoists in caves, sweet and plain, enduring shame, concentration not firm, Dao practice incomplete; after death, they are reborn human, becoming officials and functionaries, teachers and honoured ones, enjoying present wealth and rank, receiving blessings of longevity, peace, and glory, a whole life of joy. The third karma is pure karma: aspiring to sages and worthies, hoping for immortals and Buddhas, heart holding good thoughts, speaking good words, acting good deeds, associating with good people, treading good land, holding good things, grave and dignified, body not moving recklessly, mind not wandering recklessly, seeking a clear mind, seeking a quiet mind, long and profound功, primordial spirit calm and settled, always residing in the vermilion chamber, within the Yellow Court, golden gates and jade halls, all desires suddenly ceased, all thoughts empty, only true spirit seen, forgetting form and matter, forgetting境 and機, this is called concentration; this is no trifling matter, but the realm of the Three Pure Ones, above surpassing the thirty-six heavens, below penetrating the seventy-two earths, roaming beyond the three realms, turning amid the five elements. This realm of concentration is dim and obscure, faint and silent, revolving Heaven and Earth, returning to chaos, forming one qi, above not Heaven, below not Earth, in the middle not man, unspeakable, unutterable, inconceivable; suddenly emits divine light, surges forth a wheel of wise nature. Separating the clear from the turbid as Heaven and Earth, the qi of harmony in principle is the Dharma-body. Wisdom pervades the three realms, bright and profound, no thing can escape its form and trace, no event unknown in its coming and going, no slightest obstacle, no thread of obstruction, no particle of dust. All heavenly dragons, ghosts, spirits, demons, and monsters all submit and take refuge. When King Yama sees this, he dares not raise his voice; ox-headed and night-wandering yakshas hold their fists and bow in submission. Holding thin, nameless death registers, with no surname in the death register, one may have long life in the world. One who teaches the Dharma and guides men may fly with divine wings and be transformed. Finally entering the pure void, attending the no-beginning court, forever escaping the wheel of rebirth.

The great assembly, the crucial turning of heavenly mechanism lies only between the motion and stillness of the true heart. Great stillness is called concentration power; true concentration is named wisdom light. If one does not first die to the false mind, calm the spirit, and settle the qi, how can one obtain great concentration? If one cannot be constantly clear and tranquil, how can one enter concentration? If one cannot enter concentration, how can one obtain living wisdom? The great assembly, when the heart is empty, then the spirit is settled; when the spirit is settled, then light is born. If there be concentration without wisdom, this is called the yin spirit surpassing the yang spirit. It is necessary that wisdom arise within concentration. Wisdom is the Dharma-body; concentration is the Buddha. The great assembly, concentration is home, precepts are the path, wisdom is the living person; all things, all circumstances, and all affairs in the world are but guests. If concentration and wisdom mutually generate and arise, entering the manifold wondrous gates, then the spirit and wisdom of the true Lord is long nourished and sufficient, manifesting light. Able to respond to all things and affairs, yet not bound by all things and affairs; able to turn the myriad realms of the world, yet not bewildered by the myriad realms; able to transcend yin and yang, birth and death, and the wheel of rebirth. The great assembly, first you must understand the two paths of guilt and blessing, cause and effect and retribution; according to the precepts observe one by one, not daring in the slightest to transgress. When the understanding is deepened, naturally you become clear and tranquil. Then proceed to enter quiet observation and concentration. Within concentration the original nature is perfect and bright, the wisdom light shining clearly; the spirit and qi suddenly become spiritually enlightened. Then mountains, rivers, and earth are not outside the body; all things, birth and death, do not transcend a single thought. From the true Lord's spiritual brightness comes a handle whereby one does not enter the wheel of rebirth. This功 of the middle character cannot be done by father and son; spirits and ghosts cannot know it; only by your own individual practice. The great assembly, I set up the Heavenly Ladder firm and fixed; I know not who shall ascend the Heavenly Ladder; the Dao raft is pushed forward; I know not who shall board the Dao raft. Hear the words of the poor Daoist’s verse: “The River of Love is vast and wide, no one crosses; the Sea of Suffering is boundless, few bridges of Dharma. Great assembly, speedily hold the three hundred precepts; with ease, concentration and wisdom cross the billows.”
