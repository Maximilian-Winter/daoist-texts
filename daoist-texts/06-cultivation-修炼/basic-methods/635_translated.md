# Secret Practice of Cultivating Reality

My friends, since you have vowed to cultivate Reality, and desire to be perfect Taoist adepts, you must clearly distinguish between true and false, understand them thoroughly, and then go to work. To exert oneself to change the false into the true — this is the business proper to the cultivator.

My friends, hear me speak of the false, that you may diligently cultivate the true. Your body is all false, called the phantom form of impermanence; the six roots must come to ruin, the six consciousnesses at last return to emptiness; the throat breath serves a thousand uses, but once impermanence comes, all things cease. Have you not seen men of the world, nine feet tall, their waist ten spans round? Faces like full moons, lips like vermilion dots; eyes like black lacquer, skin like soft fat; countenances dignified, awe-inspiring in their majesty; able to speak and reason, full of wisdom and cunning; a thousand stratagems, myriad devices; clever in letters, strong in arms; high officials and fierce generals, skilled artisans and men of talent; engaged in trade and business, contending for profit and fame; greedy for glory and display, amassing wealth to build their homes; beneath painted halls twelve golden beauties, their voices and music; on jade steps, three thousand bejeweled slippers, advancing and retreating with courtesy; gold and silver surpassing the Northern Dipper, treasures like the Southern Mountains; jade food and brocade robes, at their table a hundred delicacies; mingling with the mighty and chivalrous, everywhere observing multifarious proprieties; wives half-grown old cast aside for new; concubines in crowds, forgetting spirit and exhausting essence; household riches abundant, ten thousand acres of good fields planted as foundation; children high and distinguished, official ranks of first grade yet deemed too low; day and night unceasing, enamoured of flowers and beauty; desire, greed, aversion, weariness of body and mind; heat, damp, wind, cold, six pulses of yin and yang in disorder; driven hard in pursuit, three souls scattered and flying; a hundred ailments attacking, birth, aging, sickness and pain; a thousand calamities unescaped, fatigue and languor; taking ginseng and poria to no avail, calling on Heaven and Earth without response; a thousand pains too numerous for speech, one morning the breath breaks and falls to the nether world. Though countenance dignified, before the turning point men cover their noses; though awe-inspiring, once the eyes close the face turns to Heaven. Limbs folded, one lies in a wooden coffin, one likeness only on the painted board; children do not come to replace the dead, wives and concubines do not accompany; the corpse not yet cold, the living’s thoughts are already born; brothers divide the property and fight for wealth; wives and concubines hide treasure and fine clothes. Those with sons think how to live on; those without sons think how to marry others’ sons. Guests and horses at the gate become scarce; the saying goes, “Man is man by human feeling;” servants at home steal, and they say, “When power fails, slaves oppress.” Walls and doors fallen, who will care? Family fortunes dissipated, who knows? Wives immoral, children unfilial, each looks after their own future. How many have died and come to life? Who has gone and returned? Born into the world empty-handed, dead one leaves still bare-handed. The colored body enters the earth, the name returns to emptiness; good and evil are two roads, clearly receiving their reward.

My friends, look upon these forms and appearances of the phantom; are they not false? Yet though false, those who arise desirous of wealth and rank, wives and concubines, love of children and grandchildren, receiving glory and enjoying riches — a little true spirit there is indeed, not false. See where this little true spirit goes — manifestly it abides in darkness. If it is manifestly in darkness, why then continue to desire wives and concubines, children and grandchildren, riches and glory? My friends, these two causes of good and evil, the two retributions of guilt and blessing, the two fruits of pain and joy, are as truly inseparable as shadow and form. The colored body suffers pain and punishment; not one drop escapes. Therefore you must hold the body lightly, value the Dharma body, use the false to cultivate the true, preserve the true and abandon the false, in order to seek release from the sea of suffering. Yet without this colored body, there is no place for cultivation; then the one spirit Dharma body cannot be master of itself, but will fall into the sixfold cycle of rebirth and become entangled. Having received the human body, having entered the path, you must liberate yourself from the cycle of rebirth, while your eyesight has not dimmed, diligently cultivate Reality.

How shall this cultivation be? My friends, you must sweep clean the dust from the six sense gates, harmonize the five organs and five vital airs, keep the master ever abiding on the spiritual platform, so that demons and thieves cannot invade; practise many good deeds, uproot the root of sin.

But in this cultivation of Reality there are two paths; among these two paths, there is the true and the false, the conditioned and the unconditioned. The Diamond Sutra says: "All conditioned dharmas are like a dream, an illusion, a bubble, a shadow, like dew or a flash of lightning." The Scripture of Purity says: "The reason why sentient beings do not attain the true Way is because of the deluded mind." From these two scriptures we learn that the conditioned path of cultivation is not good. Yet there is a school which moves the essence and circulates the qi, connects life and death, reverses old age and returns youth, and attains longevity and immortality, practising according to appearances. Another employs ascending lead and descending mercury, beating cauldrons and burning herbs, taking elixirs, swallowing talismans and consuming qi. These all count as using the false to cultivate the true; all are conditioned, various false methods. How can they reveal the nature, establish destiny, and liberate from the cycle of rebirth? To be born beyond death is surely not attained in such ways.

My friends, to use the false to cultivate the true, you must examine thoroughly the great matters of birth and death, and clearly comprehend the genuine path. Where is this path? It is in the one mind of yours, whether it obey or rebel. If obey, then it is by others’ will; if rebel, then by mine own. The colored body of man, whether cultivated or not, must die; even if it live a thousand years, it will return to the earth — why then come? My friends, where form exists, there is decay; where there is a beginning, there is an end; where there is production, there is transformation; where there is gathering, there is scattering; where there is coming, there is going; where there is success, there is failure; where there is strength, there is old age. Since this body is born, it must naturally die. The birth and death I speak of have nothing to do with this body; it is only used as a lodging-place, to cultivate my heavenly destiny Dharma body. The heterodox do not understand this principle; they take the body for real, cling to appearances, seeking to make the flesh and blood body imperishable and immortal — is not that greatly ridiculous? The birth and death I speak of lie only in the true mind within the body, in the thoughts that arise, in the deeds performed. When deluded thoughts do not move, the Dharma body arises; when the Dharma body is at rest, heavenly mechanism stirs; when heavenly mechanism stirs, true light is revealed. The true light is not fully perfect, and so by means of this colored body many good deeds are done. Good deeds too have the true and the false; attachment to appearance is false, non-attachment to appearance is true. See how the Tathagata gives alms without attachment to form, merits without attachment to form, preaches the Dharma without attachment to form, cultivates the Way without attachment to form. Not being attached to form, he is able to transcend the world; being able to transcend the world, he is able to be born beyond death. The Scripture of Purity says: "The highest virtue is not virtue." This is non-attachment; if not so, there is no liberation — how then escape birth and death? Only a few years more of life and some measure of blessing. When the blessings are exhausted, still one cannot transcend the cycle of rebirth. My friends, I advise you to follow the highest teaching, that you may not err: first let go of the body while the body yet abides; last let go of the body while the body goes first; thus you may die and not perish. My friends, put the body aside; do not be anxious to sway essence and move qi, to covet the rising and falling of vital energies, the opening of orifices, the circulation of blood and vessels, to prolong life and cure disease. Love of these things makes you regard the colored body as firm and secure, enjoying freedom and ease. Yet in vain do you neglect your true nature, not caring for it day and night. You know not that one day, when the little demons come for you unawares, they will suddenly seize you; then where will your Dharma body be, tossed on the waves? Your colored body must return to the grave; all will be vain indeed. I entreat you, my friends, to diligently practise patience and subdued mind, to early see your nature; how then shall you fear that your destiny will not be established? My friends, I remind you, the colored body is a house; the Dharma body is the owner of the house. If the owner has treasure, why fear that the house should not be orderly? If the owner is sick or ill, or draws misfortune and calamity and is seized away, then who shall dwell in that orderly house? To explain further, that you may awaken: the colored body is a rented house, not bought; when the owner departs, it returns to the earth, the four elements dispersing and returning to the four great elements. If you can diligently cultivate a true Dharma body free from attachment, why then fear that the colored body shall not be settled in a good place?

My friends, I have a few clumsy verses, listen as I speak:  
"The colored body is originally the Dharma body’s house,  
When the inner light is bright the outer shines of itself.  
Only wish that the owner cultivate blessing and wisdom,  
Would that the house were not then without splendour.  
To be perfect Taoist one must first remove falsehood,  
True Dharma must cast away false Dharma and delusion.  
Do not boast or cling to form,  
Cultivate nature and destiny, transcend impermanence.  
Only by calming the mind seek liberation,  
Let go the phantom body and be your true self.  
Greedy for life, fearing death, must die at last,  
Clinging to form, how can true cultivation be true?  
The Tathagata cut off body and limbs,  
The Jade Emperor once bore humiliation.  
For three thousand kalpas abandoned body and life,  
Leaving the kingdom to dwell in the mountains for eight hundred decades.  
Taoists cling to their false skins,  
Through ten thousand kalpas and thousand lives still not freed from dust.  
Do not use mind in vain, do not waste spirit,  
The formed body must return to yin at last.  
If still lost to your true suchness nature,  
In boundless sea of suffering there is no place to seek.  
Ah, pity! False upon false, layer upon layer,  
In vain to study perfection and obtain Reality.  
Birth, aging, sickness, demons, grief, death and pain,  
At death how different from worldly men?  
Wearing yellow crowns and feathered robes in vain,  
Have they ever known the secret of life and death?  
Seeking food and clothing running the ends of the earth,  
Sin and karma close at hand, men turn to dust."  

If you do not understand that guilt and blessing are originally empty, then the cycle of birth and death will not cease; if you have not awakened to the original false and true in yourself, who will open the light of wisdom?

My friends, each consider and reflect: birth and death are impermanent and swift. The secret practice I speak of consists of three hundred rules, the Great Precepts of the Middle Perfection, three hundred subtle details. By cultivating the body, the body becomes upright; by cultivating the mind, deluded thoughts cease and are forgotten. Inner use is sage, outer use is king; thus you may transcend the world and surpass the ordinary, attain the fruit of pure emptiness, save others and bring them out of suffering, and end the cycle of birth and death. The first and foremost is the word secret; if not secret, then not perfect Reality; if not perfect Reality, the mind is not clear; if the mind is not clear, nature is not seen. My friends, how to be secret? The sages use this to wash the heart and retire, hiding in secrecy. Secrecy is utmost vigilance. Perfect secrecy is hidden in concealment, the utmost of secrecy. My friends, all who would receive the Great Precepts of the Middle Perfection — from the first precept to the hundredth — these are the great mantras for purifying the body. Carefully practise and hold these mantras. It is necessary that all restlessness of the body be removed, becoming clear and still; all recklessness removed, becoming steady and grave. In the four great dignified postures, when walking one must walk by the middle way; when sitting not lean to one side; when standing be upright, not allowed to lean on walls or pillars, to lean on walls or tables; when lying down bend the body sideways, not allowed to lie face upward and snore. Even if the breath makes the faintest sound, adjustment is needed to cultivate a respectful and courteous appearance, called external dignity. From the hundredth to the two hundredth precept these are the great mantras for purifying the mind. Contemplate these mantras with care united with the Way; diligently study and secretly awaken. Every thought returns to the true; every word concords with the Way; no word is relaxed; contemplate again and again, awaken again and again; from afar observe things, near take from the body; driving out all wildness and perversity of mind completely. When the true mind is serene and settled, then from two hundredth to three hundredth precept are the great mantras for purifying the intention, not allowing the slightest slip. Within are the secrets of the subtle message, the principles of coming and going, the hidden storehouse of the mysterious capital, obscure, subtle and wonderful, incomprehensible and inconceivable, revealed by divine insight, not to be spoken, the highest and most venerable ineffable Way revealed.

My friends, this is the secret work of cultivating Reality. Listen once more carefully and remember: the supreme Way must never be divulged. My friends, originally to cultivate Reality and to escape birth and death is no ordinary matter. If heavenly secrets are not secret, but are leaked to robbers, then the Purple Sun Zhang True Man and Lan, transmitted to robbers, suffered thrice the heavenly punishment; thus it must not be divulged. How much less can one, to surpass the cycle of rebirth and leap out of the world, to become a True Man imperishable through ten thousand kalpas, not be hated by Heaven and Earth and spirits, and abhorred by yin and yang and creation? Moreover, your going against the current and contrary to the world’s laws is like ice and fire. You must be cautious and thorough; otherwise your six relatives will not rejoice, your nine clans become enemies, your wife and children are not affectionate, your friends do not trust you, all because you have not manifested a mighty and courageous spirit, and thus have the heart to abandon the Way.
