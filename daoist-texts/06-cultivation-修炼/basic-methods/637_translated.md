# The Establishing of Aspiration and the Making of Vows

My friends, from ancient times the sages, immortals, and Buddhas, having seen through the affairs of the world and all that is wrought, have known that all forms whatsoever are but illusions. They have therefore desired to transcend the world and surpass the common lot, to understand the riddles of birth and death, to enter deeply into the mountains and forests, to forget the body and perish in life, all for the sake of seeking the ultimate Way.

My friends, you know only the names of sages, immortals, and Buddhas, but you do not know their true reality; you all have the heart to become sages and Buddhas, but you have not truly established their resolve; you all desire to attain the fruit of sages and Buddhas, but you do not cultivate the causes of sages and Buddhas; you always aim to reach the position of sages and Buddhas, yet do not issue the vow-power of sages and Buddhas. Thus, though you speak, you do not act; this is because your mouth is clear but your heart is not. The obscurity of the Way consists in not encountering those who understand the Way; the failure to walk the Way lies in not finding those who practise it. He who is called a "man of the Way"—has he ever known the essence and subtlety of such a man? He who is called "Perfect and True"—who indeed practises the reality of the Perfect and True? No wonder that the gate of filial piety is in decay, and the ancestral Way is withering. Now that you have taken refuge in the Three Jewels and embraced the precepts, you may be said to have met those who understand the Way. But you must follow my true words, to practise the affairs of sages, immortals, and Buddhas; then you may be called men who walk the Way.

My friends, before sages, immortals, and Buddhas have attained the Way, they were all like you, common men, without extra eyes or hands. Only because they could establish aspiration, seeking the method to transcend the world, and discerning the mechanism of birth and death, their spirit became a hundredfold brighter and their breadth immeasurable. Though their bodies were still those of men, their thoughts already possessed a saintly form. But the sage does not outwardly profess to transcend the world without having truly kept it in his heart; he really preserves it and acts according to the matter of transcendence. Therefore he is called one of great heroic strength, possessing a heart of great compassion. A great man, a teacher of Heaven and men, is always one who, by establishing aspiration, becomes extraordinary. His deeds are no small affairs; with roaring vigour, a wise sword across his shoulder, his eyebrows raised like flashing lightning; with majestic dignity, a precept-knife at his neck, his eyes open and moving like thunder. The hearts of those of external doctrines are chilled and flee afar; the evil winds make the cowardly tremble and all long to take refuge. He climbs the nine-ranked lotus platform and ascends straight to the throne of the Dharma King. His spoken words and sounds are heard as pure Dharma sounds; all the heavenly beings are as if anointed on the head with the best nectar. His body emits fragrant Brahma breath; all who see it obtain universal liberation. He causes innumerable multitudes to be like a river of butter and milk. Having attained the Way, his great aspiration fulfilled, he issues great vows: not desiring the marks of a person, self or others, nor the marks of longevity; not desiring to save himself, but only to save others; using the method of self-salvation to universally save all beings, and not with a heart of self-salvation to reproach beings. He takes the hearts of the common people as his own heart. The common people are another name for beings; beings are my own kindred. Using the method for my kindred, to save my kindred men. If one does not save beings, he does not desire to attain the Way. The Scripture of Purity says: "Though named as having attained the Way, he really has nothing to obtain; for the sake of transforming beings, he is called to have attained the Way. He who can understand this may transmit the holy Way."

My friends, sages, immortals, and Buddhas differ not from men. Their difference lies only in the words "public" and "private." The sage is but upright and magnanimous, acting for others, not for himself; the common man is but partial and false, acting for himself, not for others. The sage is but clear and tranquil; the common man is but turbid, dark, and restless. The sage uses firmness inwardly to govern the body, and gentleness outwardly to win over men; the common man uses gentleness inwardly to forgive himself, and firmness outwardly to blame others. The sage is ever fearful of his own faults; the common man only blames the faults of others. The sage, whatever position he occupies, is always careful and attentive; the common man, whatever danger he undertakes, is careless and negligent. The sage never dies without first discerning the mechanism after death; the common man dies before him, yet still only seeks sustenance. The sage desires the method of transcendence, refining the worldly methods in his heart; as a son, he fulfils filial duty; as a minister, he is loyal; the common man neither knows the method of transcendence nor even the worldly law, how then can he know loyalty to sovereign or filial piety to parents? Pitiable are these bewildered and unenlightened multitudes, who know neither worldly law nor the law beyond the world. Drunken all day and dreaming all night, living a life of vanity and waste, born in the morning and dead at evening, stealing life and fearing death, blind in birth and blind in death. They lose the little true spiritual principle within their foul skins; wandering through countless kalpas, unknown and confused, turning and twisting, changing faces and heads, revolving endlessly, not knowing when they may find an end.

My friends, having taken the precepts, you have already broken through. Having broken through, you can break through suffering. Having broken through suffering, you can break through the world. My friends, to break through suffering, first you must endure suffering. Without enduring suffering, it is difficult to break through suffering. You must rely on the true words of sages, immortals, and Buddhas, not seek their empty fame. You must establish the aspiration of sages, immortals, and Buddhas; do not speak idly of their fruit. You must plant the root of sages, immortals, and Buddhas, and naturally there will be their recompense. You must accumulate the virtue of sages, immortals, and Buddhas, and naturally attain their Way. You must practise the affairs of sages, immortals, and Buddhas, and naturally verify their position. If you act heedless of your words, speaking beyond the truth, you are but an unprogressive common man. To vainly dream of the Way of sages and Buddhas—is this the path of one without aspiration?

My friends! You must establish a great aspiration and issue great vows, then you may transcend the world. Thus the verse says:

> Hear my words, O children of the precepts, and with aspiration sever birth and death;  
> First endure suffering to govern body and mind,  
> When suffering is ended, sweetness comes, death again is life.  
> From the heart establish aspiration, removing dust and ashes;  
> Transcend worldly passions and reverse their course.  
> Firmly grasp the Dipper’s handle, standing lofty and unshaken,  
> Unmoving in true emptiness, upon the white jade platform.  
> Neither seek to become an external way by action,  
> Nor be deluded by the different doctrines of non-action;  
> Neither non-being nor being alone, in wishes harmonize,  
> Neither having nor not having, cultivate awakening and illumination.

> Attachments bind like cords and ropes.  
> You must dig up and sever the root of attachments,  
> Cut all sprouts and board the supreme Dharma boat.  
> Resolve not to be swayed by wild and base companions,  
> Base companions and wild men have short hearts.

My friends, the bitter aspiration established, the great vows issued, I have now instructed you one by one, admonishing you act and act again. You who are the high disciples of the transmission of the Way, the immortals who explain the sectarian customs, the spiritual children who continue the vein of the Way, the men of the Way who break through heaven’s barriers, in the ten continents and three islands, all have heard, all have come to know. Each one should consider and early prepare a worthy aspiration for cultivation; it is to your benefit. Ah! If this body is not liberated in this life, in what life shall it be liberated? Time flies like an arrow, the sun and moon like a shuttle; since your leaving home until now, you have delayed the years, wasted the time; hair is white as frost, skin wrinkled, teeth falling one by one, sinews stiff and skin loose. Alas! When the bones grow soft, one cannot travel far; when the blood is exhausted, strength cannot be sustained. The essence is dried and the kidneys fail, and the two eyes become dim; the spirit weary and the heart wild, one spirit unstable. The soul fades and the faculties weaken, the two ears droop and listen; the stomach strong but the spleen weak, food gradually declines. My friends, you must know that this body is originally illusion; however firm it may be, there is always the day of death, only differing in sooner or later. Like this deafness of ears, darkness of eyes, dryness of tongue and mouth, falling and loose teeth, back pains and bent spine, white hair and shrivelled temples, stiffened sinews and bones, numb hands and feet, shortened aspiration, cooled heart and frozen thought—all are the summons sent by Yama, awaiting early arrival. You must not only indulge your wife’s kind heart, tofu business, short-sighted views, and beastly delusions; only care for the present, not for the next life. If today the ghost comes to take you, you cannot endure it and must go. How can you be called a man of the Way, one who has left home and renounced the world? Can you avoid it, escape it? Why not see through it carefully and liberate yourself early? To act with sure step and withdraw the hand, then you are truly a great man, a rare man. Establish aspiration, have method, leave home and cultivate. Otherwise, your mind will be timid and your face soft and slack. The four great elements—wind, fire, earth, water—each rushes and scatters; the senses and hearing of a lifetime are scattered. Babbling, drifting, wandering, floating, you sink down into hell. Ah! My friends, to cultivate without establishing aspiration is like a puppet show, with drums and gongs finished, whither will you go? Only by establishing aspiration can one transcend the world; without aspiration and vow, it is exceedingly difficult. Only by establishing aspiration and cultivating the true Way can the mighty spirit not be common.
