# Verification and Efficacy of the Seal

All you disciples who seek to cultivate the wondrous Way of purity, tranquillity, non-action, and self-sovereignty, must possess a fixed resolve, and become those who are at ease with themselves. If one’s ease of conduct be attainable, then the Way of Nature is therein contained. But if ease of conduct be unattainable, can such a person be said to have attained to Nature? When one cannot complete the affairs of the world, how can he be at ease?

The immortal masters have said: “If you would cultivate the Immortal Way, first cultivate the human way. Until the human way is cultivated, the Immortal Way is afar off.” The Confucian teaching says: “First regulate the family; then you may govern the state.” The regulation of the family is like the human way; the governance of the state is like the Immortal Way. If the family cannot be regulated, how can the state be governed? The Buddhists say: “One must exhaust the worldly mind; there is no other sage understanding.” This worldly mind is the principle of the three bonds and five constants; if one acts according to these and completes them, then the human way is perfected, and the cultivation of immortality is not difficult. Though one may not become a sage, a true immortal, or a Buddha, it will be easy enough to attain.

How then does one advance in cultivating the Immortal Way? You disciples, when you enter the Mysterious Gate, learn to be Taoists, bow to your masters and receive the secret instructions, you then sit in meditation, quiet your hearts, and fancy that the human way of the common world has been exhausted, and that the Immortal Way is near at hand. Little do you know that your reverence for your master’s person is not yet complete; the transmitted secret formulas are obscure and hard to comprehend; yet you are eager to strike at the void. As soon as you begin, you seek efficacy. You sit for three days or two days; seeing no progress, you abandon it. Then you go to another master, obtain a few words of instruction, and again sit. This longing for the Way never lasts two or three days before you seek efficacy again; your thoughts cannot even be restrained. Such a mind is confused, with shallow intelligence; your meagre cultivation is vain; a thousand thoughts arise, your spirit cannot rest; it is but a dream. After sitting twenty or thirty years, you remain but ordinary men. When death comes, you are still unaware. Alas! You have wasted your time, prolonged the years in vain; like fishing for the moon in the water, or grasping flowers in a mirror, you have taken things to be easy. Where is the principle of ready-made immortals? You pitiable ones, deceived by blind masters and deluded by heterodox ways, I will no longer proclaim. I only exhort you to hold fast to the chapter on precepts and conduct, set your resolve on repaying kindness, and repeatedly examine and correct your thoughts, removing vexation and ignorance. With one heart turn to the Way, take refuge in the Three Treasures, recite the True Scriptures, act according to the precepts, and sit in the hall of the ten directions one hundred days. Your outward appearance will be solemn and grave; your body steady and dignified; nothing disturbed; all matters orderly. Then, rising and performing ceremony, you may invoke the True Master, vow not to learn the inferior vehicles, sincerely take refuge and wish to hear the unsurpassed, supreme, true, great vehicle of purity, liberation, and naturalness; to comprehend birth and death and escape forever from samsara. Only then may you receive the initial ten true precepts.

All you people, if it be thus, the Way first changes the temperament and disposition. Having heard the Way, then you may ascend the meditation cushion, quiet your mind, cease thought, forget emotion, apply your heart and mind, and abandon worldly matters. Receive the three hundred great precepts of the middle and highest degree, carefully contemplate them, understand them thoroughly and exhaustively, and you will know that the great cause and condition are only within the body, not outside the heart. Penetrate deeply and truly in secrecy, perform the wondrous practice and attain perfection; the seal confirms the void and naturalness; having reached the highest pinnacle, there is still progress. Do not distort what is straight, nor foolishly dispute. Having recognised some Taoist temples or obtained a hut or monastery, taken in one or two disciples, you become content and arrogant, neglecting precepts, concentration, and wisdom. You do not emulate the strict precept masters, whose solemn bearing and rigorous discipline are meticulous, nor do you associate harmoniously with fellow disciples. Illiterate, half-ignorant, not yet transformed, you arrogantly declare to others that your cultivation is of the highest grade. You take a fan, write a few alchemical words, hang a pouch, fill it with a few alchemical scriptures, contrive many gourds, gather many herbs within, and cheat common folk of their money, claiming to teach the secret sea alchemy formulas; with the silver you buy wine and meat. Your mouth is full of wild talk; the pulse and principle of yin and yang you do not comprehend; you seize at random a few prescriptions and falsely claim to have achieved功夫.

All day long you chatter idly, talking of heaven and earth, running east and west, seeking clothes and food. You corrupt the highest sacred methods and defile the perfect true name. Those who break precepts and violate the law are seeds of sin; in the future, their evil will be full, and the celestial registers shall punish them; they will fall forever into hell. Alas, such is pitiable and grievous! Another kind are those who have just entered the Way; their resolve is small and their wish narrow; they only seek to sit in meditation for ease, unwilling to humble their hearts and submit their breath; unwilling to cut off love and sever passion, they merely drag on, clinging to appearances and attachments. They only seek功夫 and efficacy, moving qi and transferring essence, opening orifices in confusion, mistaking thieves for sons, and remain unenlightened for long. Unwilling to seek verification with an open mind, to observe and carefully examine, their illusions ripen to maturity, making them beyond help; many harm themselves and claim their fate, falling into samsara. To regard the Infinite Great Way as but a lump of flesh and blood; to mistake the knowing spirit for the primal spirit and follow it whithersoever it turns—is this how one can understand birth and death?

All you disciples, you must heed my words, utterly sweep away these heterodox doctrines and evil methods, cast them boldly aside. Temper your body, heart, and mind within the nature of heavenly destiny. Beware of coveting immediate efficacy; only seek to penetrate in your heart. If you have the resolve to pursue this single heart unwaveringly, even a wall of bronze and iron you will break through; naturally there will be a day of emergence, a time when the fruit ripens and the core falls away, and your spirit will suddenly awaken, comprehending heaven and earth. If your blessings be slight and conditions shallow, you must accumulate virtue and功德, be brave and diligent. Perhaps you will not awaken in this life, but will in the next; or not awaken in the next, but in a thousand or ten thousand lives eventually one awakening cannot be missed. Set down this resolve; the mind to realize the Way shall never retreat; surely you will be a sage of great compassion and great vow, and finally attain the Way. Yet great blessings are easy to cultivate, clear blessings difficult. You who aspire to the transcendental Way—this is the true Way, not the heterodox that seek to refine breath and cook essence, or to attain eternal life. Those are ghosts who guard mountains and corpses for ten thousand generations. This Way of Infinite Purity and Tranquillity requires no haste, no seeking of near功夫, no fixed term of three years or nine years; it centres only on the seeing of one’s nature. Efficacies occur daily and hourly, moistening the mouth sweetly, strengthening hands and feet, bringing forth a round image upon the head, opening the Heavenly Gate of the brain, steaming the fire in the belly, the bones resounding throughout the body. Yet these are功夫 of the low and middle cultivation; one must step by step return to the Way-body. For the Way is originally utmost emptiness, its essence utmost non-existence, hence infinite. If功夫 lose their proper direction, and one regards apparent gain as true gain, this is heterodoxy, and even the slightest error leads astray by a thousand li.

As for those who cling to names and grasp appearances, who fix on what to protect, who erect tripods, ascend lead at midnight, lower mercury at noon, advance yang fire, retreat yin talisman, practice according to hexagrams and take efficacy by the hour—those who do not recognise the return to the Way-body are all lower vehicles and lesser ways. But true purity and non-action is the wondrous Way of natural return, entirely unlike these. Suppose the Imperial Canon, forming your heart and setting your resolve, swearing to transcend the mundane, this original mind is like a jade maiden releasing fragrance. When the heart’s fragrance is released, it revives the six paths; all who hear this fragrance universally attain liberation. This releasing of fragrance is功夫; this hearing of fragrance is efficacy. Again, like the Jade Emperor emitting light, all the heavens and all the earth, the Infinite Worlds, are absorbed into that light, like a boundless bright mirror mutually containing each other; this is efficacy. Again, to cut off obstructions is功夫; the seventeen lights and thirty kinds of功德 are efficacy. The merits and retributions are the efficacy of the reciters’ sins and blessings. If you were previously frivolous and rash, your tongue unrestrained—mere nonsense; your hands restless—only busywork; your feet never still—only blind wandering; your sitting unstable—only crookedness; your sleep uneasy—frequent tossing; your eyes wide and gaping, looking east and west, running here and there like a gust of wind—this does not resemble the conduct of one cultivating the Way. Like an ox unyoked and a horse without a bridle, not following the proper middle path.

Now having taken precepts, put on the surplice and mitre, carry the alms bowl and wear the shoes, your body assume the appearance of a perfect true one; learning from others, hearing their words and seeing their example; discarding former coarseness and haste, learning to be composed and courteous—this is the功夫 of holding precepts. Transform your temperament and disposition; change to the appearance of the Way; so that men when they see you will rise in respect—this is the outward sign of holding precepts. If you can hold to wondrous conduct, think carefully and harmonize with the Way, only seeking to illuminate the mind and see the nature, without seeking efficacy, only fearing that功夫 be insufficient and not fearing that efficacy be absent, naturally when the great time ripens there will be one ultimate awakening. But if your conduct be not secret and profound, but only two or three thoughts, interrupted by doubts, your mind not true then your spirit not responsive; your thoughts not pure then your qi not gathered; your spirit wandering and qi floating; your thoughts not close—how can efficacy arise?

You today, since you have great resolve to escape samsara, open your measure somewhat; focus on功夫, let efficacy come later—that is wondrous. Like a skilled physician administering medicine, harmony is the goal; an inept doctor seeks quick effect, regardless of root cause, only seeking early efficacy; seeing near effect, but ultimately injuring the primal qi; the original root is temporarily lost; ailments become many and varied; the patient knows not and regrets too late.

All you people, if morning and evening you act according to the precepts and cultivation methods, always mindful, ever seeking, how should you fear lack of efficacy? Yet though your chest may become broad and your eyes clear, you must also cultivate a tranquil mind, approach the virtuous, and then you will attain high understanding. Never be attached to the self-image and forget the image of others; nor be attached to the image of others and forget the self-image. If neither of these two minds arise, all four appearances are empty, and virtue, blessing, and efficacy will naturally follow.

All you people, cultivation of the Way depends wholly on one point of mind; the mind true and the thought earnest, the Way close at hand. If thus you understand that the mind is empty and still, where is there功夫 that will not be efficacious? The mind must be cold, the thought grey; cold ash draws forth the majestic fire. The true fire qi can illuminate things; like the sun shining in the heavens. Hold the功夫 of precepts strictly and closely; in concentration efficacy appears and wisdom shines forth. Inside the millet grain contains heaven and earth; to speak of this to others is folly. Disciples, listen carefully to these words of the Dharma; how can a careless and frivolous mind become immortal? Quickly comply with precepts and cultivate功夫; resolute in resolve, firm in heart, cut off wandering thoughts; secretly cultivate deeply in the mountains, close the gate of the mountain and let the mind be not coarse. All appearances are empty and the mind again quiet; neither of the two minds arise, the Way and harmony unite. Now I reveal to you the celestial secret: seeing功夫 depends only on the application of the mind. Diligent功夫 and hard cultivation are very efficacious; every moment and every hour be secret and deep. Inner quietude and reflection are your own; permit not others to know even a little. Attach not your mind to many states; this is the time of great awakening in the heart. The foolish cat guards its den, moving in ignorance; deluded thoughts give birth to the sacred infant. When will Golden Elder ride the blue tiger? To whose family will Wooden Mother mount the white dragon? The summit manifests three splendid lights shining brightly; the body contains the five qi surging vigorously. Pity those who know not true messages and close the spirit platform, their nature unopened. I say to you, do not revile the precepts as low; precepts are the foundation of non-action and the entering of the Way. They are the raft that crosses the waves, the ladder that ascends to heaven. Boast not of your own pride and arrogance; revile not others with their distinctions of right and wrong. If you do not accept the proper time, what need is there to obstruct and disturb others with doubt? Praise with the mouth and joy in the heart—these are the means to raise the mysterious and protect the teaching. If you utter slander and bring down heavenly doom, cause and effect from the beginning is true indeed. Hah! Let the good alone and do not act; let the good words alone and do not speak; let the great Way alone and do not cultivate; only contrive cleverness to cause harm; not cultivate precepts, concentration, and practice—how can you obtain the highest teacher’s robe? If you do not cultivate both blessing and wisdom, how can you obtain liberation of body and mind? If you do not understand the principle and act blindly, how can you remove the knots of the mind? If you do not remove obstacles and ignorance, how can your mind and measure be broad? Many sins are less than few sins; disorderly speech is worse than no speech. The supreme Way differs from the outer ways; allow not yourself to talk lightly and play with your tongue. Everywhere formulas are sold for money; the merits and retributions are clear and manifest. If thus you are confused and do not awaken, in the future you will have death without life; turning around you become swine and sheep, your karma reaped and slaughtered by others. You cannot escape the inspection of heaven and earth, the five decrees and three origins. You must know that sun and moon, yin and yang, are not muddled ink and blackness. Nature clearly reveals the lost; all know this in their heart, and do not revile or blame.

With deep pity and compassion I exhort you: take refuge early in the three thousand great precepts; with no obstruction in the mind, right and wrong empty; sitting, lying, walking, and acting all pass through. The fires of sin from now on become empty flames; the night light reports the hall of the Dharma in red. Liberation arises from precepts, concentration, and wisdom; guarding precepts with sincere resolve, you will personally transcend the paths.

If you doubt that precepts are false and transmitted falsely, Heaven will surely call forth a rebuke. The disciple who awakens and has no doubts, will not be blown about like floating clouds and driven by the wind. Beyond kalpas, wandering freely and at ease, suddenly cutting off the idle vines and creepers. Follow the prescribed cultivation and worship the Celestial Honoured; speak not loudly nor bow your head. Within and without, one kind of spirit without error; though of mortal body, the Way is already accomplished. The Way accomplished is neither easy nor difficult; holding precepts, precepts ever in the heart. Life and death, death and life arise from precepts and concentration; having taken refuge, cease negligence and do not regard precepts as stubbornness.
