# Preservation of Life and Prolongation of Being

Sons of the Dao, formerly when I occupied the place above, I repeatedly exhorted you all, urging you to be valiant and to establish great vows, seeking only to know early the matters of life and death, not to slight your spirit and ambition, nor to learn the two vehicles of greed for life and fear of death. Yet now I speak again of the mind-method for preserving life and prolonging being. Is this not the double-tongued false speech, misleading the multitudes? Sons of the Dao, the mind-method I speak of for preserving life and prolonging being is not to cling to the body alone, but to speak only of the essence and breath, calling you to preserve that postnatal lifespan, to extend this present transient life. What I here call preservation of life is that which is called the heavenly mandate, the nature; it is to guard the life which Heaven has bestowed, to dwell at ease and await it. That which is called the heavenly mandate, or nature, is the wisdom-life of the Buddhist school, the fundamental life-star of the Daoist gate. This character for life signifies a longevity that is deathless. As the Diamond Sutra says, "How can there be long life? The vajra body is indestructible." The heavenly mandate is not two, but one; cultivate body and mind and await it. To exhaust reason and nature and reach life is the essential principle of establishing life.

That which is spoken of as prolongation is not curing disease to extend years, nor immortality. It is the indestructible true nature through countless kalpas, the eternal, ever-present dharma-body, the form and image that transforms and nurtures multitudes of beings, an extraordinary form. If you refer to the skin-bag and cultivate it, you may also live a few years more, but it is only that death is delayed; this is not the true Way. I now refer to this cultivation to preserve life, which is one with Heaven and Earth and all things. Though Heaven and Earth have motion and change, my original nature has no motion or change. All things have an end, but my original nature has no end. Heaven, Earth, and all things have kalpa movements and cycles, the yuan assembly and the turning of the world; but my tranquil true permanence is void and luminous, unclouded, transcendent beyond form, without destruction, alteration, or change. The life preserved and the life extended is this. It is called the true and constant Way of the heavenly principle flowing on, generating life without ceasing.

This section is all words forced out by necessity. If men of clear vision, who understand the mysterious seat of speech, remain silent, that is to know the message within. The great Way is boundless, encompassing Heaven and Earth, nowhere to be left out, ever-present in time, all things included, responding to all. In daily use and common matters, each point is the Way. What is seen and heard, walking, standing, sitting, lying down, eating, breathing, advancing, retreating, wearing clothes, eating food, sunshine and shade, cold and heat — all points are the Way. Yet alas! You are obscured and bound by things, and do not know it day by day. The so-called brightness within the void responds clearly; but before its influence, at every step you are lost. Now I rely on the three religions' patriarchs, the mercy of universal salvation, the compassionate vow to benefit life; therefore I must speak at length to you. Hence I make known to all beings there is no other Way; if there be two ways, then it is not the Mahayana of true enlightenment. Your little spiritual nature is indeed another name for wisdom-life, originally one thing; this wisdom-life is but a provisional name for the Dao-body, originally arising from one source. Yet because it issues forth in difference, it embraces the three and bubbles into the one. This wisdom-life appears at every moment, but you see not its form; it is hidden at every instant, but you know not where; it speaks daily, but you hear not its voice. Are you not like those seeking fire by the lamp, riding a ox yet seeking the ox, foolish men?

Sons of the Dao, why should I teach you to preserve it? I fear you do not recognize this wisdom, which is the spiritual treasure. I know deeply that you, at the slightest movement, rebel against it,—you are not old cultivators who have seen the nature, nor old Daoist elders who know the mind. Yet when you see it, you do not use it. Even when you use it, you cannot use it greatly. When this little life departs, it is as when the Primordial Celestial Venerable leaves the dharma seat, as when the Yellow Emperor loses the mysterious pearl, as when the Iron Old Patriarch leaves his staff, as when Zhang Guo of the Mysterious Pass rides the young donkey. With a mouth hard to speak, blindly feeling the nostrils; with a heart without orifices, lacking subtlety; it departs in darkness. Now I therefore, with the sacred heart of giving up speech to the Primordial One, and revering the great virtue of Ancestor Qiu who loves life, awaken you with nectar thus, hastily to seek the wondrous principle of preserving life and prolonging being. Have you not heard the "Supreme Cavern of Mysterious Spiritual Treasure Scripture on Disaster-Dispelling and Life-Protecting"? Sons of the Dao, if you can turn and awaken to this scripture, then you can renew the wisdom-life endlessly, generating life without ceasing. But to recite the scripture’s name as offering is not awakening. The offering man, as he recites, passes away, and cannot savor it closely. Does not the scripture say: "You beings, from beginningless time, your minds are servants to forms, your thoughts follow the change of circumstances. You are only lovers and fools, without rest, drifting on the river of love, sinking in the sea of desire, clinging to illusory forms with shapes, obscuring your original face. The Dao is originally formless, but you hold it as form; the Dao is originally not void, but you cling to it as void. The void and form confuse you; being and non-being are inverted, and you cannot enlighten yourself. How can you then escape the path of birth and death, or jump out of the wheel of transmigration? If one knows void and not void, form and not form, does not cling to views of void, and is free from all doubts and faults, this person can then purify the six senses, cut off obstacles. This is the principle of our gate, and is taught in the scripture named: Protect Life to Obtain the Dharma, Universal Salvation of Living Beings, Preach in the World, Circulate Reading and Recitation. Those who can read and transmit it have heavenly flying kings, vajra breakers of evil, dharma-protecting spirit children, saviors in suffering, golden-eyed fierce beasts, each with millions of multitudes, guarding this scripture, enabling all to leave these defilements."

O multitudes! Can the coloured body know void and not void, form and not form, recognize the void-dharma, penetrate without obstruction, enter the manifold wondrous gates? Therefore I first explain to you the wondrous truth in the scripture, to protect the wisdom-life of the multitudes. The Ancestor in compassion fears only that you mistake the coloured body for the true body, and desire neither no-ness in no-ness, nor form in form, nor being in being, nor void in void; to be moved by this blood-flesh illusory coloured body, tossed without rest, deluded from the true sect, lost the treasure of wisdom. Therefore in this scripture, sons of the Dao, each protects the spiritual root, uproots and plants the original source; when the root is firm, the Way is born. The gentleman delights in Heaven, therefore preserves life; short life and death are not two, this is prolongation of life. The gentleman serves Heaven, therefore the wisdom-life is long; so he generates life without ceasing, transforms and circulates, attains the vajra indestructible body, perfects the true permanent faultless dharma-body.

O multitudes, the records of the three caverns and four palaces, five thousand three hundred true texts, only point to prolonging life and preserving it, thus can one transcend kalpa and dust. To attach to form is not preservation of life; true void is prolongation of life. Wisdom-nature does not leave wisdom-life; wisdom-light is the wisdom-lamp. If one desires wisdom-light always to shine, wisdom-life must firmly and long subsist. Constant subsistence does not leave stillness and concentration; the lamp’s light will naturally be always bright. To realize the true thus the lamp always shines, self-illumining, kindly saving multitudes. The light is truly lightless to behold, the brightness truly nameless; it is only originally within life; wisdom opens and provisionally speaks of light and brightness. Form and void, the world of birth and death; void and form protect life and prolong being. To prolong being is to transcend kalpa; transcending kalpa, what death? what name? Beings only because they are confused in wisdom, life upon life, kalpa upon kalpa drifting and sinking. The wisdom-lamp and wisdom-light shine universally; you quickly awaken to the causes of precepts. Try to grasp the wondrous method of preservation and prolongation, quietly and voidly declare it all to you. Sons of the Dao, sons of the Dao! The scripture says: "Use it and it is invisible, thus life can be preserved; see it and it cannot be used, thus being can be prolonged. Only by extinguishing moving mind, yet not extinguishing illuminating mind, can being be prolonged; but to extinguish abiding mind, one must condense the void mind, then life can be preserved. If life can be prolonged, wisdom-life will not be broken, and the great medicine is accomplished; if life can be preserved, then no birth is to be attained, and the great elixir is fulfilled." "Only life is not constant; the Dao is good and therefore obtained; if not good, then lost." "Receiving life from Heaven, looking to Heaven’s bright life, though the state be old, its life is truly new." All these are the true principles of preservation and prolongation, called the great Way of establishing life.

Sons of the Dao, if you can awaken here, fully obtain this wondrousness, I now do not withhold my supreme treasure, emptying my purse and overturning my bag, directly revealing the profound mystery. There are four lines in verse; all listen closely and consider: "Life short or life long is originally fated; to be born and to pass away is originally no birth. To prolong and preserve needs no elaborate method; the Way returns to non-Way, the king-city of dharma."
