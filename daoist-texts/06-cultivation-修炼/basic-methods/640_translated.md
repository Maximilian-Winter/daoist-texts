# Exposition of the Great Teaching and the Grand Way

Brethren, yesterday your humble servant heard the Way expounded by the presiding master. Though it is said that the essence of the Way is non-action, and the dharma body is actual, yet it is important to know that the essence of the Way is not apart from the ordinary body; the dharma body is indeed within the coloured body. The coloured body is firm and solid; this is the external aspect adorned by meritorious deeds of activity. The dharma body is clear and tranquil; this is the internal aspect adorned by meritorious deeds of non-action. When both internal and external are thus pure, and both are awakened, then the spirit and brightness are liberated, the supreme, the highest, indestructible void is attained; great luminescence, great completeness, unconquerable power; myriad spirits pay homage, commanding thunder and lightning, guarding the three realms, with the five emperors presiding at reception; profound wisdom is perfectly clear. This, moreover, is not attained by meritorious deeds of activity.

Brethren, if one firmly refines essence and nourishes qi, then the qi abides and essence condenses. By self-regulating the fire and returning the wind, essence transforms into qi, steaming the four elements, harmonising the myriad spirits. When the true fire emits no smoke, then the qi is pure; when the divine water leaks not, then the spirit is tranquil. Pure qi transforms into spirit; tranquil spirit conforms to emptiness. When emptiness is extreme and tranquility profound, then the primal truth returns; the nine returns to seven, returning life to the root. Returning to the root is when life is established and true nature preserved. When true nature is preserved, the essence of the Way is manifest. When the essence of the Way is manifest, the dharma body appears.

Brethren, this is the Way of cultivating non-action within activity, and the dharma body of cultivating activity within non-action. The coloured body has a lifespan; the dharma body has a life of wisdom. Lifespan comes from Heaven, not from oneself; hence the coloured body undergoes transmigration of birth and death, cycles of kalpas. Wisdom life comes from self, not from Heaven; hence the dharma body wields authority at will, liberated and unobstructed. Brethren, the lifespan of the coloured body is limited; fixed destiny is hard to escape; when Heaven commands death, one must die. The wisdom life of the dharma body is boundless; its divine powers are vast; eternally certifying non-birth, thus attaining longevity fulfilled.

Brethren, even if the coloured body lingers for ten thousand years, it is only called a demon, not the Way. The dharma body abides and comes and goes constantly. To hear the Way in the morning and die at dusk is truly the highest sage’s word. The dharma body dies but does not perish; hence it is called longevity. The coloured body dies and dies again; hence it is impermanent. Brethren, if one can realize the dharma body, then even those short-lived and impermanent ones may become long-lived. If one clings to the coloured body as the form, one will cause even the boundlessly long-lived to fall into transmigration.

The general rule in one word is: see through the coloured body; all worries are empty; sincerely and diligently cultivate, without a speck of defilement; do not let the dharma body be overlaid by the coloured body; only let the coloured body be seen through, and the dharma body be liberated. Is this not the great turning of the dharma wheel and the flourishing of the Way? Now what is expounded is the grand teaching and the great Way, wholly relying upon the constant turning of the dharma wheel. To restore the ancestral Way’s resplendence, if one does not clearly point out the dharma body to the people, who will protect and uphold it? What is called teaching not being broad is that the Way is not manifest; the Way not manifest is that the dharma cannot be practiced; the dharma not practiced is that the Way cannot be enlarged.

The Most Sage has said: ‘Man can enlarge the Way, not the Way enlarge man.’ Only if each of you recognize the man who enlarges the Way, and practise the dharma that enlarges the Way, and expound the principle of manifesting the Way, what cause is there to fear the Way’s lineage not flourishing and the ancestral spirit fading away?

When I was young and learning little, my reading was not extensive, nor versed in Confucianism or Buddhism; I blindly sought the Way, wandering within the region for several decades, earnestly desiring to exhaust the source. What I sought was to seek my own innate knowledge; what I asked was to inquire of the original wisdom nature alone. The longer the inner seeking, the more the innate knowledge alone appears in the cinnabar field; the deeper the inner inquiry, the more the wisdom nature manifests clearly in the empty chamber. Within, there is a master; what harm if guests are received and attended? Within, there is the true religion; thus I desire to expound the teaching and enlarge the Way.

Brethren, I am not skilled in letters, and ashamed before the Three Caverns and the Jade Box. I have read few alchemical scriptures, and have no means to copy down the true immortal treasures and formulas. Because by nature I love idleness, delight in leisure and quietude, I constantly seek wisdom life, delve deeply into the obscure and subtle, set aside all affairs, and hold fast to the true primal. Where is the time or skill to read Confucian books or examine alchemical scriptures? Therefore, even to this day I am unable in letters, my speech blunt and slow; I merely speak roughly and plainly, uttering some unrevealed secret words for your hearing. Yet, the Way itself is without words; why need one speak the dharma? The scriptures originally require no learning; why must halls be opened? The teaching remains non-action; why trouble with many affairs?

This Way, each person has a share in it, not to be separated even for a moment. It matters not whether one be in the world or in the Way; one may likewise realize and seek it; why must one forsake the world and become a recluse, seeking masters and friends? Only because of this one matter of birth and death, the mind does not understand; hence, one is hungry and searches for food, hastening east and west, to the ends of the earth seeking the method of returning life to the root. Fortunate indeed that there is the Jade Pure, Supreme Pure, and Grand Pure, which confer scriptures, expound the dharma, establish the teaching and altars, propagate and transmit the Buddha’s bowl, and issue lineages unto the present.

All the Confucian schools — Zhou, Er Cheng, Zhang, Zhu — have received the secret of the sacred scriptures, and expounded the essentials of the mind-method. Also, the Diamond Sutra, the Surangama Sutra, the Heart Sutra — these are the true doctrines of the Buddha, profound in quieting body and freeing from desire. The three teachings share only the one Way of nature and life; all have the compassionate heart to save and relieve suffering, to succour and assist living beings.

Now there is I, who have the honour to be among the disciples of Master Qiu of the Dragon Gate, proceeding according to rule, propagating the dharma treasure, receiving the teaching, and expounding it. Brethren, I am but a common man, incapable of divine powers; I know only the daily practice of ordinary effort. Teaching men to awaken is only for those who uphold and observe precepts within the Way. Unlike those who sell formulas for alms, idle and lazy, eating with open mouths and clothing with empty hands, how could they understand men’s birth and death?

Therefore, I only strive to rouse my own spirit, for the plan of universal salvation. Above, to promote the teaching and its appearance; below, to benefit the common people. It is fundamentally for all beings, not for myself.

Our Dragon Gate began with Master Qiu of the Yuan dynasty, flourishing in mystery and exposition; now four hundred years have passed, great men are rare, and worthy ones hard to find. Now at the end of our Way, not reckoning but thirty years of faithful observance of precepts, guarding rules, investigating and seeking truth; Heaven has granted my wish, in the Wangwu Mountains I met a master, at the Nine Palaces I received the dharma; these twenty years and more, Heaven opens the Way’s course. Joyfully meeting the Emperor’s reign, living in a flourishing age, gentry and officials delight in goodness, scholars and merchants rejoice in charity; fellow travellers with affinity convert and cultivate, and at the capital have established altars and precept assemblies. Through eight seasons of cold and heat, the wind moves a thousand true ones; laypeople with affinity all take refuge in precepts and concentration, entering straightway the pure, empty, wondrous Way.

Your humble servant relies only on this one spiritual opportunity, sincerely and silently operating, moved by Heaven’s grace, gaining true occasions; presumptuously ascending the dharma seat, falsely acting as the dharma teacher only. As for greatly expounding the profound gate and widely enlarging the dharma place, this is your humble servant’s most simple wish. Brethren, do not trust those who cast doubt and slander, who cling to meditation cushions, close their throats and gnash their teeth, feigning the appearance of the Way, and thereby deceive themselves over time. If such men, their words are ever to be of constant response and constant tranquillity. Response to what? When they cannot even manage their own life, how can they manage the lives of others?

You must listen well: ‘The precepts and texts come from the Daozang; transmission of precepts according to rank is no falsehood. Only because the grand teaching aims to save beings, I urge you, deluded disciples, to cease calumny. Encourage your fellows to open their hearts, endure insults, cultivate truth, and enlarge the clerical appearance. Cultivate both concentration and wisdom, and deepen your blessings and virtues. Universally save beings, and lead them from the sea of suffering. Those who receive the precepts must first cut off hindrances; when hindrances are removed, brightness shines. What cause is there to fear that wisdom nature has little radiance? Only be concerned that the light shine ten thousand fathoms. Guard the flame, preserve life; only when wisdom is long enduring can one cease to abide, prolong life, and depart illusion’s form. Embrace purity, nourish simplicity, learn non-action; wisdom life is prolonged and returns to vastness.

If one is obsessed with coloured form, not knowing that when the body dies who is truly long-lived? Unwilling to save others but only oneself, how may the immortal masters save us? Ready clothing, free food, one mouth and one body—who provides these? How may rice, hills and mountains, be consumed? Drops of water and great waves call to Avici hell. Deceiving men to offer support and seek ease, warm clothes and full food yet no thirst. Clever speech and flowery words make the Way established; flying ascension and salvation, the appearance of companionship. Outwardly protecting and hearing such words, the offerings increase; the ignorant expect gold in the water. How many mortal men can awaken themselves? Who knows the year or month of ascension? Those who have wisdom and awakening harbour no jealousy; when still, they abide in non-action and first save themselves. In motion, they enlarge the Way and save their fellows. Ten thousand words and a thousand sayings are but one awakening. One awakening, arising from universal salvation; universal salvation requires a heart devout, firm, and steadfast. The Way is great; the teaching expounded; the ancestral spirit raised; liberation, true emptiness, harmony of heart and nature.’
