# XVII. Salvation and Deliverance of Men

Sons of the Masters, what I have spoken of, the exposition of the teaching and the grand way, is not for myself, nor for the sake of teaching; it is only for the purpose of establishing the substance of the Way, the law of Heaven, and to save and deliver the multitude of beings. In former times the sages of the three teachings, if not for the sake of living creatures, how could they have established their doctrines, transmitted their scriptures, proclaimed the altar and displayed the truth, bending down to expedients, and expending all their benevolent hearts?

Sons of the Masters, the Confucian gate is that of the highest and first teacher. Its virtue partakes of the Great Ultimate, its way gathers the great completion; neither stubborn nor absolute, neither self nor other; it edits books and settles music, praises the Changes and holds to rites; everywhere it carries out the transformation of Spring and Autumn, squarely expounds the classic of filial piety and righteousness; the Way was transmitted by Zeng and Meng, bearing a heavy burden on one shoulder; as the teachers of ten thousand generations of scholars, the founders of the teaching for the people. If Zeng and Meng had not received their instruction in the Zhou dynasty, and Cheng and Zhu had not expounded and guarded it in the Song dynasty, how could it exist today?

The Buddhist sect, beginning from the West with the Buddha Shakyamuni, endured hardships of snow mountains, abandoned kingdom and home, subdued body and mind, perfected merit and fulfilled practice; the five aggregates are all empty, the six roots are pure and still; he displayed wondrous marks, and appeared in transformation to the ten directions. In the time of the Han Emperor Ming, golden men entered dreams, white horses came from the West, transmitting five thousand and forty-eight volumes, the Diamond Prajna Sutra, the teaching flowed eastwards; the name was Tathagata, the law was transmitted to the Sixth Patriarch, revered Brahma temples and golden immortals, the Great Vehicle of compassion supreme. If not for our Buddha transmitting the sutras, how could today all revere the golden body arhats?

The Way is that of the Three Pure Ones establishing the pole, vast and hard to name, lofty and unfathomable. The scriptures are subtle and secret, handed down saint to saint. Manifesting the body to expound the law, enduring kalpas to move the heart. To save men from the sea of suffering, to rescue the world through successive dynasties. Thus the Three Officials conveyed this, and the Five Poles opened the altar. Pure Yang Lüzu, chief of the three teachings, commanding the five thunders, manifesting traces in every direction, opening the mystery everywhere; great compassion and great mercy, great benevolence and great filial piety, forgetting fame and profit, leaving behind incense offerings. Passing on to our Master Qiu, diligent in the Way and preserving benevolence, worshipping the elixir scriptures at the phoenix palace; founding the sect and transmitting precepts, reviving the pure rules at Longmen. With thousands of hardships, vowing to save men. Called the Venerable Lord of Eternal Spring, repeatedly esteemed as the Response of Heaven. Illumining all dharma realms, equally sharing great grace. Cultivating merit and establishing virtue, various supernatural powers, only for the saving and delivering of living beings, together reaching the Great Way.

Sons of the Masters, to save and deliver, one must be earnest and urgent, first saving oneself, then saving others. Now the teaching is not practiced; the mysterious hidden sects precisely fail to remove this great sickness. Why is it the Great Way does not prevail, and the teaching is thin and poor? Sons of the Masters, it is only because the entire Perfect Reality sect holds "cannot save oneself, only save others," this eight-character root of great guilt, which ruins the very aspect of the Perfect Reality teaching. Sons of the Masters, your exposition of the teaching, if you cannot follow the teaching yourselves, yet first urge others to follow it, who will believe and obey? How is it seen that Perfect Reality cannot save itself, sons! To save living beings is to save the living beings within oneself. What are these living beings within oneself? Sons of the Masters,杂念妄想 - miscellaneous thoughts and vain imaginations - these are the living beings within the original mind itself. Within the abdomen of Perfect Reality there are eighty-four thousand vain imaginations and miscellaneous thoughts, that is, eighty-four thousand living beings. Within one day, in the twenty-four hours, sitting upon the meditation cushion, the mind roams over the world; just as one vain mind ceases, another vain thought arises. The seven feelings do not rest, the six desires detain; the three poisons entangle, the eight consciousnesses are confused. Like floating clouds covering the sun, going eastward and westward; wild waves driven by the wind, rushing west and swinging east. From dawn till night, when is there even a moment of stillness? Through the months and years, unable to fix even one thought. Not only when sitting on the cushion, even when walking on the road, and as to dreaming and sleeping, at what moment is vain mind cast away, and right thought held? If the mind does not rest, the body is not saved; if the thought is not one, the Way is not clear. Therefore within the gate of Perfect Reality, one must stop thought and rest the mind, only then can the heavenly mind appear, and the light of wisdom break forth. Fellow men, if Perfect Reality is thus, then indeed can it be called comrades. Therefore it is said first save oneself, only then is it good to save and transform others, not too late.

Now how to save oneself? Firm, valiant, diligent, renouncing, giving, exalted, modest, liberated, natural. Sons of the Masters, you must use will undivided, concentrate spirit and clear thought. Fellow men who have opportunity, incline your hearts to hear me, I will point out one by one these nine essentials of the Way.

Ah! What is called firm? This law of transcendence is originally contrary to worldly law, harmony and opposition are different, square and round do not meet. To cultivate the law in the dharma body, one must first regard the illusions of the world and the fantasies of the body as false; sever from children, wife, and relatives, cut off affection; fame and riches, delicacies and fine horses, lingering entanglements - with a single heart leap beyond delusion and disease, cleanse the will and not float on spiritual treasures — this is called firm. One name for it is the demon-subduing cudgel, another the demon-slaying platform.

What is called valiant? Not hesitant or undecided, not wandering to and fro; seize the handle and throw it off, light bright clears the obscurity. The heart is unlike the autumn moon, bright and ever clear; the spirit does not rise with the morning glow, but brightly reflects back. Lateness and sloth, following the waves and drifting; neglect and indolence, changing with the morning and evening. Unable to have a broad chest and clear eyes in one morning. Applying effort upon the mind, casting away all worldly life; in the Way, bitter practice, crushing the evil demons. To this matter of swiftly passing life and death, bewildered and not penetrating. Penetrate the iron wall and copper fortress, and understand this is Heaven and Hell. Sons of the Masters, therefore after firmness, add valour.

What is called diligent? That firmness is to sever enmities and affections, to cultivate the mind and establish life. This valour is to subdue scattering and disorder, to arrange searching and wandering, to settle spirit and mind. What is more diligent? The scholar inquires into life and death; before this body existed, where were you? After this body dies, whither do you go? The world, heaven, earth, and all things, daily use and common, are nothing but the Way. What the eye sees, what the ear hears, there is not one thing not in the Way, nor one that is outside the Way. Things have beginnings and ends, that is the life and death of things; affairs have beginnings and ends, that too is the life and death of affairs. If one uses the mind to inquire, with bitter endeavour and diligent search, to understand the beginning and end of things, then one can understand the birth and death of the body; to understand the end and beginning of affairs, then one can understand the arising and ceasing of the mind. From things, attentively and carefully, truly understanding, from one thing to all things, from one affair to all affairs, nothing but one can understand the mechanism of birth and death, the principle of arising and ceasing. So beginnings and ends, life and death, arising and ceasing, all become consistent practice; then one can be near the Way. Then the mind is absorbed in the Great Way, subtle and fine to seek, penetrating mysteries, knowing the arcane, silently knowing the heavenly mind, closely communicating with the purpose; can make this point of void spirit not darkened, advance through source and stream, respond to all things without confusion, understand all matters without perplexity. If one will not be diligent but slack and lazy, that is to ruin and abandon oneself, willing to be a low ghost, without will to true cultivation. Even if one sits cross-legged a hundred years, extending life a thousand years, in the end there is no permanence, still falling into the wheel of rebirth.

What is called renouncing and removing? It is to cast away previous coarseness, remove all side gates and heterodox ways, and henceforth newly walk, with one sincerity upwards. This point of void spirit unclouded true sect is called the original and utmost treasure, manifold transformations without fixed form. Touching things and encountering affairs, response varies, each is not the same. Every moment sees shadows, every instant loses track. Following subtle spiritual mechanism, layer upon layer penetrating in, more difficult to reach the utmost profundity. The more one moves, the more emerges, inexhaustible in taking, unfailing in using. The enlightened gain it themselves, the ignorant are far separated. For fear that you, having grasped one or two parts of reason, can keep and then re-enlighten, not relinquishing to seek other enlightenment, that is impermanence. You must turn the constant and unchanging spiritual mechanism to the impermanent and changing things; then principle becomes clear and nature is seen, giving up the old and taking the new, layer by layer penetrating deeper and deeper to the highest. If one does not reach a state of distinguished independence, how can one penetrate the deep mechanism, illuminate life and death, transcend and leave the world, escape the root of doubt of myriad kalpas?

What is called giving? As yesterday’s awakening mechanism, the former wondrous principle, what was awakened and obtained, either give it to living beings, or store it in millet, not to keep it stored mixing with my spirit platform. So-called the past mind cannot be obtained, the future mind cannot be obtained, even this present mind cannot be obtained. Within this cannot-be-obtained, still seek a self-obtained subtlety, then the light of wisdom is complete. Giving wealth is called cultivating blessings. Giving the law is called cultivating wisdom. Giving of wealth and goods has a definite end. What I say, giving of the law is inexhaustible. Giving wealth can help men in worldly matters, nourish the body’s clothing and food, make external appearances adorned. When wealth is exhausted, still one relies on bare hands and empty fists. Giving of the law, entering worldly law is practicable, transcending worldly law is also practicable. Giving of the law can open men’s obscured orifices, uplift spiritual roots. But giving wealth is not the wealth of the world that can be given. Common men nourish life and save men, relieve urgency and help the weak, ward off disaster and repel calamity, bless the country and comfort the people, move and still water and fire, dispel disaster and resolve misfortune, variously representing heaven to proclaim and transform, governing yin and yang, penetrating heaven and earth, boundless and measureless wondrous power; this wealth is talent, namely the boy Shancai of the Southern Ocean Great Bodhisattva Avalokitesvara. Ah, you know, to seek heavenly treasure requires worldly wealth. This worldly wealth is not the common wealth of the world, but the wealth of the law of saving oneself and others, called the Divine Treasure, hence can evoke heavenly treasure. Daily use is giving of the law. Those who can understand this are men of wisdom of primordial Heaven of myriad kalpas.

What is called exalted and clear? Having given the wondrous law and saved living beings, one must see true exaltation, true wisdom and clear understanding. Heaven and earth and all things have this spiritual nature. If I take the law as law, that is to cling to the law. Clinging to the law as law is a dead law, not called living law, that is to have no exalted insight. Therefore if I take the law I use myself to teach men, taking fixed principles to answer things, that is dead law and dull mechanism. It is like a nailed pillar shaking the rudder, like a glued post drumming a zither. One must not take my law as right, men’s law as wrong, but in uprightness and brightness, guiding as occasion requires, perceiving opportunity and moving, bending and proclaiming. If one saves the perfect with the square, one cannot turn around. Saving fools with wisdom does not fit the occasion. One must know the fool and speak the fool’s law, so that the fool may understand and comprehend, measure the fool’s capacity and conduct, and slowly be able to awaken. To wise men, the fool’s law also is not suitable. One must have understanding both of self and others, refined and common jointly tasted, round and harmonious and lively; the wise see it as wisdom, the benevolent see it as benevolence. Obstructions may be cleared, confusion may be settled; the doubtful understand, the dull become wise; the deaf hear, the blind see — only then is it called exalted and clear. Fit to take the lead in saving and giving.

What is called modesty? True cultivation having reached this point, when meeting one of clear eye, great wisdom and empty heart, all things outside the body, all affairs of the world, are empty empty empty. Above shake the gate of Heaven, below shake the axis of earth; transcend human world, spirit enters the void. Where then is a living being before the face? From ancient times till now, the two vehicles of Bodhisattvas, the lower vehicle of immortals, all suffer this disease. The disease has entered the highest places, yet they do not perceive. Hence it is called the inferior root of the lesser vehicle, the side gates and outer teachings, the heterodox magic ways. If such, utterly do not know the formlessness, the unfathomable transformation of spirit, is it within your limited measure to grasp and hold fast? How can finite things presume to exalt themselves? Have you not heard the Supreme One dare not be first under heaven? Does not seek blessings first, does not boast of his merits, does not display his Way. Progress takes retreat as principle, exaltation takes lowliness as base. Letting the body go outward the body remains, putting the body behind the body goes before; all men contend to be first, I alone go behind. The highest virtue is not virtue, the highest man contends not. He sees me not, does not exalt himself, does not respect himself, does not strengthen himself. As he gives to others, he himself gains more; as he benefits others, he himself has more. I do not know its name, forcibly call it the Way. Therefore the higher the exalted stage reached, the more one practices the work of humility and retreat. Modesty, benevolence, and gentleness preserve the great Way. One side universally practices compassion and wisdom, another side preserves and stores the brilliance. The sharp weapons of the country are not shown to men; I do not seek to subdue men, men spontaneously submit to me. At this time, the principle of liberation must be known without fail.

What is called liberation? Sons of the Masters, those who cling do not understand the Way and virtue. Loosely drifting, not bound by the law; stripped bare, not encumbered by things. Round and spherical, teaching according to place; shining brightly, saving men through kalpas. Entering the wondrous gates, being mother to living beings. Compassion can love things, but does not take loving things as compassion; goodness can save men, but does not take saving as goodness. Wondrous law can save living beings, but does not take saving as wondrous law; the supreme Way can transcend the world, but does not take transcendence as supreme Way. Able to give up suffering, also able to endure suffering. Above can transcend heaven, not taking the heavenly palace as the place of joy; below can universally save hell, not taking hell as the place of suffering. Encountering suffering then save men from suffering, encountering joy then share joy with the multitude. In joy can point out the suffering of living beings, in distress can illumine the joy of living beings. In heaven then save heavenly dragons, ghosts and spirits, so that ghosts and spirits hear true awakening and transcend to immortal accomplishment; on earth then save sinful and lost souls, so that shades and spirits see the light, and transmigrate to the human realm; in the human world then save all good men and faithful women, universally cultivating daily use of the ordinary, non-action, uprightness, faithfulness, fairness, worthiness and the great Way. Not letting the scholar, farmer, artisan, and merchant enter the lower vehicle and lesser laws, manipulating spirit and soul, falling into demonic evil paths, battling in the realm of Asuras. Within this liberation, one must reach that natural function, namely the Way of freedom.

What is called natural? Sons of the Masters, this marvel of natural is as the Heart Sutra says, "Observe the Bodhisattva Avalokitesvara, the One who regards the sounds of the world." To obtain the marvel of natural is to have self-freedom Avalokitesvara. That is the bodhisattva upon my mind, the Avalokitesvara of the Southern Sea. That is to observe the wondrous marks of the other shore, pure stillness and true void, the reason of emptiness and nature. Able to observe the wondrous marks of true sound. Without a true teacher to point out, can one comprehend the wondrous marks of true emptiness? Ah, sons! Form is emptiness, emptiness is form; if not empty not form, the Way is not true. The true emptiness and wondrous marks, true constant Way, neither empty nor form, wondrous and infinite. One with my void, the void and that have no division of self. Enter metal and stone without hindrance, enter water and fire without injury. Sons of the Masters, carefully ponder the nine chapters of essentials of the Way, keep to the thin pellet, realize the wondrous marks, one pattern natural; the three schools have already verified, completely saving men, merit high and immeasurable, virtue subdues ghosts and spirits, evil demons are bound, evil spirits fall and lose power; why fear the world will not believe and take refuge? It is truly the universal salvation and merit practice of helpful deliverance, diligently inquiring into saving oneself, after heaven and men. One sincere aspiration to the true constant Way, naturally bodhisattvas protect my practice. The nine chapters of wondrous canon transcend the dusty world, one piece of Perfect Reality polished deeply. Giving the subtle words of true wondrous principle, cultivating both nature and life without sparing hardship. Insight exalted explaining many laws, benevolent gentle humble not boasting ability. Renouncing external appearance and forgetting you and me, true thus heavenly mind and great Way practice. Untroubled liberation expounding profound marvels, unsurpassed true void mysterious mysterious Way. Small fire causes no harm, three surnames united; merit perfected and practice fulfilled, stepping to the clouds.
