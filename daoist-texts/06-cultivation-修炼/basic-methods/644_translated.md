# Twenty: Realizing the Reality of Life and Death

The various Masters, from ancient times to the present, the sages, immortals, and Buddhas, have only for the great cause and occasion, endured nine years of facing the wall; their sole urgency is to seek deliverance from life and death, to transcend the world, and to subdue the heart. Have you not heard that fire flashes and lightnings, fallen flowers and flowing waters, are all subject to the coming of change and impermanence? A moment cannot be retained; sin and blessing accompany the person; in the cycle of rebirth one receives retribution. Before the words are finished, the breath within the throat is cut off; before the speech is uttered, the tongue withdraws and the voice is faint. Naked and bare, where shall the body find rest? Dark and obscure, at what point shall life be established? Great blessings bring a return to the human world; evil deeds cause a fall to Fengdu. When the blessings are exhausted, one returns to the cycle of rebirth; when the retribution of deeds is completed, one is born again as beast or bird. Endless calamities and enmities are hard to undo; a thousand lifetimes' sins and misdeeds cannot be worn away. In every generation lost in delusion, drunken and dreaming of death. Revenge for revenge, wearing horns and donning fur. To speak of it is to feel pain and sorrow; to mention it is to find it pitiful and terrible.

If one does not determine firmly to establish the mind, to hold fast to the conscience, to overturn earth and lift heaven, to realize what manner of state there is after death; if the heart is not given up with the life, to penetrate the various follies and delusions of former life: should one meet a man of resolute spirit, with eyebrows set upright, wielding the sword that cuts the demons in his hand. Truly a great man, who lets loose his vast spirit, cleaving the evil sharp blade and cutting at the heart. One must surely see through whence oneâ€™s life was established before the parents bore me, to the ultimate and thorough coming of creation. After my death, where shall the body find rest? To realize the three bodies, past, future, and present. To pursue to the utmost the three existences as if they were but yesterday; the coming morning is the present dawn. Thus all cares are dissipated and forgotten; only this point of spiritual light remains, sweeping clean all conditions, preserving alone a little of the nature of wisdom. Enter the mysterious gate, one aperture communicating with a hundred apertures; see the true religion, the three times illumined and the three realms transcended. To be freed is that the five elements no longer attach; to be empty and vast is that the four great forms return to void. Enter the gate of myriad mysteries, ascend the ground of the three treasures; freely come and go, change without form. Gently turning the secret of heaven, the demons and spirits cannot fathom its subtlety; majestically holding the ladle of the dipper reversed, yin and yang cannot command its power. At ease in the Brahman qi of Maitreya, attaining the position of clear void and boundless vastness. Forever free from dust and calamity, transcending the cage of bondage. The great matter of perfect truth is accomplished; along the many layered great roads one proceeds; right and wrong are not cultivated yet one suddenly arrives. This subtle and wondrous dharma body, all insight arises from wisdom; each stage of secret work done, how can one not realize and complete the circuit?

Sons! The Way is transmitted by the sages; cultivation depends upon oneself; virtue is accumulated by man; discernment is granted by heaven. Have you not heard that heaven divides creation at one point; man establishes the scripture and order from the heart? Each must strive swiftly and earnestly in conduct and practice; pressing forward with haste and urgency. Those not yet enlightened lose not good causes; those fully enlightened return to the blue sky; those unenlightened do not fall into hell.

Sons! Yet knocking at the door with a golden brick, if the door does not open, the golden brick remains. If the precepts and practice of the Way are not realized, yet the precepts and practice remain, surely one will not sink to the nether world; ultimately one is reborn in the world of yang. The former causes are not obscured, the realization of fruit is self-established; only a little turning over, still holding a handle in the hand.

Sons! If you realize life and death, do not seek outside your body. When life and death are realized, then true essence is known within the heart. I now speak many words, but you must not expect any great method. If you thoroughly embody it in your heart, you will find for yourself the principle. The principle of death is joined with life; death is realized in life; this mechanism of death and life at the crossroads is turned by oneself, subject to your will, not mine. Seeking stillness in movement, seeking movement in stillness, the clues to movement and stillness depend entirely on the inner illumination of good conscience. Ask the heart, not the master. Carefully remember my words; surely they do not deceive. If you do not rely on what I say, you will ultimately be unskilled. This little light along a dark path guides countless lost travellers; this raft that ferries the suffering supports guests across the Ganges. Sons, do not raise doubts; when you know the truth, travel by night.

Then throughout the garden there was silence, and a chant was heard:  
'Where is the homeland before life?  
To what place do we return after death?  
Now the dharma body should be early realized,  
Do not pass through the prime of life with empty hands.  
Life and death, death and life mutually interpenetrate;  
The great cause and occasion are not to be treated lightly.  
Before death, first resemble death;  
The chance for life is to be sought within death.  
It is not in water, nor in mountains;  
Why need one look to the northwest or southeast?  
Look closely, it is not outside my body,  
Only within the narrow space of the square inch.  
Precepts, concentration, and wisdom enter the mysterious gate;  
Do not let your efforts fall short by two or three.  
One mind but realizes life and death;  
Iron walls and bronze ramparts are not hard to break.  
Truly bitter, truly difficult,  
Like a boat sailing on a shallow shoal.  
Suddenly meeting the tide and wind of the river,  
In a moment flying over the Bay of the Nine Dragons.  
Know the truth, travel by night,  
Seek and find no crutches at all.  
Empty and desolate, practice alone;  
No thirst, no hunger, long life with heaven and earth.'
