# The Treatise on Passing the Barrier

Preface to the Treatise on Passing the Barrier

The great Way of cultivating Reality is to appropriate Yin and Yang, to wrest from the Creative Power, to comprehend nature and life, to transcend birth and death, and thereby to pass beyond the ordinary and enter the sagehood, to become an immortal and progenitor — this is a matter of the highest import. It is not to be compared with all the trifling things of the dusty world, the frost and dew, bubbles on water, which come and go, empty and unreal. But alas! The wayfarers of the world, like those who peer through a tube or scoop up water with a ladle, regard great matters as small, and small matters as great, esteeming the false and slighting the true. The Way is not far from man; but men, in their seeking the Way, make it remote from themselves. Hence the ancients said, "Those who study the Way are like cow’s hair; those who have attained the Way are like the horn of the qilin." I say, now men who study the Way are like cow’s hair; those who hear of the Way are like the horn of the qilin. Why so say I? Because in former days many heard of the Way, but few attained it; now many study the Way, but few hear of it. The number of those who study the Way in our day is many times that of those who studied it of old; the number of those who hear of the Way now is less than the number who attained it formerly. Hence it comes to pass that men now who study the Way are like cow’s hair, and those who hear of it are like the horn of the qilin. The cause is this: all learners have some personal ailment, their hearts full of evil Qi; therefore they fail to be moved by their teachers and friends. Thus they waste the years, and toil in vain, wearied and afflicted. They pour out what they have received from their teachers into books of exposition, essentials, direct pointing, heart-meeting, original purpose, directions, awakening to the Way, breaking doubts, and the like, in order to find kindred spirits; this is their full desire. Yet I still fear that learners forsake the near and seek the far, not knowing that they must first exhaust their own affairs before they may venture to imagine the affairs of others. Therefore I have set down the Treatise on Passing the Barrier, to aid learners with a lamp of illumination. First learn to be a sound and upright person; humble yourself and ascend high; proceed from the near to the far; so perchance you may meet a bright teacher, find a good friend, and the great Way may be heard. Though the topics of this book be small, the matters concerned are very great; though the language be coarse, it will profit many. Though it be called the Treatise on Passing the Barrier, the功 (work) of cultivating nature and life cannot be accomplished without this step. Let those who see it not reject it because of its coarse words. If there be among you the most wise and enlightened, who have already opened the great road and met a bright teacher, it will not be difficult to attain the truth, and the功 of Passing the Barrier will be of no use to you.
