# Gate of Anger and Hatred

The Heart Sutra of Prajñāpāramitā says: "There is no ignorance, nor is there the extinction of ignorance." Master Fu said: "To sweep away the soil of the mind is called the cause of the Pure Land." Whether concerning blessings or wisdom, first one must drive away greed and anger. Master Baizhang said: "If in the bowels and viscera there is nothing to be obtained, nothing to be sought, then no dust arises in this person; no self or other is born; he is as if embracing Mount Sumeru in a mustard seed. To arise not at all in any greed or anger, is to be able to draw in the waters of the four great seas. To refuse to admit all joy, anger, and speech into the ears; towards all circumstances, to be without perplexity or confusion, without anger or delight, shaved clean and polished pure — such a one is a man of no affairs, surpassing all the learned, understanding, diligent hermits." The "Knocking on Yao" song says: "If anger be not removed, the nature will not change, and one falls into the sea of birth and death’s cycle." All this speaks of anger and hatred as obstacles to the Way, which must be vigorously removed.

The two words anger and hatred are like snakes and scorpions, most evil and most venomous. If they bind the heart and chest, long accumulated, they become a poison. They harm life and injure the vital spirit, bringing great calamity. Outwardly they injure others, inwardly they ruin oneself; yet there is no physician who can cure them. The measure of the scholar must be as broad and boundless as heaven’s expanse; his mellow strength must be like the earth’s, which bears all things without exception; his capacity to contain must be like the sea, where all waters meet in their courses. Then he may try to observe the vastness of heaven’s expanse, which covers all and gives birth to all. The coming and going of sun and moon depend on it; the rotation of stars depends on it; the clouds and mist that veil depend on it. That men deceive and cheat depend on it; that men respect depend on it; that men feel grateful depend on it; that men revile and hate depend on it. All good and evil, right and wrong, wicked and foolish, base and vile, all arise without its knowledge.

The earth’s mellow strength causes all things to grow, and bears all things. The great mountains of Tai, Dai, and Song bear their heavy weight; the rivers and streams erode and collapse, yet it endures. Trees, herbs, stones are pressed and pierced, yet it bears patiently. Birds and beasts flying and running trample, yet it follows quietly. The plough and hoe dig and scrape, yet it conforms. All insults, injuries, and devastations are without mind or intention. The sea’s capacity to receive all waters flows night and day without ceasing. For a thousand or ten thousand years the excess is never seen. Clear water enters, and its clearness is not seen; turbid water enters, and its turbidity is not seen; sweet water enters, and its sweetness is not seen; bitter water enters, and its bitterness is not seen. Fish, turtles, shrimp, and crabs swim about at will; soft-shelled turtles and dragons dash and leap as they will. It admits all filth, foulness, stench, and defilement, and yet nothing is rejected. 

If the learner of the Way can be like the measure of heaven, the mellow strength of earth, and the vastness of the sea, he is a man of no affairs, a perfected immortal. He guards the miraculous secret of life and dwells close to the Way — there will be great benefit. The confusing and muddled learners of the world do not know that anger and hatred are the greatest hindrance. Sometimes anger arises because circumstances are adverse; sometimes because plans fail; sometimes because possessions are lost; sometimes because they envy the ability of others; sometimes because temperaments clash; sometimes because food and clothing are insufficient; sometimes because of offense given; sometimes because of recalling small faults and nursing hatred; sometimes because requests are denied and hatred accumulates; sometimes because others do not accord with oneself and grudges are gathered. All these afflictions of anger and hatred arise solely from one’s own dullness and ignorance, from the absence of true heart in learning the Way. If one be truly sincere in learning the Way, such things will never be so.

Therefore the utmost sages exhaust themselves in generosity and are sparing in reproach of others. Yan Hui was offended but did not retaliate, because he was without anger and hatred, hence he was a sage. All the people of the world, having anger and hatred, are therefore common men. The difference between sage and common man lies only in this presence or absence. But anger and hatred not only manifest outwardly to harm affairs, even in the subtle and hidden, if there be the slightest trace of dust or smoke, it can injure the true. One must strive to be clean and pure both within and without, as white as snow, as clear as a mirror. In dealing with affairs and contact with things, all should be handled with a mind of no-mind. To gauge spirit and breath without harm, to have temper and nature at peace, then the Great Way may be hoped for.

I exhort those who truly study the Way to quickly open the gate of anger and hatred, to learn to be men of no mind — light things pass away, heavy things pass away, low things pass away, high things pass away. In accord with things, entrusted to things, responding to circumstances. Responding without receiving, passing without abiding, how can anger or hatred harm affairs? If not so, anger and hatred arise — dark poison, secret evil congealed and arrested in the breast, the true nature early destroyed, deluded thoughts seeking clarity in the Way — hard indeed it is.
