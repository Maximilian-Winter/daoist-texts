# The Pass of Heat and Cold

The Old Ancestor said: To estrange oneself from the body, yet the body remains. Wen Shi said: To withstand the winter wind without cold, to endure the summer fire without heat. Lü Zu said: Seeking life yet not living; learning death before dying. These all speak of the Way in forgetting the corporeal frame, and not avoiding cold or heat. Now those who cultivate the Way must first see through the phantom transformations of the body, and place the coloured body beyond their reckoning. If death is not feared, how much less cold or heat? Thus the Divine Light of Shaolin sought the Dharma, passing through snow knee-deep without knowing it. In ancient times, Zhao Zhou Bridge sat cold, the waters rising to flood him yet he was unaware. Sakyamuni cultivated the Way upon snowy mountains, enduring countless sufferings. The Patriarch of Eternal Spring at Panxi Ground his nature, suffering much hunger and cold. Even in recent times, the True Man of Baishi Town, in tattered clothes and soiled face, stood firm for many years without resting. Zhang the Sleeping Immortal of Xining Prefecture lay long beside springs and waters, bare-bodied and exposed, forty years like a single day. The Immortal of Sluice Riverbank refined himself; the Dogskin Immortal slept on the icy shore; the Immortal Liushu labored beneath yellow sands — all these did not avoid cold or heat, abandoning the coloured body and perfecting the Dharma body.

But worldly confused learners do not know that fragrance issues from stench, sweetness comes from bitterness. They mistake the coloured body for reality, and so love and cherish it, seeking only ease and nourishment. When cold they immediately yearn for warmth; when hot they at once desire coolness. Fear of cold and heat severs the thought of the Way. They do not consider that the nature of life is the first great matter of human existence, and that how can they allow such trifles as cold and heat to mislead and endanger this great matter of life? If indeed one truly cares for life, then at the gate of birth and death, in the great crisis and tribulation, one must pass through with detachment and ease. As for cold, heat, chill, and warmth, what are they to be minded of? Though the Way be not yet attained, the coloured body must not be destroyed. But rough clothing to guard the body, and bearing with things as they come, will suffice. There is no need to keep cold and heat ever hanging upon the mind. When cold is met, one must endure cold; when heat comes, one must endure heat. Heat and cold go along with the season only. To go along with the season is not that one must necessarily suffer cold when it is not due, nor suffer heat when it is not due. If one, when cold is not due, yet insists on enduring it; or when heat is not due, yet insists on enduring that; this is a forced doing, stubborn and unyielding, and is only to bring suffering on oneself. What benefit is there in this?

Generally, fear of cold and heat, though a small matter, is a hindrance to the Way. If there be any partial views on cold and heat, infinite evil thoughts and wild imaginings will arise. When cold is met, one sets about ways to avoid the cold; when hot is met, one sets about ways to avoid the heat. Mistaking the false for the true, is it not to lose much indeed? I exhort those with genuine hearts who seek the Way, to quickly open the pass of heat and cold; to accommodate themselves as the time comes, and be at ease everywhere. Cold is permissible, heat is permissible; so long as one does not freeze or burn to death, that suffices. On no account let ignorance arise from cold or heat. Otherwise, if cold and heat lodge in the heart, and the heart has fear, then it cannot be upright; if it have anxiety and trouble, then it cannot be upright. If the heart is not upright, to pursue the Way through false imagining is difficult indeed.
