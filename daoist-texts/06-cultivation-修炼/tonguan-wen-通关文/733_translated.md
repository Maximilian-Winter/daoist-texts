# The Pass of Life and Death

Zhuangzi said: The perfect men of old knew not delight in life, nor did they know aversion to death. When they came forth, they were not joyful; when they passed away, they did not struggle. They came with a tranquil and detached manner, and that was all. The Supreme Sage said: 'If in the morning one hears the Way, one may die at night with contentment.'  
The Postscript to Awakening to Reality says: This Way is most subtle and most refined; the common people are confused and dull in their root nature, holding fast to the existence of the body, and hating death and delighting in life, and in the end find it difficult to attain full understanding. These words all signify that in speaking of learning and cultivating the Way, one must not harbour desires for life nor fear of death.  
Man, having been born with a body, is originally a confluence of the Four Great Elements, something produced from non-being into being, binding together this illusory form. It is the entrusted thing of Heaven and Earth; where there is life there must be death; where there is completion there must be decay. How can it be an absolute true and imperishable thing? Since it is subject to decay, life and death likewise belong to the realm of the illusory. The Ancestor Master teaches men to understand life and death, so that they may bring life and death into equality, reaching the state of no life and no death. Only then is it.  
Zhuangzi speaks of gathering the spirit and thereby attaining long life, and forgetting the spirit and thus having no life. Therefore the way of long life is yet not the utmost achievement of understanding nature and fate; one must come to forget life and non-life, neither living nor perishing — this alone is the consummate understanding of life and death, and transcends life and death and the transformations of creation.  
For Heaven and Earth can control forms, but cannot control the formless; can control the vital breath, but cannot control that which is without breath; can control the mind, but cannot control that which is without mind. Without mind there is no breath; without breath there is no form. Without mind towards life and death, life and death cannot bind one — this is nigh unto the Way.  
The confused scholars of the world, who vainly imagine themselves to attain the Way, all arise from a fear of death. Fear of death is the same as having the desire for life. Having the desire for life, some fear dying of hunger, some fear dying of cold, some fear dying of sickness, some fear dying untimely. Some climb high mountains and fear the wolves and tigers that might harm them; some enter dense forests and fear the pythons and snakes that might bite; some lodge at ancient altars and fear the ghosts and spirits that might invade. The desire to live and fear of death dwells in the inmost recesses, bringing alarm and unrest. Though the form remains, the heart perishes first; the seedling of vital breath is already ruined, the root of the breath of death already planted. The stone remains unaltered, firewood piled upon the breast; devices and stratagems arise in confusion; spirits and ghosts, a thousand evils and a hundred monsters, throng and disturb, wearing away the spirit. The true is all lost, the false all arise; day by day and night by night harm increases — how can one not die?  
I exhort the true hearted who study the Way to swiftly open the pass of life and death, and to place the two words 'life' and 'death' beyond their reckoning. To learn death before dying is to live without knowing life. Life is as it is; death is as it is; dying of hunger is as it is; dying of cold is as it is; harm from wolves and tigers is as it is; bites from serpents are as it is; invasion by ghosts and spirits is as it is; even when meeting disaster of water and fire it is as it is; even when suffering the harm of weapons and arms it is as it is; even when falling ill and dying of disease it is as it is. It is as though one were dead — not knowing, not perceiving, leaving all to Heaven's decision. Only the single word 'Way' is always hanging over the breast, from beginning to end, long without forgetting. The Ancestor Master secretly guards and protects, unwilling to teach the true learners suffering and ruin. Otherwise, with desire for life and fear of death, pushing forward and shrinking back, at this very pass, firmly locked and sealed, one cannot move an inch; vainly to imagine clear understanding of the Way — how difficult it is!
