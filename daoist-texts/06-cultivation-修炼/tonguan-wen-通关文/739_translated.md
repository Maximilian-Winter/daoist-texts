# The Gate of Self-Abandonment

The Most Sacred said: "To hear the Way in the morning, and die at evening, is well indeed." Yan Zi said: "What manner of man was Shun? What manner of man am I? Even those who act have been such." Mencius said: "He who abandons himself, it is not possible to discourse with him; he who despairs of himself, it is not possible to act with him." The Old Ancestor said: "I am not a sage; I have learned and attained it." Shang Yangzi said: "Sakyamuni, upon hearing half a gatha of the Buddha, was about to give up his life; the Yellow Emperor, yielding to the downward wind, went on his knees to question Guangchengzi how to regulate the body so as to attain longevity." These all esteem themselves highly and honorably, and are not such as to abandon or despair of themselves.

Man takes the vital energies of Heaven and Earth and the Five Phases, and so is born a body; where there is qi, there is nature; where there is nature, there is destiny. This principle, qi, nature, and destiny are all lodged within one body; without distinction of worth or folly, high or low, all share this one principle and qi, this one nature and destiny. Common men and sages originally have no difference; only those who can understand nature and destiny are sages; those who cannot, are common men. What Mencius calls "that by which man differs from beasts is but little; the common people cast it away, the gentlemen preserve it" — this is the matter in hand.

The Immortal Traditions say: from ancient times, those who have ascended by flying number three thousand; those who have uprooted their houses number eight hundred; those who have sat and slipped away, or stood and vanished, are innumerable. All these have learned and known, endured and achieved; none have known and accomplished without learning and enduring. Among men of the world, those with innate knowledge are few; those who learn knowledge are many. Though it be said that innate knowledge exists, it is quickly overturned and there are confusions. Without learning, one cannot attain; by learning one just attains.

Therefore Sakyamuni also took as teacher Ran Deng; Confucius also took as teacher Xiang Zhu; Laozi also took as teacher Yuanshi. As for the various revered ancestors Yu, Zhong, Lü, Liu, Wang, Zhang, Shi, Xue, Chen, Bai, all have unbroken transmission, oral handing down from mouth to mouth. It is clear that one who can learn attains, one who does not learn cannot attain. How small, then, is the merit and strength of learning? The confused learners of the world do not regard their own nature and destiny as precious; they do not cultivate their body and mind. Though their body be within the Way, they know not that they have the Way; though their body dwell in a treasure-forest, they know not that a treasure is present; they acknowledge falsehood and abandon truth, taking the empty for the real.

Some say, "The length of nature and destiny is fixed by fate; it is not in the power of man to overcome." Some say, "Immortals and sages are born thus; common men cannot learn it." Some say, "The Great Way is profound and subtle; it is not to be known by ordinary persons." Thereupon they abandon themselves and despair of themselves, drawing their own boundaries, gladly dwelling in the sea of bitterness and treading in the abyss of ruin — a vain existence for mankind!

They know not that since they are men, bearing Yin and embracing Yang, they have the creation of Heaven and Earth; all men may become sages; all men may attain to immortals and Buddhas. But it requires utmost sincerity and progress, to yield oneself to others, from the near to the far, persevering without weariness. Look at the foxes, monkeys, and deer in the mountains — they are but beasts, yet they preserve spirit and nurture qi, dwell quietly in their burrows; after many years and deep skill, they too can conceal their forms and change their shapes, prolonging life and increasing longevity. How much more then should man, the spirit of all things, fail to attain the Way?

If one says, "Man cannot attain the Way," is it not then that men are inferior even to beasts? I exhort those who truly seek the Way to quickly break through the gate of self-abandonment. Establish an unchanging direction; cast off all partial diseases of the vital breath and habit and encumbrance that have been acquired since birth — sweep them away as a whole. With single-hearted devotion to the Way, be tempered in hardships and difficulties. Those who know not must desire to learn and know; those who cannot must desire to learn and be able. Reform and improve, preserve sincerity and cast away falsehood, be consistent and unchanging from beginning to end — then the Great Way may be hoped for.

Otherwise, to abandon and despair of oneself, to regard neither nature nor destiny as precious, nor the Way and righteousness as honorable, to drift through the days in confusion, drunken with life and dreaming death — this is an empty life. Losing the human form once, one suffers ten thousand calamities.
