# The Gate of Loftiness and Magnitude

The Tao Te Ching says, "The strong and rigid are companions of death; the soft and weak are companions of life." Mencius said, "He who reveres others will be reverenced by them; he who loves others will be loved by them." There is a proverb: "He who goes forth from a lowly station in the world finds it hard to move an inch by force." All these speak to the proper course of a man to humble himself and take a lowly place, and not to harbour a mind that is lofty and arrogant.

What is called loftiness and greatness is when one boasts of himself as a sage, being strong and resolute, fond of victory, having regard only for himself and none for others. But he who is not lofty in himself shall at length attain loftiness; he who is not proud in himself shall at length attain greatness. How so? Because he who is not lofty can abase himself before others; he who is not proud can make himself small before others. Being able to abase and to make oneself small is as if one had nothing, yet indeed as if one were void. Having talent but not using it; having wisdom but not employing it; hiding one's ability and showing incapacity; originally knowing, but appearing not to know; using this to meet the world, and all men rejoice in it; using this to study the Tao, and masters and friends are all pleased.

In former times, Yu, hearing words of goodness, bowed; Zi Lu, when told of his faults, rejoiced. These were all men who humbled themselves and took a low place, and did not exalt themselves or magnify themselves; therefore they became great sages and great worthies, and their fame never perished through the ages. Yet the matter of not exalting and magnifying oneself requires a true and sincere heart to carry it out before there can be any success. If outwardly one forces humility and smallness, but inwardly harbours pride and concealment, this is to be like a hidden robber in the wilderness; the inward and outward do not accord, the heart is not sincere, and the conduct will not endure far. Outwardly respectful but inwardly not reverent — this is what is called smooth words and an ingratiating look, and true benevolence is rare therein. This cannot but fail to remove the disease of loftiness and greatness, but on the contrary increases the affliction of misfortune.

Therefore, if one does not exalt oneself, one will come to be unaware that there is loftiness; if one does not magnify oneself, one will come to be unaware that there is greatness — thus all the diseases of loftiness and greatness are completely transformed. The great ancestors of former times, the masters of the sects, all pursued the path of self-abasement and self-smallness to cultivate the Tao and establish virtue, and long did not slacken; thus they fully accomplished their affairs, and finally became those whom all men could not reach.

But the confused scholars of the world, among the worldly, some have wealth, rank, and power, yet will not abase themselves before others; some possess talents and learning, yet will not abase themselves before others; some rely on seniority and respect, yet will not abase themselves before others. Among those following the Tao, some have read several volumes of alchemical scriptures and fancy themselves to have attained, yet will not abase themselves before others; some have studied certain exercises and pride themselves on embracing the Tao, yet will not abase themselves before others; some follow their own heart and act at will, proud and undaunted, yet will not abase themselves before others; some desire swift attainment and cannot endure length of time, yet will not abase themselves before others. Still more are those cunning and deceitful, knowing not to receive instruction sincerely, but instead purloining the Master's words, twisting here and there, speaking confusedly and misleading with exposed words. Some are self-opinionated, chasing the wind and catching shadows, playing the axe at the gate of the master, boasting of their skill and talents. All such are self-exalting and self-magnifying, unable to abase themselves before others, and make the matter of their life and nature a great affair.

Little do they know that the grand way of life and nature is a rare matter in the world; how can it be so lightly thought of with arrogance and pride? How can it be so lightly obtained with arrogance and pride? I exhort those who sincerely seek the Tao to quickly open the gate of loftiness and greatness. Put aside all self-satisfaction and self-contentment, all pride and ambitious mind, with one stroke. From the utmost humility and smallness take your step, and learn sincerely and truthfully. Not only will you be free from calamity and disaster in the world, but in learning the Tao you shall surely receive abundant benefit. Otherwise, with self-exaltation and self-magnification, unable to abase yourself before others, who will willingly speak of loftiness and greatness to you? To vainly think to comprehend the bright Tao — how difficult it is!
