# The Gate of Hidden Malice

The Book of Changes says: 'Fellowship with men in the open country is successful.' The Perfect Sage said: 'Be strict with yourself, yet lenient in judging others, and you will keep enmity afar.' The Ancient Master said: 'The Way is void and yet use is made of it; it may not be full.' These sayings all speak of the bearing of oneself in the world; it is essential to have a peaceful nature and feeling, and one must not conceal secret malice, for that obstructs the Way. 

Those who study the Way begin not by desiring to learn goodness, but by hating evil and striving to remove it. Yet in studying goodness and removing evil, the greatest value lies in having no mind at all; the greatest danger lies in having a mind. When there is no mind, there is no self; when there is no self, there is no other; when there is no other and no self, man is himself and himself is man, and the distinction of man and self is forgotten. 

Though men insult and humiliate, one is not aware; though men come to deceive and cheat, one is not aware; though men come to mock and jest, one is not aware; though men do harm, one is not aware; though ears hear slander, one is not aware; though the body endures great calamity, one is not aware. All external encounters, whether adverse or favourable, are met with no mind. One does not foster enmity or hatred, but dwells in a state of no disturbance. 

Just as in a common hall where learning takes place, good and evil, wise and foolish are not the same; one man has one nature, a hundred men a hundred natures; how can they accord with my intention? Should words wound, or deeds be false, hearing is as if not hearing, seeing is as if not seeing; one should respond in accord with others and overlook their faults. 

Again, if a teacher or master admonishes, reproves, or scolds, and there be faults in what is said, it is all the more necessary to quickly amend and take double heed. Much more is it so with a true teacher, who selects good material, and if the person be indeed a man of purpose, specially disciplines him to increase his resolve. If one be worthless, he is left to his own convenience and abandoned to neglect. 

Therefore, those who learn the Way, whether in following the world or in learning, must not evoke private feelings, but always keep an impartial heart; only then will they make progress. The ignorant men of the world only wish for others to follow their wishes, and do not themselves follow others. They desire flattery, and dislike plain speech. If there be the slightest offence, they are displeased. They forget great benefits and remember small grievances. Malice and poison hide in the breast, accumulated year after year and month after month without being released. Though outwardly they may seem smooth and well-spoken, inwardly they harbour sharpened points. They do not cease from revenge. 

Even if they themselves have faults, when teachers or friends point them out and warn them, they do not repent; if openly reproved, they argue strongly over right and wrong; if secretly censured, they slander and make enemies. Such malice is unparalleled, and such men are rogues. They never consider the Way of nature and life; how could such rogues know or obtain the malice they harbour? When anger is not removed, and demeanour not changed, one falls into the sea of birth and death and endless transmigration. Is it not sorrowful? 

I urge those who sincerely seek the Way to quickly open the gate of hidden malice, to cast away all the poisonous vapours of anger and hatred accumulated through life, all the foolish and evil thoughts. Respond peacefully to all things, always yielding to others, bearing burdens and insults; be forged in the great fire-pit and struggle on the field of contention. All things are emptiness; admit not a single particle; in time you will meet the true teacher who will raise you out of the sea of suffering. Otherwise, if you cannot bear every word and phrase, stumbling and colliding, vexations will arise, vipers and scorpions will fill your breast, wasps and flies your belly, and in vain you will dream of hearing the Way; it will be difficult indeed.
