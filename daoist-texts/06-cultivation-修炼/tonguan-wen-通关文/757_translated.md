# The Barrier of the Book-Demon

The Awakening of Truth says: The Treatise on Agreement and the Song of the Scripture expound the utmost truth, yet do not apply the stage of the alchemical work to the text. To know where the secret formula communicates with the primal source, one must together with the immortals deliberate carefully. Again it is said: In the trigrams the established images are the original forms; when one attains the image, one forgets words and the meaning is manifest of itself. The whole world of confused disciples clings only to the images, yet proceeds by the qi of the trigrams hoping to ascend on high. The Master Shang Yang says: The Great Way has always been famed by strong names; the Yin Symbols, the Way and Virtue, began with the Scripture's existence. The sequence of the Immortals' elixir texts continues; how can the secret formula be made clear upon paper? These all speak of reading the scriptures without partiality or attachment to the scriptures themselves.

The canonical texts and treatises are like thousands of comparisons and myriad metaphors, so as to open a clear path for later students, point out the Great Way, cleave through the false and show the true. Among them are the medicines true and false, their action right or wrong, the order of operations, the cultivation of nature and life, there is not one thing wanting; but their words are secret and their principles profound. They compare the visible to the invisible, employ images to express the formless; they are not to be lightly perused and known, nor can they be understood by private conjecture. Much less is the study of nature and life like things of the world that have form and image and can be explained clearly in words and books. As to the reason of nature and life, and the subtlety of the Great Way, to debate it is to err, to speak of it is to lose the truth. Although the elixir texts and the child books strive to describe it in form, that which is spoken is less than the reality; that which is written does not come forth from the writing; those who can speak and write are but approximate. The student of the Way, by diligent application and investigation, who understands the general outline will be able to discern the gates, distinguish the false from the true, and thence seek the clear master, then will there be progress.

If one clings to the scriptures and guesses by one's own mind, relying on private prejudice, and self-asserts that the Way lies here, without seeking the right from those who have it, one errs greatly. To cast aside the scriptures and argue not at all is a great mistake; yet to cling to the scriptures without seeking teachers is an even greater mistake. Both abandoning and clinging to books are wrong. Among worldly confused learners, having glanced through a few elixir books, seeing mention of lead, mercury, sand, and silver, if these are not taken internally, they cast them aside as mere kindling; seeing talk of male and female, if not entering the inner elixir, they cast them off as mere taking and seizing; seeing the talk of dragon, tiger, tortoise, and serpent, without doubt taking them for liver and lung, and so judge heart and kidney; seeing the talk of inversion and reverse movement, without doubt taking it as ascent from below, and so judge as forward raising; seeing the talk of purity and non-action, without doubt taking it as empty and silent, and so guess it to be abiding thought; seeing the talk of method and activity, without doubt taking it as transport, and so mistake it for twisting and turning; seeing the talk of the mud pellet, the Yellow Court, the primal gate, the myriad wondrous portals, and Kunlun peak, they suspect them to be bodily caverns with place and measure; seeing the talk of the valley spirit, the infant, the holy embryo, the golden elixir, the dharma body, they suspect there is within the body a gathering of qi and blood. Such are the kinds, not one alone, each depending on his own view, grasping a gate, taking the false for the true; thus a life of emptiness, accomplishing nothing at last. Not only is it profitless, but it is harmful. The cause is that all cling to the books as the Way, without seeking clear teachers, falling into the book-demon and misdoing the great matter.

The Sage says: Learn broadly and inquire carefully. If one only learns broadly and inquires not carefully, this is the one who is cleverer than Yan and Min, but without meeting a true master guesses rashly. I exhort the sincere student of the Way: quickly open the barrier of the book-demon. Do not be misled by the books; first carefully peruse the scriptures, distinguish false from true, identify the gates, seek out clear masters to verify right and wrong. Never be self-conceited, seeming right while wrong, and hastily make an end of it. Otherwise, clinging to books as the Way, thinking oneself to have attained, and presumptuously imagining the Way, is hard indeed.
