# Holding to the Appearance of Connection

The Diamond Sutra says: "One should not see the Tathāgata by his thirty-two marks."  
The Sutra of Perfect Enlightenment says: "This present body of mine is a compound of the Four Great Elements."  
The Awakening of Reality says: "The yang within and the yin essence are not firm; cultivating alone one thing, one turns emaciated and weak. Toils of the body and pressing on shadows are not the Way; to take in breath and eat the rosy clouds is altogether madness."

Moreover, the later preface says: "The scholars of this age take lead and mercury as the two qi, point to the viscera as the Five Phases, divide heart and kidney as Kan and Li, regard liver and lung as Dragon and Tiger, conceive spirit and qi as father and mother, hold to the fluids as lead and mercury, not discerning rising and sinking, nor distinguishing principal and subordinate; what difference is there in mistaking another’s wealth for one’s own property, or calling what is alien one’s own child?"  
The ancient immortals say: "Do not hold to this body as being the Way; outside this body there is the true body."  
All these words mean to say, do not hold the coloured body to be the Way.

The Way of cultivating Reality, the Way of the Prior Heaven, the Way of the Prior Heaven is able to transform the formless into form, able to bring forth the substantial image from the non-image, able to wrest creation, steal yin and yang, reverse the mechanism of qi, comprehend birth and death; it is not comparable with all who work on the coloured body.  
The coloured body is a thing compounded of the Four Great Elements; outwardly there are the eyes, ears, nose, tongue, mouth; inwardly the heart, liver, spleen, lung, kidney; together with the bones, joints, and apertures, all are false things, not one of them true.  
When the great limit comes, it is but a heap of rotten bones and foul flesh.

If one hold to this body in cultivation, how shall one understand nature and life, and be delivered from birth and death? Therefore the ancient master says: "What causes me great trouble is that I have a body; if I had no body, what trouble would I have?"  
It may be known that the coloured body is the great trouble of life; because it is the great trouble, the patriarchs have left the great path of the Golden Elixir, teaching men to cultivate nature and life, to discard the false and preserve the true, to escape from this great illusion.  
Having escaped the great trouble, there will be no trouble remaining. No trouble is the true body.  
The true body is also called the Dharma-body, also called the Yang-Spirit.

This body when perfected will not be drowned in water, not burnt in fire, nor hindered by metal or stone; yin and yang cannot mould it, creation cannot restrain it; it is co-eternal with heaven and earth, equally bright with sun and moon. Those who cultivate the coloured body, how can they attain this state?  
The confused scholars of the world cannot distinguish true from false, right from wrong; they learn disorderly and rashly, as if walking by night, as if acting in a dream.  
Some shake bones and swing marrow, some push forward and move backward, some tear east and patch west, some drive qi to the crown gate, some force essence to ascend to the brain, some practise the Eight Brocades to enliven the bones, some use the Six Syllables to raise qi, some regard the space between the two kidneys as the primal pass, some take the front of the kidney and the back of the navel as the Yellow Court, some see the mouth and nose as the mysterious gate, some hold the elixir field as the root of life, some take the Heavenly Valley as the ground of nature, some regard heart and kidney as infant and maiden, some conceive liver and lung as Azure Dragon and White Tiger, some breathe through the navel wheel to the elixir field as embryo breath, some drive qi to strike the three passes and open them behind the brain.

Moreover, there are those who wipe their eyes and swallow fluids, inhale the pure and exhale the turbid, touch the navel and strangle the bowels, and the like; these manifold manipulations cannot be numbered. All are called holding to appearances, all are but working on the skin and flesh sack, breaking and inserting toys within the bag of illusion, utterly separated from the Way of Prior Heaven and life.  
When the appointed years and months are fulfilled, there will be nothing to hold on to; is it not grievous?

I exhort the true-hearted learner of the Way to hasten to open the mouth of holding to appearances and connections.  
Lay solid and real efforts upon the two characters Nature and Life, tracing out their resting-place.  
What is Nature? What is Life? Where does Nature abide? Where does Life lodge?  
If truly the two characters Nature and Life are distinguished clearly and recognised surely, then it will be known that Nature and Life are not in the eyes, ears, nose, mouth, tongue, or body; not in the heart, liver, spleen, lung, kidney; not in the three hundred and sixty bones and joints; not in the limbs, arteries and veins and blood; but are other secret things without place or limit, without form or image.  
Not inside, not outside, but precisely in the realm of void and solitude.

From this progress there will be a resting-place, so as not to mistake the false for the true, nor be misled by other paths. Otherwise, not knowing what Nature and Life are, one blindly fumbles about the body, doing disorderly work on that which has form and substance, vainly imagining attainment of the Way; difficult indeed!
