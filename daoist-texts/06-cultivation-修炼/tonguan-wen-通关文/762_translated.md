# Song of Absolute Words

Once I recalled the years when downcast and forlorn,  
One thought sincere sought out the true Master.  
To Yan and to the South of the River I wandered in vain,  
In Shan-you and Guan-zhong I ran empty and swift.  
Before my eyes appeared lions and camels monstrous,  
At my ears only the words of foxes were heard.  
All say the immortals are easy to meet,  
Who then understands the true Way is hardest to know?  

When misfortune reaches its utmost, good fortune comes, the spirits declare,  
Pointing to the Golden City for the seeking of the Great Way.  
The Elder of the Niche and Valley is no common man,  
His words and utterances all profound and deep.  
He spoke close to my ear, revealing the gate of the primal female,  
At that time yin and yang were able to be overturned.  
Great mechanism, great use is but according to Nature,  
Not like the artifices of the six paths beside it.  

At parting he entrusted me to guard with care,  
First exhaust human affairs, then discuss again.  
Because the seat of parting is early,  
The future is uncertain and the heart is troubled.  

Thirteen years I bore the doubts and perplexities,  
On the Han’s banks I was fortunate to receive immortal’s radiance.  
I unearthed Heaven’s root and Earth’s marrow,  
Pointing out the black liver and the rabbit’s entrails.  
The cooking of the fire, slow or quick, was carefully explained,  
The order of the work before and after clearly taught.  
To cultivate nature and destiny there is exhortation and peace,  
To observe the orifices and subtleties in their proper season.  

When the Four Symbols harmonize, the Elixir returns,  
The Five Elements blend into one and the embryo is formed.  
When yin is exhausted and yang is pure, the circle is perfected,  
Breaking through empty space where birth and death are no more.  

Thus I heard these true words in my ear,  
Suddenly all was clear, penetrating into subtle mystery.  
From beginning to end the order was understood,  
Henceforth I knew the heaven beyond heaven.  

Before me were fine flowers and precious grasses,  
Within me were pure white snow and yellow shoots.  
Left and right were all pearls and jewels,  
Before and behind all were golden lotuses.  

How shall this secret of Heaven be sought and obtained?  
If sought, one must resolve early with fixed purpose.  
First cast aside all affairs of the world,  
Next sweep away all ties of sentiment.  

With a humble heart approach the wise and bright,  
Probe deeply the subtlety, explore reason with thought.  
When bitterness ends, sweetness naturally arises,  
With firm resolve at length attain the true treasure.  

I, Yuan Ping, have always formed deep vows,  
With great impartiality and a heart without selfishness.  
Only to hope that all may ascend to the saintly realm,  
Always rejoicing that each may hear the sound of the Law.  

The crooked path confounds the true Way,  
Copper dots and mercury gold fill the genuine gold.  
Many learners enter the net of the sky,  
Men of ambition often advance into the black pine forest.  

Where shall these grievances be told?  
At the critical moment repentance is too late, lamentations vain.  
Generally the principles are not examined with care,  
Because of suspended void and no fixed hold.  

Who knows the Holy Way has true transmission?  
Who understands that creation is not easily stolen?  
If not by great conduct and great work,  
Penglai is but a span, and the heart is restless in vain.  

Laughable are the foolish men of the world,  
Madly seeking the heavenly thoroughfare yet falling into dust.  
Blind leading blind injures the yin virtue,  
Errors passed down upon errors lead into the bewildering ford.  

Now I cannot bear to see the Great Way fall,  
Therefore I carefully set forth the ancestral lineage.  
Not for fame or to fish for praise,  
How should I seek to stir words and rouse the lips?  

Contemplation and insight directly break through the parables,  
The Book of Changes unfolds the true sequence of fire and time.  
Before and after discriminate the difficult, distinguish right and wrong,  
The meeting of Tao and Virtue defines the rules.  

Original purpose and function all plainly spoken,  
Medicines of understanding all carefully recounted.  
A guide to enlightenment and the unfolding of subtlety,  
Breaking doubts, passing through barriers, joining with companions on the Way.  

The phrases grow ever simpler, the meaning clearer,  
The programme is small but the work is exquisite.  
Careful humility can reach the highest,  
Cautious subtlety from emptiness is able to be fulfilled.  

If one still abandons the near for the distant,  
Surely one will bring great error upon the path ahead.  
Better to first cure the sickness of one’s own body,  
Do not leap stages and imagine immortality.  

Having spoken thus, no meaning remains,  
The rules of cultivation leave no room for excess.  
A thousand words and ten thousand all unfold the truth,  
Each phrase, each sentence, carries deep meaning.  

Not like empty talk of mere outward form,  
All are the secrets of attaining immortality and the Way.  
Though in this present world few are the kindred spirits,  
I leave it for later sages to carefully deliberate and discuss.  

I am now old and impatient,  
My heart fulfilled, I desire to cease speaking.  
Sealing the mouth and closing the door to destroy vain thoughts,  
Rejecting show to embrace substance and regard the origin.  

No longer looking at the dust of the world with the eyes,  
My heart long hangs the banner of the primal unity.  
Like a fool, like a simpleton without knowledge,  
Yin and yang and creation are stirred with a single hand.
