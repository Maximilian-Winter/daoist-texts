# Annotations and Explanations on the Cantong Qi, Part the Second

The numbers of the Five Phases are expounded, brief and not diffuse. Take water to excite fire, and suddenly the light is extinguished. The sun and moon eclipse each other, ever at the new and full moons. When water is abundant, Kan invades Yang; when fire declines, Li causes the day to grow dim. Yin and Yang mutually feed and consume each other; their interchange and influence follow the Way spontaneously. Names serve to fix the feelings; characters serve to express the nature. When Metal returns to its nature at the beginning, then it is called the Returning Elixir. I dare not speak idly, but imitate the writings of the sages. The ancient records designate it as the Dragon-Tiger Elixir; the Yellow Emperor named it the Exquisite Metal Flower. Huainan calls it Autumn Stone; Yuyang terms it Yellow Bud. The worthy can hold and practise it; the unworthy must not be associated. The Way of ancient and present is one; it is the subject of mutual discourse and deliberation. Let the learner redouble his efforts, and keep it in mind with deep reflection. The utmost essentials are plainly declared, and clearly do not deceive me.

The Way of the Golden Elixir is the Way of the harmony of Yin and Yang. When Yin and Yang are harmonious, the Elixir is born; when they are contrary, the Way is lost. By expounding the numbers of the generation and overcoming of the Five Phases, one immediately knows the Way of the Golden Elixir, most concise and not diffuse. For example, take water to excite fire and the fire is extinguished; water overcomes fire. The sun at the new moon is eclipsed, Yin being strong over Yang; the moon at full is waning, Yang being strong over Yin. Again, the moon's substance is water, abundant while the Yang light fades; the sun's colour is fire, declining and the white day grows dim. All these are signs of Yin and Yang being solitary, isolated, and not mutually aiding. But if Yin and Yang correspond, mutually responding in due season, the Way issues naturally; what injury is there?

Man's true nature belongs to Yang; true feelings belong to Yin. Originally Yin and Yang are one qi; nature and feelings accord, blended as the heavenly principle. Unknowing and unconscious, conforming to the emperor's rule. Unknowing and unconscious are the substance of nature; conforming to the emperor's rule is the function of feeling. Nature and feeling are natural, both springing from no-mind. These two come from the same origin, but differ in name, as name and character. Name serves to fix feeling, feeling compares to name; character serves to express nature, nature compares to character. Name and character together denote one thing; how can nature and feeling be two? But after interaction with the acquired, truth contains falsity; Yin and Yang separate; nature and feeling oppose; they are discordant. As water abundant in Kan invades Yang, fire declining in Li brings dusk, true feeling changes into false feeling, true nature changes into false nature. The Way of the Golden Elixir is to follow feeling and accord with nature, seek truth within falsity, seek life within death, so that Yin and Yang unite, returning to the original blended heavenly principle, unknowing and unconscious, conforming to the emperor's rule in its original aspect, this is called the Returning Elixir. Returning Elixir means returning to the original thing possessed from the beginning, without increase or decrease; also called returning to origin and restoring to root. I dare not speak idly, but imitate the writings of the sages; so the Immortal Elder relates his own annotations, grounded in tradition, not baseless words. This Returning Elixir, from ancient times the sages have used various convenient names and diverse terms. The ancient records call it the Dragon-Tiger Elixir; the Yellow Emperor calls it Exquisite Metal; Huainan calls it Autumn Stone; Yuyang calls it Yellow Bud; the Cantong Qi calls it Golden Sand and Knife Jade. All these are but figures describing the single Returning Elixir. In this Way, the superior man hearing it applies himself diligently, therefore it is said the worthy can hold and practise it. The inferior man hearing it laughs loudly and departs, therefore it is said the unworthy must not be associated. Why is the Way of ancient and present one, the subject of mutual discourse and deliberation? The Great Way of the Golden Elixir has been handed down by the sages of every age, from mouth to mouth, from heart to heart; they have mutually discoursed and uttered their schemes; this is the learning of true knowledge and vision, not like vain guesses and private opinions. Though attainment of the Way may be earlier or later, the cultivation is the same, as in the Cantong Qi. The two masters Wei and Xu, both disciples of Yin Zhenren, mutually verified their writings and teachings, in discourse and deliberation; how could there be falsehood? If the learner can strive to think deeply, suddenly grasping the essentials, plunging into the cave of principle, just as the Immortal Elder discoursed and deliberated, diligently practising, he will surely attain the Way; then the Immortal Elder will clearly not deceive me. Alas, how comes it that fools of the world consider the Cantong Qi to be a mere matter of smelting common sand and mercury, thus betraying the Immortal Elder's sincere authorship, slandering the sacred Way, truly sowing the seeds of hell, without repentance, yet still calling themselves cultivators of truth? Is this not shameful unto death? This is the meaning of the paragraph “Only the sages of old” in the text of this section.

Cinnabar thrown into fire loses colour and returns to lead. Ice and snow, warmed by hot water, melt and become the Great Mystery. Metal takes sand as its chief, and blends harmoniously with mercury. Transformation depends on its truth; beginning and end mutually follow. If one desires to make the food of concealed immortals, it is proper to use things of the same kind. Plant grain to grow millet; hatch chickens from eggs. Like supports nature; things are thus easily fashioned. Fish eyes cannot become pearls; wild herbs cannot become timber. Like begets like; unlike fails to make treasure. Swallows and sparrows do not breed phoenixes; foxes and rabbits do not nurse horses. Water flows downward, not upward; fire moves upward, not downward moistening. The world abounds with scholars, proud of their talents. By chance they meet not their match, wasting fire and exhausting wealth. According to texts, they rashly act according to their own notions, lacking cause and basis, losing the measure of restraint. They pound Qiang stone gall, mica and alum. Sulphur burns in Yuzhang; clay and mercury are mixed and treated. Five stones of copper beat beneath, used as auxiliary pivots. Heterogeneous natures are not of one kind; how could they dwell in one body? Thousands of attempts must end in ten thousands of failures; those seeking craftiness become fools. Fortune fails to meet with success; only the perfect man knows. From youth to old age, doubts arise midway. Turning away from the Way, keeping to error's path; missing broad view and insight, how can one rightly reckon the method?

The last section declared that Metal returns to its nature, thus it is called the Returning Elixir. If one abandons nature and feeling, taking all manner of unkindred things to save life and preserve form, how is this reasonable? Moreover, like cinnabar, it is black lead burnt; cast into fire, it still turns to lead. Ice and snow are condensed cold water; warmed, they dissolve into water. Cinnabar results from mercury; exposed to fire, it again becomes mercury. Gold with mercury is white; exposed to fire, it returns to its yellow. Such things, their transformations depend on the truth of their nature. Hence at first one may transform this into that, and at last that into this; beginning and end are the same, easy to achieve success. Is it possible to desire to make the concealed immortal's food without using things of the same kind, and yet succeed? Surely not.

The word “concealed” means to conceal the innate qi and to not act rashly with the will. This is what Mencius called “I am good at nourishing my vast flowing qi.” The word “food” means to seek the real by means of the void, the meaning of a full belly. This is what Mencius called “Qi is the greatest, the strongest; nourish it uprightly and without harm, then it fills the space between heaven and earth.” To nourish the vast qi until it fills heaven and earth, unbounded by creation, unchangeable by all things, that is concealed food. Man inherits a point of vast innate upright qi when born; he must conceal and feed the vast upright qi to complete the Way; it is not to feed on all unkindred things. For example, planting grain by millet, hatching chickens from eggs, like begets like, supporting nature, things are thus perfected, not by mutual coercion. Fish eyes cannot become pearls; wild herbs cannot become timber; swallows and sparrows do not breed phoenixes; foxes and rabbits do not nurse horses. Water does not flow upward; fire does not moisten downward; feeling does not correspond; nature does not accord; how then can there be success? The world has many scholars, proud of their talents, seeking no true master. Hearing of the Golden Elixir, they doubt it is a matter of furnace fire smelting. According to ancient texts, they rashly discuss and guess, losing restraint, wasting wealth, concocting metals and stones, vainly hoping to take food and live long. But they do not know these heterogeneous things differ from their nature; how can they remain in the body? Thousands of attempts, ten thousands of failures, unrepentant, still full of foolish thoughts, blaming fortune and fate, until death without repentance. Alas! Such men forget their original intention, doubts arise midway, they depart from the right and enter error, yet still deceive themselves and others, thinking they have gained. They write books and set forth doctrines of side paths and external ways, leading the blind by the blind, with narrow and shallow views; how can they rightly reckon the method? This is the meaning of the paragraph “He Shang Chanu” in this section.

When Metal enters the fierce fire, its colour does not lose its essence and light. Since the beginning of creation, the sun and moon have not lost their brightness. Metal does not lose its weight; the sun and moon appear as usual. Metal is originally born from the moon; at new moon the sun imparts its sign. Metal returns to its mother; at the dark moon day and night enclose it. Concealing its outline, sinking in the cavernous void. Metal restores its original nature; the mighty light in the cauldron is the feast.

The last section spoke of desiring to make the food of concealed immortals, proper to use things of the same kind. What are things of the same kind? They are the true nature of the heavenly good originally possessed, descending into the acquired, that is, the feelings of true knowledge that the Way-heart emits. These feelings belong to Metal in the Five Phases; the elixir books all call it true gold. This gold endures ten thousand kalpas without decay; it is the ladder of sages, the seed of immortals and Buddhas. To understand nature and life, if one discards this true gold, there is no other method. Observe the common metals of the world; their nature is very strong, their substance most firm; entering fire, they are refined and made brighter. It is said that true gold fears not the fire. The essence and light of gold's colour are not lost by fierce fire, like the brilliance of sun and moon not diminished by their shining. Since the beginning of creation, all things arise and perish, exist and vanish, only sun and moon appear constant. Metal is enduring and not destroyed; thus gold shines with the sun and moon, and endures likewise. All metal is such; thus true gold is known.

The true knowledge of true gold is the feeling of no feeling, true void containing wonderful being, not attached to colour or form of existence or non-existence; it is Yang within Yin, taking form like the moonlight, hence it is said metal is born from the moon. Metal born from the moon, the function of the Golden Elixir should imitate the waxing and waning of the moon, its advance and retreat. The moon is purely Yin; reflecting the sun it produces light, the light is the image of metal. When the moon is new, the sun comes to give its sign; the moon receives sun's light and conceives thunder; on the third day one Yang appears on the earth of Kun, this is metal returning to its mother. Earth can give birth to metal; hence Kun earth is mother of metal. Metal returns to mother, called the southwest gaining a friend. From one Yang to two Yang to three Yang, fifteen brightnesses fill the moon; fullness then wanes. Sixteen is a Yin within the womb; reaching thirty dark, northeast loses its friend; the sun encloses the moon, becoming pure Kun; concealing outline and shape, sinking and disappearing into the cavernous void. Compare this to the cultivator of the Way, in the utmost emptiness and stillness, true and spiritual knowledge united. Suddenly a point of true spiritual light appears, named Spirit Brightness; also called white within black, gold within water, the innate true one qi. Like the moon borrowing sun's light, one Yang born on Kun earth, gradually appearing, brilliant and full, true spirit ever present. Also by the ten months’ nurturing power, preventing dangers and worries, gathering spirit, not showing edges or corners, concealing and sinking, returning to the land of non-being. Like moonlight waning and without trace, sun and moon embracing as one.

Metal restores its original nature; true knowledge’s feeling and spiritual knowledge’s nature blend and unite; feeling returns to nature; nature fixes feeling forgotten; unknowing and unconscious, conforming to emperor’s rule; metal thus returns to its source. The mighty light in the cauldron is the feast; feast is fire’s colour. When feeling returns to nature, nature loves its feeling; feeling is nature; nature is feeling; good knowledge and good ability, still and unmoved, responding and thus communicating, spiritual knowledge is not obscure; fire returns to its root. Metal returns to source; fire returns to root; metal and fire share the same chamber; the medicine is fire; fire is the medicine. In the furnace, the whole line glows red; this is called the mighty light of the cauldron’s feast. Cauldron but called light, the cauldron of void spirit; light but called might, the mighty light. Firm and strong, void and spiritual, having qi but no substance, hard for things to harm; true gold restoring its nature. This is the meaning of the paragraph from “The sun flows pearls” to “Condensed and firm” in this section.

The fire record is not falsely made, expounding the I Ching to explain it. The method of the crescent moon, the furnace and cauldron, the White Tiger as the pivot of refining. Mercury as the flowing pearl, the Azure Dragon accompanying it. Raise the east to join the west; soul and spirit mutually bind. The upper crescent is the number eight of Dui; the lower mystery is also eight of Gen. Two crescents combine their essence; Heaven and Earth’s body thus formed. Two eights correspond to one jin; the Way of Change is upright and not inclined.

The last section nourished metal and fire in one chamber; metal restored its nature. But metal restoring its nature is the use of the Yin symbol. If the work is incomplete, one cannot form the square and circle. The fire record is not falsely made, expounding the I Ching to explain it; fire is indeed no fire, relying on the qi of Yin and Yang harmonizing as fire. But Yin and Yang have the cycle of waxing and waning, growth and decline; thus the sage’s fire record is made. Its words are not empty and vain, but founded on the images of the hexagrams and lines of the I Ching, on good and bad fortune, regret and blame. The Kan hexagram of the I Ching images the moon; the moon belongs to water, located in the southwest pure Yin; slight Yang emerging, named gold in water, its light inclining up and down, thus called crescent moon. This is the mechanism of Yang advancing and Yin declining; hence the symbol of crescent moon for furnace and cauldron, not Kan itself. The crescent moon’s light arises from the west; thus the symbol is metal; it is the White Tiger, representing feeling in man. Metal gives birth to water; the tiger can bite man, representing vain feelings; water gives birth to metal; the tiger can protect man, representing true feelings. True feeling appearing, water does not overflow but returns to origin; then true essence is born. Hence the White Tiger true feeling is the pivot of refining true water. This is called the use of the Five Elements overturned; the tiger is born in water. The Li hexagram images the sun; the sun belongs to fire; symbolized by flowing pearls. Fire is born of wood; fire contains wood qi; symbolized by Azure Dragon, representing nature in man. Wood gives birth to fire; the dragon can harm man, representing qi nature; fire gives birth to wood; the dragon can nourish man, representing true nature. True nature appearing, fire does not blaze but returns to root; hence the sun and Azure Dragon accompany it. The Five Elements do not proceed in order; the dragon issues from fire. The dragon’s nature belongs to Yang as soul; the tiger’s feeling belongs to Yin as spirit. Gold is born in water; wood is born in fire; true feeling and true nature meet; soul and spirit mutually bind and never separate. Soul and spirit mutually bind; Yin contains Yang, like Kan; like the crescent moon’s metal of eight taels; Yang contains Yin, like Li; like the waning crescent moon’s water of half a jin. Firm and gentle both return to central rectitude; metal and water rest mutually; water and fire mutually aid; true nature and true feeling, the qi of two strings, unite as one, returning to Qian firmness and Kun gentleness, the original essence of the I Ching, good knowledge and good ability. They are comrades with Heaven and mates with Earth; the Golden Elixir condenses, and life’s foundation is eternal.

This is the principle of change in the I Ching; hence it is precious and does not incline to ruin. This is the meaning of the paragraph from “Golden Flower first chants” to “How dare it make sound” in this section.

The world loves petty arts, not examining the depth of the Way. They abandon the correct for the erroneous path; desiring speed they block the way. Like the blind not knowing the staff; the deaf listening to the Shang and Gong notes. Casting nets in water for pheasants and hares; climbing mountains seeking fish and dragons. Planting wheat hoping to reap millet; moving a compass to find the square. Exerting strength and exhausting spirit, all year without seeing success. If you desire to know the method of concealed food, keep it simple and not diffuse.

The last section said to harmonize Yin and Yang; the timing must conform to the I Ching principle to accomplish great matters. If one opposes the I Ching principle, that is no Way. The ancient immortal said, “Form is completed by the Way; life is prolonged by the art.” The art to prolong life can steal Yin and Yang, seize creation, turn Heaven and Earth, move sun and moon, reverse the Dipper, twist the mechanism of qi, position Heaven and Earth, nurture all things; this is the greatest art in the cave of reason from ancient to present. Only the great men born with wisdom can use it. All other fools and deluded men do not examine the depth of the Way, fond only of petty arts, abandoning the correct for the wrong, entering side doors; like the blind who do not recognize the staff, the deaf who do not hear music, catching pheasants and hares in the water, seeking fish and dragons on the mountain, planting wheat hoping to reap millet, moving a compass to find the square; all these waste their spirit and power in vain. Do they not know that the great method of immortal concealed food is simple and not diffuse, and may accomplish the elixir within an hour? This is the meaning of the paragraph from “Not obtaining its principle” to “Contrary to the Way” in this section.

The numbers of Zi and Wu combine to three; Wu and Ji are called five. When three and five harmonize, the eight stones form the proper order. Inhale and exhale mutually nurture; standing breath is husband and wife. Yellow earth is father of metal; flowing pearl is son of water. Water regards earth as ghost; earth controls water and it does not rise. The Vermilion Bird is fire essence, balancing to regulate victory and defeat. Water abundant extinguishes fire; both die and return to thick earth. The three natures unite and meet; original nature shares a common ancestor.

The last section proposed the method of concealed food, brief and not diffuse. What is the method? It is the method of harmonizing the Five Phases, blending into one. Zi belongs to Kan; Kan is water; Wu belongs to Li; Li is fire.

Kan receives Wu; Li receives Ji. Kan is solid, true knowledge; Wu is the trust of true knowledge; Li is empty, spiritual knowledge; Ji is trust of spiritual knowledge. Kan one, Li two, numbers combine to three; Wu and Ji dwell in the centre; their number is called five. Outside, Kan fills Li, using true one water to aid bright spiritual fire; inside, Wu flows to Ji, using firmness and trust to unite gentleness and compliance. This is the harmony of three and five. When three and five harmonize, innate nature, feelings, and spirit govern acquired spirit and soul; the eight trigrams’ Yin and Yang are fixed; creation’s order is established. The eight stones are images of the eight trigrams. Yang is the order; Yin is the regulation. Kan and Li are the function of the eight trigrams. Kan and Li harmonize, and the other six trigrams’ Yin and Yang all follow in harmony, each attaining its proper place. With order and regulation established, one movement is exhalation, which produces Yang; one stillness is inhalation, which produces Yin. One Yin and one Yang, motion and stillness mutually related; inhale and exhale intercommunicate, mutually nurturing; feeling and nature harmonize; standing breath is husband and wife. The innate qi comes from the void; condenses into one millet-sized pearl. This is the meaning of the paragraph from “Elixir sand and wood essence” to “All return to Wu and Ji” in this section.

Water, fire, and earth are all essential things in the Way. When the three unite, the elixir and sage arise, and return to the innate. When the three separate, life and creatures arise, and fall to the acquired. Earth can produce metal; water can produce wood. Earth produces metal; thus yellow earth is father of metal. Water produces wood; thus flowing pearl is son of water. Why can earth produce metal? It uses Li’s Ji, the empty spiritual true intention, to overcome Kan’s turbid water, seeking true knowledge’s metal feeling; thus earth controls water and water does not rise. Why can water produce wood? It uses Kan’s essence-one true water to overcome Li’s fierce fire, preserving spiritual knowledge’s wood nature. Thus water is abundant and fire is extinguished. What is strange is, water extinguishes fire; how can earth control water? Fire regulates victory and defeat; how can water extinguish? The difference is that water includes turbid water and essence-one water; fire includes fierce flame and gentle fire. Earth controls the turbid water; water extinguishes the fierce fire. When turbid water dries up, essence-one water is born; when fierce fire ceases, gentle fire appears. Both die and return to thick earth; earth controls water, water dries and forms mud; water extinguishes fire, fire ceases and ashes become earth. Mutual generation and overcoming, in overcoming there is generation. True knowledge and spiritual knowledge accord; true feeling and true nature share one qi; firmness and gentleness both return to central rectitude, like the meeting of crow and rabbit on the yellow path. The medicine is fire; fire is medicine; water, fire, and earth, three surnames in one family; condensed into one millet-sized Golden Elixir, sharing one ancestor.

When Yin and Yang unite, it is called sharing one ancestor. If Yin and Yang do not unite, there is still partial isolation; not yet the blended image of one qi; one cannot say they share one ancestor. The correct text says, “Containing the original void and precariousness, scattering essence into the seed.” The void and precariousness is the place of Yin and Yang union, also the place where sun and moon combine and move in harmony; hence the presence of original essence. Original essence is another name for Golden Elixir, also called ancestor. This is the meaning of the paragraph from “Firm and gentle alternately arise” to “Scattering essence into the seed” in this section.

Great victory still prolongs life; the Returning Elixir may be taken by mouth. Metal’s nature does not decay or rot, therefore it is the treasure of all things. The art practitioner’s concealed food yields long life. Earth roams the four seasons, keeping the boundaries and rules. Golden sand enters the five viscera; mist disperses like wind and rain. Steaming permeates the limbs; the colour is bright and beautiful. White hair all turns black; lost teeth grow old anew. The old man returns to vigorous youth; the aged woman becomes a charming maiden. Changing form, escaping worldly disasters; called the True Man.

The Way of the Golden Elixir, once attained, is forever attained; most spiritual, most divine; immediate in its effect; those who know it directly reach the other shore. But alas, many of the world do not believe, thinking such things do not exist in the world. Consider Great Victory: it is a corporeal dross of the acquired, but if taken long it still prolongs life. How much more then the Golden Elixir, the supreme treasure of the innate, perfected and taken within; how could it fail to grant longevity? All metal’s nature is firm and strong, enduring and not decaying; the treasure of all things. True gold’s qi is pure Yang; how could concealed food fail to produce immortality? Earth arises from the four seasons; the four times and eight festivals all follow their rules, flowing naturally without cease. One who takes golden sand and whose limbs and body change and brighten can escape disaster and avoid calamity. If a man of will obtains a master’s secret formula, he will naturally act and enter the non-action; perfect nature and life; body and spirit both wondrous; accord with the Way and harmonize with truth; called the True Man, whose life equals Heaven’s. As to firm limbs, bright colour, white hair turning black, lost teeth regrowing, these are among other matters. This is the meaning of the paragraph “As if carefully encountering” in this section.

The Immortal Elder’s annotations in three parts penetrate the meaning of Boh Yang, revealing what the Cantong Qi did not reveal. Among them no drug or fire timing is neglected. Only fearing that men lack earnest heart and great fortune, and so cannot see the truth. The preface says: “Only by knowing the great image can one attain longevity.” The Immortal Elder surely does not deceive me.
