# Discourse on the True Orifice of the Primal Female

The learner who desires to cultivate the Great Way, and to comprehend nature and life, must above all else recognize the gate of the Primal Female. The gate of the Primal Female is the primal pass, a single orifice. This orifice has a gate with two leaves, one opens and the other closes; it is nine feet high and five feet broad. Without the gate there is a spiritual officer keeping watch; within the gate there are dragons and tigers as guards. Within the central hall is a single chamber, communicating in all directions, and there dwells a perfected man, with hair dishevelled and feet bare. His body is clad in a garment of five colours, his waist girded with long yellow and green ribbons. In his hand he holds a golden light as a sceptre, seated steadily upon a natural bed. Behind him leans a shadowless screen, before him hangs a glass lamp; the curtains are drawn close, unmoved, unshaken. His eyes are not lightly opened, his mouth not rashly parted. On his left is a Golden Boy; on his right, a Jade Girl. At times his eyes open, and light fills heaven and earth; darkness and the infernal regions are illuminated everywhere. At times he opens his mouth, and his breath fills the universe; spirits, demons, and evil fiends all flee afar. He holds the power of creation, grasps the workings of yin and yang, holds the register of life and death, wields the handle of nature and destiny. If a man can see him, and with sincere heart worship him, attending upon him morning and evening without pause, then the perfected man has the wine of life-prolonging and the elixir of longevity; those who taste of them are reborn, their bones exchanged, passing from death into life. But in the world there are few great men, true and valiant heroes; they cannot endure hard labour, nor long continuance; nor do they investigate the root and essential principle. They occupy themselves only with the visible and tangible in their own person, discoursing of the primal pass, discussing the primal female; they practise trifling methods of emptiness and form, vainly imagining they have attained the Way. Alas! If one be indeed a true hero, he will utterly let go all things; all conditions become empty; he will attend closely to the great matter of his own person; he will seek out a true master, make friends with worthy companions; he will preserve an unchanging thought to the end of life. Then the primal pass he will assuredly know; the primal female he will assuredly behold; nature and life he will finally comprehend. Learners, let this be your diligent endeavour.
