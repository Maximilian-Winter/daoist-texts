# Original Preface to the Chapter on Awakening to the True

Alas! The human body is hard to obtain, and the passage of time is swift and fleeting; the measure of life’s length is inscrutable—how can one escape the retribution of karma? If one does not early examine and awaken oneself, but only complacently awaits the end, then when at the fork of the road one thought errs, one instantly falls into the three evil paths. Then, in the course of dust-laden kalpas, there is no appointed time for deliverance. At such a moment, even regret avails nothing. Therefore the Buddhists, by the study of nature and life, open the gate of expedience, teaching men to cultivate and refine themselves in order to escape birth and death. The Buddhist sect regards vacuity and stillness as its principle; if one attains sudden enlightenment and perfect penetration, one directly transcends to the further shore; but if there remain habitual stains not yet eradicated, one still wanders among the living beings. Lao Tzu holds refining and nourishing as truth; if one attains its crucial point, one at once ascends to the rank of sage; but if the true nature has not been made clear, one remains still detained in illusory form.

Next, the Zhou Yi contains words on exhausting principle, completing nature, and reaching destiny; the sayings of Lu contain the doctrine of “not assuming that one’s own mind is necessarily correct.” This again is Confucius’ utmost reaching to the profound mysteries of nature and destiny. Yet why are his words only general and brief, and not detailed? It is because he desires to order human relations rightly, to promulgate benevolence, righteousness, propriety, and music as active teachings. Hence, as to the Way of non-action, he never clearly speaks thereof. But he embeds the art of destiny in the images of the Yi, and mingles the law of nature with subtle sayings only. As for Zhuangzi, who pursues and exhausts the nature of things to freedom and ease; and Mencius, who nurtures the vast and vigorous spirit, all these strike near the mark.

In the Han and Wei times, Bo Yang drew from the Yi the body of the Yin and Yang meeting and conjoining, and composed the Cantong Qi to elucidate the workings of the Great Elixir. In the Tang, the loyal master of the state began his sayings by expounding Lao and Zhuang, to reveal the beginning and end of the supreme Way. Is this not teaching divided into three, yet the Way returning to one? Alas! In later generations, the yellow and black sects [Taoists and Buddhists], each confining themselves to their own schools, mutually denying correctness, have caused the essentials of the three to be lost in confusion and error, so that they cannot blend and return to a common source! Moreover, nowadays men in the Taoist gate still esteem cultivation of destiny, but know not the method of cultivating destiny. The principles issue forth in two extremes: some are easily encountered but hard to complete; some are hard to encounter but easy to complete. Such as refining the five sprouts of qi, taking the light of the seven luminaries, focusing thoughts and massage, inhaling purity and exhaling turbidity, reciting scriptures and holding mantras, sprinkling water and commanding talismans, knocking teeth to gather the spirit, ceasing conjugal relations and abstaining from food, preserving the spirit and closing the breath, moving the thought between the eyebrows, supplementing the brain and restoring essence, practising the arts of the chamber — and further ingesting and refining metals, stones, and herbs — all these are easily encountered yet hard to complete. The above methods, throughout the path of self-cultivation, are mostly disruptive and destructive. Therefore, though much effort be employed, the sought-for effect is not verified. If one is diligent and resolute, practicing night and day, one may only avoid sickness and prevent its excesses. But if at any time one ceases, former effort is gradually lost. This is to prolong years and months, and necessarily difficult to attain success. To desire to obtain once and forever, to return to infancy and reverse old age, to transform and ascend on high — is it not difficult? This is truly grievous to lament! It seems that the recent practitioners of cultivation, presumptuously attached and unawakened to the subtle and true method, yet complain that the immortals and spirits speak falsely. They do not understand that those who attain the Way do so all by refining the Golden Elixir. Fearing disclosure of the celestial secret, they resort to many false names and terms. Among these is the single method of closing the breath; if one can forget device and breath and thought, it is the same as the two vehicles of sitting meditation. If diligently practiced, one may enter samadhi and emerge in spiritual clarity. But alas! Spirit belongs to Yin, and the dwelling is hard to secure; one cannot avoid frequently using the method of migration. Having not obtained the way of returning mercury and lead, how can one return bone and change Yang, and ascend to Heaven in broad daylight?

To refine the golden liquid and return the elixir is to be easily encountered but difficult to complete; it requires thorough understanding of Yin and Yang, deep penetration of creation, to be able to pursue the two qi along the Yellow Path, to meet the three natures in the original palace, to cluster the five phases, to harmonize the four images, with dragon’s roar and tiger’s cry, the husband singing and the wife responding; the jade cauldron boiling, the golden furnace fervent — then the mysterious pearl is formed in image, and the Great One returns to truth. All this requires but a short time’s labour, with everlasting, boundless delight. As for guarding against danger and care, being cautious in applying withdrawals and additions, nourishing rectitude and maintaining fullness, it depends on retaining the female and embracing the One. Naturally one returns to the Yang life-breath, stripping away Yin and killing form. When the qi is complete, one sheds the body and spirit is transformed, and is inscribed in the register of immortals, receiving the title of Perfected Man. This is the moment when the true man’s work is accomplished and fame secured. Nowadays scholars take lead and mercury as the two qi, point to the viscera as the five phases, divide heart and kidney as Kan and Li, treat liver and lung as dragon and tiger, use spirit and qi as father and mother, hold saliva and fluid as lead and mercury — not understanding sinking and floating, preferring to distinguish host and guest. How is this different from taking another’s wealth as one’s own, or calling a stranger one’s own child? How can they know the subtlety of metal and wood overcoming each other, or the mystery of Yin and Yang’s mutual use? These all are the sun and moon losing their way, lead and mercury in different furnaces — how can they hope to form the return elixir? I, from youth, loved the Way, and studied deeply the scriptures of the three teachings, even to penal laws, calculation, medicine, divination, battle formations, astronomy, geography, arts of good and ill fortune, life and death, all without neglecting to investigate carefully. Yet of the Golden Elixir method, having read through all scripture and songs and treatises, all say: sun soul, moon spirit, Geng tiger, Jia dragon, mercury, cinnabar, white gold, black tin, Li and Kan, male and female, able to form golden liquid and return elixir — but in the end they say nothing of what true lead and true mercury are. Nor do they mention the methods and measure of fire timing and gentle nurturing. Added to this, later mistaken disciples indulge their wild conjectures, wildly annotating the teachings of the ancient sages, making all manner of errors. Not only do they disorder the immortal scriptures, but also mislead later learners.

I, having not met a perfect man, nor found the secret formula, became so restless in body and spirit that my vitality was exhausted. Though I sought everywhere, from sea to mountain, from the wise to the foolish, none could understand the true essence, nor open and illuminate my heart and entrails. Later, in the year Jiyou of the Xining reign, I accompanied Lord Lu of Longtu to Chengdu; with an undiminished long-cherished resolve, at first sincerely and earnestly, I was moved by a Perfected Man, who taught me the secret of the Golden Elixir’s medicines, materials, and fire timing. His words were very concise, his essential points not many; one might say they pointed from the stream to the source, one phrase awakening a hundred, the mists clearing and the sun shining, all dust removed and the mirror bright. Cross-checking with the immortal scriptures, they fit their signs and agreements. He said that among those who seek immortality in the world, nine out of ten err; and those who reach its true essentials, I have not heard of one or two.

Having met the true exposition, how dare I conceal or remain silent? I have exhausted my knowledge to compose, in regulated verse, ninety-nine poems, eighty-one in number, entitled “Chapter on Awakening to the True.” Within are sixteen poems of seven characters and four rhymes, to express the numbers two and eight; sixty-four quatrains arranged according to the trigrams of the Zhou Yi; one poem of five characters to symbolize the marvel of the Great One; and additionally twelve poems of the “West River Moon” rhyme to accord with the year’s rhythm. Matters such as the hierarchy of cauldrons and vessels, weights of medicines, fire timing and advancement and retreat, host and guest, precedence and succession, existence and non-existence, good and ill fortune, regret and shame, are all thoroughly included therein. After the completion of this collection, I perceived that it touched only on the arts of nourishing life and strengthening the form, and had not yet explored the fundamental origin and true awakening of nature. Therefore I studied Buddhist texts and the “Transmission of the Lamp” record; reaching even to the patriarchs who attained awakening by striking bamboo, I composed thirty-two pieces in song, verse, and miscellaneous words, which I now append to the end of the volume, hoping thereby to reach the way of original enlightenment and perfect nature fully.

I hope that comrades who read it will see the end and thereby awaken to the origin, abandoning falsehood to follow the true.
