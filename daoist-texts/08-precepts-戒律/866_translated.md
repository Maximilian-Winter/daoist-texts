The *Record of the Transmission of the Three Caverns’ Sutra Precept Method Brief Explanation* states: “These Ten Supreme Precepts are those received by the common men and women, cutting off ten evil deeds and practising ten good ones.”

Source: *The Scripture of the Origins and Retributions According to the True Treasure of the Supreme Cavern*, scroll four, the sixth chapter on Observance of Precepts.

The Great Compassionate and Merciful Universal Salvation Perfected Person, on account of the origins and retributions of karma, inquired of the Supreme Dao Lord. At that time, the Dao Lord said unto Universal Salvation: ‘Since the beginningless world, I have continually been among men, instructing and preaching the Law, delivering living beings. I cause the past and future, the ten directions, the three realms, men and gods, the mundane and the holy, all to hear and know; equally gathering in the uncaused, entering the Way of the True Constant, neither birth nor death, no departure nor arrival, abiding ever tranquil, wholly permeating the quiet chamber. Those who ascend to this realm must hold to precepts, beginning with the arising of the mind and ending at the utmost fruit. With repentance and taking of precepts, with recitation and strict fasting, by walking the Way with utmost sincerity, by issuing great vows, by praising and giving alms, by nourishing living beings, rescuing all, widely establishing merit; thereby moving the heavens, blessing and producing the divine, gathering causes and producing transformations, according to time and circumstances, realizing the true form and action, transmitting the teaching and flowing with it, widely governing the true responses—thus do they begin to meet the Way. Without ceasing for a moment, extinguishing the mind and forgetting the mind, all must keep the precepts. Those who keep precepts without violation summon the descent of the heavens, the reverence of the many sages, the singing praise of the assembled demons, each following their deeds, and are registered in the Upper Palace. Therefore I, according to their share of power, broadly expound the gates of precepts, of various degrees, differing above and below, that you living beings may accept them according to your opportunities. The three precepts, five precepts, six, seven, eight, nine, ten precepts; the twelve precepts to be followed; the fourteen bodily precepts; twenty-four precepts; twenty-seven precepts; thirty-six precepts; even to the lower grade of the Cavern Mysterious with forty precepts, the middle grade with sixty, the upper grade with eighty; one hundred and eighty; Three Pure Ones’ three hundred bodily precepts; Seven Hundred and Twenty Precepts of the Cavern Spirits—each with its order, guiding and leading the confused multitudes. Whoever can receive and maintain these shall all obtain blessings and endless extinction of sins. They are scattered throughout the scriptures of the Three Caverns, long circulated. Living beings being dark and confused cannot hear of them. Now I will only speak for you the Ten Supreme Precepts, as the welfare and karma of men and gods, and for the good affinity of life and death, transmitting to those to come, causing all to guard and keep them, bestowing blessings and dispelling calamities, inconceivable indeed.’

The Dao Lord said: ‘These Ten Precepts are the city walls and houses of living beings. Those who can keep them have twenty-four attendants on either side — jade boys and jade maidens, vajra kings, generals and strongmen — to guard them, dispel calamities, deliver from distress, and preserve life and prolong years. The true sages reverence them, the heavens rejoice. Weapons of war, fire and water, tigers and wolves, insects and snakes, disease and prisons, ghosts, thieves and evil spirits, hunger, cold, vexations and hardships — all calamities of multitudes shall never harm them. They who seek sons obtain sons; they who seek daughters obtain daughters; wealth, honour, longevity, and joy follow their will. Their wisdom is keen and clear, their form upright and comely, first among men, inconceivable. In past births they dwelt in heavenly palaces and pure lands, in splendid halls and treasured pavilions, with effortless clothing and food, cloud canopies and dragon chariots, free and untroubled. They continually hear the sutras and laws, serve the heavenly Lords, repeatedly receive bodies, and meet the true Way. Those who keep these precepts are like a treasured sword that can sever all; like a dharma boat that can ferry all over; like fierce fire that can burn all; like pure water that can wash all. From the Three Pure Ones down to the ten directions’ highest sages and true immortals, none do not all keep these precepts. The precepts are to guard from sin and stop evil, to bind and restrain body and mind, to subdue demons and spirits, to move the sacred and spiritual.’

The Dao Lord said: ‘In former times there were five hundred men, in the pure and harmonious kingdom, on Empty Clear Mountain, who cultivated the Way for twenty-one years, all keeping these precepts, fully awakening to non-action. I sent the Perfected Person Dasang to deliver them into the Realm of No-Form, and now all have become Golden Light Immortals, further studying the Great Vehicle, gradually ascending the true ranks. Also, in the kingdom of Floating, on Empty Accumulated Mountain, there were thirty-six thousand women united in mind to learn the Way. In a hundred years they had not heard of these sutras and precepts, and were harmed by a great demon spirit, all entering the water of ignorance, wandering and sinking, unable to escape. I sent the Delivering Perfected Person to rescue them, granting them this sutra, causing them gradually to awaken. Transferred to View Mountain, faithfully holding the Ten Precepts, they have now reached six million years, day and night diligently, singlehearted and undivided. Lingzhi and divine herbs, sweet dew and jade pools spontaneously arise there, supplying food and drink. They gradually gain clarity, and will naturally reach the utmost truth.’
