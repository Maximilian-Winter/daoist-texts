# The Precious Edict of the Eleven Luminaries

With utmost sincerity I surrender myself and pay reverent homage. The Five Stars and the Six Luminaries, the Sun, the Moon, and the Emperor Lords, hold sway over Yin and Yang, embracing and unfolding the work of Creation, bringing forth all things. They transform and nurture the people; though the distinctions of high and low are many, the principles of calamity and fortune are one. I surrender myself and pay reverent homage, responding to the remembrance of their compassionate mercy. Above, they may dispel heavenly disasters; below, they may avert poison and harm. The stars and constellations follow their appointed courses; diseases are removed; the altars and lands are at peace; the people enjoy prosperity. Great is their compassion and great their vow; great their holiness and great their mercy. The Emperor of the Sun of the Supreme Clarity, the Moon and Stars, the sovereign lords of the Five Virtues and the Four Luminaries.
