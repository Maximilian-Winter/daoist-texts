### On the Heart
The Heart is the ancestor of myriad laws, the lord of the nine orifices, the root of birth and death, the source of good and evil; it was born together with Heaven and Earth, and is the master of the divine brightness. Some call it the True Lord, because its leadership is united in one body; some call it the True Constant, because it transcends antiquity and modernity and is unbroken; some call it the True Suchness, because it is silent and unmoving. When used, it fills the six voids completely; when abandoned, none know where it is. Its greatness has no outside, for the universe is within it, and it is one with the Great Void. Its smallness has no inside, for it enters the tip of an autumn hair, and cannot be sought by form or image. This is what is called my original heart, the self that existed before empty kalpas. What then is it indeed? Obscure and dark, indistinct and vague, it cannot be known by wisdom nor recognised by cognition; forcibly it is named Dao, forcibly named Spirit, forcibly named Heart; just so. From this view, is it not great? Is it not precious? Yet it revolves through the Three Realms, enters and exits birth and death, but cannot help itself: why so? Because a single thought stirs within, and the six consciousnesses flow without; it does not transcend good but transcends evil. Hence there is the retribution of Heaven and Hell, cause and effect; the six paths revolve and return, without an end date. Is it not grievous? Is it not sorrowful? But the wise man is not so. Hence one fasts and purifies to illuminate his virtue; the one truth is clear and pure, and myriad calamities are destroyed. Laozi said: "Attain utmost emptiness, keep firm stillness; myriad things all arise, I watch their return." The things are manifold; each returns to its root. Returning to the root is stillness; stillness is returning life; returning life is constancy; knowing constancy is brightness. Not knowing constancy is acting in error and is calamitous. That which is called constancy is that which transcends antiquity and modernity and is unbroken. That which is called error is just a single thought newly arising. Zhuangzi said: "When once a thing is made, to desire to return to the root—is it not difficult? In the Book of Changes, this is the way of the great man." Henceforth be careful in speech, moderate in eating and drinking, remove defilements and stop thought, quiet the heart and guard oneness, be empty, tranquil and serene, solitary and inactive, gather the senses and return the hearing, harmonize the light and blend with the dust. If a disease arises, do not continue the medicine. Fear not the arising of thought; only fear being slow to awaken. It is like having a hair—each morning one thinks to straighten it. One has body and heart; why not so? In walking, standing, sitting, and lying, do not allow even a moment's separation. There is a land of no-thingness, the country of Lady Hua Xu; there will I wander.

### On the Opening of the Altar, Words of the Method
Have you not seen a ladder of a thousand feet leaning on a steep mountain? One may ascend it to the summit; yet before it on the land, a wall of but a few feet cannot be scaled. It is not that the ladder fails; it is that the place where it rests is not suitable. A boat laden with thousands of hu rides securely on a great river, and crosses seas and oceans; but cast it into a trickling stream, and a few steps cannot be passed. It is not that the boat cannot do it; it is that the place where it rests is not appropriate. Our family's talismanic registers move Heaven and Earth above, shake mountains and rivers below, command dragons and tigers in brightness, seize ghosts and spirits in darkness; their power can raise decayed bones, cultivation can free from life and death; the great can govern a nation, the small can repel calamities. Yet to gain them is through cultivation; to lose them is through negligence. Therefore the artisan with rule and compass cannot always make a perfect work; the master with model and pattern cannot always make a perfect course. But men's affections and demon hindrances, obstacles of name and profit, offences and crimes daily increase without a moment's rest. The body of life has no parents; who outside the body is kin? Passing the days merely with clothes and food, what use is accumulation? Fame and wealth, holding a candle in the wind; love and affection for wife and child, like crows on the same branch. Grand carriages and fine horses cannot accompany through the long night; beautiful concubines and lovely wives cannot save from the pains of the nine hells. Carved walls and lofty buildings, white jade and gold, are but occasional possessions of the lord, and cannot be long kept. In the vast Three Realms, in the busy Four Life-forms, all pursue the passing wave, and sink forever in the sea of suffering. Do not wait until the emissary of Fengdu arrives with black registers to call your name. When you come to this, to regret is too late. Leave your parents and country, come to the door of the master and craftsman; climb and tread the steps, brave frost and rain, pour out your liver and cleanse your gall, come to behold the supreme true wind; with faith give your name, bow and receive the secret records of the Celestial Master. From now on, daily renew yourself and discard the old. Though your name may be announced in the high firmament, your body remains bound by the world's nets. Former affections and loves gradually sever; henceforth enemies and hatreds, when they meet, do not form bonds. Only thus can you untangle troubles and blunt sharpness, help things and save men, nurture your nature and rest in peace, preserve the spirit and quiet the thoughts. The grasp on lusts being broken, the fire must then cease in the monkey of the heart; false thoughts not arising, within you naturally stops the wild horse of the mind. Know the body is the trouble, see fate as truth; yang does not warm life, yin does not obscure death. From this, the great wind does not move, the kalpa fire is hard to burn; thoughts are extinct in the Three Corpses, nature is not attached to the Five Desires. The Jade Terrace and the Lang Garden are your own home country; the sea of love and mountain of grace belong to others' livelihood. Life is uncertain; white hair is hard to expect; the sun and moon swiftly pass; if you delay further, you will become downcast and wasted. Having arrived at the treasure mountain in this life, do not return empty-handed. Humbly pray the august foundation endure forever, the sage's life extend long, the four barbarians not wage war, and the myriad nations come to pay homage. Impartially transform yourself, then all directions, the Three Realms, the six paths, the Four Life-forms, all sentient beings, will together reach the shore of the Way. Now the Profound Altar is completed, the opening of the path soon at hand; I dare not linger long to study. Humbly entreat you to take care.

### Letter in Reply to the Magistrate of Chizhou
Ma Xiugen came, specially bearing a letter; he reports that he has moved to Chengdu. Although the journey was somewhat laborious, the footing is steady. The talismanic register must yet be sealed by oath; it is necessary to attend personally with the oath tablet to complete the ritual. Hence, by the wind I briefly send my sincere hand; Xiugen departs, respectfully presenting this. On the thirteenth day of the sixth month, your servant looks up to the magistrate.

### Letter in Reply to the Magistrate of Zhendin
Long absent from the ice realm, suddenly I receive your precious letter; glad to hear of your health and ease. I admire the Deputy Prefect of Anfu, who in youth followed the Way, striving to guard Confucian learning, a giant wave on the sea of learning, a distinguished master of letters. I await your great usefulness, to fulfill the hearts of the people; thus I hasten to accept, and look forward to your careful choice. Your servant, the magistrate of Zhendin.

### Letter in Reply to Tang Mingquan
Your servant Mingquan: long have I cherished your reputation, hindered by kinship and profound discussion; I look up to you and often labour in dreams; braving wind and distant clouds of marriage, the meeting of clouds not yet arranged; I am ashamed to send my letter, bearing utmost sincerity, but regard my humble rustic state as unworthy. I only think of you, Mingquan, an exalted immortal of the Jade Palace, a guest of the Jade Terrace, who has cast aside the reins of profit and fame to pursue the pivot of virtue and the Way. Without image you preserve the spirit, probing the profound pearl of the Red River. Tranquil and harmonious, nourishing nature, accord with the Ultimate Truth in Hua Xu. You ought further to rescue the difficult and endangered, guide the ignorant below, fully manifest the virtue of the True Man, and unfold the supreme wind. So may we together seek the realm of Hua Yang, the banner and dragon scales; with comrades who buy banners and rainbows, roam the sky of the Great Ultimate.

### Letter in Reply to Magistrate Lin
The功法 you imparted were to receive the secret words of the Sage Master, and more so to diligent practice. Although not lightly doing deeds in the day, still you gain no loss in body or complexion, prolonging life in the world, and becoming immortal. I offer blessings, I offer blessings. Your servant, the Daoist friend Lin.

### Letter in Reply to Lin Lingsu
The gourd and hat are without feeling; what use is cloud and smoke? At the Golden Gate the red mist wanders, as a journey above Heaven. By the white stone and clear spring is the mountain's ease preserved. Duckweed stems occasionally join in meeting, clouds and mud each find their own leisure. Across rivers and mountains, seasons again change; idle fame rises and sets, wandering ever in time's divergence. Jing holds that the Way is originally natural; spirit is not other than itself. The bright moon courses round the Azure River; its light has no form. White clouds come and go on green mountains; their colour leaves no trace. Early comes the cocoon and the moth departs; the sparrow flies to the water and the clam is born. Changes happen in an instant, cycles influence each other; the course does not depend on form; rise and fall depend on the square and the round. Myriad images bring death and life, spring flowers and autumn falls; one qi mutually consumes and rests, night dew and morning sun dry. The Five Lakes wander on a small boat; the Three Isles soar with the dark crane. To rise high one must go far; to descend low is not difficult; not missing the first opportunity is the way of the accomplished. From Plum Post to the straight Hua letter, happily harmonizing, fitting the record of failure.

### Letter from the Celestial Master to Brother Qing
After the three heavens, the father departs and the son comes. Now in these recorded masters, the elder resigns and the younger receives. As a minor servant wearing the dress, I pray that the Great Ultimate may discern and know, and store blessings in my humble person, truly not to forget the great bestowal. I am without words to express.

### Thanks for the Official Appointment
Time does not wait for man; regretting my receiving Heaven's favour, grace reaches kinsfolk alike, joy pervades the private gate. Ashamed and surprised, my sincerity increases; joy beats upon the heart in fear and awe. I reflect that when young I was given pure light; seven years passed, three decrees issued; the dripping roof was abandoned, clouds and brows of the universe made ready for burning and cultivation; the imperial rites of the Xuanhe era were conferred, to bring success in practice. Soon the drips from the spring and the brothers of my homeland met at Yuyá, reporting to what place. This was indeed a rare encounter, the teaching model without question, the heavy duty of Heaven and kin extended to me. Though the green old customs, truly startled the present. The heart of dog and horse, I must exert fully; the honour of phoenix and luan, how boundless their glory! With sincere incense of the midwife, I pray for the longevity of the hills; I look to Heaven and the Sacred, pressing earnestly to the utmost in my retirement. Humbly I speak.

### Ancient Five-Character Poem
### On the Occasion of a Chance Meeting with Shi Yuangui, Writing of the Seagull and Roc
Soaring but a few zhang, how is it unlike ninety thousand li? The Great Way is vast and nameless, neither this nor that. Alas for Master Yuangui, this saying is brought to its end. One thing from the Great Ultimate, the ambitious man marks high and aims. The roc and the cicada and dove, disputing reason but not the ultimate. Form and transformation do not go beyond the six confines. Flying over the course, why mock near or far? Then one understands the carefree roaming, the distant marsh sending forth the mysterious meaning. After the lecture at the four windows, forgetting words, emptily hidden at the table.

### Visit of the Imperial Secretary
The envoy Xu Zhong came, seeking Li Yin in the headquarters; on the way visited Shangqing Temple, and so took tea and spoke until nightfall, then parted. The bright discourse pleased the ear, truly having rare and lofty thoughts; the theory of transformation, the mountain and river's excellence also increased. On the morrow parted. This was in the fifth year of Xuanhe, roughly as in this writing. The west wind first began to blow, white dew still dripping. One floated on the great river, eastward touring to Raoyang. Truly receiving the ninefold letter, thus visiting the elixir chamber. The mountain air, dragons and tigers bright; the green woods and clouds long. Met me on the way, discussing clear frost and ice. At dusk took candle in hand, seated near the new moon's chill. The jade toad veiled the marriage light; golden breeze fans the heavenly fragrance. The shadow falls like village clouds, splendidly offering rare auspices. The six directions show no different colours, the five peaks share autumn light. Brocade robes banished to the dusty world, riding whales across river bridges. Your promise to uphold the mystery, soaring lightly in the void.

### Tang Mingquan Bringing His Family to the Way
My fine one long void and tranquil, gifted yet unwilling to serve. Chickens and dogs among white clouds, bringing family to wander here. What is treasured already transcends the ordinary, the profound principle can sit and attain. Alas for the enlightened ruler's mandate, not to wrest my will. One transformation of river and sea talents, totally free from dust and earth. Heard of the Jingyang magistrate, uprooting the household from the mundane world. This matter is of refined cultivation; strive hard, son of Tang.

### On the Completion of the Dragon Transformation Pavilion, a Hymn to the Daoist Lord of White and Green City
A chamber free from dust and dirt, gentle wind shakes jade bamboos. The table full only of qin and books, serene and unlike worldly customs. At times holding a brush, carving seals and many records. Sometimes with fellow mystics, playing chess two or three rounds. At night facing the moon through the woods, on the knees playing divine tunes. The deeper the inspiration not yet exhausted, slowly unrolling the scroll. Welcome, good lord of Green City, clouds open and distant mountains green.

### In Reply to Yuangui's Salute
Just arrived at the lofty bank, again climbing the green jade layers. Playing Qing and singing white snow, qin quiet, playing the Huang Zhong. Treading the ancient path of men, pursuing the traces of immortals. From early times much fortune and power, but trust in being scattered and lazy. Where is it not joyful? This heart knows its source. Like a single moon hung on the pine of ten thousand years.

### Thinking of the Green City Elder
After parting from the Green City elder, now many months have passed. The spring heat wanes, mountain flowers quickly fall. At times I climb and admire, westward gazing at the jade pavilion. Could it be a longing for the human world, where pipes and songs are in full joy? Returning to the recluse's company, fulfilling my green rock covenant. The returning light flashes with lingering glow, lotus flowers emerge with golden edges.

### In Reply to Yuangui, Encouragement
Your words contain many references to the ancients. Clearly the Way is here, without acting it comes to fruition. You are now truly arrived, playing music seeking true knowledge. One sentence reveals my son; hard to exhaust in words. Knowing you penetrate Lao and Zhuang, surpassing the daylight to tread the great wilderness. Vivid talk of mystery within mystery, open and boundless without side. Those who learn must have teachers, not contending with demons. Walking the scene as if with knowledge, why be surprised at trickery and strangeness? Doubt and debate dispelled, then faith is a good man. Take good as teacher, the natural seat attained. The world still discusses distinctions; immortal affairs should rely on fate. Having fate, end the cycle; why not die and await completion? The Great Way is not mere appearance, bright above all things. Hearing this I rejoice in spirit and clarity. No more discuss shallow and deep; these words exhaust my sincere heart. The time is scattered and broken; these words are what I esteem. Those listening sneer and jeer, but do not blame kindness and mercy. Fortunately differing from the common folk, thinking among things.

### In Reply to Magistrate Zhang on Food Expenses
No need for rich food; the ancients prized moderation for the belly. When full, what more to seek? Eight delicacies are not desired. The rhinoceros sinew burden not yet lowered, only folding the life pension. Heaven's works assign man measure; some more and some less. Consider those caught on the road, all for lack of food. The old man Zhuang values the dove's food; this poem I read from time to time.

### Again on Clothing
Clothing is valued for suitability: winter furs and summer hemp. The cultivated person does not seek elegance. Light silk and fine cloth, new in style and differing in price. Each bolt costs thousands of coins; clumsy workers cut in disorder. Small things not yet fitting the body, the heart already displeased. Know there are poor ones, winter and summer with cracked skins.

### Song and Ballad
### Song of the Great Way
The Way is not far, it is within the body; things are all empty in nature yet not empty. If nature is not empty, the vital breath abides; breath returns to the primal sea, longevity is endless. To obtain the spirit within the body, do not leave one thing in the spiritual platform. If things are in the body, the spirit is not clear; it wastes and scatters the spirit and harms sinews and bones. The spirit governs the breath, the breath stays with the form; without mixed arts, natural longevity follows. Arts make the Way easy to know but hard to comprehend; once comprehended, one does not practice exclusively. Therefore, among thousands or tens of thousands who learn, none at last have one or two achievements. If the spirit departs, then take it back; when the spirit returns to the body, breath naturally comes back. Thus from morning to evening, naturally the infant is born of the true embryo.

### Song of the Void
The void is vast and boundless without shore; sun and moon east and west bid farewell. East bids farewell to west, when will it end? Life and death's field is like a flash of lightning. Originally the true nature is like the void, bright and clear without darkness or gloom. Occasionally, through a single thought, it falls into form and body, and for another's sake wanders life and death, lost east and west. Alas that the world is wholly unaware; death is grief and life is joy. They do not know that life is the root of death; only delight in the rising sun and fear the setting. The east rises and west sets, the principle is natural; do not let feelings and knowledge entangle. If you do not believe, just watch sun and moon, morning and evening following the heavenly circuit. Life does not come, death does not go; there is no causal relation, it depends where one dwells. The six paths revolve in waves of busy toil; the true man dwells in the void. The true man's abode has no house or hut; neighbours are wind and moon in pure emptiness. Do not say spiritual light is just a particle; it embraces the Dharma realm with nothing missing. The Dharma realm embraces great without outside, secretly entering fine dust without inside. Hunger, cold, and calamity cannot add; all things are heads under the master. A heap of dust for a hundred years' form, like a boat floating on water by human steps. Suddenly one morning the boat breaks and one lands ashore; the dry wood has no master and sinks and topples. Do not rot or look back at myriad waters, thousands of rivers crossed again and again. At the shore burn the boat, no need more talk of waves and suffering green. To dwell in the boat or not, in the end no fear; last night wind and thunder shook mountains. The void does not move, always as it is; truly knowing emptiness, you will not be confused. From ancient times till now, the seal remains; overturning the world reveals the whole body. All sentient beings are saved beyond the sea of suffering; news from true emptiness is not empty foolishness. Transformed endlessly without limit, listen to my song of emptiness and enclosure; an iron serpent flies up Kunlun peak.

### Song of Rest and Ceasing
Rest, rest, rest; cease, cease, cease; rest and cease without distinction. A thousand kinds of subtlety, ten thousand kinds of mystery, all teach men to rest and cease. Having rested, again ceasing; all emotions and desires cut off. Hungry, angry, thirsty, drinking, sleepy; myriad deaths, thousand lives with no entanglement. Ancient sages and wise men, one nature continuous through great kalpas. Brightness shines and unites with true emptiness; beyond rest and cease there is nothing else. Seeds of hell produce grudges; the six consciousnesses burn like fire. Standing I contend with others in ignorance of rest and cease; gladly suffer broken body and tongue pulled out. Rest and cease, the true secret words, no foolishness, no wisdom, no skill or clumsiness. From the true master only blame cultivation; without meeting a kindred spirit, who would reveal it? Rest is not rest, cease is not cease; great use manifests without hesitation. Proclaim founding transformation cutting off the traces of form; encompassing emptiness surpassing arising and perishing. Neither rest nor cease; rest and cease are all forced sayings. If you desire to know true cease and true rest, look to the bright full moon of mid-autumn.

### Composed at Qiantang
Red clouds reflect on the vermilion rail, white clouds hide the green mountains. Men of dust do not reach here; twin cranes dance at Chai Pass. Jade qin play a tune with several poems; mountain boys boil tea with no marriage. Remembering to leave the dusty world for joy, how many years since departing the grotto heaven? On the Xiang River the moon just white, on the Xiang bank the wind is clear. Heartbreaking sounds choke the jade flute broken; sorrow kills how much feeling on the frost embankment? Life is but floating clouds. The immortal family still enjoys spring; return home, rejoice in my truth.

### To Yuan Gui's Ren, a Song
Whatever he does, let him do; do not mind him; he is he, right or wrong, what can I do? Idle all day with friends beyond the world, high chanting and falling brush like a suspended river. No mind in the world binds the mundane burden; in the box is a sword to subdue the dark demons. Long life achieved, the profound meaning understood; let the black and white rabbits run like shuttles. The dust and toil are truly hateful; who is willing to wander and waste time? In quiet places think of noisy affairs; in the end all vainly compete and shout. Whatever he does, let him do; do not mind him; only follow the primal breath to nurture the middle harmony. Sometimes freely reading the alchemical scriptures; idle seeking the Jade Zhen song. My heart is not stone and cannot be moved; let the common talk generate error. Pine hairpin, cloth robe, and self-enjoyment; why be enamoured of the splendid silk and brocade? The divine furnace mates and refines the golden liquid; mingling deep and day by day. When功行 is complete we go together, floating and flying carriage brushes the Milky Way. Whatever he does, let him do; do not mind him.

### Song of the Flute and Bagpipe
Do not say the Great Way is without doing and making; you must understand the flute and bagpipe in the room. Passing time, not moving for a moment; purple mist and red light blaze and flicker. The azure dragon rejoices, the white tiger hates; the red snake coils about the tortoise shell. Even if you pass Tailü Pass, the road is blocked again at Caoxi. Two lines go straight up to the cinnabar field; surely there are the three pure ones' pavilions above. Beneath the pavilions clearly is a jade pool; within is the medicine of long life and immortality. At the right time take, prepare to take; having taken Penglai, enjoy happiness.

### Song of Jing Tong Hermitage
I built a grass hut in the mountain; others mock me as called Jing Tong. All come to the field of the mind, encompassing the world with the void. My hut is not Tong nor Jing; exquisite on eight sides without form or shadow. Full and empty, news and change, according to Heaven's plan; the master of the hut himself is unaware. At times wind and snow in three winter months; all day no human smoke before the mountain. Obstinate black void, day like night; hut's light shines long and complete. At times wind and thunder arise on the plain; mountain sinks, river swells with flowing clouds. Dragon roars, tiger howls, myriad forms noisy; inside the hut desires never cease. Around the hut pine and bamboo reach to blue sky; winter does not wither nor spring flourish. Men come and mock the hut's hardship; bone-deep poverty, bone-deep purity. Clear poverty births perfect principle; recalling the vermilion gate's many starving corpses. If you can recognize your own pearl, would you envy others' treasures for life? The hut is like the body, the master like the heart; to understand the master of the hut you must seek. Donkey's womb, horse's belly, river sands' dreams; who knows iron ore hides precious gold? Keep your eyes sharp and act quickly; now seek the non-existent in existence. Words exhaust principle, cut off false conditions and emptiness; no-maned lion roars shaking the sky. In front of the hut all buildings are humble cottages; how many kindred spirits dwell in the same hut? Were it not for breaking off the cliff-hand, who would understand and recognize him? Sometimes there is joy but none know; in quiet places skill comes in leisure. Natural wondrous use, natural truth; ascended spirits and immortals all come from this. Floating life is short and fleeting; once all huts are broken down, one must cease. I earnestly advise all our disciples: do not lose this hut, cultivate early.

### Song of the Wild Pavilion
The whales and fish of the four seas are not worth fishing; even if hooked, I do not want them. The immortals of the Three Isles are not worth boasting; long life and immortality count as many as hemp seeds. Surprising human fame and reputation are not to be relied on; heroes of ten thousand ages are but a play. Small riches and honours are not to be rejoiced in; what is better than the wild pavilion’s idle clouds? The kalpa fire burns away the tiniest dust; sleeping now, none hear it. Where is the wild pavilion? Vast and boundless with no entrance. Ten thousand immortal maidens dive in the waves; a million struggle with the roc under the land. This one pavilion is truly strange; gods do not know, ghosts cannot fathom it. East to west, south to north; the centre is one orifice, the realm of dust and sand. The dust and sand realm contains fine dust; every fine dust is a true person. Every true person is a true source; their majesty and retinue are numerous likewise. If common people see the wild pavilion old man, at a glance all flee. Ha ha ha, the song of the wild pavilion for a thousand and ten thousand ages.

### Letter to Magistrate Lin
Who does not love the door to long life? Only one must apply oneself. On the Jiugong Terrace yellow buds arise; by the jade pool peaches grow. Stirring the heavenly gate, ghosts and spirits submit; turning the earthly axle, yin demons are defeated. The river cart is moved up to the ninefold heaven; sun and moon refine into the golden world.

### Contemplation of the Ghost Valley Mountain, Thoughts on the True Grotto, Composed to Present to Yuangui
The True Grotto lies deep in clouds and water; Daoists dwell there and ghosts and spirits reverence. Mountain flowers smile under pine and bamboo shade; the rock torrents murmur the sound of a thousand ages. When shall one fashion a pure spirit robe, climbing rock vines to laugh and chant together?

## Sayings of the Thirtieth Celestial Master, Lord Xu Jing, Volume the Fourth
### Five-Character Regulated Verse
### Hymn on Returning to the Mountains at the Request of Yuangui, Near and Far Success Becoming Mountain
Glad to see Shi Hun descend, forget words, the truth alone. Returning to seek the stone bridge covenant, washing away the dust of guests from the capital. Incense and cinnabar furnace quiet; poetry and brush bright and new. Lofty clouds not lonely at Ying; hand in hand at the cave gate in spring.

### In Reply to Hunlun Hermitage’s Transcendence, Immediate Rhymes
Naturally finding the delight of carefree ease, always enjoying quiet dwelling. By the water red rose small, beyond marriage sparse green bamboo. Things truly constant respond; forgetting forms within, original emptiness. Human toil and dust worries, here all are consumed and removed.

### To Yuan Gui and the Taiding Two Lords
By the water singing and playing, under the eaves holding a scroll. Men’s hearts each have their delight; heavenly music how true! Fear the sun newly entering summer; idle flowers still spring. Not following cold and heat changes, only the kalpa’s first life.

### Autumn Evening
On the evening of the beginning of autumn, drinking wine and composing verses, roughly sending off the clear light to invite fine poems. Twinkling autumn light is good; step by step myriad treasures form. Pine tall and crane solitary crying; bamboo dense with one cicada’s call. Great drunk, robe collar wet; empty song, the wind’s bearing is clear. Waist qin should be played more; the Chu marshes have lingering feelings.

### Sending Yuangui to Visit Magu
Flicking sleeves at the Ma source scene, drifting with clear delight. Not refusing a thousand li far; alone walking the five clouds light. Already have qin and books to enjoy; should have no worldly entanglements. I am ashamed to impede pursuit; turning my head, the wild chase sentiment.

### In Reply to Yuangui on the Cloud-Dispelling Pavilion
Sparse green embraces the high pavilion, the void slowly wanting to emit clouds. Two pillars share clear shade; west is the Dragon Transformation Pavilion, hence a fine breeze parts. The frontier laments the seat of qin and books, hard to manage the sparrow flock. The host pities upright integrity; who dares skillfully wield the axe?

### In Reply to Yuangui
Yuangui the Daoist read my “On the Heart,” composed verses and sent; I follow with rhymes to reply. The new writings are learned but not verbose; reciting clears the spirit. The meaning is beyond mundane desires; the heart is the source of myriad laws. Like a dragon who can be measured? Herding horses softly spoken. Thrice repeated the place is hard to exhaust; again I come for finer discussion.

### Listening to Yuangui’s Qin
Myriad things confuse and fill, the whole world’s sound does not flow. Former men took from strings; now I seek within intention. Water strikes rock on the cliff’s edge; wind high on island in autumn. Seeing each other we gain true joy; Heaven and Earth together wander.

### Joy of Clear Weather
Peonies are all fallen; mountain springs have sound. Fully know spring late gone; deeply glad night comes clear. Tall willow brushes eaves now; idle flowers light the hollow bright. Pine asks to bring good wine; today thoughts are pure.

### To Deng Cheng’s Two Sons
Deng Cheng’s two sons transmitted the method to me; after clearing the altar’s affairs, I wrote verses to leave them. Do not close the Three Heavens’ Way; hard to turn back the sons’ sincerity. Exposed passages call for response; tearing silk to joyfully make a pact. The divine sword tested one day; the Dharma lamp bright for a thousand ages. Introspect and comprehend; ultimate truth is truly without feeling.

### Sending Dharma Master Zhengzhi
The Way’s appearance ancient and lofty; fame fragrant for ten thousand li. Purple mist robe ethereal; cinnabar pendant jade bright. Solitary dwelling in rock pavilion; diligently chanting grotto scriptures. Waiting to see功行 full; flying carriage ascends to the clear sun.

### Drying Sutras
Late sun fills the high terrace; book bag of cloud brocade opens. Plum steamed, yang qi penetrates; woods hide, light returns. Cave penetrates myriad gods’ illusions; bright and clear destroys myriad evils. Diligently able to open secrets; depend on rare talents.

### Evening Walk in the Mountains
Crows often come to speak; seeking nest but not found. Small stars brighter and nearer; tall osmanthus just climbed. Brushing dew pine all present; by the wind message not returned. Is there no place for rest? Green reaches the Xie family mountain.

### In Reply to Yuangui Sending to Yangzi, Dwelling at True Rock, in Rhyme
Should reach the highest place; lifting thoughts to ancient men. Wind brings many cypress seeds; buds compete removing dust. The mattress of heat not reached; heavenly flowers freely spring. Immortal traces wanting no mark; common world wandering seeks ferry.

### Next Rhyme to Encourage Yuangui
Leisurely and with amusement, recognize the original man. Pain and suffering are vain; in darkness there is truth. Worry and vexation only self-burden; quiet and broad, then long spring. Do you know my thoughts? My body is not your body.

### Title: Hall of Measurement
Four poems.
Often admire the mid-autumn moon; mountain hall also melancholy. Temporarily dwelling for a hundred days; often feels near the three terraces. The sound of great trees probes the night; cultivated bamboo shades quiet steps. If one cannot measure oneself, how can one see return?

Near the door all are tree tops; originally not formed from grains. Walking in the mountain not everywhere; after rain the view is clearer. Peaches planted toward the horizon; clouds rise from the ridge. No sound of cocks or dogs arrives; sometimes hear the call of luan flute.

Suddenly ascending the hall; like the immortal of the white sun. Lofty and deep near the sage image; surpassing, ashamed of my years. Thin moon with cold dew; tall pine asks the wild field. Palace built but a few years; still causes knocking on the bell money.

Facing the west window place; two peaks green and arranged. White clouds clear pictures enter; black crane when will return? Silent cut like bamboo hair; hoe weeds around the moss on steps. Sometimes not opening the door; marriage rain covers the sun terrace.

### Linked Verse
