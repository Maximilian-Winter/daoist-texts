## Records of the Hall of Joyful Cultivation, Volume One (Section Twenty-Nine)
### I
All men who desire to learn any one thing must first clearly see the principle of the Way, fix their footing firmly, look steadfastly at a single point, grasp it firmly with one hand, and not cease until they have carried it to the utmost. Only thus with such strength can one attain the mastery of one matter. Even if one cannot reach its summit, one will not abandon it halfway, thus being a person of no small account. All things are so, much more the study of life and destiny! When speaking of the Immortals, all men in the world cherish them, but to teach and learn this Way, only one or two out of a hundred gain it. Alas! The dust of the world rolls and rolls, the seas of suffering are vast and boundless; where is joy? Where is beauty? Alas that men discern not, but thereby lose their good conscience; not only unable to transcend the world and enter sainthood, but turning round in birth and death, ever declining, enduring all manner of suffering beyond words. My master therefore mourns for them in their stead. Now again I live fortunate for your sake, having toiled many years with true sincerity throughout life, hence this meeting today. If the spirit be not invigorated, indifferent and listless together, today as ever, tomorrow as before, I fear after the Law’s cessation, when the conditions are fulfilled, regret will be too late. Speaking of Immortals from old, which of them was born so by nature? All arise not from the dawn and dusk, but gradually from little to much, from the slight to the manifest, accumulating until it covers heaven and earth, from antiquity to the present. Hence it is said, "Sakyamuni did not spring from the earth; the Most High was not born from heaven." Even the Most Complete True Lord, none but have undergone trials and insults before cultivating to become the perfectly awakened Tathāgata of pure gold body; much more so for those of middling roots and vessels! Yet say not that age is advanced and time short, fearing to study the Way with no prospect of attainment; better to let nature take its course, to resign to fate’s changes, following whither the will leads, utterly neglecting to gather spirit and arrange mind and strength; such are like horses without reins, apes without cords, bound to run wildly without ceasing. This is to waste former blessings and bring harm to the future—how can this be? I think to lose the human body once is to find it not again in ten thousand kalpas; moreover, born in China, with the brilliance of rites, righteousness, and culture; meeting also the Dharma assembly, hearing the true meaning of Dao, Virtue, and Life—such conditions are rare even among Immortal teachers of past ages. Why so? Because men but apply sincere effort, need not even step outside the door, and have the true transmission spontaneously. Consider ancient Immortals; though attaining the Way today, their spirits dwelling in the Great Luo Heavenly Palace, in those days wandering the nine provinces, they endured manifold sufferings, countless hardships, not to say the wasting of wealth, let alone the deceits of side doors. Only after long accumulation of sincere effort and deep fixation of thought, with steadfast resolve and difficulty in the Way, did the Immortal truly pity their distress, earnestly think of their toil, then by response descend to impart the profound secrets of the Great Way step by step, awaiting full accomplishment before becoming an authentic Cave Immortal. How then is the difficulty or ease of your meeting teachers and hearing the Way compared with former sages? From ancient times many Immortal teachers found the times inauspicious, stars unaligned, in hardship and darkness, helpless, then seeing through the dust of the world, went forth to seek the Way. Such as Master Lü met Zhongli at forty, and at fifty heard the supreme Way; Master Zhang at sixty left home to seek the Way, and at seventy received the Fire Dragon’s transmission. By this view, I fear one who is not wholeheartedly devoted to the Way, what matter if age be old! My Way says: "Men do not fear youthlessness, but fear not having the heart for the Way." Even at ninety or a hundred years, if in accordance with the method to cultivate, whether man or woman, they have power over stars and chariots, the marvel of raising the dead and restoring the living. From old the youngest to learn the Way, besides Manjusri, Buddha, and Avalokiteśvara, are not many heard of. It is not difficult to enter the Way in youth, but youth’s devotion is often wavering, doubting, doubly minded, further relying on time and careless in pursuit, thus many study but few attain. Only those among you of middle or old age, having already experienced the hardships of worldly lust and form, having repeatedly endured the bitterness of fame and gain, not only holding the world’s glory as tasteless as chewing wax, but knowing that all kinds of suffering are hidden therein; thus the heart for the Way arises and the worldly heart dies, the worldly heart hidden and the Way heart manifest; only then can the former cause be understood and the precious life thoroughly penetrated. Though it is said, after bitterness comes sweetness, when one is resolute and undistracted, unknown is the hardship of cultivation; thus one kalpa is made, no need to start anew. Can you truly taste the bitterness of the world? The sweetness of the Way? One side heavier, the other lighter; do not be as youthful ones with worldly ties unsettled, worldly hearts unemptied,功未積，孽障難消，徒思得道而不能成丹也。生等具挺挺志氣，浩浩天衷，自然丹成，指顧云騰足下矣。

### II
The various masters who speak of the Way of Yang birth do not confine it to one aspect; all come from thoughtlessness and without care. For example, chaste women and virtuous wives, wholly devoted without distraction, who upon a single ill meeting would rather abandon life than forsake righteousness. Again, loyal ministers and brave men follow righteousness alone; if calamity arises unexpectedly, they are willing to sacrifice their lives for their country. This is the true Yang birth; otherwise, how could they be unyielding after countless setbacks? By this we may infer: in daily conduct, whether fulfilling filial and friendly duties, or pitying orphans and widows in distress, all acts of goodness and righteousness, done just right and proper, stir feelings of joy and encouragement; these are all signs of Yang birth. Only fear that one may suddenly see it, then be blocked by qi; or fear being aware, then becoming arrogant, boasting in speech, manifesting in countenance, vain and boastful, unaware of self-restraint, treating what is as if it were not, thus scattered by the pull of habitual qi. Or reading and reciting poems, suddenly all selfish desires vanish, a single spirit alone remains; this also is a facet of Yang birth. Or gathering with friends, mutually opening hearts, suddenly Yang qi soars, the true mechanism bursts forth; this too is one path of Yang birth. Furthermore, in qin, chess, calligraphy, painting, fishing, woodcutting, farming, and reading, if one truly follows nature, acts from innate nature, desires nothing, seeks nothing, there is none but leisure and satisfaction, amusement and forgetfulness; these all are signs of Yang birth. The essential thing is that once stirred, one is awakened; once awakened, one withdraws; thus the spirit desires nothing beyond, the qi has surplus beauty, and the elixir is not hard to grow; the embryo and infant need not fear not flourishing. Even if not becoming Immortal, if one can hold firm and not lose, the spirit always returns to the Qian cavity, the qi frequently returns to the furnace; in time true Yang spontaneously arises. Moreover, one must know that where there is Yang there is life, where no Yang there is death. Thus, even if one scarcely has merit, cannot ascend to the Great Luo and participate in the Vast Void, one can yet transcend the world and prolong life, becoming an earthly Immortal or celestial Immortal in the world. If one thus comprehends Yang, then one knows Yang is the Way, the Way is emptiness and naturalness. Zi Si said: "The Way cannot be separated even for a moment"; is this not the teaching of gathering and restraining Yang light, allowing not a single ray to leak? Masters, having profound insight, I therefore show you the omnipresent, eternal true primal Yang, which exists at all times and places; if teaching this to beginners, it would hinder their entrance, even sealing the originally joyous and encouraging nature of form and appearance.

### III
Man lives between heaven and earth; except for the Great Way of the Golden Elixir and the return of cultivation work, all forms and colors of endless glory, wealth, and honor are but means of illusion. The ignorant among mortals take voice, color, goods, and profit as their task, believing that having surplus at home is the result of good deeds accumulated in past lives, now enjoyed greatly. Who knows that excessive enjoyment disperses the spirit, so that in the end one returns empty-handed, and even the true of heaven and earth returns to nothingness? This is what the Most High means when he says, "Heaven and earth and all things steal from me my primal qi." Thus it is known that honors and beauty, even for emperors and generals, if they do not cultivate character and establish life, are but daily consumption, dissipating the true primal essence, to no benefit to the true self. Therefore the rich and noble who labor are not equal to the poor and lowly who follow their aims; this is so. The ancients said: "To live in the world without cultivating Dao and Virtue is like entering a treasure mountain and returning empty-handed." This saying is indeed no falsehood. My master journeyed to Shu Commandery, seeing men not enslaved to wealth and fame, yet rushing after wine, lust, wealth, and anger; my heart is full of pity. Alas! There are those who have the heart to be saved, yet do not know how to return. Not only do they not accept salvation, but they murmur bitter words, calling my Way strange and strange. Ah! Such men, though I have ten parts pity, I can do no more! Masters, reflect: in the present age, are not men's hearts largely thus? Few are they who have the human body in a kalpa. In the blink of an eye time passes and is late; who knows if today's wealth and honor will not be poverty and lowliness in the next life? Who knows if today as man, one will not be born as a beast next time? The ancients said: "Man's body is hard to obtain, China hard to be born in, the Great Way hard to meet." Having received the human body and born in China, hearing the correct Dharma, this is the supreme cause and condition; compared with emperors and generals who suddenly enjoy and suddenly perish, their incarnations unable to endure scattering, is not this condition immensely superior? If one can thus secretly cultivate, even if not becoming Immortal or Saint, rebirth will yet be among those of root; this too is fortunate. Moreover, joining this Dharma assembly, heaven grants special grace, directly permitting one to complete a kalpa of cultivation. Masters, in this good condition, each must strive forward, not fearing difficulty, not shirking hardship, but only resolutely devoted to the field of Dao and Virtue, secretly attentive to the ground of merit and conduct. Are the gods and immortals deaf and blind? Only men are unwilling to apply their hearts; do not blame the gods for not guarding and assisting. Masters, in this age of disorder and dim hearts, mortals think the time hard, while men of the Way think it great fortune. Why so? If conditions were ordinary, not tested by trials, not passing through hardships, would not all just pass by? Who would then turn heart toward the Way and seek the mysterious? Only through this thousand-fold trial and myriad hardships, things not going as wished, people not helping me, do they know that worldly conditions are all toil, and no one thing is good; thus they become indifferent to fame and gain, and secretly devote themselves to me, weary of the world and resolved to pure cultivation. Even if today they do not become Immortals, yet the path to Immortality has passed its stages; if reborn as men, would the gods forsake them and seek others? Therefore the ancients said: "Immortals are still of the seed of Immortals; how can common men become Immortals?" This is it. Again I speak of today's meeting. Today there are no fewer than ten million Taoist cultivators; who can elucidate the true constant wondrous Way and its full application without omission? Only you, who learn from me without a fragment or half point lost to one-sided learning; how is this meeting? It shows the gods’ love for the Way, sparing no effort on your behalf. Since you entered the Way, you have repeatedly encountered trials and storms; watching from outside, the cultivators do not bear heaven’s protection, but suffer many fears. You do not know that each slander is a gain in Dao and Virtue, each trial a growth in spirit; old roots and habits are thereby removed, past grievances and future sins thus eliminated. This is like a man soiled with mud, after washing, his body is fresh and pure; like gold and jade hidden in stone, after smelting, their brilliance emerges. This path of blessing and wisdom is not in comfort and smoothness, but in trial and hardship. Do not let men’s words cause you to falter. I see you are true Immortals, not those dragging mud and water, thinking of Immortals and yet also seeking wealth and fame, with two thoughts mingling in one heart.

### IV
Again I instruct: in the Way of cultivation, do not err in water and fire; water must be clear and fire white, only then is it the water and fire of the primordial heaven. Where is fire? In the heart within, the nature of the heart is fire. Yet nature has two kinds: the qi-nature and the true nature. If the qi-nature is not removed, the true nature is not seen, and one still cannot escape the dealings of things; at times vexed thoughts arise, turning into earthly fire, scorching the body, and the true nature is destroyed thereby. Hence the first task of the alchemist is to concentrate the spirit. To concentrate the spirit is nothing else but to remove the earthly fire, to be purely a ball of fire without thought or care, at ease and free; only then can earthly qi be transformed into true qi. Masters, when you sit in meditation, strive to extinguish every earthly fire, then slowly concentrate the spirit. Thus the spirit is true spirit, fire is true fire; then the spirit has a place. Not knowing its place, wandering without rest, not knowing the method, how to begin? This qi cavity is one place, thus the aperture for return to root and destiny. Within, one opens and closes, following nature; my spirit only governs it, never following its length or shortness, its coming or going; this is the method of concentrating spirit. Concentrate spirit here; breath naturally adjusts; day by day, month by month, the immortal embryo is completed, like a newborn infant receiving father’s essence and mother’s blood, having this single breath of embryo, neither fast nor slow, neither cold nor warm, and after ten months comes forth as a man. And where is water? In the kidney’s essence, essence is water. Yet there are false emotions and true emotions; if these two are not clear, the elixir will not be accomplished. If false emotions are not removed, water will wander excessively, inevitably flowing and becoming lust. The learner wishing to master false emotion cannot do without the primal spirit returning to examine within, inspecting and checking constantly; naturally no lustful or evil thoughts arise, this is true emotion. If there is movement, it burdens the true qi; I at this point gather awareness to return to truth, taking and rising and descending, withdrawing to the central palace earth cauldron, refining once more, then the great medicine is easily obtained, the great elixir must be accomplished. These two, water and fire, are the basis of the human body, the root of becoming Immortal and Sage; do not confuse or misuse, do not fail to distinguish pure from impure. Masters, be diligent, this is the urgent task at present.

### V
I reveal to you the true meaning of clarity of mind and seeing nature. The primordial heart is nature; primordial nature is emptiness and primal qi; in short, one emptiness only. Since birth, the mind has been bound by qi and temperament, obscured by desires and affections; this heart’s non-emptiness has long prevailed. Qi is the servant of the heart, essence the attendant of the spirit, chasing fantasies and dissipating utterly. This is why learners begin with cultivating spirit and regulating breath. If spirit is not concentrated, it disperses; dispersed, wandering thoughts and fantasies arise in turn; how can it be gathered into one place as the commander of alchemical work? Only by concentration is it one; being one, it is emptiness. My heart’s emptiness is the innate nature given by heaven; external emptiness is the emptiness before birth. If breath is not regulated, it escapes; escaping, within the viscera and without the skin, nothing but a mass of restless qi flows. To gather it into one ball as the foundation of life is difficult indeed. Only by regulation is it peaceful; peace is harmony. My body’s harmony is the life received after birth from heaven and earth; the great harmony of one qi is the life suspended before birth between heaven and earth. This is true nature and true destiny, united with heaven, earth, and men, inseparable nature and destiny; it is the spirit and immortal nature made for immortals. You who desire to return destiny to root and reach the realm of divine transformation have no other cultivation but to concentrate spirit to quietness, regulate breath to evenness, not forgetting nor aiding, neither hastening nor retarding, so that heart, spirit, and breath all enter into utmost emptiness, stillness, and sincerity. But this is not fabricated emptiness, but natural emptiness. Hence heaven, earth, ghosts, spirits, and men share one source. Yet it is not emptiness without reality. Only when my spirit is empty, the pure and harmonious qi of heaven and earth naturally responds. Man’s participation in heaven and earth, assisting creation and transformation, boundless and inscrutable, is because the emptiness of spirit and breath is moved by the clear and void qi entering. This emptiness is where reality lies. Long gathered, naturally the body and mind, within and without, are robust, balanced, pure and refined in essence. Thus seeing nature is truly the arising of true nature. How is the mind clear? Only emptiness is spiritual, spiritual is clear, clear is the presence of all principles, all matters encompassed. When unmoved, it is vast and boundless, without consciousness or knowledge; what is called no inner thoughts arising, no outer thoughts entering, only feeling brightness penetrating all, one principle containing all, all phenomena included; this is attained. When touching things it moves, responsive and communicative, encountering roundness it is round, following square it is square, lively and unrestrained, like a dragon in flight, inscrutable. It is said: "Stillness is the primal spirit, movement is the true intention." Spirit and intention are one, differing only in movement and stillness. It is also said: "The mind has no nature and no master; nature has no mind and no dependence." The mind carries nature; nature governs mind. Thus the brightness, greatness, and boundlessness of mind and its wonders are the measure of nature. To know this true mind is to know nature. But this nature is not yet in the human body; revolving in clear void as primal qi, once it descends into the body it becomes primal spirit; all are empty yet existent. Learners at the start must let this mind be lively and active, entrust it to the silent heaven, roam the surface of the vast void, then can internally subdue the body’s lead and mercury, and externally steal the primal Yang of heaven and earth. In time spirit concentrates and breath regulates; only feeling a point of spirit and breath in the elixir field, flowing vast and wide, seeming and seeming not. I guard and observe this as a cat watches a mouse, a rabbit encounters a hawk, one mind intent, not permitting external wandering; naturally inner response and outer accord are felt, sensing the primal qi of heaven and earth flowing within and without the body without rest. When nature’s work reaches this, cultivation of destiny becomes easy. The mountain spirits and water monsters of the world can transform into human form, their cultivation said to be supreme, but going out to see and play, seeing what is desirable they covet, what is fearful they dread, even doing unkind, unrighteous, shameless acts, and so are destroyed without escape; all due to too little cultivation of nature. My master teaches that to first clarify mind and see nature is foremost; do you understand this?

### VI
The two words "cultivate the heart" encompass all true methods of thousands of sages. Beyond this all else is not the Great Way. You must know that the seed of birth and death and the cycle of rebirth all arise from the failure of a single thought to hold itself, from false emotions and illusions that produce all manner of strange and monstrous things. Hence the ancients’ work always first securely bridled the mind-horse, tightly locked the monkey of the heart. Why? Because the stirring of one thought is the gate of birth and death; the ceasing of one thought is the place of Nirvana. Thus the completion of the Way is not in multiplicity, but in holding one thought firmly, so that in the midst of confusion and carelessness, without thought or care, one may be established. Though sometimes thoughts arise and the heart moves, it is due to external causes, not from spontaneous movement. Such movement of heart, heart without its own heart, though responding to myriad affairs, is the true heart. Otherwise, heart with its own heart, though sitting quietly in stillness, is also false heart. Such attainment by learners is not easy. The key is not to lose hold of the one thought, reaching to complete freedom and ease, clear and self-aware, the divine power manifesting creation, virtue matching heaven and earth. Only fear that the mysterious gate is stirred and the heart is careless. If always holding and preserving, never neglecting, facing demons without retreat, enduring insult without complaint, with one heart and one virtue nourishing this subtle and wondrous body long, naturally day by day filling and month by month flourishing, the mysterious gate will manifest. The mysterious gate is a single aperture, our alchemical pill’s head, not to be sought only in great stillness or great calm. Confucius said: "When I desire benevolence, benevolence is attained." If it must await great stillness and calm to come, Confucius would not have pointed so easily. Thus learners in cultivation, when suddenly still and settled, without knowledge or feeling, suddenly the arising of awareness, no thought before, no remembrance after, clean and pure, is the original face of the primal qi of Qian. From this one thought cultivate, gather and refine, seal and nurture, and in time become an unfathomable Immortal. Even small stillness shows the coming and going of heaven’s heart. If one’s affairs are hurried, thoughts manifold, things vexing like vines around a tree, rising ever more tangled and confused without rest, what to do? Only by one thought turning light, one heart clear reflection, like a drunken man lost asleep by the roadside suddenly splashed with a bowl of cold water, awakening with a start, realizing the haze and confusion was a vain dream—this is the mysterious gate. Long ago the Southern Pole Immortal showed to Crane Thin Boy that the true primal heart essence truly comes from the mysterious gate; movement and stillness are always present, but without sense of movement, there is no perception. Suppose one calls a child’s name, the child must respond "Here." This response, though from the mouth, is governed by the true primal heart essence. In that instant of response, the true primal heart essence is raised from emptiness and shown to men, truly good at pointing. Thus when perception does not arise, all surroundings vanish; upon calling and response, the true primal manifests; thus one knows this heart is not extinguished with surroundings. When perception arises, all surroundings arise; upon each call and response, the true primal is revealed; thus one knows this heart is not born or extinguished with surroundings. Therefore when perception does not arise, the heart is naturally at ease; when perception arises, the heart is also at ease; because it is emptiness and spiritual, what change can be in it? Only fear the entanglements of false thoughts and affections, clinging and bondage, not seeing emptiness, uncut and unsevered; then no foundation for the Way is possible. In sum, this aperture is but the moment of breath; before it is not, after it is not. Like one at the moment of closing to silence, suddenly called by name, responding abruptly, this is the mysterious gate. After response, yin and yang are distinguished as two forms, yet this is not the mysterious gate. The mysterious gate is when the Great Ultimate is about to divide, the Two Forms about to be distinguished; movement is not, stillness is not, it is between extreme stillness and extreme movement. The so-called movement and stillness have no beginning, the mysterious gate has no beginning; the learner must understand well.

### VII
The recent methods taught are all supreme methods. The student must carefully observe within stillness to truly understand; otherwise, one merely turns pages without great flavour. Know that every word I speak comes from the heart, with not one phrase deceiving you. At the start of work, the spirit roams the vast void, penetrating the original aperture; then by emptiness meeting emptiness, the heart is clear and nature revealed, present at all times, without waiting for true Yang to arise. Alas! Men know only to nourish emptiness, not to remove the false emptiness. They know that the heart wanders to desire is not emptiness, not knowing that to cut off desire is also non-emptiness. Desire wears out the spirit; cutting off desire wears out the heart. Though different, their obstruction to the heart is the same. Why call it emptiness yet say Yang is born? Because to say emptiness fears men fall into one-sidedness; to say Yang shows men that in emptiness is reality, containing perfect clarity, penetration, and infinite divine power. Only when emptiness is extreme does Yang arise from it. I take the true intention to gather it, refine it, bathe and nurture it, just as heaven and earth first opened, smoke and clouds obscuring, when true Yang arrives, a warm springtime appears; all is but one ball of great harmony, brewing and fermenting, all else turning to nothing. Some things having turned, others yet born. Reality is emptiness, emptiness is reality; all are the natural creation of one Yang qi without intention. The Sutra of Fixed Light says: "The proof of attainment is that old ailments vanish, body and mind are refreshed, steps quicken, and the countenance shines," all transformations born of one Yang. I wish students to have a heart firm and enduring, not ceasing until carried to the utmost. In daily work one must also recognise the subtlety of the word emptiness to make progress. Only when power is gained here is it true power, true and useful. All other honors and displays are but spring flowers before the eyes, floating clouds obscuring the sky, without meaning. Without this supreme joy there is none who does not incline to the field of gain and loss. When learners reach this, no effort is wasted. Again I show you the Way to cultivate the heart. Man’s heart is originally empty, spiritual, and penetrating; only that because of the words "heart" and "mind," it is unclear and confused, not empty and obstructed. If one can maintain sincerity to establish its foundation, respond to conditions to meet occasions, as Chengzi said: "The heart pervades all things without heart; feelings follow all things without feeling," this is it. If you can thus, then in every moment all affairs respond like stillness in the mountains. If not, then closing the door and sitting still is like a bustling camp of ten thousand horses. Hence Zhuangzi said: "If the heart is not governed, the heart cannot be correct; if forced to govern, the heart also cannot be correct." Only by preserving the heart and not letting it run wild, broadening the heart and not letting it forget, thus movement and stillness are one, hidden and manifest without distinction. Is this easy to obtain? You must carefully observe the mysterious gate aperture, constantly gathering it without losing the proper time, advancing and retreating the fire talisman, not violating its rule, bathing and sealing, not erring in measure; then spirit and qi unite as one, the true mechanism always before you, naturally and spontaneously, letting external conditions gather, this heart merges with the Great Void, unmoved by all.

### VIII
When I say the mysterious gate aperture, it is one of the things void yet spiritual, able to master life and death, escape the cycle of rebirth, becoming the immortal body lasting millions of years. From this comprehension, make it utterly pure and bright as jade, not allowing the slightest dust or speck to stain and spoil it; this is the Immortal’s way. If there be the least impurity, it is not freedom and non-action, not carefree and joyful immortals. From this one thought, not only wine, lust, wealth, and anger, and all riches and pride, but not the slightest stain is allowed; even when功满人寰 and德周沙界, one must empty all, establish fame and withdraw, accomplish功而不居, only then is "spiritual light shining alone, far removed from root and dust" attained. That which is originally without form or shadow, intangible, neither colour nor emptiness, hard to conceive, only nourished by empty and void qi, governed by empty and void spirit, this void uniting with void, then the great elixir can be accomplished. Other things, such as talent and intelligence, all arts and skills, miraculous and endlessly changing, are all external things that cannot resist life and death, cannot overcome the cycle; not only unrelated to me, but the heart is attached to these things, spirit drawn within them, which becomes the seed of harm and obstruction to my path. Even establishing功,德, and言,功参造化,德并乾坤, only counts as a drop of仁心慈悲to save the world and be a parent to the people; if one wishes to excel and become Immortal, this is insufficient. Because德 is external, not related to one’s own cultivation, full nature and established destiny, not a model for later generations. You have heard this formula, which is also the rarest condition in the world. Confucius said: "To hear the Way in the morning, to die in the evening is sufficient." To have heard the Way is a great fortune, a great joy indeed. Moreover, you having heard the formula, my master has given it with ten parts care and ten parts correction, so its attainment of truth and saintship is assured. In sum, this formula is heaven-given; only when the person’s功德 is added, heart and nature unchanged, facing demons not retreating, bearing slanders not refusing, abiding in hardship, with heart ever in the Way, is the formula permitted to be transmitted, so as to hear the correct Dharma eye treasury. Otherwise, going and stopping at will, self-will applying, let alone gods and heaven disallowing, or my master not transmitting, even if transmitted with closeness, sometimes demons and ghosts block the heart and spirit. Hence the ancients said: "This Way is supreme and wondrous, but I worry that your portion is small and hard to remove," showing that to bear this formula is the lot of those with道德and Immortal roots. You having heard this formula, do not think it easy; it comes from over ten years of toil, trials of hardships without excuse, only then is it heard, and used as the vessel of the Way, in days to come to be accomplished, then I speak. You must think of ten plus years of day and night tied to this Way; today fortunate to hear the correct Dharma, if you do not work and do not advance, not only can you not answer me, but ask your heart, what is your mind? To have the mountain nine ren high, and fail on the last basketful, is it not lamentable? From this day onward work, in no more than a hundred days you can lay foundation; then my destiny is mine, not of gods or heaven. Otherwise, hard it is. For example, Yin Zhi may prolong life, yet its master is heaven, not sure by me. More so, since ancient gods and sages have not escaped death, even by fate and qi is hard to defy, how much less ordinary men! You having heard this formula, great is your blessing; hasten to build the foundation, longevity assured.

### IX
The reason the Vast Void is born and reborn without ceasing, to billions of years without destruction, is not that it is truly empty without reality; within it is the most sincere spirit governing, with circulating qi operating outside; yet Vast Void is confused and undistinguished, at first unaware of spirit or qi, not knowing emptiness, but simply following its qi’s transformation, flowing, fullness and depletion, growth and decline, moving with time. Hence it is said: "Since substance is not twofold, its living things are unpredictable." What is substance? The boundless and limitless Great Ultimate, which itself has no limit. Only because of this does creation and transformation become unpredictable, change infinite, long-lasting without boundary. It is said: One Vast Void, vast and wide, round and round, inseparable in division and union; the still and unmoving spirit, with perception and communication wondrous; at the moment of perception and communication, dwelling the still unmoving spirit. Therefore without substance and perception, awareness is not extinguished; with substance and perception, awareness is not born. Because birth and death are in substance, Vast Void has neither birth nor death. If Vast Void had birth and death, then would it have times of interruption. Moreover, Vast Void is empty, without sound or smell, whence then birth or death? Man is also born of Vast Void, why alone have birth and death, and cannot ascend to Vast Void? Because at first birth, its governing spirit and circulating qi are originally confused and vast, unknown and unknowing, like an infant growing daily. When grown to adulthood, knowledge opens, selfish desires arise, and with worldly desires, feelings and falsehood, coming and going, friends following thought, so the emptiness of the human heart is filled with worldly desires, unlike Vast Void’s emptiness. Man desires to become the undying spirit like Vast Void, without beginning and end; can he not empty his heart, calm his spirit, yet still rely on the flowing qi of blood and breath? I previously said the mysterious gate aperture is indeed spirit and qi united, entering the land of nothingness and the realm of pure emptiness and brightness. At this time heart is empty as water, thought cold as ice, spirit still as a mountain, qi flowing as a spring, yet unaware. Only because unaware of spirit, unaware of qi, unaware of emptiness, it is like Vast Void’s emptiness. When skill reaches this, movement and stillness are the same as creation, breathing is the movement of qi, all owing to my body’s true Yin and true Yang united as one qi, thus with heaven and earth’s spirit Yang qi one out and one in, coming and going without cease, mingling and forming one group, empty yet not possessing, real yet not attached. If dulled and confused, how can it be responsive and communicating so wonderfully? Masters must concentrate spirit within qi, qi containing spirit without; the two mingled without distinction, suddenly confused and dark, entering the far obscure place. This is true emptiness and true spirit united, like a man calling and the valley echoing, the wind sounding and the cavity responding, the principle of nature. This is the stillness uniting with the earth’s body, movement uniting with heaven’s course. When calling, my qi connects with heaven’s qi; when inhaling, heaven’s qi enters my qi. Achieving perfect harmony, heaven and earth positioned, all things nurtured; can there be other marvels? It is also sought in oneself only.

### X
You ask about advancing fire and gathering medicine; in the postnatal these are two matters, not one. Now I explain carefully. Advancing fire means concentrating spirit single-mindedly without division. Gathering medicine means using external breath qi, inhaling and exhaling, ascending and descending, following nature. When Yang moves and medicine is born, then within the spirit is concentrated wholly in the elixir cauldron; this is advancing fire. Using the external breath’s rising and falling to encompass it is gathering medicine. Advancing fire is advancing fire; gathering medicine is gathering medicine; do not confuse the two. If only external breath is used in rising and falling without spirit concentrated in the cauldron, though true mechanisms burst forth, the spirit will disperse through the body without resting place. If only Yang qi bursts forth with spirit concentration, but without external breath to encompass it, then medicine qi stops there, only strengthening the lower origin, raising kidney qi. If you do not understand, I explain again: advancing fire is like a smith’s furnace with added wood and coal; gathering medicine is like the smith’s bellows blowing. If only the bellows blow with no wood or coal, the fire is weak and metal will not melt. If only fire is added with no bellows blowing, though wood and coal are present, it only warms the furnace; how can one expect to refine useful metal? Think on this: fire is fire, medicine is medicine, advancing is advancing, gathering is gathering; postnatal method is so. Others gather great medicine in non-action, conduct fire seasons in stillness; here fire and medicine combine, advancing and gathering one and the same. Your work now is not yet at this stage. Later when Yang is born, you must discern the place of return to truth; then you have the reality of activity and non-activity, doing and not doing. I teach you the method of counting breaths to gather and restrain heart and will; in times of no Yang, this method guards your heart from wandering. When Yang is born and medicine arises, you must gather it into the furnace, nurture spirit fire warmly; especially using fire without fire, medicine without medicine, to suit the vapor and primal qi of heaven and earth, so that there may be endless birth and transformation. At the first movement of one Yang, use the method of restraint; this is your near-time work, nothing beyond gathering internal spirit without dispersion, external breath regulating nature. When sitting in meditation you feel restless qi rushing and anxiety; this is not tightness of will, but your own body’s Yin qi stuck and sluggish; the method is to use breath’s earthly fire and true man’s primal fire to nurture it, so it transforms itself. What is true man’s primal fire? The ancients said: "Ears, eyes, and mouth are the Three Treasures; close and do not release communication. The true man dwells in the deep abyss, roaming guarding the rule." This is true man’s primal fire, used yet not used, unused yet used. You must recognize on your body and mind the proper place; when practice reaches the utmost, there will be no such restlessness. Otherwise if Yang qi is great, when moving the River Chariot, there will be such qi rushing, yet spirit and qi remain calm, heart no other. If heart is at ease and qi harmonious, then use the River Chariot, perform the Small Circulation method; then self-judgment and measure is possible.

Man in heaven and earth, without cultivating his own nature and life, will at last be formed by yin and yang, moulded by heaven and earth. Not to speak of rotating heaven and earth and returning creation, one is powerless; even this single body and heart is restrained by ghosts and spirits, unable to be free and easy. Man receives the qi of heaven and earth, spirit of all things; a noble seven-foot frame, yet cannot act as master, ever moved by qi’s transformation; is this not a great grief? Therefore I loudly call, awaken this man’s dream of dreams, so he cultivates nature and life, uniquely opens heaven beyond heaven, not suffering the pain of suffering; is this not joy? Yet the world’s Way daily declines, the human heart daily sinks; each content with dirt’s filth, taking pain for joy, death for life, unwilling to break the city of sorrow, leap out of the sea of sin; wherever present, truly worrisome. More still, with my words of exhortation and awakening intended to rescue the world, some slander and deceive the people. Ah! Truly foolish. Heaven and earth from antiquity to now, only this body, mind, nature, and life maintained by principle and qi; yet so many lost and not awakened — truly lamentable! Recently you employ work in cultivation; first regulate external breathing evenly, neither too much nor too little, letting it enter the mysterious and exit the female, naturally and freely; open when open, close when closed, coarse or fine, with slight gathering and harmonizing intentions sufficient. Do not let qi be coarse and press to fineness, nor let qi float and press to restraint, causing earthly fire to burn the body’s essence and blood. You must seriously consider this fire, gentle or strong, bathing or nurturing; though fires differ, all must be primordial divine fire, absolutely no use of postnatal earthly breath in one out and one in, cycling and repeating, to make the elixir. Hence it is said: "Regulate breath, regulate true breath; refine spirit, refine not-spirit." Breath without breath is true breath; spirit without spirit is highest spirit. When learners regulate breath and concentrate spirit, strive to find true breath and recognize true spirit, then can they be united as one. Otherwise, breath with form is earthly fire. True fire generates spirit; earthly fire harms the body. True spirit can be master; earthly spirit disturbs and unsettles. What is true breath? It is the gentle, revolving breath in the elixir field. What is true spirit? It is the sudden awareness arising in thoughtlessness; this is true spirit. The cultivator desires to gather primal qi to transform earthly essence, to raise true lead to master Yin mercury, to return to the nature of Qian, thus becoming the unthinking primal spirit, not gathering primordial breath without true breath. The primordial breath in the elixir field is faint, neither hot nor cold, like a kindling fire; no flame visible outside, no fire known within, only gentle warmth permeating the embrace; this formless divine fire can transform infinitely, marvelously unfathomable. Otherwise, visible fire is fierce and blazing, rising and falling abruptly, harming body, mind, nature, and life beyond words. The cultivator uses formless true fire; the visible external breath fire is not wholly unused, but like the smith’s bellows blowing outside, surrounding to protect the central divine breath only. I fear masters do not understand the Way of fire; therefore they mention visible earthly fire and invisible primordial true fire together, to prevent mistaken gathering and refining. Yet external breath fire and the lively spiritual fire in the elixir field are not necessarily two things; like candlelight fire, all are shaped postnatal fire; breath outside the elixir field is the external breath. Before the candle is lit, there is fire in the oil; this is the primordial divine fire, unignited. Gathering this divine fire can last ten thousand years without extinction. Gathering earthly fire perishes in a moment. This shows its subtlety. I wish masters in leisure to sit in meditation, using this visible fire to dispel wind, cold, heat, and damp from the body, then use the invisible fire to refine the body’s residue and gloom, then the Golden Elixir can be accomplished.

### XII
Masters recently nurturing stillness do so only to seek the true body from the coloured form. The first is to effect one seeing and one growth in spirit. The Dharma body nurtured long in time becomes sufficient to reveal the great brightness and vastness of heaven. When the true mechanism first arrives, if one immediately lies down, true qi is not full, true spirit not strong; how can clouds and mist be dispelled and the blue sky be seen alone? Henceforth, if not sitting, then no; when sitting, one must gather true spirit and true qi fully and completely; naturally the true mechanism is embraced, needing no guarding, effortless and free. The saying goes: "Long sitting surely brings Chan," truly no falsehood. Master Sanfeng said: "In sitting, remove desires, preserve principle; let one spear fall from horse, lest another strike." Such words are known only by those who have passed through. My master teaches you meditation; at first thoughts and actions arise, but in the end great stillness and great calm. Thus sitting may last three or five days without dispersal; otherwise sudden gain and sudden loss, sitting a thousand times, what benefit? I hope you patiently sit long, not rising with a vexed mind, so as to deeply advance in the Way. This is the urgent task now, not as when first entering the gate, only seeking the true mechanism. Yet men are unwilling to patiently lie down; the cause is twofold. One, before sitting, they have not thought through how to arrange and entrust the matters of the day to others; so when lying down, the heart is drawn by dust and feelings, unable to finish. Not only unable to finish, but a part of true mechanism is often carried off by thought and consciousness. When you first sit, must think through all matters, arrange properly, so one heart and one virtue are not disturbed. Second, knowing how to rise but not how to descend, how to advance but not to retreat, how to preserve but not to lose, how to gain but not to lose; so true qi rushes to the Mud Pellet, spirit hence escapes outward, not knowing to bow head and look down, gather spirit’s light in the cauldron; thus busy again and again, hurried again and again, not yet freely and spontaneously, but eager to lie down. Yet the Way is originally nothing, cultivation is originally non-action. Suddenly seeing true qi rushing, primal spirit leaping, not knowing this qi mechanism as natural movement, unrelated to original substance, but clinging tightly to this movement; always holding without release; thus stirring postnatal earthly breath unsettled, disturbing primordial spirit without master; so sitting is not yet fully satisfying, yet eager to lie down. Before lying down, one feels the body’s affairs busy as fire pursuing destruction, unable to delay; after lying down, no urgent matters; this is because consciousness governs and primal spirit cannot sit in command. I advise you to discard all unimportant matters; first encourage and urge yourself; see dust feelings as false writings, unworthy to linger on; only the primordial Great Way is my lifelong reliance, born with me, dying with me; truly not allowing one moment’s relaxation. Moreover, the sun and mulberry sunset are late, time and moon are few; if again procrastinating, how can regret suffice? Taking advantage of this Dharma assembly grandly opened, with heart transmission from self, dare not neglect the ancestral whip, every moment precious. Thus seeing through, without attachment or worry, at peace, sit down, seek the mysterious at the water palace, raise and lift Yang qi, gathering all spirit light of eyes, ears, mouth, nose at the center, allowing not a single thread of inward or outward flow, accumulating long and then spontaneously shining forth. Most of all know there is originally nothing; at this point arising restlessness is qi mechanism venting outward; my Way values gathering not venting; here especially must guard against leisure and not allow postnatal consciousness to disturb and move; then can one sit peacefully. Remember well, remember well.

### XIII
Those now called masters of the Way all remember words of sages and scriptures of ancient saints, then speak loftily of nature and life, pushing Confucian rationalism, yet ask what is the state and form of nature and life in body and mind; none but gape and cannot speak. Moreover, without basic learning, foundation is wanting; in the end books are books, men are men; what is said is but spittle, no subtle meaning or great truth enters body or mind; though speaking broadly and widely, like learned Confucians, applying it to daily affairs, not a single point accords with human intention; this rootless learning is not worth mentioning. My master earnestly hopes you to transmit my Way. As for cultivating life, though not equal in rank, the main point is but a pair of eyes. Though spirit and qi operate the body, not like the light of two eyes, bright and clear, alert and enduring. Therefore ancient men said: "The whole body is yin, only the eye’s light belongs to Yang." Constantly gather and restrain, slightly look downward, then essence, qi, and spirit will naturally unite as one. When elixir field qi is strong, rising to the Mud Pellet, pervading the nine palaces, pouring into the Yellow Court, the yin qi naturally disappears, and Yang qi remains eternal; like the Vast Void illuminated by the sun, clouds and mist disappear without trace. Masters, recently working, do not focus only on the lower field. Though the lower field qi is strong, it can rise to the Mud Pellet, melting dross in the upper field; but if spirit and qi are still weak, not yet bright and clear, one must long attend carefully; it is no harm to issue true heart and true intention, return gaze to the upper field; then Mud Pellet yin qi is dissolved by Yang qi’s light, and head and eyes will not be dizzy. Hence ancient men called "circular light above the head" this. Also in painting, sculpting a clay or wooden god image, one must paint a circle of light above it; this spirit light is it. The so-called "fine rays illuminate the world, open hell" is the light of the primary spirit. If only guarding the lower field, spirit light cannot immediately arrange itself, inevitably becoming dull and scattered. The dullness and scattering is because true Yang does not rise, true Yin does not descend. Now to ascend and descend suitably, neither too fast nor too slow. Like in midnight Yang suddenly rising, this is a bitter cold winter; suddenly Yang qi arises deep underground; if one does not know to gather spirit and qi, in an instant one falls asleep again. At such time, arise and cultivate by my former method, especially knowing to use some intention to gather spirit and qi to the top, so that the sky is clear and earth bright; in a moment the three Yang open, joy beyond measure. Not only this, on ordinary days guarding the center, if spirit and qi sink to the sea bottom, head and eyes dizzy, it is also no harm to gather and raise them. The mysterious work has no other marvel but in ascending and descending, going and returning, regulating and measuring. Also not teaching you to scatter spirit and qi outward without gathering. If spirit and qi do not circulate in the whole body, then the body’s Yin qi does not transform, becoming only a lump of dead flesh, ultimately useless, and day by day disease entangles. Hence my teaching of cultivating life is to cause water and fire to move through the body, transforming the flesh and blood frame into living and lively, used as needed without hindrance, until the whole body’s hair pores are clear, and skin delicate. Also do not covet spirit and qi circulating throughout the body for soft pleasure, wandering and forgetting return; must gather it back to the palace, forbidding leakage outward; but do not cling tightly to one acupoint, thinking it the Yellow Court. Know that gathering to its utmost is none other than merging with the Great Void, utterly unaware of location; moving at times is like lightning, one movement is felt, one feeling ceases; no origin before, no destination after, still a dim lightscape, returning to boundlessness. When work reaches this, there is a body outside the body. If not thus, only spiritual appearance of form is present, not to be called Immortal. I rejoice that from youth to old age you all know to accumulate功and行from daily affairs, but formerly self-examination and nurturing were somewhat lax and careless; now this work is deep, my master specially comes to instruct, from lower beginnings to seek out the highest wonderful truth, thus nearly attaining the Way.

### XIV
You having heard my Way’s truth, must diligently exhort and awaken, so this heart is always present, this nature always preserved; thereby cultivate deeply, practice thoroughly, almost to the state of naturalness and spontaneity; then none will be lacking to be human, and always able to face heaven; only thus is the sign of a true man accomplishing功 and establishing Dao. Otherwise, one thought not held, then falls and declines unknowingly into the six paths and three realms, desiring to escape the sea of suffering but overwhelmed by the waves; this is difficult indeed. I show you, to seek long life in the body, one cannot do without preserving essence and abundant qi, building a firm foundation, then can one obtain earthly life span; to seek the Dharma body vast and remote, one cannot do without refining spirit to return to emptiness, refining emptiness to unite with the Way, then can one prove the fruit of spirit and Immortal. Both cannot be lacking. If unable to understand the Way, one must strengthen the body to clarify the Way. Having clarified the Way, one must refine the Dharma body to bear the Way. Recently I do not demand refining emptiness and uniting with the Way, but only the study of preserving essence and abundant qi; if one can long accumulate, then Dharma body can naturally be formed. At the beginning I always teach accumulation of功 and行, not meaning功 comes by itself and Dao comes by itself, but功and行 broadly accumulated, yin and qi much cultivated, all to preserve innate good nature, benevolence, original face, not allowing the slightest dust or impurity to mix within, so that all杂念and selfishness are dissolved and clean, and the one pure breath always resides in me. Otherwise杂妄not removed, even if becoming Immortal, is but a stubborn Immortal, unable to enter the Great Luo Heavenly Palace, unable to ascend the Palace of Leisure. Confucius said: "Cultivate the body through the Way; cultivate the Way through benevolence." Zi Si said: "If virtue is not perfected, the Way is not solid." Thus knowing that men have a portion of virtue, have a portion of Way; have ten portions of virtue, have ten portions of Way. Without virtue, the Way cannot solidify. The Way refiner is but refining this benevolence. As for wealth and goods, truly external things, not at all benefiting innate nature. Yet in present world, because of the body, wealth cannot be without; but wealth ruins the heart; if one can sever love of it, then all things can sever love; then heart is already silent and soundless, utterly empty; cultivated thus, foundation may be built, Way may be accomplished, no need to start anew. Moreover, life is long kalpa; who has no grievances? If功 and行accumulated, obstacles and demons cut off, grievances transform, then the great elixir can be accomplished. Moreover wealth is not only used by the common folk to enrich families, but spirits and ghosts also use it to settle rewards and punishments. I can widely distribute money, make great offerings to save and rescue, or for deliverance, or to support the Great Way, save the true heart; then heaven, earth, ghosts, and spirits surely love and admire, secretly envy such utmost benevolence, thus assist to become Immortal, becoming wings to ghosts and spirits, assistants to heaven and earth. From this view, heaven, earth, ghosts, and spirits depend on me, do they not protect in every way? If dust roots not removed, private favor hard to sever, only knowing fame and gain in the world, unable to transcend vulgarity and excel, then when Immortal, enjoying endless leisure, receiving boundless offerings, once the great calamity approaches, will one still sacrifice self to save the world, descend to serve the people? This is unreasonable. The gods and heavens observe; hence must verify conduct and cultivate in wealth and goods, discern truth and falsehood. Saying goes: "Value virtue as gold and jade; regard wealth as dung." This is difficult for men. The heavens have no heart, taking men’s heart as heart; spirits have no thought, taking men’s thought as thought. If men do all things on the path of justice, then gods and heaven will surely repay with justice. Otherwise private heart will have no good reward. You must not weary of hearing this.

### XV
You have studied the mysterious Way many decades, yet the foundation is not built; why? Because cultivation is without order, practice not genuine, advancing fire and gathering medicine not truly grasped. If you know my Way’s truth, taking at proper time, matching the seasons, refining and nurturing according to law, why delay to this day without accomplishment? Though age advanced, spirit still strong, fit to be my school’s successor. But I think your household affairs are scattered, unable to use wealth for good. Know that from ancient Immortal teachers, the first test of talents is wealth; seeing if he can break through the lost way. If he can see through this, then private desires are not hard to sweep away. Moreover, none but sages are free of grievances. If one can give wealth generously, accumulate功and cultivate diligently, then heaven demons, earth demons, human demons, ghost demons are not hard to turn from anger to joy, release resentment to auspiciousness. This is one method of dispelling demons and cutting obstacles by wealth. If putting the blame on you, unlikely to succeed. As for hearing, seeing, speaking, acting, the many affairs of daily life, there are many good deeds; only fear not careful inspection, not true practice. If one can with one heart take refuge, then everywhere and always great and lasting good deeds are far superior to this person’s small fruit. Learners must know, without using wealth or labor, good deeds are everywhere in sitting, walking, lying down, standing. Only constantly examine, not allow one thought to stray, not let one matter pass lightly; thus many good deeds and conscience manifest, then the Great Way has its foundation. Otherwise, merely cultivating life treasure without cleaning the heart ground is like cooking sand to make rice; can it be obtained? Hence the ancient Immortal said: "Refine jade liquid to perfect nature, then refine gold liquid to perfect life." What is refining jade? It is cultivating nature. Learners must first work on every subtle thing; from this the external body is cultivated, then study of sincerity and uprightness of words and intentions. When private desires are thoroughly pure, heavenly principle flows, then self is ripe and the elixir foundation can be formed. Otherwise, elixir lacks foundation, how can there be medicine? The Wuzhen says: "If no true seed is in the cauldron, it is as if boiling empty pot of water and fire." You men of knowledge, do you think thus or not? Having nurtured heart ground perfectly, then work for moments, nearing the furnace to gather medicine, then lead can be drawn, mercury added, circulating fire seasons, bathing and nurturing, foundation can be built, forever becoming human Immortal. Add wall-facing work, then heavenly and divine Immortals can be gradually made. I see you study the Way many years; why foundation not firm? One, heart ground not clear of dust; mixing sand with earth, hard to make golden light; two, only knowing to take external elixir, not knowing to refine spiritual elixir; so one day and one night often interrupted, not always sealing furnace, thus risk of loss. Now I reveal one step. The ancients said: "Concentrate spirit in emptiness, unite qi in vastness." This emptiness cave, the ancients said: "Not in the body, yet not apart from the body." This is what the Most High calls "Valley spirit not dying, called mysterious female." This mysterious female gate, without cultivation, is not seen in form; must suspend breath, then primal breath begins to move. Nurture long, then mysterious female opens and closes, externally connects with heaven’s root, internally with earth’s axis, densely around the navel; one aperture opens and all body hair pores open; this is the so-called embryonic breath, like an infant not yet out of mother’s womb, breathing with the mother’s qi. If you can grasp this aperture, it is fundamentally different from merely refining breath of mouth and nose. From now on, you must slightly gather the mouth and nose breath, gathering till breath seems to vanish; then the mysterious female gate opens and primal breath appears. This primal breath is the foundation of human life; if gathered from this, you may obtain true essence, true qi, and true spirit. Though age advanced, having heard the wondrous truth, you must labor day and night; like Buddha refusing to rise until seeing the Tathāgata, sitting and seeing blue sky beneath; such work fierce and strong,功may be accomplished. Without a piece of sincere heart, I dare not privately teach; only then can plan be revised.

### XVI
Now autumn qi just arrives, yet the fierce summer sun is no different from the height of summer heat. Why? Because Yang qi has not fully discharged; at the summer-autumn junction, the remaining heat must be discharged before autumn coolness can enter. The sage studies to defy heaven; at the end of the hot heat, wholeheartedly gathers and restrains, nothing at all in heart; let him burn the sky and scorch the earth with fierce qi, I am myself; how can that enter and move my heart? This is stillness of yin, movement of yang. If man can be still as motionless water, like a clear deep pool, why fear invasion of summer heat? The invader is not the heat’s power, but my heart’s movement; thus qi moves and spirit follows, changing with creation. Thinking thus, one knows that life and death are not caused by heaven, but man’s self-birth and self-death in between. Masters who understand this principle, if you guard one heart within, alone observe the aperture of emptiness, quietly listen to the silent heaven, then heart will be constant, qi steady, like the Vast Void’s emptiness, not decaying with all things. In sum, this work is no more than one mysterious female gate. The ancients said: "Mysterious female gate is rarely known; do not recklessly use mouth and nose breath. Even if you breathe for a thousand years, how to catch the golden crow and seize the rabbit?" Thus the mysterious female gate is not what present-day masters teach as breath out is Xuan, breath in is Yin; nor is it in the Li palace, the Kan palace, nor the water and fire two qi; it is between being and non-being, neither inside nor outside; when father and mother combine essence, a point of spirit falls into the womb; this is the true meaning of the mysterious female. You learners must carefully distinguish. If you say it is breath out Xuan and breath in Yin, it is confused and indistinct, utterly without trace, falling to stubborn emptiness. For other beginners, I only point out a real trace amid form and colour. If your功is advanced, you can discern the subtle. I heard the ancients say: "If thought does not cease for a hair, breath cannot settle; if breath is not settled for a hair, life is not mine." Thus the mysterious female moves from breath to no breath, to great stillness and great calm, then its truth is seen. Recently in work, though breath can be regulated, not yet returning to utmost emptiness and stillness; the mysterious female gate still cannot appear. Only at day and night, regardless of affairs or quiet, in change and constancy, constantly with spirit light gaze directly at the lower field, gathering spirit and qi into the mysterious single aperture; at first one breath and one exhale still feel coarse and strong, long then feel subtle and fine, then still less; longer still, feel as if present and absent, then more settled. When breath is pure returned to spirit, no breath to be seen; then is great still and great calm, refining elixir with medicine to gather; this can awaken the mysterious female gate, see the birth of the body’s receiving of qi, this is the true mysterious female message; cultivate by this and elixir can be formed. Otherwise if one breath not ceased, spirit follows qi movement, qi and spirit move; how can mysterious female be said? Not knowing to settle breath and quiet spirit, merely working on active breath and thought spirit, no elixir can form, no medicine can be obtained; life cannot be established, illness cannot be removed. This is why mysterious female is the foundation of alchemy. Knowing this, the Way is not far.

### XVII
The Daoists cultivate the void and non-being spirit, nourishing the void and non-being elixir. It is not formless yet with form, nor form without formlessness. This is the true secret, not to be explicated by words and letters. Learners must from the meditation seat, step by step according to law, carefully examine their own bodies, then can they know the message. I earlier spoke of the mysterious female gate; in truth, mysterious is the Li gate, female is the Kan door. Only when the true Yin descends in Li, true Yang ascends in Kan, meeting in the central yellow correct position, long coagulating into one qi, then the Li sprays jade pistil and Kan emits gold petal. Jade pistil and gold petal are not real things, only words for Kan and Li coupling, body and mind both at peace; eyes have the light of wisdom pearl, heart has boundless delight, like the clarity, purity, and delicacy of gold and jade, without measurable flaw. However, without external breath constantly regulating and nurturing, internal spirit and qi cannot coalesce. The ancients said: "If mysterious and yellow do not couple, how can Yang fly up from Kan below?" Thus heaven and earth have no功, using sun and moon as功; the human body is useless without water and fire; without sun and moon, heaven and earth are dead things; without water and fire, the human body is but a corpse shell. Sun and moon are spirit of heaven and earth; water and fire are primal qi of the body. Only when meeting in the center, internal primal qi uses external breath to gather; at first feeling separate, later gathering into one ball, then true Yang is born. If Yin and Yang do not couple, the vaporous primal qi does not unite; to desire Yang to be born, how can it be obtained? Ridiculous that worldly men, with unrefined spirit qi, suddenly sitting and seeing external Yang rising, think Yang birth and medicine produced. How know this is postnatal consciousness causing it, earthly fire stirred to move; how can it enter medicine? Know that true Yang’s movement is not only essence birth, but qi and spirit are present. Must first clear spirit and eliminate thought, reduce desires and purify heart, then hold breath at mouth and nose together; then true breath appears, embryonic breath born, primal spirit issues, primal qi blends. Thereafter add advancing fire and retreating talisman, bathing and nurturing methods; naturally a point of primordial true Yang arises, spiritual light manifests; use this medicine to expel all evil and selfishness in the body; use this elixir to accomplish the Dharma form of the Tathāgata. The ancients said: "Do not forget, do not aid the wondrous breathing; must start work here. Regulate the two qi to produce embryonic breath; then set the cauldron in the center." Thus establish furnace and set cauldron to refine true medicine. If not yet ceased earthly breath and embryonic breath appears, then empty furnace and cauldron useless, in vain using fire talisman; elixir cannot be accomplished. Even if said to have elixir, only phantom elixir; not only cannot communicate with spirit, even to repel illness and prolong life may fail. In sum, mysterious female coupling with mysterious yellow meeting is nothing but sweeping out Yin qi, revealing only Yang light; like blue sky and white sun, this is Kan and Li coupling, true Yang manifest. With slightest dullness, Yin qi not dispelled; with one point of scattering, Yang spirit not matured, cannot be called pure Yang. I heard the ancients say: "If man has one part Yin not transformed, he cannot become Immortal." Hence Master Lü’s Dao name Pure Yang. This shows those half Yin and Yang are ordinary men; Yin qi strong are evil ghosts; Yang qi full are heavenly Immortals. The Yi thus restrains Yin and supports Yang, removing Yin and preserving Yang. Yet this stage of work is not easily attained; must long accumulate essence and qi, shed desires and preserve sincerity, refining to no thought and no care, alert and bright, clear and always luminous, natural one thought appearing, master of my body, with no things seen within, no following of things without. This is the scene of the great return of gold liquid. If one thought not removed, still cannot avoid the burden of the world. You must know, to refine to great awakened golden Immortal, cannot be slow in shedding desires and preserving sincerity; learn the gentleman’s care in solitude is enough.

### XVIII
The art of cultivation has no other marvel than regulating the fire season. Alchemy has civil fire, martial fire, bathing and nurturing fire, returning furnace and sealing fire; these are the main distinctions. Martial fire used when? At the beginning, spirit not concentrated, breath not regulated, spirit and qi ununited; then one should apply slight tightening of thought, counting breaths to raise momentary leak; this is martial fire. When spirit slightly concentrated, breath slightly regulated, spirit and qi somewhat united but not mature; then civil fire is used to support firmly, relaxing thought slightly, not like former deadened counting; this is civil fire. The ancients said: "In field battle use martial fire; in city defense use civil fire." What is field battle? Like arms and uproar in autumn, bandit atmosphere rising, must use soldiers to fight back demons and bandits; this is called martial fire. When arms are quiet, beacon fires ceased, must arrange the people, manage occupations; though not using military power, must yet be on guard; this is civil fire, with or without intention. If people peaceful and things abundant, rains timely, winds mild, no alarms of dogs and fowls, few quarrels; then civil and martial fires unused, only bathing and nurturing fire used. Bathing has two kinds. Mao bathing is advancing fire to the utmost; fearing it will rise and rise again, harmful; so stop talisman not used, slight nurturing suffices. Though resting work, breath still rising as before. Ascending to Mud Pellet, refining Mud Pellet’s Yin qi; this is the time. Yang qi rising, true life at its peak; hence Mao is gate of birth. You bathing is retreating talisman to utmost; fearing over-application of retreat gathers Yin qi in the central palace, preventing Yang elixir formation. Learners here must stop work, not use talisman, only soft qi to nurture, awaiting naturalness; this is You bathing, anciently called gate of death; I called gathering spirit light falling to the red palace, not like Mao’s gathering spirit at Mud Pellet. Yet these are only images; learners must not cling to images and words, becoming sitting dead guards. As for returning furnace and sealing, at this time fire without fire, medicine without medicine, completely from no heart, no intention; but heart and intention are all present. This is the mysterious female gate showing its true state. But this work, unless arriving at fire season’s maturity, cannot see its subtlety. If you sit not yet ceased earthly breath and embryonic breath appears, empty furnace and cauldron, vainly using fire talisman, elixir cannot be formed. If elixir be said, it is phantom elixir, not able to communicate with spirit; to repel illness and prolong life may also fail. In sum, mysterious female coupling, mysterious yellow meeting, is but sweeping out Yin qi, revealing Yang light, like blue sky and white sun; this is Kan and Li coupling, true Yang appearing. With slightest dullness, Yin qi not dispelled; one point scattering, Yang spirit not old, cannot be said pure Yang. I heard ancients say: "If man has one part Yin not transformed, cannot become Immortal." Hence Lüzu’s Dao name Pure Yang. This shows ordinary men half Yin and Yang; Yin qi full are evil ghosts; Yang qi strong are heavenly Immortals. Yi uses to suppress Yin and support Yang, remove Yin and preserve Yang. Yet this step of work is hard. Must long accumulate essence and qi, shed desires and keep sincerity, refining to no thought and no care, alert and bright, clear and luminous, natural one thought appearing, master of body, no thing within, no turning without. This is scene of great golden return. Slight thought not removed, still burdened by world. You must know to become great awakened golden Immortal, must slowly shed desires and keep sincerity, learning gentleman’s care in solitude suffices.

### XIX
I show you a living method. The alchemical books say: "On the third day, a crescent like a new moon, is the start of one point of Yang essence arising; this is the new tender medicine, urgent to gather." But in my thought, not so confined. When you sit in cultivation, slightly use some spirit light to look down into the elixir field’s qi cavity, so spirit and qi mutually support; this is the beginning of one Yang moving; do not hasten to roast or refine fiercely, but gently gather with external breath suffices. The ancients said: "Two parts of new tender water, matched by two parts of new tender fire," so water does not overflow, fire does not scorch, slowly nurture and bathe, gradually drawing and adding, water and fire naturally harmonize, body and mind naturally refreshed, showing the sign of medicine being born. Yet qi mechanism is still slight, medicine not strong; do not quickly use River Chariot to disperse spirit. This is the image of the eighth day and first quarter moon with one point of丁fire. If you wish to move ascending and descending endlessly, must wait till medicine qi is full, bursting forth and spreading, shining bright between the eyebrows, clear as points of stars—its mechanism open and bright beyond compare; not that there really are stars flickering visible—below in the elixir field, vast as tides overflowing—real qi flowing fully so; not a tide really flowing; this is metaphor, do not look for traces. When this scene comes, then like the fifteenth day full moon, filling the great thousand worlds, shining over the Ganges; this is the birth of great medicine, can begin work and gather, move River Chariot, ascend and descend, advance and retreat; thus nurture and refine day by day; naturally wisdom opens, spirit greatly grows. Otherwise water just beginning tide, gold not born, yet hastening with spirit fire fiercely roasting, not only gold qi not born, but earthly fire’s heat burns away all primal essence and primal qi. If medicine qi already grown, yet still using two parts fire to respond, then gold qi strong but fire not matching; like furnace fire refining iron, ore many but coal few, fire weak, fire buried by ore, how can melting gold and making useful metal be expected? Such delicate work is for you to measure on your seat, increasing or decreasing, soft or hard, setting its balanced measure. Hence it is said: "At the furnace weigh the measure, two parts water have surplus, the third part not entering, fire two parts with them." This is the meaning. Generally using work to gather and refine, must know which is true Yang qi, which is false Yang qi. When advancing Yang fire to gather true Yang substance; when retreating Yin talisman to expel extreme Yin substance; Mao and You two times bathing to preserve true Yang. Know that Yang should not be too hard; too hard breaks, must use gentle Way to aid it. Yin should not be too soft; too soft is weak, must be ruled by hard virtue. Mao bathing is to prevent Yang from being too hard; You bathing is to prevent Yin from being too soft. If Yang qi too hard, earthly fire is drawn upward, harming upper burner. Yin qi too soft, true Yang repelled, Yin qi becomes master, desires arise constantly, no rest, body becomes weak and limp. How to deal? The law is to illuminate clearly with spirit, gather and restrain, not allowing Yin qi to secretly grow within; naturally Yang grows and Yin dissipates, able to refine sleep demon.

The Way of cultivation is to return to one's own lost original. Regardless of old or young, wise or foolish, all can learn. Yet world men do not know this truth, do not dismiss themselves for age, but paint themselves as foolish. Not knowing this heavenly secret originally in the Vast Void, confused and vast, not increased or decreased by age or folly! Only fear men do not set their heart to seek. Hence one point of primordial Yang essence falling into postnatal dust and filth, sinks deeper without return. Do you know this? Like Yang birth of medicine, always with solemn correct sitting cross-legged, breathing out to the utmost, invisible outside, breathing in to the bottom, without form below; looking slightly upward with eyes, this is taking medicine. If medicine qi is strong, use sucking, licking, closing methods, tightly closing six gates, preserving spirit and fixing thought; this is the correct method. I speak further: spirit must not move or waver; heart must be able to be empty and humble; body like Mount Tai, heart like cold deep pool; single heart and will, naturally true qi rushes straight up, not like other paths led by thought. Know this qi is not external qi, it is the one primordial vapor qi entering the womb at birth, hidden by postnatal breath and unseen. Once earthly breath ceases, true breath reveals. Especially know that true qi born, my body’s master firmly sits in the central courtyard, only then is there governance. Thus alchemy says: "Hidden within the Heaven Pole, outside pushing the Big Dipper," this is the formula. If medicine qi born and circulating, inside not hidden in Heaven Pole, then qi mechanism has no master, must have errors and wild actions. If medicine qi circulates but outside not pushing Big Dipper, still clinging to the courtyard, no birth and growth of mechanism, like heaven and earth using sun and moon as功, sun and moon using heaven and earth as master, this is body and use complete, root and branch accord. As for advancing fire at Zi hour, it is the beginning of the primal chaos, the first division of chaos; at that time dim and obscure, this is the hiding of the Dharma eye. Retreating talisman at Wu hour is like spring giving birth to all things, reaching its peak at Wu; at this time life is vigorous, Yang qi at its height, truly correct transmission. Mao bathing is after Zi hour advancing fire, Yin generating Yang; at this time Yang is not much, Yin not little; the elixir classic says: "Upper quarter gold eight liang, obtaining water within gold half jin," meaning Yin and Yang harmonize, not contending, so talisman should stop moving. Yet Yang qi not pure, Yin qi not yet almost ceased; must again use two times fire, raising it straight up; this is Mao bathing. Observing the six prospects, gradually Yang diminishes, Yin grows; called Yin talisman because life depends on Kan, first half month for advance and Yang, nature lodged in Li; second half month for retreat and Yin; this is said "Diving deep in the abyss, uniting qi in vastness," "Moving to refine life, stillness to nurture nature," letting nature’s emptiness enter stillness; thus called retreat Yin talisman, meaning "Roll it up and it retreats into secrecy." This is its meaning. If as some masters say, Yang born at fifteen is peak, Yin growing from sixteen is yet born, called ordinary Yin; still dull and confused, why need retreat talisman? No such reason. My master does not explain this further, fearing you do not understand that ascending and descending, advancing and retreating are all to support Yang and suppress Yin; if they think retreat talisman means dull silence and stillness, this is a great mistake. My master’s teaching cannot be bought for a million gold, nor given away on the street; no partiality. Masters, listen to my teaching and single-heartedly work upward. I will not fail you; do not be like others doubting, wishing to cultivate but not cultivating, relying on wealth for life.

Masters’功increasing, fire season mature, the whole chest full of true intention. When primordial divine fire grows, postnatal earthly fire flourishes; if thought is not self-controlled, anger arises, resentment arises, lust arises, greed arises, all jealousy, hatred, and anger; all are postnatal earthly fire. When fire arises, there is danger of evil fire burning the body. I see many cultivators who in daily cultivation, only in deep mountains nurturing quietly, avoiding men’s affairs; when going out and shining, suddenly a furnace fire arises, and tons of spiritual sand fall to the ground. This is why I teach people not to cultivate only in quiet places, but must also refine in bustling city crowds. Fire not yet gathered causes no great harm, but when fully gathered and deeply hidden, it is different from the beginning. Or the whole body twitches, or six entrails move, or five senses manifest images and sounds; as long as true qi circulates, spirit can settle; do not be alarmed by movement. I always maintain one unmoved heart, disregard others, increase nurturing and care, wishing to refine to death’s gate. My master explains this; you must learn from Master Zeng’s lifelong vigilance, and so have no illness. Hence cultivators all life long sit in bottomless boats and walk on rotten wood bridges. Even if fire newly born today, medicine still immature, must guard against fire rising to consume primal spirit. Otherwise, after years of nurturing, collapse at once, a great pity. As for receiving and responding to people and matters, all things to be done when due, to stop when due, once decided, no doubting; even in money matters, if not allowed, then not; if allowed, a promise worth a thousand pieces of gold, no change; to avoid external insult disturbing heart and inner thoughts arising to trouble heart; this is also a method to remove vexations. For vexations are fire, when fire arises elixir injured; they cannot coexist. If you can understand my words, guarding constantly, protecting always, how can elixir not be formed? In sum, the Way of elixir has ten thousand words, but is only spirit and qi. At first spirit and qi separate; I thus use spirit to regulate qi, qi to condense spirit; in the end spirit and qi merge into void, forming a pearl as large as a millet grain, suspended in the place unattached to the four elements and five phases, a scene of emptiness. This is "breaking through Vast Void emptiness, standing alone as Dharma King body." The whole work is no more than nature and temperament; first harmonize nature and sentiment, then sentiment returns to nature; when nature and sentiment are one, original Dharma body manifests; this is returning to root and original, recalling the beginning of life’s receiving of qi. Yet not yet the utmost supreme marvel. When man not yet born, a point of spirit hidden in the Vast Void, invisible to sight, inaudible to hearing, intangible; at that time what is nature? What is sentiment? Thus even nature and sentiment are things with form and substance, only postnatal within primordial; because they still have dependence. At this highest step, not clinging to having nature nor no sentiment, not even erecting having or not having nature and sentiment; this is transcending nature and sentiment, cultivating one point of void primal qi, called emptiness and forgetting; actually forgetting nothing, emptiness nothing; returning to Vast Void; even heaven and earth do not act for me; this can produce sons and grandsons, manifest hundreds of billions of Dharma bodies, transformations without end. If only not leaving one emptiness, still second vehicle. Even this emptiness also none, hence mysterious and unfathomable. This is the ultimate work of the Golden Elixir. Masters, heed and guard.

The Way of alchemy, though said to be the brewing of primordial qi, in truth without postnatal visible qi primordial qi cannot be seen; thus post and prior two qi both indispensable. Without postnatal turbid qi, primordial one qi cannot spontaneously arise; without primordial pure emptiness one qi, postnatal corpse qi is but a tool of illusion, insufficient to form the embryonic Immortal. I observe you have not truly recognized or cultivated the primordial one qi because postnatal form body is too weak, unable vigorously to perceive the original void wondrous form. Now I again speak on postnatal qi. The reason the body is strong and fresh is this postnatal qi sufficient. Where is qi? It is the breath in and out, circulating within the body, vaporous and latent. This qi is kidney’s moving qi, lung governs exhaling, kidney receives inhaling, one out and one in, circulating in the central yellow palace; thus internal viscera and external limbs all move; nowhere not moving, nowhere not filling, called body and mind both at peace, hair and skin all bright and refined. As for postnatal, the lung’s breath out, kidney’s breath in, both balanced and even, no excess or deficiency, naturally no illness, can live long and not age. But primordial is metal producing water, i.e. heaven one produces water; postnatal must produce metal from earth, metal producing water, metal and water balanced, producing endlessly; thus must regulate diet, reduce flavour, be cautious in words to nurture lung qi, less thinking to nurture spleen qi; with every movement regulating labor and rest, avoiding drowsiness, then earth strong can produce metal, metal strong can produce water, water qi flowing, spleen earth moistens, metal clear and water white, can shine and spread unhindered. You desire to gather primordial qi stored in the central palace, blowing constantly, transforming endlessly; cannot neglect the breath of one out and one in, spirit and qi blending and uniting, harmonizing without separation; then postnatal qi sufficient, primordial qi begins to arise. If not regulating postnatal, merely seeking primordial qi, like cooking sand to make rice, impossible to obtain. When postnatal corpse qi gathers in the center, primordial qi freely within, vaporous, indistinct, rising and falling, unspeakable and unnamable, yet also unnamable. If said can be named, all is postnatal qi, insufficient to restore origin and form Immortal bones. Do you know? When primordial qi appears, only one point is verifiable: heart like a lively spring, body like a towering rock, naturally whole body inside and out without discomfort, without obstruction; not obtained by thought or deed. Hence primordial one qi is called emptiness and primal qi. From this view, one sees primordial one qi cannot be named or pointed to; later men forcibly name it primordial one qi. Being forcibly named, it actually does not exist. Learners, when storing this primordial harmony, yet still want to model a form in body and mind, this is error, error! Moreover this modeling mind is postnatal thought. With this one thought, the pure primordial qi must be scattered by postnatal qi; though called primordial, it is still postnatal. Masters near my Way have glimpsed its source; I trust you can understand my master’s words today and no longer let postnatal consciousness be master. At the start of cultivation, fearing unknowing of the truth, must find master and friends, seek actual location; every step has solid footing. When great Way is clear, cultivate in body, refine into medicine, must also wipe away all former knowledge and views, allow no trace of confusion; instead break the mysterious yellow mixture, unable to coagulate into one ball. The ancients said: "Breaking empty space is the proper way." Think on this: empty space two words are not to be fixed; what may be added? Like children laughing, angry, all natural and spontaneous; no thought before, no thought after, letting it proceed at will, myself utterly uninvolved. Though easy to say, to truly and really understand the subtlety, takes decades of hard labor, to discern the subtle.

I think of your toil for many years, yet not clear about this one qi; I will preemptively explain. This emptiness and one qi is also called true one qi, also true one essence, also natural primordial qi, also pure empty one qi; many names and colours, not one but enough; all must be soundless and odourless, thoughtless and careless true; yet not within, not without, hidden in the coloured body; called Dharma body. Yet being hard to measure, hard to fathom, yet far and near; Confucius said: "When I desire benevolence, benevolence is attained," showing this primordial qi is natural, never once absent, absent this no birth, how can one become man? Yet how to seek it? Still, the word seeking adds many errors and many layers of obstruction. Only as you said, all let go, not a trace held, all conditions unstained; this emptiness qi is therein. Your功long accumulated, surely clear without doubt. Know this emptiness one qi, heaven and earth and man are all one, rich and poor are one principle; even life and death suffering do not alter it. Breath has fullness and emptiness, brightness and darkness, all qi mechanism moving; but seeking only qi’s brightness for emptiness one qi; at times of turbidity think it absent. Yet this primordial qi is not because of brightness present, not because of turbidity absent; only fear not shedding desires and preserving principle, letting wrong return to right. When qi is clear, there is lingering and looking around; when qi is turbid, there is added worry and vexation; though primordial qi is present like sun and moon illuminating, yet because of obstruction mind arises, like floating clouds covering and sun and moon have no light. Most of all understand this primordial qi has no trace, no form or colour; in truth it is root of postnatal essence, qi, and spirit, master of primordial essence, qi, and spirit. Hence emptiness one qi is born in primordial yin and yang, falls in postnatal yin and yang. In sum, if man can clear away idle thoughts, all arising and moving thought obstacles, pure and clean without dust, that is enough. Yet among young men, qi strong and easy to meet its truth; among advanced age it is still hard to harmonize qi and blood, preserve spiritual light, gather this one point of utmost Yang essence; what to do? I explain again a gathering and refining method. The Yi says: "Still and unmoving, sensing and communicating." When qi not yet seen, you may use spirit light to look down, causing this spirit fire to move the metal trapped in the water palace, long letting water fire arise, then true gold emerges from ore. This sensing and corresponding is near to influence. Hence ancients taught beginners in stillness and immobility to gather no medicine, teaching to use spirit light to look down, and at the place of communication to begin; thus to gather primordial one flavour most true qi, to use as elixir foundation. Also this moving qi is not primordial qi; must know primordial qi before shaping, never absent; yet when shaped, visible form is not true one qi; must rely on the manifestation of true one qi. When manifesting, dim and obscure, slightly recognizable; this too is seeing shadow and knowing form; actually still nothing seen. When manifest clear and bright, "letting it go fills the six directions," even heaven and earth cannot contain it; so called origin of heaven, earth, man, and all beings. Though boundless, still does not leave the mind’s square inch; "Roll it up and it retreats into secrecy," this is its meaning. Thus think that vapor and mist are still Yin Yang true qi, and master of this true qi is the supreme primordial qi. Do you know? Hence from ancient Immortals probing this depth and source, exhausting its spirit and knowing transformation, refining form returns to one qi, refining qi returns to emptiness; must borrow false form to shape truth. Also hears ancients say: "True one qi is invisible, soundless." How can it coagulate to form a millet grain pearl? The sages by law gather it in one time period; the law is to return light and reflect, using self to move, the other responds itself. When true one qi appears, yet invisible; how can it be grasped and gathered to take and ingest, to become a void Immortal? The sages use having to form no form, reality to form emptiness. Reality and having is dark true Yang; emptiness and no form is the two dragons and eight initial strings qi. Must use this visible form to refine the formless primordial qi, then it may be called elixir. You now hearing my true one qi, surely no more think postnatal yin yang or primordial yin yang as true one qi; nearly at the Way.

### XXIV
The Way of cultivation, men only know two layers of heaven and earth, four kinds of Yin and Yang; how can they know beyond primordial and postnatal Yin and Yang, must also not separate true spirit’s knowledge, which is root of heaven and earth, origin of creation? What is postnatal Yin and Yang? It is when man’s body begins to be conceived, borrowing father’s essence and mother’s blood to be born. At Zi hour Kan has one Yang qi circulating within body and without; at Wu hour Li has one Yin qi flowing through six entrails and bones; two qi alternate, without obstruction, thus daily seeing their growth. When grown to adult, much thinking harms spirit; fondness for lust harms essence; spirit declines; the body’s Yin and Yang no longer circulate. The sage by following the normal Way, practices the reverse alchemy; first lowering curtain and closing gates, stopping thoughts and forgetting mechanism, silently returning light to the one aperture in the elixir field, to gather true Yang qi, refining true Yin essence. This is primordial Yin and Yang born in emptiness, not sought in the coloured body. Thus concentrating spirit and regulating breath, breath and spirit mutually depend, and true Yang born in Kan at living Zi hour, thus moving to gather and raise; living Wu hour Li true Yin born at that time, thus stillness to nurture and gather in the mysterious one aperture. Men only know stillness nurturing, not knowing movement gathering, how to return to the palace? Or only know movement gathering, not knowing stillness nurturing, how to coagulate elixir? This must not be confused. Most of all know living Zi hour arrives, the so-called "dim and faint, something within, deep and obscure, essence within." Having something and essence are manifestations of primordial Yin and Yang, yet not the body of Great Ultimate. The Great Ultimate body is response to stimulus; one movement is awareness; the so-called time arrives, spirit knows; this is primordial true knowledge. Learners must recognize this clearly, then obtain primordial one qi. Living Wu hour arrives; though Li has supreme Yin essence sign, like a bright orb, still not primordial true essence, root of Great Ultimate. Know at this time alert and bright, natural one thought appearing, able to govern myriad changes; this is what ancients called spiritual knowledge in the heart, primordial true essence manifest. At this time, in ignorant learners, occasionally signs appear, heart and spirit joyous, with a heart of illumination, or desiring it to last; thus primordial though originally nothing, by one heart going to observe and cherish, adds another obstruction; primordial is then obscured by postnatal, heavenly heart then drowned by human heart. When students face this natural true Lord appearing, only not clinging, not departing, not forgetting, not aiding, is enough. But at the beginning, must know kidney one Yang born, with true knowledge manifest, heart one Yin born, with spiritual knowledge sign and image. When功deep and study long, kidney true knowledge also changes to spirit, heart spiritual knowledge changes to true; true and spirit unite as one, true spirit changes to none; called Dharani di true spirit Qian di Sarva ha. I observe you in meditation, no different; but not yet medicine born time, can count breaths to regulate breath; when medicine qi returns, do not again use counting breaths martial fire, must let natural spirit fire nurture elixir; master sitting watching is enough. Know? You though long cultivating, cannot greatly raise Yang qi, because little attention here. Confucius praised Yan Zi for one good, taking it seriously and never forgetting; because when not obtained, must seek it, cannot avoid martial fire; after seeking and obtaining, must not again use martial fire; must use natural spirit fire to nurture elixir; master sitting watching is enough; thus uniting movement and stillness, martial and civil, cultivation. My master today teaches what ancient alchemical scriptures dare not lightly reveal, I have spoken fully. Masters must not think it accidental.

### XXV
The study of nature and life dual cultivation is not unique to my Way; even the three teachings’ saints cannot escape. Beginning with nature establishing life, next life perfecting nature, ending with nature and life united, returning to emptiness and void body, fully complete. Nature is originally void, wholly without things; yet must be void containing utmost reality, nothing containing utmost being, so as not to fall into stubborn emptiness. Learners begin work, lay down all conditions, unstained by dust, to utmost emptiness and perfect stillness; dim and obscure, yet with bright spirit shining, illuminating the great thousand worlds; this is the clear platform’s deep stillness; Buddha calls it great awakening Tathāgata; Dao calls it spiritual knowledge and true knowledge. But man has after body, a point of true spirit long soiled by dust; great cultivators must remove thought and dust ties, and in stillness nurture clues; this is clarity of
