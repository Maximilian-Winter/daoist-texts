## Records of the Hall of Joyous Nurture, Volume Four (Section Twenty-Six)
### I
The matter of cultivation is founded upon the conduct of hidden merit and virtue, and chiefly depends on careful maintenance and nurturing. As for the talk concerning the combination of dragon and tiger, mercury and lead, this is but a matter of minor concern. There are certain ignorant men who do not understand this practice, and rashly say, “I cultivate my nature, I refine my life; what need then to await external cultivation of merit to assist men and benefit things?” They all know not the way of “exhausting nature so as to reach life.” In former times Confucius told Yan Zi that the beginning of benevolence must commence from seeing, hearing, words, and acts; my way does not depart from this, how could it be otherwise? For that which controls the external is the means to nourish the internal: thus the eyes constantly seeing good causes liver and soul to be at peace; the ears constantly hearing good causes kidney essence to be strong; the mouth constantly speaking good causes heart spirit to be tranquil; the nose constantly smelling good causes lung soul to be calm; hands doing good deeds and feet walking on good ground cause spleen earth to be always stable, and the body also to be healthy. So long as the six internal gates do not admit improper things, the five internal viscera possess by nature their original qi. From this again use is made of internal nurturing to accumulate the original qi of the five viscera, so that liver qi transforms and the soul returns to the origin; lung qi transforms and the po returns to the origin; spleen earth condenses and the yi returns to the origin; heart fire flourishes and the shen returns to the origin; kidney water strengthens and the jing returns to the origin. This is what is called the gathering of the three flowers in the cauldron, the five qi returning to the origin and condensing to form a method body. But if one who is full of selfishness and deceit is given the true secret, not only will he fail to cultivate successfully, but if he should succeed, he will surely overturn the cauldron and the tripod, doing great harm. Therefore, at the outset, one must first accumulate external merit and internal virtue, nurturing both inside and outside; only then can one be pure, bright, and refined, ready to be refined into the elixir. Hence the initial stage of effort is called establishing the foundation. This is like making a terrace a thousand fathoms high: one must start from the flat ground and build a firm foundation, then the tall buildings and painted pavilions will not fear collapse. I have observed that not few of my disciples, looking from now on, advance only if they are people of simple conduct and delight in goodness. If they had not accumulated virtue in former years, or if they did so without sincerity, they cannot penetrate deeply into my way. Those who have labored long, enduring hardships without retreat, whose heart nature is so pure and whose essence and qi so strong, are able to hear my secret and practice it without hindrance. I now specially transmit the true Yang single formula. The study of alchemy indeed requires nourishing the postnatal spirit and qi to strengthen the physical body, but it especially requires nourishing the prenatal heart and nature to complete the method body. Though the physical body and method body differ in subtlety and interior and exterior, their essence is inseparable. Without the physical body, what is the base for the method body? Without the method body, the physical body is merely a form. Every cultivator must first secure the postnatal spirit and qi, then the prenatal heart and nature can be cultivated. Though I say refining essence to transform qi, indeed qi is the spirit of the heart; though I say refining qi to transform spirit, indeed spirit is the emptiness of nature. Only by lengthening my essence and qi can the heart spirit be seen; by preserving my original spirit can the true nature be retained. When the scholar arrives at the state of spirit concentration and qi vigor, the original qi is vast and the original spirit lively, and my own original heart nature naturally penetrates its true principle; from this returning the golden liquid of the elixir is no difficulty. Hence, establishing the foundation concerns the matter of nature; returning the elixir concerns the work of life. It means using nature to establish life, that is, refining the emptiness of nature into the reality of life, producing myriad transformed bodies, all condensed from this nature; there is no other way. If you understand this principle, you will know that the way of cultivation is nothing but to accomplish the single character nature, and to return to my prenatal single qi. Know that this qi existed before having form, pure and empty in the void, without distinction; once it falls into the human body, it transforms into two qi, yin and yang, which generate the five elements and the body formed by their transformations. I then condense the yin and yang and five elements into one qi; this is the elixir. Nourished long and refined deeply, after ten years one must surely become a most spiritual and most sacred immortal child, all formed from this original qi; the original qi is nature. Only by operating the spirit of the one source and the qi of the one source can the way be nearly attained.

### II
I reveal one mysterious gate, the root of the cultivator, the first task of the scholar. Unlike the middle and lower vehicles which describe gates having form and name, you must from chaos return to chaos, having thus the foundation of the elixir, the root of spirit and immortality. At first sitting in meditation, one's heart must be vast, clear, and luminous, wandering in the boundless region, circulating breath in the place of emptiness. But one must not be wholly outward; one must be as if inside but not inside, as if outside but not outside, so that my heart's qi and the spiritual yang qi of heaven and earth communicate. When spirit condenses and breath is regulated, suddenly one enters the edge of chaos, as if without foothold. This is when emptiness is extreme and stillness profound; this is also the place of establishing body and life. At this sudden awakening, the true face before birth appears, a complete taiji essence, showing that heaven, earth, and man have the same root and stem. Awakened thus, one uses the one point of prenatal original yang to control, operating the breathing spirit, gathering and returning, permitting not a single leak. In an instant the qi mechanism surges forth, and one feels the unity of heaven and earth's qi flowing through; here the foundation of nature is first complete, called the birth of nature's yang. Yet in postnatal terms, this is the appearance of nature's light; in prenatal great way terms, this is the birth of refined yang. The ancients say, "The great way is dark and obscure; taiji flows essence; the heart holds original transformation; qi moves in great harmony." This is what they mean. With this essence born, I only follow the natural breath, ceasing thought of spirit and will, collecting and releasing, releasing and collecting; this is taking the prenatal essence. Then this essence descends into the water palace, and the original spirit stirs the point of original qi fallen from the heaven palace, refining essence into qi. If the gate opens first and immediately descends to the water palace to refine, the medicine is tender and unfit for gathering. If the surging qi has long filled the surroundings, and the qi mechanism scatters, the medicine is old and unfit for gathering. Many scholars lack understanding here, and often burn and operate to no avail. From this essence entering qi, fire descends into water; then natural spirit breath is circulated from the yin foot to gather in the central palace, combining with refined essence in the middle, naturally water and fire become balanced, spirit and qi unite as one. It is necessary to know: “Always guard the medicine furnace and watch the fire, but be at peace with spirit and breath and let nature take its course,” and must not enquire further at the yin foot. This is an important instruction. When spirit and qi first combine, one feels misty qi rising from the bubbling spring point straight upward; long nurtured one feels qi throughout the body pressing to the heavens, this is precisely the time to operate the river cart. I then guide with intention, condensing without dispersing, like a fixed wooden center in a spinning wheel, steady and not swerving, yet the wheel turns without cease. But the body's qi originally flows unceasingly, why wait for man's guidance? Know that after birth, this gate is blocked and obstructed; if one does not understand and manage this, wandering thoughts and distractions enter, the yang qi that should rise does not rise, the yin qi that should descend does not descend; rising and descending become irregular, yin and yang lose order, heaven and earth fail to connect, and all things fail to be born, thus bringing about a dark and gloomy obstructed heaven. When reaching the topmost point of circulation, the extreme of return, this is the first birth of yin. Descending to the Yellow Court, returning to the furnace, sealed and firm, with no trace, as if before movement or refining. This constitutes one cycle. Here one nourishes again; if movement comes, again refine; stillness nourishes, movement refines, thus the cycle without end, establishing a firm foundation.

### III
The one mysterious gate is the prenatal primal unity qi’s mysterious gate, without sound or smell to touch, no visible form or aspect; this is the most supreme of supreme cultivation methods, penetrating heaven's secret. Since antiquity, few immortal children have at the outset attained to this state. Speaking of the mysterious gate, it is not limited to one end: when refining essence to transform qi, there is the mysterious gate of essence birth; when refining qi to transform spirit, there is the mysterious gate of qi movement. These places must also be understood. What is the mysterious gate of essence birth? At the outset of sitting in meditation, one concentrates spirit and regulates breath; at the moment of reverie, spirit is already condensed and breath already regulated; then a true essence is concealed in the yin foot’s one point. From chaos awakened, hastily one gathers the yin foot’s qi to the central yellow proper position, combining with the long-accumulated yin essence of the middle to be refined into one. Here too there is talk of tender and old medicine. What is tender? If not yet chaotic, then there is no medicine. If chaotic but unable to integrate spirit and qi, not blended into one, then taking from the yin foot is tender medicine and unfit to refine. If after awakening one cannot distinguish purity and promptly gather, then again another thought arises, after moving again moves outward; this is old medicine, even less fit to use. When qi yang is born, when is the medicine old or tender? From this essence birth, gathering and returning, combined with spirit fluid of the li palace, then spirit enters qi, qi surrounds spirit; at first spirit and qi are sometimes joined, sometimes separated, unable to unite as one—spirit is the spirit fire of the li palace, qi is the spirit water of the kan palace. At last spirit and qi blend into one, revolving in the dantian, lively and buoyant; my body’s spiritual qi and heaven and earth’s external yang qi unconsciously unite as one; this is the birth of qi yang, the phenomenon of the mysterious gate, so-called “heaven and earth unite to descend sweet dew,” the dew being the external spiritual yang qi. At this moment one must awake from chaos; this is purest water source, unstained by dust, taking from this is the refining of two parts fire with two parts new tender water, the medicine seedling newly born. It is also called “li sprays jade pistil, kan emits golden blossom,” the two families intermingling to form the elixir. Otherwise, without great stillness, there is no great settling. If not reaching the great intermingling of the mysterious gate, taking it is tender medicine. Once intermingled, if one delays taking, the newly born spiritual qi disperses, becoming old medicine unfit to use. I again reveal a shortcut: if able to reach complete chaos well, so much the better; if unable to reach chaos, then only keep one’s own continuous, dense, quiet illumination, reverie yet with form, obscure yet with knowledge, without one bright awakened thought, two two gathering, harmonious and undivided, again seeing my own qi and external qi, misty and vaporous, surging and vigorous, all over the body leaping and soft and joyful. This is exactly the right time; hasten to operate the river cart, great elixir is at hand.

### IV
The ancients say: “One gate, one mysterious gate, heaven and earth unite to form. Within is hidden the spirit qi cavity, inside are the refined essences of kan and li.” Before man is born, this original true qi hangs suspended in the great void, covering heaven and earth, utterly beyond grasp. When father essence and mother blood, two spirits, combine, this cauldron is set up; within, one gate is ready to receive the original true qi of heaven and earth; this is the gate within the gate, also called the wondrous gate within the gate. This is what the Buddhists call “the marvelous heart of nirvana,” Daoists call “the gate of the mysterious gate,” “the root of heaven and earth,” Confucians call “to perfect nature and preserve life, the gate of moral principle.” In sum, it is just this one marvelous gate. After birth, because of worldly dust and customs, this gate becomes clogged; this marvel is no longer known where it goes. Though sometimes the gate opens, it arises without will, appears without self-knowledge, manifesting like a new moon, exactly the true face of Tathagata; yet the dust roots and vulgar qi increase day by day, and in a moment vanish again to unknown place. So-called petty men cannot be without benevolence, but it is born and perishes in turn, without one glance fixed, without one hand firmly grasping the opportunity. I now reveal the truth: know that spirit and qi mixed in the dantian, with flowing, clear, and effortless mystery, is the discovery of the real form in the gate, the seed to transcend birth and death, escape the wheel of rebirth, become immortal and sage. Yet the first movement of true yang is very subtle, the qi still tender, utterly without trace to catch or grasp; how then will you employ it in practice? You must first refine your selfishness, making this heart roam the great void, qi penetrating the vast, hollow, boundless; only then is there skillful hand. For this gate is originally empty; with emptiness united to emptiness, this is like to like, easy to draw near. But if in this bodily gate you hold fixed and firm, not only will the mystery fail to appear, but the gate will soon be locked and blocked, impassable. For life to have vitality and liveliness in the gate, original spirit moving freely, one must first gather spirit and qi into one family, called “first establish the enclosure,” also called “establish the bag and flute.” What is enclosure? It is the gathering of spirit and qi, and also the establishment of furnace and cauldron. Only when furnace and cauldron stand, then slowly by yin-yang spirit-fire is cooked; suddenly spirit melts and qi flows freely, entering reverie and obscurity. This is when vitality enters the gate; also called the forgetfulness of the world. It is not the empty mingling of spirit and qi, but there is one point of pure spirit pill inside. The ancients said, “The heart is the pivot of all things, one must forget it and then seek it.” To forget is to forget the false heart; to seek is to seek the true heart. The true heart’s appearance comes only after forgetting. If you can distinguish clearly and attain this, why fear the real medicine not to be born, or the spiritual embryo not to form? This true transmission has been seldom revealed by ancient immortals. I consider the hardship of students seeking the way, hence I point out this secret, so that afterward there may be assurance. As for the first movement of true yang, there is great reliance on qi mechanism. Carelessly speaking of heaven, earth, and man, not knowing who is who, it is my five senses and hundred bones, here the misty vigorous movement within and without the body, like walking in clouds and sitting in emptiness, called forgetting forgetting. Yet forgetting forgetting cannot fully describe it; do not know whence this qi and spirit come, or where they are born; only feel the greatness of heaven and earth, the brightness of sun and moon, all insufficient to match its weight; I have a separate heaven and earth, two suns and moons, not the same as ordinary men’s. This is the obscure, mysterious true scene, also the special manifestation of vitality in one’s own mysterious gate. If in meditation you open this gate and see this wondrous appearance, this is the great manifestation of true yang, enabling operation of the river cart. Without this scene, I fear the elixir will have no true seed, wrongly operate water and fire, chasing yin qi to the detriment of yang qi, day by day seeing yang diminish and yin grow; at last all becomes a faction of yin evil selfish use, some knowing future events or seeing empty room light. The ignorant think they have the elixir and become saints; who knows that the human body is not yin then yang, not yang then yin; yin qi growing is not different from refining yang qi? When yang daily declines and yin daily advances, is this not like the growth of yang spirit, all by accumulation? Why? Before man cultivates, yin and yang are peaceful and yet separate; like both host and guest weak, neither able to contend; but after long accumulation, yin qi also forms its door; is this not a great qi mechanism, beyond human measure? I now describe the yin qi accumulated into a yin ghost, so that you know yin and yang differ only by a space, and you must be cautious in beginning. Yet this saying has never been told by ancient sages and immortals; I now risk the blame of disclosure, specially to point it out. You must keep tongue hidden and mouth closed, so as to respect teacher and way.

### V
There is no other marvel in refining the elixir than first to recognize your own original face. This original face, how could it be other? It is like the bright moon in the sky, round and full, neither veering nor leaning, illuminating all the nine provinces and myriad states; this is the prenatal true face, which is heart, which is nature; nature is Buddha, without difference. When the scholar in quietude suddenly feels my heart bright and clear, unattached and free, boundless and endless, yet really having nothing, this is the bright heart and seeing nature, truly attaining the prenatal face. But at first seeing this scene, one cannot but be startled and delighted, producing a postnatal ordinary heart; yet the prenatal primal spirit is scattered by this ordinary heart. Know you? I show one method: generally in sitting meditation, if there is a complete feeling of identity with heaven and earth, then further settle and calm; though thoughts arise, I altogether ignore them, so that the knowing heart, startling heart, joyful heart all vanish. Further, if you remain long in quiet, suddenly entering the great vehicle, though you see true nature and essence, it is only a glance, needing much adjustment and long nurturing, so that this heart and nature truly enter my meditation, restoring my old possessions, neither joy nor surprise. After long refining, one can return to the root and restore life. You who have already seen nature’s origin have not done so easily; have labored over ten years. From this quietness to stiller quietness, from concentration to deeper concentration, truly the body seems like a lazy man sitting on a couch, not caring to rise or move, not thinking of food or drink; naturally renewing day by day, the great medicine arises. Further, regulate your breath so that it flows in and out freely, naturally, without previous effort; then you enter the class of great awakening. The concern is that you all seek clothing and food, unable to avoid worldly turmoil; I did not earlier come to rescue you, fearing you would sink and not rise, casting away your former toil; that would be a great pity. Now continue to cultivate in this way, with resolute determination, needing not three or two years, only a few months to attain. Know you? Thus is the attainment of the Way, thus is the accomplishment of truth. It is not that attainment has a place, or accomplishment has a method. I earnestly desire that you travel a thousand li; only one li is lacking; do not fail to see home and turn back. Especially when you clearly glimpse home near at hand, I come early to point out, that you avoid retreat. Passing this gate only then counts as having the Way, else you remain an ordinary man.

### VI
I observe that you have not understood the principal way of quietness and establishment of the pole; hence I said before, “Internally conceal the celestial stem, externally push the dipper handle.” Conceal the celestial stem inside, but cannot push the dipper handle outside; push the dipper handle outside, but cannot conceal the celestial stem inside. Then you are busy and hurried, flurried and confused, the heart divided in two, without control. Is the way of alchemy so? If so, then the principal pole is not yet established, as if the world had no emperor to sit in state, with civil and military officers in disorder. The celestial stem is the principal pole; the dipper handle are the literary and military ministers obeying the emperor. Mencius said, “When there is one upright ruler, the state is settled.” Confucius said, “It is like the North Star standing in its place, and all the other stars revolve around it.” This shows the principal of quietness to establish the human pole. From this, the places of heaven and earth, the nurturing of myriad things, above and below flow with heaven and earth; how could it be otherwise? Nothing but the principal pole established and the qi mechanism flowing, naturally blending with heaven and earth and myriad things, attaining center and harmony; never pursuing external things beyond center and harmony. Confucius said, “What does heaven say? The four seasons run and all things grow.” Heaven merely establishes its principal pole, and the four seasons run and all things grow, listening only to the automatic creation. When man’s principal pole is established, yin and yang and creation move and rest by themselves, and the qi mechanism of heaven and earth and myriad things move and rest with it. Moreover, man originally communicates breath to breath with heaven and earth and myriad things. Zhu Xi said, “When my heart is upright, then heaven and earth’s heart is upright; when my qi is smooth, then myriad things’ qi is smooth.” Without moving a step or turning a thought, one has established oneself and established others by divine transformation! Because man’s temperament is confined and desires obstruct, it has long ceased to communicate with heaven and earth and myriad things. The ancients said, “Heaven and man have one principle, things and self have one source.” Men regard this as empty words, not knowing it is true. I now reveal again. When sitting in meditation at first, one must first nourish the spirit. Spirit is originally one with the great void, but must not be held fixed and firm. Spirit must first roam in the void, so that it may be purely nourished and spirit naturally returns to life. When spirit has condensed in the void, one must slowly gather and return it to the void cave, regulate and nurture it. When spirit has returned to life, then examine whether one has no thought and has reached extreme emptiness and stillness. If able to reach extreme emptiness and stillness, having nothing, this is the study of returning to the root and clarifying the source, and the principal pole is established. When the principal pole is established, using spirit to descend into the water palace, that is using spirit to enter the qi cavity, also using nature to seize emotion; like dragon marrying tiger, many such metaphors, all meaning that my one point of most spiritual, most holy, most clear, most empty original spirit descends to combine with lead of the water palace, like fire entering the water village; soon the fire steams the water to boil and true yang is born. The lower field belongs to yin and water; yin and water are cold in nature. The middle field, the red palace, belongs to yang and fire; fire and yang are hot in nature. Therefore the upper half of the human body is heaven and yang, the lower half earth and yin; without spirit fire to cook, the water is cold and the metal cold, sinking and unable to rise; the more the man is dull, the more the darkness grows. When I say spirit entering qi, it is the way of mating water and fire. When water and fire unite, the misty qi surges and arises, then metal is born in water; also called lead producing silver; also called yin producing yang; all these are metaphors for man’s life’s root, truly the root of longevity and immortality. At this time, spirit is settled, breath is regulated, body and heart are refreshed and pleased, buoyant as if soaring above the nine heavens, roaming the vast region without knowing its end. This is spirit as one with the great void, qi communicating with heaven, earth, and myriad things; indeed one does not know why. This is the principal pole established, surely there is no concealment of the celestial stem within but dipper handle not pushed without, nor push dipper handle without but celestial stem not concealed within. You must know that before the principal pole is established, it is fine to slowly condense spirit to combine with qi. When qi and spirit are harmonious, then into the obscure and hazy region, transformation produces lead. If lead is produced, when the time comes and work begins, mechanism moves and spirit follows, lightly lifting, silently operating, a lump of great harmonious qi moving up and down like a boat going with the river. This suffices to prove spirit and qi have gathered, transforming the three origins into one origin, uniting the five qi into one qi, thus establishing the principal pole and enabling the path of immortals to be cultivated. Have you also come to enlightenment? My master said, “Postnatal is prenatal,” what does this mean? Postnatal means all spirit, all qi, all essence, all blood; these are the fleshly lump. To cultivate the golden elixir with them is utterly useless. At the outset, concentrate spirit in the void, combine qi in the vast. This void and vastness are the prenatal within the postnatal. I tell you plainly, though sitting meditation does not depart from the material dantian and eye light and heart light, mouth and nose breathing, yet it must be lively and vigorous to return the jade liquid elixir. Why call it jade liquid? Because the seven substances of the human body—tears, saliva, essence, qi, blood, fluids—all are necessary to nurture the illusory body. Yet within the body, form, substance, sound and colour are all a mass of yin qi, that is the so-called stinking skin bag. Only when cultivating from the physical body that point which is empty and non-existent, spiritual and refined, can one attain the prenatal within the postnatal. Do not hold fast to the dantian, fix your gaze and watch with the mind. Only that emptiness which seems to have and not to have, neither urgent nor slow, about to depart, can obtain the true medicine. The Supreme One says, “The valley spirit never dies, it is called mysterious female.” These words already exhaust the way of the mysterious gate. What means the valley spirit never dies? The valley is emptiness, the spirit is spirit, never dying means never darkening; it means for man to refine the great way, one must recognize the emptiness and spirit never darkening as the elixir base. Yet formless and shapeless, cannot be grasped; thus it is said, “To have the valley spirit long not dying, one must rely on the mysterious female to establish the foundation.” Why must the valley spirit rely on the mysterious female? Because the true ruler of emptiness and spirit must form a shape in the mysterious female; yet this is really the infinite. If the mysterious female does not stand, the embryonic breath is not formed; whence then comes the original endlessly living mechanism? So long as ordinary breath pauses, the embryonic breath appears; one opening and closing, in this is the mysterious subtle mechanism; all man’s perceptive awareness arise from this; man’s thought, knowledge, nature, temperament, soul, and spirit all come from this; to attain truth and become sage, all begin with this one movement and one stillness establishing the foundation. For stillness has no form, movement has form; stillness is not the root of heaven and earth, movement is not the root of man and things; only in this going out and coming in truly lies the mysterious female’s gate. Yet form is because of the shape of postnatal yin and yang; form produces the one point of prenatal true qi. This true qi, though prenatal within postnatal, compared with original qi, is still a postnatal thing. This original qi is not truly real, still but an infinity. Yet heaven and earth are created and people born from this one gate. This is probably the utmost emptiness giving birth to utmost reality, utmost non-existence giving birth to utmost existence. In sum, confusion and non-appearance are not difficult; only after one awakening to stand and guard without a single other thought—that is difficult. Know you?

### VII
Man’s heart was originally empty, alive, thoroughly illuminating without remainder; only because of birth of the body, a hundred worries affect the heart, myriad things weary the form; there is movement within, surely shaking the essence; if essence is insufficient then qi is insufficient, and spirit also is not lively. The ancients likened man’s essence to oil, qi to fire, spirit’s spirit to the lamp’s light shining forth and ungraspable. Therefore I teach you the study of refining the heart, beginning with enriching precious essence and abundant qi. Moreover, if this heart is empty, the spirit is spirited; if essence is sufficient, qi naturally flourishes; not waiting for future consummation of merit and elixir, there is already the wise light of illumination now; also able to shine through the entanglements of private desire and the bonds of love. The trouble is that man’s heart is busy and chasing; the moment a bright thought appears, not a moment passes before it is again immersed in the armor of desire. Now for livelihood, you must resolutely hold your eyebrows high, firmly establish your will; hang high the precious mirror of your body, hang the sword of wisdom, and naturally clarity will be in yourself, spirit and will like a god. Then heaven’s reason and human desire will naturally be distinguished clearly. Heaven’s reason is heaven’s reason, arousing and able to rise, not permitting human desire to interfere; human desire is human desire, washed and clean, not allowing heaven’s reason to be violated. In sum, the effect appears in a moment or two; the work must await three years and nine years, and the power is all in nurturing my wise light and forging my wise sword. Yet the wise light cannot be seen; the ancients say, “In heaven it is sun and moon; in man it is the two eyes,” clear and manifest. You must in daily life collect and gather the divine light of the eyes, reflect it back into the dantian and sea of qi; after long time, in the void cave naturally the wise light appears, like a bright mirror hanging high, reflecting all things. The wise sword is also not to be known; the ancients say, “In heaven it is wind and thunder; in man it is spirit and qi.” Only because spirit is not condensed and qi not gathered, its edge is not sharp. Knowing this is not good conduct, harming essence and qi, yet cannot cut it with one stroke, striking it down at once; knowing yet doing. Looking about my school, mostly so; lamentable indeed! Alas! I loudly call again: restrain lust to strengthen essence, speak little to nurture qi, regulate eating and drinking, reduce taste; idle thoughts and miscellaneous worries not concerning the subtlety of our body, heart, nature, and life—all must be discarded and not advanced, guarded against with utmost effort. Thus postnatal essence and qi easily arise, and prenatal essence and qi naturally support. When prenatal essence and qi are full and round, the body naturally strengthens day by day, and the wise sword is formed. Observing you during daytime sitting, I see no strong bright essence; all because in daily concentration and breath gathering there is little effort, and many interruptions. If you can in walking, standing, sitting, and lying maintain spirit without drowsiness, breath without loss, then all previous temperament, nature, and private desire will be swept clean; after long time you will see a spirit bright and piercing, illuminating the sky; no matter voices, goods, fortune, loss, calamity, or life and death, none can lodge in your heart to disturb your heavenly ruler, so that your bright heart is not bright, your strong one not strong. This need not await many years to succeed; only one heart inwardly illuminating, not permitting even a thread of external dust to disturb the spirit palace, even in a moment you will see the effect of alertness and nimble hand. Know you that heart’s unspiritfulness arises from spirit’s unclearness; clearing temperament and nature must have a resolute and strong qi to do it. Qi’s weakness arises from breath not gathered; to preserve true essence requires full measure of fire. Thus continually look inward, illuminate everywhere; day and night turn and revolve; heaven and earth so can be overturned. As for external attachments or insults, at sight you know; idle thoughts and worries, at ear they are clear; not fearing other fire’s blazing and steaming, unstoppable, can extinguish once and for all with inconceivable effect.

### VIII
Scholars condense spirit and nourish quietly, striving to suppress and transform the dark clouds of heaven and earth within themselves; then they occupy the place of heaven and earth, nurture myriad things, supplement the deficiencies of heaven and earth, and repair the lacks of creation; this is not a difficult matter. But why do men regard heaven and earth as so vast, thinking creation’s power is from the Lord of Heaven; men cannot do anything, yet do not consider that ancient sages often said heaven, earth, and man are three talents. Man indeed relies on heaven for life, yet heaven relies on man for standing. If there were no perfect man to share creation’s power and assist heaven and earth’s transformation, then heaven and earth would again become chaotic heaven and earth, unable to bear infinite birth. Even the common man possesses some of this help; it is not only lofty and strange saints who can undertake it. Why? When man’s heart is upright, then heaven and earth’s heart is upright; when man’s qi is smooth, then heaven and earth’s qi is smooth. Though the response between heaven and man is subtle and wonderful, its use is in one movement, one stillness, one word, one silence. For heaven and man are originally one qi communicating; one moves, the other moves; one is still, the other is still; one is safe, the other is safe; one is in peril, the other is in peril; all depends on the subtle breath, not on deep or far-reaching matters. Only trouble is unwillingness to lessen desire and clear the heart, to reveal the clear and vast heaven within. If one can not be careless in one thought, then one thought is the place of heaven; if one breath is not false, then one breath is the foundation of heaven. Attaining the natural state, then I am heaven, heaven is I; not only this, I can embrace and contain heaven and earth, nurture and transform heaven and earth; I am not cast by heaven and earth, but heaven and earth are cut and formed by me. The sage who knows I am heaven, how is it in the blue sky or boundless outside? It is probably in one moment of inward reflection that one penetrates its subtlety. Others’ cultivation of the Way, there is also the top grade elixir method, using spirit to enter the void, not attaching to form, not attaching to emptiness, forgetting both emptiness and form, after long time all is melted and fused, even the two words void and nothing are not used; this is what Zhuangzi calls “the highest spirit riding light.” The Buddha Muni’s text also uses this true emptiness and marvelous existence to become Buddha; later men rarely understand this. Chan Hehezi says, “The Tathagata cultivates nature not life”; not knowing that this light contains spirit and qi, taiji yet without limit, no form yet having form, no sound yet having sound, and is the root of spirit and qi’s arising. Thus refining this one light is perfect and complete; how could it be as the postnatal spirit and qi still divided into yin and yang? This truth later men find difficult to understand, no wonder they fall into one-sided cultivation of nature. As for mountain spirits and water monsters, they can run in mist and fly in air; yet their nature is not complete, mostly drifting toward mechanical method, and inevitably suffer heavenly punishment. What need is there to cultivate them? What Zhuangzi calls “lower spirits riding essence.” Thus unclean and impure spirits condensed in postnatal essence gate, long refined, can also enter concentration, also can go out spirit; but are merely a filthy ghost; even if called long life, merely guarding a corpse ghost, utterly without spiritual communication and transformation, and without benevolence, righteousness, and morality; though possessing strange skill and power, are but clever ghosts of essence. You should copy the highest method.

This year all grains grow fresh, none do not say this year is a great autumn. Yet within the utmost beauty, there is the imperfect. How is it that heaven does not bestow perfect blessing? Because heaven and earth’s way is that when yang is extreme, yin is born; when yin is extreme, yang is born; the principle of yin and yang overcoming each other is thus. Otherwise, fullness at extreme is hard to continue. Only a gentleman with clear understanding and wisdom of the subtle can at the time of abundance have the wonderful policy of holding fullness and preserving peace. Without understanding, the foolish often at the time of abundance rely on their wealth, not knowing to bear humility, but rather keeping pride in their heart. Such men, who can be without ruin? The way of the household is so; the way of governing a state is no different. Extending this to the wise policy of self-preservation, this should be the standard. I see that though you are old in years, your spirit is still strong; if you do not seize this opportunity to diligently cultivate and in all places maintain, I fear that under great yang the autumn yin will follow. Great Yu cherished every moment only because life is not constant. You must be cautious. Though I have heard the marvelous secret, I have not yet truly tasted the Way; I must strive and apply effort to reach the natural state. Else half up half down, you will never see the original true face. Moreover though old, you still take no heed in daily affairs; clothes, food, and dwelling come from the palace with ease; body is safe and sound; children and grandchildren flourish; household and family all joyful and peaceful; everywhere is a place of ease and abundant autumn; just right to pursue my pleasure, to delve into the great way. Moreover, you have good roots and long standing virtue; you are not without merit to receive divine immortal blessing and wisdom; how can your cultivation fail to advance, obstructed by demons? Seize now the leisure and lack of affairs, without external worries, without internal sickness; if not now learning, then when? The sun and moon pass, the years do not wait for me. Alas, old age! Whose fault? I suppose your good mind to seek the way arises from utmost sincerity; why then daily practice without great progress? This is because of frequent interruptions. Like cooking food: at first put into the cauldron, must use fierce fire to cook and boil; after a while use gentle fire to nurture. Thus cooking, only then true flavor arises. If at first there are interruptions, then half raw and half cooked, no flavor at all. As for the talk of martial fire, it is not teaching to exert force with gritted teeth; only to rouse spirit; throughout the twelve hours of the day, often raise and awaken, fully illuminating the void cave. Most regrettable is that during the day you have leisure and spirit, but do not use it to preserve essence and refine qi; instead you use it for idle reading, idle talk, idle business, idle thought; thus placing useful spirit on useless things. Alas! Truly to be lamented! Even saying your years are old, spirit and qi weakened, unable to hear the way in youth, yet gaining it late in life, even with full vigor, fearing unable to become great awakened golden immortal; this is mistaken thinking. Know this: where there is will, success follows; Heaven will not disappoint the diligent. From ancient times to now, how many have attained the way in youth? Looking upon ancient immortals, none but attained the way late in life, at over a hundred years certifying golden immortal. Fear only lack of will to advance; if truly willful, how would heaven spirits abandon you? Because your merits increase, your nature is not confused, long loved by divine heavens. Suppose this life does not succeed, today you have planted the seed; in the next life the cause and effect will naturally not cease. I wish you from now on to establish fixed course, to vow not to meddle in idle matters, not read idle books; only to condense spirit in the void, combine qi in the vast as constant; one day in walking, standing, sitting, or lying, always attending, not permitting one breath to be indulgent, one thought to wander. Thus after half a month, naturally effects will be seen. When qi mechanism slightly moves, quickly prepare the river cart. Why? At first taking the subtle yang, after long time essence full and qi strong and true yang born, great form and appearance can be verified. At this state, what joy is greater? Speaking of man before birth, in the great void he is originally one with heaven. When born, in childhood he is still pure and radiant, vast and unceasingly flowing with heaven’s qi mechanism, thoroughly communicating. Because knowledge opens, the confused body is broken and incomplete, so the vast unbounded quantity turns into depressed and melancholy heart, dull and confused; even inside the body unable to hold fast, how much less the outside matters? Their response is subtle and unstable; is there anything not discouraged? Zhu Xi said, “Within there is no two, no change.” This heart is silent and unmoving, considered the root of responding to myriad changes; externally orderly and solemn, awe-inspiring, always like facing the divine; guarding the heavenly ruler; after long application naturally alert and aware, bright and not dark, sitting illuminating without remainder; then why fear things’ disturbance? The heart is like a bell; empty, strike it and it answers; full, strike it and it is not spirited. If man can hang this heart on the surface of the great void, not generating opinions, purely heaven’s reason acting, then he has attained.

The scholar who wishes to return to the root and restore the source must begin with postnatal nature and life. The burden of postnatal temperament and the private desires must be eliminated and cleansed, then true nature and true life appear. What are true nature and true life? The unbroken flowing and unobstructed spirit of heart is true nature. The lively and unblocked qi mechanism is true life. All is nothing but spirit and qi. The original spirit and original qi are one thing; common spirit and common qi are the same thing, only differing in name, not in substance. The ancient Buddha said, “In the realm of ordinary men, consciousness is strong and wisdom weak, hence called consciousness nature; in the realm of sages, wisdom is strong and consciousness weak, hence called right awakening.” You must take right awakening, not consciousness spirit, then your beginning is correct. Also heard the ancients say, “The heart originally has no knowledge; because of consciousness it knows. Nature originally has no life; because of consciousness it has life.” Life means death, knowledge means confusion; birth and death, knowledge and confusion, are seeds of man’s bodily reincarnation, all made by postnatal consciousness spirit, not original spirit. The original spirit is truly void but not empty, marvelously existent but not existent; thus it coexists with heaven and earth. If you do not know that original spirit is serene and eternal, always bright, yet suspect it is empty and unattached, and thus take the bright and luminous thing in your chest as original spirit, forcibly restraining it so that it does not move, binding it so that it is not spirited—this is like using thief to catch thief, creating more division and error, like wild apes and unruly horses hard to tame. This all arises from taking and refining postnatal consciousness nature. Jingcen said, “Dao learners do not understand truth only because they identify consciousness spirit at the outset.” One thought’s difference sinks you to the level of beasts; can you not be cautious? Zhu Xi said, “When human desires are cleansed, heaven’s reason flows.” Spirit has no breath unrelaxed; qi has no breath stagnant; these subtle marvelous heavenly mechanisms you can surely discern. Yet none more important than Confucius’ words, “Joy is therein,” “Joy to forget sorrow,” Zisi’s words, “Act according to your station,” “When entering, do not fail to enter.” Only by following heaven and moving naturally, acting according to nature, conforming to heaven. If one has knowledge, calculation, and artificial contrivance, that is neither nature nor heaven, but man’s falsehood; though all day talking of mysteries and laws, never forgetting sitting work for a breath, this is no better than not learning. Moreover, making falsehood confuse truth, only seeing heart weariness and daily exhaustion, is worse than not learning and still having one thread of true nature. Therefore I teach you first to recognize your original face, this empty and boundless, vast and infinite, joy beyond description, one thing. Yet your original source is not clearly revealed, no great manifestations. If you can empty all, not a single thought remaining, during sitting not needing even one incense stick’s length, you will naturally glimpse ground and return light, transcend things, and your own body and heart will feel transformed. But you busy with affairs of family and livelihood, day and night calculating wealth and fields and possessions; thus entering to see virtue and delighting, going out to see pomp and delighting, muddled and reluctant to let go; hence years of study with no great progress, only because heaven’s reason and human desire are separated. I who live seek heavenly immortals, must renounce worldly wealth. Only those who do not covet wealth are not greedy; only those not greedy are true Dao vessels. Man’s heart, apart from wealth, has no other root of greed. If you can break this copper wall, leap over this confusion barrier, your heart will be cold as ice, qi flowing like spring, nature empty as mirror, spirit tranquil as abyss; then say is not the great way here? Moreover, what ordinary men like and what sages dislike is the burden of heart nature and obstacle of virtue and morality; the ancients likened it to illness. If man can rid these illnesses, then heaven’s truth is seen. Moreover cultivation of self is in man, attainment of Dao is in heaven. If able to lightly regard wealth and profit, do good works, heavenly spirits naturally rejoice and protect. Hence it is said, “Money can communicate with spirits.” Not that spirits truly love wealth, but because man has the capacity to bear the Dao, thus can transcend the mundane and enter the sage; because of lightly regarding wealth, spirits love him all the more, hence the saying of communication. Have you all seen through this?

When a learner at first sits in meditation, heart and spirit are not clear, qi mechanism not smooth, like heaven and earth just opened, chaos begun, myriad things without form, all fresh phenomena. Only with one thought concentrated do my spirit and qi gather in the mysterious one gate; like the lord of heaven and earth established therein. At this one breath exhaled, like the light pure qi of heaven and earth ascending; one breath inhaled, like the heavy turbid qi of heaven and earth descending; I only commit will to emptiness and non-being; principal pole is established. As for yin and yang rising and falling, I only follow their natural up and down movement; when true power accumulates long, it surges fiercely with unstoppable extreme. Yet at this yang flourishing time, one must know to hold fullness and preserve peace, return to root and origin; else under great yang there will be great yin; to form a pure yang body is difficult. Hence Shao Zi said, “Fine wine is best drunk slightly intoxicated; good flowers are best seen half open.” Who but those who know the way can understand? I observe that when you have qi mechanism flourishing and spirit clear, yet often you let fire blaze and smoke rise, not knowing to return to the original beginning; thus venting too freely, the vitality is cut off. Hence the Supreme says, “To hold and fill is not as good as to stop.” These words are truly a law. Regarding guarding and waiting, the ancients say, “True man hides in deep abyss, floating and roaming guarding the middle.” Thus observing this gate, strictly guarding the middle, not for a moment, true yang naturally emerges from emptiness; this body stands like a wall; intention like cold ashes; then qi mechanism mists and surges, yang produces child; this is the time to operate the river cart. The refining of essence before is the two waiting periods gathering Mu Ni; this yang birth is the four waiting periods operating the river cart; each has its own scene, cannot be mistaken. I further instruct on quiet sitting cultivation, known to all; but many people are confused about cultivation in motion. Like Mencius’ nurturing of vast qi, it arises from gathering righteousness. But the way of gathering righteousness is broad, not only in quietness but also in motion. For example, when Mencius suddenly saw a child about to fall in a well, he had compassion; is this not righteousness? Extending this, respecting the old and venerating the worthy, helping men and benefiting things, resolving difficulties and settling disputes, is this not righteousness? Also seeing others’ goodness and rejoicing, seeing others’ evil and being ashamed, all is righteousness. To say compassion is benevolence, shame and dislike is righteousness, humility and respect is ritual, right and wrong, likes and dislikes is wisdom. These four beginnings arise subtly; many overlook them, even you often miss them. Even if known, only recognize good love, which is your nature; when they stir, few know how to take them into the dantian. Now I reveal this to you: from now on, all daily arise of joy, anger, sorrow, and pleasure are the true mechanism’s movement; I must gather and nurture them, return light and reflect enough. In sum, when the four beginnings arise initially without thought and action, that is true; with thought and action, that is false. One day within you, these four beginnings arise countless times. If you can seize these mechanisms, take and receive them, nurture and use them, truly everywhere is gold, all over is gold and jade; nowhere is not a place to refine elixir, no time is not a sign of medicine birth. Hence it is said, “The great way is sought among men, taken from among the like.” Therefore the ancients cultivated the Way hidden in the market and city, not dwelling in wilderness and valleys; for the Way is among human relations and daily use, not in deep mountains and desolate valleys. If able to know in time and take in time, then in the dusty world there is always the Way’s mechanism arising, and everywhere is cultivation work; only trouble is man does not return but seeks afar.

### XII
Today drought prevails, grain seedlings about to wither, seeming as if all people in the world have no way to live. Not knowing that in the utmost evil there is the utmost good, in the day of great calamity there is great auspiciousness. If you know this principle, just cultivate yourselves; all blessings and curses, good and evil, reward and retribution from above, listen to heaven, and you will be free from many idle thoughts, worries, and vexations! For if heaven wishes this, who dares waste? If heaven wishes death, who dares live? This is surely heaven’s governance, which man cannot interfere with. Only by exhausting human efforts and awaiting heaven is what man can do. Otherwise the power of creation will not rest in its proper allotment; man’s heart will grow more confused, and heaven’s heart cannot rest, hastening the calamity’s coming. This is the way of heaven and man in one; you surely understand this, so I will not elaborate. Only wish you henceforth cultivate virtue, to communicate without hindrance with heaven and earth; naturally aligning with heaven’s heart, even in a year of famine, there will be abundant favor and deep mercy. Also cultivation values continuity, density, non-duality, and unceasingness, reaching the realm of divine transformation; not valuing haste and urgency. Mencius said, “Those who advance rapidly must retreat quickly.” Moreover, a pressing heart is common fire; not only useless but brings the danger of self-burning. The so-called neither fast nor slow, neither forgetting nor helping is natural true fire. Heaven and earth produce myriad things; sages nurture myriad people; all do not depart from this gentle spirit fire; how much less cultivation then! Always value constant clear illumination, not losing the mechanism. I see your work often intermittent, so you try to build your hall but go out the door; try to descend to the chamber but retreat to the hall; not going straight forward, having no retreat; this is the cause. The ancients say, “Hide spirit in the heart, hide qi in the body,” always not letting go; that is life returning and root restored, the elixir of long life attained. But how to make spirit and qi hidden in body and heart, always maintaining thus? The method lies in when the mysterious gate opens, taiji stirs; yin and yang separate and expand; advancing when time comes, stopping when time comes. Why? When the mysterious gate first opens, only the li palace original nature is seen; therefore called “birth of nature’s yang.” Yet this is the spirit’s accidental movement, not the true movement of qi; only by spirit fire slowly warming can it be nourished, listening to the qi mechanism up and down moving within, hidden in the central yellow proper position; this is the method of guarding the middle, water and fire balanced, kan and li joined, also called the forward short path, the two waiting periods gathering Mu Ni. When spirit fire descends, water sees fire and naturally becomes one qi, misty and vaporous, rising and surging; this is when metal is born at the bottom of water, the ancients say “time of yang producing child,” also called “birth of life.” If there is this movement of qi mechanism, not necessarily filling all body within and without with surging qi; even roughly seeing qi mechanism, truly entering water village from spirit fire below, is the joining of kan and li producing medicine, also the first stirring of subtle yang; also must diligently take and operate river cart, settle spirit in the mud ball. So-called replenishing brain and restoring essence, the way of longevity lies here. Man desires longevity, except for guarding middle and river cart methods, there is no other way to accumulate essence and gather qi. Though guarding the middle fire is only gentle in lead cauldron, only river cart reverse operation has the four directions zi, wu, mao, you, with literary and martial distinctions. If able to always nurture, so that my original spirit always dwells in the heart, original qi always hidden in the body, though death comes, how could it take me? By spirit and qi mating, never losing. You must in walking, standing, sitting, and lying, no matter busy or idle, thinking or not, with tea and food, always gather spirit in the heart and collect qi in the body; after long time spirit and qi meld, no past or ancient known, no present or now, no heaven above or earth below, no self inside or others outside. Such is no other than immortal. Recently looking at you, when your work reaches this, there will be unusual signs; I now reveal. Whenever strange color or fragrant scent appears, whether seen by eye, smelled by nose, or heard by ear, do not heed. Or heart flowers suddenly arise, able to know past and future all good and evil; you must gather original spirit and sit guard the central court. Though occasionally revealed naturally, one thought arises immediately, without thinking able to foresee good and evil; this too is consciousness spirit acting; do not give rise to joy in your heart; if joy arises, even if not entering demon path, also fear self-trusting cleverness, leading outer matters to whirl about, halting cultivation. Do not know that appearances arise mostly from your own root habit being led by consciousness spirit; I altogether ignore them, hoping that with no mind the visions will vanish. This is the important task in recent times; must not envy appearances and fall into demon path, recklessly discussing good and evil; these all arise from your own qi and habit, not original spirit and qi; cannot be trusted as the Way.

Zisi said, “The beginning lies with the couple.” What couple is this? Is it like later Confucians say, “Within the inner chamber, solemn as the court; intercourse knows propriety, contact knows the Way. This one rule extended and filled suffices to transform family, state, and world without difficulty.” To say this of the Way is to belittle it, unable to fill and flow as broadly as to cover heaven and earth; because it has form and trace, acts and deeds, it can be limited. How could it be the great Way! This couple is but the one heaven and one earth within the human body, one kan and one li only. In sum, it is water and fire, spirit and qi, also nature and life. Nature and life united is the return to taiji. From this taiji one movement and one stillness, one yin and one yang, nowhere not following heaven. Using this to cultivate self, there is no one not cultivated; using this to govern the world, there is no world not governed. All is spirit and qi returning to truth, returning to the one lump of great harmony qi first born, always held in embrace. If only worldly couples are meant, even if respectful and courteous, fear they cannot transform family, govern state, change customs and fashions, until everywhere and always harmonizing with man and heaven as one! The sage fears to reveal heavenly secrets, unwilling to utter in a single mouthful, must wait until one has accumulated merit and cultivated conduct, the heart truly without flaw, the proper relations fulfilled; then revealing heavenly secret will not be falsely transmitted. You who work to here, surely truly understand the words of the beginning couple; not external couple, but couple within man’s body. If you truly begin work, constantly remember the word beginning couple; at first using spirit to enter qi; that is ordinary father with ordinary mother. When father and mother unite, true lead is born, true yang arises. The yang lead born here issues from kan; yang is the spiritual father. When the qi mechanism grows strong, clashes and force arise, from the empty dangerous gate fire starts, ascending to the mud ball; I then condense spirit in the mud ball, warming yin essence; thus the spiritual father pairs with the holy mother, yang lead with yin mercury, yang qi controlling yin essence; this is spiritual father and holy mother uniting to produce medicine. The medicine is nothing else than long accumulated yin essence in the mud ball, baked by spirit fire, transformed into sweet dew divine water; this is spiritual fluid. From the spiritual fluid descending, the spiritual nature and knowledge in the heart arise; so-called qi transforms into fluid. Then introduced into the dantian, heaven and earth again combine; spirit fire warms and cooks once more; spiritual fluid again transforms into true qi; long circulated in river cart, repeatedly refined, repeatedly burned. The qi transformed from spiritual fluid is the prenatal original one qi. From this one movement, external medicine is born; from the kun furnace fire arises, ascending to qian head as cauldron, descending to kun belly as furnace. Furnace fire rises, cauldron cooks medicine. From this one movement and one stillness, not missing its time, it is like stubborn metal long baked, more refined more pure; so-called hundred times refined diamond turns to softness winding around a finger. Thus gathering external medicine to form internal elixir, after long time external elixir is complete, internal elixir also follows. In sum, external elixir values hardness, then wood carries metal to act, fire presses water upward. Otherwise, metal sinking does not rise, water cold does not boil. Internal elixir values softness; if not soft elixir does not form, and original spirit also finds it hard to sit and watch freely. This is qian hardness and kun softness, that is Zisi’s “beginning couple” Way. If man begins from one yin and one yang, neither attaching to purity and non-action, nor clinging to name and form and acts, within a hundred days the foundation can be established.

### XIV
The great Way originally has no marvels, only to perfect our original nature. How can original nature have any thing? It is only the natural heaven. But why do many know and few attain? Because from birth man is confined by blood and qi selfishness, then confused by emotions and desires, so to seek the control and seeing of nature is especially difficult. Yet it is not difficult; if man can always know wrong and seek right, this heart is bright and clear, utterly without one thing between; Buddhism calls this “no good no evil, alone seeing the empty and hollow, thoroughly bright true ruler,” that is the Way. How is this difficult! The Book says, “Forgetting thoughts is madness; conquering thoughts is saintliness.” This is only a matter of reverence; nature then returns to truth, Way returns to root. You surely know this; I will not add more. But thinking of the birth of true nature, only in a moment, but at the moment of stirring, confused and muddled, without dregs, without thought or worry, few recognize the true saint or immortal. Though some recognize, yet at this first budding moment, it is like clothes long stained with oil; unless fully washed, cannot be removed in a day. Yan Zi attained one good, thus had work of earnest earnest remembrance. You have already understood one thought returning light; one thought is the Way; thought after thought returns to root, thought after thought is true. The first need is a firm and enduring heart, only then able to reach clear and pure, alone seeing true meaning. Yet one thought illuminated is an easy matter. I observe today’s cultivators: at this one thought’s beginning, the land is pure and complete, round and full; yet either doubting whether it is the Way, adding one intention, adding one view, mixing them; thus true nature is obscured. If you can recognize the movement of this one thought as the matter of my becoming immortal and saint, that is the ineffable marvel of the three pure ones; how could there be another method? Only from this one thought’s accidental stirring, day by day accumulating. But at beginning, the nature’s spontaneous movement, qi mechanism’s accidental stirring, is only slightly manifest, not greatly appearing; my teaching calls this small medicine birth, also called first movement of one yang. When passing the barrier, taking food and nurturing, though dantian fire heats, kidneys brew, eyes have golden light, mouth has strange flavor, ears have eagle cries, brain has qi rising, six kinds of effects, yet no form attached to postnatal form corpse qi to make it manifest; it is not the great robust qi of vast and mighty filling between the two greats. This is a mere illusory form; all is my spirit’s perception, my spirit’s knowing, not for outsiders to glimpse. My teaching calls this true yang great movement, also called great medicine arising. Because it is truly manifest, called true yang; because its qi mechanism is great, not like previous slight movement, called great medicine. You recognizing this is not mistaken in moving common fire, nor going astray, nor being harmed by postnatal corpse filth qi. To take prenatal to supplement postnatal, what taking or supplementing is there? Only one movement of yang, not rashly moving, not leaking outside; over long time one qi steams; the steaming qi is also medicine, and also fire; outside and inside, below and above, reverse and gather—this is taking. Gather this to the cauldron, this is supplementing. Fire is medicine, medicine is fire; fire and medicine are two yet one. Man knowing the one great harmonious qi without a speck of idle thought, only seeing emptiness and bright, vast without outside, small without inside, subtle qi mechanism seeming to be and not to be, seeming not to be and not not to be, this is the Way. With this one qi steaming, that is medicine. Gathering and restraining this spirit and qi, not permitting mixed and half-understood, then it is supplementing. From ancient times immortals have cultivated from this; indeed cultivators cannot neglect it. Also, breathing is the key to refining medicine and alchemy. Without this internal breath, how can true gold at water’s bottom rise from below inside? All depends on this spirit breath forcing and urging it, ascending to the mud ball. When spirit and qi mate, descend to yellow court, warm and nurture elixir, all is done by spirit breath. Therefore the ancients said spirit breath is the external fire. Though cultivators have natural true fire, they especially must rely on external fire to draw and add literary and martial, increase and decrease and use; only then medicine arises naturally, elixir formation may be expected. Without external furnace fire adjusting literary and martial, though natural true fire is void and penetrating, it can only understand nature, not establish life. These two fires, inner and outer, are fires of nature and life. If man has inner fire but no outer fire, then nature has no attachment to life, life no attachment to nature; this is called solitary yin not born, solitary yang not long. Lüzu said, “Believe in death in pure quietness; solitary yang is hard to ascend.” Hence inner fire and inner elixir wholly depend on outer elixir and outer fire to refine and form. Spirit breath is the key way of cultivation. You know inner and outer fire’s way, yet I observe you have not fully understood external fire’s reverse use. In fact, common breath and true breath, both are one and the same. Without prenatal spirit breath, common breath is without master; without postnatal common breath, true breath cannot arise. But if one reverses creation and turns inward cultivation upside down, then the golden elixir returns inward; this is an important statement.

The reason man is foreknowing and afterknowing, bright and not dark, is nothing but this one illuminating heart. Buddha calls it “long bright lamp,” Dao calls it “mysterious gate cavity,” Confucians call it “void spirit mansion.” All are in no thought and no worry, no good and no evil, one illuminating spirit. At beginning do not seek to bring out things from void and infinity; else there is no nature, no elixir base. Without growing from void and non-being a spiritual illuminating marvelous spirit penetrating inside and outside, there is no master. Without a master, though striving day and night, will be confused all day, in the end useless. You must first lay down all attachments, simply cast away deluded consciousness and private desires; slowly stir wind and move fire; bake and transform in the land of no where; inwardly reflect, truly without stain or attachment, empty and vast, not knowing its beginning or end; this is nature seen. When nature is seen, you need a conscious heart, illuminating yet not illuminating, not illuminating yet illuminating; this is the perpetual master. The ancients called it the lord. With this master, elixir can be formed; without it, it is like a house without master, how can it be established? This lord is truly the master and commander of elixir refining. As for nature, it is the head of the elixir refining. But at first, wanting nature to appear, confusion and boundlessness, vast and limitless, cannot be attained. Only need to be calm and at ease, heart cool and clear, some interest. If you want clear and bright, vast and deep, great without outside, small without inside, only when the fire is ripe does this vast misty ungraspable sign appear. So long as not touched by worldly attachments, pushed away and let go, that is nature seen; elixir has a base. At beginning, this heart may not subdue and illuminate like spirit. Only need this heart to not run about, not be confused, able to be my home master, not to be taken away by outside things; that is this heart always present, master for my elixir refining. You now are still at the intersection of yin and yang, still must establish resolve, support true yang, suppress many yin; long after yang wishes to advance but cannot rush; yin wishes to retreat but will not rush; so there is drunken and stupefied appearance. Because though yang can govern, yin has not yet yielded. Therefore I teach you not to forcibly remove thoughts and block breath too strictly; tightness causes stirring of postnatal yin qi, certainly cannot last long. In sum, the marvel and unpredictability of spirits and immortals is not other than this one point of emptiness and stillness, spirit responding and spirit ruling! When idle, do not seek turmoil and vastness; only this one thought empty and still, never mind second thought; that is nature present. Ancients gather and release, release and gather; that is nature seen many times. Long use of effort, naturally native nature is always round, nowhere not present and nowhere not absent. Only need this heart always illuminating; slight idle thoughts and worries, if I can always be aware, that is alertness always present. Since ancient times immortals have been made by this one point of illuminating heart; do not lightly regard this illumination. I consider you sincere in seeking the way; now I will explain the origin of the Way, the use of effort, so as to avoid darkness of heart nature, thus can speak of elixir.

My master has taught here for more than ten years; now at the gate peach and plum branches all compete in bloom, truly my hardship is not in vain. Among disciples there are differences; some have attained great understanding of the root source of the great Way, leapt out of the dusty world, risen to the clear and pure mansion; my master therefore comes and goes, never weary. Their deep study gains results everywhere, flowing freely, at ease and content; how can it be compared to depression and sorrow? Though you heap gold on the north star, have high fame in the eastern land, you have never a moment of quiet leisure; this world is not worth attachment! Moreover, busy all day and night, incessant and unceasing, how can you long enjoy glory and wealth, and keep long life? This would be enough. Yet time flies like an arrow, sun and moon like a shuttle; in a moment black hair turns white, youth becomes old age, swiftly the prime cannot await; once impermanence comes, all is cast away; is it not wasting spirit, laboring breath and strength in vain? Even speaking of founding an enterprise and passing it on, supporting descendants, enduring bright smoke for ten thousand generations, must not fail to plan; yet there is also going with the current, letting come and go; I only wish to steer the helm, why bother with myriad affairs, pouring all spirit on family, children, fields, houses, money and goods, unwilling to rest? Suppose one day going west, nothing remains; would this not be a pity? The ancients say, “In the black lacquer coffin, wealth cannot hold even a bit; on the road to yellow springs, wife and children belong to whom?” Is this not fearful? Moreover there are those who in life commit evil, making great sins; having founded family and established business, yet after death their souls burn in the hall of hell, suffer in the prison of hell, while descendants enjoy endless glory; ancestors trapped in muddy torment, who will devise means to free them? The suffering is borne by me, the blessing enjoyed by them; planning in vain, is it worth it? Moreover, there are unworthy descendants, not thinking of the hardships ancestors took to establish the family for ten thousand years; they gamble and smoke, boast and flaunt, indulge in flowers and wine, still wishing to burn paper money; when the hall mildly warns, they resent the annoyance and refuse to face them; sometimes spoiled by indulgence, suddenly insult them, dare to be enemy to parents, stand against them. The common saying is, “All children under the knees become enemies,” truly not false words. From this consider, you plan for descendants; descendants already so, is it worth it? Further, harshly managing family, the way is short-lived; common saying, “Old man’s money is a string, son turns it to furnace.” No matter how much gold is piled like a mountain, how many fields possessed, once in descendants’ hands, all dissipated; is it not a wasted family plan, empty worry? Moreover, manifest retribution: ancestors buy land, accounts not yet clear, descendants sell it; ancestors build houses, work not yet done, suddenly belonging to others. The Book says, “It seems he is dead, others enter the house,” also says, “The magpie has a nest, the dove dwells in it.” After death no news, that is done; if seen now, is it not sorrow upon sorrow? Knowing this, you know the many needs of clothing and food in the world; each man has his fate; cannot painfully plan and cause trouble. Not to say plans fail, even if desires are fulfilled, that is fate; even if not sought, can be attained. Seeing thus, how is it better to act according to heaven’s reason, all things according to human feelings, content and keeping to one’s place? Moreover, heaven’s decree surpasses man, yet man can also surpass heaven; rather than gain by unrighteousness and incur heaven’s punishment, better to do much good and excel before heaven. If man can treasure only good, and man’s heart aligns with heaven’s heart, would heaven fail to protect life? Doing good brings auspiciousness, surely not wrong. Today in leisure I speak again for you. All things in the world, in the end, come to nothing. Only the cultivation of nature and life jointly is my ten-thousand-year immortal work. Do not say worldly wealth and honor cannot be compared to clear and free ease; even what is presently enjoyed and daily needed is all heavy and turbid; how like heavenly frost, red snow, peaches of immortality, fine wine; all fragrant. One clear and one turbid, how distant? Moreover, needs are few and enjoyment not much; why hold on tightly, staining my bright spirit to be filthy and shameful; is it not betraying heart and effort? Alas! Today’s world is dark and not bright, confused and not awakened, until unbreakable; so severe. Moreover, many knowingly offend; so many also. Alas! Truly lamentable! I before showed you the way to nourish right qi and dispel guest qi, truly a good remedy for the common, a heavenly cure. Why? Those who will not turn back are one, ignorant of morality; two, soft in essence and qi. If you know this is marvelous, not exchanged for a single speck by other things, yet you drag on, unable to sever karmic ties, rushing to the ninth heaven, how much less outsiders! For now, you must first will, nurture spirit, and let thorns fill the way; not hard to cut it in two, reason and desire often divided. Mencius’ teaching of nurturing qi is rich and repeated, not fearing trouble. If you can resolutely persist, not fearing thousands of hardships and difficulties, soon you will build the place of pure emptiness. Recently you are in the battle between heaven and man, reason and desire contend; if not striving hard in one battle, in the end it is clam and clam, hard to win. Seize this opportunity, just a dozen or so days, nurture heaven’s reason purely, utterly dispel guest qi, all desires perish; thus heavenly virtue flows, going nowhere but naturally attained. You who have talent and insight, courage and capacity, rather than apply them to useless place, how much better to use them in the great Way! You must strive, I earnestly hope.

The whole path of true cultivation requires first understanding sequence. When entering the gate, a wild heart like a rogue, like a wild horse or mad ape, is hard to restrain; if forced to submit, surely evil fire is received, not only is vitality not smooth, but true qi scorched by evil fire; if not sickness, then vitality is scattered. The ancients say, “Refining lead in the dusty world.” One must in the world respond to affairs if there are affairs; if none, then nourish heart; after long time penetrate red dust, open the net of evil, heart becomes tranquil, spirit becomes clear. If only chasing dust and waves, surely more polluted and deep, until nature and life are lost. Only with everywhere raising and awakening, not sparing hardship, not weary, can spirit and qi unite as one. Yet some ignorant men do not speak of inner virtue and outer merit; either because affairs do not go well or family cannot be told, they want to cast aside human relations and enter the mountain to cultivate. Such men, full of filth and evil fire, their harm to body and mind is not small! I in earlier years did not abandon my master, with an empty heart consulted the master, already taught you to accumulate yin merit, little pursuit of dust realm; when at leisure in the day, sit and contemplate mystery. But your dusty feelings are too heavy, name and profit entangle, children and love hard to sever; daily busy and rushing, unaware falling into name and profit shackles. Do you know that birth and death is fate, wealth and honor determined by heaven? Do you now believe this? As for your preaching and speaking of law, I am unable. Only the wise do not speak, and those who speak do not know. Your words are like Confucius obtaining the supreme teaching: “Your words are as though your person and bones are rotten, only your words remain.” The ancients say, “Talking a thousand things, not equal to doing a little.” But if you want to attain the great Way, your heart’s desires are all empty shells, utterly useless; better to start low and go high, from shallow to deep. Mencius said, “Seeking the Way near but searching afar, matters easy but seeking difficulty.” You should be cautious. Moreover spirit though strong, years advanced; if not diligent in cultivation, I fear lead and mercury daily diminish; another day when you sit to collect the heart, even that will be impossible. As for your recent work, only in stillness refining life, in movement nurturing nature; do not hasten seeking deep mountains. “Awaken the True” says, “I urge you to cultivate without entering mountains; inside and outside mountain is no lead; this supreme treasure is in every family; only the foolish do not know it fully.” Will you believe? As for your wisdom and awakening, it is not attained in one kalpa, all from past life cultivation; truly carriers of the Way. Moreover, my school disciples, few can reach your great Way. Sadly, knowing ten zhang is not equal to accomplishing one inch; really succeeding in work benefiting body and mind is rare. I now reveal to you: what you understand is to others truly form without form; to you, a great great demon; if not all blocked, I fear daily practice deepens, self-pleasing and delighting, all heart and blood wasted on this memory demon. My master never speaks of length or shortness, ranks or grades; only considers seeking great Way, laboring years; to this day only one phrase, no different from today’s Buddhist shouting and cleverness. Alas, a spirit wasted on memory and learning. Yet you have this wisdom and awakening; with it advancing the Way is not obstructed, accomplishing the Way is not difficult; not like others’ confusion and wandering, not knowing the great road. So I do not abandon you, and speak plainly to warn. You say your will is to accumulate merit and practice benevolence, yet you also know to establish merit and virtue is not by seeking others to establish. The common saying is, “Those with fate meet, those without fate miss.” The sage’s way is the middle way. The middle way is only to follow nature. If you must establish merit, going everywhere to do so, that is self good producing trouble, not the sage’s way. From ancient times many immortals have closed doors and not gone out for life’s end; yet by one word or deed, immediately ascend to heaven; this shows merit is not in quantity but in one heart. If one can have heart always on the Way, above and below flowing with heaven and earth, you can know the reason. What I say today, every word is a golden needle; you must embody it.

I see when you have yang birth and advance fire, you do not yet understand the real law of Yi’s Zhen and Meng. Meng hexagram has kan above as medicine, because yang is born from kan; zhen below is fire, because one yang below zhen is the advancing fire. When you meet yang birth, no matter how qi mechanism moves, simply with slight true intention descend to the tailbone; that original one qi, formerly moving smoothly, do not let it move smoothly, but intend upwards; then the common smooth path is blocked. When the smooth path is blocked and no road to go, naturally the qi mechanism rises upward, from below upwards, surely to the mud ball; this is natural; no need to guide then rise and ascend. What then is the meaning of evening Meng? Meng, kan water below, with one yang in the middle, medicine is below. Gen mountain above, with one yang above; yang is the retreating sign; the sign is yang qi rising to mud ball, warming a while, transforming to sweet dew divine water; truly all transformed by yang, not truly belonging to yin. When work reaches here, essence transforms to qi, qi transforms to elixir; it is fitting to follow the smooth path, not to act like the vigorous fire of advancing yang; thus called yin sign. In sum, medicine faces the palace above, mud ball qi full and spirit of medicine, having a clear cool and quiet appearance; yang qi rising to head and eyes; fitting time to retreat yin sign. At this time need not guide it to descend; but use spirit to master the mud ball, intend towards the high heaven; naturally descending step by step to red palace, warming a while, guiding into dantian, merging with qi to become one, united as a lump. At this time neither advancing nor retreating, none going out nor coming in, quietly awaiting the message; then again circulate the whole cycle. Scholars do not regard this as strange. Speaking of the beginning of yang birth, qi mechanism is tender; must be like Mencius said, “the morning qi” as the most fitting. Then draw lead and mercury, gradually gathering and refining, more solid and firm; then must be like Mencius said, “Its qi is great and firm, nourishing it straight without harm, then it fills space between heaven and earth” as the best discourse. The ancient immortal also said, “I have one thing, supporting heaven above and earth below,” is it not Mencius’ great and vast qi filling space between? Also said, “What are qin and sword?” It is that the utmost yang qi contains utmost yin; if scholar clings to one yang qi only, he cannot form elixir. The sword means hardness; yet also add qin, meaning hardness with softness, strong and harmonious. Yet at the outset you must know hardness and softness, strong and gentle, only then no error. When water and fire are balanced, metal and wood combined, hardness is not hard, softness is not soft; at the state of full ripeness, one no longer knows hardness and softness, only follows the flow of qi mechanism naturally. You fear only not sitting long, impatient. If able to endure long sitting, in one or two months great spirit effect. Not only can common breath stop, true breath be seen; surely there is utmost true medicine, unique spirit, revealing mechanism, so that you ascend above the heavens, descend to boundlessness, utterly forget heaven and earth, man and self. The medicine is one qi, the elixir is refined accumulation of this one qi. Only fear you do not accumulate essence and gather qi, so that at last sinking and drifting, wandering through birth and death, turning and returning, endlessly. If you set your heart and daily keep alert, daily progress, first fully penetrating the root source, knowing external things are illusions, long after not only external things are void, even the body is false; I do not mind it; life and death let be; no looking back or hesitating. The ancients viewed death as returning home, placing themselves in knives, saws, cauldrons without fear; not that they did not fear death, only that they saw the principle clearly, believed destiny settled, held true constant Way without losing it. Otherwise, even eating and drinking and speaking and acting, still contending without end, how much less life and death, how could they cast aside and not care? This means truly attained, and false not attached. I wish you now gather dispersed spirit and qi, now accumulate into one family, cook and refine; after long time naturally harmonize and condense, forming one qi, no different from heaven’s void. Thus ending dust attachments and birth and death, never falling into love and desire sea. In sum, spirit and qi dispersed and separated into two belongs to common man; life and death, suffering and pleasure, beasts and grass and trees, all unknown changes. If able to return to one qi, fused with no gap, long refined to truth, then diamond body unbreakable; allow heaven and earth to decay, but my nature not decay; sun and moon to wane, but my life not wane. You must know what you engage in.

The ancients say, “The Way is before the eyes,” meaning there is nowhere in heaven and earth that is not the Way. What is the Way? It is clear empty one qi, circulating heaven and earth, filling qian and kun; no man is not in creation, no man is not in the great Way. Therefore the ancients say, “Within and without the human body, nowhere is not the Way.” The Way is vast and deep, truly immeasurable. Yet it circulates in the great void without ceasing only because of too heavy clouds, imprisoning and hiding original qi; thus drought and flood and other calamities occur. In the human body it is also always manifest, filling inside and outside; but temperament and nature stir, private desires arise; the righteous qi cannot resist the evil qi; thus sounds, colors, goods, and profits are all man’s false works. The cultivator must expel these external seductions and return to original goodness; after long elimination, one sees the clear empty one qi circulating inside and outside the gate. Not to say the lust for wine, women, wealth, and qi does not allow a little to remain inside; even one’s own corpse qi and spirit soul cannot be mixed in. For clear and turbid do not associate; evil and right do not coexist. Why do men not abandon worldly attachments, ties of love, lust for fame and profit? Because temperament and nature block the chest; thus the clear and vast heaven does not appear; one must make suffering into joy, take thief as son, all year round and month to month never releasing. Therefore the original qi of ordinary men is seen to diminish day by day, diminish to exhaustion and death; thus falling into hell, transforming into insects and grass and trees, suffering calamities, thinking that Yama king drives them; I think they walk into their own net. Why? Losing conscience daily, utterly without vitality; then no life qi; even if king of the underworld wills their birth, is this not rushing to death? Only the sage knows the principle of life and birth; the foundation of my becoming immortal and Buddha, the root of enjoying blessing and reward; only refining one flavor of original qi, daily steaming, everywhere nurturing; after long time dregs gone and clear light comes, penetrating the original utmost good heaven, never allowing dust to stain to defile nature heaven. Have you recently seen this scene? If not yet attained pure true joy, you must follow the waves and waves, seeking temporary worldly happiness; like not obtaining fine food, even coarse food is tasty; if obtained essence, then the Way’s flavor is strong and the world’s flavor faint; great harmony original qi always embraced. I wish your sun and moon not to violate, movement and stillness without interval; do not fail to guard yourself; let not all dust attachments and entangled love disturb; cultivate for a hundred years, still an ordinary man, cannot escape suffering of reincarnation; this is pity. If you can preserve and nourish original, cook and refine true qi, within a month also great effect. Effect is nothing but true joy. Man can obtain true joy, then false joy cannot endure. Confucius said of the Way only the word “joy.” I see you recently have attained in heart, already knowing external things are dust and dirt; adding strength to maintain, almost able to cast off dust and burden, sweep clean, transcend the mundane and enter the sage; yet if you do not respect teacher and Way, establish virtue and merit, how can you quickly reach this? From now on you must respect my Way, only then will there be great transcendence day. Know that only with former merit is nature heaven seen; after elixir formed, you must open your eyes widely, help men and save the world as your heart; only then can you accomplish great awakening golden immortal. Otherwise, a mere immortal child is not the ultimate intention of my teaching and deep hope. You should strive earnestly.

Heaven and earth is an empty shell, containing one lump of original qi, generating myriad things, only following its qi mechanism; confusion and muddle, unknowing and unknowable, thus lasting a hundred million years without decay. Human body contains a portion of misty qi; why not as lasting as heaven and earth? Because seven emotions and six desires daily wear down, prenatal original qi is blocked and hidden by postnatal common qi, much wasted; hence there is birth, old age, sickness, death, and suffering. Only heaven’s qi moves all things unevenly; not without sun and moon would this be possible. Sun and moon are the functions of heaven and earth; thus one comes and one goes, cold and heat alternate and form the year. Man’s qi mechanism’s movement, acting as myriad kinds, assisting heaven and earth, cannot stand without embryonic breath. Thus heaven and earth is man’s city wall; sun and moon is man’s embryonic breath. Heaven and earth’s yin and yang going back and forth form creation; all is sun and moon’s movement within. If man can imitate heaven and earth, circulating spirit breath within, continuous and dense, quiet and alert, he can also endure long without limit, standing with heaven and earth. “Awaken the True” says, “Set furnace and establish cauldron as heaven and earth; refine essence and make po and hun.” Also says, “First make heaven and earth into pot and vessel; then gather black rabbit medicine to cook.” Black rabbit medicine is the yin in li and yang in kan. True yin and true yang combine and transform into essence qi, that is medicine; able to subdue the postnatal hun and po spirits, making them confused and muddled, returning to taiji. Immortal great medicine is this one flavor. In sum, there is medicine of nature, medicine of life. What is medicine born in nature? That vague thing in reverie, but must not come from outside nothing to being. Confucius said, “Joy is therein.” If one guards the center, if there is a little joy, then the medicine seedling is tender, just right to gather and take. What is medicine of life? That is essence in darkness; this essence’s movement has great evidence: dantian has a misty appearance, activity mechanism, or throughout body flowing, vast and full; truly without hole not piercing, without gate not reaching; this is life’s yang birth. At first scholars take it, need not be so vigorous; only need the body unable to stretch to have some stretching mechanism; heart without anything to delight in, only need some pleasure; then can take. All things have vitality when young and tender; old and strong have less vitality; hence alchemists take the tender not the old; old qi disperses unfit to use. If truly get new tender medicine qi, naturally old sicknesses quietly vanish. The Supreme says, “Its essence is very true, within there is trust.” Thus essence born and medicine produced, truly effective. If say trust is utmost, vast as tide surging, melting as ice thawing, still is a rough layer of appearance. Only when get true essence and true medicine, within empty yet able to respond, responsive yet truly empty, just like heaven and earth know not beginning or end, sun and moon have no interruption, its emptiness is utmost infinity, its measure is beyond reckoning, so-called uniting virtue with heaven and earth, shining with sun and moon. Strive hard. The breath mechanism calls for stillness and few desires, calming spirit, enough to match heaven and earth.

### XXI
I show you: to attain the Way’s marvel, you must be chaotic and muddled, still and yet still, only then is the taiji lump before birth of parents. This confusion is the primordial qi before division of chaos, the original qi before heaven and earth’s judgment. Human body inherits qi and forms shape, sensing infinite truth, combining and condensing the two and five essences, the way of qian producing male, the way of kun producing female; this is the four great unseparated and five elements unformed, a lump of complete confusion original qi. Man has this then he lives; without it he dies. This is the first marvelous mechanism of cultivation, cannot not speak of it. Yet in confusion, no master, falling into stubborn emptiness, causing darkness. The cultivator when mixing five elements into one qi must make original spirit the master; then dao qi constantly condenses and golden elixir can be refined. Is this far? One thought immediately seen, opening eyes immediately clear, not limited by time or place, encountering the usual and the change, all have dao qi present; only afraid not willing to be still. Before it arises, not returning light and reflecting, protecting the silent scentless spirit source; when it arises, not willing one qi to condense spirit, holding and preserving the unknown heavenly virtue; thus before arising, one is confused and like asleep; how can one be calm and serene in the midst? After arising, one is bright and likes to move; cannot harmonize the middle and rhythm. Thus following qi as one pleases, following desires’ confusion, completely hides original confusion body, destroys and vanishes. Alas! Life principle is gone, where is life vitality? Wanting not to fall into ox intestines and horse belly, birds and beasts, grass and trees, is impossible! This is the Way present in human body, always present and nowhere not so. Only need one original spirit always illuminating, to preserve inherent heaven; that is cultivating the Way, refining elixir. Yet the Way of perfect center and harmony often wasted because of entangled troubles. In non-cultivators it matters not. Often entering Way door, saying cultivating, often having seen the Way source in quiet place, constantly condensing dao flavor; but when affairs come, heart is disturbed, Way no longer present—many thus. This is only knowing the Way in stillness, not knowing no matter where moving is the Way; thus stillness preserved and movement scattered. I think you sincerely seek the Way; I reveal the heavenly mechanism in movement, so you know all is the Way, nowhere not the heavenly flowers scattering. Therefore it is said, “Meeting the heart now and ancient near, looking out the earth and heaven is wide.” Only when man understands this Way can he attain use in daily hundreds of things; at first struggling to hold on, after long time birds and fishes, flowers and birds, nowhere is not a mechanism of transformation. Why? The ancients said, “In dangerous places with soldiers and horses, in small things with oil, salt, firewood, and rice; knowing the Way, nowhere is not a Way mechanism.” Like meeting parents then filial, meeting brothers then respectful; no thought before, no memory after, arising from heart; not knowing if it is filial or fraternal,
