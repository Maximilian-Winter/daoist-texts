# The Practice of Cultivation Fails Before Temptation; the Heart and Will Retreat, and in the End a Tragic Death

This is a lamentable story of a cultivator of the Way in the Song dynasty. The principal personage was originally a high official at court; but, being pressed by Qin Hui, he retired to the mountains to practise Taoism, and made considerable progress. Yet when Qin Hui died, he could not resist the urging of his family to return to official life. The frivolities of the world and manifold temptations caused his cultivation to be lost; and in the end he died a lamentable death.

Chen Yuancheng (named Jue), an attendant official, was a native of Minzhong. By nature and disposition he delighted in the Tao. In the reign of Song Gaozong, in the Shaoxing era (1131-1162), Chen Yuancheng often followed Han Qi-wang as a confidential adviser, assisting him in the duties of a pacifying commissioner. Afterwards, Prime Minister Qin (Hui) disliked him, and for many years left him unused. Disappointed with official life, he ceased his ambitions; and at the southern part of Da Mao Peak in Jurong County (namely the summit of Maoshan Peak), he built a thatched hut for cultivation. He entirely excluded his wife and concubines. He built an octagonal (bagua) terrace, and in the mornings and evenings bowed and worshipped the stars. In leisure hours he practised retaining the spirit and inner observation (methods of Taoist cultivation), living quietly and simply, with a tranquil mind and few desires; and he purchased several dozen acres of land at the foot of the mountain to provide sustenance for wandering cultivators who did not labour in the world of men.

Every year in the second month of spring was the birthday of the Great Mao Lord (the founding ancestor of Maoshan). Officials, common people, and Taoist adherents from all quarters assembled, thronging together. On the mountain there were in all seventeen temples and monasteries, with offerings and sacrifices without a vacant seat. Only at the Yuanfu Wanning Palace to the north of the mountain (still existing) was the incense fire most abundant. Chen Yuancheng went daily to pay his respects. One day he met a guest of tall and slender figure, blue eyes with square pupils, an appearance graceful and upright, clad in oak-leaf garments, holding an octagonal fan. The guest stopped his way and asked Chen Yuancheng for money. Chen took from his bamboo box a single Chongning copper coin and gave it to him. The guest received it with pleasure, but soon said, ‘You have given me money; I cannot accept it without returning something.’ He then gave back the money just given by Chen Yuancheng. Chen was astonished and looked, and there were two coins. When he looked again for the guest, he was gone. On returning to his hut and taking out the money to examine it, he found them all to be gold coins! He was still more amazed.

That night he dreamed of the man coming to tell him, ‘I am Lü Dongbin. Because you have the form of an immortal, I played a jest on you. Though your aspiration to learn the Tao is earnest, your power to benefit all things is not yet manifest; strive on!’ In the dream Lü Dongbin taught Chen Yuancheng methods of breath control, refining the truth, and flying talismans for curing diseases (Taoist arts); and promised that they would meet again in thirty years.

When Chen Yuancheng awoke, he absolutely ceased to eat flesh or drink wine, and practised the orthodox method of the heavenly mind. When people met with strange evil and disasters, having his talisman-water they were immediately healed. He also performed rituals of fasting and sacrifice for others, with many verifications and efficacies. Having dwelt in the mountain for many years, Chen Yuancheng moved lightly and swiftly; Taoists and common folk alike revered and respected him.

After the death of Qin Hui, those in power at court were old acquaintances of Chen Yuancheng, and urged him to return to official life. At first he obstinately refused, but at length yielded to the persistent requests of nephews and younger kinsfolk, and returned home to be in a state of ‘serving the ancestral temple’ (receiving salary without office). Liu Xinshu was appointed commissioner over Jianghuai, and recommended him as a consulting officer; soon he became prefect of several prefectures; and finally restored to his original rank. His Taoist heart grew more and more lax, and his mastery of methods no longer worked.

In his old age he kept many concubines, his back bent and his gait feeble, deaf and dim of sight; he was vastly changed from the time of his mountain cultivation. Once when bathing, with burning charcoal beside him, he seemed to see a divine spirit rebuking him; he then fell into the fire, half his body was burnt to a scab, and he died. 

His grandson-in-law was called Li Xun, who in the last year of Shaoxi of Song Guangzong’s reign (the last year of Shaoxi was 1194) served as county clerk of Jurong, and told others of these matters concerning Chen Yuancheng. The narrator of the story was Yu Zhongqing, named Jisi.

Chen Yuancheng, attendant official (named Jue), a native of Minzhong, by nature inclined to the Tao. In the Shaoxing period he often followed Han Qi-wang as a pacifying commissioner’s adviser. Afterwards, disliked by Prime Minister Qin, he was secluded for several years, and then gave up official ambitions, building a thatched hut south of the Da Mao Peak in Jurong. He dismissed his wives and concubines. He built an octagonal terrace, and worshipped the stars morning and evening. In leisure he practised retaining the spirit and inner observation, living quietly, simply, and with few desires. He purchased several dozen acres at the foot of the mountain to support the wandering cultivators.

Each year in the second month of spring was the birthday of the Great Mao Lord; officials, common people, and Taoist adherents assembled from all directions. In all there were seventeen temples on the mountain, with offerings and sacrifices never vacant; only at the Yuanfu Wanning Palace in the north was incense most abundant. Chen went daily to pay respects, where he met a guest, tall and slender, blue eyes with square pupils, graceful and upright in bearing, clad in oak-leaf garments, holding an eight-cornered fan, blocking the way to seek alms. Chen gave a Chongning copper coin from his bamboo box. The guest accepted it gladly, but then said, ‘You have given me money; I cannot take it without returning something.’ He gave the coin back to Chen. Chen was astonished to see two coins; looking back, the guest was gone. Returning to his hut and examining the money, all were gold coins. He was greatly amazed.

That night he dreamed of the man who said, ‘I am Lü Dongbin. Because you have immortal form, I jested with you. Though your zeal in learning the Tao is keen, your power to benefit all things is not yet manifest; strive on.’ He taught breath control, refining truth, flying talismans to cure diseases, and promised to meet again in thirty years. Chen awoke, ceased eating meat and drinking wine, and practised the orthodox heavenly mind method. When strange evil and calamity appeared, those receiving his talisman-water were healed immediately. He performed fasting and sacrificial rites with many verifications. Dwelling many years in the mountain, he moved swiftly and lightly; Taoists and common folk all revered him.

After Qin’s death, those in power urged his return; at first he obstinately refused, but yielded to nephews’ entreaties, and returned to serve ancestral rites at home. Liu Xinshu, commissioner over Jianghuai, recommended him as adviser; soon he became prefect of several prefectures; and finally restored to original office. His Taoist heart grew lax, and his arts ceased to work.

In old age he kept concubines, bent and feeble, deaf and dim-eyed, unlike former days. Once bathing, with burning charcoal nearby, he seemed to see a god rebuking him, and fell into the fire, half his body burnt, and he died. His grandson-in-law Li Xun, in the last year of Shaoxi (1194), was county clerk of Jurong, and told the story. (The above three matters related by Yu Zhongqing, named Jisi.)

This is one among many stories of ‘Lü Dongbin’ collected by the great Song scholar Hong Mai in his Yi Jian Zhi, in which the Immortal Lü displayed his miracles. It appears that Lü also failed in guiding men: this Chen Yuancheng was deeply attracted by the worldly pleasures of wealth, beauty, fame, and food, and, though once a good cultivator, could not escape. This shows that his cultivation was conditional; originally an official at court, forced to the mountains by exclusion, when Qin Hui died the cause for coming down was present. This circumstance provokes the reflection: the dusty world is indeed a great place for the Way.
