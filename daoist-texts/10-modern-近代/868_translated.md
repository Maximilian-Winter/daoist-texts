# The Barber of the Song Seeking Immortality

In the early years of the Zhenghe reign (the first year of Zhenghe being 1111), in Chengdu there was a barber, a man who plied the trade of tweezing. Day after day he was busy in the market, while his wife remained alone at home. One day, a Daoist came, his hair tied up in a topknot; he asked the barber’s wife to pluck the hair from his face, first giving her two hundred cash. The wife thanked him, saying, “It will not take much time; ten cash will be enough.” The Daoist said, “Take the money first, and pluck my beard slowly; do not find it troublesome.” So he sat down.

She first shaved the left side of his face, then the right; when finished, she returned to the left side, and found the beard there had already grown thick again, so she plucked it once more; then the right side again grew likewise. Thus she went back and forth many times; yet the Daoist’s beard continued to grow without ceasing. The day passed midday; the wife, overcome with weariness and vexation, returned the two hundred cash and ceased plucking, dismissing him.

When the husband returned, his wife told him all that had happened that day. He, hearing it, was somewhat vexed and said, “This must surely be Master Zhongli; why did you drive him away? Even if I had to pluck his beard until the morrow, what harm would there be? That I have not met an immortal is my fate!” So the barber ran wildly about the streets, calling out, “Master Zhongli! Why have you forsaken me and gone elsewhere?” Thus day and night, regardless of hunger, thirst, cold, or heat, he cared not; so it went on for three or four years. The barber searched through all the surrounding counties of Chengdu, even in the mountain wilds.

One day he met a woodcutter. The man laid down the burden he carried and asked the barber, “What is your business?” The barber told him the cause. The woodcutter said, “You speak of a divine immortal; if he comes seeking you that is well; but you, toiling all your days on the road, what profit is there? Though I am but a foolish woodcutter, I have heard that to attain the Way one must accumulate hidden virtues and perform great good, and must not rely on luck alone. I possess a secret method which I can teach you; if you take my method to aid your cultivation, and persevere through the passage of years, perchance you may succeed in your wish.” He casually plucked a blade of grass from the roadside and blew upon it; the blade of grass at once became a golden hairpin! He said to the barber, “Try using my method; it will be beneficial to you.” The barber said, “These are all illusions and arts unworthy of learning; what I desire is only to see Master Zhongli!” The woodcutter said, “You have not yet seen the man you speak of; when you meet him, how will you know it is he?” The barber said, “I have asked my wife and know his appearance; I have already drawn his likeness and placed it in my sleeve.” The woodcutter said, “Then do you worship me thrice, and I will enable you to see the ‘Master’ you speak of!”

The barber immediately performed the worship. After the first bow, he rose, and the woodcutter asked, “What do you think of my face?” The barber said, “It is as I saw before.” He bowed a second time; the woodcutter again asked the same; the barber bowed a third time, and then looked again; the woodcutter’s countenance had changed, and resembled the figure in the picture of the Master which he carried, without the slightest difference! The woodcutter said, “You are truly a sincere seeker of the Way; you have wailed and searched for Master Zhongli these many years, your voice ringing through the clouds and sky. The Jade Emperor also deeply pities your unwavering resolve, and so has sent me by a devious means to awaken you. Come with me.” So the barber followed the “woodcutter” into the mountains.

Two years later, the barber returned to his homeland, and after bidding farewell to those he knew, departed. Until now, he has not come forth from the mountains.

At the beginning of Zhenghe, in Chengdu there was a barber, who went forth daily to the market; his wife lived alone. A Daoist with a topknot came, seeking to have the hair plucked from his face, and first gave two hundred cash. The wife declined, saying, “It will not take much time; ten cash is enough.” He said, “Take it, and patiently pluck for me.” So he sat down.

First she shaved his left side, then the right; when finished, she returned to the left, but the hair was already thick again, so she plucked it again; the right side likewise grew anew. Thus three times or more. The day passed noon, the wife could not endure weariness and annoyance, returned the money, and dismissed him. The husband returned, told all in detail; he was vexed, saying, “This must be Master Zhongli; why did you refuse him? Even if I plucked his beard from today to tomorrow, what fear? My not meeting him is fate.” Immediately he ran wildly in the market, calling, “Master, why have you forsaken me?” Night and day, hunger and thirst, cold and heat all disregarded; so for three or four years he traveled over distant counties, even into the mountains.

He met a woodcutter who set down his burden and asked, “What is your business?” He told the cause. The woodcutter said, “This is a divine immortal; if he comes seeking you that is well, but you now, toiling your whole life, what benefit? Though I am very foolish, I have heard that those who attain the Way must accumulate hidden merits and great conduct, and cannot rely on chance. I have a secret art to teach you; if you use it to aid your Way, and apply it over years, perhaps you will fulfill your wish.” He plucked a blade of grass, blew on it, and it became a golden hairpin. He said, “Try using my method; it will help.” The barber said, “These are illusions, not to be learned; my wish is only to see the Master.” The woodcutter said, “You have not seen him; when you meet him, how will you know?” He said, “I asked my wife and know his appearance; I have drawn his image and placed it in my sleeve.” The woodcutter said, “Then worship me thrice; I will let you see your ‘Master’!” The barber worshipped. After bowing once, he rose; the woodcutter asked, “How do I look?” He said, “As before.” Again he bowed and was asked; again the same. At the third bow, he looked, and the woodcutter’s visage was changed, matching the picture of the Master. He said, “You are a truly sincere seeker; you have wailed and searched for years, your voice reaching the heavens. The Emperor also pities your steadfast mind, and so sent me to awaken you. Follow me.” So he entered the mountains with the woodcutter.

Two years later he returned home, bade farewell to acquaintances, and left; since then he has not come forth.

A single unchanging thought is aspiration; a single unchanging aspiration is a devoted heart.

Here is a conjecture: some will say, “Who does not wish to become an immortal? It is not so easily done.” Well, such words reveal your dread of difficulty; and what does dread of difficulty show? That you lack confidence; to say plainly, you lack determination; fundamentally, your pursuit of your wish is not steadfast, that is, not devout.

Once I met a Daoist brother, and asked him why he cultivated the Way. He said, “To ascend and become an immortal.” I said, “What if you fail?” He said, “Then let me die on this path.” Where there is purpose, one knows Penglai is near; without action, it seems ever so far. Only with such determination is there true devotion.

Yesterday I saw a reporter interviewing Elon Musk. When asked, “If your rocket explodes, will you give up?” he said, “Never give up, unless I die.”

I take this writing to urge all to examine what your heart’s wish truly is; you may also perceive the “sound and breath” within yourself, which necessarily corresponds and seeks out the same channel.
