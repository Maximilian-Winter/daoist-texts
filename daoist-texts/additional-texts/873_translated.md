# Random Notes of Qingyang: The Secret of Consecrating Divine Images

In this world there is a strange phenomenon, that all the chief religions of the world dislike the making of images of their gods, and all hold that the true gods have no form.

For example, the Roman Catholic Church, Christianity, and Islam all hold that no idol should be worshipped, that God has no form, and that any form in the world is a false god.

In early Buddhism also it was forbidden to make images of the Buddha; it was only about five hundred years after the Buddha’s passing that images of the Buddha gradually appeared. When Buddhism entered China, the number of images of Buddhas and Bodhisattvas spread without limit.

And you should not be surprised that early Taoism likewise did not supply images of gods. In the time when Laozi taught the Way, contemporaries such as Liezi, who could ride the wind and fly, and Zhuangzi, who dreamed he was a butterfly, had no worship of images of gods.

Later, in the Han dynasty, after Zhang Daoling the Patriarch established the Way of the Celestial Masters of Zhengyi, the first thing he did was to overthrow the altars of the sorcerers and destroy the various temples and images of gods, breaking the superstition of worshipping the “Six Heavenly Old Breaths.”

Zhang Daoling was also the prototype of Zhenyuan Daxian, “the ancestor of the earth immortals” in the Journey to the West; he only offered worship to Heaven and Earth, and nothing else.

Because most of the local gods and immortals, when they saw him, bowed and kowtowed, for his original spirit was the Kui Star of Heaven, the chief star of the Northern Dipper, the Great Kui and Greedy Wolf Lord.

Therefore, under such a crushing blow, from the beginning of the establishment of the Celestial Masters’ religious group, there was no mechanism for the worship of images of gods.

At that time the Celestial Masters executed the establishment of the Twenty-four Governance, employing local governors to manage the believers, that is, a system of human control over humans.

Moreover, the Zhengyi Celestial Masters mainly used spells to cure diseases and expel evil spirits, not relying on images of gods for the salvation or manifestation of the divine towards the world, so there was no need to fashion images of gods for the believers to worship.

This principle is easy to understand.

For instance, if a man’s leg is already broken and he suffers unbearable pain, a qualified Taoist of the Zhengyi school should immediately recite the Hua Tuo spell and cast it upon him, then invite the Patriarch Hua Tuo to instantly stop the man’s pain; this act is called the master casting a spell.

It is not the case that, seeing a man’s leg broken, one hastily takes out a statue of Patriarch Hua Tuo, places it on the ground, burns incense, and prays for the statue to manifest and protect his recovery.

This is the difference between a master directly using magic and other faiths praying to empty space or to images of gods.

The Zhengyi Celestial Masters, possessing many practical spells, indeed have no need to worship images of gods.

In all matters, Taoist judges simply recite spells and summon the corresponding officers and generals to execute commands.

Since the types of these officers and generals are so numerous, to make images of all of them and worship them would be a great undertaking and utterly unnecessary.

For these officers and generals, when not summoned by the master, dwell inside the master’s body.

When the master needs to use magic, he summons them forth from within himself; therefore there is no need to make images to worship them.

(For example, after receiving the talisman, a Zhengyi judge is assigned his troops. These troops dwell within the judge’s body, and during rituals, the judge uses a token to command and summon from within himself the three divisions, eight scenes, twenty-four gods, and one thousand two hundred officers and soldiers of the talisman army, ready to be dispatched.)

For the Zhengyi school, once the transmission is received, even if no ritual altar is established, one may still perform rituals with incantation water, without affecting efficacy.

It was not until the Wei, Jin, and Northern and Southern Dynasties that Taoist masters of Maoshan of the Southern Court, such as Tao Hongjing the Perfected, compiled the “True Spirit Rank and Occupation Chart,” which was the first recorded arrangement of gods in Taoist sects.

(This chart is not the true spirit rank chart.)

But in Tao Hongjing’s time, many changes had occurred in Taoism.

First, the strong veneration of Buddhism, to the point where the monk emperor Liang Wudi starved, caused Taoism to lose its critical position in the rulers’ hearts.

Tao Hongjing also was compelled, unwillingly, to convert to Buddhism for convenience, and to avoid close association with Liang Wudi, he lived reclusively in deep mountains. When the emperor had matters, he sent messengers to inquire, whence came Tao Hongjing’s title “Prime Minister of the Mountains.”

Second, within Taoism there arose many sectarian disputes; the various sects were not at peace and often fought among themselves.

Therefore, in Tao Hongjing’s “True Spirit Rank and Occupation Chart,” because he was a Maoshan Taoist, he placed the position of the Zhengyi leader Taishang Laojun in the fourth column, deliberately suppressing the status of Zhengyi’s divine authority.

Third, Buddhism from the Western Regions began to pour into China in large numbers, building many Buddha images and temples, and seizing many Taoist blessed lands and caves.

Because of this sudden frenzy for building temples, which Taoism, disliking the making of images and the building of temples, could not endure, if this were allowed to continue, the blessed lands and caves where Taoist patriarchs and immortals cultivated would all be taken by monks.

At that time even the Yellow Emperor Cave in Mount Song, sacred to Taoism, was seized by the Western monk Bodhidharma and became the Bodhidharma Cave.

This was the place where the Yellow Emperor, the ancestor of the Chinese people, cultivated; later, Zhang Daoling, the patriarch, obtained the “Nine Cauldrons Alchemical Book” left by the Yellow Emperor there, and thus attained immortality and founded the Taoist sect with the Yellow Emperor and Laozi as the main figures — the Zhengyi Celestial Masters.

This sect inherited the Chinese Taoist tradition, which through later wars, disasters, regime changes, cultural invasions, foreign rule, and religious incursions, was preserved for thousands of years without interruption and is still passed down today.

During the extensive temple-building of the Northern and Southern Dynasties, Taoism gradually transformed, moving towards the folk, collecting and organizing the deities and beliefs of various Chinese peoples, beginning to build Taoist temples, make images of gods, carve cliff inscriptions, and protect the blessed lands and caves left by Taoist immortals.

Then, did the consecration of divine images begin in this era?

In truth, the act of consecrating divine images was handed down from the Xia dynasty.

In the Xia dynasty, worship of Heaven and Earth deities did not involve images; offerings set before empty spaces sufficed.

But ancestor worship had a ritual called “Standing Corpse Sacrifice.”

The so-called “Standing Corpse Sacrifice” was to have a child play the role of the ancestor, and the clan fed this “ancestor” with wine and meat. This child playing “ancestor” was called the corpse position.

A later idiom, “occupying a corpse position and eating plain food,” meant feeding the “corpse position” with vegetarian food, originally a sign of disrespect to ancestors, but later came to mean occupying an important position without doing any real work.

In fact, this “Standing Corpse Sacrifice” is what today is called “passing through the netherworld” (guoying).

At that time the true situation was that important ancestors would directly possess the bodies of children in the family, and after partaking of the offerings of descendants, would instruct and foretell to the descendants.

Such practices still exist today in folk customs of Jiangsu Province in the medium’s possession by ghosts.

I once heard from the president of a business association in Changzhou, Jiangsu, that he almost every year invites the spirit of his grandfather to communicate and inquire about what to beware that year.

Because it is very effective and the affection between grandfather and grandson is most sincere, and the protection most true, he firmly believes without doubt.

Moreover, in temples of Fujian, Guangdong, and Taiwan, many “gods” can directly possess mediums to speak or write, revealing prophecies or teachings to the faithful.

These are all residual shadows of the Xia dynasty “Standing Corpse Sacrifice.”

Why then was the “Standing Corpse Sacrifice” discontinued?

Because each great clan in those days performed ancestor worship, and the people’s reverence for their ancestors reached its height, which was disadvantageous to imperial rule.

Therefore, the imperial court forbade the people from performing “Standing Corpse Sacrifice” rituals in their clans, allowing only worship before ancestral tablets, forbidding the inviting of ancestors to possess and speak.

Thus, as in the “Heaven’s Severance of Earthly Communication” of Emperor Zhuanxu in the Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors period, the people lost the power of communication with spirits and the ability to directly communicate with ancestors, losing the means to directly grasp future fortune and misfortune, and became dull and ignorant.

Hence, the core of consecration is in fact the soul-calling and spirit-possession ritual of the “Standing Corpse Sacrifice.”

Later, the possession of ghosts and spirits upon people is called “Supporting the Luan,” and if the ghost or spirit is invited to write or give revelations, this is called “Supporting the Ji.”

The human who bears the ghost or spirit is called the “Ji Tong” or “Ma Jiao,” or “Ma Tong.”

Inviting a ghost or spirit to possess a divine image is called “Inviting the Luan,” or “Respectfully Inviting the Luan Jia,” meaning respectfully inviting the divine chariot of the corresponding god to arrive here and reside permanently within this image.

The “Supreme Heavenly Altar Jade Code” states: “All supreme true heavenly immortals and generals do not possess living human bodies; if they do possess and speak through humans, they are surely evil demons and heterodox, improper ghosts.”

It also says: “Or they are called supreme true descending carriage, relying on possession of living humans... thus allowing heavenly demons and heterodox five-route great ghosts to invade the ritual altar.”

But the gods of the earth domain do not belong to the supreme true heavenly immortals and generals, and so have always been able to possess humans.

What are the gods of the earth domain? They are those who once were mortals, not ascending to the Way in the human realm, but becoming gods after death, responsible for governing the earth; these are the earth domain gods.

For example, the City God, the Earth God, the Mountain God, General Yang Si, Marshal Kang, Marshal Wen, Marshal Guan, Marshal Yue, Lord Chi Fu, Lord Li Qiansui, Venerable Guangze, the Eastern Peak General, and many Taoist ritual attendants and masters.

But those like Zhang Daoling the Patriarch, Xu Xun the Celestial Master, Xie Ziran the Patriarch, Li Baban the Patriarch, Lü Dongbin the Patriarch, Zhang Sanfeng the Patriarch, who ascended to the Way in the human realm, are not earth domain gods; they are of the Great Luo Golden Immortal rank, having escaped the cycle of rebirth and completed cultivation, being heavenly immortals.

The “Supreme Heavenly Altar Jade Code”’s mention of “supreme true heavenly immortals and generals” refers to the Three Pure Ones and the Six Emperors, the Boundless Five Elders, the Nine Imperial High Truths, the Thirty-two Heavenly Emperors, the Nine Heavens Responding Primordial Thunder Transforming Heavenly Lord, the Nine Heavens Divine Nine Imperial Lords, Northern Pole Four Holy True Lords, the Thunder Precelestial Thunder Gods Eight Great Heavenly Lords, “Deng, Xin, Zhang, Tao, Pang, Liu, Gou, Bi,”

These great saints only come to the mortal world on scheduled patrols, and naturally do not possess human bodies, which are defiled.

Here I must also explain that in Taoist history it has never been permitted to make images of the highest saints on earth.

For example, the Taoist “Nüqing Tianlu” clearly states: “All acting judges shall not paint the Three Pure Ones or the Five Emperors, but only contemplate Heaven and offer incense, then enter the altar.”

Why is this? Because Taoism holds that the Three Pure Ones and Five Emperors are a kind of qi.

Just as the Jade Emperor’s palace is called the Great Bright Hall, behind which are seventeen rays of golden light, the meaning of “bright” being that only shining golden light can be seen.

And the golden light incantation the Jade Emperor transmitted to humans begins: “Heaven and Earth, the Profound Ancestor, the root of myriad qi,” this mysterious root governing qi cannot be shaped or clearly described in the mortal realm.

And the Three Pure Taoist Ancestors are originally the primordial qi of Taiqing, Shangqing, and Yuqing, present only in the Clear Micro Heaven, Yu Yu Heaven, and Great Red Heaven; these have never been seen in our humble mortal world, and are beyond our mortal comprehension.

Later images of the Three Pure Ones and Four Emperors were all fashioned by painters and sculptors of successive generations, relying on their imaginations, and are not the true forms of the highest saints.

Therefore, in early Taoism, the earliest gods worshipped in temples were mainly earth gods, water palatial gods, and heroic spirits of the human world.

For example, the place of worship for the Mountain God is called the Mountain King Temple.

The place of worship for the Venerable Bixia Yuanjun is called the Bixia Shrine.

The place of worship for the Dragon King is called the Dragon King Temple.

The place of worship for Lord Guan is called the Guan Temple.

The place of worship for Yue Fei is called the Yue Fei Shrine.

The place of worship for the Earth God is called the Earth Shrine.

The place of worship for Yu the Great is called the Yu King Palace.

The place of worship for Li Bing is called the Chuan Zhu Temple.

The place of worship for General Yang Si is called the Yang Si General Temple.

The place of worship for Mazu is called the Mazu Temple.

The place of worship for the Five Sacred Mountains is called the Five Mountains Shrine.

The place of worship for the City God is called the City God Temple.

All these are places of worship for earth gods, water palatial gods, and heroic spirits who became gods in the human world. These earth gods, water gods, and heroic spirits each have corresponding divine souls.

During the consecration ceremony, their divine souls may be summoned to enter and inspire the temple, thus ensuring the temple’s spiritual efficacy and protection for the people.

As for the supreme true saints, they are too far from the human world; the Purple Emperor of the Northern Pole, his true spirit resides in the North Star in the heavens.

Pray, which master can ensure that the consecrated image of the Purple Emperor contains a portion or true spirit of the heavenly North Star? This is difficult for ordinary Taoists to accomplish.

Therefore, in the most rational early Taoist era, one finds the more ancient the temple, the simpler and fewer the gods worshipped, and the highest saints are not worshipped, only earth gods or water palatial gods.

For example, early Wudang Mountain worshipped the True Martial Great Emperor of the Northern Pole because his spirit had once cultivated and attained the Way on Wudang Mountain.

On this basis, the divine soul of True Martial Great Emperor could be invited into the golden hall bronze image.

Likewise, Qingcheng Mountain’s oldest worship is mainly for Qingcheng Elder Zhu Ling the Heavenly Existence.

Because years ago the Yellow Emperor came to Qingcheng Mountain to seek the Way from the Immortal Ning Fengzi, and invited Ning Fengzi to descend the mountain to teach the people the art of making ceramics.

Later, having taught the Yellow Emperor the “Dragon Qiao Classic,” he was bestowed the title of Elder of the Five Mountains and later called Zhu Ling Heavenly Existence.

Thus, the main gods worshipped in Qingcheng Mountain are Qingcheng Elder and the Yellow Emperor.

Because these two immortals once had a connection here, the ritual texts for inviting the two spirits were composed accordingly.

The Taoist worship of gods and building of temples differs from other religions.

True Taoists do not build temples without reason.

Which mountain had what story, which immortal once cultivated there, what special connection exists, and which god should be worshipped — these must be carefully considered.

The gods worshipped must not be dictated by the people’s fancies, piling up countless gods all together; such an arrangement may not be efficacious.

Rather, the images should be simplified, worshipping only those gods connected to the place and able to manifest, ensuring that their divine souls may be invoked.

Ensuring that after building the temple, the gods may manifest and protect the local people.

For the purpose of building temples is, after all, to pray to the gods to safeguard the land and maintain peace.

Yet too few Taoists know these truths; many do not study the origins of these practices, only taking a mirror, reciting a Golden Light spell, and calling the consecration done — which is laughable.

Consecration involves many important procedures, and the consecration of temple images differs from that of household images.

Temple consecrations are somewhat more complex; household images simpler.

The temple consecration procedure is:

First: After building the temple, one must first perform the Dragon placement and soil setting, establishing and pacifying the dragon gods of the land veins of mountains, water, eight mountains, and twenty-four directions.

Second: When preparing to make images, if clay images, one must prepare dirt-filling objects in advance and select auspicious days.

If one does not understand day selection, and begins making images on days such as the god-isolated day, great calamity days, ghost-isolated day, heaven-isolated day, gold god seven calamity day, or other most inauspicious days, the image will be difficult to become efficacious and easily invaded by evil spirits.

The dirt-filling objects must be chosen in accordance with the god’s civil or military character and divine rank.

But must include golden hearts, silver gallbladders, five-coloured threads, thousand-li eyes, wind-following ears, cinnabar, mountain-isolated shouts and responses, road-through, floating hair, water-isolated shouts and responses, throat tubes, left Azure Dragon, right White Tiger, front Vermilion Bird, rear Black Tortoise, fear of demons, sorrow at ghosts, gods, heavenly ladders, etc.

If the god is a thunder god warrior, then golden armour and thunder-shaking children are included.

If a civil official, then jade belts and eight-carried sedan chairs.

In Fujian and other places, live hornets, venomous snakes, eagle talons, beaks, wolf teeth, tiger bones may be placed in the dirt-filling cavity to enhance efficacy and ward off evil.

Third: Open the altar and dispel filth, sprinkling purified water invited by the Nine Phoenix Breaking Filth ritual upon the temple and image.

Fourth: Invite the gods to witness the covenant, present sacrificial offerings, pour wine and offer tea.

Fifth: Raise the memorial and dispatch the order, respectfully inviting the gods to descend and strengthen the covenant; dispatching thunder gods and officers to officiate the consecration rite; if evil ghosts invade the altar, capture them and bind them to Fengdu for punishment.

When raising the memorial, one must first know the palace corresponding to the god to be consecrated.

For example, Wenchang Emperor corresponds to Wenchang Gui Ji Palace; Jade Emperor to Haotian Tongming Hall; Four Officials God of Wealth to Fortune and Prosperity God of Wealth Palace; Dragon Tiger Profound Altar Zhao Gongming God of Wealth to Profound Transformation God of Wealth Court; Compassionate Navigating Perfected to South Sea Compassion Palace, etc.

(Originally, Taoism only worshipped earth domain gods in the mortal world, but with changes of times, began to worship supreme true saints; to ensure these saints’ images manifest, the patriarchs would send memorials upwards to pray for the supreme true saints to descend grace and compassion upon the people.)

Sixth: Dirt-filling and sealing the image’s body, inviting the god to enter and inspire it, and casting divination to confirm.

Seventh: Consecration and dotting the image’s eyes, welcoming the god to the seat, and primordially pacifying it.

In this consecration ritual, the master uses the daily practiced Golden Light incantations and Golden Light palm seals, placing them upon the image, transforming the image’s divine realm quality, changing it from the mortal to the godly with Golden Light.

With Golden Light, the true spirit of the god is willing to take residence, and ghosts and demons fear the Golden Light and dare not invade.

After consecration, the people must come to burn incense continuously for forty-nine days without interruption, then the god’s efficacy is assured.

At the sixth step, in Fujian, Taiwan, and other places, the image is taken to the god’s ancestral temple to request a portion of the spirit.

For example, the Mazu image is consecrated by going to Mazu’s ancestral temple to invite a spirit portion into the image.

If requesting the True Martial Great Emperor, the image is carried to the Golden Summit of Wudang Mountain to invite his spirit portion.

In some places of Jiangxi and Hunan, the people carry the image into the mountains, where the master blows the horn and shakes the master’s knife, summoning mountain-cultivated spirits or loyal and righteous ghosts to enter the image as gods to protect the locality.

(This is the practice of local shamans such as Duan Gong and other folk beliefs, unrelated to Taoism, though efficacious; Taoism does not much approve of such methods, as the spirits summoned are difficult to control.)

In the past, on Longhu Mountain, a millennium-cultivated fox spirit once obtained a commission letter from a Celestial Master, and after receiving it, went to a certain Xuandi temple in Guangdong to serve as the Xuanti Emperor of that temple.

(This kind of spirit, having cultivated for over a thousand years and possessing divine powers and benevolent heart, having passed Dongyue’s examination, going to serve as an immortal, is most reasonable.

For they have wisdom, know how to accumulate merit, know whom to help, what deeds to avoid, and are mature and understanding spirits.)

In past Taoist consecrations of temples, the most mainstream method was composing memorials, inviting high gods to descend their grace and spirit portions.

Although there could be no certainty of their arrival, at least after sending the memorial, one had petitioned the highest saints; even if only a ray of divine light descended, it was better than randomly finding a spirit to act as a god.

Hence it appears that to have efficacious gods, the more grassroots the god, the more efficacious.

Like in Fujian, Taiwan, and Chaoshan, where people directly worship door gods, earth gods, and stove lords at home — these grassroots gods are the most down to earth.

Because in worship of earth gods and stove lords, one need not fear outside ghosts invading the image; after all, the village chief is always present in the village, and any outside ghost daring to impersonate him would be courting death.

As for the highest and greatest gods, firstly, it is difficult to invite their true spirit portions during consecration; secondly, even if a somewhat higher energy spirit portion is invited, it is difficult to ensure proper worship at home.

Slightly improper worship might cause the god to depart, and outside ghosts to enter the image and absorb the incense offerings.

Such a household worshipping outside ghosts, by proximity to the ghostly way, causes various disasters and calamities; with slight negligence, wife and children are separated, home broken and family perished.

Because the taboos of worshipping images are many, the elders of old repeatedly remind the young: “Inviting the gods is easy, sending them away hard; inviting and worshipping the gods must be done cautiously.”

For once handled improperly, endless calamities will be left to future generations.

For example, the household guardian spirits of Northeast China, if not worshipped for a generation, bring misfortune upon the family.

Southwest altar gods also, if not worshipped for a generation, cause turmoil and chaos.

If one cannot find masters who can properly handle these matters, not only will one not receive protection, but it will be very dangerous.

Because Taoism has a systematic method for consecrating images of gods, these images can be kept pure and clean.

Then, monks have not studied the Golden Light method, and the Buddha did not teach consecration of Buddha images.

China has so many Buddha images, so many household Buddha images — what then is inside these images? This question we do not delve into here, but leave for reflection.

Having said thus, one should understand why all the “sages” of the world do not much support the worship of images of gods or Buddhas.

This is because at their level they know common people cannot control what exactly is contained in the images of gods or Buddhas.

And precisely because the people cannot manage these troublesome matters, it is better to let them worship nothing, thus sparing them many unnecessary invasions by evil demons.

But for Taoism, the patriarchs hold that all images of gods in the world belong to the Yang Bureau temples, essentially all subordinate to the Supreme Sovereign of the Earth Office, Tianqi Rensheng Dongyue Great Emperor, under his governance.

If there be demon temples, evil temples, evil altars, or god shrines causing disorder, upon receiving a Taoist’s complaint, Dongyue dispatches thunder gods and officers to destroy the temple.

This absolute administrative enforcement of the divine realm is unique to Taoism in the world.

For example, in the Taoist Canon is a work, “Biography of Earth Domain Supreme General Wen Taibao,” mentioning a Buddhist temple in Sangka Mountain, Min County, Fujian.

There, evil ghosts occupied the temple, claiming to be King Galo; local people long recited the Diamond Sutra and worshipped there, the incense offerings flourishing.

Later, General Wen received orders from Dongyue Great Emperor, led the Yue Mansion officers, and burned the temple with thunderfire; the temple has since vanished.

In Mianyang, Sichuan, there is a Spirit Official Tower built during the Chongzhen reign of the Ming dynasty by Prime Minister Liu Yuliang in fulfillment of a vow to Wang Lingguan.

Later, monks used means to convert the Taoist temple into a Buddhist temple, turning the Spirit Official Tower into a Buddhist temple, an all-wooden structure, reputed to be Asia’s foremost Buddhist pagoda.

After completion, it was burned by Wang Lingguan with thunderfire; the fire pattern formed his image, and the temple disappeared.

At Jiuhua Mountain, Wang Lingguan is worshipped; local monks say Wang Lingguan wished to convert to Ksitigarbha Bodhisattva.

But actually, Jiuhua Mountain’s Ksitigarbha Hall was once a Taoist temple. After its construction, it was frequently burned by thunder gods. After some years it would burn again.

Monks were advised by masters that Wang Lingguan governs the fire department, so they worshipped his image; since then, the hall no longer burned.

In truth, this is Wang Lingguan protecting the Way, awaiting a high Taoist to restore the ancestors’ Taoist temple.

At Mount Emei there is the Three Night Cave, worshipping the Three Night Ladies.

After Mount Emei was called a Buddhist holy place, the Three Night Ladies’ incense remained flourishing; the monks did not destroy it, but took advantage of the people’s reverence to collect incense money.

In 1937, the cave’s resident monk had the people donate a large bronze bell.

After the bell was made, Buddhists brought it to the cave to celebrate; some well-meaning people invited an opera troupe to perform “The Investiture of the Gods” mocking the Taoist Three Night Ladies with the “Three Night Record Setting the Yellow River Array.”

Shortly after the performance began, a great fire burst forth in the cave, and all seventy-two Buddhists present perished.

Since then the cave has lain desolate, overgrown with weeds, and has never reopened.

This was also the patriarch’s Taoist sanctuary; after invasion by other religions, it would rather forgo incense than yield to heretical scriptures.

As to how the cave could spit fire, experts and professors after much research remain puzzled.

Therefore, because Taoist temples have the Yue Mansion’s patrolling gods constantly inspecting, they are much purer.

Many ghosts and gods of the world, fearing Dongyue’s patrol and arrest, dare not roam temple grounds to absorb incense.

The gods within temples, also because of Yue Mansion’s strict laws, if they offend, will be seized and punished in Dongyue’s underworld, so they are very cautious, only diligently fulfilling their duties to protect the people, and dare not act arbitrarily as the ghosts and gods of other religions.

Even the Taoist gods worshipped in people’s homes, under the supervision of the Stove God and Door God, are free from invasion by evil ghosts.

Moreover, Chinese ghosts and demons greatly respect Taoist gods, and only attend incense offerings in images of other religions.

For example, the Five Great Immortals of Northeast China are spirits in Taoism, but they greatly respect Lady Bixia Yuanjun.

Lady Bixia Yuanjun is the sister of Dongyue Great Emperor, commanding a million Yin troops of the Yue Mansion.

Therefore, even worldly demons, seeing temples dedicated to Lady Bixia Yuanjun, respectfully kowtow and dare not act rashly.

When Beijing built the Water Cube, the strange winds stirred by demolishing the Beiding Lady Temple were caused by the dragon god protecting Beiding Lady Temple.

(Beiding Lady Temple also worships Lady Bixia Yuanjun.)

Having understood the divine power of the earth domain gods managing human temples, one finds that gods need not be worshipped too high or too far, just as in human relations.

One need not know the highest people; just enough and fitting is best.

For high gods, in their position, the desires of mortals are too slight to reach.

Furthermore, many matters cannot breach the operation principles of Heaven and Earth and the great Way; they will not casually alter the cause and effect borne by mortals.

But grassroots earth gods are the actual administrators of human affairs (like NPCs in a game).

The fortune and misfortune of mortals are under their control; offering them more incense, worshipping well, managing the relationship between gods and men,

so that gods appreciate, protect, care for, and look after you, then all matters will be “as if aided by the gods.”

The grace of the gods is vast; the gods love the people. The Chinese gods were once people like us, living in this world; they have names and surnames, many being our own ancestors of the same lineage.

They became gods and have been worshipped by the people for thousands of years because they possessed great benevolence.

When we Chinese seek protection from our own ancestors, it is naturally most efficacious.

For example, a Taoist friend of mine in Fujian, simply because she broke up in love, went to the Mazu Temple, and whispered to Mazu:

“Mazu Niang, my luck has been very bad recently; such and such is a scoundrel who deceived me... blah blah blah,”

After complaining, she knelt before Mazu, raised a divination cup, and said:

“Mazu Niang, please bless me to find a rich and good boyfriend; punish that scoundrel with misfortune; if you agree, give me a holy cup.”

After the holy cup was received, she happily went home.

To be able to treat the gods as one’s own grandparents, to speak freely, and even to coquet and play tricks — perhaps only our Chinese gods allow this.
