# The Precious Admonition of Repaying Kindness

With devoted heart I turn and bow in reverence.  
The Mysterious Origin responds and transforms;  
The Martial Star divides the true (essence),  
And looks down with care upon us all living beings.  
All forms are born to pass away:  
Our parents bear us in the womb for ten months,  
And nurse us at the breast for three years,  
Enduring hardship countless times,  
With earnest care and thoughtful concern.  
Pitying our parents,  
Who daily grow old and decay,  
I now hold this thought in equality,  
Fully destroying all perils of greed and anger.  
I bow to the Sovereign as my Master,  
Praying for grace and to repay my root.  
May my parents now living  
Have their blessings and longevity increased and prolonged;  
And may my ancestors of the past  
Early attain release from birth and death.  
Great Sage, Great Compassion,  
Great Benevolence, Great Filial Piety,  
Manifesting in eighty-two transformations,  
Lord of the Teachings of Repaying Kindness,  
Protecting the Holy True Martial,  
God of Fortune governing the world,  
Minister of the Jade Void,  
The Heavenly Emperor of the Mysterious Heaven,  
The Incarnation of the Golden Palace,  
The Worthy of Heaven who at the end of kalpas relieves suffering.
