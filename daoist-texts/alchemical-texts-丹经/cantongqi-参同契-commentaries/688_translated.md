# Annotations on the Cantong Qi, Part the First

Heaven and Earth are the gateways of the Yi, the parents of all the hexagrams. Kan and Li are the enclosing frame, the moving hub and the fixed axle; the four trigrams of female and male are the bellows and the pipe. They again encompass the way of Yin and Yang; the most skilful driver conforms to the rule and the measure, holds the reins of control, follows the proper standards, tracks the ruts of the carriage-wheels, and by abiding in the centre controls the outside; their numbers are in the laws, the calendar, and the reckoning.

The way of the Golden Elixir is one with the way of the Yi. The way of the Yi takes Heaven and Earth for parents; the way of the Elixir takes Heaven and Earth for furnace and cauldron. There must be parents, then there are male and female. There are male and female, then Yin and Yang intercommunicate, and the creation and transformation work within, producing life without ceasing. There is furnace and cauldron, then the gathering of medicines. There are medicines, then water and fire to boil and stew, to transform the old and renovate the cauldron, and again return to the primal truth. The Cantong Qi regards the four trigrams Qian, Kun, Kan, Li as the guiding principles; this is because Heaven and Earth are the gateways of the Yi, the parents of the many hexagrams. The Zhou Yi places Qian and Kun as the first of the sixty-four hexagrams, and thus are the gateways of the Yi. The sixty-four hexagrams comprise three hundred and eighty-four lines. All the Yang lines belong to Qian; all the Yin lines belong to Kun. Yin and Yang alternate and interlace; although divided into sixty-four hexagrams and three hundred and eighty-four lines, all are from the two trigrams Qian and Kun, one Yin and one Yang, whence the variations arise. Therefore Heaven and Earth are the parents of the many hexagrams. This is the meaning of the passage in the text: "Qian is firm, Kun is soft, they fit and embrace each other. Yang receives from Yin, female and male mutually need each other. They need to effect creation and transformation, so that the essence and breath may unfold." When the essence and breath unfold, creation and transformation are in operation, and the sixty-four hexagrams are contained therein.

Kan and Li are the inheritors of Heaven and Earth, inwardly containing the central and upright breath of Yin and Yang of Heaven and Earth, and acting in place of Heaven and Earth to carry out creation and transformation. They are the enclosing frame of the sixty-four hexagrams, so called because they surround all around. The frame is the vast and hollow enclosure. All around is empty and vast, and nothing is without its scope. This is the meaning of the passage: "Kan and Li crown the head, their light shines and spreads abroad. Mysterious and obscure, difficult to fathom, impossible to portray in a diagram."

The moving hub and the fixed axle: the axle is the axle of the carriage, the hub is the wheel hub. The axle carries the carriage and remains fixed; the hub moves to turn the carriage. The Yi takes Heaven and Earth as substance, as the axle; it takes Kan and Li as function, as the hubs and wheels. The moving hub and the fixed axle: substance does not separate from function, nor function from substance.

The four trigrams of female and male, namely Qian, Kun, Kan, Li. Qian is male, Kun is female; Kan is male, Li is female. The bellows have no bottom and are open at both ends; that which is Yin is female. The pipe has a bottom and an opening at one end; that which is Yang is male. The bellows serve to enclose things; the pipe to conduct air. The four trigrams Qian, Kun, Kan, Li, the female symbolize the formed things of Yin; the male symbolize the living things of Yang. They again encompass the way of Yin and Yang, as the bellows enclose things, the pipe conducts air. To encompass again is to comprise altogether. Thus the Yi takes Heaven and Earth for substance, Kan and Li for function, which together comprise the whole work of Yin and Yang creation and transformation. The four trigrams Qian, Kun, Kan, Li stand as the standard and rule, just as a craftsman uses a rule and a square to regulate his work; just as a driver holds the reins to guide and follow the track and wheel-ruts, abiding in the centre to control the outside. Then the remaining sixty hexagrams are all within the motions and stillness of the four trigrams; like the order of the calendar, natural and spontaneous. This is the meaning of the passage: "The four are mixed and turbid, straight entering into the void and nothingness. The sixty hexagrams surround, spread abroad as a carriage."

The cultivator of the Way can take firmness and softness as substance, the central and upright as function; abiding in the centre to control the outside, transforming and regulating, pushing forward and applying change without restraint, then his body has a part of the principle of the Yi. The sixty-four hexagrams are within the square inch of the heart; also the way of bellows and pipes, Yin and Yang, harmonizing with Heaven and Earth in virtue, with sun and moon in brightness, with the four seasons in their order, with ghosts and spirits in auspicious and inauspicious, where is there a great Elixir not formed, a great Way not accomplished?

The monthly periods have five or six days; longitude and latitude obey the sunâ€™s motion, combined to form sixty; firmness and softness have their external and internal. On the day of the new moon, the hexagram Tun is in charge; at evening, Meng takes its place; day and night each have a hexagram, used in their proper sequence. Before the end of the month, the new moon arrives and again begins anew; the sun and moon mark the periods; motion and stillness have their early and late. Spring and summer rely on the internal substance, from Zi to Chen and Si; autumn and winter correspond to the external use, from Wu to Xu and Hai. Rewards and punishments respond to spring and autumn; dusk and dawn follow cold and heat; the line words have benevolence and righteousness; according to the time they express joy and anger. Thus they correspond to the four seasons, and the five elements attain their principle.

The new moon and the first light (also called Mei-shuang); the sun and moon (also called Ri-chen); attain their principle (also called Qi-xu).

Above we spoke of Heaven and Earth, Kan and Li, again encompassing the way of Yin and Yang, their numbers being in the laws, the calendar, and the reckoning. The laws respond to one month; the calendar responds to one year. One year has three hundred and sixty days, carrying out the lines of the hexagrams three hundred and sixty times; the remaining twenty-four lines belong to the four trigrams. When the lines are complete, they turn and begin anew. One month has five or six periods, thirty days; the longitude and latitude of the hexagrams observe the sun and operate. One day has two hexagrams; thirty days make sixty hexagrams. The remaining four trigrams are precisely Qian, Kun, Kan, Li. These four trigrams move the sixty hexagrams, but are not themselves in the line counts. The first fifteen days of the month are Yang, firmness; the last fifteen days Yin, softness. Yang born in the earlier half is internal; Yin born in the later half is external. The sixty hexagrams govern the thirty days, three Yin and three Yang mutually correspond as external and internal. One day, day and night, each carries a hexagram. Each new moon morning carries a hexagram; by day Tun is in charge; by night Meng is in charge. The two hexagrams of day and night have twelve lines; one hour is one line; twelve hours are twelve lines. Thus proceeding for thirty days, three hundred and sixty lines are carried out. It begins with Tun and Meng, ends with Ji and Wei, and then repeats anew. This is the meaning of the passage: "Tun corresponds to Zi and Shen, Meng corresponds to Yin and Xu. The remaining sixty hexagrams each have their day."

The perfect man is one who silently communicates with creation and transformation, secretly accords with Yin and Yang, taking sun and moon as the measure. When it is time to move, he moves; when it is time to be still, he is still; one movement and one stillness without losing the time. One day has early and late. When it is time to advance Yang, then advance Yang; as spring and summer rely on the internal substance, from Zi to Chen and Si, he carries out the six Yang hexagrams. When it is time to use Yin, then use Yin; as autumn and winter correspond to the external operation, from Wu to Xu and Hai, he carries out the six Yin hexagrams. When reward is due, he rewards, responding to the life-giving energy of spring; when punishment is due, he punishes, responding to the killing energy of autumn. When dusk comes, he dims, gathering the Yang energy to respond to the cold; when dawn comes, he brightens, stirring the Yang energy to respond to the heat. One reward and one punishment correspond to the energies of spring and autumn; one penalty and one virtue both find their place. Clear distinction of reward and punishment, whether dusk or dawn, follows the cold and heat seasons; dusk and dawn have their time; advance and retreat are fitting; one joy and one anger imitate the benevolence and righteousness of the line words; joy and anger hold their constancy; life and death have their way. Thus the four seasons respond, the five elements succeed in their principle, and the work of the Elixir is complete. The way of the Elixir is to harmonize the four images and accumulate the five elements. When the four images are harmonized and the five elements gathered, the Elixir head is obtained; advancing further from here, the great Way may be hoped for.

Heaven and Earth establish positions, and the Yi moves within them. Heaven and Earth are the symbols of Qian and Kun; the establishment of position is the arrangement of Yin and Yang in correspondence; the Yi signifies Kan and Li. Kan and Li are the two functions of Qian and Kun. The two functions have no line positions, but circulate through the six voids, going and coming indeterminately, above and below having no constancy.

Heaven and Earth are the laws and symbols of Qian and Kun. Qian and Kun are the nature and temperament of Heaven and Earth. The Great Yi fixes Qian above and Kun below, assigning positions; Heaven is above, Earth below, one Yin and one Yang, in correspondence creating transformation within; the Way of the Yi operates within Heaven and Earth. The Yi is formed with sun above and moon below, taking their movements of rising and setting. The moon is the symbol of Kan; the sun is the symbol of Li. Within Kan is reality, symbolizing the rabbit in the moon; within Li is emptiness, symbolizing the crow in the sun. Kan and Li are the inheritors of Qian and Kun. When Qian and Kun interpenetrate, a line of Qian enters the belly of Kun, Kun becomes solid and forms Kan; a line of Kun enters the body of Qian, Qian becomes hollow and forms Li. Li is the inheritor of Qian; Kan is the inheritor of Kun. The Yin within Li is the central Yin of the Kun family; the Yang within Kan is the central Yang of the Qian family. Kan and Li possess the virtue of central rectitude of Qian and Kun, acting in place of Qian and Kun, symbolizing the non-action of Heaven and Earth, and the movement of sun and moon. Thus Kan and Li are the two functions of Qian and Kun. If Kan and Li are taken as symbols of sun and moon, then the Yiâ€™s Kan and Li are the sun and moon. The moonâ€™s ebb and flow complete one lunar cycle in a month; the sunâ€™s movement north and south completes one solar cycle in a year. The two functions Kan and Li have no fixed position; they move about east, west, south, and north; above and below are six voids; coming and going have no fixed stopping place; above and below have no constant rule. The Zhou Yi takes Qian and Kun as the head, Kan and Li as the middle, and Ji Ji and Wei Ji as the end; these all inherit the creation and transformation of Heaven and Earth, the coming and going, rising and setting of sun and moon. This is the meaning of the passage: "The Yi moves round and flows, bending and stretching repeatedly. Hidden and obscure, changing within. Enclosing all things, the Wayâ€™s plan and principle."

The cultivator of the Way, understanding this meaning, takes Qian and Kun as furnace and cauldron, Kan and Li as medicines; one firm and one soft, both returning to central rectitude. Then the heaven gate is in the hand, the earth axis by the heart; one can move, one can be still; one can be still amid movement, one can move amid stillness; movement and stillness without obstruction, the heavenly principle integrated, one breath flowing.

The Yi is symbol. To suspend the symbol and make it manifest, nothing is greater than the sun and moon. The sun combines the essence of the five elements; the moon receives the six laws and reckoning; five and six make thirty degrees; when the degrees are complete, they begin anew. To exhaust the spirit is to know transformation; when Yang departs, Yin comes; they converge and revolve; entering and leaving, expanding and contracting. The Yi has three hundred and eighty-four lines. According to the lines, the signs are taken; the signs are the sixty-four hexagrams. From the dark to the new moon morning, Zhen comes to receive the sign. At this moment, Heaven and Earth mingle their essence, sun and moon mutually support. The male Yang disseminates mystery and bestows; the female Yin transforms and envelops. Chaos interconnects and joins; the balance and carriage establish their foundation. Managing the nourishment of Yin and Yang, gathering spirit to form the body. All who tread the path without exception proceed by this way.

The Xi Ci says: "Heaven and Earth brooding, all things transform and mature. Male and female join essence, all things take birth." All that in Heaven and Earth belong to Yang are male; those belonging to Yin are female. The male and female join essence; all who tread this path come forth thereby. Even the creeping and moving spirits all come forth by this way. Taking the way of sun and moon joining, and all those having Yin and Yang breath, the same may be inferred and known. This is the meaning of the passage: "Hidden and obscure, changing within. Enclosing all things, the Wayâ€™s plan and principle. To regulate the existence by non-existence, the instrument and usage is emptiness."

Thus Confucius praised the primal chaos, the virtue of Heaven and Earthâ€™s hollow void; examined antiquity to the origin; Gong Sui established the beginning; betrothal and marriage tied the spirits together; the first year then buds and grows. The sage does not come forth vainly; above he observes the manifest heavenly sign. The heavenly sign has advance and retreat, bending and stretching to respond to the time.

Above is spoken the mingling and interjoining of Yin and Yang, from non-being producing being; then one knows that if Yin and Yang do not meet, there is no life breath. The Zhong Yong says: "The Way of the gentleman begins with husband and wife." This is because the way of husband and wife is the beginning of the gentlemanâ€™s Way; hence the Way is subtle and hidden. Even the foolishness of husband and wife may be regarded as knowledge; the unworthiness of husband and wife may be capable of practice. When it reaches its utmost, it observes Heaven and Earth, which are boundless without and within; between Heaven and Earth, all is the breath of the Way. In small, husband and wife; in great, Heaven and Earth; altogether it is the way of the union of one Yin and one Yang.

In ancient times, the august sage praised the Yi and first praised Heaven and Earth, praising the primal chaos. Qian above and Kun below, the hollow void within, one breath all-embracing, the way of life, that is primal chaos. He revised the poems and first praised Guan Ju, examining the origin. The maleâ€™s coming of age and the femaleâ€™s marriage, their spirits tied, Yin and Yang united, life buds and grows, called the first year. Primal chaos is the aperture of creation and transformation. The primal sovereign and the first year are the beginning of creation and transformation. The union of Heaven and Earthâ€™s virtue is primal chaos. Male and female joined in affection, naturally there is growth. All this shows the principle of using Yin and Yang together.

The sage does not come forth vainly in the world; accomplishing himself and things, he wishes all to be sages and worthies, each fully realizing their nature and destiny. Therefore he observes the heavenly sign, manifesting the mechanism of Yin and Yang advancing and retreating, bending and stretching. Like the earlier heaven hexagrams, Li on the left and Kan on the right, Zhen one Yang, Dui two Yang, Qian three Yang, advancing and stretching from left; Xun one Yin, Gen two Yin, Kun three Yin, retreating and bending from right. Also like the later heaven hexagrams, Qian, Kan, Gen advance in the northeast with three Yang; Xun, Li, Kun, Dui retreat in the southwest with three Yin. These all manifest the affairs of the heavenly sign. The heavenly sign changes a thousand ways, never departing from the way of Yin and Yang correspondence. This is the meaning of the passage: "Therefore pushing news and message, Kan and Li vanish and perish" to "Principle of origin as evidence."

Therefore the Yi unites the heart of Heaven, the returning hexagram establishes beginning and sprouting; the eldest son succeeds the fatherâ€™s substance, taking the mother to establish the foundation of the sign. News and message respond to the bell and regulation; rising and falling depend on the pivot of the dipper. On the third day comes dawn, Zhen and Geng receive the west. On the eighth day Dui receives Ding, the first quarter moon steady as a cord. The fifteenth day Qianâ€™s substance arrives, full and round in Jia of the east. The toad and rabbit moon spirits, sun and moonâ€™s breath both bright; the toad watches the hexagramâ€™s divisions, the rabbit emits life-giving light. Seven and eight days are finished, winding and bending low; on the sixteenth turning receives control, Xun and Xin see the dawn; Gen meets Bing in the south; the last quarter on the twenty-third; Kun and Yi on the thirtieth day; northeast loses its friends. The period concludes with mutual succession, the inheritor again giving birth to the dragon; Ren and Gui correspond to Jia and Yi; Qian and Kun encompass beginning and end. Seven and eight make fifteen, nine and six also correspond; the four together make thirty; Yang breath is exhausted and concealed. It symbolizes midwinter, when grasses and trees are all withered and damaged. Assisting Yang are merchants and travellers; the ruler deeply conceals himself. It symbolizes observing the season and order, closing the mouth and not speaking. The Way of Heaven is vast and broad; the great mystery has no shape or form; emptiness and stillness cannot be seen; enclosing and encompassing with disappearance. To err and lose the thread, speech only ruins itself. Separately describing these four images to enlighten the blind among later scholars.

Emptiness and stillness (also written as Lyu-ji).

Above is spoken that the heavenly sign has the way of advancement, retreat, bending, and stretching in response to the time. Responding to the time by advancing, retreating, bending, and stretching, all are the operations of the heavenly heart; therefore the principles of the Yi change, internally governing the heavenly heart. The heavenly heart has no shape nor symbol, cannot be seen; because Yin and Yang intercommunicate, a single point of vitality emerges from void and nothingness, and thus can first be seen. The Yiâ€™s returning hexagramâ€™s symbol transmission says: "Returning, is it not to see the heart of Heaven and Earth?" Returning means Yin is at its extreme and Yang is born; Kun contains and conceives Zhen; Yang breath begins to sprout; in the month it corresponds to the eleventh month, the beginning of Zi. Zhenâ€™s one Yang comes from the Qian palace, being the inheritor of Qian, the eldest son of Qian. Qian is father, hence called eldest son succeeding the fatherâ€™s substance. Zhenâ€™s one Yang is born beneath pure Kun; Kun is mother, hence called taking the mother to establish the foundation of the sign. The sign means beginning; foundation means origin. Yin at its extreme gives birth to Yang; Qian and Kun interpenetrate; in the dim there is substance, in the obscure there is essence; life vitality begins in this sign to return to origin. This life vitality is the heavenly heart; it is also Zhenâ€™s one Yang. Because all things borrow from this to be born, it is called life vitality; because it appears in the intercommunion of Yin and Yang, it is called heavenly heart; because it is still at extreme before it moves, it is called Zhen. In truth it is life vitality, Zhen Yang, altogether the heavenly heart. This heavenly heart is everywhere present, at every time; yet everywhere present and always there, men find it hard to measure; hence it cannot be seen. When it is the eleventh month, beginning Zi, all things sprout in the earth; men all know its life vitality is again moving, hence it can be seen. The heavenly heart is the Yang born from Yin. The heart of Heaven and Earth appears in the place where Yin and Yang intercommunicate. In truth, the heart of Heaven and Earth, the heavenly heart is altogether one heart, only differing in the place of appearance and birth. This heavenly heart life vitality gives birth without end; its news and message of rising and falling are all governed by Yi principle. The news and message respond to the bell and regulation; rising and falling depend on the pivot of the dipper. For example, in the month of Zi, one Yang is born, corresponding to the hexagram Fu; the regulation responds to Huang Zhong; the dipperâ€™s pivot points at Zi; in the month of Chou, two Yang are born, corresponding to the hexagram Lin; the regulation responds to Da Lu; the dipperâ€™s pivot points at Chou and similar. The six Yin and six Yang, twelve hexagrams govern the twelve months; correspond to the twelve regulations; depend on the twelve positions pointed out by the dipperâ€™s pivot; the twelve monthsâ€™ Yin and Yang news and message rising and falling, the dipperâ€™s pivot revolving, all are changes of the heavenly heart. And the Yiâ€™s six Yin and six Yang hexagrams govern these; is not the Yi governing the heavenly heart? This is the meaning of the passage: "The new moon morning is Fu" to "Return to Kun origin."

Again, at the time between the new and dark moon, sun and moon meet; the moon receives the sunâ€™s light. On day one, two, three, at evening the pure black body, a slight Yang is born below, corresponding to the hexagram Zhen, showing the Emei light in the southwest Geng position; this is called Zhen receiving Geng. Gradually to the eighth day, two Yang are born, corresponding to the hexagram Dui, symbolizing light half-born, the first quarter moon appearing in the south Ding place; this is called Dui receiving Ding. By the fifteenth, three Yang are full, corresponding to the hexagram Qian; the light is full and bright, appearing in the east Jia place; this is called Qian receiving Jia. Yang at its extreme then Yin; bending and folding low. On the eighteenth, one Yin is born beneath the light, corresponding to the hexagram Xun; the light is deficient; dawn appears in the west Xin place; this is called Xun receiving Xin. On the twenty-third, two Yin are born, corresponding to the hexagram Gen; the light is half deficient, the last quarter moon appears in the south Bing place; this is called Gen receiving Bing. On the twenty-eighth day, dawn and slight Yang vanish in the northeast Yi place; the radiance is all extinguished. By the thirtieth day, Yin breath is pure and full, corresponding to the hexagram Kun; this is called Kun receiving Yi. The moon gives birth to light in the southwest Geng place; the Yi says southwest loses its friends. From northeast the light is extinguished; the Yi says northeast loses its friends. The period ends with mutual succession; the dark moon and then new moon; Yin at its extreme then Yang; Zhen inherits and gives birth to light again; Ren and Gui correspond to Jia and Yi; Qian and Kun encompass beginning and end. Ren Yang, Gui Yin; Jia Yang, Yi Yin. Ren water is clear, born from Qian Yang breath; Gui water is turbid, transformed from Kun Yin breath. Ren corresponds to Jia, Qian receives Jia Ren; Gui corresponds to Yi, Kun receives Yi Gui. The first half month belongs to Yang, the affairs of the Qian family; the latter half month belongs to Yin, the affairs of the Kun family. From Zhen to Qian, from Xun to Kun, these are the three Yang and three Yin hexagrams of Qian and Kun, governing the beginning and end of the month. Qian encompasses the Yang born within Yin, on days seven, eight, and fifteen. Kun encompasses the Yin born within Yang, on days nine, six, and fifteen. Seven, eight, nine, and six together make thirty days; the moonâ€™s Yang light completes one cycle of waxing and waning, news and message, advancing and retreating, bending and stretching, symbolized; and the Yiâ€™s three Yin and three Yang hexagrams govern it. Although the three Yin and three Yang hexagrams govern, in truth it is the two hexagrams Qian and Kun governing. Although the two hexagrams Qian and Kun govern, in truth the one point of life vitality of the heavenly heart governs. Is not this the Yi governing the heavenly heart? This is the meaning of the passage: "Between the dark and new moon" to "Is the ancestor of the Yi."

Above is spoken one year, one month, Yin and Yang advancing and retreating, bending and stretching, all naturally; nothing but the operation of the heavenly heart. When Yang advances and stretches, it is the heavenly heartâ€™s unfolding; when Yin retreats and bends, it is the heavenly heartâ€™s contraction. Yang must be called heavenly heart; Yin also must be called heavenly heart. Yang also proceeds from the heavenly heart as Yang; Yin also proceeds from the heavenly heart as Yin; Yin and Yang both issue from the heavenly heart. The heavenly heart is mingled in Yin and Yang; Yin and Yang are not outside the heavenly heart. But the place where the heavenly heart is first seen is always between stillness at extreme and beginning of movement; hence it symbolizes midwinter, when grasses and trees all wither and are broken; Yin is at its extreme. Yin at extreme must give birth to Yang. Former kings at the day of utmost closure, merchants and travellers do not move; later none inquire the direction; they deeply conceal and do not move. This is to assist the subtle Yang and nurture the life vitality of the heavenly heart.

The cultivator of the Way, if he can imitate the time and follow the seasonal sequence, like the ancient kings closing their gates, empty to the extreme, still and steadfast, then the earlier heaven breath passes from non-being into being, white is born in the black, the heavenly heart is again revealed, condensed into one grain of millet, warmed and nourished, transforming body and bone, longevity and immortality, surely attainable. Ah! Only this phrase: to imitate the time and follow the seasonal sequence, already completes the wondrous principle of the Golden Elixir; what more need be said? Therefore one may close the mouth and need not speak. The way of the Golden Elixir begins and ends simply in cultivating the heavenly heart, the one flavour great medicine. Imitating the time and following the seasonal sequence, the heavenly heart always abides, from tender to firm, from subtle to manifest; with time and deep effort, it is forever indestructible. The so-called knowing the one whereby all things are completed is this; what need of speech? Yet the principle of the Way of Heaven is vast and boundless; the great mysterious breath has no form nor shape; utmost emptiness and stillness cannot be seen; how then to establish enclosure and boundary to form a limit? The Way of Heaven is the great mystery, all is another name for the heavenly heart. The heavenly heart is empty and still, invisible, and so cannot be enclosed or bounded. If one speaks forcibly, errors must arise. Losing the thread of the heavenly heartâ€™s vast emptiness and flowing operation, one cannot gauge the method and origin; speech will instead destroy its virtue; better not to speak at all. But the Way is originally without speech; speech serves to manifest the Way. If indeed one does not speak, how to lead later learners? Therefore the Yi Way is used to separately describe the four images of Qian, Kun, Kan, and Li; by one year of the coming and going of Yin and Yang of Heaven and Earth; by one month of Kan and Li as sun and moon joined and parted, the trace of the heavenly heart is revealed, to enlighten the blindness of later learners. From "symbolizing midwinter" to "to enlighten the blindness of later learners," the meaning of the passage from "always following the earth's principle" to "lasting a thousand ages."

The whole season is the pulse of the heavenly heart; borrowing one year of Yin and Yang; one month of waxing and waning; to unfold one spirit and two transformations of the heavenly mechanism. The last part returns to the place of no form, no image, no speech; the heavenly heart, all spirit, fully revealed. It is said very vast, said without form or shape, said invisible; truly empty and containing marvelous being; marvelous being and containing true emptiness; the heavenly heart is its own symbol, that alone. This unspoken speech, the highest of speech, though it is commentary on the Cantong Qi, the immortal master probes and explores hidden meanings, revealing what the text does not; it may be called uprooting the root of Heaven and hollowing the cave of Principle; yet fearing men cannot understand, the concluding phrase is: "Separately describing these four images, to enlighten the blindness of later learners," so that the learner may have image without end, no image, with shape exhausting no shape. How great is this compassion!

The arrangement of the eight trigrams and their shining lights moves without losing the centre; the primal essence is obscure and difficult to see; by reasoning and comparison one verifies the signs. When at rest, observe their images; by comparison imitate their form; establish figures as models; prognosticate and determine auspiciousness or inauspiciousness; give commands and follow the seasonal order; do not lose the time of line movements. Above observe the He river chart; below arrange the earthâ€™s forms and flowing waters; in the middle examine the human heart, benevolence, righteousness, propriety, wisdom, and constancy, the heavenly goodness. Consult the Way of the three powers and unite as one Way. When moving, follow the hexagram seasons; when still, depend on the explanations in the texts for detailed judgment of auspiciousness or inauspiciousness. Imitate the laws of Heaven and Earth, use nine and six lines, act according to time, strong and smooth in unity, returning to the central upright Way, integrated heavenly principle, then the body and Heaven and Earth are in order. The body and Heaven and Earth are the originally possessed virtue of Yangâ€™s vigour and Yinâ€™s compliance. The virtue of vigour and compliance harmonized, Yin and Yang breath in accord, virtue matching Heaven and Earth, calmly following the Middle Way, a sage. Yet without knowledge of astronomy, without understanding geography, then the human heart is confused and desires mixed, not knowing the Way of transformation, not holding the Mean or not holding the One, how can one attain the calm place of the Middle Way? The three words "then in order" imply the boundless work of knowing, power, and practice within, which the learner must deeply ponder. This section is the meaning of the passage: "The chief of government, renovation and transformation."

As to the utmost sage, it is none other than Fu Xi, who first drew the eight trigrams, imitating Heaven and Earth. King Wen, the ancestor of the empire, formed the body and developed the line words. The Master and the many sages heroic, with the ten wings to assist. The three sovereigns raised by Heaven, alternately arising to govern the time. Excellence and inferiority have their order; merit and virtue are not unequal. The work of production has its succession; by reckoning and measuring, carefully dividing the smallest unit. With form the Yi is measured; without sign, difficult to plan. The affairs of making orders and laws, for the world to set these books. Originally with no prior knowledge or form, due to following the teacherâ€™s awakening. Bright as raising the curtain, frowning eyes ascending a high platform. The Fire Record six hundred chapters, their pursuits equal and not confused. The words solemnly spoken, the worldâ€™s people not thoroughly think. Seeking to trace their source and current, obscure and bright originally coexisting. Secretly for the worthy to speak, how dare lightly write? If the tongue be tied and mute, abandoning the Way earns blame and punishment. Writing feelings upon bamboo and silk, yet fearing to reveal the heavenly sign. Hesitating, adding sighs, looking up and down, stitching this folly. Cultivation and training have methods and rules, not all can be fully explained. Briefly stating the plan and principle, branches and leaves appear sparse.

Equal and not confused (also written as not unequal); branches and leaves (also written as branches).

The Way of Heaven and Earthâ€™s spiritual transformation is without sound or smell, no saint can know it, no saint can practice it. Since the opening and separation, the Way has been manifesting images, but men do not know. The River Chart emerges from the River; the Luo Book emerges from the Luo; the sages follow them. Fu Xi then took the River Chart, looking upward and downward, first drew the eight trigrams, then extended to the sixty-four hexagrams, revealing the heavenly machine of creation and transformation. It was passed down to King Wen, changed into the later heaven eight trigrams, dividing the yarrow stalks to unfold the later heaven sixty-four hexagrams, divided into three hundred and eighty-four lines. Further attached to words of auspiciousness and inauspiciousness, regret and blame; the Way of Heaven and manâ€™s affairs is thus made manifest. Later came the august sage who composed the ten wings, searching out hidden and profound meaning to aid the Yi Way; the Way of Heaven and man, its order and reversal, change and constancy, was all made clear and complete. Heaven gave birth to three sages, who alternately arose to produce and govern the time, measure the world, and transmit the lifeblood for ten thousand generations. Though the steps have order, their merits and virtues are equal. In the Eastern Han, Bo Yang, the Wei immortal, followed the Yi Way and composed the Cantong Qi, reckoning the hexagramsâ€™ lines, auspiciousness and inauspiciousness, regret and blame, carefully distinguishing the Elixir Wayâ€™s medicines and fire times, transforming the form to formlessness, comparing form to formless, to facilitate menâ€™s comprehension.

This book was indeed fixed by the True Man for the world, not written for fame. Originally with no prior knowledge or form, due to following the teacherâ€™s awakening, is what Xu Weng himself says he cannot know the mysteries of this book. Having first received instruction from the Yin True Man, he was enlightened and then saw this book and thus knew it. Ah! Xu Wengâ€™s innate talent, yet even he cannot beforehand perceive the Cantong Qi; there must be a teacher to transmit before enlightenment. How is it that in this world of confused men, I, a sage, boast myself, without seeking a true master, rashly discourse and privately guess, taking one or two cases from the ancients, speaking of the Way and discussing virtue, considering myself greatly enlightened; yet when asked about the Cantong Qi, I know nine things not one; and take this for enlightenment, how very mistaken! Little knowing this book is the ancestor of the collection of immortal elixir books; later Zi Yang Wu Zhen, Xing Lin Fu Ming, Bi Ling Huan Yuan, Zi Qing Di Yuan, Chang Chun Xi You, all based on this book. The superior man and the accomplished one, having one secret from a master, carefully read this book, expanding knowledge and insight, is like drawing up the curtains in a dark room, suddenly light appears; like ascending a high platform, glaring and gazing, nowhere unseen. Though the Fire Record be six hundred chapters, one may equal their pursuit and not be confused.

The Fire Record six hundred chapters are the sixty-four hexagrams of the Zhou Yi. The Yi of ten makes a hundred; it takes the fire times most detailed and precise, refining ever more to be ever more pure. Besides the sixty-four hexagrams, there is no separate six hundred chapters of Fire Records. The textâ€™s solemn repeated words are because learners fear difficulty and will not thoroughly research the subtle points; therefore there is repetition to raise and urge. If one is willing to grapple with the text, restrain oneself by propriety, taking afar from things, near from the body, seeking the source of the Way, measuring the current of the Way, knowing the source and current, passing through obscure and bright, this is called knowing the Way. Such words and teachings may be the Way for the knowing; difficult to speak to the unknowing. If not a worthy one, how dare lightly reveal? Not daring to lightly reveal, nor daring to abandon the Way for fear of punishment. Hesitating and sighing, looking up and down writing, waiting for the knowing listener. As to the method of cultivation and refining, adding and subtracting, advancing and retreating, must await secret formulas, not able to be set forth by words. Briefly stating the plan and principle, exposing the artful thread, only to clarify the general outline of the Way.

Ah! The Immortal Masterâ€™s commentary on the Cantong Qi, a thousand words and ten thousand sayings, teaching many points, profound and detailed; yet still says not all can be fully explained, only briefly stating the plan and principle. Alas for later learners, hearing one or two words and phrases, then self-sufficient and complacent, unwilling to advance in study, simply saying the Way cannot be spoken, truly the Immortal Masterâ€™s blame, how lamentable indeed!
