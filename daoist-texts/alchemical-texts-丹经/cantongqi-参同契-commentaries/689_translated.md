# Annotations on the Treatise of the Unity of the Three (Middle Section)

The fire is struck from the sun-drill; without the sun there is no light. The square compass is not the stars nor the moon; how can it obtain water? The two breaths are profound and distant, yet their influences mutually communicate; much more so when they are near the body! The matter lies in the heart and chest. Yang and Yin are matched to the sun and moon; water and fire are the tokens of their efficacy.

The Way of cultivating Reality consists entirely in stealing from Heaven and Earth the breath of emptiness and non-being, and in appropriating the power of Yin and Yang’s transformation. The Yin Fu Jing says: ‘Its secret workings none under Heaven can see or know.’ When the world neither sees nor knows, then it is possible to steal it. If one can see and know, then it is acquired after Heaven, and not before Heaven. What is cultivated is one’s own Yin alone; how can one congeal the sacred embryo, call forth being from non-being, and perfect form and spirit? Just as the sun-drill does not originally have fire, but borrows the sun to produce fire; and the square compass does not originally have water, but reflects the stars and moon to obtain water. The sun-drill and square compass are separated from the sun and moon by tens of thousands of li, yet by the mutual sympathy between having and not having, they are able to communicate breath. How much more so the breath before Heaven, which is close to my body and lies in the heart and chest! Is there one that cannot be influenced and transformed thereby? Those that cannot be so influenced are all because Yin and Yang are not harmoniously united. If they are united, then the breath before Heaven comes from emptiness and non-being, and the elixir is perfected within a single hour.

Behold, the yang nature and yin disposition of my body are as the sun and moon in heaven; the true essence, primal spirit, and vital force of my body are as the water and fire of the sun and moon; the mysterious gate of the body’s yin portal is as the sun-drill and square compass. When the mysterious yin portal stands open and nature and disposition are communicated, nature and disposition being communicated, spirit and vitality flourish; spirit and vitality flourishing, the Golden Elixir is born. It is also like the sun-drill taking fire, the square compass taking water; the two mutually forming shape, and one thing arises. This is the token of producing being from non-being. The Dao De Jing says, ‘The Valley Spirit never dies; it is called the Mysterious Yin Portal. The gate of the Mysterious Yin Portal is called the root of Heaven and Earth.’ The mysterious yang is active; the yin portal is passive. The gate of the Mysterious Yin Portal is the gate that produces Yin and Yang, the gate having motion and stillness; hence it is called the root of Heaven and Earth. Within this gate dwells the Valley Spirit. The Valley Spirit is the spirit wherein Yin and Yang unite to become one. The Valley Spirit produces Yin and Yang by movement and stillness. Yin and Yang unite and produce the Valley Spirit. The Mysterious Yin Portal is the Valley Spirit. If followed, it produces men and forms the illusory body; if opposed, it produces immortals and forms the true body. Between following and opposing lies the great distinction between truth and illusion. The Master Immortal uses the image of the sun-drill taking fire and the square compass taking water, the mutual sympathy of the two breaths, to instruct men; how wondrous it is! This section annotates the great meaning of the passages “About to nurture nature” and “The Kan man becomes the moon” in the Treatise.

The methods of right and wrong, the laws of the viscera, within observing the thoughts, treading the steps of the Dipper and the Mansions, the Six Jia with the sun and moon. The Yin Way tires of the Nine Ones; turbid disorder plays with the primal cells. Eating breath rings the intestines and stomach; vomiting the straight, inhaling the external evil. Day and night no sleep, new and full moons never resting. The body daily weary and fatigued, the mind confused as if mad. A hundred vessels boil and race, unable to settle in clarity. Piling earth and establishing altars, morning and evening respectfully offering sacrifices. Ghostly things show forms and images, dreams and waking give rise to sighs. The heart is glad, the mind joyful, self-assured that life will be prolonged. Suddenly with premature death, the form and bones rot and dissolve. Every movement is contrary, rebellious and losing the pivot and mechanism. The arts are many and numerous, thousands and tens of thousands; previously departing from the Huang-Lao, twisting and contorting in the Nine Capitals. The wise examine their meaning, and clearly know their origin.

Examine their meaning (one copy has “scrutinize their meaning”); pile earth (one copy “black earth”)

The Way of cultivating Reality, once obtained, is eternally obtained; it is most simple and most easy; knowing it and doing it, one at once ascends to the sage’s place. In Confucianism, it is the Way of the Mean; in Daoism, it is the Way of the Golden Elixir; in Buddhism, it is the Way of the One Vehicle. Its essence lies in the balance of hardness and softness, the harmony of nature and disposition, and sincerity in oneness without division. Scholars of the world, not meeting a true master, turn aside into side gates; some fix the mind and stop thought, practising inner observation; some tread the Big Dipper and Mansions, refining the Six Jia; some practise the Nine Ones evil arts, playing with primal cells; some move the breath of inhalation and exhalation and cease food; some neither sleep day nor night and are confused as if mad; some circulate breath meridians and have a hundred vessels boiling and racing; some pile earth and erect altars and dwell among ghosts and monsters. Such as these, thousands and ten thousands, their movements differ and contradict, rebellious and losing the great Way; their original aim was eternal life, but instead they injure life. Formerly departing from the teaching of Huang-Lao, they suffered the troubles of the Nine Capitals; how could they know that in the world there is the great elixir of returning seven times and nine returns of the golden liquid, able to transform a female into a male, old age into youth, life and death into immortality? If there are those of clear wisdom and noble aspiration who meet a true master and understand the great meaning of the Way, they will clearly and broadly know the path of cultivating Reality; it is not among the three thousand six hundred gates. This section annotates the meaning of the passage “The ospreys cry” in the Treatise.

Closed above it is called Being; closed below it is called Non-being. Non-being serves the Being above, where Divine Virtue abides. These two orifices and passages, the metal breath also mutually assist.

Above it is said, the wise examine their meaning and clearly know their origin. To examine means to examine what meaning? To know means to know what origin? It is to examine the meaning of this Golden Elixir, and to know the origin of this return and restoration. The Way of the Golden Elixir has two methods, action and non-action. The superior virtue practises the way of non-action to perfect nature; the inferior virtue practises the way of action to perfect destiny. The superior virtue in practising the way of non-action is because his superior virtue is the uninjured original nature, Yin and Yang harmoniously united, the mind’s orifices closed, and the heart of the Way ever present; therefore it is called Being. The inferior virtue in practising the way of action is because his inferior virtue is the damaged original nature, Yin and Yang scattered, the heart of the Way’s orifices closed, the human mind taking charge; therefore it is called Non-being. Being has the heart of the Way but not the human mind; Non-being has no heart of the Way but has the human mind. No heart of the Way is inferior virtue; having heart of the Way is superior virtue. Therefore, the Non-being of inferior virtue must serve the Being of superior virtue, removing the human mind and increasing the heart of the Way, guarding Non-being to preserve Being. The Being of superior virtue has the Divine Virtue always abiding, nourishing the heart of the Way and guarding the human mind; borrowing Being to transform Non-being. When the human mind departs, it is true Non-being; when the heart of the Way is firm, it is true Being. True Non-being is true Yin; true Being is true Yang. True Non-being and True Being, these two orifices and passages, the metal breath also mutually assist. The two orifices and passages are the two orifices of true Non-being and true Being. The method is the two methods of action and non-action. The metal breath is the breath of the original true unity before Heaven, called Metal in Water. This breath is vague and indistinct, dark and obscure, neither colour nor void, neither Being nor Non-being, having and not having mutually forming shape, and one thing arises. Therefore, two orifices and passages. Using the method to cultivate it, the metal breath mutually assists in the midst and congeals; it is not said that the metal breath mutually assists, but said that the metal breath also mutually assists; herein lies a great secret. The heart of the Way possesses true knowledge and feeling, belongs to Metal. Its breath is most hard and great, filling Heaven and Earth, and difficult for all things to bend. Therefore it is called Metal Breath. This breath has many different names: Metal Flower, Metal in Water, True Lead, Breath before Heaven, Divine Brightness, Divine Virtue, Primal Essence, Yellow Sprout; all returning to the real place, summing up to true knowledge and divine virtue, this is Divine Virtue. The superior virtue practises the way of non-action, guarding against danger and anxiety to preserve it; the inferior virtue practises the way of action, gradually gathering and refining to restore it. Able to preserve, the Being returns to purity; able to restore, the Non-being again returns to Being. The two methods of action and non-action all serve to complete this Divine Virtue Metal Breath as one thing. Therefore it is said, the metal breath also mutually assists. Superior virtue and inferior virtue contend over action and non-action; when the metal breath is refined and forged into a treasure, the post-Heaven Yin breath is exhausted, form and spirit both wondrous, united with the Way and perfected in truth, then Being and Non-being no longer stand; Heaven and Earth all return to emptiness; what difference then remains between superior and inferior virtue? This section annotates the meaning of the passage “Superior virtue is non-action, without examination or seeking; inferior virtue acts, its use without ceasing.”

Using metal as a dam, when water enters then there is freedom and leisure. Metal measures fifteen taels, and water’s quantity is the same. Facing the furnace, fixing weight and measure, five fen water in excess. The two are taken as true; metal weighs as in the beginning. The third then does not enter, with two fires accompanying it. The three mutually contain and receive one another, their transformations resembling the divine. Below is the solar breath, hidden steaming for a moment. First liquid, then congealed, called the Yellow Carriage. The years and months about to end, destroying nature and injuring the years of life. The form like ash and earth, resembling dust on a bright window. Pounding, treating, and combining, holding it into the vermilion gate. Firmly sealing its junctures, striving to bring it to perfect hardness. The fierce fire is spread below, day and night the sound is diligently right. Beginning with the literary to enable cultivation, ending with the martial to display it. Watching and observing with added caution, carefully adjusting cold and heat. Revolving through the twelve periods, when periods end one must be especially attentive. The breath that threads life is about to cease; cease death of soul and spirit. The colour changes to purple, brightly becoming the returning elixir. The powder is gathered into one pill; the knife and wedge are the most divine.

Mutually containing and receiving (one copy “already combined in measure”); like ash and earth (one copy “as ash and earth”)

The previous section spoke of superior and inferior virtue, the two methods of action and non-action. This section details the subtle utility of the inferior virtue’s method of action. The inferior virtue is the way of action, returning after Heaven to before Heaven. Returning after Heaven to before Heaven, one must first know the true gold single flavour great medicine. This gold is not the common gold of the world, but the true gold of our genuine knowledge. This gold is forged by fire, enduring with Heaven and Earth, shining with the sun and moon. Therefore, after the elixir is formed, it is called the Golden Elixir. At the furnace and in the work, first metal is used as the dam. The dam serves to restrain the metal producing water. The dam restrains the metal to produce water as a measure of entry. The water entering is not the flooding water, but the pure unified water. The matter of the elixir concerning the use of metal is great; the matter concerning the entering of water is also not small. The restraint of metal lies in the skill of neither approaching nor departing; the entering of water lies in the subtlety of neither haste nor delay. Neither approaching nor departing is life within death; neither haste nor delay is firmness within softness. Leisurely and natural, waiting with ease for labour, and with stillness awaiting movement. The subtlety of restraining metal and entering water is first to know their fundamental numbers. True knowledge’s true gold, from one yang recovers and gradually attains purity and completeness, round and shining bright. Penetrating the obscure and reaching the clear, like the fifteen days of the moon, shining fully in the orb, illuminating everywhere. The measure taken is fifteen taels; this is the fundamental number of metal. One fen of metal produces one fen of water; one tael of metal produces one tael of water. Like the moon’s sixteenth day, one yin quietly arises. At the thirtieth day, the brightness is all spent, returning to the black body; the measure is also fifteen taels. Therefore it is said, metal measures fifteen, water’s number is the same. The method of using water has its own subtlety; it cannot be used according to its fundamental number. For example, the fundamental number of water is fixed at fifteen taels; when it reaches five fen, it is surplus water and cannot be entered; when it reaches two fen, it is pure and unified true water, just suitable for entering. When the water is true, water can produce metal; it is the mother concealed in the child’s embryo, the child repays the mother’s grace. Metal does not leak breath, and does not harm metal; therefore metal is heavy as in the beginning, not losing its fundamental number of fifteen taels. If water rises to three fen, it is also called surplus, and cannot enter. Students must know that water has distinctions of clarity and turbidity, and the difference of Ren and Gui. Ren water is clear and belongs to Yang; Gui water is turbid and belongs to Yin. Ren water has breath but no substance; it is the pure unified true water; Gui water is pure Yin with substance; it is the flooding, mixed, and impure water. Two fen water is like water just springing forth in a spring, pure and clean; it is Ren water. Three fen water has flowed and been polluted; five fen water flows further away and is already turbid; all these are Gui water. The elixir path takes only the breath of the water, not its substance. Using the substance harms the metal; using the breath helps the metal. Therefore, two fen of water assists fifteen taels of metal.

Yet to enter water true, entering fire must not lack observation. Fire is the spirit of emptiness and subtlety. The harmonious breath of Yin and Yang, water uses two fen, fire also must use two fen. Two fen of fire is like the first kindling, warm but not dry, bright but without flame. Water uses two fen, not losing the metal’s weight; fire uses two fen, not overpowering the metal’s body. Thus combined, water helps fire, fire does not dry; fire refines metal, metal produces brightness; metal produces water, water has its root. Water and fire help one another; metal and fire dwell in the same palace; the three mutually contain and receive one another, transforming and changing, wondrous and unfathomable. The three mutually containing and receiving are three but returning to one.

Within the cauldron and furnace, the medicine itself is fire, fire itself is medicine; medicine and fire give birth to one another, harmonious breath permeating and steaming. Within is the spirit light of the sun, one point of true fire refining. In a moment, true gold melts and becomes liquid, gradually solidifying from tender. Changing from white to yellow, called the Yellow Carriage. Yellow is the colour of the centre; carriage is the image of earth. Metal has dryness; meeting fire the dryness is instantly dispelled, the hard becomes soft, hardness and softness as one, Yin and Yang mixed, returning to the central and correct place, named the Yellow Carriage, also called the Golden Elixir. The sages cultivate the Great Elixir, gathering years to months, months to days, days to hours. According to the law, gathering and overseeing, within one hour Heaven and Earth’s creation is utterly seized, Yin and Yang and the Five Phases utterly seized, all things’ breath and number seized. It is hard to meet and hard to err; if one errs by a hair’s breadth, it is a loss of a thousand li, destroying nature and injuring longevity, gaining and yet losing. At this time, one must greatly apply the present; outwardly observe the form, the form without form; inwardly observe the heart, the heart without heart. Both form and body are forgotten, without smoke or fire, like ash or earth, like dust on a bright window. Pounding, treating, and combining, hardness and softness both transformed, the traces of form all gone. Sending into the vermilion gate, emptiness and subtlety not obscured, nothing minute escapes. Firmly sealing the junctures, striving for complete hardness; the returning elixir is within one hour; warming and nourishing must last ten months. Firmly aiding and sealing, not leaving for a moment, until the embryo is complete and spirit perfected, the warming and nourishing work must not cease. Fierce fire spread below, day and night the sound diligently correct. There is a natural true fire, in the furnace blazing and all lines glowing red. Beginning with the literary, enabling cultivation, the work of one hour; ending with the martial, nurturing the self, the work of ten months. Watching and observing with added caution, watching the survival and death of the breath, cautious and careful, guarding against danger and anxiety. Examining and adjusting cold and heat, examining the degree of fire’s season, neither dry nor cold, cold and warm, harmoniously adjusted. Revolving through the twelve solar terms, when the term is complete one must be especially attentive. The breath that threads life is about to cease; ceasing, death of soul and spirit. The colour changes further to purple, brilliantly becoming the returning elixir. The powder gathered into one pill; the knife and wedge are most divine.

The previous section spoke with detail of the excellence of the work of action; this section follows speaking of the essentials of non-action.

Non-action is embracing the primal and guarding the One, which is the matter of superior virtue. Though it is the matter of superior virtue, when the elixir is attained, the life foundation is firm, it is the same practice as that of superior virtue; there is action and then entry into non-action. But guarding the centre and embracing oneness is not empty and void non-action; within it is the work of preserving the pre-Heaven and transforming the post-Heaven. It requires all conditions to rest, all dusts not to stain, the body and mind greatly settled, then it can aid matters. The body and mind unsettled are all due to the three poisons of ear, eye, and mouth. The ear listens to sounds, the eye looks at forms, the mouth utters words, the body follows the ear, eye, and mouth; the mind moves following sound, form, and speech. When the mind moves and the body moves, the true nature is not clear; though the elixir is attained, the Dharma body is hard to free itself, hard to avoid Yang extreme producing Yin, gaining but finally losing. If one closes the three poisons, not letting them open and communicate, the three poisons can be turned into the three treasures. Not only can they not harm, but they can bring blessings. Closing is not what the adepts call closing eyes, closing mouth, and blocking ears; rather it means not seeing what is improper, not listening to what is improper, not speaking what is improper. Not seeing what is improper means the seer fully observes propriety, closing eyes to what is improper. Not listening to what is improper means the hearer fully observes propriety, closing ears to what is improper. Not speaking what is improper means the speaker fully observes propriety, closing mouth to what is improper. To the utmost, seeing colour without colour and closing the eyes; hearing sound without sound and closing the ears; not speaking at improper times and closing the mouth. If one can close these ears, eyes, and mouth, then inner thought cannot arise, external things cannot enter, body and mind do not move, the Real Man sinks into the deep abyss. Without cognition or knowledge, motion and stillness are as one, floating and roaming guarding the norm. The norm is what takes the circle; the circle is the centre; the centre is the circle. Guarding the norm and centre is to hold fast to the mean. Sinking into the deep abyss means only essence and oneness. Holding fast to essence and oneness, body and mind do not move or shake.

Turning and bending to see and hear means turning back the light and reflecting inward, rejecting intelligence and destroying wisdom, collecting and gathering spirit. Opening and closing all in harmony means the heart dead and spirit alive, closing out evil and preserving sincerity, neither forgetting nor helping. Being one’s own pivot and control means self being private desire, the pivot and control used to overcome the self. Motion and stillness without exhaustion or end means whether motion or stillness, the work is unceasing. Li breath nourishes inner defence; Kan does not use intelligence; Dui unites without speech; rare words follow the primal chaos. The three once locked and bolted, relaxed body dwells in the empty chamber. Resigning will to return to emptiness and non-being, no thought taken as constant. Verification is difficult to transfer; the heart concentrated and not sprawling. Sleeping and waking spirit mutually embracing, waking and sleeping not forgetting, watching for life and death. Colour moistens and enriches, bones and joints become stronger. Dispelling many evils, then establishing proper Yang. Cultivating without ceasing, the vital breath moves as clouds and rain. Flowing and moist like spring waters, liquid as if melting ice, flowing from head to foot, ultimately returning upward. Coming and going with no bounds, full and content in fullness. Reversal is the test of the Way; weakness is the handle of virtue. Cultivating the old filth accumulated, finely adjusting innate innocence, though at first turbid, finally clear; at first dark, long lasting bright. Yellow centre gradually penetrating principle, moistening and reaching the skin. Proper at the beginning, then perfected at the end. Dry and established, not yet able to hold. The One conceals, and men of the world do not know.

Inner nourishment and defence (one copy “honouring defence”), without ceasing (one copy “thus resting”)

The previous section spoke with detail of the excellence of the work of action; this section follows speaking of the essentials of non-action.

Non-action is embracing the primal and guarding the One, which is the matter of superior virtue. Though it is the matter of superior virtue, when the elixir is attained, the life foundation is firm, it is the same practice as that of superior virtue; there is action and then entry into non-action.

Being one’s own pivot and control means self being private desire, the pivot and control used to overcome the self.

The One conceals, and men of the world do not know.

This section’s shallow meaning is deep; its demonstration and verification often uses the illusory body as metaphor. Yet within is concealed the secret of warming and nourishing the Dharma body. Try the opening phrase, “The Real Man sinks into the deep abyss, floating and roaming guarding the norm,” and one may know that after action there is the Way of non-action. If one measures only by refining the self, one greatly misses the Master Immortal’s subtle meaning. The Real Man is the sacred embryo; just now refining the self, the Real Man has not yet appeared in form; how can he sink into the deep abyss and guard the norm? Students must know that this section annotates the meaning of the passage “Nourishing the self within.” The four phrases “Ear, eye, and mouth three treasures, closed and blocked, not opening or communicating; the Real Man sinks into the deep abyss, floating and roaming guarding the norm” correspond to the four phrases “Nourishing the self within, calm and void, originally concealed brightness, inwardly illuminating the form and body” in the Treatise. From “Turning and bending to see and hear” to “Then establishing proper Yang,” twenty phrases annotate the two phrases “Three lights sink, warming and nourishing the embryo pearl.” From “Cultivating without ceasing” to “Fine adjustment and smooth flow,” twelve phrases annotate “Diligently practising, morning and night without rest.” From “The turbid to clear path” to “Moistening and reaching the skin,” four phrases annotate “Concealing food three years” to “Long happiness without worry.”

As for the six phrases “The Way accomplished, Virtue fulfilled” etc., they are clear and easy to understand, thus omitted. It is known that this section is after cultivating destiny, and yet also cultivating nature. The conclusion points out “Proper at the beginning then perfected at the end, rotating and establishing, ultimately holding,” and it becomes clearer still. Proper at the beginning and rotating and establishing means first making effort to cultivate destiny. Perfected at the end and holding means finally non-action to perfect nature. Nature and destiny must be cultivated together, the work requiring two stages. The superior virtue does not wait to cultivate destiny but at once cultivates nature, practising this stage of work, and can accomplish the great matter. The inferior virtue must first cultivate destiny then cultivate nature; when destiny is firmly attained, then practising this stage of work, one enters the sage’s foundation. Therefore it is said, “Proper at the beginning then perfected at the end, rotating and establishing, ultimately holding.” But superior virtue is non-action, inferior virtue is action; one must know the breath of original true unity before Heaven. The superior virtue’s non-action embraces the primal and guards the One, that is guarding this one breath; the inferior virtue’s action returns after Heaven to before Heaven, that is returning to this one breath. If one does not know the superior virtue’s non-action, one falls into emptiness; if one does not know the inferior virtue’s action, one clings to illusion. Action is not this, non-action is not that. The so-called knowing the one and all things are finished is precisely this. The cultivator, if not meeting a wise master, this one breath is hidden within the post-Heaven, concealed and unseen; how can one know it? Therefore it is said, “The One conceals, and men of the world do not know.” O students, should you not hasten to seek a true master?
