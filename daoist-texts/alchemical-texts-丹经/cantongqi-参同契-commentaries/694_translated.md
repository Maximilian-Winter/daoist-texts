# Images and Words Dispelling Doubts

Images and Words Dispelling Doubts: Preface

The myriad volumes of the Danjing are all composed in images and words. Images and words are neither straightforward speech, nor plain speech; neither empty speech, nor strange speech; but they have substance and principle, bearing indication and proof; they take images to unfold the words of truth. Later generations have not examined their meaning, but only grasped their images; among the Confucians who read them, they regard them as absurd and fanciful; among the Daoists who read them, they think them merely as the outer images of the sheath—indeed, some have seized upon the images and given rise to suspicion, practising various artifices, wandering into crooked paths and evil conduct, harming their nature and life, innumerable without number. Alas! Is this really the intention of the ancient sages and worthy men in taking images to establish their words? The Yi says: "The greatest model of images is Heaven and Earth; the greatest transformation and adaptation is the Four Seasons; the most manifestly suspended images are the Sun and Moon." The Danjing all take their origin from the Zhou Yi, and their medicines and timing all borrow from Heaven and Earth, the Sun and Moon, and the Four Seasons to develop their profundities. If one regards the images and words of the Danjing as absurd or as a mere sheath, the Yi has images of wind and cloud, thunder and lightning, dragon and tiger, ox and horse, deer and sheep, tortoise and pheasant; and what of the images of the dimly seeing, the lame walking, mounting the battlements, friends wearing hairpins, biting the skin and extinguishing the nose, being trapped by stumps and trees, carrying ghosts in a single cart, cutting sheep without blood, and so forth? Shall these also be deemed absurd and mere sheath? How lamentable! The right Way has long been lost, not only from today. Since I met a true teacher, I have taken from various Danjing texts, comparing them one with another; indeed there is something to be gained in the meaning of images and words. Therefore, what I have received from my master I have fully disclosed in the books of "Reflection," "Awakening," "Expounding the Truth," and "Original Intention," yet fearing that students would find them difficult to unify, I have also written the book "Images and Words Dispelling Doubts," illustrating with diagrams and pictures, carefully distinguishing right and wrong, sweeping away heterodox paths and pointing to the right Way, quelling false doctrines and defending the true tradition—this is my fundamental wish. Those who see this book should consider that even the dead can speak of the art of life; do not reject it with laughter because of its dregs. It would be a great happiness.
