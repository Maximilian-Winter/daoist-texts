# On Following and Reversing the Course

All men in the world know the way of following the course, but do not know the way of reversing the movement. What is following? It is to follow the creative transformation; what is reversing? It is to reverse the creative transformation. To follow the creative transformation is to produce men and things, to bring forth birth, old age, sickness, and death, revolving without rest; to reverse the creative transformation is to become immortal and Buddha, neither born nor destroyed, with life coeval with Heaven and Earth.

Ordinary men, from their parents’ conception in the womb, after their birth, at the age of sixteen, enter upon the acquired nature; within, the seven natures and six desires confound their true selves; without, the myriad ties and myriad affairs weary their forms. They take the false for the true, evil for right, and suffering for joy; they follow their desires and stop at nothing. They exhaust and consume the three treasures of original essence, energy, and spirit; they utterly forget their original perfect and clear true nature, and until the breath is cut off at the throat, they will not cease. Therefore they live and die again and again, sinking into ten thousand calamities; what is called the King of Hades not calling them, but casting themselves into death.

If one be a man of great wisdom, he reverses and moves against the creative transformation, not confined by it, not moulded by yin and yang, not drawn by the myriad things, not swayed by the myriad ties. Like planting a lotus in the great fire, or dragging a boat through mud and water, he borrows the world’s methods to cultivate the Way’s methods, follows the human way to fulfil the heavenly way. He will root out all the dust of kalpas and remove all the later arising guest breath. His life is by his own will, not by the Lord of Heaven; he returns to the original face of the Primal Heaven, escapes from the cycle of birth and death, transcends the three worlds, and becomes a diamond-like indestructible being.

Yet this secret of following and reversing the heavenly mechanism, passed by mouth and heart, must be pointed out by a true master; it cannot be known by private conjecture. Scholars in the world, relying on their faint glow of fireflies, their narrow observations, write down a few words, have read a few cases, and fancy they understand; they seek no further, show off before men, and babble disorderly; leading others blind by their own blindness, this is a grievous fault indeed.

Again, there are many confused men who cannot recognise a true master, who go from one lord to another, studying this little practice of the Lesser Vehicle, and yet claim to bear the Way. Even with the enlightened before them, they will not humble themselves, but make a confused tumult. Sometimes their heart qi descends and kidney qi rises, which is called reversing the course; sometimes their moving qi rises from behind and falls before, called reversing; sometimes refining essence to supplement the brain is called reversing; sometimes breath-holding to fix the spirit is reversing; sometimes taking yin to supplement yang is reversing; sometimes man below and woman above is reversing. Such as these thousands of families, all are turning their backs on the holy Way; they are not reversing the creative transformation; they are the way of taking death, not the way of perfect life. Little do they know that reversal is to turn back to the beginning of one’s birth from father and mother; as when a man leaves home far away, it is called returning against to the home.

Though called reversing the course, in truth it is to follow the principle and act accordingly; this is the great following within reversal. Because it is contrary to the way ordinary men go, it is called reversal. Those who take crooked paths and bypaths, deluded by the one word reversal, make myriad efforts on the flesh and skin bag, but in the end come to nothing: is this not folly?
