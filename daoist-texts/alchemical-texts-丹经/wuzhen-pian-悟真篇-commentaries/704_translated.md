# A Direct Instruction in the Awakening to Truth

Preface to A Direct Instruction in the Awakening to Truth

The Way of cultivating Reality is the study which exhausts the principles and completes the nature to the utmost of life. Therefore, if one desires to exhaust his nature, he must first investigate the principles of that nature; if he desires to reach his destiny, he must first investigate the principles of that destiny. If he is able to illuminate these principles, then he will have true knowledge and certain insight, and will not be led astray by the false; he may exhaust his nature, he may reach his destiny. But if not, without investigating the principles, right and wrong cannot be distinguished, good and evil are confused, and he enters by by-paths and crooked paths, fixating on emptiness and appearances: this is not cultivation of Reality, but is the pursuit of the false. The study of the false recedes daily from the Way, and so deceives one’s nature and destiny: how can one then cultivate and preserve one’s nature and destiny? This is the reason why the Immortal Elder Zi Yang composed the chapter on Awakening to Truth. His chapter explores the hidden and searches out the obscure; it traces the profound and extends far; it draws from afar things and draws near to the person; comparing and employing many analogies.

His original desire was that all men might awaken to the truth, and that each one might cultivate Reality. But alas, the ignorant and deluded of later generations do not obtain the true transmission; they grasp images and muddy words, recklessly conjecturing and privately disputing; some regard it as a secret elixir, some think it is about burning and refining, some suspect it to be emptiness and silence, some become entangled in fixations on appearances, greatly missing the Elder Immortal’s compassionate intention to save the world. Formerly those who annotated and explained did not lack excellent interpretations; yet, though excellent, these still explained images by images, and used metaphor to explain metaphor; they concealed the root and revealed the branch, spoke in secret words of mother and child, and did not clearly and openly lay bare the Way, leaving the learner confused and ignorant, utterly unable to awaken to it. This is not understanding Awakening to Truth, but merely narrating Awakening to Truth. Alas! The more notes there are, the more obscure the principles; the wider the books, the more perplexed the people; the true Way daily declines, while the false Way daily flourishes; true learning is daily buried, while false learning daily rises, filled with strange and odd things; it is no wonder that the Confucians look upon the Way Teaching as a heterodoxy.

As for me, having heard the fragrant wind of the Hermitage Valley, I know this book to be the cave of principles for the cultivation of the Way, the ladder of Heaven for consummation of Reality; the root and source of nature and destiny, the order of the fire and the stages, is all complete. Yet it has long been obscured by evil doctrines, like dark clouds covering the sun, its radiance not manifest. I, a humble disciple, fortunate to be near the gate and wall, cannot bear to withhold this true treasure; I therefore present it to my fellow travellers in the Way, entitling it A Direct Instruction in the Awakening to Truth. I do not presume to say that I have attained the truth, but only seek to aid the truth.

At that time, in the fourth year of the reign of the Great Qing Emperor Jiaqing, in the autumn full moon of the year of Jiwei, Liu Yiming, the Simple and Unadorned Recluse of Mount Qiyun, wrote this preface in the Nest of Freedom.
