# The Doctrine of Realizing the True: The Direct Instruction of the Nature Sect, Volume Four

The Nature Sect is the outer collection of the Treatise on Realizing the True. After the Immortal Elder composed the Treatise on Realizing the True, still fearing that the original source and the direct intuition of Nature had not been fully explored, he further composed songs of praise, ballads, and miscellaneous sayings, appending them to the end of the volume, so as to provide a path to the joint cultivation of nature and life.

### Four Quatrains

**The First**

The wondrous substance of the Tathāgata is as numerous as the sands of the river;  
Ten thousand phenomena arrayed in forested order, without obstruction or concealment.  
Attain the perfect penetration of the true Dharma eye,  
Then know that the Three Realms are but my own home.

The Tathāgata is that which comes from nowhere, goes to nowhere; it is the nature of true emptiness. True emptiness is not empty, hence its substance is most wondrous. The nature of true emptiness originally has no substance, because within it is contained wondrous existence, and thus the wondrous is its substance alone. If empty but not wondrous, it is mere annihilated dull emptiness, not the true nature of the Tathāgata; how could it then be as countless as the sands of the river? How could the myriad phenomena be without obstruction or concealment? Because it is wondrous and not empty, its substance pervades the sands of the river and is everywhere unobstructed; because it is empty and yet truly so, the myriad phenomena in their array cannot obstruct or conceal it; because it is as countless as the sands of the river and unobstructed, it is called the perfectly penetrating Dharma eye. Perfect means without head or tail, without back or face, without before or after, without above or below, without inside or outside, just as the Tathāgata is. Penetrating means present everywhere, manifest at all times; great, filling heaven and earth; small, subtle as a hair’s tip: this is the wondrous substance. Only what is perfect can penetrate; only because it penetrates is it perfect; its radiance shines brightly, illuminating all conditions, injuring none; hence possessing the Dharma eye is the same as possessing the treasury of the true Dharma eye. To meet with this perfect Dharma eye is precisely to personally behold the wondrous substance of the Tathāgata, which is neither form nor emptiness, yet form is emptiness; heaven and hell are altogether swept away. The Three Realms are one family; the ten directions are the entire body.

**The Second**

To look upon it, one sees no form;  
And when called, it responds yet again.  
Do not say this sound is like the echo in the valley;  
If there were no valley, whence the sound?

To look upon without seeing form is emptiness; to call and it responds again is existence. Because emptiness leads to existence, like the echo in the valley; empty and yet not empty, this seems to be the wondrous substance of the Tathāgata. Yet the wondrous substance of the Tathāgata is ever empty and ever existent, ever existent and ever empty; why need one call for it to respond? That it responds when called shows there is still emptiness present. If emptiness is present, it is still bound by emptiness. Empty but not penetrating cannot be reckoned the wondrous substance of the Tathāgata; better to shatter this emptiness with one stroke. If emptiness empties nothing, whence comes sound? Since there is no sound, there is likewise no emptiness; no emptiness, no sound; great enlightenment and great liberation, lively and free. The saying "At the hundred-foot pole one does not move others," though one has entered (this state), is not yet true; to advance beyond the hundred-foot pole, the worlds of the ten directions are one’s entire body.

**The Third**

One thing contains hearing, seeing, consciousness, and knowledge—  
These four dustly conditions display their mechanism.  
Yet the ever-spiritual one thing is still not existence;  
On what then do the four depend and rely?

Hearing, seeing, consciousness, and knowledge—these four are bright and clear, arising from the one spiritual mind. Because this one thing is ever spiritual, within the dustly conditions the four arise together, never for a moment tranquil. If one can remove this ever-spiritual one thing, then the four have no support and vanish of themselves. All deluded men fail to recognize that the original nature of the Tathāgata is true emptiness and wondrous existence. They take the bright and clear spiritual mind as reality, sometimes emptying this thing, sometimes guarding this one thing. Little do they know this thing is the root of birth and death, the seed of transmigration through kalpas. Unless one uproots this one thing utterly, how can one recognize the original nature of the Tathāgata? This is what is called “The root of birth and death through countless kalpas,” and fools call this the original man.

**The Fourth**

Without moving a step, one arrives at the Western Heaven;  
Sitting upright, all directions are before the eyes.  
If light shines behind the nape, it is still illusion;  
Clouds forming beneath the feet are not yet immortals.

The original nature of the Tathāgata has no head or tail, no back or face; welcoming it one sees no head, following it one sees no rear; speaking of its existence, it seems not; speaking of its nonexistence, yet it is. It does not fall into the forms of existence or nonexistence. Its light penetrates the dark and reaches the bright, illuminating the three thousand great thousand worlds; it is the wondrous natural awareness, originally not produced by sitting. All who seek Chan and meditate, merely playing with the flow of spiritual mind, see these illusions and false images, sometimes dream-travel to the Western Heaven, sometimes light appears behind the nape, sometimes in the dimness the eyes see things, sometimes clouds arise beneath the feet, and thus they suppose they have truly attained Buddhahood: how far mistaken! Those aspiring to the Way must first sweep away all side doors and heterodox paths, and then in formlessness and colorlessness investigate the true wondrous awareness, so that their original nature may be saved.

### Hymn to the Ground of Nature

Buddha-nature is neither same nor different;  
A thousand lamps share one light.  
Add nothing, nor lessen aught,  
To take or to leave, no error falls.  
Burned or washed away, all is no harm;  
Seeing, hearing, knowing, perceiving—no single law can be guessed.

This hymn named “Ground of Nature” compares the true nature’s substance to the earth’s unmoving, unshaken nature; although conditions and things are manifold and various, all are met with an equal mind, like a thousand lamps shining, all light but lamps are not one. This nature neither increases nor diminishes, neither takes nor leaves, fire burns and water floats, all cannot harm it, just as the earth bears mountains and accepts water flowing, all things harmed or damaged it contains. Thus the earth is so, so is nature. Hearing, seeing, knowing, perceiving are all nothing; forcibly naming them, they are only emptiness. Emptiness is not annihilation, but the response to things as they are, conforming to circumstances with no mind.

### Hymn on Birth and Death

Seeking life, originally there is no birth;  
Fearing death, how can it ever truly die?  
What eyes see is not like what ears hear;  
What the mouth speaks is less than what the nose says.

The original nature of the Tathāgata is originally without birth or death; one who forcibly seeks life and fears death, when has he not been born and perished? Where is birth, there is death; only without birth is there no death. Because its nature is without birth or death, it cannot be seen by the eye, only heard by the ear; cannot be spoken by the mouth, only intimated by the nose. What the eye sees and mouth speaks is the nature of birth and death; what the ear hears and nose says is the nature without birth or death. That which is seen and spoken is not true nature; that which is heard and intuited is the true nature. The unseen vision is true sight; the unsaid speech surpasses spoken words. This birthless, deathless nature has no head or crown, no back or face; neither is nor is not, not empty nor form; what is there to see? What to say? If one can see and speak of it, it is no longer true emptiness and original nature.

### Hymn on the Mind as the Only Reality of the Three Realms

The three realms are but the mind’s wondrous principle;  
All things are neither this nor that.  
Not one thing is other than my mind;  
Not one thing is myself.

The three realms are the Realm of Form, the Realm of Desire, and the Formless Realm. The realms of form and desire are realms of mind; the formless realm is a realm without mind. Both with and without mind are not Buddha-nature. The hymn names the three realms as only mind, neither existence nor nonexistence; both existence and nonexistence do not stand; things and self all return to emptiness. The mind without mind is called the true mind; the true mind’s mind is the unity of all things, with no distinction of this or that. Not one thing other than my mind means not attached to emptiness; not one thing being myself means not attached to form. Not attached to emptiness, not attached to form, only one mind. One mind is one nature; mind is Buddha; Buddha is mind; Buddha is mind and mind is Buddha.

### Hymn: Seeing Things is Seeing the Mind

Seeing things is to see the mind;  
Without things the mind does not appear.  
Through the obstacles of the ten directions,  
The true mind is everywhere.  
If knowledge and understanding arise,  
They become inverted views.  
To behold conditions without mind,  
Is to see the face of Bodhi.

That seeing things is seeing the mind, without things the mind does not appear, refers to the mind of the knowing person with knowledge and recognition. The true mind that pervades the ten directions without obstruction is the true mind without knowledge or recognition. The human mind arises and perishes according to the presence or absence of things; the true mind is ever bright and clear, whether with or without things, pervading the ten directions without hindrance. It neither arises nor perishes, incomparable to the human mind of knowledge and recognition. If one uses knowledge and understanding to comprehend the true mind, one is the thief of oneself, an inverted view, greatly mistaken. The true mind is round and bright, pure and clear, bare and radiant, not apart from conditions, not attached to conditions. One who can behold conditions without mind is the true mind, the true face of Bodhi, needing no other place to seek Bodhi’s face. The essential is no human mind, only then can the true mind be seen. When the true mind is once seen, Bodhi is instantly realized, the other shore is suddenly crossed.

### Hymn on Equality of All Things

I am not different from others, but the human mind differs itself.  
People have kinship and estrangement; I have no distinctions.  
Water, land, flying and walking, all viewed as one substance.  
Honour and lowliness, hands and feet as one’s own.  
I am not myself, how could there be you?  
Neither this nor that, all bubbles return to water.

This hymn named “Equality of All Things” treats distinctions of self and others, kinship and estrangement, water and land, flying and walking, honour and lowliness, as all manifesting one substance equally. The emphasis of the hymn is the phrase “I am not myself.” The reason men cannot equalize all things is because the self exists. If one can be without self, how can one know of you? When you and I are both forgotten, all things are emptiness; without equality, equality arises of itself.

### Hymn: The Mind is Buddha

Buddha is mind, and mind is Buddha;  
Mind and Buddha are always illusory things.  
If one knows no Buddha and no mind,  
Then is the true thusness Dharma-body Buddha.  
Dharma-body Buddha has no form,  
One round light containing myriad phenomena.  
The substance without substance is the true substance;  
The appearance without appearance is the real appearance.  
Neither form nor emptiness, nor non-emptiness,  
Neither moving nor still, neither coming nor going.  
No difference, no sameness, no existence or not,  
Difficult to grasp, difficult to cast away, difficult to hear or see.  
Within and without perfectly bright and penetrating,  
One Buddha-land is within one sand grain.  
One grain of sand contains the great thousand worlds;  
One body and mind, myriad forms alike.  
To know this one must understand the law of no mind,  
Unstained and unimpeded, pure karma.  
Good and evil, myriad kinds, no doing,  
This is Namo and Kāśyapa.

This hymn emphasizes the line “To know this one must understand the law of no mind.” No mind is not the dull and empty no mind. If so, like wooden and clay statues, how could mind be Buddha? Generally no mind means to be unattached to form, unattached to emptiness. The true mind has no substance no appearance, originally nothing; what colour could there be? The true mind radiates containing myriad phenomena, perfectly penetrating without obstruction; what emptiness could there be? Neither form nor emptiness, round and bright, clear and naked, radiant and pure: mind is Buddha, Buddha is mind, neither mind nor Buddha. Thus it says Buddha is mind and mind is Buddha; also mind and Buddha have always been illusory movements. To recognize mind is Buddha, yet know it is neither mind nor Buddha, and so attain the law of no mind, not falling into the school of annihilation.

### Hymn of No Mind

Laugh at my mind, so dull and base;  
Vacant, carelessly drifting, let all things be as they will.  
Not understanding cultivation, nor making sin;  
Never benefiting others, nor serving self.  
Not holding precepts nor observing taboos;  
Unaware of ritual music, nor practicing benevolence or righteousness.  
What men can do, I know not one.  
When hungry, I eat; when thirsty, I drink.  
When tired, I sleep; when awake, I walk.  
When hot, I wear single clothes; when cold, I cover with quilts.  
No thoughts or worries, no joy or sorrow.  
No regrets or plans, no mindfulness or intent.  
Worldly honour and disgrace are but temporary lodgings.  
Birds resting in the woods are my similes.  
Coming yet not stopped, going yet not hindered.  
No avoidance, no seeking, no praise, no blame.  
Not disgusted by ugliness, not covetous of beauty.  
Not seeking quiet rooms, nor shunning bustling streets.  
Not speaking ill of others, nor boasting of self.  
Not esteeming high nor despising low.  
Loving friends, hating foes, great or small, inside or outside.  
Sorrow, joy, gain, loss, respect, insult, danger, ease—  
The mind has no twofold vision, calmly one and equal.  
Not for fortune first, nor misfortune first.  
Responding after feeling; rising when pressed.  
Not afraid of blades; why fear the tiger’s cub?  
Naming things as they are, how heed names?  
Eyes do not seek colour; ears do not enter sounds.  
All phenomena are falsehoods.  
Male and female, form and sound, none have fixed substance.  
Substance and appearance without mind, unstained and unimpeded.  
Free and at ease, no thing can burden.  
Wondrous awareness, light and round,  
Illuminating inside and out.  
Enfolding the six extremes, no far or near.  
Light yet not light, like the moon upon water.  
Hard to choose or compare.  
Understanding this wondrous function, transcending the other.  
If asked whence the teaching, this and no other.

In these verses of tens of words, repeatedly it is to expound the phrase “no mind.” The wonder is in one no mind. Dust can be outside dust; dwelling in the world, one can transcend the world; free and easy, nothing can burden. The human mind’s inch square cannot tolerate a single speck of dust; with dust inside, countless thoughts arise. The human mind arises, now here, now there; the body is not master, so the self is absent, using slaves as master. Using master as slave, how can one be free? If one can hold all with no mind, unmoved and unshaken, this is freedom. Being so, one can be present, free and self-directed; all worries cease, all attachments do not arise; wondrous awareness is bright and round, illuminating inside and out, enfolding the six extremes, no far or near. Truly free, the use of no mind is wondrous indeed.

### Hymn on the Heart Sutra

Aggregates, truths, roots, dust, emptiness, and form—  
All lack a single law worthy of mention.  
Deluded views have vanished away;  
The stillness of substance is evident.

Aggregates are the five aggregates—form, feeling, perception, volition, and consciousness; truths are the four truths—suffering, origin, cessation, and path; roots are the six roots—eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, mind; dust are the six dusts—form, sound, odour, taste, touch, dharma; emptiness is stillness; form is attachment to appearance. The six—aggregates, truths, roots, dust, emptiness, and form—are all laws arising from mind, all are distorted views. If all these are swept away, the mind’s substance is stillness; that is Avalokiteśvara Bodhisattva, that is Śāriputra, nonarising and nonperishing. If within the six a single particle remains, there is birth and death, and no freedom. Only upon reaching the place of birthlessness, deathlessness, and constant freedom is the six utterly pure.

### Hymn on No Guilt and Merit

All day long moving yet not moving,  
All day long sitting yet not sitting.  
Cultivating good, merit is not attained;  
Doing evil, no guilt is found.  
If people do not understand the mind,  
Do not take these words to cause chaos.  
After death one must meet King Yama;  
Hard to avoid cauldrons, boiling water, and millstones.

This hymn named “No Guilt” asks what merit is. Merit and guilt all arise from the mind. With mind doing evil, there is guilt; with mind doing good, there is merit. Good and evil, merit and guilt, arise from mind. Upon reaching the state of no mind, moving or sitting is not known; how can one know good or evil? How can one know merit or guilt? Thus it says cultivating good does not produce merit; doing evil originally has no guilt. Like an infant, without knowledge or awareness, its joy, laughter, anger, and scolding all arise without mind; what merit or guilt is there? No mind is no human mind. No human mind has true mind; the true mind measures as vast as heaven and earth, embraces all things, thinks not good or evil, does not make guilt or seek merit; merit and guilt are not reckoned. If people do not understand true mind, and allow stubborn mind to manipulate, committing all manner of sins, claiming no guilt, after death cannot escape the cauldrons and millstones.

### Hymn on Perfect Penetration

Seeing the true emptiness, empty yet not empty,  
Where is the perfect illumination not perfectly penetrating?  
Roots, dust, mind, laws—all are no things;  
Only in wondrous use do they know their oneness with things.

The nature of true emptiness is perfectly penetrating without obstruction; its radiance shines everywhere, nothing can hide it. Not empty yet empty, empty yet not empty, only constant response and constant stillness, constant stillness and constant response.

### Hymn on Following Others

All things crisscross before the eyes;  
Following their movements, stillness, and measures.  
Perfect illumination, settled wisdom, never stained;  
Like water emerging the lotus, the lotus remains pure.

Though only four lines, this hymn means the line “Perfect illumination, settled wisdom, never stained.” Perfect illumination is wondrous existence; settled wisdom is true emptiness. True emptiness naturally pervades all things yet is not stained by them. Wondrous existence naturally meets all things and can respond to all things. Constant response and constant stillness, following place and being at ease, like the lotus emerging from water, growing from mud yet unstained.

### Hymn of the Precious Moon

One round bright moon in empty space,  
Countless lands’ pure light without hindrance.  
Collected, it does not gather or disperse;  
Before it, no advance, no retreat.  
Neither far nor near, neither front nor back,  
Neither outside nor inside.  
Sameness within difference, difference within sameness—  
Tell me, can puppets understand?

The true empty nature of the Tathāgata, wondrous awareness and perfect penetration, shines upon all like one bright moon in the void; all lands and islands have its radiance. Collecting it does not see the light gather; dispersing it does not see the light open; forward there is no light advancing; back there is no light retreating; illuminating there is no distance; illuminating here is no proximity; illuminating outside is not outside; illuminating inside is not inside. Collecting and dispersing, front and back, advance and retreat, distance and proximity, outside and inside, though illumination differs, the light is the same. Sameness within difference, difference within sameness; all is one, scattered into myriad forms, myriad forms return to one. Spread forth it fills the six directions; rolled up it hides in secrecy; lively and free, like playing with puppets.

### Song of Gathering Pearls

A poor man’s pearl within his clothes,  
Originally bright and clear.  
Knowing not how to seek it,  
Yet counting others’ treasures.  
Counting others’ treasures is of no use,  
Only teaches you to waste effort in vain.  
Better to recognize your own jewel,  
Worth more than gold multiplied by thousands of millions.  
This precious pearl has the greatest light,  
Illuminating the three thousand great thousand worlds.  
Never lessening in the slightest,  
Only obscured by passing floating clouds.  
Since recognizing this Mani,  
Who loves bubbles, bodies, and empty flowers?  
Buddha's beads are the same as my beads;  
My nature returns to the ocean of Buddha-nature.  
The pearl is not a pearl, the ocean is not the ocean,  
Calmly the mind embraces the Dharma realm.  
Let your world of dust fill your eyes,  
Perfect illumination and settled wisdom are always free.  
Not empty, not form,  
Inside and outside bright without obstruction.  
The six supernatural powers and wondrous wisdom are boundless,  
Benefiting self and others without limit.  
See it and be done; all affairs end,  
No learning, no action, crossing all day.  
Calm, as if an unborn infant,  
Moving and resting according to conditions, no fixed rule.  
No ceasing falsehoods, no practicing truth,  
The mind of truth and falsehood both belong to dust.  
Since all dharmas have no form,  
Within no form is the Dharma body.  
The Dharma body is the original Buddha,  
Neither human nor thing.  
Vastly filling heaven and earth,  
Only obscurity and indistinctness.  
Unstained, the light is self-luminous,  
No Dharma arises apart from the mind.  
If the mind does not arise, the Dharma self-extinguishes,  
Thus know guilt and merit have no form.  
No Buddha to cultivate, no Dharma to speak,  
A true man’s wisdom naturally discerns.  
Words roar like a lion’s cry,  
Unlike wild men debating birth and death.

This song emphasizes the line “If the mind does not arise, the Dharma self-extinguishes.” Dharma here is not Buddha Dharma, but the endless thoughts and delusions within mind. If the mind does not arise, all dharmas are empty; the nature pearl is always bright; settled wisdom perfectly penetrating, inside and outside bright and clear; bubbles, bodies, and empty flowers—why cherish them? Dust filling the eyes cannot hinder; no learning, no action; like an unborn infant, moving and resting according to conditions; no illusions of truth or falsehood. The Dharma body always manifests; the original Buddha appears, filling heaven and earth with light shining upon the great thousand worlds; what cloud could obscure it?

### Song of Chan Meditation’s Misleading

The Tathāgata’s Chan nature is like water;  
Its substance is still, the wind and waves cease of themselves.  
Rising and dwelling, clear and always pure,  
Not only when sitting is it so.  
Modern people meditate sitting to gain proof,  
Not knowing it is all in seeing the nature.  
If nature and seeing are clear,  
Seeing toward nature is self-settling.  
Settling becomes infinite wisdom,  
This is called all Buddhas’ supernatural powers.  
Almost to exhaust its function,  
One sees only the ten directions’ empty space.  
In emptiness there is not a single thing,  
Nor is there obscurity or vagueness.  
Vagueness and obscurity cannot be sought;  
Seeking them becomes error and loss.  
Only this error and loss,  
Must not be clung to as proof.  
The original mind is still emptiness,  
How could there be gains or losses?  
Only cast away all dharmas,  
Until entirely pure without remainder.  
Suddenly perfect clarity manifests,  
Then no different from all Buddhas.  
The form body is my fetter,  
Letting light blend with the world.  
All movements without mind,  
What dispute is there of right or wrong, honour or shame?  
Born body is but a temporary dwelling,  
Its lord is called Vairocana.  
Vairocana neither comes nor goes,  
Then know birth and death have no remainder.  
If asked what is like Vairocana,  
It is only that it has form and is not form.  
Before the eyes are dusty affairs,  
Dusty affairs are neither same nor different.  
Seeing this dust and affairs,  
Each is Śākya and Kāśyapa.  
Difference is all sounds and cries,  
Sameness is one wind embracing all.  
If you wish to know the Mani,  
Do not say to know Dharma is to know.  
If sick, use other medicine;  
If healed, what need more medicine?  
When mind is confused, Dharmas are but false light;  
When mind awakens, no more need for Dharma.  
Like a dim mirror ground smooth,  
Marks and stains naturally vanish.  
All dharmas are false,  
Hence leave behind all appearances.  
What if all appearances are left behind?  
This is called supreme truth unsurpassed.  
If you wish to adorn Buddha-land,  
Practice equality, compassion, and salvation.  
Although fundamental vows are deep,  
Do not take into aspects.  
This is the perfect union of merit and wisdom,  
To be first in future predictions.  
Cut off all dust and defilements,  
Then have no connection with Buddhas.  
Thinking again of worldly fools’ delusions,  
All are dyed by dust-love habits.  
Only because of attachment to feelings,  
Always giving birth to womb, egg, moisture, and transformation.  
Learning the Way must be fierce and resolute,  
Heart without passion, hard as iron.  
Even with children, wife, and concubines,  
How different from others?  
Always keep one round light,  
Seeing not desires or thoughts.  
All dharmas at once unattached,  
Why speak of hell or heaven?  
Then my life is in my hands,  
In emptiness neither ascending nor falling.  
Appearing and disappearing in all Buddha-lands,  
Not apart from the original seat of Bodhi.  
Avalokiteśvara’s thirty-two manifestations,  
I too shall certify among them.  
Manifestations inconceivable,  
All arise from the nature of freedom.  
I am the no-mind Chan guest,  
In all things unable to choose.  
Once a black ox,  
Today my whole body is white.  
Sometimes singing and laughing alone,  
Others say I am a spiritual fool.  
Who knows beneath the coarse form,  
Dwells a priceless treasure?  
If you see me speaking of emptiness,  
It is like muddy water swallowing dates.  
This Dharma only Buddhas can know,  
Ignorant fools cannot understand the surface.  
There are also those who cultivate Chan,  
Only learning to dispute with words.  
Boasting my quick replies,  
Yet not knowing the master.  
They seek twigs and leaves,  
Not understanding the root.  
With root the branches flourish;  
Without root, branches cannot stand.  
Still flaunting holding the spiritual pearl,  
Turning about the difficulty of self and others.  
Far removed from my spiritual source and wondrous awareness.  
These are pitiful and laughable,  
Empty talk of years of learning the Way.  
High minded, unwilling to ask others,  
Wasting a lifetime to old age.  
They are fools with dull root,  
Wrong views and heavy karma.  
If in this life they do not awaken,  
How can future generations avoid sinking into ruin?

This song of over a hundred words is only the meaning of the four lines “The Tathāgata’s Chan nature is like water; Its substance is still, the wind and waves cease of themselves; Rising and dwelling, clear and always pure; Not only when sitting is it so.” The Tathāgata’s Chan nature, its substance is most pure, its clarity like water, no wind or waves arise, no dust stains. Whether arising or resting, all is this; not only when sitting is it fixed. Taking sitting as Chan is not true Chan; it is the Chan of annihilated dull emptiness, not the Tathāgata’s Chan nature. True Chan is both concentration and wisdom, wondrous use without limit, mind and Dharma both forgotten, leaving behind all appearances, adorning Buddha-lands, practicing equality and compassion, blending light with the world, arising in dust yet transcending dust, in the world yet apart from the world, not Chan yet Chan, not fixed yet fixed. All those sitting to attain proof, with closed mouths and shut lips, not knowing the master, are wild foxes, confused Chan, confusion making folly; how could they know the nature of spiritual source and wondrous awareness of true Chan?

### Song on Reading the Collected Works of the Chan Master Zudong Zuying

The Cao Creek waters divide into a thousand streams,  
Illuminating ancient and clear present without obstruction.  
Recently students do not exhaust the source,  
Falsely pointing to a muddy pool as the great sea.  
Master Xuedou reached the true intention,  
Great thunder sounds beating the Dharma drum.  
The lion king roars out of his cave,  
All beasts and demons fear and tremble.  
Sometimes singing poems, sometimes words,  
Carefully guiding the lost on their path.  
Words are open and meanings profound,  
Striking jade and beating gold resounding through ages.  
Alas, the lost chase after conditions,  
Yet seek names and numbers of words.  
True thusness and precious appearances originally without words,  
No low or high, no boundaries.  
Neither form nor emptiness, nor two substances,  
Ten directions’ dusty worlds one round wheel.  
Right concentration never divides speech or silence,  
Cannot take nor leave.  
Only when no attachment to all appearances,  
Is the true grasp of the Tathāgata.  
To remove delusions and meet truth,  
If delusions do not arise, truth is also obscured.  
To know that truth and delusion both are not,  
Only then is true mind without hindrance.  
Without hindrance, able to be free,  
One awakening instantly removes kalpa sins.  
Without exerting effort attains Bodhi,  
Hence forever leaves the sea of birth and death.  
My Master lately spoke plainly,  
Remaining in the world as an example.  
Last night I called him to come,  
Pierced his nostrils placing a staff upon him.  
Asked him the foremost meaning,  
He said all words are slanders.

Though this song praises the Zuying Collection, it really transmits true thusness and appearance. The lines “Only when no attachment to all appearances is the true grasp of the Tathāgata” express the central idea of the collection. Not attaching is no mind; no mind means no arising of truth or delusion; no arising means no hindrance; no hindrance means freedom; freedom means the true appearance remains forever, leaving the sea of birth and death. The phrase “Last night I called him to come, pierced his nostrils placing a staff upon him” is the Immortal Elder’s implied meaning. Consider what it means to call to come? What is piercing the nostrils? Calling to come means calling the true thusness and real appearance nature; piercing the nostrils means piercing the mind beyond form and emptiness. To realize this nature, to know this mind, with staff in hand, supporting heaven above and earth below, without back or face, round and bright, clear and naked, radiant and pure, this is the foremost meaning from the West; no need to say more.

### The Understanding of Precepts, Concentration, and Wisdom

Precepts, concentration, and wisdom are the wondrous uses within the Dharma. Though the Buddhas and Patriarchs have spoken, the unenlightened hold attachments. Now briefly speaking, hoping to aid awakening. Their mind and condition both forgotten, one thought unmoving is called precepts; awakened nature perfectly bright, interior and exterior clear is called concentration; adapting to circumstances and responding to things with wondrous use without limit is called wisdom. These three mutually require and complete each other, mutually being substance and function. The three never separate even for a moment. Like the sun borrowing light to shine, light borrowing shining to be bright. Without light, cannot shine; without shining, cannot be bright. Originally precepts, concentration, and wisdom arise from one nature; shining and brightness arise from one sun; one is itself not one, how much less the three? When the three and one are all forgotten, then there is perfect purity.

The Immortal Elder’s explanation has already entered the samādhi of precepts, concentration, and wisdom; his words are brief, his meaning clear. If the learner can practice and hold them, they may directly ascend the other shore. Yet though his words are clear, he fears the learner’s understanding is insufficient, their strength inadequate to advance to awakening origin. Now we add a further note, to aid the Immortal Elder’s leading, from shallow to profound, from low to high, that they may be able.

Precepts are forgetting emotions in conditions, unsullied by all dust. Concentration is utmost sincerity without delusion, unmoving and unshifting. Wisdom is adapting and changing as circumstances require, neither partial nor biased. Able to precept, concentrate, and be wise, the three mutually require each other, by striving returning to nature, blending into one nature, returning to the place of unknowing and unknowing, pure. When one reaches purity, one nature is no longer; what need for the three precepts, concentration, and wisdom? Hence it says all three forgotten, perfectly pure. When arriving at purity, the necessary use of the three is fulfilled; at purity the three themselves blend and transform. Not forgetting the three and one is still not pure Chan concentration. The hymn says: “When mind is confused one must borrow Dharma light; when mind awakens one needs no more.” This means all mind and Dharma forgotten, thus leaving behind all appearances; this is the meaning of the three and one all forgotten, Dharma pure and clear.

### Western River Moon (Twelve Poems)

**The First**

Illusory appearances no longer forcibly extinguished,  
How can the true be sought or hoped?  
Original source, nature, Buddha, all cultivated equally;  
Delusion and awakening how distinguish before or after?  
Awakening is instant Buddhahood,  
Delusion is endless kalpa of sinking.  
If one can in one thought accord with true cultivation,  
All sand-like sins and stains are extinguished.

The original source and nature is Buddha-nature. Buddha-nature has neither delusion nor true thusness. Only because men have delusion and awakening do names of delusion and thusness arise. Delusion of nature gives rise to delusion; awakening of nature returns to true thusness. Awakening true thusness in an instant is Buddhahood; producing delusion is endless kalpa deluge. Delusion and thusness exist only between delusion and awakening. If one forcibly extinguishes without awakening, delusion seeks thusness; how can one see true thusness? The last line says, “If one can in one thought accord with true cultivation, all sand-like sins and stains are extinguished,” making all clear.

**The Second**

Originally without birth or death,  
Forcibly seeking birth and death distinctions.  
Just like merit and guilt having no root,  
Wondrous substance never increases or decreases.  
I have one round bright mirror,  
Always only hidden by dullness.  
This morning polished bright to illuminate heaven and earth,  
Ten thousand phenomena manifest clearly, difficult to hide.

The original true thusness Buddha-nature is without birth or death, neither increasing nor decreasing. Because of dust attachment, there is birth and death, like a bright mirror obscured by dullness. If one can polish away accumulated stains and old attachments, still it is a round bright substance without loss. Using it to illuminate heaven and earth, ten thousand phenomena manifest clearly; what birth or death is there?

**The Third**

My nature enters all Buddha-natures;  
All Buddha-natures are likewise.  
Tall cold reflection shines on cold spring,  
One moon illumines a thousand pools.  
Small as hair’s tip, unrecognizable;  
Large fills the three thousand worlds.  
Height and depth not fixed,  
Square and round no need to believe;  
Why speak of long or short, deep or shallow?

My nature and Buddha-nature, the nine continents and islands, all human natures, no difference; in saints no increase, in ordinary no decrease; like one round bright moon, illumining a thousand pools. This nature can be small or large, high or low, square or round, shallow or deep, long or short. Not falling into signs of big or small, high or low, square or round, long or short, deep or shallow. But common people use it daily without knowing.

**The Fourth**

Dharma, Dharma, Dharma, originally no Dharma;  
Emptiness, emptiness, emptiness, also not emptiness.  
Stillness, noise, speech, silence are originally the same;  
Why bother speaking of dreams within dreams?  
Use within use there is no use;  
功 (功) within功 (功) applies功 (功).  
Like a fruit ripening naturally red;  
Do not ask how to cultivate the seed.

The Dharma spoken by the Tathāgata is actually no Dharma; the emptiness spoken by the Tathāgata is actually not emptiness. No-Dharma Dharma is called true Dharma; non-empty emptiness is called true emptiness. True Dharma true emptiness, stillness noise speech silence, unknowing and unknowable, only following the emperor’s law. What Dharma can be spoken of? What emptiness can be discussed? If forcibly speaking Dharma and forcibly discussing emptiness, it is like speaking of dreams within dreams; how to know the nature of true Dharma true emptiness, still and unmoving, responding and thus penetrating; responding and thus penetrating, still and unmoving—is this “use within use there is no use;功 within功 applies功”? Use within use no use, Dharma is originally from emptiness;功 within功 applies功, within emptiness there is Dharma. Dharma is originally emptiness; emptiness has Dharma; neither real nor false; neither existence nor non-existence; perfectly bright without obscurity; long free and transformed; like fruit growing on a branch, there is a day of natural ripening. This is cultivation of the true seed of Buddha-nature, no need to ask how to cultivate the seed.

**The Fifth**

Good and evil, forget thoughts for a moment;  
Glory and decline no concern.  
Dark and light, hidden and revealed, allow rise and fall;  
By fate hungry eat and thirsty drink.  
Spirit still, serene, always quiet;  
No hindrance to sitting, lying, singing, or chanting.  
A pool of autumn water, green and deep;  
Wind stirs, do not fear or alarm.

The main meaning of this verse is just the two lines “Spirit still, serene, always quiet; no hindrance to sitting, lying, singing, or chanting.” The spirit is still, and good and evil, glory and decline, dark and light, hidden and revealed, rise and fall, do not enter the mind. Following fate through the days, sitting, lying, singing, and chanting, free and easy, without thought or worry, like a pool of autumn water, green and deep. Though the wind blows, there are no waves; what cause for fear or alarm?

**The Sixth**

Do not forcibly extinguish conditions;  
Provisional names temporarily establish Bodhi.  
Form and emptiness, brightness and darkness originally equal;  
Truth and delusion cease to distinguish two substances.  
Awakening is to immediately become the Pure Land,  
No need for India’s Cao Creek.  
Who says Ultimate Bliss is in the Western Heaven?  
Realizing it, Amitābha appears in the world.

The original nature of the Tathāgata is round and bright, clear and naked, radiant and pure. Neither form nor emptiness, neither bright nor dark, neither true nor deluded. Whoever awakens becomes Buddha on the spot; no need to forcibly extinguish dust affections when facing the mirror. Because people mostly do not awaken, Buddhas and Bodhisattvas are provisional names temporarily establishing Bodhi, leading people gradually to sudden awakening, to attain Buddhahood. Bodhi is a flowery word for the true path, meaning return from error to truth, stepwise awakening.

**The Seventh**

Person, self, sentient beings, lifespan,  
Why distinguish this or that, high or low?  
The Dharma naturally illumines, not mine or yours,  
Moment after moment no need to seek.  
What is seen is never truly seen;  
What is heard is not necessarily heard as not;  
All functions never mutually know,  
Who can obstruct your birth and death?

Person, self, sentient beings, lifespan, distinctions of high and low, mine and yours, seeing, hearing, right and wrong, all are false appearances. Being able to see through all these with total illumination and knowing, entrusting to unknowing, birth is so, death is so, birth is good, death is good, birth and death unimpeded, naturally ending birth and death.

**The Eighth**

Dwelling in forms, cultivating giving,  
Karmic results never depart from heavenly and human realms.  
Like shooting an arrow at floating clouds,  
Falling only because strength is exhausted.  
Better to be the formless real thusness,  
Returning to the plain and simple.  
Forgetting conditions and emotions, letting nature be,  
To attain the patience of birthlessness.

The aspect of no aspect is the real thusness. Real thusness does not depend on forms; cultivation and giving, karmic results, are from returning to plain and simple, arising from forgetting conditions and emotions. Recognizing real thusness, every movement and stillness is nature itself, naturally acquiring the patience of birthlessness. The Śūraṅgama Sūtra says: “This person attains the patience of birthlessness.” The commentary says true thusness is called birthlessness, Dharma is without outflow, true wisdom is called patience.

**The Ninth**

If fish and rabbit return to the hand,  
Naturally forget the trap and the snare.  
Crossing the river upon raft and ladder,  
Having arrived, all are abandoned.  
Before awakening, one must rely on words,  
After awakening, words become false.  
Though these four lines belong to non-action,  
Still one must transcend them.

The trap is to catch fish; when fish are caught one can forget the trap; the snare is to catch rabbits; when saved one can forget the snare. The raft is to cross the river; after crossing one can abandon the raft; the ladder is to climb high; having climbed one can abandon the ladder. Similarly words are to distinguish principles; when principles are realized words can be abandoned. Yet the four lines to forget trap, snare, raft, and ladder, though teaching to realize the true nature, belong to non-action and cannot rely on empty non-action to finish the matter. If only empty non-action, how to obtain the ground of true thusness and wondrous awareness? One must transcend this non-action to attain depth.

**The Tenth**

Having awakened, do not seek annihilation;  
Following conditions, attend to the mass of lost.  
Breaking notions of constant and transient, and guidance,  
Skillfully pointing to the actual.  
Five eyes, three bodies, four wisdoms,  
Six perfections and myriad practices cultivated equally.  
One round bright light, fine Mani,  
Benefiting others and able also to save self.

Buddhism places awakening nature foremost; not awakening to empty emptiness. One must return this emptiness to reality; then it is true Buddha-nature. Hence it says, “Having awakened, do not seek annihilation; follow conditions, attend to the mass of lost.” Attending to the lost is the practice of expedient means and merit. The five eyes are heavenly eye, wisdom eye, Dharma eye, Buddha eye, and physical eye. The three bodies are the pure Dharma-body, the perfect reward-body, and myriad transformation bodies. The four wisdoms are great mirror-like wisdom, equality nature wisdom, wondrous observing wisdom, and accomplishment wisdom. The six perfections are giving, precepts, patience, diligence, concentration, and wisdom. Myriad practices are all expedient merits. Cultivated both inside and outside, the true nature is clearer the more refined. Like one Mani pearl, shining brightly, penetrating all depths, benefiting others and self, eternally useful; how can it be only emptiness?

**The Eleventh**

Now I see people speak of nature,  
Only boasting quick replies to tests.  
When encountering conditions, they become deluded,  
How different from fools?  
Speaking must be accompanied by acting,  
Only then is speech and action without fault.  
Able to wield the sword of wisdom to cut the Mani,  
This is called Tathāgata’s right wisdom.

This verse emphasizes the two lines “Able to wield the sword of wisdom to cut the Mani, this is called Tathāgata’s right wisdom.” The Tathāgata’s right wisdom penetrates everywhere, called the sword of wisdom. Because right wisdom can remove delusion and return to sincerity, it is called the sword of wisdom; because right wisdom is perfectly bright without obscurity, present at all times, it is called Mani. Cutting the Mani is not to sever but to take, not to use the light outward. As substance it is called Mani, as function it is called sword of wisdom. Sword of wisdom, Mani, right wisdom are all one, not three things. This right wisdom is not spoken by mouth but must be practiced and refined in body and effort to be true. If body cannot act, only mouth speaks, quick replies to tests, thinking it is seeing nature, when facing conditions immediately confused, what help is there? Hence it says “Able to wield the sword of wisdom to cut the Mani, this is called Tathāgata’s right wisdom.” Saying speech and action without fault is right wisdom; quick tongue and quick answer is not right wisdom.

**The Twelfth**

Wanting to realize the birthless wondrous way,  
Is none other than seeing the true mind.  
True body has no form nor sound,  
Pure Dharma body just such.  
This way is neither non-being nor being;  
Nor in the middle, nor to be sought or sought.  
Both extremes must be abandoned from the heart,  
To see this is called the highest grade.

Seeing the true mind is the wondrous way; no need to seek the wondrous way elsewhere. The true mind is unstained and unattached, unmoving and unshaken, without form or sound, also called pure Dharma body; it is mind, it is body. Neither being nor non-being, both being and non-being do not stand; not to seek within being, not to seek within non-being, nor to take from neither being nor non-being. Since none of the three, then what kind of thing is this? One who sees this thing instantly transcends birthlessness, called the highest grade supreme vehicle wondrous way. True body and true mind are originally one. Speaking of substance is true body; speaking of function is true mind. Substance and function are one, body and mind blended, form and spirit both wondrous, in accord with the Way, not birthless?

### Appendix:

**Reading the Zhou Yi Cantong Qi**

The wondrous use of the Great Elixir is the law of Heaven and Earth;  
Heaven and Earth move and the five elements separate.  
When the five elements proceed, the constant Way produces birth and death;  
When the five elements reverse, the elixir body is always spiritual and enduring.  
One from emptiness and no substance manifests signs;  
The two forces open root because of one;  
Four images do not separate from two substances;  
Eight trigrams mutually beget one another.  
Myriad phenomena arise from transformation and motion;  
Fortune and misfortune, regret and blame are thus divided.  
The common people daily use without knowing;  
Sages can investigate the original source.  
Hence the Way of Yi wonderfully exhausts the principle of Heaven and Earth,  
Entrusting images to this writing.  
Negation and affirmation alternate, so yin and yang rise and fall;  
Obscurity and confusion arise, so motion and stillness are morning and evening.  
Kan and Li are male and female, water and fire;  
Zhen and Dui are the dragon and tiger, spirit and soul.  
Maintaining the center is the yellow robe and great fortune;  
Encountering excess, there is no place or honor.  
Not guarding the beginning and end of all things,  
Again meeting the bright two qi and their running.  
The moon wanes and waxes, responding to spirit’s decline and flourishing;  
Sun rises and sets, matching honor and protection of cold and warmth.  
Originally set words to clarify images;  
Having grasped images, forget words.  
Like setting images to point to meaning,  
Awaken to true meaning then images are abandoned.  
The wise are simple and easy;  
The deluded grow more confused and complicated.  
Therefore those cultivating truth who read the Cantong Qi,  
Do not cling to images or writings.

### Song Presented to Liu the Daoist of White Dragon Cave

Jade runs and gold flies, two luminaries busy,  
First hearing flowers bloom then autumn frost.  
In vain boast of a thousand years of long life,  
Like a flash of lightning in the clouds.  
One flash of lightning, how swift!  
A hundred years are but thirty thousand days.  
Within that time summer and winter torment,  
Unaware the youthful face dims in secret.  
Though children and grandchildren fill the eyes,  
Affection and attachment turn to entanglement.  
When the essence is exhausted and the body decays,  
Who understands to ask you to stay a while?  
A while to stay, having no plan,  
Cannot avoid returning the body to the flowing water.  
But look at sages of old,  
How many understand to keep the body in the world?  
To keep the body in the world there is a way,  
Only now men lack measure.  
All rush to the mountains seeking herbs,  
Subduing lead and mercury to set the elixir on the Yang.  
Setting the elixir on the Yang is a different matter,  
Must seek red blood at Kan.  
Catch the Yin essence from Li position,  
Match and harmonize at the proper season.  
When the season is right, use a matchmaker,  
Golden duke and lovely maiden marry.  
Golden duke likes to ride the white tiger,  
Lovely maiden often drives the red dragon body.  
Tiger comes sitting quietly in the autumn mountain,  
Dragon rises striving in the pool.  
Two beasts meet and fight one battle,  
Waves and billows surge like boiling cauldrons.  
Old yellow man helps the Spirit,  
Shaking Heaven and Earth, chasing gods and ghosts.  
In a moment battle ends, clouds and rain clear,  
Plant a mysterious pearl at the bottom of the mud.  
From this root and shoot gradually grow,  
Irrigate at the proper time, embrace true essence.  
After ten months shedding the womb swallowing the mouth,  
Unaware the mortal body already has spirit.  
This matter in the world is rare,  
Not common people can know.  
If in past lives no immortal bone portion,  
How easily can one encounter it?  
Having encountered it, best to refine,  
All because time swiftly like arrows.  
To catch fish must set the net,  
Do not just stand by the river sighing in vain.  
Hearing you know the medicine many years,  
Why not settle heart to refine mercury and lead?  
Do not let the candle be blown out by wind,  
Six paths of transmigration do not blame Heaven.  
Recently many deceitful people on earth,  
All wearing plain clothes calling themselves Taoists.  
Ask them what are gold and wood,  
They shut mouths silent as if mute.  
They say to subdue qi and rest grain,  
There is another gate and road long.  
Have you not seen in the Song of Breaking Delusion,  
The Great One contains true law best of all?  
Do not blame words as wild and rude,  
Only making it hard for people to discern.  
Only you and I share one heart,  
Only then dare I confide to you.

### Song of the Stone Bridge

My home originally dwells north of the stone bridge,  
Mountain commands water gate with ancient trees dense.  
Under bridge the stream flows through Kunlun,  
Drinking spring from mountain fragrant and rich.  
My dwelling in the mountain is truly proud,  
Everywhere planted are trees not bearing flowers.  
North mountain cave hides a fierce tiger,  
Coming forth roaring, wind and mist arise.  
South mountain pool hides a dragon,  
Rising clouds and rain, mountain misty.  
Two beasts meet and fight one battle,  
Original pearl hidden is auspicious sign.  
Scene to envy, I secretly rejoice,  
Pouring and drinking, drunk in bliss.  
Drunkenly playing a song on stringless lute,  
Lute’s every sound teaches carefulness.  
Alas, after drunkenness none knows,  
Dim and silent just like a fool.  
Looking up at wondrous works of creation,  
Sun returns west, moon returns east.  
Heaven is earth, earth is heaven,  
Yin and yang mix in nature.  
Knowing the place where five elements invert,  
Pointing day rise clouds return to cave heavens.  
Golden house, white jade attendant,  
Jade maiden golden boy attend daily.  
Southern star, Northern Dipper distinctly set,  
Forests of phenomena appear boundless.  
No day or night, must be continuous,  
Gathering and scattering, extracting and adding, all timing correct.  
If asking where is the true cinnabar,  
Seek master to break lead in water.  
Wood produces fire, gold produces water,  
Water and fire must be divided front and rear.  
To distinguish floating and sinking, know host and guest,  
Lead, silver, sand, mercury all combine.  
Have hardness and softness, do not stray,  
Knowing contentment is always contentment returning to root position.  
All spirits together congratulate peaceful year,  
Then the country is rich and people rejoice.  
This matter is easy to reason,  
Fellow Daoists know this meaning.  
Later generations who learn cultivation,  
Only say preservation and nurturing along with qi circulation.  
Before the eyes, very easy,  
Those who obtain it are wonderfully hard to match.  
First cure illness then extend life,  
Use fire to cook and change the Yang body.  
Cultivators, abandon thinking of self,  
Do not inquire of side doors or small methods.  
Only know now fooling people,  
Unaware body becomes dark and withered.  
Urge later learners to be fierce and strong,  
Do not merely abandon home to live elsewhere.  
Wondrous Way does not leave own body,  
How can it be in mountains and rivers?  
Do not procrastinate and be greedy and petty,  
Urgently seek master to find original meaning.  
If in this life do not learn cultivation,  
Unaware of what birth in next life is.
