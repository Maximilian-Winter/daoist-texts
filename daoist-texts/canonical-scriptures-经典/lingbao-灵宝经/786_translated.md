# The Most High Cavernous Profound Spiritual Treasure Scripture of the Natural Course and Measure of Heaven and Earth (Proofread Once)

Title of the Scripture: The Most High Cavernous Profound Spiritual Treasure Scripture of the Natural Course and Measure of Heaven and Earth. The author is unknown; it was composed probably in the period of the Northern and Southern Dynasties. The catalogues of the Spiritual Treasure Scriptures have not yet recorded it. One scroll. Source text: The Cavernous Profound section of the Zhengtong Daoist Canon.

The Dao says: The Most High Spiritual Treasure was born before Heaven and Earth, and then Heaven and Earth came into being. Number begins from One, is established in Three, is completed in Five, flourishes in Seven, and reaches its utmost in Nine. Therefore Heaven is distant from Earth by ninety thousand li, accumulating Yang Qi. The Yin forms of the Dao are arrayed and spread over Kunlun, serving as pillars of the Earth. The Qi ascending through Kunlun is the centre of the Earth. Kunlun extends straight east one hundred and sixty-five million li, straight west one hundred and sixty-five million li, straight south one hundred and sixty-five million li, straight north one hundred and sixty-seven million five hundred thousand li. The Earth revolves four times, covering four hundred and twenty-six thousand two hundred and fifty li.

The Dao says: The sun and moon travel a thousand li in diameter, circumnavigating three thousand li, moving through eighty-one domains, alternately dim and obscure. The Northern Dipper has nine stars; two of them, Yin stars, are unseen. They are separated by ninety thousand li, and they sink to moisten eighty-one provinces and eight hundred and ten domains. The Northern Dipper stands above Kunlun, embracing Kunlun; the movement of Qi pours over the world. In spring and summer it becomes dew; in autumn and winter it becomes frost and snow. Man is in accord with Heaven and Earth. Outside the eight directions of Heaven and Earth, all things receive their natures, all harbour grief and suffering, ever distressing the people, containing blood and writhing, unable to be free, contending with Heaven and Earth for life, all must return to death. Their bones dissolve into the Earth, their spirits soar, turning through the Five Paths. The good ascend to Heaven; the wicked enter the abyss. Whatever good or evil a man does in life, his spirit and soul accompany his guilt or merit. Only those who study the Dao to seek life, reach the utmost course and measure, can thereby endure long, restoring the Yang of the nine cycles.

The Dao says: When man is born, passing through the fetal membrane, he needs to complete ten months; death is like a great wind, sudden and without limit; death arrives without fixed time. One must contend with the heart, do good without doubt. Therefore through the Scripture of the Dao one exhorts the scholars: what the eyes cannot see, the ears cannot hear, the rare and precious things, what profit are they to the body? Those who pursue the Dao must believe the Scriptures and precepts, keep to goodness even unto death, not commit evil and yet live. The Dao cannot be lost; virtue cannot be contravened. To contravene the Dao and lose virtue is like a child born without a mother, like a fish escaping from the abyss. If one is determined to study, revolving through death and birth, like the silkworm in its cocoon, confused and bewildered. Therefore, in a single day the form changes and the numbers alter; the Dao is accomplished in the subtle; long fasting and chanting the Scriptures form the root of virtue; understanding the natural mystery and course of the Dao transcends the divine prescriptions; thus one obtains the honour of the Most High Jade Capital. Then a hymn is composed:

I alone, in my declining years, must endure all diseases.  
Ice melts and fire arises, disasters strike and resolve my form.  
All the bones separate and live apart; the great calamity is about to fall.  
Therefore I fear this pain and seek the Dao, wishing for long life.  
To depart from this dust's encumbrance, to join that utmost stillness and purity.  
High conduct hopes for the great vehicle; naturally studying the Dao brings accomplishment.  
The revolving wheel is of unsurpassed virtue; forgetting self, therefore nameless.  
Calmness and benevolence overcome the eight difficulties; untroubled, what need is there for endeavour?

The Dao says: Life is chiefly precious in man. Since there is life, it ought to be cherished and perfected. Yet men are greedy for wealth and niggardly, unwilling to give or scatter. Serving the Master and Precious in hope of ascent and deliverance, who truly reflects? The body is not possessed by me; wealth and treasure are not mine; official rank and salary are burdens upon the body; how can these benefit oneself? Old age, sickness, and death none can avert. Unable to save oneself by the Dao, one thickly adorns oneself, saying life is enough. It is like a land bird loving its tail, yet at last falling to the hunter's arrow. Those who study must diligently strive in heart to accord with it, knowing these things do not follow the soul and spirit, but only cause distress. One must consider the root of deliverance, cut off the three evil paths, and enter the three good paths: first, not growing old; second, not falling ill; third, not dying. Long life, delivering the world and removing misfortune, meeting the course and becoming the honoured guest of the Most High. Then a hymn is composed:

I reflect on the end of old age and illness, the great afflictions of the three realms.  
Fortune wanes and life nears its end, Qi ceases and enters the coffin.  
Darkness becomes dust and ash, soul and spirit find no rest.  
Therefore I fear this, and study the Dao to avoid premature death.  
Concentrate the mind, preserve the true reality, a gentle heart worthy of regard.  
Cultivate the three treasures' enclosure, naturally subduing the demon officials.  
Therefore I diminish the body by giving, aspiring to transcend the shore of life and death.  
Completely without dependence, eternally preserving joy for countless ages.

The Dao says: To cultivate long life, one sets one's will on ascent and deliverance, seeking the Dao of non-action, the body transcending dust and filth, leaving no trace in the myriad regions. One must first know the great period and number of Heaven and Earth's course and measure, the calamity of Yang Nine Hundred and Six, from which misfortune removed brings safety. If this be not so, though one seek the Dao all one's days, ascent will be rare, and effort wasted, ending in vain labour. Now I reveal to you the period of calamity and fortune, the divisions of fullness and contraction; preserve the body and seek life to summon long life, which is not only for one body, but will restore the seven ancestors to the womb. The Immortal Master says: Those who study the Dao diligently, and understand the time of the Yang Nine Hundred and Six, will surely achieve delivery from the world without danger or calamity. The essential method is long fasting and deep thought, distancing from worldly affairs, forgetting all burdens, then may one expect to soar in flesh. If even a little remains unexhausted, it cannot be called eternal. Seek the True Man of the Great Ultimate and chant these ten verses of the Dharma:

The red script governs Earth,  
Gold and jade again become one.  
Azure Dragon meets Jia-Shen,  
Who can know when it comes suddenly?  
Though the sky and water bear marks,  
The treasure awaits the prince’s time.  
In the midst of the stars a change occurs,  
At the appointed time behold the Hu child.  
Kun the Origin fills fullest,  
Accumulated stones next in disorder.  
The scholar of the Later Heaven sighs,  
Serving Heaven’s appointed time.  
Fortune is not passed in a single morning,  
Seven leaves accumulate the foundation of virtue.  
Peace accords at Mengjin,  
How joyful, how bright and delightful!

The mysterious movement is at the end of the Golden Horse,  
The ancient moon invades the Divine Land.  
On the land no sons remain,  
Brothers wander one after another.  
The children of He and Luo are all gone,  
Yan and Zhao become a flood.  
Jingyang willow follows,  
At the hour of Si the Central Mountain talisman appears.  
Ten years end at Mangzi,  
Wandering among mulberries by the Eastern Sea.  
Better first to enter the blessed land,  
Eight stones to refine the body.  
Willow City is the place of birth,  
The hidden dragon does not delay.  
The Jade Chest is near the mortal world,  
Paulownia and cypress are easy to find.

Dinghai is not said to be far,  
Eight lords gather together.  
Mystery is born amid purple clouds,  
Instructing the nine spiritual sons.  
Before the disaster’s burden is borne,  
Thunder and lightning cannot be stopped.  
Emerging in the years of Shen and You,  
They linger for ten eras.  
At the time of the Water Dragon,  
The Immortal Lord now arises.  
Eighteen sons of Bow Mouth,  
Chanting loudly to coordinate order.  
Hundreds of officials array in ranks,  
Solemn all as leading scholars.  
Diligently admiring the tall pines,  
The calamity ends and self is delivered.  
Ordinary days loosen the belt and roam,  
Every detail records in the collar.

The square plains record the great bird,  
Which will come flying southeast.  
Fools do not see the matter,  
The wise reveal the divine method.  
The borders vanish at the start of summer,  
Venus loses its constant course.  
Clouds and mists all transform,  
Fish and turtles swim the vast ocean.  
Once drowned in the Eastern Sea,  
No longer rising the sons of Shang.  
In the renwu year at the Southern Peak,  
Yin becomes Yang.  
Yangzhou may deliver the world,  
Chanting the chapter of the birth god.

Master Zhang wrote the cries of the swan,  
Knowing the latitude of the Golden Horse’s end.  
Reversing the white, mutual harm,  
Lou Jin cannot loosen the belt.  
Officials and soldiers all flee,  
Bandits increasingly evil and great.  
Though ninefold robes are worn,  
Palace walls time and again decay.  
Thorns grow in the court,  
Princes vanish before robbers.  
Wives and children lost in foreign lands,  
Servants work without respite.  
To display and sell is truly lamentable,  
A thousand years will not meet again.  
If at the end one early studies the Dao,  
One’s dwelling will be amidst the misty heavens.

Cultivate study in all ritual officers,  
Governance must be diligent.  
If not careful in the hundred and eighty,  
When the time comes it is like fire burning.  
Near is the age of the Jin family,  
Thinking on this may be spoken.  
The blades of war rush forth,  
One day cannot be delayed.  
Then the great flood arrives,  
Vast and connected with Heaven.  
Walking corpses are nowhere to be seen,  
The sages know this truly.  
First learn and comprehend the mysterious capital,  
The mind meets the famous mountains.  
Gathering the beauty of the laurel,  
The supreme Dao is the spiritual ancestor.

The capital city tells of brush and ink,  
The blessed land is truly a place to go.  
In the gengchen year the Qiang and Hu move,  
In the renwu year there is a strange reward.  
First must be the blessed village,  
High chants to nurture oneself.  
Ten thousand li look without smoke,  
In the renchen year the disaster not yet passed.  
Once pacified by the Immortal Lord,  
The eight directions cease their nets.  
Like our jade axe’s favour,  
Forever thanking the earthly dust.  
Is wealth worth coveting?  
In the mysterious, absolute and profound contemplation.

Confucius left the bright store,  
The wood face as if having cause.  
Zeng Mountain is a place to wander,  
The nine Yi brush off light dust.  
A humble hut guards emptiness and stillness,  
Mysterious silence deep and profound affinity.  
Springs well without ceasing at root,  
The metal of Mao harms no man.  
The bending blade feels no pain,  
In this world now it harms your body.

The Great Harmony Mountain can be reached,  
Wild Goose Gate its bright truth.  
The Deer Hall is truly precious,  
Harmonizing the people until the renchen year.  
Eighteen already govern,  
The Zi arrives to unite the bright truth.  
The land of Wu has many immortals,  
Jing and Xiang are most poor and distressed.

How can one be close to the Willow Valley?  
Threefold are the merits granted.  
Then you know sufferings and hardships,  
The holy emperors already govern.  
It begins in the renchen year,  
The morning star shines with the Water Mother.  
After Shen remains ten eras,  
Great bird gathers southeast.  
Born in the blood city gates,  
Multitudes of rats climb high trees.  
Too many to stop,  
Women enter the palace.  
Cloud and dragon have no equal,  
Fools say otherwise,  
The wise stand firm.

The Dao says: The Spiritual Treasure’s natural course and measure has the great Yang Nine, the great Hundred and Six; the small Yang Nine, the small Hundred and Six. Three thousand three hundred years are the small Yang Nine and small Hundred and Six; nine thousand nine hundred years are the great Yang Nine and great Hundred and Six. The calamity of Heaven is called Yang Nine; the loss of Earth is called the Hundred and Six. After the Jin family, in the year Jia-Shen, this is the course and measure of Heaven and Earth’s coming and going; the Yang Nine will come; at that time Dao and virtue will be bright, evil and ugliness will be immediately removed, and the sage ruler will receive his commission in the year renchen. These are the ten Dharma verses of the True Man of the Great Ultimate, with divine interest, wonderful and smooth, subtle principles open and clear, the numbers of the period, the essentials of coming and going, which may be called detailed and complete.

The Dao says: If one can constantly chant the profound rhythm, one will be delivered from the great calamity at Yang Nine, and receive office and commission at Ding-Hai. One should first keep long fasting, quiet chanting, silent and free from noise and trouble, then seek to interpret the subtle principles, and issue clear sound from lip and mouth. Then the seven ancestors return to the womb, the self endures long, the course of the Scriptures goes round without harm, receiving immortality and ascending. Wonderful and subtle, not to be declared by words. If you meet this, you will attain the upper course of the Jade Capital, becoming the sage emperor who shepherds the people and governs.

The Dao says: The method of transmission and reception is, as I call the ancient canon, to keep clear fasting for twenty-four days, separately offering five liang of superior gold and a hundred chi of cinnabar brocade, as a pledge and oath. The receiver must reverently observe and carry it out. If he does not follow the method but transmits it wantonly, then the wind blade will examine and punish. The receiver must be diligent and careful indeed.

The Most High Spiritual Treasure Scripture of the Natural Course and Measure of Heaven and Earth ends.
