#### Supreme Limitless Great Way of Nature’s True Unity, the Five Designations Talismans, Supreme Scripture, Volume One

This is the Supreme Treasure at the Purple Star Terrace, the assembly of many true ones concealed in the famous mountain grotto; it is secretly preserved in the shaded recesses of Mount Lao.

Laozi said: At the beginning of chaos, the subtle and wondrous source. Before the opening and dividing, as if there were the Lingbao natural true writings, images before the Emperor; I am the abyssal gate of the Lingbao Great Way, receiving its subtle essence, becoming the spirit of heaven, earth, and man. The five talismans distinguish the pure and turbid qi; I will now depart. The talismanic scripture is secreted in the Purple Chamber, transmitted without end. Ge Xuan said: The Way functions without limit in time.

Laozi said: The Supreme Lingbao was born before heaven, earth, and all things; it rides on the constant formless empty great Way; it moves in the limitless non-action, blending and forming naturally. Inestimable, beyond naming; exalted, with none above, called Supreme. The great all-encompassing, the subtle all-pervading, the principle wondrous and unfathomable, whence come heaven, earth, and man. In heaven, the five stars govern the movement of qi, the sun and moon shine their light; on earth, the five great mountains maintain stability, mountains high and seas deep; among kings and nobles of the Central Plain; in man, the five organs are safe. If heaven lacked Lingbao, how could it shine brightly? If earth lacked Lingbao, how could forms manifest? If spirits lacked Lingbao, how could they enter the dark? If man lacked Lingbao, how could life be obtained? Therefore, heaven, earth, and man, three and five united in obscurity, are one. Hence all things myriad, take me as root, take me as door. Why root and door? I have the Lingbao writings; I go to the Penglai Office to pay respects as a True Man. Entering the bright hall at the center of all heavens, passing through the celestial pivot, ascending the limitless Purple Palace, I bow to the Dao Lord. Descending to govern all things, I come to the Central Plain, secreted in the shaded recess of Mount Lao. The Five Emperors succeed in the throne, not to transmit recklessly; reckless transmission will bring death and calamity.

Laozi said: A serpent obtaining Lingbao transforms into a divine dragon; birds obtain it and become phoenixes; all beasts obtaining it change into qilin; common men obtaining it are called sages. What is meant by sage? One possessing the True Writings of Universal Sage, able to constantly wear them, roams the Five Mountains freely, untroubled in the vast space, changes the five viscera, transforms form and countenance, cultivates essence and simplicity, commands ghosts and spirits, comprehends the ten directions, appearing and disappearing at will, ascending heights riding clouds, journeying afar in clear skies, going to the Penglai Office, paying respects as a True Man, attending court in the Purple Palace, joining with the Great Sage and Revered Spirits in merit and virtue. Formerly the Yellow Emperor received it, becoming the Supreme Yi Emperor Lord, ascending to heaven alongside the Five Emperors, the way of the upper immortals. Those able to keep this scripture, with one heart to nurture it, are named entering the Supreme Golden Gate, styled Immortal True Man.

Laozi said: When a kingdom is about to prosper, cultivate and attain these writings. Men desire wealth, rank, and immortality, able to bring forth Lingbao. When the Son of Heaven obtains it, the phoenix comes in accord, the five stars unite in order, sun and moon shine brightly, the four quarters pay homage, the world is peaceful and pure, evil does not arise, vassals return in harmony, longevity equals heaven and earth, ten thousand generations do not decline. When princes obtain it, constellations shine with radiance, benefiting state and home, rank advances, long life and clear sight continue, calamities are avoided. When ministers obtain it, life lengthens without end, noble rank and heavy stipend, rising to marquis and two-thousand-stone lord. From minor officials to common folk, looking up and down, penetrating spirits and gods, open heart and inner manifestation, anticipating the unforeseen, high office and wealth, the ringed jade chimes. Longevity and increasing years, children and grandchildren fill the halls. When women obtain it, consorts and queens, jade youths accompany, blue sashes attend beside, giving birth to noble sons, countenance like jade flower, longevity like sun and moon, color flowing with the three lights. The Immortal Lord said: From ancient times to now, the supreme Way has been granted to kings; the Way named Immortal is that which is to be encountered in this scripture; reverence and worship surely bring gods and immortals, ascending by day to heaven, kings and lords serve and nourish, preserving body and life, increasing longevity, safeguarding the ancestral temple, stabilizing the state, eternally enjoying great good fortune. My words reach the utmost.

Laozi said: Spirit is the communication of the Way. Able to communicate the great Way to the utmost spirit, commanding myriad gods. Treasure is that which can preserve with heaven and earth; hence called Lingbao. Supreme is the utmost honor of the Way. Five denotes the five (aspects) of heaven, earth, man, talisman, and fate. Profound mystery is the great origin of emptiness and void. Mother of the five elements, hence called Five Designations Natural Talismans. Above corresponds to the five stars, regulating the five measures and alliances; below represents the five mountains; the five elements share the same root; the central treasure is the five viscera; the root of the five paths; the five tones converge. When a Daoist obtains it, the five viscera change themselves, communicating with the spirit of heaven, commanding myriad gods, sitting to cause movement in the kitchen (inner alchemy), riding clouds and dragons, ascending by day to heaven, able to go up and down, transformation without fixed form, at will and unrestrained. The Dao methods are not complicated, secreted in the jade cabinet; be cautious not to transmit lightly. This can last through countless kalpas, eternally without end. The Immortal Lord said: Heaven and earth have their periods of kalpas; the Way has limitless time.

#### Supreme Limitless Great Way of Nature’s True Unity, the Five Designations Talismans, Supreme Scripture, Volume Two

Laozi said: Wearing the Lingbao Five Talismans causes the essence of the Eight Trigrams always to be before the hall’s pivot, governing the Taiwei Huagai above, knowing good and ill at the household within. If you desire to seek the immortal Way, you must first communicate with the Eight Essences. The Eight Essences are the eight spirits below the Way, all knowing heavenly decree. Lingbao always summons and halts the Eight Histories. At home, divide into eight directions and twelve earthly branches, on branches and outside gates left and right, plant all kinds of communicating divine herbs, fourteen in all. Take and paint the Eight Trigrams, make profound cave communicating spirit talismans in eight directions, the Five Designations talisman placed on the central beam in the hall. This causes communication with spirit beings; within one gate, men, women, and children are united in heart, as clear as sun and moon, sitting knowing the four directions, living long without aging, bringing forth immortals. Cleanse the hall for purification, square two zhang four chi, divide equally into eight directions and twelve earthly branches, take talisman seals for fourteen persons. First take the direct gate person outside the hall pivot, forbid hundred evils to enter. Then take the twelve earthly branches, starting from Yin, carve human forms before the hall; those with yang are males, those with yin are females, each placed in the hall. Carve the ground above the branches making pits, level the head to the center. First on the day of spring equinox, fifth Yin day, take orchid and mugwort to make bath soup; by the fifth Mao day, take water brewed chrysanthemum as drink on Yin and Mao ground. On later days, take talisman seals. When taking, clear the surroundings, use small mat as seat, make fourteen places, burn incense, sacrifice wine and dried meat, then bow and recite the spell:

“The talisman seal is born, body honest and chaste, guards the twelve palaces, qi communicates with spirits; now to join with you, jointly united with divine ministers, friends with you, roam the sunny side of such mountain, call upon you to respond, ask you to sing, pact to not deceive, covenant to be allies.”

After three cups of wine, collect offerings. Hold its root carved as human, name separately by sex. At dawn, when the heaven is the Eastern Well star, kneel long before the door, say: “Great-grandson such and such, today’s bath complete, enter the room to place and secure the talisman seal. Until the Five Designations day, each take their brush, write talisman according to day, place on five talismans; after ten days complete, immediately burn incense. On that day, sacrifice talisman seals on the branches. First call by their name, recite: “Such lord communicating with spirits, now with you sharing the same name, after twelve branches and six cycles, shall respond on twelfth day.” After sacrifice, just burn incense, keep in mind eight histories, know their surnames and names, take white flowers, dry and prepare, wear on square dagger, in hall to communicate with body spirit, befriend the histories. Later when heaven is the Eastern Well star, remove talisman, bathe, return to wear. On later days, go out likewise by law. Five bathings total, fill one hundred twenty-four days, spirits all arrived or heard their voices, or seen their forms as charted. At dawn sacrifice under hall pivot, spirits speak with you. The six Jia jade maidens, blue waist winged attendants, all arrived, but do not speak to men. Thus the eight histories first attend; you know human feelings, you should ask eight histories seeking immortal Way for longevity. Histories are persons entering heavenly mansions, registering records, speaking with men. If you previously had no immortal record, far from immortality. Just able to cultivate and serve to bring wealth and rank, prolong life to three or four hundred years only. Only wearing spirit elixirs and golden liquid medicines and stones, this is mistaken with the Way. If you desire longevity, command the eight histories to transform, cause movement in the kitchen with myriad things, then place and arrange designation talismans, keep in five-colored pouch, hang in sleeping tent, take vermilion brush to write in white and plain inks, make eight trigrams profound cave communicating spirit eight power talismans, place before heart to command and use. Always use five talismans and talisman seals, summon eight histories so they cannot leave. The eight talismans command power to restrain and use them only; cannot bring full perfection, only to cause them to stop. Collect and take talisman seal human, each in a leather pouch. Make a bamboo cage shaped like a pot, store twelve persons, cover inner and outer with leather clothes, named Harmonious Tutu Communicating Spirit Secret Chamber, hang in sleeping tent. In morning, bow twice, recite spell: “Communicating spirit such lord, always with great-grandson communing, wish to share today’s history Jia, ride the azure dragon, come and go in the dark realm, today’s words heard by two below the door, follow communications to settle.” When going out, call direct door communicating spirit such lord, do not allow five evil demons to enter jade chamber; allow entrance of immortal Way bright jade maiden, six Jia gods, with today’s person wearing clothes, remembering talisman and history when going out; history follows person’s stopping place. If desire to hide form and change body, wear on left elbow holding history, then walk hidden among men, men do not see. If desire auspicious signs and strange portents, incantation walking person, follow oral instructions for acts, leave at place, person speaks with voice, history makes transformations, nothing not done. This Way once established, myriad things can be recorded, facing and seeing ghosts and spirits, sitting seeing eight wildernesses, able to cause sun and moon, one dark and one bright, able to cause five colors to disorder blue and yellow, able to cause stars and constellations, latitude shifts change fixed course, able to cause five mountains to turn around, vertical and horizontal, able to cause four seasons, exchange yin and yang. Winter grows grasses and trees, summer forms ice and frost, able to cause thunder and lightning, bang and crash, able to cause clouds and mist, dense and flying. When blessings are complete, remove evil disasters, if you can cultivate it, you are honored as immortal king. When transformations have come, all things together communicate, living persons may be saved, short lives lengthened, salvation without end, compassion protecting all beings. Do not lightly oppress all people under heaven, presumptuously acting against the Way, people fearful and trembling, praying to heaven’s gods, heavenly mansions blame men, the Way departs far, be careful indeed. If you make history three years, without offending or violating spirits, though without immortal register, history pleads for person’s fate, able to extend life one thousand years. The Immortal Lord said: Diligently establish good works; when good works reach three hundred, then extend life one thousand years. Good works mean rescuing from danger and saving life. No need to command six Jia any longer. Learning immortal Way must aim for longevity and ascent; deliverance of the world is urgent. Years of life limited; always not serving men, always competing with years, just barely escaping death.

Laozi said: Wear Lingbao Five Designation Talismans entering purification hall, summon six Jia yin and yang gods, likewise according to law, but not together with eight histories. Use hundred day limit, and communicating divine herbs all differ. The six Jia purification method wears talismans by four seasons’ days, within one year complete. Six Jia honored in heaven, five measures are six Jia clerks only. One thousand two hundred forty days, shall obtain six Jia parents, six Jia communicating spirit charts, communicating spirit talismans, treasure register charts, then able to summon gods and command them. Six Jia parents govern persons’ mountain departments and mountain yang lands. Every mountain also has mountain spirits and their mountain departments; only then can be used. These parents have one name Ghost Arrow, one name Ghost Supervisor, one name Lone Shaker. Take their root, root has thirteen leaders; one great leader in center, named six Jia parents, twelve leaders each on four sides on twelve earthly branches, in yang are six Jia, on yin twelve Ding. Bing, Wu, Geng, Ren follow Jia; Yi, Si, Xin, Gui follow Ding; this is yin and yang paired. Take their root, carve as human, as charted. Know their earthly branch entering room, use central character as leader Rigid Saint Lord; six Jia parents twelve persons, all commanded to their original branch, each becomes six Jia. On Jia day, each is offered wine and dried meat. Before on third month third day, take tiger’s head hair, plant in central courtyard, pour sheep and crow’s blood. Again grows six Jia parents, also thirteen plants, below also leaders, color pure blue, juice also blue. Take their juice to write communicating spirit talisman. All writings use their juice. When writing complete, take root, make into powder, in hall, according to day, take well water to wear. Morning wear talisman, noon wear powder, all as charted. After three years, five talismans placed on four walls, Yellow Emperor talisman placed on central beam above. After Way completed, each kept in five-colored pouch, secret chamber. The Immortal Lord said: Those who learn the Way and complete it, heaven and earth spirits, three realms demon kings and officials, all come to serve; why trouble to summon? No need for six Jia ceremony. Those seeking immortality ascend to clouds and the Milky Way, riding dragons is foremost.

Laozi said: Supreme Lingbao, always born before heaven and earth, from original without number of kalpas. Chaos natural, Way true. In Way is Way’s origin, in teaching is teaching’s beginning.

Lingbao in the East is Fragrant Forest Hall, its true man named Entering Diligence, style Respectful Head, governing Zhen trigram, its spirit named Constructing Rigid.

Lingbao below is Water Essence Palace, its true man named Brahma Diligence, style Wisdom Head, governing Five Tone Water Residence, its spirit named Eight Histories. The Eight Histories are heaven and earth’s eight essences, constantly causing communication with spirits.

Daoists and students of immortality and common people’s children, wishing to serve our ten directions true Way, seek immortality and longevity, must wear Lingbao, first summon eight histories, plant communicating divine herbs in refinement houses, palaces, and spirit temples, on twelve earthly branches, according to law wear Lingbao writings by four seasons’ days. On the fifteenth day of first month, or seventh day of seventh month, make Lingbao Five Designations talismans in refinement house palaces, place on four sides and center. Place strictly inside refinement house, on four walls, central talisman on main beam, all concealed, not allowing unusual common people to see. Burn incense and practice rites, bearing the names of the ten directions Lingbao Supreme True Teaching, recite Dao scriptures, wish for high immortals flying in the Supreme Ultimate Mansion, eight histories, characters Clean and Pure.

Wearing talisman one year, ten directions Limitless assemblies and all ten directions already enlightened true men all come fully; eight histories open before you, along with your body light, see true forms; immortal Way longevity accomplished here. Daoists and common people unable to practice law and Way, but if at home have this talisman scripture, carve stones to fix and guard, apply and plant talisman seal, body light will come of itself, causing long life, heart opening and inner manifestation, very like sun and moon, all diseases healed, demons and evil spirits, disasters vanish, suitable for official rank and heavy stipend, money like clouds, virtuous men and chaste women, descendants fill the hall, benefiting all beings, blessings great.

Laozi said: Common people from Son of Heaven down to commoners, originally not Daoists, but having past grace, obtaining my Lingbao scripture, fate all extended. If wishing to use talismans, take five great stones, each of pure color, weight one hundred jin, returning seventy jin or more. One pure blue, vermilion engraving Eastern designation talisman; one pure red, yellow engraving Southern designation talisman; one pure white, black engraving Western designation talisman; one pure black, blue engraving Northern designation talisman; one pure yellow, white engraving Central designation talisman. Each with its writing, to guard the five directions of the house. The five elements generate each other, none harm others, all diseases heal by themselves; five evils and six harms, disasters not normal, each vanishes in turn; officials hold heavy stipend; five soldiers do not harm; wealth and rank daily increase; money like clouds; passed to descendants extending life; children generation after generation.

Paint the Eight Trigrams profound cave communicating spirit eight power talismans in eight directions, plant communicating divine longevity herbs on twelve earthly branches, cause heart to open, penetrate four directions, anticipate the unforeseen, clear as sun and moon. If traveling by boat or carriage, journeying to market, crossing rivers and lakes, entering seas and oceans, repel winds, waves, water spirits, poisons, and pestilences, protect body and benefit wealth tenfold, not encountering calamity, always meeting auspiciousness. Take a bottle shaped like a pot, take five-color papers, five-color brushes, paint spirit talismans inside bottle, vermilion paint outside bottle, make Eight Trigrams communicating spirit eight power talisman. After sacrifice, cover bottle mouth with yellow silk cloth, take yellow material to make tag on top, tie with yellow silk cord, label “Five Stars Communicating Protection Talisman,” seal with “Five Stars Communicating Seal,” place in boat or carriage. Traveling far or near, five mountains four rivers, five lakes three rivers, spirits all come to serve and guard; lands, mountain spirits, beasts, tigers, wolves all come to pay homage. Returning home, place bottle on central beam above. Those wishing to avert disaster, use five stones to guard house, all as above method.

On the appointed day, burn incense, take white flower, dry and prepare, wear square dagger, cause spirit communication and blessings. White flowers are twenty-four names: one named talisman seal fourteen persons, one named talisman bright, one named talisman born, one named talisman herb, one named talisman land, one named communicating spirit bright, one named communicating essence, one named communicating spirit, one named jade maiden, one named family immortal, one named family treasure, one named family mushroom, one named life extension, one named longevity herb, one named palace guard, one named house guard twelve gods, one named night call, one named night song, one named bringing essence, one named Yangming, one named Yinming, one named red mushroom, one named white flower, one named present land. Twenty-four names in all, symbolizing my twenty-four signs, corresponding to heaven and earth’s twenty-four qi; Daoist Lingbao usage. Talismans are fate of heaven and man. If you have destiny, receive my five talismans, together with white flowers cause spirit essence, take care not to reveal lightly to worldly men. If you recklessly reveal and violate heavenly qi, calamity brings destruction to body, affecting seven generations of parents above and seven generations of children below. If spirits inform you to correspond with bone fate persons, every fifty-eight years one emerges, passed to five persons. All commanded to unify five notes in their Gong Shang Zhi Yu Jue, on the day of Eastern Well star, bathe and enter room, burn incense according to five directions numbers: left three, right seven, front nine, back one, center four. Twenty-four days correspond to heaven’s twenty-four qi. I am at center with five stars, beneath five measures, five mountain spirits, all together come to imperial seat; five emperors bestow talismans, recipients live long. Seat two zhang high, center round, all made of heavy silk seats.

On Jia and Yi days, bring three thousand pieces of money to Eastern blessing land, place mat and incense then burn. On Bing and Ding days, bring nine thousand pieces of money to Southern blessing land, place mat and incense then burn. On Geng and Xin days, bring seven thousand pieces of money to Western blessing land, place mat and incense then burn. On Ren and Gui days, bring one thousand pieces of money to Northern blessing land, place mat and incense then burn. On Wu and Ji days, bring four thousand pieces of money to Central blessing land, such as city blessing land, place mat and incense then burn. Altogether use money twenty-four thousand, all self-purified. Burning incense must not mix and seek the five notes. On the day of Heavenly Mansion Eastern Well star, bathe in orchid soup, cleanse body, purification and abstinence entering room to burn incense. First begin East, twenty-four days complete. Heavenly qi harmonizes, passing on five notes. If you cherish money, recklessly divide and lose, not conforming to heavenly qi, or failing to pass as should, heavenly qi disharmonious, five stars do not shine, five emperors do not grant, five mountains do not open, five viscera injured and diseased, calamity brings destruction. The Immortal Lord said: Local county Daoists are mostly poor; now using money and bronze coins to regulate, may transmit scriptures. Disciples must have faith and uprightness, all with reverent purification rites and aid to the poor, must not use privately. Prepared five combined incense to burn, to effect utmost sincerity.

Laozi said: Lingbao is prior to the Way, spirit beings’ constant reliance, all heavens, all earths, all sages’ common ancestor. Profound cave communicating spirit true talisman, Three Sovereigns heavenly characters in great writing, original true scripture, same as Lingbao. Therefore first composed as Five Designation Talismans; others enter heavenly script, thus called heavenly characters, and imperial talisman also. Both may be used for summoning and commanding heaven and earth spirits; all first wear Lingbao and then apply characters to obtain spirits; when spirits obtained, rely on self, not causing harm to others. Without Lingbao writings, how to nurture heavenly truth? Be cautious in application; summoned spirits do not always rely on self, may turn to harm, injuring descendants. Having Lingbao talismans, one must obtain Lingbao charts; charts have twenty-four heads, true qi of heaven, my code of law, true law of the great Way. If you wish to seek Way methods, first bathe to remove foulness, then obtain Eastern Well chart. If you wish to settle five emperors, command mountain spirits, obtain Five Mountains chart. If you wish to communicate spirit laws, first settle eight essences, obtain Eight Histories true form chart. If you wish to communicate five elements, cause movement in kitchen, obtain Six Jia communicating spirit chart. If you wish to preserve five teeth, cause heavenly gods, obtain Nine Palaces Purple Room chart. If you wish to serve Way methods, obtain Supreme Clarity chart. If you wish to serve and obey the Way, obtain Mixed Formation chart. If you wish to obtain communication with Way’s mechanism, obtain West Ascending Register chart. If you wish to communicate Way transformations, obtain Linghua chart. If you wish to tread heavenly Way, obtain Nine Heavens chart. If you wish to escape bodily form, obtain Nine Transformations chart. If you wish to conceal and preserve body spirit, obtain Constant Preservation chart. If you wish to fix body and guard spirit treasure, obtain Containing Shadow chart. If you wish to be serene and preserve unity to keep body, obtain Nurturing Body chart. If you wish to be silent and nourish aspiration, obtain Sincerity and Guard Aspiration chart. If you wish to be pure and white, obtain Mushroom Bloom Jade Maiden chart. If you wish to enlist six Dings, obtain Six Yin Jade Maiden chart. If you wish to obtain immortal register, obtain Ninety-nine Guide Immortal chart. If you wish to eat Way qi, obtain Guide and Lead chart. If you wish to govern Way arts, obtain Profound Cave Great Treasure chart. If you wish to transform, obtain Hidden Measuring chart. If you wish to refine furnace and fix Nine Elixir Gold Liquids, obtain Supreme One chart. If you wish to ascend Five Mountains to seek immortals and mushroom herbs, obtain Open Mountain Mushroom Herb chart. If you wish to protect body form, separate evil spirits and demons, obtain Bright Mirror chart. Having Bright Mirror chart, you should obtain Containing Mirror chart. Altogether twenty-four true charts, my Lingbao. Cave records yellow register chapter, Central Yellow nine capitals writings, each has secret essential scripture, these are my aliases. All obtain Lingbao natural talismans as root source, mutually assisting to form true men. If you can obtain them, surely you can live long, lofty high immortals, flying steps of Supreme Clarity, a kalpa is like a moment.

Yellow Emperor said: Old Heaven, with small omens not yet knowing heavenly qi, thus bestowed Omen Lingbao Five Designations Talisman Scripture. Please according to Eastern Well prophecy, on pure auspicious days bathe and purify, receive Lingbao talisman. On first month tenth day at fixed hour; second month eighth day at dusk; third month sixth day at sunset; fourth month fourth day at late afternoon; fifth month first day at early afternoon; twenty-ninth day at evening; sixth month twenty-seventh day at noon; seventh month twenty-fifth day at midday; eighth month twenty-second day at sunrise; ninth month twentieth day at third cockcrow; tenth month eighteenth day at first cockcrow; eleventh month fifteenth day past midnight; twelfth month thirteenth day at midnight. These all correspond to heavenly qi monthly mansion Eastern Well times, with gods and immortals incense; on these days and times bathe, gods descend on oneself. Bathing in orchid soup means Daoist wishes to communicate with spirits; common people do not need this bathing. Also the supreme method of five stones guarding house, according to “Kaiming Scripture”: “With Lingbao in house, ten thousand years no aging. Lord has Five Designations and Eight Powers, treasures never decline.” Meaning no need again for guarding. Must govern people; without these writings apply only. Also “Jade Note Record” says: “Five talismans, five directions’ designations, true unity of the Way.” Therefore do not lightly place these scripture talisman writings in spirit rooms or quiet chambers, with other scriptures; keep always in tent, also communicating spirit eight talismans commanding eight directions gods. Imperial talisman hard to wear, so separate sacrifices as receiving it with power to command eight gods.

Supreme Supreme Ultimate True Man said: Those who learn the Way and receive this scripture, forty years pass to transmit to one person. Those who have extended life, four hundred years pass to transmit one person. Those who obtain earth immortals, four thousand years to transmit one. Those who obtain heavenly immortals, forty thousand years to transmit one. Those who obtain unspeakable profound supreme true, forty thousand kalpas to transmit one. Supreme Lingbao great method transmission is complete. This scripture speaks of high immortals’ deep void Way completely. Supreme broad teaching is declared, profound and remote words displayed, mysterious true truth, subtle and rare essence, cannot be conceived or discussed. The Immortal Lord said: Therefore through generations all sages have rare sayings.

Supreme Profound Unity True Man said: The Way and Virtue five thousand characters, scripture’s utmost profundity, proclaiming the Way’s intent, correct and true teaching fully. Radiant are the wondrous writings. Recite a thousand days, with empty heart note the profound, in broad daylight ascend to immortality, become Supreme Four Splendours True Man. This is the ancestor of high immortals, also able to bring blessings to seven ancestors.

The Immortal Lord said: Five thousand-character scripture is great, its subtle profundity hard to express in words. Learners’ hearts do not exhaust in glory and splendor thoughts, always preserved within and without, by reading this scripture wishing for heavenly truth, not yet able to see. Talents if like gentlemen, would cause world to know these writings not vain and false. Able to expand subtle words, like lotus born in fire. The body of the Way is utmost truth, six capacities complete, not born nor dying, virtue conforming with nature, flying and hearing through void, body leaving water and fire, yet able by Way to measure men. Fear sea water entering hair pores; lotus born in fire, without meaning it is not. According to scripture warning that supreme Way is difficult to complete, rise with one leftover merit, time after time repairing, like a man traveling a thousand li begins with one step, must through kalpas accumulate good deeds, then naturally can meet.

Supreme Limitless Great Way of Nature’s True Unity, the Five Designations Talismans, Supreme Scripture, Volume Two, ends.
