At the time of the Supreme Dao Lord, at the Cypress Hill Lodge of the Southern Dan Cavern, he bowed and respectfully inquired of the Primordial Heavenly Honoured One: “Considering myself, owing to blessed conditions of former lives, through countless kalpas of fortune and opportunity, I have attained the assembly of the holy and enlightened. Before, I was honoured and exalted beyond merit among the Perfected Ones; further, I was instructed in the three precious divine scriptures, granted the great precepts, and told the Dharma sounds. The joy of passing the grand threshold is truly boundless. Since receiving instruction and encouragement, I have fasted long in the empty mountains, reverently observed the Dharma precepts, and dared not relax or be weary. The Dao work is fulfilled, delivering both heaven and humans; all men and women universally perceive the Dharma gate, their years and lives prolonged, their countries secure. My heart delights in this, with intent not to decline. Having been thus enlightened, I desire to hear finally, without doubt, of the wisdom of former lives, the roots of sin, the secret and weighty spiritual sounds; may I for a moment see the chapter titles? If mercy is granted, and the great words of precepts are bestowed again, then with the light of the sun breaking through the dark night, the souls suffering long kalpas may be uplifted and delivered, reborn in the halls of blessing. The Dao is propagated without limit, beneficial and universally flourishing. What is presented is somewhat broken and scattered; I fear to offend the heavenly countenance, but with an earnest heart I hope for grace to create.”

At that time the Primordial Heavenly Honoured One was about to confer upon the Supreme Dao Lord the “Wisdom Root of Sin Highest Grade Precepts Scripture.” The Five Elder Imperial Lords, Great Holy Revered Spirits, the ten directions’ utmost truths, the celestial immortals of the heavens, the Mysterious Harmony Jade Maidens, fifty-two thousand five hundred assembled beings came in attendance. The heavens scattered fragrant flowers; divine dragons and celestial musicians were beyond number; heavenly maidens held the ten supreme spiritual banners, revolving around the sun and moon’s radiant essences. The divine winds gathered from four quarters, the drifting incense brushed off dust; purple clouds emitted radiance; red mists spread across the sky; the three lights shone together; all the heavens were bright. Rivers and seas were quiet; mountains hid their mists; dragons and qilin leapt; men and gods rejoiced. Life and death rested together; blessings and fortunes universally flourished; the five sufferings were all resolved; the three paths were all restored. Long separated from hells, reborn into heavens, all beings obtained long life. Then the Heavenly Honoured One commanded the summoning of flying celestial gods from the ten directions, to open the nine nether jade archives of the long night’s chest, bringing forth records of life and death, lists of evil root seeds. The flying celestials of the ten directions each spoke of their karmic fortunes, and reported them to the Supreme Great Dao Lord.

The Heavenly Honoured One said: “In the years of Longhan I issued the Dharma precepts to men. At that time the world was foolish and deaf, knowing not the Dharma sounds; they used only simplicity, without malice of heart; they knew not propriety and righteousness, had no lords or ministers; they knew not former lives, nor causal connections. By Dharma instruction they gradually entered the Dharma gate, devoted to faith and direction, free from roots of sin; their lives were all long, without premature injury. After I departed, heaven and earth were broken, no more brightness; men and women turned to ashes, plunged into prolongation and health (illness?), dark and dim through countless kalpas. When the Red Light opened, heaven and earth were restored; I again appeared in the world, called the Nameless Lord, issuing Dharma teaching to deliver the heavenly and human beings. Men and women of that world acted with various degrees of refinement; they were not of a single mind. Those with faith and direction all obtained long life; those who bore jealousy and harm, evil and disloyalty, all had short lives; thus there were roots of sin and fortune. After my departure, one kalpa passed and Zhou flourished; heaven and earth again broken, no more brightness, dark and dim, five kalpas passed. At the first year of Kaihuang, the Spiritual Treasure True Text opened the Three Phases; heaven and earth were restored; five scripts shone brightly. I, in the Supreme Azure Heaven, took the title Primordial Heavenly Honoured One, diffusing Dharma teaching, transforming and delivering the heavens. At the opening of this time, people were simple and honest, tying knots for conduct; their minds were in chaos, in accord with nature; all attained long life of thirty-six thousand years. By the first year of Shanghuang, hearts gradually decayed, fearing decline and fall; the correct Dharma was incomplete. Therefore all countries circulated the celestial texts, proclaiming the heavenly script; all were to enter the Dharma, perfecting their hearts. In half a kalpa, life gradually decayed; longevity was about eighteen thousand years. After I passed away, the heavenly movement hastened; human hearts were broken, plotting rebellion among themselves; jealousy and harm surpassed themselves, contending for fame and merit; they did not believe the scriptures and Dharma; doubted the heavenly truths. Their words said one thing and their hearts another, making laws for themselves; they indulged in licentious worship, venerating false gods; killing living beings and praying to idols. Bewildered and not devoted, harming one another, bringing on their own premature injury. Life was without reason, lifespan without fixed years. Hence there were records of sin, evil seeds, repeatedly revolving through the five paths and eight trials, sinking into the three paths, not knowing the root of life. In dark long nights, through countless kalpas, drifting and suffering in the burning of hell — truly pitiable and sorrowful. Now I must inform you of the precepts for regulating the body, the merits and retributions, the correspondences of sin and evil, the root of life and death. If you can hear truly and practise carefully, widely proclaiming and opening liberation, universally showing the heavenly and human beings, so that all men and women return to the Dharma gate, hold the precepts and fast, keep far from evil sources, so that life and death are peaceful and joyful, and obtain the Dao naturally.” The Dao Lord joyfully listened and received the precepts.

The Heavenly Honoured One said: “If one wishes to secure the body and govern the state, making the households clear and noble, protected by heavenly spirits and respected by earth gods, one must cultivate good deeds, diligently fast and observe precepts, widely bestowing the Dharma gate. Putting others before oneself benefits all things;功 that is universal extends over all;功 full to three thousand, the white sun ascends to heaven; with善 in excess, heavenly clouds descend in carriages. To expand the Dao without end is to attain immortality. This is the fundamental practice of the highest precepts; can it be left unobserved?

First, one must pity the dead and protect the living, rescuing and delivering those in calamity; lives obtain their span without premature injury.

Second, one must heal sickness and cure disease, carrying and delivering the sick and suffering; the body is safe without grievous pain.

Third, one must bestow kindness on the poor and distressed, rescuing those in danger; sacrificing oneself to aid others without stinginess.

Fourth, one must serve the masters and treasures, build peaceful dwellings, widely perform功德 without weariness.

Fifth, one must copy scriptures and correct the texts, respectfully recite morning and evening, offer incense and lamps without negligence.

Sixth, one must cultivate fasting and remember the Dao, with reverential heart observe the Dharma; interior and exterior are pure and empty, no filth or evil arises.

Seventh, one must withdraw from worldly affairs and protect righteousness, not contending for merit or fame, embracing simplicity and preserving innocence, acting in accord with nature.

Eighth, one must proclaim and transform the ignorant and vulgar, admonish and correct evil, all with one heart, revering the great Dharma.

Ninth, one must establish wells and plant orchards in borderlands, educate the young, encourage men to do善.

Tenth, one’s deeds must accord with the law, movements and stillness observable, teachings and regulations conformed to, conduct always thus.

These ten good causes are the highest precept rules. The ten heavenly spirit kings observe them; those who can practise them soar with the flying heavens. Next one should hold the body and be cautious in action. When speaking with men as lord, be beneficent to the state; with men as father, be kind to sons; with men as teacher, love the multitudes; with men as elder brother, be respectful in conduct; with men as minister, be loyal to the lord; with men as son, be filial to parents; with men as friend, be faithful in association; with men as wife, be chaste to husband; with men as husband, be harmonious in the household; with men as disciple, be reverent in propriety; with wild men, encourage farming; with Daoists, correct the Dao; with foreigners, each keep their own domain; with slaves and servants, be cautious in affairs. These fourteen precepts for holding the body are often revered by the four heavenly emperors, universally proclaimed to the righteous men and gods of the four quarters, the common people and all sons and daughters, all to practise these highest grades, sharing in the four heavens’ natural halls of blessing. Those who can practise them are honoured by the four heavens and praised by the earth gods, their rank equal to immortal kings.

Next there are the highest grade one hundred and eighty precepts, middle grade eighty precepts, lower grade forty precepts, along with the Primordial Wisdom’s three grades of rules, compiled as the Great Precepts for Observing the Body, totaling three hundred. None but the highest immortals of virtue, whose bodies penetrate the Three Pure Ones and whose forms enter nature, can observe them. In the last age, men and women’s hearts are to be broken, their conduct lazy and licentious, doubting and divided, pursuing myriad aims; those who keep to the truth are few, surely unable to uphold the Observing the Body precepts; failing to observe them, great calamities must ensue. Now the highest grade ten precepts are compiled, to deliver people widely, open and transform them, let them enter the Dharma gate. Those who diligently observe them obtain the blessings of nature and the Way of Non-action. The ten precepts are:

One, not to envy those superior, nor suppress the wise and bright.

Two, not to drink wine and be licentious, defiling the three palaces.

Three, not to commit adultery with others’ wives, loving greed and subtle craftiness.

Four, not to abandon the weak, old, sick, and poor.

Five, not to slander good men nor attack fellow students.

Six, not to hoard treasures and refuse to give.

Seven, not to kill living beings in worship of the six heavens’ ghosts and gods.

Eight, not to consider scriptures as empty and fantastic.

Nine, not to betray the kindness and righteousness of teachers, practicing deceitful novel learning.

Ten, to be equal-hearted, benevolent, and filial to all.

These ten precepts universally instruct the boundless worlds of the ten directions, delivering all people. Those who observe them have功 registered in the ten heavens, blessings extended to the seven ancestors, lifted out of the long night and nine nether regions, ascending to the Southern Palace. Their bodies enter brightness, their conditions uninterrupted, able to attain divinity and immortality. All conduct is complete; they avoid the ten evils, stay far from blind paths, sever the roots of sin. The ten evils are:

One, drinking wine and lustful desires without end.

Two, secret thieves in the world, slandering Daoists.

Three, belittling teachers and scorning the Dharma, arrogant and neglectful of the three treasures.

Four, stealing scriptures and falsely proclaiming Dao essentials.

Five, borrowing and not returning, deceiving the masses.

Six, killing for greed in taste, saying one thing but meaning another.

Seven, unfilial, betraying kindness and violating righteousness, breaking prohibitions.

Eight, reciting scriptures negligently, speaking carelessly and arbitrarily.

Nine, blaming and expecting others, angry at four kinds of associates.

Ten, cutting off the meaning of scriptures, injuring and adding to the sacred texts, disbelieving former lives, indulging emotions and desires, defiling and neglecting the four great elements, not thinking on the way of life.

These ten evil precepts cannot be separated from the body. Those who violate them suffer many calamities; ghosts and gods harm their lives; enduring myriad pains, never in peace; doing good but meeting evil; all things fail with loss. Upon death they enter hell, imprisoned in heavy locks in the long night, never seeing the three lights, drifting day and night; embracing copper pillars, treading knife mountains, following sword trees, entering boiling cauldrons, swallowing fire and eating charcoal, experiencing all five sufferings, sinking long in nine nether regions, with no time of life. Even if freed, they are reborn among animals, unable to attain human paths. Evil draws evil, good draws good; the correspondence of sin and fortune is like the sun and moon’s trailing light; life and death’s indestructibility is like shadow following form; causes and conditions accumulate mutually, like the revolving wheels of a cart. Now this precept is declared, to protect and deliver heavenly and human beings; clearly understand, truly receive, diligently practise and not forget. If pure and faithful men and women can keep the ten precepts, their strength and resources combined, they desire to be diligent and advance, widely doing good, they may be granted the twelve observances and taught the ten good and fourteen holding-the-body items.

The Heavenly Honoured One said: “Those who study and cultivate fasting and seek the Dao, deliver heavenly and human beings, do all good deeds, ought to observe the twelve observance precepts, and thereby attain deliverance of the world. You ought to follow them, thereby attaining true correctness, finally entering Non-action, accomplishing all wishes. The twelve observance precepts are:

One, see the true scriptures and correct Dharma, deliver all, immediately awaken the Dao mind, desiring that future generations ascend to the great saint.

Two, constantly practise compassion, wishing all universally to see the Dharma, deliver widely and without obstruction.

Three, delight in the scriptures and teachings, deeply and broadly survey, will strong and clear, enlighten the ignorant.

Four, obey and accept teacher’s instruction, widely open exhortations, cause entrance into the Dharma wall, keep far from blind paths.

Five, believe and turn to the mysterious, revere the scriptures and formulas, recite morning and evening without weariness.

Six, do not seek honours and glory, sever causes and conditions, concentrate mind and determination, devote oneself to the Dharma.

Seven, diligently recite great scriptures, wish all universally good, widely open bridges, make good roots for future lives.

Eight, constantly generate good heart, neither evil nor false, without envy or harm, no evil or expansion.

Nine, in the places where one is born, always encounter the holy world, promote the Spiritual Treasure Dharma teaching, meeting continuously.

Ten, keep the body pure and observe precepts, cultivate fasting and build功德, widely save living beings, all to attain liberation.

Eleven, study broadly, proclaim the equal Dharma, foretell heavenly and human beings, universally cause deliverance.

Twelve, always be with bright teachers, meet them lifetime after lifetime, receive instruction and propagate, deliver countless people, all good hearts attain Dao truth.

The Heavenly Honoured One said: “The method for scholars to regulate conduct is to observe the twelve observance precepts. If with one mind they act on these good thoughts, generation after generation they meet the saints, bind themselves to the Dao, befriend heavenly beings, stand alone in the three realms, without hindrance, long freed from the three evils, five paths, and eight trials; spirit and brightness respectfully protect, earth gods guard, households pure and solemn, ten thousand calamities do not afflict—they may be said to sit upright and attain the Dao. Diligently practise and recite, widely proclaim to fellow students, all so that all equally enter the Dharma gate.”

At that time, the Heavenly Honoured One finished speaking the precepts. The Supreme Dao Lord, the ten directions’ utmost truths, the boundless great saints, and the High Mysterious Perfected Ones joyfully made ritual obeisance, all facing east bowed with heads to the ground. The Supreme Dao Lord advanced, knelt long, and addressed the Heavenly Honoured One: “The assembly of perfect ones sitting and hearing the Dharma sounds, the heavens leap and rejoice, the joy is beyond measure. The great Dharma having flourished, universally delivering heavenly and human beings, the men and women of future lives will receive this grace. Yet seeing the world foolish and deaf, not perceiving the root of life, not knowing sin and fortune, whence they come, though enlightenment is given, many do not believe. The instruction having been given, I hope the imperial grace will universally grant that all the people of the boundless worlds of the ten directions, male and female, at the same time awaken, see the karmic causes of former lives’ good and evil, sin and fortune retribution, know the root of life, and the whole heaven be saved; the Dharma teaching daily flourishing.”

Then the Heavenly Honoured One emitted majestic radiance, penetrating inside and out, illuminating the ten directions; no darkness nor hiding, boundless and infinite; at once bright as before one’s eyes. These men and women were all the good people of the heavenly halls of blessing above the heavens, free and effortless, joyful and natural. Below, the nine nether earth halls of the long night were seen, prisoners doing labour, hungry ghosts and beasts, drifting and suffering souls, their heads and bodies shorn, no longer having forms; imprisoned in heavy locks, seeing no three lights. The common men and women all saw the karmic roots of sin and fortune, the causes of good and evil retribution; all were trembling and fearful, suddenly returning their hearts, revering the great Dharma, practising all good, submitting to the Heavenly Honoured One, obeying and holding the precepts, no longer turning back; blessings and virtues universally spreading; joy unspeakable, happiness beyond bearing. The great saints of the heavens all praised this goodness, and thus composed a hymn:

The ten heavenly wheels revolve in emptiness,
Life and death return from within.
Good and evil each produce roots,
Causes correspond without loss.
In former times saw pure faithful men,
Therefore attained ten heavens’ flight.
Surveyed the nine nether long nights,
Suffering souls climb mountains weeping.
Long rivers cannot be blocked,
Knife mountains cannot be turned.
Revolving in the five paths,
Sorrow pierces man’s breast.
The Heavenly Honoured One spoke the precepts,
The long night was opened wide.
All heavens rejoiced together,
Such joy is hard to share.

The Heavenly Honoured One said: “Now I command the heavenly spirits of the ten directions to speak the records of sin, proclaim the Dharma sounds, awaken the multitudes, enlighten heavenly and human beings, good men and good women. Let them know the roots of sin in their conduct and bodies, that causes and conditions do not cease, disasters correspond and follow one another, drifting through the three paths and five ways, souls and forms suffering, countless kalpas without return. Therefore this precept is spoken, to lead into the Dharma gate, open and liberate the nine nether regions, extract the roots of suffering, that the living may see the Dao, the body be freed from eight trials, the dead rejoice, ascend to heaven, be reborn among men, turn the wheel of holy kings, life and death celebrating peace, generation after generation enduring. Foretelling the faith and turning, all should diligently keep the precepts and fast, thereby attaining true Dao, cautiously acting and diligently cultivating, earnestly receiving and not forgetting, able to harmonize with the great Dharma, then they should listen submissively.”

Flying celestial beings of the Eastern Ultimate World said: “In the Eastern Boundless World, countless beings who have attained the Dao in past lives and those not yet attained but now enjoying blessings, good men and good women, observe the Wisdom Highest Grade Ten Precepts, their功德 and blessings full, attaining flight through the void, flying by day, driving the dragon chariots of light, ascending to Jade Clarity, roaming the Eastern Extreme Nine Qi heavens. Those not yet attained the Dao are born rich and honoured, their rank respected by men, their lives long, without premature injury. The Eastern Azure Emperor’s record is filed and reported to the Nine Qi Heavenly Officials of the Nine Qi Heaven, who report to the three officials of the East, the nine offices, and the earth prisons. The Azure Origin’s jade archive of the long night’s chest erases the karmic roots of former lives’ sins. The Azure Heaven’s Registrar records in the heavenly immortal registers; the seven ancestors all ascend to heaven, clothed and fed naturally, born again annually in the emperor’s gate, joyous generation after generation, causes and conditions uninterrupted, thus possessing roots of faith.

The Supreme Dao Lord asked the flying celestial of the Eastern Ultimate World: “I have once traversed the heavens and went out the Eastern Gate, and saw within the Eastern Boundless World’s hells common men and women bearing punishments, enduring all pains, their bodies wasted and emaciated, suffering poison and hardship beyond words. Seeing them I was sorrowful. Those exiled for several years should obtain liberation, return to human world, returning bad causes. What功德 should such ones make to sever this grudge and attain liberation, returning to good gate?”

The flying celestial of the Eastern Ultimate World said: “The evil sins they committed are recorded in the jade archive of the long night’s chest of the nine nether regions. The Nine Qi Heavenly Lords and the Azure Spirit Officials of the Three Realms count and compile their lists. According to the regulations of the Mysterious Capital Jade Maiden of the Azure Upper Palace Left Official, after ninety thousand kalpas they return, born not in human paths, but rotate for nine hundred million kalpas. Heaven and earth’s numbers are extreme; they become servants of the Nine Rivers. Such hardship is beyond speech. To attain deliverance, sever evil causes, one should depend on the Bright True Jade Archive’s female Azure Upper Palace formula; with azure patterned silk ninety feet long, or nine feet, and a golden dragon emblem, go to the Eastern Nine Qi Heavenly Lord and the Eastern Spirits Officials of the Eastern District; in the nine nether regions, redeem the suffering souls and sever their roots of sin. Nine days and nine nights, bright lamps and incense burning, bow first to the heavenly lord; below the nine nether regions, they may see the light, obtain liberation, return to good causes; for nine years they are all born again in the human world, generation after generation joyous, endless blessings.

Flying celestial beings of the Southeastern World said: “In the Southeastern Boundless World, countless beings who have attained the Dao in past lives and those not yet attained but now enjoying blessings, good men and good women, observe the Wisdom Highest Grade Ten Precepts,功德 full and blessings complete, recorded in the Supreme Clarity; some rise to the Highest Saint, some become immortals, roaming the Five Mountains, riding dragons and riding the void; appearing in the world as teachers and patriarchs, worshipped by myriad surnames, reverenced in the three realms; households pure and noble, blessings endless. The Southeastern Earth officials all file their names and report to the Brahma Qi Heavens. The Brahma Qi Heavenly Officials report to the Southeastern three officials, nine offices, and one hundred and twenty departments; they erase the Yellow Origin’s jade archive of the nine nether long night’s chest karmic roots of former lives. The Brahma Heaven Registrar records in the Brahma Heaven immortal registers; the seven ancestors all obtain liberation from the three paths, ascend to heaven, roam the halls of blessing. For twelve years all are reborn at the gate of blessings and virtues in royal families, generation after generation joyous, rotating causes, thus attaining flying immortals.

The Supreme Dao Lord asked the flying celestial of the Southeastern World: “I have once traversed the heavens and went out the Southeastern Gate, and saw within the Southeastern Boundless World’s hells common men and women bearing evil retributions, suffering poison and hardship beyond words, seeing them I was sorrowful and full of pity. Punished for several years, they should obtain liberation and be pardoned, reborn in the human world, taking shape. Such ones, what功德 have they, to attain liberation and return to good causes?”

The flying celestial of the Southeastern World said: “Those who have acted thus have sins of cruel rebellion, recorded in the jade archive of the long night’s chest of the nine nether regions. The One Qi Heavenly Lords and Brahma Qi Spirit Officials of the Three Realms compile their sin records. According to the regulations of the Mysterious Capital Jade Maiden of the Azure Middle Palace Official, after ten thousand kalpas they return, born in lowly births, bearing six extremes, sometimes disabled, sometimes born with disease, rotating for one hundred and twenty thousand kalpas innumerable, then becoming servants of the Eastern Mountain. Their hardship is beyond speech. To attain redemption and return to good causes, one should depend on the Bright True Jade Archive’s female Azure Middle Palace formula; with yellow patterned silk one hundred and twenty feet long, or twelve feet, and a golden dragon emblem, go to the Southeastern Brahma Qi Heavenly Lord and Southeastern Spirits Officials; in the nine nether regions redeem the sinful souls. Twelve days and twelve nights, bright lamps and incense burning, bow first to the heavenly lord; they may attain liberation, see the light; for twelve years all are reborn at the gate of blessings and virtues, generation after generation joyous, enjoying endless blessings.

[The text continues in like manner for the Southern, Southwestern, Western, Northwestern, Northern, Northeastern, Lower, and Upper worlds, describing the sins, punishments, redemption methods, and blessings of beings in those directions, each with their respective heavenly officials, karmic records, durations of punishment, and prescribed rites for deliverance.]

The Supreme Dao Lord joyfully performed rites and addressed the Heavenly Honoured One: “Today the assembly gained hearing of the ten directions’ flying celestial gods speaking of the roots of sin and their deliverance, the living delivered, the dead returned, within the nine nether realms universally receiving light. Men and women of future lives with good hearts and faith shall obtain their blessings, generation after generation, their delight uninterrupted; bodies attaining immortality, incense and lamps offered, households flourishing, the three realms guarding, myriad spirits bowing at the gate, ghosts tested and subdued, a thousand calamities not afflicting. The great Dharma is open and flourishing, unending through kalpas; blessings vast and majestic, sublime beyond measure. Rejoicing in future lives receiving this great grace, unable to contain joy, they composed this hymn.”

Supreme Wisdom Long Joy Hymn

In the years of Longhan many pure folk,
Mixed hearts all natural.
The five passions do not contend,
Forms have immortal spirits.
The dragon gate breaks the long river,
The three paths do not bind men.
Rest in the five paths’ grounds,
Cease the knife and sword mountains.
Vast within the original Longhan,
No suffering souls in the nine nether.
No sound of weeping corpses,
Only words of long joy.
No sight of long night ghosts,
Only flying celestial immortals.
What joy delights in this world,
Hence recite the joyful chapters.
The heavens bow and celebrate,
Together praising the kalpa’s year.
The Mysterious Capital’s seven treasured forests,
The ten heavens’ universal Pumiro.
Purple smoke views spiritual radiance,
Cloud vistas admire the jade peaks.
Above there are halls of blessings,
Palaces interspersed unevenly.
All are pure faithful men,
True immortals flying to the heavens.
The three realms share the mysterious road,
The five paths clear, not evil.
Good roots arise from causes,
Accumulated功德 enjoy much blessing.
Linked by cause and effect,
The great Dharma surely is true.
No man lives ten thousand years,
All share the kalpa’s ancestry.
Deep joy in this world,
Voicing words of celebration.
This world views the boundless,
How shall the future fate be?

The Supreme Dao Lord, at the Cypress Hill Lodge of the Southern Dan Cavern, having received the precepts, saw the heavenly halls of blessing and countless karmic roots of kalpas, all free and effortless, clothing and food natural, bodies radiant, companions of flying immortals, without sorrow or grief, ignorant of suffering and hardship; seeing this he was moved to compose the Long Joy Hymn.

Supreme Wisdom Suffering Spirit Hymn

Born into the realm of suffering spirits,
Rotating through the five paths’ courts.
Nine nether closed long nights,
Countless kalpas without light.
Knife mountains full of sword trees,
Poisoned blades sharp and towering.
No flock of birds gathered,
Only the cries of suffering souls.
Returning winds shake long branches,
Mourning sounds flow through cold courts.
Above are the mountain-walking men,
Without pause at any hour.
Hungry eating twisted spring coals,
Thirsty drinking refined fire essence.
Drifting through the three paths,
How know form and name?
Remembering you know not fate,
Sorrowful indeed, hurting men’s hearts.
Sin and fortune each arise from causes,
Good and evil surely from the heart.
Rotation never ceases,
Like sounds that never end.
The nine nether hold original records,
Countless kalpas seek each other.
Cold ice without bound source,
Long nights amongst heavy shadows.
No halls of blessings seen,
Only forests of poor ghosts.
Long rivers hardly blocked,
Suffering souls climb ridges and chant.
A solitary voice goes to a final sword,
A mournful cry falls on knife peaks.
This form is no longer form,
Painful indeed, hurting man’s heart.

The Supreme Dao Lord went out the eight gates, saw the many hells, enclosed in heavy locks, the three rivers, nine rivers, knife mountains, sword trees, prisoners, hungry ghosts, punished dead souls, drifting and suffering, no longer having form, unbearable to see; seeing this he was sorrowful, hence composed the Suffering Spirit Hymn.

The Heavenly Honoured One said to the Supreme Dao Lord: “Today, together with the ten directions’ utmost truths, boundless great saints, we are born in one kalpa, joy beyond description, words unable to exhaust, heart unable to express. Speaking of good and evil, prohibitions and laws, nothing concealed; all heavens rejoice together, proclaiming Dharma sounds, universally delivering countless beings. How fortunate this life, encountering this scripture and teaching, spontaneously generating good hearts, life prolonged, no violent premature death; at the final day of return, directly ascending heaven, causes and conditions unbroken, all attaining true Dao. I think of the future last age men and women, all following the course, hearts pressing and urgent, unconsciously sinning; roots of sin arise, falling into the five paths, losing the road of faith, no return time; going back and forth through the three paths, five sufferings, knife mountains, sword trees, blood flying ten thousand li, endless cold ice, poor souls filling the night, wailing long and sorrowful, lamenting and hurting men. Pity these unfortunate ones who cannot return. Now therefore this scripture is spoken, for future generations of faith and turning, opening ways and bridges, universally causing removal of evil root causes, bodies entering brightness, returning to good causes. Wholeheartedly revering and observing, they shall obtain blessings; those without faith and turning shall obtain calamities. After I depart, this text shall return to the Great Luo’s Seven Precious Mysterious Terrace Purple Micro Palace. As the Bright True Mysterious Law, after forty thousand kalpas it shall be practised in future worlds, teaching and delivering heavenly and human beings. Now I thus announce, clearly understand it.” At that time all the saints and the Supreme Dao Lord rejoiced, made ritual obeisance, and withdrew.
