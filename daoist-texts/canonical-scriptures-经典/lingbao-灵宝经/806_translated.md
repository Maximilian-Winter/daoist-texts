## The Supreme Cavern Mysterious Spirit Treasure True Unity Admonishing Dharma Wheel Sublime Scripture

The Supreme Exalted Profound Supreme Polarity Three Officials Dharma Master Mysterious True Unity Perfected One said: "The Supreme Cavern Mysterious Spirit Treasure True Unity Admonishing Sincerity Dharma Wheel Sublime Scripture," the ancient text preserved in the Supreme Six Harmonies Mysterious Terrace. The canonical texts are all Dragon Flower Jade Maidens, Golden Dawn Jade Youths, scattering blossoms and burning incense, guarding the spirit writings according to the method of transmission once in forty thousand kalpas. The Most High has decreed that it be entrusted to the Supreme Polarity Left Immortal Elder.

The Supreme Polarity Left Immortal Elder, in the quiet fasting chamber on Mount Tiantai, purged his sins, burned incense and confessed, contemplating the truth and meditating on the Dao. Within one hundred days, the divine spirits appeared, their forms resembling clouds in the void above the mysterious space; their radiance glorious and brilliant, now manifest, now hidden, sometimes dispersed, sometimes united, reflecting and bending about the fasting hall. The Immortal Elder himself felt deep suffering and distant inspiration of celestial truth; then he diligently pondered the mysterious task, his resolve exceedingly earnest. Within less than a year of fasting, he was thereby moved to communicate with the august transcendent sages who descended, bending into the secluded chamber. On the night of the Gengyin day of the first month of the prime month, suddenly appeared flying clouds and cinnabar heavens with eight wondrous jade chariots, treasure canopies shining within caverns, flowing brilliance of utmost void. Incense was burned and flowers scattered, floating in the air they came. A thousand chariots and ten thousand riders, celestial truth shining with splendour beyond naming. Dragons flew, phoenixes sang melodiously, lions and white cranes gave voice in harmonious song. Immortal children and jade maidens, each numbering in the tens of millions, grasped the staffs to command demons, ten unparalleled flower banners, teams of four steeds and scaled riders, flourishing spirit pavilions — all at once, the celestial truths descended together. The first proclaimed himself the Supreme Profound True Unity First Perfected One Yuluo Qiao; the second, the Supreme Profound True Unity Second Perfected One Guang Miaoyin; the third, the Supreme Profound True Unity Third Perfected One Zhen Dingguang. The Three Perfected Ones gathered, each with a circlet of round light upon their necks, illuminating the ten directions, each seated upon golden brocade mats, attendants on left and right holding flower banners, burning myriad fragrant incense, holding aloft azure-green tables and eight-coloured scarves. They requested the "True Unity Admonishing Dharma Wheel Sublime Scripture," banners of flying brocade and seven jewels tasselled, the mysterious covered scripture above, the spirit truths blazing in supreme emptiness. Then the Immortal Elder bowed and worshipped; the Celestial Venerables, mysteriously weighty, he dared not make himself manifest, only with joyful heart and glad spirit he humbly listened to the admonishing words.

The Supreme Profound True Unity First Perfected One Yuluo Qiao said to the Supreme Polarity Left Immortal Elder: "Thou hast accumulated kalpas in thought and conduct, sacrificing thy body to save beings, opening the path to deliver living things, extending grace even to grass and trees, entrusting thyself to forests and hills, maintaining feeling and patience, revering and respecting thy teachers and ancestors without weariness or limit, enduring hardship with resolute zeal — thus hast thou attained highest virtue, reaching the Purple Orchid Terrace, Golden Gate of Supreme Clarity Palace, where jade writings in purple characters declare thy merit majestic, thy conduct in accord with the Supreme Immortals. The Most High commands the Supreme Polarity Perfected One Xu to come and confer upon thee the rank of Great Dharma Master of the Three Caverns. Now also commands me to come as thy first degree master; thou mayest sit again, and I will instruct thee in the essentials of the Dharma Wheel for opening deliverance, admonishing and instructing, so that thou mayest know of past karmic fate, former sins and merits, and present retributions. Wilt thou listen without desire? If thou canst receive it, then be silent and hearken."

The Supreme Profound True Unity Second Perfected One Guang Miaoyin said to the Left Immortal Elder: "Thou hast turned the wheel of birth and death, bound with goodness, passing through kalpas and times without cease, renouncing honours and emoluments, casting thyself into secluded hills, enduring hunger, cold, and desert, meditating on the Dao without words, revering and adoring the treasure of teachers, ever as before facing the spirits, with gentle and kind heart, sitting and rising joyfully, fasting long and thinking bitterly, never ceasing in that interval, spirit keen and distant; therefore hast thou been marked as one of Supreme Clarity. The Most High commands me to be thy second degree master, and I shall fully declare to thee the essentials of admonition on the three roads and five miseries of birth and death, the root of life, so that thou mayest know the sufferings of soul and spirit, whence they come. Wilt thou desire to hear? I shall speak to thee, and thou shalt receive it."

The Supreme Profound True Unity Third Perfected One Zhen Dingguang said to the Left Immortal Elder: "Thou hast in seven generations had grace, cutting off speech to save the poor, kindness extending to birds and beasts, blessings flowing to descendants, moistening and sprinkling upon thy person. Thou hast also accumulated diligence, personally serving the treasured masters, cold without thought of furs, hungry without neglecting thy mouth, enduring hardship in forest hills, focusing thy mind without shifting, storing the purple treasury to receive the true, a wondrous light arising about thy neck. Thus the highest exalted descended, bestowing the rank of Immortal Minister in reward for past merit—how majestic indeed! The Most High now commands me to be thy third degree master, and now I shall declare to thee the infinite essentials of sublime penetration, spirit transformation, entry into meditation, admonishing and instructing; wilt thou accept and follow? I shall explain it; thou close thy mouth and cultivate accordingly."

The Supreme Profound True Unity Perfected One said: "Heaven and Earth were established, Primordial Beginning divided and distinguished; Yin and Yang opened and transformed; the Five Elements arranged in order. There is no highest nor lowest; no heaven nor earth; no great nor small; within colour, beyond form; all receive the void and cavern, taking qi as their root. The root was born of the beginning; the beginning was born of the origin; the origin was born of the mystery; these three gave birth to myriad things. None do not succeed one another; the framework extends to the eight extremes, securing the lasting continuance of heaven and earth. The myriad perfected high immortals, in the ten directions having attained the Dao, from the boundless worlds of dust and sand, have come forth as perfected ones through countless kalpas; none without teachers. All follow teachers and receive the Supreme Clarity Three Caverns Treasured Scriptures, and thereby become high immortals and supreme sages, teachers of the ten directions. A teacher is a treasure. Without a teacher there is no learning; the Dao cannot be accomplished; without teacher it does not proceed; without teacher one cannot be born; without teacher one cannot be delivered; without teacher one cannot become immortal. Therefore the teacher is my father. If thou dost not love thy teacher, the Dao will not descend; demons will spoil thy body; the eight wondrous dragon chariots, how canst thou drive them? The Supreme Polarity Jade Gate, how canst thou ascend it? The Confucian teaching has the three tombs and five canons, eight cords and nine mounds, all to instruct the literary men; still they follow the teacher to attain understanding. How much more is this so with thee, who now study the Dao of Supreme Clarity, hoping to ascend and enjoy eternal and boundless blessings? Neglecting the teacher and practising the Dao, seeking the fleshly flight, thinking to throw oneself into night light, is to lose thy one journey. But thou hast accumulated diligence through kalpas, unweary and unceasing; when thy merit is full and virtue accomplished, the jade writings in purple characters will be recorded on the Mysterious Terrace, and thy rank will ascend to the office of Supreme Polarity Immortal Elder. But if the three masters be not complete, the admonitions not full, and the precepts not attained, how canst thou readily enter the palace of Supreme Polarity? The Most High, seeing thy lofty past merits, therefore commands us to be thy three masters, to deliver to thee the essential instructions, so that thou mayest speedily attain flight through the three realms, roam the Supreme Clarity, thy person reach the Golden Gate, and receive the title Immortal Elder. The Immortal Elder answered humbly, accepting the instruction; only praying the Celestial Venerable to pity and have compassion, now to explain it, and he would receive it."

The Supreme Profound True Unity Perfected One said: "The 'True Unity Admonishing Sincerity Dharma Wheel Sublime Scripture' issues by command from the Nine Heavens once every forty thousand kalpas. The Supreme Void Sovereign formerly transmitted it to the Supreme Great Dao Sovereign, who transmitted it to the Supreme Micro Heavenly Emperor Sovereign, who transmitted it to the Later Sage Golden Gate Supreme Emperor Sovereign, commanding it be entrusted to the Immortal Ministers, Immortal Elders, and Immortal Kings who are already perfected ones, but not transmitted to the middle immortals and the various immortals of the Five Sacred Mountains. Without the Mysterious Name Imperial Chart, recording the Three Pure Ones Supreme Polarity Jade Writings, none but the Immortal Elder's lineage may hear or see it. This scripture is exceedingly marvelous and treasured by the Most High, preserved inside the Six Harmonies Purple Chamber, guarded in secrecy by immortal children and jade maidens. One who sees its title will celebrate and prolong the seven ancestors, souls dying and being born in heaven, blessings covering one’s lineage, gates flourishing, and the world issuing forth worthy and wise men. He who cultivates it will attain cloud chariots and dragon carriages, flying in the broad daylight. If one leaks or acts carelessly, slanders the sacred writings, one’s body will be punished and examined, sins and merits correspondingly rewarded or punished: be cautious and prudent."

The Supreme Profound True Unity Perfected One said to the Immortal Elder: "In the past I received from the Supreme Limitless Great Dao Sovereign the 'True Unity Admonishing Dharma Wheel Sublime Scripture.' Practising and serving the master, I burned incense six times daily, in the morning saluted with revolving steps. First I saluted my master, with heart present and eyes viewing, seeing the master as the scripture; if I had no master, the scripture would not be seen. Once I obtained the scripture, the master was present before me, enduring hunger and thirst, following the master east and west. I received the master’s instructions, earnestly attending to all the scriptures, the pain like knife cutting, the endurance like poison needles, bowing and lifting in service, always undaring to fail, pain not dared to complain, poison not dared to mention. Thus passing through four hundred million years, the true Dao was attained, and my rank rose to the Supreme Profound True Unity Perfected One. Now again I am ordered by the master to be thy three degree masters. Canst thou be as I? If thou canst be as I, I shall then explain the scripture to thee."

The Immortal Elder bowed and thanked, reporting to the Supreme Profound True Unity Perfected One, his three degree masters: "This disciple is fortunate to gaze upon the celestial countenance, to receive master’s instruction, and once more to be taught the essential words, in infinite measure, not small words to be expressed. Considering my own root and condition, born into the path of law, somewhat fond of the Supreme Dao, yearning for spirits and immortals, fasting long in secluded hills, meditating upon the supreme sages, not yet enlightened to the Celestial Venerable, gazing into the secluded valleys, receiving the teaching of true Dao, I consider myself dim and ignorant, ashamed beyond bearing. Yet looking before and promising myself, swearing heart to the Three Lights, personally following master’s instruction, daring not to fail, threading through countless kalpas, feelings without turning back, revering and serving the law and teaching, only following the master. Ever wishing for pity and compassion to awaken what is not yet understood, to open the profound teaching, to expound the Dharma and admonish, that I may be lifted and redeemed, humbly listening to the mandate, swearing to serve it."
