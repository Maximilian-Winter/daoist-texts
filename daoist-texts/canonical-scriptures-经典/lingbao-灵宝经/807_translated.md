# The Supreme Cavernous Mysterious Spirit Treasure Origin Primordial Infinite Salvation Scripture of the Highest Grade (Dunhuang Edition)

The Way speaks:

In ancient times, amid the Primordial Blue Heaven, in the Azure Void did the great floating world arise. Receiving the Origin Primordial’s salvation, of boundless highest grade, the Primordial Heavenly Honoured One then declared this Scripture. Ten cycles he made, summoning the ten directions; at length all came to their seats. The Heavenly Spirits, great and true, the highest saints and noble exalted ones, the subtle-movements perfected beings, countless in number, came riding the void. On swift clouds, crimson skies, green chariots and jade wheels, with feathered canopies shading beneath. Flowing essence and jade light, the five colours flourishing, shining through the vast heavens. Seven days and seven nights. The realms of heaven, sun and moon, starry constellations, the celestial pivot stilled, the spirit-winds silent and calm, mountains and seas hidden in clouds, the sky without floating shadows, the four airs clear and bright. A single land and soil, mountains, rivers, woods all levelled evenly, no more height or depth; the earth all fashioned of green jade, without difference in hue. The assembly of spirits attended upon their seats; the Origin Primordial Heavenly Honoured One’s suspended seat floated upon the five-coloured lions.

When the Scripture was recited once, the great saints of the heavens all simultaneously praised it; at that time, in a certain land, men and women who were deaf or ill of ear were opened and made hearing. Recited twice, the blind regained sight. Thrice recited, the mute found speech. Four times, the lame and sick were all able to rise and walk. Five times, those long afflicted with chronic disease were restored at once in form. Six times, white hair turned black, fallen teeth regrew. Seven times, the aged returned to strength, the young all became vigorous. Eight times, women conceived, and birds and beasts pregnant, those born and unborn, all attained to generation. Nine times, the earth’s treasures poured forth, gold and jade shone forth in form. Ten times, dry bones came to life, all rose up as men.

At that time, men and women of the land, all with devoted hearts, received protection and salvation, and all attained longevity.

The Way speaks:

At that time the Origin Primordial Heavenly Honoured One, reciting the Scripture once, summoned from the East the boundless, infinite grade True Great Gods, the countless hosts floating in the air. Recited twice, from the South came the boundless, infinite grade True Great Gods, countless hosts floating in the air. Thrice recited, from the West came the boundless, infinite grade True Great Gods, countless hosts floating in the air. Four times, from the North came the boundless, infinite grade True Great Gods, countless hosts floating in the air. Five times, from the Northeast came the boundless, infinite grade True Great Gods, countless hosts floating in the air. Six times, from the Southeast came the boundless, infinite grade True Great Gods, countless hosts floating in the air. Seven times, from the Southwest came the boundless, infinite grade True Great Gods, countless hosts floating in the air. Eight times, from the Northwest came the boundless, infinite grade True Great Gods, countless hosts floating in the air. Nine times, from Above came the boundless, infinite grade True Great Gods, countless hosts floating in the air. Ten times, from Below came the boundless, infinite grade True Great Gods, countless hosts floating in the air. Completing the ten cycles, the True Gods of the ten directions all arrived together.

The men and women of the land, hearts wholly inclined and reverent, came like fine rain and dense mist. The countless hosts rendered half the land uneven and sunken, not to be restrained. Then Origin Primordial suspended a precious pearl, as large as a millet grain, in the void, five zhang above the earth. Origin Primordial ascended and led the True Heavenly Spirits, the highest saints and noble exalted ones, the subtle-movements perfected beings, the True Great Gods of the ten directions, and countless hosts, all entering into the pearl. The heavenly beings looked up and saw them sprightly pass into the pearl’s mouth; once within, their whereabouts were unknown. The people dispersed widely, the land restored level, no more sunken hollows. Within the pearl, Origin Primordial completed the Scripture’s recitation; the assembled spirits supervised the salvation and bestowed it upon me. At this time, joy and celebration were ineffable; the ritual matters roughly completed, the heavens again took their places; in a moment, all was silent without echo. At this time, heavenly beings, encountering the Scripture’s law, universally attained salvation. Throughout the year, no injury befell them; the whole land turned in reverence, all acted with kind hearts: no killing, no harm; no envy, no jealousy; no licentiousness, no theft; no greed, no desire; no hatred, no slander; speech without ornament or artifice, mouths without harsh words; all equally loving and compassionate; different bones formed kinship; the state peaceful, the people prosperous, rejoicing in great peace.

When the Scripture first emerged, it taught a land the Way; those with prior resolve, revering ritual and respect, all attained to salvation.

The Way speaks:

At that time, what the Origin Primordial Heavenly Honoured One spoke within the Scripture were the inner names and hidden rhymes of the various Heavenly Emperors, also the secret euphemisms of the Demon Kings and the hidden names of the myriad spirits; not the common words of the world. The highest saints having become perfected beings, penetrating the mysterious and subtle, are able to know all its details.

When chanted ten times, the heavens afar sing together, myriad emperors prepare rites, rivers and seas fall silent, mountains and peaks hide in clouds, sun and moon cease their light, the celestial pivot stands still, demons bind their forms, spirits vanish, the dead return to life, white bones become men.

The students most diligent, chanting it ten times, have the five emperors attending as guards, the three realms bowing, evil spirits losing sight, demons and monsters losing strength, salvation descending to the dying, death passed and life attained.

Why this is so: the students’ defilements not yet consumed, their bodies not yet thoroughly perfected; calling and controlling the ten directions, their might not yet mastering heaven; their governance and virtue may restrain the earth alone, binding and binding the demon spirits, but once dead cannot be reborn. Lightly chanting this chapter, their bodies suffer disaster; offering respectful rites, their homes prosper, generations flourish, along with good causes; ten thousand calamities do not harm, spirits guard the doors. This Scripture is honoured and subtle, unique in the Jade Capital, saving countless beings, the ancestor of myriad ways, majestic and sublime, virtue hard to surpass.

The Way speaks:

Whoever chants this Scripture ten times, the heavens assemble together, myriad ancestors innumerable, the souls in suffering and distress, all immediately receive salvation, ascending to the Vermilion Palace. All are measured for nine years, receiving transformation and rebirth, becoming noble persons. Those who love learning and reach completion of merit and virtue all become spirits and immortals, flying up to the Golden Gate, roaming and feasting in the Jade Capital. The advanced students who cultivate and chant this Scripture all receive salvation, flying up to the Southern Palace. Those of the world who receive and chant it prolong their years and life; thereafter all attain the method of corpse liberation, their souls and spirits temporarily vanish, do not pass through hell, but immediately return to form, and so journey through the vast void.

This Scripture is subtle and wondrous, universally saving without end; all heavenly and earthly beings receive blessing; immeasurable happiness covers birth and death, treasured by the heavens, not to be transmitted in future ages; only the highest scholars, fasting with gold treasures, with sincere hearts and oaths to Heaven, may transmit it. Careless leakage and neglect bring disaster to nine ancestors and long servitude to ghost officials.

Attending the Scripture are the Five Emperors, jade youths and jade maidens, each twenty-four persons, arranging and guarding divine texts, protecting the bodies of those receiving the Scripture.

The Way speaks:

In the first month, fasting long and chanting this Scripture for the departed souls of former ages, breaking the bonds of earth and servitude, ascending to the Southern Palace. In the seventh month, fasting long and chanting this Scripture, the body attains spirit and immortality, all heavens record the name, yellow registers and white slips, cutting off death and promoting birth. In the tenth month, fasting long and chanting this Scripture, for kings and emperors, lords and ministers, fathers and sons, to secure the state’s prosperity and protect the heavenly permanence, generation after generation unbroken, usually making men rulers, securing their territories, the people acclaiming great peace. On the eight festivals’ days, chanting this Scripture, one attains the nine palaces’ perfected beings. On the day of one’s birth, chanting this Scripture, the soul and spirit become pure and upright, myriad energies enduring long; without passing through suffering, the body shines with light. The three realms attend and guard, the five emperors escort, myriad gods pay homage, names recorded in the heavens, merit and virtue complete, flying up to the Supreme Clarity.

The Way speaks:

On the days of practicing the Way, one should bathe with fragrant water, fast and enter the chamber, face east and knock the teeth thirty-two times, hear the thirty-two heavens above, worship with the heart thirty-two times, close the eyes and quietly reflect: sitting amid the blue, yellow, and white three-coloured clouds, within and without mysterious and dark, with blue dragon and white tiger, vermilion bird and black tortoise, lion and white crane, arrayed left and right, sun and moon illuminating, the chamber shining bright, the neck forming a round image, light reflecting in all directions, thus clearly manifest.

The secret spell says: Supreme Mysterious Origin, Most High Way Lord, summon forth from my body the three and five merit officers, the left and right officials, attendants of fragrant jade youths, conveyors of jade maidens, the Five Emperors meeting the talisman, the incense officers of the day, each thirty-two persons, to open what is spoken: today is auspicious, fasting and pure hall, cultivating the Supreme Scripture, infinitely saving persons, may what is summoned ascend thoroughly, proceed to the Most High Thirty-Two Heavens, Origin Primordial Supreme Emperor before the throne.

Then guide the breath thirty-two times, face east and recite the Scripture.

First, the sound of the desire realm flying through the void

The human way is vast and dim. The immortal way is wild and boundless. The ghostly way delights; it must enter the birth gate. The immortal way values life. The ghostly way values end. The immortal way is always auspicious. The ghostly way is always ominous. High Supreme Clarity spirit brightness. Sorrowful songs resounding in vast heaven. Only wishing the immortal way to succeed. Not wishing the human way to fail. Northern capital spring bend mansion. Within are myriad ghost hordes. Only desiring to restrain human calculation. Severing human birth gate. Ah men sing cavernous chapters. To restrain Northern Luo Feng. Binding chanting evil demon spirits. Cutting off six ghost blades. The heavens are vast and broad. My way daily flourishes.

Second, the chapter of the colour realm demon kings’ sound

Lofty and wide-spreading. Bright breath four directions. Brahma conduct of the heavens. Cycling ten directions. Infinite great gods. All because of my body. I have cavernous chapters. Ten thousand times to become immortal. The immortal way values salvation. The ghostly way connects mutually. Heaven and earth vast and wild. Defilements thick and dense. Three realms delight; surpassing them eternal. Body saved in my realm. Form entering nature. At this time delight; all by my grace. Dragon Han vast and broad. How can one separate truth? My realm is hard to save. Therefore making cavernous script. Transforming flying void. To test your body. Success or failure, slackness or retreat, how many are saved? Laughing at your not being saved. Therefore the song’s beginning.

Third, the colour realm demon kings’ song says:

Above the three realms. Vast great net. Above no colour root. Clouds layered high. Only Origin Primordial. Home of great kalpa. Commanding my realm. Governing mysterious capital. Having passed my realm. Penetrating Jade Void. My rank highest king. Guiding and commanding many demons. In the void myriad transformations. Defilements like flowers. Few guard truth. Many are bewildered. Immortal way hard to secure. Ghostly way easy to err. Human way is the heart. Surely not by others. Immortal way values reality. Human way values splendour. You do not enjoy the immortal way. How can the three realms be surpassed? They desire to turn the five ways. What shall I do? This above the three realms, flying through the void demon king’s song sound, sound conjoining cavernous chapters. Chanting it a hundred times, named saved in southern palace; chanting it a thousand times, demon kings protect and escort; ten thousand times complete the way, flying up to the vast void, crossing and saving the three realms, attaining immortal rank, hearing the spirit sound, demon kings respectfully obey, commanding and controlling the earth alone, guarding and escorting attendants, pulling open the earth gate, five sufferings and eight hardships, seven ancestors ascending, forever departing ghost officials, souls saved in Vermilion Mound, receiving refinement and rebirth, this is called boundless, universal salvation without end. There are secret upper heavenly scripts, revered by all heavens; careless and negligent fall to hell, disaster reaching seven ancestors and elders.

The Way speaks:

These two chapters are both the hidden sounds of the heavens’ emperors and the spiritual demon kings, all words of great Brahma, not the common language of the world, their words without rhyme or splendour, their tunes without ornament or grace; therefore called mysterious and profound, hard to seek and detail. The heavens treasure them, secret in the mysterious capital, Purple Tenuity upper palace, following the mysterious laws for forty thousand kalpas and one transmission; should there be a perfected person, fasting with gold treasure, heart adhering to the old pattern, declaring oaths to the ten heavens, then only may they be entrusted.

The Way speaks:

The operations of heaven and earth also have beginnings and ends; the sun, moon, and five planets also have waxing and waning; the highest saints and spirits also have rest and injury; the lowest learners also have sickness and harm. Whenever such disasters occur, the same breath must be cultivated, all hearts practicing fasting, incense offering six times, Scripture turning ten times, blessings and virtues immediately descending, eliminating all misfortune, countless writings, universal salvation without end.

The Way speaks:

The lowest learners with shallow Way, or immortal grade not yet full, destined to perish; their bodies encountering the Greater Yin, nearing passing, fellow learners and perfected ones come to offer incense, chanting the Scripture ten times, to save the corpse form according to law, their soul and spirit directly ascending to the Southern Palace; according to their learning merit, counting days to rebirth, revolving wheel not ceasing, thereby attaining spirit and immortality.

The Way speaks:

When heaven and earth’s operations end, also one should fast, offer incense and chant Scripture; when star lodges err, sun and moon lose their setting, also one should fast, offer incense and chant Scripture; when four seasons fail their courses, yin and yang out of accord, also one should fast, offer incense and chant Scripture; when rulers suffer disaster, war and strife arise, also one should fast, offer incense and chant Scripture; when plague and poison spread, many people die or suffer, also one should fast, offer incense and chant Scripture; when teachers and friends pass away, also one should fast, offer incense and chant Scripture. The fasting and Scripture chanting has great merit, above dispelling heavenly disasters, protecting and stabilizing emperors and kings, below averting poison and harm, saving the multitudes, relying on birth and death, their blessings hard to match; hence called boundless, universal salvation of heaven and men.

The Way speaks:

Whoever possesses this Scripture, able to serve heaven and earth, emperors and rulers and multitudes, performing these merits and virtues. On days of disaster, arising heart to fast, burning incense and chanting Scripture ten times, all heavens record the name, myriad gods attending and guarding, right separately reaching perfected ones, able to become sage rulers and ministers of the Golden Gate. The heavens record men’s merits and faults, not missing even the smallest part; the demon kings of the heavens also protect and recommend your person attaining the Way; this is to understand the profound words clearly.
