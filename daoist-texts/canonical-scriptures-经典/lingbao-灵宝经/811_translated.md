## Preface to the Collected Annotations on the Scripture of Deliverance

Composed by Master Chen Jingyuan, Registrar of the Way and Truth in the Right Street

The void and the shining light, confused and undistinguished, the Great Way about to transform; hence the mysterious script issues forth in the central heavens; the sudden condensation of the void is the wondrous black knot in the azure vault. The character measures one zhang square in breadth, its force hanging like the rays of an eight-pointed star, brilliant and resplendent, its radiance dazzling. At this time, the Primordial Beginning descended to the place called Bailin, the Five Elders encircled and attended in cloud seat, swiftly commanding the Heavenly True Sovereign to arrange and bend the regulations, to imitate and seize the true, composing the secret writings of the various heavens, compiling the spiritual models of the Five Directions. They recorded the transport of the mixed origin of Dragon and Han, concealed in the palace of Yu Luo Ziwei, unfolding into thirty-six revered scriptures, divided into twelve thousand catalogues. The heavenly edicts inscribed in cloud script, the books of the eight assemblies, all trace their origin to this. In ancient times, within the Primordial Azure Heaven and the Precious Pearl, they expounded the teaching of the Lingbao, rescuing the relations between heaven and men. The Jade Morning Lord arranged it, to order its beginning and end, secreted in the upper hall, to be transmitted once in forty thousand kalpas, vowing not lightly to disseminate it to the lower world.

Then the Golden Mother of the Tortoise Terrace, moved by compassion for the nine and hundred and six calamities, personally worshipped at the Jade Capital, earnestly petitioning for its diffusion. When Emperor Xuanyuan of the Yellow Emperor inquired of the Way in the shade of Mount Emei, he bowed to the Sovereign, carrying the treasured instructions. At Wu there was the sage Ququ Ge Xuan, who sought the Way in Kuaiji commandery, supplicated at Mount Shangyu, met the envoy of the Supreme Ultimate, who brought down the store of Lingbao scriptures. This is the Supreme Excellent, the earliest to be transmitted.

Later, those who cultivated and recited it spread throughout the world; the secret rhymes and hidden sounds none in the world could exhaust. Yan Dong of Qi first made annotations, looking up to the rotation of the Brahmanic breath, looking down to the spring and stream of Fengdu, spreading it in various volumes, brilliant and clear. If not for the profound elucidation of the subtlety, whence would the principles be made clear? Thus he enabled the guests of the past wind to remove obstacles and open apertures, to follow nature in their pronouncements. Then the Tang Taoist Xue Youxi, waving his robes at Qingcheng, nurturing the true in Heng and Yue, explained the origin and exposition, plainly setting forth the preservation and cultivation. Following him were the Supreme Purity attendants Li Shaowei and Western Hua Master Cheng Xuanying, each composing their annotations and explanations, drawing on the inner sounds to supplement and fill deficiencies, their principles fully complete. Jingyuan, in his youth aspiring to the Way, briefly studied the Jade Scripture, uncompromised by obscurity, dared to compile and arrange. Now, from the sayings of the four families, removing repetition, selecting the secret meanings, he compiled into four scrolls, that many perplexities might be avoided. In the fourth year of Zhiping, year of Dingwei, mid-autumn full moon, composed the preface.

The Way lies in silence and void, the mind dark, the spirit attuned; the scripture depends on writing and transmission, recitation and expansion. Without silence, none can attune to the Way; without recitation, none can spread the scripture. Though the teachings differ, their essence is uniform. Spread out, they diverge; merged, they return to one. Because the Way establishes the scripture, and the scripture clarifies the Way. The Way is the scripture’s fundamental body; the scripture is the Way’s trace and function; body and trace mutually clarify, essence and function deeply united. Therefore, the true text shines above the void, opening the vast source in the Purple Pole palace. Then the three grades of true vision dissect the books of the flying heavens of the various lands; the seven divisions of the multitude of scriptures spread the bright traces of the cloud script. At this time, the Primordial Heavenly Honoured One sits at the Purple Pole Jade Capital upper palace, with the Three Caverns’ Correct Scriptures before him, the three great subsidiary scriptures behind; the two chapters of the Dao and De as assistants, the hidden Jade Purity scripture as the leading teaching. The Dongxuan Lingbao is one of the three caverns’ middle caverns. The Boundless Deliverance of Men is one volume of the middle cavern. The methods of cultivation are many within one volume; the recited chapters begin with this volume. It removes heavenly disasters above, protects and pacifies the emperors below, propitiates poisons and harms to deliver the multitudes, uplifts ancestors, and attains the Way oneself. This is the magnificent grand pattern, alone surpassing the Three Purities. The meaning of the scripture is profound and obscure, its sounds and rhymes secret; all unfold the principle of the Great Brahman, not words to transform and entice the ordinary path. Therefore it is said, the Supreme Sage has become a true man, penetrating mystery and exhaustiveness, able to fully grasp its chapters. Hence many recite it, but few reach its essence. Now, not relying on the strength of gnats and flies, forcibly bearing the weight of a thousand jun, to judge the sage’s intent by a common man’s standard, if you personally accept the mysterious master, you will surely hope to receive instruction. In the year of Jiawu, month of Gengwu. Preface by Xue Youxi, Taoist of Mount Heng.

## The Four Annotations on the Supreme Excellent Mysterious Scripture of the Primordial Beginning’s Boundless Deliverance of Men, Volume One

### The Supreme Perfect Dongxuan Lingbao Boundless Deliverance of Men Supreme Excellent Mysterious Scripture

Youxi says: The Great (Tai) is the name of the utmost greatness; the Supreme (Shang) is the appellation of reverence. Dong (cavern) means thorough understanding; Xuan (mysterious) means subtlety. Ling means holy transformation; Bao, precious and esteemed. Boundless means uncountable; Deliverance of Men means from the mundane into the sacred. To elucidate this scripture, to open deliverance and ascend to immortality, there are no limits or restrictions. The Dongxuan Lingbao is the name of the grade; the Boundless Deliverance of Men is the title of a single scroll. Since the grade is high and lofty, it is called supreme; since its function is subtle, it is called a mysterious scripture. ○ Shaowei says: The Great Supreme is the highest realm of the Way. The Dongxuan is the wisdom to penetrate it. The august Primordial Beginning, the sovereign of myriad emperors, vast and boundless, above the Three Heavens. Having reached this, great and without exterior, yet utterly lofty and unfathomable. Hence it is said Great Supreme Dong (penetrating) and Xuan (mysterious). Searching the depths and pursuing brightness, hooking the obscure and extending afar, penetrating the utmost principle of heaven and earth, exhausting the wondrous numbers of all things, hence called Dongxuan. Transformations are without pattern, called Ling; reverence and preciousness called Bao. The true text is luxuriant and elegant, the Five Emperors attend the pavilion, jade characters hang their rays, the models of the various heavens. Thus carved on golden slips, annotations circulated. Precious are the spiritual characters, hence called Lingbao. The Primordial Heavenly Honoured One, responding to kalpas, operating the three realms, issuing the Law of Deliverance of Men, attaining the Way and becoming true, like rain and mist, their reckoning unknown, hence called Boundless Deliverance of Men. The three cavern heavens’ books, spiritual songs and essential hymns, all their functions and acts open deliverance first, forming the ladder of true rank, the root of the seed-people; hence called Supreme Excellent Mysterious Scripture.

The Dao says:

Youxi says: This is the words of the Great Jade Morning Supreme Way Lord. The Way Lord is the disciple of the Primordial Heavenly Honoured One, the master of the Heavenly Emperor of Taiwei. Residing in Upper Purity Upper Origin Jade Morning Office, that is the realm of Upper Purity, the exalted rank of Supreme Purity. Having received this scripture, he composed its preface, therefore the opening title marks its beginning. ○ Xuanying says: According to the Benxing Scripture, the Way Lord is a man of the Western Yulin kingdom. The Purple Morning flows with fragrance, a scion of the august sovereign, able to reverently receive the Lingbao Primordial Beginning, appointed as the Imperial Lord of Yuyue Nalin Changyu Terrace. His station ascends to the Supreme, governing the Xuandu. The Jade Capital Grand Dong Scripture says: The Upper Purity Supreme Way Lord, one appellation Jade Morning Lord, governs the Yaozhu Jade Pavilion and the seven jade chambers of the Purple Palace, serving the Void Sovereign. The Void Sovereign is the Primordial Heavenly Honoured One.

In former times, within the Primordial Azure Heaven, the Bilu Void sang in great floating Li lands, received the Primordial Beginning’s Deliverance of Men Boundless Supreme.

Youxi says: Formerly, in days gone by. The Primordial Azure Heaven is the Azure Heaven of the Eastern Nine Qi, above the round net, issuing from the eastern extreme. Primordial is the name of the founding of the five directions; Azure is the colour of the Eastern Nine Qi. Hence the true text says: Eastern Nine Qi, Primordial Emperor Azure Heaven. Since the heavens are blue and the Qi azure, then the blue mist is vast and clear, hence called Bilu. The spiritual phoenix and jade trees, drums and songs in the void, hence called Void Songs. The great floating Li lands are the name of the great floating Li kingdom. The Way Lord says: I formerly in this heavenly country received the Primordial Beginning’s Deliverance of Men scripture. ○ Shaowei says: The Primordial Azure Heaven is the Jade Long Heaven of the Northeast. This heaven is covered with blue mist, spiritual music and divine winds, purple characters ringing in the forest, naturally forming songs. This country’s sovereign is the Revered Primordial Heavenly Honoured One, descending to the ten directions, gathering at the time of deliverance of men, receiving this scripture. The Lingshu says: The Eastern Extreme Great Floating Li Kingdom, its earth all of jasper, is ever covered with blue mist. There are also the Blue Forest trees, their leaves bearing natural purple writings. When the wind blows the trees, the sounds all form brilliant verses, clear throughout the great void, hence called Bilu Void Songs. ○ Xuanying says: The Great Floating Li Land is a name for vast extent; Floating Li is the name of its sovereign; Land is the country.

The Primordial Heavenly Honoured One was about to expound this scripture, circling ten times to summon the ten directions. Then he ascended his seat,

Youxi says: Yuan means beginning; Shi means first. Saying the Primordial Heavenly Honoured One established the beginning of myriad transformations, as the chief of all the ways, residing in the Upper Purity Upper Origin realm, governing the domain of the great Luo of the Xuandu. He planted the root of heaven and earth, gave birth to the mother of myriad things. Desiring to transmit the scripture and expound the Law, he first summoned the ten directions’ heavenly spirits, each circling once, ten times the ten directions, no longer like the ten directions simply circling ten times. When the summoning was completed, then he ascended his seat. ○ Shaowei says: The Primordial Heavenly Honoured One is the title of the Void Sovereign. Beginning from true response, it is called: verification and cultivation. Wondrous thought and mysterious source are inherent in one’s nature alone. Hence the Dongshen Scripture says: wondrous form without shape, response and influence with form. The true essence’s Qi transforms into form and appearance; at that time ten rotations of the scripture, the ten directions gather and cease not, none distant fails to respond, thus the term arrival. Arrival means to go.

The Heavenly True Great Spirits, Supreme Sage High Honoured, Wondrous Conduct True Men, innumerable hosts, come riding the void.

Shaowei says: Yang means cessation. The true holy honored spirits and their retinues exceed countless myriads, thousands of chariots and tens of thousands of steeds, the various heavens all come. According to this measure of enumeration, how can their number be limited?

Flying clouds and cinnabar skies, green carriages and jade wheels, feathered canopies hanging shade, flowing essence and jade light, five colours flourishing, illuminating the great void.

Youxi says: Yang means centre; the ancient character sometimes used Yang to signify centre. Centre means completion, cessation. Thus innumerable multitudes, yet still retained thought. ○ Shaowei says: From the Primordial Beginning Dongxuan onward it is called scripture. Uncountable, all shaded by feathered canopies and riding green carriages, flying through the clouds and cinnabar skies, bearing jade hubs, heavenly spirits all gathered, the Supreme Sage united and complete, streaming essence glowing in all directions, jade light shining in the void. Flowing essence is the five-coloured flowing essence within the jade light. Jade light is the true man’s body light. Great void is above the Supreme Purity. ○ Shaowei says: Flying clouds and cinnabar skies form garments; green carriages and jade wheels are harnessed dragons and phoenixes. All are brilliant light, colors shining bright, the holy garments of the heavenly honoured ones. The Commentary says: From the Brahma heaven upward, all are flying clouds and streaming skies naturally forming wondrous Qi clothes. ○ Xuanying says: Chariots are the carriage compartments. Since they wear flowing skies as garments and ride green carriages, also the phoenix feathers as carriage canopies, accompanied by nine-coloured dragons and phoenixes, shading one another, hence the words feathered canopies hanging shade, shining resplendently; hence flowing essence and jade light, the carriages’ garments glorious; hence the five colours flourishing. Billions of carriages and tens of thousands of mounts float through the air, filling the vast void, all proceeding to Floating Li to hear the Law, hence the words illuminating the great void.

Seven days and seven nights, the heavens’ sun, moon, stars, and the Beidou and Jade Balance, halted their wheels simultaneously. The divine winds were calm and silent, mountains and seas concealed clouds, the heavens had no floating shadows, the four Qi were clear and bright.

Youxi says: All the various heavens are the thirty-two heavens. Each of the heavens has its own sun and moon, their essence and light originally formed, all arising from this realm’s division and root. The Beidou and Jade Balance are the seven stars of the Northern Dipper. The four Qi clear and bright are the Qi of heaven, earth, sun, and moon. The true transmission of the true, the holy’s imparting of the holy, thus the three lights cease their wheels to remain in illumination, the mountains and seas accept Qi and swallow smoke, the wind masters dare not sound, clouds arrange without shadow or brightness. Thus heaven and earth are clear and bright, sun and moon shining clearly, seven days and seven nights, the Law proceedings nearing completion. Having ceased their wheels, where is night? It is by the ordinary measure of time, a period of seven days and seven nights. ○ Shaowei says: These three are heavenly auspices. The Tianwen Record says: The Northern Dipper’s seven stars are called the Beidou and Jade Balance. The four stars of the handle are the Xuanji; the three stars of the ladle are the Yuheng. The sun, moon, stars, and heavenly officers and palaces listen to the Law, thus halting their wheels.

One country’s land, mountains, rivers, forests, and trees, all levelled equally, no longer high or low, the earth all of jasper, without differing colours.

Youxi says: One country means the great Floating Li kingdom. The mountains have lofty forests and jade trees, the rivers have divine streams and spiritual springs, all levelled without inequality, no high or low inclining. Since all is jasper for earth, how could there be differing colours? This shows the divine transformations and spiritual changes at the time, naturally causing sun and moon to halt their wheels, mountains and rivers to become even. ○ Shaowei says: These two are the earth’s response. Mountains, rivers, and earth’s palaces are the earth’s abode, responding to the void and transforming into jasper.

All the true ones attend the seat, the Primordial Heavenly Honoured One sits mysteriously floating on the five-coloured lion.

Youxi says: The lion is in the void; the mysterious seat is placed upon the lion. The lion is king among beasts, subduing all beasts; one roar causes all evil spirits to submit. The Heavenly Honoured One’s divine virtue subdues all demons, and he again sits upon the lion’s seat. Having ascended and seated to expound the scripture, the true ones array and attend. ○ Shaowei says: This is one aspect, the heavenly honoured one’s Dao appearance.

Expounding the scripture once, the great saints of the heavens all simultaneously acclaim it as good. At this time a country of men and women, some deaf and sick, all their ears opened and made intelligent.

Youxi says: Hearing for the first time the heavenly honoured one’s spiritual sound, opening and elucidating the wondrous principle of the supreme sage, they all acclaim in unison, the greatest good. Thus the great Floating Li kingdom, men and women, hearing it, all deaf and sick become intelligent: this is the proof of one recitation. ○ Xuanying says: At this time men and women in the country hearing the Law, after one recitation, hearing with ear and understanding with heart, is called opening the ears. Also called country, meaning the body. Hearing the Law is understanding, entering the heart palace, this is opening the ears.

Expounding the scripture twice, the blind recover their sight.

Youxi says: Having first caused the ear to hear the wondrous meaning, next cause the eye to behold the heavenly honoured one’s appearance; this is the proof of two recitations. ○ Xuanying says: Twice they gradually recognize the writing, hence said to open the eyes; if one considers carefully, it is not a bodily disease.

Expounding the scripture thrice, the mute begin to speak.

Youxi says: Having caused the eye to behold the holy visage, now causing the mouth to speak the scripture; this is the proof of three recitations. ○ Xuanying says: Thrice the heart’s recognition and understanding, naturally able to transmit the wondrous Law, hence said to be able to speak.

Expounding the scripture four times, the lame, the sick, and the accumulated infirm all stand and walk.

Youxi says: Having caused the mouth to speak the scripture, now causing the feet to walk the Way; this is the proof of four recitations. ○ Xuanying says: Though thrice able to speak, they have not yet fully understood the truth; at the fourth recitation they seek teachers and inquire of the meaning, hence said to be able to walk. Accumulated infirmities are illnesses passed down through generations.

Expounding the scripture five times, chronic diseases and stubborn ailments all at once recover their form.

Youxi says: Having caused the feet to walk the Way, now the whole body cultivates; this is the proof of five recitations. ○ Xuanying says: At five recitations one comprehends in the heart, the功 increases and blessings nourish, able to dispel chronic diseases and stubborn ailments, recovering at once their form as before illness.

Expounding the scripture six times, white hair turns black again, fallen teeth grow anew.

Youxi says: Having cultivated the whole body, the body is covered in true effect; this is the proof of six recitations. ○ Xuanying says: At six recitations功 is great and blessing deep, able to turn white hair back to black, fallen teeth regenerate.

Expounding the scripture seven times, the old become strong again, the young all become vigorous.

Youxi says: At first the head shows spiritual effect, next the whole body bathes in holy grace; this is the proof of seven recitations. ○ Xuanying says: Seven recitations turn the scripture, the old become young, the strong and young become still stronger and healthier.

Expounding the scripture eight times, pregnant women conceive without fail, birds and beasts bear young, all born and unborn receive life.

Youxi says: Those already in life revert to youth and forsake old age; those not yet born receive life; this is the proof of eight recitations. ○ Xuanying says: The seven recitations encompass seven consciousnesses, transforming to cover the three powers; at eight recitations the four kinds of life are nourished and celebrated. Those born from the womb do not perish, those born from eggs do not decay; all are nurtured, hence all receive life.

Expounding the scripture nine times, the earth’s storehouses open, gold and jade appear.

Youxi says: Having received the birth of life, again they perceive the earth’s storehouses opening; the country’s people all obtain treasures of gold and jade; this is the proof of nine recitations. ○ Xuanying says: Previously opening the transformation of the four kinds of life, now the hidden perceives blessings. The earth’s storehouses open, revealing shapes of gold and jade; spreading throughout mountains and rivers, the people receive sufficient supply, hence gold and jade appear.

Expounding the scripture ten times, dry bones come to life again, all arise as men.

Youxi says: Having received the treasured secrets, next transforming the putrid decay to marvel; this is the proof of ten recitations. ○ Xuanying says: Having communicated with the earth’s geography at nine recitations, ten recitations then reach the heavens, receiving the Great Unity’s spirit-returning talisman, raising the dead of many years and dry bones to life again as men.

At that time, all in one country, men and women, none do not incline their hearts and all receive protection and deliverance, all obtain long life.

Youxi says: At this time, the great Floating Li kingdom, men and women alike, without old or young, all receive the holy grace, universally delivered. The living do not die, the dead are reborn; thus all obtain long life. ○ Xuanying says: Incline means exhausted. At the time the heavenly honoured one expounded the scripture, the men and women of Floating Li all sat near, hearing the wondrous Law, each fully attentive; hence the words none do not incline the heart. The people of one country receive this deliverance wondrous Law, hence they all receive protection and deliverance; having been delivered, they attain the Way to become true; hence all obtain long life. All heavenly beings and men have sicknesses of light or heavy; the method of cultivation depends on功 depth; light sickness requires fewer recitations to heal; heavy sickness requires more功 and cures; hence knowing that reciting the scripture ten times reaches the heavens, reviving the dead and returning bones to life, granting long life and longevity. ○ Shaowei says: When dragons and tigers roar, wind and clouds arise; when sages act, the three powers respond; this is the natural number, the sure talisman; therefore ten recitations of the scripture, a hundred ailments immediately cured. If not the great saint of the Primordial Beginning, who can compare? The old learning says mind and intelligence diseases are not bodily illnesses, a great error indeed.

Lightly reciting this chapter, the body suffers calamity.

Shaowei says: The Five Emperors’ mighty gods attend the Lingbao, overseeing those who slight or deride, a great danger indeed.

Attending with reverent respect, the gate prospers, generation after generation; with good causes, ten thousand calamities do not touch; the spirits protect the gate.

Youxi says: Light recitation means inattentive to neat dress, not following ritual; or standing, sitting, or lying, reciting carelessly with ears only. Not only does one’s body suffer, but also the ancestors above. If only reverently respectful, then the gate prospers, the body receives blessings, the lineage flourishes, evil roots do not arise, always in harmony with good.

Thousands of gods come to guard; what ten thousand calamities can prevail? Thus it is said reciting without taste is not as good as not reciting but holding respect. Those who hold the scripture ought to examine carefully.

This scripture is lofty and wondrous, alone walking in the Jade Capital.

Shaowei says: This means by this wondrous Way alone one may fly to the Jade Capital. The Benxiang Scripture says: In the great Luo heaven, there is Jade Capital mountain, rootless yet born, resting in the void; within are the Purple Pole upper palaces, extending thirty thousand li square. Golden towers and jade terraces, adorned with seven treasures. Above the jade chamber are thirty-six places, eight thousand li round, true characters large and great, full therein.

The boundless deliverance of men is the ancestor of myriad ways, a magnificent grand pattern, virtue hard to surpass.

Shaowei says: The Erya says: Pattern means law. ○ Youxi says: Since all heavens esteem it, not transmitted to the lower world, residing in the secret storage of the Purple Pole, in the special use of Xuandu; being the greatest of deliverance of men, marking the chief of myriad ways, a magnificent holy pattern, like Kunlun’s crown in the firmament; virtue and measure hard to surpass, as boundless as the ocean’s depths. This is the wondrous Way.

The Dao says: Whoever recites this scripture ten times, all the heavens come together. A hundred million ancestors, the spirits and ghosts, all receive deliverance and ascend to the Vermilion Palace.

Youxi says: This means whoever recites is not limited by rank or grade; if able to recite with devotion ten times, then the heavens and saints gather in the temples, transmitting the spirits of ancestors and the toils of the Kun clan; below they depart the north palace, above enter the south palace. The Vermilion Palace is the south palace.

The grade is always nine years, receiving transformation and rebirth, becoming noble; those who love learning and the scripture,功 full and virtue complete, all become immortals, flying and ascending the Golden Gate, roaming the Jade Capital.

Youxi says: The grade of nine years means the nine-year grade, the number of three fires times three making nine. The Vermilion Palace is the south, belonging to fire. By fire the body is refined, hence the three fires. After nine years of refining and transformation, then rebirth as nobles. Having been born, they cultivate this scripture; those who have practiced in the past, their功 remaining; after ten thousand recitations’功 is full, three thousand virtues also perfected, then transcendent and delivered, directly becoming immortal; ascending the Golden Gate to pay homage to the holy sovereign, roaming the Jade Capital to visit the Primordial Beginning; this is the ten recitations’ grade. ○ Shaowei says: This shows the ability to deliver ancestors. According to the Sanyuan Pinjie, the Vermilion Deliverance grade has three levels; nine years is the middle blessing grade, great blessing three years, small blessing twenty-four years. All are reborn in the lower world, becoming nobles. By their prior affinity and good fortune, they can delight in learning, not passing through birth and death, immediately becoming immortals.

The advanced students, cultivating and reciting this scripture, all receive deliverance, flying and ascending to the south palace.

Youxi says: Advanced students who hear the Way and diligently practice, seeing the Law they must learn, never ceasing, regardless of cold or heat, this is the Immortal name below the nine palaces of Supreme Purity. Having cultivated this scripture so the body attains the Way, ascending to the immortals’ realm, receiving refining in the south palace. The soul and spirit ascend to immortality, fire refines the ghostly essence; the living body attains the Way, fire refines the filth. Initially all enter the south palace, then ascend to their proper place; this is the advanced student’s grade.

Ordinary persons reciting prolong life and years, later all attain the Way of corpse liberation. The soul and spirit briefly vanish, without passing through hell, immediately returning to form, roaming the great void.

Youxi says: Ordinary persons are those on the common path, not exceptional. Since their ancestral cause and blessings are slight, their body’s功 slight, therefore in life they enjoy longevity, after death they dissolve their form briefly. Yet not subject to the three officials’ regulations, nor the nine palaces’ hardships; after a number of terms, the spirit returns to form. Having changed form and appearance at the three officials’ halls, exchanging youthful face at the nine refinements’ corpse, so not entering the south upper palaces, directly journeying the great void realm. The great void is above the three realms, this is the common folk’s grade. From true to this mundane there are five grades, thus the ranks differ. ○ Shaowei says: Again this shows ordinary persons reciting also can self-deliver. Ordinary persons’ virtue is thin,功 incomplete, though unable to fly with flesh and blood, they can dissolve corpse and attain the Way. The Benxiang Scripture says: Earlier功 not established, later flesh and blood not immortal, thus dissolving corpse and attaining the Way. According to the scripture, corpse liberation has four kinds: first, military liberation, e.g. Ji Kang imprisoned and killed in market, Huainan entrusting form in prison; second, literary liberation, e.g. Ci Qing changing form on shoe, Chang Fang liberating form on bamboo; third, water-fire refinement, e.g. Feng Yi drowned in great river, Fengzi burned in fiery tree; fourth, great yin refinement of essence, manifesting as dead yet limbs not blue, skin not wrinkled, eyes not damaged, able to bend and stretch, also corpse liberation. Flesh remains for a hundred years without decay, again rising as man. The Zhenyu says: Pei Jun said: Corpse liberation immortals do not ride the feathered canopy, nor fly the dragon, nor ascend the Supreme Ultimate, nor wander the nine palaces; but only do not die. The bow and sword signify military liberation, bamboo staff literary liberation, water-fire and great yin are the four kinds.

This scripture is subtle and wondrous, universally delivering without end; all heavens and men, none but receive blessings; boundless blessings cover life and death.

Youxi says: The scripture’s功力 and effects are subtle and profound; ten rotations bring myriad Qi to immortality, five grades deliver boundlessly. Heaven and men bathe in deliverance’s blessings; life and death depend on the grace of extraction and deliverance.

Treasured by the upper heavens, not transmitted to the lower world.

Shaowei says: When the heavenly honoured one expounds the scripture, it is not transmitted to the lower world; the Queen Mother requested to safeguard against calamities, thus it circulated and first appeared in the human world. Song Jun says: This scripture delivers men in four ways: first, ascending to heaven in broad daylight, delivering in the body; second, corpse liberation and transformation; third, death without decay, later rebirth; fourth, soul and spirit temporarily vanish, ascending to the south palace to receive transformation. Karma varies in light and heavy, thus retribution varies; also delivering ancestors, thus it says life and death receive blessing.

Advanced disciples bear golden treasures to express heart, covenant with heaven and transmit. If lightly leaked or slovenly, calamity reaches nine ancestors, long servitude to ghost officials.

Youxi says: Since said secret in the Xuandu, it is fitting not to transmit to the lower world. Now, because of the Great Supreme’s diffusion, it again descends and is granted to the human world. Thus advanced disciples bear golden treasures to express their hearts and covenant solemnly; violating the covenant causes the nine ancestors to be examined, the treasures’ secrets to be multiplied by myriad ancestors’功. ○ Shaowei says: The spiritual script is secret and weighty; granting and receiving is difficult; how can it be lightly transmitted, extending calamity to nine ancestors?

The Five Emperors attend, jade youths and jade maidens, twenty-four each, arrange divine script, protect the reciters’ bodies.

Youxi says: This means the Five Emperors’ jade youths and maidens come to attend. They are not the Five Emperors and jade youths and maidens attending together. The Five Emperors are the Five Elders, not the Emperors of the Five Directions. The youths and maidens number forty-eight; they constantly guard the divine scripture, and protect those who recite. They also report the earnest功 and observe any leaks or sloth. Those who receive the scripture should be cautious. If they go out or roam, they must carry the scripture, so that holding the text protects the body, avoiding calamity and care.

The Dao says: On the first month, long fast, recite this scripture, to sever the calamities of past lives, deliver to the upper south palace.

Youxi says: The first month is the month of the Great Festival of the Upper Origin. Thus able to bless the ancestors of the upper generations, the spirits and ghosts in suffering, severing the ghostly bonds and bondage, receiving the immortal officials’ deliverance blessing. Fasting means no worldly affairs, mind unmoved by external thoughts, inner and outer pure and void, embracing the primordial and guarding the one, throughout this month. Hence it is called long fast.

On the seventh month, long fast, recite this scripture, the body attains immortality, the heavenly books’ names, golden registers and white tablets, remove death and bring life.

Youxi says: The seventh month is the month of the Great Festival of the Middle Origin. Thus concerning oneself, all heavens ascend; names recorded in white tablets, Feng and Dai remove death; enrolled in black ledgers, the body attains immortality, ranks ascend the heavenly palaces. Golden registers and white tablets are books of gold and tablets of white jade. This alone does not mention the tenth month of the Lower Origin, for the upper origin is for ancestors above, the middle origin concerns oneself, the lower origin concerns children below. Now that advanced study is foremost, the advanced has ancestors above but no children below; thus the tenth month Lower Origin is barely mentioned. The scripture also does not mention the功 and faults of Lower Origin. Advanced disciples study carefully and examine. ○ Shaowei says: The celestial officials’ time is fit to deliver ancestors; the terrestrial officials’ month is fit to deliver oneself. This is the difference of first and last, respect and rank. Golden registers and white tablets record the immortals’ registration. The Recording of Words and Years Scripture says: The name book and imperial registers depend on prior affinity, all by diligent seeking, not naturally. ○ Xuanying says: According to the Three Origins Precepts, the first month is the birth of yang Qi, the time of the upper origin celestial officials’ checking, fit to deliver ancestors. The seventh month is the middle origin’s checking month, the terrestrial officials’ checking time, fit to deliver oneself. Also this is the difference of first and last, respect and rank. It means the method of cultivation universally delivers without end, assisting life and death, moistening all moving and planted beings; above for royal ancestral temples, below for the five sufferings and ghostly souls; how could it be only for seven ancestors? This is to inspire filial piety, hence it is said for the departed ancestors.

On the tenth month, long fast, recite this scripture, for emperors, rulers, ministers, and sons, to pacify and secure the nation’s fate, preserving the heaven’s permanence. Generation after generation without end, long as human rulers, pacifying their regions, men call it great peace. On the eight festival days recite this scripture, becoming a true man of the nine palaces.

Youxi says: Meaning the four beginnings, two divisions, two solstices, the eight festival days. All are great festive auspicious meetings of the heavens, the days to check and examine students’功 and faults. If on those days one can fast and recite, one can become a true man of the nine palaces. Because the nine palaces except the central supreme place revolve around the eight palaces, corresponding to the eight festivals; since they correspond to their days, reciting on those days achieves this realm. ○ Shaowei says: One origin has three palaces, three origins have nine palaces. Also it is explained: The eight festival days each have eight history gods to observe men’s good and evil, so the eight festival days must be cultivated and recited. Why on the eight festival days become a true man of the nine palaces? Because the eight festival days are the eight trigrams, left three and right seven etc., combined with the central palace as head and foot matching the nine palaces, hence called true man of the nine palaces.

On the day of birth, recite this scripture, the soul and spirit clear and correct, myriad Qi long preserved, not undergoing suffering and affliction, the body having brightness.

Youxi says: The birth day is the year’s day, only inspecting one’s功 and faults, thus ordering fasting and recitation on that day. Moreover, men regard Qi as root, spirit as foundation. With Qi preserved the spirit is correct, with the foundation firm the roots are deep. Inner spirit and Qi correspond, outer brightness naturally arises. Thus no worries arise, whence affliction? Since reciting on one’s birth day preserves one’s spirit and Qi, the sages’ acts all have their reasons; by this reasoning the principle of cultivating the true is clear. ○ Shaowei says: When spirit is harmonious and Qi smooth, they hear the spiritual sound and become clear and correct, perceive the void white and become bright. ○ The commentary says: On the birth day the life official descends to inspect men’s good and evil, so one must also cultivate this scripture. If a man is evil, evil Qi enters the body; if good, righteous Qi returns to oneself, thus eternally preserving and not undergoing suffering.

The three realms’ attendants, the five emperors’ escorts, myriad gods pay homage, names inscribed in the upper heavens.功 full and virtue complete, flying and ascending to the Supreme Purity.

Youxi says: The attendants of the three realms are the three realms’ demon kings’ attendants. The five emperors’ escorts are the five directions’ heavenly emperors’ arrival and departure escorts. Thus all the spirits gather in court, name books and imperial registers,功 full and virtue perfect, ascending in broad daylight, flying to Supreme Purity. ○ Shaowei says: Lu says: Supreme Purity is the central capital. According to the Longqiao Scripture: Above the four Brahmas are the Three Purities. Supreme Purity has twelve heavens, the abode of the nine immortals; above is the Upper Purity with twelve heavens, the abode of the nine true ones; above that is the Jade Purity with twelve heavens, abode of the nine saints. These thirty-six heavens are all unspoiled realms. The Dongshen Scripture says: The Three Purities heaven is natural transformation. Standing in the void, seven treasures’ palaces, neither born nor perishing, a hundred spirits attend.

The Dao says: On days of cultivating the Way, all should bathe with fragrant water, fast and enter the chamber facing east.

Youxi says: Days of cultivating the Way are the days of holding and reciting this scripture. Fearing men cannot always hold this, it says days of cultivating the Way, also the auspicious days mentioned before. Each time bathing in fragrant water, then entering a separate chamber to fast and purify the mind, cleansing and being without action. If one lives in the mountains with little strength, one may also in one’s sleeping chamber always keep it neat, first putting on garments and washing, placing the scripture on the altar, then burning incense in the scripture chamber, performing rites, kneeling and opening. Now the purpose of cultivation and recitation is to take the scripture in the chamber, sitting facing east. Burning incense and reading aloud, focusing the mind and eyes, softly chanting. If simply reciting hastily with many mistakes, then one must stop, reading thirty characters above, not allowing haste; if greedy for the number of recitations, it becomes loss of功, a great error. Modulating voice and chanting to harmonize spirit and make the soul smooth, always allowing fragrant Qi to flow continuously in the chamber. At this chapter, follow the method of bowing.

Knock the teeth thirty-two times to communicate. Hear the thirty-two heavens above, bow the heart thirty-two times.

Shaowei says: The Zhenyu says: knocking the teeth gathers the spirit; swallowing saliva harmonizes the real. The Yi says: the Emperor issues from Zhen; Zhen is the place of longevity, the sovereign of all heavens, hence facing east. First imagine the imperial ancestors and bow; then each heavenly emperor in turn, imagining and bowing, thus taking the full thirty-two.

Close the eyes and meditate, sitting amid the blue, yellow, and white three-coloured cloud Qi.

Shaowei says: Mysterious Qi is blue; primordial Qi is yellow; initial Qi is white. Imagine these three Qi.

Within and without dense and dark, there are Azure Dragon, White Tiger, Vermilion Bird, Mysterious Tortoise, Lions, White Cranes, arranged left and right, sun and moon shining. Illuminating within the chamber, producing a perfect image, light shining to the ten directions, thus clear. The secret spell says:

Youxi says: Then burn incense and half-open the eyes. The hands rest silently on the knees, then knock the teeth thirty-two times. Each knock responds to one heaven. When finished, imagine rising and bowing to the thirty-two heavenly emperors, beginning from the east and north, then proceeding around the four directions, each bow imagining one emperor; when bowed, close the eyes and imagine. Sitting down, naturally there are blue, yellow, and white three-coloured cloud Qi, soon filling the chamber, dense and flourishing. To the left is the Azure Dragon, to the right the White Tiger, before is the Vermilion Bird, behind the Mysterious Tortoise; the lions on either side in two rows of eight, facing one another; the White Crane with the lions. The sun before, the moon behind, brightly illuminating the chamber, producing light images, illuminating the ten directions. After this imagining, review what one imagines, clear as seeing. The secret spell is to move the mouth without sound.

The Supreme Mysterious Primordial Dao Lord summons from the minister’s body the three-five功曹, left and right officials and attendants, incense-bearing jade youths, message-carrying jade maidens, the five emperors’ direct talismans, direct-day incense officials, each thirty-two in number, opening and closing as spoken: Today's auspiciousness, long fast, cultivation of the supreme scripture, boundless deliverance of men. The ministers and the first and second rotations of the scripture receive life, wishing the utterance to be thorough, directly governing before the Supreme Thirty-two Heavens Primordial Supreme Emperor.

Shaowei says: The Primordial Supreme Emperor is another title of the Heavenly Honoured One.

Finished. Drawing in Qi thirty-two times,

Shaowei says: Drawing in Qi means drawing in with the mouth, not drawing out. Still imagine the thirty-two heavens’ Qi colours in their original heavens, in sequential order, beginning from the august ancestors.

Recite facing east.

Youxi says: Having uttered the incantation, no need for full annotation; briefly noting the essentials only. The direct-day incense officials are the thirty-two officials of the heavens. They come down to inspect and report upward. Today's auspiciousness means the auspicious days of the three origins and eight festivals. It always says: today is an auspicious day, so one must fast. The ministers and the first and second refer to later sun, moon, heaven and earth, stars, and rulers, multitudes and people. At ordinary times it means ministers and ancestors. The Primordial Supreme Emperor is not the Primordial Heavenly Honoured One. The Supreme Emperor is exalted and equal to the Primordial, hence entitled so. Thus the Primordial title is not a name of one honoured alone. After the incantation, draw in the three-coloured cloud Qi by the nose, inhaling and swallowing. After thirty-two times, penetrate within one form, then recite the scripture. Burning incense and reciting: the first round, recite from the preface, then imagine; subsequent rounds, recite directly from the Primordial Beginning Dongxuan title, maintaining one imagination each time, completing ten passes is best. If in haste, rising briefly suffices; if the scripture lasts long, then return to the start, resuming the imagination. ○ Shaowei says: From the Primordial Beginning Dongxuan onward it is called scripture.

Commentaries by Yan Dong of Qi, Xue Youxi of Tang, Li Shaowei, Cheng Xuanying, collected by Chen Jingyuan of Song

The Supreme Excellent Mysterious Scripture of the Primordial Beginning’s Boundless Deliverance of Men

Youxi says: The previous title also mentions the Great Supreme Dongxuan Lingbao; this title simply says Primordial Beginning Boundless Deliverance of Men; the preface title Great Supreme clarifies the scripture ordered by the Great Supreme. The former title is the name of the entire headquarters; the latter refers to one scripture’s name. Supreme Excellent Mysterious Scripture has the same meaning as the first annotation. ○ Shaowei says: The former is the Way Lord’s preface to the scripture, thus marked by the Way’s words; this is the Heavenly Honoured One’s own words, thus written as Primordial Beginning as the title. Also the natural former is the Way Lord’s minor preface; after chaos is the Heavenly Honoured One’s main chapter.

Primordial Beginning Dongxuan, Lingbao Original Chapter,

Dong says: Yuan means beginning. Born before heaven, hence called beginning; also means great, great encompassing all, hence called great; also means Qi, subtle and penetrating all, hence called Qi; also means void, without form or shadow, hence called void; also means spirit, able to transform and change, hence called spirit; also means Dao, the scripture says: The Dao that can be spoken is not the eternal Dao. The bright eternal Dao has no shape and cannot be named, hence only its form is briefly spoken. Beginning knotting: Qi first knots, hence called knotting; also beginning: the jade character first opens, hence called beginning; also transformation: transforming heaven and earth, hence called transformation; also extremity: the head of myriad things, hence called extremity; also end: the end without end, hence called end. The scripture says: Nameless heaven and earth begin; again: the world has beginning, called the mother of the world; again: the beginning established names, hence called: the beginning gave birth to one. One is heaven. Heaven is born from the beginning, showing beginning is also origin. Meeting in origin. At the time origin was born, no heaven, no earth, no gods, no ghosts, obscure and vast, undifferentiated; original Qi first knots, thus forming the jade character.

Jade means essence of nature. Essence emits light to form heaven and earth, sun, moon, stars; thus transforming the Primordial Honoured Spirit, showing its spirituality; thus transforming heaven, earth, sun, moon, stars, to nurture myriad things. After heaven and earth and myriad things are born, and names arise, showing the Primordial Beginning’s creation. Naming Primordial Beginning shows knowledge of the return of beginning and end. Dong means brightness. Illuminating the limitless, hence called brightness. Also means thorough. Thorough and reaching the limitless, hence called thorough. Xuan means void. Deep and empty, hence called void. Qi knots and forms the jade character within the void and thorough, illuminating the four directions, manifesting the Dragon Han, hidden in Yan Kang, prior to Chi Ming, shining at Kai Huang, reaching the Supreme Emperor. Spirit means all saints’ common name. Treasure means all saints’ precious. Chapter means writing. The jade character first emerges, its form like a seal, eight corners hanging rays, its colour shining brightly, thorough and responding limitless. In heaven it is spirit; on earth it is treasure; the void and thorough is spirit; entering storage is treasure, hence called Lingbao. The Great Supreme Way Lord explains its origin. ○ Shaowei says: The Primordial Beginning’s subtle words, universal in mystery, the spiritual script precious, rhyme and sound forming chapters.

Supreme Excellent Beginning, ten times delivering men.

Dong says: Supreme means the original Qi first condenses the three Qi of blue, yellow, white, establishing the three palaces of the Upper Origin. Its first palace is named the Xuandu Yuanyang Seven Treasures Purple Pole Palace, the Qi of first Yang, governing the upper true nature, the Jade Void Supreme Emperor, the various heavenly emperors, the Supreme Great Spirits; their officials number five hundred million five thousand five hundred fifty-five millions. The blue Yang Qi within, its officials also number five hundred million five thousand five hundred fifty-five millions, all formed by natural blue Yang Qi becoming men, wearing blue feathered flying garments. Within the palace is the prolongation talisman; Qi from the eight directions suddenly arrives, instantly becoming men. Destroying the talisman and burning the body, then following smoke to transform back into Qi. The Supreme Xuandu Left and Right and Middle three offices: the left office governs birth, the Grand Sun Fire Official’s register; the right office governs death, the Great Yin Water Official’s register; the middle office governs birth and death, sin and merit, the wind knife’s register. Each office governs ninety million officials, overseeing birth, death, sin, and merit in twelve departments. The left palace is named the Supreme Xuandu Yuanghuang Supreme Ultimate Left Palace. The Yuanghuang Qi governs the upper true, those attained the Way and those not attained, cultivating true men and women, life and death registers. The palace has a summoning talisman. The right palace is named the Supreme Xuandu Dongbai Supreme Ultimate Right Palace; the Heavenly Origin Dongbai Qi governs the upper true, those attained the Way, and those not attained, the registers of sins and death. The palace has the Bright True office, its officials and ranks as the Purple Pole Palace. The Upper Origin grade of heavenly officers has three palaces, each with three offices, governing twelve departments, thirty-six in all, governing the Yuanyang above and the great void in the midst, the name of nature, universally governing the attained upper true. On the days of the three origins, they assemble to check Yin and Yang, water, fire, and the wind knife’s three offices, examining officers of thirty-six departments, blue and black ledgers, reporting to Purple Pole
