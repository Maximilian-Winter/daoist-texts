# Diagram of the Supreme Grade Sublime Scripture of the Spirit Treasure for Delivering Men

Title of the Scripture: Diagram of the Supreme Grade Sublime Scripture of the Spirit Treasure for Delivering Men. Compiled by the Daoist Liu Yuandao at the end of the Northern Song. The original consisted of three scrolls; now only the middle and lower two remain. The source of the base text is the Section of the Cave of Reality in the Taoist Canon of the Orthodox Tradition, under the category of Spirit Diagrams.

The Thirty-five Divisions of the Supreme Qi of the Primordial Origin

The Seven Primary Stars of the Northern Dipper, together with the Twenty-eight Mansions of the Four Quarters, make Thirty-five Divisions. The Primordial Qi is gathered in the Upper Heaven to preside over the creation of transformation. The Northern Dipper is the Central Dipper. The Book of Historical Records, the Heavenly Officers Chapter, says: "The Dipper is the Imperial Chariot, moving at the centre, overseeing the four regions. It divides Yin and Yang, establishes the four seasons, balances the five elements, shifts the solar terms, and sets all the calendars; all are connected with the Dipper." Now this is drawn to observe the directional images. I have, foolishly, fixed this chapter according to the Diagram of the Listed Mansions.

I look up to the Diagram of the Thirty-five Divisions of the Supreme Qi of the Primordial Origin.

The Thirty-two Heavens: General Summary of the Hidden and Secret

The Great Yellow Emperor once arrived at the Supreme Brightness, the Seven Luminaries, and the Six Heavens of the Mayi, constituting the Desire Realm; the Void and Emptiness, surpassing the Balance, to the Infinite Tanshi, eighteen heavens, constituting the Form Realm; the Clear Court, the Dawn Crossing, to the Supreme Element, the Four Heavens of the Exquisite Joyful Sanctuary, constituting the Formless Realm. These are called the Three Realms. The Supreme Void is without limit and eternally harmonized; proceeding to the Supreme Ultimate, the Four Heavens of the Nurturing Jia-Yi are the seed people. Now examining the scripture, it is divided into ten matters: First, the names of the heavens, fixed at the beginning of the kalpa. Second, the titles of the Emperors, commanded by the Primordial. Third, the secret names of the Emperors, the names of the heavenly Emperors. Fourth, what the heavenly Emperors preside over, the office of the Constant Way. Fifth, the Qi of the Mansions connected and illuminating, descending to link the Twenty-eight Mansions. Sixth and Seventh, the names and colours of the Qi, the colours of the Yuan-Liang division of directions. Eighth, the Great Brahma Secret Language, the inner sound, composed by the Dao Lord. The matters are fully explained in the lower scroll, in the chapter called "The Source of the Inner Sound." Ninth, the division of boundaries, ascending and descending. Tenth, the lifespan of the heavenly people, the numbers of short and long life. This diagram is the most precious of the treasure scriptures; those who recite and hold it should carefully observe and practise it. Foolishly, I have combined Chen Jingyuan’s meaning, the commentaries of He Xuanying, Li Shaowei, Xue Youqi, and Yan Dong, and the Mixed-Origin Diagram Wings, the Hollow Spirit Chapter Scripture, and the Inner Sound Jade Character Scripture to fix this chapter.

Explanation of the Qi of the Connected Mansions

The Twenty-eight Heavens of the Four Cardinal Directions, each Heaven corresponds to the Qi of one Mansion. The Four Directions and Four Heavens each correspond to the Brahma Qi between two Mansions. Also, the equal descending intersections: the Heaven at the Northeast corresponds again to the Mansion at the Northwest, for the Qi arises and turns upward like a ram’s horn. Though the principle is subtle, the meaning is clear; yet one might be perplexed about the directions and dimensions. Therefore this diagram is made to clarify it.

The names and titles of the Five Elders, Five Emperors, Five Dippers, Five Heavenly Demon Kings, and Five Great Demon Kings, and their charges, must be known by those who recite the scripture.

Division of the Beginning and End of the Scripture

The Heavenly Venerable speaks the scripture in two chapters, with order before and after. The Great Brahma Secret Language also has order before and after. Both are composed by the Dao Lord. The matter is fully explained in the lower scroll in the chapters "The Manifest Treasure Scripture of Sealing and Hiding the World" and "The Source of the Inner Sound." Now separating the beginning and end, dividing the chapters, and following the treasured text to fix the number of characters. The title in all is four thousand five hundred and seventy-four characters. Foolishly, I have combined Chen Jingyuan’s meaning and Zhang Wanfujue’s method to fix this chapter.

Titles of Chapters: The two chapters of the Supreme Dao Lord; the Preface; the Preface to the Treasure Scripture of the Primordial Heavenly Venerable; the Afterword to the Treasure Scripture of the Primordial Heavenly Venerable; the Afterword to the two chapters of the Supreme Dao Lord; the Preface to the Great Brahma Secret Language; the Afterword to the Great Brahma Secret Language.

Number of characters from beginning to end: From the words "In the beginning, the Dao spoke in the Supreme Blue Heaven," to "Facing east reciting the scripture," 1,595 characters. From the Primordial Cave Profound Spirit Treasure chapter to the listing of the Three Realms and Five Emperors in Shangqing, 1,278 characters. From the Primordial Jade Calendar to the falling into the hell of neglect, and the Seven Ancestor Elders, 786 characters. From "The Dao says these two chapters," to "this is indeed the utmost clear and ultimate words," 440 characters. From "Among the various heavens," to "in the middle chapters of the Spirit Book," 19 characters. From "Danlou Ahui," to "Quiet Delivering Men," 256 characters. From "The Dao says among these heavens the Great Brahma Secret Language of boundless sounds," to "great and profound," 186 characters.

The Supreme Grade of the Boundless Delivering Men Sublime Scripture, Diagram of the Middle Scroll

The Supreme Grade of the Boundless Delivering Men Sublime Scripture, Diagram of the Lower Scroll

Master Shouyi of the Palace of Abundance in the Great Clarity, bestowed upon the Purple Daoist Liu Yuandao for compilation and arrangement, reciting the two chapters of the true scripture formula.

Whenever the day for reciting the scripture comes, in the pure chamber set a scripture altar and seat facing east; then enter the chamber, turning the back to the seat and facing east, perform three bows. After the bows, turn and face north, then sit. With no fixed posture, slowly turn to the left, facing east, sitting level. Chant the incantation:

> Silent and silent, coming to the supreme origin,  
> Void stands firm like the kalpa blade Ah.  
> Bright and clear, profound and mysterious texts,  
> Who can gauge this remote and secret?  
> Enter once the path of the Great Vehicle,  
> Who can count the many kalpas?  
> Neither birth nor death,  
> Desire to be born from the lotus.  
> Transcending the path of the Three Realms,  
> Compassionate heart unties the world’s net.  
> The true man has supreme virtue,  
> Generation after generation as an immortal.

Upon finishing the incantation, place the hands on the knees, strike the teeth thirty-two times. Close the eyes and retain the thirty-two heavens; in each heaven see an emperor lord. Think of the name of one heaven, and with the heart bow to its emperor. Beginning from the Huangzeng Heaven, following the sun's course, revolving the four quarters, gradually ascending to the Jia-Yi Heaven. In all perform thirty-two bows; though the body does not move, the mind bends and prostrates. After the bows, think of the body immersed in clouds of blue, yellow, and white Qi; in a moment the chamber is full and dense with auspiciousness; to the left is the Azure Dragon, to the right the White Tiger, in front the Vermilion Bird, behind the Mysterious Warrior. The two lions of the twenty-eight sit opposite in two rows; the number of white cranes is the same, also outside the lions. The sun is in front, the moon behind, shining brightly in the chamber, a nine-coloured round image appears above, illuminating all the heavens. Again survey what is retained, densely appearing before the eyes. Silently chant:

> Supreme Profound Origin, Supreme Dao Lord,  
> Summon forth the Three and Five Functionaries within my person,  
> The officers on left and right, the attendants with incense, the jade boys,  
> The messengers jade maidens, the Five Emperors’ talismans,  
> The incense officers of the day, each thirty-two persons,  
> To open and close what is spoken.  
> What is spoken are the matters of Heaven and Earth, Sun and Moon, Stars and Mansions, Country rulers, teachers and friends, ancestors, oneself, and the people’s prayers.  
> When incantation reaches the opening and closing words, they must be pronounced.  
> Today is auspicious and prosperous, the long fast and pure hall, cultivating to the utmost scripture, boundless deliverance of men.  
> Myself and A and B, A and B to be pronounced, the wishes all the same as above, that is to say myself and so-and-so or some matter.  
> Turning the scripture to receive life, may the opening above be thorough, directly controlling the supreme thirty-two heavens of the Primordial Supreme Emperor on the throne.

Upon finishing the incantation, slowly in the midst of the thirty-two heavens, one heaven draws the boundary and swallows it. Following the previous method. Stop. Then open the eyes and recite the two chapters. After finishing the scripture, face south, leave the seat, perform three bows, and withdraw. Foolishly, I have combined Chen Jingyuan’s meaning and Zhang Wanfujue’s method to fix this chapter.

Generally thus, the matters within a bright chamber need not open the door facing south.

Chanting the Inner Sound Formula

Chant the sixty-four characters of the East, from Danlou Ahui to the Four Images’ Hu Yuan. Sit level, strike the teeth nine times, think of the nine-coloured dragons guiding front and back, the ninefold blue clouds covering the whole body. Silently chant:

> Red brightness opens the diagram,  
> The eight Qi return to truth.  
> Presiding over the Profound Gate,  
> The Great Blue Emperor.  
> Flowing transformation to the nine outer regions,  
> Entwining and clinging to my body.  
> The Spirit Sounds of the Eight Writings,  
> The sixty-four chapters.  
> Thoroughly illumining Heaven and Earth,  
> To unite with me as immortal.  
> Moving and bringing the dragon chariot,  
> Ascending the imperial carriage.  
> Finished, drawing in the Qi with nine swallows, recite it.

Chant the sixty-four characters of the South, from Nan Yan Dongfu to the Divine Tassel from the Palace. Sit level, strike the teeth three times, think of the vermilion phoenix soaring before, the triple red clouds covering the body. Silently chant:

> The Three No’s wander,  
> The spirit phoenix comes flying.  
> Jade sound of eight characters,  
> Radiant purple micro.  
> Auspicious day of great celebration,  
> My Dao opens thoroughly.  
> Vermilion red nourishes sweetness,  
> Absorbing the spirit’s radiance.  
> Body born of water and fire,  
> Red robe and feathered garment.  
> Ascending to the void mysterious steps,  
> Feet treading the phoenix ladder.  
> Revolving the eight heavens,  
> The seven ancestors accompanying.  
> Finished, drawing in the Qi with three swallows, recite it.

Chant the sixty-four characters of the West, from Daoli Chanyou to Bai Kong Du Xian. Sit level, strike the teeth seven times, think of the white tiger and lions guarding front and back, the sevenfold white clouds covering the body. Silently chant:

> The seven Qi of golden spirit,  
> The eight heavenly honored spirits.  
> White tiger driving the carriage,  
> Lions supporting the shaft.  
> The seven heroes entwining,  
> Refining me into an immortal.  
> Body ascending golden light,  
> Illuminating pure clouds.  
> Changes within and without,  
> Ascending into the cave gate.  
> The seven ancestors emerge at night,  
> The nine nether regions stirring souls.  
> Countless kalpas open deliverance,  
> Following the course enduring long.  
> Finished, drawing in the Qi with seven swallows, recite it.

Chant the sixty-four characters of the North, from Huo Wu Zi Yu to Youji Duren. Sit level, strike the teeth five times, think of the flying dragon and mysterious warrior, their wings and canopy dense; the divine boy and jade maidens, feathered garments flying. Black clouds fivefold cover the body. Silently chant:

> Profound Heaven wanders,  
> Flowing light of the highest purity.  
> Great abundance begins movement,  
> The eight characters shining high.  
> Flying profound clearing sky,  
> Cavernous Yin self-arising.  
> Five no’s entwining,  
> Pouring into my form.  
> Crown and belt of the northern single,  
> Receiving refining of the cave spirit.  
> Kidney house issues north,  
> Inner and outer shining essence.  
> Flying through the Three Realms,  
> Roaming in the purple court.  
> The seven ancestors together blessed,  
> Joyful in the kalpa’s age.  
> In the forest of seven treasures,  
> Returning to the embryo and renewed birth.  
> Long night departing,  
> Southern palace records the name.  
> Yellow Empress with white bamboo slips,  
> Generation after generation becoming immortals.  
> Finished, drawing in the Qi with five swallows, recite it.

Reciting the Two Chapters of the True Scripture Formula

In the first month of the long Qi, recite this scripture to sever the earthbound bonds of the departed souls of former generations, delivering them to the Southern Palace above. In the seventh month of the long Qi, recite this scripture and the body attains spirit immortality, recorded by the Heavens. The Yellow Empress with white bamboo slips cuts off death and raises life. In the tenth month of the long Qi, recite this scripture for the king and imperial lord, lords and ministers, fathers and sons, to pacify and secure the kingdom’s fate and preserve the heaven’s long existence. Generation after generation never ceasing, long to be ruler of men. Pacify the four quarters, the people praise the great peace. On the days of the eight festivals recite this scripture, to become a True Man of the Nine Palaces; on the day of one’s birth recite this scripture, the soul and spirit become pure and correct, myriad Qi endures, free from suffering and distress, the body shines with light. The Three Realms guard and attend, the Five Emperors officiate the welcome, myriad spirits come to court, names are recorded in the upper heaven. When merit is full and virtue complete, one flies to ascend to Shangqing. Recite it ten times and the heavens record the merit; recite it a hundred times and one’s name is delivered to the Southern Palace; recite it a thousand times and the Demon Kings protect and welcome; recite it ten thousand times and the Way is complete, ascending to the Supreme Void.

If one can meet this moment and recite according to the formula, above all heavenly disasters are dispelled, the emperors and kings are safeguarded below, poisons and harms are removed, to deliver the multitude of people; in the midst, ancestors are drawn forth, and oneself attains the Way. This may be called the majestic Great Brahma, alone treading the Jade Capital.

Proof of the Inner Sound

The sound of the Great Brahma of the East, recited for nine years, each of the eight heavens attended by eight jade maidens with blue waists and eight jade boys with blue splendor, guarding the body form, bringing down the essence of the Blue Teeth, the body born bright, thoroughly seeing the void. Ten thousand times the Way is attained, flying to Shangqing, the seven ancestors together blessed, all ascending to the Southern Palace.

The sound of the Great Brahma of the South, recited for three years, each of the eight heavens attended by eight great cinnabar jade maidens and eight solar jade boys, guarding the body form, bringing down the essence of the three cinnabar Qi, returning white and preserving the form. Ten thousand kalpas unshaken, the seven ancestors transcend and ascend, entering the Hall of Blessing, returning to the embryo of the immortal family, thus obtaining rebirth.

The sound of the Great Brahma of the West, recited for seven years, each of the eight heavens attended by eight pure spirit jade boys guarding the body form, bringing down the essence of the Supreme Element’s seven illuminations, preserving years and form, ten thousand kalpas of youthful countenance. Celebrating with the seven ancestors, ascending and delivering to the Southern Palace, returning to the embryo and rebirth, generation after generation immortals.

The sound of the Great Brahma of the North, recited for five years, each of the eight heavens attended by eight Supreme Origin jade boys guarding the body form, bringing down the essence of the origin nourishing the five Qi, restoring years and preserving brightness, safeguarding the life of the Three Purities, blessing the nine mysteries, generation after generation flying and ascending.

If one can follow the formula and recite the inner sounds of the Four Directions, there is nothing not dispelled, nothing not removed, nothing not delivered, nothing not accomplished. Flying above the world to observe, the Emperor on high sings from afar, myriad spirits come to court, the Three Realms serve the pavilion. Inspiring and subduing myriad spirits, purifying the ten directions, the Way is complete and the work accomplished; the servant serves the Three Realms. Foolishly, I have fixed this chapter according to Zhang Wanfujue’s method.

Manifest Treasure Scripture of Sealing and Hiding the World

The Heavenly Venerable first, in the Supreme Blue Heaven, expounded this scripture to bestow upon the Dao Lord. Again, in the Supreme Cinnabar Heaven gave the Great Brahma’s sound. After the Dao Lord completed the preface, the Upper Heaven treasured it, hidden in the Mysterious Capital Jade Capital Purple Micro Upper Palace. Sealed and hidden with utmost care, not transmitted to the sage. Later, the Western Queen Mother ascended and requested from the Heavenly Emperor to deliver from the calamity of the Jia-Shen year, entrusting it to the cultivators of reality; thus it gradually spread among men. This scripture includes the secret song sounds of the various heavenly emperors and the supreme spiritual demon kings, internally speaking of the heavens and earth’s kalpa transformations, the names and titles of myriad spirits, the mingling of Yin and Yang, the origin of the primal blackness of life and transformation; its meaning cannot be fully attained, its principle cannot be fully understood. Those who obtain enlightenment of the Way can naturally comprehend. The Upper Heaven transmits once in forty thousand kalpas, in the human world once in forty years. Leakage and negligence bring calamity upon the nine ancestors and long servitude in the nether Yin; can one not be careful? Can one not be careful? Foolishly, I have fixed this chapter according to Li Shaowei’s notes.

The Source of the Inner Sound

The Heavenly Venerable at the Cypress Ridge Seat in the Bright Red World, at that time clouds and mists thickened, for three days and nights the dark Yin did not dissipate. The Five Elders, Supreme Emperors, reported to the Heavenly Venerable: 'Today at court, such a thing was never seen before.' The Heavenly Venerable expounded the teaching, causing the mountains and seas to become silent, heaven and earth to be purified. Now the daylight is darkened, heaven and men are fearful, we have doubts and do not understand the cause. The Heavenly Venerable said: 'Today the heavens manifest auspiciousness, spiritual responses arise naturally, the jade characters shine brilliantly, veiling and emitting light. All cause the four seats to close their eyes and wait. Suddenly the heavenly Qi is suddenly opened, the darkness disappears, the five colours of light illuminate the ten directions. Each has a spirit book, one zhang square in characters, appearing in emptiness. The writings shine brilliantly, eight corners with hanging rays, the essence light dazzles the eyes and cannot be looked upon. The Heavenly Venerable broadly informs the myriad spirits: these spirit books are the eight assemblies; their characters have no fixed form, their meaning is profound and secret; you all cannot search for details.' Then he commands the Heavenly Sages to annotate the characters and explain their sounds, to bestow upon the Dao Lord, in all two hundred and fifty-six characters. The Dao Lord arranged and composed the text. This is called the Great Brahma Secret Language. It is prefaced and attached to the one Yu early after. The Heavenly Sages once descended at Mount Emei in the time of the Yellow Emperor, imparting to the Emperor the method of the three one five teeth, then ascending again to heaven. Foolishly, I have combined the Inner Sound Scripture and the Biographies of the Immortals to fix this chapter.
