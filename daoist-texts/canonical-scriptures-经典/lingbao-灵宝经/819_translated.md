Diagram of the River Chart and Image Numbers

Heaven One Earth Two, Heaven Three Earth Four, Heaven Five Earth Six, Heaven Seven Earth Eight, Heaven Nine Earth Ten; the number of Heaven is five, the number of Earth is five. The Five Positions correspond and each has their own union. The number of Heaven is twenty-five; the number of Earth is thirty. The total of Heaven and Earth numbers is fifty-five; this is the reason for the formation of transformations and the operation of ghosts and spirits. The Five Directions, excluding the original three numbers of generation, thus the dragon issues from fire, the tiger is born towards water, the mother conceals the embryo of the child, the child returns to the mother’s womb. All are the marvels of the Seven Returns of the Golden Elixir, the Nine Returns of the Vermilion, the marvel of the golden liquid. Therefore, it is not different from the meaning of fourteen in the scripture.

The Baopuzi says: "The Mysterious Female of the One Family is not the heart, kidney, nose, mouth, liver, lung, food passage, bladder, or mud pellet. Knowing this one to the end, then at the Winter Solstice the fire season, the bathing with medicines, the shedding of the foetus and the binding of the foetus, all are within this. This aperture is the aperture of thunder and lightning; when attained, thunder and dew seize the mechanism, there is no need to seek without. The perfect man’s ascent and rising is employed in this. The Way and method respond and communicate; other matters are only incidental."

Diagram of the Mutual Use of Thunder and Lightning Machinery

Thunder is the pivot of Heaven; its nature is good, its lord is life, its body is yang, its image is yin; therefore Jia, Bing, Geng, Ren are yang thunder.

Lightning is the mechanism of Earth; its nature is evil, its lord is death, its body is yin, its image is yang; therefore Yi, Ji, Ding, Xin are yin lightning.

Thunder and lightning mutually employ each other.

Heaven and Earth are the same body; the sun and moon are united; moving, there is thunder and lightning.

Diagram of the Great and Profound Mystery

Heaven has no mist nor foulness; Earth has no demons nor dust.

Dark wisdom, cave clear, great and profound mystery.

The True Book of the Limitless, the sincere without delusion; within the true centre there is an Emperor; outside sincere is no other spirit. Mixing and harmonizing the nature of Heaven and Earth, scourging and driving the body with wind and thunder. That which is nature and body is the person of utmost truth and utmost sincerity.

Diagram of the Round Heaven and Square Earth Cultivation

This diagram corresponds with the diagram of the precelestial trigrams of the square and round; in the centre each eye is a character of the spirit book's bureau, and together with the two former diagrams observed reciprocally, the mystery of Heaven and Earth may be seen—not exhausted by intention.

The Scripture of the Supreme Cavernous Mysterious Spirit Treasure of the Supreme Limitless Salvation of Men

The Supreme is the Great. The Upper is the Honoured. The Uppermost of the Upper is the Utmost Honour. Cavernous and Mysterious are titles of rank. The scripture has three caverns: Dongzhen, presided over by the Primordial; Dongxuan, presided over by the Spirit Treasure; Dongshen, presided over by the Way Virtue. This scripture was originally proclaimed by the Primordial and recorded by the Dao Sovereign, hence it is entitled "Dongxuan Spirit Treasure." The orthodox scripture merely calls it "The Primordial Supreme Scripture of Limitless Salvation of Men," so as to distinguish the former and latter prefaces. The words of the Way are the words of the Dao Sovereign. Combined and named "The Scripture of the Supreme Cavernous Spirit Treasure," in order that by the Dao Sovereign’s inheritance of the Primordial’s intent, limitless salvation of men is the purpose of one scroll. Among the three caverns and thirty-six departments, this scripture is first, hence called the supreme scripture. Wondrous means the utmost refined and subtle, profound and difficult to exhaust. Scripture means the path, the daily use of cultivating truth, the common way. Cultivated within is called elixir, namely the ancestral vitality of the precelestial unity. Above is no further ancestor, only the Way supreme. Cave means hollow and clear; mysterious means deep and tranquil. Spirit is the true nature enduring; treasure is the original destiny flowing. One who can cultivate it in the body can save men, the salvation is boundless, not measurable. To prove the superior path is not apart from the self-heart. This heart is the Way is the scripture; therefore void and spiritual without obstruction, and the salvation of men is limitless.

The Way says: "In former times, in the beginning of the Azure Heaven, in the Blue Vault of the Void, on the Great Floating Li Land, received the Primordial limitless highest grade salvation."

The Way speaks the words of the Supreme Jade Morning Dao Sovereign. The preface title preceding is that the Dao Sovereign relates how he formerly received this scripture and the cause of its composition. The Beginning Azure is the Azure Heaven of the Nine Qi of the East, one of the Nine Heavens of the Divine Firmament. This Heaven is condensed from Brahman Vitality, pure and spacious azure clouds, hence called the Blue Vault. The Qi of Blue Mist condenses into a jade forest and precious trees, the spirit wind blows and stirs, forming the song of emptiness, called the Empty Song. The Great Floating Li Land is the name of the Eastern Extreme State. The Dao Sovereign says that formerly in the Beginning Azure Heaven on Floating Li Land, he received the wondrous scripture of the Primordial Heavenly Venerable, broadly salvaging Heaven and men, hence the limitless highest grade. The Land is the Central Palace; the Mysterious is the gate. Its number is five, being the beginning of Heaven and Earth and all things, therefore all prosperity is born of the Land and ends in the Land. This is our mysterious gate, the precious pearl. The primordial spirit is the Primordial itself. All existence’s endless generation and transformation arise from this. The Beginning Azure is the image of wood. Fire is the dragon. The number of Zhen is three; Qian first searches out and produces the eldest son, like Spring occupying the head of the four seasons, all things arise thereby. Yet first water is born, water begets wood; secondly fire is born, fire is born of wood; this is the cycle of the Five Elements, generating endlessly—this principle may be said to be evident.

The Primordial Heavenly Venerable should then speak this scripture, revolving ten times, to summon all directions, then take his seat.

Primordial is also called Qian Yuan and Kun Yuan. Prior to Heaven and Earth, Heaven and Earth are born from it; this is the beginning of all transformations, the ancestor of myriad assemblages, the response title of the Sovereign of the Void, the supreme among all heavens. At that time, the scripture of salvation is proclaimed, revolving ten times to summon the supreme sages of the ten directions, the great assembly in the midst of millet pearls, widely explaining the wondrous contents, then taking the seat and speaking the scripture. The Primordial is the ancestral vitality of the Dharma body, the primordial spirit; called the imperishable true void, originally the self-nature. When speaking this scripture, the ancestral vitality is the body of the elixir, the primordial spirit not dimming, then the heavenly mandate flows and never ceases, circulating the six voids, moving and still without end, coming and going incessantly—this is the revolving ten times. Ten times are the number five of generation and the number five of completion; ten is the perfect number of Heaven and Earth. Cultivating the elixir takes ten months before success. The ten directions are odd numbers one, three, five, seven, nine, yang; two, four, six, eight, ten, yin. This is the wondrous use of the returning elixir. Within the mysterious gate, the true yin and true yang Qi are already balanced, then the hundred veins play like rivers, just as the true saints of the ten directions gather without summons.

The great gods of heavenly truth, the highest saints, the wondrous conduct true men, the countless countless hosts of the unmeasured, ride the void and come, fly clouds and cinnabar skies, green chariots and jade wheels, feathered canopies shading, flowing essence and jade light, five colours flourishing, shining throughout the vast space.

All the true immortals of the unmeasured hosts are the five hundred million heavens, sun, moon, stars; the true heavens and earth; the earth and water mansions; the three realms and ten directions of immortals, saints, and sages, not to be reckoned by number. At one time all ride the void, govern the void, travel without stepping, and arrive. Flying clouds and cinnabar skies, riding the three pure clouds, mounted on the crimson mist Qi. The chariots, canopies, all are the diverse divine transformations and myriad forms of the true saints at one time, spiritual and variable beyond measure. Flowing essence and jade light, five colours flourishing, flowing the brilliance of three lights, reflecting each other with jade light, the round image of the immortals and true beings clear and bright; thus the five colours shine brilliantly in the vast space, illuminating clearly and penetrating, cultivated within. When the golden mother returns to the spirit chamber, then with spirit seizing Qi, and Qi refining spirit, lead and mercury restrained and controlled, yin and yang gathered and grouped—this is the assembly of a thousand true and ten thousand saints. In an instant, golden and fire intershine in the spirit chamber, inside and outside bright and clear, flowing essence dazzling in colours, five colours shining splendidly in the vast space.

For seven days and seven nights, the heavens, sun, moon, stars, the celestial pole and jade balance all stay their courses. The divine wind is silent; mountains and seas hide their clouds. Heaven has no floating obscurations; the four Qi are bright and clear. A kingdom, land, mountains, rivers, forests, trees, all equal in rank, no more high or low. Above all are like jade, without difference of colour.

Seven is the number of fire, meaning the seven returns. The Yi says: Seven days come again. All numbers when meeting seven fork and return. The ancient scholars say: Yang is born at the Zi hour; yin is born at Wu; from Wu to Zi is seven and must return. This is the principle of Qian and Kun’s waxing and waning. To speak in one day, from Wu hour to midnight, returning to Zi hour; in one year, from the first day of May the yin is born, to November returning to the Zi month; in one month, from Wu day about seven days, returning to Zi day. This is the fixed number of the heavenly way. The heavens are the thirty-two heavens. The sun, moon, stars, celestial pole, and jade balance are the whole heaven’s stars and the central dipper of seven stars. At one time the wheels stop turning, the heavenly bodies are in confusion and flowing, revolving without pause. At this time the wheels stop turning and cease; they return to their root, the middle path returns alone. Because it comes quietly and returns, breath does not enter or leave; therefore the divine wind is silent, emotions and thoughts cease, Qi has no up or down; as with the great clouds of mountains and rivers all concealed, the floating obscurations of heaven are also removed, then the four Qi are bright and clear. A kingdom and land is the Floating Li Land. Mountains, rivers, forests, and trees are all equal; no more high or low. When the scripture is spoken, spirits are clear, eyes are steady, pulses stay, heart stops; nature returns and emotions are darkened, all mechanisms are extinguished; all are equal. The self-nature is like the clarity of jade, without difference of colour. The learner who can forget form and cut off thought, all existence is empty, the nature is calm, a single truth alone revealed; then the image of the body, all pulses stop, the true lead appears in colour. This is called all the land becoming like jade. The mysterious master says: This is the great stillness, the spirit light shining clearly, seeing the realm of jade purity.

All true ones attend the seat; the Primordial Venerable sits mysteriously floating on the five-coloured lion.

The Primordial is the primordial spirit. The mysterious seat is the spirit chamber. Thus floating five zhang from the earth, not resting on form or appearance. Five colours are the wondrous transforming Qi. The lion is the heart’s knowledge. The multitude of true ones attend the seat on left and right; the primordial dharma body sits mysteriously floating; the five Qi face the crimson palace. The five colours are bright and clear; the primordial spirit dwells in the spirit chamber, the dark heart seizes Qi, the three realms blend together, the heart’s knowledge is bright and wondrous, piercing the great void; thus the colours of the five directions reflect in the central yellow palace.

After one course of scripture, all the great saints of the heavens simultaneously praise it; at this time a kingdom of men and women who were deaf and sick all have their ears opened and become intelligent. After two courses, the blind have their sight restored. After three courses, the mute can speak. After four courses, the lame and sick can rise and walk. After five courses, long illnesses and chronic diseases are all immediately restored. After six courses, white hair returns to black, fallen teeth regrow. After seven courses, the old return to youth, the young all are strong. After eight courses, pregnant women, birds, and beasts conceive and bear; those born and unborn all are generated. After nine courses, the earth’s treasures are emitted, gold and jade dew forms. After ten courses, dry bones are restored to life, all rise as men. At this time in the kingdom, men and women all incline their hearts and all receive protection and salvation, all attain longevity.

The功 of the Nine Returns of the Golden Elixir takes ten months as the embryo’s completion and spirit transformation. The numbers generated in the River Chart proceed from one to ten, generating endlessly. The uses of the Luo Shu, excluding the ten vertical and horizontal, one five and one ten, these are the fixed numbers of the Five Elements of Heaven and Earth, unchanging. How can all things and affairs contravene this? Therefore, after one course of scripture, Heaven One generates Water. Water conceives in Qian Metal, hence the child dwells in the mother’s womb, called the empty Qi metal embryo. Heaven and earth and all things arise from this; water is the beginning of numbers. The great saints of the heavens simultaneously praise; all heavens rejoice. If one can make one Qi circulate, the hundred spirits all are unblocked. The men and women in the kingdom are like the yin and yang Qi of one body. When their Qi is relaxed, the deaf become intelligent. Moreover, Kan corresponds to the ear; once the number is circulated, the deaf are naturally unblocked. After two courses, Earth Two generates Fire. Fire conceives in Xun Wood, hence the mother conceals the embryo of the child, called wood and fire in the same position. Moreover, Li corresponds to the eye; when the number two is circulated, Li is bright and shining, no eye is not clear. After three courses, Heaven Three generates Wood. Zhen Wood conceives in Gen Water; sound belongs to Metal. Metal originally conquers Wood but instead shelters the embryo in Metal’s home; thus Wood is cut off at Shen but conceived at You; this shows wood conceals metal. When Metal and Wood are restrained, there must be sound; thus the mute can also speak. After four courses, Earth Four generates Metal. Dui Metal conceives in Kun Earth; hence Earth can generate Metal. The foot corresponds to Wood, and after the fourth course the lame and sick rise and walk. Metal is cut off at Yin but conceived at Mao; Metal once shelters the embryo in Wood, this shows Metal contains Wood. After five courses, Heaven Five generates Earth. Wu Earth conceives Qi in Li Fire, obtaining the correctness of Heaven and Earth; flowing Wu approaches already, then two Earths form a jade tablet; therefore Kan Wu month essence and Li Yi day light, the sun and moon are united. If man can know cultivation and refine, restrain anger and block desire, preserve heart and nurture nature, and continue the effort of refining oneself without ceasing, then the Great One contains the truth, the mysterious pearl forms the image, united with Heaven and Earth, long life and long vision are not difficult. Why then suffer illness and chronic disease? People’s distress in sickness arises from not knowing the wondrous return. After six courses, Earth Six completes it. Heaven One generates Water; Kan is located at the North, yang within which there is true yin; therefore Qian Metal generates Kan Water and forms true lead. Lead is the mother of Metal; lead is black and Metal white; hence white hair returns to black, teeth falling and regrowing; all respond to returning to the origin. After seven courses, Heaven Seven completes it. Earth Two generates Fire; Li is located at the South, yin within which there is true yang; therefore Xun Wood generates Li Fire and forms true mercury, the seven returns. Li mercury is restrained by Metal and Lead, thus Metal Fire warms and refines. Qian Metal is old yang; Li Fire is young yin; thus the old return to youth, the young all are strong. After eight courses, Earth Eight completes it. Heaven Three generates Wood; Zhen is located at the East; Gen and Zhen combine and form Water; mercury responds to lead Qi and forms sand; sand contains mercury to represent conception; all are precelestial true unity Qi, condensed and united in the compass, producing myriad assemblages, circulating day and night, nourishing the sacred embryo; not the Qi of postcelestial yin dregs can nurture; hence pregnant women conceive, birds and beasts hold embryos, born and unborn all are generated. After nine courses, Heaven Nine completes it. Earth Four generates Metal; Dui is located at the West; Dui Metal combines with Kun Earth; Kan Water hides in the mother’s womb, this is the nine returns. Therefore mercury returns to the earth cauldron and forms treasure; this is one Qi returning to the source. Originating from the empty Qi metal embryo and born, metal essence not yet seen; at this stage metal occupies the original nature, returning to the central palace to become the elixir body. The centre is Earth; Earth is land, hence the earth treasury emits and discharges, gold and jade dew forms. The golden mother dwells in the central palace. After ten courses, Earth Ten completes it. Heaven Five generates Earth; Earth is located in the centre; Earth is the root of all things’ generation. Heaven Five’s Earth is yang Earth; Earth Ten’s Earth is yin Earth. Two Earths overlap to form a jade tablet; hence the returning elixir is called the knife jade tablet. Metal dwells within; this is Qian Metal restraining Li Fire within Kun Earth, the so-called reversal and transformation of the Five Elements. If man can cultivate this, he returns to youth and reverses ageing, transcending the mundane and entering the sacred; hence he can raise the dead and restore life, like the Xu Jia of the Supreme. Therefore it is said dry bones are restored to life, all rise as men. At this time in the kingdom, men and women all incline their hearts. In the kingdom the men and women are equal, all hearing the scripture and teaching, all receive protection and salvation, all attain the way of longevity. The kingdom is like the body; men and women are the yin and yang two Qi. Inclining the heart means yin and yang correspond and mutually attract. The Qi of yin and yang, when harmonized, then the Great One returns to truth, life is born and salvation received, death’s soul is refined; this is called longevity.

The Way says: At this time the Primordial Heavenly Venerable spoke the scripture once; the limitless highest grade supreme gods of the East, the countless hosts of the unmeasured, floated through the air to come. After two courses, the limitless highest grade supreme gods of the South and hosts of the unmeasured floated to come. After three courses, those of the West came; after four, those of the North; after five, Northeast; after six, Southeast; after seven, Southwest; after eight, Northwest; after nine, Above; after ten, Below; all limitless highest grade supreme gods and hosts of the unmeasured floated to come.

This is the Dao Sovereign’s preface of the beginning and end of conferring the scripture. Ten times to save men, ten turns to return the spirit; this scripture and its preface are the main purpose. The Heavenly Venerable spoke the scripture, summoning the limitless hosts of the ten directions, the countless hosts of the unmeasured; all floating in the air they came. The Eastern Brahma Overseer Xu Yan Tian and others of the Zhen Palace Mao position are hosts of the unmeasured. The Southern Yudan Limitless Heaven and others of the Li Palace Wu position are hosts of the unmeasured. The Western Linghua Brahma Assistants and others of the Dui Palace You position are hosts of the unmeasured. The Northern Dongyuan Hua Ying Tian and others of the Kan Palace Zi position are hosts of the unmeasured. The Northeast Gaoxu Qingming Tian and others of the Gen Palace Yin position are hosts of the unmeasured. The Southeast Bolonimi Bujiao Letian and others of the Xun Palace Si position are hosts of the unmeasured. The Southwest Jiran Doushu Tian and others of the Kun Palace Shen position are hosts of the unmeasured. The Northwest Shangshang Chanshan Wuliangshou Tian and others of the Qian Palace Hai position are hosts of the unmeasured. The Above Jiuxiao Shangqing Yuzhen Thirty-six Heavens and others are hosts of the unmeasured. Below the Colorless Realm, the Form Realm, the Desire Realm’s thirty-two heavens, up to the three origins and nine earths’ hosts of the unmeasured, all gather in the Beginning Azure Heaven’s Floating Li Land, hearing the scripture and listening to the Dharma. Cultivated within, the true lead is the medicine; the ancestral mysterious gate is the base of the elixir; this is the Primordial speaking the scripture. The Land is at the centre palace, forming its own ten numbers; the centre is the mysterious gate. The ten courses are the numbers of the generation of Heaven and Earth. The ten directions are the pairing of the Five Elements: one, three, five, seven, nine, the heavenly numbers, twenty-five, yang essence; two, four, six, eight, ten, the earthly numbers, yin blossoms. Yang generates the number five, the root of the Five Elements; Yin completes the number ten, the root of myriad transformations. One and nine, four and six combine to make ten; this is metal and water of the same clan. Two and eight, three and seven combine to make ten; this is wood and fire of the same body. In sum, it is fifty-five, divided among the five directions. The Five Elements reversed, the dragon issues from fire, the tiger is born from water, fire is born from wood, then mercury is drawn from sand; this is the seven returns; vermilion returns to the root. Water is born from metal, then silver restrains lead; this is the nine returns; the golden liquid returns to the true. The Yi says: Heaven and Earth are woven, all things blend harmoniously; these are the limitless and utmost true gods who all arrive. Therefore the base of the elixir is the image of the law, divided into three hundred and eighty-four lines, circulating the fire season, operating the five stars within, the twenty-eight mansions arranged in order, the cauldron urges the three thousand six hundred true Qi, revolving the seventy-two gates, driving the sixty-four hexagrams’ yin symbols, stirring the twenty-four Qi’s yang fire, then the three souls guard the form, the seven spirits return to the body. Within the body are twelve thousand spirits; at one time they hear the commands; this is called the ten turns returning the spirit, myriad Qi all equal to immortality.

After the ten courses conclude, the highest gods of the ten directions all arrive simultaneously. The kingdom’s men and women incline their hearts in reverence; those who come are like fine rain and dense mist; the hosts of the unmeasured fill half the kingdom; the land sinks and is not to be restrained.

At the completion of the ten courses of scripture, the highest gods of the ten directions all assemble simultaneously. No man or woman does not incline their heart; all receive protection and salvation, like hosts of fine rain and dense mist. Half the kingdom is filled, occupying half the land; the Heavenly Venerable’s majestic virtue is so great the earth cannot bear it; the land sinks partially, yet no one can restrain it. The功 of the ten turns of the body complete, then thought and breath and spirit all concentrate, nature returns and life is restored; then true lead returns to the chamber. The Qi of yin and yang of the whole body blend, fumigating the four limbs like the moisture of rain and mist, circulating the six voids, above and below without constancy, coming and going without ceasing; the hosts of the unmeasured fill and overflow; though the kingdom’s land sinks, it cannot be stopped.

At this time, the Primordial suspends a precious pearl, as large as a millet grain, in the void mystery, five zhang above the earth.

The Lord Xin says: The Primordial is the own primordial spirit. The precious pearl is the heart. The Confucians call it the Supreme Ultimate; the Buddhists call it Perfect Awakening; they are one principle. The Daoists also call it the Mysterious Pearl, the Heart Pearl, the Millet Pearl; this is the object. Precious means the utmost refined and true; it is called the Spirit Treasure. Large as a millet grain because its greatness embraces the universe; fine as a hair’s tip because its smallness has no interior; its transformations are unfathomable; therefore it is in the void mystery and cannot be sought by trace. Five zhang above the earth means five is the number of Earth, in the centre of the Five Elements. Like the numbers of generation of the Five Elements, symbolizing the Supreme Ultimate in the void; when the heart is empty, the primordial spirit dwells therein; this is the empty mystery. Is this not the empty Qi metal embryo? Therefore the mysterious master says: This is the Jade Clear precious pearl, the spirit-transformed immortal embryo’s way. According to Xiao Guanfu: The Primordial suspending the pearl means spirit and Dao together. Formerly the scripture’s lion above means the spirit condensed in the chamber, producing existence from non-existence. Now this suspended pearl in the void mystery is beyond spirit and form, entering non-being and exiting being. These are all the Heavenly Venerable’s displays of wondrous transformations, to explain the utmost refined and subtle within, and that the wondrous Way exists therein.

The Primordial ascends and leads the great gods of heavenly truth, highest saints, wondrous conduct true men, the limitless highest gods of the ten directions, and the countless hosts of the unmeasured, all enter the precious pearl. The heavenly men look up and see only a great throng entering the mouth of the pearl; having entered the mouth of the pearl, they know not where they are. The people of the kingdom disperse, the land returns to level, no longer sinking.

The Heavenly Venerable suspends the precious pearl in the void mystery, ascends and leads the three origins and nine saints, the five elders and nine true ones, the great gods of heavenly truth, and the hosts of the unmeasured, all enter the pearl. The heavenly men look up, all are in the void mystery, within the five lights, among innumerable radiances. They see only a great throng entering the mouth of the pearl, then no longer see the realm of the void mystery; hence they know not where they are. The people of the kingdom all disperse, still and unmoving, then the land is level and no longer tilted or sunken. Those not of heavenly truth and highest saints cannot all enter the wondrous mystery of the void, only look up and watch. Those called the limitless highest true gods of the ten directions and the countless hosts of the unmeasured, all enter. Are they not heavenly men? Their own heart pearl is bright and clear, Qi united with spirit and mystery, collecting myriad into one; all the hosts of the unmeasured enter into the mouth of our pearl. Then the six roots are quiet and still, one truth alone revealed; how can there be sunken unevenness or unlevelness?

Within the pearl, the Primordial speaks the scripture to completion; the true ones monitor and confer salvation upon me. At this time joy and celebration are ineffable. The ritual affairs are roughly completed; the heavens return to their positions; in an instant silence remains with no echo.

Within the pearl, the Primordial, having spoken the scripture to completion, the true ones monitor and attend, confer salvation upon the Dao Sovereign. At this time the Dao Sovereign’s joy and celebration are ineffable, beyond words. The ritual affairs of the hosts of the unmeasured are also complete; then all true heavens return to their duties; within the kingdom, all is suddenly quiet and still, no lingering echoes. Within, the primordial spirit dwells in one Qi, blending the nine apertures, illuminating the golden mother, controlling sand and mercury, returning to the cauldron. Working to this point, joy is beyond description. In a moment the work completes; myriad spirits return to origin. Dim, obscure, dark and silent, the image of the precious pearl no longer returns to the limitless.

At this time, the heavenly men meet and encounter the Dharma of the scripture, universally obtaining salvation, fulfilling their allotted years, without injury or harm. The land inclines in reverence, all practice good hearts, do not kill or harm, do not envy or resent, do not lust or steal, do not covet or desire, do not hate or quarrel. Speech is without florid words, mouth without evil sounds; alike in kindness and love, different bones become kin. The country is peaceful and the people abundant, rejoicing in great peace.

After the Heavenly Venerable spoke the scripture and the heavens returned to their seats, upon hearing the scripture and Dharma all universally obtained salvation, all fulfilling their heavenly years, never again interrupted or prematurely cut off. All inclined their hearts in reverence to the scripture and teaching, immediately practising good hearts; all killing, harming, envy, stealing, lust, covetousness, hate, quarrel, are all completely cleansed; thus kindness and love are one body, different bones form kin; then the country is peaceful and the people abundant, only rejoicing in the sign of great peace. Indeed human nature is not without goodness; its un-goodness is all obscured by desires and drowned in habitual passions. Therefore, if one indulges in perverse and extravagant ways, flowing and forgetting to return, surely the heavenly years will be harmed. Only by restraining the hearts of killing, harming, envy, stealing, lust, and covetousness, knowing that people are our fellow countrymen, and things are of one breath, and connecting with kindness and love, can there be state peace, people abundant, and rejoicing in great peace. This should be admonished by those who cultivate and nurture. Having heard the scripture and Dharma, then collect the heart and concentrate spirit, taking refining oneself and saving others as the root. Long after, returning to origin and life, emotions darken and nature is silent, then one may hope for long life and long sight. Adding to this restraining anger and blocking desires, governing emptiness and maintaining stillness, diminishing and diminishing again, movement, stillness, speech, and silence, none is not good; then surely one can be free from killing, harming, lust, and stealing. What of florid words and evil sounds? When this is reached, all stirring and flying creatures are all cherished alike, initially no distinction of kin or stranger. The country is like the body; able to make Qi harmonious, all things grow; though assisting transformation and nurturing, the imperial throne is supported from within. This is the reason for governing the country in peace and securing the people in abundance.

The scripture first issued to one country; those who had sincere hearts beforehand, who honoured and respected the teachings, all obtained salvation in the world.

This says that the Heavenly Venerable first spoke the scripture. The people of one country all followed the Way and practiced; thus the teaching was established. The heart is the spirit and clarity since countless kalpas; though before the scripture and teaching issued, this heart was already complete, hence it was beforehand. Especially when sunk in illusion and delusion, confused and closed, then abandoned and lost. Now by the scripture and Dharma’s salvation, sudden awakening and release, nature returns and life restores, in one day following the Way, myriad illusions all return to truth. To honour is like the root and source. As water’s source is the sea, all flows return to the source. To respect and revere is to be sincere and faithful. Hence all obtain salvation in the world. If forgetting the root and pursuing the end, abandoning the source and seeking the flow, how can one obtain salvation in the world? The scripture is the path of the Way; the heart is the root of the Way; if one can follow the scripture and collect the heart, then one attains the wondrousness of the scripture.

The Way says: What is spoken in the scripture of the Primordial Heavenly Venerable are the inner names and hidden rhymes of the various heavenly emperors; also the secret taboos of the demon kings; the hidden names of the myriad spirits; not the common words of the world.

The inner names of the heavenly emperors are the names of the thirty-two heavens. The emperor’s taboo is the internal sound of the heavenly emperor’s jade character. The hidden rhyme is what the scripture calls the hidden rhymes of the heavens, the natural spiritual sounds of heaven. The demon kings’ taboo are the taboos of the five heavenly demon kings Ba, Yuan, Chou, Bo. The hidden names of the myriad spirits are Wu Ying, Bai Yuan, Tao Kang, He Yan. All are revealed by the Heavenly Venerable and spoken by the Dao Sovereign, and cannot be known by common men in the world. To seek within, as the elixir scriptures say, the sun soul, moon spirit, Geng tiger and Jia dragon, mercury and cinnabar, red lead and black tin, yellow sprout and white snow, the young woman and infant, the old woman and golden lord, the yang fire and yin symbol, mysterious gate and earth cauldron, furnace and tripod, hexagrams, and the like. Although many names and titles, all are the precelestial unity Qi, the ancestor of elixir. Without the teacher’s pointing, how could the common ignorant know?

The highest saints already perfected true men, penetrating mystery and subtlety, able to understand all its chapters. Reciting it ten times, all heavens chant remotely, myriad emperors set rites. Rivers and seas are still, mountains hide clouds. The sun and moon stop their light, the celestial pole does not move. The demons are bound, the spirits vanish. The returning corpse rises from the dead, white bones become men.

This speaks of the efficacy of true men who cultivate and recite. The highest saints already perfected, like the heavenly emperor Gao Zhen Su Xiu Miao Xing, their saintly功 accomplished, no need for practice. True men by refining essence and heart, cultivating spirit and Qi, then their bodies accord with nature, not caught in being or non-being, forever free from birth and death. These penetrate mystery and subtlety, comprehend the hidden and profound, therefore able to understand all the secret chapters, such as the five chapters of the mixed and red texts. Fully understood, then reciting ten times, the heavens descend, myriad emperors observe and all chant the jade sound, set rites of taboos, none fail to honour the scripture’s purpose, praise the功 of the scripture. Then rivers and seas cease waves, mountains and valleys gather clouds, the sun and moon stop wheels, stars and constellations cease shining, demons and ghosts hide, all is the effect of cultivation and recitation, bringing great response. Even able to return corpses to life, restore white bones to men; though souls sink and spirits disappear, all ride on the功 of the scripture to be reborn. The effect of ten times recitation, in the elixir way, is that after ten months the embryo completes and spirit transforms. The heavens are the true lead interior fusion, myriad spirits harmonious; rivers and seas and mountains and valleys are rivers of love and seas of suffering. If one can reveal one truth alone, myriad illusions all empty, then the waves of love cease, the waves of suffering are clear. The sun, moon, and celestial pole are the great still spirit light, illuminating the eight consciousnesses; then outer demons are subdued, inner demons extinguished. To this, the birth body receives salvation, the death soul receives refinement; is there not功 to return the skeleton and raise the dead?

The diligent scholar recites ten times, then the five emperors attend as guards, the three realms bow, demons lose their eyes, ghosts and妖 vanish, dying ones are saved and restored to life.

This speaks of the功 of the diligent scholar who cultivates and recites. Diligent scholars have hearts firm as iron and stone, enduring water and fire, Heaven and Earth cannot cross, ghosts and spirits cannot deceive; they accomplish what others cannot accomplish. Therefore, reciting the scripture ten times, the five Qi spirits attend and command the three realms; the demon king also bows in tribute. This is the diligent scholar’s功 accumulating, restraining demons so demons are fearful and subdued, dare not look directly, hence lose eyes. The demon king already protects and recommends, ghosts and妖 all are bound and extinguished. This功 saves those dying and restores them to life. Within are the five emperors, the spirits of the five organs; the three realms’ three corpses, six thieves; demon spirits and ghosts and妖, the seven emotions and six desires. If man can dispatch desires and purify heart, think little and desire little, then the heart is calm and spirit clear, essence complete and Qi firm, then the five organs are peaceful, the three corpses are diminished, the six roots are pure, myriad thoughts all empty. The inner demons cease, then outer demons are naturally removed. With功 of refining oneself, saving dying ones, the true Qi reaches even those who are cut off, can be born again; this is the effect of ten turns within the body, the base of the elixir gradually formed.

That is because the scholar’s defilements are not yet removed, the body not yet clear truth, summoning and commanding the ten directions, authority not yet restraining Heaven’s government, virtue able to subdue and govern Earth spirits, binding and restraining demon spirits, only enough to repel death, not able to be reborn again.

This speaks of the common scholar whose功 of cultivation and recitation is not yet full. The heavenly government are the sun, moon, and five stars, called the seven governments in Heaven. Earth spirits are mountains, rivers, hills, temples, and the gods of soil and grain. The common scholar cannot reduce desires and purify heart; therefore his defilements are not removed, nature and principle are still obscure, hence body and nature cannot yet be clear truth. Thus the reason is that he is not able. Whereas the diligent scholar’s功 of cultivation and recitation is full. If he summons and commands the spirits of the ten directions, his authority cannot restrain the motion of the heavenly government, his virtue can only subdue and govern the spirits of the Earth, restrain demon spirits; this is sufficient to repel death and prolong life, but not able to hope for the way of longevity. Because his spirit is confused and Qi turbid, material defiled and thoughts confused, even if he protects against erosion, exorcises the five latitudes, cuts down evil stars, rescues from drought and boiling heat, slays dragons and clams, causes rain and snow, recedes tides, all acts affecting heavenly government, none can restrain its response. The Earth spirits’ gods have not attained their heavenly rank, hence功 and virtue can only subdue them. If the scholar cultivates and recites diligently, with one thought not arising, myriad causes cease, directly arriving at the realm of the precious pearl, is this not clear truth?

Lightly reciting this chapter brings disaster to the body. Offering and respect brings flourishing households, generations prosperous; with good causes and conditions, myriad calamities do not touch.

This warns the common and lower students of功 and fault. Lightly reciting this chapter, for the scripture is formed of the Brahman Qi of the three heavens, cloud seals and dragon chapters, not common words; if carelessly lightly recited, the blame of disrespect surely brings disaster. Though the three caverns’ scriptures, one must surely collect the heart and comprehend the spirit, hold the recitation without negligence, much more this scripture. Hence Xue Youqi said: "If one does not regulate the body, does not follow the ritual, acts in standing, sitting, or walking without care, merely reciting, this is disrespect. If reciting without respect, better not to recite and yet be respectful." Lord Xin gave this admonition: At the beginning of reciting the scripture, one must collect myriad thoughts to return to one, that is the Primordial summoning the ten directions. Properly reciting the scripture is the Primordial speaking. The emotions and thoughts and spirit do not wander recklessly, that is the ten directions hearing the scripture. All illusions return to truth, that is Heaven and men receiving salvation. This teaching is most perfect. The lower students who can cultivate diligently, offer and respect, worship with reverence, externally their houses become prosperous, internally body and mind are peaceful, so that generations prosper without ceasing; fully accumulating good, encountering auspicious gatherings, calamities do not invade, evil retreats, the bells respond to the protection of the spirits.

This scripture is most honoured and wondrous, uniquely walking atop the Jade Capital. The salvation of men is limitless, the root of myriad ways, the grand and lofty pattern, virtue hard to surpass; the sound rises.

Lord Xin says: Great indeed is the Scripture of the Spirit Treasure Salvation of Men, not composed by literary art; all scriptures perished in kalpas must perish, only this text remains in the Jade Capital. Again he says: From ancient times to now, the highest saints, immortals, and Buddhas who attain the Way have none who do not uphold the Scripture of Salvation. Among all scriptures, the Primordial Salvation is the supreme scripture. From the beginning of the Primordial kalpa when the myriad heavens were born, its mixed red script, the empty and mysterious chapters, thus opening the three illuminations, revolving the ten directions, five writings opening and expanding, myriad patterns unfolding, giving birth to Heaven and Earth, nurturing myriad things, all arise from this root of Heaven and Earth. The power to summon hundreds of millions of heavenly truth, countless hosts of the unmeasured, all entering within one millet grain, this is the root of myriad ways, called limitless, universal salvation without end; hence supreme and wondrous, unique among the supreme texts of the Jade Capital. Its vast功 and virtue cannot be fully told. This scripture, the thousand true and ten thousand saints cultivate from it; myriad laws and thousand gates issue from it; thus enduring all times without ruin, existing before Heaven and Earth to last. Extend it and it fills the six voids; collect it and it does not fill a handful. The Buddhists call it the entire realm of sand and the hundred thousand wondrous meanings all gathered in a hair’s tip. This is nothing else but the original true nature from before countless kalpas. Is it not supreme and wondrous? Therefore it is limitless and boundless, its great pattern and supreme virtue not to be measured or fully described. If one can cultivate it, is it not to uniquely walk the Jade Capital! Lord Xin says: The scripture is transmitted by the heart, comprehended by the heart; the learner should thus have eyes to examine fully.

The Way says: Whoever recites this scripture ten times, all the heavens arrive together; the myriad ancestors of countless generations and the dark souls of the underworld, all suffering and vexed, all immediately receive salvation, ascend to the Vermilion Palace. The grades are nine years, receiving transformation and rebirth, becoming noble persons. And diligent scholars of the scripture, when功 is full and virtue complete, all become gods and immortals, fly up to the Golden Pavilion, and roam the Jade Capital.

This means not limited to high or low person; reciting and holding ten times can assist the功 effect of their ancestral mystery and dark souls receiving salvation. The myriad ancestors of countless generations means those who since the Primordial have incarnated countless times as parents and ancestors, countless kalpas of lineage. The dark souls suffering and vexed are all souls of the dark long night not yet saved. The Vermilion Palace is the Southern Prosperity Upper Palace. Grades are three: upper learning three years to receive salvation; middle wisdom nine years; lower learning twenty-four years. All功 of reciting are not limited by one’s rank or capacity, whether wise or foolish, but can collect thoughts and hold heart, recite ten times; where功 reaches, all heavens respond and descend, myriad spirits all arrive. One’s countless ancestors and outside dark suffering souls all receive salvation, ascend the Vermilion Palace, immediately riding功 to transform and be born. They all receive salvation in the middle grade and are reborn, becoming noble persons. Those born noble do not fall. Having obtained rebirth, their innate wisdom and spirit are clear; by further cultivation and功 accumulation then only can they prove the immortal Way and ascend the three divine realms. Therefore diligent scholars of the scripture, cultivating and reciting diligently, accumulating功 day by day and month by month,功 full and virtue complete, then jade talismans protect the spirit, golden liquid refines the form; long after form and spirit both become wondrous, then they serve the Golden Pavilion and Jade Capital.

The upper scholar who cultivates and recites this scripture all immediately receive salvation and fly up to the Southern Palace.

The Supreme says: The superior scholar hears the Way, diligently practising it. The upper scholar has long planted good roots; their cultivation and recitation never slacken from beginning to end; hence their diligence never ceases; their功 and virtue are deep and heavy; then birth body receives salvation, life preserved and rooted; regardless of rank, all go straight to the Southern Palace. Youlou says: When soul and spirit ascend to immortality, then fire refines the ghostly quality; birth body receives salvation, then fire refines defilement; thus diligent practitioners are recorded in the immortal register, all fly to the Southern Palace, then attain true.

The common people who receive recitation have extended life and years; later all obtain the Way of Corpse Liberation; the soul and spirit temporarily extinguish, not passing through hell, immediately returning to form, roaming the vast void.

This speaks of the功 of the common circulating people who receive recitation. The common circulating are those who have long accumulated recitation, silently comprehending the scripture’s meaning, thus able to remain in light and extend years. After the body departs, they also obtain the Way of Corpse Liberation. Although their soul and spirit temporarily extinguish, yet with good cause attained, also do not go through the sufferings of hell, but return to form and the vast void, spirits and souls also receive the salvation of the Vermilion Palace. This is because of innate blessings and good roots attained birth. The human Way, though able to diligently receive and recite, has not yet understood the purpose of cultivation and refining; only able to obtain some account of birth and death. When heavenly numbers are exhausted, they ultimately return to birth and death; the form obtains corpse liberation; then spirit has no rotation, not subject to the nether world’s confines. Shedding the form and casting off traces, also able to return to true nature within the Yin Qi, spirit transcends void wilderness, then roaming the vast void realm.

This scripture is subtle and wondrous, universally saving without end; all heavenly men without exception receive blessing. Limitless blessings, birth and death both receive grace.

The foregoing words are most honoured, a profound praise of subtlety. The Dao Sovereign shows compassion to the utmost, hence the功 of universal salvation without end. Therefore when cultivation is diligent, where scripture功 reaches, heavenly men without exception receive blessing; even ancestral mysteries and dark spirits all receive salvation. Its limitless blessings cannot be measured; regarded as birth. Having received salvation, the dead souls also all receive refinement; this is that birth and death both receive the Heavenly Venerable’s grace. Yet the scripture’s subtlety is possessed by all; if not cultivated in the body, not proving the ten turns refining oneself功, how can it universally save without end? If one can comprehend the scripture’s Dharma in heart, able to reach the subtleties of golden liquid, long after the ten turns returning the spirit, to summon the ten directions, then the former dead and distant spirits all obtain liberation from the body, also ascend to spirit transformation; is this not birth and death receiving grace?

What Heaven treasures and does not transmit to future generations. The superior scholar carries the golden treasure, effects the heart, makes covenant with Heaven and transmits. If lightly divulged or recklessly slighted, calamity comes to the nine ancestors, long servitude to ghost officials.

Observing the stern prohibitions and admonitions of the Dao Sovereign, one knows this scripture is treasured and secret in Heaven. Xiao Guanfu says: The three caverns’ true scriptures are listed in the Golden Register, secret in the Mysterious Capital, opened once in ten thousand kalpas. In former kalpas when fortune was poor and the world’s path blocked, the Western platform Turtle Mother petitioned at the Jade Capital, hence the Jade Morning Dao Sovereign entrusted it to the Mysterious One True Man; the Mysterious One True Man entrusted it to the Supreme Ultimate Xu True Man; the Supreme Ultimate True Man entrusted it to Ge Immortal, transmitted in the world. Therefore what Heaven treasures as secret, how can the common scholar know? The superior scholar, the diligent scholar, must carry the golden treasure, effect the heart, make covenant with the Heavenly True Supreme and then receive it. What Heaven treasures are all inner names and taboos, red scripts and cavernous chapters. The superior scholar carries the golden treasure to break stinginess of heart, increase preciousness of mind, so that the scripture is regarded as a precious treasure of gold. If by chance lightly divulged or slighted, is this not calamity coming to the ancestral mysteries and receiving examination by ghost officials? The immortal master said: Light means granting to unworthy persons; divulge means acting without secrecy; leak means guarding without firmness; slight means serving without reverence. If any one of the four, the body then receives calamity. Ghost officials are heavenly servants driving thunder and lightning; earthly servants bearing sand and stones; water servants stirring and drawing the waves; these are the officials of the dead souls receiving punishment from the ghost officials.

Attending the scripture are five emperors, jade boys and jade maidens, each twenty-four persons; they arrange and guard divine writings, protecting those who receive the scripture’s body.

This speaks of the protection of the gods and immortals over those who cultivate and recite. Shaowei says: The five emperors are the Five Elders’ Heavenly Emperors. The five emperors attend the scripture, flying and watching the world, commanding jade boys and jade maidens to gather one hundred and twenty persons to arrange and guard the scripture’s text, protecting the body of those who wear and recite it. Those who cultivate truth are mostly obstructed by outer demons, easily falling back; thus many slacken on the middle path.

The Dao Sovereign, having spoken of the consequences of divulging and slighting, again entrusts spiritual beings to guard; commanding them to arrange and protect the scripture’s persons, so as to dispel demons and ward off calamities. The Heavenly Venerable’s mercy can be said to be thorough. Those who study and cultivate may not neglect this teaching, but believe, receive, and uphold it, to avoid the fault of divulging and slighting.

The Way says: In the first month, undertake fasting and recite this scripture, to sever bondage of the deceased of former generations and relieve the earth’s arrest, thus saving the Above Southern Palace. In the seventh month, undertake fasting and recite this scripture, the body obtains immortality; the heavenly registers, yellow scripts and white slips, remove death and raise life. In the tenth month, undertake fasting and recite this scripture, to protect the kings and emperors, ministers and fathers and sons, to secure and stabilize the kingdom’s mandate, to protect Heaven’s lasting existence. Generations unbroken, long as human rulers; securing the borders, the people praise great peace.

This speaks of the功 of scholars on the three origins, eight festivals, and birth days. The first month, Shangyuan, the great celebration month, the head of the four beginnings, the start of Yin, thus fasting and reciting to save the deceased of former generations, sever earth officials’ bonds, and reduce the bondage of ghost officials, thereby salvation to the Southern Palace. The seventh month, Zhongyuan, the great celebration month, start of Shen, the human way; fasting and reciting to save oneself, the heavenly registers record names, raising the fallen and the dead, their names listed on yellow and white registers. Shaowei says: This is the register of immortals. The tenth month, Xiayuan, great celebration month, start of Hai, the Heavenly Gate; fasting and reciting to protect kings, emperors, rulers, ministers, and fathers and sons, to bless the country and secure the mandate, to endure long, generation after generation as rulers, the four quarters peaceful, no harm or disease, people all praise the great peace. The three origins govern the three palaces, nine offices, one hundred and twenty bureaus, examining causes and effects of sins and blessings, all under their jurisdiction. Therefore the highest is for the nation’s mandate, next for the ancestral line, next for oneself; all should on these months undertake fasting and scripture recitation, pray for blessings and liberation; surely Heaven and men receive blessing, birth and death receive grace, and blessings are limitless.

On the days of the Eight Festivals, reciting this scripture makes one a True Man of the Nine Palaces. On one’s birth day, reciting this scripture makes one’s soul and spirit clear and correct, myriad Qi long-lasting, not passing through suffering, the body having brightness. The three realms attend as guards; the five emperors escort; myriad spirits pay homage; names are recorded in Heaven;功 is full and virtue complete; fly up to Shangqing.

The Eight Festivals are the four beginnings of the four seasons; the two solstices and two equinoxes are the conjunctions of yin and yang; hence the three realms’ examination of sins and blessings is tied to the immortal scripture. It says: The Primordial Heavenly Venerable on these days dispatches the heavenly emperors, lords, gods, true immortals, and military spirits to teach and transform the human world, to open salvation for myriad beings. The Northern Dipper, Southern Bureau, Four Masters and Five Emperors also descend, listing sins and blessings. The flowing of Qi changes on these days; flying, crawling, swimming and sinking, responding to conditions and resonance, changing old for new, light becoming heavy or heavy becoming light, good and evil reversing. The movement of signs is natural and spontaneous. The upper scholar should on these days preserve sincerity and pray and thank, following change and transformation, entering right and leaving wrong, refining false into true, opening salvation for myriad beings, generating myriad assemblages; therefore one should recite and hold with respect, striving to practise auspiciousness and remove calamity, advance good and repel evil, seek brightness and abandon darkness, exert the will and think truth, accumulate true功 within and cultivate practice without, then surely there shall be no reward of sin or blessing. The Eight Festivals correspond to the Eight Trigrams and Nine Palaces mutually; hence reciting on the Eight Festivals makes one a True Man of the Nine Palaces. One’s birth day is when six times annually the sun descends. The three souls are stored in the liver, belonging to wood, their number is three, hence called three souls. The seven spirits are stored in the lung, belonging to metal, their number seven, hence called seven spirits. The three souls in the body: one soul dwells in the main dwelling palace, one soul dwells in the underworld, one soul dwells within the form. The seven spirits constantly depart but do not disperse. On meeting one’s birth day, soul and spirit descend to the body and join the corpse, circulate and return without ceasing, then life is stable and secure, disaster and illness do not arise. If on that day body and mind are pure and clean, abstain from wine and sex, wear fresh clean clothes, burn incense and practise goodness; moreover that day if sleep is short, then soul and spirit unite, yin and yang are balanced, Dao Qi within flourish, life root is firm. If addicted to wine and sex, confused in body, then when soul returns, it departs from the body three steps distant, cannot unite, defiled Qi fills the body, soul again goes out thrice and is confused. If not united with the spirits, then yang weak and yin strong, soul communicates with yin ghosts, causing sleepwalking and all evils, indulging in sleep and confusion, disasters and illness all arise. If one can on one’s birth day cultivate fasting and recite the scripture, then like the above response,功 full and virtue complete, the three realms attend as guards, the five emperors escort, then elevation and promotion.

Qingyuan says: If one does all evil, the soul is angry and spirit departs the body, knowing it has entered the evil paths; if one does all good, the soul rejoices and myriad spirits gather, knowing it has entered the right path. The scholar should not be careless.

The Way says: On the day of practising the Way, one should bathe with fragrant water, fast and enter the chamber, face East and knock the teeth thirty-two times, hearing the thirty-two heavens above, heart bows the thirty-two courses. Close eyes and meditate; body sits among clouds of blue, yellow, and white Qi; inside and outside dense and obscure; with Blue Dragon, White Tiger, Vermilion Bird, and Black Tortoise, Lion and White Crane arrayed on left and right; sun and moon shine brightly, illuminating the chamber, shining clearly; above the head the round image is born, light reflects in all directions, so clear.

On the day of scripture recitation, first put on clothes and wash face, purify heart and wash away thoughts, enter the chamber facing East and sit upright, hold recitation with attention and eyes following, recite in a low voice, striving to make spirit and soul harmonious, Qi steady and breath regulated; then knock teeth to gather spirit within and penetrate Heaven’s heart without. Bow to the thirty-two heavens, close eyes and meditate silently; body sits within the mysterious primordial three Qi. Inside and outside shining clearly; preserving the blue Qi in the liver issuing from the eyes, transforming into Blue Dragon on the left; preserving the white Qi in the lungs issuing from the nose, transforming into White Tiger on the right; preserving the red Qi in the heart issuing from the mouth, transforming into Vermilion Bird in front; preserving the black Qi in the kidneys issuing from the ears, transforming into Black Tortoise behind; all arrayed on left and right. Left eye joins the sun, right eye joins the moon; sunlight and moonlight illuminate the chamber. Behind the neck is the diagram, nine colours hanging rays, light spreading above the ten directions.

Secret mantra:

Secret means low voice; mantra means prayer. Mo’an says: From the following text of the Supreme Mysterious Primordial arises, to the section before the Supreme Throne, is low-voiced prayers and blessings, need not be separately recited as a mantra. Its "Ganlu Yulu" was added later by men, not suitable for recitation. Also do not be too fast; if greedy and excessive in number, Qi becomes turbid and voice loud, returns to disrespect.

The Supreme Mysterious Primordial Supreme Dao Sovereign summons from his body the thirty-two officers of three and five功, the left and right officials and messengers, the incense-bearing jade boys, the transmitting jade maidens, the five emperors’ direct talismans, the direct day incense official, each thirty-two persons to come forth, open the gates and speak: Today is auspicious, long fasting in the pure hall, cultivation to the scripture, limitless salvation of men. The officers of three and five功 and the receiving of life, wish the above statement to be thoroughly conveyed, directly proceeding to the Supreme Thirty-two Heavens’ Primordial Heavenly Emperor’s Supreme Throne.

Complete, then summon Qi thirty-two courses, recite the scripture facing East.

The Supreme Mysterious Primordial is the general name of the three realms. Recitation should first invoke the Primordial, preserving in oneself the chief Mud Pellet Palace. The three and five功 officers and spirits in the body arise, arrayed left and right, front and back each one person, each go to one heaven, each with thirty-two persons, all come forth and open gates, speak what was said, each position silently performs, the matter and intent following the prayers, most sincere in stating affairs. Today is auspicious and long fasting. Today, if not fasting, just say holding fasting. Pure hall cultivation to scripture, if not understanding the three caverns’ covenant of the Way, not previously cultivating, then only say pure hall scripture recitation. Limitless salvation is for the ten directions’ manifest and hidden, or for one matter, then only say reciting scripture for some matter. The officers of three and five功 for oneself do not speak, nor for others. Directly proceeding to the supreme thirty-two heavens and Primordial Heavenly Emperor Supreme Throne, that is the thirty-two heavenly emperors and the Primordial Heavenly Emperor’s Supreme Throne. Summoning Qi thirty-two courses is daily summoning one Qi. Facing East is because it is the beginning of generating Qi. Inside and outside the three Qi shine clearly, holding recitation accordingly.

Orthodox Succession Teaching of the Way, Harmonizing Non-action, Unfolding the Ancestral Radiance; the True Man Guangfan, Director of Daoist Affairs, Forty-third Celestial Master Zhang Yuchu’s Annotation

The Primordial Supreme Scripture of Limitless Salvation of Men

This is the title of the orthodox scripture. The orthodox scripture is that spoken by the Primordial, thus only titled "The Primordial Supreme Scripture of Limitless Salvation of Men." This is the Dao Sovereign’s heading of the scripture. Called Primordial to clarify that this scripture was spoken by the Primordial Heavenly Venerable. Limitless Salvation of Men sums up the scripture’s main intent. This scripture is first in rank, hence called supreme wondrous scripture.

The Primordial Mysterious, Spirit Treasure Fundamental Chapter,

Primordial is the origin of one Qi, the beginning of myriad transformations, this is the response title of the Sovereign of the Void. This chapter is headed with the two words Primordial, to clarify all are words of the Primordial Heavenly Venerable. Mysterious is one of the three caverns, a scripture rank name. Spirit Treasure is the title of the Dao Sovereign. The Dao Sovereign is named "Scripture Treasure," because all scriptures are expounded by the Dao Sovereign. Dao treasure, scripture treasure, master treasure, existing before Heaven and Earth, all born from the mysterious primordial three Qi; therefore this scripture is also formed by Brahman clear brightness and spirit three Qi as cloud seals and heavenly chapters; then the Heavenly True Sovereign writes with the brush to form the scripture text. Primordial dwells in the empty, hollow, mysterious; speaking this scripture is the root of the Spirit Treasure scriptures and first among all scriptures, hence called Fundamental Chapter. Cultivated within, it is the alternate name of the great golden elixir. Concentrating spirit is spirit; gathering Qi is treasure; this thoroughly penetrates our primordial spirit, lasting from ancient times to now without ruin; this is the root of the precelestial true unity.

Supreme wondrous first, ten times salvation of men, hundred demons’ hidden rhymes, separation and union natural.

Mo’an says: This is the short preface of the orthodox scripture. Supreme wondrous first means highest scripture, chief of all wonders. Ten times salvation of men: ten is the number of generation of the Five Elements, all things contain this principle; to save men and save ghosts one must revolve ten times, ending and beginning anew, then ten turns returning the spirit. Hundred demons’ hidden rhymes. Shaowei says: demons are not the evil demons or evil ghosts of popular parlance, but great demons such as the Five Emperors’ great demons, the Southern Pole Longevity World-saving Sima and other gods. Hence in the Spirit Treasure mantras, the True King, Zhuling, Qinghua all rank with the five great heavenly demons. Hidden rhymes are hidden names and taboos. Separation and union natural, by the sounds of hidden rhymes, one separates and one unites, naturally and spontaneously without fixed trace. For the precelestial one Qi transforms myriad assemblages; one root and myriad differences; union; myriad differences and one root, separation; revolutions endless, cycles without end; unable to spy the traces of creation. The elixir way takes ten months for the embryo to complete and spirit to transform, in accord with Heaven and Earth; creation is of the same path, transformation is of the same mechanism, all regard ten as the full number. The difficulty in cultivation is that within the body are the six roots and eight consciousnesses, three souls and seven spirits, spirits of three departments and eight aspects, stirring as demon tests, confounding the lord of the heart, their separation and union confused and entangled, cannot cease at all. Knowing the功 of cultivation of ten times, then a hundred demons are restrained and return to nature.

Mixed Hollow Red Text, limitless primordial true, the primordial ancestral kalpa, transformations born myriad heavens, opening the three illuminations, this is the root of Heaven. Above there is no further ancestor, only the Way is the body.

Shaowei says: What precedes is the Dao Sovereign’s short preface; what follows is the Heavenly Venerable’s fundamental chapter. Mixed means mixed and undivided; hollow means empty and without substance. This is the primordial chaos undivided, the one Qi embryo mingled in the hollow. Red text: the Scripture of True Writ says: the Yang Qi is red, hence called the Red Scripture. All are precelestial Qi, utmost yang essence, portent forming image. The Five Elders’ Heavenly Emperors say: The Primordial Mysterious Spirit Treasure Red Scripture was born before the Primordial, in the empty hollow, dim and obscure, without ancestor or clan, binding Qi floating in the void, responding when the time comes. Limitless primordial true: one Qi beginning at the start of Great Non-being. The scripture says: Even nothingness is nothingness, thus. The utmost above, the truest of the true, so-called born before Heaven and Earth. Ancestral means ancestral Qi. Kalpa means the first formation and destruction of Heaven and Earth is one kalpa; the ancestral kalpa is the beginning of the birth of the world before destruction. Mysterious primordial Qi is the ancestor Qi of myriad things, creating five hundred million heavens, all born of the ancestor Qi. The scripture says: The Way is the mother of myriad things. Xiao Guanfu says: From one Qi come three realms; from three realms come nine heavens, below three realms each with three heavens, altogether thirty-six heavens; then below are four kinds of folk heavens; then divided into three realms and twenty-eight heavens; then eight Brahma heavens; and to the transformation of five hundred million heavens, all spring from the ancestor Qi as root. Opening the three illuminations: the three realms are Qingwei, Yu Yu, and Great Red Three Heavens. The three illuminations are also called the three lights of sun, moon, and stars. Heaven, Earth, Man are three poles, three talents, three realms. The Supreme says: The Way produces one, that is one Qi; one produces two, the two instruments; three produces myriad things, the three illuminations. The three Qi combined produce nine Qi; the three Qi are the clan of Heaven and Earth, the root of myriad things, all born of ancestral kalpa then open Heaven and Earth and produce the root of Heaven. Above there is no further ancestor, only the Way is the body; the Way’s principle is emptiness and non-being, not to be sought by form; this is called a strong name, therefore no form, no name, no sound, no smell, encompassing Heaven and Earth, embracing the universe. It has no other ancestor. Confucians call it the Supreme Ultimate; Buddhists call it True Void; Daoists call it Supreme Vacuity; the principle is one. The difficulty in cultivation is to gather ancestral Qi at the precelestial beginning, bind it as golden mother, circulate the six voids; all Qi mingled and separated, opening and closing without ceasing. Long after, chasing the two Qi on the Yellow Path, meeting the three natures in the origin palace, then the subtleties of two and five essence combine and condense, endlessly generating and forming the Dharma body, that is the primordial root of the Heavenly Venerable.

Five Writings Open and Expand, universally plant spirits. No writing without light, no writing without brightness, no writing without establishment, no writing without completion, no writing without salvation, no writing without birth. This is the heaven within the Great Brahma Heaven.

The Five Writings are the five true writings. That is the five chapters of spreading and unfolding. They give birth to Heaven and establish Earth, flying, swimming, moving, growing, stirring and containing spirit; all things of form and Qi arise and transform through them; therefore from Yin and Yang’s separation onwards, their writings open and expand, universally planting all classes. The five writings in heaven are the five stars, on earth the five mountains, in man the five elements, in things the five Qi. The greatest and finest things are all contained within. Without a writing, there is no light or brightness, no establishment or completion, no salvation or birth; then Heaven and Earth and myriad things have no mechanism to operate creation. The human body is a small heaven and earth, its spirit among myriad things. The precelestial one Qi is the base of the elixir, the five elements arranged in the cauldron; metal and wood intermingled, water and fire combined, two earths as jade tablets; within them the inversion of yin and yang completed. Emotion returns to nature then mercury is thrown into lead, medicine obtains fire then sand is produced in silver; none other than the golden mother as root, flowing Wu to Yi, seeing earth and forming elixir. When elixir completes, its spirit wonderfully transforms, unfathomable, all five elements entire. Its brightness is like the sun and moon’s light, its establishment like the establishment of Heaven and Earth, able to save and generate, that is the Primordial. This is the heaven within the Great Brahma Heaven. The preceding text sums up the scripture’s meaning; therefore it is said so. Great Brahma is the great moving Brahma Qi. The heaven within heaven, among the thirty-two heavens, all is Brahma Qi circulating endlessly; like one Qi circulating in the body, all heavenly mandates flowing through the hundred veins and nine apertures, nowhere not returning; this is the circulation of Brahma Qi.

Yulu Xiao Tai, Jade Mountain Upper Capital, Supreme Beyond All, Great Luo Jade Clear, boundless kalpas, as if vanished and as if present.

Above the Great Luo Heaven is the Jade Capital Mountain, using jade as capital, hence called Jade Mountain Upper Capital. The Yulu Terrace is above the Jade Capital, reaching utmost height and remoteness, the supreme above the supreme. This is the Great Luo Heaven. Jade Clear Golden Pavilion dwells within it, vast and boundless, encompassing myriad worlds, hence vast beyond measure, not to be exhausted. The Brahma Qi condenses the void, not to be sought by form or image, called as if vanished and as if present. The Great Luo is the realm of boundless kalpas, enduring kalpas without ruin. A kalpa cannot be measured. Its vast and obscure indistinctness accords with the Supreme Vacuity; no form no name; not to be sought by trace. Yulu Xiao Tai in the body corresponds to the brain border. Jade Mountain Upper Capital is the Mud Pellet. The Mud Pellet is the Heavenly Gate, the residence of myriad spirits; this is the Great Luo’s scene. Jade Clear dwells therein, vast and boundless, as if vanished and as if present. One’s true nature is vast and obscure without trace, vague indistinct presence, enduring countless kalpas, called the imperishable primordial spirit, therefore dwelling above the three realms.

The Three Blossoms of Li Convenient, Great Wondrous Court, Golden Pavilion Jade Mansion, Arrayed and Pure, Great Moving Brahma Qi, Revolving Ten Directions.

Youqi says: The three blossoms are the Jade Clear three origin palaces. Upper origin Jade Blossom, middle origin Golden Blossom, lower origin Nine Blossoms. The Three Origin Supreme Dao Sovereigns dwell therein; this is the Li Palace of Jade Clear. Great Possession is the High Supreme Great Possession Jade Clear Palace where the Heavenly Venerable resides, hence called Wonderful Court. The three are the fire number of the South, belonging to Li, that is the Mud Pellet brain border. The Golden Pavilion Jade Mansion is the Yellow Court Red Palace. Arrayed are the stars of the whole heaven. Pure Pool is the clarity of the two pools, that is the Kan and Li within the body. Great Moving Brahma Qi revolves the ten directions; this is the scene of the Great Luo Jade Clear, Brahma Qi circulating and spreading to the limitless realm of the ten directions, all myriad assemblages benefiting, the primordial one Qi transforming endlessly. The elixir scriptures say: The three palaces mix, meeting the three natures in the origin palace. The spirit, Qi essence of the body, are the three blossoms. The primordial spirit dwells in the spirit platform, that is the Great Possession Wonderful Court. Our Golden Pavilion Jade Chamber is the Golden Pavilion Jade Mansion of Heaven. The five stars and arranged mansions shine in the pure pool’s water, that is the fire season of the whole heaven, arranged stars surrounding the rise and fall of Kan and Li, water and fire. When Qian and Kun cauldrons are completed, then the way of nine returns and golden liquid is completed. The precelestial true unity Qi circulates day and night, revolving and repeating, all receive the essence of Kan Wu month and Yi day light, the symbols of fire advancing and retreating, mutually meeting and warming, completing the metal embryo, circulating through the sixty-four hexagrams, all veins returning to origin, nine apertures shining clearly; is this not Brahma Qi circulating everywhere, all ten directions reaching, all are the scene of pure pool?

Mo’an says: This means all the heavens gather to examine the scholar’s功 and faults, the world’s people’s sins and blessings. The immortals say: Brahma Qi circulates in the ten directions; within the ten directions are gods who govern the affairs of salvation and immortality; not that the gods themselves do not die. The Southern Pole Longevity Lord is the Southern Pole Longevity Great Lord, governing the registry of birth. Also called Zhuling Great Emperor, the World-Saving Sima Great God of the Southern Palace, governing world salvation.

The cultivator refines golden liquid and shape; then form and spirit are both wondrous; circulating the ten directions, all can save the world and save calamity, return corpses and raise the dead.

The Flying Heavenly Great Saints of the Ten Directions all are Primordial Dao Domain’s divided forms and transforming Qi. Binghu Xue Xiuzhao says: The Ten Directions’ Longevity Great Saints are the Ten Directions’ World-saving Heavenly Venerables, who from the opening of the chart and recording, by the Primordial’s command, govern the功 and virtue of the ten directions and three realms, open limitless salvation, summing birth and death, training and casting scholars. The Daozang says: The heavens of the eight directions all have limitless great thousand worlds. The Eastern Limitless Heavens are the An Datang Village Great Thousand Virtuous World; the Southern Limitless Heavens are the Wan Li City Great Thousand Abandoned Worthy World; the Western Limitless Heavens are the Fu Tang Zhou Great Thousand All-action World; the Northern Limitless Heavens are the Yu Dan Wild Great Thousand Pure World; the Northeast Limitless Heavens are the Fu Ji Du Great Thousand Eternal Peace World; the Southeast Limitless Heavens are the Yuan Fu Tian Great Thousand Worthy-using World; the Southwest Limitless Heavens are the Yan Fu Village Great Thousand Seven Silent World; the Northwest Limitless Heavens are the Fu De Wild Great Thousand Extended Worthy World; the Above Jiuxiao Shangqing Yu Zhen Thirty-six Heavens are the Mysterious Capital Limitless World; the Below Huang Zeng Thirty-two Heavens of Eight Circles Limitless World. Also the Five Mountains, Five Emperors, Cave Yin Clear Spirit, Northern Capital Luo Feng and the many officials and offices; these Ten Directions’ Limitless Flying Heavenly Kings all have the office of longevity and world salvation; hence called Longevity Great Saints, from kalpa to kalpa, saving men to attain the Way and become true, limitless without measure, called limitless salvation of men.

The ten directions’ highest true flying heavenly kings, longevity saving world limitless great gods, all ride flying clouds; cinnabar chariots green ranks, feathered canopies jade wheels, harnessing red phoenix, five-coloured mysterious dragons, raising nine-coloured festivals, ten supreme spirit banners. In front whistle nine phoenixes singing together, behind blow eight luan birds sounding together, lion and white crane, whistling and singing in harmony.

This sums up the foregoing ten directions’ flying heavenly kings and limitless great gods; all are the highest truth of heaven. Qing Yuan says: Chariots, ranks, wheels, canopies are all formed from yang essence Qi. Phoenix, dragon, lion, crane are all formed from yin essence Qi. The highest saints have the Way of true constancy, breathing and merging, appearing as they will. Yin and yang Qi harmonized, forming song and melody, all by Qi, not external objects. When the功 of the return elixir succeeds, yin demons also transform, yang gods and primordial Qi at one call, myriad gods all listen; the spirits of the five organs each appear according to their colour and place. Chariots and ritual guards, coming to escort the hundred bones, multitude of gods leading in front and following behind, ascending to pay homage to the origin, no different from the assembly of heavenly true great saints.

The Five Elders lead the way, multitude of immortals escort the carriage, hundred million chariots and myriad riders, floating through the air they come. Radiance inclines and the carriage returns, monitoring true salvation.

The ten directions’ great saints, with lofty positions, thus invoke the five emperors’ leading, multitude of immortals harnessing and riding; hence a hundred million chariots and myriad riders float through the air to the scene. The Five Elders are: Eastern Green Spirit First Elder, family name Guan, personal name Kai, style Lingwei Yang; Southern Red Spirit True Elder, family name Dongfu, personal name Jiyan, style Chi Bo Nu; Central Primordial Spirit Elder, family name Tongban, personal name Yuanshi, style Han Shuniu; Western Bright Spirit Emperor Elder, family name Shangjin, personal name Changkai, style Yao Po Bao; Northern Five Spirits Mysterious Elder, family name Heijie, personal name Linghui, style Yin Hou Ju. The Five Emperors are all spirits of natural heavenly truth, wondrously transformed from ancestral Qi to Five Elements, that is the Five Qi. Hence called Primordial Five Elders, not those who attain truth by accumulated learning, but self-receive command and descent talismans, each guarding one direction; at major kalpa transitions, their rank changes. Thus East belongs to Wood, master of Spring, commanding growth of myriad things; South belongs to Fire, master of Summer, commanding growth of myriad things; Centre belongs to Earth, flourishing in four seasons, harmonizing myriad things; West belongs to Metal, master of Autumn, commanding fruition of myriad things; North belongs to Water, master of Winter, commanding storage of myriad things. This is the orderly distribution of Five Qi. The Five Elements are the true Qi of the Dharma body; Fire Dragon and Water Tiger circulate inverted within the cauldron. The myriad gods cluster within the nine palaces; then the Five Qi face the origin; the myriad spirits guard the body; this is like a thousand chariots and myriad riders floating through the air to come. Inclining light is flowing essence jade light. Returning carriage is flying clouds cinnabar sky. The ten directions’ great saints gather before the emperor; wheels turn and revolve; the Heavenly Venerable’s Dharma throne supervises and leads the true ones to examine and save myriad beings. Within then returning one’s true light, illuminating the spirit mansion; then Kan and Li are completed, lead and mercury come together; spirit does not stray outside, the six reins all rest. Then the yang light inclines downward, yin dregs rise above, true spirit transforms and produces; naturally able to monitor true salvation of life, revolving the ten directions.

The heavenly ministers, Southern Prosperity Upper Palace, Han Administrator and Life Supervisor Great God, hold talismans and records, all assemble before the emperor; strictly examining who should be saved, the heavens in attendance.

Mo’an says: This means the heavens all assemble to examine the scholar’s功 and faults, the world’s people’s sins and blessings. Heavenly ministers are the Great Luo Limitless Divine Lords. Southern Prosperity Upper Palace is the Zhuling Fire Mansion in the Red Bright and Harmonious Yang Heaven. Han Administrator is Han Elder, overseeing the scriptures for refining and salvation. Life Supervisor Great God governs the salvation of souls receiving life. The registrars record the功 and faults of scholars and the people. Each department’s gods carry talismans and records, all meet before the Heavenly Venerable, check功 and measure blessings, universally save men and heavens. Examining those who should be saved, some are of ancient fate and mysterious charts, their bones conforming to immortality; some observe fasting and keep precepts,功 and virtue accumulate and induce response; some reverently uphold the Three Treasures, good功 thoroughly reaches Heaven; some offer service to the master treasure, praised by the Three Officials. The heavens’ recorders strictly check and according to功 and measure grade, according to high and low, should receive elevation and salvation. Guanfu says: This is the main text above, the Dao Sovereign’s preface of the Jade Morning.

Universally creating the three realms, the Limitless Divine Village, the Spring Song Mansion, Northern Capital Luo Feng, Three Officials Nine Offices, Twelve River Sources.

The three realms are Desire Realm, Form Realm, and Formless Realm. The Limitless Divine Village is the world of the ten directions’ limitless. The Spring Song Mansion is the Nine Nether Long Night Mansion. Northern Capital Luo Feng is a great sea in the lower origin north, foul and malodorous, with unmeasurable boundaries. Within is a mountain, reaching to the Blue Vault above, descending to the Wind Spring below, all black and dense Qi coiled and formed, called Northern Capital Luo Feng Mountain. There is a great cavern called Yin Scenery Heavenly Palace. Within are thirty-six prisons, ruled by the Lord of the Moon. Within are six caverns, six great heavenly demon kings, each governing one department. The first is called Zhou Cutting Yin Heavenly Palace; the second is Tai Killing Liang Shi Zong Heavenly Palace; the third is Ming Chen Nai Fan Wu City Heavenly Palace; the fourth is Tian Zhao Sin Qi Heavenly Palace; the fifth is Zong Ling Qi Fei Heavenly Palace; the sixth is Gan Si Lian Wan Lu Heavenly Palace. People who can hold the names of these six caverns, always living in reverence, then the demon kings recommend, diminish guilt names, life and death rely on them, obtaining limitless blessings. The Three Officials Nine Offices are the heavens, earth, and water officials governing the three origins’ examination offices. The Upper Origin Heavenly Official belongs to the Jade Clear Realm, setting three palaces, nine offices, thirty-six bureaus; the Middle Origin Earth Official belongs to the Shangqing Realm, setting three palaces, nine offices, forty-two bureaus; the Lower Origin Water Official belongs to the Supreme Clear Realm, setting three palaces, nine offices, forty-two bureaus. Among them, officials of the middle and lower origins are souls with功 after death, receiving salvation and appointed posts, according to years,功 complete then advancing to heavenly mansions;功 incomplete then reincarnate in human world. The Nine Offices are also called the nine fortresses of the Earth Emperor and Nine Commanders. The Twelve River Sources: the moon is the essence of the Great Yin, mother of all waters; the Eastern Well is the source of the Heavenly River, where all waters meet. The Great Yin has a monthly cycle, thus all twelve months pass the Eastern Well, nourishing the sweet dew of yellow flowers, rinsing and refining the dead souls, also relying on this to cleanse form, then salvation to the Southern Palace. The human body’s heart is Southern Prosperity, that is Zhuling Mansion. The scripture says: Spirit Treasure is limitless light, illuminating the fiery pond torment. When the heart is void, then the spirit light illuminates. Below the kidney are all the dark Yin Spring Song Mansions, that is Northern Capital Luo Feng. With our true light shining clearly, brightening darkness, moving the true water of the Great Yin at the Eastern Well to rinse away dark souls, then saving by the true fire of the Southern Li; even the souls of the limitless divine village all are universally announced and saved.

Upper release of ancestral examinations, countless kalpa lineage, swiftly removing guilty registers, destroying evil roots, not to be detained, pressed into ghost clusters.

Those who are ancestral deceased; if the descendants cannot cultivate goodness and accumulate virtue, surely calamity reaches the nine ancestors, all fall into ruin, no escape. If one can know cultivation and exalt scripture and teaching, transfer goodness and spread blessings, then upper release of ancestral punishment formation, also the lineage and distant ancestors all obtain salvation. Guanfu says: At each Three Officials’ examination, if descendants have great功, the Jade Emperor decrees immediate salvation of the nine mysterious seven ancestors. One body receives salvation, then the nine ancestors receive grace. Thus now swiftly removing guilty registers, and evil roots also fall away. Evil roots mean evil thought roots of nature. Guilty registers are the records of hell officials, light and heavy sins. By grace of compassion and salvation, greatly pardoning their karma, then evil roots are destroyed, name registers removed, even the nether world cannot detain them, pressing into ghost clusters. All the countless kalpa relatives all ride universal salvation. Those who know cultivation and refining do not let themselves be disturbed by vanity and desire; their nature is clear and bright, thoroughly penetrating and wonderful, then the three corpses and six thieves cannot confuse and pollute. Cultivating long after, myriad Qi face the birth gate, hundred spirits guard the death gate, not delayed in suffering, countless ancestors all thus ascend.

Primordial talisman command, timely ascension and advance. Northern Capital Cold Pool, guarding form and soul, restraining demons and recommending; salvation to Southern Palace. Dead souls receive refinement, immortal transforming to man. Birth body receives salvation, kalpa after kalpa enduring. Following kalpa rotation, equal to Heaven’s years, forever saving the three paths, five sufferings and eight hardships, transcending the three realms, roaming at ease in Shangqing.

Mo’an says: This speaks of the scholar’s ancestral souls refined, self receiving salvation. The Primordial talisman command is like the Spirit Treasure Dharma of Birth Heaven Talisman, Saving Hardship Nine Dragons Talisman, various true talismans and slips, all decreed by the Primordial Heavenly Venerable, issuing orders to the Nine Heavens’ Nine Offices, commanding the three realms and ten directions to act; thus timely able to ascend. The Northern Capital Cold Pool is Luo Feng Spring Song. Guarding form and soul means at death form departs and soul disperses; the Northern Emperor receives decree to guard the departed souls, not to let them scatter. Restraining and ordering demon kings to recommend, then salvation at the Southern Palace Zhuling. Refined dead souls, dwelling in the dark extreme yin mansion, receiving the Heavenly Venerable’s compassionate light; one candle of true yang, refined within then darkness sees brightness, yin pure and yang clean, immortal transforming to man. Those who can cultivate scripture and teaching, cleanse and refine form and spirit, then birth body receives salvation, kalpa after kalpa not losing human body, and true nature endures. Following kalpa rotation, equal to Heaven’s years; kalpa numbers eventually ruined, almost confined to form and Qi; only attained immortals have one spiritual subtlety, enduring kalpas without ruin, lasting with Heaven and Earth. Ever saving the three paths, five sufferings, eight hardships; the three paths are: first desire realm gate, upper corpse way of heavenly road; second love desire gate, middle corpse way of man road; third greed desire gate, lower corpse way of earth road. Also called three evils that block people’s path to immortality. The five sufferings are: form suffering the heart, love suffering the spirit, greed suffering the form, vanity suffering the essence, body suffering the soul. The five sufferings and three paths are therefore called eight hardships. If one can know the way to return to root and life, hold emotion and return nature, abandon illusion and return truth, then the three karma and six roots are all purified and extinguished, one truth alone revealed, myriad illusions all empty, circulating the primordial ancestor Qi in Kan, Li, and Ji Ji, molding soul and forging spirit, cutting the earth root and proving the heavenly root; thus dead souls receive refinement, birth body receives salvation, three realms cannot detain or capture, instantly transcending no-leak realm, roaming at ease in Shangqing.

The Heaven of Shangqing, Heavenly Emperor Yu Zhen, the Formless Realm Brahma Conduct.

Youqi says: The Heaven of Shangqing, the thirty-six heavenly emperors most supreme and utmost. Dao equal to Primordial, ranked among Jade Clear, hence called Yu Zhen. It is the thirty-six heavens below Shangqing, different from the thirty-two heavens. Having form but no colour, hence called Brahma Conduct. Brahma Conduct is the Way among the Way, Heaven among Heaven, entering and exiting without interval, true void without obstruction. The Dragon Treading Scripture says: Shangqing’s twelve heavens are the abode of the Nine Truths, Heavenly Emperor Yu Zhen, the emperor of heaven. His body contains jade, his Qi governs utmost truth; because of his pure cultivation, he is called Yu Zhen. The foregoing text said roaming at ease in Shangqing; this especially explains the Heaven of Shangqing where heavenly emperors dwell in the formless realm, purely cultivating Brahma Conduct to prove the Way and attain truth.

Eastern Eight Heavens:

Mo’an says: This sequence of the thirty-two heavens, quoting the vulgar text, adding the Primordial Spirit Book’s upper chapter, with the Dao Sovereign writing nine characters, cannot be followed. From Huangzeng Heaven to the Seven Luminaries Heaven,
