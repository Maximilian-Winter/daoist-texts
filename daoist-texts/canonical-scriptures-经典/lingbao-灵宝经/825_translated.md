## The Supreme Great Way: The Three Origins' Precepts, Confession of Sins, and Superior Method

The Heavenly Venerable declared:  
All who cultivate the Superior Method should, on the fifteenth day of the first, seventh, and tenth months, at the three times of daybreak, noon, and midnight, bathe their bodies, washing themselves with five fragrant substances. When about to bathe, face the southwest; with a golden ladle, turn the fragrant water thirty-two times in a leftward rotation toward the southeast. Close the eyes and think of the sunlight above the left eye, the moonlight above the right eye, the Five Planets' coronets upon the head, five-coloured clouds enveloping the body, Azure Dragon, White Tiger, Vermilion Bird, and Black Tortoise arrayed around, lions and white cranes ranged on left and right, immortal children holding towels, jade maidens scattering blossoms, flying immortals riding steeds, guarding the person. Then knock the teeth twenty-one times and recite the incantation:

> Heaven is clear and pure in its Qi, the five colours are lofty and bright.  
> Sun and Moon emit their splendour, pouring upon my form.  
> Spirit waters cleanse within, fragrance rises refining essence.  
> Light and shadow penetrate deeply, shining upon the Supreme Clarity.  
> Qi receives no dust, five palaces receive the spirit.  
> Sins vanish in the three paths, calamities dissipate in the nine darknesses.  
> Evil roots are severed, blessings and felicity arise spontaneously.  
> Today I make great vows, all I report and covenant.  
> Body prepared for deliverance, ascending into the imperial court.

When ended, swallow the incense thirty-two times and cease. Then cleanse and bathe the five spirits. When bathing is complete, don hat, belt, and garments. Again knock the teeth twelve times and recite the incantation:

> The five impurities are cleared, the eight illuminations are brightened.  
> Today I receive refinement, sins are destroyed, blessings arise.  
> Long may I abide with the Five Emperors, fasting in truth before the upper spirits.

Then proceed out and enter a chamber, following the Way and performing the Dao. Upon entering, face east and burn incense; knock the teeth thirty-two times and recite:

> Supreme Three Heavens, Profound Origin, Primordial Three Qi, the Supreme Old Lord,  
> summon forth from my person the three and five officials, the left and right officers and messengers, the left and right bearers of incense, the dragon riders, the attendants of incense, the jade children, the jade maidens who convey words, the Five Emperors’ direct talismans, the officers of the incense on duty, each thirty-two in number.  
> Those summoned appear in solemn attire, opening this place's land and domain true officials and proper spirits.  
> I now perform incense burning and Dao cultivation, presenting petitions and wishes,  
> that I may obtain the genuine Qi of the ten directions to enter into my person,  
> causing the summons to swiftly reach the boundless Heavenly Venerable, the Supreme Great Way, the Most True Supreme Emperor’s presence.

I, disciple so-and-so, born of former karmic connection, have obtained life and transformation of the Dao, having been enlightened and raised by the Three Caverns’ Master so-and-so, delivered from corrupt decayed flesh, studying scripture and methods, surpassing the great grace, utterly without limit. Yet I am born and raised in the mundane world, the five spirits contending, dust deep and sinful filth, never self-aware, growing together with sin. Mountains and seas accumulate; from former lives to this, I know not the cause or origin. Through countless kalpas, reaching to this day, the sins are recorded in heaven and earth, registered in what books, by the Three Officials’ hand, detained by the earth’s servants. Though I strive to cultivate myself, there is no spiritual response; true spirit does not descend, many demons assail, causing my thoughts to be distracted and my five spirits to fly astray. I constantly fear that once I return to the nether abyss, I shall be bound through myriad kalpas, unable to escape forever.

Therefore, on this great auspicious day of the Three Origins, having purified myself and burned incense, I first repent and apologise for the sins and offences accumulated from former lives until this very day, those unforgiven by heaven, unpardoned by earth, unpitied by spirits, unrelieved by ghosts, countless innumerable offences and transgressions. I have violated the Three Origins’ one hundred and eighty precepts, the Three Officials’ nine palaces and one hundred and twenty departments, Yin and Yang, water and fire, the left and right central palace’s examining officers. Now I burn incense and return my body, spirit, and destiny to the Boundless Heavenly Venerable, the Supreme Dao Lord, the Thirty-Two Heavenly Emperors, the Great Saints of the Ten Directions, the Most True Lords and Ancestors, the Flying Heavenly Kings, Celestial Immortals, Earth Immortals, the Authentic Persons of the Five Mountains, jade maidens, the heavens of sun, moon, and stars, the Stellar Emperor of the Nine Star Constellations, and the ten thousand spirits of the Boundless earthly ten directions, the Three Realms’ Five Emperors, Three Officials, Nine Palaces, One Hundred and Twenty Departments, the Three Rivers, Four Seas, Nine Rivers, and Eight Extremes’ myriad deities and officials. I beseech the granting of great grace to forgive all sins committed in my former and present life. By the merit of this incense offering, may the root of sin be uprooted; may the earthly registers be erased; may the black ledger of the Right Palace be destroyed; may I be delivered by the Left Palace’s record of longevity and prosperity; may immortals and spirits save the world, enjoying endless longevity. After attaining the Dao, may I ascend into formlessness, harmonising with the True.

When the purification is complete, the officers all face east and kneel long, knocking teeth twenty-four times, proclaiming all received offices as recorded, bowing twice, and then say:

Supreme Boundless Great Way, Supreme Great Dao Lord, Supreme Old Lord, Supreme Ancestor, Most Supreme Profound Elder, the Boundless Great Way of the Ten Directions, Lords of Virtue and Sacred Heaven, Most True Supreme Emperors, Heavenly Emperors, Heavenly Master Lords, Spiritual Treasure Chief Purifiers, we who are but ignorant and base, though impure and lowly, delight in the Way and rejoice in Immortality, having mistakenly received the responsibility of the Law, obtaining the Nine Dark Ascents of the Rising Scene, with will exhausted yet foolish and short, we strive with hair and skin, bearing one another along.  
At this present month and day, time and place, in such a county, district, or village, we establish purification and fasting, burn incense and recite scriptures, think of spirits and contemplate truth, at such days and nights, at such times performing the Way, beseeching thanks for cultivation.  
When the matter concludes, we petition the Supreme Clarity Three Caverns’ Flying Immortals, Celestial Immortals, Earth Immortals, the Five Directions’ Heavenly Troops and Riders, the attendants of scriptures and incense, jade children and maidens, Spiritual Treasure officials, chief purifiers, the many true ones of the Five Mountains, Four Rivers, and Four Directions’ inspector spirits, all to visit the True Palace, present offerings to the Immortals, confer titles and imperial ranks, and assign true offices according to rank, as per the ceremony of the Supreme True.  
Grant us to seek and attain the Dao, seek and attain Immortality, to divide our forms and transformations, descend in the seventy-four directions, lower the three origins, descend green carriages, fly to the Supreme Clarity, rise to the Nine Heavens of the Ascending Scene, share the sun and moon’s radiance, and unite the Three Treasures’ wheels.  
If we receive the Most Sacred’s supervision and illuminate our red feelings, though our study of the Law be incomplete, and our purification ritual imperfect and not conforming to ceremony, advancing and retreating violating rules, thereby incurring the censure of the Four Authorities, the grip of the Five Emperors, and committing myriad offences and sins, we beseech pardon and forgiveness.  
Pity and forgive our ignorance and failure to perceive sin and punishment. Within our bodies dwell the five true spirit officials, who according to merit ascend to the Profound Capital, receive rank, and upon completion return to our bodies, ascending with us, flying in the great void.  
Humbly we petition to make known these words, with utmost reverence and fear, bowing twice.

When finished, proceed left and return west, facing east, burn incense thrice, and recite the incantation:

> Incense officers, messengers, left and right dragon and tiger lords, bearers of incense, dragon riders,  
> command that in my quiet chamber and purification hall be generated the natural golden liquid, the cinnabar essence and myriad spirits, and the meeting of the magical herbs, here before this incense flame.  
> Command that I may obtain the Dao and thus attain Immortality, that my entire household may receive blessing, above and below receive grace, the jade children and jade maidens of the Ten Directions attend the incense smoke, convey my petitions directly before the Boundless Supreme Great Way.

The Heavenly Venerable said:  
This is the Three Origins’ Precepts’ sincere Confession of Sins Superior Method. Within the Three Origins’ Palace, hidden are the forms and spirits; with focused thought upon the root of sin, cultivating immortality and the Superior Way. The disciple should practice it thrice yearly. When doing so, the heart, cinnabar, and intention must be fully exerted, spirit and form enduring hardship together, without weariness or cessation, touching the Heavens thoroughly. The Three Origins erase sins from the black ledgers; the Northern Emperor strikes down death and raises life; the Three Officials recommend to merit; the Supreme Profound records in the Immortal Register.  
Those who seek the Dao, if not by suffering do not penetrate, if not by cinnabar do not respond, if not by diligence do not obtain, if not by merit do not attain, if not by will do not overcome, if not by heart do not complete. One must allow the body to labour at the beginning, the spirit to rejoice at the end, finally attaining non-action, mastering entrance into naturalness.  
Those impure in sin cling to greed for playthings and treasures, behold worldly joys and momentary honours, knowing not the end, which returns to suffering, burning in the three palaces, sinking into countless kalpas, when shall they return?  
Therefore, the wise and the foolish each have their own aspirations and undertakings; the foolish esteem beginnings, the wise value the end. The foolish and the wise differ in their knowledge, how can they be spoken of alike?

The Heavenly Venerable said:  
Those who study must on the Three Origins’ most auspicious days, refine incense water themselves, bathe the Five Spirits, then their Qi will be clear and form upright, spirit bright and true, body free from defilement, Qi free from dust, the three passes clear and empty, ten thousand evils not afflicting, the three departments and eight illuminations revealing the body within. By wearing, guiding, and leading, the five palaces emit fragrance, inside and outside filled, all attaining Immortality. The superior person flies and ascends, riding the scene and clouds; the middle person hides and transforms, sitting and standing, and perishes; the lower person extinguishes and delivers, turning the wheel of saintly kingship, extinguished yet not ceased, ultimately attaining Immortality. This method is lofty and subtle, difficult to master; now disclosed for use with diligence. The Dao Lord bows and receives these essential words.

The Heavenly Venerable said:  
Those who accumulate learning but have not attained the Dao, all carry their past burdens, raised by the Three Officials, held by the Nine Palaces, recorded by the one hundred and twenty departments’ left and right examining officers, evil roots unextinguished, demons assailing, causing the five spirits to contend, the body offended without awareness, sins and filth increasing daily, spirits fleeing, though seeing the many laws, the root of sin is not loosened, laboring the mind in vain, gaining nothing until death.  
Now on the Three Origins’ great celebration, the auspicious day of life opening, the Heavens return their chariots, Saints gather, weighing life and death’s record of merits and demerits, the Daoist Law spreads mercy, loving the people and nurturing creatures, those whose sins are seen are entered in the death register, bound through kalpas never to be liberated, study without benefit, greatly lamentable.  
Now the Purple Yang Jade Register is opened, issuing the Three Origins’ sincere Confession of Sins Superior Method, to save learners, perfect their merits and virtues, proclaim the heavenly laws in all their articles. For the learner not yet attained, regardless of merit or demerit, all are made to have heart, to receive the Great Law, to erase sin registers and enter immortal registers.  
Now renewed, proclaim to all Heavens, without high or low, without deep or distant, without great or small, without end or limit, without hidden or secret, without sound or echo, in silent darkness, profound penetration, great wisdom source, the Three Palaces, Nine Palaces, one hundred and twenty departments, all spirits and gods, none unaccepting.  
At this time the great Saints of Heaven, Boundless Revered Spirits, Supreme Dao Lords all stand long, raise hands to call to all, snap fingers to pronounce good.  
Then the Heavenly Venerable opens the great grace of pardon, all men and women of the Heavens begin to learn, none do not respectfully cultivate and practice the Great Law, all are immediately delivered, their bodies obtaining Immortality, ascending in broad daylight, rising to the imperial palace.  
Those with good hearts and faith who turn to it respectfully receive deliverance, turning the wheel of life and death without passing through the earth’s service, their merits completed and virtues full, and also attain Immortality, their rank equal to flying immortals, roaming the ten directions.

The Heavenly Venerable said:  
Those who on the Three Origins’ most auspicious days cultivate the Three Origins’ sincere Confession of Sins Method, then the Three Officials and Nine Palaces’ right registers, the Five Emperors’ recommendation, will have their names entered among the Heavens, the many true ones rejoicing, countless spirits opening pardon, past offenses dispersed, sin roots universally resolved, the three assemblies responding thoroughly, the Three Palaces, Nine Palaces, one hundred and twenty departments examining and arresting, erasing black registers, severing old roots, inscribing names in the Left Contract Azure Register, myriad spirits to protect and serve, the Three Realms to receive, demons subdued, a thousand disasters not afflicting, the Dao and truth spontaneously arising, attaining Immortality.
