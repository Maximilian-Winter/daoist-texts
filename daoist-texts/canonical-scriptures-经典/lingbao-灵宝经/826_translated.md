# The Supreme Most Profound Lady Qing of the Three Origins: The Chapter on Precepts, the Removal of Offences, and the Marvelous Scripture

Title of the Scripture: The Supreme Most Profound Lady Qing of the Three Origins: The Chapter on Precepts, the Removal of Offences, and the Marvelous Scripture. The compiler is unknown; it seems to have proceeded from the Southern and Northern Dynasties or the Sui and Tang periods. It is a recension and expansion of the "Three Origins Chapter on Precepts, Merits, and the Weight of Good and Evil." Composed of three scrolls. The original source is from the "Orthodox Daoist Canon," the Section of Cavernous Truth, under the category of Scriptural Texts.

## Scroll the Upper

The Most Profound Lady Qing said: The Supreme Way Jade Emperor, in the primordial calamity of the Dragon Han, above the three heavens, with the myriad saints of the heavens, true immortals from the ten directions, and the countless great saints, expounded the great law of the Three Caverns, the "Three Origins Chapter on the Marvelous Scripture of Sincerity." At that time, the officials of the three realms and the heavenly spirits and immortals, each numbering hundreds of millions, all assembled with reverence, attending and listening attentively to the Dharma sound.

At that time, the Primordial Heavenly Venerable addressed the multitudes, saying: I now broadly declare to all living beings within and without the three realms the wonderful method of the Three Vehicles, the precious scripture of the Three Caverns. To enlighten men and heavens, adapting to conditions, to receive the sentient beings of the Lower Origin. In the final age, men and women do not hear the Way and the Dharma; many are wrongfully slain and do not complete their allotted years. This is because sentient beings are heavy in karma and deep in offences, not returning to correct transformation, turning from truth to falsity, only employing evil conduct. After death, their souls have nowhere to rely upon, becoming bound and lodged in the Fengdu hell. When the kalpa is ended and the mountains consumed, there is no means of liberation. You living beings should save all those within the great thousand worlds, within the lands of the ten directions, all faithful men and women. From now on, they should recite the precious scripture of the Three Origins Lady Qing’s marvelous canon. The merit of this scripture is that it uplifts gods and men above, and aids through the long night below; its blessings are endless, its grace and resources boundless. One will be spared at the time of death from having the soul enter Fengdu and receive retribution.

At that time, the Superior Origin First Rank Nine Qi Heavenly Official, the Purple Tenuity Emperor, formed from the talisman of prolonging life and the primal Yang Qi, dwelt in the Mysterious Capital of Prime Yang, in the Upper Palace of the Seven Treasures of Purple Tenuity, the Hall of Green Mist, seated upon clouds, upon a throne of purple gold; leaning upon a desk of blue jade, holding a tablet of azure jade; to the left and right the arrayed immortals stood guard. The palace of the Superior Origin extended five hundred million li, all formed of azure and profound Qi. It is the supreme lord of the True Nature Jade Void Supreme Emperor, the emperors of the heavens, the true immortals of supreme truth, together with the rulers of states, ministers, empresses, consorts, kings, princes, and all officials and their households, and the peoples beneath heaven, all their noble and base origins in guilt and blessing. Among them the divine officials and bureaucrats all possess the natural Qi as their essence; if not recorded in the golden vaults and jade tablets as those who have attained the Way, none can behold them. Within the Purple Tenuity Palace there are again three offices to the left, right, and centre. The left office governs the official of birth, examined by the fiery official of the sun. The right office governs the official of death, examined by the watery official of the moon. The central office governs the officials of birth, death, guilt, and blessing, examined by the wind blade. The three offices together oversee thirty-six departments, each with ninety million officials; and every evening of the Superior Origin, they examine the causes and correspondences of birth and death, guilt and blessing, within the great thousand worlds and the lands of the ten directions; all beings are reverent and respectful.

The thirty-six bureaus of the right, the Immortal Officials of the Most Profound Lady Qing, are placed under the Purple Tenuity Palace. Each office has one chief examiner, one thousand two hundred examining clerks, twelve thousand examining soldiers, and one hundred and twenty thousand examining scholars. They oversee the records of those already attained to the Way and those yet to attain, recording present blessings, rulers, ministers, heavenly princes, empresses, consorts, officials, and faithful men and women, keeping account of merits and demerits, sins and blessings, their causes and corresponding examinations. Each year on the fifteenth day of the first month, the Superior Origin Heavenly Official Purple Tenuity Emperor examines the great thousand worlds and lands of the ten directions, the registers of ascent and descent of the heavenly spirits, the stars illuminating the lands and their fortunes and misfortunes; the rulers, virtuous ministers, kings and princes, all sentient beings’ allotted times and limits, down to the fishes and dragons that change and fly, ten thousand kinds, changing forms, rising and sinking in time. Within the three paths and the nine offices, the names of sins and retributions, the limits of years and kalpas, those who are to be born as men are struck from the list of the long night office and placed in the left palace. Those who are to become various colours, evil spirits, demons, and ghosts, are assigned to the right palace, their names written in the black ledger. When their allotted number is fulfilled, they change form again; according to the different heights and lows of their karma, their retributions vary. Among them are guilty souls merged into the ten thousand classes of creatures; according to lightness or heaviness of sin, they are distributed in their birth places, some as jackals, tigers, leopards, or asses, horses, camels, mules, some as oxen, sheep, geese, ducks, some as chickens, dogs, doves, owls, some as deer, antelope, foxes, rabbits, some as sparrows, larks, flies, insects, some as beetles, snakes, rats, some as ants, mosquitoes, horseflies, some as deer, qilin, turtles, tortoises, dragons, clams, dragonflies, some as great whales, sea horses, snails, clams, worms, fishes, some as crows, peacocks, hawks, falcons, flying squirrels, some as frogs, fleas, lice, some as bent ants, centipedes, some as loaches, jacks, jellyfish, crabs, spiders, some as strange forms, birds, fishes, wild beasts all kinds. Such multitudes, some running, some flying, some walking, some sitting, some with many legs, some without, some viviparous, some oviparous, some dwelling in dry places, some in wet, some nesting, some burrowing, a hundred forms, a thousand changes, impossible to name definitively. Some depend on ancient trees or strange stones, some dwell in abysses, marshes, springs, some on hills or rocks, some in wells, stoves, ditches, some among men as various monsters. Such multitudes, all bearing a destined body, await their allotted time of examination. On the night of the Heavenly Official’s record examination, they will change form according to karma, receive retributions according to blessings, revolve with the kalpa, and live and die according to karma and condition, without further distinction. If there be faithful men and women who set their hearts to write out this scripture, scatter and circulate it, offer incense, flowers, precious canopies, and make offerings to the heavens, then all offences committed will be entirely extinguished. Or on the eve of the Three Origins, they may hold a sacrificial rite to thank the heavens; or on the days of the ten straight periods, recite this scripture, and receive boundless blessings.

The Lady Qing said: The merits of this scripture can resolve grievances of a hundred lives, can extinguish sins of countless kalpas, can remove bodily faults, can eliminate baseless calamities, can free from the pains of birth and death, can pacify the minds of multitudes. All living beings, from now on, if they suffer calamity, disease, curses, or enmity, should recite this scripture. If there be pestilence or epidemic, or invasion by demons, they should immediately hold and recite this scripture. If they desire to conceive and seek profit, enter the sea to seek wealth, undertake construction or move earth, establish dwellings or settle graves, they should forthwith hold and recite this scripture. If there be obstacles to merit and fame, official rank declining, or voyages by boat with fear of waves and storms, they should also hold and recite this scripture. If they desire to open the long night, save and rescue wandering souls, explain past calamities, and save those in the nether pains, they should but hold and recite this scripture, and receive boundless blessings. If there be locusts, floods, wars arising in the four quarters, rulers troubled, people dying, they should at pure places, or ancient altars and spirit temples, establish a Daoist altar, suspend banners and canopies, circulate the recitation of this scripture, light lamps to guide the Way, hold great sacrificial rites to the five stars and various heavenly constellations, then the land will be peaceful and pure, times harmonious and customs peaceful; locusts and wars will naturally cease, drought and flood, wind and disaster will be overcome. If faithful men and women be born in much adversity, with weak fortunes, or long illness incurable by medicine, or often violate the laws of kings, chained in bondage for years, or suffer madness or be possessed by demons, they should copy this scripture, distribute to the people, and mutually recite it. If any living beings do thus, calamities will be removed, evils extinguished, life prolonged, blessings boundless.

The Lady Qing said: All living beings revolve in cycles of birth and death, retribution and reward, calamity and blessing appear without difference, all await the day of the Three Origins, the night of the Three Officials’ examination, when birth and death, poverty and wealth, men and ghosts, fowls and beasts are allotted. Those who receive blessings are recorded in the left palace; those who become ghosts or beasts, in the right palace; all await their appointed times.

The Lady Qing said: All faithful men and women, or those who attain the name of immortals, should use the jade tablets of merits and demerits, or those who remove their fallen grades of guilt and reward, as in the records of the Purple Tenuity Palace’s limit registers, sealed in the Mysterious Capital’s bright jade treasury of the Superior Origin Heavenly Officials’ palace, awaiting the day of the Three Officials’ assembly of saints, to fix the registers of ascent and descent of the gods and immortals, and the causes of deep or shallow merits and demerits of good and evil men and women, the calculation of life spans and examination of limits, down to the Nine Nether regions, removing the limits of birth and death and merit and guilt, the periods of growth and decay of sentient beings, and on the day of the Superior Origin record to report to the Supreme Void Emperor Dao Lord.

The Lady Qing said: Within the great thousand worlds, within the lands of the ten directions, all good and evil men and women, their birth, death, guilt, blessings, lightness or heaviness of merits, years, months and days calculated and allotted, all are divided into the blue and black ledgers, presented to the upper palace. If their good merits be sufficient, they should be gathered among the immortals, called the Purple Tenuity Palace. If there be those who venerate the Supreme Mysterious Ultimate Law, they are said to be in the Left Palace of the Supreme Ultimate, their names written in golden registers, engraved with the characters of the immortal bureaus, charged to the earth officials as attendants, to record the tablets in the upper palace, to protect the three realms, so that all external demons cannot disturb, just as by the law of Lady Qing.

The blue and profound tablets should be written. Now I record the Supreme True General Records of birth and death in their categories as follows; you living beings should reverently observe:

- Supreme True General overseeing ranks of meditation, hierarchy, merits and demerits ceremonies.
- Supreme True General overseeing assembly rites of myriad saints, revolving merits and demerits ceremonies.
- Supreme True General overseeing great saintly banquets and attendant merits and demerits ceremonies.
- Supreme True General overseeing birth and death charts and registers of merits and demerits ceremonies.
- Supreme True General overseeing birth and death fate registers and calculations of merits and demerits ceremonies.
- Supreme True General overseeing merits and demerits of birth and death, lightness and heaviness ceremonies.
- Supreme True General overseeing ghosts and spirits' duties and retributive cycles, merits and demerits ceremonies.
- Supreme True General overseeing ghosts and spirits’ exile, release, and lifespan limits, merits and demerits ceremonies.
- Supreme True General overseeing ghosts and spirits’ ascents and death-soul rebirth, merits and demerits ceremonies.
- Supreme True General overseeing death-souls’ refining and rebirth registers, merits and demerits ceremonies.
- Supreme True General overseeing immortals’ attainment of the Way, purity, ranks, merits and demerits ceremonies.
- Supreme True General overseeing myriad demon songs and sounds, merits and demerits ceremonies.

Previously the Supreme True General oversaw within the three realms, the lands of the ten directions, all names of merits and demerits. At the eve of the Three Origins, the blue and black ledgers were written and presented to the upper palace, all according to the sins and blessings performed, their extent of release, their karma’s lightness or heaviness, their manifest retribution, with no difference between men and heavens. You living beings should but circulate this scripture, solemnly hold incense and flowers, various offerings, then calamities and retributions shall vanish forever, blessings increase like the great sea, grievances and litigations shall not invade, life and death will be at peace. I now shall for all living beings within the great thousand worlds, within the lands of the ten directions, all faithful men and women, cause all sins to be confessed and repentant, all wiped away without further retribution. Repentance for good men and women who do not believe in the holy scriptures with sincerity, harboring doubts and divided hearts. Repentance for disciples who lightly disdain the sacred Way scriptures, who criticize the classics. Repentance for disciples who steal Daoist images and scriptures, or destroy or deface them, or hold them without respect to teachers and ancestors. Repentance for disciples who without a teacher transmit the Three Caverns Dharma, thus causing sin. Repentance for disciples who slight their teachers and violate their vows. Repentance for disciples who slander masters and do not honor heavenly righteousness. Repentance for disciples who conceal the Three Caverns scriptures and Dharma, so that they do not flow forth. Repentance for disciples who obtain immortal scriptures and marvelous Dharma, but falsely transmit them to unworthy persons. Repentance for disciples who receive Dharma but do not follow the rules and sincerity, and lightly leak spiritual texts. Repentance for disciples who after transmission of scriptures do not respect teachers’ agreements. Repentance for disciples who after receiving scriptures do not open the Way for all living beings. Repentance for disciples who without reason destroy or cut the Supreme Ultimate sacred Dao scriptures and images and various Dharma objects. Repentance for disciples who transmit Dharma but do not report to the heavens and covenant the Five Emperors and Three Officials according to rites. Repentance for disciples who after receiving scriptures have no faith or respect, despise Dharma and teachers. Repentance for disciples who obstruct the holy Way’s path, so that it does not spread, seeking fame for themselves. Repentance for disciples who on the days of new and full moons and eight festivals do not respect teachers, showing arrogance. Repentance for disciples who on fasting days do not offer fine incense, and neglect all living beings. Repentance for disciples who recite scriptures carelessly, without a heart to save beings, arrogantly calling themselves quick and clever. Repentance for scholars who practice the Way improperly, competing for fame. Repentance for disciples who after receiving the Way, when their families suffer disaster or decline, do not examine their faults, but blame the Way and their teachers. Repentance for disciples who slander good men, falsely accuse the sun and moon, lightly treat the holy Way, but esteem heretical teaching. Repentance for disciples who with two tongues speak evil, drink wine wildly, and criticize four generations. Repentance for disciples who are greedy, arrogant and idle, defiling the true vehicle. Repentance for disciples who have cursed ghosts and spirits, uttered false and ornate words, killed living beings. Repentance for disciples who have committed fornication and filth, envied the virtuous, stolen others’ wealth. Repentance for disciples who have deceived teachers, disrespected Dharma, and revealed immortal secrets. Repentance for disciples who have slandered scriptures with falsehood, forcibly oppressed living beings, not abiding by the correct Dharma. Repentance for disciples who have spoken of others’ faults and evils, seeking fame, or spoken one thing and meant another, secretly practicing poison and evil, lightly esteeming immortals and saints, proudly relying on their merits. Repentance for disciples who have bullied fellow students, neglected living beings, causing instability. Repentance for disciples who have defiled the Three Treasures, destroyed true rites, measured sacred texts, called true false, esteemed heresy, slandered the great vehicle, caused good people to act badly, relied on noble birth to damage spiritual texts, deceived living beings to suffer calamities, envied and harmed the virtuous, caused insecurity, destroyed immortal halls, called truth false, seized blessed lands, sided with evil to support the strong, destroyed mysterious altars, injured spiritual halls. Such sins, upon hearing and reciting this scripture, are all extinguished. Furthermore, repentance for disciples from time without beginning to the present day who have harmed good and benefited evil, served themselves and harmed others, forbidden and struck living beings, cut off grain and water, or because of public law delved into punishment, or held fire to burn mountains, harming all sentient beings, or dried stream beds, killed insects and fish, or cut off springs, refusing to let them flow, or deprived men of love, making others light and contemptible, separating kin, or seeking profit and fame, harming the good or spreading poison, killing sentient beings, or exploiting living beings for personal wealth, or falsely interpreting scripture meanings against the holy mind, or disparaging spiritual texts as false, or not investigating the origin of the Three Caverns sect, destroying the Three Pure Ones’ scriptures and images. The sins aforementioned are countless and boundless, like dust and sand, spoken throughout kalpas, impossible to exhaust; all belong to the thirty-six bureaus of the Heavenly Officials and the wind blade’s examination. If within the dust worlds of the ten directions and the great thousand lands, all faithful men and women, from time without beginning to the present day, or parents, brothers, relatives, kin, have committed such sins as aforesaid, they but should circulate this scripture, copy it, distribute and circulate it, and receive boundless blessings and inexhaustible increase. The sins committed will all be extinguished; both new and old calamities will be opened and released.

At that time, the multitudes of the heavens bowed in reverence and practiced, and composed a hymn:

Primordial Heaven, Primordial Beginning, the Unsurpassed Dharma King.  
Grace pervades the three realms, blessings cover the ten directions.  
All living beings rely upon it, all moving things are at peace.  
The Dharma sound flows and changes, rescuing and aiding existence and extinction.  
The Nine Nether realms find release, the five sufferings are without harm.  
The cold pool thaws, darkness flows as light.  
Reciting, holding, and offering, inexhaustible blessings and auspiciousness.

The Supreme Most Profound Lady Qing of the Three Origins Chapter on Precepts, Removal of Offences, and Marvelous Scripture — Scroll the Upper.

## Scroll the Middle

The Most Profound Lady Qing said: The Middle Origin Second Rank Earth Official Clear Void True Lord, commands the left, right, and middle three offices, altogether forty-two bureaus. The immortal officials of the three offices all are of the cave void clear empty mixed primordial Qi; their palaces each extend fifty million li. They govern the five emperors, the five sacred mountains, and all gods, spirits, and immortals. Among them the immortal officials total ninety million multitudes. They govern all within the great thousand worlds and lands of the ten directions all good and evil men and women’s birth and death registers. The retribution of blessings and punishments, life span length or shortness, wealth or poverty, years, months and limits of numbers. Even the flying birds and running beasts of the world, all crawling insects and fishes, the periods of change, each according to their allotments, are reported to the Purple Tenuity Upper Palace and await the Heavenly Officials’ records. Some receive transformation, change form according to blessings, receive retribution according to karma, each with their length and limits of years and months. If any living beings have many karma obstacles and what they do is not beneficial, then with rare flowers, precious fruits, pure water, fragrant incense day and night, diligently and reverently inviting masters, circulating the recitation of this scripture, holding Three Origins sacrificial rites, and speaking of the merit of the Eight Festivals, they shall immediately have retributions ceased forever, their names inscribed upon golden tablets. The merit of this scripture can cure myriad diseases, can remove multitudes of sufferings, can relieve calamities, can dispel all evils, can gather a thousand auspicious things, can reach a hundred blessings, can assist life span calculation, can rescue the nether depths. You living beings should but hold and maintain it, receiving boundless blessings. Now I reveal the positions of the left, right, and middle three offices’ forty-two bureaus of immortal officials; you living beings, if you but supply offerings, your merits will benefit the nether prison, without limit; all are reverent and respectful.

The forty-two bureaus of the right palace are placed by the Most Profound Lady Qing under the Cave Void Clear Empty Palace, each with left, right, and middle three offices. Each office has one examiner, one hundred and twenty clerks, one thousand two hundred scholars, and twelve thousand soldiers. They govern the gods of the five sacred mountains, the nine earth lords, the four directions and eight extremes, all immortal officials, and those who have attained the Way among the disciples, as well as the records of merits and demerits, sins and blessings, made by all faithful men and women. Those of great blessing are examined once every three years, those of moderate blessing once every nine years, and those of little blessing once every twenty-four years. Sin and blessing proceed together, merit and demerit are equally rewarded. Their registers are sealed in the five sacred mountain cave palaces, awaiting the eve of the Three Origins, the day of the Three Officials’ assembly of saints, the night of examination, when the gods examine the limits of transformation; the middle examination concerns all those within the great thousand worlds who study the Way, their gains and losses, ranks and registers of advance and retreat; the lower examination concerns all ghosts and spirits within the three realms, their changes of form and limits of service. Within the lands of the ten directions, in all mountains, caves, rivers, seas, soils, stones, ancient trees, springs and sources, whether dragons, qilin, lions, peacocks, dragons, turtles, insects, fishes, tigers, leopards, monkeys, apes, deer, dragons, crows, squirrels, dogs, pigs, doves, larks, sparrows, mice, all fliers and runners, scales and shells, camels, mules, elephants, horses, oxen, sheep and such, whether four-legged or two-legged, many-legged or legless, viviparous or oviparous, dwelling in nests or burrows, in water or mud, dependent on ancient trees or springs, or spirit altars, wells or stoves, on hills, old tombs, or ancient spiritual altars, all forms and appearances, various and strange, are all beasts, spirits, demons, or ghosts, some bring blessing to men, others disaster. All await their appointed times and will be examined. Such multitudes though in the world are not constant. If they cannot harm men, at the time of examination they shall be transformed to human forms. Those of wealth, poverty, rank and measure shall be allotted according to their karma. Such multitudes dwelling among men, if they commit various punishments and harms, afflicting all beings, at the time of examination they shall change forms and endure renewed suffering, some as base
