The Most High Cavernous Profound Spiritual Treasure Scripture of Flight through the Three Realms, Penetrating the Subtlety, Inner Contemplation, and Marvelous Tao

The True Person of the Supreme Pole said: The Most High Spiritual Treasure flying through the three realms conceals the highest Way within, able to maintain long fasting and practice; within a hundred days, all ailments are removed, the complexion brightens, white hair turns black, fallen teeth regenerate. If practiced for two hundred days, the marrow is filled and bones become solid, intestines transform into sinews, scars and sores vanish, stiffness and distortion, hoarseness, blindness, and deafness, all are made to see and hear. If practiced for three hundred days, one enters and leaves (places) without obstacle, commands ghosts and spirits, soars through the void, feet tread on floating clouds, roaming freely as one wills, departing from that Kunlun. If practiced for three years, one attains the Way and becomes true, roaming and feasting in the eight extremes, riding the qilin, supported by the white tiger, shielded by the azure dragon. If practiced for five years, one summons and tours the three realms, attaining rank among the immortal kings. Such is the marvel spoken of; the Way is extended by man — how could this be mere persuasion? Indeed, the august existence extends the Way, though the Way outlasts man’s passing. Great indeed is the enclosure of the Most High Spiritual Treasure.
