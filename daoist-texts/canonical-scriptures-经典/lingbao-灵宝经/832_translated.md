## The Wondrous Scripture of Transformation and Void Spoken by the Primordial Heavenly Worthy

The Primordial Heavenly Worthy took up his residence on the Mount Fuluo of Yucha in the Western Celestial Heaven, the mysterious hollow of Danxuan, sitting beneath the seven-treasure jade forest and the lofty trees of the skies. He wore upon his body a nine-coloured silk robe, a flying robe and kerchief of dense forest, a crown of a hundred transformations in an instant, and girded at his side the sword that nurtures the morning light and the sunâ€™s chime. The exalted spirits attended his seat, numbering fifty million.

At that time he commanded the Five Elders, the Supreme Worthies, and the Left Duke of the Immortal Capital to unfold the seven-coloured purple treasure phoenix-feather casket of jade frost, to display the five chapters of the red script of true words, and to chant the scripture of the Supreme Scripture of Transformation and Void. The jade sounds surged in four waves, the wondrous notes arranged in eight formations. The wind was stirred in vermilion and white; a great assembly of myriad gods was convened. The profound models flowed in beauty, adorned by the purple void. The Supreme Sage rejoiced, universally scattering jade light. The heavens leapt with joy, and none failed to open in clarity. Incense and flowers, music and dancers, an uncountable multitude. Auspicious smoke assembled in eight gatherings, the golden wind blew in four courses. The three luminaries paused in their brightness; the seven spirits shone with radiance. The eight paths gleamed in brilliance, their penetration boundless.

A clear and loud call was lifted at the Upper Capital; divine grace extended afar and wide. The true essence condensed within and overflowed, the spirit released itself alone to go forth. The vital breath, light and heavy, reached the utmost heavens; the body assumed the five symbolic forms. Dragon patterns shone upon the blue ford; colours glowed upon the lofty clouds. The secret essence was scattered in the orchid groves; the feast of flying canopies was held in the eight scenic places. The reins of the dragon were held on the clear ridges; the phoenix chariot soared with lofty gaze. Squatting in the void to disperse clouds, speedily driving the cinnabar chariot to rush and race. Treading upon the nine rosy clouds to gaze eternally; ascending the three heavens to dissolve thought. The whirlwind of long smoke floated as shade; the unfolding blossoms of the sun brushed the clear destiny. The sun emitted its majesty; together with bolts of lightning it stirred up the sounds. The flowing bells intermingled and flashed; the four directions were veiled in obscurity.

Freely roaming in profound awakening, beholding the great image of transformation, washing in the orchid pool at the ford, cleansing the defilements of the ocean waves. Refining the soul in the jade waves, ascending to the assembly of the Way. The golden spirits shone and fell; the six degrees subdued (all). The principle of transformation reached the nine ultimates; the harmonious breath was eternal and long. The countenance was serene within, kindness and teaching blended without. The cave spirit molded and moved; containing truth, uttering the chapters. Looking down and up into the void, transformation became king. The Supreme Tao and Virtue universally crowned the divine ancestry. Lofty and majestic was the great model, venerated by all the heavens. The wondrous truth then shone forth; myriad breaths simultaneously returned. Darkly moved and profoundly connected, great stillness and subtle cave. The principle was wondrous, containing and unimpeded; deep and clear was the purple radiance. The waves startled the secret void, wholly sustaining the supreme occasion. Vast and spreading were the nine darknesses; the gate of the sun expanded wide.

Wings folded in the upper pavilion, spiritual transformations of the two elements. Jade and brilliant sounds issued forth; myriad echoes lamented themselves. The phoenix sang in the orchid garden, the phoenix whistled on the cloud ladder. Horses startled the deserted mansion; dragons hastened across the mysterious river. The seven origins rested; the three luminaries paused and returned. The Immortal Sovereign tightened the reins; the Primordial Lords opened the gates. Above all was order incomplete; below were bestowed the four utmost (teachings). In an instant, suddenly, the nine enclosures shone. Dark assemblies of the eight surges, entering the profound and subtle. The Supreme Emperor bore the wheel; the Five Elders held the banner. The golden tiger led the van; the celestial steeds followed in pursuit. Fierce horses bellowed; poisonous beasts emitted majesty. The heavenly soldiers seized the evil; the red script captured the wrong-doers. The celestial demons lost their breath; myriad spirits were destroyed and consumed. The jade true ones examined and admonished; none, great or small, were exempt. The three heavens followed the right way; the six breaths raced about. The dark grace washed away filth; cleansing the cold pool. The Daoist temple was reilluminated; spiritual transformations circled nine times. The great having passed through the four directions; the five domains were leveled. The whirlwind unleashed without hindrance; proceeding where the heart devised.

Boundless was the Great Beginning; wide and distant, pure and clear. The imperial stream responded to the times; myriad truths spontaneously arose. Dense and flourishing was the array. Dragon trunks spread their glory; myriad kinds bloomed in disorder. The vermilion radiance shook the jade; wings soared into the purple sky. Ascending the wings to the jade clear; the two symbols shone lightly; the eight paths shone brightly. The moon maiden warmed the blossoms; the sun child raised the essence. Flowing waters irrigated the heavens; assemblies united the eight darknesses. Hundreds of fragrances scattered their sweetness; fragrant winds riotously displayed themselves. Dim and clear was the spirit; flying wheels and azure feathers. Radiance dazzling and splendid; flowing over the seven cities. The golden boy held the kerchief; the purple consort embraced the infant. Irrigating the ford of jade sky; scattering blossoms in the crimson court. Lofty trees drummed their branches; round symbols bloomed and flourished; myriad beings opened wide; the sound echoed through the blue void. The mournful sounds issued forth the chapter; the phoenix song likewise sounded. Subtle and constant was the rhythm; the phoenix sang in harmony. Auspicious smoke intertwined and disappeared; vermilion fire and golden bells. The breath received no veil; the scene was clear and grew forth. Lofty and profound above the void; (one) may forget all affections. The high flow below the breath; spreading the spirit on distant journeys. Compassion for the world, mourning for the vulgar, bowing to harmonize all living beings. Therefore the Jade Isle engraved the yellow register tablets; the Emperor inscribed the name of the great having; the great desert inscribed the breath of the jade palace; the boundless held the age of the great catastrophe. Those who can restrain harshness in transformation prolong health without decline; those who cultivate the void and hollow gain the tranquil peace of myriad gods. Bowing and chanting the chapter of the void, myriad ghosts have no form to trade. Wondrous is the spiritual majesty, solemn and widely abiding. Lofty and majestic is the ancestral virtue, the utmost spirit of the supreme saint.

Hence he commanded the Five Elders, the Supreme Worthies, and the Left Immortal of the Immortal Capital to bring forth the essentials of the eight paths of transformation and void, to show to future generations of students and practitioners, that they might diligently study the subtlety and ascend to immortality.

On the day of the Beginning of Spring, at midday, the great and lofty spirits assembled the Immortals at the Supreme Palace of the Great Ultimate, fixing the jade slips, golden tablets, and purple script, recording the names of the immortals, inscribing them upon the mysterious grid, arranging the characters in the quadrants. On this day, the officials of heaven, earth, and water, the true spirits of the Five Mountains, and the great gods of the Four Seas all rode in jade carriages of eight scenes, with five-coloured cloud carriages, guided by vermilion phoenixes, or mounted upon flying dragons. Immortal boys and jade maidens, numbering a hundred million, bore banners and flags, scattered flowers and burned incense, floating in the air as they moved, illuminating all the heavens, travelling the eight directions. Each held the register of the learning immortals, reviewing the Supreme Palace of the Great Ultimate, verifying merits and demerits, correcting and simplifying good and evil. They were raised by the Three Officers and protected by the Five Emperors; the names were recorded on the jade slips, engraved upon the Supreme Palace of the Great Ultimate, and decreed to all spirits. The Right Division was the welcoming host. Those who violated prohibitions had their crimes entered into the nine offices; punishments were witnessed by the Three Officers; the Four Directors executed them; the Five Emperors corrected them; all were erased from the registers, delivered to the ghost officials; good and evil were immediately judged. For three days the assembly deliberated; the heavens, sun, moon, and stars, and all spirits below, none did not stand in solemnity.

The students of the Way would on this day bathe and fast, enter the chamber at midday, expose their bodies at midnight, face north and bow twice, knocking their heads and striking cheeks nine times, confessing their misdeeds and hidden faults since learning the truth, offenses difficult to forgive, unpardonable sins, beseeching pardon. They endeavoured to make their hearts void and their intent profound, inside and out utterly empty, without concealment, begging to explain, to extract the seven mysteries, the obscure souls to ascend, their bodies to fly as immortals. When finished, they clicked their teeth nine times and softly uttered the spell:

"North Profound High True, Great Immortal of the Great Ultimate, Profound Void ten thousandfold, Spiritual Transformation a thousandfold, Auspicious day and good hour, assembly of high dawn, three luminaries darkly united, eight breaths spread and arranged, four directors open verification, five emperors fix immortality, beseech to remove past faults, erase the root of sin, record names in the nine heavens, inscribe the spirit pavilion, scatter the seven ancestors, look up to enjoy profound grace, all wishes carved in assembly, none not fulfilled."

When finished, they donned the talisman of the Great Ultimate to refine transformation, fix true spiritual life, and swallowed the nine passes upwards. If one practises this Way for eight years, the jade name will be inscribed upon the slips in the Supreme View of the Great Ultimate, becoming among the immortals of the Great Ultimate, able to fly and ascend to the Supreme Clarity.

On the day of the Spring Equinox, at midday, the True Person of the Jade Terrace of Kunlun, named Tai Su, assembled the officials of the immortals upon the Jade Terrace, selecting and fixing the true scriptures and the achievements of the scholars. On this day, the officials of heaven, earth, and water, the true spirits of the Five Mountains and Four Directions, the great gods of the immortals, all came riding cloud chariots and feathered canopies, with twelve flying dragons. Immortal boys and jade maidens scattered flowers and burned incense, bearing flowery banners, floating in the air, surveying the eight directions, ascending to the Jade Terrace, registering the merits and failings of the scholarsâ€™ cultivation and scriptures, selecting and conferring to the Supreme Worthies. For three days the assembly deliberated; the heavens, sun, moon, stars, and all spirits below, none did not stand in solemnity. The students of the Way on this day fasted and purified themselves, entered the chamber at midday, exposed their bodies at midnight, burned incense and recited scriptures, faced north and bowed twice, knocking heads and striking cheeks nine times, confessing and thanking for the faults committed since learning the Way, those violating prohibitions, neglecting heavenly principles, disclosing secrets lightly and leaking heavenly patterns, beseeching pardon. Further begging for release from guilt and fault, extending to the seven ancestors for examination and punishment, extracting the obscure souls, removing them from the three suffering realms and five pains, the wandering souls ascending, their bodies attaining immortality. When finished, they clicked their teeth nine times and softly uttered the spell:

"Supreme True Tai Su, High Immortal Great Spirit, today I report, auspicious clouds encircle, banquet scene on the Jade Terrace, assembly complete at the Purple Court, registers and verifications, fallen guilt engraved, fixed by the Five Emperors, Eastern Flower recording names, Dao accords with supreme wishes, I present the wondrous scripture, ten thousand times awaiting the summons, hoping for divine grace, Jade Emperor opens pardon, all directed to fix, transform scenes and change bones, fly and ascend to Supreme Clarity."

When finished, they donned the talisman of Tai Su of the Jade Terrace to communicate true transformation and immortal treasure, swallowing the nine passes upwards. If one practises this Way for eight years, the Tai Su True Person will descend to the chamber, revealing divine form, able to ascend and fly to the Jade Terrace and the Supreme Palace of the Jade Terrace.

On the day of the Beginning of Summer, at midday, the Five Emperors assembled the immortals at the Purple Tenuity Palace, listing the Four True Persons of the Great Ultimate, verifying the records of the studentsâ€™ merits and faults. On this day, the celestial officials in charge, the river and sea water emperors, and the divine spirits of the Five Mountains all rode cloud carriages, feather canopies, flying dragons, and vermilion phoenixes. Immortal boys and jade maidens burned incense and scattered flowers, floating in the air, bearing flowery banners and five-coloured flowing bells, all assembled solemnly. They ascended the Purple Tenuity Palace, listing the studentsâ€™ merits and faults, verifying the registers. For three days the assembly deliberated, distinguishing good and evil. At this time, the heavens, sun, moon, and five planets, and all spirits on earth, none did not stand in solemnity. The students were to fast and purify themselves on this day, enter the chamber at midday, expose their bodies at midnight, face north, remove their kerchiefs, bow twice, knocking heads and striking cheeks nine times, first thanking for the faults committed since learning, those violating prohibitions, offending lightly and disrespectfully, harboring malice, disloyalty and unfilial conduct, jealousy and harm, distrustful faults; all beseeching pardon. The seven mysteries examined the souls, extracting and liberating from the three suffering realms and five hardships, departing from shadowy servitude, ascending to the hall of blessing, desiring the help of gods and immortals to fly to Supreme Clarity. When finished, they clicked their teeth nine times and softly uttered the blessing:

"The five breaths return to spirit, the perfect truth shines brightly; the four extremes oversee and reflect, universally informing myriad spirits; inspecting the Three Officers, registering merits and progress; diligent ones are recorded, none of their goodness lost; the Three Luminaries adorn, the Five Emperors refine the essence, transforming scenes and changing bones, looking up to enjoy the great spirit, aspiring to ascend as immortals; the body shelters the Purple Court, the mind aspires to the nine heavens, the written characters bear golden names, the lower wishes are boundless, the long heaven does not incline, the three wishes and nine unions, none fail to succeed."

When finished, they donned the talisman of the Purple Tenuity Spiritual Capital, clicked their teeth nine times, swallowed upwards, and ceased. If one practises this Way for eight years, the Five Emperors will descend to the chamber, confer true spirit, disperse sins and gather blessings, and fly to ascend Supreme Clarity.

The Eight Seasonal Assemblies are the celestial morning meetings, days of great true celebrations. At these times, myriad spirits assemble for deliberation; the great saints of heaven, the great heavenly true worthies, wondrous acting true persons, and the sun, moon, stars, Five Mountains, Five Emperors, river and sea gods, hundreds of millions, none fail to gather simultaneously, assembling solemnly for three days of celebration and deliberation. They calculate the heavenly truths, distinguish good and evil, record merits and faults, classify diligence and neglect, listing all in the nine heavens, each supervised by the three palaces and nine offices, the Officer of Fate and the upper bureau, recording all from great to small, light to heavy, all without omission. Students of the Way on this day fast and purify themselves, first thanking for offenses committed, burning incense and reciting scriptures, earnestly meditating on the spells and precepts, thus moving the divine spirits. Assisted by the Four Directors and the Five Emperors, their records are preserved and entered into the jade register, enabling divine beings to descend, soaring by day. Those who cultivate the Way without knowledge of these great celestial celebration days, the times of assembly and deliberation of the supreme sage, without knowing the method of first confessing faults, how can their past examinations be resolved? How can their crimes be removed? Thus the seven ancestors long remain in hell, and what hope is there for flying immortals? The two halves of spring and autumn divide the heavenly judgments of life and death and crimes, determining the true views and testing the myriad immortals on these days. On such days, one must not lose heart nor be obscure, but concentrate on diligent meditation, preserving existence in the Way, the body not treading wrong, but especially not recklessly neglecting cultivation, first confessing their offenses. Once the oath is fixed, the Heavenly Origin engraves the slips; if one does not offend from beginning to end, the upper immortals may await. But if one offends again, the officials will reject them; the Heavenly Origin will no longer accept their first confession. The Way of Immortality is remote; the body becomes a lowly ghost; such is the manifestation of guilt and blessing from this single day. Students should be cautious and act accordingly.

Those who cultivate the supreme Way, contemplating spirit and preserving truth, the void and transformation, the forms and scenes of the four seasons, seek the essentials of flying immortals, yet do not know to practise repentance, confession, chanting of spells, removing sins and fixing life through true methods. The divine truth is remote and invisible; thoughts and hopes are slight, the achievement difficult to expect. On these days, repenting and confessing sins, none fail to be dispersed, none fail to be protected. The words of the spells, once uttered, cause response. Thus meditating on spirit, within ten years one will behold the true spirits; the seven ancestors will be long freed from the three burning hells and obscure souls, return their forms to undergo transformation in the southern immortals, the body having no hindrance will soar and fly, relying on the empty skies to roam and glide. This is the supreme Way of the Primordial Heavenly Worthy, secreted above the nine heavens in the palace of the Great Having, following the clear and true grades and ranks, passed down once in myriad kalpas, lightly revealing the spiritual characters, lest calamity reach the seven mysteries, the body having no hope for immortality.

The above is the Eight Pathways of Spiritual Truth, Transformation and Void, the Hidden Jade Scene Talismans, taken from the Supreme Jade Chapters, serving to aid the divine scriptures. They should be written on coloured silk and worn on the body for eight years, thereby obtaining true persons to remove blame and surely attain the upper immortals. All who act on the Way preserve thought and aspire to truth, hope to fly and ascend, disperse and remove crime registers, and have their names recorded on the golden slips, all should wear talismans and follow the prescribed acts. Those who do not obtain these texts will not have their sins removed; the divine truth will directly remove them; their ascent to immortality is very distant. Those who obtain them will ascend to heaven by day; this is truly transformation and void.
