Supreme Mystery of the Cavernous Profundity: The True Text of the Spirit-Treasure, Essential Explanation, Upper Scripture

Received by the Great Master Gao Xuan

The Supreme Spirit-Treasure governs the Profound Capital of the Jade Capital Mountain on the Seven Treasures Mysterious Terrace; the Most True Ones of the Ten Directions proceed naturally in marvelous conduct; the Flying Immortals and Great Saints all float in the air, burning incense and scattering flowers, circling one day thrice around. Holding the ten perfect flower banners in hand, they recite the Cavernous Chapters. As sun and moon revolve, the seven stars govern the gates; in three hundred and thirty days, the Heaven’s gate returns a degree in the mountain; three hundred and thirty degrees complete the nine heavens’ atmospheric conjunction; three thousand three hundred degrees unite heaven and earth’s qi. The union of heaven and earth’s qi is the lesser kalpa; nine thousand nine hundred degrees complete the great kalpa cycle. At this time heaven sinks and earth is swallowed; the nine seas become one; gold and jade dissolve and vanish; the mighty end without remainder. The reason heaven and earth endure and do not fall is that the Primordial commanded the Five Elders, the Supreme True Ones, to seal the Spirit-Treasure’s True Text in the caverns of the Five Mountains, to calm the spirits and pacify the numinous, to govern the river of fate’s source, to restrain the flooding springs from bursting forth, and to prevent great calamities from advancing. This text is of natural origin, whence called the Spirit-Treasure Scroll of the Nine Heavens above, unknown to ghosts and gods. If the world possess this text, then the nation is secured and the household peaceful; ten thousand disasters do not strike. To learn its method, at the time of the great kalpa’s completion, one flies with expansive wings high aloft, treading the flying heaven and floating in the air. The ancient method issues once every forty thousand kalpas, bestowing golden names for past lives, inscribed on slips for future births, destined to be True Ones.

The Supreme Primordial Spirit-Treasure’s Five Scrolls of True Texts were formerly kept in the Supreme Mysterious Terrace’s Seven Treasures Upper Palace. The Heavenly Scriptures are profound and mysterious, not to be sought in detail; their words shine brilliantly, clearly reflecting the Supreme Purity. The Five Elders attend and guard; the Supreme Emperor reveres the True; Jade Maidens hold their scarves; Golden Boys wave incense smoke; burning the hundred blended perfumes, their fragrance flows through the Purple Court. Exhaling sun essence to dispel filth, scattering moonlight to brush away dust. The divine lamps brightly illuminate, their candles shining in concert; gold winds blow from eight directions; auspicious clouds array in four formations; phoenix and luan lament and cry; dragons and poisonous beasts guard the Jade Gate. Myriad Emperors bow their heads, circling the Upper Palace; flying in the void, stepping in emptiness; chanting and reciting the Cavernous Chapters. They praise the spiritual mysteries of the Nine Heavens, rejoice in the treasures of the Three Heavens, truly the profound text’s wondrous weight, whose merits tower in the great void. Hence the Primordial Records contain twelve virtues, to exalt the treasure in celestial truth and mark the difficulty of the spiritual text’s ultimate reach.

First, its virtue is like emptiness and nothingness, pure, clear, profound and silent, tranquil and natural, the root of heaven and earth.  
Second, its virtue is like the great Way, vast and formless, the source of spirit and brightness; all things universally receive its accomplishment.  
Third, its virtue is like heaven, clear, empty, vast and covering, high and floating in the Supreme Purity; all things universally receive generation from it.  
Fourth, its virtue is like earth, opening and nurturing life, embracing without distinction; all things receive its abundant support.  
Fifth, its virtue is like sun and moon, light shining clearly, penetrating all darkness; all things receive its gentle favour.  
Sixth, its virtue is like the myriad stars, shining on the heavens, spreading light into the depths; all things universally receive radiance.  
Seventh, its virtue is like clouds and rain, harmonising heaven and moistening earth, flowing far and wide; all things universally receive its beneficent showers.  
Eighth, its virtue is like the four seasons, turning the wheels of yin and yang, regulating the solar terms with peace; all things universally receive nurture and life.  
Ninth, its virtue is like Mount Tai, embracing, restraining, mighty and spiritual; the Five Emperors dwell in peace, the abode of immortals.  
Tenth, its virtue is like the great rivers, soft and flowing, blessing the hundred directions; it does not reject the impure or lowly; no detail is left uncontained.  
Eleventh, its virtue is like the True Teaching, guiding the three vehicles, enduring continuously; opening wide the gates of the Law, universally aiding all people.  
Twelfth, its virtue is like the Divine Person, saving the dying and protecting life, causing cold ashes to rise in smoke, manifesting the profound teaching, universally ferrying the heavenly folk.  

The spiritual text is wondrous and weighty, issuing from the natural; thus its supreme virtue is marked to exalt its truth. The five Spirit-Treasure texts are all roots of heaven and earth, transforming and producing the Five Elders; they govern the Five Planets above and the Five Mountains below; they move and direct the Five Elements; they connect with the five viscera of man; they calm the qi and nourish the spirit; they secure the nation and pacify the household; they cause the sovereigns to prosper; ten thousand disasters do not advance, the great waves do not surge. Once the spiritual text appears, heaven is preserved long. The will of the Primordial is subtle and profound. Now therefore I inform you, secret and unrevealed; diligently recite it, and the Way will of itself respond.

The Supreme Great Dao Lord said: To bind fate by the Way, unbroken through generations, that good fortune may come in the next life, one must practise the twelve supreme vows, universally ferrying all; bringing national peace, household prosperity, flourishing descendants; the seven ancestors ascend to heaven, revolving the wheel of the blessed hall. This merit is lofty and weighty; be diligent in cultivation.

First, one shall vow that the Great Dao be tranquil, empty and void, composed and solitary, clear and self-possessed; opening wide the gates of the Law; teaching the stubborn men, all may receive benefit and understanding; diligent and earnest in practice, inviting all to learn together, universally attaining ascent to the void, in harmony with heaven, enduring without care; all sentient beings equally at peace.  
Second, one shall vow that the various heavens’ qi be clear, high, empty, vast and covering; preserving the true and firm spirit; climate and seasons regulated; four movements peaceful; the nation secure, the people prosperous; all under heaven at leisure and peace; widely aiding all, benefiting all living things; preserving the kalpa for eternity, countless eons unshaken.  
Third, one shall vow that the earth’s soil be vast and bearing without limit; peaceful and stable without collapse; seas sinking not, mountains not falling; securing and pacifying the nation; the myriad people flourishing; nourishing life and securing death; benefiting all directions; grains planted and growing; increasing births and abundance; containing virtue and ample support; all wishes fulfilled.  
Fourth, one shall vow that the two luminaries, sun and moon, be bright and clear; without eclipse or diminution; peacefully shining over the heavens; penetrating and dispelling darkness and obscurity; preserving the kalpa’s course; the world’s reign peaceful; universally adding beneficence and moisture; watering all beings.  
Fifth, one shall vow that the stars shine with the sun and moon together; revolving and shining; illuminating the ten directions; each securely in place; the warp and woof straight and true; securing and pacifying the nation; no calamity or disaster; the four seas peaceful and united; all under heaven flourishing.  
Sixth, one shall vow that the four seasons follow the cycles; their qi harmonious and regulated; no disasters; epidemics and poisons destroyed; all under heaven safe and sound; the five grains abundant; the nation wealthy and the people joyful.  
Seventh, one shall vow that floating clouds gather qi and smoke; flying high and clear in the void; shading and covering the profound; hidden, they are non-action; dispersed, they fill the heavens; immortals ride together; gathering the many true ones; beneficent flow to all; prospering the nation and loving the people; universally ferrying the multitudes; people sharing the kalpa’s years.  
Eighth, one shall vow that wind and rain flow and pour without end; universally distributing and pouring forth; receiving their expansion; all things growing; the nation’s granaries full and the people prosperous.  
Ninth, one shall vow that the Five Mountains each hold their place; lofty and embracing; long lasting as immortal palaces; securing and pacifying the nation’s reign; preserving heaven without end; protecting and ferrying all; none failing to look up in reverence.  
Tenth, one shall vow that the rivers and seas be vast and boundless; embracing and expanding; no detail not multiplied; deep and profound, soft and beneficent; moistening all moving breaths; heaven and man rejoicing; years equal to the kalpa stones.  
Eleventh, one shall vow that the sovereign and territory daily flourish; the four garrisons peaceful and secure; war and arms not raised; the heavenly folk singing; auspicious signs bringing blessings; widely teaching and aiding; majestic transformation abundant; multitudes praising and rejoicing; long happiness without end.  
Twelfth, one shall vow that all creeping, flying, creeping things already born or unborn, all fully receive perfection; universally attaining generation; all filled with primordial qi; receiving the form of yang; plants, trees, and fruit-bearing forests; so that in winter they do not perish; all universally aided and ferried; nothing not fresh and flourishing.  

These twelve great vows formerly arise in the Primordial Five Scrolls of Wisdom Scripture. The great compassion of the Spirit-Treasure Way bestows blessings and plants seeds of good fortune; for men to bind causes, its merit is vast and its rewards hard to measure. This felicity is the highest enterprise; merit moves the heavens. Those who see this method should immediately conform to nature, diligently apply their hearts and cultivate, and in life and death obtain immortality.

The Supreme Great Dao Lord said: I in former days received this from the Primordial Heavenly King, and was charged to teach the Immortal Lords, Immortal Kings, Immortal Ministers, Supreme Purity True Men, but not to transmit to the Middle Immortal. Since there was no Mysterious Chart Imperial Document, named Supreme Purity, I could neither see nor hear it. Free from mortal ignorance and arrogance and not diligent in practice. The forbidden books of the Nine Heavens are transmitted once in forty thousand kalpas.

Those who cultivate and study and do not walk this method, merit is not established; their thoughts do not penetrate and respond; true spirit does not descend; they are cut off from good affinities; the path of blessing is already deviated; how can immortality be obtained? The supreme student should constantly fast and abstain, burn incense, perform morning rites and ceremonies, then face east and enact vows; mind and mouth harmonised, no different thoughts; so may one summon the profound True Ones from emptiness and non-being; sitting, to seek spiritual blessings from nature; to rescue the seven ancestors from the dark prison; to raise the poor souls to the Southern Palace; to protect the household and nation in times of adversity; to avert heavenly calamities in peaceful years. This blessing is lofty and weighty, difficult to fully declare.

Thus is recited the Spirit-Treasure Natural Five Scrolls of Protective Spirit Incantations:

**East**

Nine qi of the green heaven, bright star great god. Illuminating the eastern land, clearly reflecting the nine gates. Turning the candle to raise light, sweeping away filth and dust. The Enlightened Child opens, fully guarding my pavilion. Capturing demons and binding Xian, facing the imperial lord above. Serving the true Way, red scripts and jade texts. The nine heavens’ talismanic decrees, overseeing the Dragon Post station. Universal heaven secure and pacified, I obtain the flying immortals.

**South**

Southern cinnabar heaven, three qi flowing light. The fiery star turns the candle, clearly shining on the sun. Above is the Red Essence, the Enlightened Spirit Child opens. Commanding the fire soldiers, fully guarding the three palaces. Cutting evil and binding Xian, cutting off demons and misfortune ahead. Northern Emperor’s charge, wind and fire eight charges. Flowing bells intertwining brightness, who dares not obey? The true Way flows; I enjoy supreme merit. Protecting heaven to endure, countless kalpas without end.

**West**

Seven qi heaven, Venus flowing essence. Shining on the Golden Gate, clearly illuminating Great Darkness. Within is the White Emperor, called the Spirit Emperor. Protecting spirits and securing the body form. Severing evil sources, the jade Way is truly bright. Palaces tidy and solemn, three luminaries aligned. The Way harmonises with nature, ascending the Purple Court. Spirit-Treasure’s talismanic decrees universally benefit all beings. Merit adds to all; heaven and earth all peaceful.

**North**

Northern Mysterious Heaven, five qi wandering. The star of the Dragon shines brilliantly, illuminating Great Subtlety. Black Spirit honoured deity, flying the mysterious feather robe. Fully guarding the five gates, testing essence and capturing error. Who dares to interfere? Cut down, fall and destroy. The jade talisman reports, the spirit True Eight Might. Evil gates closed; true Way clearly open. Illuminating my body; three lights shine together. Commanding the void, riding the floating; raising the form, immortal flying.

**Center**

Yellow Center governing qi, commanding the profound True. Guarding stars and emitting radiance, flowing brightness through the nine heavens. The Enlightened Child opens, twelve persons. Primordial qi and yang essence, ablaze with vermilion smoke. Clearly illuminating all under heaven and my ministers’ bodies. Hundreds of evils crushed, killing thousands of ghosts. The Central Mountain spirit incantation universally commands. The Five Spirits secure and guard; body flies to the upper immortal.

The Supreme Great Dao Lord said: These natural five scrolls of Protective Spirit Incantations formerly issued in the upper scroll of the Spirit-Treasure Five Texts. They govern demons and summon spirits; command the many gods; secure and pacify the Five Mountains; protect heaven enduring long; illuminate the reason of the three lights; bring national peace; the myriad people enjoy blessings; ferry and aid all beings. I formerly received this from the Primordial Heavenly King, charged me to transmit it by the mysterious method once in forty thousand kalpas. You, in your place ascending to high immortality, commanding the Three Realms, rectifying and governing the many spirits, now I inform you. Choose your persons; they must conform to the Mysterious Chart, transmit according to method. Whoever desires to cultivate the Way, seek immortality and attain truth, secure the nation and pacify the household, cut off all inauspiciousness, shall reverently perform the natural Protective Spirit Incantations. Constantly on one’s destiny, Tai Sui, Jiazi, Gengshen and on days of fasting, always face east and recite once. Then the spirits will be bright and the qi correct; the palace and dwelling purified; evil demons destroyed; the Five Elders descend as True Ones; myriad trials subdued; misfortune and disaster perish; long fasting and recitation will achieve True Ones.

The Supreme Great Dao Lord said to the Great Master Gao Xuan: Those who enter my Way-gate aspire first to be immortals, soaring to the flowered azure. Next, they wish family and nation peace, to cross over myriad sufferings, to dispel calamities and extinguish misfortunes, to petition blessings and seek grace. First, they must cultivate the Spirit-Treasure Natural Five Scrolls; fast eight times repenting sins; confess to the ten directions. Above, they resolve heavy offences of past lifetimes; rescue from evil affinities; below, they resolve their own accumulated faults and crimes. Diligently practise fasts and uprightness; widely build fields of blessings; save and ferry all; pity the dying and protect life; when merit is accomplished and virtue widespread, then the Way-heart is united; evil destroyed; good affinities come forth. The household is orderly; all wishes fulfilled. Spirits and True Ones mysteriously descend; sitting, one attains flying immortality. This is the root of governance and the source of seeking the Way. Without this method, study is in vain; the old root is not untied; the hope of the Way is dim; to old age no attainment; troubles are not avoided. The Great Dao is broadly compassionate; pity is in the heart. Now therefore I inform you; be diligent in cultivation. I formerly received this from the Primordial Heavenly King, and was charged to keep it secret in the Spirit Capital Upper Hall; issued once in forty thousand kalpas. Now you shall follow the former teacher’s method. If there be supreme learners, named in gold slips, whose conduct accords with immortals, you shall transmit it to them.

The Way says: On the fasting day, burn incense, face east and say:

I now burn incense, returning my body, spirit and destiny to the East, Infinite Supreme Spirit-Treasure Heavenly Venerable. I now reverently thank the Nine Qi of the Azure Heaven of the East, the Supreme Purity Mysterious Origin Upper Three Heavens Infinite Great Way, the Supreme Old Lord, the Supreme Elder, the Heavenly Emperor Lord, the Heavenly Emperor Elder, the Supreme Emperor Lord, the Supreme Emperor Elder, the Thirty-nine True Ones, the Seventy-two Saints, Gao Xuan True Lord, the Nine Elder Immortal Capital Lord, the Nine Qi Elder, the Primordial Green True East Flower Jade Treasure Gao Morning Grand Marshal, the Prime Minister Green Youth Lord, the Primordial Nine Mysterious Principal Immortal True Men, boundless numbers, hundreds of millions of layers of Dao qi, twelve hundred official lords, Supreme Purity Jade Majesty, Green Emperor Nine Qi Jade Gate Immortal, Four Director True Men, the Supreme Ultimate Highest Saint Great Gods of the Heavens, the Eastern Land Infinite World Immortals True and Real. I beseech forgiveness for my seven ancestors since past lives, down to myself and my accumulated faults; killing and harming the worthy; primal rebellion and ugliness; acts not of man; lust and theft; spoiling others’ success; separating kin; depriving others of their reverence; filial impiety; unfaithfulness as subject; rebellion against ruler; attacking teachers and ancestors; disrespect to heaven and earth above; no fear of ghosts and spirits below; slandering the great Way; leaking the spirit text; mouth saying one thing, heart another; surpassing myself and envying the able; slighting the four great elements; defiling the three lights; evil speech and double tongues; slandering good men. Such sins intertwine through lifetimes, firmly bound and not untied, accumulating into hills and mountains. I pray now to burn incense and walk the Way, confessing to the mysterious True, unbinding past fetters, rejoicing with seven ancestors, abandoning the five ways, rescuing from the eight hardships, releasing the poor souls; ascending to the hall of blessings; my whole household without other; all under heaven receiving grace; the nation peaceful; the four seas flourishing; the emperor joyous; nation wealthy and people abundant; blessing all beings; all under grace of the Way. Now I bind my body and return my destiny to the Spirit-Treasure Heavenly Venerable. Grant me to fulfill my wishes; ascend to upper immortality; rise into formlessness; unite with the Way.

I beseech forgiveness as above for my seven ancestors from past lives down to myself. The rest as above.

Complete, nine kowtows and strikes on cheeks.

Having performed this ten-directional confession and apology, then proceed according to the ancient regulations. This is the root of learning the Way; above it frees the seven ancestors from their past bonds; below it removes the faults and evil sins of the body’s conduct. When all faults are dispersed, the spirits themselves protect. When the spirits descend, the heavenly folk return their hearts. Merit and virtue widely accrue; blessings and protection are without end; universally ferrying all; protecting and saving all beings. This method is wondrous and weighty; difficult to fully declare.

The Way says: Those who wish to cultivate goodness and build merit, widely sow blessings and fields, shall fast and confess sins for the heavenly folk; release life and light lamps; rescue and ferry past sins; release worldly nets; the heavenly folk receive grace. When the Spirit-Treasure True Text is complete, then the Eastern Flower Upper Chamber Green Youth Lord sings the harmonising soul-invoking song; those who gain these recitations have heavenly spirit protection; many demons perish nearby; the spirit is clear and bright; remembrance is easily moved. Those who have the scripture, treasure and keep it secret; do not spread it rashly.

The Eastern Flower Upper Chamber Spirit Consort sings:

Purple cassia grows in the jade garden; vermilion flowers sound chattering. The Moon Palace births medicinal depths; at midday, there is a jade pool. Left draws the round spiritual radiance; right pulls the cinnabar glow. Flowing gold shines in the scarlet court; eight scenic views surpass smoke and clouds. Green canopies float in the bright sky; feather joints command the supreme subtle. Phoenix essence youth face, smooth and plump fills great hunger. Controlling dawn, drawing from the supreme element, riding swiftly, soaring jade steps. Exhaling and inhaling six spiritual embryos; jade consort holding the scarf follows. Strumming the southern cloud fan; incense wind drums the brocade robe. Knocking on the Shang note, all beasts dance; six heavens capture divine might. Swiftly, countless springs; life spans supreme and lofty. Little fish not yet cooked in the cauldron, speak of my grief beneath the rock.

The Great Lord Green Youth, with the Supreme Void True Man, Western City Supreme True Man, Lesser Possession True King, gathering on the Jade Terrace, gazing upon the ten directions, mourning the myriad lives, longing for the world’s paths, knowing not the Jade Morning assembly, sighing and reciting; each composing a verse. On fasting days they read these, to summon the protection of the Four True Ones.

Great Lord Green Youth’s chant:

To cultivate the root of birth and death, one must rescue life and death’s planting. Musing and falling to the nine springs, but just sitting cherishing the body.

Supreme Void True Man’s chant:

Beholding the spirit bearing the form, like a cart led by horses. Cart broken, horses flee; entanglement is but temporary. Pity the world that knows not this; it only borrows wind and fire. Sowing sins on heaven’s net, receiving poisons in hell below.

Western City True Man Lord’s chant:

Spirit is the ferrying boat for form; mooring ashore, it must depart. Form is not spirit’s constant abode; spirit is not form’s constant vessel. Wandering in the wheel of birth and death; only the heart suffers hesitation.

Lesser Possession True Man Lord’s chant:

Losing the Way, following death’s ford; three souls lost, confused on life’s path. Life’s birth day already distant; death’s death day already early. Sad, miserable visage; root flower already overturned. Rising to the scattered seat; how can one know return to withered old age?

The Eastern Sea Green Youth Lord often on Ding days ascends the Eastern Flower Terrace, gazing over the ten directions. You may always on this day face the sun and bow twice. At sunrise undertake this; thus your wishes may be fulfilled; therefore to consume sun essence is best.

The Supreme Purity Great Dao Jade Morning Lord often on the fourth day of the first month, eighth of the second, fifteenth of the third, eighth of the fourth, ninth of the fifth, sixth of the sixth, seventh of the seventh, eighth of the eighth, ninth of the ninth, fifth of the tenth, third of the eleventh, twelfth of the twelfth, ascends the Jade Heaven Jade Chamber, looking over the world and ten directions; those with resolve and discipline, revolving and dwelling in purity, earnestly cultivating a devoted heart. The beginning of cultivation, not yet able to reach the summit by thought, desiring to refine past faults, on these days fast; at dawn, facing north, bow twice and pray; fully express yourself. Along with ritual instruction, advancing step by step in blessings; after bowing and prayers, consume the Jade Pond’s thirty-six passages; subtle and difficult to explore; be diligent.

Supreme Mystery of the Cavernous Profundity: The True Text of the Spirit-Treasure, Essential Explanation, Upper Scripture
