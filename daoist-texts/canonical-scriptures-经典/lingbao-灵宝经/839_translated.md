# The Scripture of the Left Immortal of the Supreme Ultimate Asking Questions  
(Including the Scripture of the Original Practice and Past Causes of the Supreme Mysterious and Spiritual Treasure of the Most High)

The title of the scripture is: The Scripture of the Left Immortal of the Supreme Ultimate Asking Questions. Its author is unknown; it is approximately from the Eastern Jin period. It is one among the ancient Scriptures of the Spiritual Treasure. The original consisted of two scrolls. At present, there exist two versions of the text. First, a manuscript from Dunhuang, No. S-1351, entitled "The Scripture of the Left Immortal of the Supreme Ultimate, Scroll One". Second, the version collected in the Taiping section of the Orthodox Daoist Canon, titled "The Scripture of the Original Practice and Past Causes of the Supreme Mysterious and Spiritual Treasure of the Most High", which by investigation should be the second scroll of the Scripture of the Left Immortal of the Supreme Ultimate. They are now united as one.

## Scroll One of the Scripture of the Left Immortal of the Supreme Ultimate Asking Questions

The Immortal respectfully kowtowed, and saluted the Most High Supreme Ultimate, the Most High and Lofty Old Master, the Unsurpassed Master of the Law, saying: "Concerning the method of good works and the practice of cultivation, and matters of discipline and so forth, I wish to hear your essential meaning."

The Master replied: "What you ask is of importance. To learn the Way and cultivate virtue, to perform good works is foremost. Then one should purify and fast, regulate the inhalation and exhalation of primal harmony, and draw upon the quintessence of the flowing rosy clouds and the fivefold splendour. To learn the Way without moving to cultivate good works and fast is also labouring in vain in the mountains and forests. Therefore, the upper chapter of the Scripture of Supreme Ultimate Wisdom says: 'To heal sickness and cure disease; to serve the master’s treasures; to establish quietude and build dwellings; to transcribe, proofread, and settle the scriptures; to observe fasts and meditate on the Way; to burn incense and light lamps; to recite for the salvation of all; to propagate transformation among the ignorant vulgar; to admonish in quietude and resolve malice; to bestow benefits on the poor and distressed; to rescue from calamity and difficulty; to protect life after the master’s passing; to establish wells at the borders; to plant orchards and groves; to teach and transform the unknowing; to encourage men to do good; to be virtuous for family and country; to be observable in movement and rest; to be exemplary in deeds; to be lawful in teaching and discipline.' This is called the conduct of Daoists.

When speaking to the ruler, one is beneficent to the state; to a father, one is kind to the children; to a teacher, one is loving to the multitude; to an elder brother, one is respectful in conduct; to a minister, one is loyal to the superior; to a son, one is filial to parents; to a friend, one is faithful in friendship; to a wife, one is chaste to the husband; to a husband, one is harmonious in the household; to a disciple, one is reverent in ritual; to the rustic, one is diligent in farming; to fellow Daoists, one remains within the Way; to foreigners, one maintains their domains; to slaves and servants, one is careful in affairs. Let heart and mouth correspond, the heart being the master of the mouth, the mouth the guest of the heart; the thought of the heart is then convenient.

Therefore it is said: 'When merit fills three thousand, one ascends to heaven by day; having cultivated good in abundance, one descends upon a cloud-chariot; to propagate the Way ceaselessly; thereby to attain immortality.' Those of good virtue are esteemed by the Most High, revered by the great saints of the heavens, their name is called following the customs of transformation, the great vehicle of accomplishment, which none but the superior men can bear.

The Most High Old Master said: 'In ancient times, the people were simple and pure, each cherishing the Way and virtue, with empty hearts and profound stillness. They acted by non-action. When this spirit dispersed, a hundred contending vapours arose, ten thousand currents separated, craft and cunning attacked one another, foolish and wise clashed, ghosts and spirits wielded authority, many saints appeared together, making rules and teachings only to cause the people to cultivate goodness and self-guard. Thus there arose five scriptures for Confucian and vulgar affairs; Daoist immortals each taught, their great return was to goodness. The words of immortals are also like those of the great Brahman and celestial beings; immortals are the speech of the supreme celestial beings of Mi-lo. The profound sect differs not; therefore it divides and transforms celestial beings, widely opens doors of law, so that all enter the hall of non-action together.'

The Most High Old Master said: 'The foremost of the Daoists is none other than fasting; there are many fasting methods, mostly similar in essence. The most weighty merit is only in the Most High Spiritual Treasure Fast. Yet in the world few are able to learn it. Those who learn it are all of the great vehicle, persons blessed by past accumulations, near to immortality. There is also the Three Heavens Fast, resembling the Spiritual Treasure. The Immortal said: The Three Heavens Fast is the law received from the Three Heavens Masters, called the Scripture of Essential Teachings. It is also secondary. This law is altogether contained in the Five Titles Texts, all fully recorded. But the heavenly books are profound and subtle, beyond the conception of worldly sages. Those who can thoroughly comprehend them are all the superior immortals and true ones, those identical with the Most High. Therefore, the middle immortals, earth immortals, and lower immortals do not understand their meaning. They see only, but do not know; what more can be said? Hence, all sages have the Song of Final Thought.

The Most High Old Master said: 'To purify by fasting and recite the scriptures, to cultivate virtue and establish conduct, the immortal Way will naturally form; why must one hide in mountains and forests? One desires to avoid desire; to remove filth and chaos; mountains and forests are not solely the abode of the Way. The major Daoist scriptures number no more than five thousand characters; the great chant of the Great Profound True One. This scripture is ethereal and remote; to recite it causes the great saint to send down cloud chariots and precious canopies, to gallop the dragon carriage and ascend to heaven by day. The five thousand characters are the ancestors of the Way and virtue, the truth of truths, not mixed with the base and impure, fit to be read in cycle from beginning to end. To expound the wondrous meaning, kings and lords govern well; to fast and recite it, the body attains flight as an immortal; the seven ancestors gain blessing, return to the embryo and receive form; above they are born in heaven, below in the houses of kings and lords among men. All require the secret formula of the perfected; the Way desires completion; it may be recited to call forth clouds and dragons. It must not be chanted in the human world; to chant it there, the great demon king will overthrow it. The chant of the Profound Mysterious Step into Emptiness is the highest pure and lofty intent; it cleanses and purifies profoundly; the most subtle and ultimate text, also fit for being read in cycle from beginning to end, with fasting and restraint. The perfected may be finished but not begun; he who begins it is the one who has attained the Way. Other scriptures each have their proper sequence and rank, beyond which one cannot pass. To surpass this requires courage, vigour, and great merit. The weak and degenerate dare not hear of it.'

The Most High Old Master said: 'Man who cultivates good with diligence, a compassionate heart touching all things, receives the great scriptures at home, worships with single-mindedness without slackening, will also surely attain extinction and liberation, obtain the Way of non-action, and ascend to immortality, born in the houses of kings and lords generation after generation; thus turning the wheel of the sacred kingship and finally entering the Way of true immortals.'

The Most High Old Master said: 'Each man’s root has causality; various conditions arise, all come according to their vows, not fulfilled without vow. The learning of the lesser vehicle differs from the great vehicle, not because the causality is more marvelous or profound. The Most High Master’s song says: "When you see a Daoist diligent and vigorous, sitting upright at the family gate, composing his heart to receive scriptures, reciting morning and night, thinking of the immortal Way; when you see a Daoist diligent and vigorous, attending an illustrious master, requesting scriptures, reciting morning and night, thinking of the immortal Way; when you see a Daoist diligent and vigorous, disdaining jewels and treasures, admiring the scriptures and laws, reciting morning and night, thinking of the immortal Way; when you see a sage diligent and vigorous, hidden in mountain forests, reciting scriptures, thinking of the immortal Way; when you see a sage diligent and vigorous, receiving scriptures from his master, worshipping at home, persevering morning and night, thinking of the immortal Way; when you see a sage diligent and vigorous, abandoning desire, leaving the chamber, sitting upright in a cavern, thinking of the immortal Way; when you see a sage diligent and vigorous, following the master with reverence, entering mountains and marshes, thinking of the immortal Way; when you see a sage diligent and vigorous, casting away splendour and glory, wandering afar seeking scriptures, requesting to receive and recite, thinking of the immortal Way; when you see a sage diligent and vigorous, loyal and filial, sitting peacefully in a lofty hall, splendid and noble, holding his heart unshaken, as if a mountain or forest, reciting scriptures, thinking of the immortal Way; when you see a sage diligent and vigorous, enduring hunger and cold to the bone, incessantly requesting scriptures, aspiring to the great vehicle, thinking of the immortal Way; when you see a sage born in noble gates, austere and lofty in talent, diligent and vigorous, single-heartedly reciting scriptures, thinking of the immortal Way; when you see a sage often afflicted by illness, diligent and vigorous, reciting scriptures day and night, thinking of the immortal Way;

When you see a sage diligent and vigorous, repeatedly suffering illness, requesting to receive the supreme scriptures, thinking of the immortal Way; when you see a woman diligent and vigorous, seeking to change her body to a man, reciting scriptures, thinking of the immortal Way; when you see a woman diligent and vigorous, sitting upright in a secluded chamber, reciting supreme scriptures, thinking of the immortal Way; when you see a woman diligent and vigorous, pressed to comply but refusing, with firm heart, thinking of the immortal Way; when you see a sage diligent and vigorous, whose parents differ, loving the scriptures and teachings, thinking of the immortal Way; when you see a sage diligent and vigorous, without cause to see scriptures, thinking of the immortal Way; when you see a sage diligent and vigorous, imprisoned, holding his heart day and night, thinking of the immortal Way; when you see a sage encountering hardship and evil, persevering without end, thinking of the immortal Way; when you see a sage diligent and vigorous, whose family all perish, sad at parting, seven days after death, fasting and confessing guilt, persevering day and night, thinking of the immortal Way; when you see a sage diligent and vigorous, whose master and friends have passed away, establishing fasting rites for them, thinking of the immortal Way; when you see a sage diligent and vigorous, lofty and profound, uplifting seven generations of parents, thinking of the immortal Way; when you see a sage diligent and vigorous, seeking peace in the world, thinking of the immortal Way. When a person has such causality, the Most High Daoist Eye has long before perceived it, therefore he sings their virtues to encourage their resolve."

The Immortal respectfully kowtowed, saying: "I will serve these words." At that time the celestial beings all arose to make obeisance and then departed.

## Scroll Two of the Scripture of the Left Immortal of the Supreme Ultimate Asking Questions

The Scripture of the Original Practice and Past Causes of the Supreme Mysterious and Spiritual Treasure of the Most High

The Immortal asked the Most High Master of the Supreme Ultimate: "What is the root practice of man, by which he sees the world, receives blessings, the family gate is upright, descendants flourish, with good causal connections unbroken generation after generation; upon death ascending to heaven above, being born below in the houses of kings and lords; intelligent, Confucian, benevolent, revering and believing in the scriptures and teachings; loving and delighting in mountains and forests; constantly reciting the subtle sayings; finally attaining the immortal Way?"

The Master answered: "Well said is your question. Each man’s life has its original practice, past causes, and root destiny; variously related, wish following wish; of like kind, accompanying kind; revolving and mutually generating; misfortune and blessing drawing each other. Therefore, generation after generation is unbroken, tastes differ, the mind varies. All are due to former vows. If one desires to cultivate the Way and bind causality with sages and saints, one should observe the great precepts, widely establish fields of blessing, and magnify the exertion of merit.

Some reach to flying immortality; some to celestial immortals; some to terrestrial immortals; some, at death, ascend to heaven above; some become ghosts and spirits; some become officers under the Great Demon Kings of the Six Heavens; some, at death, are born in the houses of kings and lords, the honored among men; some are relied upon by all, wealthy and powerful in the world; some attain talent, wisdom, and intelligence; some attain noble and dignified appearance, refined qi and fragrance; some attain benevolence, love, loyalty, filial piety, chastity, simplicity; some attain goodness in literature and writing, exemplary in movement and rest; some attain majesty and awe, admired by all; some are devoted to the Three Treasures, diligently offering; some delight in mountains and waters, quietly reading scriptures, burning incense and fasting; some perform ritual worship of the Profound Ancestor; some succeed in changing female to male, with graceful and refined appearance; some attain a pure and clear family gate, generation after generation cause and effect, in accord with original wishes; good and worthy talents become our descendants, safe and noble without limit; some see the world, receive blessings, and at death receive retribution; some later generations receive blessing, attaining our past merits.

What is the Way? It is to respond with no-mind. All beings of the four classes cultivate blessings and virtues, which require original vows. The retribution of blessings depends on vows made at the appointed time. When merit is established, and the vow determined, the retribution is vast, like waiting from dusk to dawn. The worldly people are shallow and unreliable, unbelieving of the words of the Law, each claiming themselves cunning, lightly disregarding fate and destiny, thinking it is false creation. They laugh at the supreme scriptures, deeming them vain, while greatly accumulating desire and greed, sitting to give and wait for retribution, hoping for speed but the response is slow. Thus the profound teaching becomes dull, the world’s Way is lost, heaven and man suffer destruction; all come from their own conduct and practice. The Most High is therefore pained in heart."

The Immortal said: "I have heard of past fate, causality, birth and death, retribution and reward. What then is the root practice and highest precepts?"

The Master answered: "The Most High Wisdom’s highest precepts, one hundred and eighty in all, are the supreme precepts and ordinances. To observe the Ten Precepts of the Most High is also to obtain this blessing. Now I shall explain them to you; are you willing to observe them?"

The Immortal respectfully made obeisance and said: "Certainly, the Heavenly Venerable, please transmit them; I will observe them."

The Master said: "The Ten Precepts are:  
1. Do not envy those superior, nor suppress the wise and bright.  
2. Do not drink wine or eat meat, defiling and disturbing the Three Palaces.  
3. Do not commit licentious acts upon others’ wives or daughters, nor be covetous or sly.  
4. Do not abandon the poor, the old, the sick, and the humble.  
5. Do not slander the good, nor disparage fellow students.  
6. Do not greedily hoard wealth, unwilling to give or scatter.  
7. Do not kill living beings, nor worship the Six Heavens’ ghosts and spirits.  
8. Do not speculate about the scriptures, deeming them vain and absurd.  
9. Do not betray the teacher’s love, nor deceive new teachings.  
10. Be equal-hearted, one-hearted in benevolence and filial piety towards all.

Whoever observes these Ten Precepts, clearly establishes vows, will surely receive retribution. If one sees the world doing evil without retribution, it is because the prior generation’s remaining blessings are not yet exhausted; when blessings are exhausted, misfortune comes. If one sees the world doing good without retribution, it is because the prior generation’s remaining calamities are not yet exhausted; when calamities are exhausted, blessings come — or retribution may be in later lives, not necessarily in this one. When one greatly establishes good works in the world, one must balance merit and fault, so as to avoid ancestral calamities. To give benefits expecting reward is no reward; yin and yang are certain. Those who would enter the immortal Way have merits as numerous as dust and sand; how could they fail to be joined?

There are ten evils not to be committed:  
1. Drinking wine and lust, desires without end.  
2. Secretly harming the world, slandering Daoists.  
3. Disdaining the teacher and Law, arrogant and neglectful of the Three Treasures.  
4. Stealing scriptures, falsely declaring Daoist essentials.  
5. Borrowing and not returning, deceiving the people.  
6. Killing for taste, mouth saying one thing, heart another.  
7. Betraying grace and violating righteousness, breaking precepts.  
8. Neglecting scripture recitation, chattering self-righteously.  
9. Blaming and expecting others' intentions, wrathful towards the four classes.  
10. Arbitrarily interpreting scripture meanings, altering sacred texts, disbelieving fate, acting on passion, defiling and disrespecting the Four Great Elements, neglecting the Way of birth.

These are the ten evil precepts. Those who violate them may be killed unjustly by ghosts and spirits, judged by officials in the underworld; safety becomes danger; doing good meets evil; events do not succeed. Or one dies entering hell, confined behind heavy bars, not seeing the Three Lights, tortured day and night, embracing copper pillars, walking on knife mountains, climbing sword trees, entering boiling cauldrons, swallowing fire and smoke, facing icy cold, suffering all the five torments as recorded. After hell, one must serve the Three Officials as a prisoner, punished in the mountains and seas with countless lashes. Afterwards, one is born again in the world, often as a lowly person. Or becomes a servant, having human form but lacking human feeling. Or is born in borderlands and foreign countries. Or is born with diseases and evils, evil begetting evil, good begetting good. The retribution of sin and merit is difficult to tell. The retribution of sin and merit is like the shadow following form, the wheel revolving as the wheel of a cart.

The Supreme Ultimate True Man then composed the Song of Observing Precepts, saying:

The Way is founded on no-mind, all acts are fields of blessing.  
Establishing merit has no fixed master, each vow depends on the person.  
Emptily responding to all beings, concentrating the mind without partiality.  
The great saint expands the highest teaching, like rain nourishing heaven.  
High hills are all encircled; always humble and solid, forming deep springs.  
The sea is king of a hundred rivers, able to abandon dragon scales.  
Preserving and regulating use through myriad kalpas, not merely in that year.  
Observing precepts without pause, generation after generation binding good causes.  
With earnest thought contemplating the great vehicle, one shall surely embody the true Way.

The Supreme Ultimate True Man further composed the Song of Violating Precepts, saying:

Man’s root comes from original vows, vows determine overcoming great calamities.  
Pure thoughts observe the Ten Precepts, thus able to transcend the eight hardships.  
Those who violated the profound teachings in past lives, how can they be safe in this life?  
Foolish and blind neglect life and destiny, sinful to the utmost, sighing long.  
Facing the future like a reflection, seeing it chills the heart.  
Born in lowly places, miserable without lasting joy.

The Immortal dared to ask: "The depth of fasting and the elevation of merit, the turning of ten evils and ten goods, the unceasing cycle, how are the ranks and degrees?"

The Master answered: "All these things, as said, are to be wholly emptied; having and not having mutually producing each other; cultivating virtue and nourishing the spirit; accumulating merit and condensing truth. The true body is emptiness, entering and exiting having and not having, hidden and still most subtle; preserving light and rare delicacy; helping and saving all, as a bridge for myriad laws. To revolve and learn the Way, none is prior to fasting. Fasting is none other than the Spiritual Treasure Fast. Its law is most profound, not to be declared to ordinary worldly people, but constantly transmitted to those with past merits and blessings. Those without past heavy connections must not see it; if encountered, they should not delight in it; all is according to original vows, therefore cannot be forcibly taught.

Since countless kalpas ago, immortal and saintly secret formulas have been transmitted, hidden and unrecorded. I was commanded by the Most High to bestow it upon the son of the Immortal, who wrote it well. This law greatly benefits all who seek the Way. Though kalpas revolve and fortunes turn, this scripture does not change. The Way flourishes in the world, virtue rises with transformation. Sages are hard to meet, the Way hard to see, scriptures hard to hear, the age of saints rare, the meeting of the worthy difficult. Therefore, none but those with good merits may attend these assemblies.

Formerly, when the Perfected One of the Orthodox Unity learned the Way, he received the Spiritual Treasure Fast; after attaining the Way, he said this fast is most revered, and composed the Five Titles Texts of the Spiritual Treasure, which include fasting methods, called the Scripture of Essential Teachings, mostly similar, also following the fasting methods of this scripture. The Great Unity Fast is more profound than this great fast, and is for beginners of the lesser vehicle. The Three Profound Scriptures of the Caves are for the great vehicle, who first save others then themselves. Sitting, rising, lying, breathing, always compassionate-hearted to all, all thoughts continually exerted without weariness; virtue equal to the Most High; Way surpassing the Void Sovereign; grace filling the ten directions; in accord with the profound true; leading the celestial beings; wishing to reach the origin of the Way.

To learn the Way, one should always purify clothing, ceremoniously burn incense, place high incense, hold the scriptures on the seat. Worship with earnest thought, preserve truth, regulate inhalation and exhalation to nourish spirit; repent and thank seven generations of parents and present and past heavy sins and evil causes; give alms and establish merit; long fast in quietude; fix one’s original vow. Then let the heart be empty and the intention profound; only then can the true Way be accomplished. Properly prepare headcloths, rough cloth and simple skirts; reading scriptures, wearing prescribed garments; do not borrow impure persons or wear unclean places. These are called the Law Garments; the Law Garments always have three divine children attending them. Formerly a worthy man welcomed a Daoist; the Daoist could not go immediately, but came clad in rough cloth. When he reached the house, the man reverently burned incense and worshipped as if seeing the Daoist. The divine children appeared in form and said: The Daoist sent me. The master did not know they were divine children. The master’s sickness was immediately cured, the household unharmed. The divine children said to the master: The sick one is healed; the Daoist will not trouble to return; the worthy man may return the Law Garments to the Daoist. The master did so. The Daoist inquired; the answer was: One day in pain, requesting the master to fast; the master was busy and sent only the immortal children, not personally attending the fast. The patient is now cured; the Law Garments are sent back. The Daoist was amazed and astonished; when finished, he said: I, a poor Daoist, arranged the ritual for one day, intending to go; the master allowed the worthy man to depart, and did not come again; thus I did not go. It was not for breach of trust, but there was no one to send; also I did not know your household was healed; this is all brought about by the master’s own heart. Asked about the form of the person sent, the master answered: About fifteen or sixteen years old, appearance dignified, like a scholar. The Daoist thought, I have no such disciple; I fear a spirit descended. Therefore, the Law Garments must be purified and properly made; otherwise, ghosts harm people, and the penalties are as clear as the statutes. If decayed or damaged, one must wear them oneself, not use them otherwise."

The Immortal said: "I have heard of the mighty spirit of the Law Garments. May I observe the Ten Precepts easily?"

The True Man answered: "I formerly received them from the Most High Great Way Lord; I observe them, generation after generation binding good causes; I am among the blessed, attaining the Way of immortality. Now I transmit them to you, remember them well. Formerly there were ordinary men who kept these precepts, thinking of the Way without fault, prolonging life and increasing years, their households flourishing. I wish later generations to be learned, intelligent in the scriptures, finally entering the Way of immortality, at the day of extinction directly ascending to the hall of blessing, clothing and food natural, joyful and contented. Later born in the world, studying the Great Way scriptures, intelligent and discerning, becoming masters of the world, all understanding clearly.

Also there are ordinary men who perform great merit in fasting and precepts, lighting lamps, offering to the Three Treasures, diligent without slackening, wishing to be born in the houses of kings and lords, to become noble people with dignified and majestic appearance. At the day of death, flying to meet them, directly ascending to heaven, clothing and food natural, joyful and effortless. Later born in the homes of princes and lords, noble sons, intelligent and wise, dignified and pure in appearance and fragrance.

Moreover, noble men governing with the Way, doing merit, fasting and precepts, bestowing benefits, lighting lamps in repentance, resolving the causes and knots of seven generations of parents, offering to the Three Treasures, wishing that later generations be noble, shifting fortunes, with graceful and pleasant appearance, clear and discerning talent, always meeting the wise, offering to the Three Treasures. At death flying to meet them, directly ascending to the hall of blessing, ineffable gladness. Later born in royal households, wealthier than before, intelligent and able, lofty and far-reaching, the people abundant and households secure.

Again, noble men performing such merit, wishing that later generations finally enter the Way of immortals. Later generations indeed love the Way and receive scriptures, reading all texts, immediately attaining immortality, flying by day. Also ordinary men performing such merit, wishing that later generations often see the Great Scriptures of the Three Caves. Later generations see the great scriptures, receive and recite them, respected throughout the three realms. Also ordinary men performing such merit, wishing to be advanced Daoists, mastering supreme scriptures. Later generations become Daoists, mastering the great scriptures, becoming masters of the laws. Also ordinary men performing such merit, wishing that later generations enter the mountains to learn the Way. Later generations dwell in mountains and rocks, diligently thinking and pondering the Way. Also women performing such merit, wishing to change their bodies to men; later born as men. Also sages performing such merit, assisting masters to manage scriptures, wishing that later generations encounter scriptures and the Way, fulfilling their wishes.

Also sages performing such merit, reciting scriptures, fasting and observing precepts, offering to the Three Treasures, single-heartedly thinking of the Way, wishing to repay the kindness of seven generations of parents’ causal connections, ascending to heaven, returning to the embryo among the houses of kings and lords; my body ascends to immortality, abiding in long stillness and non-action. I have observed those who bestow benefits and cultivate the Way; what they seek none fail to obtain; the essential is original vows. When vows are fixed, none is without retribution; its retribution is like the response of a reflection, the cycle of the four seasons. But sin and merit are not both retributed together; their difference is ordered; merits and faults are shifted; sometimes in future lives, sometimes in this world. Sin and merit depend on one’s original practice; it is not the frivolity of Daoist morals. Yet the people all desire immediate retribution as real; postponing to later lives, they call it without spirit. The ignorant man, driven by passion and desire, lightly neglects the heavenly net and meets the eight hardships, treads upon the ten sufferings. When this occurs, none understand the cause. Is this not sorrowful? Is this not sorrowful?

The human body is a borrowed vessel, born from darkness. When qi disperses, the person dies; spirit and truth each depart; the body also separates, becoming worms that eat the ashes and earth; becoming all manner of ghosts, receiving pain and poison unlike life. Is it not pitiful? Is it not pitiful? Only the Way body is true and always safe; the Way is attained by accumulating virtue and practicing good works, revolving the body and refining the spirit, thus finally perfecting the true body.

Again, there are ordinary men who see Daoists quietly fasting, lighting lamps and burning incense, worshipping and circling busily, then suddenly their Way heart arises, wishing to offer to the Three Treasures. Their family is poor, with no rare delicacies, offering a few stalks of vegetables to aid the middle meal. At that time their mind is: "May I be wealthy in future lives, able to greatly offer to the Three Treasures, widely extending fields of blessing." Having thus seen the world at peace and stability, with long life fulfilling heavenly mandate, at death entering hell to receive retribution, the Most High teaches: although the person may have small sins, their diligence and vigour in merit compensate faults. They are then allowed to ascend to the hall of blessing; later born in noble families; generation after generation gentlemen; blessings and fortune natural; delighting in the Way and virtue; offering to the Three Treasures; talent and knowledge profound.

There was also one who saw a true Daoist fasting quietly reading scriptures, and laughed, saying: 'He chants empty scriptures to the void; what does he hope for? Empty belly, one meal a day; this is a sinful man.' The Daoist compassionately admonished him, but he held fast to his opinion. That man after death went straight to hell, tortured with five sufferings; the jailers reproached him and said: 'In life you mocked Daoists and defamed the Three Treasures; now you suffer accordingly; your later birth will be among the lowly poor people.'

Again, there was one, dignified in appearance, who also outwardly studied the worldly scriptures, understood Daoist books, and declared: 'This seems to be the vain talk of ancients; I seek Daoists and nobles, playing all day; what do I hope for?' That man was immediately killed by evil ghosts in this life, prematurely perishing by heavenly mandate. After death he entered hell, suffering all torments; later reborn stupid and ignorant, not among human relations.

Again, there are Daoists who lightly treat the Law, falsely proclaim, disrespect the treasured scriptures; in this life they are killed by examining ghosts, sinking into deep hell; later born with disease; their sufferings are difficult to tell. Therefore the scriptures must not be disclosed lightly, lest they be misused and cause mutual harm. Also, to be a teacher is not easy; to instruct disciples improperly, sin is mutual. The human heart is hard to fathom, all greedy and covetous. Therefore the sages left the Law, relying on faith and efficacy; saints transmit from saint to saint, never saying one must believe. The foolish transmit among themselves, and faith is incomplete. Can you be not careful?

To learn the Way, one should first be loyal and filial, do good deeds and observe precepts, be compassionate to all, serve the master with reverence and solemnity, regulate inhalation and exhalation to nourish spirit, deeply receive the great scriptures, reverently worship the masters as venerating sages; fast quietly and recite scriptures, bestow benefits on the needy, encourage others in goodness; then take medicine to benefit, inhale and exhale in harmony; fasting and precepts have response; recitation of scriptures brings true descent; demon hosts submit and obey; who would dare to test and harm? Thus one must attain the Way.

The scriptures on morality and the heavens, as well as the scriptures of the Perfected True Ones and the Profound Mysteries, the writings of the Three Sovereigns of Heaven, the numerous hymns of the Upper Clarity and so forth, all are composed by the Most High Void Sovereign and the many true ones, the natural true immortals of the ten directions, and the hidden positions of the imperial lords, as well as the great saints of the heavens and the palaces and towers of the celestial worlds, mountains and seas, ponds and pools; or they are the Spiritual Observatories of the Most High, natural precious palaces, together with the sun, moon, stars, walled cities and gate inscriptions; or the secret and taboo words of the officers under the great Demon Kings, the place of their palaces and chambers. The Most High composed these into writings; therefore they must not be slandered or falsely proclaimed. When fasting quietly and preparing ritual, focusing heart on the Way of truth, and reciting several verses, the words are splendid and respond in echo.

At this time the Most High Jade Capital of the Mysterious Metropolis, the eight directions of the heavens, the three thousand great thousand worlds, and the many saints and true men also arrived. The eastern side of Jade Capital Mountain is the Infinite Heavens of the Great Hall of Peaceful Abode, the many worlds of the great thousand embracing goodness saints; the southeast side is the Infinite Heavens of the Original Field of Blessing, the many worlds of the great thousand using worthy saints; the south side is the Infinite Heavens of Wanli City Realm, the great vehicle rejecting worthies saints; the southwest side is the Infinite Heavens of Yanfu Village, the many worlds of the great thousand of benevolent stillness saints; the west side is the Infinite Heavens of the Blessing Hall Prefecture, the many worlds of the great thousand of quiet conduct saints; the northwest side is the Infinite Heavens of the Field of Blessing and Virtue, the many worlds of the great thousand extending worthies saints; the north side is the Infinite Heavens of Yudan Field, the many worlds of the great thousand of pure stillness saints; the northeast side is the Infinite Heavens of the Blessing Gathering Capital, the many worlds of the great thousand of Chang’an saints. The Most High Jade Capital Mountain of the Void and Mysterious Metropolis, the Infinite Heavens of the Eight Directions, the worlds and positions of the great saints and true men, are all contained therein.

The sayings of the scripture resemble worldly books; yet these are not the common words of the world. They all expound the profound truth, serene and natural, revealing the Most High Lofty Heavenly Venerable; the principle is rare and subtle, cleansing turbidity and purifying the spirit, abiding through years and kalpas, thereby achieving ascension to immortality, abiding in infinity, the seven ancestors born in heaven. This scripture is profound and subtle beyond all. Take heed. The Way is utmost abyss; the Way’s body is emptiness. Its propagation is by men.

The Three Treasures are: the Dao Treasure of the Most High, the Scripture Treasure, and the Master Treasure; these are the Three Treasures. The Three Venerables are: the Dao Venerable Most High, the Scripture Venerable, and the Master Venerable; these are the Three Venerables. Within the human body there are called the Three Venerables; within the body are three palaces. The Most One Emperor Lord, the Prince, and the Nameless Hero—these are the Three-in-One Venerable. The scriptures speak of the Seven Ancestors and Parents, born in heaven above, disentangling knots and dissolving stagnations; some return to the embryo in the houses of kings and lords among men; my body ascends to immortality, always preserving the root of blessing. These are the retributions of the seven generations of parents’ causal connections. My body cuts off attachment, severs the original womb, and with reverence forms vows. The seven generations of parents are born above in heaven and below among kings and lords; this is the great way of filial piety, the essential meaning of the Profound Scriptures. The perfected one’s body refining exceeds the Great Yin, governing ten months only. Yet it also requires but an instant to hide and still the embryo. When one dwells in the embryo, it is not yet base. When man is in the womb, he remembers past fate matters; once born, he immediately forgets. Only those attaining the Way and perfected true know naturally. Therefore the words to the world are to cause them to cultivate good deeds, making a ferry for future lives.

The word immortal means to transition; from the common to the sacred gradually. The true means firmness, no corruption or ruin. One proceeds from immortal cultivation to become a perfected true man. Thus immortals have ranks, perfected true men have grades. The six heavens are the three realms; the great Demon King leads the affairs of the six heaven ghosts and spirits; the Demon King serves the Most High Numerous True Heavenly Venerables and Masters. When the Daoist’s merit is complete, the Demon King recommends him. When about to be perfected, the Demon King tests him, discerning the correct and incorrect. The Daoist’s Demon King superior is the Most High scripture; therefore the Demon King’s position governs ghosts and spirits, all resulting from ancestral merits; likewise for the many saints.

To learn the Way, one should know the former masters. My master is the Most High Jade Morning Great Dao Void Sovereign, the supreme of the Way. I am the sixth disciple of the master; the great saints are all disciples of the master. The number of disciples is countless. My master’s name is Bo Yue Zong, styled Wei Na He. I now tell you; keep it secret. The names of perfected true men are also hard to fathom; many are hidden words. My name is Xu Lai Le, styled Hong Yuan Fu. To learn the Way without a master, fasting and reciting have no response. If one falsely proclaims without faith, one incurs the sin of the Three Officials. The three realms of hell, six heavens, the northern emperor and great Demon King’s domain lie in the Great North Sea, north of heaven and earth, on Luo Ye Mountain, two thousand six hundred li high, circling thirty thousand li, with palaces of seven treasures inside and outside; also a flourishing capital, the place of origin for all ghosts and spirits of the world. Now, by these heavenly palace names revealed, those who can curse and recite them, evil ghosts dare not approach; demons and evils are subdued and destroyed; disasters do not invade; souls and spirits are pure and correct; the spiritual bridge always endures.

My master said: I learn the Way, cultivate fasting, read scriptures, establish merit, help beings, serve masters with reverence and diligence, through countless kalpas and years. Sometimes born in royal families; sometimes born in noble houses; sometimes born as lowly people; sometimes born among the heavens; sometimes born among Demon Kings; sometimes falling again into hell; suffering the Three Officials’ punishments, enduring ten hardships and eight calamities, persisting in aspiration without fault; revolving the wheel to seek the Way; often laughed at by the world; also not speaking; silently encouraging myself; firmly holding integrity daily; the practice grows new; in all matters following the scriptures. At first not daring to doubt, truly meeting the sacred writings; thus attaining the superior immortals, body like vajra, true body entering mystery, rare and profound substance, enjoying eternal and boundless life. This is due to my dedication, gentleness, compassion and love, tireless in receiving scriptures; not by natural attainment.

To occupy the Way at home, one should build a refined dwelling, a quiet fast, establish seats for discourse, hold and recite the scriptures. The meditation bed is five feet square and similarly high. Always burn incense; lamps never cease; no profane persons admitted. Law garments may not be carelessly lent; all scriptures must be received from masters, proofread and settled; hold the rituals; be joyful and reverent as before the Most High. Do not be arrogant, mock, or discuss worldly fame and profit. Whoever violates this, the attending immortal children of the scriptures immediately report to the Three Heavens’ supervisors. The Three Heavens’ supervisors report to the Most High. After three reports to the Most High, you will surely lose the scriptures. Ghosts and spirits disturb the examination; fearing to die by this, how can immortality be had? If scriptures are not received from masters, there are no divine protections; practice will not succeed; the immortal children attending the scriptures always examine people; calamity involves seven generations of parents. To receive the Way without revering and keeping the master, the Three Officials’ records will cause ghosts to harm violently.

One who receives scriptures with impurity and arrogance, not pure and quiet, shall surely be slandered, after death entering hell, finally born among the six beasts. Scriptures not washed with fragrant water are soiled, causing souls and spirits to scatter, caught by other ghosts. If one has not yet begun to proclaim scriptures, but hastily divulged them, the seven ancestors are imprisoned in hell, the body undergoing three evil examinations. Even if transmission is proper, if not the proper person, the sin is the same. Daoists who wish to dwell in mountains and secluded places should first receive scriptures, respectfully serve masters, cultivate good works to appease mountain spirits. Mountains, big or small, all have gods and spirits; the bigger the mountain, the greater the god; the smaller, the lesser. If mountain spirits harm people, they will not be established either. Those who do not understand the supreme law, not knowing cultivating good and establishing merit, how can they long dwell in the mountains? Waters also have spirits; the eight seas have kings of spirits residing. Rivers, lakes, and waterways all have spirits. Also dragon kings and ghosts govern their clear pools. The river officers and water officials each have palaces and temples, also of seven treasures and bronze chimes, all like the palaces in the middle of Dengdu, subordinate to the immortals’ lower palaces. Depending on one’s life and practice, the depth of industry, the size of merits, one is reckoned and receives present retribution. In future lives, one shall be reborn human, receiving retribution according to conduct; never failing. Heaven, earth, water, and the Three Officials record a person’s merits and faults, good and evil, nothing is omitted.

Formerly there was a noble who faithfully believed in the Daoist teaching, offered to the Three Treasures, managed and wrote scriptures, established quiet dwellings. When about to be perfected, the noble fell seriously ill; disciples came to greet him; medicine intended to treat was bitter and harsh. The noble said: 'I have for a while reverently observed precepts; dare I forget them? Also gave alms to the poor, offered to the Three Treasures, built quiet dwellings; does the Most High not know this? Life and death are not to be refused. What I regret now is that I have not personally held fast to fasting and precepts, read scriptures, lit lamps on the Way, thanked for seven generations of errors and debts. For my future birth, to make a bridge. I am ill and distressed, about to end my days. Medicine can cure madness and fever; how can it affect my fate?'

Then the Most High observed those of ten directions, good and evil people, and ordered the Fate Office to prolong this person’s life by thirty years. Then suddenly he was healed; body sound as before sickness. Formerly he was about to depart, diligence daily renewed; cultivating fast and observing precepts, practicing many good deeds, offering to the Three Treasures, bringing generation after generation wealth and honour; good men born in his family, turning the wheel to attain the Way. This man is now the Most High East Flower Immortal King. Is not this teaching of accumulated goodness for the people thus? Is it not so?
