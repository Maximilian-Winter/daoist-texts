# Scripture of the Inquiry of the Perfected One of the Great Ultimate concerning Meritorious Deeds and Conduct (Dunhuang Manuscript)

The Scripture is named: Scripture of the Inquiry of the Perfected One of the Great Ultimate concerning Meritorious Deeds and Conduct. The compiler is unknown. It is roughly dated to the period of the Northern and Southern Dynasties. The text and wording closely resemble those of the ancient Lingbao Scriptures, such as the Scripture of the Inquiry by the Left Immortal of the Great Ultimate. It is comprised of one scroll. It is not included in the Zhengtong Daozang. The original source is the Dunhuang manuscript no. S.425.

The Perfected One of the Great Ultimate, the True Man of the Great Void, asked the Exalted Laozi: "In former times, to uphold the sacred teaching, men and women were exhorted to diligently cultivate meritorious deeds and conduct. But I do not clearly understand what is meant by meritorious deeds and conduct." The Exalted Laozi replied: "To exert strength and diligence in practice is called merit; when the merit extends to things it is called virtue; to perform all good deeds in the body is called conduct; and to regard these as affairs is called industry. These four form the unity of myriad practices and the record of manifold virtues. All the honored deities of the Ten Directions who have attained the Way do diligently practice to the utmost fruition."

The True Man said: "Meritorious deeds, virtue, conduct, and industry—are these of one kind, or are there distinctions of excellence and inferiority?" Laozi said: "There are also distinctions of excellence and inferiority." The True Man said: "Which are the excellent, and which are the inferior?" Laozi said: "Those who aspire to learn the Great Vehicle, putting others before themselves, these are excellent. Those who observe trifling precepts and live only to themselves, these are inferior."

The True Man said: "Among things, is there also ascent and descent, not crooked or crooked?" Laozi said: "There is also ascent and descent." The True Man said: "What is ascent, and what is descent?" Laozi said: "Such as rescuing people from death and calamity, relieving poverty, administering medicine to save life, bearing the toil and hardship of others, nourishing the aged and sick, sharing the worries of others—this is the highest of the highest. If one pardons prisoners, liberates lives, bestows alms upon the poor, the aged, sick, and prisoners, clothes and feeds birds, beasts, insects, and fishes, frees servants and the lowly, and enters the Way by leaving home—this is the higher middle. If one repairs roads, erects boats and bridges, plants orchards and groves, builds houses and digs wells, applies oars and fire, seeks to extricate the perilous and difficult, supports mountain-dwelling Daoists and sages, attends to Daoist ministers, holds scriptures and precepts, offers fasting and clothing—this is the middle and lower. If one establishes temples, builds altars, leads others to place images, makes places for future appearances and refuge, exhorts men and women to awaken the heart of the Way, binds thoughts with sincerity, advances goodness and restrains evil—this is the middle upper. If one carves images of the honored Heavenly Worthies and True Ones, of Immortals, Sages, Holy Ones, the various heavenly emperors, vajra kings, immortal boys and jade maidens, incense officials and messengers, dragon and tiger lords, in gold, silver, copper, iron, pearls, jade, embroidery and painting, carved sandalwood and engraved stone, clay and plain lacquer, placing them according to their capacity in various places to cause the multitudes to take refuge—this is middle middle. If one transcribes and carefully arranges the scriptures of the Three Caverns, keeps them in the residences of permanence, circulating them among men and mountains, arranging their storage and presentation, lecturing and unfolding the teachings, maintaining them eternally—this is middle lower. If one builds halls and pavilions, chambers and houses, seats and spreads flowers, bright banners and canopies, incense, minerals, tables and cases, bells, chimes, and ritual implements, supporting the Heavenly Worthies, and adorns the scriptures and rites in order, full and bright—this is lower upper. If one offers incense and oils, adorns fields and gardens, servants, mills, steps, carriages, horses, vessels and garments, ritual robes and implements, incense, minerals, bathing and watering, wish-fulfilling seats and fly-whisks, ropes, beds, sitting cushions, footwear, sundry vessels, entering the permanent residences to support the Heavenly Worthies and all Daoists—this is lower middle. If one offers seeds, millet, wheat, broad beans, rice, cucumbers, fruits, vegetables, and also fine silks and brocades, gold, silver, pearls, and jade to supply the necessities of the Three Treasures, this is the lowest of the low. From these nine grades one may roughly discern that all depend on the heart, on the sincerity and earnestness of the elixir-like mind."

The True Man said: "As to the highest of the high, rescuing people and saving life, are there gradations even among these?" Laozi said: "Among the highest there are those who long ago planted good works, whose fruition is complete and sufficient in itself, seeking not from others. Those of the middle grade do their deeds and conduct to self-support, also not relying on others, each able to establish himself. But those of the lowest grade bear heavy burdens from their ancestors; though they repay their human form, manifold sufferings gather and torment them; they cannot free themselves and must be rescued by others. Their merits are equal and without gradation; only the lightness or weight of the mind at the moment of inception differs."

The True Man said: "As to the higher middle and lower grades, among birds, beasts, insects, and fishes, is there difference of rank?" Laozi said: "In ancient times one often rescued several drowned or sinking creatures, and through compassion moved Heaven; Zhang Ba revived several famished tigers, and the earth official praised such goodness. Thus though great and small differ, their lives are equal. If you but have a compassionate heart and true sincerity, and truly respond to creatures and conditions, then good echoes will be heard in Heaven, and merit inscribed in the registers of blessing. How could this be separated by the greatness or smallness of insects or fishes, or the size of birds and beasts? The reason that men establish merit and accumulate virtue is to observe their intent and refine their heart. If the heart be elixir-like and the mind profound, wisdom bright and clear, penetrating the principles, forgetting both self and thing, uniting form and spirit, pure within and without, equal near and far, tranquil yet unperturbed, with environment and wisdom alike extinguished, all false thoughts dismissed, all vexations removed, the true source will arise spontaneously—what need is there then for any practices? But if the mirror of the heart be dim, or the nature of the Way unclear, with self and other cherished, right and wrong unresolved, vexations and false thoughts, conduct and rest confused and hasty, though merit be established and virtue accumulated, the true Way remains yet apart. The great ones forget merit, the middling accumulate virtue, the small diligently practice; each depends on their conditions and opportunities, and cannot be universally judged. You should take heed of this."

Thereupon the Perfected One of the Great Ultimate, the True Man of the Great Void, bowed his head and praised the words, rejoicing and departed.

Thus ends the Scripture of the Inquiry of the Perfected One of the Great Ultimate concerning Meritorious Deeds and Conduct.
