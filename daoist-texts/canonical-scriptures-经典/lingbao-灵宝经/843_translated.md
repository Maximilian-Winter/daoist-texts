# Preface to the Many Chapters of the Supreme Cavernous Mysterious Spiritual Treasure (Dunhuang Edition)

Title of the Scripture: Preface to the Many Chapters of the Supreme Cavernous Mysterious Spiritual Treasure. The compiler is unknown; it is roughly dated to the Southern and Northern Dynasties. It is a compilation and adaptation from three ancient versions of the Spiritual Treasure Scripture. The original was in one scroll; it is not included in the "Orthodox Daoist Canon". The base text is from the Dunhuang fragment S.6659. Collated editions include Dunhuang P.2386 and Kyoto manuscript No. 253.

(Front portion missing)

When the years do not age, the countenance is grand and beautiful, the essence bright and luminous. At nineteen years, birds hunt the six kinds of beasts; conception is enclosed within, both born and unborn; all obtain birth and nurture, without injury or harm. At twenty, women conceive and carry in their wombs; throughout the world, male children are born. At twenty-one, the earth’s storehouse opens and flows forth; forms of gold and jade dew scatter everywhere along the paths, without place to hide. At twenty-two, heaven shakes and earth rends; dry bones revive; sunken corpses and flying spirits arise; all universally become adults; the whole world sings in rejoicing, peace and prosperity abound. At twenty-three, the earth gives birth to lotus flowers; heaven and men acclaim the celebration; none are not joyous. At twenty-four, the Five Great Mountains open their caverns; talismanic scriptures emerge together, instructing heaven and men; at that time, learners all become Immortals in flight. To these twenty-four responses, the highest praises are given to the Spiritual Garden of the Primal Origin, rejoicing in the enlightenment of the Five Elders; the spiritual writings are now invigorated, and the Way is thereby carried out.

Heaven and earth unfold; the orthodox law flourishes; divine winds spread afar; myriad swallows fly across the ford; the Five Emperors assist and support, urging on the celestial immortals; commanding divine officials; guiding the movement of yin and yang; firmly fixing the Three Luminaries to the Mysterious Root; preserving heaven and earth for everlasting existence; guarding the Five Mountains in the Spiritual Pavilion; regulating kalpa cycles at the Three Passes; establishing national fortunes in accord with the design; directing the Five Qi to nurture the people; broadly manifesting the Heavenly Origin; universally teaching the Ten Directions; the majesty and spirit expand greatly, with no place dark or idle; the divine wonders are majestic and grand, difficult to be described.

At that time, the Most Holy Supreme Great Way Lord, the Most High Jade Emperor, and the Perfects of the Ten Directions all rode upon five-coloured jade wheels and brilliant carriages of lapis lazuli; the nine-coloured mysterious dragon, the ten unsurpassed feathered canopies, and three pure drifting clouds. The great saints of the heavens and wondrous conduct true men all rode the blue mist of the nine-luminous flowing clouds, ascending on jade platforms. At the auspicious four gatherings, three dawns emitted fragrance; flying incense played eight melodies; streaming lightning raised beacon fires; floral essence poured upon the sun; the Three Luminaries combined brightness; divine radiance shone resplendently, flowing and glancing towards the Great Void.

Following the Five Emperors and Divine Immortals, the thousand Perfects of the Mulberry Grove, the lion, white crane, tiger, leopard, dragon scales; the spiritual consorts scattered blossoms; golden youths waved incense smoke; the Five Paths opened the way; the Three Realms communicated across the ford; wandering upon the cloud roads, tenfold commands were issued.

The Most High ascended to the Supreme Clear and Great Mysterious Jade Capital, the Cold Spiritual Elixir Hall, the Purple Tenuity Upper Palace; there established the Heavenly Treasure Feathered Robe; then proceeded to the Primal Origin Heavenly Venerable’s Golden Pavilion, and requested to receive the "Primal Origin Spiritual Treasure Red Script Five Chapters of True Text". Thereupon the Heavenly Venerable commanded the assembly of Perfects to enter the Grand Void Golden Terrace Jade Treasure Hall, the Nine Radiant Chambers. Spiritual boys and jade maidens served as guards on either side, numbering ninety million. Flying dragons and venomous beasts guarded the eight gates; rushing there to strike swords, long fangs struck bells; divine tigers roared upward; lion dwellings thundered; qilin rites and phoenix songs resounded; whistles and chants were prolonged and harmonious. The Heavenly Scales sounded their banners and canopies; the jade voices stirred the cloud court.

The Most Holy Five Great Supreme Great Way Lords bowed their heads and spoke: "We humbly hear that the Primal Origin has changed the course, the mysterious image unfolds the plan; the spiritual writings are luxuriant and elegant, the divine manifestation covers the five directions. Heaven and earth take it to divide and determine; the Three Luminaries follow it to enlighten. This is the great ancestral enterprise; may it be briefly disclosed in the spiritual treasury?

Your servant, having passed beyond the Before-Heaven, in the midst of the great kalpa, has planted truth in the palace of the Nine Spirits; received the fluid at the five crystal gates; borne the embryo of mysterious conception; perceived the yang in the soul of dim responses; raised my head in the great void; stepped forth upon the long ford; shone forth in the Three Assemblies; washed in the billows of the upper mystery; flowed through the capital of dim splendour; fixed my will amidst the eight circles; reverently received the office of enlightenment; humbly received the ancestral master of mystery. I pity all living beings and lament the course of change. The imperial Way is already clear; truth is also fitting to be carried out. My private mind is earnestly desirous to cause the cloud court to extend to the eight quarters; the wind to scatter in the orchid grove; the cold boughs to look upward, hoping for the flourishing of Huayang; the decayed bones to receive the ford of the spirit gates. I do not know if the Spiritual Treasure Five Chapters of Jade Text can be seen and granted as teaching to those yet unhearing?"

The Primal Origin Heavenly Venerable then gathered his true thoughts afar, bent low to the mechanism on high, and commanded the summoning of the Five Emperors. He discussed and settled yin and yang, computed the numbers of the proud assemblies, shifted and rectified the river sources, examined and recorded the degrees of heaven, chose the seeds of men, took hold of the Great Void, shouted forth the nine mysteries, and forever ceased listening to old words, then closed the gate on the search for truth.

The Supreme Great Way Lord unceasingly opened his mouth; the Primal Origin, after long time, lowered his gaze in pity and sighed: "How subtle and profound! That which you now knock upon, is it not far? This is the mysterious root of the Primal Origin, the text of void and nature; it preserves the kalpa cycles according to the heavenly mechanism; it guards the five spirits to establish truth. Now the three heavens regulate the cycles; the six heavens practise the Way; mixed doctrines open and enlighten. There will be sixteen thousand kinds of ways to choose the hearts of those who come. When this law’s course is complete, after the three dragons, in the year of Gengzi, all mixed darkness will universally vanish, and our true Way will be carried out. For now, it may be entrusted to you, to be recorded in the upper pavilion, and not yet carried out in the lower world, instructing those who begin to learn. The mysteries have prohibitions, and may not be lightly transmitted. You yourself may go to the Spiritual Capital Purple Tenuity Upper Palace, observe the heavenly sounds in the golden frame, take the rising and falling from the Divine King. Afterwards, you must complete the heavenly charts to govern the Primal Origin’s heaven."

Thus the Supreme Great Way Lord and the assembly of Perfects retired to seclusion for three months, went to the Spiritual Capital Purple Tenuity Palace, and received the rising and falling charts. Thus they knew the heavenly truth to be precious and difficult to hear; then went again to the Primal Origin Heavenly Venerable, asked about the rites of prohibition, humbly declined for lack of ability. The heavenly face pitied and instructed; the spirit gates opened wide; the five elders of the highest truth ascended, unveiling the nine radiances and eight colours of essence, a cloud brocade pouch; they produced the Primal Origin Red Script Five Chapters of True Text Spiritual Treasure Supreme Scripture, and entrusted it to the Supreme Great Way Lord, the Most High Jade Emperor, the Perfects of the Ten Directions, the great saints of the heavens, and the true men of wondrous conduct, commanding them to follow the mysterious rules; as the six heavens’ qi dissipates, to record the law and transmit it.

## Chapter Two of the Three Origins Scripture on Precepts, Questions on Difficulties, Sins and Blessings

The Dao Lord respectfully bowed and dared to ask the Heavenly Venerable: "How are merit and virtue weighed in weight and measure? How are deliverance and ranks graduated? Which is first in order? Ancestors of earlier generations bear burdens, responsible for stopping at the self, responsible for passing to descendants. If one’s own body commits evil, the body itself receives the retribution; the higher misleads the prior deceased. Nowadays, the people’s sons and daughters are born into the world, receiving suffering and punishment, enduring all hardships, unable to liberate themselves. Also we see the dead’s forms and spirits distressed, wandering through three paths of five sufferings; the long river and cold court; the knife of wind and myriad sorrows; unable to escape. The scriptures say sometimes that the evil done by oneself before causes calamity to descendants; sometimes say that heavy sins of oneself mislead prior deceased; sometimes say good and evil each have their destined counterpart, birth and death, sins and blessings each have their root of fate. Thus, if retribution for good and evil is matched, it should all return to the one body, and should not cause delay or extension. It is also said: if not by virtue and merit can one deliver the souls of prior generations, then there is no way to release them. When merit and virtue are established, then birth and death open and prosper. But if all have counterparts, then the evil doer, having died, will sink long in myriad sufferings, in dark and lengthy nights. How then can he still establish great merit to deliver and redeem himself? If descendants build merit for the deceased, then it is the same as delay; the principle is not different. My foolish and shallow mind cannot understand. Since the Heavenly Venerable has opened the great mercy’s transformation, birth and death universally illuminated, it should make clear the distinctions of the hidden and manifest, not allowing the ignorance of fools to waver between two opinions. Having been ordered to take office, and assigned responsibility to govern, I should proclaim the orthodox law, open and reveal the next life; may the Dharma sound flow through the heavens for myriad kalpas without ceasing; the orthodox one endure; birth and death be blessed; the great mercy be manifest. For these reasons I humbly petition the Heavenly Venerable to cast down pity."

The Heavenly Venerable, fearful and joyful, replied: "Excellent, excellent! Your question touches the depths. Though you have penetrated the spiritual market, the hidden source is not yet exhausted. Though you have viewed the great mercy, the Dragon and River (Milky Way) is difficult to illumine. Qi is boundless; numbers are hard to exhaust; death returns to life; darkness returns to light. Heaven and earth revolve as the wheel of a carriage; man is immortal as the shadow follows form; thus it is hard to end. Swallows succeed one another; various causes for life; good and evil, blessing and woe, each have their root of fate. Not heaven, not earth, nor man; it all depends on the heart. The heart is spirit; form is not mine to possess. That which gives me life comes from the void and nature; depending on causes and conditions, receiving transformations and giving birth. I receive my form from father and mother, who are not my true first parents; the true parents are not here. Father and mother’s love is heavy, esteemed beyond all. The father and mother now who give birth are those on whom I depend for causes and conditions; I receive their nurturing and care; thus I repay with propriety and call them father and mother. Therefore, the form I receive is not truly my form. I lodge it as a house; depend on it as a dwelling, to shelter myself. I attach to it as form, thus showing existence and non-existence. Therefore the one who attains the Way has no longer form. When I have no body, what have I to fear? What causes affliction is that I have a floating body. With body, a hundred evils arise; without body, one enters nature; establishing conduct to accord with the Way, body and spirit become one. When body and spirit are united, that is the true body, returning to the first-born parents, and attaining the Way; no further affliction, never dying. Even if extinguished, the spirit goes on and the form is not dust. The whole life returns to its root, never departing from it. The body violates a hundred evils; the sin is completed and it is called death. Death is destruction and dissolution, returning to the foster parents. The sin’s cause is not exhausted; it cannot return to the true parents. The spirit fills the conscripts, forming dust; dust flies and scatters, becoming the vapor. The spirit and vapor separate; thus spirit and vapor transform, unite and become one, and obtain rebirth, again becoming man. Form and spirit follow one another, never departing. Thus good and evil, body and counterpart, how can the fault be of prior deceased or later descendants?"

Before the Dragon and River, until the Red Brightness, old writings say birth and death are each due to one body; neither extending upwards nor flowing downwards; blessing and sin end with one; each bears it in the body. After Red Brightness, until the Supreme Emperor, men’s hearts are broken; men and women are impure; jealousy, hatred, stillness, and rivalry all contend and harm one another; hearts are not firm; ancestors are invoked above, children below, for oaths and pledges; they appeal to the divine spirits but do not trust themselves; they break their vows; thus the Three Officials bind thinly; bodies perish under ghostly officials; higher mislead prior deceased; lower flow to descendants; calamities come; great and small drag one another; throughout heaven no release; misfortune befalls the clan. Such are the wicked men, seeking great calamity themselves. The law clearly states that release is never the same. The enlightened man accumulates conduct, taking it from his own body and not seeking from others. The clear old scriptures, are they not empty words?

The Heavenly Venerable again told the Supreme Dao Lord: "The great compassionate Way is to deliver men first; no merit, no reward; no virtue, no promotion; no faith, no deliverance; no conduct, no immortality. He who establishes merit and virtue, does so for heaven and earth, the Three Luminaries, the sovereign, the people, the ancestors, the households, all beings, and himself. The scripture says: ‘He who desires to deliver himself must first deliver others. If many cannot be delivered, one will not be delivered.’ The great compassion is broad and far-reaching, its kindness extends without limit; heaven and men rely upon it, much more so for the seven ancestors and parents. Can sin and blessing not be added together? Much less merit and virtue. Therefore, for those with cause and condition and grace, with sincere self-reproach, heaven turns to deliver; at the moment of arriving there is response; men and spirits open together; much more so for those receiving the foster qi and nurturing, being born and nourished. When compassion is deep, can one not greatly establish merit, to mutually open deliverance and repay exhausted souls? Since the time of the Dragon and River until Red Brightness, those who attain the Way and appear in blessings, their households are pure and noble; good causes bring forth new life; none are without accumulated merit, achievement, and heavenly response, resulting in mutual repayment. Those who were in the Nine Nether Long Night and suffered the blame of bodies, and yet obtained release, all did so by merit and virtue to redeem and deliver, returning to the human realm. The Nine Capitals of the Southern Hill and Vermilion Palace all have their names; the principle of retribution is divided without loss; year and month succeed each other, very clearly and distinctly."

The Dao Lord made obeisance and said: "Now having heard the Heavenly Venerable speak of the counterparts, merit, virtue, and retribution, all doubts are dispelled; the heart is fearful and the mind at ease, no longer lingering. I shall therefore diligently practice and proclaim the great law; universally show it to the people of the Infinite Worlds; sons and daughters, men and women; all to respect and understand, that all may see clearly."

The Supreme Dao Lord addressed the Heavenly Venerable: "Now that enlightenment is bestowed, and all doubts are resolved, I cannot fathom merit and virtue; which is first? I see the text of the true method, and the highest wisdom to redeem the root of sin; to finish thus, is there any remainder? The oath of redemption and the instruction to the ignorant; establishing quiet dwellings, offering and supporting the master’s treasure, trading incense and oil, lighting lamps to illuminate the night, hearts practising good thoughts, rescuing all beings, compassion, loyalty, and filial piety; distributing to the poor and needy; feeding and sweetening the myriad birds without sparing. Among these merits and virtues, is there weight and measure? Are they all equal, or of high and low, noble and base? I humbly pray for instruction."

The Heavenly Venerable said: "In all established merit and virtue, there is neither great nor small, high nor low; the merit is equal and floating. The weight and measure of retribution depend on the human heart. If the heart’s conduct is not lazy, though bitter and unyielding, this merit is hard to describe, and virtue hard to name. If there is only sincerity, but conduct is not dedicated, one may escape guilt but only that. Without heart and with superficial goodness, giving without gain is vain. The rich household treasures wealth, unwilling to scatter it; to redeem the root of sin, only pushing the heart and seeking great reward; this will be in vain and profitless. How can the heavenly Way demand men’s wealth, forcing them to do merit? Therefore it examines the stingy heart, tests the intent; if he has but does not scatter, what shall he seek? The poor who develop the heart, with firm and clear will, comfort the hard-working master’s door; labour is not shunned; the Way has already examined it. Such persons’ merit touches the heavens. Therefore giving wealth corresponds to the heart; pushing the heart corresponds to wealth; their merit is equal and floating. The ancients sought the heart; the latter age seeks wealth; ancients do not become immortal without the heart; latter age does not deliver without wealth. That is why merit is floating; the latter age values wealth and not the Way. With gold weighing ten thousand catties, and one volume of immortal scripture, given to the poor mountains, in the latter age people will covet the gold; is it that they covet the immortal scripture? Gold causes bodily affliction; immortal scripture causes long life; this is well known; only they cannot avoid stinginess and greed. Since they cannot avoid stinginess and greed, how can they be blamed by the Way? Therefore, it is not the Way that benefits men; this is what is said. The clear true method, highest wisdom, redeeming the root of sin, given to life and death; this law is very weighty. As for scholars whose bodies have not entered meditation and are amid the noisy dust, how can they avoid mistakes? Their actions and deeds are mixed with sin and blessing; therefore the Three Officials, Nine Courts, and One Hundred and Twenty Departments, with left and right yin and yang, water and fire examiners, all govern men’s gains and losses. Those who do good are listed in the left palace; those who do evil in the right palace; each by year, month, day, number, and closeness summoned and pressed; the light and heavy retribution is like the meeting of waves; the appointed time must come, without fail. But only by weight, measure, and closeness is it spoken. Therefore I now inform you, diligently proclaim and show, so that all men and women, the good and gentle, universally know that heaven and earth have responses that do not deceive; these words are true. Now I entrust to you the Three Origins method of repentance. The Primal Origin’s ancient Way text is secreted in the Three Origins Palace; ten thousand values, one action; not transmitted to the lower world. Those who hope for its chapters and titles, with previous roots may liberate themselves; binding may be undone; treasure and carry it; it must bring great blessing; lightly and carelessly it will bring disaster and destroy the clan. Let the heart be pure and the method deeply cautious." The Dao Lord, fearful and joyful, bowed and made obeisance. At that time all the heavens simultaneously acclaimed goodness.

## Natural Jade Characters of the Inner Sounds of the Spiritual Treasure Heavens, Third Section

The Primal Origin Heavenly Venerable, at that time with the Five Elders, the Highest Emperors, the Great Saints of the Ten Directions, the Perfects of Infinite Limit, and the Lords and Elders, all together in the Cypress Mound Pavilion of the Red Brightness World, seated in the incense garden beneath the long mulberry tree. The Heavenly Venerable returned to his chariot; the heavens descended their seats. At that time the clouds and mists were dense and vigorous; the four luminaries merged in darkness; three days and three nights; the mysterious yin did not dissolve; heaven and earth were without light, as before the Dragon and River, gloomy and dark.

The Five Elders the Highest Emperors advanced and made obeisance, addressing the Heavenly Venerable: "Today the seat is unlike any previously experienced. When the Heavenly Venerable goes out, all the heavens incline their chariots. The Highest Emperors, the high perfected, divine immortals, jade maidens, sun, moon, stars, the variegated jade scales, the officials of the Three Realms, the divine mountains of the Five Peaks, the river and sea water emperors, all the gods and spirits, none but are alert and solemn, attending the heavenly truth. On the day of floating, the sky is clear and bright; the wind does not shake the boughs; there is no flying dust on the earth; the rivers and seas are calm and silent; the mountains hide their smoke; the time is harmonious, warm and settled; birth and death alike fear; yet the heavenly brightness is closed; the daylight is shadowed; heaven and men are alarmed; the four seats are uneasy. I do not understand why; the cause is thus. I beg instruction, that all may see clearly, be abundantly benefited, and universally obtain safety."

The Heavenly Venerable said: "Today, gathered at one seat, fear and joy are hard to encounter. The heavens send auspicious signs; spiritual responses are natural; the jade palace shines brilliantly; the brilliance of heaven is displayed. The beginning of unobstructed light causes darkness like daytime; the joining of days and times; such has rarely been experienced. Now I shall universally open the wondrous auspices for the four assemblies; deliver all men; command all to close their eyes and prostrate. Then the great assembly simultaneously closed their eyes and bowed to listen.

In a moment, the dark sky was dispelled; the gloom and darkness vanished; five-coloured brightness illuminated, penetrating the five directions. Suddenly a heavenly book appeared; the characters were each one zhang square; naturally appearing above the mystery of the void in five-coloured light; the literary splendour brilliant and resplendent; eight corners hung rays; the essence light dazzled the eyes, impossible to gaze upon. The Heavenly Venerable universally asked the four seated assemblies: ‘The spiritual book of eight gatherings, characters without fixed form, their meaning profound and obscure, hard to search and explain; now that heaven has sent a response, the wondrous Way should be made clear; let us record its strokes and explain its true sounds, that the imperial Way may be clear and its benefits reach the ten directions.’"

The Heavenly Truth Imperial Men bowed and made obeisance, and said to the Heavenly Venerable: "Since following the course of birth and death, turning through myriad kalpas, having repeatedly served at the seat, never before have we encountered this holy Way; opening the doors of all laws, receiving the heavenly book, naturally most true. This eight-fold gathering of beams, combined with the five harmonies of sound, is not within the grasp of shallow thought or short reflection. Now since we have taken our seats, we look up to the profundity and marvel; being commanded in distress, we dare not conceal our feelings; forcibly shaking off our fears, if there were no divine guard, we would exhaust what we see; we shall interpret its sounds, hoping for a ten-thousandth part to accord, opening and revealing the nature of future births and the body yet to come, only seeking pity."

Then the brush was poised; the supreme truth swept the mat; the jade maidens held the cloth; golden youths waved incense; the moon palace scattered blossoms; sun essence observed the ford; the Five Elders supervised the test; the Three Realms guarded truth; they divided their degrees and portions. There are thirty-two heavens; each heaven has eight characters. The Great Yellow Sovereign Heaven of Ancients, the Great Bright Jade Complete Heaven, the Clear Brightness Youth Heaven, the Mysterious Embryo Balanced Nourishment Heaven, the Primordial Brightness Cultural Elevation Heaven, the Seven Luminaries Majestic Darkness Heaven, the Void Nothingness Transcendent Balance Heaven, the Supreme Extreme Obscure Heaven; these eight heavens combine sixty-four characters, their positions belong to the Eastern Nine-Fold Azure Heavens.

The Red Brightness Harmonious Yang Heaven, the Mysterious Brightness Respectful Splendour Heaven, the Shining Brightness Ancestral Floating Heaven, the Bamboo Falling Imperial Clarion Heaven, the Void Brightness Hall Shining Heaven, the Observing Brightness Upright and Calm Heaven, the Mysterious Brightness Respectful Celebration Heaven, the Great Radiance Extreme Shaking Heaven; these eight heavens combine sixty-four characters, their positions belong to the Southern Three Black Vermilion Heavens.

The Original Vehicle Hollow Ascending Heaven, the Great Peace Sovereign Cliff Heaven, the Manifest Definite Extreme Wind Heaven, the Initial Yellow Filial Radiance Heaven, the Great Yellow Elder Repeated Heaven, the Thoughtless River Leading Heaven, the Supreme Stack Ruan Music Heaven, the Infinite Cloud Oath Heaven; these eight heavens combine sixty-four characters, their positions belong to the Western Seven-Fold White Heavens.

The Bright Court Dawn Crossing Heaven, the Abyssal Thoroughfare Primordial Cavern Heaven, the Lofty Favoured Wondrous Completion Heaven, the Elegant Music Forbidden Supreme Heaven, the Unsurpassed Constant Fusion Heaven, the Great Release Ascending Victory Heaven, the Dragon Transformation Brahman Crossing Heaven, the Supreme Extreme Balanced Nourishment Jia Yi Heaven; these eight heavens combine sixty-four characters, their positions belong to the Northern Five Qi Mysterious Heavens. The four eights make thirty-two heavens; combined are two hundred and fifty-six characters, all are the thirty-two great Brahman secret characters of heaven, with immeasurable sounds. Heaven has flying mysterious natural black, combining and harmonizing the five sounds to form the immeasurable secret chapters of heaven. They display the mysterious depths of the heavens; praise the great existence’s enlightenment; the central principle of natural qi; universally deliver those who learn immortality; descend to deliver the lives of birth and death; draw out the souls of the long night. The Primal Origin’s wondrous law endures for myriad kalpas; its sound is clear; its Way is carried out. The great law is open and bright; the heavens acclaim and celebrate; the Infinite Great Saints, the Perfect Lords, the Five Elders Supreme Emperors, the Ten Directions Revered Gods, the Divine Immortals and Jade Maidens, all at once perform incense offerings, circling thrice, and chant thus:

The Heavenly Venerable returns to his jade chariot, descends to the incense garden seat. The Perfect Great Saints, the Infinite Heavenly Kings, the Divine Immortals guide sun and moon, luxuriantly unveiling the Cloud Palace. The Five Emperors assist the splendid carriage; the Three Realms complete the Ten Directions. The sun celebrates the assembly of the Perfects; joy is hard to match. The wondrous assembly naturally responds; spiritual auspices arise from the void. Radiant brilliance opens the hidden period; clouds obscure the sun and moon’s light. The mysterious yin does not dissolve the night; the four assemblies respectfully worship. The spiritual qi naturally responds to the design; cultivating and gathering, brightening the great void. The spiritual book of eight gatherings, characters of five sounds combined into chapters. The heavenly truth interprets the wondrous tones; resonantly the great existence communicates. The jade sound is hard to explain; universally completing heaven and earth’s work. Above it plants the roots of all heavens; prominently the sect of divine immortals. Within it performs the mysterious cavernous dwelling; opening the eight hidden chambers. Delivering birth and death’s fate; drawing out the public of the long night. The five sufferings of hell are resolved; the mountain of knives produces no peaks. The five paths have no matching souls; myriad kalpas include few children. The great vehicle transformation is majestic; all works are unbiased in merit. The Infinite Great Saints are the Supreme Heavenly Kings. Unable to contain fear and joy, they fly and recite the sacred chapters. The Heavenly Venerable opens the great existence; the heavens are brilliantly clear. Wondrous is the Dragon and River Way; eight gatherings combined into form. Radiant flying within the void; streaming light in the courts of the Three Realms. The divine design opens the spiritual assembly; the jade book responds to the auspices. The heavenly truth penetrates the wondrous meaning; the five harmonies combine into scripture. Resonantly the jade sound rings; faintly it floats to the Azure Supreme. Deliverance without end; the Nine Nether receives the light. Lofty and majestic is the great gate of the law; instructing all beings. This merit is beyond measure; fear and joy celebrate ten thousand years.

At that time the beneficent grace flowed everywhere; kindness reached the ten directions; faith turned to immortality; all obtained long life; the aged became young again; the sick were immediately healed; dry bones grew soft; dead souls returned to men; the five sufferings were all resolved; hell was at peace; those with intention all attained spirit immortality.

The Heavenly Venerable said to the Perfects of the Four Assemblies: "Today gathered at one seat, within one kalpa, opening the spiritual mystery of heaven, the natural jade book, delivering all men; its blessings are vast and universal, widely benefiting all beings. The great law is already cultivated; kindness without exception; the Infinite Worlds all receive brightness; the Nine Nether opens forgiveness; the long night pardons souls; the living fear and rejoice; the dead receive return. The peoples of the heavens, their former counterparts and kindred, whether male or female, the roots of good and evil fate, come from the Primal Origin until this seat. Birth and death turn and turn, calamities and counterparts drag one another; heaven and earth succeed or fail; merits and faults are hard to clarify. Now relying on the great mercy, universally informing the heavens, sun, moon, stars, the variegated jade scales, the Southern and Northern Dippers, officers of fate and qi, the Han Lords’ records, the Southern Prosperity Upper Palace, all lands and waters, the Five Mountains and Sacred Hills, the Three Officials, Nine Departments, the Twelve River Sources, the Long Night’s palace in the Nine Nether, the Four Officers, Five Emperors, and all gods and spirits collect and examine the registers; verify and check the original sources; no good nor evil; roots of light and heavy; birth and death distinct; names arranged and listed; all eliminated and severed; all causes and conditions cut off; universally one rejoicing; taking now as new; that this one kalpa all may attain true Way and great blessing universally; do not let partiality arise."

The Heavenly Venerable issued commands; the heavens reverently obeyed. Thus the Four Assemblies simultaneously rose and made obeisance, raised hands pointing upwards, lowered hands pointing downwards; no highest nor lowest; no limit nor end; no deep nor far; no hidden nor obscure; no great nor small; numberless and endless; all universally delivered; together shining brilliantly. He waved his finger commanding the assembly, all heard. At that time the Four Assemblies simultaneously raised hands, looked up to heaven and snapped fingers; the thirty-two heavens, sun, moon, stars, all shone together; below the Nine Nether; the bottom of the Infinite; brightness penetrated; no more darkness; the hidden universally seen; earth storehouse revealed its form; mountains, rivers, and streams equally levelled; winter flowers bore fruit; withered trees sprouted prosperity; celebrations added to all; merits borne for all beings; fish and dragons leaped; birds and beasts joyfully sang; spiritual songs met and joined; roadways held no sorrowful sounds; heaven was still and earth silent; the Three Officials secretly quieted; quiet and rest appointed; the five paths ceased to produce souls; men and spirits feared peace; the holy Way was greatly pacific.

The Heavenly Truth Imperial Men said: "The natural jade characters of the inner sounds of the heavens are all the great Brahman secret language among the heavens; weaving the flying mystery’s softness; harmonizing the five directions’ sounds; born from above the Primal Origin; emerging from the void and cavern; following the course to open deliverance; universally completing heaven and earth’s work. This writing is revered and wondrous, not to be revealed to the common. Therefore it opens the beginning of existence, while closing the heavenly brightness, to treasure its Way and reverence its text. The characters are profound and hidden; they are not formless heavenly script; they plant wealth and treasure their wondrous images; and conceal their utmost truth; wondrous responses to the design; their law moves and runs. The Heavenly Venerable did not use my talent to speak, but sent the order to explain its meaning and communicate its jade sounds. The mysterious methods have their regulations; I dare not disobey the command. On the day of poised brush, forms and spirits were lost; I led what I saw; briefly annotate its text; what is right and wrong exhausts my heart. The imperial Way is now clear; the heavens acclaim and celebrate; all obtain support; birth and death both fear; great blessing is universal; my feelings are naturally joyful; only I wish the Four Assemblies all may see and understand."

Thus the Four Assemblies of Perfects and Revered Spirits simultaneously acclaimed goodness. Heaven above and earth below; the Infinite Worlds without end; all gods and spirits none but reverently honoured the great saints; joying in the Way’s enlightenment. Only may the great law widely deliver without end; blessings flow through myriad kalpas; the generations endure; celebrations increase; universally attaining true Way; beyond reckoning. The Four Assemblies simultaneously rose, made obeisance, and received the charge.

The Heavenly Truth Imperial Men bowed and said to the Heavenly Venerable: "Since receiving sun and moon, following the shifting course, coming and going, turning in cycles; one light, one dark; one extinction, one degree; one death, one birth; the body suffers destruction; one defeat, one accomplishment; traversing heaven and earth; changing and exchanging brightness; mysterious and subtle; beyond thought. Since the Dragon and River times, there have been ninety-nine million nine hundred and ninety thousand kalpas; causes and conditions drag one another; generations without cease; until today. Sometimes born in royal households; sometimes born in lowly homes; sometimes born in rich mansions; sometimes born in poverty and cold; sometimes born honored men; sometimes as servants; sometimes afflicted with six diseases; sometimes receiving brightness; sometimes receiving wisdom; sometimes receiving ignorance and deafness. All actions experienced; the body not yet settled; evil causes arise; conduct without Way; not the conduct of man. No reverence for heaven and earth; no fear of ghosts and spirits; no compassion nor filial piety; harming all beings; death follows the sword tree; feet tread the mountain of knives. Sometimes entering cold night; sometimes entering boiling cauldrons; wandering the three paths and five sufferings; form and spirit tortured; painful poison all around; myriad kalpas of suffering; then returned to be born among the six beasts; life span short; again receiving death and destruction; returning to fill the Five Mountains’ long conscripts; east and west conscripted; nothing is not changed; a thousand kalpas of suffering; then born among the border tribes; although having human form, there is no human feeling. Life span short; again receiving death and destruction; spirit bears the four rivers; scourged by the deep ocean waves; wandering among soot, cold ice; day and night unrest; a hundred kalpas come to end; then born again among the lowly people; six diseases, ugly and repulsive to the utmost. Life span short; again receiving death and destruction; spirit enters the long night of the Nine Nether. Assigned to conscript in the Three Rivers; low and blocked to the long source; cold and sharp cutting the muscles; all sufferings experienced; one kalpa’s causes ended; then born anew at the gate of men; form and countenance upright; human Way fully complete. Life span short; again receiving death and destruction; spirit just returned to the Three Officials; all officials hasten to the hundred extremes; wandering the ghostly courts; myriad years of sins ended; then born anew at the gate of the good people; wealth and treasure without lack. Even receiving leniency and peace; life span short; again receiving death and destruction; spirit just returned to the Three Officials; good ghosts receive office as prefects; governing birth and death; a thousand years root severed; then born anew, penetrating spirit and thoroughly seeing; seated seeing ghosts and spirits; commanding summons and controls; assisting the state and governing the people; sometimes aiding emperors and kings to settle the four directions. Life span short; again receiving death and destruction; spirit just able to be a companion and friend of the Five Emperors; socializing with divine immortals; hundred year roots paired and consumed; earth’s blame ended; Three Officials’ registers sealed; heavens’ names recorded; then born anew at the gate of wealth and honour; houses of marquises and kings; honors and emoluments hard to bear. Roots exhausted, blessings born; generating great vows; distributing to the poor; widely making merit; and receiving extinction and release; direct ascent to heaven; carefree fear and joy; food and clothing natural. After twenty-four years, reborn in noble households; receiving wisdom of firewood; five hearts open intelligence; cultivating and serving scriptures and laws; despising wealth and valuing the Way; compassionate heart to all; revering and serving master’s treasures. Merit and virtue not yet complete; again receiving extinction and release; ascending the Southern Palace; Vermilion Mound sets my life record; Three Realms record my merits and fame; circulating through the ten directions and thirty-two heavens; socializing with the highest saints; guests of the Supreme; ten years returning to the human realm; body becoming master and ancestor; propagating complete and thorough Dharma sounds; opening deliverance to heaven and men; teaching and transforming all beings. Turning through myriad kalpas; nothing not experienced; facing Three Officials conscripts; years at an end; yet again practising an evil heart; sin doubly great; again receiving death and destruction; again returning to Three Officials; conscripts blame; suffering surpassing before. Such a good or evil; one leniency or strictness; one death or life; one pity or fear; hard to endure; within myriad kalpas, all evils are exhausted; blessings and virtue spontaneously arise; then returning to the gate of wealth and honor; Way and virtue’s cause and condition; supporting scriptures and laws; seven treasures announce the spirit; generating good hearts and vows; merit and fame complete; raised by the Three Realms; made clear by the Five Emperors; descending the cloud carriage and eight scenic jade wheels; riding the void and floating; morning sun ascends; covered by the Heavenly Venerable; receiving great kindness; sweeping away the decayed bones; obtaining to see the brightness; transcending the Three Realms; position ascending to heavenly truth. Today attending the seat; fear and joy hard to express; the Heavenly Venerable does not regard my shallow sight of bright sounds; unable to touch the matter; seeing he commands annotation; explaining the heavenly sounds; commanding strict teaching; daring not to conceal; I immediately exhaust what I see; all from my heart. Though not all detailed, yet having experienced previous lives of myriad kalpas; wandering and crossing the heavenly origins; following the law of birth and death; constantly encountering true writings; naturally following its mysterious transformation; penetrating to the root; how dare I use private faults to secretly expose the text of nature; to explain the difficult and obscure words; to shake the direction of the jade tinkling; to knock upon the jade music? Though the meaning and substance are not all complete, it is enough to unfold the root of heaven and earth. Among the heavens, vast and wide, the degrees without form or change; sun, moon, stars, palaces, mountains and forests, true men’s cities and terraces; and demon kings, ghosts and spirits; the places to respond and accept; their matters are deep and profound; also not all can be fully explained. Further questions on difficulties and causes are recorded in old books, no longer one or two; the discussion is troublesome and heavy. Now I roughly explain the meaning of the heavenly book’s five combinations; its way is enough to open deliverance to heaven and men; to draw out all suffering roots; the great law opens widely; benefits the ten directions; in this life and the next; men and women, good and gentle, shall all receive this grace. Yet according to the Primal Yang Jade Chest, the nine heavens compute and run numbers; the spirit gates revolve; thirty-two heavens form one communion; false ways arise and travel; myriad names’ hearts are corrupted; quiet and common reverence; this text should return to the great Luo above; in the Seven Treasures Palace. After three or five cycles are complete, myriad ways’ forces have ended; great saints and dragons rise; the lower world delivers men; false seats are destroyed; rebellious people driven back; Dao and virtue flourish; the world is peaceful; rulers enjoy blessings; the ten directions are tranquil. The true scriptures assist the world; auspicious signs arise daily; at the beginning of Renzi, the year Yimao, until the tenth of Jiazi, there will be the Blue Emperor’s nine kinds of immortals; riding nine-colored dragons; traveling the Great Mountain; relying on this true scripture; to sweep away all residue. The true scripture descends to the world; the horn sound of the dragon spirit; meets our Way; its blessing is self-strengthening; to preserve the year of Jiashen; universally deliver heaven and men; at that time fear and joy; this is the merit of the scripture. Those who reverence it enjoy blessings; those who cultivate it become divine immortals. This writing is profound and mysterious; broadly covering the boundless; the great law is revered. I humbly pray the Heavenly Venerable to universally announce it to the heavens, the supreme emperors, great saints and revered gods, sun, moon, stars, earth above and below, the Five Mountains, the Four Rivers, and the river and sea water emperors; divine immortals and true men; all spirits of the ten directions; all according to the great existence’s pattern; registers complete and reverent; prohibitions against neglect and arrogance; secret and reverent.

At that time the Heavenly Venerable raised his hand and waved his finger; heaven above and earth below; the infinite worlds; all gods and spirits none but secretly reverenced. The great saints of the heavens simultaneously bowed; knelt long and praised goodness. The Heavenly Venerable spoke to the great saints of the four seats, the Infinite Supreme Great Way Lord, the thirty-two heavens and ten directions revered gods, and the Heavenly Truth Imperial Men: "Before the Dragon and River, in the time of Yan Kang, following the course of birth and death; until the Dragon and River, receiving counterparts; soul and form suffering hardship; wandering the three paths; causes exhausted, roots severed; entering the gate of blessing; traversing heaven and earth; one accomplishment, one failure; no more limit or end; meeting the heavenly origin; constantly encountering the spiritual treasure; world after world issuing the law; transforming and delivering heaven and men. Therefore, penetrating the affairs of heaven; able to understand the natural text of the heavenly book; the great law open and bright; the heavens’ sect; should proclaim the utmost truth; the sound clear and resonant. Therefore let the annotation explain its difficult and obscure words; harmonize and combine the five directions’ innumerable sounds; to form the heavens; universally deliver the future lives; within this mystery and profundity, believe and reverence. The spiritual sounds resound; the heavens shine brightly; heaven above and earth below; the ten directions and infinite worlds; all gods and spirits none but revere. According to the clear true mysterious method’s regulations; with jade boys and jade girls, each twenty-four; burning incense serving the true; inspecting sloth and errors; not to lightly proclaim. Once in forty thousand kalpas appears; descending to the lower world to deliver men; clearly inspecting and guarding; not allowing speech. At that time the Four Assemblies simultaneously made obeisance; bowed and praised goodness."

The Heavenly Truth Imperial Men said: "The heavenly book is revered; it delivers men without measure; precious and brings blessings; negligent and brings ruin. Among these, the heavens have already attained the Way; past Infinite Great Saints; the Perfect Revered Spirits; and flying divine men; the Five Mountains’ divine immortals; none but fully receive reverence; the heavenly natural sounds form the supreme truth. Unless one has past destiny inscribed in the golden register and jade characters of the Azure Supreme, one cannot see it; escaping the faults of neglect and arrogance; seeing its chapters and titles; the spirit confounds the heart; never opens to enlightenment. If one has the past root, one should generate the heart; wish to delight in the divine text; be born to meet the age; meet the text; then rely on the seven treasures text brocade’s faith; go to the master to swear the oath; the upper heavenly authorities receive and complete the body. Having completed this text, the heavens revere, the Three Realms acclaim, the Five Emperors attend, the earth deities welcome; all gods and spirits none but come to the gate; to draw out the nine ancestors from the long night; open deliverance to the dead souls in the nine darknesses; return again to the womb in the spirit swallow; obtain birth at the gate of wealth and honor; long associate with the heavens; carry and lead the Great Mountain’s guests."

The Five Elders the Emperor Lords proclaimed to the heavens, the earth’s Five Sacred Mountains, the Three Rivers and Nine Seas, the divine immortals, true men, jade maidens, all divine spirits: "The Heavenly Truth Imperial Men open the great existence’s wondrous law; communicate the natural spiritual text; the heavenly book is revered; forbidden to lightly transmit. Now in this life men and women, hearts not harboring duplicity, revering and believing in nature, all who receive it gain ascent and deliverance; those who serve it gain long life; lightly regarding wealth and valuing the law, demons have no grounds for speech. In the next life men and women, hearts will be destroyed; each harbouring deceit and cunning; valuing wealth and despising the Way; not believing the supreme truth; though there be return, much is in appearance; will is not focused; greed, theft, factional strife; thus demons have grounds for speech. Therefore the mysterious law commands prohibitions; with seven treasures’ text brocade; testing the human heart. If there be those of true learning who follow the regulations and ascend in faith; they may speak the names of the heavens; proclaim the Five Mountains; the earth’s divine immortals; all names recorded; proclaiming to demon kings; recommending the Three Pure Ones; then transmitting—how can there be violation of the mysterious law? Bearing the wind knife on the body; myriad kalpas no return; nine ancestors filling the night; long conscripts in the river sources; all gods and spirits clearly understanding these words."

The Heavenly Truth Imperial Men said to the Five Elders the Emperor Lords: "I should, in the midst of the Dragon and River, receive the text from the Nameless Everlasting Lord. The rites of rising and falling; with cinnabar brush inscribe the eight heavenly characters’ sounds; combining two hundred and fifty-six characters; using yellow brocade for earth to complete the body. Following the clear true mysterious regulations; with gold, silver, ivory, agate, crystal, carnelian, and horse brain; the seven treasures guard the spirit. The five-coloured text brocades, each in volumes and measures, to honor the divine truth. The words of the mysterious law; the law must not be deficient. As for those with heart, poor and unprepared, precious to obtain a register of the hidden; measure their weight and measure; properly grant it. The inner sounds come forth."

The Preface to the Many Chapters Scripture is completed.

[Notes]

1. The title is based on the Dunhuang S.6659 manuscript supplement. The beginning of that manuscript is missing, the end complete, titled "Preface to Many Chapters". It corresponds to the "Preface to Many Scriptures in One Volume" recorded in the "Catalogue of the Spiritual Treasure Medium Pact Scriptures". The Kyoto 253 manuscript titles it "Supreme Cavernous Mysterious Spiritual Treasure Wondrous Scripture Many Chapters Preface."

2. From the content later, the missing front text of S.6659 is inferred to be the upper scroll of the "Supreme Cavernous Mysterious Spiritual Treasure Five Chapters True Red Script Scripture".

3. The phrase "not idle" appears as "not related" in P.3386; in the Daoist Canon edition of "Primal Origin Five Elder Red Script" it appears as "not opened", which is close.
