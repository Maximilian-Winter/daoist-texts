The Scripture of the Heavenly Gates of the Supreme Cavernous Mysterious Numinous Treasure

The Great Way is the subtle operation. There is the Great Ultimate (Taiyi), when qi is not yet seen. There is the Great Beginning (Taichu), the beginning of qi. There is the Great Initiation (Taishi), the beginning of form. There is the Great Simplicity (Taisu), the beginning of substance. Furthermore, qi, form, and substance exist together, yet have not separated one from the other; this is called Chaos (Hundun), that is, the undistinguished state of all things. The light and pure is Heaven; the heavy and turbid is Earth. Therefore, the formation of Heaven and Earth is thus recorded: The Old Lord is the root and foundation of Heaven and Earth; all things are generated through him. Therefore, he takes his place upon the path of unhaste, wandering in the realm of no reliance, riding the hollow void to ascend and descend, wielding yin and yang to mould and refine, embracing the nameless great simplicity, which is good at lending and bringing to completion. Hence, at the outset of 9,999,999,999,999 myriad qi, the Mysterious Origin was again arranged, and Heaven and Earth were born. He is called the Nameless Lord, unfolding the Way of Nature, in order to transform Heaven and Earth. After one Great Calamity, when Heaven and Earth collapsed and were submerged, the qi again gathered and regulated the movements, reestablishing Heaven and Earth, called the Unsurpassed Mysterious Old Lord, who opens and guides countless men. After the cycle of the Great Calamity, Heaven and Earth were again broken, and the Two Instruments of Transformation were made; called the Supreme Old Lord, holding the celestial register in hand, to deliver the ten directions. At the end of one kalpa, when Heaven and Earth again sank, he entrusted his life to the Mysterious Profound, called the Most High Old Lord, and mixed to create Heaven and Earth. He separated the primordial qi: the pure became Heaven, the turbid became Earth; the essence of the Great Yang became the Sun, the essence of the Great Yin became the Moon. He further divided the essence of Sun and Moon into the stars, set the Twenty-Eight Mansions, arranged the Twenty-Four Qi, established the Eight Solar Terms, Four Seasons, and Five Elements, set the Five Planets, and the Five Sacred Mountains; assigned the ruling of Five Emperors accordingly; the Sun, Moon, and stars each have their palaces, managing their affairs. To the Four Seasons — Spring, Summer, Autumn, and Winter — correspond the Twenty-Four Qi; further, Three Hundred and Sixty Famous Mountains and Seventy-Two Blessed Places were established to guard the geography. When the qi of Heaven and Earth mingled, then men, birds, beasts, grasses, and trees, flying and creeping, all came into being in multitude. Then were set up the Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors, begetting the myriad peoples, mutually generating and transforming. Heaven and Earth are apart by forty-eight thousand li; East, West, South, and North are apart by one hundred ninety thousand li; the Sun and Moon each measure three thousand li in diameter, and are nine thousand li round. Mount Kunlun is the level of Heaven and Earth; above it stands the Mysterious Lord of the Northern Pole; one star of the Big Dipper covers a hundred li, its distance being ninety thousand li; thus arranged and established, there are altogether Nine Heavens and Nine Earths. The Nine Heavens are, from below: first, the Politeness Heaven; second, the Jiayi Heaven; third, the Brahma Treasure Heaven; fourth, the Response-Transformation Heaven; fifth, the Unarrogant Heaven; sixth, the Silent Heaven; seventh, the Must-Extend Heaven; eighth, the Meditation-Benevolent Heaven; ninth, the Yudan Heaven. The Nine Earths are, from above: first, the Colour-Moist Earth; second, the Moist-Colour Earth; third, the Colour-Lustre Earth; fourth, the Moist-Lustre Earth; fifth, the Metal-Grain Moist Earth; sixth, the Diamond Moist Earth; seventh, the Water Moist Earth; eighth, the Wind Moist Earth; ninth, the Cavern Spring Framework Earth, also called the Nine Ramparts. Yet the heavenly positions are many; here only are named thirty-six, divided into Three Realms, Four Heavens, and the Three Purities' domains. Beginning from below, the first is the Desire Realm with six heavens. The six heavens are: Supreme Sovereign Heaven, Supreme Bright Heaven, Clear Bright Heaven, Mysterious Embryo Heaven, Original Bright Heaven, and the Seven Luminaries Heaven. The second is the Form Realm with eighteen heavens: Voidless Heaven, Great Pole Heaven, Scarlet Bright Heaven, Reverent Splendour Heaven, Luminous Bright Heaven, Bamboo Falling Heaven, Void Bright Heaven, Observing Bright Heaven, Reverent Celebration Heaven, Great Radiance Heaven, Original Carrier Heaven, Great Peace Heaven, Manifest Stability Heaven, First Yellow Heaven, Great Yellow Heaven, Thoughtless Heaven, Supreme Grasp Heaven, and Limitless Heaven. The third is the Formless Realm with four heavens: Sky Degree Heaven, Original Cavern Heaven, Wonderful Accomplishment Heaven, Forbidden Supreme Heaven. Altogether twenty-eight heavens are called the Three Realms. Next above are the Four Human Heavens: Constant Harmony Heaven, Jade Lofty Heaven, Brahma Degree Heaven, and Merchant's Game Heaven. These four heavens are called the Seed-People Heavens. Together with the former, they are thirty-two heavens, all beneath the Three Purities. Next above are the Three Heavens called the Three Purities: first, the Great Red Heaven, called the Supreme Clear Domain; second, the Yu-remaining Heaven, called the Upper Clear Domain; third, the Clear Subtle Heaven, called the Jade Clear Domain; above all is the One Heaven, called the Unsurpassed Great Luo High Canopy Heaven, so named because it enfolds all heavens and is supremely high and unsurpassed. Including all previously named, there are thirty-six heavens, each with an emperor. The earth likewise has thirty-six names, each placed with an emperor. These are the Thirty-Six Heavenly Emperors and Thirty-Six Earthly Emperors. Each Heavenly Emperor and Earthly Emperor has his form, crown, and robes, indicating his office and charge, all set forth in the celestial registers of the immortals, that is, the seventy-two Heavenly Emperors and Earthly Emperors. All revere the Heavenly Venerables of the ten directions, who govern the three realms of immortals and mortals, lifespan, calamity, and fortune. If one does not have recourse to the Heavenly Venerables of the ten directions, to whom then does one turn? Therefore, the Five Sacred Mountains each display their forms and insignia to induce the peoples of the world to have recourse. The hymn says:

The Three Purities descend in spirit, the Eight Extremes bow in submission. The Six Palaces are without dust, the Ten Heavens move with splendour. Morning and evening repeat this, universally revering the Heavenly Venerables of the ten directions, and seeking longevity. To these you should have recourse.
