## The Mysterious and Wonderful Scripture of the Supreme Most High, Cavernous and Mysterious, Spiritual Treasure of Pure Offerings

At that time, the Supreme Ultimate Left Immortal Lord, upon the lofty peak of Ruoye Mountain, the utmost summit of the clouds, in deep thought and quietude, ceasing the six dusts forever, empty within, pure and void, his body and mind unmoved, also without wandering thoughts, attained stillness and concentration within seven days.  
On the next day, at noon, suddenly he heard above the ringing of bells and drums in disorder, amid floating clouds, the sound of great heavenly music.  
In a moment, the heavens rained fragrant flowers, some large flowers and some small; all the flowers had a hundred petals, broad and round, like the wheels of a carriage, their size various, their appearance ever-changing. Some were blue, some yellow, some vermilion, some purple, some formed of the seven treasures, diversely transformed, exceedingly wondrous and rare. These were flowers of the heavens, not capable of being fully displayed.  
Moreover, there were various fragrances: powdery scents, pearl-like scents, the fragrance of the hundred harmonies, the seven treasures’ scent, and the like, all ascending to the sky, their vapour fragrant and pure, filling the mountains and forests.  
Then among the clouds appeared five-coloured flying clouds, eight splendid carriages, and thirty thousand attendants of immortals and spirits. These immortals were all wise and intelligent, clear and eloquent, accomplished in the six supernatural powers, inconceivable.  
Within the three carriages were true men; their necks bore round radiance, their light all five-coloured, shining and flashing through the empty space. Their heads were crowned with precious crowns, their garments all cloud brocade, adorned with gold carvings, their beads shining like the bright moon, used as tassels.  
They had the thirty-two marks and eighty kinds of excellences, manifesting pure brightness, each riding in a carriage and dwelling before him.  
The first precious carriage’s true man called himself Myu Luoqiao.  
The second jade carriage’s true man called himself My Guang Miaoyin.  
The third green carriage’s true man called himself Rizhao Wuzhengguang.  
The three true men together praised in one voice:  
“Excellent! Excellent! Good man, thou hast in countless and boundless kalpas established great diligence, ever practising forbearance, exercising a heart of compassion, and hast attained today, without attachment to other matters, body and mind unmoved, gaining a selfless heart.  
Having no self-heart, also no other heart; having no other heart, also no different heart; having no different heart, thou hast attained an equal heart.  
Good man, on this mountain thou hast gained the heart of no this and no that, accomplished the fruit of the Way, inconceivable.  
We now, at the command of the Heavenly Honoured One, hearing of thy merit filling the world, responding above in the heavens, come hither with our attendants to witness thy practice and accomplish thy Way,  
That those who come hereafter may have knowledge; that those who come hereafter may enter the city of the Dharma; that those who come hereafter may obtain the formless Dharma.  
For this cause we descend.”  

At that time, the Immortal Lord immediately rose from his seat, prostrated his head to the ground, and after hearing the words of the true man Myu Luoqiao, after a long pause rose and made reverence, saying:  
“How is it, great True One, that thy light and appearance are such, that thou dost again rain fragrant flowers, diversely transformed, auspicious signs thus?  
I do not understand this day’s cause, nor the meaning why grace should extend thus.  
I especially beseech the great True One to show me, that I may realize and understand the cause and condition,  
That this dull blind one may be enlightened and know all conditions, and surely accomplish the unsurpassed fruit of the Way.”  

Then the first true man Myu Luoqiao said:  
“Excellent! Excellent! Good man, what was thy former wish and what is now thy thought?”  
The Immortal Lord said:  
“Truly it is sealed upon my lips, and I dare not speak easily.”  
The great True One said:  
“I now come to fulfill thy wish, desiring that in future great Dharma bridges may be raised, great boats and oars made, great causes opened, and great merit magnified.  
For this reason I descend.”  
The Immortal Lord again rose and made reverence, and respectfully said:  
“Great Master True One, pity my ignorance, I desire to ask something, but dare not consult.  
Only I beseech the great True One to take my humble words.”  
The true man said:  
“Great good, great good, ask as thou wilt.”  
The Immortal Lord said:  
“Already on the seventh day of the seventh month, in one thought, I have beheld the ten directions, these hells, the ghosts and hungry spirits, swallowing fire and eating coal, treading and ascending knife mountains, heads and hands misplaced.  
Some bodies enter boiling cauldrons, the five parts rotting and destroyed, no longer ghost-forms; the various sufferings and pains are inconceivable.  
The sufferings in the Dharma realm cannot be added to, yet with one thought I see such suffering; I cannot but perceive all the joints and pores of my body flowing blood as if dismembered.  
This was the former thought, fully as now spoken.  
I do not understand, great True One, what merit can save all such ghosts and spirits, to be free from vexation, fully satisfied, and attain liberation?”  

Then the true man, having heard these words, snapped his fingers joyfully and said:  
“Excellent! Excellent! Good man, to speak thus is truly inconceivable.  
Now I tell thee, listen carefully, I will explain it to thee.”  
The great True One then said:  
“There are only three prime auspicious days, and five calendric festivals, collectively called the Eight Days.  
On these days one may at the Mysterious Altar and the Pure Abode invite Daoist priests to keep vigil through the night, practising the Way, offering incense and oil, making sweet fruits, piled into mountains according to size, or bound in bundles, variously adorned, and offered above to the Heavenly Honoured One.  
Therefore, through compassion, benefitting the ten directions, countless and boundless, the imprisoned souls in hell and the hungry ghosts all obtain liberation.  
If one commits grave sins, blasphemes the Great Way, or destroys the pure precepts and Daoist priests, this is called a grave sin.  
If one kills father or mother, attacks the master or ruler, plots rebellion against the sovereign, this too is called a grave sin.  
If one commits such sins, by responding to offerings for a time, one may attain liberation.  
If one’s sins are light, then by these offerings and vigil through the night, one attains eternal liberation, simultaneously fully satisfied.  
Good man, this is the great merit of magnifying offerings, that future compassionate Daoist priests and filial sons may all offer to their ancestors, whether departed fathers or mothers, sisters or brothers, all may attain liberation, be full, and not hunger.  
If one does not observe these Eight Days and does not offer to ancestors, this is unfilial.  
Tell those who come hereafter to diligently cultivate pure offerings, not only will ghosts and spirits attain liberation, but those living in the world will have their wealth increased and not be harmed by ancestors of seven generations past.  
Not only will the ancestors of seven generations not harm them, but all ghosts, spirits, demons, and thieves will not harm them.  
Why so? Because worldly commoners, sometimes by what they see, seek demons and ghosts, and sacrifice to ancestors, not according to the Eight Days, and so turn away ancestors and incur greater guilt.  

Why so? If offerings are not made according to the Eight Days, then the souls are hungry; amid hunger they give rise to harm, attracting external demons to make mischief together.  
If offerings are made rightly, according to the Eight Days, then the departed are joyful and do not cause harm; all demons and thieves cannot injure — such is the principle.”  

The Immortal Lord further said:  
“Excellent! What the Heavenly True One has just spoken of is the great pure offering, manifest and manifestly great.  
When speaking of the Eight Days, it is not yet clear what they are; grant me leave to distinguish.”  

The true man said:  
“These Eight Days are the fifteenth day of the first month, the fifteenth day of the seventh month, and the fifteenth day of the tenth month; these are the days of the three Primes.  
Also, the first day of the first month is called the Heavenly Festival; the fifth day of the fifth month is called the Earthly Festival; the seventh day of the seventh month is called the Dao and Virtue Festival; the first day of the tenth month is called the People’s New Year Festival; and the twelfth month’s meeting festival is called the Prince’s Festival.  
These are the so-called Eight Days.  
If one does not offer sacrifices on these Eight Days, one will not attain the retribution of sin and blessing, as already explained.  
Good man, hold fast in thy heart what I now say, this is the ordinance of the three highest heavens, the purple scroll and golden inscription of the eternal ritual of Heaven and Earth, inconceivable; how can it not be revered and well observed?”  

The second true man, Guang Miaoyin, said to the Immortal Lord:  
“Excellent! Excellent! Good man, the merit is great and immeasurable.  
I serve the Heavenly Honoured One’s command, to come with the gods, immortals, and attendants to Ruoye.  
Why so? Because it is inconceivable, because there is nothing to be attained.  
Good man, as just spoken, these are called the Eight Days, inconceivable, called the Eight Liberations.  
On these days, at the hour of the hare, set the six-path seats, pure incense and fragrant water, and various clothing and outer utensils, sweet prepared foods and drinks, arranged in order.  
The Daoist in the place of the Way cleanses at dawn with rites and petitions.  
At noon they practise the Way and repentance, and the offerings to ancestors and departed spirits of benefactors are all freed and purified on this day.”  

The Immortal Lord said:  
“Excellent! Can the great True One open the gate of liberation for all beings, descending for those who seek nothing?  
I do not understand what the six paths are; pray explain fully.”  

The true man said:  
“One is the heavenly path; two, the human path; three, the path of beasts; four, the path of spirits; five, the path of ghosts; six, the path of hell. These are called the Six Paths.  
Good man, keep it firmly in thy heart, canst thou not observe it?”  

Furthermore, the third true man, Zhen Dingguang, said:  
“Excellent! Excellent! Good man, these Eight Days have been fully explained by the two great true men; the merits in order and the principles are manifest.  
Now I will lastly explain the great cause and condition, desiring to tell thee; wilt thou hear?”  
The Immortal Lord made reverence and rose, saying:  
“Compassion widely extended, not abandoning the common people.  
Today I leap for joy, not from intention or ability.  
I especially beseech the great True One to illuminate my dullness; I dare not consult.”  

The true man said:  
“We serve the Heavenly Honoured One’s command, truly for past great accomplishments; how can thy heart not speak?  
If thou dost not speak, thou wilt fall into ignorance and destroy the seed of true Way.  
Moreover, in past kalpas thou didst cultivate merit and accomplish works; how canst thou not speak?  
Good man, as has been said, the cause and condition of offerings and merit have two kinds of meaning.  
What are the two kinds?  
One is offerings abiding in form, called finite;  
The other is offerings not abiding in form, called pure offerings, called infinite.  
Why so?  
Like the waters of rivers and seas, revolving without end.  
Therefore this scripture expounds the meaning of the infinite, likewise.  
Also like the void, boundless and limitless, immeasurable.  
Therefore I now explain the meaning of the infinite, likewise.  
If the waters of rivers and seas were finite in their revolutions, then I now explain the meaning of the infinite there would be finite.  
If the void and seas are altogether unknowable in extent, therefore the infinite is shown likewise.  
Good man, thou must know the meaning of the finite and distinguish it clearly.  
The finite is like a man reciting the verses of a sutra, one sentence, two gathas, from three or four up to hundreds, thousands, millions of verses, yet it is not many.  
Why so? If he recited it, in not many years it would be finished, therefore it is finite.  
Therefore I now explain the meaning of the finite likewise.  
Also like a man who obtains a great royal throne, riches and honours accumulated over generations, gold, silver, lapis lazuli, coral, amber, diamond, and all precious shells and armour filling a city, yet it is not much.  
Why so? If used in alms, within no more than a month it would be spent, therefore it is finite.  
Therefore I now explain the meaning of the finite likewise.  
If one recites sutra verses with the mouth endlessly, and gives precious things with the hand without limit, then know that what I now say, offerings abiding in form are called finite.  
Why so? All limited things, their offerings daily diminish; unlimited things no kalpa can exhaust.  
Therefore I now explain the meaning of the finite must be thus.  
Good man, the principle and aim are all so; not only the merit of offerings is so, but all feasts, one meeting or all night, likewise.  
Canst thou not diligently practise?  
If thou canst constantly rouse thy heart, practise non-abiding form, well know the meaning of the infinite, then surely it will cause thee to attain the unsurpassed Way.  
Why so? Because there is no self-body, no self-heart.  
Having no self-body, then no self-heart.  
Having no self-heart, also no other heart.  
Having no other heart, all hearts are extinguished; this is called purity.  
Attaining the state of no heart, attaining the state of no self.  
Good man, now again understand these sayings.  
If there be a self-heart, resting in other heart, then the self-heart is not extinguished; this is called attaining body and heart no self, but not attaining the Dharma realm no self.  
If thou wouldst seek the Dharma realm no self, thou must know originally no and now no;  
Knowing originally no and now no, then thou knowest also no Dharma realm.  
If the Dharma realm is none, then there is no birth and no death.  
No birth and no death, therefore it must be known it is neither no birth nor no death.  
What is meant by no birth and no death?  
Because it is spoken of the Dharma.  
Therefore it is said no birth and no death.  
If thou dost attain such principle, then it is called able to make pure offerings; then it is called attaining the Dharma realm no self; then it is called attaining the Dharma realm pure and serene.  
Good man, what I now lastly speak is all that which the innumerable and boundless ancient heavenly honoured true men, immortals, sages of the Way, and also the great powerful kings of gods, spirits, and demons of the ten directions, have practised, and thereby attained the unsurpassed Way.  
Though thou art not named as compiler at present, yet thy rank is called Supreme Ultimate Left Immortal Lord.  
The great Immortal rank, now canst thou not practise it?  
Surely thou wilt attain to be a true man sage, perfect in the six supernatural powers, accomplishing the unsurpassed Way.”  

Then the Immortal Lord immediately rose from his seat, made reverence and thanked, saying:  
“Now I suddenly have encountered the great True One, who has granted such words, truly rare.  
From countless kalpas past, practising various merits, I also met immortals, often they discoursed to me on the lesser vehicle and lesser wisdom of the way of nurturing life.  
Never yet was there such as the great True One now speaks, subtle, boundless, limitless, inconceivable.  
Now my burdens are dissolved, like long-frozen ice meeting fire, suddenly melted and dispersed, with no residue.  
Now I have no obstruction, likewise.  
Also like the story of a father selling his son, and the mother and brothers mourning, inconceivable; suddenly in no time, the treasuries of gold and silver are filled, and then the son is recovered, rejoicing without measure.  
Now my joy is likewise.  
Also as in former days a king had a daughter named Guanyin, mute in all six extremities, abandoned in the deep mountains, hungry and exhausted, life in peril; after encountering the descent of a true man who showed her, the sickness was cured, she fully attained speech, was satisfied and rejoiced without measure.  
Now my joy is likewise.  
I especially beseech the great True One to command the spiritual chariots to pause in the groves and thickets, to await the auspicious time to rise.”  

The great True One said:  
“We now depart, but soon return.”  
Having taken leave, the three carriages went in order, with immortal musicians leading, soaring to the clouds’ summit.  
In a moment, unknown where they were.  

The Immortal Lord respectfully carried out the practice, and on the fifteenth day, carefully following the Dharma, magnified pure offerings with due ritual.  
He made a great fruit mountain, eight zhang high, variously decorated, subtle and rare.  
Various sweet fruits spread over the mountains and forests, and great quantities of rice.  
At noon on this day, the hells of the ten directions, and the sentient beings of the six paths, their bodies differing in appearance, countless and boundless, all came together.  
Among these ghosts was a great king, named Great Might, who advanced before the ghosts, and at once made reverence, all together praising in one voice:  
“Excellent! Excellent!”  
Great Might King said:  
“The pure-world Daoists can open the gate of liberation for us, and today we have attained it.  
These are our attendants, and those who are not our attendants, countless and boundless, all come together, all enlightened and purified, and have attained liberation.  
If not for pure precepts and compassion, how could we be these attendants, and arrange pure offerings?  
Only we pray the Dharma Master soon attain the great Immortal, and verify the unsurpassed Way.”  
The heavens, humans, beasts, spirits, ghosts, hellish wandering souls, all said the same.  
When these words were finished, all bathed in fragrant water, adorned their clothes, sat according to rank, and had full food and drink.  
At noon, the great king and his attendants each took leave of the Immortal Lord, saying:  
“Dharma Master, excellent! inconceivable!  
Because of this compassion, countless souls have attained liberation.”  
Having thus spoken, they kowtowed and departed.  

The Immortal Lord announced to those coming hereafter, good men and good women:  
“I from countless and boundless kalpas past, until today, was first instructed by the great True One to speak these essential words, inconceivable.  
Though formerly I received the great True One’s teaching of the Offering Scripture, its discussion was brief, and not as immediate as today’s exposition of the causes and conditions; its meaning was profound and far-reaching, to such extent.  
Also there is a scripture called the ‘Great Offering,’ which only speaks directly of the three Primes, not clarifying the Eight Days, nor the vast merit as thus, boundless and limitless, inconceivable.  
Good men and women, can you not reverently observe it?  
If you can respectfully observe and practise this scripture, these are called filial sons, repaying the gratitude of their parents who gave birth and nurtured them.  
Not only the parents who gave them birth, but also the true parents are repaid.  
Having repaid the true parents, gradually the fruit of the Way proceeds.  
If one slanders and disbelieves, and does not offer to ancestors, that is called unfilial, opposing the true parents.  
Why so? If one does not offer to ancestors, the ghosts are hungry; this is called unfilial.  
Having been unfilial, having caused slander, then slander caused, then the departed parents suffer affliction; their bodies present in the world are harmed by demon kings and ghost thieves, afflicted with leprosy and various pains, fully enduring them.  
Men and women coming hereafter, be aware and carefully guard yourselves.”
