## The Supreme Numinous Treasure Great Blessing and Sin-Extinguishing Image Scripture

In former times, the Crown Prince of the Kingdom of Anren was named Taixu, styled Haikong. His conduct was of utmost sincerity and aspiration; he renounced the world and cultivated the Way. The King, moved by pity for his steadfast and upright mind, which could not be turned aside, summoned the supreme True Man among the sages of the realm, and caused him to descend within the Heavenly Palace.

The Crown Prince prostrated himself and advanced on his knees, knocking his head and beating his breast, to implore grace: "Taixu, after a thousand years, has the good fortune to meet a true master; he looks up with shame to all the spirits of Heaven and Earth, joy and fear mingled, not knowing how to express thanks. The disciple has heard of the Numinous Treasure Great Law, the Three Primes True Scripture, the Supreme Clarity Purple Book, with golden slips and jade tally, each character one zh√†ng square, its writing radiant and bright. The foundation of sincerity upon which to rely; I humbly hope for instruction and explanation, to bring comfort to the dust-laden heart."

The Supreme True Man answered with joy: "Good, good. Thou hast earnestly sought the Way, bowed thy head in submission and dependence; in countless kalpas heretofore, such has never been. I hear that my true scriptures descend to the world to save the heavenly and human; they prescribe prohibitions with majesty and awe; the numinous writings and precious secrets, the profound mystery of the supreme Way, are not known even to the perfected immortals. Though thy rank be noble, Crown Prince, and thy heart washed seeking the Law, the foul dregs and filth thou bearest cause no one to lightly transmit (them)."

Thereupon the Prince prostrated his five limbs upon the earth, and with the wind at his back crawled forward on his knees, and said to the True Man: "In this world of flux and vanity, there is nothing truly real. Birth and old age, sickness and death, cycle after cycle, without cessation. Though one be high in rank, who can abide long? Like lightning and flowing water, like bubbles and flashes of lightning, there is no parable. Though the supreme Law be lofty and secret, I hope for a glance at the title and chapter, and humbly pray for great compassion to grant instruction."

Taixu asked leave to resign his succession and dwell in a hidden forest. The King, moved by pity, consented to his sincere wish. The True Man knew that Taixu's sincerity was recordable, and that the true Way had its time. He opened the Purple Yang Jade Box, a pouch of cloud brocade, containing the Law and rites according to the prescribed rules; swore an oath with Heaven, and transmitted the Numinous Treasure True Writings, Three Primes, precepts.

Taixu thereupon bowed his head and struck his cheeks, giving thanks for the great grace. Having received the true scriptures, he firmly declined the King, and entered the Mountain of Man and Bird, purifying himself with fasting and study. For twelve years, the Five Elder Sovereigns conferred the books upon Taixu, who attained to be a True Man.

On the day of the Middle Prime, in the main hall of the palace, all was adorned with purity and splendour; divine banners and precious canopies, numinous fruits and famous flowers, all treasures and rare articles of the kingdom, fragrant incense and precious jewels, a hundred flavours of food and drink, fresh and refined essences, arranged on mountain-shaped trays, distributed according to place, wafting fragrant incense, shooting up to the nine heavens, reaching the Heavenly Palace.

At that time, the Primordial Celestial Venerable beheld that Taixu was fit for salvation, and with flying celestial immortals, various heavenly sovereigns, jade youths and maidens, vajra spirit kings, heavenly soldiers and strongmen, led and followed, came from the northwest of Heaven, and descended to the seat in the void.

At this moment, the celestial palace was filled with highest sages, yet none pressed forward. In an instant, the Celestial Venerable emitted five-coloured light from his mouth, subtle and wondrous radiance, illuminating the heavens and the three thousand great thousand worlds, perceiving all as one, without obstruction, as if viewing the palm of the hand, inconceivable.

The Celestial Venerable said to the four hosts: "I hear that men and women of the realm, through countless kalpas, have been unable to be pure; proud and luxurious, indulging themselves, entangled in vexations, lives short and unable to be freed. I open a convenient gate for their future births, to remove their sufferings, universally causing peace and joy, all returning to the good Way, alike hastening to the mysterious ford." Then the four hosts held aloft and reverently heard the Dharma voice.

The Celestial Venerable said: "Sentient beings' karma is not from one source alone. Good and evil, suffering and emptiness pervade all realms of law. Mixed evil retributions are countless and boundless. For future births I briefly indicate the rules and ordinances, and proceed to expound the twenty-four gates of precepts and vows, to induce and admonish those astray, to bring them ultimately to the place of the Way. According to their portion they obtain fruit, wielding the treasure sword to cut off vexations, lighting the lamp of the Law to dispel the four confusions. Internal stillness removes dust and toil; external liberation removes entanglements; all faculties are cleansed, ascending the gate of correct contemplation, and causing all beings to arrive at the place of liberation." Then the Supreme True Man and all the celestial host received the precepts and took the vows, reverently observing.

At that meeting there was a True Man named Xianwei, who beheld this wondrous assembly, difficult to parable, joy unmeasured. He asked the Celestial Sovereign: "I have heard of the great assembly discoursing the Law, with radiance brilliant and shining; I did not expect now to personally encounter it, with all the heavens and all the saints united in one Dharma voice. This land and that other are clear as the palm of the hand. The Primordial Celestial Venerable's radiance is resplendent, astounding the spirits; on the left stands the Immortal Minister, on the right guards the True Elder; the vermilion phoenix and black tortoise, the azure dragon and white tiger, the heavenly boys and girls, countless hosts without number, floating and flying, the treasure store wide open. At that time the assembly advanced to the highest true rank; beginners all entered the immortal steps. I humbly ask: the beings of the lower realms are stained by the three evils, not merciful nor filial, neither loving nor benevolent, entangled in the three officials, unable to be freed; whither should they turn? How may their faults be pardoned? What cultivation should they perform to obtain forgiveness?"

The Celestial Venerable said: "Thou shouldst listen attentively. I now open for thee that which thou hast not heard, explain vexations, cut off confusion and obstacles, open the boundary of the mysterious capital, the jade slip of true writings, and the celestial venerable titles, that through them future births may understand, and with utmost sincerity turn their minds, purify their fasting, burn incense, light lamps and offer worship, believe and reverence the celestial venerable titles, the treasured secret numinous writings, and all the celestial hosts; bow and worship, wish and meditate; eradicate the bright truth from the nine obscure jade boxes of the long night; thus attain birth among men and gods, depart suffering and achieve liberation; consume the sands of sin and the dust of good affinity. Therefore with sincere mind, turn and reverence.

Having reverenced the Three Treasures, then again with utmost sincerity repent:

The disciples, each from innumerable kalpas past until today, in body, mouth, and mind, have committed evil and faults, as numerous as dust and sand, incalculable. Some, in their prime, indulge in dissipation, chasing after a hundred desires; committing theft and harm, indulging their hearts and pleasures; favoured in cruel perversity, disregarding danger; serving superiors and parents without loyalty or filiality; cruel deeds abound; plotting harm and hostility; oppressing the common people; producing envy and jealousy; causing the heavenly people to fear, and those above and below to hate. If such faults exist, I begin with them in repentance.

Some, in the three springs, set fire to burn insects and snakes; hunting and enclosing; harming the lives of all beings, whether embryo or egg, water or land, flying or swimming, hidden or roaming, all are slaughtered; delighting the heart and pleasing the eye, without repentance or change. If such faults exist, I begin with them in repentance.

Some use flowery speech, slander good men, stir up strife among kin and friends, fan animosity among neighbors, causing hatred within and without, estrangement far and near, engendering enmity and plotting harm. If such faults exist, I begin with them in repentance.

Some covet and amass worldly wealth, never satisfied; crafty and cutting; face-to-face oppressing and deceiving; taking from others while sparing themselves; harming others to benefit oneself; neglecting the poor and needy; devoted to avarice. If such faults exist, I begin with them in repentance.

Some receive the Law teachings but are not diligent or earnest, seeking profit for self, lacking benevolent thought; feigning expediency, deceiving men and gods; taking merit money, selfishly misusing it, without shame or remorse, fearing not the future. If such faults exist, today I with utmost sincerity repent and return to the Three Treasures.

With utmost sincerity open the vow:

May the disciples henceforth, having repented, their meritorious deeds be such that from birth to birth and life to life they forever depart from avarice and greed; no thoughts of deceit or robbery; constantly practising beneficence and kindness; arising the heart of compassion; broadly constructing bridges and ferries; saving and delivering all kinds; heavenly people sufficing; harmony above and below; merit and retribution adorned in all lives; longevity complete. May all the four births and six destinies alike accord good affinities, together attain the wondrous gate, and accomplish the supreme Way.

Having opened the vow, return and revere the Three Treasures.

Thus throughout the void pervading the Dharma realm all Three Treasures, turning to them and repenting. The disciples from countless kalpas past until today, whether former life or this, not knowing cause and effect, encountering events contrary and wrong, conduct reversed, mingling with the dust worldly, without equal-heartedness, thus among the common folk, with depraved acts, estranged from family, favouring others, falsely continuing lineage and name, boasting to be heroes, licentious in sexual desire, unrighteously covetous, frightening and robbing the ignorant, invading good governance, lightly deceiving the aged and infirm, oppressing the orphans and widows. Some in their households day and night oppress and drive servants and concubines, unjustly flogging, riding horses and driving oxen, unmindful of hunger and hardship, harboring evil thoughts, uttering wild words, affronting spirits, reviling wind and cursing rain, without cause cursing and cursing, arbitrarily committing human faults, this world and next life receiving various calamities and burdens. Such sins are countless and boundless; today with utmost sincerity all repent.

Disciples receive obstruction and vexation, conduct faults; some drunken and stupefied, affronting rank and low, speaking heresies and wild words, fraudulent and excessive, seeking wrongs and evils; flattering and twisting to create feelings, violating the two graces, constantly deceiving and usurping. Some set up scriptures and images, lacking incense; with unclean hands, read numinous writings, touching unclean bodies, approaching the Law seat, gathering fasts but not practicing charity, receiving offerings without shame; borrowing debts and breaking contracts, not repaying loans, multiplying interest usury. Such sins are countless and boundless; today with utmost sincerity all repent.

Disciples hold to birth and death two conditions; the body is of the common man, ignorance and obstruction; not knowing compassion and patience; nature delighting in injury. Some wrongly worship ghosts and gods, flattering guests and companions, and at male-female marriages, village festivals and seasonal times, broadly prepare kitchens, freely cooking and killing blood and flesh, flavours full of shame, fats to continue, lamps burning all night, calamities boundless, difficult to reckon; enemies and creditors in the dark path, lawsuits without end, dragging life and death; thus souls imprisoned in nine nights, spirits bound in three poisons, washing and cleansing having no gate, seeking mercy no path. Carefully should one set up fasts and images, reveal sincere heart; the merits and good affinities obtained return to former enemies and past debts. May they receive blessings, entrust to human and heavenly protection, forever abandon evil affinities, not to contend or oppose; more than the four births and six destinies, broadly bestowing mercy; if seeing impending danger and distress, various evil sufferings, conveniently rescue and relieve, causing deliverance. Then to expound the subtle and correct Dharma, open the cause of salvation, so that one sees the form and shadow, hears the name and voice, fear and terror all removed, vexations scattered, obtaining such, utterly at peace and joy. Having repented, turn and revere the Three Treasures.

With utmost sincerity make vow:

May disciples in life and death two generations, receiving this repentance and the meritorious deeds established, from birth to birth, life to life, forever depart the three poisons, constantly cultivate the ten virtues, cause cause and effect retribution to be adorned, merit and virtue all complete, a thousand calamities henceforth abandoned, myriad felicitations hence attained; wondrous wisdom assist body and mind, holyÂäüÂ¢ûÂØøÁÆó, ancestors of nine generations all bathed in the Way's grace, wash the mind at the numinous ford, wander on the shore of the divine Way, untroubled true realm, scattered and non-action, all with affinity depart suffering and achieve liberation. Having made the vow, return and revere the Three Treasures.
