The Azure Essential Emperor Lord is a disciple of the Nine-Yang Primordial Emperor Jade Sovereign, born in the first year of the Middle Sovereign, in the eastern quarter, when Heaven first proclaimed brightness. The Lord was nurtured in the Mysterious Hill Jade Kingdom, in the limitless Heaven, beneath the Seven Treasures of the Jade Forest, beside the borders of the Nine Regions in the Mysterious and Obscure. By the law of transformation and response, at the third daybreak, his surname was Yao, his given name was Bo-kai. Beside him stood the Lord of Nine Dragons with Wings; seven-coloured jade phoenixes shaded his person; divine scales contained the Ganoderma for mysterious nourishment; heavenly maidens emitted essence to observe the true; jade youths cast blossoms to repel filth; divine consorts scattered fragrance to dispel dust; he held breath in gestation. His law was naturally elegant; he wore a floral crown of two-six; his face and hair were like golden splendour; his body bore spirit talismans; his speech was like golden edicts; seventy-two colours shone, reflecting the jade purity; three dawns revealed lovely scenes; six vital airs were in harmony. A mysterious cloud with a purple canopy arose from his chamber; flying essence and streaming light illuminated his courtyard; he alone held the true in his control, serene and joyous in spirit, orderly and harmonious in appearance, following the changes of rise and fall. He dwelt in the bright realm of the morning clouds, wandered the ruins of the jade kingdom, holding the strategy of the Primordial Emperor, settled upon the hill of the nine regions at sunset.

Carefree and wandering, passing through countless kalpas, he returned to the pure fasting cloud chamber, with purple clouds as roof, azure mists as walls, golden halls, white jade beds, where five vital airs intermingled, high terraces connected by eaves, jade steps with inscriptions, four phoenix towers, golden youths attending, jade blossoms holding scarves, celestial maidens arrayed in protection numbering over five thousand, ready for Heaven’s hunt; feathered riders in multitudes like scales; dragons and tigers warding off evil, pair by pair crouching; the nine assemblies of mysterious qi, spiritual winds raising smoke, fragrant scents stirring Heaven, a palace born of emptiness, flowing essence and jade light, reflecting ten Heavens, lofty and serene, independently composing spiritual chapters, consuming essence, swallowing qi, chewing the mysterious root, taking elixirs and returning to white jade wine, golden liquid flowing essence, jade forest forming blossoms, sun and moon as imperial springs, refining bones and changing marrow, the whole body becoming true.

The Primordial Yang Emperor Jade Sovereign at that time rode a carriage of nine phoenixes in blue mist, jade wheels and feathered canopy, following the thousand true桑林, ten thousand chariots and myriad riders, flying with thirty-six attendant immortals, feasting in the celestial court, descending to the Lord. Together ascending the capital of the nine elder immortals, the chamber of nine twists, ordering the Western Platform’s Turtle Mother to open the clouds and phoenix’s mystery, a purple brocade pouch, producing the purple scripture of true formulas and jade chapters to entrust to the Lord. The Lord cultivated the path completely, attaining the jade clarity rank, the Supreme Great Dao Lord bestowed upon him the flying cloud feathered canopy, flowing purple phoenix edicts, golden true jade light illuminating the seven primordial golden divine tiger talisman, flowing golden fire bells, azure essence jade seal, nine-coloured seamless emblem, single azure feather skirt, flying and ascending Supreme Clarity.

Thus he freely displayed myriad changes, revolving five dawns, directing emptiness and summoning the moon, capturing the sun and raising the wheel, transforming through the cavern, sharing spirit with the true, resolving form and altering shape, countless beings revered, ascending the three origins, paying homage at the jade palace, roaming the limitless, descending to the nine Heavens, entering and exiting the cavern gate, carrying contracts with jade immortals, reverently responding to the High Supreme Primordial True, harmonizing qi and obeying destiny, holding the position of Emperor of the Dawn, commanding myriad Dao, all immortals connected to him, governing the spirits of the Ten Heavenly Mountains, rivers and sources, Five Peaks and Four Seas, none not subject to the Lord. Always flying on the usual plan in the purple void, with golden name in the azure palace, the purple scripture cannot be seen, the golden root cannot be heard.

Azure Essential is another title of the Purple Clarity Emperor Lord, who received from the Primordial Emperor Jade Sovereign the wonderful secret formulas of the purple scripture, which are all essentials of the collection of scriptures, secret above the nine Heavens, recording concealed writings of the eight assemblies. The Jade Sovereign commanded the High Supreme Worthy True Lord to compile and collect the precious titles and compose the collection of scriptures, written with a purple brush, bound in golden orchid covers, all arising from the Way of the Supreme Emperor of Ancient Mystery, composed by the High Sage, collected into volumes, transmitted to the Azure Essential Emperor Lord, who transmitted to the Supreme Virtual Primordial Spirit Lord, who transmitted to the Supreme Primordial Lord of Great Essence and Luminous Cavern, who transmitted to the Northern Pole Supreme Primordial Lord, who transmitted to the Jade Sovereign Lord, who transmitted to the Supreme Celestial Emperor Lord of the Great Subtlety, who transmitted to the Later Sage Nine Profound Emperor Lord, who transmitted to the Prime Minister Azure Youth Lord, who holds the registers in the jade palace. Those with predestined fate and responses seeing this text are assuredly of profound excellence and must have divine immortals to confirm their registers. The Jade Sovereign’s precious secret is not transmitted to the world; those who falsely speak of it are pierced by the nine Heavens’ spies and reported to the Emperor Lord, charging the offender with crime; the Supreme Lord dispatches the five Emperor Divine Soldiers to punish the body; death as a lowly ghost, filling rivers and sources; seven ancestors suffer water torment. Students should be careful and observe secrecy and reverence.

All who cultivate the Way of the Sun’s Radiance in the Mysterious, if the sky is overcast and no sun is seen, may also practice in a separate chamber, but swallow qi double that of midday, to eighty-one breaths. The mirror must be kept clear and bright, no dust or filth allowed, no one else may use the mirror, this is the greatest taboo. If three persons view the mirror, then the youth of the sun and the two red essences descend, causing loss of sight and spirit, beware carefully.

This method is often practiced by the Queen Mother of the West, who taught it to the Azure Essential Emperor Lord, who taught it to the Lu woman, who transmitted it to the Sun Maiden. The Sun Maiden practices it constantly in the world, penetrating the mysterious void, face issuing golden light, aged seven hundred years, the years of harmony, people call her seventeen or eighteen. She often rides flying phoenixes to roam the world, also watching over those on the Way, sometimes descending with true qi, those with predestined affinity sometimes meet and awaken to it, gaining connection to true form, then can fly.

On that day, within one hour, heaven commands troops, myriad true beings assemble at the pavilion, five stars move their positions, ten heavens vibrate together, to cultivate the Way of the Sun’s Radiance in the Mysterious. On that day, expose the courtyard, take clear water in a jar, the body holding a sword, face water and face the sun, knock teeth thirty-six times, call aloud:

Sun radiance youth, yang light red essence, shining net true person, shadow within jade spirit, passing through destiny riding qi, up and down solemnly clear, yin officials plotting within, invading the sun court, heaven commands troops, imperial ministers aiding soldiers, three five standing upright, yang light illuminating clearly, heaven and earth feeding in turn, who dares to act, all return to their places, no harm to deficiency or excess, jade emperor commands, none not reverent and still.

Finished, then swallow twenty-four breaths upwards and stop. Thus heaven and earth restore their places, three five shine together, the youth is pleased, sun radiance returns spirit, flowing light mysterious injection, moulding and descending the body, then register the name in the purple slip, record in the jade clarity chapters, within nine years, one obtains to ride the green carriage, riding the void and empty, flying in Supreme Clarity.

The Purple Scripture Formula says: On the day of a lunar eclipse, that evening the yin qi declines, yang qi fills, divisions add, two images oppose, these are all heaven and earth’s separation and union of sun and moon qi. Riding on the evening of the moon’s decline, invading and plotting against the true qi. At that time, the five stars and constellations of the imperial dawn division command the troops of the moon’s department. On that evening, go out to the courtyard, take a jar of clear water, the body holding a sword, face water and face the moon, knock teeth sixteen times, call aloud:

Heaven and earth separate and unite, bearing qi riding decline, invading and consuming the moon’s abode, up affecting yellow brightness, imperial ministers wield staves, jade dawn capturing falsehood, heavenly soldiers surrounding the domain, divine lords displaying power, who dares to act, attaching to shadow riding on subtlety, quickly return to original place, no violation allowed.

Finished, the lunar eclipse dissipates, heavenly brightness is clear, three five shine together, myriad palaces are peaceful. The moon middle true person consort’s spirit light is pleased and joyful, returning spirit mysterious reflection, descending to the person’s emotions, then record to the Northern Emperor, register the person’s death name, note in the Supreme Clarity palace jade chapters, provide twelve jade maidens to attend the person. Nine years thus, obtain to ride flying mist, ascending to the moon court. This Way is most wondrous and subtle, not practiced in the world, those who obtain it hold it secret, carefully transmitting. This Emperor Lord Purple Scripture highest method was practiced by Wang Lingzi, whose neck often issued purple light, illumining ten li about, eyes had flowing essence, like stars shining, face issuing golden splendour, blazing at night the void brightness, commanding twelve golden youths of the sun and twelve jade maidens of the moon. Its method is most secret, must not lightly transmit. If the sky is overcast and the sun and moon unseen, also practice indoors, but on this day the secret plotting is hidden, must be rescued in proper brightness.

The Purple Scripture Formula says: All who cultivate Supreme Clarity Way, but cannot yet soar to the bright sky court, nor ride the purple void, yet desire to study, though relying on secluded hills, long fasting and remote forests, still cannot escape the calamity of the Yang Nine, inherited in the Tang years.

### Volume Two of the Collection of Scriptures of the Golden Roots in the Purple Scripture of the Essential Azure of the Supreme Clarity of the Perfected Cavern

Compiled by the Prime Minister Azure Youth Lord

Scripture of the Primordial Heavenly King

The Primordial Heavenly King receives the heavenly natural lineage, forms his shape in the undifferentiated mist, entrusts his body to the void born fetus, is born at the interval of emptiness and cavern. At the time when the mysterious brightness was not yet divided, heaven’s light was obscure and vast, immense and boundless great void. Accumulating more than seven thousand kalpas, heaven was bright and qi clear, two rays intertwined, a mysterious purple canopy reflected upon his head, the six qi’s lightning wings his spirit, born by night self-illuminated, divine light illuminating the chamber, dispersing fragrant smoke of void, dwelling the heart in sky mist realm, refining countenance at the border of the cavern, riding alone on the spirit talisman’s rhythm, resisting mysterious descending edicts, internal qi at the mysterious cliff, extravagant imaginations in the hidden depths, suddenly carefree, flowing and wandering forgetting revolutions, jade wheels and jade carriage, blue chariot and mysterious dragon, flying essence streaming mist, shining lightning in the void palace, eastward roaming the blue water luxuriant forest realm, resting above the blue mist nine twisting chamber, advancing to the golden gate, receiving the title of Jade Clarity Purple Void High Supreme Primordial. The Supreme Great Dao Lord’s golden slips and jade tags make records of the Eastern Splendour various azure palaces, commanding the governance of myriad crossings, mysterious descending jade blossom maidens and golden dawn youths, each three thousand, flying dragons and poisonous beasts, giant qilin ten thousand feet tall, fierce heavenly beasts clawing, all guarding the jade gates, heavenly might resplendent, arrayed in the great court, flying azure feathered canopies, flowing purple phoenix edicts, golden true jade light, revealing the seven origins, divine tiger upper talisman, flowing golden fire bells, compiling the primordial emperor, position ascending jade clarity, holding the Supreme Emperor High Sovereign’s truth, Dao complete and qi clear, also praising the spiritual chapters thirty-nine, jade wisdom stirring phrases, unfolding endlessly, wondrous sounds issuing from primordial heaven, jade echoes opening the cavern gate. Hence it is titled The Great Cavern True Scripture of Ability to Write. Its Way is supremely honored, born together with the Primordial Beginning, the High Supreme wondrous transformation, measure difficult to surpass, flowing sound countless myriads without ceasing, scripture renewed after ten thousand kalpas, without golden slips and jade names, not to be studied or heard. Later disciples with diligent aspiration, abandon burdens and forget dust, silent heart in long hills, facing bright sky morning, pure fasting and bitter recitations, weary but daring not to sleep, petitioning golden slips and jade tags, recording names in Jade Clarity, then receiving The Great Cavern Scripture Formula, standing at the three origins, voice startling the nine heavens. Those who obtain this chapter, roots of Supreme Truth, have golden slips and petition tags, jade officials named Eastern Splendour, become true persons, chambers summon void-born brightness, halls descend hundred harmonies of smoke, jade blossoms attending, golden dawn guarding form, penetrating the utmost cliff of heaven, cooperating the three lights to pass truth, directing the five dawns to drive the chariot, commanding flying dragons to ride wheels, ascending the Three Essentials’ palace, paying homage before the Great Emperor. The High Supreme Primordial bestowed, the Supreme Great Dao’s utmost truth, subtle is the Primordial Beginning spiritual transformation secret text, entrusted to the Prime Minister Azure Youth Lord, who holds the registry of Eastern Splendour, to pass to later sages those to become true persons. Its Way is a treasured secret, not transmitted to later ages, lightly revealing the divine text, body serves dark sources, calamity affects seven mysteries, long serving low ghosts, no immortality granted.

The Prime Minister Azure Youth Lord says: The golden slips and jade tags arise from the palace of the Supreme Spiritual Capital, carved in jade as tags, bound in gold as slips, written in vermilion characters, tied with purple cords, always shaded by mysterious clouds and purple canopy in his chamber, hundred harmonies incense scattering the courtyard, commanding Western Blossom jade maidens and Golden Dawn youths each three hundred to guard the spiritual texts. The Primordial Heavenly King received from the Supreme Great Dao Lord, its truth and formulas transmitted once every seven hundred years for three transmissions. All disciples, even if not yet attaining this text, have names reversed registered in Azure Palace, but lack golden slips and jade characters only. Leading immortals, attendants and recorders constantly examine subtle and gross; those diligent and aspirant are all allowed to be mysteriously instructed this text, petitioning names to Jade Emperor and Eastern Splendour Azure Palace; the Supreme Great one will send perfected persons to bestow their true scriptures. Later sages and all true persons all first petition slips in Eastern Splendour, cast jade tags in Supreme Clarity, then receive The Great Cavern Scripture, pure fasting and bitter practice, then become true persons. Novice disciples having no golden slips recorded in Azure Palace, jade registers have no mysterious binding names, divine scriptures cannot be obtained nor bestowed, those heavenly demons also cannot be subdued, true spirits never descend, jade maidens do not guard the person. Now therefore order the Supreme Emperor’s formula, copy and collect by ranks, to open the way for later learners. Those with heart should increase fasting, supervise diligent aspiration, focus on the profound true, deeply move the Jade Emperor, petition slips in Azure Palace, then may recite divine scriptures, understand mysteries, the Supreme Great one will dispatch cinnabar carriages and flying canopies to come to receive the person ascending jade clarity. Yet this scripture’s prohibitions are especially strict, not to lightly transmit, those not true receiving it, calamity hits seven mysteries, body suffers wind blade punishment.
