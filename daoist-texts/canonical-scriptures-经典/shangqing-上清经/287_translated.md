### The Scripture of the Great Emperor Taiwei of Supreme Clarity of the Cavern of Truth, Walking the Heavenly Ropes and Flying the Earthly Records

The black star is the soul and spirit of the Northern Dipper. When one desires to walk the ropes, first close the qi, and turn to the left three times beyond the seven stars, moving above the soul and spirit of the Dipper three laps; then ascend to Yangming. If the disciple wishes to truly walk the Dipper, the soul and spirit have a rope, bending and twisting as they follow; thus one attains ascent to the Jade Hall.

Walk the Three Terraces; following the Jade Rope of Yu's step, close the qi and ascend to the Golden Rope, going to and fro nine times; knock the teeth three times and make the qi flow. Then come the names of the altars of blessing, and the wishes as one desires. If one seeks fields and lands, bless the Upper Altar; if one seeks rank and office, bless the Middle Altar; if one seeks gold and jade, bless the Lower Altar. Commonly use the six Jia days; this is a distinctive method, not always to be practiced. The Upper Altar is named Void Essence; the Middle Altar, Six Purities; the Lower Altar, Curved Life. These are all names.

The Way of the Great Supreme Flying Five Stars is to seek the steps of Water and Fire Five Stars descending, bringing the divine cloud chariot and feathered canopy, ascending the technique of the Great Void, the method of Gu Xizi. Close the qi and ascend the rope; swallow saliva fifteen times; each time reaching a star place, bow the left hand over the heart, and say: 'Flying Immortal, two words only.' Before ascending the rope, first keep the essence of the Five Stars in the Five Viscera. At each completion of a rope step, press and perform this; fourteen years, the dragon flies by day. One must reach above the foot-letter; this is the diagram of the rope.

The Later Sage Sovereign gave the book of the Three Officials and Earth Gods, wearing it while walking the ropes and flying as Immortals, ascending to the Supreme Peace Emperor. The Great Jade Emperor gave the talisman of the Seven Stars,朱書 'vermillion writings' of the eight sectional days; wear it, bearing a talisman on the crown of the head, to be used by those who walk the ropes as Immortals.

The Great Hidden Writings that secure the Jade Emperor's Pendant on the left,

The Great Hidden Writings that secure the Jade Maiden's Pendant on the right.

The above talismans are all in vermillion script.

The Great Hidden Writings relate that the Great Emperor Taiwei formerly bestowed upon the Supreme Clarity Cavern True Lord the Walking of the Heavenly Rope and Flying the Earth Records, according to the mysterious Dipper, climbing the Star Chief, joining the Nine Truths, riding the Flying Dragon, wandering the Three Lifespans, floating the Three Lives, solidifying the Three Treasures, releasing the Six Harmfulnesses, concealing the Six Yin, entering the Six Absolute, guarding the Heavenly Heroes, keeping the Extension, preserving the Original Support, treading the Great Assistant, circulating the Elixir Chamber, ascending to Wen Chang, turning about the Nine Paths, taking the position of the Nine Elders, practising for twenty years, receiving the book to become a Supreme Clarity Perfected.

The High Lord Tai Su, and the Eight Elders of Supreme Clarity, taught the twenty-nine Perfected of Mysterious Continent, to ascend to the Langfeng Terrace. The Later Sage Sovereign came to the Golden Morning Hua Gate of Supreme Clarity, entrusting it to the Court Youth Lords, commanding that the register of Immortal names and bones be taught; those with jade characters in the true register have attained the Way, and return the scripture to the chamber of the Court Youth Lords, then receive the book and ascend Taiwei. Ordinary men regard the Seven Stars as near, but know not that the walking is very far. If a Daoist knows that the Heavenly Rope can be walked but knows not the soul and spirit, he does not pursue his body. It is not that the body will not bring the soul and spirit, but the soul and spirit fear the might of the Seven Stars, and dare not pursue the body upwards. Therefore, when the Three Souls are not gathered, and the Seven Spirits are scattered, it is vain to walk the rope with an empty corpse, for the spirit does not follow me, and it is truly labour in vain. If you wish to walk the rope, clear your heart and be tranquil, think not of sorrow or worry, do not contemplate honour or taste; then turn three laps, ascend the star and open the blessing, so that the two spirits of soul and spirit both pass the spiritual barrier, suddenly loosening the body, swiftly forgetting oneself in pure cleanliness, then step as if treading air. One year wards off calamity, two years wards off war, three years wards off death, four years earth Immortal, a thousand harms and myriad evils none dare assail; from then onward blessings and happiness are without limit, bringing forth divine power and spiritual efficacy, harnessing and driving the flying dragon. Tai Chi bestows the ganoderma; the Jade Emperor grants youth. Practise for twenty-seven years, and become a Supreme Clarity Perfected.

The method of walking the rope forbids transverse walking across the heavenly ropes. The straight strokes that connect the boundaries of the stars are called the ropes. To violate and cross the heavenly ropes transversely is to sever the heavenly Way; it is a great prohibition.

Do not tread upon the Perfected's stars while walking the rope; this is a great taboo. To violate these two is to remove the cap, kowtow, and apologise to the rope images. Make the rope of cloth or silk, length nine feet, breadth six feet, and arrange the star positions upon the silk; use blue brush for stars, vermillion brush for the ropes; keep it in a clean box; whenever intending to practise, burn incense and bring it out. Attending to the book are seven Jade Maidens; guarding the stars are seven Jade Youths. To walk the world's paths together with the vulgar, who also traverse the roads and fields, among them the flying dust is in disorder, the mire and filth the same track; these cannot walk the rope. If though one dwells in the world, yet all walk roads and ride carriages, and the eyes do not see flowing blood or dead corpses, one may walk the rope. If one dwells in mountains and forests, observing long fasts, severing ties with the human world, or dwelling in caves and seclusion, taking food but no grain, then the avoidance of dusty paths is not to be considered. Avoid eating the meat of the six domestic animals, and the five pungent vegetables. All must bathe and wear clean clothes, burn incense where the rope is walked, and observe the Northern Dipper star positions, bowing the head and placing the hands accordingly. Bathing is said to be the beginning of walking the rope; it is not necessary to bathe after every single rope walk; the key is to make the hands, feet, mouth, and face most pure and flourishing. If the sky is overcast, one may practise in a quiet chamber, for example on the bed on which one lies. Also, walking the rope at noon is especially better than at midnight; both are not good to be seen by others while practising. Only avoid going through filth; be pure in heart.

The Great Emperor Taiwei teaches the scripture of walking the heavenly ropes according to the careful method of the True Spirit. First burn incense in the place of the action, close the qi, turn to the left three laps outside the Dipper stars, starting at Yin essence, circling Yangming. When finished, open the qi, and then the feet may tread upon the seven stars, on the body, stepping on Yangming only. Then facing the Yang star, again close the qi, and with the heart pray: 'Yangming Great Chief, Mysterious Extreme Wen Chang, send such and such soul and spirit to wander the heavenly ropes.' When the prayer is finished, the left foot treads Yangming; then the right foot steps Yin essence, with the heart praying: 'Yin essence North Pivot, Great Supreme Xuan Ji, send such and such soul and spirit to follow the body.' Next the left foot treads Xuanming, heart praying: 'Xuanming Shaking Light, Zi Wei Kai Yang, send such and such soul and spirit to walk the Jade Balance.' Next the right foot treads Dan Yuan, heart praying: 'Dan Yuan Purple Palace, Great Supreme Spiritual Field, send such and such soul and spirit to pass the Divine Ford.' Next the left foot treads the North Pole, heart praying: 'North Pole Heavenly Light, returning to Xuan Chen, send such and such soul and spirit to reach the Mysterious Pass.' Next the right foot treads the Heavenly Pass; then the left foot advances to join the right foot, then the breath connects. If breath is closed without completing the rope, one may open again above the Dan Yuan star. A slight prayer is said:

'Metal, wood, water, fire, earth, the Five Elements push one another; the Seven Stars shine brightly, the Heavenly Ropes most mighty; the auxiliary stars guard prosperity, the assistant stars repel decline; the Nine Truths are the Great Supreme, Tai Chi and Taiwei; the Three Courts Jade Emperor, the Three Honoured who repel calamity; Heaven moves and Earth turns, soul and spirit attend; make me a flying immortal, true light lingering; name entered in the golden chamber, the jade gate opens; riding the dragon ascending the void; sun and moon shine together; wandering Supreme Clarity; ringing bells and green robes; left grasping streaming lightning, right ruling rushing thunder; ten thousand evils on earth fall dead, none dare pursue; evil hearts see me, make you be broken and shattered; Imperial command, Jade Maidens attend, guarding and bringing me home; soul, spirit, true essence, united in form ascending to fly.'

The method of reverse walking ends at the Heavenly Pass, turning towards the North Pole, a slight prayer is said:

'Great Supreme Original Spirit, Flowery Canopy Purple Spirit, North Pole Jade Chamber, storing the transformation essence; Taiwei Mysterious Terrace, Nine Truth Jade City, I desire to be a flying immortal, to reach the Cloud Court; to reverse walk the heavenly ropes, soul and spirit both living, riding the Dragon Flower Palace, obtaining the name of the Way; left wearing jade pendants, right waist golden bells, tiger belt and dragon skirt, whistling commanding heavenly soldiers, riding the three pure lights, flying to ascend Supreme Clarity.'

When the prayer is finished, close the qi, raise the left foot to tread the North Pole, right foot the Dan Yuan, next raise the left foot to tread before Xuanming, right foot joins the left, and faces the Perfected star; breath connects, a slight prayer is said:

'Tai Chi Nine Essences, Upper Emperor High Perfected, emerging to ascend the Original Clear, entering to conceal the Mysterious Yin, nurturing such and such long life, making such and such fond of immortality; the Jade Terrace suddenly opens, Golden Hall eight gates; beg to wear the book; Crimson Dragon, Blue Skirt; assisting Zi Wei; Later Sage Sovereign; riding ten flying dragons; Mysterious Canopy and Radiant Clouds; arranged name Origin Diagram; sun and moon together.'

When the prayer is finished, again close the qi, left foot treads Assistant Star, advance right foot treads Yin essence, advance left foot treads Yangming before, right foot joins left, breath connects, slight prayer said:

'Heavenly Chief Right Yang, Dipper movement low and high, front turning original machine, back moving spiritual ropes; restrain the soul for peace, hold the spirit for health; soul and spirit with the body, all walking the heavenly court, facing the Golden Gate, High Supreme Great Emperor, right supporting Immortal Mother, left supporting Immortal Lord; purple and green flying flowers, dragon robe tiger garment, wearing true turban jade, neck bearing round light, hands holding divine bell, waist wearing golden pendant; mouth chanting Cavern Truth, seven transformations wondrous chapter; first from void and nothingness, born to be king; flying the nine paths, holding the Dipper and climbing the ropes; front following Taiyi, back following Mysterious Lang; telling such and such the secret formula, sitting standing dying; reverse walking to the essentials; position as Immortal Minister; Five viscera self-generating, greeting Heaven; wishes all fulfilled, requests prosper; myriad evils subdued and concealed; if Heaven strikes me, water extinguishes fire.'

The method of reverse walking again closes the qi, turning right three laps outside the Dipper stars, beginning at Yangming, circling Yangming, breath connects, prayer said:

'High Supreme Great Truth, Seven Luminaries Most High, reverse walking seeking life, ascending the Heavenly Origin, making me a flying immortal, entering the Purple Gate.'

Then again close qi, left foot treads Yangming, right foot treads Yin essence; first right foot treads before Xuanming, left foot treads Dan Yuan; next right foot treads North Pole, left foot treads Heavenly Pass; right foot before joins left; breath connects; prayer said:

'Seven transformations reverse spinning, ascending the Jade constellation, six records assisting me, three ropes united in walking; Jade Emperor looks left, High Supreme looks right, teaching me to ride stars, soaring to ascend the mysterious road; beg to grant flying immortal, immortal blessings; floating walking Supreme Clarity; riding Hua three pure; gold, blue and green skirts; entering and exiting nine dwellings; North Emperor bows, South Truth thanks; name inscribed in Immortal Terrace; thousand transformations myriad changes; gaining friend Sage Sovereign, Supreme Peace assisting; wishes follow the heart, all affairs accomplished; if any evil to me, knife punishment fire grave.'

The three paths of forward, reverse, and return walking all finished, then raise both feet together, stepping on Yangming star; with right hand pat the heart, left hand point to Xuanming star; close breath three breaths; knock teeth three times seven; swallow saliva three times nine; called "Holding the Dipper." Slight prayer said:

'Yangming Purple Qi, Tai Su Mysterious Chen, Golden Gate Yellow Chamber, within is Great God; left pats Upper Emperor, right holds High Perfected; dragon carrying green robe, flying brocade tiger pattern; waist wearing jade talisman, head wearing lotus crown; going out without entering the void; golden truth jade light; spiritual noble towering; called Yangming; feet treading vermilion smoke; mouth chanting cavern chapters; bestow such and such hidden book; taught to walk the ropes; three rounds circulating; holding the Dipper forgetting self; make me flying immortal; transcend the void floating in air; name inscribed Supreme Clarity; riding the mysterious dragon chariot; mind where it goes; wishes all follow; Three Honoured unite virtue; soul and spirit internally communicate; give to divine officers; jade maidens and jade youths; if any evil to such and such, shape like lightning and wind; wicked plots cut off tongues; exiled to ten directions.' When prayer is finished, keep in the heart suddenly, forget the body long and descend.

When the method of Holding the Dipper is finished, raise both feet together on Yin essence star; left hand pat the heart, right hand point to Perfected star; close qi three breaths; knock teeth three times through; swallow saliva three times; named "Climbing the Chief to enter Taiwei." Slight incantation:

'Yin essence Mysterious Su, Flowery Gate Life Door, within is Jade Emperor; North Pole Most High; phoenix embroidered flowery collar; dragon green jade skirt; waist tiger wearing bells; supporting ganoderma red crown; called Yin Essence, Great Supreme Lord; grants such and such hidden book; to walk the seven origins; climb the Chief and ascend; then wander spiritual barrier; outer restrains seven spirits; inner controls three souls; spirit refines earthly encumbrance; soul treasures fetal spirit; soul and spirit guard body; together with it Immortal; flying Supreme Clarity; returning qi youthful countenance; wherever goes as heart; myriad desires no difficulty; if any evil to such and such, shape dies at Three Officials; might restrains Six Heavens; commanding myriad spirits.'

When the method of climbing the Chief is finished, raise both feet together on Assistant star, both feet facing the Perfected star; after four prostrations, kneel and close qi four breaths, knock teeth four times through, swallow saliva four times; named "Connecting the Perfected." Regulate the heart; from the Chief enter and ascend Assistant star; do not cross the rope sideways. Kneeling, slight prayer said:

'Tai Chi Nine Essences; Upper Origin Bright Truth; regulate the mechanism and hold balance; exhale and inhale purple smoke; golden light jade reflection; power illuminating ten heavens; controlling the three lights; adjusting yang and harmonizing yin; regulating original distributing qi; changing the old to new; governing the middle constellation; mysterious pass of mystery; golden chamber jade door; northern wing four sides; sending forth chariots eight scenes; floating and roaming Taiyuan; dragon brocade phoenix robes; tiger green flying skirts; crimson banner green pennants; purple feathers seven edges; waist wearing divine talisman; head wearing supporting crown; ascending to the nine voids; descending to heavenly abyss; self-called Jade Emperor; Nine Heavens Supreme Truth; pitying such and such fond of the Way; granting such and such hidden chapters; personally ascending Assistant and Chief; paying homage to spiritual lords; begging for elixir book; before life; obtaining governance of three heavens; flying and walking eight mysteries; five viscera self-generating; upper grade flying immortal; receiving wings from Jade Emperor; Later Sage's minister; position high grand master; riding clouds flying wheels; wishes all fulfilled; myriad evils none interfere; if evil to me, break form and burst gate.'

When the method of connecting the Perfected is finished, raise both feet together on Xuanming star; right hand pat the heart, left hand point to Dan Yuan star; close qi three breaths; knock teeth three times seven through; swallow saliva three times; called "Northern Dipper." Slight prayer said:

'Cavern Heaven divine light; returning conceals Xuanming; qi filling the great void; coming and going without form; concealing heaven and hiding earth; circulating and irrigating without birth; suddenly ascending heavenly ropes; stepping on the purple court; looking north at thunder chamber; looking south at lightning city; dazzling changes myriad; no longer the former form; vague flowing light; poke hand established; desiring to hide self; obtain my name; void arrogant and lofty; nine transformations Xuanming; sitting up six Jia; visiting and registering Six Ding; granting such and such hidden book; walking the Dipper star; looking up to Upper Emperor; putting on cinnabar kerchief blue; holding spiritual light; waist wearing jade bell; ascending begging flying immortal; born with heaven; name inscribed Taiwei; floating walking Supreme Clarity; descending begging transformation; concealing light recording form; myriad affairs as wished; all crushed and pacified; if evil to me, strike with divine weapon.'

The Tai Chi True Scripture Golden Root Superior Text says: 'When you ascend Xuanming, walking the Dipper hiding form, if you wish to transform, you must get my name; turning the heavens and moving the earth, myriad things come into being. When walking Xuanming, and when wishing to hide, keep this name in mind.'

When the method of walking the Dipper is finished, raise both feet together on Dan Yuan star; left hand pat the heart, right hand point to North Pole star; close qi three breaths; knock teeth three times through; swallow saliva three times; called "Treading the Record." Slight prayer said:

'Great Supreme Nine Terraces; Dan Yuan Mysterious Records; outer governs North Pivot; inner corrects heavenly principle; Golden Gate shines outside; Jade Court shines within; inside is the Most High; called Red Child; governing in Dan Yuan; within the crimson chamber; green clouds embroidered flowers; dragon robe tiger garment; right holding Imperial Register; left grasping Chief Rope; feet treading radiant clouds; head wearing purple crown; right wearing flowing bells; left girded with jade gong; bestow such and such hidden book; treading records wandering; ascending begging flying immortal; riding mysterious dragon chariot; book named Dan Terrace; Tai Chi Jade Hall; wherever going and seeking; blessings and emoluments come to greet; if evil to such and such, pray for destruction; give serving divine officers; jade maidens and jade youths.'

When the method of treading the Record is finished, raise both feet together on North Pole star; right hand pat the heart, left hand point to Heavenly Pass star; close qi three breaths; knock teeth three times through; swallow saliva three times; called "Walking the Rope." Slight prayer said:

'Mysterious High Taiwei; North Pole Purple Canopy; below is the Great Truth; roaming and flying nine outside; green flowers flying skirts; golden bells blue belts; waist wearing jade light; mysterious clouds dense and dark; bestow such and such hidden book; ascending walking seven qi; ascending pure play smoke; Perfected meeting; begging for flying immortal; book named Dan Chamber; wherever going as wished; no calamities no harm; if evil to me, cause their damage and ruin.'

When the method of walking the rope is finished, raise both feet together on Heavenly Pass star; right hand pat the heart, left hand point to Heavenly Pass; close qi three breaths; knock teeth three times through; swallow saliva three times; called "Riding the Dragon." Slight prayer said:

'Great Supreme Seven Extremes; Ziwei Absolute Star; precious mysterious golden chamber; outside is the Jade Gate; circulating through nine palaces; adjusting and harmonizing Heavenly Pass; inside is the Revered God; called Purple Emperor; granting such and such hidden book; carrying such and such riding dragon; ascending wandering nine heavens; descending flying earth origin; radiant clouds cinnabar chariot; mysterious flowers green robes; waist wearing dragon tablet; head scarf tiger pattern; encompassing life of myriad things; instructing flying immortals; freeing such and such death name; heaven and earth long enduring; riding dragon walking Dipper; wherever going receiving grace; if evil to me, wind knife fire blaze.'

When the method of wandering the Three Lifespans is finished, return walking to the Assistant star; raise both feet together; close qi one breath; knock teeth three times through; swallow saliva once; called "Loitering Three Yang," entering and exiting Three Lives. Slight prayer said:

'Great Void Mud Pellet; Purple Palace Heavenly Honoured; Mysterious Void True Knot; prior to Emperor; within the Way Jade Emperor; within the body Mud Pellet; balancing feelings and sharp life; qi piercing the sky origin; essence entering clear hall; strengthening fetus enhancing soul; Vermilion Mountain reopened; respectfully approaching spiritual origin; left gathering sun brilliance; also gathering moon root; flowing fire ten thousand zhang; golden net blue skirts; waist girded heavenly bones; head wearing flowery crown; granting such and such hidden book; obtaining to walk Heavenly Pass; begging for flying immortal; commanding myriad gods; myriad directions all assemble; blessings and virtues like mountains.'

When acting one always faces north, holding the book to do so. One may also observe the stars according to the text; it is not necessary to recite in secret to act.

The Later Sage Sovereign received the Great Supreme Hidden Book of Walking the Rope and entrusted it to the Court Youth Lords of the various palaces, who taught the register of bones and life with Immortal names. Those without Immortal register or jade book, children of the Way, never meet one another; upon seeing this jade scripture, the Four Extremes Perfected say that within seven hundred years, only three may be transmitted; beyond this they cannot again appear to receive it. When granting the book, first test the person, then transmit. The test is not a single rule, but to cause suspicion and doubt, to judge acceptance or refusal and deprivation. Therefore the ancient Perfected examined the heart to decide the will, looked at conduct to observe affairs. When you come to transmission, be mindful of these words.

The Eight Entrustments say: It is not difficult to seek Immortality, but difficult to find the person; it is not difficult to learn the Way, but difficult to receive the scripture; it is not difficult to receive the scripture, but difficult to pass the test and not know it; it is not difficult to test the scripture, but difficult to practise the scripture with spirit and sincerity. The Great Supreme secret words are wondrous and trustworthy.

### Preface by Lord Wang in the Supreme Purple Writing

The Blue Essentials Purple Writing says: If you desire to ascend Heaven, you must walk the Seven Spirits, having ascended the North Pole, and entered the Purple Court. Do not transmit to unworthy persons, first test their nature. This is the meaning, the proper discourse of walking the ropes. In olden times I received the Divine Scripture; someone tested me and without cause struck my hand with a rod until it bled; yet I still inclined my heart to him, my mind did not think of others; it was a fault of the test. Then I obtained this scripture and was told: Yesterday you trod within water and fire, you have escaped. At first I did not understand these words, later I realized that striking the hand was a test. I formerly taught one person the Divine Scripture. The scripture had a test agreement; before teaching, he without cause set fire to burn his clothes; the clothes burned yet he did not speak, though his face did not greatly fear. Though the wicked qi did not show outside, and evil words did not come forth from his mouth, thus he passed. Later I also taught him the hidden scripture of walking the rope. When practising and attaining the Way, ascending Tai Chi, I saw previously carved Tai Chi northern jade inscription: Xianyang Mao Ying received the scripture of walking the rope, following the hidden test method; fire burned clothes and form; though mouth spoke not, the face was still not calm; this is a lesser fault, not true essence; one may practise Tai Chi but not ascend Supreme Clarity. Ying read the jade inscription, and sighed; since the first test and receipt of the scripture, he did not realize the burden of uneven coloured qi; now ninety-eight years have passed; he knows the jade rope jade jade has nothing unrecorded. Then he overcame and again went forward to complain and swear to the Supreme Perfected, thus gaining supplement to the Imperial rank. You must encourage this; Lord Wang thus speaks to young Lord Wang.

The Great Hidden Writings of the Jade Essence True Formula bring forth the Tai Chi hidden ganoderma, green feather flower robes, purple embroidered fur cloaks, cinnabar blue flying skirts, Five Mountains Spirit Mountains, Six Origins Seven Mysteries, Bright True Earth Gods, Immortals wandering; each presenting their offerings, presenting documents to Taiwei Palace. Bringing essentials, obtaining method; able to get the secret formula, worship as Immortal Lord.

The Great Hidden Writings say: On the first day of the first month, the twentieth day of the second month, and the twenty-seventh day of the third month, when the walking the ropes is finished, straighten the body and enter the Chief of the Dipper, face east, look at the position of the Year Star in the Liver, then bow twice, kneel and pray:

'Year Spirit, Wood Duke of Nine Heavens, Yang Hua Mysterious Origin, all come into the body.' When the prayer is finished, knock teeth nine times through. Practise for fourteen years; Eastern Mountain Lord offers green feather robe; Eastern Ultimate Perfected commands Mysterious Origin Earth Gods, myriad hills and spirit mountains, sending the Supreme Clarity clothing, green feather flower robes.

The Great Hidden Writings say: On the eighth day of the fourth month, fifth day of the fifth, eighteenth day of the sixth month, when walking the ropes is finished, straighten the body and enter the Chief of the Dipper, face south, look at the Mars star in the Heart, then bow twice, kneel and pray:

'Southern Upper Origin Spirit, Fire Yang Four Lights, Zhong Li Dan Water, come into the Dan chamber.' When the prayer is finished, knock teeth nine times; practise for fourteen years; Southern Mountain Lord offers flying feathers; Southern Ultimate Perfected commands Mysterious Origin Earth Gods, myriad hills and spirit mountains, sending Supreme Clarity clothing, purple embroidered fur cloak.

The Great Hidden Writings say: On the seventh day of the seventh month, the twentieth day of the eighth, and the ninth day of the ninth month, when walking the ropes is finished, straighten the body and enter the Chief of the Dipper, face west, look at the Venus star in the Lungs, then bow twice, kneel and pray:

'Western Upper Great Mysterious, Metal Essence Seven Paths, Jade Origin Two Emperors, qi returning to fetus brain.' When the prayer is finished, knock teeth nine times through; practise for fourteen years; Western Mountain Lord offers curved morning flying canopy; Western Ultimate Perfected commands Mysterious Origin Earth Gods, myriad hills and spirit mountains, sending Supreme Clarity clothing, cinnabar blue flying skirt.

The Great Hidden Writings say: On the fifth day of the tenth month, third day of the eleventh, sixth day of the twelfth month, when walking the ropes is finished, straighten the body and enter the Chief, face north, look at the Jupiter star in the Kidneys, then bow twice, kneel and pray:

'Northern Mysterious Purple Chen, Golden Chariot Water Origin, Dragon Fetus transforming spirit, comes into one body.' When the prayer is finished, knock teeth nine times through; practise for fourteen years; Northern Mountain Lord offers dragon robe tiger belt; Northern Pole Perfected commands Mysterious Origin Earth Gods, myriad hills and spirit mountains, sending Supreme Clarity clothing, phoenix brocade mysterious kerchief, lotus essence purple crown.

Facing east to the Four Extremes, call the souls and essences of the four stars; pray the hidden names of the Four Origins, to bring forth the robes of Supreme Clarity. The Outer Scripture says: Wings are complete, not meaning the body grows feathers. It is to ascend the Heavenly Ropes, conceal the Chief and keep true; worship the soul of the Five Essences; pray the names of the Four Origins; to bring forth spiritual offerings and ascend Supreme Clarity. Therefore feather robes descend mysteriously; indeed by spirit and sincerity.

The Great Hidden Writings say: At each Jiazi day and the Eight Sectional days, when the walking the ropes is finished, straighten the body and enter the Chief, behind the Assistant Star, face the Perfected star, preserve the position of the guarding star in the Spleen; bow twice, kneel and pray:

'Tai Chi Nine Truths, flowing health yin root, flying one turning canopy, coming into the Mud Pellet.' When the prayer is finished, knock teeth nine times through; practise for fourteen years; Central Mountain Lord offers jade pendant golden pendant white feathers purple canopy; Tai Chi Perfected commands Three Mysterious Caverns, Yang Terrace, Heavenly Kingdom, entrusts feather spirits of Ling Province, Nine Doubts, Great Mysterious Spirit Hills, Red Hawk Three Terraces; commands sending golden truth jade light Tai Chi hidden ganoderma. Tai Chi hidden ganoderma has four kinds; or four directional colours, shining within a hundred paces like the moon. One kind is blue, like layered bright mirrors; face diameter five to six inches; light shining penetrating; three layers piled; height six to seven inches; named Tai Chi Spiritual Mirror Hidden Heavenly Blue Ganoderma.

One kind is white, like a sturdy Dipper star; it has seven nodes, using stars as nodes, stems as ropes; tall and three to four feet; shining brightly and penetrating; named Tai Chi Mysterious Node Hidden Chen Spiritual Soul Ganoderma.

One kind is red, like a small jujube tree; its fruit like a ring; shining brightly; tall three to four feet; named Ring Rope Hidden Mysterious Tai Chi Golden Heavenly Ganoderma. When knocking its branches, there are jade sounds and golden tones.

One kind is pale blue, like a canopy laid on the ground; or heavily piled and obscure; round seven to eight inches; clear light flowing and shining; height three to four inches; named Tai Chi Mysterious Moon Reclining Dragon Ganoderma.

The above Tai Chi hidden ganoderma names, if asked with spirit and sincerity, the Three Mysterious Divine Perfected Lords all present them to you. Some come from flat marshes; some born in wrong places; some born in hills; some born in dwellings; all such are given to you by the Perfected. If obtained and eaten, Taiwei sends messengers, worships you as Immortal Lord, dividing form into myriad changes, body producing jade light.

The Great Hidden Writings of walking the Heavenly Ropes and flying the Six Records Jade Scripture were all requested by the Later Sage Sovereign, given to the Court Youth Lords of the various palaces, who taught the registries of bones and fates with Immortal names. Those without Immortal registers or jade books, children of the Way, never meet one another. Upon seeing this Jade Scripture, the Four Extremes Perfected say that within seven hundred years, only three transmissions are permitted; all transmissions are by oath; the scripture is kept secret and not disclosed; the highest spirits honour it. The scripture and many others are strictly forbidden to intermingle or confuse. Those who receive and walk the seven original stars' secret methods use silk thirty-two feet long, to combine numerals one, five, and seven. Those who receive and walk the five-star secret use silk twelve feet long to combine numerals two, four, and six. This also accords with the mystery of the straight and curved divisions of the celestial images, hence the oath must be strictly observed. In the dragon fish world there is no such thing, neither may the scripture be closed awaiting difficult acquisition. The silk is ten feet long to show the standard and oath, to show the beginning and end, and make clear the sincerity. Also to offer to the masters of the scripture, who shall again disseminate and not accumulate selfishly. Those who violate the oath are subject to the Three Officials' punishment; it is no small matter. The Perfected value green and gold; whenever convening oaths, they cite this as the clear standard. Violating the oath is a sin, extended to grandparents, receiving punishment in the hells. The oath objects are always kept highest; do not reveal to others. The Three Charts of Heavenly Pass say: 'Govern the root with essence; open the heart and regulate balance; unify the root with sincerity; wherever going life will spring; the Perfected value the oath; precious gold and green; harmonizing and praying; pointing as the oath; this is a great oath; do not violate or lightly regard it.'

All oath transmissions have limits; those who do not transmit but falsely speak of the scripture chapters all violate and leak secrets; Jade Youths and Jade Maidens report to the Great Supreme; three violations of secrecy bring death and loss of name; no longer to obtain Immortality. Transmissions are all by oath; also by gold and green returning to the master to encourage merit.

There are Great Supreme Jade Scriptures in hidden writings, all kept in separate cases. When practising and observing, all burn incense; Jade Youths and Jade Maidens attend and guard at the side. Do not say you have not seen and so do not exist. True spirits follow the Supreme Void Mirror, to observe the minutest of hearts; how can one not be cautious?

In the world again there are methods of walking the ropes and treading the records. Wang Feng, Grand Marshal of Emperor Cheng of Han, in the first year of Yangshuo, heard of the Daoist Liu Jing learning Immortality from Master Zhang of Handan, obtaining the method of walking the Heavenly Ropes. Feng then pressed him with power and rank; Jing had no choice but secretly to write this brief copy and give it to him. Feng said it was a secret method to prolong life and seek wealth and rank; he practised it secretly and transmitted it to his lineage; hence many prayers speak of wealth, rank, and emolument, using the days of the Celestial Granary and Celestial Storehouse and the days of separation and union. This brief copy originates from Liu Jing. At the end of Han, it was also shown to Huangfu Long, who also accepted and practised it. The floating and vain talk, how could it move heaven and earth and move the Divine Spirits? Feng's disciple had Wang Se, who was enfeoffed in the Mang times; he said the scripture of walking the ropes was recast in gold slips, carved and written, and told Mang it was a heavenly omen. Yet how much more is not the benefit of walking the ropes! But the true root text and secret formula have not been seen; yet already it is of immeasurable benefit, much less having its root.
