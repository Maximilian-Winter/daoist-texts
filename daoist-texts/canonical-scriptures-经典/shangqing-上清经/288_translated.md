### The Secret and Wondrous Instructions for the Altar Ascension and Talismans of the Supreme Taoist Authentic Eight Simplicities Classic

The Supreme One declares to the Sovereigns of the Heavens, the Later Sage Emperors, the High Minister Green Youth, and the True Man of the Supreme Ultimate: All later students who gain sight of the Great Cave Treasure Classic of the Upper Truth, all call it the Book of Eastern Splendour, written in golden characters of the Supreme Clarity. It is due to prior good karma that it is rare and precious beyond comparison. Yet, those who do not seek out a master to receive the instructions, who ascend the altar to cultivate, but only wish to recite and study it without fathoming the original source, labour in vain and profit not. They further invite demonic interference, thus incurring the guilt of stealing the classic, and have no hope of ascending to immortality. Those of aspiration must necessarily follow the proper regulations, seek a master, receive the mandate to accomplish the utmost truth. Therefore, here is set forth the ritual of covenant and proclamation, to be faithfully transmitted to the adept, with caution not to lightly divulge. The Sovereigns of Heaven and all the Holy and True Ones simultaneously acclaim its goodness, and bow in reverent acceptance of the charge.

Regarding the covenant proclamation to the spirits, there are distinct ranks and grades; those dwelling in mountains and forests and those in the world differ in tokens. The days of fasting and assembly vary in number; degrees of fasting and offerings depend on the persons concerned. The progress and return of master and disciple generally follow the essentials of this secret path. The treasures of Heaven and Earth are hidden and not transmitted to the true gods; they are not suitable for common or base learners, nor for persons of scant talent to hear, see, speak, or use. Thus, the peaceable and worthy should not withhold it.

When one obtains the treasure classic, there are many divergent strands. The principal causes are sevenfold: First, the divine spirits’ luminous forms, their voices and shapes descend and appear; Second, the meeting of kind persons, acceptance in mountain caves; Third, casual dispersal, public and private mistaken acquisition; Fourth, coming and going in markets or towns, or persons bringing goods; Fifth, ignorance of the methods and theft of rites and ceremonies; Sixth, sincere minds revering masters, opening and communicating; Seventh, family kin and ancestors, passing down through generations. These seven conditions may be separated or united, elevated or low; each has its covenant regulations, with the master’s transmission as the centre. The proper regulations are as follows:

Ascend the Jade Clarity Imperial Altar, proclaim the covenant and pass the scriptures and instructions. The altar is spacious, two zhang and four chi in length, opening four corner gates. Five-coloured patterned silks, one roll each; purple silk ninety chi, blue gauze ninety chi, upper gold nine liang, natal silk forty chi; five seats; one golden fish and one jade dragon; one jade talisman, one chi two cun long, two cun four fen wide; five elements’ boards, five pieces; three tablets with inscriptions; five fragrant incense; one scarlet gauze kerchief five chi long; one white silk one chi; one golden ring; five bright mirrors; one white silk one zhang five chi; inscriptions of covenant and pledge; blue silk wound about golden buttons, crossed with purple and [unreadable] patterned silk twenty chi long. The earthly doorway silk altar, likewise two zhang four chi wide and long, opening four corner gates; upper gold five liang; white patterned silk nine chi as sash; purple patterned silk three chi two cun. The next day’s affairs of passing, still lodge in the altar place, facing north, knocking teeth nine times in communication, looking upward and praying:

O Most High Prime Emperor, Sovereign of the Nine Heavens, Spirit Venerable, Upper Truth Profound and Remote, Lofty and Mysterious Jade Pavilion; The cycles of three and five move onward, seven lodgings alter the dawn; the Void Emperor reins his chariot, the Jade Emperor ordains immortals; the Azure Palace selects the tablets, the talismanic mandates of the Spirit Mountain. This day is of prime auspiciousness; myriad truths are displayed; the upper teachings of Jia and Yi; the fates and causes of the stars; chance to meet the Divine Classic, the Upper Emperor’s treasure chapters; respectfully at the Mysterious Peak; covenant with the Nine Heavens; report to the Five Emperors and the Twelve River Sources; beg to receive the scrolls; petition the High Morning; make public to myriad spirits; hover in place at the Imperial Altar; marshal defenses and extinguish trials; according to the Great Truth, wait until the morrow to complete the transmission.

At the time of ascending the altar on the morrow, before reaching the altar within thirty paces, knock teeth thirty-two times in communication; conceive the purple clouds covering the mountain like a crown; the Divine Soldiers of the Five Emperors, in the thousands and myriads, come forth to welcome the destined person, then softly recite:

The Spirit True issues forth on a journey; myriad emperors are startled; the Jade Spirit and Mysterious Guards, the Five Mountains command reception; the Heavenly Ding and mighty warriors, ten thousand unassisted spirits; the mandate summons the ten directions, driving the heavenly soldiers; leading those below Heaven, all arrive at the Imperial Court; command me to ascend immortality, cave attain the Way essence, discern unluckiness; penetrate the hidden and explore the profound; wherever presented, all accord with Jade Clarity.

Then ascend the altar. The master enters from the northwest onto the altar, bows nine times to the northwest, facing the Nine Heaven Kings, knocking teeth nine times in communication. [Softly opens mouth and says]:

Now transmitting to disciple Wang Jia the Nine Heavens Treasure Classic, ascending to the Jade Name. Clear fasting and offerings made; qi and mandate conform to truth; beg to descend and supervise; True Immortal Jade Name. The Director of Records and the Commanding Spirit Marshal descend to supervise the covenant heaven; what is opened and delivered, may it be early heard above. Finished, return facing southeast, bow again and speak:

Most High Primordial Heaven, now ascends the Eight Assemblies; day auspicious and hour clear; respectfully at the Mysterious Peak, covenant and transmit the upper classic; beg to report below; Five Emperors and Spirit Immortals as supervisors, officials covenant and swear; soon may the divine immortals be attained; may I ride the flying carriage, ascend to the Imperial Court.

The disciple enters from the southeast beneath the altar, bows nine times northwest, faces southeast and bows again, then turns north facing the master; facing north, knocks teeth thirty-six times in communication; first recites the Golden True Supreme Void Chapter once to control ten thousand demons. This chapter is from the Golden True Jade Light Scroll. If not receiving the Upper Clarity Jade Light, this chapter must not be recited.

Heavenly essence mounts the void and is dispatched; myriad essences startle the divine court. Entrust the immortal chant and song chapter, changing and entering the nameless. Noisy qi in confusion, filthy ways born on the road. In the clouds abandoned the Vermilion Palace; the Northern Emperor leaps with divine soldiers. Drums sounding from the wise Dao, mystical motions come to welcome. The upper light feasts and flies the reins; swift carriage inspects the cloud encampment. Urgently checking the Northern Emperor’s tablet, gathering and seizing names of demons. Dispersing and spreading the heavenly net, releasing might and casting flying bells. Now the True captures the empty cave; jade light shining in the Eight Darknesses. Golden mystery guards the upper palace; divine tiger slays heavenly essences. Cut off myriad demonic vapours; countless all brought to equal peace. Receiving the trust of the Nine Heavens; howling the mandate none refuse. Summon the True through the Three Caves; wisdom chants and eyes are clear. The Eight Ways gaze upon mysterious clouds; the Seven Turns weave heavenly scriptures. Mixed with the Imperial One Truth, transcending the Seven Ancestors’ stages. Cutting off the five bitter roots; return the soul and again receive glory. Golden light shines to utmost stillness; divine candle naturally arises. Floral incense scatters through the jade cosmos; smoke penetrates the jade capital. The Emperor dispatches circling carriages; the Three Origins descend green carriages; swift carriages rise through Nine Mysteries; court and salute the Jade Emperor’s Court.

Upon completion of the Supreme Void chapter, face east and knock teeth thirty-six times, then chant:

Supreme Three Heavens Mysterious Primordial Beginning Qi, Supreme Elder Lord, summon forth from within my body the void natural flying immortal function officers, divine immortal messengers, left and right flying dragons, True Jade Maidens, Five Emperors’ direct talismans, each thirty-six persons to issue forth; open and close the land here the true officials and gods; I now properly burn incense, desire that what is opened speedily reach the Infinite Jade Emperor, the Upper True Most High Ten Thousand Saints’ presence.

I, by virtue of past karma and blessings, endure the calamities of the Nine Heavens, revolving without ceasing; the bounty and grace have reached me; I have attained the method of birth. Formerly granted by the earlier sage true men, who saw and selected me, opened the path to dispel ignorance, clearly transmitted the highest methods, the great secret of the Nine Heavens, the Three Caves Treasure Classic, Jade Talismans and Spirit Writings, Elixir Scripts and Purple Characters, Flying Void Step Chapter; ascending the Imperial Altar, reporting to the Nine Heavens. Through accumulated ages and shifting of heaven’s cycles, the imperial way proceeds in sequences; the method must be transmitted to later learners. Those with prior mysterious names destined for immortality, the spirit script is secret and weighty; dare not close or block it, nor lightly transmit it. According to the fixed years, there are periods of calamity; for the utmost learners, there is no chance, only bitter laments of futility, diligent but unaccomplished. Until the Primordial beginning of transformation, difficult to meet such persons. Disease accords with the intent of the mysterious methods; when conditions meet, promptly instruct. Now there is a certain mountain master Wang Jia, with past blessings and remaining grace, encountering open peace and fortune, by chance born in a sacred age, veiled by the Supreme One, written as Imperial Instructions, gaining participation in the great method, cultivating and reciting the Jade Classic. Through accumulated ages, the master discards emotion and forgets shadow, entrusting the will to secluded highlands, quiet spirit in rocky caves, thinking of spirits and qi, yet what he sees is shallow and narrow, unprepared for circumstances. Now again he comes to me, clear fast seven days, offering words and pledges, seeking achievement, establishing the Imperial Altar, reporting to the Nine Heavens, receiving and accepting the Upper Clarity precious instructions and Jade Classic, all as prescribed. The vows and pledges are complete, all as regulations and methods; I then accompany master Wang ascending the Spirit Mountain, closing the Five Mountains and Five Emperors, reporting to the Nine Heavens, to transmit him. Wang vows to keep his mouth closed and diligently cultivate, not to be negligent, to declare and reveal the true texts; if he transgresses regulations and violates prohibitions, the Seven Ancestors will examine and his body will be entrusted to the ghost officials. Examine conduct and carefully observe the law; the body shall attain flying immortality. Respectfully report this and must be guarded by transmission.

Having dispatched the officials, command the covenant, the instructions and talismans; master stands facing north, left hand holding the scripture, master knocks teeth thirty-six times, heart holding the Supreme Jade Emperor; command the light of sun and moon to illuminate master and disciple’s bodies. Chant:

How boundless and remote is the Great Microcosm! The true men bind void and give birth; the void ford naturally connects, gathering to form the Great Cave Classic. The true and worthy observe the law and trust it, riding the cycles through the Yellow Court, guarding secret years and piled calamities, leaking slowly to hellish infants, torturing to the seventh ancestor, the wind knife unbinds your form. Master holds scripture in left hand, disciple holds trust in right, facing heaven and softly speaks: issue the Four Extremities bright regulations.

Report to the High Mysterious, myriad emperors ethereal and subtle; below worlds have vows, guarding firmly without moving; dare to report bright regulations, to examine the multitude of faults; jade classic and precious injunctions all as regulations and majesty; after transcending the body, myriad qi all return; long protect heaven and earth; the three lights shine together; dare anyone leak, long decline the four faults. Finished, disciple faithfully receives scripture, faces north and bows nine times; disciple upholds the legal trust; master receives the trust token; disciple’s left hand points northwest, right hand receives scripture, returns southeast ascending, leaning facing west to stand, then turns south to take the heavenly gate, bury the disappearing talisman. If also receiving the purple knot belt, before turning up southeast, may also separate purple and white, with separate ritual procedure.

Master’s position stands on the northeast ascending, knocks teeth thirty-six times, looking upward prays:

Nine Heavens cave brilliant, mysterious talisman shining bright; upper teachings Jia and Yi, refined qi essence; highest chosen imperial ministers, closing and controlling myriad spirits; Jade Emperor supervises the position; attendant immortal court; northern Feng three palaces; inspecting and controlling demonic soldiers; Four Supervisors and Five Emperors; slaughter and extinguish corrupt births; clearly capture nine offices; inscribe and strike out names; soar body and escape transformations; use earth to conceal form; longevity equal to the three lights; nine origins all combined.

Finished, single step twenty-four, reach behind disciple between earth gates, again chant:

Tread the Five Ridges, ascend the profound mystery; soar through nine voids; emerge from hidden and enter minute; light steps like clouds; attain transformation swift brilliance; golden true shining light; heaven’s gate brightly opens; body wears imperial badge; flying blue feather robe; five spirits supervise and reflect; depart without hesitation; countless ages and kalpas; forever decline world opposition.

Finished, bury the soaring heaven escape transformation talisman beneath disciple’s left foot. Disciple then single steps twenty-four, arrives at southwest corner human gate leaning, again prays:

Disperse form Imperial Altar, transform traces and enter void; extinguish light spirit mountains; swift body supreme void; soar heaven use earth; mix eras ten directions; close none not open; sever none not return; Most High Jade Emperor; Nine Heavens Great King; spirit reflection already supervising; forever complete world reverence; report covenant Imperial Altar, further pass spirit peak, shed traces in three roads, ascend to Jade Capital.

Finished, bury the use earth disperse form talisman beneath disciple’s right foot. Next single step thirty-nine, arrive at northwest corner heavenly gate leaning; master again chants:

Finished, bury soaring heaven talisman beneath left trace, use earth talisman beneath right trace. Finished, master and disciple at Nine Heaven Gate, blue silk wound about golden button, proclaim spirits and depart, then pass out northwest Nine Heavens gate. Disciple leaves gate, then holds fish-dragon pitching rock of mountain, facing due north, knocks teeth nine times in communication, self-proclaims covenant at Nine Heavens, chanting:

Finished, then cast object on mountain cliff.

Two talismans on the right, blue writing on white silk, buried at the heavenly gate, recipients’ two traces beneath. Earth gate, bury soaring heaven talisman beneath disciple’s left foot. Human gate, bury use earth talisman beneath disciple’s right trace. Disciple’s life pattern patterned silk placed above natal silk; Five Emperors’ patterns by colour guard five directions; covenant trust placed in the centre; five covenant mirrors guard Five Emperors, control heavenly demons; without this guarding silk, then the spirits of the Five Mountains do not accept the disciple’s covenant. Western City Wang Lord copied Supreme Truth secret essentials at Yangluo, passed Southern Mountain Lady; only soaring heaven and use earth talismans; secret instructions orally transmitted. Receiving this method, there is a separate covenant secret and Supreme Truth regulations.

When master ascends the altar, he must apply the Five Emperors’ proclamation true talismans, with disciple’s trust guarding the five directions, swearing to the Nine Heavens, pledging the Five Spirits. Apply scarlet gauze kerchief five chi in front, to request the scripture text; master faces north reading the transmission name, disciple faces east prostrate to receive. When covenant affairs are completed, disciple faces north and bows nine times and bows nine times again, looks upward and swallows nine breaths of qi. Finished, then departs. Master should bury the golden fish, jade dragon, and jade talisman in the remote rock; when burying, face north and knock teeth thirty-six times, softly chanting:
