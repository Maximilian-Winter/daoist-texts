Biography of the Great Youth Lord

The Three Lords: the Great Emperor Lord, the Supreme Heavenly Emperor Lord, and the Supreme Subtle Heavenly Emperor Lord. Of old, these Three Lords received the Profound Elixir Upper Scripture from the Supreme Daoist Lord, practising and cultivating the Way until completion, thereby supplementing the sovereigns with truth. On the day of their ascent to the heavens, the Great Emperor Lord transmitted the true scripture to the Queen Mother of the West; the Supreme Heavenly Emperor Lord transmitted the scripture to the Supreme Lord of the Southern Pole; the Supreme Subtle Heavenly Emperor Lord transmitted the true scripture to the Holy Lord of the Golden Palace; the Holy Lord of the Golden Palace transmitted the true scripture to the Prime Minister Great Youth Lord; the Prime Minister Great Youth Lord transmitted the true scripture to his disciple.  

This scripture is the Upper Chapter of the Primordial Spirit. This Way is lofty and profound, not to be heard by the middling immortals. Unless one possesses the named books with vermilion slips and green characters of the Supreme Ultimate, the Profound Elixir Upper Scripture cannot be encountered or heard. A Daoist who fully cultivates the Supreme Three Truths Scripture shall attain rank as a Great Duke or High Minister among emperors and sovereigns. Those who receive but partial instruction and hear but limited doctrine attain rank as kings of small spiritual palaces, ministers of the divine realm, or mid-to-lower officials of the Supreme Ultimate; yet they may ride dragons, soar upon clouds, control the void by flight, with divine officials guiding and protecting, their shadows dispersing to the eight quarters. The teaching is subtle and deeply mysterious, difficult to proclaim lightly.  

The titles of the Scripture’s chapters appear within the Supreme Secret Book of Eight Pristine Chapters, marked by the forms of looking down and looking up. One should practise in seclusion and dedication; the more diligent is one’s heart, the further one advances. Thus the perfect man gradually acquires form and appearance. Unless thou art a master, speak not of this to others.  

If thou hearest the sound of flutes and horns in thine ears, it is a fortunate omen of great honour; but if thou hearest shouting and howling, it is an ill omen of extreme degradation. If thou hearest foul vapours, there is surely aversion to filth, a sign of impurity and uncleanness, hence manifested by these foul airs. Therefore, bathe anew, burn incense, and cleanse thy sleeping chamber to respond to it; this is the Lord’s admonition and exhortation to men.  

If thou hearest fragrant vapours, it is that divine officials and spirits are near thee, watching thy condition. At that time, thou shouldst practise good deeds, exercise virtue and benevolence, succour the poor and distressed, perform secret merit, and bestow kindness and love; the divine officials and spirits will report to the Supreme Ones on thy goodness or otherwise. The subtlety of the Way cannot be unobserved; these are all such portents. Hear this fragrance, but unless thou art a master, reveal it not to others. If foul vapours are heard, report it, to manifest thine own offences and the foulness of thy transgressions.  

If thou hearest blood vapours or see unexplained blood gathering, it portends calamity of war. Then must thou secret thyself away from the world, guard the Three Primal Lords, seek instruction, and seclude thyself in fasting and meditation for three months; the disaster shall pass. These are all warnings from the Lords concerning good and ill, to cause fear and caution regarding fortune and misfortune.  

When ill omens appear, thou shouldst practise secret rectitude, labour in kindness to rescue others, perform what others cannot, do what travellers cannot, so shall thou escape the certain sign of death. Be diligent, and do not rest in the ordinary.  

Between the eyebrows above the forehead, one enters three fen to guard the inch of the double field; one inch within is the Palace of Clarity; two inches within is the Palace of the Inner Chamber; three inches within is the Palace of the Elixir Field; four inches within is the Palace of the Flowing Pearl; five inches within is the Jade Emperor’s Palace. All who cultivate the highest method first strike the heavenly drum, place hands over ears, and utter the incantation:  

> "The infant dwells in the palace,  
> The nine truths abide in the chamber.  
> Pray hear the divine decree,  
> Ever inspect for misfortune.  
> Supreme One, flowing fire,  
> To extinguish myriad calamities."  

When finished, strike the ear gate with the hand seven times; then thou shouldst feel heat upon the face, which is a good sign. Should the head, nape, or neck feel cold, it is evil qi entering. Then lie down, close the eyes, and hold the Supreme Elixir Palace’s Supreme One, wielding the flowing fire’s bell to scatter the evil qi forth; the radiance of the fire follows behind, shining brightly over the body, until after a while tranquillity returns.  

If suddenly thou hear the sound of rushing water, thunder, or drums within the ear, it is the sign of bodily injury, great damage to the heart treasury, unable to taste the true essence, and therefore depraved; thus disorder arises, the six organs lose control, and the soul and spirit mourn. This portends disease and death. Hence the method of the Mud Pellet, the nine palaces lose their regularity, sadness and confusion turn awry; drums resound in disorder, and the spirit attempts to abandon its dwelling and forsake the body. He who hears this should diligently recall the Supreme One’s entire heart; if the offence is not deep, he may hear and repent. This is the cause of deafness, the loss of ear spirit.  

The ear is the gate of the Lords’ hearing; the eye is the sun and moon of the Supreme One; the nose is the hill and mountain of the Three Primes; the mouth is the vermilion abyss of the Crimson Palace; the eyebrows are the floral canopy of the White Prime; the hair is the forest spirit of the Palace of Clarity; the tongue is the dragon shaft of the No-Shadow; the teeth are the might of the Stomach Palace; the hand is the external aid of the gall-spirit; the foot is the spiritual gate of the kidney-prime; the yin pole is the true mechanism of the inner chamber.  

Each bone and hundred spirits belongs to its own domain and must not be overlooked nor treated carelessly.  

If suddenly thou hear golden sounds and jade tones in the ear, the true qi is entering, and the Way seeks fulfilment. If thou hear the sound of stringed instruments, the Six Ding and Jade Maidens come to guard thee; all are signs that the Way is to be accomplished.  

Above the eyebrows, wrapped are the Yellow Gate, Purple Door, Vermilion Terrace, and Green Chamber, together forming the guarded inch between the left and right ears. On the left face is the Vermilion Terrace; on the right face is the Yellow Gate; the Nine Palaces’ perfected beings enter and exit between Yellow Gate and Vermilion Terrace, following the Way as guide; thus the Terrace and Gate are set on left and right. They watch for extraordinary qi and receive the comings and goings of perfected beings.  

The great god of the Purple Door is named Tranquillity, styled the Law-King; the great god of the Green Chamber is named Upright Heart, styled the First Origin. Both appear like infants, each clothed as their respective chamber’s colour, holding a flowing golden fire bell. The guarded inch is three fen within, named the Guarded Inch. At dawn, dusk, lying at night and during meditation, first recall these two great gods, vividly appearing, then thrice call their divine names and finally intone a soft prayer:  

> "Purple Door and Green Chamber,  
> Two great gods,  
> Hands grasping flowing bells,  
> Born of wind and cloud,  
> Chivalrously guarding the true Way,  
> Not heeding the outside world,  
> Making me think and feel,  
> Opening the spiritual gates,  
> Coming and going with profit and truth,  
> Ascending the nine gates,  
> Beholding the nine truths,  
> The Supreme’s honoured ones."  

When the incantation ends, one may meditate on the essentials of the three-one inner chamber and the nine paths. The two gods of the guarded inch only hear the true officials of the nine palaces; those within the nine palaces come and go in the ear and eye, the trust and decree of the Supreme Lord, and the Jade Youth spirits, the worthy saints and immortals who come and go among the imperial courts. The two gods only admit these, but not others, who are not true; the two gods do not admit others forward into the inner palace — this is the Supreme One’s law and order.  

Thus the infant Emperor Lord commands the two ear spirit maidens, Cloud Ceremony and Grace, to guide them in; when men feel ringing in their ears, it is from external envoys. Should there be likes or dislikes, Cloud Ceremony strikes the stone chime bell to announce the nine palaces, signaling the arrival of the envoys and alerting to their coming. The chime bell’s sound causes the ringing in the ears.  

If one hears it, place the hand over the ear, and recite:  

> "The infant dwells in the palace,  
> The nine truths abide in the chamber.  
> Pray hear the divine decree,  
> Ever inspect for misfortune."  

Within the Elixir Field resides the Supreme One Emperor Lord of the Primordial Origin and his ministers, three in all, jointly governing the Palace of the Elixir Field, guarding the Way of the Three Primes and the One Truth. This place is the essence of truth, the scripture of riding the dragon chariot.  

The celestial lords delight much in becoming earthly perfected beings; earthly perfected beings hide away from official posts, sparing themselves from court banquets and disturbances, thus at ease, free to roam with the times, sitting in carriages with seven wheels or more, stepping a single breath through the Supreme Nothingness. Though there be small differences in rank between heavenly perfected and earthly perfected, all share the one truth. Men also settle in their proper places, unwilling to become officials among the clouds again.  

In the Profound Elixir Palace above the Elixir Field, square and one inch in size, are the Purple Chamber and Green Room, filled with vermilion smoke. Within is the Mud Pellet Supreme One Lord, governing the Profound Elixir Palace. The Supreme One Lord appears as a newly born infant, seated upon a golden bed with jade curtains, robed in purple embroidered silk, his belt a flowing fire bell. The flowing fire bell is without substance but with red light; when moved, its sound is heard for ten thousand li—this is the treasure bell of the Supreme True Being of the Upper Clarity. In the left hand he holds the handle of the Big Dipper’s seven stars; in the right hand he holds the thread of the North Star. The North Star is the immovable Pole Star, called the Thread Star. Sitting upright in the Profound Elixir Palace, facing outward, he has no attendants at left or right. The lack of attendants is why he is called the Supreme One Lord. He guards the three ones at dawn and dusk; after all is done, he guards that which is not yet established, first creating the light, then carrying the heavy.  

A man’s head contains nine palaces, which we now describe. Above the eyebrows is the Yellow Gate, which, when fully guarded, is followed by thrice invoking the names of the Three Lords, striking the heavenly drum twenty-four times; a thousand demons bow down, ten thousand devils and evil spirits lose their form.  

Should a Daoist be hungry or thirsty, he first recalls the Three Lords, then exhales red qi from the mouth, pouring it into his own mouth to swallow; in a moment he is sated. Should the Daoist travel by night and be unable to see the path, recall the Three Lords and cause red firelight to shine forth from the mouth, illuminating the way instantly.  

If in perilous places with knives and weapons, recall them quickly, cause the Three Lords to ring the jade bell, gather spirit and focus thought; the enemy will be dismayed and terrified, no longer harbouring hostile or harmful intent.  

If a Daoist desires to prolong life, ward off death, or be rescued at the moment of illness or peril, settle the heart and rest; concentrate on the Three Lords of the Hall of Clarity; kneel facing outward; breathe forth red qi, causing light to penetrate the body, encircle the mouth, and swallow the red qi. Usually, swallow many times, then close the eyes and swallow gently. Soon the red qi encircles the body transforming into fire; the fire burns the body; the body and fire become one; within and without, light shines; after a while it ceases—this is called the refining of the form by sun and moon, death and rebirth. Practised regularly at dawn and dusk, it brings longevity and deathlessness.  

Regularly upon rising, swallow fluid thirty times, wipe the face and rub the eyes, maintaining the habit, preserving saliva coloured like red nectar.  

Within the Inner Chamber dwell the Three Lords: on the left is the young lord Wu Ying, on the right is the Lord White Prime, and in the middle the Yellow Elder Lord. These three true lords jointly govern the Inner Chamber; this is the Way of Flying Truth, with a separate scripture.  

Within the Elixir Field dwells the Supreme One Emperor Lord of Primordial Origin. The Mud Pellet Heavenly Emperor Three Ones are the spiritual ancestors of the person, the root of the hundred spirits’ life, the mountain source of fluids, the jade chamber of soul essence. Thus the stomach pool is square to receive substance; the brain palace is round and void to accommodate truth; ten thousand hairs stand erect; a thousand pores emit smoke. Their virtue matches that of heaven, blending with the Supreme Profound, the primordial origin and nine spirits. Hence it is called the Upper Palace of the Mud Pellet.  

The Upper Palace of the Mud Pellet is the highest spirit of the body’s form in the Great Way. Those who only know to swallow qi and saliva, to beat the heavenly drum and receive fluid, but do not know whence these arise, see only the flowing foam of the Mud Pellet, the outer edge of the brain. Now I shall reveal to thee the secret of guarding the one, following the twelve hours, with gods who each have surname, style, village, court, palace, residence, clothing, and light color. If thou wouldst harmonise with the elixir, combine these spirits.  

A man is nine cun and nine fen in height; he wears a sash of five colours: black, yellow, and the primordial spirit; his head is adorned with a headdress of seven treasures, vermilion jade, the crown of limitless merit, residing in the Supreme Ultimate Vermilion Palace, the house of seven treasures, the dwelling of five spirits, the village of the Mysterious Origin. Surname Lian, styled Xian, called Huang Yan.  

A woman is six cun and six fen in height; she wears a silk embroidered sash of blue treasure, godly radiance, frost gauze of nine colours; her head wears a headdress of black and yellow of merit; she resides in the supreme Kunlun Supreme Dark Palace, in the Hall of Clarity’s divine house, the nine-rayed village of the Great Transformation; surname Hui, styled Bi Yu.  

These two, when seen, are great immortals, the parents who give birth to the spiritual elixir. Before their primordial qi is established, before the five administrations open, before light and shadow communicate, there is no limit, no extreme, no up or down, no outside or inside, no left or right, no front or rear; they are the ancestors of the Supreme, the parents of primordial qi, the utmost subtlety of the mysterious origin, the absence of existence in void. Primordial qi is born of all things; heaven and earth obtain their permanence thereby.  

Sometimes they dwell among men, with long life; those who can maintain meditation do not know aging for a thousand years; also dwelling in the nine heavens, receiving and transmitting the ten thousand spirits.  

If thou desirest to combine the medicine, all medicines combined must first be purified by fasting and abstinence; when the medicine is completed, it bears fruit. It is named the Profound Elixir; hence the requirement of the virgin girl’s essence and elixir waters is also excellent. When combining the elixir, the girl must be present; the combination is made in a quiet, secluded place; the three must not associate with vulgar men; three days and three nights; a yellow altar may be established.  

In the east is the Azure Dragon restraining the wood spirit talisman, written in blue; in the south the Vermilion Bird restrains the fire spirit talisman, written in red; in the west the White Tiger restrains the metal spirit talisman, written in white; in the north the Mysterious Warrior restrains the water spirit talisman, written in black; in the centre the Yellow Dragon restrains the earth spirit talisman, written in yellow. The five colours stand together in form and image, then the medicine is combined.  

The essence of spirit sand and herbs may all be combined as the elixir. When entering the mouth, the knife and jade must rise to the heavens by day.  

When combining the medicine, be careful not to enter foulness; if the medicine fails, it causes loss of life. The formula reads thus: the method of combining medicines cannot be ignorant of the nine heavens’ generation and the nine earths’ establishment; all emphasise the knowledge of order. The first is the Supreme Clear Heaven, the upper palace of the nine heavens, the first grandson; its qi is pure and void, the place of the supreme;  

The Clear Subtle Heaven is the palace of the upper one, the second grandson; its qi is subtle and wondrous, the seat of the next honoured one;  

The Great Red Heaven is the upper palace of the north one, the third grandson; its qi is vermilion red, thus the Sun Lord rules it;  

The Great Azure Heaven is the mansion of the Mysterious Origin, the fourth grandson; its qi is profound and distant, thus the Void Lord rules it;  

The Great Mysterious Blue Heaven is the palace of the northern capital official, the fifth grandson; its qi is profound and wondrous, thus the Limitless Lord rules it;  

The Supreme Mysterious Heaven is the palace of the northern one, the sixth grandson; its qi is profound and silent, thus the Great Dao Lord rules it;  

The Great White Heaven is the capital mansion of the seven administrations, the seventh grandson; its qi is vast and all-embracing, thus the Supreme Elder Lord rules it;  

The Supreme Mysterious Capital Heaven is the upper palace of the northern plain, the eighth grandson; its qi is clear and righteous, thus the Dao Virtue Lord rules it;  

The Supreme Bright Heaven is the palace of the yang immortals and myriad beginnings, the ninth grandson; its qi is clear and bright, thus the Supreme Clear Lord rules it.  

Hence the nine heavens are all pure, the nine earths all established; all things prosper; yin and yang, sun and moon, the four seasons and five elements. Therefore one qi in heaven cleanses heaven; one qi descending to earth causes all things to live. Wherever the one is, all is clear and bright.  

Thus heaven is weighty by the Way; men are weighty by treasure. Heaven has the Way and does not lavish it; men have treasure and do not speak falsely of it. Therefore the Way is weighty and men are light.  

From the very beginning, the Great Beginning, the One is subtle and profound, the origin of myriad wonders. Hence the Lesser Yang Cover in the Vermilion Palace, the Supreme One Yellow Court, the Great Red Vermilion Palace, the Golden Palace and Jade Chamber, the secluded gate and escort, the jade gate first rising, the jade stem first growing; the Kunlun Mountain on the summit of the Jade Gate, directly above nearly nineteen thousand li. Within is the profound mystery, five-coloured lapis lazuli; above is the Supreme One, below the Vermilion Palace, manifesting and fading at will, born of primordial qi, embracing all things. The virtue of the Way is one, thus it is weighty indeed.  

Man is born on earth; the primordial qi is generated from earth’s order; the essence of all things on earth dare not harm man.  

The first earth is named Primordial Virtue; its qi is upper blue and middle yellow; it is governed by the Prime Earth Minister; it is eleven thousand one hundred and ten li thick; all earth officials govern therein.  

The second earth is Imperial Virtue, connected to black; it is governed by the Prime Court Earth Vice-Minister; also eleven thousand one hundred and ten li thick, governed by earth officials.  

The third earth is Emperor Virtue, connected to azure; it is governed by the Tiger Mouth Earth Dragon; also eleven thousand one hundred and ten li thick, governed by earth officials.  

The fourth earth is King Virtue, connected to yellow; it is governed by the Prime Heart Earth General; thickness as above.  

The fifth earth is Primordial Virtue, connected to red; it is governed by the Prime Fortune Earth Official; thickness as above.  

The sixth earth is Earth Virtue, connected to white; it is governed by Prime Bone Earth One; thickness as above.  

The seventh earth is Village Virtue, connected to purple; it is governed by the First Early Earth Parents; thickness as above.  

The eighth earth is Return Virtue, connected to blue; it is governed by the First Worthy Earth Ancestor; thickness as above.  

The ninth earth is Flourishing Virtue, connected to green; it is governed by the Supreme Early Upper and Lower Two Thousand Officers; thickness as above.  

Its qi number is derived from the Great Cold Village drowning waters.  

A Daoist who can comprehend these two volumes and their whereabouts connects with heaven and earth’s spirit; those who later receive and practise them, without undergoing the trials of the nine heavens, nine earths, and nine waters, without passing the cold hill and without enduring cold, may become among the heavenly clear and bright six laws’ born.  

If a Daoist does not follow the teaching’s essence, he will enter the Yellow Springs, be examined and banished to hell, and should arrive at the cold hill. Though a ghost, his body is poisonous, suffering intense torment, intolerable, and cannot bear to become a ghost. Words spoken are falsehoods, truth is delayed. Men and women, not completing their lives, all die prematurely.  

Moreover, the "Female Blue Ghost Law" and the edicts of eight volumes cause ghosts to submit.  

This Upper and Middle Chapter of the Primordial Spirit, unless with the named books on vermilion slips, must not be mixed with others.  

One must possess the palace and residence within the body, the spirit chambers, one hundred and eighty palaces, three hundred and sixty joints, one thousand two hundred pores, twelve thousand essences and lights, thirty-six thousand spirit lords. The supreme lord resides therein, the place of the Mysterious Saint. Three souls and seven spirits, twelve shapes and shadows, ten thousand sounds responding.  

Thus the numbers of yin and yang are complete, following the three primes: the head is the Heavenly Prime; the heart the Middle Prime; the kidney the Lower Prime; all governed by thirty-six thousand spirit lords, dividing left and right. Thus we say left blue, right white; front red, rear black; centre proper yellow.  

The six laws generate, the twenty-four qi govern, each with their division; the prime, chief, and deputy officials number up to thirty-six thousand.  

Transformation is without shape; temporary evasion of time is not death but transformation.  

Thus ten thousand spirits are placed in all things, combined with forces and accumulated; when gathered, they are human qi; when dispersed, spirits scatter; when spirits scatter, the body cannot move; its true form therefore hides itself.  

Common people age, yet know not this principle; they think they die and are submerged, weeping and wailing. This is no different from insects shedding their skins on the first day of winter; their forms return to earth; at mid-spring, awakening again; neither knowing whence they shed their skins, even as infants newly born.  

I often see you briefly appear in the world, not learning the immortal Way nor combining divine medicines, but only committing offences, suffering punishment, and returning to your descendants’ bodies, assuming form and emerging; how little you know this.  

If thou hast offences and crimes, cultivate merit to atone, to repay earlier transgressions and prohibitions. Thus it is said that if ancestors do good deeds, blessings flow to descendants; if they commit evil and rebellion, crimes return to future generations. This is because the soul’s punishment underground is not complete; at day’s end it must emerge and repay in the world; it is not the self who did evil that obtains it. Be cautious in thy speech; the examiners observe thee daily; the mouth is the heavenly gate; do not falsely transmit; to transmit to the wrong person forfeits fifty counts.  

The method of clear inspection: on the day of Gengshen (Metal Monkey), this day is when the six souls’ ghosts ascend to the heavenly palace and return to the body. On that day, sit facing east, neither sleep nor lie down; intone:  

> "The spirits of the five viscera,  
> In their respective palaces,  
> Together meditate as the law prescribes,  
> Suppress all leakage,  
> Suppress leakage from head and feet,  
> All by the master’s hand."  

The arts of meditating the viscera: my left three souls are in my liver, the right seven spirits in my lungs; one hundred and twenty shapes and shadows, twelve thousand essences and lights, from my mouth ascend the heavenly bridge, rising to Mount Kunlun, the prefecture of Fanyang, the village of non-action; the Vermilion Bird leads with banners before, the Mysterious Warrior follows behind bearing drums and bells; Azure Dragon attends left, White Tiger right; the central Yellow Spirit holds the axe; a thousand ghosts and ten thousand gods all bow with no uprising. Before is a cauldron of ten thousand stones of boiling water; behind are reverse scales and armor; thou art my lord to dispel disasters and scatter calamities. I have erred, and tread the three principles and six regulations; cut off the ghosts swiftly as law dictates."  

If thou art a Daoist, watch thine own body, observe its lights and colours; then thou shalt know the body’s weakness and qi’s decline, and that the six ugly evil ghosts strike thee.  

At noon, in a closed chamber, sit in meditation long and observe if there is bright radiance; if bright and shining, the body is robust, and the year’s strength firm.  

Plug the ears and listen; if thou hear the sound of metal and stone, or the five notes of flute, bamboo, bell, and chime, these are good omens.  

If the light is faint and weak, or there are sounds of mourning and howling, these are evil omens.  

Calm thy spirit, recall the true One Lord to govern the palaces, and intone:  

> "My form and myriad spirits,  
> Secure my palace,  
> Guard my jade hall,  
> No wandering abroad.  
> Chivalrous gatekeepers and mighty warriors,  
> Central youths,  
> If any unusual enters or leaves,  
> Restrain them swiftly as law commands."  

If thy essence light is faint, at sunrise and moonrise, sit facing east and intone:  

> "Warm and gentle, warm and gentle,  
> Essence light bright,  
> Swallow qi, eat shadow, enter my form,  
> Support my body, summon the spirits,  
> True qi restores and dispels evil spirits,  
> Grant me longevity and ten thousand years."  

Stop after nine swallows.  

If suddenly the body is confused, the mind sorrowful, as if recalling something without clarity, the heart fearful and unsettled, this is the spirit in the body wanting to depart, longing for the palace; the three souls have gone, the seven spirits fly upwards, only the shape remains, communing with evil. Dreams of meeting women or men and exchanging spirits, causing leakage, all portend death.  

If these signs appear, one must change, seek the Daoist priest and offer a memorial, kneeling to express sorrow, establishing slight merit, smoothing the mind; henceforth practise diligently, worship the Four Lords, perform the Three, Five, Seven, Nine rites; invoke the Eight Winds, Twelve Thunders, Twenty-four Rains, Three Hundred and Sixty Lightning Bolts, Nine Palaces and Eight Trigrams; do not hold true within falsehood, nor act unjustly, else the examiners shall report and the three officials after death will not pardon.  

The Vermilion Bird faces south; its talisman also faces south. The White Tiger faces south; its talisman faces west. The Mysterious Warrior faces south; its talisman faces north. The Yellow Dragon faces south; its talisman faces east. The Azure Dragon faces south; its talisman faces east. All talismans are inscribed on peach wood.

### The Supreme Daoist Lord of Cavernous Truth: The Nine Truths of the Supreme Clarity, Three Grades of Regulation

The Supreme One commands the heavenly emperors, the posthumous sages and sovereign lords, the Prime Minister Great Youth, and the Supreme Ultimate True Man: "All later students who see the Supreme Truth’s Three Cavernous Precious Seals and the secret beginning and end of the scripture, all are named in the Eastern Floral Books, gilded in supreme clarity. Though they have not yet transcended to control reins in the Purple Court, all are people of ascension. Yet even though these texts are seen, if the ‘Nine Truths of Supreme Clarity’ and the rules and rites of the Three Caverns, the strange writings of the Supreme True, and the precious books cannot be obtained and opened, the bright and secret regulations are hidden within the Palace of the Mysterious Capital, in the Golden Pavilion and Jade Chamber, and not passed to the world.  

This is the abyss of the Three Caverns’ clarity, the rite of selecting the many truths, the selection of lodgings for the recluse, the passing of the Seven Mysteries in the immortal registry, the gathering of karma throughout myriad ways, the untying of the great charges of the Nine Yins. Its subtlety is such that once used, it may be solemnly enforced.  

Now, therefore, the Three Grades of chapters are selected to assist in publishing the Three Wonders of the Primordial Spirit’s Marvelous Scripture, to warn the later students, urging diligent and careful respect for the precious regulations."  

The heavenly emperors, the posthumous sages and sovereign lords, Prime Minister Great Youth, Supreme Ultimate True Youth, and Supreme Ultimate True Man respectfully inquire of the Supreme Heavenly Lord:  

> "The highest true supreme law, lofty, refined, mysterious and pure,  
> Vastly extending through myriad sects,  
> Quiet and vacuous, subtly congealed,  
> Wondrous and bright in meaning,  
> The law transforms the three vehicles,  
> Passing through countless kalpas,  
> How can one bear the measure?  
> How can one still dare presume to approach this bright regulation?"  

The Supreme Lord answered: "Good son, thy words are right. The later students who are not born naturally of the Jade Void’s clear condensation all receive their conception in turbid qi, stained and entangled in filth and defilement. Their constitution is impure, their nature not dedicated; though they aspire to the profound and mysterious, their heart often turns from me; in their conduct and riding, all violate excess. Excess arises outside and destroys life within; to receive this and study is indeed to depart far from truth.  

If the Three Officials take charge of faults and accuse in the underworld offices, examining the seven ancestors, the sins weigh heavy upon the body. Those who offend thus, if made to awaken to the regulation of correction and punishment, the great sacred transformations, and permitted the method of atonement, according to regulation, then the truth will surely draw near. Without such inspection by the scholar, all his meditation is vain, no help to his diligent thought. Now therefore I issue the Nine Truths and Three Grades of bright regulation, which may be given to later students who should be perfect men."  

The Lords, Prime Minister Great Youth, and Supreme Ultimate True Man then took their leave, purified, and went to the Supreme Clarity to receive the "Primordial Spirit Great Marvelous Scripture Nine Truths of Bright Regulation", kept secret in the Golden Treasury and Jade Cabinet, guarded by Jade Youth and Jade Maidens, each three thousand in number, attending the spirit texts, dispersing incense in the ethereal court, flying dragons and poisonous beasts, giant horned dragons a thousand zhang high, claws striking the cloud walls, all guarding the Jade Gate.  

Thus the ten heavenly great saints, the nine palace true immortals, thrice each month, all ascend to the mysterious palace, receive the bright regulation, and worship the spirit texts.  

The Prime Minister Great Youth Lord said: "All of golden bone and jade body, named to enter the Azure Palace, who possess this text and secretly practise it, upon receiving the rite, unite with the supreme regulations, apply and govern in order, working with the true, atoning sins and removing difficulties, untying past knots; the ancestors of the seven mysteries rejoice thereby, ascend themselves, and feast in the Jade Palace."  

### The Mysterious Capital Nine Truths of Bright Regulation, Supreme Grade Transmission Scripture

The first supreme chapter of Mysterious Capital is called: "Great Scripture of Cavernous Truth", "Female One Precious Scripture", and "The Supreme Primordial Spirit Great Marvelous Scripture"—the three strange chapters, the supreme jade emperor’s precious chapters, secret in the Palace of Great Marvel above the Nine Heavens, in the Jade Chamber of the Supreme Mysterious Spirit Platform.  

At the beginning of the Old Code of the Supreme Emperor, the scripture is transmitted once in countless kalpas; the three ways are established; the study of truth daily increases. The Supreme Correct Code, within seven thousand years, may receive three transmissions. Attended by Jade Youth and Jade Maidens, each seven thousand in number, carrying incense and attending the spirit texts.  

According to the method of transmission, all must undergo a hundred days of fasting, divide golden buttons for oaths, give to the Jade Youth and Maidens, according to the Four Extremes Code. To transmit without following the code is to incur the sin of seven ancestors; the shadow ghosts labour; they swallow fire and eat iron; bear mountains and move stones to fill the limitless source; body embraced by the wind knife’s punishment, body destroyed and shape damaged, long confined in hell, never attaining immortality.  

The second supreme chapter of Mysterious Capital transmits "Great Cavernous Truth Scripture Thirty-nine Chapters" to later students, who swear an oath with ten taels of gold, twenty-five catties of copper, five pairs of golden buttons, one golden fish, one jade dragon, one tael of blue silk, binding buttons as oath. "Female One" swears with five taels of gold, fifty feet of five-colour brocade, one jin of incense, three pairs of golden buttons. "The Supreme Primordial Spirit Cavernous Truth Mysterious Scripture" swears with two taels of gold, one hundred feet of purple script, twenty-seven feet of blue brocade, five taels of red silk, one jin of incense, one tael of cinnabar.  

The Supreme Emperor with sincere oath must not have deficiencies; to have deficiencies is to violate the code. If teacher offends, the Jade Youth and Maidens are removed to their original palace within three years, body suffering the wind knife’s torture, naturally losing the scripture. Those receiving but not following the bright regulation all lose their forms and shapes, the seven ancestors and parents bear the northern Feng’s responsibility, endlessly reincarnating in the non-human way. Students must be cautious.  

The third supreme chapter transmits all golden named Eastern Floral, jade named Supreme Clarity, receiving "Supreme Dawn Luminous Script Imperial Chapter", "Purple Crossing Flame Light Mysterious True Transformation Scripture", "Supreme Clarity Transformation Seventy-four Directions", "Nine Truth Central Scripture", "Elixir Scene Dao Essence Secret Earth Eight Arts", "Dissolving Form, Escaping Transformation Flow Scene Jade Scripture", and "Seven Transformations Dancing Heaven"—all the nine heaven true kings, the Primordial Heaven King, the Supreme Heavenly Emperor Lord, and the Central Yellow Elder Lord receive these in the void of the supreme space, within the nine mysteries, the high chapters of emptiness and non-existence. All are secret in the great supreme spirit capital’s palace, within the purple chamber of the three prime lords, guarded by Jade Youth and Maidens, each three thousand in number.  

The primordial beginning’s first transmission is once per seven thousand kalpas; after the three ways are established, within seven years three transmissions are heard; within seven hundred years some have heard one transmission. Transmission requires fasting for ninety days, or thirty days, or nine days, with oaths and then transmission, giving Jade Youth and Maidens according to the "Four Extremes Bright Regulation". To transmit without following the code incurs the sin of seven ancestors and parents, filling the ghost officials’ ranks, endlessly doomed; body suffering the wind knife’s torture, naturally losing the scripture; immortality is denied; transmitters must beware.  

The fourth supreme chapter transmits the "Jade Emperor Chapter", bearing golden fish, jade dragon, thirty-two feet of blue silk, three pairs of golden buttons as oath; "Purple Crossing Flame Light" with fifty feet each of five-colour brocade, five taels of gold, five jin of aloeswood, one jin of pearls, one writing knife, seven golden fish, seventy feet of vermilion script as oath; "Supreme Clarity Transformation Seventy-four Directions" with forty feet of blue silk, ten taels of gold, six pairs of golden buttons, one jin of fine incense, golden fish and jade dragon as oath; "Nine Truth Central Scripture" with full code, hair-cutting and shaving as oath, now with ninety feet of white silk as definitive oath with respect to the nine truths number; one jin of blue silk, twenty feet of vermilion script, the sunrise oath; twenty-four feet of green silk, the moonlight oath; three pairs of golden rings, the trust of the impermanent youths’ transformation; "Elixir Scene Dao Essence Secret Earth Eight Arts" and "Dissolving Form, Transforming Flow Scene Jade Scripture" with ten taels of gold, one golden fish, one jade dragon, thirty feet of blue silk, forty feet of purple script, three pairs of golden rings; "Seven Transformations Dancing Heaven" with five taels of gold, one jin of incense, thirty-two feet of blue silk as oath.  

Faith and sincerity must not have deficiencies, or else it violates the code; if the teacher violates the supreme code, the Jade Youth and Maidens are removed, names erased and returned to northern Feng. Those receiving but not following the code lose souls and spirits, punished by wind knife; within three years naturally lose the scripture, never becoming immortals.  

The fifth supreme chapter transmits "Exorcising Demon Wisdom", "Jade Clarity Secret Book", "Precious Cavern Flying Firmament Supreme Profound Golden Chapter", "Purple Phoenix Vermilion Script Eight Scenes Morning Chart", "Golden True Jade Light", "Spirit Book Purple Script", "Golden Pendants Jade Belts", "Golden Root Supreme Scripture", "Three Heavens Correct Law"—all are treasures of the Supreme Daoist Lord, the Primordial Heaven King, and the Golden Palace Lord, secret in the Jade Clarity Palace, within the Golden Chamber and Purple Door, guarded by spirit texts, Jade Youth and Maidens, each three thousand in number.  

The primordial beginning’s first transmission is once per thousand kalpas; after the three heavens are established, within seven hundred years three transmissions are heard; within a hundred years some hear one transmission; Jade Youth and Maidens assigned per the "Four Extremes Bright Regulation". Teaching requires fasting ninety days, or thirty days, or nine days; to transmit without following the code is to incur the sin of seven mysteries and nine
