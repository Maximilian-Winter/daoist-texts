There was one called Yunwuzǐ, who was indeed the scion of the Primordial Sovereign of the Jade Void, the middle son of the Supreme Emperor. He embraced the jade embryo in the jade chamber, condensed cloud essence at the golden gate, contained sun and moon within the purple membrane, transformed the great dew to condense spirit, refined the embryo-breath to propel movement, appointed through kalpas to turn the wheel, transformed and was born among the Yuan clan, announced the yang way to attain truth. Thus, in the first year of the Supreme Sovereign, on the first day of the third month, as the heavenly radiance opened the dawn, he was born above the nine mysteries, a precious splendour in the immeasurable heaven; he beheld the sun upon the cloud cliff, shone golden visage in jade pavilion, conformed to the imperial base in the emperor’s design, modelled jade blossoms from nature, washed by the radiance of the nine spirits, poured with sweet fragrant jade springs, drank the spirit consort’s imperial ganoderma, nursed by the nine-refined flying frost; the divine dragon flanked his side, the jade phoenix shadowed his crown, purple vapour rose above, flowing light luxuriated upon his neighbours, the two symbols upheld his frame, the three dawns harmonised his truth, the divine states sang his wonder, the seven transformations changed his spirit, the spiritual wind swiftly moved his body, the returning fragrance stirred his dust, the desolate supreme void above, the desultory cave waves beside. At the age of twenty-nine, meditating subtly and contemplating the profound, attuned to nature’s principle and operation, appointed by time to shift course, not coveting imperial ways, roaming carefree the central plains, delighting in the supreme heavens, lingering in the purple sky, glancing through kalpas, finding delight and forgetting turning, steering not by my own control, standing forth as an exalted immortal. Thus named Script Emperor Tablet, his rank ascended to Supreme Truth, taught the three origins below, conferred the imperial title, at that time receiving the mandate, paying homage to the Jade Heaven, ascending the platform of the nine mysteries in the palace of great abundance, the purple phoenix jade capital's seven treasure pearl chamber, in the bright rosy pavilion, pure fasting jade pavilion, spiritual auspice announcing response, shoulders bearing circular light, night illuminating the divine candle, self-illuminating jade hall. Then the Void Sovereign Tao Lord, upon the empty cavity above, within the profound void, by means of the "Supreme Heaven Lang Script Jade Text Imperial Chapter," descended to grant to the Lord. At that time heavenly light was obscurely widespread, the three dawns returned the essence, the five stars shifted their courses, the seven origins operated spirits, the nine colours dazzled and shone, shining through jade clarity, flying smoke luxuriated, flowing through the eight abysses, ascending jade steps, myriad emperors assembled in the court, flying immortal feathered canopies, assisting wings of Supreme Truth, three thousand immortal youths and jade maidens respectively, holding scarves and scattering incense, spreading fragrance and sweeping dust. Thus the mandate was issued, summoning the five spirits, flying heaven returning wheel, riding empty netted smoke, divine phoenix drawing reins, spirit consort guiding immortals, illustrious sovereign opening the way, three paths merged in light, streaming lightning raised essence, swift chariot to the nine mysteries, gazing upon the jade palaces, feasting in the three origins, circling the jade heaven, roaming freely in the purple dawn. Thus unfolding the Lang Script upon the boundless cliff, chanting imperial chapters upon the blue clouds, managing ancestral roots by jade secret, commanding awe-inspiring spirits by jade text, singing wondrous melodies within the void, concentrating thoughts in the jade pavilion, governing the two polarities in the profound chart, holding imperial records among myriad immortals, overseeing earthly offices of the five sacred mountains, leading Supreme Truth through the three gates, commanding the boundless above, controlling the cave origins below, from heaven downwards, none do not submit to Supreme Truth; spirit is unfathomable, transformation nameless, near is hard to discourse, far cannot be sought, pure hard to contaminate, mixed hard to clarify, subtle and wondrous indeed; this is the imperial spirit of utmost virtue, majestic and high in honour.

The Supreme Heaven Lang Script is the soaring melody of the Nine Heaven Kings; the Jade Text Imperial Chapter is the upper text of the Nine Heavens. Both arise from the primordial beginning, born within the natural void, the Void Sovereign Jade Emperor received it at the Nine Mysteries. Thus the heaven kings inscribed their names upon it, casting gold into tablets, carving jade into chapters, gold engraved with jade characters to reveal precious texts. Secreted above the Nine Heavens in the palace of great abundance, the western flower jade maidens and golden dawn jade youths, three thousand each, serve as guards. Thus the nine emperors' highest saints ascend the jade steps thrice a month, attending divine banquets, operating through myriad kalpas, transmitting to the Supreme Truth kings. The way is profoundly subtle, the ancestor of many scriptures, wondrous and elegant, refined above the Nine Heavens; jade wisdom is bright and clear, penetrating the void, entering the profound; only those of supreme truth may partake, all having attained immortal status, not transmitted to middling immortals.

The Supreme Heaven Lang Script is the soaring melody of the Nine Heaven Kings; the Jade Text Imperial Chapter is the way of high spiritual mystery’s reflection, essence of the Nine Heavens, supervising myriad energies, governing the many scriptures. Those who cultivate the "Great Cave Thirty-nine Chapters," turning wind mingling with the one imperial way, "The Female One Jade Inspection Five Elders Treasure Scripture," explaining ancestral roots, and mastering the seven mysteries, without this text, the Nine Heaven Kings will not accept their voice; the nine energies entangle, the divine truth is displeased, heavenly demons invade the brightness, myriad trials come to disturb; thoughts do not penetrate the subtle, heaven does not open the gate. Those who cultivate many scriptures, take the Jade Text as foremost, chant in the silent chamber, quiet in the rosy courtyard, pass through the nine heavens freely, arrange and bind the upper mystery, command the jade palace to be astonished, myriad truths attend the pavilion, demons prostrate their sleeves, myriad trials dare not advance; as one wills to cultivate thus, the true way is obtained, myriad paths perfected, soaring to the supreme clarity. The essential secret is not burdensome; it is in this scripture, refining the heart with arduous practice, one may attain to the superior immortal.

Yunwuzǐ did not cultivate other ways but received the Void Sovereign Jade Emperor’s "Supreme Heaven Lang Script Jade Text Imperial Chapter," above the nine heavens, chanting wondrous chapters, roaming freely, stirring and pleased the divine truth, sending teachings to the three origins below, attaining the rank of Supreme Truth King. He transmitted it to Supreme Transformation True Man of Taihua, Eternal Life Lords of the Three Heavens, Supreme Harmony True Man, Eastern Flower Old Master, Commander of the Southern Pole, Central Marquis of the Western Terrace, North Emperor True Man, Nine Spirit Jade Sons, Supreme Spirit True Consort, Scarlet Essence Jade Youth, Mysterious Valley Master, Southern Mountain Red Pine, Zhongshan King Qiao, Purple Sun True Man, Western City King, Central Sovereign Master, Zhao Boxuan, Mountain Ancestor Sect, and others. Eighteen persons in all, all cultivating this way, their faces shining golden, shoulders bearing circular light, riding the void ascending the heavens, feasting in the purple court, transforming myriad directions, roaming at will, roaring commands and establishing attainments, summoning myriad spirits, restraining demons, deciding life and death, riding the heavens and smoke, entering and exiting the imperial court, all by means of the Jade Text to reach Supreme Truth. The King Lord commanded a seal to be conferred at Western City Mountain, bearing the golden name Emperor Tablet, green letters purple clear; those who are genuine shall obtain this text. Those who obtain it are a treasured secret, must not lightly transmit or leak the sacred chapters; if they do, the nine ancestors will be punished, eternally charged as ghost officials, locked long in hell, endless kalpas without pardon.

The Nine Heavens and Nine Kings are the root ancestors of myriad energies and emperors, the essence source of the Nine Qi. At the time when heaven and earth were not yet condensed, before the three dawns were bright, they were formed naturally and born within the void cavity, amidst the vast depths. After ninety thousand kalpas, the energies divided and each governed their domain, establishing the nine heavens; sun, moon, and stars shone by their decree; myriad energies flowing and evolving formed the true way. The Primordial Supreme Sovereign, Supreme Exalted Jade Void, born within the beginning of heaven, with thirty-nine emperors and twenty-four true ones, thus set up palaces and offices in order. The Supreme Sovereign’s precious scriptures all contain natural chapters for practice. The way of longevity, the formula for immortality, talismans and jade secrets all arise from the Nine Heaven Kings and pass to generations of the true ones. At the three-five change of cycles, the Nine Spirits respond in their times; later sages of the Nine Mysteries Tao Lords collated the original text, traversing ninety trillion nine thousand accumulated kalpas; the Supreme Sovereign’s regulations often do not correspond. The Tao Lord, on the first day of the ninth month in the first year of the Central Sovereign, at the jade heaven jade chamber golden palace upper court, commanded the Eastern Flower Azure Palace to seek the regulations of prostration and bowing, to record and collate the ancient texts, to revise and compile spiritual chapters, collecting three hundred volumes of precious scriptures, entrusting the premier azure youth lord to transmit to later learners who are jade-named genuine persons. All who study the way to seek immortality, but do not know whence the way arises, nor the source of precious secrets, wander in darkness to learn without ancestors, the true not descending, the way also not advancing. Those who desire immortality must seek the root of the Nine Heavens and obtain its original source; the way is all complete, immortality all accomplished. Yet the secret taboos of the Nine Heaven Kings are hidden above the great abundance palace of the Nine Heavens, not transmitted to the lower worlds. There is the mysterious name Emperor Chart, in golden letters of Supreme Clarity, revealing the workings and meetings; knowing the names of the Nine Heaven Kings, the kings dispatch twelve jade youths and nine jade maidens to guard the body. Observing the precepts by fasting ninety days or nine days, bringing nine taels of upper gold and ninety feet of purple text, swearing oath by the faith of the Nine Heavens, then is the master and alliance transmission. Do not lightly disclose the supreme spirit; examination extends to the seven ancestors, long burdened as ghost officials, bearing stone to move mountains, the body perishes at the three officials; immortality is utterly impossible.

Yudan Immeasurable Heaven King Supreme Heaven Lang Script Jade Text Chapter One

The supreme heaven empty cavity qi, condenses qi to form cloud camps. Our king stands as divine craftsman, his transformations like formlessness. Within formlessness is truth, the truth is born from non-being. Above the dim profound void, the desolate primordial essence; method and brightness illuminate marvelous awakening, profound movement comes to challenge. Constellations array the jade palace, flying rosy clouds surpass green jade. Radiant fall of the three dawns shines, flowing light luxuriates in purple clarity. Carrying collar at the jade scenic terrace, loosening ties at the phoenix city. Returning to heaven ascending nine ridges, to open unending age. Who can roam thus? Come seek my name. My name is easy to know, residing in the Eastern Flower court. One may transcend the mysterious capital, subtle thoughts contemplate imperial spirit.

Those who attain to practice this way, hold rank equal to the Nine Heavens, think subtle and most taboo, preserve spirit and true thoughts, spiritual auspices announce response, naturally ascending the dawn.

All who cultivate this way should, on the day of their birth’s eight segments, bathe and fast purely, enter the chamber correctly, facing east, knocking teeth thirty-six times, looking upward holding the Nine Heavens above, nine-coloured flying clouds and flowing light below, luxuriant chamber hall, quietly invoking the Nine Heaven King’s taboo names, preserving true spirit, then recite the Supreme Heaven Lang Script Jade Text chapters nine times once through, to celebrate the heavenly court, spirits rejoicing in the silent chamber, spiritual response to nine mysteries; according to ritual for nine years, one may ascend the flying glow, banquet with reins in the purple dawn.

This text is subtle and wondrous, the ancestor of myriad emperors; he who understands its secret becomes immortal king. Those who leak or lightly transmit it will die in the nine springs, be afflicted by seven ancestors, the cave filled with river sources, plundered for myriad kalpas; be cautious in its observance.

The jade text imperial chapters number two hundred and forty sounds, all primordial essence of the Nine Heavens, hidden names of myriad truths, to be carved on jujube heart wood, received at the pure spring on the precipice, applied to flying net scarves, facing north making vows to the Nine Heavens, receiving the Nine Heavens’ chapters. The disciple holds nine taels of upper gold, ninety feet of purple text, faces south bowing, the master reads the jade text, then imparts to the disciple. If the carving of the text and seal are not yet obtained, one may write with orpiment and blue-green ink on azure, make an alliance and impart; then gradually carve the text, ascending the mountain to make the alliance at the Nine Heavens.

If the jade text is carved on jujube heart wood, the seal stamp must not hang facing the four directions; place it in a jade box in a separate chamber, facing upright towards above, morning and evening burning incense and worshipping the Nine Heaven Kings. To summon the Eastern Peak immortal officer to inquire omens and auspiciousness, and connect spirit and truth, on the day of Jia or Yi, read the imperial chapters once facing east; then the immortal officer immediately arrives, speaks with the truth. To summon the Southern Peak, on the day of Bing or Ding, perform as above, then the Southern Peak immortal officer immediately arrives, speaks with the truth. For the Western Peak, day of Geng or Xin, as above, Western Peak immortal officer arrives, speaks with the truth. For the Northern Peak, day of Ren or Gui, as above, Northern Peak immortal officer arrives, speaks with the truth. For the Central Peak, day of Wu or Ji, as above, Central Peak immortal officer arrives, speaks with the truth. All methods of summoning the Five Peaks begin by facing the cardinal directions, knocking teeth thirty-six times, then reading the imperial chapters. With focused heart and fasting, no spirit fails to descend; if one’s body is sullied and unclean, not penetrating the profound dark, closing eyes and concentrating, all will see spirits. One will know deeply the secret and the dark, know omens of good and ill, and after nine years be of the same form as the truth, going out of emptiness entering non-being, roaming and feasting in the jade morning.

Those cultivating the way completely, have true immortals descend; cloud chariots and purple canopies come to welcome the body. They should imprint the imperial chapter seal on soles and hands to establish wing feathers, moving in accord with the sign’s ascent.

If in the hidden quiet places of the Five Peaks one cultivates and chants aloud, and strange beings feign true forms, descending to the sign’s chamber, one should apply the imperial chapter seal facing them; then truth and falsehood are immediately revealed. If a true immortal or celestial officer, the sign will bow and welcome, presenting requests at will, gaining essential words. If a demon spirit, it immediately returns to original form.

The sign should knock teeth thirty-six times, recite the imperial chapters once, demons immediately vanish and cease before the sign’s presence. This method only requires heart and mouth to correspond; be careful not to show others. Showing others leaks the truth, the way will not progress.

When the sign lies alone at night, he should place the imperial chapters upon his heart; then the Supreme Heaven true immortal comes to guard. The sign’s form and radiance respond in dreams, speaking with the truth; within nine years the sign will meet face to face with a true immortal.

All who receive the imperial chapter seal must not lightly disclose or show it to others. If seen by three persons, the way is lost and use fails.

All who cultivate this way must beware lest they tread in filth, offend true spirits, violating for nine years, the sign’s body will be punished.

If there is a profound chart imperial tablet, green letters purple writing, golden bones and jade marrow, named the register of the Azure Palace, the Nine Heaven Kings will send the four extremities true immortals to descend and grant the sign the jade text imperial chapters.

If there is a past fate and one encounters a bright master, all spiritually upright and meeting the gathering should obtain this text, then accomplish superior immortality. They should bring gold ribbon as trust, go to the master fasting, receive and cultivate. Without trust or alliance, heaven will not open spiritual gates, truth will not descend rank, immortality impossible. If the master transmits lightly and leaks, punishment extends to seven ancestors, long burdened as ghost officials; thus be cautious of the profound precepts, do not lightly proclaim.

All who transmit the "Supreme Heaven Lang Script Jade Text Imperial Chapter" should do so between high mountains and emptiness, placing flying net scarves facing north, incense cakes and jujube fruits placed, held in a separate tray, the scripture placed upon the flying net. The master faces north, knocks teeth thirty-six times, respectfully petitions the Nine Spirits Primordial True Mysterious Beginning Supreme Official, golden immortals and jade maidens, Supreme One Spiritual Deity, supervising true direct officials, five emperors and myriad truths, now there is a certain Mountain Lord, a certain Jia, purple netted embryo, past fate upright immortal, bringing gold ribbon trust, seeking to receive spiritual text, Nine Heavens true taboo jade text imperial chapters, heavenly precepts commanding caution, sworn treasured spiritual truth, willing humbly beneath divine light and mysterious reflection to serve; if the day of leakage comes, returning body to river source, seven ancestors apologizing, not daring again to ascend. Completed, holding scripture chapter in hand, given to disciple. Then, with cakes and fruits buried in the profound mountain within, not for other use. This is the secret profundity of the Nine Heaven Kings, the wondrous secret of Supreme Truth. Those who study but lack this heavenly precept strive in vain in empty mountains, receive no response in the silent court. Diligently turn to earnest resolve, contemplate the nine mysteries, the heaven kings are pleased, dispatch jade youths and jade maidens to guard the sign’s body; within nine years one may ride flying jade to ascend the Nine Heavens.
