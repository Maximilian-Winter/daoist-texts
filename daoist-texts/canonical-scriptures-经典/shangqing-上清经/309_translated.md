### The Secret Words of the Eight Paths of Shangqing

The secret words of the First Path say: On the day of Jia or Yi in the first month of the Beginning of Spring, at early dawn look northward; if there be purple, green, and white clouds, these are the Three Primal Lords of the Supreme (Heaven), riding on three pure flying clouds. At this time the Three Primes ride the wheels of eight chariots, and ascend to the Heavenly Sovereign Emperor. When you see these three-coloured clouds, keep in your heart the act of kowtowing and striking your breast; keep in your mind four prostrations; present yourself and entreat, saying: "Your descendant so-and-so, from youth inclined to the Way and Virtue, cultivates the Nine Truths, bathes in the Five Spirits, and is recorded in the registers of the Heavenly Emperor. This day, by good fortune, meeting the Three Primes on their journey, I beg to attend upon the wheels and axles, and to have my wishes granted at will." When one sees the carriage of the Three Primes, one ascends to immortality in broad daylight; one must prostrate oneself, keeping thought; a thousand and one observances are to be performed. The words of blessing and worship used on the paths of the eight directions are thus; this is what is called the Secret Words of the Eight Paths. Those not recorded among the immortals may not hear them.

Greenish-blue crown, light green mantle, red rising robe, red banner, five-coloured clouds, and boys dressed suitably.

The secret words of the Second Path say: On the day of the Vernal Equinox, and on the days of Yin and Mao, at midnight look northeastward; if there be dark blue, azure, and yellow clouds, these are the Three Pure Clouds of the Taiwei Heavenly Emperor. At this time the Taiwei Heavenly Emperor rides the chariot of eight splendours, and ascends to the High Supreme Jade Emperor. Those who see must in their hearts keep the act of worship and kneeling, as in the method above. When one sees the carriage of the Heavenly Emperor four times, in broad daylight there will be a dragon pavilion and feathered canopy coming forth to welcome and ascend to heaven.

Blue crown, red robe, blue edging, five-coloured clouds, and outwards dressed suitably.

The secret words of the Third Path say: On the day of the Beginning of Summer, and the early days of Jiazi, on the days Wuchen and Jisi, at early dawn look northwestward; if there be purple, blue, and yellow clouds, these are the Three Pure Clouds of the Supreme True Lord of the Supreme Ultimate inner palace of the Three Primes. At this time the Supreme True Lord of the Supreme Ultimate and the Three Primes ride the dark splendour green chariot, and ascend to the Purple Tenuity Palace. The heartâ€™s prayers are as above. If one sees the Supreme Ultimate green chariot five times, then one ascends to heaven in broad daylight.

Greenish-blue crown, light green clouds, crane mantle, red banner, and outwards also dressed suitably.

The secret words of the Fourth Path say: On the day of the Summer Solstice, and in the early days of Jiaxu, on the days Wuyin and Jimao, at early dawn look southeastward; if there be red, white, and blue clouds, these are the Three Pure Clouds of the Fusang Great Emperor. At this time the Fusang Great Emperor rides the chariot of radiant light of the eight paths, and ascends to the Taiwei Palace. Those who see it must keep heart and worship as above. If one sees it four times, in broad daylight there will be cloud-dragons to welcome and ascend to heaven.

Imperial golden crown, crimson robe, blue edging, red banner, five-coloured clouds, and outwards dressed suitably.

The secret words of the Fifth Path say: On the day of the Beginning of Autumn, and in the early days of Jiashen, on the days Wuzi and Jichou, at early dawn look due west; if white, red, and purple clouds appear, these are the Three Pure Clouds of the Supreme True Heavenly Emperor Lord of the White Emperor. At this time the Supreme True White Emperor Lord rides the refined rainbow jade carriage, and ascends to the Three Heavens Profound Emperor High True. You must worship as in the method above. If one sees it five times, then one ascends to immortality in broad daylight.

Golden crown, crimson robe, blue edging, red banner, five-coloured clouds, and outwards dressed suitably.

The secret words of the Sixth Path say: On the day of the Autumnal Equinox, and in the early days of Jiawu, on the days Wuxu and Jihai, at early dawn look southward; if there be blue, red, and yellow clouds, these are the Three Pure Clouds of the Southern Pole Supreme True Red Emperor Lord, riding the crimson lapis lazuli carriage, and ascending to the Langfeng Terrace to pay respects to the Lady of the Nine Spirits. If seen, worship accordingly, as in the method above. If one meets it, then one ascends to immortality in broad daylight.

Crown with gold between, crimson robe, blue edging, five-coloured clouds, dressed suitably without, as before.

The secret words of the Seventh Path say: On the day of the Beginning of Winter, and on the early days of Jiachen, on the days Wushen and You, at early dawn look southwestward; if there be green, purple, and blue clouds, these are the Three Pure Clouds of the Shangqing True Lord Emperor Ancestor. At this time the Shangqing True Lord Emperor Ancestor rides the dark splendour eight-light cinnabar chariot, and ascends to the High Supreme Nine Heavens Jade Emperor. You must in your heart reverently pray and kowtow as above. If one sees it four times, then the Purple Morning Taiyi Lord rides a phoenix-patterned feathered canopy to welcome you, and you ascend to heaven in broad daylight.

The secret words of the Eighth Path say: On the day of the Winter Solstice, and on the early days of Jiayin, on the days Wuwu and Jiwei, at early dawn look due east; if there be vermilion, green, and yellow clouds, these are the Three Pure Clouds of the Supreme True Lady of the Void, Jade Consort of the Supreme Firmament. At this time the Jade Consort of the Supreme Firmament rides the wandering jade carriage, and ascends to the Supreme Imperial Palace to summon the Taiwei Heavenly Emperor Lord. When you see these cloud colours, worship and pray as above. If one meets it thrice, then the Jade Emperor commands the Yellow Registrar of Destinies to come riding a dragon in a jade chariot to welcome you, and you ascend to the dawn in broad daylight.

Thus the secret words of the eight paths are completed. The seer must in heart perform four kowtows with striking of the cheeks, then four prostrations, and present themselves as above. First, one must bathe and burn incense, and wait for the appointed time, then look directly forth for the space of a meal, then return indoors; the three pure clouds each have their own colours, their colours and vapours overlapping above and below, accumulating as the order of the prayers. For example, on the Beginning of Spring, when seeing the Three Lights and Three Pure Clouds, the purple cloud is above, green cloud next, white cloud below, all overlapping mutually. You must watch them carefully. The early days refer to within ten days of the day of Jiazi, the first day of the month in which there is a Jiazi day. If it be not that day nor that time, and yet one sees these clouds, one must still worship and behold them, and reverently believe; then one will see them on their day.

Those who practice the Nine Truths and administer the affairs of the Eight Paths are guarded by the heavenly beings who protect the body; the True Emperors guard their life and bones. Those not having immortal names and jade registers may not be shown this scripture, though they seek it earnestly, they shall never see it. Those who walk this Way must not let others step on their shoes, lower their headgear or simple garments; their shoes and things must always be kept bright and clean; their garments and simple clothes must always be kept pure and tidy. In practicing this Way many prohibitions abound. It is said that the seven souls and remaining breath of man transform into dragons and tigers, guarding the earth gate of man, lurking beneath the shoes; the three souls and remaining spirits transform into the clouds of the Five Spirits, shining on the headgear. If one offends, the heart will tremble and the mind become arrogant; suddenly one loses oneself, whereby the spirit is impaired and the soul scattered, the essence and light become obscured and hindered. One must always be vigilant; beneath the shoes there must be no soil, nor the noxious vapours of dung or foul earth. The inside and outside of clothes and boxes must not be dirty or filthy, for they offend against the smell of purity.

The attendant scribes include the Supreme Jade Boys and Jade Girls, each seventeen in number. It is said that those who possess this scripture establish merit and reform faults, and suppress evil and misfortune. The gentleman who regards this scripture enters deeply into a quiet chamber, and burns incense on the left and right. At the time of transmission, one must be seated facing one another in fasting; only thus may the scripture be transmitted. The method of transmission requires each to fast and be quiet, to make sincere their hearts; the ghosts and spirits examine the truth to unify their purpose. The spiritual treasure concerns the affairs of the Nine Truths, and the names of the Twenty-four Spirits; keeping them in mind and reciting the prayers are all direct words of the Heavenly Will, hence the importance of fasting to receive it at the outset, and swearing an oath with the test of leakage.

Two persons fast facing one another for twenty-four days, and also fast one day before and after. When the scripture is completed and given to the disciples, the disciples after transcribing it cut their hair and bind it, then present it to the master as proof of sincerity; a white silk of nine zhang is joined as an oath, as a substitute for drinking and cutting as a sign of trust. The use of white plain silk is the energy of the Supreme Primordial; the use of nine zhang is the number of the Nine Truths. After receiving the scripture, one must not divulge or display it, boasting of virtue or criticizing correctness, nor speak much and fail in conduct, thus polluting the Dao and the True. Those who venerate and cultivate this scripture ascend to the dawn in broad daylight.

The attendant scribes, the seventeen Supreme Jade Boys, chiefly say that those who possess this scripture establish merit and reform faults, to suppress evil and misfortune.
