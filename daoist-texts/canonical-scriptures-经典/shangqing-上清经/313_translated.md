# Commentary on the Jade Formula and Pronunciations of the Supreme Purity Great Cavern True Scripture

### Title of the Scripture: Commentary on the Jade Formula and Pronunciations of the Supreme Purity Great Cavern True Scripture. Composed by the Daoist Chen Jingyuan of the Northern Song. One scroll. The original source: The Treasury of the Orthodox Dao, Cavern True Division, Jade Formula category.

Preface to the Commentary on the Jade Formula and Pronunciations of the Supreme Purity Great Cavern True Scripture, bestowed by Master Zhenjing, disciple of the Great Cavern Three Sights, composed by Chen Jingyuan of Purple.

The "Great Cavern True Scripture of Thirty-nine Chapters," its titles dignified and solemn, stands foremost among the precious scriptures of the Three Caverns. Its spiritual chapters and secret blessings, its jade examinations and hidden writings, are all recorded in detail. From the Supreme Lord of the Western City, the Perfect Lord of the Southern Pole, it was descended and conferred upon the Celestial Perfected of Clear Emptiness; Clear Emptiness transmitted it to Lady Wei of the Southern Mountain, saying: "If you are not within the mountains, but conceal yourself in a pure fasting, and breathe out and take in within emptiness, then the 'Great Cavern True Scripture' must not be read at random." The reason is this: the subtle sounds penetrate nine times, the true voice is sung on high; the literary breath and the jade emptiness partake of mystery; the flavour of the clouds flows freely with the sun. When lips move and utter, the jade splendour immediately arrives; when chanting spiritual phrases, it accords with the Supreme; when resting in stillness and joining hands, the purple chamber observes itself; when thoughts are fixed on the hoped-for, sympathy and response are stirred. Therefore the seven ancestors attained blessing, received the registers of the immortal palace, and passing beyond the ghostly shades, all feasted at the Vermilion Mound. This writing is lofty and subtle; controlling the chariot at dawn, riding the path of the scenic dragon above, it is not to be undertaken by those of the dusty world and vulgar customs. If one reads it amidst the vulgar, the Three Officials and Northern Emperor slightly disturb its sounds; the hearing of the breath becomes impure, and the clear response of Supreme Purity and the voice that partakes of the Purple Extreme's spiritual chamber cannot be obtained. The Central Yellow Lord of the Jade Essentials says in the Purple Book: "To behold the 'Great Cavern True Scripture of Thirty-nine Chapters' is to ascend to heaven by day; yet those who cultivate it for many years with no result say that the scripture is not true. This is all because of the lack of the Golden Tablet of the Eastern Flower, and the absence of the Jade Talisman of the Golden Gate; the true spirit does not descend, but spirits of heaven and demons come instead, so there is no effect of response, and merely obtaining the divine scripture will not suffice." But if one were to first present the Golden Tablet at the Azure Palace, receive the Jade Talisman at the Emperor's Court, and be given the Golden Morning and Jade Youth, the Western Floral Jade Maiden to guard the sacred writings, widely beneath the heavens and earth, all three worlds would commend it; chanting the chapters thousands of times, how could it fail to bring the feeling of the jade carriage and purple litter? This scripture has descended to the world; only the phrases of Yang and Xu, the Perfected of the Three Nine Chapters, the Captain Sima Lian of Wangwu, and all the high Daoists of successive ages have all followed the prescribed methods, transmitting the secrets by mutual agreement, orally teaching the methods of chanting, and secretly imparting the subtle mixtures. Hence it is called the Book of the Golden Standard, treading the path of Supreme Purity. Now the true wind has dispersed, false concealment in the mountains abounds; the model of the Dao is unheard; masters and disciples and rites are abandoned; the teaching methods are decayed and ruined—none more so than this. Jingyuan, from his youth entering the order, seeking the Dao in his early manhood, travelling scarcely thirty years, leading more than ten years, returned old to Maoshan, built a hut to repent, lamenting that his Dao affinity was thin and dusty karma heavy. Although diligently teaching the canon, he did not meet a true master; desiring to chant the Cavern Scripture, how dared he open the treasury? Therefore, he washed and purified body and mind, earnestly applied himself to reverence and purity, widely sought the ancient editions, carefully examined and studied in detail, delved deep in search, repeatedly scrutinised and composed, every phrase and word never omitted. When two meanings conflicted, confusion increased; for instance, such as "fa xi" (hair smoke) and the like. Or partial alterations and careless changes, characters floating and mixed; as "qi" written as ＠, or ＠ written as "ge" and the like. These are certainly from stolen copies privately transmitted, handed down with errors. Thus he took the foundation of study from former masters, who said the Three Cavern Daoists Master Guan Miao, Master Zhu Ziying, and Master Chong Miao Huangfu Xi, all chanted the Cavern Scripture, and were men of the Heavenly Sage era. When comparing with the Maoshan treasury edition and the hidden writings, he composed the pronunciations and meanings, with annotations on agreement and discrepancy, roughly explaining doubts, but did not dare show these to the principles of the Dao, merely recording what he surveyed. Thus in the third month, fasting heart, he carefully wrote the Cavern Scripture Jade Formula in one fascicle, reverencing it morning and evening, looking upwards to the spiritual beings, relying on the method of bestowal, to repay his long-cherished resolve.

The Dao count is the matter of the Cavern True Emperor of the Great Cavern. One edition writes as seven awakenings inherit the counting of the Dao, probably mistaken. Piao Can pauses at northern Hua, purple flower sings east (Wang’s wife), Lin He beyond the nine skies, jade tally summons Taiwei (Wang’s wife), the rhyme is not collected, no sound to explain. According to the Demonic Extinction Scripture’s Entering Meditation chapter: "Piao Can stops at Lang Hua, purple cinnamon quietly dwelling, Lin Shi sounds in the nine skies, jade token summons Taiwei," the meaning is the same as the Cavern Scripture; the parenthesis (Wang’s wife) is likely a transmission error.

According to the Daoist Lord’s Jade Commentary: "If not Miao Xun Yun Jing and the golden chamber do not ascend, if not repeatedly chanting the Cavern chapters, the jade guests do not appear."

According to the "True Ascent Hidden Formula" Second Scripture Transmission Rules: "Among the Great Cavern True Scripture there are now two editions in the world, one is a large scroll, earlier having the Return Wind Mixed Way, and the words mostly falsely appended, and largely counterfeit; one only has thirty-nine chapters, in which there are several words agreeing with those spoken by Right Hero, and mutually mingled, not to be distinguished; one must personally see the true edition to follow and use it. Further, it is heard that those who obtain the Yang Xu thirty-nine chapters differ not from the small edition in the world; since not yet seen with eyes, the right or wrong cannot be determined, and it is proper to transcribe to supplement the catalogue. There is also a jade commentary in one scroll, which is a brief explanation of the meaning in the Cavern Scripture, also worthy to copy. Further according to the 'Purple Essentials Jade Root Scripture,' the Central Yellow Lord says: 'To behold the "Great Cavern True Scripture Thirty-nine Chapters" is to ascend to heaven by day; yet those who cultivate it for many years with no success say the scripture is not true. This is due to lack of the Golden Tablet of the Eastern Flower, and absence of the Jade Talisman of the Golden Gate; the true spirit does not descend, but spirits of heaven and demons come instead, so there is no effect of response, merely obtaining the divine scripture will not suffice. If one were to first present the Golden Tablet at the Azure Palace, receive the Jade Talisman at the Emperor’s Court, be supplied with Golden Morning and Jade Youth, Western Floral Jade Maiden guarding the sacred writings, widely beneath heavens, all three worlds would commend, chanting the chapters ten thousand times; how could it fail to bring the feeling of the jade carriage and purple litter?' "
