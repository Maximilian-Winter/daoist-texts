### The Scripture of the Ascending Clarity Yellow Qi Yang Essence Three-Path Sequential Circulation

The Lord of the Southern Pole Ascending Origin said: I have received the essentials of the three-path sequential circulation of the Most High Ascending, the way of the Yellow Qi Yang Essence, to govern and control the spiritual radiance, sip the imperial flowers with the mouth, look upward to feast upon flying roots, preserve the seven luminaries within the purple radiance, travel the three paths at the Golden Gate, delve the vast and narrow within abyssal radiance, discern the directions and circles of sun and moon, behold the vermilion steps at the Bright Yang, enter to refine the intestines at the Vast Cold, ascend the seven treasures at the Mysterious Garden, grasp the flying ladder at the Spirit Pass, return the yang essence at Floating Dawn, gather yellow qi at the Dense Single, lean upon golden wings at the tall trees, pass the stone scene to reflect the visage, cultivate the governing spiritual chart, and thereby evoke the divine truth. Then the three radiances descend and shine; the seven essences wing the pavilion; the five spirits interlace bands; the four supervisors bind the chapters; the Western Turtle fixes the record; the name inscribed at the morning heights; thus the rank ascends to the Lord of the Southern Pole Ascending Origin. This way is supremely subtle, not to be discoursed on by narrow scholars. Now gathering what has been received, I briefly explain the high words of the Jade Emperor, to mark the mysterious natural spiritual texts, entrusted to the Prime Minister Azure Youth Lord, who oversees the mysterious palace; after ten thousand kalpas, it shall be given to those recorded in the mysterious white slips and azure register. Such spiritual scriptures, purple texts and the Eight Elemental True Scriptures, Purple Mist Inner Viewing of the Solar Radiance Middle Mystery, each speaks of their regulations, valuing the governance only, but cannot encompass the great root source, the widening expanse of dissolution. It may be said to grasp the branches without fathoming the roots, obtaining the way without its origin. Therefore study should be broad and thorough, requiring upper and lower to complete; cultivate beginnings and practice ends, perfect the way and fill the qi, and nothing will fail to become immortal. The sun extends widely two thousand and forty li; within the golden division is the water essence halo; the flowing light shines outward; within are cities, walls, and people; seven treasures and bathing pools; four kinds of lotus flowers grow blue, red, yellow, and white. People measure two zhang four chi tall, wear vermilion robes, waxing and waning with the four kinds of flowers; hence the four seasons of spring, autumn, winter, and summer proceed. The sun’s course is accompanied by five winds: one the time wind, two the path wind, three the assisting wind, four the turning door wind, five the moving wind. Therefore the regulation of sun, moon, stars, and constellations, roaming the void qi, initially without rest, are all the brahman of the wind’s net.

The waxing and waning of the sun and moon are the assemblage of the four seasons, concealed and veiled in the crown and belt. Above the Golden Gate the sun travels in brightness. Within the Golden Gate is the pool of golden essence refining, at the western pass of Ye Ni’s division. On the day of the Beginning of Spring, one receives the refining soul within the Golden Gate, radiating its bright light outside the Golden Gate. At this time, the light and scene are soft and fresh, the universal qi warm; in the year it passes once thus, lasting forty-five days before ceasing. Each month it passes five times, refining the eight points on the Golden Gate’s summit; the essentials are set forth in the Eight Elemental Scriptures. Sequentially it proceeds to the Bright Yang Palace. The upper hall of Bright Yang Sun, also named Li Luo, lies in the division of Floating Dawn. On the day of the Beginning of Summer, it expels golden refining essence at the Bright Yang Palace, to irrigate the Bright Yang Palace, further refining the eight points in the court of flowing fire. At this time, the sunlight is dim and flourishing, yang qi overflows and disperses, and the entire heaven feels great heat; in the year it passes once thus, lasting forty-five days before ceasing. Sequentially it proceeds to the East Well. The East Well is the path of the moon communicating brightness, lying in the division of Lu. On the day of the Beginning of Autumn, the sun bathes in the halo within the East Well, gathering the essence of the eight elements, returning to the Vast Cold Palace. At this time the heavenly scene is high and clear, the universal qi cool; in the year it passes once thus, lasting forty-five days before ceasing. Sequentially it proceeds to the Vast Cold Palace. The Vast Cold Palace is the upper hall of the moon palace, the floral canopy of the seven stars, at the boundary of the Dense Single. On the day of the Beginning of Winter, the sun essence lies concealed in the Vast Cold Palace, further crowning and nurturing the fetus. At this time the sunlight is shadowed, the universal heaven cold; in the year it passes once thus, lasting forty-five days before ceasing. The sun’s annual circuit covers the crown and belt of the four regions, totaling one hundred and eighty days, the divisions of the sun’s course; the other one hundred and eighty days belong to the moon’s circuit; the two radiances separate and join, yin and yang wax and wane, each with their limits of division and degree.

Within the Golden Gate stands the towering Gao Qian tree, four thousand li tall, branches extending two thousand li, circumference two hundred and eighty li, roots deep eight hundred and forty li; atop it #l(Ascends to Heaven, the Jade Emperor hearing its valour and fierceness, orders to guard the North, commanding the position of True Warrior, to sever all the world’s demons and evils. The True Immortal addressed the Celestial Lord, saying: How did you obtain this divine general, entering below, collecting and eliminating demons and ghosts, saving myriad beings, rescuing those who perish unjustly, and thereby the sun gains benefit each day. Humbly praying to the Great Compassionate Celestial Lord to grant the requested. Then he ordered the Right Attendant Jade Youth to swiftly issue a decree with true talisman, straight to the North, summoning the True Warrior divine general. The deity, once summoned, marshalled divine hosts, came directly before the Celestial Lord, knelt long, and said: I have received the Jade Emperor’s command, positioned to guard the North; today by what reason do I behold your compassionate countenance, specially summoned by the talisman?

The Celestial Lord said: I am at the Ascending Origin Palace, holding a great assembly to preach the law; suddenly below, black poisonous resentful qi rushes to the heavenly realm, causing all the assembly to be alarmed. You should go there, collect and sever demons and monsters, rescue and save the souls. The True Warrior divine general, with reverence to the Celestial Lord’s teaching and command, then dishevels his hair and bares his feet, treading the flying serpent, eight trigrams, divine turtle; marshals three hundred thousand divine generals, the six dings six jia five thunder divine soldiers, giant dragons, lions, poisonous dragons, fierce beasts, leading before and behind, all arriving at the lower realm. Within seven days, all the demons and monsters of the world are simultaneously collected and cut off, humans and ghosts separated, resentful souls dispersed, the living peaceful, the land clear and tranquil. The True Warrior divine general and all the troops return to the Ascending Origin Palace, present before the Celestial Lord saying: Yesterday by command I proceeded below to collect and slay demons and monsters; relying on the compassionate power, within seven days all evil ghosts of the world were entirely cleansed. The Celestial Lord said: Well done! You gods, have you not laboured? Thereupon the True Warrior divine general laid out the Qian fabric battle array, the Kui Gang arousing fingers, assisting the celestial gate, and made the incantation:

Great Yin generates life, essence of the water position, vacuous and elevated response above, turtle and serpent combine forms, encircling the six harmonies, awe-inspiring all spirits, none hidden unexamined, no wish unfulfilled, end of kalpas and beginning of kalpas, cutting and pruning demon essences, saving and protecting all beings, families and nations all peaceful,

In the midst of numbers, the last Jia, demonic qi flows, the Supreme Emperor commands. I therefore descend spirits, expound the orthodox law, purge evil and repel weapons, transform and nurture the multitudes, assist and praise the restoration; should any minor ghost attempt to manifest, my eye beholds it at once, the Five Mountains collapse and overthrow.

Swiftly, swiftly, as law commands.

Rampant, ravaging, poisoning, disturbing the living, families afflicted, years of official punishments, wealth dispersed, kin desolate, life unjustly lost, disasters entangled; foul and turbid qi reaches the heavenly court; the Celestial Lord commands and orders peace;

All demons are cut down, no ghost escapes burning; plague officials bow and respond; ghost spirits perish, evil demons collapse;

Above it #3 the golden-winged crow, its wings encircle the domain; below is the court of flowing fire, stretching eighty thousand li, within which is the fiery light of eight refinements of the natural mysterious elixir.

The right purple written elixir characters for the hidden moon soul sounds, all inscribed on the moon’s southern boundary sky-blue forest, constitute the natural scripture. Eight elemental true men and myriad heavenly beings all on the day of Summer Solstice gather purple written elixir characters and wear them. Those who wear these six characters, together with the eight elements in the same year, then neck bears round brightness, illuminating ten directions. The method is supremely secret; the emperor’s eight elemental true men inscribe these sounds in the eight elemental jade seal, thus it is the high supreme wondrous scripture. Lightly revealing spiritual sounds incurs the seven ancestors’ retributions, long perish knife mountain, body perish wind knife, never attaining immortality.

One should on the day of Summer Solstice at midnight wear on white paper in cinnabar characters, knock teeth twelve times, whisper the incantation:

Yang essence elixir pool, flowing fire intense storm, golden pavilion wing void, mysterious radiance brushes sky, eight elements gather orchid, scatter fragrance jade court, blue forest hanging willow, wind shakes jade branches, elixir characters purple text, containing beauty bright and lofty, flowing fragrance irrigates salivation, universally moist without limit, obtain with mysterious radiance, equal light purple sky.

Incantation completed, swallow qi twenty-four times. Again written elixir characters in purple, worn on head three years, sun moon mysterious radiance illuminates destined shape, moonlight lady grants destined true book, grants six jade maidens. Lightly transmitted not true, seven ancestors bear retributions, ten thousand kalpas no remission. Secret cultivation eight years, then cloud carriage descends, white sun ascends heaven, flying and ascending Jade Clarity.

The right moon circuit traverses four regions, thus has new and full moon dates; sun way is yang, moon way is yin, though moving together and turning, in crown and belt each occupies four seasons. Therefore sun divides one hundred eighty days yang, moon divides one hundred eighty days yin, numbers traverse three thousand six hundred degrees, combined with sun, then yang qi intensifies, yin qi declines, then sun nine numbers move around, heaven and earth change lodgings, myriad plagues scatter and disperse, eliminate evil and remove harm. Those who do not know heaven and earth’s movement cannot avoid the calamities of sun nine.

All accumulated learners rarely sit and reach the dragon carriage, and ascend the cloud gate. Vainly laboring on mountains and cliffs, cutting off valleys and swallowing saliva, practicing governance of sun and moon yet unaware of mysterious radiance divisions, broad and narrow city walls, seven treasure vermilion forests, moving lodgings of four regions, waxing and waning periods, flying roots unattainable to pluck, imperial flowers unattainable to gather, yang essence therefore not descending, yin essence therefore not reflecting, the way of sun and moon seems distant. If one can diligently seek its root, know there is movement and degree of scene, city walls, hills and marshes, vermilion forests and abyss pools, surname and name of the lady in the moon, then sun and moon respond and descend, also no trouble of distant seeking or difficulty, naturally able to ride cloud carriage, flying wheel, ascending the gates of sun and moon.

Purple written elixir characters composed of the eight elements’ natural qi, high mysterious feather seal, to produce the moon’s eight towers’ forest, characters bear purple light, shining with the moonlight’s brightness. Eight elemental true men and myriad heavens all gather the eight towers’ forest purple written elixir characters and wear them, scattering fragrance to brush sun and moon light. This sound fully expresses the great Cave True Scripture, thus called the high supreme text. Those who wear this character bear golden countenance, neck bears round brightness, sun and moon cave reflect, without study become immortal. The method is very weighty, secret of the high supreme, not to be lightly revealed. According to the statutes, within seven hundred years, if one has golden name East Flower, purple character Ascending Clarity, a true person, allowed three transmissions. Without this bone, secret of Jade Pass, ten thousand kalpas not disclosed.

The right eight refinements golden refining transformation immortal true talisman, on the day of Beginning of Spring, yellow written on blue paper, cast into water to bathe, then the whole body is refined and transformed, attracts sun and moon’s mysterious radiance, descends true man to jade court. Also yellow written blue silk, worn for eight years, converse with true man, descend to cloud carriage, fly ascend to Golden Gate summit, receive refining at golden refining pool.

The right eight refinements elixir fetus jade talisman, on the day of Beginning of Summer at midday, cinnabar written on yellow paper, cast into water to bathe, then internal and external refine and transform, attract flying roots in yang essence, bring yellow qi to yellow flower, return sun and moon to mystery reflection, move true man in jade characters. Also cinnabar written yellow silk, worn for eight years, true man descends, grants destined true writing, flying the void profound, ascending Bright Yang Palace.

The right dragon scene nine refinements talisman, on the day of Beginning of Autumn at dusk, blue written on white paper, cast into water to bathe, then bone marrow refines and changes, attracts mysterious radiance in purple scene, brings yang essence to flying roots, receives yellow qi in jellyfish, descends true man in purple pavilion. Also blue written white silk, worn for eight years, head bears sun round brightness, flying great palace, ascending Broad Spirit Hall.

The right sun soul refining yin talisman, on the day of Beginning of Winter at midnight, black written on blue paper, cast into water to bathe, whole body blood essence refined and transformed, brings sun essence to purple scene, descends flying flowers to eight towers, refines five palaces in jade pool, moves destined body in Vast Cold. Also black written blue silk, worn for eight years, body emits golden light, neck has round brightness, true man descends, grants destined true writing, flying in great void, ascending Vast Cold Palace.

The seven stars are forty thousand li from earth, circumference seven hundred and twenty li, all golden essence lapis lazuli form their city walls, seven luminaries purple radiance imprint their light; within are myriad heavenly beings’ many true mans’ roaming pavilions; Vast Cold is their floral canopy. One day and night is one degree of the celestial circuit, also like the wheels of sun and moon. Within also grows seven treasure vermilion forests. Thus after fixed life, at the beginning of life force, the seven stars refine in Vast Cold Palace, bright fresh purple scene in the seven luminaries’ radiance. At this time the seven luminaries shine and fall, flowing essence fills the sky, purple scene emits salivation to irrigate the heavens, so all true emperors and immortals at this time all gather seven luminaries’ radiance and purple scene’s orchids.

All advanced students, practicing the way of sun and moon, should cultivate the wonderful method of seven luminaries. Each after fixed life, should in a separate room burn incense, lie facing north, calm body and mind, abandon strange thoughts, fix the spirit, knock teeth twenty-four times, hold the thought of seven stars shining brightly in the north, lie beneath the seven stars’ big dipper floral canopy, seven luminaries’ radiance flows brightly beyond purple scene, crowns and covers the self, self is atop purple scene within seven luminaries, within and without dense and dark, seeing nothing. After a while, dispel the seven luminaries’ light, transform into seven children, each on one star. The first child named Shu Ming, second child named Yao Ling, third child named Bei Yuan, fourth child named Bao Jing, fifth child named Dan Ying, sixth child named Xu Qing, seventh child named Zi Ying. The seven children emit seven treasures’ light, to feed and nurture the destined body. Shu Ming child emits purple scene light, Leap Spirit child emits golden essence light, Bei Yuan child emits lapis lazuli light, Bao Jing child emits silver light, Dan Ying child emits jade essence light, Xu Qing child emits precious pearl light, Zi Ying child emits coral light. The seven treasures’ light together enter the destined body, then draw in qi forty-nine swallows, whisper the incantation:

Golden essence condenses and transforms, binds primal seven spirits, purple radiance shines and falls, vermilion scene bright and clear, floral canopy lingers, revolves cold court, treasure light glittering, seven leaps lively, mysterious radiance emits orchid, fragrant ganoderma flows full, evening rests spiritual pavilion, morning ascends Jade Clarity, stellar pathway moves, purple scene wings form, feast reins cloud wheel, urge and govern flying carriage, roam the eight extremes, three paths unite.

Incantation completed, swallow saliva seven times and stop, rise and rub the body with millet flour, lie down. Thus seven years, body bears seven treasures’ light, head has purple scene floral canopy, constantly crowns destined shape, able to command and ascend with seven jade youths, orderly govern flying cloud carriage, come to welcome destined body, ascend North Star. This way is secret and wondrous, cultivated by Supreme True, not practiced in lower worlds. If one carves mysterious names on slips before birth, recording in azure register and jade text, such a one shall obtain this way. Those who obtain it become supreme immortals, teachers and patriarchs of myriad immortals. Lightly revealing causes blindness and punishment mutilation, seven ancestors bear retribution of knife mountains and fire eating, three hells and ten thousand kalpas no remission. Learners must be clear and cautious, the purpose of the four extremes, deeply treasure it. These seven children are the inner essences of the seven treasures, transformed into supreme true on the seven luminaries; knowing their names means not dying, practicing their methods means becoming immortal; revealing their taboo causes blindness. Morning and evening remembrance constantly guards the destined body. If encountering disaster or distress, knock teeth seven times, call the names of the seven children, the disaster immediately dissipates. This way is properly known to be kept secret, treasured as jewels, how could it be scattered in dust? Be clear and cautious and secretive.

The Most High commands the Four Supervisors, Five Emperors and myriad heavenly kings, to dispatch divine overseers, constantly treading the Five Mountains and various famous mountains. In the world there are three path essentials, the way of Yellow Qi Yang Essence, the script of elixir characters purple letters, then register names at East Flower, submit memorials at Golden Gate, with seven jade youths and seven jade maidens guarding the scripture bearer. If lightly revealed spiritual sounds or disrespect precious text, jade youths will report and punish with Five Emperor divine soldiers, death and service in the three hells and five sufferings, seven ancestors bear retribution, ten thousand kalpas no remission.

To practice the essentials of the three paths, one should on the moon’s third, fifteenth, and twenty-fifth days, in one month, three mornings receive sun and moon’s light, at midnight then greet the seven stars’ essence, bow heart and mind, wishing to ascend the three lights’ scenery, wear and govern spiritual radiance. Thus for seven years, then sun and moon respond and descend, granting the son the way of divine truth.

If one has golden name and jade character, registers memorials in the mysterious diagram, should receive this text; the master should observe fasting ninety days, or twenty-seven days, or three days; the disciple carries seven taels of gold, forty chi of yellow ribbon, thirty-two chi of blue silk, declares the covenant and transmits. Without covenant, lightly revealing, the master suffers test and demise, the disciple lightly spies the heavenly truth, loses covenant and suffers punishment mutilation, seven ancestors bear guilt, three captures no remission. The heavenly writing is profoundly weighty, purple written elixir characters supremely secret; therefore by covenant and trust treasure it, not to be lightly transmitted; learners suffer this test, be clear and cautious. Such spiritual scriptures are born within the great void, inscribed upon the mysterious garden, under the shadow of piled stones, enclosed in golden halls and jade chambers. Spiritual texts shine brightly, purple characters dense in the sky, divine children wing spirits, jade maidens scatter fragrance, each three thousand guard divine truths. The Southern Pole Ascending Origin Lord received it from the Most High, cast covenant in the great void, transmitting to the Supreme Emperor of the Great Microcosm; the Emperor transmits to Western Turtle Queen Mother; the Queen Mother transmits to Golden Gate Emperor; the Emperor entrusts to Prime Minister Azure Youth Lord, who imparts it to later disciples who become true men. Now sealed in one volume at Western City Mountain.

All who study immortality but do not practice this way, vainly awaken truth, may only obtain lower immortality, not death only, hoping to pass the heavenly gate and ascend Golden Gate is forever impossible. Having mastered the three paths, practicing eight refinements, though not flying by daylight, on the day of hidden transformation naturally changes, ascending Golden Gate and four regions palaces, further receiving refining at jade pool, given golden wing feather robes, ascending Golden Gate palace. Therefore this method is exalted and wondrous, not equal to ordinary scriptures. Those who obtain its text need not study and become immortal. Zhonghuang immortals, mysterious children, Master Mo Di, Zhao Yanfu, Ning Kangbo, Peng Jian, An Qi, disciples of Bo Gao numbering seven hundred, sought the way practicing hardship, spirit penetrating Jade Void, though soaring to sky heights, roaming Five Mountains, did not obtain the essentials of the three paths, thus could not ascend within Golden Gate, receive audience at Golden Gate. Now by whirlwind body cloud void, riding jade clarity reins, commanding to welcome supreme true, what is different from those who begin study and toil in the lower world, hoping to ascend the cloud gate and roam? Like Su Zilin, Gu Xi, Young Yang Lord, Wang Qiao, Chi Song, Huang Ren, Qing Zhen and disciples, who at beginning study immediately practice the essentials of the three paths, the methods of Yellow Qi Yang Essence and elixir characters purple letters, readily transcending the Three Clarities, ascending the Blue Flower palace, further receiving the upper supreme wondrous scriptures, visiting Golden Gate to receive title, ranking to Jade Clarity supreme true of the Four Extremes. Is this not different from others aspiring? Lord Wang transmitted the scriptures to the Southern Mountain lady, now sealed in the Southern Cave of the Sun Bathing Palace; those with aspiration diligently seek its text.

The Scripture of the Ascending Clarity Yellow Qi Yang Essence Three-Path Sequential Circulation is ended.
