### The Shangqing Qiong Palace Spirit-Flying Six Jia Register

The Shangqing Qiong Officers Spirit-Flying Six Jia Jade Maidens, sixty in number, with secret names and characters inscribed on the left and right upper talismans; the Supreme True Nine Capitals Supreme Emperor Supreme Ultimate Four Perfected Ones received it from the Supreme Jade Morning High Sage Dao Lord. The left and right Spirit-Flying Six Jia talismans, one named Jade Essence True Secret, one named the Way in the Midst of Light, one named White Feather Black Wing Hidden Journey Upper Scripture, are the spirit-flying Six Jia divine ways. The spirits of the Six Jia ride the six dragons in their appointed times to feast on the clouds of celebration, gazing upon the Sixfold World, and returning to submit to the talisman-bearer’s chamber. On the Eight Festivals, they ride in the carriage of the white luan, drawing the black-winged phoenix, to feast on the constant yang reversed light, watching and roaming among the eight directions of the divine mountains. Returning to submit to the talisman-bearer’s body, they harmonize the soul and spirit, communicate with the numinous and penetrate form, the three qi blend with incense, the five viscera producing blossoms; sitting and standing between life and death, they command and summon myriad demons, tread on sharp edges and traverse dangers, myriad gods come to harmonize, cross mountains and enter waters, follow coasts and step rivers; they do not weary of beams and rafters, nor fear summits and precipices, transforming and hiding in concealment, summoning wind and calling thunder, raising clouds and rain, sitting to produce food, entering battles unharmed, entering water unsoiled, mountain spirits serve and guard, jade maidens come to welcome. Wearing them for six years, the Six Jia will appear to the body, speak with men, confer true writings to offspring, grant long life with heaven and earth, the two images in accord with the talisman. One must retire to a separate chamber without mixing, abandon lust and forget desire, still the heart and mirror the form—only then can one seek to see.

The Supreme Ultimate Four Perfected Ones say: The six qi follow their course through the ten heavens, the Six Jia patrol through the nether darkness; with these talismans one may be hidden and transformed without bounds; hearing their names one supplements the heavenly truth; practicing their way one flies through the void and drives the light; wearing their inscriptions, the jade maidens hold the kerchief. Use them six years, and only then may one be named in the Jade Slip of the Blue Palace. Practice nine years, and myriad gods serve and protect, perfected ones construct chambers. Practice fourteen years, the Tai Su Three Primal Lords welcome you with the feathers of the three dawns, clothe you with the cloud mantle of purple brilliance, ride the eight scenes at night, ascend Kunlun in the morning, wave the tiger banner to summon the festival, blow phoenix music to sing the profound, myriad gods support the chariot, gather wind and summon clouds, the Great One reins the reins, the white sun rises at dawn.

The Six Jia Spirit-Flying Left and Right Jade Maidens, sixty in number, with names and characters, each Jia day at dawn, looks towards the king’s direction inside the closed moon, retaining the jade maidens of one ten-day cycle of the Six Jia, all come to stand before me, clothing and form as above; after a while complete, one clicks the teeth six times through all passages, swallows saliva sixty times over; finished, then a subtle incantation is uttered:

Left Flying, Right Spiritual, Eight Scenery Floral Essence,  
Above planting the jade chamber, below flourishing cinnabar jade,  
Joining the eight epochs, commanding myriad beings,  
Divine power accumulates feelings, six qi refines clarity,  
Cloud palace jade brilliance, riding the void following life,  
Brocade mantle scarlet skirt, rosy clouds reflect purple chamber,  
Waist belt tiger script, feather cords erect azure,  
Hand holds divine talisman, flowing gold fire bell,  
Waving away evil, repelling demons, protecting my integrity,  
Cutting off and binding myriad demons, all evil annihilated,  
Together roaming the Three Primes, returning to old and reversing youth,  
Sitting and standing between life and death, attending me are the Six Ding,  
Fierce beasts guard the body, following with heavenly soldiers,  
Breathing rivers and seas, mountains and valleys flowing and collapsing,  
Finally arriving at the food hall, golden nectar jade wine,  
Binding tigers and leopards, shouting in the nether darkness,  
Commanding and employing ghosts and spirits, subduing a thousand spirits,  
Whatever is wished follows the heart, all matters are accomplished,  
Separating from the way dispersing the body, freely transforming shape,  
Supplementing the perfected ones above, heaven and earth born together,  
Ears acute and eyes like mirrors, thoroughly seeing the Yellow Court,  
Six Jia jade maidens are my envoys.

When the incantation is finished, then close the eyes. At first, in thought, one should sit upright, placing the hands on the knees, do not let others see it; if seen, the true light will be disordered, thought and feeling scatter; in every thought retain the mind, and do not entertain other thoughts; one must guard against this. When about to wear the talisman, first call the jade maiden’s name of the direct day; then a subtle incantation is uttered:

Heaven mysterious, earth yellow, great void six qi,  
Morning wearing spiritual essence, spirit golden tiger pattern,  
Command me true, also command me divine,  
Disperse and scatter form and shadow, seal mountains and summon spirits,  
Command and employ myriad essences, sitting between death and life,  
High roaming Shangqing, north facing Jade Morning.  
Finished, then wear the talisman. The talisman’s writing is truly essential as follows:

The talismans are all written in vermilion.

The Supreme Ultimate Jade Essence True Secret Upper Talisman begins on Jiazi day with two daily wears, one at dawn for men; on the Eight Festivals days also at noon wear again.

The Supreme Ultimate Jade Essence True Secret Upper Talisman begins on Yichou day with two daily wears, one at dawn for women; on the Eight Festivals days also at midnight wear again.

These two talismans are the ancestral talismans of the Spirit-Flying Six Jia. Those who desire to wear the talisman must first fast for six days, then wear it. After sixty days, one may wear the sixty jade maiden talismans. These two talismans summon spirits and open numinosity, communicate and penetrate myriad essences; long wearing does not fail, flying immortals long live. Having worn the sixty jade maiden talismans, one must then use these talismans as well, practicing both simultaneously. The talismans for men and women differ, employed according to their names. One must avoid uncleanness, the aftermath of death and mourning households; one must not share sleeping or resting positions with others; clothing must not be borrowed from others; abstain from five pungent foods and six kinds of meat. Also, avoid contact with women, especially strictly forbidden, lest one’s spirit be lost and soul vanish, generating evil and losing nature, bringing disaster to three generations, dying as a lowly ghost. One must constantly burn incense at the head of the sleeping place.

The above sixty-two talismans are those received by the Supreme Ultimate Upper Palace Four Perfected Ones from the Supreme Great Dao Lord. On receiving, one must fast and purify with sincerity, wash away the five burdens, expel the defilements of leakage and dust, suppress the loss from lust and desire, hold the gaze and retain the six essences, concentrate thought on the jade truth, scatter incense and smoke in the chamber, seclude the body in a solitary room, accumulate hairs and dust, harmonize the soul to preserve the center, imitate the five ways of divine life in the three palaces, dispel contention and rivalry among the common crowd, keep silence and stillness to respond and communicate; the Six Jia spirits will descend and appear within a year. If one can diligently cultivate this way, one will surely ascend to immortality. Those who believe and reverently observe are spiritual men; those who do not believe will die and enter the ghost division.

The Shangqing Six Jia Spirit-Reflecting Way, must be given only to the truly perfect person; then it quickly brings communication and descent, and spirit-flying is easily manifested. With long and diligent cultivation, sitting and standing between life and death, long gazing at myriad transformations, food hall finally arriving. The Nine Yi Perfected One Xu Wei-yuan formerly received this method at the Central Peak Song [De Xuan]. De Xuan was a man of the Zhou kings’ time; wearing this Spirit-Flying Six Jia talisman, he attained the Way, able in one day to travel three thousand li, frequently transforming into black beasts, attaining the true numinous way, originally at Mount Song. Wei-yuan followed it long, then received this method; having accomplished the way of practice, he now dwells at Mount Jiu-yi. There are women Guo Shao-yao, Zhao Ai-er, Wang Lu-lian, and others, all having received this method and attained the Way, numbering several dozen more; some roam the Mysterious Isles, some dwell at the Eastern Flower region’s various terraces, now seen dwelling at the Southern Peak. Madam Wei says: This Guo Shao-yao is the daughter of General Yang Ping Guo Qian of Han’s Liaodong; in youth she loved sincerity, and a Perfected One thereupon granted her the Six Jia. Zhao Ai-er is the niece of Liu Yu the governor of Youzhou, the aide Zhao Gai; loving the Way, after corpse-release she received this talisman again. Wang Lu-lian is the daughter of Fan Ling, the city gate captain of Wei Wen Emperor, also a student of the Way; one day suddenly she married Li Ziqi. Li Ziqi was a man of Weizhou, transmitter of the King of Qinghe; he often said this woman was madly wandering, one day suddenly losing her place.

The Shangqing Six Jia Spirit-Flying, wearing and serving this true talisman, roams and travels the eight directions; practicing this true scripture, one shall find the right person. According to the Four Extremities Bright Methods, those who transmit the Shangqing inner scriptures all take oaths of alliance and service, then proclaim it. In seven hundred years, only six persons have transmitted it; it is limited and shall no longer be divulged. Those receiving the talisman all fast seven days, prepare the altar with vermilion threshold, burning bundles of firewood, ten feet in height, six pairs of golden bracelets, six taels of blue silk, as a substitute for cutting hair at the altar; they swear by blood and break the covenant, pledging to serve and not divulge the spirit talisman. Should they violate the covenant and break faith, they willingly endure the test of the wind blade, fall into the River of Accumulated Night, are flogged on Meng Mountain stones, and fill Mengjin. Masters of the scripture, receiving this method and faith, must provide it to the poor and lowly, the solitary, sick, old and weak; it must not be used alone. If not following the regulations, the Three Officials investigate and punish, death as a low ghost; one should carefully respect and guard against this.
