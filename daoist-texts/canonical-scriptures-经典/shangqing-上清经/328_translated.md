# Supreme Clarity: The Great Sovereign's Eight Simple True Scripture

### Title of the Scripture: Supreme Clarity: The Great Sovereign's Eight Simple True Scripture.  
The author is unknown; it is roughly dated to the Eastern Jin and Southern Dynasties. It is counted among the important early classics of the Supreme Clarity sect. One scroll. The exemplar source: The "Orthodox Taoist Canon," section of Profound Mystery, category of Jade Secrets.

The "Great Sovereign's Hidden Book: Eight Simple True Scripture" is the Way of the Mysterious Clear Jade Emperor. The Supreme Sovereign Heavenly Emperor delivered this book to the Lord of the Supreme Subtle Heaven, the Lord of the Three Origins Purple Essence, and the Elder Lord of True Yang Origin. These lords received the book and, after practicing the Way to completion, entrusted it to the Great Sovereign Lord of the Way. The Great Sovereign Lord then transmitted it to the Golden Gate's Later Sage, Lord Li, who passed it to the Perfected Person of the Great Void, the Red Lord of the Southern Peak, and bade them to deliver it to students of the Way. It was inscribed with golden titles and jade characters, carved on lofty pavilions, reserved for the perfected. The Great Sovereign's hidden writings are not conveyed to earthly immortals, nor can the earthly immortals obtain them by themselves.

The Great Sovereign said: The Five Stars are the spiritual roots of the sun and moon, the five viscera of the heavenly embryo. Therefore, heavenly essence entwines, forming the Five Stars, by which heaven and earth rely to combine Qi. The sun and moon strike them and thus shine. If the heavenly Qi does not nurture, then the trinity's waxing and waning falters; if the earthly Qi does not nurture, all things wither and stagnate. When waxing and waning fail, heaven trembles and earth moves. If the constellations do not guard their stations, the sun and moon grow dim; if the Five Stars err in their courses, the two luminaries lose their light. When heaven is at peace, the Five Stars reflect clearly; when heavenly essence combines, the Five Stars shine brightly. The spiritual Way of the stars responds to Mount Tai above; the virtue and spirit of jade purity shine above the Great Void and illuminate myriad beings below. When omens have loss or gain, the five degrees go awry; when omens are harmonious and auspicious, their courses follow the Way. They reflect hidden blessings and calamities, minute distinctions fully revealed; profound illumination penetrates the finest details, quietly preserving merits and faults. The Five Emperors report to the True Sovereign within the stars; the True Sovereign reports to the Great Jade Lord. Hence the movements of the stars and their lights turn like candles to show all living beings, their sidereal courses transgressing places to foretell disaster and fortune. The earth establishes the five sacred mountains to symbolize the five elements and their stars; man stands with the spirits of the five viscera to correspond to the functions of the five elements. The three Qi revolve in harmony, thus heaven and earth are arrayed in completeness. The spirit of the stars ascends to all essences above, and communes with the light and ferries below; their inhalations and exhalations wash the myriad spirits with three splendours; they reach to the three and six directions; within they nurture life. Their affairs are profound and subtle, their instruments vast and wide. Immortals know only to fly the cinnabar, summon frost, refine the crimson water jade, dissolve metal in nine furnaces of the fiery heavens, and labor diligently in their nourishment. They are vigilant caretakers, yet those who have attained this only ascend their bodies to heaven and transcend the mysterious continent. Such are the immortals only; though they travel afar among the Nine Palaces, they have not yet entered the gate of the perfected. Now I have a Way which is the method of the Supreme Perfected, not merely the Middle Perfected. You desire to summon the Five Stars and ride together above the Three Simplicities, seated in the Eight Scenes to gaze and roam, ascending the western battlements of the Great Emperor, soaring through the Vast Emptiness, and ascending the sun at dawn. I formerly received it from the Jade Emperor, have practised it until now, for 460,000 years without cessation, enjoying the marvels of this Way, delighting in the meeting of the Five Stars. Having obtained the forms divided into myriad myriads, giving birth to clouds and nurturing moisture, ascending above to Jade Purity, looking below to the Great Ultimate—thus becoming the Great Sovereign perfected, attaining the essence of the Five Stars. The secret subtle art is hidden in the Cloud Pavilion, embracing the spirit's secret; those who journey with it are companions thereof. You should now confer title on all living beings as emperors of the Ten Heavens, the mysterious name Bi Shu, early carved in the Jade Pavilion, fitting to be given to initial perfected students, so they receive these secret chapters; you shall transmit and implement it, and you will surely attain men worthy thereof. This is the secret method of the Supreme Perfected and must not be transmitted to earthly immortals. At the beginning of transmission, one must have profound response and awakening, spirits informing the person, who must then purify himself, enter into a pledge sworn in the Three Heavens. Within seven hundred years there must be three transmissions, limited to concealment in the Five Mountains, never to be further disseminated. Should the hidden celestial scripture be leaked, the Heavenly Emperor is informed, and three ancestral masters are executed, and the three officials descend to sever the offender's life, who in life suffers water and fire, and in death becomes a lowly ghost. All who study the True Way and receive this book bear the Heavenly Emperor's eye-name West Flower Palace, with the records inscribed in the Purple Palace; only those who are perfected receive this writing. Before your birth five thousand years ago, your mysterious name was already fixed, and you were destined to encounter this scripture. Do not think, because you just now receive this book, that it is not a fate predestined. When the Jade Emperor observes those who obtain this book, he informs the Supreme Sovereign, who dispatches thirty-six Flying Jade Children to attend the book's location. He also orders the Great Ultimate to send thirty-two Jade Maidens to guard the true lords of the Five Stars and their consorts. Together, the Jade Children and Jade Maidens guard the bearers of the book. Those who have the book carry it in special cases, open it for inspection, bow twice before it, and burn incense on both sides. The Jade Children and Maidens oversee merits and faults, discern sincerity and good faith, and report immediately to the Supreme Sovereign. Great care is necessary.

To cultivate this Way, within five years the Jade Children and Maidens will appear in form and serve as your attendants. After fourteen years, the Way is accomplished; you attain to ride with the Five Stars and ascend to the Jade Purity Palace.

The Way of the Supreme Perfected has seven parts; the Way of the Great Sovereign has three; the Way of the Middle Perfected has six; the Way of the Lower Perfected has eight.

Those who practice the Way of the Supreme Perfected in summary become Supreme Clarity perfected persons and receive three thousand Jade Children and Jade Maidens, holding the rank of emperors of the various heavens. Their practice follows the tricolor festivals, accompanied by myriad spirits and myriad perfected, led in front by phoenix songs, followed by the mysterious Jun, the White Tiger opening the way, flying dragons winging the sedan.

The Way of the Great Sovereign has three parts, listed on the left:

Jade Purity Hidden Book, Divine Tiger Great Talisman, Golden Tiger True Talisman.

Those who practice the Way of the Great Sovereign in summary become Great Sovereign's Way practitioners, bestowed with two thousand Jade Children and Jade Maidens, holding the rank of the Supreme Perfected Jade Emperor's lordship. Their practice follows the five-colored divine festivals, accompanied by a thousand perfected and group of immortals, led in front by Heavenly Jun, followed by Luan songs, three perfected attendants of the sedan, soaring and flying through the nine heavens.

The Way of the Middle Perfected has six parts, listed on the left:

Those who practice the Way of the Middle Perfected in summary become Supreme Clarity Middle Way perfected, receiving one thousand Jade Children and Jade Maidens, holding the rank of Supreme Clarity left and right ministers and teachers. Their practice follows the purple fur festival, accompanied by myriad spirits and thousand perfected, led in front by the phoenix's cry, followed by Heavenly Jun's music, the mysterious dragon opening the way, the Five Emperors testing the chariot, flying through the great void, roaming and playing in the cinnabar heavens.

Those who practice the Way of the Lower Perfected in summary become Supreme Clarity Lower Origin perfected, receiving five hundred Jade Children and Maidens, holding the rank of Supreme Clarity left and right grandmasters. Their practice follows the five-colored festivals, accompanied by myriad spirits and Jade Maidens, led in front by the nine phoenixes' calls, followed by the eight luan's music, the white dragon opening the way, the Great Ultimate testing the chariot, flying through inverted scenes, roaming the Purple Chamber.

The Supreme Clarity Supreme Perfected, Middle Way perfected, and Lower Origin perfected, each have their respective scriptures for their practice, each comprising sections and chapters, so that they may follow in order. Those who cultivate the Way of one perfected must possess all the scriptures of that perfected, and practice them together, thereby becoming a Supreme Clarity perfected person.

If one obtains incomplete scriptures, or only the Supreme Canon, or only the middle chapters, or only the lower texts, although practicing diligently, but lacking the rest, one may only ascend as a flying immortal. To reach the Great Ultimate below and descend the Five Mountains, one cannot become one of the Three Supreme of Supreme Clarity. You should apply your heart diligently to heaven and earth, petition the divine mystery, travel afar to famous mountains, make offerings to myriad spirits, seek treasure texts, so that your moral virtue is complete. Having cultivated one section, ascending to Supreme Clarity, you will be granted over a thousand Jade Children and Maidens. If only one text is obtained and not all together, then the Jade Children and Maidens will be assigned correspondingly and guard accordingly.

Those who cultivate the "Great Sovereign's Yu Yi Run-Sun Writings," "Jie Lin Run-Moon Chapter," and "Eight Simple Run-Star Hidden Scripture" may ascend to Supreme Clarity as Lower Origin perfected persons, for they have not fully cultivated the Supreme Perfected. Surpassing those others, all should cultivate together; when the Way is complete, then ascend to Supreme Clarity.

Those who cultivate all three perfected Ways and their scriptures, having heard and seen the Jade Purity Hidden Book, wearing the Divine Tiger's Great Talisman, ascend as Jade Emperor's lord and Great Sovereign's true perfected, receiving 30,000 Jade Children and Maidens, roaming the high Supreme Pavilion, entering and exiting the Jade Purity Palace. At this time the Heavenly Emperor Supreme Subtle Lord comes to serve the Jade Emperor.

The "Jade Purity Hidden Book" has four scrolls, formerly received by the High Supreme Jade Emperor from the Great Jade Emperor Dao Lord of the Forbidden Book. The Jade Emperor treasures it greatly and entrusts it to the Four Perfected of the Great Ultimate to guard and conceal it. Within five thousand years, three transmissions are permitted to the perfected of Supreme Clarity. If within a thousand years three persons receive it, that is also permitted. After the limit, it must not be retransmitted. Among the common folk, among millions there is sometimes one person granted by the Heavenly True to receive this book. The Great Supreme Mysterious Platform already holds their jade name and they are to be Supreme Perfected. Those who have the book, residing at home, receive three hundred Jade Children and three hundred Jade Maidens, who day and night bring all true immortals and the spirits of famous mountains to their chambers, discussing the Way and expounding virtue. This is called those who have the book residing in the world before departing to learn the Way. When seeking the truth in mountains and studying the spirit writings, they command the six heavens, call upon the mountain spirits, and the five sacred mountains come to pay homage. Jade Children and Maidens appear in form, attending the perfected in burning incense.

The "Great Sovereign Divine Tiger Talisman" was given by the Great Sovereign Void Emperor Dao Lord to the Great Sovereign. The Great Sovereign Lord entrusted it to the Three Heavens True Sovereigns to deliver to all perfected and celestial officials. This talisman bears true names in Supreme Clarity; all who wear it have received it. But those who have this talisman without the "Jade Purity Hidden Book" cannot be true perfected of Supreme Clarity, only Great Ultimate's true perfected.

The "Supreme Subtle Heavenly Emperor Golden Tiger Talisman" was given by the Great Sovereign Jade True Protector Emperor Dao Lord to the Great Sovereign Supreme Subtle Heavenly Emperor Lord. There are thirty-six heavenly emperors; the Supreme Subtle Heavenly Emperor is the most exalted; all heavenly emperors come to receive service from him. Those who receive this talisman command myriad gods, control a thousand spirits, with dragons and tigers guarding, able to ride the clouds of the Three Simplicities, ascend the Great Ultimate Supreme Clarity, and are honored as Left Duke.

The "Jade Purity Hidden Book" is profound and remote; for the Lower Perfected and flying immortals, they should calm their hearts with boundless hope only. The "Divine Tiger Talisman" and "Golden Tiger Talisman" are sought diligently by flying immortals; some attain principles thereby. Those without mysterious names and spiritual talismans still seek and do not meet this text; they are at best equal, how much less the Way of Jade Purity.

The Great Sovereign said: Formerly it was said that the Supreme Clarity is unattainable, how much less the Great Ultimate? It was also said that Supreme Clarity is not to be heard, how much less Jade Purity? The bright True has gradations of high and low, the profound has ranks and degrees. Before surpassing this, there is no further discussion.

The perfected below the Jade Purity Palace are those above the Supreme Clarity Palace; the perfected above the Great Ultimate Palace are those below the Supreme Clarity Palace. The perfected above the Supreme Clarity Palace are those below the Great Ultimate Palace. From this downward, one obtains the flying immortals of the Nine Palaces.

When the "Jade Purity Hidden Book" is to be transmitted, the Four Perfected of the Great Ultimate each keep one scroll, presenting it upward to the Supreme Sovereign, High Supreme, Jade Emperor, and Jade Mysterious Lords, inquiring into the golden seals and jade names, for those to be Supreme Perfected Jade Lords; only then is it transmitted. Those who have it summon all true immortals to their chambers; if their practice is perfected, the Great Sovereign no longer tests their state. Those who have golden seals and jade names are certainly Supreme Perfected. The "Jade Purity Hidden Book" is more subtle than the "Yu Yi Writings."

Those who have the "Great Sovereign Yu Yi Run-Sun Writings," "Jie Lin Run-Moon Chapter," and "Eight Simple Run-Star Scripture" and practice their methods, the Great Ultimate perfected no longer tests them.

Those who have the "Great Cavern True Scripture" and practice its method, their seven ancestors and parents are freed from ghost names, pardoned from the three officials' punishments, recorded in the immortal registers, explained with difficulty, and make their way to the Vermilion Fire Cinnabar Tomb Palace to learn the immortal way. When the immortal Way is accomplished, they aid and assist the Five Emperors, becoming immortals of the Nine Palaces. Those who are complete with the "Great Cavern True Scripture" follow the law fixed by the Four Extremes, especially for their seven ancestors to attain immortality. It differs from other scriptures and must not be neglected. If, having practiced it, one is tested, but only partially cultivates one Way or stops midway, there is no time for self-rescue, nor can one secure the immortality of seven generations. Ghosts may learn immortality as men learn the Way; seven generations establish virtue, thus bringing blessings to descendants and enabling their attaining of gods and immortals. One who cultivates the Way alone and is complete in the "Great Cavern Scripture" extends fortune to the seven ancestors, and so should return this embryonic form to become an immortal official. The Central Yellow Lord treasures the mystery of this cavern scripture and regards it as blessing seven generations, keeping it especially secret, paired with the "Yu Yi Writings." The many perfected of Supreme Clarity also esteem this Way, for its merit adds to the seven ancestors and virtue ascends to the upper worlds.

The Later Sage Lord Li received the "Eight Simple True Scripture Run-Star Hidden Scripture," practiced its method, and thereby summoned down the Supreme Subtle Heavenly Emperor to welcome him, riding the Five Stars together, mounted on the splendid Three Simplicities, ascending to Jade Purity, and receiving the scripture as Supreme Clarity Golden Gate Emperor Lord.

The Way to ascend Flying Jupiter: The planet Jupiter is a round mirror of wood essence, brightly shining at the eastern horizon. Within Jupiter are nine gates, each gate emits nine sharp rays, whose rays extend downwards for nine million zhang. Each gate has a Blue Emperor, each guarding a gate under the central Blue Emperor True Lord. The central lord is the First Yang True Blue Emperor Dao Lord, named Chenglan, styled Qingning; his consort is named Baorong, styled Feiyun. They govern within Jupiter, guarding the nine gates, controlling the blue radiance flowing rays to illuminate the true below and above. Those who desire to ascend must think on seeing Jupiter, with a correct heart gaze upon the star, touch the heart with the right hand in respect, cover both eyes with the left hand, closing the nine breaths, then gnash the teeth twenty-seven times, swallow saliva nine times, close the eyes beneath the hands, call the true lord and consort's names thrice, then say: "I wish to ride together with the First Yang Blue Emperor True Lord and his consort, to mount the eight-scene jade chariot and ascend the Great Sovereign's palace." After speaking, close the eyes beneath the hands and pray softly:

Heaven and earth unite; essence flows eastward; I look up to the nine gates, flying clouds scatter rays; the First Yang Blue Terrace holds the Blue Emperor; blue teeth hang their light, illuminating the nine directions; Lady Yu Cha, styled Feiyun, dressed in spirit brocade, dragon cape and tiger skirt, waistband with phoenix talisman, headscarf and splendid crown, entering the void and not returning, roaming the Great Origin, leading the Blue Emperors in front, followed by a thousand spirits, coming to meet and escort me to be a flying perfected, ascending Jade Purity to the High Supreme Chamber.

When finished, withdraw the hand, open the eyes facing the star, receive twenty-seven swallows of the star's light, fix the vision on the nine rays of the star, guiding all into the throat. Then again gnash the teeth thrice.

Practicing regularly for fourteen years, the Blue Emperor Lord of Jupiter reports to the High Supreme Jade Purity Palace, carving the Supreme Subtle jade tablets, fixing the jade script, and attains the rank of Supreme Clarity Supreme Flying Perfected.

Jupiter has nine gates; within each gate is a Blue Emperor. Each emperor guards a gate under the central Blue Emperor True Lord. The Blue Emperor is the Supreme Perfected of the East, the honored spirit of the beginning essence, entering and exiting Jade Purity, friend to High Supreme. The Blue Emperors within the gates are variously titled Blue Spirit Lord, Blue God, Blue Essence, or Blue Emperor Lord, all serving under the central Blue Emperor Supreme True Lord. Those who practice the Eight Simple secret Way summon the Blue Emperor to descend. Those who have practiced the Five Spirits' external method summon the Blue Spirit to grant the book. Hence the Way has depths and heights, and the spiritual ranks have distinctions.

When there are no stars in heaven, or at cloudy evenings, one may practice facing east within the chamber and pray. The celestial Way is subtle and mysterious; the thread of mystery is finely parted; it is not necessary always to face the stars when practicing. When stars are present, one may go to the courtyard and sit or stand at ease. This is the Way of the Supreme Perfected to ascend the Eastern Star, not conveyed to earthly immortals.

The Way to ascend Mars: Mars is a round mirror of cinnabar essence, shining toward the southern pavilion. Mars has three gates, each gate emits three rays, whose rays extend three million wen. Each gate has a Red Emperor; there are three Red Emperors guarding the southern Supreme True Emperor Lord. The center of the star holds the Red Fire Cinnabar Sun Red Emperor Supreme Dao Lord, named Weiting, styled Sanrong; his consort named Huaping, styled Xuanluo. They govern within Mars, guarding the three gates, controlling the red light flying clouds, illuminating the perfected below. To ascend, think on seeing the Mars star, set heart right to gaze upon the star, touch heart with left hand in respect, cover mouth with right hand, close the three breaths, gnash teeth twenty-seven times, swallow saliva nine times, close both eyes, call thrice the true lord and consort's names, then say: "I wish to ride together with the Red Fire Red Emperor Lord and consort, to mount the eight-scene cinnabar chariot and ascend Jade Purity Palace." Then softly pray:

The mysterious image flows and shines, cinnabar light to the southern netherworld; looking up to the three gates, vermilion clouds and crimson city; within is the Red Emperor, named Weiting; the consort within shines, named Huaping; dressed in cloud frost, phoenix splendor and dragon bells, waistband with tiger script, headscarf flying blue, entering the origin and void, soaring over five cities, leading the Red Emperors in front, followed by six dings, coming to meet and summon me to attain the true name, ascending the Mysterious Void, Golden Book Jade Purity.

When finished, withdraw the hand without uncovering the mouth; open the eyes facing the star, swallow twenty-seven swallows of the star's light, receive all three rays into the throat. Then again gnash the teeth thrice.

Practicing regularly for fourteen years, the Red Emperor Lord of Mars reports to the Three Origins Mysterious Supreme Palace, carving the Mysterious Garden jade tablets, fixing the golden script, and attains the rank of Supreme Clarity Supreme Flying Perfected.

Mars has three gates; within each gate is a Red Emperor; each emperor guards a gate under the central Red Emperor Lord. The Red Emperor is the Supreme Perfected of the South, noble spirit of the cinnabar palace, entering and exiting Jade Purity, friend to the Three Origins Supreme Lords. The Red Emperor Lords in the star are variously titled Red Spirit Lord, Red God, Red Essence, or Red Emperor, all serving under the central Red Emperor Supreme True Lord. One who practices the Eight Simple hidden scripture summons the Red Emperor to descend. Those who have practiced the Five Spirits' external method summon the Red Emperor Lord to grant the book. Hence there are hidden and manifest texts, and spiritual ranks with distinguished order.

When there are no stars, or on cloudy evenings, one may practice facing south in the chamber. Stars present, one may go to the courtyard, sit or stand at will. This is the method of rushing to the Southern Star, not transmitted to earthly immortals; transmission incurs penalty for leakage.

Earthly immortals have their own Eight Simple scriptures, discussing attire, royal Qi, and the Way of breathing out and inhaling. There is also a Nine Simple scripture discussing summoning ghosts, using essences to conduct kitchen inspections of souls and spirits, proper terrestrial practice on famous mountains for longevity and immortality only. After the Eight Simple scripture is the Heavenly Jun Upper Qu Yang Song in nine chapters; after the Nine Simple scripture is the Phoenix Blowing Dragon Roaring Yin Song in eight chapters; these are the secret books of the earthly immortals. What is now called the Great Sovereign Run-Star Eight Simple is the practice of Supreme Clarity's Way and not the Eight Simple of earthly immortals. The earthly immortal's blowing songs await the Supreme Clarity's journey.

The Way to ascend Venus: Venus is a round mirror of metal essence, dazzling at the western star. Venus has seven gates, each gate emits seven rays, rays extend seven million zhang. Each gate has a White Emperor, seven in total, guarding their gates under the Western Supreme True Emperor Dao Lord. The star's center holds the Great Simple Lesser Yang White Emperor Supreme True Dao Lord, named Liaoling, styled Zhenxun; his consort is named Biao Ying, styled Ling'en. They govern within Venus, guarding the seven gates, controlling the white light flying essence, illuminating the highest perfected. To ascend, think on seeing Venus star, set heart rightly to gaze upon the star, touch heart with right hand in respect, cover both nostrils with left hand, close the seven breaths, gnash teeth twenty-seven times, swallow saliva nine times, close both eyes, call thrice the true lord and consort's names, then say: "I wish to ride with the Great Simple Lesser Yang Lord and consort, to mount the eight-scene simple chariot and ascend Jade Purity Palace." Then softly pray:

Seven essences fly brilliantly, light shines westward; looking up to the seven gates, spirit palace urges rays; simple brightness candles and reflects, virtue marks the metal clan. Within is Lesser Yang, called White Emperor; consort Ling'en governs the jade chamber, dressed in bright brocade, flowing bells and tiger insignia, headscarf aiding the dawn, waistband with golden bells, entering void and emptiness, wandering on jade firmament, leading the White Emperors in front, followed by six geng, coming down to meet and escort me north to ascend the battlement palace, named and recorded in Supreme Clarity, becoming true lord.

When finished, withdraw the hand without uncovering nostrils; open both eyes facing the star, swallow twenty-seven swallows of the star's brilliance, receive the seven rays fully into the throat. Then again gnash the teeth thrice.

Practicing regularly for fourteen years, the Lesser Yang White Emperor Supreme Lord of Venus reports to the Great Emperor Jade Purity Palace, carving the Supreme Clarity Golden Pavilion, fixing the jade tablets, and attains the rank of Supreme Clarity Left True Duke, overseeing the Great Ultimate.

Venus has seven gates; within each gate is a White Emperor; each emperor guards a gate under the central White Emperor Dao Lord. The White Emperor is the Supreme Perfected of the West, honored sovereign of the Great Essence, entering and exiting Mysterious Clarity, friend to the Primordial Emperor Dao Lord. The White Emperors in the gates are variously titled White Spirit Lord, White God, White Essence, or White Emperor Lord, all serving the central White Emperor Supreme True Lord. Those who practice the Eight Simple secret mystery summon the White Emperor to descend. Those who have practiced the Five Spirits' external Way summon the White Spirit to grant the book. Thus, there are hierarchies deep and profound in the Way.

When there are no stars or on cloudy evenings, one may practice facing west within the chamber. When stars are present, one may go to the courtyard and sit or stand at ease. Even quiet Way practitioners may practice within their chambers to commune with the true faces of the Five Stars and cultivate them together. All are Ways of the Supreme Perfected, the method to rush to the Western Star, not transmitted to earthly immortals.

One night's taking of the Five Stars' light should be widespread and regular; in spring take star light beginning from the east; in summer begin from the south; following the king moon, lead with the king star; these are the secret formulas. The movement of the stars is not bound to the directions; rather, one follows wherever the star is located, and cultivates accordingly.

When acting, one should not let others see what is done, but act hidden and secluded. This is the Great Sovereign's hidden Way, called the hidden book. Hidden and more hidden, lest ghosts and spirits secretly see its titles; how can it be allowed for the foul worldly to lightly transmit and hear these signatures? One must not allow blind or foolish men, claiming ignorance, to see the titles; the body contains seven spirits, and to see is also leakage; great care must be taken. Those who cultivate the Way of the hidden book and reveal the titles shall be examined by the three officials and bring disaster. Whenever inspecting, one must first exclude others, including animals, burn incense, bow twice, and then examine.

The Way to ascend Mercury: Mercury is a round mirror of water essence, shining through the Northern Ocean. Mercury has five gates, each gate emits five rays, rays extending five million zhang. Each gate has a Black Emperor; five black emperors in total, guarding their gates under the Northern Supreme True Emperor. The star center holds the Great Mysterious Yin Origin Black Emperor Dao Lord, named Qixuan, styled Jingchun; his consort is named Xuanhua, styled Long'e. They govern within Mercury, guarding the five gates, controlling mysterious light streaming forth to illuminate the Northern Origin Court, to be perfected. To ascend, think on seeing Mercury, set heart right to gaze upon the star, touch heart with both hands; after touching heart, raise both hands to cover the ears; then close five breaths, gnash teeth twenty-seven times, swallow saliva nine times, close both eyes, call thrice the true lord and consort's names, then say: "I wish to ride with the lord and consort, to mount the eight-scene blue chariot and ascend Supreme Clarity Supreme Origin Palace." Then softly pray:

Five essences fly mysteriously, light flows northward; looking up to the five gates, blue palace dense and flourishing, sharp rays reach afar, spirit reflects the cloud of light. Within is the Black Emperor, named Jingyuan; consort Long'e is resplendent, both managing the mysterious gates, dressed in blue robes, purple brocade and scarlet skirts, waistband with tiger talisman, headscarf with lotus crown, emerging over nine voids, entering the sound jade ferry, leading Black Emperors in front, followed by six ren, coming down to meet and escort, ascending the Purple Chamber, named and recorded in the Great Sovereign, becoming Jade True.

When finished, withdraw hand without uncovering ears; open eyes facing the star, swallow twenty-seven swallows of star's light, receive the five rays fully into the throat. Then again gnash teeth thrice.

Practicing regularly for fourteen years, the Great Mysterious Supreme Emperor Lord of Mercury reports to the High Supreme Palace, carving the Jade Room jade tablets, fixing the Jade Purity purple script, and attains the rank of Supreme Clarity True Lord.

Mercury has five gates; within each gate is a Black Emperor; each emperor guards a gate under the central Mysterious Emperor Lord. The Mysterious Emperor is the Supreme Perfected of the North, honored lord of the Great Mysterious, entering and exiting the Upper Void, friend to the Purple Essence Dao Lord. The Black Emperors guarding the gates are variously titled Black Spirit Lord, Black God, Black Essence, or Black Emperor Lord, all serving under the central Great Mysterious Black True Supreme Emperor Lord. One who practices the Eight Simple hidden Way summons the Northern Emperor to descend; those who practice the Five Spirits' external method summon the Black Emperor Lord to grant the book. The respect and rank differ; hence the Way has hidden and manifest aspects.

When the sky is cloudy or at night without stars, one may practice within the chamber or sleeping place. This is the High Supreme secret Way, the method to rush to the Northern Star, not known among earthly immortals.

The Nine Palaces of Jade Purity, Supreme Clarity, Great Ultimate, and Supreme Clarity each have their officials, ministers, grandmasters, marquises and dukes, established offices similarly, mutually supervising, serving above. The palaces are in order and resemble each other, yet their Way has rank and dignity, and their virtue and deed ascend or descend.

The Way to ascend Saturn: Saturn is a round mirror of earth essence, guarding the yellow path. Saturn has four gates, each gate emits four rays, rays extend four million zhang. Each gate has a Yellow Emperor; there are four Yellow Emperors guarding their gates under the Central Yellow True Lord. The star center holds the Central Yellow True Emperor Dao Lord, named Cangmu, styled Danyan; his consort is named Kongyao, styled Feixian. They govern within Saturn, guarding the four gates, controlling yellow robes flowing Qi, illuminating the Central Origin, watching and observing students of the True. To ascend, think on seeing Saturn, set heart right to gaze upon the star, touch heart with both hands; after touching heart, raise left hand to cover the upper cavity, then close four breaths, gnash teeth twenty-seven times, swallow saliva nine times, close both eyes, call thrice the True Lord and consort's names, then say: "I wish to ride with the Central Great Emperor Dao Lord and consort, to mount the eight-scene golden chariot and ascend Supreme Clarity Palace." Then softly pray:

Four essences linger and gather in Central Origin; looking up to the nine extremes, viewing the four gates; yellow terrace, purple chamber, riding rays and scattering beams; spirit light flourishes; heaven's splendor falls like a vase. Within is the Yellow Emperor, named Danyan; the consort is hidden virtue, called Feixian; managing and harmonizing fate Qi, guiding the mysterious watering and origin; dressed in yellow clouds, dragon brocade and tiger skirts, waistband with golden talisman, headscarf with purple crown, emerging over the mysterious void, spreading light through golden gates, leading the Yellow Emperors, six ji guarding the chariot, coming down to meet and escort, ascending the heavenly gate, golden book of the Great Sovereign, inscribed and carved with name, flying through the great void, attaining Jade Minister.

When finished, withdraw hand without uncovering the cavity; open both eyes facing the star, swallow twenty-seven swallows of star light, receive the four rays fully into the throat. Then again gnash teeth thrice.

Practicing regularly for fourteen years, the Yellow Supreme Emperor Lord of Saturn reports to the Great Supreme Palace, carving the Sky Terrace blue tablets, fixing the Nine Mysterious Cinnabar Writings, and attains the rank of Supreme Clarity True Lord, befriending the Four Extremes Supreme Perfected.

Saturn has four gates; within each gate is a Yellow Emperor; each emperor guards a gate under the central Yellow True Emperor Lord. The Central Yellow True Supreme Emperor is the highest honored of the Central Pole, entering and exiting Supreme Subtle, friend to the Primordial Emperor Dao Lord. The Yellow Emperors guarding gates are variously titled Yellow Spirit Lord, Yellow God, Yellow Essence, or Yellow Emperor Lord, all serving under the Central Yellow Supreme True Lord. Those who practice the Eight Simple secret Way summon the Yellow True Dao Lord to descend. Those who practice the Five Spirits' external method summon the Yellow Emperor to grant the book.

When cloudy or starless, all practice within the chamber, maintaining the five directions. The perfected say: within the chamber to store the stars is not unlike seeing the stars. Do not say since the stars are unseen, one should cease. This is the Great Sovereign's hidden Way, the secret method to ascend the stars.

When swallowing the star's radiance, one should hold in mind the true Supreme Emperor and consort of the star, receiving their light, swallowing it into the mouth and throat, and imagining their forms. This is Lord Li's secret formula.

Constantly practicing the Great Sovereign's hidden method, summoning and holding the Five Stars' Supreme Emperors, within five years one will see their shapes; at seven years one sees them all and journeys with them; at fourteen years the Five Emperors unite and descend, riding the mysterious splendor chariot, purple clouds of the Three Simplicities, led by the Five Emperors, followed by myriad perfected, the Five Emperors carrying you together, rising by day to the stars, presenting before Jade Purity, receiving the book as Supreme Clarity Supreme Perfected.

The Great Sovereign Hidden Book's Five Emperors Supreme True Five Open Days are secret to the Great Sovereign and not told to the immortals or perfected of the Nine Palaces. Only those with the Great Mysterious Jade Book, carved with golden inscriptions, know the days when they meet. The Five Open Days are when heavenly essence opens and clears, the Supreme Perfected have auspicious gatherings, and myriad spirits and immortals celebrate together.  

These are:  
- 6th day of the 1st month at midday,  
- 1st day of the 2nd month at feeding time,  
- 7th day of the 3rd month at midnight,  
- 9th day of the 4th month at eclipse time,  
- 15th day of the 5th month at midnight,  
- 3rd day of the 6th month at midday,  
- 7th day of the 7th month at midnight,  
- 4th day of the 8th month at midday,  
- 20th day of the 9th month at dawn,  
- 1st day of the 10th month at dawn,  
- 6th day of the 11th month at midnight,  
- 12th day of the 12th month at midnight.

On these twelve months’ days, the Five Stars' Supreme True Dao Lords ascend Supreme Clarity and Jade Purity to meet the Nine Mysterious Great Sovereign Dao Lords. Also, a thousand perfect ones and thirty-six heavenly emperors descend to the Supreme Clarity flying immortals, celebrating the Great Ultimate Supreme Palace. Also recorded are the diligence and slackness of those seeking the truth in the world, recording the chief names of those studying the truth, inscribing golden pavilions, fixing the book's tablet texts, recording the merits and faults of the Seven Ancestors, the degrees of punishment and pardon, and counting the grades of perfected beings. If the Seven Generations are without fault and the body diligent, all will be recorded on tablets, carved in jade script, and ranked as Supreme Clarity Left True Duke. If the Seven Generations have many faults, though the body is diligent, they are of the Lower Perfected. If the ancestors accumulated sins and oneself many sins, though diligent, one becomes a lower immortal. The prior sins are not consumed by merit, the deep faults not removed by diligence. The Five Open Days are auspicious meetings to consume sins and remove faults; knowing these days, there is hope. The Five Perfected assemble and attend; this is the Five Open Days, communicating widely, illuminating the minutest details. You wish by these days to petition the Seven Ancestors' sins and your own past faults; I shall report to the Three Officials, petition to remove punishments, report to the Heavenly Emperor to delete the sin records, pardon their servitude, scatter their ill-fated books, so your Seven Ancestors may roam freely and joyfully. Now, you open your forehead and bring blessings to the Seven Officials; this is the essential Way. If you rashly reveal the Five Open Days as Five Open Days, you increase your sins fourfold; even with ten thousand pardons, it profits not. The perfected keep silence and write by themselves; holding the writing in empty space, fearing insects and vermin to glance upon the text and break the prohibition of leaking secrets; great care is essential.

Lord Li said: On the day, enter a quiet private chamber, burn incense, face north, bow five times, call thrice the names of the Five Stars' Supreme True Lords and their consorts, then gnash teeth five times; then kneel with the headband removed, carefully petition the Five Stars, Sun and Moon Supreme High True Lords, Dao Lords and consorts, Jade Purity, Supreme Clarity, Great Supreme, High Emperor Supreme Lords, explaining your Seven Ancestors and parents below, down to your own thousand sins and myriad faults since former lives, begging for release. The Three Officials report to the Heavenly Emperor to dismiss the sins and remove the black tablets. You petition to ride with the Five Stars' truths to the splendid morning, ascending Supreme Clarity, passing through Jade Gates. Remember the roots of your faults, fully listing the number of sins, freely confessing with utmost sincerity.

On this day, pardons are granted; the Supreme Sovereign is informed; it is the auspicious meeting and celebration of the heavenly immortals on the Supreme Emperor Day. The myriad perfected and emperors present dragon robes, phoenix capes, tiger belts, and flying garments to the Supreme Emperor, treasuring this day, releasing punishments and names. Those ignorant of these Five Open Days cannot follow the pardoning example. Those who seek the truth should always practice this, but keep the day secret, lest any know it. The Later Sage Lord Li said: On this day, think only on auspicious deeds, pray to ascend as immortal, have no hundred worries, lest spirit and soul grieve and become miserable; establish virtue and charity, relieve the poor and destitute, perform merit and spread kindness; do not carry out threats and punishments; this is the Great Sovereign's auspicious day. The Great Sovereign on this day dispatches Jade Children and Maidens to secretly observe those studying the Way, and discern sincerity. Before you speak your intent, the intent of good or evil is already known and reported to the Supreme Sovereign. On this day, purify yourself and do good, and the essentials are clear.

The Later Sage Lord Li, having fully received the mysterious teaching and accomplished the Way, rides in the eight-scene chariot and ascends the Supreme Clarity Palace, receiving the scripture as Golden Gate Emperor Lord. On the day of departure, he handwrites the names and titles of the Five Stars' central Supreme True Lords and their consorts, and the Great Sovereign's Five Open Auspicious Days, on white jade tablets, one scroll written in cinnabar jade, sealed in a cloud-rush box and stamped with the three light seals, and places it in the White Stone Chest of Mount Hua of the Western Peak. It is inscribed on the chest: "Treasure of heaven and earth, rare and precious, the supreme store of famous mountains."

Another scroll is written on green jade, inscribed in yellow jade, sealed in phoenix jade box, stamped with the Morning True seal, and placed in the Green Stone Chest of Mount Tai of the Eastern Peak, inscribed on the chest: "Secret chapter of the Ten Heavens, the dark cave of the Supreme Spirit."

Another scroll is written on dark jade, inscribed in blue jade, sealed in the jade firm box, stamped with the Great Mysterious seal, and placed in the Yellow Stone Chest of Mount Heng of the Southern Peak, inscribed on the chest: "High treasure of the Eight Mysteries, the spiritual enclosure of the Supreme Perfected."

Another scroll is written on gold, inscribed in green jade, sealed in vermilion jade box, stamped with the High Emperor seal, and placed in the White Stone Chest of Mount Heng of the Northern Peak, inscribed on the chest: "Supreme Way of the Seven Spirits, the special palace of the Supreme True."

Another scroll is written on blue jade, inscribed in gold, sealed in the Wen Lang box, stamped with the Central Yellow seal, and placed in the Mysterious Stone Chest of Mount Song of the Central Peak, inscribed on the chest: "Special treasure of the Nine Heavens, the abyssal mansion of the Five Peaks."

Another scroll is written for each of the Five Peaks, to be held and guarded by the lords of the Five Peaks. When the auspicious meeting of the Renchen day comes, the sage lords descend, summoned to open these chests and hand over the books to the four prime ministers, to teach the talents of the Supreme Perfected.

Another scroll is written on white plain silk patterned with eight colors, written by hand. It contains the secret prayers and incantations to summon the true Way, breathing in and out, advancing and retreating, seeking ascent to the Five Stars. The book of the Five Open Days bears the title: "Eight Simple True Scripture, Great Sovereign's Hidden Book." It is delivered to the Perfected of the Great Void, the Red Lord of the Southern Peak, who pass it down to students of the Way; it bears true golden jade titles, inscribed in the Golden Pavilion. It must not be transmitted beyond the earthly immortals.

Those who obtain the Great Sovereign Eight Simple Hidden Book are all recorded in the Purple Palace with mysterious records, their jade names carved in Supreme Clarity; they are destined to become perfected and thus receive it. Among the mundane millions, there is sometimes one mistakenly granted by the Heavenly Spirit to receive this scripture, or obtains it but does not practice; all by fate sent as messengers of the Supreme Perfected. Do not doubt; though received but not practiced, they become corpse-resolved immortals, but cannot become flying perfected. After corpse resolution, they gradually are allowed to travel the high and subtle path, awakening from the web of delusion. But it takes years—this is a short time, yet truly transcending the traces. You should strive and conceal yourself.

The Perfected of the Great Void received instruction and reported: This is the Great Sovereign's spiritual writing, the marvelous Way of ascending the morning. For seven hundred years, three transmissions are allowed. The chief official Wang Jun said: Within one hundred years, two persons may be granted the scripture; those with true spiritual response also may be granted; only three transmissions within seven hundred years are allowed. All purify for seven days before receiving the scripture, and the recipient likewise. They must also make oaths and pledges to open their hearts. Those who cultivate the Five Stars to attain the Supreme Perfected Way receive a scripture master, forty feet of white silk, and two pairs of silver rings. Those who cultivate the Five Open Days receive a scripture master, thirty-two feet of blue cloth, as a lifelong covenant with cut blood, binding with no leakage. Then the Three Officials report directly to the Heavenly Emperor; the Heavenly Emperor requests Jade Maidens to attend the recipient; Supreme Clarity requests Jade Children to attend the Eight Simple spiritual texts; thirty-two each, overseeing the faults and merits of the book holders, recording every detail and reporting to the Supreme Palace. Those unworthy but granted, those exceeding limits, those revealing the hidden book, proclaiming auspicious days without oaths, not believing secret words, all violate the "Four Extremes Bright Statutes" on secrecy and closure, and their three ancestors and parents are examined by the Three Officials, their bodies becoming lower ghosts, punished on Meng Mountain stones, assisting the Five Mountains, drawing water from the dark sea, pouring into the four rivers, having no hope of immortality, and suffering the seven tribunals of hell. You, at the time of transmission and practice, must be most diligent and cautious, treating each as precious and secret. The Great Sovereign warned Lord Li anxiously, fearing loss of the Way. Also, this scripture contains the names and titles of the Five Emperors Supreme True Lords and consorts, and the Five Open Days, which should not be known by the unborn, adding to the burden of secrecy.

The Later Sage Lord Li said: You dwell in the world at home, not yet cultivating the supreme Way, fearing the hundred evils, thousand demons, and hundreds of spirits violating your spirit Qi, but at midnight, facing the five directions first close breath five times, each Yin side chanting the inscription on the Five Mountains stone chests thrice; from the White Jade of the Western Peak, the other four peaks each with one scroll, never reaching the white plain silk chapter; chant thrice. After chanting thrice, gnash teeth thirty-six times, dispelling a hundred evils, restraining the three souls, controlling the seven spirits. These prayers are not the external teachings and scriptures; these words have no chapters or sentences. The hundred evils, three souls, and seven spirits are not afraid of these. The Way's secret mystery is most profound and transcendent. Even the titles outside can restrain a hundred evils, search the souls and spirits; how much more what is treasured within the stone chest? The hundred ghosts, myriad essences, thousand evils and many demons all roam famous mountains, serving the spirits, all seeing the inscription on Lord Li's Five Mountains stone chests, though they do not know what Way scriptures are inside. Taoists should constantly chant these inscriptions; the ghosts and spirits think men should cultivate the scriptures within the chests, thus they are fearful and dare not approach.

### Secret Formula of the Perfected of the Great Void

The Perfected of the Great Void said: The former master taught: on the Five Open Days, when the sun rises some three or four zhang, stand upright, with heart facing the sun, store the three souls and spirit together with the sun's light into the heart. After a while, hold breath for three breaths, swallow saliva thrice, and pray softly:

"The sun scatters its radiance, hanging violet-blue light; come into my soul, shine on my five forms; dispel ghostly trials of the heart; make the heart calm and right; penetrate the nine Qi inside; connect outside with embryonic life; flying immortal ascending Supreme Clarity; the jade tally is fixed."

When finished, wipe the eyes twenty-seven times with hand, gnash teeth twenty-seven times, all done. This method makes one's three souls bright and clear, the cinnabar heart upright; all evil hiding arts and heart trials do not work; this is the true essential Way; you should always practice it. On the Five Open Days, facing the sun to sneeze; if you cannot sneeze, use a soft object facing the sun to guide the nose; this is also sneezing; upon sneezing say:

"Heaven's light comes in; six embryos open; three souls guard the spirit; seven spirits do not perish; receiving the sun's sneeze, sharing the sun's light; flying immortal ascending Supreme Clarity; attaining the rank of true lord."

When finished, wipe eyes twenty-seven times. This causes the internal essence to unite with sun's light, the three souls to become bright within, opening the heart and spirit, stirring the myriad essences flowing within. On days other than the Five Open Days, this is unnecessary.

Also, on the spring Yimao day, summer Bingwu day, autumn Gengshen day, and winter Renzi day, at midnight, first grind cinnabar, realgar, and orpiment finely, wrapped in cotton to the size of a date. When lying down, plug both ears with this; this dispels the three corpses and refines the seven spirits; it is a secret method not to be known by others. The next day at midday, bathe with flowing eastern water; after, prepare bed and bedding anew, change clothes, wash away old garments, change shoes and bathe again; scatter water beneath the bed and keep the chamber clean. Place pillow properly, lie facing upwards, hold breath firmly for a while, then pray softly:

"Heaven's Way has constancy; changes renew the old to new; the Emperor's auspicious day; bathing purifies the truth; three Qi dispel corpses; cinnabar and realgar calm spirits; precious refines the seven spirits; intimate with me."

When finished, this Way dispels and refines the corpse's filth, renews and changes the form; the essential secret. Only one day per season is taken for this. Those receiving the scripture and elders always have the Jade Children and Maidens carefully observe the recipient and place, examining the root of the secret instructions, with all or partial knowledge. You should understand this purpose. Those receiving (Bei Wei) must not scatter it selfishly to feed hunger or cold. Those who violate this perish in the Three Officials, becoming low and turbid ghosts; the Three Officials will add punishment to the Three Ancestors. This is the Great Sovereign's oath and blood covenant. When the body enters the famous mountains, on the day of immortal attainment, it should be cast into rivers, forests, caves, or given to poor mountain dwellers. If one dies in the Taiyin, and when departing without spiritual response, what is given should accompany oneself. The same for scripture recipients; then in mystery there must be dreamlike signs and evidence, with the Supreme Jade Children illuminating the form and confirming truth, handling matters appropriately.
