The Purple Clarity Flying Spirit Eight Transformations Jade Talisman

The eight transformations of the mysterious truth of the earth: First, to conceal form and hide shadow; second, to ride the void and control the empty; third, to vanish and fly to the firmament; fourth, to go out from existence and enter into non-being; fifth, to fly the spirit to the eight directions; sixth, to dissolve form and escape transformations; seventh, to return the morning and revolve the mystery; eighth, to hide in the earth and dance in heaven. These are the wondrous arts secreted in the jade chamber of the Golden Terrace of Supreme Clarity. They are stored in the jade register, sealed with golden stamps, attended by jade youths, guarded by jade maidens, each numbering eight hundred. The Most High Jade Morning Exalted Sage Lord received them at the Nine Mysteries; after seven thousand years, he transmitted them to the True Man of the Great Ultimate, the Grand Deity of the Eastern Florescence, the various Azure Youths, the Divine Kings of Fusang Yang Valley, and the True Man of Pure Emptiness, who made covenant with Supreme Clarity, splitting gold as oath. Whoever bears these inscriptions on their body is concealed and submerged in all eight directions; those who cultivate these arts ride the void and harness the illumination. They are handed down by mouth only, and must not be transmitted rashly; sons do not show to fathers, ministers do not serve lords thus; only in golden slips and jade volumes are the names recorded. To lightly disclose the secret writings brings disaster upon the Seven Mysteries; the body becomes a lowly ghost, blocking up the river source; according to the divine truth it is secret and reverently preserved.

On the day of the Beginning of Spring, at dawn enter the chamber, sit facing the northeastern corner, and meditate on the purple clouds thickly surging, descending from the northeastern corner of the Gen Palace, covering the whole chamber, dark and obscure inside and outside; after a long while it transforms into a nine-coloured beast, shaped like a phosphorescent form before my eyes. Then, knocking the teeth thirty-six times, softly chant:

"Return to the origin, transform the shadow, reflect the light on the secluded orchid, cover my purple wall, hide my golden city, unite with the vital energy staff, reveal not my form."

When finished, immediately stop at the ninth swallow, open the eyes, the cloud vapour clears away, and then wear the Flying Spirit Jade Talisman. After cultivating for one year, the form is constantly concealed in the void; on days of danger stand upon the Gen Palace, take the natal earth of the year, pinch it as a self-protection. According to the prayer of the Beginning of Spring day, think that the vital energy covers oneself, and no man sees it.
