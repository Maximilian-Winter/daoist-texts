# The Supreme Nine-True Bright Method

### Title of the Scripture: The Supreme Nine-True Bright Method. The compiler is unknown; it is roughly from the Eastern Jin and Southern Dynasties. It is compiled by selection from the Great Abundance Wondrous Scripture. The original source is: The Orthodox Daoist Canon, Zhengyi Section.

The Supreme One addressed the Heavenly Emperors, Later Sagely Sovereigns, Prime Minister Qing Tong, and the Supreme Ultimate Perfected Person, saying: All those later learners who behold the Three Caves Precious Chapters of the Supreme True, the secret scripture first day, all bear the name of Eastern Flower, inscribed with golden characters of Upper Clarity; though they have not yet transcended and soared, nor held reins in the Purple Court, yet they are all persons ascending and crossing over. Yet, though they see these writings, they do not understand the regulations and rituals of the Nine-True Bright Method, the wondrous script of the Three Caves, the Supreme Precious Scripture: it cannot be casually unfolded. The Bright Method and its precious secrets are stored in the Palace of the Mysterious Capital, within the Jade Capital Golden Chamber, not transmitted to the world. It reveals the profound depths of the Three Caves, marks the rites and forms of the many True Ones, extracts the stars to confront the dark officials, crosses the seven mysteries in the celestial register, truly summing up all the myriad paths, unbinding the heavy charges of the nine yin. Its wondrousness can be put to immediate use; its method can be made solemn and strict. Now therefore, the titles of the Three Grades are set forth to assist in promoting the Three Marvels of the Simple Spirit and Wondrous Scripture; to warn later learners, that those who diligently esteem it may take heed in the secret contracts of the dark.

The Heavenly Emperors, Later Sagely Nine Mysterious Emperors, Prime Minister Qing Tong, and Supreme Ultimate Perfected Person respectfully bowed and dared to ask the Supreme Heavenly Venerable: The most true highest law, lofty and pure, surpassing all the myriad sects, mysterious, silent, and condensed; wonderfully transcending and stirring mystery; the law transforms the three vehicles, threading through myriad eons; how can its measure be surpassed? Can it yet be traced in the Bright Method?

The Supreme One said: Good son, your words are well said. The disciples of later generations, if they are not descendants of the Jade Void, but are formed naturally and born, all are mingled in the primal chaos, tempered and flowing in the noise and filth. Their deeds are impure, their nature lacks single beauty; though they earnestly aspire to the mysterious depths, their hearts constantly oppose the conduct they ride upon; none do not trespass faults. Faults arise without and extinguish life within. To undertake study under such conditions, is it not to stray far from the true? If the Three Officials report fault, confronting the dark bureaus, calamity extends to the seven ancestors, guilt accumulates on the person; if one who errs is made to awaken to the mysteries of the Bright Method, where correction and punishment exist, the great holy transformation permitting the method of atonement, applying the regulations, then the approach to truth surely draws near. Scholars who lack this examination labour in vain with their diligent thought, profitless in their earnest striving. Therefore now the Nine True Three Grades Bright Method is set forth; it can be granted to later learners who are destined to be Perfected Ones.

The Emperors, Prime Minister Qing Tong, and Supreme Ultimate Perfected Person then retired to the Upper Clarity, reverently received the Simple Spirit Great Abundance Wondrous Scripture Nine True Method examination, secreted in the Golden Vault and Jade Chest, guarded by Jade Boy and Jade Maiden, each three thousand in number, officiating the spirit script, scattering incense in the void court; flying dragons and poisonous beasts, great dragons a thousand zhang high, clawing the cloud walls, completing the Jade Pass. Thus the ten great heavenly saints, the nine palaces true immortals, thrice each month ascend the mysterious palace, receive the Bright Method, and worship the scripture. Prime Minister Qing Tong said: Whoever has golden bones and jade marrow, named as participants of the Azure Palace, receiving this writing secret and implementing it. Thus to receive the ritual, mysteriously conforming to the highest canon, applying regulations and measures, works together with the True, redeems guilt and extracts difficulties, dissolves old knots, the seven mysteries' ancestors rejoice, their own bodies ascend and feast in the Jade Capital.

### The Mysterious Capital Nine True Bright Method Upper Grade Scripture Transmission Chapters

The first chapter of the Mysterious Capital Upper Grade says: The Great Cave True Scripture, the Female-One Precious Scripture, and the Supreme Simple Spirit Great Abundance Wondrous Scripture; these three Marvel Chapters, the High Supreme Jade Emperor's precious chapters, secret in the Palace of Great Abundance above the Nine Heavens, within the Jade Chamber of the Supreme Mysterious Spirit Platform. In the beginning of the Supreme Emperor’s ancient method, the scripture was transmitted once every myriad kalpas, the Three Ways rightly established, learning the True pattern and canon, the High Supreme proper method; within seven thousand years three transmissions may be heard. Guarded by seven thousand Jade Boys and Jade Maidens, holding incense and officiating spirits. The method of transmission requires facing and fasting for one hundred days, pledging by golden buttons as covenant, combining Jade Boys and Jade Maidens, according to the Four Extremes Method. If transmission is not according to method, guilt extends to seven ancestors, ghosts compelled to servitude, swallowed by fire and eating coal, bearing mountain and moving stones, filling the source of the boundless, suffering the penalty of the wind blade, body lost and form wasted, locked long in hell, never to become immortal.

The second chapter of the Mysterious Capital Upper Grade says: To transmit the Great Cave True Scripture's thirty-nine chapters to later learners, the oath is ten taels of gold, twenty-five jin of copper, five pairs of golden buttons, one golden fish and one jade dragon, one tael of blue silk, the buttons bound as pact. The Female-One requires five taels of gold, fifty chi each of five-coloured patterned silk, one jin of incense, and three pairs of golden buttons. The Supreme Simple Spirit Cave True Mysterious Scripture requires three taels of gold, one hundred chi of purple pattern silk, twenty-seven chi of blue silk, five taels of red silk, one jin of incense, and one tael of cinnabar. The Supreme Emperor requires trustworthy oath; any omission causes breach of method. If the master errs, he is demoted to serve Jade Boys and Maidens, returned to his original palace, no more than three years, body tested by wind blade, naturally losing the scripture. Those who receive without following the Bright Method lose sight, lose form, seven ancestors and parents bear the northern penalty, through myriad kalpas are reborn on the path of non-human; learners be cautious.

The third chapter of the Mysterious Capital Upper Grade says: Whoever has the golden name Eastern Flower, the jade character Upper Clarity, and receives the Supreme Firmament Langshu Jade Text Emperor Chapter, the Purple Degree Flame Light Mysterious True Transformation Scripture, the Upper Clarity Transformation Seventy-Four Directions, the Nine True Middle Scripture, the Danjing Dao Essence Hidden Earth Eight Techniques, the Scripture of Form Release and Transformation Flowing Scene Jade Scripture, and the Seven Transformations Dancing Heaven, all these are by the Nine Heavens True Kings, Primordial Heavenly King, Supreme Heavenly Emperor, Central Yellow Lord, received in the Supreme Void, within the Nine Mysteries, highest chapters of the void and nothingness. All are secreted in the Palace of Supreme Spirit Capital, within the Purple Chamber, with three thousand Jade Boys and Maidens guarding. From the beginning of the Primordial, the scripture is transmitted once every seven thousand kalpas; since the Three Ways’ establishment of correctness, within seven thousand years three transmissions are heard; within seven hundred years worthy persons receive transmission. All face ninety days of fasting, or thirty days, or nine days, swearing covenants and receiving, given to Jade Boys and Maidens, following the Four Extremes Method. If transmission is not according to method, guilt extends to seven ancestors and parents, compelled to ghost officials, moving Meng Mountain stones and filling the Night River, through myriad kalpas reborn on the path of non-human; body tested by wind blade, naturally losing scripture, never becoming immortal; transmitters beware.

The first chapter of the Mysterious Capital Middle Grade says: All these later learners, if from the seven ancestors down there is killing of life, robbery, scheming adultery, treason, nine clans interrelated, rebellion without way, their penalty is especially severe, resentment confronts fault and arrest, accumulation of nine yin, not subject to pardon. Later learners must not involve themselves or touch the True Scripture, nor secretly receive the precious text. If in great suffering, with determination and self-encouragement, first repent before the Seven Mysteries, repeatedly perform meritorious deeds, extract the dark soul, disclose one’s person beneath the Three Luminaries, loosen hair to the head, unwearied for three years, bearing heavy trust, cast into the Nine Rivers to redeem former faults; then permitted to receive one hundred days of pure fasting and receive the precious scripture, then carry out matters. Those guilty of such faults who do not first punish themselves, baring head to Heaven and Darkness and then receive the law, the master and disciples alike undergo the trial of the wind blade; the seven mysteries’ ancestors long confined in the hidden palace, bearing stone and mountain burdens, unending kalpas without release, death and scripture loss, be cautious and careful.

### The Mysterious Capital Nine True Bright Method Lower Grade Atonement Chapters

At year’s end, bearing nine pairs of golden rings, one tael of blue silk, one golden figure, cast into the mouths of the Three Rivers to redeem the seven ancestors’ crime, extract the dark soul’s difficulty. The method is inscribed in vermillion on a five-line tung wood tablet, stating: In such year, month, day, at such locality, the seven ancestors and parents of such person have incurred the Supreme or Middle Grade first chapter crime, bound in nine yin, now according to method punished by nine pairs of golden rings and one golden figure to redeem the cruel confronting dark soul; the tablet is cast and the command returned to the water official for self-release and liberation of sin, soul ascends to the Nine Heavens.

Great Yin Nine Lords, officers in charge of spirits, I now declare, return and report to the river source, cast into the nine sources, extract the seven mysteries, resentment and confrontation dissolved; my body ascends to immortality. Thus the seven ancestors’ penalties are released and dispersed, freed from the dark palace, ascending to the hall of blessing, the person then able to participate in cultivating the precious scripture, nine years able to have true spirit manifest in form, rising with the spirits. The mysterious method is especially severe, not to be offended again.

### Eulogy of the Supreme Emperor

Dim and obscure is primal transformation’s beginning, faint and thin the morning dew disperses. The Great Silent Void Mysterious Above, wide and clear are the two principles dividing. Condensing essence embracing the void embryo, forming transformation and nurturing the empty vision. Containing essence, profound spirit within, swiftly opening the dark dawn. Beginning to understand anxious brevity of life, fate crossing and reversing the heavenly river. Desolate stepping through the void, revolving walking to the Jade Capital. Bowing head and returning to the Great Nothing, riding the wind scattering spirit incense. Looking down upon the Emperor's hall, drifting following the void soaring. Wondrous singing issuing strange sounds, chanting the Supreme True chapters. Flowing through the four great realms, ten heavens immeasurably vast. The Lang Terrace emits dark night, spirit candles spouting wondrous light. Brilliant jade forest flowers, sparkling shining jade halls. The void produces natural smoke, luxuriant reigning on the mysterious thread. The many True Ones spread across the skies praising, precious canopy rising with the wind. Flying steps chanting void songs, spirit songs transforming the Dao long. Flourishing great transformation rises, numerous flourish the Dao prosper. Accumulated study following the sun’s influence, merit completed entering the great vehicle. Blessings and fortunes reaching all, seven ancestors all ascended. Aligning the chariot surmounting Taihua, turning the reins severing the sky pavilion. Spirit winds drum the empty cave, incense flowers riding smoke scatter. Desolate worship of spirit hall, solemn steps on the mysterious river. Loud chanting opening secret bosom, extracting and crossing old root difficulties. Five sufferings timely resolved, fragrant fame pouring like pottery and irrigation. Clear towers standing cloud nets, flying rosy clouds winging spirit chariots. Carrying and holding without trace of the True, graceful entering the great void. Riding the void chanting jade chapters, desolate chanting feathered writings. Broad thoughts with no omission, all blessings exceedingly abundant.

[The eulogies of the Heavenly Emperor, Supreme Micro Emperor, and Later Sagely Golden Gate Emperor continue similarly in lofty poetic style.]

The Supreme Ultimate Perfected Person said: The Supreme Simple Spirit Cave Mysterious Wondrous Scripture, born together with the Primordial, the spirit writings already existing, the many True Ones assemble at the seat, burn incense and worship the scripture, revolving to chant these twenty-one chapters, to celebrate in the divine court. The jade sounds are loud and clear, penetrating the nine heavens; the phrases are subtle and profound, wondrous and close in meaning; chanting once, ten thousand spirits awaken, always able to penetrate study, harmonizing with the Emperor in truth, resolving the heavy charges of old confrontations, extracting the seven mysteries’ dark palace, resolving the five sufferings of sorrowful souls, crossing the body above to birth in heaven. Wonderful indeed and subtle! This is the spirit writing.
