## Supreme Clarity Golden Writ and Jade Characters Upper Scripture

### Transmission by the Official Azure Youth Lord

The true star on the head, together with remembrance of the Cave Chamber Deity; the right foot points to the Emperor Star, the left foot points to the Venerable Star; when present, the left foot is slightly bent, so as to correspond to the stars. The left hand grasps the Northern Terrace, the right hand holds the Xuan Root; secretly preserving the incantation to completion, and reclining within the Northern Dipper. Practising it for nine years, one removes death and ascends to life, and is inscribed in the official registers of the various prefectures. Practising for eighteen years, the nine essences descend, and the cloud carriage appears to welcome. The Xuan Root is the essence name of the Nou Star. The Northern Terrace is the essence name of the Primary Star.

Reclining and resting within the Nine Dippers, the heart desires to fly as an immortal superior truth, sheltered beneath the splendid canopy, to ride clouds by day and ascend in the morning.

On the east wall of the Jade Chamber on Emei, the Supreme One engraved twenty-four characters in ancient script, incomprehensible now, here presented.

Azure Youth said: In forming the Cave Chamber, the face has three yang lines; two si snakes are arranged crosswise; the nose is the Heavenly Mountain; looking upward to the Bright Hall, the spirit gate is the Purple Gate; then one sees the Cave Chamber, a square jade disk standing upright, an inch in true square measure, quietly preserving the Dipper essence, coming to rest within it; it shines to shelter the red child, without the three kings of heroism; thus becoming a flying immortal, riding the mysterious chariot of dragons, ascending to the splendid celestial palace, commanding the jade maidens and jade youths; the Way is complete; secretly received and secretly practised.

The Official Azure Youth of the Palace of the Purple Canopy, at first carried out the Cave Chamber method, lying down with the splendid celestial body, reclining within the nine essences, binding soul and spirit upon the Northern Dipper, hence called the True Man within the Dipper. The former master went to receive from the Supreme Clarity Purple Essence Lord and the Primordial Supreme Void Lord the "Cave Chamber Upper Scripture"; Azure Spirit Yang’an Lord transmitted it to the Central Yellow Elder Lord, the Three Heavens Supreme One Primordial Lord, who created the Supreme Mysterious Master Immortal Mansion, established the Golden Writ, carved the Jade Characters, naming it the Cave Chamber Upper Scripture. The Jade Emperor handed it to the Later Sages Li and Peng Lords, to be given to those whose bones and fates are destined to obtain immortality, to be followed in practice, their names arranged in the Original Chart, inscribed with births and removals of death, flying and moving immortals, to serve as officials to the Later Lords Li and Peng. Thereupon these two lords gave the Golden Writ Cave Chamber Scripture in full to the Western Mysterious Palace Cave Terrace, entrusted to the True Men who have attained the Way, to transmit it to those who will become immortals. These two lords also gave the Jade Character Cave Chamber Scripture in full to the Officials of the Various Directions and the Mysterious Isles Immortal Capital Mansion, to teach the fixed destiny and bone names of those fated to attain the Way. The Later Sages, two lords, riding the chariot of the Supreme Void, roamed the gates of the Ten Heavens and Nine Caves, waiting for the appointed time and movement to assemble, then ruled as emperor, arranging the true officials on the Divine Terrace, teaching the seed people in peaceful times. The two lords all examined the fates of myriad beings, their good and evil, flying through the void and mystery, knowing which disciples of immortality and Taoists may succeed or fail. If the heart be sincere and the will devoted, firmly aspiring to the spirit truth, weary the whole year, emotions unshaken, spiritual mirror and form and bone already having the immortal name in the Jade Register, then these two lords concur in will, whereby you obtain this scripture. He who obtains and practises this scripture has his fate fixed; the Mysterious Pavilion Register already has recorded his living immortal name. The Later Sages, two lords, constantly conceal their forms, at first not transmitting themselves, but letting cause and condition lead to encounter, so that those who meet them obtain this divine scripture. Sometimes the scripture falls to common persons, or to those of vulgar and turbid nature; though they have this scripture, they do not practise it, thus serving men with Yin teachings and making them servants. Therefore those whose bone fate has immortal portion and obtain the scripture mostly do so through experiences and causes, thus attaining it. Sometimes they meet true immortals, first receive the scripture, the appointed time fulfilled, the year of transmission arrived; after careful examination of form and bone, then they are given to the disciple. You must be diligent in remembering the flying immortal, sitting and rising, invoking it in your heart, practising it long; you yourself will obtain this scripture. You must not say the scripture has come from mean and lowly persons, and thus despise its text, or scorn its transmission. This all is the mysterious fate of the Later Sages; Yin has already divided and apportioned, and those who should obtain the Way have been carefully examined; therefore it is given to you. Now the object of your reverence is to bear the two lords’ intention; thus you respect even the humble and lowly. Just as the master and principal of the world’s schools all receive reverence, are masters and principals necessarily all supremely worthy? They only trace the root mind afar. A quiet fast of seven days is required before receiving this scripture; practise and caution must be observed; serve and follow it; do not associate with the defiled and vulgar and disorderly; practise secretly, so as not to be noticed; outwardly identical with the vulgar, inwardly mirror-bright; thus only may one speak of the matter of the Cave Chamber.

This is the essential formula of the True Mother of Turtle Mountain, given to the Western City King Lord. The twenty-eight lunar mansions respectfully connect to the splendid celestial body, governing the movement of the gods of the four directions. According to the method of the Four Extremities and Four Truths, the faith of the Supreme Golden Writ and Jade Characters Cave Chamber is to establish the solemn oath of tearing silk, a pledge never to disclose falsely. Those who receive this scripture should offer blue brocade silk thirty-two feet in length, to present to the possessor of the scripture. The number of the four directions is each eight, together thirty-two feet. Those who have the scripture and this brocade are again given the secret formula of vapor and smoke as a mnemonic. If one first receives it from a true immortal, with no trace or mark left behind, then the distributed vapor and smoke are so derived; receiving it is then a bestowal to scatter and supply to the Way as need requires. It must not be given to outsiders in fragments. The Sovereign Above commands oath and alliance, and uses heavily the golden-blue tablets, called the alliance blue silk. The Nine Plain Scripture says: 'You who receive the golden-blue, the Above has already inscribed your name; take care not to scatter it otherwise, seeking wealth and honour.' This is the meaning. When selling this golden silk, always ask the Above to approve; do not rashly release to evade responsibility. The Mysterious also will examine your circumstances carefully. This all is the Supreme One’s scripture, all with fixed regulations. At first, one hears it once in a hundred years to obtain a transmission; in seven hundred years three transmissions; beyond this no further release. Transmitting to unfit persons, or exceeding the time limit and transmitting rashly, all are regarded as leakages and closures. Leakages and closures bring examination by the Three Officials for ancestors and descendants; death by heavenly punishment, and the becoming of lower demons. The King Lord says: within a hundred years two persons may be transmitted; also permitted, but sworn to have three transmissions within seven hundred years.

The Dipper stars are the purple canopy of the Supreme Ultimate, the spiritual forest of the Mysterious Truth, the seat of the nine emperors, the feast chamber of the Heavenly Venerables. You who walk the Way, your rank is Immortal Ancestor; you gain the flying dragon of the eight scenic views, ascend to the Supreme Subtle, enter and leave the Purple Court, feast and rest at the Northern Dipper, fly and circle the Cave Pass, look up and down the Mysterious Canopy, breathe the splendid celestial body, ride the flowing scene, to create the Three Mysteries; enter and exit the Purple Chamber, wander the Supreme Origin, named the Upper Golden Pavilion, ranked among the True Men.

At evening rest, first preserve the Dipper star upon the place of rest, cause the image to be drawn and preserved according to the above method. Let your head and crown be the Nine Extremes, to cause the true qi to enter the Mud Pellet; let your feet tread the Venerable Emperor’s two stars; always have in your mind the flying immortal; cause on high the binding of your seven souls; the Supreme Subtle restrains your three spirits; left hand grasps the Northern Terrace, right hand holds the Xuan Root. Practising for eighteen years, surely your colour returns to that of an infant face. Suddenly one day the essence of nine stars appears, transformed into the nine elders of the Supreme Emperor, all coming down to welcome with the mysterious shining flying dragon, desiring the true bell, riding eight carriages of jade and transporting purple-feathered splendid canopy, guided by immortal officials, in front the phoenix whistles, behind the celestial scale sounds, in green robes and blue belts, by day ascending in the morning, jade boys and jade girls present, thus taking up the headdress.

At evening rest, always secretly knock teeth thirty-seven times, swallow saliva thirty-seven times, the Yin incantation says: Nine stars’ supreme essence, Northern Pole True Lord, increase my essence and embryo, strengthen my three souls, left draw the sun’s splendour, right bind the moon’s ferry, in the stars the yellow light, original void yellow truth, cause me to fly as immortal, ascend to the purple smoke, spirit tiger jade tally, always guard the life gate, ten thousand evils submit to law, accept refining from the Dipper Lord.

At dawn about to rise, always secretly knock teeth twenty-seven times, swallow saliva twenty-seven times, the Yin incantation says: Heaven’s Origin Supreme One above, within the Dipper seven youths, Supreme Clarity Purple Essence, in the body of the sign, splendid celestial body purple canopy, Supreme Element Mysterious Palace, Later Sage Spiritual Qi, descend into the Cave Chamber, cause me to fly as immortal, obtain to walk the Supreme Ultimate Golden Hall.

At evening when first externally preserving the stars, all first Yin incant the star names, then preserve the stars only. The incantation says:

1. Supreme Great Star Essence, named Mysterious Pivot, may so-and-so fly as immortal, ride void chariot and float.

2. Primary Star Essence, named Northern Terrace, may so-and-so fly as immortal, wander and walk the Cave Terrace.

3. True Star Essence, named Nine Extremes Supreme Truth, may so-and-so fly as immortal, gain control of the Three Mysteries.

4. Nou Star Essence, named Xuan Root, may so-and-so jade name, be ranked among flying immortals.

5. Framework Star Essence, named Heavenly Balance, may so-and-so fly as immortal, ascend and walk Supreme Clarity.

6. Record Star Essence, named Life Mechanism, may so-and-so fly as immortal, name inscribed in Supreme Subtle.

7. Pass Star Essence, named Mysterious Yang, may so-and-so fly as immortal, obtain to command jade youths.

8. Emperor Star Essence, named Highest Jade Emperor, may so-and-so fly as immortal, obtain to ascend the Later Sage’s hall.

9. Venerable Star Essence, named Supreme Subtle Emperor Lord, may so-and-so fly as immortal, obtain to enter the cinnabar and jade chamber.

These nine clauses, in order, having completed the incantation, then preserve the stars and rest securely within the Dipper. Then again secretly knock teeth and swallow saliva, incant the nine stars’ supreme essence and Northern Pole True Lord’s words.

Having preserved and incanted all, after a long while, then preserve the essence of the Dipper stars; suddenly entering the Cave Chamber, the light shines upon the whole body, penetrating the five interiors, three gates, hundred joints, all made to shine with red light brilliantly. The incantation says: Cave Chamber Primordial Essence, red child supreme lord, Dipper light splendid canopy, come to shine upon the Mud Pellet, protect and refine bone and blood, bind soul and regulate spirit, cause so-and-so to fly as immortal, ride clouds and ascend in the morning, attend the Jade Emperor, Supreme One Primordial Lord. All completed.

The outward image of the Dipper stars is only the division of essence entering the Mud Pellet; it does not mean departing here to go there. Thus on the mat and in the head are both present.

Azure Youth Lord said: Lying upon the Yin essence of the Northern Dipper, cause the immortal to employ spirit; Cave Chamber causes the Northern Dipper Yang essence, making the five viscera self-generate, thus gaining to ride the scene, travel and walk Supreme Clarity. According to Azure Youth Lord’s words, the Northern Dipper has Yin and Yang two essences. This may also be an allegory of man’s having soul and spirit two essences. The Dipper stars cover the splendid celestial body, the essence shines through nine courses, its light overshadows ten heavens; Yang transforms in ninety-nine cycles, thus most high and venerable. Men of the world only see the seven stars, and do not see the other two, the eighth and ninth. These are the spirits of the Emperor and Supreme Lord, darkly concealed within the inner mirror, preserving and restraining the heavenly soul, spirit light shining brightly, serving as the seven stars’ guardian; but they do not shine upon worldly common men seeking fame and reputation. All who have attained to the Way, high immortals, noble and true, and officials of Supreme Clarity and Supreme Purity, alone are permitted to see them; seeing them they must not speak falsely. After seeing, the Highest Jade Emperor and Supreme Subtle Emperor Lord will then visit you and grant you true office. Worldly persons who leap and dash also sometimes mistakenly see these two stars; those who see them must be careful not to speak of the sight.

The Supreme One Spirit Register says: all who see the Northern Dipper Highest Supreme Subtle one star add three hundred years to their lifespan; those who see the two stars add six hundred years. But common men are mostly defiled, and do not come to have the two venerables descend. These stars are greater than the seven stars; their light is all purple splendor, differing from the ordinary, shining brightly, very awe-inspiring. Those who see them should all bow and kowtow and petition. Often on the third and twenty-seventh nights of the month, quietly watch for them, do not let others know. With sincere heart long continued, none fail to see them. The stars have three essences, hence the use of twenty-seven days. The Supreme One’s method states: all false naming of the essences, and those who see and disclose them, their bodies are attacked by war and fire, and at death they receive examination in hell; their parents and they incur guilt before the Three Officials. In the time of Qin, Xu Fu was an ordinary man, but also attained to seeing the two stars, and dared not speak, thus gained years; from then on believed in the world that there were immortals, and so learned the Way. Han men Han Zhong, Sima Jizhu, and the True Men Meng Zizhuo and Zhang Jujun of Middle Mountain, and even Yin Gui’s followers, all also saw them. The Han chancellor Huo Guang had a household servant named Huan Che, somewhat literate, who once saw a short scroll within the light strict apparatus, saying: ‘On the third and twenty-seventh days of the month, secretly watch the Northern Dipper; frequently do so; something will be seen; upon seeing, bow and then petition; do not transmit; all add three hundred years to life.’ Thus Huan Che kept knowledge secretly, often trying to see if it were true. Suddenly he saw the two stars above the Dipper, light extraordinary; he bowed and returned. Huan Che then gained six hundred years. This servant had little ambition and no great resolve, so did not learn the Way, but only prolonged his years before death. This speech comes from the King Lord; the Lord transmitted it to the Great Mao Lord.
