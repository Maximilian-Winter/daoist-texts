## Preface to the Commentary on the Supreme Cavern Inner Scripture

Composed by the Perfected Zhou

The Way may be learned, yet its subtlety is indeed hard. Immortality can be sought, but the refinement of essence is difficult. The Perfected may be seen, but the nurturing of will and nature is difficult. The Jade Maid may be made to serve, but the cultivation of purity and stillness is difficult. Therefore, the Eight Simples rank the True Thought as foremost; the Secret Words regard the Nine Truths as the Inner Scripture; the Divine Methods consider the refined thought as the profoundest; the returning to childhood by thorough truth is the spiritual attainment; the Great Cavern with its high exaltation is the Primordial Beginning; the Great Elixir with the female One and Three Simples is the inner essence; Lord Lao reveres Nature as the highest; the Supreme One esteems the No-Flower as pure; the Yellow Lord regards will and nature as the Way; the White Origin values purity and stillness as constancy; the Perfected seek unity of will and appearance; the essentials of immortality lie in refined responsiveness, then the Way is accomplished. These are all the precious aspects of the Way; you should contemplate them and practise accordingly. If thought is not responsive, the Way does not advance; if essence is not subtle, the true departs far away. Do not take death to harm life; do not let lust be unchaste; do not suddenly in drunkenness meditate upon the Way; do not seek life by perversion; do not advance for rank and emolument; do not regard ghosts as spirits; do not suddenly esteem wealth as treasure; do not fill yourself with fine ornaments; do not delight in vulgar customs; do not be led by sounds to impurity; do not allow pollution to defile purity; do not let the body be without essence. Many such are things men should avoid. Preserve the Cavern Chamber, be cautious of words I forbid. Men who live naturally knowing the Way are rare; cultivate and practise it, learn and refine it. Laozi said: "The superior man hears the Way, and diligently practises it." True indeed are these words. The Great Cavern is called the True Scripture because it is the utmost refinement of essence. The difficulty in subtle thought means the difficulty of preserving the Cavern Chamber. One who can be subtle and profound, whose refined thought is responsive to the utmost, who preserves and sees the No-Flower, the Way of the Perfected is complete. Laozi in the Outer Aspect says: "The essentials of long life and the essentials of the Room within the Chamber." If you are in the Cavern Chamber, and on your right see the White Origin Lord, then the immortal Way is accomplished; in the centre see the Yellow Old Lord, then longevity is ten thousand years; on the left see the No-Flower Lord, the utmost refinement of truth. When the Three Lords are seen, the sun rises to heaven, wearing flowing bells and tiger talismans, roaming in the Supreme Clarity. If in the world of men your virtues are recorded, but you have not these virtues, you cannot hope for immortality.

The first-born bears the golden seal and jade name;  
The second at the Great Mysterious Palace holds the white register;  
The third on the left hand has great characters;  
The fourth bears the azure mark on the back, resembling the River Chief;  
The fifth bears the Seven Stars on the body;  
The sixth has a purple radiance in the crown illuminating the body;  
The seventh moves like a crane and strides like a dragon, the body adorned with net-like patterns;  
The eighth has nine apertures in the heart, a blue cavity beneath the lungs;  
The ninth has five breaths born upon the head, connecting to the heavy clouds above;  
The tenth sounds like jade and gold, the mouth emits purple vapour.  
If one is born possessing these, there is no need to learn the Way; surely one shall become immortal. Next are those born free from the place of death; next, those with blue bones; next, those who surpass the ancients in conduct; next, those whose virtue equals the worthiest sages; next, those steadfast of will to the Way, focusing the heart on the subtle mysteries, whose secret virtue flows and acts; their conduct does not contravene the Way. Next are those whose will and conduct are pure and virtuous, their nature harmonious and kind, gentle, generous, and benevolent, whose preservation must be responsive. By this to learn the Way, one may attain immortality. Next are those whose ancestors bestowed grace, who for seven generations cultivated virtue, whose merits reach the Three Officials, who do not violate the gods and men; by diligence in the Way, one may again become immortal. Next are those whose ancestors have immortal fame, and who seek immortality with great merit among the Three Officials, having three hundred good deeds; they may attain immortality. Below these, no matter how talented and profound, how extraordinary and transcending the age, if lacking these superior matters, they suffer their own toil, and have no hope of immortality. The essential matter is that those born have the record of bones, they must have the will for immortality.

Now, with the Way I have received, I transmit to you; be careful not to pass it to unworthy persons. Formerly, Su Zixuan was a foreigner, expert in the Three-One practice, an immortal of the Central Mountain. In former days I loved the Way, and have met him; he bestowed upon me divine spirit-lichen and taught me the immortal Way, giving me the true secret characters of the Outer Scripture of Lord Lao’s Yellow Court. I have received and practised it, and have ascended to be a Perfected. You now learn the Way; write it down and I confer it upon you; act accordingly.

Preserve the Cavern Chamber White Origin Lord, always at sunrise, when the mysterious radiance is first born, standing facing the East, bow twice, close the eyes and look inward, hold the breath and swallow saliva one hundred and twenty times, then preserve the image of the Great God of the Red Palace within the Jade Chamber, and see the White Origin Lord. Practice this morning and evening, always following this method. On the day of Jiazi, at midnight when the vital breath arises, loosen the hair and powder the head, place the hands on the knees, hold the breath, swallow saliva one hundred and forty times; call the name of the Jade Chamber God; when called, the ear will hear as if a person answers; sometimes a sound of chanting scriptures is heard, this is the response. Then rub the eyes with both hands twenty-seven times and stop. The essential point of this practice is to be careful to wear fine clothes and coverings, and to avoid the approach of yin qi; seek a secluded and quiet chamber so that the ear hears nothing, the eye sees nothing, the heart harbours no thought, the body is still and spirit harmonious, then perform it. If near the world of men, if seen by others, or if sadness, fear, or alarm are seen, the spirit is offended, preservation will not be responsive, and the practice will fail. I then bow twice and perform it, preserving the Cavern Chamber for five years, and indeed saw on the right within the chamber the White Origin Lord, wearing dragon robes and tiger belts, seated on the right of the chamber. I privately laughed within myself, knowing the Way would surely be accomplished. Then I travelled the world, the Five Sacred Mountains and famous hills, meeting immortal men who orally transmitted to me Daoist instructions, in all over five hundred matters, which I will gradually transmit to you; keep them secret and cultivate them carefully, be cautious not to pass them to unworthy persons.

Formerly I ascended the Central Mountain, Mount Songgao, issued to Dongting, entered the Cavern Gate, met the Yellow Old Lord, and then bowed repeatedly, declaring: "I, Zhaoyi, have defiled the world of men, stained by turbid dust; since seventy years of age, privately harbouring one heart, secretly yearning for the Great Way, aspiring for the Divine Immortals. The true Way is profound and distant, miraculous and deep; though I have travelled the Five Sacred Mountains and surpassed famous hills, meeting immortal men and receiving secret instructions, yet my stubborn filth is hard to remove, and I have not yet attained flight. Now by the mysterious radiance and the returning sun, I have personally seen the true countenance and received the spirit’s light. Therefore I knock my head and beg, for the years of my life and my wishes, that I may receive pity and be granted the divine instructions." The Yellow Old Lord said: "Do you preserve the Cavern Chamber, and see the White Origin Lord?" Zhaoyi advanced and knelt answering: "I truly see the White Origin Lord." The Yellow Old Lord said: "You are not yet sufficient; go again to travel, receive the true instructions, which will be conferred by the Supreme True Way Scripture." Zhaoyi again knocked his head, beating himself, and earnestly begged to be sent on a mission to travel and serve the dragon chariot. The Yellow Old Lord said: "You have the golden seal and jade name; you shall become a Perfected; what have you to fear? You see the White Origin Lord; your immortal affairs are sufficient. To become a Perfected, preserve the No-Flower; if you see the No-Flower, the true Way is accomplished; you may preserve it. Do not try yourself." Zhaoyi again declared, begging for the Cavern Chamber Scripture, the Great Lord’s inner chapters. The Yellow Old Lord said: "Within the Cavern Chamber is the utmost essence, a great god, nameless; if not yourself, then the one who should receive it. Retire for purification and return later; then it shall be given to you." Zhaoyi then bowed twice and respectfully received the teaching. After retiring to the small chamber for three months, he ascended Tai Chamber again, re-entered the Cavern Gate, and met the Yellow Old Lord again. The Yellow Old Lord said: "Now I confer upon you the Cavern Chamber Inner Scripture; preserve this god, always at midnight, close your eyes and meditate quietly, think upon and read this scripture; suddenly you shall see the great god, who is the No-Flower Lord." Zhaoyi bowed twice, received the teaching, and practised it. After twenty-seven years, he saw the No-Flower Lord, and again preserved the sight of the Yellow Old Lord, who conferred upon him the Great Cavern True Scripture. Then he mounted the clouds and rode dragons, ascending to heaven in broad daylight. This scripture is most secret; now I confer it to you; be cautious not to pass it to unworthy persons.

## Commentary on the Supreme Cavern Inner Scripture

The Yellow Old Lord said:

The Yellow Old Lord is the Central Dao Lord, governing the Cloud Court Palace, the Cloud Court Cavern Chamber, and the Central Spirit Gate. His spirit name is Bo Tao, the so-called Way of the Great Lord.

Heaven has a divine palace, the Great Mysterious Elixir Spirit,  
The Great Mysterious Elixir Spirit is the palace of the Heavenly Emperor, also called the Great Subtle, the Purple Palace, the Elixir Platform, the Spirit Palace, the dwelling of the Sovereign Heaven Supreme Emperor. It resembles man’s Cavern Chamber. To discuss the essentials within the Purple Chamber, first speak of the Purple Palace Elixir Spirit.

Heaven has the Great Chamber, the Jade Chamber Cloud Court,  
The Cloud Court is the residence of the Central Yellow Old Lord; man is in the centre of the Cavern Chamber. The Jade Chamber is the Cavern Chamber, also called the Purple Chamber, the Red Palace, the Bright Hall; above it is the glorious canopy, palaces east and west, connected to the left and right Yellow Courts.

The Cavern of Kunlun is set, high and not inclined,  
Kunlun is the head; the Purple Chamber Cavern connects to the head, both high and deep. It symbolizes Kunlun, the Mysterious Garden south of the Yellow Chamber; south of it lies the Dongting chamber room, also named the Cavern Gate. Since we discuss the Purple Chamber, we first mention the head.

Where spirits and immortals dwell, a Golden Hall and Jade City.

The Cavern Chamber has a golden city and jade chamber, opening in four directions to the Spirit Palace, with mysterious radiance beside it, the essence of the Cavern within clouds; the abode of the Three Elders among the spirits and immortals.

Square and round, within three inches,  
The Cavern Chamber is square and round, a golden and jade palace chamber, within three inches.

Yellow Gate and Purple Door, most profound and refined,  
Within the Purple Chamber is the Yellow Gate, connected to the Yellow Court; in the centre is the Purple Door. The Purple Door is also named Cloud Court, the very place the Yellow Old Lord dwells. Within the Purple Door is both profound and ultimate refinement.

Left connects to the Green Palace, right flanks the Bright Pure,  
The left is the Green Mansion, the abode of the Green Youth; the right is the Bright Pure Mansion, the residence of the White Simple Jade Maid. Broadly preserving them, the Green Youth may be the Nine Old Lords; subtly refining them, the White Simple Jade Maid is the Mother of the Western Purity. These are the divine aliases of the left and right eyes; preserving them day and night, one may attain immortality.

In the centre is the Great Truth, indescribable,  
It is said that within the Cavern Chamber is a Great God, most true and subtle; at the left is the No-Flower Lord, also named the Element Lord, the Divine Young Master; at the right is the White Origin Lord, also named the Cavern Yang Lord. These are the greatest gods within the Jade Chamber. If you focus and can preserve them, the true Way is accomplished.

Who are the parents? Born of nature’s void,  
This Lord of the Primal Essence and Elements has no father or mother; mingled and solitary, he alone exists, being born first from the Great Void. Preserve him day and night without neglect.

He wears a glorious crown and purple canopy, bearing flowing golden bells,  
The No-Flower Lord supports a glorious crown, governs the purple spirit canopy, wears flowing golden bells, roams the Great Mystery, masters the True Scriptures. The method of preservation is always at the time after midnight vital breath, sitting upright, placing hands on both knees, holding breath, closing eyes and looking inward, chanting: "Three Primes heroic breath, Great Mysterious Purple Palace, Yellow Gate Golden Chamber, in the midst the Great God, glorious crown and purple canopy, dragon robes and tiger patterns, issuing elixir entering void, calling yang summoning yin, the Way of Heaven is true, named No-Flower, support my life, create me, and with the Way endure." 

Dragon robes and tiger belts, reading the Scripture of the Cavern Truth.  
This is the White Origin Lord, also wearing dragon-patterned garments, bearing the talisman of the divine tiger. In cultivation and preservation, always at dawn at sunrise, facing precisely east, bow twice, hold breath, close eyes and look inward, chanting: "Supreme Divine Essence, right at the Spirit Gate, dragon robes and tiger belts, glowing morning glorious crown, holding the register and scriptures, this is the White Origin; together with me roam above to the Yang Gate, circle the Nine Purities, and return to rest in the Yellow Chamber."

Leaving the Yellow Chamber banquet, playing in the Elixir Field,  
The Yellow Chamber is the Cavern Chamber. No-Flower and White Origin emerge from the Yellow Chamber, together roaming the Elixir Field. Preserving them day and night, one surely becomes a Perfected.

Ascending to the Great Subtle, at times entering the Mysterious Cavern,  
The Divine Mansion is the Mysterious Cavern, the Great Subtle Sovereign Heaven Emperor’s palace. If you can preserve and see the No-Flower, then you attain the Supreme True Instructions, the Great Cavern True Scripture. This is the true Way. Seeing the White Origin Lord, the immortal Way is complete. Broadly speaking, the No-Flower Lord is the elemental truth; the White Origin Lord is the higher immortal Way.

Meeting in harmony the Six Directions, united with Lord Tao of the Peach,  
Lord Tao is the Great Dao Lord, in scarlet robes and purple crown, located at the Gate of Fate. The No-Flower Lord and Great Dao Lord contain form within the Six Directions. Separate instructions exist.

At times roaming the Seven Gates, thoroughly seeing the Yellow Peace,  
Yellow Peace is the spirit’s name of the Yellow Chamber, located one cun above the centre between the breasts. Often at dusk, clenching teeth twenty-seven times, one chants: "Yellow Chamber man, wearing yellow essence, harmonizing true flowing breath, circulating my form, calling the soul and controlling the spirit, that I may live long, drawing left and right together, the Yellow Spirit hides the body."

Calling the yang and summoning the yin, commanding the Six Ding,  
Yang are the Supreme Three Yang; yin are the three yin within yang; the Six Ding are the divine maidens. When the Perfected calls yang, the three breaths come; summons yin, the three dragons ascend; commands the Six Ding, the divine maidens appear. The way of calling yang has its separate scripture, the scripture of Lord Lao.

Primordial Chaos one radiance, returning to the Primal Yang,  
The Three-One is also a great god. Primal Yang is another name. The White Origin Lord and the One enter and exit together, meeting in the Elixir Field. The Three-One guards secret instructions.

The Three are subtle and wondrous; the chamber is the true capital,  
The Three Subtleties are the nine mud of the head, the red palace in the heart, and the elixir field below the navel. These three subtleties are all truly wondrous; their true capital is only the Jade Chamber’s most refined essence; how subtle and profound it is!

Deep indeed is the subtlety, preceding the origin,  
The Cavern Chamber is utmost subtle; the spirit within is most refined and true; it is born from the Lord of the Primordial Void, the breath of the Upper Origin.

If you can see it, you rise at broad daylight.  
Dawn is the spirit within the Great Subtle. The Great Subtle has five palaces; Dawn is the palace of the Great Ultimate, its right hall the palace of the Perfected. Within is the Jade Chamber; the No-Flower Lord dwells on the left, the White Origin Lord on the right.

Refined and penetrating spirit vision, yang breath forms clouds,  
Calling the three yang breaths is the forming of the three simples into clouds. When penetrating the Cavern and Six Directions, the three spirits come to see. Then the three breaths transform into clouds, called the clouds of the three simples.

Penetrating the Cavern and Six Directions, drawing yin and summoning dragons,  
Among yin and yang are the three yin. Refined and penetrating spirit vision, the three simples form clouds; penetrating the Cavern and Six Directions, the three yin summon dragons, riding clouds and dragons, the true Way is complete.

The purple-green canopy above, roaming the immortal palace,  
Purple-green is the glorious canopy. The immortal palace is the palace of the Great Ultimate. With utmost refinement and spirit vision, riding clouds and dragons, covered by the purple canopy, the Jade Maid Yu Yuan ascends to the Emperor Lord, roaming the immortal palace; thus the immortal Way is greatly accomplished, and one becomes a Perfected.

The Cavern Chamber is complete; be cautious not to transmit falsely.  
The Central Yellow Old Lord says the Way within the chamber is complete; be cautious not to transmit falsely to unworthy persons.

At morning, noon, and evening, preserve and contemplate the five directions’ cloud qi:  
East with azure qi transforms into the Blue Dragon; West with white qi transforms into the White Tiger; South with red qi transforms into the Vermilion Bird; North with black qi transforms into the Dark Warrior; Centre with yellow qi transforms into oneself.

Morning Chant:  
Subtle and vast indeed, the primal qi, essence and radiance.  
Magnificent and delightful, the soaring of soul and spirit.  
Hidden within my breast, the centre vast and empty as a spread expanse.  
Beams as white as the bright moon, penetrating all directions.  
The spirit-lichen grows splendidly, untroubled by rootlessness.  
Breathing out the old and breathing in the new, to communicate with the divine spirits.

Evening Chant:  
Vast and boundless, with spirits without term,  
Clothed in beauty, fed on mystic spirit-lichen,  
Galloping like horses, with jade scales as baggage,  
Up and down without limit, entering and exiting without fixed time,  
All diseases removed and healed, spirit and qi alone maintained,  
Life supervisors keep records, jade slips and elixir writings,  
Compiled with gold thread, bound with white silk,  
Countless in number, nothing doubted,  
The Great One protects me, divine spirits uphold me.

With pure stillness and complete cessation of thought, recite towards the King’s direction, also towards the sun and stars. Wearing the talisman official’s attire and making covenant with Heaven and Earth, those who comprehend the Way and Joy of the Body all recite it. If not according to the method, the penalty is five hundred strokes, and the chief officer will sit in judgment.

Forbidden on the days Wuchen and Wuxu; this chant is from the Ninth Scroll of the Zhengyi Xuandu Code.
