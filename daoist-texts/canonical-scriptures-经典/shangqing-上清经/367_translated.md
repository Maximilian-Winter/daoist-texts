## The Supreme Clarity Golden Palace Lord's Five Dipper Three-One Diagram Manual

At the precise moment of midnight on the vernal equinox, arise and sit facing east. Close the eyes and hold in mind the Three Palaces, Three Ones, Three Ministers, and myself—seven persons in all, myself seated at the centre. Together we mount upon the purple qi mist, and ascend to the Bright Star of the Northern Dipper. The Bright Star is the eastern deity of the Northern Dipper. Thereupon, entering the midst of the star and sitting, swallow the purple qi thirty times, continuing long in this practice. Presently one beholds the Bright Star’s Eastern Prime Supreme Palace, within which there dwells a small azure-black youth who imparts to the disciple the True Radiance. First hold within the Northern Dipper star the purple qi as large as a bow-string, pouring directly downward before me; then next hold the Three Ones.

[Master] Zhou’s formula: Hold the seven persons united with the head of the dipper, the seven stars, and all together ascend the Bright Star, as in a flying-geese formation, myself in the central position. The head star is the one which covers the handle, the ladle pointing forward. Swallow the purple qi thirty times, holding and swallowing it. Also think upon the Three Ones and the Three Ministers, and swallow all at once; then again hold the seven persons, with the purple qi coming downward from the surrounding direction, returning to the Three Palaces. After a long while, the heart utters a blessing:

The Three Honoured Supreme Truths, the Great Mysterious High Deities,  
The Bright Star presides over Spring, myriad children opening the gate;  
The Red Origin presides over Summer, vermilion qi merging into smoke;  
The Yin Essence presides over Autumn, heavenly majesty with six arrays;  
The North Pole presides over Winter, myriad evils blocked and suppressed;  
The five earths of Geng and Ren, Wu and Ji are heavenly gates,  
Whatever they crush is destroyed, none can withstand their force;  
Refine my seven souls, harmonize my three spirits,  
Generate my five viscera, grant me true attainment,  
Ascend and fly to Supreme Clarity, float amid the seven elements,  
Long life following the course, commanding a thousand gods to howl my fate.

When finished, one may also sleep, holding it in mind. The four seasonal festivals share this one blessing alone.

At the summer solstice midnight, arise and sit facing south. Close the eyes and hold in mind the Three Palaces, Three Ones, Three Ministers, and myself—seven persons in all, myself in the centre. Together we mount upon the purple qi mist, and ascend to the Red Origin Star of the Northern Dipper. The Red Origin is the southern deity of the Northern Dipper. Thereupon entering the star and sitting, swallow the purple qi thirty times, continuing long in practice. Presently one beholds the Red Origin Star’s Southern Pole Supreme Palace, within which dwells the Vermilion Yang Spirit Consort, who imparts to the disciple the crimson manuscript of precious texts.

At the autumnal equinox midnight, arise and sit facing west. Close the eyes and hold in mind the Three Palaces, Three Ones, Three Ministers, and myself—seven persons in all, myself at the centre. Together we mount upon the purple qi mist, and ascend to the Yin Essence Star of the Northern Dipper. The Yin Essence is the western deity of the Northern Dipper. Thereupon entering the star and sitting, swallow the purple qi thirty times, continuing long in practice. Presently one beholds the Yin Essence Star’s Western Prime Supreme Palace, within which dwells a white and plain young maiden, who imparts to the disciple the jade manuscript of the tiger script.

At the winter solstice midnight, arise and sit facing north. Close the eyes and hold in mind the Three Palaces, Three Ones, Three Ministers, and myself—seven persons in all, myself in the centre. Together we mount upon the purple qi mist, and ascend to the North Pole Star of the Northern Dipper. The North Pole Star is the mysterious deity of the Northern Dipper. Thereupon entering the star and sitting, each swallows the purple qi thirty times, continuing long in practice. Presently one beholds the North Pole Star’s Northern Prime Supreme Palace, within which dwells the Mysterious Spirit True Man, who imparts to the disciple the golden manuscript of secret characters in the sequence of three and five.

On the first or fifteenth day of the sixth month, avoiding the days of the autumnal equinox and summer solstice, at midnight sit facing southwest. Close the eyes and hold in mind the Three Palaces, Three Ones, Three Ministers, and myself—seven persons in all, myself at the centre. Together we mount upon the red, purple, blue, and yellow four qi mists, and ascend to the Heavenly Gate Star of the Northern Dipper. The Heavenly Gate Star is the central deity of the Northern Dipper. Thereupon entering the star and sitting, swallow each of the four coloured qi ten times in turn, beginning with the scarlet qi. Continuing long in practice, one beholds the Heavenly Gate Star’s Middle Prime Supreme Palace, within which dwells the Great King of Supreme Might and Truth, who imparts the talisman for destroying demons, the yellow-clad soldier's register, and the evil banishing axe.

The eight seasonal festivals each guard eight days, beginning at midnight of the festival day; on other days one simply holds quiet in the Three Palaces. Perfect concentration and imagination cause a most vivid semblance.

The recited formula of the Five Dipper True Unity Scripture follows.

The Daoist student, dwelling in mountain forests in solitude, long secluded in cave chambers, far removed from the mundane world, grows ever more refined, and the spirit rapidly attains. But one must observe this: many do not know the rules of reckoning the calendar, nor the divisions of the degrees of the calendar, so they make their own calendar days. Not knowing the method of calendrical days, the days of the twenty-four solar terms and eight seasonal festivals can never be truly known. Nor can they yearly issue from the human world to inquire and seek the record; this is one doubt of the scholars. Now I request the natural calendrical method of the Northern Emperor: the third day of the first month is the Beginning of Spring; the fifteenth day of the second month is the Vernal Equinox; the first day of the fourth month is the Beginning of Summer; the sixteenth day of the fifth month is the Summer Solstice; the seventh day of the seventh month is the Beginning of Autumn; the twelfth day of the eighth month is the Autumnal Equinox; the fifth day of the tenth month is the Beginning of Winter; the eleventh day of the eleventh month is the Winter Solstice. The mountain hermit should use this method. If one understands the external calendar’s eight seasonal festivals, one should accordingly follow them. The eight seasonal festivals of the calendar are the utmost degrees of the celestial sphere’s pivot, the days of the myriad true spirits, immortals, and luminous deities’ morning and evening audiences.

The Northern Emperor’s natural method, the days on which two brightnesses of the month coincide, is also a most auspicious time. It is proper to build and cultivate virtue on these days; I follow a single method.

Foreign lands reckon the first day of the month as the beginning, the second day as the clearing, counting by numbers. Now being without a calendar, this is usable. The Xiongnu country reckons the first day of the first month as Jia Yin; the new moon is six Jia; the cycle repeats. The months are alternately large and small: first month large, second large, third small, fourth large, fifth small, sixth large, seventh small, eighth large, ninth small, tenth large, eleventh small, twelfth large.

For those deeply secluded in the wilderness and utterly remote from worldly tracks, this too must be followed.

Whenever the beginning day arrives, or the first day of the month at dawn, hold the Three Ones and emerge from one’s own Three Palaces, sitting before oneself; then the heart arises in double obeisance. If one sees it vividly, then inwardly offer this blessing:

Heavenly Honoured Three Emperors, guarding the gate of life,  
Travel in the void midst, six qi profound rotations,  
Nourish my five spirits, regulate my three souls,  
My five viscera arise naturally, long life flying immortal.  
Finished. Then hold as returning from the void to the Three Palaces; after a long while swallow saliva thirty times. In this way one dreams at night of the Three Ones and the Three Ministers. Or dreams of white crows, white cranes, white tigers, and golden jade objects—all transformations and signs of the Three Ones. If kept thus without negligence, one will imagine their images, and gradually behold them face to face.

---

Whenever the clearing day arrives at midnight, secretly rise and face north. Looking up to the seven stars of the Northern Dipper’s inner image, behold the Three Ones descending from the auxiliary star to enter one’s own Three Palaces; then return to rest quietly. Concentrate and hold this in mind, as if one seems to see it, and softly bless:

Supreme Heaven’s Assistance, the Three Emperors’ journey,  
The Three Ministers supporting Xu, united with the True,  
Descending into my body, sitting in peace and quiet,  
Exhaling essence, pouring into the form,  
Soul and spirit harmonized and moistened,  
Grant me flight as immortal, cloud-chariot moving in floating.  
Finished. Swallow saliva twenty-seven times. The month takes one clearing day alone.

---

Whenever the opening day arrives at midnight, arise and sit facing east. Remove the cap, or the hair may be loosened and combed and tied. After a long while, softly chant:

Upper Origin Three Truths, the infant among Truths,  
Loosen hair and scatter smoke, ascending to Heavenly Terrace,  
The mud pellet firm and solid, simultaneous with Heaven,  
Grant me flight as immortal, traveling in the cave terrace.  
Finished, swallow saliva nineteen times, then put on the cap and sleep.  
Diligently hold in mind the Three Ones and Three Ministers, each occupying their palace, the Lord and Ministers sitting opposite each other.  
Hold the Three Ones and Three Ministers, each calling qi in their palace, thirty times.  
When holding, also call qi thirty times oneself.  
Calling qi means opening the mouth to emit qi.  
At this time one should feel a warmth throughout the body, a sign of spirit harmonizing and soul condensation.  
Hold unity before the eyes, inwardly viewing the Spirit Palace.

The method of holding unity is to cause the Three Supreme Elemental Qis to appear within the Three Palaces. The Three Supremes are the purple, blue, and scarlet mysterious coloured qi, with purple above. Thus holding and guarding the Three Ones within, imagine seeing the North Pole Purple Chamber Jade Palace, and the celestial officials in order. Imagine standing before the Lord in the palace, making requests and petitions, and heartily bowing.

The Supreme is Supreme Clarity; the Emperor of Supreme Clarity is of extreme nobility. The North Pole Purple Chamber is the Lord’s chamber. Also hold one’s own Three Ones, discussing with the Lord the method of flying true life and generation.

Whenever partaking of sumptuous food, always regulate the heart and hold the Three Ones; then imagine that one first drinks and eats, then signals to eat. Always thus, and evil qi recedes and true qi advances. After drinking and eating, inwardly bless:

Hundreds of grains enter the stomach and unite with spirit and qi,  
Filling and replenishing the blood, corpse-evil perishes and falls away,  
Surpassing and ascending the Golden Gate, everlasting life in heaven and earth,  
Commanding the six Ding spirits, the spirit children attend and guard.

---

The method of guarding unity is on Jiawu, Jiachen, and Jiayin days at midnight: sweep and clear the courtyard for sleep, spread mats one zhang square, burn incense and bow twice facing north; also mental obeisance suffices. Looking up to the seven stars of the Northern Dipper, cause the purple qi to emerge from the dipper, enter the body’s Three Palaces, and go north to meet the two streams of the hands above. Hold the Three Ones, Three Ministers, and the body, all mounting purple qi to ascend the Supreme Ultimate. The Supreme Ultimate is the Northern Dipper star. Cause forgetfulness of body and loss of form, as if ascending to heaven. Thus the way of immortality is near. The immortals call this the Great Stillness. In yin rain one may think of it upon the bed, or may prepare an altar in a pure place, one zhang square, fenced four sides several feet high, to be regularly cultivated on the appointed days—this is the way of Great Stillness.

The method of guarding unity is to always await the moon’s initial rising time, and face the moon to bow twice. After bowing, inwardly bless:

The Mysterious Spirit of the Great Yin, Lady of the Bright Moon,  
Newborn flowing radiance, illuminating my Three Palaces,  
Spirit immortals ascend and fly, roaming high in eight directions,  
Wherever going, whatever wishing, all is within blessing.

The method of guarding unity is always to hold the seven dipper stars over the head, the handle pointing forward. Thus no hundred evils dare to harm, and evil qi perishes of itself—this is the essential formula.

Those who guard unity must avoid eating the five pungent plants and all kinds of meat, and avoid walking barefoot in the houses of women in childbirth. On the day of Jiazi, hold in mind and also avoid seeing great drunkards and all who are foul with death’s stench; all must be shunned and guarded against, without doubt. Also avoid holding infants, or being near black beasts or insects. Do not share clothes or shoes, nor bed or mat while holding unity. Think of the True, calm the spirit, recall the Way, and invite the spirits—these all desire to reach a separate place, not merely this one matter alone.

Later sages of the Golden Palace Lord received the "Three Primes True Unity Scripture," the "Supreme Ultimate Lord’s True Talisman," the "Five Dipper True Unity Scripture," and the "Great Ultimate Lord’s Precious Chapter," altogether four manuals. Later they were transmitted to the immortal Juanzi. Juanzi fished in the river and caught a carp; upon opening it he found a jade casket, and therein discovered two talismans and two scriptures and methods. This is the Supreme Highest Secret Method, the highest path of earthly truth, also to be received at the court of Supreme Clarity, to roam the Supreme Ultimate, to fly and roam the void, and to rest in the Kun Xuan.

According to the laws of the Four Poles Bright Methods of the Spirit-Manifesting Talismans, all holders of the Earth True Supreme Scriptures must abide by the transmission term limits, swear oaths to the Three Officials, entrust silk and blood on the altar, and bind themselves by contract before receiving the teaching.

The receiver must fast one hundred days, or fifty days, or thirty days, or ten days, or seven days. Only those with sincere hearts towards the teaching, with refined heart and belief in the True, may receive the transmission. Those who guard the Three Primes True and employ the talismans of the Two Emperors, and ascend by the Five Dipper Way, these are the highest paths of Earth Truth. The method limits transmission to one person every forty years, ten persons every four hundred years. If no suitable person is found, write a full copy on white silk, and seal it within a secret chamber of the Five Sacred Mountains, renewing every forty years a copy and sealing it likewise. The Five Sacred Mountains are taken as a single mountain, not necessarily spreading throughout the five mountains, but taking the nearest place of habitation. If one cannot reach the mountain, a famous mountain will suffice. For example, Bao Du in the north, Di Tai in the west, Luo Fu and Da He in the south, Tian Tai and Kuo Huo in the east—these are all famous mountains. If in forty years ten persons appear fit to receive, transmit to them; beyond the limit none may again emerge. Violation or disclosure contrary to the rules leads the body to the Water Official’s punishment, the scourging of the Wind Blade, and destruction of descendants thereafter. The binding oath of blood is that which the Azure Youth Lord received, shown to late learners as an eternal regulation. If receiving the Three Primes True Unity Scripture, one must perform oath and covenant. The oath guards the spirit, the covenant strengthens the heart, so that no creature may violate, nor heaven and earth contravene. The receiver of the highest unity method uses forty feet of purple patterned silk and one bright mirror; the middle unity uses forty feet of scarlet silk and two pairs of rings; the lower unity uses white silk according to years, one foot equals one year, counted thus, and two pairs of gold rings. The scripture master receiving these oath objects awaits the exhaustion of the forest, marsh, and mountain power, to rescue in urgent need of the journey or sickness, and must not misuse them for personal gain. Those who violate and do not observe will die as low spirits and receive scourging by the Wind Blade. Transmission from father to son must also have oath as law. Transmission of this scripture is mutual teacher and friend; this is the law of Heaven and Man.

He who receives the Great Cave Guard Unity Scripture is the master; he who receives this scripture is the disciple. Thus the utmost foundation is established, the sincerity of Heaven made bright, the divine spirits the object of reverence, and the hierarchy of master and friend entrusted. The friend and master regulate the exterior; the Three Ones reflect the interior; the Lord rejoices in his palace; the infant delights in his residence. Here the Purple Chamber excels in the heavens, the cinnabar field shines brightly; the Three Elders descend upon the chamber, the Three Flowers rest in the bed. Soon the spirit will ascend the Great Rosy Clouds, trust and cross the void, the body united with wondrous spirit, ascending the white sun to Heaven. Those who violate this Way are incomplete; those who leak this prohibition have broken bodies; those who hear of this Way have extended life; those who practise this Way are immortals. Can one not be careful?

---

Those not having from past lives the immortal bones, the mysterious register, or golden jade name, cannot hear or see the subtle Way of True Unity. Or else from past lives they practised good, their merits full three hundred; or were compassionate and of supreme virtue, benevolent even to black beasts; or by their nature and destiny were met and united with the spirits. Such as these all attain the Three Ones. Of old, Zi Jin attained it, riding cranes and riding clouds; An Qi attained it, turning five stars; Juanzi attained it, ascending to Supreme Clarity; Zhu Shi attained it, flying storm to Northern Ocean. This Way is subtle indeed, and grants long life.
