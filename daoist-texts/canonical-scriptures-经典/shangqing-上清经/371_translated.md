## Annals of the Later Holy Daoist Sovereign of Shangqing

By Fang Zhu, East Palace Qing Tong Jun, transmitted by disciple Wang Yuanyou

The Later Holy Emperor Sovereign of the Golden Pavilion of Shangqing, Li Zhu Hongyuan, also named Xuanshui, styled Zigang and also Shanyuan, was born of the lineage of the Earth Sovereign, a person of the era of the Mysterious Emperor. In the seventh year of Shanghe, in the year Bingzi, on the day of the combined cycle in the third month, he was born beneath Tian Gang mountain of the northern state, in the household of the Li family. His mother first dreamed of dark clouds entwining the form of sun and moon, and was thereby moved and conceived. Upon bathing the child, a company of dragons spouted water into the basin. At the age of five he delighted in the Dao and loved the genuine; he spoke and recited in complete compositions, often looking up to the sun with joyful smiles, facing the moon he chanted and sighed, observing the brilliant display of yang energy and perceiving the declension and decay of yin principle.

Thereupon he gathered his soul and refined his spirit, guarded the precious embryo of his being, recorded the essence and quelled the blood, consolidated the fluids and solidified the sinews. He then studied the swallowing of light and drinking of mist, and the chewing of flying roots. At the age of twenty he possessed the golden form and jade countenance; he abandoned home and kin, transcended near and far amid dust and wind, secluded himself in chambers for long fasting, and wandered among famed mountains. He alone held the talisman of the Spirit Platform, the mysterious illumination and yielding transformations; he comprehended the three energies and contained their changes, penetrated the pivot of the dark spirit to attain true alignment, raising his resolve to the void above, and holding sincerity to the utmost subtlety. His bearing was serene and spiritual, his hidden purpose vast and tranquil, his transcendent reason strange and free, profound and great in quietude.

He rested his heart beyond the celestial scene, restrained his soul to return to the crimson court within, controlled his spirit so that azure and dark energies jointly guarded, nurtured the breath in the chamber of cinnabar and elixir. Thus the spirit was neither opened nor lost, the numen did not scatter in tempest; his inner virtue was complete and full, his external burdens far and distinguished. He excluded celestial nets upon the earth’s expanse, sought the perfect truth in the purple pavilion. Then his essence moved the great void, his heart communicated with divine dawn, and he caused the heavenly emperor to descend and teach. His radiance gathered and uplifted, he was given the Great Ceremony Grand Scripture of the Great Cavern of Truth, provided with the curved morning flying canopy, drinking the returning water of the jade essence, bestowed with pure feathers and dark wings, so as to ascend the eight directions.

At this time he received his commission, withdrew to fasting and practiced his teachings. He recited the scripture in twenty-four matters, diligently longing for the supreme assembly, without weariness in thought. At times he would absorb the subtle mysteries, then concentrate and lose himself, advancing machines to find the root; then with discretion he alone assumed responsibility, studied the scripture and chanted the profound, enlightened beyond external things, his spirit dwelling in the nine horizons, with contemplation of cessation and forgetting.

When the Sovereign’s high melody opened the appointed time, fine burdens dissolved, he stooped in harmony with the many companions, refined the spiritual border, cut off stagnation and dissolved doubts; the profound principles were widespread and unparalleled, all parties daily drew upon the pure waves, yet measured not the source and beginning of the heavenly abyss.

He penetrated and opened the void within, the spiritual origin inwardly illuminated; here the Purple Micro Supreme True Heavenly Emperor, the Jade Pure Lord, sent the eight scenic jade attendants to come and welcome the Holy Sovereign, to ascend to the Shangqing palace, bestowing the flower-hard elixir, jade phoenix seal, the talisman of the divine tiger, and feathers of flight; a crimson brocade dragon skirt, blue robe and tiger belt, a waist girdled with radiant clouds and sun children, wearing the round-faced divine crown, receiving the title of the Later Holy Emperor Sovereign of the Shangqing Golden Pavilion.

He ascended to Shangqing, mid-traversed the Great Ultimate officialdom, governed the ten heavens below, was enfeoffed as master of the myriad people, and also of the gods, immortals, rivers, seas, and earthly springs of the various heavens; he inspected the profound hidden roots within the gloomy terraces, managed the mysterious and spread the breath, dispersed clouds and swept the ford, soared and glanced at small beings, guided and harnessed Turtle Mountain, reached to the depths and revealed concealments — all things, however minute, were within his control.

When the Holy Sovereign’s travels were about to be seen, jade wheels and resplendent chariots, blue ranks and mysterious dragons, three pure flowing clouds, moon essence breathing fragrance, flying sounds encircling the sun, flashing lightning sharpening edges, rushing serpents striking swords, long fangs striking bells, splendid lights interchanging and dazzling, three candles combined in brightness; before his whistle the nine phoenixes sang in unison, behind his flute the eight luan birds sounded together, the divine tiger raised its cry, the flying dragon bowed and moaned, the heavenly scales played their banners and canopies, a hundred sounds issued from the empty court, the spirit consorts offered grass praises, immortal guests opened the way, divine maidens waved purple matrimony to disorder the qi, jade youths moved the sun’s radiance to repel the dusk, long songs formed a cloud array, without day or night.

At that time, the heavenly light was obscure and remote, streaming reflected beyond the eight quarters, truly the grand spectacle of the Great Ultimate, the exalted emperor of Shangqing. Therefore, he is exalted in Shangqing because the spirit is high and the numen mysterious; he mid-traverses the Great Ultimate because he commands the assembly of the true flying immortals; he governs the ten heavens below because he is enfeoffed as master of the myriad people; he inspects the gloomy heavens below because nothing beneath escapes his control.

For it is only when the two energies separate and unite, when the principles of things have their cycle, when the three paths wane and wax, and come forth according to their motion, that the appointed time arrives; in accordance with it one adapts, and when the motion comes one receives and nurtures it.

In the forty-sixth year of the Tang Cheng reign, between the middle and end of that term, during the era of the dark beasts, the nation’s fate was nearly exhausted; east and west vied for supremacy, to support the weak ruler, who had the name of the strategist of nine and one. Then came the time of Hao Guang’er, after Changyuan, in the year of Jiashen; before and after, the good men were sown, the degenerate people removed; pestilence and waters mingled above, war and fire encircled beneath; evil and evil together perished, wicked and wicked alike were destroyed. The good adhered to the Dao and hid in seclusion; the virtuous ascended the mountains; the turbid flowed and rushed; they controlled the whale abyss, all distinctions made. In the year Renchen, third month, sixth day, the Holy Sovereign descended, and his light shone upon the myriad people.

At that time, the Holy Sovereign issued forth from Qingcheng’s western mountain, emerged from Longnan’s northern clouds, inspected beyond the dragon candle, turned westward to the pass of nine streams, east to the morning fall of Fulin, southward looked upon Zhushan amidst clouds; he rode in the three pure flying chariots, followed by the tiger carriage and myriads of dragons; heavenly light wholly illuminated, divine mirrors observed the three stars. Thereupon he destroyed the wicked, preserved the benevolent and kind amidst water and fire, made those who began to learn the people’s ways immortals’ messengers, and those who attained the Dao immortals’ officers.

If one can thoroughly penetrate the chamber of truth at the Primordial Origin, cultivate the Nine Truths with unceasing diligence, walk the hidden writings of the Seven Spirits, exhaust the uses of the Eight Elements with sincerity, having passed through the three disasters unharmed, surely one will behold the renewal of the Great Peace, and be granted the book of the immortal officer, attaining the divine truth of longevity.

Yet these profound writings and spiritual arts are stored within the palace of Shangqing, the Golden Pavilion; few there are who see the scrolls. The divine truths are taught thrice within seven hundred years. Those who receive the teaching need not be wise or foolish; with pure heart and cultivation, all may attain flying immortality. Yet generally only those bearing the immortal bones of the Mysterious Register, with jade name Fang Zhu, can obtain it. Without such appearance, one will never encounter these writings; even if among millions some err and see them, it is by the mandate of transmission posts, granted with authority, passing through passes to be spiritual messengers, so that that Jia may receive and be entrusted.

Those who possess but do not practice, are under dark teaching thus; immortality seekers should widely visit famous mountains, kneel and pray to the Heavenly Spirit, seek out these mysterious instructions, in hope to obtain treasured secrets, to advance the ranks of immortal officers. Then the Holy Sovereign will again assess their coarse and subtle merits, promote them to fill offices, some ranked as Immortal Elders, some appointed as feudal lords, assisting the holy teaching among the people, managing qi and spreading virtue; some enfeoffed as governors of a city, entrusted with the government of a state.

If they serve the Yu Yi to summon the sun, perform Jie Lin to receive the moon, chant the upper scripture of the great cavern, the seven transformations, the turning scripture, consult the true book of the Golden Pavilion, wear the great talisman of the divine tiger, employ the eight paths to restrain spirits, unfold purple writings to alarm the floating, recite the golden root to endure long, set the nine reds to seal the mound, command the curved element to summon ghosts, employ purple measures to illuminate the origin, drink the five elements to call the soul, draw the Lang jian without ceasing, test the scripture in trials without doubt, tread fire and water without fear — all these shall be ranked as Left and Right Immortal Dukes and Ministers, or as ministers and chancellors, supervisors of the immortal states.

Thus the Holy Sovereign, following the tiger carriage and myriad dragons, surveyed the assembly of immortals, and according to their talents distributed appointments. Though the Sovereign was enfeoffed over the myriad people and looked down upon all living things, he freely roamed the Golden Pavilion of Shangqing, dwelling in the Great Void, journeying the five cities, inspecting the ten heavens, bringing peace to the hundred regions.

Those who see peace may be compassionate and benevolent men, merely keeping to goodness; or Dao-seekers believing in immortals, men fit to be taught; or spiritual men transmitting books and guarding the precious embryo; or those who have attained the Dao and immortality, men of pure sincerity; or those whose names are recorded in the Mysterious Register for seven generations of virtue, whose blessings extend to descendants destined to be immortals; or born with azure bones, connected to spirit and truth; or of great and serene talent, heavenly bestowed and noble. The ranks of immortals number hundreds, high and low. The Sovereign thus appointed them according to talent, as great and small lords, each with his rank, to govern and foster the people.

The lords make annual visitations to Shangqing, to see the Sovereign and receive orders; the Sovereign descends every five years to tour, to inspect the lords and examine the peoples, and to hear immortal governance. The Sovereign’s cultivation of the Dao was full of hardship; he inherited from teachers through suffering and destruction, endured hunger and cold in his own person, trod the hardships of water and fire, wrote private thoughts upon the five relations, repeatedly passed the great tests of the Heavenly Emperor, all with firm rightness of heart and responsibility; death and life were surely appointed; myriad evils could not violate his spirit; thousand demons could not deceive his truth; thus with pure sincerity and profound clarity, spirit and divinity responded in harmony. Therefore the Supreme Sovereign declared his farewell; the Heavenly Venerable granted the Dao.

One may say this is clear and melodious, the mysterious gate opened and spread, noble and surpassing the wonderful, scrutinizing alone and standing; the hidden passes of myriad paths, the heavenly principles issuing widely. This is no longer something that simple letters and ink can transmit; roughly one thousandth is written, simply enumerating the edges, to transmit the bones and match the immortal sons. Those who gain a view have the Mysterious Register book named, and report it to Shangqing, ranked as Immortal Minister. If able to carry out the true affairs of the Golden Pavilion, appointed as Minister, attended by ten jade youths, and served by ten jade maidens of the Golden Pavilion purple texts. Whenever reading and enacting, one should reverently bow and respect, holding incense burning on the sides of the texts. To slight the spiritual record is to become a lower ghost; the three ancestors have examined this. The jade youths and maidens report upwards any violation, hearing the sincerity or wickedness of heart; nothing trivial escapes notice.

Fang Zhu, director of the palace, Qing Tong Jun, opened and composed the Later Holy Daoist Sovereign’s annals, presented above to the Sovereign, transmitted by Qing Tong disciple Wang Yuanyou, to show those whose bones correspond to immortality, to transmit twice in a hundred years, thrice within seven hundred years, to teach the Dao to those who will become immortals.

The Sovereign said: Whoever obtains my annals, all are records of mysterious names and immortal talents, documents to establish the book; or upper golden and jade books of those to become immortals. Whoever has obtained these annals, but only reveres the treasured secret without other cultivation, will be granted dissolution by day. If having obtained it, one does not respect the Dao and virtue, lives a false and worldly life, with nature reversed and will changed, such followers are of base and low talent, not persons of fragrant bones. Yet because they have obtained my annals, they will be named underground masters, to dispel their turbid nature and cleanse their foul spirits. From now on, there shall gradually be steps of advancement, awakening from great delusive dreams. Sons, be diligent and cautious; do not divulge or trust false corpses.

Wearing my annals, entering calamities of pestilence, water, fire, and war, among mountain forests and myriad spirits, thousands of evils and ten thousand disasters, none can harm you. When men see you, all shall be glad. The book has jade youths attending, to cover and protect the person. Wicked men with evil hearts who rashly harm you, I shall ordain the spirits of mountains and rivers to strike down their lives. Do not say the Dao is vast and the spirit mirror secure; I from the Great Void above, from the mysterious emptiness, watch you as one beholds nose and ears. If you do not believe, you may try; if you violate my prohibitions and oaths, see if I cannot discover the unspoken heart and inwardly respond with misfortune and blessing.

Those who receive the book all take solemn oaths for unbroken faith. They send down teachings to bone and fate, to the earnest and sincere students of immortality, sending Ma Ming, Zhang Ling, Yin Sheng, Wang Bao, Mo Di, Sima Jizhu, and the seven true immortals of the Clear and Void Heaven of the grotto terrace, the eight elder sages — altogether twenty-four persons, some named, some hidden, changing surnames and styles, indeed difficult to distinguish. You only need to be pure and sincere in heart, ceaseless day and night; surely you will see these persons; after seeing them, their true names and surnames shall also be revealed to you.

The Later Holy Sovereign commanded Lord Wang to supervise the twenty-four true immortals, to decide the merits of the teachings. The twenty-four true immortals all receive orders from Fang Zhu Qing Tong, and receive those taught by Lord Wang; Lord Wang first reports those who can be accomplished to the twenty-four immortals; the immortals then receive orders and teach. The "Annals of the Sovereign" are entrusted to Lord Wang alone, to select who may be taught, not all immortals transmitting them. The names of the twenty-four immortals are recorded at the end of our "Essential Texts of Qing." These are the appointed teachers of the writings, talismans, and spiritual formulas, enumerated in the scriptures: "Yu Yi Jie Lin," "Great Cavern Mysterious Scripture," "Shangqing Golden Pavilion Spiritual Book Purple Text," "Eight Elements True Scripture," "Tai Shang Hidden Writings Nine Truth Middle Scripture," "Huang Lao Eight Dao Secret Words," "Great Elixir Ten Instructions," "Jade Words Chamber."

The teachings of this scripture are all for the ranks of Left and Right Immortal Dukes and Ministers, Left and Right Ministers and Chancellors. Other scriptures — "Nine Elixir Transformations," "Taiqing Upper Scripture," "Yellow Element Dao Essence," "Qing Lu Tian Guan" — these teachings confer the ranks of True Men, supervisors of true palaces, enfeoffed as immortal state lords and marquises, each with their order and grade, recorded in the white slips and blue registers of Fang Zhu Palace.

The Later Holy Lord Peng Jun named Guangyuan, also Xuanxu, styled Dazhuang and also Zhengyang, Peng also being Li, or named Peng Xian Li Jun, cultivated the Dao. Born in the era of the human sovereigns, he held the position of Taiwei Left True Protector Sovereign, and was also appointed to enfeoff and govern the myriad people, as Li Jun’s Grand Tutor, governing at the Taiwei North Pond Palace upon the Spirit Upper Illumination Terrace. Peng Jun changed his name every two thousand five hundred years, wandering the Great Void, touring the eight infernal regions, ascending to the utmost above and descending to the utmost below; truly rarely did any official see his radiant countenance. Yet the true surnames and styles of his beginnings of study are fully recorded in the Fang Zhu Palace white slips and blue registers.

The Later Holy Li Jun, Supreme Minister of Fang Zhu Palace Qing Tong Jun; the Later Holy Li Jun, Supreme Protector of the Tai Dan Palace, South Pole Original Lord; the Later Holy Li Jun, Supreme Tutor of the White Mountain Palace, Tai Su True Lord; the Later Holy Li Jun, Supreme Governor of the West City Palace, Chief True Lord — these four are the Great Ministers of the Right, and the other ministers, immortal dukes, and officers numbering three hundred and sixty, are all recorded in the white slips and blue registers; their surnames and styles are no longer recorded individually in these annals.

Qing Tong Jun said: Those who have the bone register love immortality; those who love immortality all have the immortal aspiration; those who have immortal aspiration may either desist or persevere. If they desist, the good works of their ancestors are insufficient; if they persevere, the mysterious register and predestined fate are fixed. Some love immortality but are not dedicated, due also to incomplete worldly virtue. Mostly the celestial register is manifest in the mysterious palace, thus the climate diagnoses the figure; the recorded characters manifest in the Great Ultimate, thus the heart and spirit are correct in the cinnabar chamber.

If one is born with the Golden Pavilion jade name, then the eyes have sun rays, the teeth are blue, the blood white; such a person is benevolent and joyful in immortality, bright and distinguished. If the Shangqing has the golden book and jade register, then the back is determined at He Kui, the chest has a reclining bone; such a person is respectful and harmonious, humble to others, with virtue extending even to insects. If the Great Ultimate Palace has cinnabar slips and blue texts, then the hand has complex characters of “people” and “reversal” — such a person is secretive and cautious, loving the true, pure and empty while tolerating faults.

If Fang Zhu has mysterious element purple names, then the eyes have purple light within the four standards, reflecting and inspecting the body; such a person cultivates deep and subtle works, is pure and flourishing, avoiding filth. If Taiqing has jade registers and crimson names, then the voice has jade sound and golden ring, the mouth square and eyes round; such a person is magnanimous and widely loving, regards others as injured. If Tai Su has jade slips and golden names, then the white intentions are seen in the abdomen, the mouth emits purple breath; such a person is merciful and spiritually connected, secretly benevolent and humble to the many.

If the South Pole has cinnabar writings and purple register, then the head produces five qi, connects above to the clouds of the multi-storied tower; such a person is harmonious and benevolent, loves the poor, relieves disaster and aids the distressed. If the Dipper has mysterious jade green registers, then the heart has nine orifices, the lungs adorned with brocade patterns, below the jaw a jade pellet, the eyes with green veins, the eyebrows and corners with over a thousand pairs of orderly patterns like city walls and borders, the temples bald and bare spots, the bright hall even and white; a thousand patterns form the thoroughfare of true passage, broad spots are the dwelling of spirit reception; such a person is compassionate to the poor and humble, benevolent even to wild beasts.

If the Mysterious Palace Primordial Origin has blue, gold, and red writings, then the cinnabar heart has purple orifices, yellow blossoms surround the stomach, fragrant breath in the mouth, teeth dripping jade fluid; such a person slightly delights in viewing the flowing clouds of sun and moon, loves the light images of stars, has pure essence and firm bones, sincere and probing into mysteries. If the Mysterious Capital Cinnabar Terrace has white jade and golden characters, then the blue liver has purple mesh, the granary and kidney embroidered with patterns, the mysterious chest full of essence, form flourishing and spirit pure, body fragrant and soft, blood clear and qi moist; such a person indulges in preserving the profound and distant, tastes the essence of spirit, delights in benefitting others, rescues and relieves distress.

If the Three Primordial Officials have brilliant slips and blue writings, then the purple brain and brocade tongue, mysterious will at temples, green intestines and red marrow, square sky and round forehead, yin side has hidden bones, soft hair purple and glossy, orifices threefold open, conduct somewhat restrained, eyes have flowing light, blue essence congealed, palm patterns four-reaching, teeth three-pointed; such a person is spiritual of heart, benevolent and humble, compassionate and sensitive, loving subtle reverence and faith, delights in the forest and spring, loves clear flowing water, cherishes and moves with mountains and rivers, wishes to cast his name to the humble, guards the spirit and nourishes the soul, aspires to soar to azure peace, tastes the remote heavenly immortal. Those who have such appearances are surely upper immortals. They may also learn and obtain, or obtain without learning; the essential is that the person must love the Dao, love the subtle learning of the Dao, and surely quickly attain ascent and transformation.

Next, the nose has a mysterious mountain. The mysterious mountain is a black mark upon the nose. Also the abdomen should have a mysterious mound, corresponding to the mysterious mountain. The mysterious mound is also a black mark. If either is absent, the immortal appearance is incomplete. If the mouth is foul and the nature endures filth, the appearances of mysterious mountain and mound are destroyed.

Next, blue bones. Those with blue bones delight in the fragrance of five spices, and love to learn of divine and spiritual matters. Next, their gait is like that of a swan, their neck bears a jade pillow, behind the ears lies the morning, under the flanks blue marks, the body has net-like patterns, and the heart is true, the gallbladder calm, the ears firm and qi broad — these are the secondary signs of immortality.

The Mysterious Continent also has golden carved name registers; those who do not learn yet obtain dissolution by day are masters of this; if they learn, they become immortals who freely release by day.

Next, the Tai Mountain Three Officials’ mansion is the place of birth, the land of escape from death; such persons’ souls and destinies do not end in death, but roam boundlessly; hence those who learn the Dao of immortality may become immortals walking the earth. Once every thirty years they change place and name, and have no term of death.

For this reason, the Tai Mountain Three Officials’ mysterious register white book does not note a place of death; it is not the Three Officials’ mistaken notation of a place of death. The Taiyin records death and life, with black register and white ledger, red cinnabar slips, recording the sequence of births and deaths, also comparing their numbers in order. Having six thousand slips, each person is noted with no place of death; such persons mostly have longevity and are hard to die, living beyond a hundred years; when death comes it is sudden and without pain or illness. If combined with learning the Dao of immortality, they nearly attain completion and can be taught.

Yet such persons’ natures are mostly gentle and mild, loving affairs of subtlety; all are signs of immortality.

Next, firm resolve to the Dao, pure and upright intention; some widely practice secret virtue, aid the poor and relieve distress, bestow kindness on kinsfolk and the poor, bury dried bones; their virtue surpasses ancient men, chaste, peaceful, sincere, gentle, respectful, humble, neither licentious nor thieving. Some have ancestors who bestowed grace, establishing merit generation after generation, with virtue in the Three Officials. Having established three hundred good deeds, by thus learning the Dao they all may attain immortality.

If the heart is correct, heaven and earth cannot disobey; if the spirit is firm, ghosts and spirits cannot oppose; if the soul is bright, myriad evils cannot invade; if the spirit body is white, ten thousand demons cannot interfere; if the essence is pure, licentious corpses cannot mount; if the fluids are abundant, the three worms cannot trouble; if the blood is congealed, turbid qi cannot scatter.

Therefore, those who learn the Dao, with true heart steady spirit, sharpen the spirit body and embrace the soul, restrain the thousand evils in the eight wilderness prisons, lock the ten thousand demons at the nine extremities, with pure sincerity preserve the true unity in the primordial beginning, eagerly and constantly desire to rise on wings to fly as immortals, the vermilion spirit at ease in the crimson dwelling, the five treasures guarding the clear mystery, walking trials and observing without faltering, dwelling amid honor and disgrace without shifting, facing south without turning back, forsaking ten thousand gold without regret, delighting in cold and hardship, loving calm fasting in hills and mountains, guarding the sincere heart without weariness — thus may one be said to be a man who learns the Dao.

If one lacks these appearances and these deeds, though a hero of lofty rank, aspiring to swallow the four seas, with broad spirit and lofty melody soaring to the clouds, profound and bright, skilled in flying brush and eloquent speech, elegant and outstanding, understanding the hidden and resolving the stagnant, speaking of emptiness and nothing while gazing over the eight directions — such a one is surely not of immortal talent, and is said to labor in vain through the years, without understanding or attainment.
