Chapter of Movements and Signs, First

Poem of Astonished Green Splendour

The sacred mountain thrusts up to the clouds, its flying peaks towering a thousand fathoms. Vast emptiness enfolds the spirit-valley, the jade woods flourish, bleak and dense. This one character is inked thickly and obscurely, no longer legible; from its centre a stroke projects downward, resembling the character for "sheep," its name being Quan. Born marked by beauty and grace, at the age of twenty he flowed with clear sounds. His dwelling is solemn wisdom’s ferry, transcending form and image in the forest of Wei. He waves his colours within the vermilion gates, harbouring a heart surpassing the common. I and the Master’s lineage share the same source and abyssal pool. The grand progeny divides the upper work, each now a separate branch. Orchids and gold are dear for wearing, thrice increased to feel richer yet. In quiet seeking, I rejoice in this meeting, refined and gathered, lengthening the years of sacrifice. Who says the hidden mirror is hard to find? One gains it wrapped within the heart’s measure. Lofty thoughts beyond the prison bars, all are men of mountain and rock. Do not let wings soar into the void, lest startled winds rise beneath. Though transformation is by man’s will, the prolific sheep is not easily matched. What hope is there in morning splendour, at year’s end towards my son.

Astonished Green Splendour professes itself to be a man of the Southern Mountain—what mountain, none knows. A woman about twenty years old, dressed in blue above and below, with perfect colour, descended on the night of the tenth day of the eleventh month of the third year of Shengping. Cutting away these two characters, it should be the character for sheep and Quan. Thenceforth she came and went, six times within a month. The surname is Yun, but cutting away one character leaves only the character for Astonishment. The given character was originally Quan, altered by later generations to Astonishment. The poem is one piece, with a gift of a fire-washed cloth handkerchief, and one strip each of gold and jade. The strips are precious and rare. The goddess said: this was originally the grass form of the character Quan, later altered by people to the character Jian, with an additional stroke above. Beware not to divulge me, lest both sides suffer punishment. Inquiry of this person reveals she is Luo Yu, a Daoist maiden of Jiuyi Mountain. In the former fate, she was a master’s wife, poisoning a nursing woman; the black penalty in the mysterious realm remained unexpired, thus she is now banished to foul and turbid places to repay her fault. Together with this Quan, also written in grass script, it resembles the former form but is not altered. The elixir for the corpse’s release is now on the Xiangdong mountain, suspended there one inch. This woman is already nine hundred years old. Hence this should be the descent of Yang Quan; the character Quan is the Daoist name of the carriage, and the youngest son of Chen; later he was Huangmen Lang of Jin Jianwen, hence Xin also cultivated the Daoist practice and diet. This is what was written by Master Yang; being of the same surname, one may question Yang Quan, who replied regarding the matter. According to records, the third year of Shengping was the year Jiwei, six years before Yichou, at which time the various Perfected had not yet descended.

On the right, three strips in cursive of Master Yang on paper.

The Lady of the Southern Mountain and disciples say: the script reads as on the left; the disciple is Master Yang himself. These Perfected appear to have gathered at the Cave Palace, so the Director of Destinies is foremost, being the host. The lady explained to Yang the order and titles as such; not when Yang descended.

The Perfected Lord of the Eastern Mountain, Minister of the Director of Destinies.

The Eastern Palace Nine Microcosmic Perfected, Minister of the Golden Palace, Prime Minister, the Lord Qingtong.

Right Immortal Lord of Penglai, Jia Bao’an, from Zheng; thereafter all are called by the names of the Perfected, not their personal names; their clans are likewise recorded in the worldly Daoist books and traditions. The Heavenly King’s son of Qingxu is of small rank. Qingtong is highly honoured; therefore none dare to utter his tabooed name. This Qingxu is master of the Southern Mountain, also called by his name, but his secret Director of Destinies name is not revealed, which is also difficult to explain.

Tongbai Perfected, Right Assistant King, Lord of the Five Mountains, attendant to the Emperor Chen, Prince Qiao.

Qinggai Perfected attendant to Emperor Chen Guo Shigan, from Wei.

Taihe Perfected Shan Shiyuan.

Twenty-three Perfected on the right sitting westward, rising facing south-east. This is proper ritual, facing south, taking west as upper, then the female Perfected facing east would rise south, but now facing north, likely to be near the high Perfected.

Ziwei Left Palace Queen Lady.

Canglang Yunlin Right Heroic Lady. The right hero is Ziwei’s elder sister; now reversed in position, indicating ranks rise and fall.

Upper Perfected Director of Destinies Southern Mountain Lady. This is Lady Wei herself; she states thus and does not give her surname.

Eight Spirits Dao Mother Western Mountain Lady Jiang. Some have multiple titles, usually the more numerous the higher rank. The Western Queen Mother is called Nine Spirits; thus Eight Spirits should precede Seven Spirits, but now they appear reversed, which remains unexplained. Also reading the Huangting affairs shows the Northern Mountain Lady Jiang differs from the present.

Fifteen female Perfected on the right facing east sitting, starting north moving south. Though month and day are not recorded when discussing these matters, since these are the names and ranks of Perfected, they are placed foremost. Later Perfected ranks mentioned earlier are high, which are like the modern-day honorary titles.

On the night of June twenty-first, the Recording Officer asked: Prefect Xu, what do you intend to seek in the Dao? Deng replied: Diligently cultivate true sincerity. The Recording Officer further said: There were in former times Zhao Shutai and Wang Shiqing, who also spoke of earnest study, yet were found wanting, and were led by the Northern Bright Duke's mansion. This was in the year Yichou, June. Before this, only June fifteenth is recorded. The Recording Officer entrusted this reply to Prefect Xu in a book, discussing matters in Maoshan. Before this there was another entrustment, date unrecorded, also in the fourth roll; no earlier ones exist. The Northern Bright Duke's mansion is an official under Fengdu Palace. Formerly, Tianku Tianjin, Cai Hua Chiqiu, at that time the sound, spirit, and spiritual sleeves were covered with dust and splendour; this corresponds to the initial descent of Huaqiao, the character being a lesser reliance person. The brilliance shines from Xiushan, high praising the cloud extension, proclaiming itself the resonant sound stirred; everywhere it opens, being washed by spiritual waves, truly hoping to prosper with things. Though unable to expand its business or arrange nets, wandering peaks chasing escapes, only then did it realise the moment of insight, responding to the few in the mystery; thus Buddhist sounds not riding but spinning, resting at Getai. The mystic blade has no kin; flowing reflections escape the true, as if a cloud wall moving, imagining Qi alone surpasses, bending down to open and scatter, moving responding to subtle escapes; only then do we all have admiration. Formerly meeting with Kuangyi, intimate friendship was firm. A writing says: Inspecting the sage’s records, events profound and subtle, golden copies set, azure records of mystery fixed; then stepping beyond dust and vulgarity, roaming freely at Ziyang; how desolate and pure, how obscure and precious! If able, pray lend it for analogy. Also says: The steps of the Dao, rigorous in spirits, calm oneself with true rest, wash sincerity to seek restraint; thus spoken, the Dao is near, yet night inquiries require earnest management, then later to link hands and bind the heaven’s thread, able to float the spirit’s web, mind roaming vast space, eyes seeing the cave chamber, without long delay. If the five emotions err and the three souls fly beyond, then the three Perfected dance with swords, the Yellow Gate swiftly closes; can you not strive? Can you not strive?

On the night of June twenty-second, the cock crows, a message of instruction, this is the decree of Ziyang.

Two writings have been made by the Prefect.

The Clear Spirit Perfected speaks of the "Precious Spirit Scripture," copying the practices of cultivation, appearing in the third roll, not repeated here.

The Ziwei Lady’s message as on the left. The matter is also in the third roll.

In the third year of Xingning, the year Yichou, on the night of June twenty-third, this instruction was given. Previously, the Dao was discussed: many persons have dull ears and eyes, desiring to petition for this method; that very night, one descended, which was the appearance of the instruction. This is Master Yang’s own record. The Prefect is about sixty years old, with failing ears and eyes, hence the inquiry; Yang did not wish to rebuke and entrusted this to others.

Also said: Some Daoists have heavy ears, speaking of the yellow and red qi disturbing the measures, to be cautious. This is likely a caution to the Prefect.

The Clear Spirit Perfected speaks one sentence.

The Perfected says: combing the hair, desiring excessive abundance, leads to flowing blood qi and dispersing wind-dampness. Change combs frequently and use alternately; this is also possible without cutting hair.

The Ziwei Lady speaks one sentence.

That night, the first descent entered the door without sitting, speaking: "This night the waves sounded like thunder." The disciple asked the cause, answered: just now came the great waves in the Eastern Sea. The disciple is Master Yang himself.

The Southern Mountain Lady speaks.

Also said: "Do you detest blood?" Answer: "Indeed I detest it." She said: "Blood lies on the path; if you detest it, how can you travel?" The answer: "One should avoid it." Further said: "Avoidance is best; better still is not to see it."

The Southern Mountain Lady speaks.

From this time onwards the Perfected converse with one another.

Also said: The "Precious Spirit Scripture" is in the embroidered pouch of Pei Qingling, commonly carried by attendants. Pei formerly received this book from the Ziwei Lady; I also have it, all written thus in the Western Palace’s fixed copy.

Inquiring the location of the Western Palace, the answer was: It is the northern altar of the Mysterious Garden, the upper terrace of the Western Jade; all celestial true treasures are contained therein.

The Southern Mountain Lady speaks.

Pei Perfected further said: this book is of the same generation as the "Hidden Book," essential matters and readily useful; also called the "Seven Profound Hidden Book." The two gentlemen gave it on the second day.

The Southern Mountain Lady reported: Ziwei Left Lady Wang, named Qing’e, styled Yuyi, the twentieth daughter of the Mother, guardian of the Yuye Xuanlong Mountain, presides over the teaching of those who may become Perfected.

One earlier night’s entrustment. These lines are the same as those given on the night of the twenty-second with Ziyang; on that same night there was a great response and other matters; later the voice and breath descend, also this night; Master Yang later recalled this matter, further detailed in the twenty-second’s record; hence termed the earlier night.

From Clear Spirit coming, twelve lines in all, written by the Prefect.

On the night of June twenty-fourth, the Ziwei King’s Lady descended, then descended to earth asking: The true spirit having descended into the impure mortal, yet hands and feet have not yet inscribed any text; thus it must be low and high and remote, not to be seen openly; dare I consult here, hoping for instruction in ignorance. The lady then ordered to sit again, and instruction appeared. Now written this to answer: this is Master Yang’s own account, usually so. The body sinks into the mysterious void, no trace to seek; words issue from empty air, no object to release; wandering, riding on the sudden, transforming and escaping without delay. These two acts float and sink in darkness, trembling and solitude; therefore roaming without ferry, assigned to drum the wind and drag; preserved in the empty boat and moving only. Thus truth in the midst is emptiness, emptiness in the midst has form, form in the midst has no image. As to the nearer instruction on writing, waving shapes of paper slips, the text and logic are brilliant and clear; roughly good in outer appearance, mysterious brushwork upright and shining; the form reveals substance, silent and adorned, passing on the impure dust; if perchance exposing corporeal things, and advancing with the world, it taints the ode of the transcendent true below, damages the prohibitions of separation above, also things not practised by us, nor permitted by spiritual law. Now I present this as the origin of the writing; the composition having just begun, this is the five colours first budding, the time for the formation of letters and painting, the elegant meeting of the people, the distinction of yin and yang. Thus there are three origins, eight meetings, and the multitudes of regions flying to heaven; also eight dragons’ cloud script and splendid light chapters. Thereafter, in the age of the two emperors, the eight meetings’ script was developed, becoming the chapters of dragons and phoenixes, restricting and refining the cloud script to follow the forms of Sanskrit writings, dividing and breaking into two ways, the earth truth following the easy, paired with separate branches, thus becoming the sixty-four kinds of script, spreading throughout the thirty-six heavens, ten directions, up and down; each taking their chapters and classes, differing in use, the phonetics uniform yet the traces separate. Examined and discussed, the eight meetings’ script is the utmost truth of writing, the progenitor of literary style, cloud script and splendid light being its root source and origin, the script from which all began. Now the three origins and eight meetings script is used by the Supreme Emperor, Great Ultimate, High Perfected, and Pure Immortal; the cloud script and splendid light chapters are the characters of the spirit talisman script now seen. Then came the age of Hua Ji, creating disorderly truths, jointly composing clever endings, deviating to lower writings, all flowing with corrupt texts, licentious and perverse characters, abandoning the root and imitating the false, a clamor of filth and death at the border. How would true immortals forsake the root and mastery of writing, hand-painting licentious and chaotic lower characters? A true Perfected obtains all truth in every matter; why alone keep in the ordinary ends the hall and guard, the licentious and floating corruptions, and guard them without change, play with them without moving? The lady in the world first had those who could write and do well; upon becoming true immortals, the changes in outer writing also suddenly followed the person and reflected themselves. True matters are near and not discarded; now having obtained the impure writings, again learning the upper texts, then more deeply knowing the true writings. The way of ghosts too; but the writing has slight deviations. Also by spirit brush, true hand, at first did not dare descend to mortal exchanges, though sometimes there are those attaining the Dao, their bodies not yet transcending the world, thus did not dare lay out writings and ink, to display in the nearer characters. But the talisman texts and divine adornments, the sought and worn, have newly come and made, thus it is so. The world cannot comprehend the thread’s start, and so we do not conceal it, but in darkness mutually interpret and understand, inward and outward mutually related. Also the "Four Extremes Bright Sections," the highest and strict prohibitions, also do not heed us, again becoming the common writings of the world. Since I have begun writing, you certainly will not understand; what use then? Both are troublesome. This too must obscure whether fitting or not, hardly to be blamed, imagining a slight ease of heart, altogether not of the writing’s kind.

The Upper Perfected Director of Destinies Southern Mountain Lady granted, now written as follows:

Lofty tossing clouds cast down the reins, gathering the reins through the vast empty air; hands grasp the heavenly cords, feet step the jade courtyard; the body ascends the imperial gate, donning precious azure coverings; above discoursing on the escape of the Nine Profounds, below recording the great life of myriad springs; thus the dazzling lightning stands solemn, a thousand clouds shining bright; true words profound waves, high talks of jade purity; urging the flow of the scarlet lips, guiding the sun’s qi in trickling drops; thereupon spitting flames to repel smoke, plucking gold to play jade; phoenix sounds flourishing, phoenix songs harmonious. If only responding to scenes below, revolving, returning to spirit dust, sharing the chariot’s tired universe; wandering Buddhas attending market, coming to form true talents, instructing my disciples; then jade chimes fall, gems and bells subdued within; eyes see five impurities, the vast faults of the chamber; the spirit labours in odours and fishy reek, filling nose and gathering breath; then closing orchid sounds in the central China origin, withdrawing from the coarse gold sounds, inferior and faint, and issuing forth. The spirit is subtle in the near; a myriad li must meet; rare rhymes though touched, piling without hindrance; thus the truth divided, heard afar, the Dao high and remote; a jade unpolished does not spread bright, yet yields lowly keen perception. Now you have the utmost awakening of heart, will bring forth suspicion and doubt; outwardly viewing the common vulgar’s reply, inwardly holding hesitation and insight. Not managing matters rightly, already exceeding; hoping the Dao of your endeavour, examining the exquisite taste; Dao’s subtlety once obtained, high and low sounds assuredly clear. This is not the matter of planning; you add too much care, scattering these thoughts; be cautious only.

Three writings on the right by Yang.

On the night of June twenty-fourth, the Southern Mountain Lady appeared, ordering this writing. Before, on the evening of the twenty-second, in another chamber there was a joint discussion of the Dao; the voices and sounds of the Ziwei and Southern Mountain Ladies were distinct, below not understanding the subtlety; thus now the writing was given to answer the doubts common in discussion. At first arrival, appearance and breath were unsettled; upon completion, the disciple only felt the colour uneven; no other words to speak. This one line is also Master Yang’s own record.

The Southern Mountain Lady spoke to disciples that evening: "Tomorrow I shall proceed to the Qiongwushan Clear Void Palace, so that you may know where I go."

That evening further said: "On the western head of Tongbai Mountain near the sea, about two hundred zhang collapsed."

The Ziwei King’s Lady said: "How can the thoughts and cares of men be truly exact? Need there not be matters to answer their hearts?" The Southern Mountain Lady said: "It is but a jest; wishing to establish firmness and clarity."

In the third year of Xingning, the year Yichou, on the night of June twenty-fifth, this is the beginning of the descent of Consort An; recorded separately as one roll, thus a new year and era title begins. The Ziwei King’s Lady descended again, bringing another goddess with her. The goddess wore cloud-patterned brocade, red above and blue below, brilliant and shining, with a green embroidered belt about her waist, the belt jingling over ten small bells, bells of blue and yellow intermingled; on the left belt a jade pendant, like worldly pendants but smaller; attire fluttering, glowing and brightening the room as if sunlight reflecting on mica; her hair is the style called zhen, meaning black hair; the brows are arranged exquisitely, the hair coiled at the crown, with loose strands hanging to the waist; pointing to a gold ring, white beads encircling the arm; looking about thirteen or fourteen years old. Two maidservants stood beside her; one dressed in red, with a blue embroidered pouch, holding a brocade pouch about a foot or so long, containing about ten scrolls, the pouch closed with a white jade toggle, inscribed with the words "Jade Pure Spirit Tiger Inner True Purple Origin Elixir Chapter"; the other maidservant in blue, holding a white box bound with a red ribbon, the box resembling ivory; the two maidservants about seventeen or eighteen years old, neat and exceptional in appearance. The goddess and attendants’ faces are bright and clear, fresh as jade, with fragrance of five spices, like burning incense of a fragrant infant; the fragrant infant means infant incense, from foreign lands. At the first arrival, entering the door, she followed behind the Ziwei Lady. When the lady first entered, she again announced: "Tonight there is a noble guest coming, to discuss good matters." Thereupon I rose. The Lady said: "No need to rise; simply sit together and bow to each other." The Lady sat facing south, I that evening first sat beneath the bed facing west, the goddess then came and sat on the same bed facing east, both saluting with the left hand. After saluting, the Ziwei Lady said: "This is the young girl of the Supreme Void Upper Perfected Yu Lord Li Lady. The Supreme Void Lord formerly sent her to the Turtle Mountain to learn the Shangqing Dao; upon completion of the Dao she received the Supreme Writ, appointed as the Zi Qing Upper Palace Jiuhua True Consort. Thereupon surnamed An, named Yu Pin, styled Lingxiao." The Ziwei Lady further asked me: "Have you ever seen such a person in the world?" I replied: "Her sacred bearing is lofty and elegant, beyond description." The Lady laughed heartily and said: "How then?" I did not answer again. The Jiuhua True Consort sat long in silence, speaking not; in her hand she first held three jujubes, dry and large, without stones, not like jujubes in taste but resembling pears. She first gave me one, then one to the Ziwei Lady, keeping one for herself, bidding each to eat. After eating, after a short time, the true consort asked my age and month of birth; I replied thirty-six, born in the ninth month of the Gengyin year. The True Consort further said: "Your Master, the Southern Perfected Lady, the Director of Destinies, holds authority, the Dao high and wondrously complete, truly the root of good virtue. I have long heard your virtuous words; unexpectedly today we have the fortunate cause to rejoice; may in the assembly of the dark fate there ever be the binding of pine and fern." I then gave my name and replied: "Sinking and immersed in the vulgar, dust taints my substance; high and low are distant and remote; lacking affinity and reverence, I dare to be deficient in spiritual descent; joyfully dancing without limit; only by your instruction may darkness be dispelled, assisting my original, my ancient wish." The True Consort said: "Let your words have no disguise of modesty; modest words are not fitting." After a while, the True Consort said: "I wish to write a paper to present, then you may wield the brush to express my humble thoughts; will you agree?" I answered: "I obey your command." Then folding paper and dyeing the brush, I spoke aloud and received the teaching, composing this poem:

The cloud gates build upon firm emptiness, the jade terraces tower and flourish. The purple palace rides the green radiance, the spirit observatory is grand and high. Within the Langxuan vermilion chambers, virtue shines like crimson clouds. Bowing down to cleanse at the cloud vessel ferry, raising up to pluck the green apple blossoms. Washing feet in the jade heavenly pool, drumming oars at the Cowherd River. Then urging the scenery clouds to ride, lowering dragon reins at the mysterious pass. Shaking garments at the border of dust and filth, folding robes stepping the turbid waves. Wish to bind with mountain and marsh, firm and gentle, harmonious and compliant. Together carrying double purity within, the upper true Dao is not mistaken. The Ziwei assembly of good counsel, singing acceptance and enjoying great blessings.

When finished writing, I looked and thus said: "Now I present this as a gift, to declare my sincere heart; do not say otherwise. If there is some misunderstanding in your mind, there will be subtle inquiries."

The Ziwei Lady said: "I again compose a paper to inform you, to show good matters." I again folded paper and dyed brush, the Lady gave this poem: Two images within and without the pond, mysterious qi truly divided within. The dark assembly does not await the carriage; the precious is truly attained. Southern Mountain cast bright gold, obscurely observing the book binding. Clouds of red light shine, thus moving the spiritual heavens’ men. Riding the gale, sharing covers and bedding, evenly tethered with red clouds. Pondering and sighing at the meeting of heaven and man, fate is within the numbers. The upper Dao is true and not mistaken; the turbid pond is not heard of. The eyes see all in constant phenomena; singing high praise for your cause.

After writing, the Ziwei Lady took it and said: "I present this to you; now I am the master of the cause and the adviser of the singing intention." The Ziwei Lady further said: "Tomorrow the Southern Mountain Lady will return; I shall with the consort together welcome her at the Yun Tao hall. If she does not return tomorrow, then it is again a matter of several days."

After a while, the Ziwei Lady said: "I depart now; tomorrow I shall again come with the True Consort to you." Rising and leaving the bed, she lost her place. The True Consort remained a little behind and said: "The dark feelings are not settled, the intentions and breath not forgotten; I imagine you taste it together; tomorrow I shall return." Then taking my hand and holding it, she descended from the bed and vanished before leaving the door.

On the evening of June twenty-sixth, the multitudes of Perfected came and issued this petition:

Ziwei King’s Lady,

Zi Qing Upper Palace Jiuhua True Consort,

Upper Perfected Director of Destinies Southern Mountain Lady Master, all former names marked “certain” are Master Yang’s pseudonyms.

Ziyang Perfected,

Maoshan Lord,

Clear Spirit Perfected,

Maoshan Junior Lord.

Also came a very young person, neat and proper, wearing a lotus crown, dressed in red with a sword, never before seen; thought to be Tongbai Mountain Perfected Prince Qiao, speaking much of Jin Ting Mountain matters, many words not understood; respectfully saluting Ziwei, Zi Qing, Southern Perfected three female Perfected, others saying simply so; this is Tongbai Mountain Perfected Prince Qiao, but did not speak with me. At the beginning and end, Perfected came to descend, but never spoke with me.

They sat long; the Jiuhua True Consort said: "I wish again to trouble the master’s handwriting, to write one matter to scatter meaning and forget words; is it permitted?" I folded paper to receive; the True Consort then slowly and softly spoke and gave: "I am the young girl of the Origin Lord, the son of Lady Tai Xu Li. Formerly first learning the Dao at Guizhou, receiving the Jade Chapter at the High Palace, bearing the Tiger Record at Zi Huang, holding the jade iron at the Heavenly Emperor, receiving writings from the Upper Perfected Consort, to wander the Jade Pure. Often opening nine nets by hand, treading on the mysterious chamber, spirit shape and spiritual void, drinking sun essence, entering the feast of the Seven Palaces, exiting the carriage and clouds, gathering the three stars and ascending together, scattering radiant clouds to fly the carriage. Not unable to choose the upper chamber, searching for the Qingtong, seeking the good companions of the royal palace, meeting high spirits as pairs, drawing the mysterious and strange, friendly with the Imperial Lords; this is my judgement and appointment. Responding and passing through the numbers, bowing to the scenery dust, participating with dragons descending swiftly, inviting the dark to seek the mighty, pursuing matching parties. By fate and former life together, then having the ink meeting to fix names, white contracts and jade villages, equal rationality of two celebrations, travelling with wild geese, gourds dividing flavours, incense rising, robes binding, looking back at the companions’ work, inwardly storing the true methods. Drawing this forward, already fixed the fate tablets of the dark, blue writings of the upper origins; thus the kind heart is already equal; the liking for the scenery is already bounded; obtaining the wish and roaming, joy joined with former will; is it not dark and natural? This again is the two images’ great root, matching the inner and outer duties. Truly not to be changed or reversed, binding feelings with empty blades, spiritual knives of seven layers, leaving the trust of the Great Beginning, preserving truth and opening jade; this is called the single scenery of the eight emptinesses. Elegance and silence, clear and high, gathering and flowing to the skies, making phoenixes sing on cloud roads, dragons roar and tigers howl, heavenly sovereigns’ twin scenery, ascending to the star tower; flying stars cast light, sun and moon illuminate the body, mouth emits dark smoke, eyes flash lightning, sleeping above in the jade chamber, flowing and moving in jade purity, hands grasp scenery clouds, feet step the golden court. From that time, at the moment of attaining the Dao, one should surely complete inside and outside, reason like gold and stone, feelings intertwined as pairs, united in the curtain and canopy; must embrace the quilt firmly, have light middle connections; the seven spirits of the dust and filth, sorrowful souls entrusted to the spirits. This is the lady seeking lineage from the wise lord, not for evil. Now can be called fulfilling the true heart; feelings already as one; now should join together, harness the jade void carriage, pairwise walk this mystery, together gather red fruit in the jade garden, also gather cinnabar flowers in the Lang Garden, share drinks in the purple river water, equally wash at the shore of the blue river, purple flowered fur cloak, sun crown lotus crown, roaming the Shangqing, all attend the Three Origins, eight scenes emerge, phoenix door and cloud gate, bowing and washing golden marrow, chanting jade mystery, floating in the void lying late, great meeting of the morning star, four weights singing clear, incense mother playing smoke, all together observing, carrying and wearing the crossed skirts; is it not joyful? Is it not fulfilling? O worthy lord, follow the fate and join the assembly; I shall not refuse; yet also cannot turn back from the truth to the dark; if only to let the heart and mind be. After finishing, again looking at and speaking: "Now with this writing to present to you, may it clear your lingering doubts." Having spoken, she smiled. After a while, the Ziwei Lady said: "The true consort’s words are complete, the cause of liking is attached; you shall not again have any more to accept; the mysterious fate and dark division make it so." The Southern Mountain Lady saw the writing and said: "The dark fated numbers respond, the mysterious fate mutually fits, the appointed division comes to visit; newly constructed cause; this carries the true good matter; thus displaying the name of pairs, fixing inner and outer duties only; no need to follow the world’s corrupt and foul, nor to act licentiously with the lower characters. The pair spirit consort meets the scenery, marrying the noble true young girl; your intimate intercourse will greatly profit advancement, without harm or severance worries. A thousand spirits then may be made to test and see, no longer to present. The true banner surely will prevail; the cloud farming surely can be together mounted. I once constructed this meaning for you due to the Ziwei Lady, now fulfilled as wished, further making me joyful; be cautious and no longer doubt in heart." I yesterday saw Lady Jintai Li in the Clear Void, saying you yet have doubts and correct mind; your breath is slightly restless, should act the character "liang," you opposed this move, misled people not a little. The true consort has the divine tiger inner true cinnabar blue jade text, not for those who possess it; excellent talents seek to write; thus should not conceal. Today together, what matter but letters alone; surely must ride the scenery king’s clouds. If some are not yet enlightened, it is appropriate to inquire subtly if fitting. The True Consort saw the lady’s writing and laughed, saying: "Hand in hand on twin terraces, joyous in the good meeting, the light carriage sharing the machine, all together thus." 

The first roll of True Admonitions ends.

Chapter of Movements and Signs, Second

The Clear Void Perfected grants writing: The Way of Yellow and Red, the method of mixing qi, is the instruction received and spread by Zhang Ling, one of the seed arts; it is not the matter of the Perfected. I have often seen those practising this perish without progeny; never have I seen those planting this achieve life. Among millions, none escape examination and punishment; among tens of millions, only one mistakenly obtains it, and that one attains immortality. Zhang Ling took this to teach the world. Ling’s transformations no longer practise this; be cautious in speaking of the lower path of turbid life, the true qi of the pure sky; thoughts of lust, holding hearts with colour and view, yet also practising the highest way, only reveals the three officials’ examination and punishment; what is called embracing jade and going into fire, burying a dog in a golden coffin. The colour and view are the yellow and red; the upper way is the Hidden Book; men find it hard to understand, even to this extent.

Ziwei Lady grants writing: The yellow book and red border, though secret essentials of long life, are truly lower arts of life; not the utterances of the upper palace heavenly true ones riding the clouds. This way belongs only to nurture and division of life, not the upper way. One who harbours lustful qi and also practises the Hidden Book only grips the water official’s pen, sounds the drum of the three officials; the mysterious and noble cannot be served, the release and thanks cannot be relied upon. To sum up: to be pure then spirit descends, to be devoted then divine servants.

The Perfected’s pair of scenes values most the preservation of matching pairs, love lying in the two scenes; though named husband and wife, they do not enact the marks of husband and wife; this is a nominal name to show hearing and seeing only. If yellow and red remain in the chest, the Perfected cannot be seen, spirits cannot be approached; only laboriously pursuing affairs, and also labouring under the three officials. At cockcrow time, the Southern Mountain Lady grants writing: Since the cock has crowed, the cause of liking is firm.

Ziyang Perfected grants writing: The Supreme Void is far and lofty, high and low equally connected; the meaning of wise virtue is set in the mysterious fate; be cautious of the doubt of yellow and red.

Maoshan Lord grants writing: The mysterious standard touches the scene, bending to the dust haze; jade vibrates the faults of the chamber; clear wind swiftly moves; may one not strive.

Having spoken, the Perfected depart; the True Consort remains a little, saying: "Again I trouble the master for one phrase." Then grants writing:

Forget the radiance of the orchid and grass, the heart aligned and fitting; frequently intimate, reverent, and pure; virtue and flowing scene combined. Let joy gather, reason open, lead the elegant to submit to bright clarity. You are lofty and noble, spirit shines; though delayed, forget the lowly. Having spoken, she took hands and descended, disappearing before the door.

On the night of June twenty-sixth, eight Perfected descended:

Ziwei Left Lady one.

Zi Qing Upper Palace Jiuhua True Consort two.

Upper Perfected Director of Destinies Southern Mountain Lady three.

Ziyang Perfected four.

Clear Spirit Perfected five.

Maoshan Lord six.

Maoshan Junior Lord seven.

Also one very young, neat, wearing lotus crown, red robe and sword, never before seen; suspected to be Tongbai Mountain Perfected Prince Qiao, speaking much of Jin Ting Mountain matters, many words not understood; respectfully saluting Ziwei Upper True Jiuhua Consort; all bowed and called themselves humble servants. This line repeats with slight differences; previously recorded as Master Yang’s own record of Jiuhua’s descent; hidden without display; after this more detailed explanation of the Prefect’s matters to show the Prefect, hence this piece has two versions.

The Upper Perfected said: Yesterday with Uncle Shen went to Clear Void Palace, examining the gains and losses of Perfected; recently dismissed forty-seven persons, again raised three; also checked your names and tablets; now excellent, so Xu may reside in Bozha. Xu is the name of the Prefect; Yang wrote the commentary, so the name is not recorded.

At first I did not understand how this could be so good; mind washed and flowing, doctrine focused, heart and intention exhausted, as if treading water and fire. If long thus, even the Perfected cannot escape, nor can the immortal way hide; only must cut off lustful thoughts; then we can see and show this, explaining to Xu. This is the Southern Mountain Lady’s words. This is the matter of visiting Wangwu Mountain on the morrow, spoken on the twenty-fourth.

The Lord said: Boju is beneath me; the great and old can be counted on; Jiangdong has not yet seen such diligent seekers of the Dao; do not rely on Boju and forget the Dao. Falsehood is the disease of virtue; ostentation is the disaster of the body; stagnation is the chief of loss; shame is the key to the body; dispatch these four difficulties, then may the Dao be sought. At this, the spirit cart wheels sound, the sun is like a phantom. If lust and faulted heart, do not act. The way of the Upper Perfected seen yesterday at Clear Void Palace dismissed these persons’ names; they are again examined and punished, judged by the three officials; is it not to be careful?

The Southern Mountain Lady speaks.

Prefect Xu is cautious in attending funerals and mourning; this is shown within the year. The Junior Lord speaks, finishing laughing. Vessels and goblets differ, shame unremoved, registers not recorded. Though Prefect Xu has temporarily dismissed, he will again dismiss and dismiss anew. This is Clear Spirit speaking. The Eastern Minister Director of Destinies knows well Prefect Xu’s compassion and sternness; the Heavenly King yesterday asked where this person now is, what Dao he cultivates. The Eastern Minister answered: he is a man of my home district. Home district means Jurong and Maoshan neighbours; not that he is from Xianyang.

Inner brightness truly, outer confusion in works, a good talent. Now cultivating the Upper Perfected Dao. These words are human praise, somewhat like Bo’s form. Though not able to act, I have no blame. This is Southern Mountain Lady speaking.

From June twenty-fourth coming; twenty-four lines, with Yang’s writing.

Xiao Miao True Talent, inner mirror and outer harmony, Zeng Shen leaving the fields, heart like cinnabar, plain silk thrice moved, coming to shelter Fangtou. These four lines are the characters of Lihe and Zixuan, the Prefect’s name.

Record named Great Ultimate, golden script of Eastern Province, rugged robes seven times, immersed in the cave tower, inner burdens removed, souls also softened, guarding tirelessly, accumulating without rest; five difficulties dispatched, enfeoffed Bo as Marquis. Seven times, flying steps. Cave tower and chamber matters.

These are words of the Ziwei King’s Lady’s instruction, to show to Prefect Xu.

One line written by Prefect Xu.

Ziwei Lady’s instruction: "Opening the canopy’s side," etc. This matter appears in the third roll.

On the night of June twenty-seventh, this instruction was written.

One line written by Yang.

Accumulated essence inspires all things to respond; exquisite sincerity not complete, then form and splendour incomplete; form and splendour incomplete, then within the chamber difficult to be clear. I once received this method, always storing it in the northwest; northwest storage is easy to see, can be clearly shown thus. Northwest is the coolness of heaven and earth, the mysterious gate of inner illumination.

On June twenty-seventh, Ziyang’s instruction. On this twenty-seventh, the multitude of Perfected again descended, their matters numerous, not repeated here.

One line written by Prefect Xu.

Two lords each have six attendants; Pei Lord’s follower holds the blue-mane banner; one attendant bears the embroidered pouch; Zhou Lord’s follower holds the yellow-mane banner; none bear pouches.

Two lines in甲style writing.

On June twenty-ninth, Jiuhua True Consort grants writing:

Scenery responds double bright, clouds gather mysterious falls, dragon refined in five emptinesses, collecting jade at the board pavilion, long song of the spirit frog, shining opening the jade gate, fleeting is the departing matter; long farewell, red scroll and crimson wave, lightning rushing to purple dwelling; together carrying clear sounds beyond, roaming clouds and peaks and broad cliffs; is this not good? Is this not joy? The sun is the fruit of the rosy clouds, the clouds are the essence of the sun. You only hear the method of consuming the sun’s fruit, but not the knowledge of eating the cloud’s essence. The scripture of eating clouds is very secret; the way of bringing clouds is easy; this is called the method of embodying and producing jade light and cloud splendour upon the Shangqing.

The eye is the mirror of the body, the ear is the window of the form; if the sight is too much the mirror is dim, if hearing is too much the window closes. I have a polishing stone for the mirror, a method to clear windows, that can thoroughly see through the myriad spirits, and keenly observe the utmost sounds—is it possible? The face is the court of the spirit, the hair the flower of the brain; heart sorrow scorches the face, brain loss whitens the hair; so the essence and spirit within are lost, the cinnabar fluid exhausted. I have a scripture of childlike face, a method to restore whiteness—is it possible? Essence is the spirit of the body, brightness the treasure of the form; too much toil scatters essence, work ends and brightness vanishes; so old age follows qi’s decline, decrepitude arrives. I have the way of benefiting essence, the scripture of extending brightness—is it possible? These four ways are from the inner writings of Shangqing, the true chapters of standing and proof; now wish to present them to supplement your clear illumination only. Having granted, took and gave to me; I answered "Yes, yes," and begged to receive.

On the night of June twenty-ninth, Tongbai Perfected came down together, again instructing, ordering me to write:

The eight bright and four extremes, the spirit peak distant and vast, strange words uttered brilliantly, jade sounds dining and vibrating, morning flight over the clear ridge, mysterious qi rushing to the sky, the body transcends the jade void, the heart leaves the hard blade; sinking and stagnating beyond the obscure net, condensing harmony upon the tranquil waves; if such a man, surely can spin and soar through the mysterious river, sprinkling the true court; the three origins may be seen, the red name may be established. If his heart also has faults and waves, eyes see coloured sleeves, moving with the net and snare open, quiet stirring the divisions of contention; this is a distant path of immortals, seeking life’s wide expanse; be cautious. Having written, took and presented. Before was Tongbai’s message; both were on the same night; Consort An’s instruction finished, Tongbai next; thus said again. The ending looks like still Consort An, hence noted.

On the night of June thirtieth, Jiuhua True Consort with Ziwei King’s Lady and Southern Mountain Lady descended; True Consort sat long, then commanded maidservants to open the embroidered pouch, bringing forth two scrolls to present, now copied, titled as follows:

"The Inner View Hidden Book of Shangqing Jade Rosy Purple Reflections" and "Shangqing Returning Morning and Returning Child Sunshine Central Mysterious Scripture"

The above two volumes, these titles should be those of the Three Origins and Eight Meetings books, Master Yang being thoroughly versed in the true characters, ordered to make clerical script for clarity.

On the night of July first, Ziwei King’s Lady, Southern Mountain Lady, Jiuhua True Consort, Ziyang, Tongbai, Clear Void three Perfected, Maoshan two Lords descended together; after long while, I presented myself to the spirits, seeking the method to secure the body, to know distinctions of rank, life fate, and limited number of years. Then the True Consort laughed; after a while, gave this writing:

Bright lord, simple and serene, secret construct of jade radiance, orchid abyss high stream, clear sound in golden palace; truly able to treasure and store the marvels; inner brightness shining, marking the spirit scroll; riding the numbers to accord with life, pure virtue in the spirit garden; cinnabar records in jade clarity; rising smoke pulling the scenery, dark drum distant sound. Must be served by three great officials attending morning; the emperor himself high assistant; four aides bearing order. The sage lord governs life and death; rewards and punishments among ghosts and spirits; controls the lives of myriad spirits; seals mountains and summons clouds; rules the harmony of yin and yang’s vital energies; and is also lord of the ghosts and spirits of Wu and Yue. I shall extend my command and steady view; relying on splendor to give birth; spirit flies the nine heavens, the void sound blowing the room; thus operating the four senses; mysterious staircase and forms; purple name of the Supreme; clear writings of the eight scenes; spirit shines in western twilight; virtue shining within the retinue; thus receiving writings, riding the qi, entrusted with the duty of True Consort. Also assisting the Lord to sum up the three Huo, controlling myriad gods, facing the Northern Emperor, issuing orders to Feng Mountain; also should jointly hold sleeves in the spirit chamber, riding smoke of seven origins; auspicious assembly at Xi Lin; internally based on cause and condition. Hence your surname is Yang, mine An; I myself descended to the mysterious below; you received writings in the Western Palace; riding north, guiding the scenery east car; grasping banners and holding iron; exclusively governing the border; three officials obedient; rivers and mountains open the source; heavenly soldiers present arms; four armor guards. At this time, truly the Lord’s utmost nobility, a grand spectacle of true immortals. Among the three officials, a saying runs: "Yang An Great Lord, Dong True Fate Spirit, rectifies our group." The sacred emperor’s carriage has lasted twenty-eight years; adding twenty-two years; the Lord will ride the dragon and clouds, ascending in broad daylight, first visiting Shangqing Western Palace, paying homage north to the Jade Emperor of the Three Origins, then gaining office in the Eastern Pole. This is your jade radiance Ziwei, golden tone and empty leader, honoured by the Great Ultimate; thus the mysterious virtue rises; no longer need to toil in study and labour; traversing mountains and rivers. If you are earnest and diligent, your spirit will be clear and bright; also not greatly a matter of the present effortless undertaking. The vulgar are ensnared; between high and low, crossing the dust and mire, in gain and loss’s ferry; surely not the work of the Perfected’s managing, but the use of hardship and ease, fate and chance. Seeing the Lord’s grace, truly joyful; seeing the Lord’s failure, truly sorrowful; these two feelings arise upon the face, yet are insufficient to bring deep grief or long lament. As for inner dark paired scenes, all begin with the mysterious good; lightly crossing dust and haze; sharing the form of the worldly chamber; how could I by faults and stains of fleeting lowly times be sullied or dishonoured in the true established substance? Yin and Yang have pairs; misfortune and fortune counteract; two images are woven; success and failure interlaced; these are but the roads and paths of coming and going. Now men dwell amid dust and filth’s prosperity, mostly the ghosts of sins and the substances of death’s trial. One dwells uselessly in the noisy mire, thus attaining the true uprightness; making use of the mundane inner view; the root beginning of spirit immortals. For wealth and honour and licentious beauty are the axes and saws breaking bones; like boats carrying sins. Glory and pride in the world, contending in rank and time, enough to teach faults and insults, a weapon to smite life, not a good matter. Therefore the ancients of high virtue, seeing the troubles and punishments of sins, knowing wealth and honour cannot be enjoyed, withdrew to luxuriant woods, ruled the bright name mountains; chewing and tasting harmony, rinsing the clear river, desiring to distance from this nearness of evil, seeking many blessings, transcending and wide-ranging, preserving the utmost simplicity. Why should you be so eager for worldly rank and rank, throwing yourself into the market of honour and disgrace? Moreover the battle is at hand; day meets three disasters; soon the divine winds will remove; foul airs fill the sky; bright gold breeds filth in muddy dregs; jewels cast in dung to invite dust; lifting clothes shaking blood; turbid essence wasting the true; mysterious communication far and distant; this is the time. If you cannot bear the smoke of wind and fire, wish to embrace the true form in the secluded forest, you may as well seek the Dao of the sword’s release, undertaking the concluding art. From the utmost darkness comes light, the hidden and revealed near; at the moment of division and place, there is trust in the Lord. The dark numbers move and respond; given orders and contracts; this is the name of pairs, fixing inner and outer duties only. No need to follow the world’s incense and filth, nor to act licentiously with the lower characters. The matching spirit consort links with the scenery, marrying the noble true young girl; your intimate intercourse greatly benefits advancement, without harm or severance worries. A thousand spirits then may be made to test and see, no longer to present. The true banner surely will prevail; the cloud farming surely can be together mounted. I once constructed this meaning for you due to the Ziwei Lady, now fulfilled as wished, further making me joyful; be cautious and no longer doubt in heart."

This is the record of the True Consort’s descent.

The second roll of True Admonitions ends.
