The Secret Essentials of Practice Composed by the Perfected of the Supreme Clarity and Great Ultimate

The "Taishu Danjing Scripture" says: Upon the surface of the face, one should constantly desire to rub with both hands, making them warm; following the contours, high and low, all to be thoroughly and completely rubbed, so that the face may have a shining luster, wrinkles and spots do not arise. If practiced for five years, the complexion will be like that of a young maiden. This is what is called the moving qi of mountain and river, constantly full and never absent. First one should rub both hands to make them warm, then wipe the face and eyes, then smoothly rub the hair as if combing it. Also the two kidneys should be mutually rubbed with the hands, so that the hair does not turn white, and the pulses do not float outward.

This passage is taken from the middle scroll of the "Dan Jing Scripture."

The "Great Cavern True Scripture of Refined Scene Massage Chapter" says: When lying down or rising, one should regulate breath and sit upright. First interlace both hands, then pass them to cover behind the nape, then look upwards, so that the nape and both hands contend; perform this three or four times; this makes the essence and blood harmonious and flowing, the wind qi does not enter; if practiced long, one neither dies nor falls ill. When finished, bend and move the body, stretch the hands to the four directions, extend and pull sideways, shaking open the hundred joints, each three times. This is the proper formula. When lying down or rising, first use a handkerchief or thick silk to wipe the four sides of the nape and behind the ears, making it round and warm. Smoothly rub the hair and neck as if combing without order. After a long time, rub both hands to treat the face and eyes; if practiced long, it makes the eyes clear, evil qi does not dry them, the form is not greasy or sullied, and defilement is removed. When all is complete, swallow saliva thirty times to guide the internal fluids.

This passage is taken from the upper scroll of the "Great Cavern Refined Scene Scripture."

The "Great Cavern True Scripture of the Highest Inner Chapter" contains the Supreme Ritual of Restraining Evils and Great Exorcism, which says: Whenever passing dangerous roads or between ghost temples, where in the mind there are doubts and difficulties, and the heart harbours slight fear, and the places one steps upon are tense, then one should first reverse the tongue to the inner surface of the mouth, swallow saliva three times, then with the left hand use the second and third fingers to pinch the base of the philtrum beneath the two nostrils, the inner side of the nasal septum, thirty times. The hand must press quickly and not count the fingers. The junction of the nasal septum is called the Mountain Source. The Mountain Source is also named Ghost Well, Divine Pool, Root of Evil, and Soul Altar. After pinching, knock the teeth seven times thoroughly, then advance the palm to cover the nose, look upwards, and slightly recite the following:

The Vermilion Bird soars in the heavens, divine power expands within; the four guards of the Mountain Source, the Ghost Well flees; the Divine Pool exhales breath; the Root of Evil lies hidden; the Soul Altar shines in four directions; the jade chamber is resplendent; the Jade Truth stands lofty; seated guards the Bright Hall; hands wave the Purple Haze; head wears the Morning Light; holding and chanting the Cavern Scripture, thirty-nine chapters; within are exorcisms of evil dragons and tigers, severing mountains and cutting strength; fierce beasts and rushing bulls, biting blades and swallowing inlays; lifting mountains and boiling heavens; divine birds and poisonous dragons; six leaders spout fire; devouring kings of ghosts; lightning spirits and thunder fathers; pulling stars and flowing across; owls peck and scorch; moving against winds; heavenly birds arrayed; all beside me, spitting fire ten thousand zhang to remove misfortune; all true ones open the Way, sealing the mountain hamlets; a thousand gods and a hundred spirits, all knock foreheads by hand; the marsh guardian holds the censer, burning incense for me; everywhere and on all paths, myriad gods come to greet.

When finished, knock the teeth three times thoroughly, then open the eyes, slowly remove the left hand. Pressing the Mountain Source closes the Ghost Well’s gate; pressing the Divine Pool disperses the Root of Evil; pressing the Soul Altar makes the Jade Truth guard the pass. Thus it arouses the spiritual root, heavenly beasts come to protect, a thousand spirits tremble and submit, none dare harm my qi. This is the natural principle, which makes it so suddenly. The Mountain Source beneath the nose is the martial ford of the body, the conduit of truth and evil; if not true, evil qi arises; if true, all evils are restrained, under my control; thus are fortunes and misfortunes signalled. The Bright Hall within is also a pool of the body, the dwelling of life and death; preserving its spirit can be subtle, inwardly observing; neglecting its Way results in decay and rot; hence by my mastery and regulation of these methods, life and death, regret and lament are fixed.

This passage is taken from the highest first chapter of the Great Cavern True Scripture.

The True Person of the Great Void, Lord of the Southern Mountain, says in his inner method: On the fifth night of the month, at midnight, preserve the image of the sun in the heart; the sun enters through the mouth. Let it illuminate the inner unity of the heart, its light combined and joined; when accomplished, one should feel the heart warm, the rosy glow reflecting and verifying; after a long while, recite:

The Great Bright nurtures essence, internally refines the cinnabar heart; brilliance combines and shines, the divine truth comes seeking.

When finished, swallow saliva nine times. On the fifteenth, twenty-fifth, and twenty-ninth days, repeat as above. This makes one clear and attentive to hearing and observation, the hundred joints fresh and lucid, the face shining with jade light, the body radiant with golden hue; if practiced for fifteen years, the Supreme One will send a precious chariot to welcome, ascending to the Great Firmament. Although practice is best done often, it need not be on these exact days.

This passage is taken from the "Supreme Scriptures for Dispelling Demons."

The "Scripture of the Highest Spirit for Dispelling Demons" says: If the body is unrestful, one should reverse the tongue to block the throat, cough up saliva innumerable times; presently, the disorder will naturally be removed. At ordinary times one should also feel the body loose and soft.

This passage is taken from the Preface to the Scripture for Dispelling Demons.

The "Scripture for Dispelling Demons, Upper Scroll" says: The ears desire frequent pressing and suppressing of their sides, also innumerable, making one intelligent and clear. This is called governing the city walls, the name recorded in the imperial register. It also says: The nose likewise desires frequent pressing of its sides, only innumerable, making one’s qi balanced. This is called irrigating the central mountain, the name recorded in the emperor’s record.

These two methods are used by Lady Li of the Canglang Yunlin Palace.

The "Supreme Record of Arrested Hair Scripture," upper massage method: Always when the vital breath arises, after swallowing saliva twenty-seven times, press the painful part of the body, facing the king and recite:

Left mystery, right mystery, three spirits combine in truth; left yellow, right yellow, six flowers correspond; wind qi and evil diseases lie hidden in the four directions; jade liquid flows and moistens; above and below declare and open; internally dispatch water and fire; externally repel misfortune; long life and flying immortals, the body always rested and strong.

When finished, swallow saliva twenty-seven times again. If always so done, then no disease will arise. Also, urgently press the painful part thirty-one times.

This passage is taken from Lady Wang of the Right Hero of the Canglang Yunlin Palace.

The "Dan Character Purple Book Thirty-Five Sequential Practice Scripture" says: When sitting, one should often close the eyes and look inward, preserving the view of the five viscera and intestines; if practiced long, one will naturally distinguish clearly.

The "Stone Scene Scarlet Character Scripture" says: One is always able to cover mouth and nose with the hand, gaze with the eyes, subtle qi; after long practice, liquid arises in the hand, used to rub the face and eyes. If constantly practiced, it causes the body to emit fragrance.

The "Purple Degree Flaming Light Inner Vision Manual" says: One should often close the eyes and look inward, settle the body with subtle qi, making it as if lying down, so that those nearby do not perceive. Then inwardly look and far listen to the four directions, directing my ears and eyes to attend to ten thousand li beyond; if practiced long, one will naturally see events ten thousand li away, with concentrated heart; then see events a hundred thousand li distant. Also the ears will constantly hear the sound of gold and jade, the music of silk and bamboo; this is a wonderful method. The four directions, in sum, mean the words; one must first arise in one direction, then inwardly focus sight and hearing. At first doing so there is in truth no similitude, but after long time one sincerely enters the marvel.

The "Supreme Heaven Pass Three Diagram Scripture" says: One should always use the hand to press the inner corners of the eyes near the nose, hold breath and do it; when qi circulates it stops, ending then begins again. If constantly practiced, the eyes can see through.

These four passages are instructions ordered by the Mysterious Master.

The "Great Ultimate Record Scripture" says: When combing the hair, it should be done at the king’s place; after beginning to comb, slightly recite:

Mud Pillar Mysterious Flower, preserve essence and longevity; left is the hidden moon, right is the root of the sun; the six harmonies are refined, a hundred spirits receive favour.

After the incantation, swallow saliva three times. If one can constantly practice this, hair will not fall but grow. The number of times to comb may vary; comb with many strokes but do not cause pain; it is also acceptable to let an attendant comb many strokes. Thus the blood does not stagnate, and hair roots remain firm.

This passage is reported by An Jiuhua for use.

The "Orthodox One Peace Scripture" says: Hold breath and bow in stillness, causing a hundred ghosts to be fearful, the officers and messengers of the dragon and tiger lords will appear and speak; it means that if one can refine heart and essence and practice long enough. It also says: When burning incense, do not look back; to look back is to offend the true qi, which brings about evil response. It also says: When entering the stillness gate, first place the right foot forward, then advance the left foot behind to be even with the right foot. When finished, proceed as usual, so that communications may be opened and reach the highest hearing. It also says: When facing food, do not speak of death or related matters, do not expose the food, lest many evil qi come. It also says: Bathe frequently; whenever it is the day of jiazi, bathe; if not, then on some month’s first day, so as to connect with spirit. Bathing is not about the number of times, but about one’s ability; to cleanse and refine the corpse’s stench while true qi enters.

This passage is ordered by the Origin Master for use.

The "Supreme Nine Transformations and Ten Transmutations Renewed Scripture" says: If one treads upon filth and uncleanness and other unclean places, one should bathe and wash to loosen the form and remove them. The method uses ten liang of bamboo leaves, four liang of white peach peel shaved, with one hu and two dou of clear water; boil these in a cauldron until the white foam arises; let the temperature be moderate and bathe the body in it, then all filth is removed. After removing the filth, it also repels dampness, numbness, ulcers, and itching diseases. Bamboo is hollow and white inside; peach repels evil and breaks impurity. Thus these two substances are used to remove the dregs and turbidity in the form. Heaven and man descend and flow; after returning, none ever fail to use this water to cleanse themselves. As for worldly talisman waters, incantations, rinsing, and other near methods, none compare to this formula. If bathing is good, then it is so; only do not use this water for washing the hair. The refined corpse's pure liquid for cleansing is rightly used in bathing alone. This is a true and secret marvel.

This passage is ordered by Lady Wang of Ziwei for use.
