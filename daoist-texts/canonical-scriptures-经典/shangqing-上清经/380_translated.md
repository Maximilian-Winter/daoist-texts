### The Scripture of Precepts and Virtuous Conduct of the Assembly of True Ones of Shangqing, Volume the First

The Lord Qingtong of Fangzhu said: To be a man on the Way is also bitter; not to be on the Way is also bitter. The bitterness of not being on the Way is this: man is born, and from birth to old age, from old age to sickness, he guards his body until death; the bitterness is immeasurable. The heart is troubled, sin accumulates, and until death it does not cease — the bitterness is hard to tell. Moreover, many do not reach their appointed span of years. The bitterness of being on the Way is this: to be pure and upright, to preserve truth, to keep the profound and to think of the spirit, to seek the teacher with toil and difficulty, to tread trials numbering hundreds, to apply the mind without sloth, to use will firmly and with scrutiny — this is the utmost bitterness. To regard the position of lords as but that of a passer-by; to regard treasures of gold and jade as pebbles; to regard the beauty of plain white as tattered silk — only then may one be called able to inquire of the Way.

The Lord Wang of the Western City said: Man, departing from the three evil paths, obtains the form of man — this is difficult. Having obtained the form of man, to leave the female and become male is difficult. Having obtained the male form, to have the six passions and four limbs complete is difficult. Having the six passions complete, to be born in the Central Kingdom is difficult. Being in the Central Kingdom, to meet parents and sovereigns who are on the Way is difficult. Having met sovereigns on the Way, to be born into a family that studies the Way, with kindness and goodness of heart, is difficult. Having goodness of heart, to believe in the Dao and virtue as the means of long life is difficult. Having faith in the Dao and virtue and long life, to meet the peaceful destiny of Renchen (the year of the Water Dragon) is difficult. Can one not then strive earnestly? The three evil paths are those in which one is not born a man but a bird, beast, worm, or domestic animal — these are called the three evil paths.

The Supreme One asked a Daoist: How much is human life? One replied: It is within a few days. The Supreme One said: You cannot be on the Way. Another replied: Human life is between food and drink. The Supreme One said: You are gone; this is not to be on the Way. Another replied: It is between breaths. The Supreme One said: Good! This may be called being on the Way. I formerly heard these words, and now I tell you. If you learn the Way well, you may strive on this breath. Though disciples be distant from me by tens of millions of li, if their hearts keep my precepts, they will surely attain the Way. To study the Jade Scripture and precious books is surely to obtain immortality. Those who dwell on my left, intending to act wrongly, will never attain the Way. Men who read scriptures for the Way and act in its affairs are like those who eat honey; the palate is sweet, the six internal organs are pleased, and there is a lingering flavour. Those who can act thus have attained the Way.

The Lord Qingtong of Fangzhu said: For a man to be on the Way, he must be able to pull out the root of love and desire; this is like taking off suspended pearls one by one — when all are taken off, there is an end. To withdraw gradually from external evils, evil will come to an end; when it is ended, the Way is obtained. Also, to make clear to the ox that bears heavy loads trudging in the mud, when weary he dares not look left or right but longs to leave the mud to refresh himself. The enlightened man regards passion and desire as that ox in the mud; with a straightforward mind, he contemplates the Way, can avoid manifold sufferings, and attains the Way.

The True Man of Great Emptiness, Lord Red of Southern Mountain, said: Man has many faults, yet does not repent and instantly stop his mind; sin comes back upon himself as rivers flow to the sea, day by day deepening and widening. Some have evil and know it is wrong, repent and turn to good; sin is destroyed and goodness accumulated — also they attain the Way. Should men meet me with misfortune, I shall repay with blessing. Therefore, the air of blessing and virtue constantly arises here; the air of harm and heavy calamity returns there; this is the conduct of those who study the Way.

He further said: Wicked men harming the virtuous are like one spitting at the sky; the spittle does not soil the sky but soils oneself. The wind blowing dust against the wind does not soil the other, but soils oneself. The Way cannot be destroyed; misfortune will surely destroy oneself.

The True Man of Great Emptiness said: Feeding a hundred ordinary men is not equal to feeding one good man; feeding a thousand good men is not equal to feeding one man who studies the Way. Those who dwell in cold mountain forests become still better; this should be taken to heart.

Lady Ziyuan said: There are five difficulties in the world: to be poor and bestow charity is difficult; to be rich and learn the Way is difficult; to control destiny and not die is difficult; to obtain and see the Cavern Scriptures is difficult; to be born in the era after Renchen, the sage age, is difficult. I once asked the Supreme One how one might know past destiny. The Supreme One answered: The Way has no form, knowing it is of no benefit; one must keep will and practice the Way. It is like polishing a mirror; when dirt is removed, brightness remains, and one then sees one’s own form. Cut off the six passions, keep emptiness and tranquility, then one sees the truth of the Way and also knows past destiny. He also said: To think of the Way, practice the Way, and believe in the Way, thus obtaining a root of faith — its blessing is boundless.

Lady Ziyuan said: To be on the Way is like holding fire in a dark room; the darkness is extinguished and only the light remains. To study the Way and preserve rightness, folly and ignorance are extinguished and normal rightness remains. Wealth and beauty to oneself are like a little boy who greedily tastes the honey on the edge of a knife; its sweetness is not enough to please the mouth, and there is the danger of a cut tongue.

Lady Xuanqing said: Man's attachment to wife, children, and house is a greater calamity than prison and shackles. The latter may receive pardon, but the passions for wife and children, though a tiger's mouth of calamity, men willingly cast themselves into it — their sin is without pardon. The burden of passion upon man is like holding a torch against the wind: the foolish do not let go of the torch and their hands are burned. Greed, passion, anger, and stupidity are poisons that dwell in the person; if the Way does not remove these calamities early, surely there will be danger and disaster. It is like the fool holding fire and burning his hand. Those who are on the Way are like trees in the water, seeking the current and going forward; they neither touch the bank on the left nor on the right; they are not taken by men nor hindered by ghosts and spirits; they do not decay — I preserve them until they enter the sea. Man on the Way is not deluded by filthy desires, nor deceived by many evils; diligent and without doubt, I preserve that he attains the Way.

Lady Nanjí said: Man arises from love and is troubled by care; care produces fear of death. Without love there is no care; without care there is no fear. Once there was a man who recited scriptures at night and was very sorrowful; his sorrow moved his mind, and suddenly he was filled with homesickness. The True Man of the Highest Grade suddenly appeared as an ordinary man and came to ask him: "Do you pluck the zither strings sorrowfully?" He answered: "At home I often play it." The True Man asked: "What if the strings are loose?" He answered: "They neither sound nor are sorrowful." He asked again: "What if the strings are tight?" He answered: "The sound is broken and mournful." He asked: "What if the tension is just right?" He answered: "All the sounds harmonize; the eight melodies are wonderfully played." The True Man said: "Studying the Way is the same; to hold the mind and adjust it is like playing the zither; the Way can be obtained." The greatest of desires is none greater than lust; its sin has no limit, its acts no pardon. If there be even one, and again two, then no one under heaven can attain the Way. The man who studies the Way practices secret virtue no greater than charity; to relieve calamity no greater than to guard the body and observe the Way. Its blessing is great, its life very firm. If men hate me, I do not accept their hate; the hate returns upon themselves, bringing calamity to their own body, like shadow following form and sound.

This is what is spoken in the precepts of the Assembly of Spirits.

The three visions are easily moved; it is said that one may wait, and there is talk of raising the Eastern Mountain's house, and also of fencing it. When asked the reason, no reply was seen. Asked among the spirits: "Do I confuse you?" The answer was: "This meaning is not clear; therefore we wish to test it."

Many times wandering in mountain and marsh, relying on the scenery of immortal True Ones, the spiritual air will pity your distant joy; the mountain spirits will rejoice in your direction of transformation; therefore a hundred illnesses cannot harm, a hundred evils cannot violate. Often burning incense on the left and right makes the soul right, and one constantly smells the fragrance of the wind and air; after a long time one awakens. To awaken is to enter the Way; to enter the Way is to obtain immortality; to obtain immortality is to become true.

Be still and revere Heaven and Earth, think of the flying immortals; be still and contemplate mountain and river, think of the flying immortals; be still and contemplate all things, think of the all-encompassing compassionate heart. Always hold the mind thus and you will obtain the Way. Life of man is but a phantom transformation, lodged between Heaven and Earth, for a little while only. If one gathers qi and cultivates spirit, suffering and toil pouring into truth, then soon will one obtain the Way. When the Way is fulfilled, one is like Heaven and Earth, jointly abiding in Great Nothing. If the cavity is open and body transparent, then one abides in Great Nothing in the midst of silence and stillness. To behold stillness is not to see, to hear stillness is not to hear; the root of life and death is easy to understand, the years of longevity easy to seek; seeking is to attain, understanding is to endure.

He who can endure in his Way nurtures wholeness; he who constantly may wander long takes in qi. Qi whole, life is preserved; then one can nourish life. Nourishing life then accords with truth; then one can long ascend the two regions of vital breath. To look to nurture wholeness in stillness, to look upon all things’ mystery and yellow, all is but borrowed dwelling; how can one not diligently strive? Qi whole repels ghosts and evil; nurturing wholeness repels a hundred harms; entering camps one meets no armor and weapons; travelling mountains one meets no tiger or rhinoceros. This is what is meant.

The heart of learning the Way is always like recalling the morning meal; none ever fail to obtain it. Cherish qi always as cherishing the face; none ever lose it. Yet the face also suffers damage, as qi also suffers loss. What men cherish is always in the face and countenance; they worry about being defiled, then the limbs. If the qi be cherished, always as the body's foremost urgency, I have rarely seen it wither.

Men follow the customs and seek glorious names; it is like burning incense — many smell the fragrance, but do not know that constantly smoking themselves to burn; when burnt out, qi is extinguished, when name is set up, body perishes. Therefore the lofty man smiles and keeps away, thus becoming pure and tranquil. Life as a thing is like sun, moon, heaven and earth — these four symbols are right opposites to birth and growth. If life be lost, the four symbols also perish; it is not that the four symbols perish, but that life lessens them. If life be constant, the four symbols are always present; it is not that the four symbols are constant, but that I can live constantly. Constant life can also come forth without brightness; how can the four symbols be reckoned sufficient? When disaster comes and calamity is born, the form is destroyed and qi is lost — whence arise these things? It seems from much speech and not keeping unity, many beginnings and hoping to barely escape. Therefore the hanging nest and rotten branch fall; a hundred victories are lost by one defeat. Alas, the talent for immortality — how can it be made weak and broken?

This is what Lady Nanyue says.

The great heron turns southward, with wide wings fluttering in the fields of tens and hundreds. The crows think themselves enough; yet the little dove sighs at their smallness; the great Peng laughs at the heron's flight as but a span’s measure. If one rests in one’s rest, then right and wrong are sufficient; therefore the three crows do not discuss one another, why then deride them?

This is the speech of Ziwei.

Weakly lost in nets and tears, the faithful spirit not yet fully exhausted, leaning and lying on strange causes; the cloud ladder not yet raised; though having yearnings for progress, still not deep in the utmost principle. Your talents are indeed heaven’s work, condensing clear waves into high notes; your spirit dwells in the Great Mysterious; you expect to step in the Purple Court and walk the void. Your heart is open to flying and lingering, your soft feathers flourish in dark contracts. Movement accords with rules and compass; equal roundness differs from square; quietude harmonizes true flavour; breathing forth and in stirs music; this may be called the unrestrained flourishing of virtue; truly admirable. Yet your filthy thoughts are not cleared; your meanness and stinginess are inwardly fixed; lustful thoughts unceasing; the spirit pool not clear. Soon you will not obtain the time for discussing inner and outer, but only float between the two scenes. To lose opportunity is precious to amend appearance and improve; to release attachments is no hindrance. Though temporarily obeying the many voices, thus you can achieve harmony. The road ahead is distant; this and that are not one; the threads are many; one must always fight for peace. If feelings slip and scatter, lose with events, the words of awakening will be faint; how then to stop and dismiss them?

On the night of the twenty-sixth day of the seventh month, Lady Youying of Yunlin sent a written message; see it but do not reply.

Clear sounds scatter the void; spiritual winds sprinkle the forest. The body transcends dark paths; the mind chants spiritual music. The benevolent marquis is this man. He wishes to show the beginning and end of the True Man Pei to Qi; he will surely harmonize. If not good in guiding, his mind will also manifest within. Who then is Pei?

### The Scripture of Precepts and Virtuous Conduct of the Assembly of True Ones of Shangqing, Volume the Second

The Scripture says: Formerly there was Liu Shaoweng, who several times entered Mount Taihua, bowed and worshipped facing the mountain, so for twenty years; then one day suddenly he saw the Old Man of Western Peak and was given the immortal Way. It further says: Once there was a man who, many mornings, went to the river side and bowed to the river water, so for ten years; the River Lord and River Earl then appeared to him, and gave him ten pairs of white jade disks, instructing him in water travel and the method of not drowning. This man later attained the Way at Central Peak. It further says: When Zuo Ci first came, he also diligently bowed many times to the spirit mountain; after some five years, he was allowed to enter the inner and outer palaces of east and west. It further says: To learn the Way one should be like the mountain world far away; to leave human affairs one should be like the Clear Spirit True Man; to walk in deep seclusion one should be like Zhou Ziyang — how can one fail to attain the Way? It further says: Will and resolve should be diligent; spirit must be purified and made empty; all acts and doings should be secret. It further says: East of Maoshan there is a small cave; the mouth of the cave is barely the size of a dog’s treasure. It is unfit for men to enter. The further in, the wider; outside it is blocked by spiralling rocks; therefore there is a small hole about the size of a cup, for the mountain spirits to guard. This spiralling rock is sometimes opened, called the Gate of the Yin Palace. If you diligently fast and seek it, you may enter here, easier than the usual cave entrance. The usual cave entrance has much sand inside, the path is crooked and remote; crossing water is inconvenient and difficult. The small cave mouth goes straight down three or four li, then directly reaches the Eastern Mysterious Gate of the Yin Palace. Entering this cave mouth two hundred paces, it is bright as daylight. It further says: Great Maoshan also has a small cave on the south side, similar and called the Southern Convenience Gate; it is also blocked with stone. But when the spirit is purified and the heart directed to the Master of Fate, and often ascending the mountain on two days to extend welcome and prayers, one naturally sees it. I am certain; why should the Yin Palace not be worthy to behold? Who then is Zuo Ci?

The Fate Master Mao said: If one must model oneself on the Profound and Grasp the Image, clear in contention and rare in time, then one draws out the many secluded weeds, folds wings and perches high; sensing flavour and connecting above, deep and still, mountain standing; desolate jade chapters, pure treasures and spirit arising; casting off mundane attachments, tuning and playing the pure and clear; clearing brightness in empty void; the five ways manifest; colours cease their transformative waves; desiring to be calm and level; empty, deep, and dark roads; no sight or hearing. Thus far one is distant from the wonderful truth, again arises profound awakening; bright virtue is round within, spiritual mark sufficient outside. At last one can harness the cloud carriage and ascend the sky, inscribing the Fate Master’s cinnabar record. Yet if the spirit is dispersed in myriad thoughts, life unstable, qi following dust waves, mind not truly resting, it only labours body and spirit in forest and hill; truly a mistake for the learner. The Way is subtle and easy to seek, yet difficult and hard to obtain.

The Supreme Fate Master Lady Wei of Southern Mountain said: Yesterday with Fate Master Mao I went to the Clear Void Palace, to examine the gain and loss of true immortals. Recently forty-seven names were removed; three more were added; also the lists of your ranks were reviewed. Now going on, Xu Miao is recorded among the immortal registers. At first I did not understand this, but now it is better. With heart cleansed and diligently advancing, principles thoroughly focused, heart and will exhausted, as if walking on ice and fire — if held long in this way, even the True Man cannot escape, nor can the immortal Way be hidden. But one must curb and cut off lustful thoughts; then we can see and reveal it.

The Standard Record says: Immortals are all among the minor officials. The Supreme Old Master is soon to be revered again; no one in Jiangdong has been so diligent in the Way; yet one must not rely on immortals and forget the Way. Also it says: Falsehood is the sickness of virtue; ostentation the disaster of the body; stagnation the head of loss; shame the key of the body; remove these four difficulties, then one may begin to inquire of the Way. Thus the spirit pole sounds the to-and-fro; there is daily imitation. If one has lustful and mistaken heart, one must not walk the True Way. Yesterday I saw the Clear Void Palace, where names of those to be removed were rightly struck off; yet some were still examined and referred to the Three Officials for appraisal. Should one not be cautious?

This is the statement of Lady Nanyue.

The Pure Spirit True Man said: When the mean heart is forgotten, gain is different; if meanness and shame are not removed, the records of life are not written. Though Scribe Xu has for a time been removed, he must again be removed and written again.

Lady Nanyue said: The Eastern Minister of Fate well knows the compassion and severity of Scribe Xu. Yesterday a minor heavenly king asked: "Where is this man now, and what Way does he cultivate?" The Eastern Minister answered: "He is a man of my native place, inwardly bright and true, outwardly blending with the world’s affairs; a good man indeed, now cultivating the True Way of the Highest." These words are praise of men’s thoughts, somewhat like the form of an immortal.

True Man Ziyang said: Let Xu Yu-fu bathe several times, to remove the qi of water evil, to dissolve accumulated nodules of illness. This is also the step to realize truth.

Lady Ziwei said: Bathing not several times is the nature of the soul; to violate the soul and turn back is wrong; refining the turbid and filthy, the soul perishes of itself.

Lady Youying of Yunlin said: To oppose stagnation is like rescuing the poor by practising virtue — is this not excellent? Do not worry that virtue is not repaid; what is to be worried about is that the seeds of virtue are not many. This one act seems like sowing a field of blessing. All affairs are thus, all touch the class.

Lady Youying said: From ancient times to now, death and life have their ferry; brightness and darkness meet in difference; hidden and vanished wisdom with the world — those who accompany the world are all practices of the Way. As for the Qiongdans’ single ride, Nine Blossoms thrice flying, cloud liquid morning intoxication, flowing yellow lingering, looking up and swallowing golden nectar, chewing jade rui — immediately one controls the light and ascends the void, mysteriously rising to Supreme Micro. Since the affairs of the world are at odds with mystery, this work is not yet achieved; one should temporarily tread Taiyin, secretly live in the dark village; abandon the outer body and nurture the fetus in the empty dwelling; refine qi and cut the key; receive essence and profound darkness. Therefore one changes appearance in the hall of the Three Yin, a youthful face in the door of Nine Refinements; then one knows spirit immortals are wondrous, dying but not perishing; departure and coming are matters deeply reasoned.

Mao’s Standard Record says: The phoenix nests in tall trees, dressed in plain clothes; walking in accord with thought and completion, concentrating heart on emptiness and mystery. The five lords and stone marrow, the body’s convenience, must hasten to wear it, to slightly restore complexion. The three eights clarify brightness, next practices profound truth; loosening reins and resting, this may be called the cave chapter. The jade blades respond in number; spirit and heart perch high; hidden, silent, and closed; righteous qi not lacking; technique disperses and removes sickness; this is what is proper. Next wear the □ meal, and grain do not disobey; benefit marrow and remove maladies; fatten skin and fill flesh; then ascend the mountain, chant the cave and expound subtlety; the beast of Yin with white teeth; then you see opportunity; thus you gain immortality. Passing the Renchen period, resting amid flourishing trees; playing with the Zhou book, Taiji planting slips; the golden name in Western Splendour; learning to wear or not; breath responding to spiritual talisman; reason differing yet agreeing; spirit and cave mutually seeking.

Mao Baoming said: Words encountered may all be used; not using them is heartlessness. How can one follow sudden traces? Seek this spirit in the void; subtle sound indeed has meaning; use it cautiously, do not lightly; in all affairs respond to the divine mechanism; preserve you to see peace.
