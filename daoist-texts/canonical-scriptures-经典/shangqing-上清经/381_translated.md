## The Scripture of the Perfected of Supreme Clarity, the True Person of the Great Ultimate

### The Upper Method of the Perfected Who Ingest the Four Extremities and Cloud Teeth

The female disciple Wei Huacun received the formula from the True Person of Pure Emptiness.

The True Person embraces the radiance of the original morning of the five directions, ingests the essence of the nine clouds — thus the spirit shines within, vermilion blossoms appear without; the body produces jade reflections, the form and qi are bright. After practising ten years, the Elder of the Four Extremities, the Central Original Lord, descends; upon a union, one mounts cloud chariots and dragons, ascending by day to Heaven.

In former times the True Person of the Great Ultimate, Western Liang’s Master Ziwen, received the supreme secret formula from the Highest One, transmitted through five generations over a thousand years, not to be revealed lightly. The Four Brightness rites and methods, following the regulations of secret texts, require five days’ fasting before instruction, an oath sealed by blood, and the sprinkling of five pairs of fresh gourd seeds, to effect a pact of trust between Heaven and man, a secret pledge not to disclose. The formula consists of five pairs of rings. Also used are five taels of blue silk, said to be the method of the True Person of Western Liang; the Lady of the Southern Mountain says cloud pavilion silk may also be used, but this scripture does not mention it.

At the time of cockcrow before dawn, sitting in rest, one lets the mind be at will, striking the teeth nine times with full opening, then recites the Yin invocation:

> Eastward, azure teeth, violet clouds streaming and rosy;  
> Three whites wander, mysterious frost and jade gauze;  
> Ingesting the morning radiance, drinking of the morning blossoms.

Upon completion of the invocation, lick the outer upper lip with the tongue, gathering saliva to swallow thirty times. After practising ten years, the Elder of the Eastern Extremity arrives, granting the red and blue true talisman; upon union, ascend together.

Next follows the Yin invocation:

> Southward, vermilion cinnabar, rosy brightness of the Great Subtle;  
> Nine paths of crimson smoke, spreading the shining radiance;  
> Ingesting the spiritual morning, drinking of the cinnabar pool.

Upon completion, lick the outer lower lip with the tongue, gathering saliva to swallow thirty times. After practising ten years, the Elder of the Southern Extremity arrives, granting the red radiance talisman; together ascend.

Next follows the Yin invocation:

> Westward, bright stones, flying rosy golden liquid;  
> Ingesting the Great Brightness, essence of pure spirit;  
> Drinking of the jade nectar, spirit blossoms open the numinous;  
> Enabling me to mount the void, ascending the pure heights.

Upon completion, lick the inner upper lip, gathering saliva to swallow thirty times. After practising ten years, the Elder of the Western Extremity arrives, granting the white talisman of awe-inspiring spirit; ascend together.

Next again the Yin invocation:

> Northward, dark nourishment, auspicious clouds awaken the womb;  
> Green spirit spreads the morning, purple canopy and blue banner;  
> Ingesting the moonlight, drinking of the jade honey.

Upon completion, lick the inner lower lip, gathering saliva to swallow thirty times. After practising ten years, the Elder of the Northern Extremity arrives, granting the profound record and precious pact; ascend together.

Also a Yin incantation says:

> The origin of Wu and Ji, yellow essence and five clouds;  
> Four rosy vapours and purple views;  
> Eight lights and nine mornings;  
> Two lights stirring radiance, seven luminaries revered;  
> Harmonizing essence pouring qi, ingesting the central origin;  
> Jade blossoms and dragon womb, drinking of the sweet spring.

Upon completion, rinse the mouth with the tongue full, the inner and outer cavity and between tongue and teeth wrapped up all around, gathering saliva and swallowing thirty times. After practising ten years, the Central Original Lord and the Supreme Sovereign, the Mysterious Yellow Old Lord, descend, granting the yellow qi, yang essence, hidden heaven moon flight, green radiance chapter, blue essentials, tiger book, all united with the Four Elders to ascend together.

This jade scripture’s supreme formula leads to the way of the Five Elders, ending hunger and removing corpse troubles, showing a bright youthful countenance, unaffected by cold or heat, unharmed by calamities, spirit and immortal clarity, extending life and advancing the eras, increasing longevity by ten thousand years. When one attains the nine jade nectars and eight precious flying clears, then the two radiances are united, Heaven and Earth harmonizing.

These five Yin spirit invocations all require striking the teeth nine times; they may be practised regularly, not necessarily waiting for cockcrow before dawn. At midnight, in stillness, the body clear and spirit tranquil, in leisure and quietude one may perform them.

The family that guards Oneness: if they hear of this way, matters quickly succeed. With clouds light and inner guarding, filling the original and swallowing saliva, this may be called true unity, seeking much blessing oneself. To lead the spirit with six fluids and five airs, qi and fluid are cultivated by oneself; hence it is called seeking much blessing by oneself.

Those who cultivate this way may take qi as food; if hunger is perceived, one may eat farinaceous food, gradually lessening grain, not abandoning it at once. This is called diminishing and diminishing until reaching non-action.

This way of empty reflection is the work of Nature itself, called drawing from afar the essence of Heaven and Earth, drawing near to the body itself. The cloud teeth are the essence qi of the Five Elders, the rosy smoke of the Great Ultimate; therefore one gathers the sharpness of radiance and light to fill the harmonious six fluids, penetrating subtle darkness and mysterious response, ten thousand spirits descending, gloomy reflections seeking one another, responding without voice. Thus the dragon’s roar sounds the deep abyss, hence the radiance clouds fall from the sky; the tiger’s roar shakes the spirit mountains, hence the wind is stirred in four directions; the yang fire shines brightly and vermilion flames rise; the directions are rarefied and Yin is profound and flowing abundantly, naturally and spontaneously, beyond all measure. How much more when the student turns the heart to the mystery, diligently researching the root of the Way, cleansing impurities and burdens from the chest, the true unity residing in the three palaces, gathering the five morning dispersing radiances, ingesting six nectars of rosy liquid, invoking the nine heavens’ wondrous treasures, uttering the secret words of subtle spirit, the dragon’s brightness bursts forth, the clear light shines sevenfold, tasting the three blossoms on bright teeth, gathering precious liquid on the lip’s edge, refining the six viscera within, opening clear perception, breathing the original heaven, refining soul and spirit, morning mystery sending forth the origin, reaching spiritual cultivation. After ten years’ end, the five spirits come down; what need is there for abundant praise? Though a woman weak, she completes the highest work of the scripture; faint sound and vanished echo, not to be proclaimed abroad; here a brief statement of the marvel, to encourage those of like mind. If cultivation of virtue is insufficient, one cannot blame or condemn.

The above preface is from Lady Wei of the Southern Mountain.

## The Scripture of the Spirit Treasure Spoken by the Pure and Spiritual True Person

To fix the heart on the true Way, to meditate on the spiritual person, even in darkness the spirit watches over its intent. If external difficulties are yet unremoved, with half chanting and half preserving, truly one cannot return to the years of Western Elm, yet again issuing from the mysterious child. If one is devoted to the profound and earnest purpose, even if the teeth are carved and face wrinkled, neck blossoming with pale radiance, my Way can change it to infancy in a moment. But ask, what is the condition of the purpose? There is no place for learning among the old and young. I have gone to such persons.

## The Supreme Mysterious True Upper Scripture

The Eastern Minister of Life says: Our former master, Lord Wang, once received the "Supreme Illuminated Hall Mysterious True Upper Scripture," fasting purely and resting from food, storing the sun and moon in the mouth, storing the sun by day and moon by night, making them as large as a ring. The sun is red with nine purple rays; the moon is yellow with ten white rays. Swallowing and ingesting the liquid of the rays, constantly secretly practising innumerable times. If one does not cultivate storing, the sun and moon remain in the bright hall of the face, the sun on the left, the moon on the right, making the two radiances conjoin with the pupils in breath and qi. This Way gathers movement and produces essence, regulates and harmonizes soul and spirit, with six assistants attending, heavenly soldiers guarding; this is the Way of the Supreme True. Its "Supreme Mysterious True Scripture" requires first an oath, then practice; only after practice may one hear the Way of jade pendants and golden earrings.

Formerly Ji Wei meditated and fasted for three years, sincerely exhausting single thought, then could obtain this spirit radiance illuminating the body, and then received the book. This Way of mystery is essential but not complicated; I always treasure it secretly, carrying it in my bosom, thus showing it only to those cautious. The Illuminated Hall Mysterious True has its own scripture, but it is very small. The general formulas proceed thus. Ji Wei did not obtain the scripture, but by practising in this way obtained the scripture. If you desire to obtain it, go to Wei to fetch the scripture. The hidden book of jade pendants was not seen by Wei.

To take the elixir of immortality, one must proceed according to one’s original life; after taking it, do not immediately enter the Way of death and mourning, thus violating the fetal spirit, merely taking the original benefit. At night walking and lying down, if the heart is fearful, store the sun and moon again within the bright hall; in a moment, all evils perish. Living in the mountains constantly is best.

Each day, one presses with the hand the small cavity behind the eyebrows three times nine, then rubs with palm and fingers the cheekbones, then cups the ears thirty times, rubbing with no fixed time. Then pressing back on the forehead three times nine, from between the eyebrows upward to the hairline, swallowing various quantities of saliva. Practising thus constantly, the eyes become clear; within a year one may write by night. It may be done secretly on others, but do not announce the appearance.

The small cavity behind the eyebrows is the palace of the Upper Origin and the Six Harmonies, ruling the generation of the eye’s radiance, harmonizing the lustrous essence, preserving and refining the eye spirit; this is the supreme Way of the True Person sitting upright, also called the True Person’s Constant Residence within the Scripture. The True Person says: If you desire to write by night, you must cultivate the Constant Residence. The True Person can observe and reach all directions, illuminating the eight corners; indeed, the number of the Yellow Emperor and Sovereign is bright.

Below the eyes on the cheekbones is the decision to illumine, preserve the chamber, and return the infant to the Way. With the hand cupping the ear, this is the profound method of illumination. Here the principle opens and blood disperses, wrinkles do not arise, the eye blossoms shine mysteriously, harmonizing spirit and filling vigor. Most people when growing old first show signs in the ears and eyes; also the beginning of old form appears at the sides of the eyes.

With the hand upon the forehead, internal infant, sun and moon double brightness, the Upper Origin rejoices, the three origins begin on the eyebrows; after counting, one stops. This is called the hand facing the three origins, fixing the brain, strengthening hair. With both hands upon the head’s four sides, smoothing the hair to the knot, only to increase it. Thus the head’s blood flows and disperses, wind and damp do not congeal. All done, pressing with the hand the four canthi of the eyes two times nine, to make the vision bright and clear; this is the method of verifying eye spirit. Long practice grants sight of a hundred spirits.

The method of seeking the Way requires clear eyes and keen ears as the chief matters. Moreover, ears and eyes are ladder steps to seek truth, the gateway of spirit; gains and losses depend on them; life and death rely on their discrimination. Now copying the scripture to show, it may be applied and used as well.

Those who take divine rice are not harmed by a hundred evils nor affected by sickness; they abandon thoughts and desires, utterly extinguish the three corpses, have bright ears and eyes, walk lightly and nimbly. After ten years, the spirit of green essence gives command, sitting, standing, dying and living, they can conceal, transform, and escape, summoning wind and cloud. In years of misfortune, with no grain or in poverty, take only southern candle (plant) with tuckahoe, or with honey; southern candle mixed with pine and cypress leaves. On meeting days, supplement these; not only must they avoid grain, but they must not be called divine rice. All must be accompanied with breathing exercises and swallowing saliva to harmonize glory and defense; always thus.

Divine rice must employ the use of cloud sprouts; cloud sprouts do not require divine rice. When many act together using the ancient scale, daily one may take two and a half he; taking too much is not feared, only insufficiency of supply; thus two and a half he is the limit. At first taking medicine, it is not convenient to break grain. This is the famous formula of the High Immortal, the miraculous Way of avoiding food.

### The Great Cavern True Scripture

This is the treasured book of the Central Yellow Old Lord; only the highest name true Way priests may see its chapters and sections. Among true immortals, there are some who have not heard of this book. At first limited to one copy every hundred years, transmitted to worthy and cautious persons. Afterwards, counting three hundred, five hundred years, again daring to transmit to one; strictly only three transmissions. Time limits according to oath regulations; receiving the person is called granting. If transmitted lightly, violating the oath, revealing the secret celestial writing, all are guilty and go to hell.

### The Supreme Secret Text of the Jade Emperor, the Composition and Binding of the Jade Thread

This is the spiritual secret treasured chapter of the Supreme Jade Emperor, stored in the room of the Nine Heavens and the pill chamber of the Jade Elixir. Only those diligent in heart and fond of truth, those who have the record of the flying mysterious heavenly immortal bones, may obtain and hear it. Its chapters and titles must not be spoken of rashly. Those who speak rashly offend the four judges; the Three Officials of Heaven and Earth pardon not. Initially limited to one transmission every three hundred years, afterwards only one every seven hundred years, one person may only receive a second transmission. According to time limits and oath of trust, receiving a person is granting. Improper transmission, violating the oath, leaking out secret celestial writings, is the same. All who reveal heavenly writings die as low ghosts; the three ancestors are tested; in life they suffer cruel punishment, burning, soldiers and slaughter. The secret exams in the mystery, the supreme law oaths, the jade child inspectors examine and hasten. Be cautious of disaster, disaster affects ancestors, fathers and mothers. Without sufficient time limit, even if meeting immortals, one must keep silent; those who keep silent are safe. The Great Cavern True Scripture is limited to five hundred years, transmitted to three persons, no further transmission.

The Supreme Secret Text of the Jade Emperor, if leaked, reduces ten inspectors of the jade children each; the text is lost and returns to heaven. If leaked again, death ensues, no further cultivation, and no immortal attained. If words are falsely spoken or chapters revealed, all are tried by the Three Officials; the master must at death or returning to the Yin realm, remove corpses and erase traces and transformations. Must have been granted, if a true person, then follow naturally.

Those who receive all do so with blue gold and cinnabar silk, the oath covenant of aged and refined boxes; masters report upwards, making report to sun and moon. Not following regulations is spreading false transmissions.

At the north cave of Mount Emei, in the stone chamber hinge, characters are carved: "The Jade Thread draws the sun’s essence, binds the moon’s spirit, those who obtain the Way become upper palace, titled great officer true person." Twenty characters in all. Immortals reading this carving mostly do not understand its meaning. Thus among immortals, many have not seen its chapters.

### The method of gathering and swallowing the sun’s qi

The Purple Text of the Spirit Book of the Golden Pavilion of Supreme Clarity teaches the method of gathering the flying roots and swallowing the sun’s qi. Formerly received from the Great Subtle Heavenly Emperor, also called the scripture of Red Cinnabar, Golden Essence, Stone Radiance, and Water Mother. One must constantly think upon the time when the sun first rises, facing east to the sun, striking the teeth nine times fully; then in the heart recite the Yin invocation, calling the sun spirit’s name and the characters of the five emperors in the sun:

> Sun Spirit, pearl radiance, shining sheath, green reflection, returning rosy clouds, red child, mysterious flame, whirlwind image.

When the heart recites these sixteen characters, close the eyes firmly, forming the image of the five colors of floating rosy clouds in the sun all coming to receive the body, descending to the feet. Also imagine the five qi rising to the crown; thus the sun’s light and rosy clouds of five colors all enter the mouth. Among the sunlight and rosy clouds, there appear again dozens of purple qi as large as pupils, shining brightly among the five lights, called flying root water mothers. All come with the five qi into the mouth; facing the sun one swallows the rosy clouds, performing forty-five breaths of swallowing qi. After swallowing qi, swallow saliva nine more times, then strike the teeth nine times fully, and softly recite:

> Vermilion furnace cinnabar qi, perfect heaven nurturing essence;  
> Hard receiving softness, burning water yin essence;  
> Sun and star original radiance, called Great Brightness;  
> Eight-nine yang transformations, two smokes both arise;  
> Condensing soul and harmonizing po, essence of five qi;  
> Midst gives birth to five emperors, riding light and guiding form;  
> Gathering flying emptiness, gathering roots to fill;  
> Head wrapped with dragon blossoms, wearing vermilion and blue;  
> Bridles black flowing black, rosy clouds reflect Supreme Clarity;  
> Grant the book of jade slips, inscribed in the empty pavilion;  
> Ingest morning blossoms, united with the True;  
> Visiting the Immortal Great Subtle, ascending to the Purple Court.

Upon completion, bow twice to the sun.

Among true immortals numbering over ten thousand, none know the sun spirit’s name. This Way is profound and mysterious; not to be heard by those of blood and food and foul decaying bodies. When the sky is dark and sunless, one may do it indoors in a clean and pure place. Pure cultivating Daoists, versed in superior response, all can practise without seeing the sun. If Daoists rest from food in mountains and forests, long fasting on the Five Peaks, separating from dusty world, contemplating purity and truth, they may daily take the sun root’s rosy clouds, swallowing the sun’s essence, then immediately feel the body produces jade radiance, the face showing flowing light. If burdened by worldly matters, unable to quiet the form, wandering in the world, mind restrained and confined, one must practise on the days moon one, three, five, seven, nine, thirteen, fifteen, seventeen, nineteen, twenty-five, according to the above method ten times a month. On these days the moon spirit descends to connect, flying root fills, water mother groups dream. Practising eighteen years, Supreme Clarity will refine with golden truth, bright as jade light, being named true immortals, flying through the great void, riding on three pure blossoms, to travel the world.

### The opening luminous talisman for ingesting the sun’s qi of the Great Subtle (missing talisman)

Written in vermilion on green paper on the night of the new moon halfway through, facing east, to be swallowed, first announcing the sun spirit. When taking the talisman, hold breath, left hand holding the talisman, heart reciting:

> Great Subtle cinnabar writing, named Opening Light;  
> Summoning the upper sun spirit, to transform my form;  
> Daily strict arrangement, issuing from the round courtyard;  
> Flying blossoms and water mothers, sun root golden essence,  
> Purple reflecting flowing light, called the Five Spirits.

Upon completion of the invocation, swallow the talisman.

---

### The method of gathering and swallowing the moon’s essence

The Purple Text of the Spirit Book of the Golden Pavilion of Supreme Clarity teaches the method of gathering and swallowing the yin blossoms, swallowing the moon’s essence, formerly received from the Great Subtle Heavenly Emperor, also called the scripture of Yellow Qi, Yang Essence, Hidden Heaven, and Moon. One must think upon the time when the moon first rises, facing west to the moon, striking the teeth ten times fully; then in the heart recite the secret invocation, calling the moon spirit’s name and the characters of the five ladies in the moon:

> Moon spirit, warm, desolate, fragrant, brilliant, obscure, gentle, ethereal, orchid, luxuriant, blossoming, binding, proud, settled, golden, clear, camp, bright, countenance, terrace, standard.

When the heart recites these twenty-four characters, close the eyes firmly, forming the image of the five colors of flowing moon essence all coming to receive the body, descending to the feet. Also imagine five qi rising to the crown; thus the moonlight flows with five colors all entering the mouth. Among the moonlight and essence, there appears again dozens of yellow qi as large as pupils, layered one upon another, following in the five colors of moonlight, called flying yellow moon blossoms essence. All come with five qi into the mouth, facing the moon, swallowing essence, performing fifty breaths of swallowing. After swallowing qi, swallow saliva ten more times, then strike the teeth ten times fully, softly reciting:

> Yellow clear mysterious radiance, original yin upper qi;  
> Scattering abundant cold whirlwind, clouds gathering and folding stomach;  
> Vacant orchid blossom, upright and clear vessel;  
> Moon essence night radiance, the upper noble of the mysterious palace;  
> Five lord ladies, named preservers, motherly positions;  
> Red child flying in, infants continuing;  
> Returning yin threefold, light mysterious ten thousand directions;  
> Harmonizing soul and controlling po, five wombs flowing and communicating;  
> Riding rosy clouds flying essence, escaping void in the east;  
> Head wrapped with spirit clouds, shining blossoms summoning wind;  
> Left wearing dragon talisman, right needing tiger badge;  
> Phoenix feathers vermilion cape, jade pendants golden earrings;  
> Lofty trees forming arches, called the wood king,  
> Divine toad controlling roots, charged with bright essence;  
> Within reflecting mysterious waters, issuing beams, granting books,  
> Jade slips inscribed, cloud chamber taking food, sun and moon essence, united with the True, flying immortals of Purple Subtlety, attending the Great Emperor.

Upon completion, bow twice to the moon, preserving sun and moon, sitting or standing as convenient.

Among the celestial officials, none know the moon spirit’s name; only the true persons at that time knew it. When the sky is dark and moonless, one may perform this indoors, applying the essential method as in taking sun light. At every evening practice, one immediately feels the body produces radiant light, the eyes having flying essence. The essential days for the moon are two, four, six, eight, ten, sixteen, eighteen, twenty, twenty-two, twenty-four days; ten times a month is enough to become immortal. On these moon evenings, the yin essence flies and joins, three qi fills and overflows, moon water forms blossoms, the yellow spirit descends to connect. Practising eighteen years, Supreme Clarity will refine soul and change po, reflecting jade light, riding mysterious reins of radiance, flying through the great void.

### The talisman for taking the Great Mysterious Yin birth (missing talisman)

Written in yellow on green paper on the night of the new moon halfway, facing east, to be taken, first announcing the moon spirit. At that time, first take the opening luminous talisman. When taking the moon talisman, hold breath, right hand holding talisman, heart reciting:

> Purple Subtle yellow writing, named Great Mysterious,  
> Summoning moon blossom waters, nourishing po and harmonizing soul;  
> Strict matters in the square, issuing from the mysterious gate;  
> Hidden heaven moon, five spirit ladies, flying light nine paths,  
> Reflecting brightly the mud pellet.

Upon completion, swallow the talisman.

### The method for restraining the three souls

On the third, thirteenth, and twenty-third moon evening, at this time, the three souls are unsettled, the *Shuang Ling*, floating and wandering, the fetal light emitting form, the subtle essence disturbing and calling. The *Shuang Ling*, fetal light, and subtle essence three lords are the three souls’ spirit names. These evenings all they roam, wandering and drifting from the original chamber; sometimes seen and restrained by other souls or external ghosts; sometimes captured by demons; sometimes cannot return, departing form and releasing substance; sometimes attacking the external soul; two qi fighting; all are restless red children, causing other thoughts, coming and going without form; hearts sorrowful and minds distressed. Daoists must restrain and control them, making them not wander.

The method of restraint: lie down correctly, remove pillow and stretch feet, cross the palms above, close eyes and breath for three breaths, strike teeth three times fully, imagine in the heart a red qi like a chicken’s egg, rising from within upward through the eyes, outside the red qi grows large, burning the body, making one body all clear, like glowing charcoal; all done. At that time one will feel a slight heat within the body. Then strike teeth three times fully, imagine the three souls’ names: fetal light, *Shuang Ling*, subtle essence; the three spirits remain still. Then softly invoke:

> Great Subtle Mysterious Palace, central yellow begins blue;  
> Within refining three souls, fetal light at peace;  
> Spirit treasure jade chamber, born with me;  
> Must not move rashly; the inspector is most spiritual;  
> If desiring to fly, only may visit the Great Ultimate Supreme Clarity;  
> If desiring hunger or thirst, only may drink the returning water jade essence.

---

### The method for controlling the seven po

On the new moon, full moon, and dark moon evenings, at this time, the seven po wander and run, filthy and turbid, sometimes communicating with blood food, going to ghosts and demons; sometimes related to dead corpses; sometimes lusting after red children, gathering evil to attack dwellings; sometimes reporting people’s sins to the Three Officials and River Lord; sometimes changing into monsters, causing aversion to demons; sometimes causing ghosts to enter the body, calling evil and killing substance. All residual diseases born in people are the fault of po; taking pleasure in death is po’s nature; desiring a person’s ruin is po’s sickness. Daoists must control and punish them, display and transform them, govern and correct them, restrain and awe them.

Their first po is called corpse dog; second po is called lurking arrow; third po is called sparrow shade; fourth po is called swallowing thief; fifth po is called non-poison; sixth po is called removing filth; seventh po is called stinking lung.

These are the seven po’s names, the turbid ghosts within the body. The method of control and inspection: lie down straight, remove pillow, stretch feet, both palms cover ears, fingertips touching crossing at the nape; close breath for seven breaths, and imagine at the nostrils white qi like small beans, gradually increasing, crowning the body nine layers, descending to feet, ascending to the head. When finished at the head, the white qi suddenly transforms into heavenly beasts, making two green dragons at the eyes, two white tigers at the nostrils, all facing outwards; on the heart towards the mouth, a blue tortoise at the left foot’s bottom, a spirit snake at the right foot’s bottom. In the ears are jade maidens, wearing dark brocade clothes, standing at the ear gate, each hand holding firelight. After a time all done, swallow saliva seven times, strike teeth seven times fully, call the seven po’s names, then invoke:

> White qi nine turns, controlling po and removing harm;  
> Heavenly beasts guard gates, lovely maidens hold the pass;  
> Refining po and harmonizing softness, agreeing with me;  
> Must not move rashly, watch and inspect form’s origin;  
> If you are hungry or thirsty, obey and drink moon yellow and sun cinnabar.

Thus the seven po are closed within, guarded and controlled. If practised constantly, po’s turbid lower parts vanish, turn good and unite with the form, harmonizing the three palaces, uniting with the origin spirit. A person’s body has three origin palace spirits, the life gate has the mysterious pavilion great lady, and the three souls’ spirits; altogether seven spirits are within the form. They desire to make one long-lived, the benevolent and greatly auspicious lord. The seven po are also born within one body, yet attack and harm it; therefore must be controlled. Daoists only know the method of seeking immortality, but not the way of controlling po; thus they do not escape vain toil.

The location of the three origin palaces: The Upper Origin Palace is in the mud pellet; its spirit is the infant, named Three Origins First, also called Emperor Minister; the Middle Origin Palace is in the centre of the crimson chamber; its spirit is the True Person, named Zi Nan Dan, also called Middle Light Firm; the Lower Origin is the cinnabar field palace, three cun below the navel; its spirit is the infant, named Yuan Yang Zi, also called the Mysterious One below the valley. These three are one spirit. When wishing to restrain and control soul and po, first call their names in the Yin, imagining the three spirits as jade-colored golden light, with infant faces, the upper and middle two origins dressed in red, the lower origin in yellow, heads like newborn infants. When practising the Way and taking qi, one should also call their names.

The life gate is the navel; the mysterious pavilion is the passage of the originally born umbilical cord. Within is the life palace; in the palace is the great lord named Peach Boy, styled He Yan, wearing a vermilion kerchief and purple crown, seated at the life gate, the three soul spirits attending by his side. The great lord always holds the Heavenly Sovereign’s elephant talisman, to unite and direct original qi, supplement the fetus and restore the umbilical cord. At evening lying down, first hold breath twenty-four times, then heart invoke the great deity’s name three times, swallow saliva fifty times, strike teeth three times, and invoke:

> Fetal spirit great deity, sovereign elephant lord;  
> Hand holding umbilical talisman, head kerchief purple crown;  
> Yellow turning red, ascending to life gate,  
> Transforming spirit and returning to birth,  
> Six harmonies mutually influencing, form bright and lustrous,  
> Jade maiden dwelling within.

If constantly practised for eighteen years, the great lord will be able to excite the three fields on the left, govern the three qi on the right, the fields transform into flying chariots, the qi transforms into mysterious dragons, raising the twenty-four gods above, commanding the soul spirits below, calling the six yang officials, summoning the six yin assistants, with a thousand chariots and ten thousand riders, ascending by day to heaven. These are all the responses of Lord Peach. Though the Way be small, it is worthy of regard.

### The talisman for taking the Heavenly Sovereign’s elephant (missing talisman)

The Heavenly Sovereign talisman is entrusted to the life official great deity Peach Boy He Yan, to unite original upper qi, manage the umbilical cord, and circulate essence. Written in vermilion on green paper, to be taken on new moon and full moon nights, facing north. Hold talisman in left hand, hold breath, recite:

> Heavenly Emperor mysterious writing, sovereign elephant spirit talisman;  
> To unite original qi, circulate essence, restore the umbilical cord;  
> Ten thousand years infant, flying weary of the heavenly pivot;  
> Life palace great deity, wearing vermilion robe;  
> Head wearing purple crown, conspire with me.

Upon completion, swallow the talisman, then rise and bow twice. When taking the talisman, be on one’s bed.

If a Daoist practises the way of returning essence, turning yellow to red, morning essence nourishing life, pouring fluids, causing men and women to share cinnabar, face growing jade radiance, they should know the name of the great lord and take the Heavenly Sovereign talisman, thus attaining non-aging. If only practising without knowing the spirit name, returning essence without knowing how to take the talisman, not seeing the invocation, not understanding the palace where it dwells, though granted a thousand years of life, they return to the corpse of the Greater Yin, merely accumulating years of life, thus should return bones to the Three Officials.

When Daoists lie down and rest, think of the great lord, for the method of invocation and incantation, taking talisman on the new and full moons, to circulate the fetus essence for benefit; thus also becoming immortal, without troubling with the male and female returning and supplementing techniques. Yet controlling women for flying and soaring, returning qi to seek heavenly immortals, is more violent than water and fire, killing and attacking faster than axe and adze; unless one is someone of resigned heart embracing unity, one is likely to lose through it. If of middling ability and wishing to practise it, like swallowing a sword and wishing the throat to swallow without harm, how can it be obtained?

The life palace great deity forbids eating raw blood, burning six domesticated animals’ hair, burning garlic, onion skins and leaves, and various kinds of meat dishes; all disturb and disrupt the fetal qi, stink and injure the infant spirit; be cautious.

### The True Unity Scripture Formula

Take talisman sixteen times at each of the eight solar terms. On the first day of the first month, take the treasure talisman in blue.

One cun above the space between the eyebrows, entering three fen into the bone, left is the crimson terrace green chamber, right is the yellow threshold purple gate. Further in seven fen is the palace of the bright hall; the three spirits all sit facing outwards, wearing green brocade clothes. Further in one cun is the crimson chamber palace; the po soul spirit, all in red embroidered clothes. Further in one cun is the mud pellet palace. In the heart’s center is the crimson palace. Two cun five fen below the navel is the lower cun, entering three cun into the skin, within the cun is the cinnabar field palace.

The above are the head’s center platform, threshold, bright hall, bed chamber, mud pellet palace, and the heart, below the navel cinnabar field place.

Whether sitting, lying, walking, eating, or in joy and sorrow, gazing, one must preserve oneness. Keep the spirit as the shape of a newborn infant, making it appear in the palaces. The method of preservation imitates the palaces, each with a spirit, dressed according to the palace’s clothing. Next preserve the three spirits of the bright hall, the po soul form in the bed chamber. Next preserve the mud pellet, the crimson palace in the heart, the cinnabar field palace below the navel; all palaces have purple, blue, and crimson three qi mysterious smoke. Within the mud pellet palace purple qi is the Big Dipper’s seven stars covering the dipper; the ladle points forward; beneath the dipper are blue and crimson two qi; left is the infant, right is the Emperor Minister, all embroidered with splendid clothes. Next preserve the three qi smoke in the heart; left spirit pearl, right assistant sovereign, all in vermilion brocade clothes. Next preserve three qi of cinnabar field below the navel; left is infant, right is assistant minister, all yellow embroidered gauze clothes. At midnight, according to the month’s stem, after preservation, again preserve the purple qi of the mud pellet palace, issuing from between the eyebrows, like a large tendon, straight rising to the sky, light shining ninety thousand li; count this, there are ninety thousand ears. Next preserve the vermilion smoke in the heart, issuing from the heart’s front hollow, like a large tendon, straight rising to the sky, light shining thirty thousand li, making it within the purple qi. Next preserve the white qi of the cinnabar field below the navel, issuing from the navel, like a large tendon, straight rising to the sky, light shining seventy thousand li; also make it within the vermilion smoke; the light mixed of vermilion, purple, and white three qi shining. Preserve the three colors thoroughly, clear and distinct. After this, invoke:

> Purple gate and green chamber, there are two great spirits;  
> Calm and peaceful law kings, correct heart and strict method;  
> Hands holding flowing bells, body born of wind and clouds;  
> Brave guarding the true Way, not heeding external front;  
> Making me think and feel, opening and benefiting spiritual gates;  
> Entering and exiting completely beneficial, ascending the nine gates;  
> Seeing the nine truths, the Supreme Highest; [end invocation]

Then lie down, forgetting the body, closing eyes and preserving spirit. After three months, the spirit qi descends, appearing in the body; you should seek to fly as immortal.

The method of preserving truth and guarding oneness: clothing and shoes must not be borrowed from others, nor share a bed with others. When preserving oneness, always ascend the calendar, constantly knowing where the Heavenly Dipper points.

### On the night of the eighth day of the beginning of spring, facing east to sit, closing breath nine times, swallowing saliva thirty-five times, preserving the seven stars of the Heavenly Dipper slowly descending to my head top, the stars varying in size and indistinct, the ladle pointing forward, shining bright. Then preserve the palaces and spirits clearly, only not seeing qi surging to heaven. Then invoke the purple gate and green chamber as usual. After a while, the three palaces each produce one emperor spirit, suddenly appearing, entering my head top dipper; soon three palace ministers also appear, entering the top. The six gods of the dipper leader, in order supporting each other in flight formation, following the stars in front, going to the front heavenly gate star, all turning towards my mouth. After a while, I exhale one breath, the two upper origin gods come with the breath into the mouth, returning to the mud pellet palace; I exhale again, the two middle origin gods come with the breath into the mouth, returning to the lower cinnabar field palace. After preservation, invoke:

> Five directions command dipper, spirits summon seven stars;  
> Three lords condense and transform, ascending to summon purple spirits;  
> Six gods wander, Three Officials’ cinnabar city;  
> Profoundly connecting the great emperor, below the cavern yellow peace;

Then lie down forgetting the body, preserving thought.

Begin on eighth day of spring. On the midnight of beginning of summer, face south and preserve; beginning of autumn, midnight face west; beginning of winter, midnight face north.

Next preserve to see the po soul in the bed chamber wearing color; next preserve the mud pellet palace with the Big Dipper covering it; beneath the dipper two gods and heart and navel two palaces; altogether six gods and the po soul covering the dipper, all indistinctly appearing before me. Three emperors in front, po soul in the center; three ministers behind, together seven gods, riding on mud pellet covering dipper, each star corresponding to one god’s head pointing upwards, from the yang brightness beneath the purple qi, floating the dipper ascending to the heavenly yang brightness star, indistinctly existing in the purple palace; seven gods successively sitting, each swallowing purple qi thirty times, po soul also swallowing. After a while, seven gods together riding the covering dipper, descending along the purple qi, indistinctly returning to their palaces; clearly then invoke:

> Producing my five viscera, enabling me to attain truth, ascend flying Supreme Clarity;  
> Floating radiance seven origins, long life careful going,  
> Whistling command to a thousand spirits.

End, then lie down in confusion, preserving thought.

At summer solstice night, facing south, preserve the red origin star purple qi descending into my body, preserving seven gods riding the dipper, ascending to the northern pole star.

The above four solar terms and earth kings are the five dippers one; each eight nights preserving thought. The thought spirit invocation all follow the vernal equinox day; only diligent heart and focused thought.
