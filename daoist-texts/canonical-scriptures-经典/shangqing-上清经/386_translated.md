Secret Method of Practice within the Purple Court

Whosoever cultivates the Way and desires to attain long life and immortality must preserve the Three Primal Spirits and the abodes of the Three Primal Palaces. The Upper Primal Palace of the Mud Ball is situated three cun above between the two eyebrows; at the second cun there is opened a square of one cun — this is the Palace of the Elixir Field. Preserve its spirit, named Red Child, styled Guangyuanxian, also called Emperor Minister, clad in red robes. Preserve and imagine it present within the palace, calling its name thrice.

The Middle Primal Crimson Chamber is the heart; it lies one cun square in the centre of the heart, this is the Crimson Palace. Preserve its spirit within the palace; clothed in crimson garments, named the Perfected Man, styled Zidan Guangjian, call his name thrice.

The Lower Primal Elixir Field Palace lies three cun below the navel; at the navel enter three cun inward. Preserve its spirit within the palace; clothed in yellow robes, with a face white like a newborn infant, named Yuan Yang, styled Gu Xuan, call his name thrice.

After swallowing breath twenty-four times, call upon the Great Lord of the Birth Palace. The Life Gate is at the navel; the Mysterious Gate is the starting passage of the birth womb and intestines. Within it is the Birth Palace, one cun within the navel. In the palace is the Great Lord, named Tao Kang, styled He Jing Yan, clad in red robes, wearing a purple hibiscus crown, seated at the Life Gate. The Three Souls attend on his side, standing at the left. The Great Lord holds the emblematic talisman of the Heavenly Emperor; clasping it with both hands according to the inscription, to conjoin and concentrate the primal qi, to replenish the fetus and return to the womb.

At evening rest, first preserve the Three Palaces, then sitting, firmly grasp them; close the eyes and look inward. First hold the breath twenty-four times, still preserving the vision of the Great Lord seated outwardly, appearing as a babe, crowned and robed, holding the talisman, until clearly distinct; then in the heart call the Great Lord's name thrice: "Mysterious Gate Birth Palace Great Lord, named Tao Kang, styled He Jing Yan." Swallow saliva fifty times, knock teeth three times, and softly recite the incantation:

Great Spirit of the Fetus, Sovereign of the Imperial Cord, holding the embryonic talisman, head bound with purple crown, yellow turning and red revolving, the upper essence at the Life Gate, transforming spirit and returning life, the Six Harmonies mutually arise, the form and body shining bright, the Jade Maiden dwells within.

The right incantation, constantly finished, is the method of restraint. If one can constantly perform this for eighteen years, a thousand chariots and ten thousand riders, by day will ascend to heaven.

The Taiwei Emperor Heavenly Sovereign emblem talisman is as follows:

The right Heavenly Sovereign emblem talisman is entrusted to the Birth Palace Great God Tao Kang, styled He Jing Yan, to conjoin the primal upper qi, regulate the fetus, and conduct essence. Written in vermilion on blue paper, finely inscribed at the new and full moon nights, facing north for ingestion. Holding the talisman in the right hand, hold the breath, facing north burn incense; after writing the talisman, cut it in order, stacking and holding it; then close the eyes and breath, preserve the Great Lord as before, then in the heart recite:

Heavenly Emperor Mysterious Book, Imperial Emblem Spirit Talisman, to conjoin the primal qi, conduct essence and return to the womb, ten thousand years a babe, flying immortal at the Celestial Pivot, Birth Palace Great God, unfolding the book and erecting vermilion, head wearing purple crown, deliberating with me.

When finished, rise and bow twice; then successively swallow each talisman in a pellet form. Preserve the Great Lord, holding the talisman in the left hand; then face north and bow to the Taiwei Heavenly Lord. The scripture says: preserving the Great Lord’s talisman and ingesting it for eighteen years, the Lord will be able to activate the three fields on the left, govern the three qi on the right; the fields transform into a flying chariot, the qi into a mysterious dragon; commanding twenty-four spirits above and directing the souls below; calling the Yang officials of the six Jia, summoning the Yin officials of the six Ding, a thousand chariots and ten thousand riders, by daylight ascending to heaven — these are all the manifestations of Lord Tao. Though the Way be small, it is also worthy of regard. The Birth Palace Great God cautions against menstrual defilement, burning the hair of the six domestic animals, the beard and other substances; these all suppress disruptive fetal qi, preventing self-injury to the infant spirit.

The Three Souls depart the human body three times in a month — on the third, thirteenth, and twenty-third days. The spirits wander, dreams are unreal; evil qi desires to invade the person. At such times, one must restrain and confine. The method is to lie down supine, stretch both feet long, place both hands one upon the other upon the heart, left hand above; knock teeth thrice, swallow breath thrice, close eyes and imagine a single red qi shining within the heart, bright as a chick’s egg, rising from the heart upward, dispersing from both eyes outward, gradually enlarging until encompassing the whole body, down to the feet and up to the head; transforming into a great fire, refining the whole body, like burning charcoal. Suddenly feeling a slight warmth over the four limbs, knock the teeth thrice again, call the three souls’ names: Shuang Ling, Fetal Light, and Hidden Essence. The three spirits hasten to remain: Shuang Ling is at the Mysterious Gate, attending the Great Lord on the left, guarding with the right hand the soul; Fetal Light is at the Meditation Chamber Palace, facing the Yellow Old Lord’s Red Child, guarding the Mud Ball; Hidden Essence is in the heart, under the heart’s governance. Each at its proper place, call them, then recite the incantation:

Taiwei Mysterious Palace, Central Yellow begins blue, inner refining of the Three Souls, Fetal Light at peace, spirit treasure jade chamber, lives with me; no reckless movement, the reflector is most spiritual; if desiring to fly, only allowed by Supreme Ultimate of Highest Purity; if thirsty or hungry, only receive returning water and jade essence. When finished, forget the body long. First practice all the lying down preservations; then proceed with this; breath out and sleep.

The Seven Po descend thrice a month from the person — on the seventh, seventeenth, and twenty-seventh nights. When the souls depart, they cause dreams to be confused and inverted. The disciple of the Way must strictly restrain and not let the souls wander. At those times, lying down, place the hands with fixed fingers behind the head pillow; stretch the legs long; imagine two white qi at the nose tip, first emerging from the lungs through both nostrils, as small as beans, gradually enlarging, encircling the body ninefold, down to the feet, up to the head. The white qi suddenly transforms into heavenly beasts, first inwardly changing to make the two Azure Dragons in the pupils of the eyes; also imagine two White Tigers in the nostrils, all facing outward; Vermilion Bird upon the heart, facing the mouth, bowing the head drawing in breath, drawing near the mouth; Azure Dragon and Tortoise beneath the left foot, Spirit Snake beneath the right foot — these together form the Mysterious Warrior, who treads upon the feet as sandals. Also imagine two Jade Maidens in the ears, clad in dark brocade robes, standing at the Life Gate, holding two torches; radiant light to the utmost, the left named Tender Maiden, the right named Spirit Ceremony; their aura each changes ninefold. After a while all is complete; again swallow saliva seven times, knock teeth seven times, call the seven po names: Corpse Dog, Hidden Arrow, Sparrow Shade, Swallowing Thief, Not Poison, Removing Defilement, Stinking Lung. First preserve the seven po at the Life Gate, standing by the Great Lord’s right side, guarded by the First Soul Shuang Ling, immovable. After calling them, softly recite:

Nine cycles of pure qi, restrain the po evil and fierce, heavenly beasts guard the gate, tender maiden holds the pass, soul and po harmonized and gentle, be at peace with me; no reckless movement; observe the original form; if hungry or thirsty, listen and drink moonlight and sun elixir. All finished, forget the body long, then sleep.

The disciple of the Way should reverence the heart and true nature, bow and give thanks. At the day of the Autumn Equinox, preserve thoughts, recall the true, fast and abstain; do not think of evil, and wish to fly as immortal. If fasting long, at the Autumn Equinox give thanks to the seven ancestors and grandparents, next preserve all the body’s faults and ask to reform, pledging an oath. Those not truly severed from the dust of the world should beware to not give thanks at the Autumn Equinox. This day’s thanks are all released, but must not be transgressed again. If one reckons that some matters cannot be escaped or removed, do not rashly say thanks. The scripture says: "If a child wishes to learn the Way, beware the Autumn Equinox; no matter the matter great or small, all are reported above." At mid-day on this day enter a room facing north, burn incense, kneel and bow long, remove the kerchief and lay it on the ground, softly recite:

So-and-so of such prefecture and county, small omen Perfected Man, above open to the Most High and Holy Supreme Jade Morning Mysterious Emperor Supreme Taoist Lord, Golden Gate Peaceful Jade Morning Mysterious Supreme Origin Taoist Lord, Golden Gate Four Assistants and Twenty-four Perfected Men, Supervisors of Fate and Divine Officials. First thank the seven ancestors and grandparents, then all the body; make the farewell sincere and earnest, bow and knock the forehead and chest, bow again. Then first wear the kerchief, then rise and bow again.

If having good dreams upon waking, rub the eyes twenty-seven times, quickly close the eyes, rub outward from within with the palms of both hands, knock teeth twenty-seven times, softly recite:

Most High Supreme Essence, Three Emperor Elixir Spirits, Crimson Palace bright and clear, auspicious response to informing, Three Primal Gentle Souls, Heavenly Emperor grants the scripture, all directions harmonize, flying immortal Highest Purity, always with Jade True, together meeting in the Purple Court.

If often encountering evil dreams, immediately close eyes and breath, with left hand pinch the philtrum twenty-seven times, then with second and third fingers pinch the mountain source, yin-pinching several tens of times, then press urgently, tap teeth twenty-seven times, hold breath as before, tap teeth, softly recite:

Great Cavern True Mystery, open and refine the Three Souls; the First Soul quickly guards the Seven Po; the Second Soul quickly guards the Mud Ball; the Third Soul receives the heart’s governance. Above open to the Most High Three Primal Lords. So-and-so Jia has met ominous dreams, these are the Seven Po wandering corpses coming to assist the evil source; quickly summon Tao Kang to protect life, report to the Emperor Lord, Five Elders and Nine Perfected, each guarding bodily gates, Yellow Gate Divine Master, Purple Gate General, holding axe and bell, destroy evil spirits, turn harm to good, life and death have no connection.

Again lying down, auspicious responses must be obtained; after three years, only by divine inspiration will there be dreams.

Whenever lying down to rest at night, immediately close eyes, knock and swallow nine times each; next press the sides of the nose up and down several tens of times; then softly recite:

Most High Four Bright, Nine Gates emit essence, ears and eyes mysteriously clear, communicate truth and attain spirit, platform in heaven, flow of qi adjusted and level, Tender Maiden Cloud Ceremony, eye children intelligent and bright, splendid understanding thoroughly clear, hundreds of degrees subtle clear, preserve harmony Upper Origin, lingering about Nine Cities, Five Viscera plant roots, ears and eyes self-born, heavenly platform luxuriant white, pillars and beams unyielding; Seven Po bathe and refine, Three Souls at peace, Red Child carries the radiance, always with me, covering my ears and eyes; Most High before me strike with flowing bell, ten thousand evils vanish, wishes must be fulfilled, sun and moon guard the gate, heart stores the Five Stars, True Emperor blesses, all sounds respectfully listen, auspicious with mysterious response, good omens clarify.

When finished the blessing, again swallow saliva nine times, rub and wipe face and eyes causing slight warmth. Always practice the lying down blessing without missing a single rest. This makes ears and eyes bright, strong in memory and clarity, nose regulated and level, no spitting of saliva, face with youthful countenance, controlling souls refining po, repelling thousands of evils, dispelling myriad demons.

Hair cutting should be done facing the direction of the King; forbidden to cut hair facing north. In the eleventh month, better to face Chen or Hai. After the first combing, recite:

Great Emperor scatters spirits, Five Elders return to truth, Mud Ball mysterious brilliance, preserve essence and long existence; left is the hiding sun, right is the root of the moon, Six Harmonies clear refinement, hundreds of spirits receive grace.

When finished, swallow saliva thrice. Count changes of combing many times, not causing pain, blood not stagnant, roots of hair always strong.

When taking immortality medicine, always take it on the birth day; do not associate with death, mourning, calamity, or violate and harm the fetal spirit, otherwise mere ingestion is useless.

Before meals, do not speak of death or dying, do not expose food; evil qi gathers.

When bathing, always preserve the Six Ding, so that all directions are as wished. Usually preserve the Ding days within sixty days; bathing also as usual. Bathing many times, always on the Jiazi day one should bathe; if not, then after several new moons, to make the spirit clear. This is called the wondrous; it is only the first and fifth months. Best to take east flowing water, make fragrant broth, so the tower need not worry about frequency; but cannot use it to cleanse ear, to wash away corpse odor and true qi to come. Beware not to sit bathing to loosen the form, nor sit in the water.

If stepping on filth or various unclean places, then bathe and wash off with the method of loosening the form to remove it. The method uses ten liang of fresh bamboo leaves, four liang of peach bark, one hu of clear water; boil until boiling, then cool to warm and bathe with it; all filth is removed.

The Northern Emperor’s method of killing ghosts: at the closing of the eyes, grasp firmly, hold breath, and imagine seeing the true spirits of the viscera, that is, the spirits of the five organs. Seeing only the five organs, their response is divine; also may be called the Four Spirits and Yellow Dragon. First knock teeth thirty-six times, then recite: "Heavenly Peng, Heavenly Peng, cloud cloud."

There are low men who forcibly hate ghosts, often appear as women to beguile and test men, and can also transform into male form; not only are they women. If such are seen, immediately close breath, think of the Middle Support Star of the Heavenly Pass, preserve the Dipper Star, its assisting image guarding the inch; with the ladle finger point before the embodied spirit, preserve and guard the Bright Hall Three Palaces, Five Viscera, Twenty-four Spirits; set face and fix mind, carefully observe the spirit pearl in the middle of the rule, if turbid and unclear, then seeing is ghost’s test. Also may use a mirror to closely examine; if known as ghost’s test, then think of the Seven Stars before the face, also may place them on the head to dispel, called preserving Kui covering the head, using ladle finger. Also recite the Heavenly Peng incantation, still preserving being struck down by the Heavenly Cord. May also recite the Kill Ghost incantation. If the rule middle is square and clear, it is a Taoist Perfected Man; though not exactly square and clear cold, it is a person of difference. Fire and sun shining with no shadow, more proof. The enlightened will instantly bow; the unenlightened fail the test. If encountering an evil ghost and calling it a Perfected Man, this is also a failure — be cautious.

Baopuzi says: Entering famous mountains to seek zhicao (divine herbs), in the months of the third and ninth, this mountain opens, the month when divine immortal herbs appear. Do not enter on the day of mountain scars, but only on the day and time of Heaven’s Assistance; three wonders meet then especially auspicious. From "Three Wonders Announcement." When arriving at the mountain, need six Yin days and the time of the Bright Hall; carry the spirit talisman, lead a white dog, hold a white chicken, with one sheng of salt, and the mountain opening talisman written on great stone; must obtain zhicao. Also when gathering and taking zhicao, desire the day of royal minister harmony; the stems and branches mutually generate is best. This zhicao is often found in many mountains; but ordinary people with coarse Way-heart, evil intention, thin virtue, not knowing the art of mountain entry, though obtaining the plan, not knowing the appearance, will never succeed in getting it. Mountains, great or small, all have ghosts and spirits; not given to man in zhicao, then though exposed, cannot be seen.

Baopuzi says: According to "Secret Records of the Nine Heavens," and mountain entry taboos, must take the suitable great day. All mountain entry days in large months avoid the 3rd, 11th, 15th, 18th, 24th, 30th; in small months avoid 1st, 5th, 13th, 16th, 28th, 26th. Entering the mountain on these days, tested by mountain spirits, the sought not obtained, works fail. Not only Taoists, but common people entering the mountain on these days meet misfortune, encountering tigers, wolves, and poisonous insects. Entering the mountain without the proper day must have its proof; do not lightly enter the mountain.

Also according to "Jade Bell Scripture": Entering famous mountains one must know the secret art of hiding the Jia (a divination method), not to be falsely explained to others. The Lingbao text also states: in mountain entry must have the protective day, and the auxiliary day; if the special day is taken, very auspicious; controlling days and cutting days cause death; not one or two Taoist ways. I have had some mountain entries, from this reason learned the book of hiding the Jia, with over sixty scrolls; its matters cannot be thoroughly detailed, so collect its essentials as a ready pouch, but do not transmit by writing. Now briefly discussing its comparison, those desirous of entering the mountain should seek those who know it; such are not lacking in the world.

"Seven Primal Middle Scripture" says: To seek the Way, use days and times within heaven; to strike ghosts and demons, employ talisman and writing, using days and times of heavenly birds; entering the mountain to keep all evil beasts, wolves, tigers, and thieves from approaching, use Heavenly Store and Earth Gate; the six Gui days are Heavenly Store, six Si days Earth Gate.

Also says: In chaotic times, severing borders, enter the mountain so as to have no worry or trouble; use the upper primal Dingmao day, a day of Yin virtue and time, can conceal and sink away. Called the sun sinking on land, sun and moon without light, men and ghosts cannot see.

Also says: To seek immortals and learn the Way entering famous mountains, use six Gui days and times, also called Heavenly Heart day, surely to be saved from the world.

Also says: When going into the mountain forest, take with the left hand the upper green dragon object, break in half and place under the Peng Star, pass the Bright Hall, enter the Yin, step the Yu step and recite: "Commander of the Great Nose, Taiyin, open only to my great-grandson Jia, do not open to outsiders; those who see Jia will think him kindling, those who do not see Jia will say he is not human." Then break the held grass and place at the Earth Gate; take soil with left hand and pass to the philtrum; right hand hold grass to cover oneself; left foot steps forward, step the Yu step; arrive beneath Six Gui, hold breath and stay; no man or ghost can see. The Six Jia are the Azure Dragon and Peng Star; Six Bing is the Bright Hall; Six Ding the Yin. The Yu step method is: stand straight with right foot forward, left foot behind; then step forward again, bringing left foot alongside right is one step; forward left foot, forward right foot alongside left is two steps; again left foot, again right foot alongside right is three steps; such is the Yu step method. All creating the hundred monsters under heaven know the Yu step; not only for this matter.

This is the Completion and Fulfillment hexagram; the first and second traces are not in the nine traces count, yet mutually follow one step of seven feet, three steps of two zhang one chi, looking at the nine traces Yu step is exhausted.

Baopuzi says: The Lingbao's so-called protective day means days when the heavenly stem and earthly branch upper generates lower. Such as Jiawu and Yisi days. Jia is wood, Wu is fire; Yi also wood, Si also fire; fire is born of wood. The so-called auxiliary day means the earthly branch lower generates the upper. Such as Renshen and Guiyou days. Ren is water, Shen is metal; Gui also water, You also metal; water is born of metal. The so-called controlling day means stem upper overcomes lower day. Such as Wuzhi and Jihai days. Wu is earth, Zi is water; Ji also earth, Hai also water; earth overcomes water according to the Five Elements. The so-called cutting day means lower stem overcomes upper day. Such as Jiashen and Yiyou days. Jia is wood, Shen is metal; Yi wood, You metal; metal overcomes wood. Following this to extend, all may be known.

Baopuzi says: Entering famous mountains, use Jiazi beginning day, hang five-coloured silks each five cun long upon great stones; what is sought surely obtained.

Baopuzi says: Entering mountains should know the secret incantation of the Six Jia. The incantation says: "The commanders of the soldiers and fighters arrayed march forward." Always secretly recite these nine words; all will be repelled. The essence of the Way is not troublesome; this is what is meant.

One method right thus, mostly the same with slight difference.

This is the Yellow Lord’s Forty-nine True Talismans of the Fetus in the Yellow Court. If wishing to enter mountain forests, on Jiazi Yín day write in cinnabar white silk, place at night on the table facing the Big Dipper, offer wine and dried meat, recite name and surname, bow twice, take and tuck into the collar. To repel the mountain’s hundred ghosts and myriad spirits, tigers, wolves, and poisonous insects. The Taoist who avoids the world and enters mountains and forests also uses this method.

First Talisman

Second Talisman

Third Talisman

These three talismans are all Yellow Lord’s mountain dwelling talismans. Written in cinnabar on peach wood tablets, enlarging the inscriptions to fill the tablet, place on doors four sides and four corners, also at important places on the roadside. Within fifty paces of dwelling, repel mountain spirits and hundred ghosts with efficacy.

These two talismans are Yellow Lord’s mountain entry talismans. Can be affixed upon beams and pillars inside the house. Common people living in mountains and forests, or temporarily entering mountains, may use these talismans, double-sided with such inscriptions.

These two talismans, double-sided, both with such inscriptions, were received by the immortal Chen Anshi, to repel tigers and wolves upon mountain entry. Written in cinnabar on silk, two distinct talismans, to be worn behind the elbow, men on the left, women on the right; may also be worn as pendants; may be placed on the four sides of the dwelling on tablets. If moving residence, must remove the talismans.

These two talismans are the Yellow Lord’s seals for repelling hundred snakes and tigers and wolves. Carved on jujube wood cores two cun long, bow twice and wear; they have divine efficacy. Those common people who believe may all wear them, greatly auspicious.

These three talismans may also be placed on the left, right, front and back of ox and horse stables, and pig pens, to repel tigers and wolves.

The secret essentials of the Purple Court are indeed the cultivation art of the Yellow Lord Laozi. It must not be transmitted falsely to unworthy persons, lest harm flow to ancestral investigations; utmost caution is advised.
