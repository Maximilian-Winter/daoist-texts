## Scripture of Superior Purity on the Methods of Cultivation

### Method One: Restraining the Three Souls

Taken from the Superior Scripture *Ling Shu Zi Wen*.

The Daoist should first examine and restrain the souls and spirits, eliminate the corpse ghosts; always on the days of new moon and full moon, and on the days Gengshen and Jiayin, one should purify oneself, enter the chamber, bathe away dust and dirt, seat oneself properly, and it is better to remain awake. Using a genuine cinnabar brush, one dots beneath the left eye-corner; using an orpiment brush, one dots beneath the right nostril, letting a small amount enter the grain husk to wrap it. When finished, one knocks the teeth thrice in succession and utters the prayer:

> Two luminaries entwine and fly, cinnabar and orpiment scatter like smoke, Qi seizes the void and evil, the corpse filth sinks and vanishes, harmonize the soul and refine the spirit, unite the form with the great deity, grant me immortality, longevity ever complete, clarity and thorough vision, lasting prosperity, profit, uprightness.

When finished, knock the teeth thrice again, swallow saliva thrice, then with the right hand’s second finger pinch beneath the left eye-corner, and with the left hand’s second finger pinch beneath the right nostril, each seven times. Press down without raising the hand on the yin side; thus all is complete. Pressing these two places is the gateway of the seven spirits’ wandering corpses, the ford of evil spirits and thieves; thus by receiving the essence of cinnabar and orpiment, the path of corpse ghosts is stopped, and the two luminaries’ incense extinguishes the licentious and disorderly Qi. This is the supreme method of the Great Ultimate; if constantly practiced, the souls and spirits will be peaceful and harmonious, corpse filth dispersed and destroyed, one will become an immortal deity with spiritual clarity and thorough sight. Practiced for three years, both color and thought vanish. This day is called the day of competition of corpses and ghosts; men and women must not sit together at the same seat—be cautious.

When one refines the taste of the Supreme Dao and recites the Divine Scriptures, every ten or twenty words, lick the lips and swallow saliva thrice; every hundred or fifty words, knock the teeth two or three times, summon spirits and assemble the numinous, harmonize and calm the blood and Qi, make the spiritual ford full and condensed, the emperor’s single dwelling; thus the Qi of the middle is not labored, it grows dim but is not lost.

No Daoist should weep tears or leak fluids; this causes loss of fluids and leakage of the ford, exhausting throat and brain. Hence the perfected Daoist often practices inhalation and exhalation, swallowing tastes to harmonize the six liquids.

The Daoist should constantly keep in mind his own form and appearance, making it such as if the sun and moon were before him, so that the face always shines with the light of sun and moon, illuminating the form; let the sun be on the left, the moon on the right, at nine inches from the face. When finished, peck the teeth thrice in succession and pray:

> Primordial Supreme Truth, twin luminaries and two mysteries, right restrains seven spirits, left restrains three souls, let my spirit and brightness ever abide with the form.

When finished, knock the teeth thrice and seven times in succession, swallow saliva seven times; this is called the emperor’s method of preserving form, restraining souls, and controlling spirits, making one wise and immortal, long-living and deathless. If one cannot pray, one may simply keep this.

On the third and thirteenth evenings of the month, at this time three souls are unstable, the bright spirits float and wander, the embryonic light casts forth the form, the shadowy spirits disturb and call. These bright spirit, embryonic light, and shadowy spirit are the three lords of the three souls. On such evenings they abandon the body to roam, swiftly leaving the home chamber, some are detained by other souls or external ghosts, some are seized by demons, some fail to return, separating from the form and releasing the essence. Sometimes they offend the external souls, the two Qi contend, all turbulent and competitive as infants, causing alien thoughts, coming and going without form, the heart sorrowful and the mind oppressed. Students should all restrain and detain them so they do not roam at will. The method of restraint: lie peacefully facing upward, place a pillow under the head, stretch out the feet, cross the palms on the breast, close the eyes and hold the breath for three breaths, knock the teeth thrice in succession. The mind stores a red Qi like a small chicken’s egg; from within look upward, issuing from the eyes; from the eyes issue the red Qi, expanding and covering the body in nine layers, flowing downward and around the body, reaching the head and nape, transforming into fire, burning the body throughout, making the inside and outside thorough, like glowing charcoal. When all is complete, one should feel a slight warmth in the body, then knock the teeth thrice and thrice again, and call the three souls by name: bright spirit, embryonic light, shadowy spirit; the three souls quickly settle. Then softly pray:

> Supreme Mysterious Palace, central yellow begins blue, within refine the three souls, embryonic light be peaceful, divine treasure jade chamber, live with me, do not act rashly, the mirror is too spiritual; if wishing to fly, only may visit the Great Ultimate Superior Purity; if wishing hunger or thirst, only may drink the returning water jade essence.

All is complete.

### Method Two: Restraining the Seven Spirits

Also taken from the *Zi Wen Jing*.

On new moon, full moon, and last day of the month, at this time the seven spirits roam, wandering filthy and turbid, sometimes communicating with blood and flesh, going to ghosts and demons, sometimes related to dead corpses, sometimes licentious infants, gathering to plot treason and attack houses, sometimes reporting men’s crimes to the Three Officials and River God, sometimes turning into mischievous spirits causing disgust, sometimes ghosts enter the body and call evil to kill essence. All residual diseases in men are the fault of spirits. Joy in men’s death is the nature of spirits. Desire for men’s ruin is the sickness of spirits. The Daoist should restrain and discipline them, refine and transform them, suppress and stop them, seize and awe them. The first spirit is called Corpse Dog, the second Fushi, the third Sparrow Shade, the fourth Swallow Thief, the fifth Rank Poison, the sixth Remove Filth, the seventh Stinking Lung; these are the yin names of the seven spirits, the turbid ghosts within the body. The method of restraining and examining: cross the hands behind the nape, hold breath seven times, knock the teeth seven times in succession, hold at the nose tip a white Qi like a small bean, gradually enlarging to cover the body in nine layers, down to the feet and up to the head. When complete, the white Qi suddenly transforms into heavenly beasts: two blue dragons at the two eyes, two white tigers at the two nostrils, all facing outward; the Vermilion Bird above the heart, facing the mouth; the Azure Turtle beneath the left foot; the Spiritual Snake beneath the right foot; in the two ears are jade maidens, dressed in dark brocade garments, at the ear gates; each hand grasps firelight. After a while all is complete, then swallow saliva seven times, knock teeth seven times, call the names of the seven spirits. When finished softly pray:

> White Qi circles nine times, restrain spirits and evil, heavenly beasts guard the gates, lovely maidens hold the passes, refine spirits harmoniously, be peaceful with me, do not act rashly, watch and observe the root of form; if you hunger or thirst, permit drink of moon-yellow, sun-red elixir.

All is complete. Thus the seven spirits are closed within, mutually guarding and restrained. If constantly practiced, the turbid spirits vanish downward, returning to goodness, dwelling in the form harmoniously with the Three Officials, and united with the Primordial Spirit.

### Method Three: Dispelling Evil Dreams

Taken from the Superior Scripture *Ci Yi Wu Lao Jing*.

He who often encounters evil dreams: first is the White Demon; second is heart’s trial; third is corpse thief. The method to dispel and consume them: upon waking from such a dream, twist the Ren-zhong point with the left hand twenty-seven times; peck the teeth twenty-seven times in succession; and softly pray:

> Great cavern true mystery, expand and refine the three souls; the first soul hastens to guard the seven spirits; the second soul hastens to guard the Mud Pill; the third soul receives the heart’s command; hasten to call the Three Primary Lords of Tai Su; when meeting an ill-omened dream, it is the seven spirits wandering corpses coming to aid, the source of myriad evils; swiftly summon Taokang to protect life, report above to the Emperor Lord, the Five Elders and Nine Truths, all guard the body’s gates; the Yellow Gate Divine Master, the Purple Gate General, holding iron and ringing bells, annihilate evil spirits, change calamity into auspiciousness; life and death without cause.

When finished, if one lies down again, one will surely obtain good response; and the evil dream Qi which produced it will be shut beneath the Heavenly Pass. After three years, only divine response and appropriate reply remain; thus one dreams with knowledge and vision, seeing what is to come with clarity; no more evil omens and ominous imaginings. If at night one meets a good dream and the heart feels it good, it is a good response. Upon waking, one should rub the eyes twenty-seven times, peck the teeth twenty-seven times in succession, and softly pray:

> Supreme High Essence, Three Emperors’ Dan Spirit, Vermilion Palace shining bright, auspicious response revealing affairs; the Three Primaries guard spirits; the Heavenly Emperor imparts the scripture; wherever it goes all harmonize; flying immortals of Superior Purity; always with the Jade Truth; jointly meet in the Purple Court.

All is complete. This is a great mysterious secret method, passed on to those first crossing the river of existence.

Huge beasts with heavy mouths, gutting bellies, slaughtering livers; divine lords and messengers guard and defend the camp; yellow-robed soldiers cut down demon spirits, behead a thousand demons, crush and overthrow the wicked and traitorous; wipe out their kindred and species; order them to be utterly destroyed; by the Jade Emperor’s supreme command, cleanse and purge the Three Primaries.

Also taken from the *Forty-four Directions Scripture*.

When finished, knock the teeth thirty-six times again.

---

### Method Eight: Refining Prayers for Dead Corpses

Taken from Superior Scripture *Qing Yao Zi Shu Jin Gen Jing*.

The Zi Shu formula says: whoever cultivates the superior purity Dao, when the parents, uncles, brothers of the body pass away in the world, the body has not yet utterly disappeared; therefore among men, if a corpse is lying dead, on the third day one should take a basin of clear water, throw in one tael of real pearls, stand facing south in the middle courtyard towards the water, knock the teeth nine times in succession, and pray:

> Qi transforms into spirit; corpse changes and enters mystery; three transformations and five bodies ascend into the nine heavens; the tribulation of the nine heavens, again undergo the Jia body; the Jia body again transforms, and one obtains the status of the perfected person.

When finished, men who die think of three jade boys; women who die think of seven jade maidens. Take the water and pour it over the dead corpse; when done, wash hands and face with the water, look to the sky and spit thrice; then softly pray:

> The heavenly Qi is now clear, man’s transformation born; obtain birth in the upper heaven, nine transformations changing form; five sufferings and three hells, sever and drop the name of death; transcend and deliver the sorrowful soul; return to the Southern Court; cease.

Thus the departed person obtains new transformation, born in the nine heavens above; after nine years they obtain ascent to the Palace of Jade Purity. This method is more wondrous than the Great Cavern’s method of transmigration of the Seven Ancestors, the secret of the Jade Emperor, not to be transmitted to the untrue. There is a golden named Emperor Map and green-worded purple script; if one obtains this text, do not lightly use or indiscreetly disclose it to others; the Seven Ancestors and Parents long close the ghost officials; three hells and five sufferings, ten thousand tribulations will not be reversed. According to the Four Extremes bright section, every seven hundred years there is a perfected person to receive transmission.

> Once withered again flourishing, once extinguished again born; obtain birth in upper heaven; again receive the Supreme Spirit; tribulation of nine heavens, repeated fetal and infant transformations; filth and burdens vanish; white corpse reborn.

When the Zi encounters twenty-four steps of refinement prayers, merit is full and virtue increased; the name is recorded in Superior Purity; after twenty-four years one may ride the spiritual wheel and fly through the Nine Mysterious.

If the paper is yellow and moist, very auspicious; if blue, there is a dead spirit beneath; if white, ill-omened; if red, terror and alarm; if black, there is treasure; if purple, one obtains immortality.

### Method Nineteen: Method of Self Massage by the Daoist

The Daoist’s method for self-massage of head and face, seeking the Dao essentials, is first to clear the eyes and sharpen the ears, as these are the masters of affairs. The ears and eyes are the ladder of seeking truth, the gate of gathering spirit; gaining and losing is determined there; life and death must be known and distinguished; great scrolls show them; they may be applied.

Press the little points behind the two eyebrows thirty-nine times, then with palms and fingers massage below the eyes and above the cheekbones, then rotate the ears thirty times with the hand; next, rub backward over the forehead thirty-nine times; at the mouth swallow saliva innumerable times. If practiced constantly, ears and eyes will be clear and bright. Secretly do this at the Ren-zhong point, do not speak of the appearance. Next place both hands on the four sides of the head, smooth the hair toward the crown, as much as possible; this causes the head’s blood to flow and disperse, wind-dampness not to congeal. When finished, press the eyes’ four corners twenty-nine times, feeling the vision clear and bright; this is the method to examine the spirit of the eye, commonly practiced, gaining sight of myriad spirits.

When prayer finished, lie down; response will surely come; you yourself will know the goodness or otherwise in your heart, and judge if suitable to transmit.

---

### Method Twenty-one: Jade Emperor’s Prayer to Guard Spirits

Taken from *Forty-four Directions Scripture*.

The Jade Emperor prays:

> The Nine Heavens have command, above uphold Jade Purity, hasten to summon thousands of truths, all gather at the imperial court; Taiyi inspects below, double emperors winged forms, inspecting and discerning myriad evils; regulate Qi and preserve life; if any ill omen, intervene to test divine spirit; the path of the Green Emperor arranges and marshals divine troops; seven gods bear axes; heaven’s spear right expedition; wield swords at the forefront; blaze and throw fire bells; command armored steeds; martial soldiers and heavenly Ding fight with wind and fire; attack evil and bind essence; above awe and below restrain demon spirits; both awe and restrain; myriad evils destroyed in form; divine halberd sweeps lightning; wicked demons have no birth; immortal emperor holds command; if one dares to stop obeying, it is to be punished; all warned and cautious; protect this yellow tranquility; nine heavens report command; myriad gods respectfully listen.

When finished.

If the Zi is afraid and startled during night walking, heart trembling and mind fearful, or when evil dreams occur and demons try man, infringe the true dry Qi and wish to cause sickness and harm, quickly perform the Jade Emperor’s prayer to guard spirits. The Zi should keep the supreme Dao in mind, seek aid from Taiyi, then face north, knock teeth thirty times, hold breath and carefully pray; when prayer finished, knock teeth again as above, swallow saliva ten times; thus wickedness is destroyed and crushed, demon hordes subdued, seven gods intertwined, Taiyi inspects and oversees, myriad spirits defend truth, externally awe evil Qi. This may be chanted daily, with loud clear recitation, sitting or lying freely, to block the coming of a hundred evils and close the traces of wicked ghosts. When lying down to sleep, one may also often recite it, making spirit peaceful and mind clear, dispelling dreams and disgust, eliminating poisons and evils, making one never fear for life. On days of chanting and practice, there is no need to face north or hold breath. The holding breath secret prayer means the demons have tried the left and right, spirits have infringed the spirit chamber, thus commanding true spirits to collect their evil traces. The sleeping prayer is not the same as this method.

---

### Method Twenty-two: Daoist’s Method of Knocking Teeth and Regulating

In all Superior Purity knocking teeth and swallowing saliva methods, each has its manner and sequence, not to be confused or mixed, lest the true spirits become confused. Knocking teeth commands the spirit; swallowing Qi harmonizes the truth. Absorb and harmonize Qi, swallow the six liquids, to operate and enter to control the spirit; one must beat drum and arrange ranks properly.

Whenever preserving and cultivating the superior method, in ceremony and prayer, always first peck the teeth, knocking upper and lower teeth against each other; not left and right. One breath in and out to swallow Qi and liquids. This is called calling spirit and harmonizing truth, to seek to ascend to immortality. The knocking of teeth upper and lower is called heavenly drum; knocking left teeth against each other is called heavenly bell; knocking right teeth against each other is called heavenly chime. To control ghosts and summon demons, one may knock bell and chime; to cultivate the Dao and seek truth, knock heavenly drum.

### Method Twenty-three: Daoist’s Prayer upon Hearing Ear Ringing

Taken from Superior Scripture *Da You Miao Jing*.

When one hears ringing in the ears, cross hands to cover ears, and pray:

> Infant in the palace, nine truths in the chamber; please listen to the divine command, also discern ill omen; Taiyi flowing fire, to destroy myriad evils.

When finished, cover the ear gate with the hand seventeen times; then one should feel warmth on the face, a good sign. If one hears coldness between the head and neck, evil Qi has entered. One should quickly lie down facing upward, keep the mysterious Dan palace Taiyi true lord in mind, use the flow of fire’s bell to shine and throw it, causing the evil Qi to immediately exit the ear, the firelight also following behind, shining brightly illuminating the whole body; after a long while calmness returns.

---

### Method Twenty-four: Method to Discern Effectiveness of Ear Ringing

Also from *Da You Miao Jing*.

If suddenly one hears rushing water, thunder, lightning, or drum ringing in the ear, it means the body is laboring, the heart store is greatly damaged, unable to taste true infusion of life, and indulging in disorder, causing the six organs to lose control; souls and spirits wail; this portends disease and death. Thus the Mud Pill loses its order, nine palaces are irregular, sorrowful scratching, confusion and disorder, drumming wildly, about to write off its residence and abandon the body. Those who hear it should focus the mind and turn away from confusion, concentrate the true heart; if the fault is not deep, they will hear and correct. This is why deafness occurs—the ear spirit is lost. If suddenly one hears golden sound or jade tone in the ear, true Qi is coming in, the Dao wishes to be fulfilled. If sudden sound of string music is heard, the six Ding and jade maidens come to guard the Dao child. One should be quiet and diligently cultivate the path practiced, the more diligent the heart the more it surpasses past. Perfected beings thereby increasingly appear in form; if not your master, do not speak to others.

If one hears flute and horn sounds, this is a good omen of noble arrival. If one hears shouting and crying, this is a bad omen of downfall. If there is foul smell, there must be decay and filth; quickly bathe, burn incense, and sweep the sleeping chamber; this is the Jade Emperor warning and admonishing men.

If one hears blood Qi, or suddenly sees pooling blood without cause, this is a sign of warfare and misfortune; quickly escape the world, keep the Three Primaries emperor lords in mind, seek aid; hide in fasting for three months; calamity will also cease. These are all the emperor lords first informing men of good and evil, to cause awe and caution concerning their fortunes and misfortunes. When seeing ill omens, one should practice secret virtue, engage in kindness and rescue, things men cannot do, travelers cannot accomplish, thereby escaping
