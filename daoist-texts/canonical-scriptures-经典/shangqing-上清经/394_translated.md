Secret Method of the Three Dantian of the Nine Purple Chambers

Now as to the one who withdraws within: he retires from the South towards the North behind the nape of the neck. Above the space between the two eyebrows, withdrawing upward three fen, is the Guardian of the Double Inch Field; withdrawing one inch is the Bright Hall Palace; withdrawing two inches is the Cave Chamber Palace; withdrawing three inches is the Dantian Palace; withdrawing four inches is the Flowing Pearl Palace; and withdrawing five inches is the Jade Emperor Palace. One inch above the Bright Hall is the Heavenly Court Palace; one inch above the Cave Chamber is the Utmost Truth Palace; one inch above the Dantian is the Mysterious Dantian Palace; one inch above the Flowing Pearl is the Supreme Emperor Palace. Thus within the head there are nine palaces.

The Dantian Palace above the space between the eyebrows, the Dantian Palace in the Heart Crimson Palace, and the Lower Dantian Palace three cun below the navel, together make the Three Dantian. The Red Infant abides in the Upper Dantian; the Perfected Man abides in the Middle Dantian; the Infant Emperor abides in the Lower Dantian. Within the Dantian dwells the Upper Origin True One Emperor, who governs together with two others the Dantian Palace, preserving the Way of the Three Origins True One.

The Guardian of the Double Inch Field is enclosed by the Yellow Gate and Purple Door, the Crimson Platform and Azure Chamber, which together form the left and right ears within the Guardian of the Inch. On the left side of the Guardian of the Inch is the Crimson Platform; on the right side is the Yellow Gate. The Perfected One enters and departs through the way between the Yellow Gate and Crimson Platform. Therefore the Gate and Platform are placed on the left and right of the Way, to oversee the extraordinary qi, watching and awaiting the movements of the Perfected One. Within the Guardian of the Double Inch Field dwell two great spirits.

In the Bright Hall Palace, on the left is the Bright Boy True Lord; on the right is the Bright Maiden True Officer; in the centre is the Bright Mirror Spirit Lord. These three lords jointly govern the palace, clad in embroidered silks of varied colours, with girdles bearing four red bells, their mouths holding red mirrors, the bells and mirrors being of red jade. Their forms resemble those of infants; they sit all facing outward, or sometimes facing one another.

Within the Cave Chamber Palace are the Three True Ones: on the left the Noble Youth Wu Ying; on the right the Primordial Lady Bai; in the middle the Lord Huang Lao. These three jointly govern the palace; this is the Way of the Flying True Ones.

The Dantian Palace is one inch square on each of its four sides.

The Flowing Pearl Palace is the dwelling of the Master of Fate, who conducts his Way in subtlety.

The Jade Emperor Palace is the abode of the Divine Mother of the Jade Clarity.

The Heavenly Court Palace is the residence of the Supreme Clarity True Maiden.

The Utmost Truth Officer is the dwelling of the Imperial Consort of the Great Ultimate.

The Mysterious Dantian Palace is one inch square, a Purple Chamber and Green Room, filled within with vermilion smoke. Within is the Mud Pellet Great One True Lord who governs it; his appearance is like that of a newly born infant. He sits upon a golden bed with jade canopy, clad in purple embroidered silk, with a girdle bearing bells of flowing fire. The bells of flowing fire have no substance but a red radiance; when moved, their sound is heard for a hundred thousand li. These are the treasured bells of the Great Ultimate Perfected Lord of the Supreme Clarity. Sitting upright in the Mysterious Dantian Palace, with no attendants on either side outwardly, he is therefore called the Great Ultimate True Lord.

Now the Three Ones are the spiritual ancestors of the one body, the root of life for all the myriad spirits, the mountain source of the fluids, the jade chamber of the spirit essence. Therefore, the Stomach Pool is square to receive things; the Brain Palace is round and void to accommodate the truth; myriad hairs stand erect; a thousand orifices emit smoke; virtue completes Heaven and Earth, penetrating the Supreme Mystery; hence it is called the Mud Pellet. The Mud Pellet is the spirit of the corporeal form.

The Supreme Emperor Palace is the dwelling of the Supreme Lord and Lady.

Thus ends the Diagram of the Purple Chambers of the Nine Palaces of the Supreme Clarity Cave-Truth.
