The Jade Scripture of the Supreme Truth, Secret Way of Nine Essences, Revolving Radiance and Union of Spirits

Under the Qingxuan Mansion, the Teaching Director of Destinies, Supreme Minister of the Cave Spirit, having received the stratagem of the Director of Destinies, was instructed by the Celestial Guardian of the Golden Tower, the Immortal Inspector Director of Destinies, Lord Yang, and commissioned by the Eastern Flower, Supervisor of Purity and Leisure, Master Li, to transmit the Supreme Truth Secret Way of Nine Essences, Revolving Radiance and Union of Spirits, Supreme Jade Method. In the year Yanmou, Master Li, through the Northern Dipper Headquarters and Lady Jiang Zhen, the Supreme Truth Golden Flower, descended to impart to the Cave Spirit in Southern Long, and furthermore conveyed to the Supreme Guardian, saying: 'The Supreme Truth Secret Way of Nine Essences, Revolving Radiance and Union of Spirits, Supreme Jade Method, is the high work of the Director of Destinies; it is not to be taught to the common people below. It is not written in jade slips nor inscribed with golden names. Great talents and vast virtues, suitable to be Directors of Destinies, may not be allowed to hear it. Practised for nine years, then one governs the Golden Palace and the Golden Chambers; Directors of Destinies and their myriad spirits, preserved through two passes, return to the Jade Truth. Long continued, the eyes emit purple lightning, the head shakes with nine lights, coughing and howling with the winds and clouds, uniting and transforming with Heaven. Should words be leaked, the Water Officer beats his drum; should characters be revealed, the nine essences are removed. Recipients kneel and make oath before the Eastern Flower. Until the work is accomplished, it will not be taught to later disciples. The Jade prohibition is most weighty; one must reverence it.'

The Method says: Before the Mid-Autumn Festival, one must fast, purify, and bathe; on the evening of Mid-Autumn, don new garments and headwear; then place precious incense in the courtyard. The precious incense consists of amber, Anxi descending spirits, and mixed aloeswood. With refined thought and clear observation, fix the gaze upon a shooting star; or perceive a wondrous coloured light or vapour in the heavens. If one perceives a difference in the left side, then by the mind one draws it in, inhaling and absorbing it into the left pupil. The right side is treated likewise. If but one is obtained, await the completion of the next year; if both left and right are obtained, the Way is accomplished. Having fully drawn in the light into both pupils, hasten home, seat facing south, join hands in refined thought, preserving the two pupils as images of sun and moon, suddenly ascending to the Bright Hall. Between the two eyebrows one then enters one inch to the Bright Hall. The radiance of sun and moon mingles in the Bright Hall, revolving three hundred and sixty-five degrees. The mental sign should show feelings of warmth and mingled exhalations; one imagines that between the sun and moon is a flowing essence like ointment, descending to the Bright Hall, where five colours flourish with warmth and mild heat. One should trust that the essence flows by itself, then return it to the sun and moon pupils. Burn the precious incense and chant the spell:

‘Summon the light and draw the shadow, wondrous unto the spirit;  
The spiritual child opens the chart, the Great Truth, the One Truth;  
Transformed and born from the Most High, the Most One, Revered Spirit;  
Star threads mount the leader, revolving radiance of nine essences;  
Refine and unite my vital breath, a hundred blessings ever new;  
The stratagem inscribed for Director of Destinies, ascending to imperial court.’

When the incantation is complete, rest and sleep. At the coming evening, cease the refined thought and sleep. Thus for nine evenings, until the ninth night at midnight, burn precious incense, preserve the Bright Hall. Without reliance on the mind, one will naturally see five-coloured flowing essence, nurturing a jade infant, as large as the heart of a lotus seed, named the Supreme Truth Mystery. Clearly perceive it, knock the teeth nine times, cover both ears with hands, and recite this prayer:

‘Morning Pivot and rosy observatory, the Most One’s wandering chamber;  
My mystery, my mystery, I rise and sit in the Bright Hall;  
Heaven and Earth begin their truth, five-coloured jade light;  
With movement and stillness it roams, with me it unfolds;  
Order the destiny of the lower spirits, Director of Destinies’ Golden Bed;  
Longevity without end, the Way and Virtue flow fragrant.’

When the prayer is ended, press both hands on the knees, preserve the nine stars of the Northern Dipper shining clearly in the heavens. Next, preserve the Bright Hall and emit purple breath, ascending like a rainbow; connect with the Dipper’s star of Kui. Then preserve two pupils: the left named Most Truth, the right One Truth; ascend to the Bright Hall, support the Most One jade infant to arise, ascend on purple breath. Next preserve the consort and two pupils, guide the Most One first to the Heavenly Court’s Jade Truth Abode; the sign bows to the Most One, begging for long life from Director of Destinies and the myriad spirits. One should feel a slight itching in the Heavenly Court, as if something points to the space between the eyebrows. Next preserve and guide the Most One, ascending from purple breath to the star Kui; an imperial lord meets and salutes the Most One; the sign’s birth name is recorded, the death register fallen; the Most One with the sign and two pupils tread the nine stars twice over. The Most One sits in the imperial star; the two pupils and the sign act as escort. Suddenly, taking the nine stars of the Dipper, they cast into the void and descend. Red light and purple mist blend upon the sign’s body, and the mansion’s left breast is called Ascending Morning Pivot, the right breast Ascending Rosy Observatory; the right arm is called True Man’s Abode, the left arm Purple Source Room; above the jaw is Hanging Rainbow Stair; between the philtrum and mountain source, in the nostrils’ hollow, is called Valley Near Stillness; at the celestial centre is Paying Homage to the Imperial Lord; the left eye of the Jade Truth mansion star is called Azure Field; the imperial lord’s star mansion right eye is Golden Cavern. The star-thread’s red light pierces and entwines, purple breath flows like mist, merging and joining all vessels; the nine stars stand solemn in their places. Next preserve the Most One escorting the two pupils; riding the red light of the star-thread, roam and feast among the nine palaces, then return to the Jade Truth abode. Then count the ten heavenly stems and return to the Most One’s resting court. The positions are: Jia at Ascending Morning Pivot, Yi at Ascending Rosy Observatory, Bing at True Man’s Abode, Ding at Purple Source Room, Wu at Hanging Rainbow Stair, Ji at Valley Near Stillness, Geng at Paying Homage to Imperial Lord, Xin at Jade Truth Abode, Ren at Azure Field, Gui at Golden Cavern. Having finished, rub the red residence, pull the ears, lick the lips, touch the heart and pray:

‘Most One, Supreme Truth, support and connect the two pupils;  
Nine stars, the Supreme Deity, heed the orders of the Jade Palace;  
Swirling and revolving into one form, Heaven and Earth are equal;  
Appoint the little sign, mount the flying dragon,  
Red crow in imperial robes, beat the drum, strike the bell;  
Mixed and preserved without form, long abiding without end.’

When the spell is complete, forget the form. One practises thus for nine days once; in nine years the Way is greatly accomplished. The Supreme Celestial Lord bestows upon him the stratagem of Director of Destinies, appointing him among the heavens. Practise it a hundred days; one dreams of five colours or of pheasant-like birds, which is the Most One Palace’s Supreme Deity descending to the sign’s body. Prohibited are fish, spicy dried meats, goose bamboo shoots; other daily foods are not to be taken, lest one break away from the one source and violate the jade prohibition. If one abstains from grains and practises thus, the merit is tenfold.

The Youth Lord’s grain-avoidance method is still to be used with this Way. One stone of chicken’s head is shorn of shell, mixed with five liang of green sandalwood root, boiled in one stone of clear spring water and soaked. In the three dog days, enter three jin of narrow-spirit powder and ten liang of cinnabar powder, mix evenly, steam in a wooden steamer for one dog day, dry in sun, store in a green pouch. When used, mix with honey water to form a paste and cook as a drink, thrice daily; hunger ceases. Though this formula is not carried out, feeding it also repels old age and grants long life.
