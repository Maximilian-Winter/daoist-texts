The Jade Secret of the Three Races at Dawn of Supreme Clarity

The Most High Dao Lord said: If you desire longevity, you must cherish the Nine Stars. If you desire to ascend to the true, you must know the Jade Dawn. If you desire to soar and mount, you must diligently perform the Three Races. This signifies the Cover of Splendour beneath the Northern Pole, the Dipper, the Central Stars, the Aides. The Two Principles nurture the embryo, before the myriad transformations have commenced. The Three Stars conceal their elegance, the Three Qi diffuse their vapours, gathering crystals to contain light, congealing into the Three Stars. The arrayed luminaries may not interfere with their function; the sun and moon may not encroach upon their governance. The Three Qi are the mysterious root to which myriad spirits return; above is the foundation of the Three Realms, the great sages and precious sovereigns’ capital; below is the distribution of the Three Stars’ pivotal handles; in the midst is the Bright Hall, the Secret Chamber, the true Mysterious Elixir, to engender the Three-One Perfected Ones, the spirits of the Red Infant and Yellow Court. By these are governed life and death, concealment and oblivion, transformation and adaptation, rapid flight, and enduring existence; all proceed from this. The Cover of Splendour below is profound, luminous, and radiant; it is the immovable star of the Northern Pole. This is the essence-dividing portion of the Jade Palace Mysterious Sovereign Dao Lord, the true star of the Jade Emperor. Under the shadow of the Cover of Splendour, riding the Dipper Chariot, roaming the Nine Heavens, attending the Nine Sages, serving the Thousand Perfected, dwelling on the Mysterious Terrace, holding rank in Jade Clarity. The Aide Stars are the spirits of the High Supreme Jade Emperor, the essence of the Later Sage Emperor of the Golden Palace of Great Peace. The Assisting Stars are the spirit of the Jade Lord of the Supreme Subtle Heaven. Assist is called the Eight Scenes, and Aid the Seven Dawns. These are the great divinities of the Nine Stars of the Northern Dipper, above assisting the Jade Emperor, below pacifying the primal origins, foremost among the myriad Qi, forerunners on the Dao-path. They are the true ones of the Supreme Clear Jade Emperor, endowed with the Seven Primaries of the Dispersed and Falling, the Flowing Golden Fire Bells, riding the Chariot of the Eight Scenes, to attend the Jade Palace.

The method is, when the star rises, to spread the mat facing north, burn incense, with the heart bowing nine times, sitting calmly to receive the hand, closing the eyes to contemplate the Three Stars each emitting their purple jade-coloured Qi, descending to the sign-body as if the clear sky were serene, clouds returning in four directions, wind and smoke gathering the mountains; the whole body shining alike, all encompassing to the utmost, penetrating the five viscera internally. Above the Mud Pellet, between the pupils and tongue root divided sections, the purple Qi and light whirl around, encircling the ninefold layers. Swallow the Qi liquid thrice nine times, knock the teeth nine times continuously, and recite the Yin incantation and blessing as follows:

O Jade Emperor, Most High True One, Three Mysteries looking upwards to divide, Left Aide, Right Assistor, Central Pole Purple Palace, Flowing Essence of Mysterious Void, Hollow Space Ninefold Revolutions, Purifying and Refining the Form and Vessel, Golden Bones and Green Tendons, the Three Emperors descend to connect, unite shape and run together, accumulate the green precious robe, the spirit-spirit flying skirt, adorned with the garments of dispersal, girded with flowing bells, the sun and moon as chivalrous guards, dragon and tiger as winged wheels, the Eight Scenes magnificent chariot, establishing the seven dawns of the palace, highest pole of jade scene, ministers of the Jade Emperor.

Cherish within the Three Stars the purple jade-coloured light, illuminating infinity, stars and myriad things perfectly united as one. Contemplate the Three Stars as great as the Red Sun, purple rays extending in eight directions. Left Aide letting fall light, within which is an infant, crowned with the Morning Treasure of Heaven, embroidered in purple splendid robe, riding the Qi to come swiftly, appearing before the sign-body. Knock the teeth nine times continuously, intone the Yin call: Left Aide Spirit Palace Jade Emperor Exalted Spirit, Golden Palace Later Sage Great Peace Emperor Lord. In the heart contemplate the character Nie twice in succession, incantation:

Emperor Star Primordial Essence, Hall of the Later Sage, Lord of Great Peace, King of Supreme Clarity, presiding over the regulation of myriad perfected, softly calling Yin and Yang, granting to the minister the Dao secret, begging the minister the wondrous formula, Heavenly Tassel Jade Garment, first establishing Mysterious Light, subordinate with sincere wishes, obtaining habitation in the Purple Chamber.

Cherish the Right Assistor Spirit Palace, Red Jasper Jade Chamber, Jade Emperor Exalted Spirit, Lord of Supreme Subtle Heaven, form and garb as before, knock the teeth and intone Yin call, in the heart contemplate the character Si thrice in succession, incantation:

Honoured Sage of Supreme Subtle Heaven, commander of the pivotal mechanism, assisting and aiding Mysterious Constant, dispersing all spirits, flowing essence Mud Pellet, refining and congealing the hundred bones, loosening the sac and severing the root, the Seven Ancestor Immortals flying, corpses knotting and severing, granting to the minister the feathered emblem, embroidered robes, eternally returning together.

Contemplate the Aide and Assistor Emperors truly present on the left and right of the sign, floating standing in the light, surpassing the head above. Next, contemplate beneath the Cover of Splendour the Jade Palace Exalted Star, purple Qi flowing light, descending within the two Emperors and the sign-body. Looking upward, see the Jade Emperor’s Infinite Treasure Crown, crimson brocade jade robe, form like an infant, holding the jade seal, nine-coloured round light illuminating heaven and earth. Knock the teeth and intone Yin call: Jade Capital Golden Palace Most Sage Most True Jade Palace Purple Chamber Jade Emperor Supreme Lord. In the heart contemplate the character Qi thrice in succession, incantation:

Myriad Aeons open and close, the Jade Emperor’s exalted, dragon robe and phoenix seal, none dare disobey, utmost true nameless, highest sage spontaneous, below connecting to the lesser sign, the three scenes floating chariot, sharing the chariot with the Emperor, the Jade Palace heaven, rescuing minister from life and death, opening aid to the nine mysteries, Emperor’s grace and minister’s heart, no before or after, flying form Jade Clarity, commanding the Heavenly Origin.

Contemplate the Three Emperors lifting the sign, floating in the nine-coloured light within the void, then see the treasured jade and emerald rosy clouds of the Eight Scenes’ chariot, driving the Nine Dragons, ascending with the sign, attending the Emperor’s chariot, hundreds of myriads of chariots and cavalry, proceeding straight upwards hastening to the centre of the Jade Palace, thereby forgetting the form. Diligently practice for five years, afterwards the Later Sage descends truly, for seven years jointly attending the Jade Palace, roaming and galloping the myriad heavens.

The Most High Dao Lord said: Before the division of the Three Qi, there was chaos without form, residing in the dark obscurity, beyond conception or knowledge, a single void. The void is emptiness and stillness; when stillness reaches its utmost, it becomes brightness. Brightness is not born from life, nor is it understood how it comes to be. The so-called brightness is the recognition of mystery at present; brightness establishes form, darkness mutually contests with it. Brightness prevailing is Yang; darkness prevailing is Yin. Vapour condenses to water; slackness is earth; solidifying is metal; urgency is fire; surging is wood; dispersion is myriad things; flow is transformation; congealing is region. Heaven and earth’s hundred treasures are those which you can possess yourself. What you do is movement, akin to their nature; beasts and humans each have their knowledge; stillness is akin to form; myriad things each have their image; movement and stillness never separate; persons and things mutually embody and function. Thus life has nature; nature has knowledge; originally there is no knowledge; it is called knowledge because form returns to nature’s constancy, neither ending nor beginning. Heaven and earth and myriad things belong to the same class, each according to root and seed, receiving their non-nature. Humans and beasts differ, wood and stone differ; the five tastes are not as in antiquity; one Qi constantly transforms in the present. The sages comprehend the Dao, thus they arrive without travelling, see without looking. The multitude are dark to the Dao, thus wander and do not return, taking the true for an enemy. They do not know that myriad things are one thing, Heaven and humans one Qi, only taking form’s solidity and root’s distinction as real. The Dao has no life or death, it splits and disperses brightness; it is like sowing grain, one nourishing ten thousand; this year’s grain is not last year’s grain, yet it is not not grain. So it is with persons and things; now the eyes of men see the eyes of ancients, seeing only seeing, not the seeing of the ancients coming to the eyes of men. Their seed is firm, their kind fixed, Qi and taste do not trespass each other, and their brightness is constant. The so-called constant brightness is that the bright essence is originally bright, not one brightness unchanging. Therefore the multitude have memory and forgetfulness, death and life; the ordinary and sage are suspended apart. The highest truth is manifested; transformations are seen. He who can obtain its truth and forget his passions, dying and living repeatedly without changing his own nature, then creation and transformation become his own. Yet he is with Heaven and Earth together; whither shall he escape? When he is one with the Dao in essence, persons and beasts, things, self and fortune and misfortune, no longer have dispute. The sage is perfect in the realm of the Dao, truly supreme in the divine village, mysterious and obscure without contention, shining with utmost virtue. Know my words concerning the Way of the Three Races; when raised, it is complete, to transmit the mystery of the Perfected Ones who are upright and profound. I humbly use three rings of cinnabar jade, one brocade of mysterious clouds, to covenant as the rites of Supreme Clarity.

The Most High Dao Lord said: Other ways cultivated do not reach the Jade Emperor. The utmost is the Emperor. The Jade Emperor is the parent of Heaven, Earth, and myriad spirits. Now cherish the true beginning of my birth, the spirit of the fetal origin, root and foundation returning to the first birth; still can the Way be attained. How much more so when power supports Heaven and Earth, skillfully carving myriad forms, employing Yin and Yang to walk the Dao and virtue! Only the Jade Emperor’s Three Races are the supreme Way. The Jade Emperor flows essence to the lord of the Bright Hall; the Later Sage communes with the spirit of the Secret Chamber; Supreme Subtle Heaven sits on the Golden Bed at the heart of the Mysterious Elixir; above it links the Jade Palace Supreme Ultimate Jade Gate Purple Chamber true.
