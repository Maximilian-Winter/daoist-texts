The Great Register of the Three Breaths of the Upper Pure Red Heaven, the Six Stars of the Jade Emperor, the Flying Roster of Life Management

The exalted Perfected Ones of Purple Spirit, illustrious in the Southern Red, sit in the chamber of the vaulted crimson palace, their thoughts high and splendid, climbing and clinging to the threads of the clouds. Their light penetrates the red essence; the Southern Dipper shines brightly, illuminating the myriad heavens. Thus they summon forth the Six Perfected Jade Emperor, the Dao Lord, who circles and flies upward along the vermilion thread of the Dao, instructing the perfected ones to open heaven and close earth, calling the sun and drawing the moon, commanding and regulating a thousand spirits, the truths of life management, the subtle breath that gives birth to spirits. From the Jade Pure Profound Book, one grasps it to ascend the stars, reporting commands to the Six Perfected who rise in the Southern Dipper, their birth of the Dao eternal. One person receives the book, leaf by leaf, the names of immortals recorded therein, sitting between life and death, treading waves and passing through fire, disasters and calamities shall not touch them.

Following its essential path, one becomes an immortal king, emperor, or high minister; refining form and soul, transcending endless kalpas. The hall of the Phoenix Treasure of the Red Heaven is engraved; oaths are sworn with the highest perfected ones; the moving corpse reveals inscriptions; bones are examined for calamity to body; entering the gates of the Five Paths. The recipient obtains the cinnabar book, carrying it in an embroidered pouch, accompanying the body in all journeys. By following the rules of cultivation, one shall be titled Eastern Splendour, attending upon the Emperor at dawn. The precious jewels of the red orchid ascend the profound terrace, facing heaven with solemn oath. The initial official perfect, whose Dao and virtue are not yet complete, must measure breath by the Yellow Register, and further must vow by blood and cut hair, undertake long fasting and refine essence, bowing the head and transmitting (the teaching).

The Dao desires to enact the way of the Red Heaven’s Six Stars of the Dipper, the method of flying steps ascending the stars. First place the talisman of treading the void beneath, securing it between the two sandals; for the earth harbours hidden corpses, foul poisons, and myriad spirits, which flee afar and hide. Then the star spirits descend to earth; the earth is not sullied, the earth spirit unbinds the prison; the earth sinks and empties; laying out the diagram for ascent, opening the caverns and sources, thorough and unobstructed, floating and not sinking, bright and not dark. Tread upon the stars above; star-light enters the form; form and Dao become one; the star breath is inconstant, following what is felt.

Use yellow paper with faint purple, placing it under the feet. The inscriptions within the scroll, except the verbal explanations, are all in vermilion characters.

If the Dao is to become true, form and vessel are already established, but heart and soul lack refinement. One should preserve the Southern Dipper in the head: one star placed between the eyebrows, one star placed at the crown; the remaining stars arranged upon the jade pillow and the great vertebrae. Day and night think upon them, so that the star rays pierce the spine and back; burning fiercely, the bones wither and the form decays. Again think upon the six stars, slowly swallowing them, causing one to attain longevity. When reclining or sitting and bathing, avoid facing south. Also make images of the Six Perfected Lords of cinnabar, hanging on the left elbow, females on the right elbow. Utter auspicious and inauspicious blessings upon them; in eating and drinking, imagine them; great victory.

If the Dao is to become true, one must think of the six stars in the hands and feet, heart and brain. Long thus, the Six Perfected descend essence, to refine the form as a child, flying spirit Jade Pure. Human form like the true perfected; embroidered robes are red stars.

If one wishes to lie down at dusk, one should think that the stars fill the canopy like fire burning. Recite the prayer:

“Cinnabar Profound Jade Chamber, shining upon the gate of life,  
Six Perfected Sovereigns above, guarding the Southern Pavilion.  
I wield subtle breath, entering and illuminating the Emperor’s Terrace,  
Extracting and refining the nine ancestors, the vermilion mound transmutes souls.  
Purple brush, vermilion script, opening the Dao’s source of life,  
Evil dreams and ill omens, quickly deliver to the Emperor Lord.”

Talisman for the crown of the head

Talisman for the arm pit

Preserving the six hearts and mansions

Talisman for the sleeping canopy

The Dao studies the method of the Southern Dipper; flying ascends the tower of the Southern Heaven’s Crimson City. One must sacrifice on the sixth day of the sixth month, the birthday of one’s original destiny, always using fresh fragrant offerings. Sacrifice those beloved by man, and conclude the sacrifice at midday. The step is greatly auspicious.

With this book, specially placed in a box before the image of the Southern Dipper, one carries it in all actions. Or one may use what is preserved therein in practice. Those who do not tread but have this book are immortals of longevity, but it is not granted to disciples of lower learning.

The Southern Mound’s messenger, with the officials and soldiers of the Three Breaths of the Upper Pure Red Heaven, numbering sixty thousand, governs within the domain of the offspring’s governance, guarding the registers to ensure authenticity. Those without the green bone script in their minds must not hear it. Those who obtain this book should be true to the Golden Palace, but it does not reveal the earthly officials who covet the world.

When the Dao desires to bestow the book, the covenant is as in the rites of the Upper Pure; prohibitions are as in the laws. The servant of such and such a year brings the precious cloth and goes to the master to request the Great Register of the Red Heaven’s Life Manager, flying to the six stars, ascending to the Jade Pure, reporting to the Nine Heavens, enabling communication with the Profound and the longevity, commanding the myriad distant life manager imperial officials.
