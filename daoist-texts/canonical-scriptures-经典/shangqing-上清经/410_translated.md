### Scroll One of the True Scripture of the Supreme Daoist on Wisdom and Dispelling Demons

The Exalted Spirit of the True Medicine of Profound Brilliance and High Efficacy

At the time of the Supreme Dao Sovereign, the discourse on the supreme clarity of the Great Wisdom text concerning the True Medicine that dispels demons and the exalted spirit of profound efficacy was given. The Golden Gate Emperor Sovereign once sat attending and heard it, thereafter reporting it to the Azure Youth Sovereign, saying: “This is what is spoken of in the Scripture of Supreme Clarity on Dispelling Demons and Wisdom. It may be employed to expel evil and awaken illness, to drive away spirits and remove harm, to scatter the demon Qi of the six heavens, and to restrain the invasion of myriad monsters. If one chants this chapter, indeed it is the branch and root of the divine tiger, the true Qi employed in secrecy. The Prime Minister Tuo may inform Daoists who have a predestined true name from ancient times, who, before learning, are ridden by multitudes of evil spirits, or who when indoors suffer affliction from ghosts and spirits: if they can recite it by day in the chamber and hold it in their heart by night, then all evil will be far from them, and their spirits will be clear and open. The Azure Youth Sovereign respectfully received these words and recorded them in the scroll of divine talismans. The name of the medicine of Jade Clarity, Supreme Clarity, and the Great Ultimate is still sufficient to repel a hundred ghosts; how much more if one consumes its substance! The immortals of the Nine Palaces have never seen the chapters of this book; the Great Ultimate Supreme Truth does not transmit this great scripture of wisdom. This scripture is bestowed upon apprentices who know emptiness and is not granted to true names on earth; one must attain the Dao and ascend to the Great Ultimate before it is conferred upon worthy recipients. Now, the Supreme has only transcribed one ten-thousandth of the chapter on dispelling demons; it is placed before and after the divine talismans. Although there are true names on earth, without studying the Dao, one is without affinity to fully hear it; thus this scripture cannot be completely heard. Hearing its title, one knows its name of medicine; it is the True Jade Scripture of Supreme Clarity, the name of true destiny.

The Azure Youth Sovereign humbly received the discourse and afterwards told Chi Songzi. When Chi Songzi had not yet attained the Dao, he was suddenly afflicted with dire illness in the mountains of Jinhua. For sixteen years, despite striving to preserve truth and essence, his suffering was unrelieved. At that time, Songzi stilled his heart to seek the Dao, refined his spirit and maintained quietude, initially not grieving over his illness, nor regarding birth and death otherwise than as sound and hearing. It is said that the spirits of the six heavens cause disorder through illness, or perhaps the exalted ones send the affliction to test resolve, yet their intent is to break the true heart. They observe whether one treads water or fire rightly or wrongly, and thus they become the testers of illness. Songzi, having purified and supported his illness, recited the wisdom, chanting the dispelling demon section three thousand times; thereafter his malady was cured, his heart opened and spirit brightened — more healed than before illness. For the sick, firstly it is to test the sincerity of the heart; secondly to remove corpse filth; thirdly to disperse the unwholesome; fourthly to refine dust and defilement. If one remains calm and steadfast, with feelings and aspirations enhanced, seeking Dao and guarding spirit, hoping for the profound teaching, then the illness can be dispelled in a moment; if the sick are confused and disturbed in mind, diligent but unsteady, feelings wandering and mixed, sincerity but barely sustained, then the illness may torment the entire morning. The two insects know no more! Afterwards Songzi attained the Dao on Mount Dahuo, ascended to the Golden Gate, received the book and became the Supreme True Person of the Great Void, having a true name in Supreme Clarity.

The Scripture of Wisdom, also called the Scripture of the Great Beginning of the Void, or the Transmission of Pure Wisdom, consists of seven scrolls, housed in the Jade Clarity Gate, within the chambers of the High and Supreme Void Emperor’s Elixir. Constantly three thousand pure spirit jade maidens attend upon these seven scrolls. Hence it is sometimes called the Scripture of the Great Beginning of the Void. The wise know the Supreme Emperor at midday; the word for wisdom signifies the urgency of life and growth; the character for wisdom contains two “births” joined together, both riding one urgency.

There are those who paint and record; these speak of the Scripture of Wisdom; those who do not, are but the two images of the Supreme Dao Sovereign. One must recite them all in order, three thousand times. If the number of recitations is not sufficient and one pauses, one must begin again at the start. If in long fasting in a proper chamber*, with focused mind and complete recitation, one must sever external things and not pause midway; pausing midway brings chastisement upon the body. The Jade Youth Sovereign ascends the Three Officials to report to the Golden Gate; caution is needed. Practitioners of the Dao must recite it fully, dispelling evil and brightening the spirit, opening the heart and dispersing dullness, removing monsters and balancing Qi, so that true essence enters the body. After fasting for fifty days, one should recite it, clasp hands in blessing, and let the voice issue from the mouth, neither abruptly nor hastily. When completed, the subtlety is gained; at that time, a spiritual person may descend to instruct; one who can fathom the meaning also flies in the Great Void — this is the Great Void True Person. Recitation of ten thousand times is best; at the end of the work, the cloud chariot will also arrive. This Dao surpasses the thirty-nine chapters of the Cave Scriptures; those who have reduced it still possess but one ten-thousandth of wisdom, how much less the full seven scrolls of the profound garden! Yet the methods of the Four Extremities must not be transmitted to true names on earth who have not ascended heaven. If one can fast, it is best to recite this one scroll completely; the poor cannot do so. In the world’s vulgarity, one opens the divine text and reads it aloud; this is not within the fixed number of fasting and focused recitations. It is also fitting to first study the regulations and become familiar with the rules, then fast and recite. Three thousand recitations make one completion; six thousand two; nine thousand three; twelve thousand four — in the style of Yu and Li’s red text, four completions, corresponding to scattering the scene. One must not read ahead before becoming familiar; once familiar, do not neglect or pass over; this is the great taboo of the Azure Youth’s eastern discipline, lest one’s eyes lose their guarding light — be cautious. Always watch the characters steadily, recite slowly and softly; if interrupted or mistaken, return and read again, pausing to return thirty characters, quietly burn incense, rinse mouth facing east; begin at dawn as if tying a yellow banner, so-called warming the great Dao at dawn.

When reciting the scripture, one may eat and rest at the three periods of the day: morning hour, noon hour, and evening hour; the night passes till dawn. If one finishes one completion but has not attained it, one may fast and recite again; speed or delay is by oneself, no need to interfere. If one wishes to recite again after one completion, one must fast anew as at the beginning. Within the cave terrace are carved inscriptions of utmost excellence on the northern rock of the western mountain, stating: “To induce meeting with pure joy, to add exposition of what is most exquisite in the great Dao, clear and bright, wisdom comes to warm the Scripture of Wisdom.” The text mostly lightly indicates the meaning of reading and reciting the book.

The Preface to the Supreme Clarity Great Wisdom text on the True Medicine that dispels demons, the exalted spirit of profound efficacy, is the supreme scripture received by the Supreme Dao Sovereign, enabling men to fly the wheel in the great void, to chase and intercept the Qi of the six heavens. This scripture has seven scrolls, treasured and secret by the Supreme Dao Sovereign. Now the Azure Youth Sovereign has copied one ten-thousandth of the chapter on dispelling demons, placed among the divine talismans.

The Supreme Old Lord is the master of the Supreme Great Dao Sovereign’s divine tiger talisman, golden tiger true talisman, and the Scripture of Wisdom in its pure form. He commands the King Sovereign to transmit it to those who know the truth, and orders the Azure Youth to impart it to those who achieve the truth. Those who know the truth are said to be truly wise and true; those who achieve the truth are those who diligently seek and obtain it. This book is only to be transmitted by these two lords to those with the mysterious name in the Jade Scripture; other true persons must not transmit it falsely. Therefore the Supreme once reported it to the Later Sage Golden Gate Emperor Sovereign, who entrusted it to the Upper Minister and Upper Chancellor. Within seven hundred years, three transmissions may be heard; first by oath and alliance, then to proceed; without alliance, one is judged and examined for seven generations before the Three Yin Water Officials.

The Three Yin are the three officials of the Five Emperors, managing the punishments of life and death. The first left official governs the living; the second right official governs the dead; the third female official governs women. Also the water and fire left and right officials: the left water official punishes false speech on heaven and earth, reveals and belittles heavenly patterns, insults the two images, and offends the three stars; the right fire official punishes great rebellion and killing, harming teachers and rulers, plotting against parents, the greatest crimes of the great hills. The five palaces lie beneath Mount Tai, in the shadow of the great mountain, the small sky of the hollow cave; the small sky revolves four thousand li, all placed under the Three Officials. Within the mystery are three great voids: Jade Clarity Great Void, Supreme Clarity Great Void, and Great Ultimate Great Void; within mystery are three voids, as in the cave. The Great Void lies below Mount Tai, above the hollow cave. The hollow cave lies below the Great Void, above the chambers of the true person officials. The Nine Palaces of Supreme Clarity also have three great voids. The great void lies below the Great Ultimate hollow cave, in the voids of the Five Mountains.

The Supreme Discourses on Wisdom:

The Supreme Old Lord attends on the left of the Supreme Great Dao Sovereign. The Dao Sovereign dwells leisurely in the chamber of the Morning Cooperation Spirit View on Mount Heng. Below are recorded the nine mysteries of the Purple Radiance; on the right guard are six leading beasts like lions. Then the Supreme Protector True Person Simpleborn, the Jade Pure Spirit Maiden of the chamber, holds the Zhu Ling incense of flying Qi, lifting the essential profound chapter while standing. The Supreme Dao Sovereign rinses in azure water, exhales scarlet Qi, with empty heart and quiet body, calms spirit and focuses mystery, wearing the divine tiger on the left and the golden truth on the right, reciting and chanting the Supreme Scripture of Wisdom and the upper chapter of spirit medicine that dispels demons, along with the eight mysteries, nine truths, seven gates, and three candles. It is called emptiness and non-being; the upper text is profound and dense; a thousand truths pause the wheel; myriad spirits halt their steps; the spiritual sound ascends and excites; the intention paints and intervenes in blessings; peculiar sounds and rare melodies emerge. The cave gold gleams like jade; overseeing and watching the hidden; illuminating and capturing; the mysterious pattern flows and displays; the spirit gazes swiftly; the Dao gathering is infinite; the rare rhyme and subtle perception; the whirlwind Qi extends the void; dust accumulates in realms. Thus the mysterious pearl shines with melancholy light; the clear mirror stirs the still quiet record. The Great Dao is vast and complete; the flying light shines far; steps move in the spirit stream; waves shock and the pure breeze flies; sinking and rising in the nine underworlds; hard to trace footsteps; transformations unforeseen; places not lost in ink; transformations elevate the sun; rare dwellings of virtue shine; peaceful pleasure at the twin gates; returning to awaken principle; calming crude great images; stirring wide rivers; dark and profound communication; wondrous principles connect the subtle; playing with divine blades; sailing the vast mass; stirring hundred suns to generate electricity; drumming thousand moons to exhale power; the six heavens lose Qi; nine demons are destroyed. Holding the sun and vast glow; myriad smoke embraced; stillness harmonizes with heaven and earth; motion equals the seven scenes in brightness; sleeping is peaceful yet unsettled; dwelling in danger yet untroubled; shining through waves and smoke; restraining truth and releasing rest; the morning cooperation severs two extremes; a glance opens myriad darkness; thus feet push seven degrees; hands grasp heavenly secrets; the peak covers mysterious stars; joining and returning the two instruments; rivers and mountains break and collapse; four Qi flow and shift; countless solid bright stones; ears quicken and clear; cycles complete spiritual degrees; vast unity returns; then the spirit perfects empty agents; wonderful rhyme and mysterious flight; surely able to move the Great Void without rotation; generate myriad winds in hidden brilliance; raise eight scenes above to ascend; resist flying reins in the pure domain; ride phoenix carriages for high views; release cloud carriages for flowing gallops; rejoice in nine distant places to aid openness; soar purple heavens to pause vermilion scenes; delight in seven sources to connect Qi; crown azure ford to pour crimson well; whirlwind smoke, wave, and lightning; with wondrous body upright; clear void spirit reverent; spiritual ladder breaks eternity. Vermilion light already glowing; dividing entry into mysterious river; folding wings to view transformations; fleeting stillness of the void; myriad changes all reflected; flying wheel jade summit; phoenix cries and dragon leaps; tiger roars and phoenix sings; myriad sounds like jade scattering; many jades like scattered flowers; jade forest shakes winds; vermilion trees dance flowers. Then stirring harmonies of myriad sounds; flying calls of a thousand tunes; spiritual pattern expanded; cloud neighbors show substance; vast transformation morning flow; wondrous arts evening emergence; loosening belt wandering spirit; embracing knees pure and refined; viewing transformation without embellishment; peaceful void without extravagance; erect gates and empty flow; clear and arranged gatherings; seven clarities everlasting; no omissions nor excess; roaming cold spirits; no sole nor pair; reverently entrusting divine clauses; singing journey of obscure grace. Grasping heaven to fill the liver; lion guards the chest; burning fire protects the soul; bronze head unites the spirits; long teeth bristle ears to leap oppositely; electric father excites Qi in double meditation; lifting teeth and folding feet; thunder lord knocks and presses; six eyes manage abundance; five tigers blow hot; gripping blades to chase evil; fierce beasts drive filth; rushing Qi thunder spirit; guarding life not falling. Yet this spirit bird starts with human movement; the Dao also aids living; soaring peak condenses spirit; shaking and revealing ruggedness; nine calamities dispatched; no thought no feeling; balanced with eight forms; vessel mysterious Qi light; ninth heaven seven glances; hanging fragrant blossoms; vermilion yellow flame assembled; not smoke but spirit shining; pottery movement uniting truth; sprinkling simplicity dispersing name; rinsing taste spiritual wings; spirit Qi peaceful and clear; letting waves two heavens; high aromatic fragrance obscure; jade maiden holding incense; purple concubine embracing urn; watering ford sky pool; scattering blossoms jade court; commanding armor rider; clan gathering heavenly soldiers; poisonous dragon spewing shadow; divine tiger sending forth troops; outward binding mysterious Qi; inward prepared seven cities; Dao not yet descended or united; depending on might to be born; true completion equal virtue; original Qi mysterious combined. Therefore Jade Clarity Heaven True, heart without empty shore; high perching severing darkness; embracing elixir cloud ravine; thus to the upper Daoist men; containing brilliance self-smiling; reaching to the highest virtue men; uniquely tasting darkness dispersing; mystery not expecting truth; marked not opening radiance; soaring competing with Great Dao; by the shore of Haochuan; rushing up responding to time; rare subtle eternal rhyme; flying string far and wide; sound not needing plucking; nine harmonies mysterious sound; empty same as supreme feast. Therefore able to transcend mind beyond heaven; wondrous same as one vision.

From here on below, all are dragon radiance four marshes; issuing essence subtle immortals; roaming dream Jade Clarity; entrusting scenes above leisure; waves reflecting ascending void; hands pushing eight thousand; body shaking purple staff; red cap lotus crown; shining over seven valleys; flying fragrance rinsing smoke; essence penetrating Great Void; virtue accomplishing nine heavens; both sun wearing moon; peaceful dwelling vast chapters; flying wheel northern hill; loosening belt splendid garden; western mother commanding reins; joining riding turtle mountain; four teachings great kindness; wondrous chanting Great Mystery; six yin beautiful and proud; coming to repair past karma; from virtue bringing no distance. Those whose minds have not yet realized truth are all adorned with jade teeth and flourishing blossoms; seven yang sun infants; nine gem liquids; eight jade essences; four blossoms purple syrup; five pearls crimson born; three flowers flying hard; double pearls moon bright; orchid wine gold; sweet dew jade bottles; blue built weak gauze; drifting Gan flowing spirit; divine channel elixir powder; mysterious branches entwined; jade root morning gathered; western emperor pure abundance; able to dash leap vermilion sky; flying void Jade Clarity; calling and sipping it; to reach true spirit; rinsing and transforming it; to enter purple court; also able to the east extreme weaving girl’s water; also able to the west end of Venus Yuqian; also able to the south reach Yangguang’s root; also able to the north measure Taiyin night city. Thus vermilion summer condenses Yang; scene whirlwind far soaring; Great Void extracting essence; two images circling light; eight roads harmonizing; riding Mu’s fragrant motion; transforming principle nine extremes; virtue flowing Jade Emperor; secluded three gates; spirit pavilion four opens; auspicious clouds sky built; six degrees auspiciousness; spirit wind dispersing demons; magic drum summoning troops; roaming broad ford; washing it in blue waves; refining soul transforming spirit; all gathered in Dao field; picking clear grasping flute; harmonizing Qi preserving longevity; taking medicine opening brilliance; blessings praising outside fusion; drawing up mysterious flow; looking up pushing empty unity.

Those who have not yet studied, lightly enjoy Daoist school; formerly by virtue raised, position as immortal emperor; flying fallen escaping world; upper flowing empty unity; scales roaming mysterious ford; shaking earth sky river; morning and evening many immortals; nearing existence and non-existence; ears suddenly hear Jade Clarity’s upper Dao; exhaust truth’s mysterious shore; longing and admiration raised eyes; sitting waiting for dawn. What fault have I alone? Indulging in this small feast; how can one long be stained by wind and dust; eventually to be praised by the supreme emperor? Thus he cast aside immortal chapters; removed cap and past world; though body harmonized in mixed forest; yet heart dwelt beyond image; emulated lofty elegance; hoped for jade music of the jade flute; then he bade farewell to honor and flourish; shook staff on lofty ridge; chewed with no Qi; inhaled and attracted two scenes; raised wings for great journey; utmost spirit measured and erect; silent stomach empty within; gathered Qi poured into cauldron; especially mild guarding mystery; filling spring closing quiet; light body self-lost; corpse not bundled; free form preserving emptiness; no attachment no grasp. Thus opened cave gate in rare forest; sought spiritual traces in cinnabar caves; issued red treasure of nine heavens; looked to supreme clarity’s jade tablets; mysterious book already carved in jade chapters; scarlet name first published in empty gate; traveled five mountains; all myriads of cliffs arrived; a hundred hollows and thousand peaks; none not trodden; once gazed upon jade steps in purple clarity clouds; again saw divine text in embroidered cloud box; four encounters with three origins on mysterious terrace; six visits to five elders in spirit chamber; for the Supreme Emperor carried nine; placed beside high supreme same chariot seven; thus heaven gate wide and scattered; pure and clear bright and secret; extending wheel turning pavilion; high summit court; feathered cap and sash; flowing bells and ringing flutes; dragon crown phoenix skirt; wandering with clouds; darkness equal to morning; mind open and body vast; then perceived my past; healed foot dragon hidden; now rising like phoenix whirlwind; at that time truly self-sufficient and self-amused; long feast in purple cosmos. Through mystery measured extreme; facing void yet difficult; then know wondrous spirit view; there are thousands of paths. Foot born complete; mysterious heart wall gone; then know seeking heart is fixed; lucky to be born so. Therefore many are the followers; few are the consummates. Yet the true use is a heart without hardness; above towards the jade truth’s feeling; also must be without difficulty going; above seeking supreme life’s solidity; also must obtain jade reflection to shine equally; finally becoming emperor’s prolonged grace. Wandering then countless without hope; focused then hope and all comes. Those with external feelings wish to dwell alive; hearing Dao and crawling on knees; Dao silent then all perish; facing mountains legs cold; crossing rivers blood waves shaking; five bodies attack at not fallen valley; one body startled violently at death and birth shore; this suffices to exhaust heaven’s years of toil and bitterness; outside of fame and rules only. All due to mind dispersed not one; feelings uproar unstable; gradually competing daily increasing; altogether unaware; breaking right losing resolve; confused dream Dao forest; how can one speak of supreme Dao?

Now I shall reveal to you the spirit’s true supreme art, the method of heavenly immortals, the great secret essentials, long preserved in the upper scripture. If you desire to ascend to heaven by day, to go north to Jade Emperor, riding dragon flying scene, palace and hall of Supreme Clarity, flinging jade wheel, circling five stars, joining sun to raise light, entering moon to penetrate brightness, you should obtain the hidden book of Jade Clarity, wear the divine golden tiger talisman. The style of Yu and Li’s red text summons sun to rise; tying yellow banner dwells with moon; True Cave mysterious scripture; five stars harmoniously roaming; Great True Cave scripture; seven generations dispersing grudges; thirty-nine chapters; seven ancestral immortal heavens; Huang Lao’s eight ways; nine true divine books. Ascending to spirit books purple text; soul and spirit refined and restrained; Golden Gate making record; five elders’ precious registers; Jade Court’s hundred herbs; Supreme Clarity pure medicine; Jade Clarity wisdom scripture copied words.

Then it says: Six pure energies flourishing; mysterious light eight corners; wind solid cloud son; emperor grand jade portal; gold spread pod brilliance; broad heaven yellow wood; flourishing city jade buds; night mountain fire jade; riding phoenix forest singing vinegar; western Yao jade wine; central China purple honey; northern tomb green hill; crimson ford golden marrow; moon essence sun longevity; vermilion river coral beads; Peng Mountain literary ugliness; washing water seven stems; breaking mountain electric willows; northern gathering mysterious fortress’s splendid scallions; looking up rinsing cloud water’s vermilion honey; night ox lying bones; spirit I yellow lacquer; empty unity spirit melon; four calamities one reality; dark city qilin courage; flaming mountain night sun; east gathering Fusang’s cinnabar berries; bending down gathering long abyss’s upright algae; upper harmonizing nine turns flying jade; lower swallowing blue mysterious rosy treasure; Great Void tying rings; pure maiden embracing; purple dragon youth; nine-colored phoenix brain; Great Ultimate hidden herbs; vermilion tree sun path; Supreme Old Rainbow plum; Milky Way great grass; southern palace huge pearl; western village supporting old; three beams dragon flower; spirit concubine’s seeking, some get to eat; postheaven and aging. This is what Jade Clarity wears; what the Supreme treasures; able to ascend flying scene sky; divide morning into myriad paths; guard and protect imperial essence; morning pour nine brains. Yet this Dao is greatest; wondrous spirit reflecting afar; not attainable fully by those who eat blood and flesh; only hearing the mysterious sound to scatter filth; listening to wind Qi to chase filth. Above can float utterly Great Beginning; below can exorcise demons and cure illness. If not virtue echo root spirit, who can flow together in spiritual ease? Therefore supreme dispelling demons is by regulating Qi in myriad passages; hence the supreme true medicine’s name; to nurture spirit and drive out evil; truly faithful words.

Next, Supreme Clarity secluded herbs; Supreme Nine Times; eight light great harmony; spotted dragon black fetus; patterned tiger white foam; arising from western hill; seven mysteries flying joints; nine holes jade beads; cloud nectar refined wine; mysterious garden beautiful land; bell mountain white glue; gold born blue spread; Lang Feng stone brain; black river coral; Meng mountain white phoenix; jade thigh spirit hill; blue luan golden blood; east flower vermilion leaf; nine joints interlaced; Great Subtle purple hemp; jade flower jade fruit; flowing abyss whale pearl; red river crimson wall; north drawing Great Ultimate’s well; middle gathering literary vermilion’s veins; cloud court divine peach; Kun garden level sparrow; night essence day grass; green ford blue reed; true palace fragrant altar; mysterious capital three covers; left wears jade youth’s light; right draws jade maiden’s Qi; above summons spirit origin; below drinks mysterious stream; looking up grasping orchid garden’s jade essence; bending down gathering round hill’s purple [blank]; white water spirit clam; eight heavens red garlic; myriad years one life; flowing light nine ranks; some get to eat; postheaven and passing. This is what the Heavenly Emperor wears; Supreme’s precious treasure; not heard by Great Ultimate; attained by middle truth; reciting its chapter can produce wondrous flow and eternal life; chanting its name can uproot illness and sever essence.

Indeed the chapters on wisdom, and the scripture on dispelling demons, are utmost abridgments of wondrous forms; spirit herb supreme medicine; true emperor’s pure words; also roughly stirred in Daoist eyes. Wearing talisman bearing truth; mouth chanting nine pure; may suffice to measure all demons’ nature; body source receiving Qi; morning refining jade mystery; must guard it beyond ten thousand springs. The four souls nine spirits then meet and engender in one body’s use; using them is nearly joyful.

Next, the Great Ultimate’s ranks, four truths always treasured, called nine stones refining smoke; elixir liquid jade nourishment; Xun first flowing pearls; jade flower stone essence; elixir furnace golden liquid; purple flower rainbow brilliance; Supreme Clarity nine turns; five cloud nectar; mysterious frost descending snow; leaping three yellows; east winning white incense; blue wave green coin; high hill remaining grain; accumulated stones flying fields; Great Void returning elixir; Great Qin mysterious firmness; long light flowing grass; cloud youth flying thousand; also able to cause ascending light rising body to heaven and darkness. These are what heavenly immortals wear; flying spirits refine; not what Lu You heard, nor what mountain guests saw. Also must know nine transformations ten changes hidden earthly eight arts; then able to widely roam mysterious void; step backwards to heavenly fork; ride clouds and dragons; soar without bounds.

Next also are thirty-six herbs; flying furnace refining smoke; yang water moonlight; five stone fats; filling living five viscera; refining appearance changing body; and splendid flowers cloud flakes; gold powder jade softness; also able to extend life and increase years; may reach ten thousand years.

Next also are mysterious water cloud nectar; five yellows dense spirit essence; thousand stone jade drink; myriad blue vermilion brilliant; white cart flying joint fruit; flowing horse purple wood yellow; one dose immediately makes man live a thousand years; daily dose daily extends; year follows medicine’s advance; life and medicine change; also endless spiritual substances; immortal strange prescriptions. Long living thousand years means taking but one piece of jade tablet only. Beneath all these medicines are first pine [blank] yin fat; mountain ginger hiding spirit; Chang pu men winter; great victory yellow essence; chrysanthemum wolfberry; cliff honey poria; peach peel ze xie; Wei rong yellow lotus; Sheng ma earth yellow; red board vermilion brilliant; cloud flying water cinnamon; myriad things’ essence; their kinds many; roughly enumerated a few. Taking them slightly benefits; cannot permanently extend; highest seven hundred years; lowest three or four hundred years; fearing inability to discern long enjoyment; no time limit to ascend azure heaven. Also able to bring forth light and color on body; return to white youthful face; employ thousand spirits; become earth immortals; walk five mountains; roam famous waves and mountains; therefore not self-exclude impending death. Also gradually seek supreme medicine to renew oneself; then easily advance ranks; why cling to old and not change; take limits to serve teeth? Yet such Dao should be gentle and weak and warm and kind; utmost sincere and single-minded; pure body and clean; harmonizing five viscera; settling form and recalling scene; preserving and protecting hundred spirits; guarding soul refining spirit; removing filth and clearing dross; roaming mind weighing mystery; feelings without flowing and vanity desires; embracing one going alone; harboring no infant dust’s burdens; fumigating pungent five spices; not near mouth; rich nourishing blood flavor; not passing intestines; mountain dwelling empty places; not managing outside affairs; thus above can indulge mystery and preserve truth; summon divine talismans; below can feed eight stones; breathe liquid nectar.

The Yin elixir guards inner chamber arts; yellow path red Qi joining benefits; seventy-nine morning essence breathing essentials; sixty-one returning elixir male-female methods; although one may obtain immortal name, Supreme Clarity does not compare virtues; though equally bring transformation, Supreme Old Lord does not deem it precious; these are filthy immortals and turbid truths; certainly cannot enter Jade Gate. Further in rugged ice-walking, many see overturned carriage’s defeat; even those intact are stinking chaotic earth immortals only. Seeking high models is insufficient and misguided; focusing near is less than guiding Qi ingestion and breathing; embryo breath closing heart preserving thought arts; mysterious spirit middle chapters; golden chamber hidden meanings; yellow court inside and outside; Supreme Clarity keeping records; all such Dao, several thousand matters, all circulate among the vulgar; signs known since middle ages; after Xuanyuan, by these Dao and ascensions, people number mountains countless. Such diligent heart utmost; guarding essence earnest
