## Twelve Chapters of the Supreme Clarity Golden Decrees

In banquet within the palace of Great Rosy Clouds,  
The Golden Portal shines with purple clarity.  
In the immortal chamber the Great Primordial dwells,  
Four pavilions all adorned with vermilion and jade.  
Casting the wheel at the hollow ford,  
Reining the bridle, dancing the green carriage.  
Jade radiance flies the cloud canopy,  
The western consort bears the brocaded banner.  
Suddenly beyond the dust and turbidity,  
The fair court of the fairy appears.  
Long cultivated sympathies await their time to come,  
What is gained is already within the dark.  
Riding the wind, thoughts ascend the nine heavens,  
Together we revel in the stability of elixir glory.  
Turning from the things of this world,  
How know they not the spirit in the void?

Northward ascending the mysterious dark portal,  
Hand in hand passing the lofty net.  
Incense smoke disperses over eight scenes,  
Mysterious winds stir the crimson waves.  
Looking upward beyond the resounding ford,  
Casting the eyes down on the winding mountain recesses.  
Whistling songs rise and sing among the clouds,  
The phoenix cries in the nine grottoes of rosy light.  
Riding the qi floating in the great void,  
Wherefore step the mountain recesses?  
Golden tokens command the feathered spirits,  
Leading troops to crush myriad demons.  
Rinsing and drawing the perfect morning brightness,  
Accumulating spring just budding teeth.  
In the midst of the restless throng,  
Not knowing what to do or how.

Northern ridges thick with misty vapour,  
Crimson trees bear purple blossoms.  
Blue herbs fall in the phoenix forest,  
Green cliffs flourish in the mountain recesses.  
The spirit pavilion soars in the great void,  
Jade chambers join the great rosy clouds.  
Clouds rise within the winding chamber,  
Eight winds fly the dark sands.  
Nine strings play on the imperial ramparts,  
The dragon roars chanting tokens of harmony.  
Fanning the five sacred mountain ridges,  
Grasping the tokens to summon myriad demons.  
Looking around in a moment’s space,  
Suddenly the lifespan is already past.  
Alas for those born at dawn,  
How know they the length of their days?

In the corner of the rare forest palace,  
The spirit moves through the vast and desolate gloom.  
The highest pavilion reflects the six courts,  
Great and small all complete in freedom.  
The dragon blows the entwined cloud canopy,  
The tiger roars and frightens myriad branches.  
Three simples open the high scroll,  
The rosy clouds flourish in the morning sky.  
Feathered banners stretch across the spirit ford,  
The purple carriage flies with splendid plumes.  
Reining the bridle beyond the nine heavens,  
Looking up and down with boundless ease.  
Dust and foam collect the clamorous filth,  
The spirit lost and the qi also fading.  
Why not seek the distant charioteer?  
Eight thousand years but one morning.

At court crossing the azure sea waves,  
Flying wheels leave the green chamber.  
High chant the verses of comrades,  
Covering the Canglang midst.  
Three contracts of jade host the heavens,  
Five appointments of eastern flower youths.  
Feathered billows rise with the morning emperor,  
Banqueting here in the Vast Cold palace.  
Eight notes played in the void,  
The purple phoenix sings the spirit wind.  
Crimson clouds restrain the bright radiance,  
Eight scenes fly in the great void.  
Chewing the jade spring ford,  
Vastly flourishing again the infant mist.  
Supreme joy returns to the five spirits,  
Years accumulating the blade of kalpas.  
Shedding sandals, what difficulty?  
Labour and worry lost in the heavenly void.

Morning carriage drives the dawn radiance,  
Light reins set forth the purple clarity.  
Floating clouds hasten the great rosy clouds,  
Raising the canopy in the Vast Cold court.  
The high perfected guard the imperial chamber,  
Palace ponds attract western spirits.  
Ten supreme five empty hollows,  
Flying smoke encircles the brocade screen.  
Tiger fans the spirit wind to celebrate,  
Purple clouds return the dragon carriage.  
Suddenly piercing the eight directions,  
A glance and the lifespan is already brief.  
The distant flute of the mysterious contest,  
Why not seek the Great Life?

The spirit garden grows the hidden ganoderma,  
Kun pool waters the shining fields.  
Looking up to the jade clarity portal,  
Steep and towering over crimson ford.  
Purple clouds reflect the winding seat,  
Five clouds shine on the nine mysteries.  
Eight winds rise to the utmost universe,  
Dark vapour between the green pavilions.  
Three origins lodge in the western palace,  
Eastern flower holds the fair maid.  
Northern ocean sings seven howls,  
Bright maidens sing southern truth.  
Playing the percussion joining the vermilion pitch,  
Jade tokens raise the six strings.  
Together contracting the peace not by fate,  
All ascend the vast phoenix summit.  
Simultaneously commanding myriad demons,  
Dwelling here the thousand black hosts.  
Transcending and coming, what difficulty?  
Thus opening the unending years.

Riding the qi looking at the hollow void,  
Taking the radiance resting amid the nine heavens.  
Moving the dense vast brightness of feathers,  
The dark canopy gives birth to the void uninterrupted.  
Eight smokes whirl the airy wheel,  
The track halts not a year.  
Striking the percussion the eight voids resound,  
My horse also lacks a ford.  
Grasping the token entering the eastern flower,  
Evening banquet on the peak of the mysterious garden.  
Binding the girdle taking five spirits,  
Loosening and lifting the fair person.  
Mysterious sympathy spontaneously moves,  
Floating about also with affinity.  
Together borne on the soaring wing,  
One flap moves a hundred million.  
Descending radiance floats the dark radiance,  
The purple pavilion rides the cloud to journey.  
Looking upward beyond the golden portal,  
Casting downward on the western flower city.

Eastern flower opens the five radiances,  
Spirit light shines forth the seven spirits.  
Shading and reflecting the three branching candles,  
Flowing currents mingle freely in the dark.  
Winds stir the hollow universe,  
Incense smoke disperses in the jade court.  
Hand in hand with the weaving maiden’s pity,  
Twin collars fall in brocaded green.  
Circling round the crossing feathered banners,  
Splendid canopy inclines with the clouds.  
Banqueting and resting beyond the ninth degree,  
Right and wrong do not ensnare me.  
Embracing the void within the mud pellet,  
Heavenly form daily more budding.  
How much more the cave’s faults and filth,  
In the midst intensely desolate life.

Supporting the mulberry green empty peak,  
Crimson clouds blossom with faint brightness.  
The wave terrace embraces the void above,  
Four views reflect pure clarity.  
Flying radiance reins the purple wheel,  
Three simples bridle the cinnabar carriage.  
Reclining in the great emperor’s hall,  
Lofty and towering the mother’s court.  
Washing feet in the blue current waves,  
Uplifting the contract and the jade wine jar.  
At dawn turning riding the wind’s fan,  
Fluttering drifting sometimes inclining.  
Temporarily resting amid the mountain vapour,  
Returning the carriage to the good true ford.  
Mysterious assembly mutually important,  
Wandering drifting in the gloomy dark.  
Beginning to know honour and shame and fortune,  
At last comprehending the hastening years.

The winding chamber can be pure and tranquil,  
Wishing the spirit to await the day’s fulfilment.  
Why discourse on the common path,  
That a hundred ailments arise from this?  
The heavenly court gives birth to golden splendour,  
Within to manifest yin and evil.  
Jade valleys join the mysterious ministers,  
Jade qi mutually supports the net.  
Heavenly truth stands beyond the distant sun,  
Flying herbs spit forth spirit sands.  
Clear dawn examines the heavenly horse,  
Returning the carriage to the mysterious divine home.  
Immortals come entering the chamber,  
Again to extinguish a hundred evils.

The Way begins with purification,  
Diligence in practice to ascend the golden portal.  
Therefore the great law bridge is set,  
To universally ferry all beings.  
Repaying the grace and virtue of former lives,  
The heart of the Way transcends all.  
Six purifications observe the hollow void,  
Ten direct rites spirit response through.  
The five elders carve the immortal names,  
Cloud chariots mutually welcome and pay homage.  
The body flies to ascend the mysterious capital,  
Seven ancestors all set free.

Thus end the Twelve Chapters of the Supreme Clarity Golden Decrees.
