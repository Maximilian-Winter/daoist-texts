The Supreme Scripture of the Radiant Flight of Light, the Essence of Sun and Moon of Shangqing

Great indeed is the Palace of the Seven Treasures, where naturally the lotus flowers arise. Brilliantly it shines with the light of night, a faint radiance illumining the abode of the spirits.

Looking upward at the Mysterious and True Platform, the cloud towers rise lofty and precipitous. Flowing and radiant it shines through the mysterious void, dispatching troops that crush ten thousand demons.

It draws out suffering and guilt from the difficult midst, accumulating fragrant infant teeth. Praising and chanting to deliver the seven ancestors, gathering blessings in harmony.

The supreme marvel issues divine radiance, formless, silent, and without shadow. Its boundary extends beyond the confines, suddenly and universally aiding those who proceed.

It lifts and delivers from the seven mysterious sufferings, vast and serene, spacious and enduring in stillness. Drawing across the ford of the five sufferings, responding accordingly, ascending on clouds.

The Lamp King pervades the ten directions; the dark and the bright, none are unknown to him. The august Mysterious and True Platform, brightly shining, reflects the ten directions.

Vast and cold the gate is opened and released; difficult are the many bodies that penetrate within. The seven ancestors resolve the three paths; no more is there anxiety or vexation.

Bowing the head, I worship the Lamp King, deliverer named of the Eastern Heroic Palace.

I am the master of the sea vessel; therefore I can ferry the three returns. The light of night penetrates the secluded valleys; body and mind are cleansed and opened.

The empty smoke disperses to the eight extremes; the clear brightness shines into the Supreme Subtlety. Paying homage and chanting the unsurpassed teaching, how lofty are the blessings and felicitations!

Swift and connected the paths open; silent and full they fill the eight hills. The three pure ones give birth to shadowy clouds; the empty light illumines the Great Nothing.

I gaze deeply through the utmost ten directions; at ease, scattering suffering and sorrow.

The flying wheel fills the great void; formless and without trace. Its track falls as it will, the rustling entering the dark silence.

Clad in rough robes, I chant the light of night; the myriad heavens descend to confer their blessing.

Wickedness and blessing arise without fixed rule; near is the freedom of the human body. Accumulated merit and suffering are few; morning and evening one establishes fields of blessing.

Returning in submission to the Way of Non-action, in the end one will embody the utmost truth. Splendid shines the bright radiance, clearly penetrating the dark borders.

Blazing forth beyond the dark, blessings descend, accumulating and misfortunes are removed. The schools and academies observe the ten directions, universally aiding all people.

I tighten my reins of the Mysterious and True, carrying in hand the jade tally. The bright lamp knocks the jade bell, the response heard already entering the void.

One vision reveals the three treasures; it releases me from the accumulation of worldly obscurity.

Extending and lingering in the Palace of the Seven Treasures, the turning wheel curves the mountain pass. Rest is added, conditions cover the house; who knows how many years have passed?

The mouth rinses the golden liquid essence; accumulated longevity begins the infant flower. The lower ones strive in glory; they do not understand what is to be done.

The mysterious radiance reflects the winding valley; vast and clear it penetrates the abyssal springs. Reflecting the flowing growth, brilliant it entwines the Jade Capital Mountain.

The seven ancestors return to fetal birth, ascending beyond the intervalless.

Dense and luxuriant the pavilion shines; flourishing it enters the Supreme Purity. Heaven’s huntsmen surround on left and right; the turning wheel returns, inclining southward.

Vaguely beyond nine years, temporarily arising but not awakening the spirit. The seven ancestors attain the embryonic immortals; the Southern Palace again receives their birth.

The flying wheel fills the hollow void, glancing over a thousand fathoms.

Principle and悟 (wù, enlightenment) are equal in feeling; the five smokes are absorbed and then dispersed. The body is light in non-action; the four luminaries respond and divide the seasons.

The three evil paths of hell, all obtain release from their cages with difficulty.

Whistling and singing on the Nine Mysterious Platform, cliffs and ridges wash the rushing ford. The heart awakens, the six senses are free; the sun abandons dust and turbid confusion.

Flowing rosy clouds shine on the golden chamber; the empty hall disperses the mysterious incense. Essence and spirit bring about the descent of the divine; form is solitary, the Way likewise divided.

Suddenly glancing at myriad kalpas, how may one grasp hundreds of millions of years?

The fair gardens flourish the divine steps; vermilion jade shines in the purple court. Flowing wind drums the empty cave; jade horns shade the void and sound.

Purple smoke entwines the winding house; red brilliance circles the green canopy. The flying essence fills the mysterious canopy; feathered segments shine in Supreme Purity.

Clear and serene the nine equal boundaries; roaming and advancing, playing in the city of wind.

Returning floating over the five mountain ridges, rein loosened over the city walls and passes. Looking upward at the Mysterious and True Gate, the cloud towers rise lofty and precipitous.

Fragrance returns winding about the palace; bright lamps praise the spirits in song.

The neck receives the birth of sun and moon light; submission is made to the Lamp King’s Scripture. It opens wide, penetrating the eight extremes; lotus flowers arise therefrom.

The Dragon King contains the sea water, therefore able to rinse the incense vase. The Brahmin receives this hymn, thereby attaining celestial birth.

The human king receives this scripture, his life equals ten thousand myriads of years. Blessings extend to the seven ancestors, no longer is there anxiety or infantile worries.

Posterity has limitless causes; generation after generation honours the worthy and chaste.

Three separate hymns

Song of the Lady of the Purple Origin from the South Pole

The mysterious waves shake the vast billows; the great ford drums the myriad streams. Driving the light, I glance at the six voids, thinking to roam with the perfected ones.

The exquisite song is not matched by me; the pure tone has no one to whom to be cast. In the clouds I ride the jade wheel; who is the companion in the dust?

White clouds gather the spiritual radiance; dense shadows enter the Supreme Subtlety. The green reins gather the feathered wheel; the emerald canopy follows the wind’s turning.

The golden palace opens the jade chamber; the whirlwind terrace and jade towers stand in array. They extend my dragon pavilion room; I ascend the steps of the Void Emperor.

Though the body wheels through the generations’ transformations, the soul and spirit are not momentarily extinguished.

Accumulated blessings and heavy karma; past vows are completed in the present. Marvelous indeed is the wisdom of emptiness and nothingness; the perfected one contains the true and issues forth.

Heavenly dragons bathe in fragrant ford; they wash my refined embryonic substance. Whom shall the wondrous words believe? The spiritual appointment in the mysterious summons is fulfilled.

The heart of the Way transcends the three realms; mixed and complete, it manifests the original unity. Alone I realize that fundamentally there is no form; wandering freely in the great vehicle’s leisure.
