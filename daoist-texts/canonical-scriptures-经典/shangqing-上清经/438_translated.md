Record of the Many Immortals of the Primordial Beginning Supreme Truth

Ge Hong’s Pillow Book

In the flood of years, I have observed the treasures of heaven and earth, the palatial courts of the highest sages, the supreme and most exalted gods and immortals; yet I still have not known the root of the utmost subtlety. On the night of the Yi-chou day of last month, at midnight, in quiet study upon Mount Luofu, suddenly a fearful wind arose, fragrant odors mingled confusedly, dragons roared and tigers howled, pacing restlessly in the empty air. In a moment, purple clouds covered the forest, and suddenly appeared a true man. His eyes were square pupils, his neck bore a round radiance, his countenance heavenly and peerless; he rode a white qilin’s chariot, upheld a standard of nine banners, girded with brocade embroidered with phoenix patterns, wearing a crown of six connections. His age was about twenty. Attendants bore lamps of night-light, and a thousand jade-feathered guards. He called himself the Supreme True King of the Mysterious Capital, and asked: "Art thou Ge Hong? For what cause dost thou seek long life?" I bowed and respectfully disclosed my reasons, kneeling and saluting. The spirit said to me: "Thou art recorded in the Nine Heavens’ felicitous register, riding fortune and excelling in talents; after a thousand years more, thou shalt be known as the Immortal Lord of Supreme Purity. Now thou art to undergo a distant transformation and depart the world; choose a dwelling in the Western Village, and together ascend the summit of Mount Taihua, within the cinnabar palace. Return thence in the morning court; use Dragon Abyss to substitute thyself, secretly and silently departing, so none shall know the present truth. Thou art keen to explore tomb records, intelligent and outstanding among men, able to resolve hindrances and awaken perplexities; truly a wondrous talent. Yet thou dost not know the palaces of the true immortals, the abodes of the highest sages. I now depart, to reveal the plans for our joint task; no longer shall I tarry long." I prostrated again. Thereupon the true god caused his attendant to take up brush and paper, and orally delivered wondrous words. When finished, he gave the writing in my left hand, saying: "I go to the abbot of the Celestial Immortal Officials of the Square Measure; I shall then return to meet thee; be diligent. I depart." I saw his chariot rise slowly and greatly, then vanish out of sight.

The "True Record" says: In former times, ere the two forms were divided, the chaotic vastness was dark and obscure, no shapes yet formed; heaven, earth, sun, and moon were not yet completed. It resembled an egg of a chicken, chaotic and dark yellow. Already was there the true man Pangu, the spirit of heaven and earth, who called himself the Primordial Heavenly King, wandering within it. After four kalpas, the heaven’s form was like a mighty cover, bound to nothing above, rooted to nothing below; beyond heaven and earth was boundless void, the profound vast space, silent and soundless. The primordial energy was vast, shaped like water; there were no mountains below, no stars above. The accumulated energy was firm and hard, yet the great softness subdued and united it. Heaven and earth floated within it, turning without direction; if this energy were not, heaven and earth would not be born. Heaven was like a dragon, turning and circling within the clouds. Another four kalpas passed; the two forms began to separate, three and sixty thousand li apart; cliffs and stones bled to form rivers; water bred primordial worms; primordial worms bred shore creepers; shore creepers bred hard whiskers; hard whiskers bred dragons. The Primordial Heavenly King dwelt at the center of heaven, on a mountain named Jade Capital Mountain; palaces therein were adorned with gold and jade. He constantly drew in the heavenly breath above and drank the earthly springs below. After two kalpas more, suddenly was born the Primordial Jade Maiden, amid the accumulated blood of a rock valley; she emerged and could speak, complete in human form, with heavenly and peerless countenance, often roaming the thick earth; inhaling the primal heaven, she was called the Primordial Sacred Mother. The Primordial Lord descended to meet her, and together they exchanged breath and formed essence, summoning her to the upper palace. At this time, the two energies were mingled and entangled, enveloping the breath; yin and yang harmonized, neither hot nor cold; heaven gained unity and clarity, earth gained unity and peace; neither breathed again; the breath diffused and gathered, naturally full and complete. The rise of the Great Way was never greater than this. The condensation was firm and solid, and thus immortal. Gold, jade, and pearls were the essence of heaven and earth; taking them completed the harmony with heaven and earth. The Primordial Lord passed one kalpa, then begat the Taiyuan Mother, who gave birth to the Heavenly Emperor Thirteen Heads, ruling thirty-six thousand years; recorded as Fusang Great Emperor East King Duke, called the Primordial Yang Father; also begat Nine Light Mysterious Ladies, called the Supreme True Western Queen Mother, the Lady of the Western Han. The Heavenly Emperor named Thirteen Heads later begat the Earth Emperor, Earth Emperor Eleven Heads; Earth Emperor begat Human Emperor Nine Heads; each ruled thirty-six thousand years. The holy perfect ones appeared, receiving the way and heavenly patterns; without acting, they founded the beginning; the mingled heaven’s mandate was entrusted. The three sovereign heavenly patterns transmitted to the present are those declared here; thus they can summon the great saints above heaven and gods below, controlling all without exception. Hence the Heavenly True Emperor and the Three Heavenly True Kings ride the chariot of nine dragons. Next come the Eight Emperors: the Great Court Clan, Paoxi, Shennong, Zhu Rong, the Five Dragon Clans, their descendants, now ruling the Five Sacred Mountains. Therefore, in the flourishing eras of the previous generations, the Three Kings reached their utmost. The Three Kings were Xia Yu, Yin Tang, and Zhou Wu. Thus the pure customs declined, changes in the Book of Changes arose, and rites flourished; yet rites became the origin of disorder. At the end of Zhou, yang was weak and yin strong; the country had many widows; western Rong tribes raised golden weapons, and strange laws appeared. Soon the Nine Provinces were submerged, the imperial enterprise ruined and desolate; these words were true. Thereafter such matters appeared. In the flourishing age of the Way, men were chaotic; strange laws prevailed; the people were cunning and deceitful.

Hong said: This matter is profound and remote, beyond the knowledge of ordinary scholars. With my humble talent, I was fortunate to receive the glance of the highest sage, to discourse on the secret treasures of heaven and earth, to reveal the source of the utmost subtlety; I have arranged the teachings and inscribed them on silk, to be a final thought. Those who do not distinguish with pure heart, beware not to disclose the Primordial Beginning. Thus I have left these traces, to show to the wise of the world.

The "True Record" says: The Mysterious Capital Jade Peak Seven Treasures Mountain circles ninety thousand li, above the Great Luo. Upon the city are Seven Treasures Palaces; within the palaces are Seven Treasures Terraces, three palaces above, middle, and below, like one palace city, with two hundred and forty gates on one face. In the four directions grow eight rows of treasured forests, with green leaves and vermilion fruit, and five-coloured mushrooms. On top are twelve thousand varieties of mushrooms; in the marsh lotus flowers measure ten zhang. The upper palace is governed by Pangu True Man, Primordial Heavenly King, and Primordial Sacred Mother; the middle palace by the Supreme True Man Golden Gate Old Lord; the lower palace by the Nine Heavens True Emperor and Three Heavens True King. Jade Capital has eight hundred and ten thousand heavenly roads, connecting eight hundred and ten thousand mountains and caves. The great saints who have attained the way are all granted palaces and residences, all Seven Treasures Palaces or towers, either on the Five Sacred Mountains, or on famous mountains, mountain and grass immortals’ abodes; altogether eighty-one thousand places. From ancient times till now there is the saying: nine times nine equal eighty-one; this is the ultimate heavenly road to Jade Capital Mountain. The highest immortals receiving heaven’s mandate, thrice daily attend the Mysterious Capital Supreme True Man; though separated by millions of li, their coming and going is but a single step. How can worldly men know this? Many immortals attend the Fusang Duke thrice daily, or the Western Queen Mother thrice daily. Jade Capital Golden Gate is the Supreme True Man’s realm, where the Monthly Triad attends the Primordial Heavenly King, Supreme True Man. The disciples of the Primordial are like emperors, with ministers and chancellors. Golden Gate Laozi is the Supreme True Man’s disciple. Fusang Great Emperor is the Yang Qi of the Primordial, governing the East. Hence worldly emperors’ sons correspond to the Eastern Palace.

The Western Han Nine Light Lady is the origin of Yin Qi, governing the West. Therefore called Wood Duke and Metal Mother, revered gods of heaven and earth, refining primordial qi, producing all things, harmonizing yin and yang; the brightness of sun and moon all come from them. Their spirits endure, their life has no end; embracing the One without separation, thus enduring long. When heaven loses yin and yang, water and drought become irregular; when man loses yin and yang, spirit root and life are exhausted. The world’s people cannot preserve the One and keep the Three; cultivating life but returning to death is fitting, how then to blame later? I shall again, within a thousand years, summon the heir to ascend the Supreme Golden Gate, to court and feast at Jade Capital. These words are but a flash of lightning, not long lasting; now I may roam the Five Sacred Mountains, gather spiritual mushrooms, seek the friends of hidden immortals, wandering freely without acting; my words may be trusted and hoped for.

Fusang Great Emperor dwells within the Blue Sea, dwelling land four sides square thirty thousand li; above is Supreme True Palace, jade-green city ten thousand li, growing many trees with leaves like mulberry. There are mulberry trees reaching thousands of zhang, twenty times round; two grow from the same root in pairs, leaning upon each other, called Fusang; the palace resembles Jade Capital. Countless immortals, on mysterious isles and square measures, have not ascended to heaven, are here; six ten-thousands li from the coast of Kuaiji, governed by Supreme Purity Immortal Lord. Mount Penglai faces northeast shore of the great eastern sea; the mountain circles five thousand li; the sea waves rise to the heavens; governed by Nine Qi Elder Lord.

Kunlun Mysterious Garden, gold as moat city, thousand li each side; on the city are five Golden Terraces, twelve jade towers, houses of crystal splendour, purple and green cinnabar chambers, treasures of gold and jade reach the sky, great beasts ten thousand zhang, spiritual incense in countless millions; Western Queen Mother of Nine Lights governs here, with countless immortals.

Master Guangcheng is now Zhongshan True Man, Nine Heavens Immortal King. In Han times, the Four Sages, An Qi, Peng Zu, now all assist him.

Wuchengzi, Limozi are True Men of Mount Min. Now Xuanzhi and Yuzi are Lords of Mount Min.

Taihao is the Blue Emperor, governing Mount Daizong. Zhuanxu is the Black Emperor, governing Mount Taiheng. Zhu Rong is the Red Emperor, governing Mount Henghuo. Xuanyuan is the Yellow Emperor, governing Mount Songgao. Jintian is the White Emperor, governing Mount Huayin.

The above five are the Five Emperors.

Yao governed Mount Xionger, Shun Mount Jishi, Yu Mount Gaizhu, Tang Mount Xuanji, Qingwu Mount Chang, and Mount Fengxiu long.

The above five assisted the Five Emperors, managing their affairs; after one kalpa, assistants succeeded them.

Xuyou and Chaofu are now attendants in the Nine Heavens, Dukes of Mount Ji. Xia Qi and Zhou Fa received writings as Four Extreme Bright Dukes; some dwell at Luofeng, others in caves. The three great Zhou are True Men of Jiangling; two are on Mount Jinhua. Han Gaozu and Guangwu both guests of Siming. Zhou Lingwang is now attendant of Great Void, governing Mount Bolong. Musician Le and his whole family attained immortality, not yet ascending, dwell within the square measure’s chamber; receive the great mysterious life register, with five mushrooms as food. Guo Jingchun is registrar of destinies, governing Void Terrace. Zuo Yuanfang now is Heavenly Pillar True Man, overseeing Immortal Lord. Ge Xuan received order from Golden Gate Lord, as Supreme Ultimate Left Immortal Duke, governing Mount Gaizhu; also on Mount Nuji, often riding tiger and horse. Xu Ying first as Immortal of Mount Huolin. Xu Mu settled his dwelling in Huayang cave, a True Man. Xu Yufu north of Tongchu, ranked as True Man, not yet in command. Bao Liang is lord of the underworld, wearing Mount Qian True Man’s robe; again five hundred years hence shall serve as Kun soldier attendant. Zheng Siyuan dwells in Nanhuo, often riding tiger, leopard, white deer; no office yet. Cai Yulei is Eastern Ghost Emperor, governing Mount Taoqiu. Zhang Heng and Yang Yun are Northern Ghost Emperors, governing Mount Luofeng. Du Ziren is Southern Ghost Emperor, governing Mount Luofu, commanding Qiang and barbarian ghosts. Zhou Qi and Ji Kang are Central Ghost Emperors, governing Mount Baodu. Zhao Wenhe and Wang Zhenren are Western Ghost Emperors, governing Mount Bozhong.

The earth immortals roam the Five Sacred Mountains, morning court the Western Queen Mother, evening rest at Mount Zhongshan; though not yet ascending to heaven, this joy is hard to express. At Tongchu’s mansion, easily moved palace, only this enjoyment exists. Among the famous mountains, year by year immortals depart; worldly men do not see, do not believe in immortals; how pitiful and lamentable! Those who study without regard to body and life, whose heart and will are pure and clear, I have not seen who go forth in vain. Some cultivate without diligence; diligent yet fail to remove desires for pleasure; the three karmas and ten evils remain unchanged; it is like embracing a stone while going to Longjin.

Wu, Yue, and Liang Yi have clear and pure air, thus many immortals. Hence the region of Chengdu, the domain of Danyang, southeast of Kuaiji, is the thoroughfare of heavenly roads, well suited for cultivation and esteem. These multitudes of immortals, and those who have passed their mandates and received writings, are countless; unable to record all. Those who dwell among the small mountains are also briefly enumerated.

Master Guigu is Supreme Mystery Teacher, governing Mount Qingcheng. Prince Qiao is Golden Gate attendant, governing Mount Tong. Chisong is Kunlin Immortal Lord, governing Mount Nanyue. Prince Deng is Lesser Heavenly King, governing Mount Wangwu. Gu Zhu, Boyi, Shuqi, etc., all are Nine Heavens Vice Ministers, governing Mount Tiantai. Kong Qiu is Supreme Ultimate Supreme True Lord, governing Mount Jiuyi. Yan Hui received writings, first attendant of Mingquan, later Three Heavens Director of Truth. Seventy-two persons, named Xuanzhou, have three thousand disciples, not passing through North Feng’s gate. Xiang Yishan is Penglai Sima. Duke Zhou Dan is Northern Emperor’s teacher, governing Mount Jingge. Zhuang Zhou is Supreme Mystery Doctor, governing Mount Jing. Sun Quan appointed, governing also Mount Jing. Zhang Daoling is Three Heavens Master of Laws, commanding Six Voids, often attending Golden Gate, the Supreme’s mainstay, governing Mount Lu. Three masters dwell together. Wang Fangping now is Prime Minister, governing Mountain Wu of the Moon Branch State. Mo Di is Supreme Ultimate Immortal Minister, governing Mount Majian. Xu Lailuo is Supreme Ultimate True Man, governing Mount Kuocang, small palace on Mount Tiantai. Chen Anshi governs Small Terrace Mountain. Yan Junping now governs Mount Emei. Qu Yuan is Sea Lord, commanding the Eight Seas. Wang Bi is Northern Sea Inspector. Guo Shengzi is Langfeng True Man. Lady Wei governs Mount Nanyue. Pei Qingling governs Mount Siming. Ma Mingsheng now at Mount Zhong. Yin Changsheng is Earth Lung True Man.

Sun Deng is Wenqiu True Man. Jiuhua True Consort governs Mount Xiagai, or on Mount Long. Wang Chang and Zhao Sheng, both received writings, are Mount Lu Zhongzheng, One Three Heavens Protector. Han Zhong now is Mount Huolin True Man. Langya Yuji is Supreme Void Left Clerk Attendant.

The Three Mao are in charge of life preservation registration and non-monitoring, residing in Huayang cave mansion in northern dwelling; resting on Mount Bao are several thousand, small mountains not fewer than a hundred, all are divine mountains. Now briefly testifying to the number of immortals, enough to make thy heart firm and reverent; keep secret and do not proclaim. If the virtuous and wise mind yearns beyond the mountain ridges, at thy departure from the world, seal this and show it. If thou dost not establish the practice, nor cultivate benevolence, thou shalt never be seen in the heavens. Within the encirclement of green peaks, among the thousand ridges, immortals are countless, shoulder to shoulder with men yet unknown. When mortals have cause and condition, some lost in mountain searching err, enter immortal households, are detained by immortal caves and jade maidens, requesting first great merit. At first learning the Way, need not enter mountains; close the door and diligently cultivate, do not mingle with men; long fasting and firm intention, or clear incense and sweeping, can also invoke the true. Ladies Wei and Xu’s followers all belong to this stream. The key is to long study the true books of square arts, transmit and influence roughly accordingly, then sever traces. If coming and going among men, temporarily leaving mountain valley, attending to garments, food, and drink, need not mingle with the world, there shall be difference. Outwardly blend brightness with dust, inwardly guard true unity; this is the subtlety of the teaching.
