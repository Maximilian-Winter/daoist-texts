The Nine Articles of the Great Truth Text serve to examine the highest truth in the conduct of immortals.

Minor merit reveals the light of the world, attended by the Three Realms without waste in sudden death;  
Middle merit is honoured by myriad spirits, summoned naturally by the Five Emperors, associating with true men;  
Great merit is the attainment of the Dao, ascending in broad daylight to Heaven, reaching the Heavenly Gate, roaming in the Supreme Clarity.  
Merit and fault grades correspond to the Great Truth Regulations.
