### Scroll One of the Scripture of the Supreme Truth Jade Emperor’s Four Extremities Bright Regulations

At that time, the Supreme Great Dao Lord bestowed upon the High Sage Supreme Truth Jade Emperor the Five-Colored Divine Officials the “Four Extremities Bright Regulations,” a hundred and twenty precepts. The upper inspected the celestial true beings; the middle inspected the flying immortals; the lower governed the transgressors. Such jade writings all issued from the High Sage, annotations of the Supreme Ruler, stored within the High Supreme Jade Void’s Seven Reflections Purple Chamber. The jade illustrious codes, gold-immortal scattered incense, five Emperors’ divine troops numbering five hundred million persons, flying spirit feathered riders, guarding with spiritual writings. For countless endless kalpas, masters of the Five Changes of Fate, the Nine-Five throne shifts; to be inspected by perfected beings assisting in the governance of the Holy Order, possessing golden bones and jade stores, mysterious diagrams and purple slips, named the Shangqing, following the regulations and oaths passed down.

The Supreme One instructed the Golden Gateway Emperor Lord, commissioning the Nine Spirits Jade Consorts to cast golden slips, compiled with silver, to have the Turtle Mother hold the brush; the Supreme Truth waved the curtains; the Purple Dawn scattered incense; Supreme Illumination held the towel; clear fasting in the purple chamber to make the jade volumes. He requested the cloud brocade pouch, sealed with cinnabar-blue seals. Then the Supreme Great Dao Lord, on high, drew forth the Twenty-Four Emperors of the High Supreme Jade Void and the Thirty-Nine Perfected Ones; ascended the Most High No-Reflection Qi Purple Jade Official, golden radiance jade palace, the Nine-Bend Chamber. The talisman of the Five Emperors’ divine troops, the Four Extremities officials numbering one billion persons, poisonous dragons and giant beasts, all guarding the Ten Heavens. At that time there were floating rosy clouds and feathered canopies, a thousand perfected beings in the mulberry grove, nine-colored festivals, winged assistants at the spiritual passes, divine phoenixes chanting mysteriously, purple phoenixes revolving, jade flutes stirring heavenly sounds, jade forest spiritual cries, golden blossoms scattering incense, jade consorts raising smoke, flying sky gatherings, eight ways to the Cave Clarity, three lights halting their radiance, night lamps shining clear, flowing gold emitting majesty, brilliant falling fire bells, five dawns in harmony, seven origins concealing spirits, millions of chariots and myriad steeds, luxuriant purple courts. The High Sage Jade Emperor commanded the Upper Palace Jade Maidens Xu Farong, Xiao Yizhong, Tian Sifei, Li Yunmen, and others to strike the cloud bell of the jade zither, in harmony to sing the great Cave Clarity High Purity Mysterious Sincerity chapter, the Three Paths of exposure to bitterness poem. The jade wise flute sounded, heavenly tunes stirring the subtle, divine jade vibrations resounding, golden tones flying airy, dharma transforming millions, overseeing myriad matters at the start. Their words were:

The great cave encompasses the three wheels; primordial transformation has no form. Silent as rootless teaching, austere as possessing spirit and might. Alas, in the Three Paths, sorrow arises; from this originates woe and bitterness. Highest learning is diligent in these precepts; accumulating goodness exhausts the kalpa lifespan. When kalpas end, transformation gives birth to heavenly bricks, bodies alongside sun and moon. The ignorant follow worldly desires, floating teachings to seek renown. Declaring transformation without order and discipline, lightly leaking heavenly treasures’ scriptures. Recklessly entering the gate of death, the Four Extremities bind your name. Soul and spirit tread the nine hardships, five sufferings long entangle you. Eating fire, treading knife mountains, hardships without respite. Lament this source of calamity and blessing; slowly within it is very clear.

The High One left stern precepts; calamity and blessing cause men’s lament. The path of immortality originally follows fate; in darkness too is judgment made. Without fate, none is opened; once enlightened, one knows constant suffering and peace. If one can honor the mysterious precepts, naturally transcend the sky and stars. If one is greedy with lust’s burdens, why be proud and playful? Dwelling in sins binding the Four Brights, life and death tread the eight hardships. Drifting in the Five Suffering Court, the Three Paths bind without dispersal. Sinking spirits seize the nine depths; countless kalpas without dawn. Sad is this primordial teaching; can it not cause man’s grievance?

Vast and lofty is the Nine Mysteries’ height, obscure and dark the beginning of transformation. No form, no shadow; no depth, no measure. The two instruments open fate’s manifestation, bind qi to form dregs. The three dawns illuminate the mysterious chamber; the five and nine have order and discipline. Calamity and blessing depend on life; good and evil, which ultimately prevails? If one can awaken to the mystery and be transcendent, clearing doubts and suspicions. If one stubbornly wields fate’s axe, accumulating resentment within the heart. Sinking in sin binding the Four Brights, old punishments are ample. Bearing life’s knife mountains, the Five Sufferings’ origin exhausted. Seven mysteries fill the dark night, ten thousand kalpas one cycle. Lingering in the Three Paths, not yet understanding life and death.

Then the High Sage Supreme Truth Jade Emperor, High Dawn Master leading the immortal jade attendants, held the rising immortal feathered banner, jade script imperial seal, proclaimed the Five Spirits; the jade officials supported their posts; myriad emperors approached the throne; the Bright Sovereign opened the oath, conferred the Bright Regulations upon the Supreme Great Dao Lord. The Dao Lord received the mysterious precepts, at that time entrusting the Later Sage Nine Mysteries Golden Gateway Emperor Lord, to govern the Shangqing above, the Ten Heavens in the middle, and the myriad spirits below; to oversee the host of immortals, universally proclaiming to myriad perfected beings; verifying the Azure Palace’s mysterious diagrams and purple slips, named after the Jade Emperor; granted to later students, all to know the precepts and to cultivate according to the regulations and oaths.

The Later Sage Emperor Lord received the Supreme Great Dao Lord's “Four Extremities Bright Regulations,” sealed within the Golden Gateway Purple Terrace Jade Reflection Seven Treasures Palace. For seventeen hundred years transmitted to the Prime Minister Azure Youth Lord, who transmitted them to the Supreme Ultimate Perfected, Southern Mountain Scarlet Lord, Western City King Lord, Mysterious Continent Immortal Elder, Nine Spirits Princes and twenty-four perfected beings. The King Lord sealed one copy in the Jade Chamber northwest of Wangwu Mountain, to be transmitted through countless kalpas to later students who attain the Way. If one has mysterious diagrams, jade names, golden bones, purple stores, one shall obtain this text; those who obtain it become immortals ascending to the daylight heavens. Attending the text are jade youths and jade maidens, thirty-six each, guarding and ministering to those with the code, recording merits and manifest good. Exercise caution in carrying out and abiding by the oath and treasure; do not lightly transmit. If one reveals the spiritual volume, the Nine Ancestors and Ancestresses will fill the primordial exhausting task, bearing mountain burdens and stones, filling the river of night, devouring fire and carbon, unrevocable for ten thousand kalpas; upon death, sinking into the dark spring to repent before the Three Officials.

The Supreme Clear, Subtle Celestial Mysterious Three Officials, Jade Emperor Overseers and Commanding Immortal Lords, govern the Five Emperors’ divine troops of fifty thousand. The first left official governs the offenses of slowness and negligence against the Supreme Truth Jade Emperor; the second right official governs offenses of leaking heavenly treasures; the third yin official governs offenses of the Primordial Lord violating precepts and prohibitions. The Yuyutian Three Officials, Supreme True Commanders of fault inspection, govern the Five Emperors’ divine troops of fifty thousand. The first left official supervises yang faults: punishments, executions, rebellion, theft of heavenly treasures, revelation of spiritual texts, verbal oaths, and curses. The second right official supervises yin faults: harboring conspiracies, unrighteous plots, harming the virtuous, wrongful thoughts. The third metropolitan official supervises doubts and division towards celestial true beings, lack of reverence and belief, slandering heavenly treasures, mixed intentions, disregard for Daoist scriptures, defiling true writings. The Great Red Heaven Three Officials collectively oversee spiritual messengers, commanding the Five Emperors’ troops of fifty thousand. The first left official governs living persons’ offenses; the second right official governs the dead; the third yin official governs women’s offenses. There are also two water and fire officials on the left and right. The left water official governs false speech, slander, disputes, jealousy, harm to the capable, disbelief in true beings, suspicion of talismans, defaming treasure writings, falsehoods about Heaven and Earth, disclosing secret volumes, slandering the two symbols, offending the three stars. The right fire official governs major transgressions: killing, harming masters, plotting against parents, evil hands and hearts, unrighteous wishes. The Great Hill Mountain has two more officials, Wind and Knife, left and right. The left wind examiner governs the neglect of scriptures, talismans, and precepts without oaths or cultivation, the love of wealth and disdain for the Way, harming heavenly precepts. The second right knife examiner governs broken oaths and covenants, betrayal of masters and friends, abandoning one for another, judging good and evil, attacking the root, and incurable offenses.

Within the mystery are three great voids governed by the Three Officials. The upper three officials manage the Supreme Mysterious Upper Jade Void Great Void; the middle three officials govern the Shangqing Great Void; the lower three officials govern the Supreme Ultimate Great Void. All dwell within the mysterious void, above the emptiness, each distinct with nine offices, located within the five sacred mountains’ mysterious void chambers. Good and evil, crime and punishment, all come through the jurisdiction of the Three Officials and Nine Offices.

The Knife Mountain lies north of Mount Dai, above the small heaven of the cavity. It encircles seven thousand li, placing one hundred and twenty bureaus and one thousand two hundred subordinate officers, commanding fifty thousand divine troops to execute punishment. Those with crimes against the Three Officials, their death souls are sent to ascend the mountain for a sweep, one kalpa per sweep, exhausting souls in bitter pain; after three sweeps of the scripture, they may proceed to the fiery land. The fiery land is south of Mount Huo, within the Great Yang Dongting, encircling five thousand li. The guilty souls are handed to the fiery land, eating fire and carbon, emaciated souls in bitter pain; one kalpa per sweep, three sweeps to fulfill the Three Paths’ labor, carrying soil from Meng Mountain, filling the river of night; after three sweeps they may return to the path of non-human rebirth.

The Three Paths are all attached to the Supreme Mysterious Female Azure Upper Palace Fengdu Mountain in the northern Gui region. The mountain has eight prisons: first the Heavenly Prison, second the Balanced Heaven Prison, third the Voidness Prison, fourth the Natural Prison, fifth the Nine Balanced Prison, sixth the Clear Edict Prison, seventh the Mysterious Heaven Prison, eighth the Primordial Correct Prison; these eight prisons are governed by the Upper Heaven Three Officials. The mountain’s center has eight prisons: first Mysterious Sand Northern Prison, second Imperial Heaven Prison, third Forbidden Punishment Prison, fourth Mysterious Profound Prison, fifth Punishment Correct Prison, sixth Regulation Prison, seventh Nine Heavens Prison, eighth Clear Bell Prison; these eight are governed by the Middle Heaven Three Officials. The mountain base has eight prisons: first Infinite Prison, second Supreme Truth Prison, third Mysterious Capital Prison, fourth Thirty-Six Heavens Grand Prison, fifth Heavenly One Northern Prison, sixth River Lord Prison, seventh Accumulated Kalpa Prison, eighth Female Azure Prison; these eight are governed by the Lower Three Officials. All twenty-four prisons lie north of Dengdu Mountain, staffed by twelve subordinate officers, two thousand four hundred golden-headed, iron-faced giant heavenly strongmen, holding golden hammers and iron staves. All souls guilty under the mysterious precepts are handed to their respective prisons; the bodies are examined by the strongmen’s iron staves; one kalpa per sweep; three sweeps to return and fulfill the Three Paths’ labor.

The Supreme One instructed the Golden Gateway Emperor Lord: All persons born within Heaven and Earth, within the six directions, yet ignorant of life, death, predestination, the root of sin and blessing, how lamentable indeed! Good and evil causes, all have retribution. In life perform merits and spread virtue to save all; after death transform to the blessed hall, surpassing the eight hardships, receiving mankind’s congratulations; heavenly retribution naturally follows. In life love learning, aspire to the immortals, revere the mysterious precepts, revere spiritual writings, reflect on good and change evil, establish conduct entering the true; after death transform and be received by the Emperors, name inscribed on purple slips; ascend the Jade Dawn; in life delight in the Way, not fearing hardship or cold; follow the masters in duties, labor foremost; in hunger and thirst endeavor diligently, no grudges arise; after death transform, receive the flying chariot, roam the Five Sacred Mountains, ride the void descending smoke.

In life be upright and chaste, not licentious or deceitful, not greedy or desirous, seeing colors without joy, heart like dead ashes, firmly holding the root of the Way; after death transform, receive spiritual beings, transcend the Three Paths, not suffer the Five Sufferings. In life do good, wishing Heaven to universally bestow; all ascend together, departing the eight hardships. Many bodies pass not, self unquiet; cut off your own garment to rescue the poor and cold; diminish food and wages for black crows; leave belongings in the empty mountains. The Four Officials extol goodness, touching the Jade Emperor, writing names on purple slips, inserting and supplementing among the superior immortals. In life be loyal and filial, respectfully serve and revere elders, honor and respect above oneself; honor rites of masters and lords; harmony between heart and eyes as if one body; no rash words from mouth, harmonizing inner and outer, movement and rest conforming to truth. After death transform, receive spiritual beings, not suffer the Three Paths, surpass the eight hardships; good linked to good, blessing following blessing; such retribution, how can the Way fail man?

In life be evil and wicked, harbor malice and deceit, attack masters, slander sacred writings, not revere spiritual chapters, doubt the celestial true beings, outwardly fickle, falsely seeking glory, mouth saying yes but heart no, conduct betraying the Way’s root, stealing scriptures, transmitting without oath, leaking secret instructions, exiled not true, violating precepts and taboos, body entering the gate of sin; seven ancestors severely punished, responsibility reaching the exhausted souls; body dies burdened by the sweep, eating fire treading mountains, Three Paths, Five Sufferings, ten thousand kalpas unrelenting, tortured in dark night; grievous to the body. Those who would cultivate learning should carefully study this text; retribution for good and evil how can it be fully told?

Those with golden names on the imperial diagram, jade characters on purple slips, receiving and upholding the “Four Extremities Bright Regulations” hundred and twenty precept inspections, all are longstanding responsive immortals. But they must follow the precepts for worship, exalt goodness and obey the law, aspiring to divine efficacy, the Supreme Void Jade Emperor’s special reward; the four realms officials escort and receive them entering and exiting; near and far all bow the head, serving the destined body. The destined must sever their conduct from yin and yang, not mingle with common people, not tread the filth of life and death, offend the true spirit, consume the Five Smokes, qi filling the stomach, damaging essence losing spirit, exposing the Three Lights, slighting the Jade Dawn, thereby bringing their own guilt, calamity destroying the destined body. Thus is the warning: beware and carefully carry out. Those who attain the body of the Bright Regulations must not rashly discuss scriptures with common learning, nor comment on mysteries of old; with intention communicating ultimate truth, publicizing in wrong places, revealing the root of the Way, rashly showing men, harming the Seven Ancestors’ dead souls, augmenting the river source, body bound in Nine Underworlds, suffering pains untold.

Upholding the supreme law and cultivating Bright Regulations, all must on the eight solar terms and one’s natal day, fast and burn incense, repent before the Emperor Lord, extract sins of the Nine Yins, dissolve the Seven Mysteries. Always on the day of Beginning of Spring and Spring Equinox, burn nine lights in the central courtyard; Beginning of Summer and Summer Solstice burn three lights; Beginning of Autumn and Autumn Equinox burn seven lights; Beginning of Winter and Winter Solstice burn five lights; on the natal day burn twelve lights. At midnight expose the lights below, on Beginning of Spring and Spring Equinox face east; on Beginning of Summer and Summer Solstice face south; on Beginning of Autumn and Autumn Equinox face west; on Beginning of Winter and Winter Solstice face north; on the natal day face the Grand Duke; knock teeth twenty-four times, softly chant:

‘Supreme True Supreme, Myriad Sage Emperors, Five Emperors Jade Officials, General Immortal Overseers; today a fortunate day, eight solar terms; open to declare yang sins and yin trials; utterly extinguish the Nine Yins; forever extract and release the Seven Mysteries; escape fire land; forever depart Knife Mountain; Three Paths and Five Sufferings not encumber my body; obtain union with Heaven and Earth; long preserve the Emperor’s dawn; five wishes, eight assemblies, none not fulfilled.’

Finished, remove the towel, kowtow a hundred and twenty times, forehead touching the ground only, not causing pain. Then replace the towel, look up to Heaven, heart meditating: ‘My body today enjoys Heaven’s grace, bestowed life and form, receiving birth as a flying immortal.’ Finished, look up and swallow the twenty-four qi stops. Thus for three years, past faults and debts are all removed; body and true spirit become one; do not tread the Five Sufferings; escape the fire land; may obtain the perfected being’s roaming banquet in the destined chamber. This is called a wondrous formula; do not lightly transmit.

The Four Extremities have the Four Directions Five Emperors Jade Officials to regulate; universally governing the Four Extremities, no high or low, no deep or shallow; revolving endless kalpas; all inspect good and evil, calamity and blessing all depend on the Jade Officials’ Lords. In the four directions and eight regions there are innumerable officials, all titled Jade Officials and Wandering Officials.
