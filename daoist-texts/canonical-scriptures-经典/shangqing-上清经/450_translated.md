The Supreme Record of Cang Yuan of the Cavern of Reality

The Record of Cang Yuan, also named the Inner Writings of Supreme Clarity, also called the Precious Chapters of the Jade Mirror, also the Golden Diagrams and Beautiful Characters, also the Talismans of Dispelling Drowning, also the Precious Registers of Mysterious Observation, also the Scripture of Renwu Mountain, also the Golden Documents of Life’s Birth, also the Mighty Empowerment of Supreme Unity. These were cultivated by the Lord of Jade Morning, the Secret and Simple Spirit of the Upper Palace. Having obtained and reverently practised them, one can fly and sink, can conceal and manifest, and holds the rank of a Perfected Person.

The primal energy flows and transforms, condensing above into Heaven, spreading a hue of emerald and blue, hence called Cang Yuan. The bright and clear workings govern, hating killing and loving life, warning of disaster and blessing; the student should regard this as a mirror. In divining the good and evil, one perceives auspiciousness and avoids calamity; entering and exiting are well timed; rest and motion preserve completeness; transformation guides and功功 stands; accumulating virtue the Way is accomplished. Without knowledge of this secret, one vainly seeks green shoots. To practise other minor benefits one escapes not great disasters; although rising above the Twenty-Eight Heavens, one yet falls into the midst of worms and grass. Therefore this utmost true treasure secret is especially profound; when the child meets the opportunity, he shuts his mouth and cultivates it. All beings contain qi, receiving Cang Yuan at birth. Without insight and awakening, one increases good affinities; indulging the self at will, losing primal qi; the death of sentient beings is caused by wanton evil accumulating and wasting the body; brief joy is not long; the baby suffers long nights beyond measure. The supreme sages in pity unfold the wondrous qi, marking and writing the natural spiritual characters, inscribing and engraving the essentials of cultivation of goodness; wearing and reciting it, preserving it and practising it according to formulae; unceasingly in thought, not exceeding nine years, one must ascend to the Three Pure Ones.

Boundless and obscure without limit, it cannot be fully expressed; it is generally called Nature, and represented by the name Primal Qi. Primal Qi responds well, transforming into form; the images have names; broadly speaking, these are called Heaven and Earth. Heaven and Earth cover and sustain, embrace and nourish, Cang is born; life qi is abundant, the first of all colours. Looking up at the form of Heaven, carefully distinguishing its colours, preserving the spirit of essence, then obtaining its qi; qi descends through the whole body, inside and outside thoroughly penetrating; long life and no death, endless transformation. As for men, some are sharp, dull, or even; Heaven has great, middle, small; small within great. The various Heavens are arranged; primal numbers are piled in layers; the various lands are countless without end. Each Heaven has three lights, seven truths without limit; each land has five sacred mountains, eight assemblies, Kunlun, and Sumeru; great and small differ, according to man’s perception of having or not; each according to dwelling place, advantages and harms, depending on karma receiving fruit. Some dwell in turbidity yet are clear; some are clear yet turbid; some are wise yet lowly in rank; some are foolish yet noble in title; some have vast domains but are barren; some have small domains yet are fruitful; some dwell in honour yet sorrowful; some dwell in low estate yet joyful and healthy; some are male yet weak; some are female yet strong; some outwardly bright yet inwardly dark; some inwardly shining yet outwardly obscure. Some are low first then high; some are void first then real; some head straight then tail crooked; some front crooked then end straight; some solitary; some in groups; some alike; some different; the myriad kinds are uneven, innumerable. Countless Heavens in common possess such sorts; only the great Luo Three Heavens are pure and unique, one qi complete, lacking nothing. There is response to perception; responses number millions and thousands; some are coarse, some subtle; some shallow, some deep; though differing in weight, all are pure; divided and transformed into diverse forms, the source is one. According to their feeling and affinity, depending on conditions, manifesting traces: there are those who see qi and climate and awaken, the first kind of person; those who see light and sound and awaken, the second; those who see talismans and charts and awaken, the third; those who see characters and awaken, the fourth; those who see forms and appearances and awaken, the fifth; those who see words and speech and awaken, the sixth; those who see shadows and images and awaken, the seventh; those who see splendour and magnificence and awaken, the eighth; those who see simplicity and humility and awaken, the ninth; those who see apparent communication and awaken, the tenth; those who see concealment and obstruction and awaken, the eleventh; those who see the middle and awaken, the twelfth. The great twelve classes, divided into three grades, upper, middle, and lower, each with four subgrades. Practice and karma differ, cause and effect vary. Among the twelve on earth, ascend to the infinite Three Pure Heavens, above all heavens. The higher study roams among the twelve, refines and feasts in the Three Pure Ones; feasting in the Three Pure Ones, no more to act. What is wrought becomes a thing, not what I need. Before ascending the Three Pure Ones, one may act as a thing, a thing for oneself, mixed in conduct. Sometimes self predominates a little, things predominate much; sometimes things are shallow, self is deep. Exploring shallow differences resulted in twelve; neither shallow nor deep, then ascending the three heights. The upper three are originally one, responding and receiving three stages; initially coming not yet arrived, three names not yet united, afterwards united, no more three names. The lower know existence, forcibly called one; one is also not a name, but the master of all names. The master cannot be without a name, thus named one; one unites myriads of auspicious names, Luo gives birth to Mysterious Origin and beginning, etc. The Most High Revered Spirits are all those whom the student must preserve and call master; yet not true names, the name is not removed.

Companions of higher study, thoroughly understand cause and effect, their essence without doubt; cultivating it must be concentrated, concentration must be efficacious; the will must be fulfilled; success comes from following the law; law has three vehicles, riding twelve matters, matters in the scripture; upper, middle, lower grades; Three Caverns correspond and operate, mutually issuing. Sometimes simultaneously manifest, encompassing all writings; all writings and charts belong to the Three Caverns. The Three Caverns, Three Pure Ones, are the Three Vehicles; Three Vehicles have scriptures and precepts, each twelve; combined thirty-six sections for the salvation of innumerable heavenly and human beings. Man’s affinities are thick or thin, gains differ; more or less, shallow or deep; unless of ultimate virtue, names are in the jade chart, azure record, white slips; not all is heard, nor seen, nor understood, nor practised. Each follows what is obtained, gradually advancing in stages; only the complete ascend the Three Pure Ones. The Three Pure Ones are Jade Pure, Upper Pure, and Great Pure. The Three Caverns are Cavern of Reality, Cavern of Mystery, and Cavern of Spirit. The Three Scriptures are Cavern of Reality of Upper Pure, Cavern of Mystery of Spiritual Treasure, Cavern of Spirit of Three Sovereigns.
