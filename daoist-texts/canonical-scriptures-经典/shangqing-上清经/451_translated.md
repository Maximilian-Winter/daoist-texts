The Register of the People of the Perfected True Jade Talisman of the Supreme Most High Perfected One of the Cavern of Truth

The Lord Qing Tong inquired of the Supreme Dao Lord, saying: 'To govern the heart-mind and enter the Way, with methods and techniques they all say there is subtlety, to be taken according to affinity. But I have not yet examined what is the most essential command, what method is supreme?'

The Supreme One answered: 'Though there be many principles that excel, there is one that is the greatest. The key to governing the heart-mind lies in shame and remorse. When the heart is stirred, when the eyes are raised, when the body is turned and rested, always cherish shame and remorse, never forget even for a moment; then the heart and spirit become settled, and when settled one enters the Way. This is the most essential.'

The Lord Qing Tong said: 'Wherein lies the shame and remorse, so as to enter the Way?'

The Supreme One said: 'The heart has spirit and consciousness; consciousness may know the Way and reverence it. Reverence arises from non-action, but I have action; from action arises entanglement. The will aspires to non-action, which has no entanglement. This cannot be immediately attained, and progress is toilsome and slow. When burdened and entangled, for this be ashamed and remorseful, never departing from the heart. Moreover, one should think: I am born, life is given by father and mother; they nurtured me with toil and hardships. I have grown, but my learning is shallow, my methods and marvels are none to lengthen their lives or grant immortality, that we might all become spirits and immortals. This goal has not been attained; my offerings are also lacking; public and private faults and mistakes cause my parents concern. My thoughts are not pure; my merit and conduct grow slack and decline. For this be ashamed and remorseful, never departing from the heart. Again, my parents cherish me, urging me to be wise and bright; to study under masters and learn; to have wisdom that penetrates spirit; to seek to become immortal sages and people of the Way. Masters and friends encourage and exhort me, using expedients to restrain and raise, to lead well and receive well. When refined and molded, yet my desires run wild, I bear the transgression of my masters’ teachings; sometimes I am about to succeed but desist; I rebel against the proper and enter the wrong; I attack and assail masters and friends; I turn against the Way and break the scriptures; my sins reach the revered above, and disasters befall myself. Perils approach, yet I know not to amend. Or without awareness, I take falsehood for truth, suffering bitterly and repenting too late, with no way to retrace. For this be ashamed and remorseful, never departing from the heart. Again, the sovereign rewards virtue, seeks the worthy and the beautiful, raises them from their clans and selects the elite, confers rank and stipend with great splendour, feasts and gathers them in close union. Yet I cannot exhaust all means to be loyal, to proclaim and spread the sacred transformation. Covetous of honour and fond of power, I flatter and follow with a false face; I advance with deceit and flattery; I suppress and refuse the wise and bright; I envy and harm those who surpass me; I form factions and link enemies. Calamities and evils, plunder and harm reach me without my knowledge. Knowing I cannot avoid it, I cause harm even to kinsfolk and friends. For this be ashamed and remorseful, never departing from the heart. Again, to honour the Way and not forget it; to serve my parents with filial piety; to serve my sovereign with loyalty; to wrong neither the hidden nor the manifest; yet former hindrances and faults entangle me; adversity and illness cling; public and private quarrels and slanders arise; sometimes lawsuits and prisons come upon me, unintentionally; or I keep diligent watch, pure and upright, differing from the multitude; the sovereign hates me, the wicked resent me. Or I serve masters and respect friends, moving with body and mind, yet suffer dire misfortunes; evil ghosts and evil men join to torment and rob me; I fear their plots and injuries. Or good deeds bring evil results; spending wealth causes enmity; performing rites invites guile; exhausting sincerity produces treachery. Or I build halls and lodgings, copy scriptures and charts; though halls stand, I cannot find lasting peace; though volumes are many, I cannot open them. Public and private hindrances, wind and fire remove and lose me; grievous sickness, hunger and cold; not following my original will; days pass empty; pure wishes unfulfilled. One loss leads to the Way being lost; the direction is dark; the secret suffering and vexation are unmeasured; the time of return is not known; now desiring to save it, I have no essential method. For this be ashamed and remorseful, never departing from the heart. The heart has spirit; if it know not shame and remorse, then it rushes and hastens, never finding rest. Rest comes from shame and remorse; when shame and remorse are established and always in the heart, the heart has shame and remorse; looking up and bowing down, reflecting on the Way, never forgetting to the end; then the spirit and brightness settle within. When within is settled, sins depart; when sins depart, blessings come; when blessings come, true reality is formed; when true reality is formed, one enters the Way. To enter the Way is by shame and remorse; shame and remorse is to enter the spirit.'

The Lord Qing Tong said: 'Shame and remorse in the heart — I carefully hear and obey. Pray tell, when shame and remorse are near, how may their form be known?'

The Supreme One said: 'Good, good! This is a question of great importance. Where there is form, there is heart; where there is heart, there is matter; where there is matter, there are traces; where there are traces, there is form; where there is form, there is speech; where there is speech, there is method; where there is method, there is the Way and its law, which may be explained. A scholar who governs the heart and has shame and remorse within shows traces of shame and remorse outwardly. Such a one is cautious, as if crossing a river in winter; hesitant, as if fearing the neighbours round about — such is the form. He is careful in his words, fearing to incite trouble; he restrains eating and drinking, considering against greed and gluttony; he wears coarse but clean clothes, dwelling in simplicity and purity; he lives in humble seclusion, guarding quietude and sincerity; reverent and respectful to all, avoiding insult and degradation; dares not take precedence, avoiding envy and slander; from beginning to end is chaste and faithful, secretly transforming and guiding; advances and retreats are gentle and bright, secretly practising teaching; restrains sharpness and resolves disputes, understanding the times of the Way; comes and goes with changes, showing responses of spirit and affinity. Each has its method, all are the forms of shame and remorse.'

The Lord Qing Tong said: 'Such are the forms, I carefully hear and obey. May the methods and rules be also made known?'

The Supreme One said: 'The methods are many and various; each has its scriptures and instructions. I will briefly state them, that hearing one you may know ten.

If one desires to settle the heart, one must reverently serve the Three Honours. The Honour of the Way and the Honour of the Scripture are both fully present in my Master. The Master's laws embrace the manifest and the hidden; humble submission and obedience are required; one must not disobey, lest one lose steadiness. To guard steadiness without loss, one must attend the Master Honour, observe the tone and demeanor, bend and exert without rest, endure toil without reluctance, accept hardship without refusal, concentrate the mind without opposition, and set death as the term. Those who can do thus have settled hearts and are born anew. If one turns from the Master and follows self-will, disobeys the Way and transgresses the Scriptures, becomes resentful, suspicious, deceitful in hidden and manifest matters, the heart is unsettled, afraid of death and losing life; once gone, it is hard to retrieve — truly a cause for grief.

If one desires to settle the heart, one must, according to circumstances, select a Master, keep to the Way and hold fast to the Scriptures, and cherish the Master without change. If the heart bears shame and remorse but cannot serve the Master—if the Master has ascended to Heaven and I cannot attend him; or wanders to other realms and I cannot follow; or depends on destiny and entrusts the end, which I cannot measure; or am cast adrift, suffering disgrace, hunger, cold, or endure public and private afflictions, imprisonment and confinement; or lie ill on pillow in mountains and waters, separated from human relations; or suffer the Five Calamities, death, decay and ruin; or am harmed by venomous insects and fierce beasts, or hurt by forest and trees; or meet thieves and robbers, fall into conspiracies and plots, unable to save myself — all these call for shame and remorse. Shame and remorse in the heart, anxiety and torment near, daring not seek pleasure, nor rest, nor song and laughter, nor splendour and wealth. One must cleanse the solemn hall and chamber, forbid mixed persons, burn incense and light lamps, perform morning and evening rites, recite and chant the Master's Scriptures, meditate on and act according to the Master's laws, be solemn and trembling, fearful and cautious; eat humble food and breathe calmly; wear tattered cloth garments; in movement and stillness bow the head and step carefully; repent and preserve the spirit; do good and pray for blessings; build virtue and establish merit; open the salvation of all; teach and transform the ignorant; be diligent and tireless; careful and unceasing. If not the Master's words, the mouth dares not speak; if not the Master's clothing, the body dares not wear; if not the Master's will, the heart dares not keep it; if not the Master's dwelling, one dares not stay. Those who can do thus obtain the method of shame and remorse.

If one desires to settle the heart, one should receive the "Supreme Register of the People of the Perfected True Jade Talisman." This talisman is of utmost importance, the prerequisite for learning; first the heart must be settled, then the immortal name is fixed. The fixing of the immortal name comes from this talisman. It was worn by the Three Heavenly Perfected Ones of the Orthodox One, to fix and obtain the name of the immortal, passed on to the Jade Emperor, the Thirty-Nine Perfected Ones, the Queen Mother of the West, the Lady of the Supreme Origin, the Pure and Spiritual Perfected One, and the Five Sacred Mountain Perfected Immortals, each receiving one copy. Those who have received it for a thousand years may pass it on to three persons. If there be a golden name and jade characters attached with a blue court seal, within a hundred years three transmissions may be obtained. The pledge employs one golden man and one jade dragon seal, with thirty-two chi of blue cloth, to swear to the Northern Emperor. The Master and disciples each fast for nine days, facing north to make the pledge and transmit the talisman. If one does not receive this talisman, the immortal name is not fixed; although studying the scriptures,功德 is not accomplished; one is tested by demons and cannot obtain immortality. All who obtain immortality have first received this talisman. It is carried in a blue-patterned pouch worn under the arm; males on the left, females on the right; always kept on the person, removed only when bathing, but otherwise never loosened. When torn or worn out, report and replace it. Those who lose it must undergo punishment, fasting and repentance for three years and thirty months. When the term is complete, they may report and wear it again. If lost three times previously, it may not be received again; this increases shame and remorse, hoping for affinity in later lives only.

The "Register of the Perfected True Jade Talisman" is the writing of Nature, arising from the Unbeginning and ending with the Unending. In the Great Calamity it will be changed once; those who attain the Way and are true, accumulating功 and virtue, must wear this writing. Their names enter therein, their bodies receive its qi; this is the true true, which cannot be destroyed. Before the Great Calamity is complete, during the lesser calamities in between, those whose功 and virtue slacken will have both body and name withdrawn; they will lose this writing and will not be worthy of immortality. Those whose功 advance and virtue are refined, obtaining the writing without loss, are preserved as seed people, neither retreating nor diminishing. Depending on功 and virtue and wisdom, degrees differ. Beyond 240,000 there are another 120,000, making 360,000 in all, which is the number completed in one calamity. Those with slight功 and virtue fall short of the 360,000 and await the next calamity. The people of this calamity, diligent and courageous, may enter this limit of 360,000. It is also called the "White Bamboo Slip and Blue Register of the Register of the Imperial People," the white gold being the slip, the blue jade the characters.
