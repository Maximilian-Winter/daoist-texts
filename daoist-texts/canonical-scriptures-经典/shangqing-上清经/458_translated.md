# Exhortation on Precepts and Discipline

Those who pursue the Way, none fail to hold fast to precepts with earnest devotion, thereby accumulating merit and conduct. Hence the Left Immortal said: 'To study the Way without practising fasting and precepts is but to labour in vain in the mountains and forests.' Now the precepts are the forbidding of evil deeds. Therefore, if one does not hold to precepts, the Way cannot be attained.

The scriptures of the Three Caverns speak much of precepts; to enumerate briefly the chief outlines, there are: the Three Refuges Precepts, the Five Precepts of the Seal-born, the Eight Precepts; for men and women in the world the Ten Supreme Precepts; for those newly entering the Way the Initial True Ten Precepts; for the disciples of the Zhengyi School the Seventy-two Precepts; the Lord Lao's One Hundred and Eighty Precepts; the Heavenly True Ten Precepts; the Fourteen Precepts of Self-Perfection; the Five Thousand Character Golden Button Precepts of the Supreme Clarity of Yin and Yang; the Twenty-seven Precepts of the Most High and Profound Dharma Master; the Five Precepts, Thirteen Precepts, and Seven Hundred and Twenty Precepts of the Cavern Spirits in the Three Ways; the One Hundred and Twenty-nine Precepts of the Ascending Profound Inner Teaching; the Precepts against the Six Passions of the Primordial Alliance of the Numinous Treasure; the Great Precepts of the Highest Wisdom of the Middle Alliance; the One Hundred and Eighty Precepts of the Three Origins of the Great Alliance; the Three Hundred Great Precepts of the Highest Wisdom of the Supreme Clarity Contemplation of the Body; and the One Thousand Two Hundred Precepts... All these are the secret transmissions of ancient Taoism.

Since the beginning of the Qing, Wang Changyue again opened the altar and expounded precepts; pruning the redundant and simplifying the complex, he transmitted to the Initial True, the Middle Ultimate, and the Great Precepts of the Heavenly Immortals, thus establishing the model of the precept platform, clear and concise, complete and comprehensive. Therefore, for more than three hundred years, it has been the constant standard of Taoist practitioners in cultivating the Way and maintaining the person, the path for accumulating merit and conduct. To increase goodness and restrain evil, to return to truth and abandon falsehood, all proceed gradually through these until sudden enlightenment is gained.

Precepts and discipline form a part of the ritual and pattern of Taoism; selecting the essentials and compiling them, this shows but one aspect of the strict self-regulation of Taoist practitioners.
