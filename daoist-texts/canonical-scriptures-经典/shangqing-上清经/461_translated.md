# The Precepts of the Original Truth

Whosoever first enters the Way of the Supreme Orthodox Tradition, whether they inquire concerning the Dao or the mundane, must first observe and comply with the Supreme Golden and Jade Laws, and the Precepts of the Three Caverns; must offer reverence to the Venerable Image of the Great Way, and make obeisance to the Heavenly Lord who surveys the Capital of the All-Heavens. They shall petition for a covenant of proof, and receive the Threefold Refuge Precepts.

The Threefold Refuge Precepts are these:

First, to take refuge in the Supreme Limitless Great Dao, thereby forever escaping the cycle of rebirth; hence it is called the Treasure of the Dao.

Second, to take refuge in the Thirty-Six Divisions of Venerable Scriptures, so as to hear the authentic Law; hence it is called the Treasure of the Scriptures.

Third, to take refuge in the Profound Great Master of the Mystery, who does not fall into erroneous views; hence it is called the Treasure of the Master.

The Heavenly Venerable said: The Threefold Refuge Precepts are the pivot of Heaven and Earth, the root of the spirits and immortals, the initial gate of practice, the primal sign of establishing the heart; they govern the vital breath and contain the spirit, the hidden truth enters the principle, embracing all forms, though my shape is without exterior. Those who hold them, the gods and spirits of Heaven and Earth rejoice; their minds, intellects, ears, and eyes expand; all things revere them; the six bowels are harmonious and joyful; myriad spirits protect them. As parents of all living beings, they endure through the ages without fail; the human form is at peace in mutual harmony. Competing for these Threefold Refuges, one thereby receives the Five Precepts commanded by the Supreme Lord Lao, to “accumulate merit and return to the root.”
