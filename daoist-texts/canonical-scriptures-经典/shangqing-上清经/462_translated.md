# The Five Precepts of Accumulating Merit and Returning to the Root

The Five Precepts of the Primordial Truth are as follows:  
1. Not to kill living beings;  
2. Not to take pungent meats or wine;  
3. Not to say one thing with the mouth and another in the heart;  
4. Not to steal;  
5. Not to commit licentiousness.

First: Not to kill living beings.  
According to the Scripture of Laozi’s Precepts: All living creatures, those that contain breath and those that fly or creep, must not be slain. Every creature that creeps delights in life; even the mosquito, the ant, the dragonfly, and the centipede know to avoid death.

Second: Not to take pungent meats or wine.  
According to the Scripture of Laozi’s Precepts: The prohibition against wine is not because of bodily illness or ritual propriety; in such cases, one may drink. Bodily illness refers to a sickness requiring the use of wine. Ritual propriety refers clearly not to secular banquets nor offerings to ghosts and spirits; with regard to ceremonies of rank and the offerings to true spirits, one does not err in these.

Third: Not to say one thing with the mouth and another in the heart.  
According to the Scripture of Laozi’s Precepts: The prohibition against false speech is that if one speaks of what one has not heard or seen, and what is not apprehended by the heart, all this is false speech, for what is spoken contradicts the heart’s truth. There is also the prohibition against ornate words, flattery, repetition, and double-tongued speech.

Fourth: Not to steal.  
According to the Scripture of Laozi’s Precepts: For anything above a single coin, whether it has an owner or not, if it is not one’s own, one must not take it falsely. On the earth there is the Earth Officer; in the water, the Water Officer; among men, their rulers; thus there is no thing without an owner. That which has no owner means that at the time there is no one appointed to guard it.

Fifth: Not to commit licentiousness.  
According to the Scripture of Laozi’s Precepts: The prohibition against licentiousness is that those not husband and wife, such as ordained persons who neither wed nor take wives, whether male or female, must not violate this rule. Even husband and wife, though not committing a breach of this precept, if excessive, are guilty of licentiousness.

These five precepts are the foundation of holding the person, the root of holding the law. Whosoever can hold to these five precepts diligently and without fault will lengthen his years, be protected by the celestial spirits, forever escape the sufferings of the five punishments, and in every generation not lose the human form. Having received the command of the Supreme Elder Lao, to accumulate merit and return to the root by these five precepts, each morning one burns incense and recites the Scripture of the Supreme Three Origins, Three Grades, Three Officers, Great Emperors Protecting the Nation, Aiding the People, Prolonging Life and Preserving the Destiny; and then one takes up the recitation of the Taishang and the Treatise on Response and Retribution. Daily one recites and expounds, examining oneself whether body or mind has transgressed.

For every sentence of the scripture recited, one reflects thus: Can I endure it? Can I practise it? Thus courageously advancing with diligence, being careful in word and deed, not violating the Three Refuges, without fault in the Five Precepts, after a hundred days of training, all evil thoughts are entirely dispelled, the bodily vessels and blood purified; then one may receive the command of the Heavenly Sovereign of the Void, to accept the Ten Precepts of the Primordial Truth.
