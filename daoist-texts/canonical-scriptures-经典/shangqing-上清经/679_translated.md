# Notes on the Stele of One Hundred Characters

Preface to the Notes on the Stele of One Hundred Characters

The Pure Yang Lüzu is indeed the most compassionate and sacred sage among the Daoist masters. From the Tang dynasty to the present, for more than a thousand years, he has sometimes concealed himself, sometimes made manifest, his concealment and manifestation beyond calculation. He awakens the ignorant and transforms them into the wise; his poems, songs, and odes have been transmitted throughout the world, countless beyond reckoning. Of his works that specially treat the order of cultivating the true nature, the medicines and the fire-timing, none is more complete than the "Knocking Yao Song" and the "Stele of One Hundred Characters." Yet of these, that which is brief in words and clear in principle, and most readily opens the minds of men to enlightenment, is none other than the "Stele of One Hundred Characters." The characters are but one hundred, the sentences but twenty; it treats both the active and the passive methods of the elixir, expounds thoroughly upon life and nature from beginning to end, calling it the Ladder to Heaven, the true Ladder to Heaven. 

Yet, though it be a Ladder to Heaven, many who cultivate the true Dao do not take it as such; they seek marvels and anomalies, and because this writing is without marvel or anomaly, they cast it away. They do not know that the Way of the Golden Elixir, the Way of the True Constant, holds the greatest marvels within the un-marvelous, the greatest differences within the un-different; but this is because the men of the time have not pondered deeply. This writing at the start only speaks of nourishing the qi, lowering the heart, and abiding in the nature—what marvel or anomaly is there in this? Yet in the practice and effect of it, one may form the elixir, take the elixir, roam freely, and pass through creation and transformation—are these not the greatest marvels and anomalies? Ah! Marvelous without marvel, different without difference—learners who can deeply investigate the master’s words, proceed step by step, have never failed to advance profoundly and achieve illumination. I, reading this text, have often been benefited thereby; for this reason, lamenting that this Ladder to Heaven is not known by men, that it grievously disappoints the master’s compassionate intention to save the world, I here append under each sentence a few words of commentary to elucidate its subtlety, hoping to find kindred spirits who may ascend the Ladder to Heaven together, thus to repay the master’s grace.

At the time, on the third day of the third month in the third year of Jiaqing, the year of Wu-Wu, a humble man of simplicity wrote this preface at the Nest of Freedom.
