# On Wealth and Profit

The Most Sage has said: The gentleman understands righteousness; the small man understands profit. The Old Ancestor has said: Do not value goods difficult to obtain. And again he said: Do not behold what is desirable, so that the heart may not be disturbed. Lü Zu said: Piling gold and accumulating jade to fill the mountains and rivers—immortals would coldly laugh and would not gather it. All these teachings instruct men not to covet wealth and profit, for they may ruin great affairs.

Yet wealth is of three kinds: worldly wealth, lawful wealth, and methodical wealth. Worldly wealth is gold, silver, pearls, and jade. Lawful wealth is merit, virtue, and sincerity. Those who seek worldly wealth prize gold and silver above merit and virtue; with a thousand schemes and a hundred devices, they take openly or steal secretly; harming others to benefit themselves, lightly spending and heavily receiving. They lament not that the wealth of the world should all be theirs alone, and that the profit of the world should be exclusively theirs. No wealth is left unpursued, no profit unsearched; they risk life and limb without care, deceive their own hearts and ignore themselves. Having ten strings of cash, they desire a hundred; having a hundred, they long for a thousand; having a thousand, they covet ten thousand. Their greed is insatiable, and to death they will not turn back.

They do not know that when the great limit arrives, though they be as rich as Shi Chong, and wealth be as many as ten thousand mountains, they cannot buy off the Old Lord of the Netherworld; they cannot escape the cycle of birth and death. All that remains is sin attending them, loaded full and returning; no coin can they carry with them. At that time, what use is regret? There is yet another sort of confused man, who knows only to hoard wealth, unwilling to spend for eating or clothing, nor pitying the orphan, nor caring for the widowed; neither does he aid the weak or rescue the distressed, but is only a slave to wealth, a miserly ghost. When the breath is about to cease, he still directs his sons and grandsons how to make and gather wealth. Who is it that owes me less? Where is my money? Alas! When the three inches of breath break, all existence is empty; this body does not belong to me, much less wealth; is this not folly?

Those who accumulate lawful wealth prize merit and virtue above gold and silver, looking down on all things, unaroused by ten thousand ties. They accumulate meritorious deeds, endure hardships for themselves to benefit others, widely practise expedients; they regard their life as pearls and jewels, benevolence and righteousness as gold and jade, cherishing qi to nourish spirit as profit, preserving sincerity to keep truth as wealth, and purity and non-action as their family estate. As for the worldly gold, silver, and treasures, they regard them as stones and earth. For what they seek is the true treasure of the prior Heaven, and all the false treasures of the dusty world are not worth their attachment.

If the student of the Way has even a little heart of greed for wealth and profit, it will impede the Great Way. Though a practitioner, if his body has not yet left the world, he cannot altogether forsake worldly wealth; yet he ought to regard profit with righteousness, and follow its natural course, not coveting beyond measure. Even when met with natural wealth, he ought to examine its origin; if it may be taken, he takes; if it may be abandoned, he abandons. This is called taking profit in righteousness; though outwardly he takes it, inwardly his heart never takes it—how can this hinder taking it?

In old times, Confucius journeyed through the various states, and Mencius was entertained by the princes—never did they refuse the gifts of the princes; all came naturally, and were not forcibly sought. Even our ancestor of Changchun, at first did not dare greedily grasp a grain of rice or a coin, but laboured his muscles and bones, starved his body and skin, bore what others could not bear, endured what others could not endure; and when hardships were exhausted and sweetness came, unfavorable turns gave way to favorable, he was honoured by the emperors of Song, Jin, and Yuan, and never refused the gifts bestowed. Yet he accepted them to pray for rain and relieve drought, to avert disasters and support the state, building no palaces or temples, but greatly promoting the teaching of the Way. All these used wealth appropriately; yet this was only after first accumulating lawful wealth, and then borrowing worldly wealth to establish merit.

The ignorant scholars of the world do not know to urgently seek lawful wealth, but only prize worldly wealth. They deceive all directions for clothing and food, shift accounts and pile debts; no merit do they practise, no virtue accumulate, and in future lives they must repay others. To be a man is not certain; how dare they hope for immortality? There is yet a class of the sinful, who point east and convert west, deceiving good believers, doing not one good deed. Gambling and drunkenness, for a few coins, cause disputes and quarrels in slight cases, and fights and lawlessness in grievous ones. There is yet a class of false disciples of the Way, who speak of virtue but harbor wickedness in their hearts, posing and posturing like immortals. At sight of wealth, their guile is revealed; they dispute its amount, caring not for shame.

I have often said that life and death are worth less than two hundred coins; indeed it is so. I exhort the true-hearted student of the Way: quickly open the gate of wealth and profit, do not see profit and forget righteousness, nor let the heart arise in covetousness. Know that piled gold and accumulated jade cannot buy life and death; much wealth brings many burdens; much profit brings much harm. Better to die guarding the Way than to perish forsaking it—therein lies benefit. Otherwise, when the heart is heavy with profit and light with the Way, right cannot overcome wrong; deluding oneself that one understands the Way, how difficult it will be!
