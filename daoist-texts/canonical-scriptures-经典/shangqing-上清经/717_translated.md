# The Fetters of the Corporeal Form

The Ancient Master said: "The great trouble I have is because I have a body. If I had no body, what trouble could I have?" Again he said: "When the body is pursued, the body leads; when the body is set aside, the body remains." The Diamond Sutra declares: "The Tathāgata cannot be seen by bodily form." The Old Wanderer said: "You must know that the Buddha's Dharma-body is essentially without body, but it assumes the form and adornment of a body." Master Linji said: "The true Buddha has no form, the true nature has no body, the true Dharma has no image." Zhuangzi exclaimed: "Alas! Men of the world think that nourishing the body is sufficient to preserve life; if nourishing the body is indeed insufficient to preserve life, then what use is the world?" The ancient immortals said: "Do not cling to this body as if it were the Dao; outside this body there is the true body." From antiquity, those who attained the Dao, the immortals and Buddhas, did not value the corporeal form, but cultivated the Dharma-body. All men of the world recognize this corporeal form as a true treasure, and so love and cherish it. They desire to prolong its life, and cling to it without letting go. They seek honour and dignity to glorify this body; they accumulate wealth and goods to nourish this body; they eat meat and drink wine to fatten this body; they wear fine clothes and eat dainty foods to adorn this body. Day and night they scheme and plan, at every moment they devise, exhausting their heart and blood, dissipating their spirit, dwelling beside ghosts. Though they say they cherish life, in truth they injure life. They do not know that the corporeal form is the cast-off shape of Heaven and Earth, a conglomeration of the four elements. Once the yang energy is exhausted, and yin energy alone prevails, the soul flies and the spirit scatters; what remains is but a lump of foul-smelling flesh, no more than a mound of earth; where then is the truth, and where is the reality? Since it is not real, it must be false. Those who love and cherish the corporeal form, do they not add falsehood to falsehood? The foolish scholars of the world vainly imagine cultivating the True, yet know not the exhaustion of the True; they vainly imagine attaining the Dao, yet know not how to distinguish the Dao. They do not exhaust the True, do not distinguish the Dao, do not understand what the true Dao is; in confusion and stupor they take this corporeal form as true, fearing to suffer for it, fearing to labour for it, fearing to hunger or to freeze. Warm clothes and good food — to preserve and cherish this body; to be at ease and secure, to nourish this body — yet all good efforts are forsaken, while only those things that bring harm on the road of life are pursued; they do not spare spirit nor husband strength, but instead do what can be done. They recognize falsehood as truth, and illusion as reality; not knowing that within and without this body all things are injurious to life, and not one is beneficial. The eye sees fair colours and rejoices; the ear hears harsh sounds and is angry; the nose smells sweet scents and loves; the tongue tastes delicate flavours and desires; the mind is fixed on objects and craves; the body is touched and fears. Without and within there are six gates and six cognitions — these mutually assail and exhaust the true essence. The cause of this is all invoked by the corporeal form; if there were no corporeal form, whence would arise the harm of the six gates and six cognitions? Moreover, all things under Heaven that have form are subject to decay; if one cherishes this false corporeal form and does not exhaust the true nature and life, when the great limit arrives, who then am I, and whose then is the body? The body and I are two and have no concern with each other. I advise the true heart that seeks the Dao to quickly open the gate of the corporeal form, and be not deceived. Regard the seven apertures as holes; regard the four limbs as wooden joints; regard the flesh and skin as festering sores; regard the five viscera as hardened lumps. Abandon this corporeal form as beyond salvation; seek another true body, without form yet with form, without image yet with image. Only then can life be prolonged and nature be illuminated; only by abandoning the false can the True be sought; only by recognizing the false can the True be seen. Right and wrong cannot both stand; good and evil follow different paths. Otherwise, knowing the false, one cannot escape from it; not escaping the false, how can the True be sought? Not seeking the True, how can the True be cultivated? If one loves the corporeal form and does not awaken, vainly imagining understanding the Dao, this is indeed difficult.
