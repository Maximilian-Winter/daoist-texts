# The Gate of Mouth and Tongue

The Book of Changes says: "Gen is its auxiliary," signifying the presence of order. It also says: "Cultivate your words and establish sincerity; this is the method of maintaining one's pursuits." The Most Sage said: "The gentleman desires to be slow in speech, but quick in action." The Ancient Master said: "Close the gate of Dui, block its door, and throughout life be free from toil." These all teach men to be cautious in speech, and not to speak rashly.

Verily, the mouth and tongue are the gateways of ingress and egress, the root sprouts of right and wrong. They concern a man's integrity of character, they are bound with his virtue and conduct. Here is the division between gentleman and petty man; here is the distinction between the upright and the perverse. To bring about misfortune or fortune, to accomplish or to fail in affairs, all are settled here.

Therefore the gentleman considers well before he speaks. That which may be spoken, he speaks; that which may not be spoken, he holds back. Sometimes words benefit the world and the minds of men; sometimes words cause men to change for the better and rectify their faults; sometimes words encourage men to abandon evil and return to right; sometimes words serve men by facilitating ease and resolving difficulties; sometimes words conceal faults and extol virtues. But never are words to be rash, light, or false.

This is not to close the mouth and say nothing, but since a word once uttered cannot be recalled even by four horses, and since its blessing or curse is immediately seen, words must be spoken with care. If words are not cautious, though they do not harm others, they bring calamity upon oneself. The mouth and tongue do harm whose sharpness is like a knife, whose poison is like that of a serpent â€” is this a small matter?

Among the muddled students of the world, who know not profit or loss, the motion of mouth and tongue is regarded as trivial; convenience is esteemed as talent; skill in debate is taken as success. Some reveal the faults of others; some boast of their own merits; some tell lies and speak deceitfully; some praise what is right and condemn what is wrong; some say one thing and later break their word; some speak empty words without swift action; some speak wildly, thus causing calamities; some talk grandly yet accomplish nothing; some curse in broad daylight; some use cunning words to slander and flatter; some ruin affairs by their speech; some wound others by their words. All these are words that harm and never benefit. What value is there in speaking? Better it is not to speak at all.

I exhort those who truly seek the Way with sincerity to quickly close the gate of mouth and tongue, that the mouth be not rashly opened, nor the tongue rashly moved; speak not what is without propriety, and let all words be in accord with propriety. Cultivate your words and establish your sincerity; be cautious in speech and prudent in action; be absolutely not light in speech, and let words have their fitting place.

Moreover, speech is the voice of the heart, the tongue is the sprout of the heart. If the motions of mouth and tongue are not correct, it shows the heart-field is not right. If the heart-field is not right, the root is already damaged; nature is obscured; destiny is shaken; the spirit is darkly injured; and it will be difficult to imagine the bright Way and to cultivate it.
