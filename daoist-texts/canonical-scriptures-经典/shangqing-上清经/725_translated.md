# The Gate of Slothfulness

The Book of Changes says: “If one does not keep to his virtue steadfastly, he may be subjected to shame.” It also says: “The Way of Heaven and Earth is constant and enduring without ceasing.” The Most Sage said: “A gentleman who follows the Way and sets forth in it, if he should give up halfway, I cannot help it.” The Emperor of Double Ninth said: “Fragrance issues forth from the foul; sweetness comes forth from bitterness.” These are all words to show that those who study must be vigorous, courageous, and diligent; they must not be slothful nor seek ease in idleness.

The study of life and destiny is the greatest matter for man’s existence, and at the same time the most difficult matter under Heaven. In this, one must labour hard and with earnest diligence, with firm resolve; the longer the time, the greater the strength; there must be a beginning and an end, only then can progress be made. For a great matter which is constant and unchanging must surely depend on great effort which is enduring and unceasing before it can be accomplished.

Some repair bridges and mend roads to benefit the people; some dispense medicines and offer tea to relieve the urgent; some erect temples and build shrines to encourage goodness; some care for the aged and pity the poor to accumulate virtue; some support the distressed and rescue the afflicted to deliver from calamity; some teach the Way and exert their strength, raising a great dust of toil; some labour secretly in their hearts, casting aside worldly affairs entirely; some, because the principles are not clear, exhaust day and night; some, because they meet no enlightened master, search east and west; some, encountering disaster and hardship, redouble their spirit and energy. When they see one good thing, they straightway practise it; when they see one evil thing, they immediately turn away. At all times they strive with strength, at every moment they apply themselves. Every instant of time is treasured, not letting a moment of it pass in vain.

Naturally and humbly they ascend to heights; from the shallow they advance into the deep; like a crane standing among chickens, at length they attract the regard of superior men. But worldly ignorant students establish not a single merit, cultivate not a single virtue, seeking only pleasure and fearing hardship. When they see tasks that require effort, they keep far away; when they encounter the place where work must be done, they retreat. Filled with food and idle all day, they apply their minds to nothing. Leisurely wandering about, aimless and unproductive.

When they meet an enlightened master, they indulge in wild thoughts over a word or half a phrase, thinking themselves greatly enlightened. Outwardly they wear the guise of honesty, but inwardly they harbour thievish hearts. They are unwilling to search thoroughly into principles, nor do they temper themselves by means of the scriptures. After three mornings and two days, seeking a secret formula but finding none, they conclude there is no affinity, and at once depart afar.

There is yet another sort of sinner, a criminal man, who blames not himself for lack of resolve, but slanders the master as stingy, harbouring enmity in his heart, never releasing it throughout life. Such conduct is without enduring resolve, without a true heart to learn the Way. Not only will they find it hard to ascend to Heaven, but they will fall down to Hell.

I exhort those who sincerely seek to learn the Way to speedily break through the gate of slothfulness. Accumulate abundant hidden virtue; according to your strength, perform your tasks. Externally benefit beings, internally refine yourself. Morning after morning, evening after evening, take life and destiny as paramount; reflect ever and always, regarding body and mind as your concern. Step by step exert effort, everywhere advance onward, and never change until death.

In the end, there will be a day of emergence, a time of attainment. Otherwise, hesitating and shrinking back, slothful and muddled, wasting the years, great toils of small suffering cannot be completed. As for becoming Immortals or Buddhas, a rare and great matter, how can it ever be accomplished? To imagine the Way clearly, to transcend men and Heaven, to escape the sea of suffering—this is indeed difficult.
