# The Gate of Talent and Wisdom

The Book of Changes says: "Labor and humility: the superior man has an end; good fortune." The Perfect Sage said: "Suppose one had the talents and excellences of the Duke of Zhou, yet were proud and stingy, all else would be unworthy of regard." The Old Ancestor said: "Great accomplishment is as if incomplete; its use is not worn out; great fullness is as if empty; its use is inexhaustible; great straightness is as if bent; great skill is as if clumsy; great eloquence is as if slow of speech." These all speak of not employing talent, not using wisdom; only thus can one complete his talent and preserve his wisdom. What is talent? It is cleverness and skill. What is wisdom? It is planning and adaptability. Talent is that which the world prizes. Especially with regard to fame and achievement, without talent and wisdom they cannot be accomplished; wealth and goods cannot be obtained without talent and wisdom; to engage with the world and handle affairs, talent and wisdom are placed first. Yet when one probes to the root, all men are alike—by their talents and wisdom they lose their lives, but men have not pondered this deeply. For they employ talent and wisdom to seek fame and gain; day and night they labor their minds, being deluded by fame and gain; they know only to advance, not to retreat; know only happiness, not misfortune. They exhaust their spirit and consume their vitality; contend eagerly and desire to prevail; overthink and overstrain; their essence and blood are dried up; their bodies decay. Even before fame and gain are obtained, life is lost: is this not employing talent and wisdom, and yet being harmed by them?

Among the confused scholars of the world, none know that talent and wisdom are the greatest cause of error. In every act and movement, relying on their small cleverness and feigning wit, they boast of their ability before others, thinking no one equals them. Some rely on talent and regard no one; some use wisdom to seek merely food and clothing; some forcibly argue right and wrong and oppress their superiors; some utter strange words and evil speech, thereby committing sins and misleading the people; some cite a few official cases and borrow them to bewilder men; some compose a few poems and songs and pride themselves on having the Way; some learn a few tricks of posture and lead the blind astray. Some even obstinately adhere to their views, taking male and female as yin and yang, leading men into sin and into the practice of sorcery; some consider the Golden Elixir as having form, consuming men's money and leading them to burn and refine. All these are men confident in their talent and wisdom, misusing their cleverness and measuring with a small eye; all are like walking paths in the dark, living in dried wells.

They do not realize that those who truly seek the Way reject cleverness and destroy wisdom, hiding their brilliance and nurturing obscurity. They do not thrust themselves forward amidst worldly affairs, nor contend for victory in common matters. With a single pure thought, they know not the myriad things. They seek a wise teacher, visit good friends, and regard life as a great matter. Sincere and honest, simple and true, they use in no degree the false talent and false wisdom of the outer world. I advise those who sincerely learn the Way to quickly clear the gate of talent and wisdom. Sweep away the false talent and wisdom of external use, and resort to the true talent and wisdom of internal use. Cast away all manner of eagerness to contend and prevail, self-willed teachers, vain conjectures, false opinions, making nothing into something, emptiness into fullness, and so on—these various diseases are wiped away in one stroke. Renew your head and change your face, enter with sincerity and employ softness; then indeed there is hope in learning the Way. Otherwise, one is like a self-exalting sage, knowing only oneself and not others, relying on talent and wisdom, cunning and craft. Though intending to advance, one falls behind. To vainly think to understand the Way is difficult indeed.
