# The Gate of Guizha (Deceit and Cunning)

The Book of Changes says, "Wash, but do not offer." The Book of Poetry says, "The divine is ever exact in thought; thought cannot be anticipated, much less aimed at." The Jade Pivot Classic says, "Enter with sincerity." The Treatise on the Kinship of the Three teaches, "A filial son applies his heart, moving the Supreme Pole." Shang Yangzi said, "Though Heaven may sometimes be adverse, one must seek it with treasure and true sincerity." All these utterances speak to the use of a sincere heart in affairs, without the least thought of guile, deceit, or falsehood.

The learner who studies the Way esteems above all the true heart and genuine intention; by humbling himself and placing himself beneath, he can move the true master, gain the trust of good friends, and receive their beneficial aid. For when I have a true heart, my master and friends will meet me with a true heart; when I have genuine intention, they will respond in kind. This mutual response is a fixed and unalterable principle.

But if one cannot have true heart and genuine intention, and instead employs craft, deceit, and falsehood, appearing fair in face but false in heart, thinking to deceive the wise, he little knows that the true master, with clear discernment and distant vision, sees at a glance the true from the false. To deceive others is in truth to deceive oneself; to conceal from others is truly to conceal from oneself. Not only does this bring no benefit, but it brings harm to the matter itself. Wherefore is deceit to be employed?

Among the world’s confused learners, confused monks, and confused seekers of the Way, they regard life and destiny as common things, and the study of the Way as a common matter. When they meet a true master they ask about the primal gate; when they meet a companion on the Way they boast of mysteries. They know not the principles of revering the master, nor the path of respecting friends. Some use lies and deceitful speech to insult and disdain; some employ false intent and hollow affection to adorn themselves; some use clever words and pleasing countenance merely to win favour; some point east and paint west to lure others into revealing secrets; some recline obliquely and lean on others while questioning difficulties; some seek secrets for a single meal; some sit opposite and engage in high talk and disputation; some, after slight trial, harbor resentment; some, upon encountering hardship, flee; some glance over scriptures and briefly survey the great meaning, passing on without reflection; some hear the master’s words but never savour them, only carefully remembering the phrases; some outwardly study the Way but inwardly scheme other affairs; some intend to cultivate the Way but turn about and cling to worldly passions.

Such maladies are countless. How can they move the true master’s guidance or the support of good friends? I exhort those who truly seek the Way with sincere hearts to swiftly open and clear the gate of guile and cunning, and exchange it for a heart of utmost sincerity. To advance from a place of truth, one must by no means harbour the slightest thought of deceit and craft, lest one deceive others and oneself, thus losing the path ahead.

For the single word "sincerity" can move Heaven and Earth, commune with spirits and gods, and affect men and things. Is there a master or friend who cannot be moved? If one can move master and friend, then the Great Way may be hoped for. But if there be the least falsehood or deceit in thought, then the heart is not sincere. The heart not sincere, there arises a great malady within one’s breast; not only is truth unattainable, but one darkens its very light. To vainly desire to illumine the Way is indeed difficult.
