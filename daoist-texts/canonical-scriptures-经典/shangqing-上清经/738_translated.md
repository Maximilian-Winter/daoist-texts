# The Gate of Not Long Delay

The Book of Changes says: 'If one does not continue in his virtue, he may suffer the shame of inheritance.' The Most Sage said: 'A man without constancy cannot be a shaman or a physician.' Zi-si said: 'If one does not attain perfect virtue, the highest Way does not congeal.' Mencius said: 'The superior man cultivates the Way deeply, desiring that it be obtained of itself.' Yuan Duzi said: 'He who studies the Complete Reality learns the master’s brief indication of the door and path, yet does not understand the successive details and matters; he knows that spirit and breath mutually depend, yet does not comprehend the mingling of lead and mercury; he knows the mingling of lead and mercury, yet does not understand the union of nature and life. Deluded in reckoning the proper time for action, not knowing when to advance or retreat — all these result in no accomplishment.'

The Ancient Scripture says: 'Where speech is not understood, there is no kinship; where effort does not arrive, there is no square or circle.' These words all speak of cultivation of the Way and establishment of virtue, which must be accompanied by a steadfast and lasting resolve. The Way of cultivating the True is the study of exhausting principle, nature, and life to the utmost. To exhaust principle is to exhaust it to such a degree that not the least doubt remains, not the least ignorance exists; then is there great enlightenment and great awakening. When knowledge is true and perception is accurate, then principle begins to be clear. To exhaust nature is to exhaust it until there remains not the least breath or desire; then one is able to be empty and void. To be clear without obscurity, dark without confusion, then nature is exhausted. To exhaust life is necessarily to sever oneself from yin and yang, to leap beyond the five elements; then is it said that one’s power is completely transformed, unmoved and unshaken, free and self-exclusive, and life is established.

Yet the matter of exhausting principle, nature, and life is not a work of one morning or one evening. It requires the establishment of a long-lasting resolve, the practice of enduring effort, that one may attain clear principle, exhausted nature, perfect life, abiding in the midst of creation yet not restrained by creation. Especially, the great matter of permanence and unchangeableness demands the great work of enduring perseverance to accomplish it. Among the many perfected ones of old, which was there not one who established a lasting resolve and used enduring effort to complete it? Consider even the subtle arts of the world: they too require devoted attention, listening to the teacher’s instruction, many years of labour, before one can attain facility and adapt the work to materials. How much more so the great matter of nature and life! Can such be known by one without constancy of heart?

The vulgar scholars of the world do not know what principle is; they study the empty fixation upon phenomena and affairs, and call this understanding of principle. They do not know what nature is; or they imagine nature to be in the cavity between the eyebrows, the Spirit residing upon the head, and call this cultivation of nature. They do not know what life is; or they imagine life to be in the elixir field and breath-sea, the mind fixed on the lower origin, and call this cultivation of life. Alas! To call these principle, nature, and life, is a vain fancy of transcendence, hoping for immortality; like climbing a tree to seek fish, or rubbing the eyes to produce flowers—what real benefit is there? If principle, nature, and life cannot be known, how can one hope for immortality?

Even a few scholars, discriminating right and wrong, distinguishing truth and falsehood, yet still vainly fancy rapid attainment and eagerly desire quick effect. Over time they grow slack, lacking a lasting heart, with little firm thought; now advancing, now retreating; now moving, now stopping. Just as they wish to advance, they shrink back; wavering between emptiness and substance, uncertain and unsettled. Such as these, how can they perceive the true inner hall and reality? I exhort those with sincere hearts who learn the Way to quickly clear the gate of not long delay, to establish a lasting resolve, to apply enduring effort, and not to be of divided mind or to abandon halfway. The longer and harder the effort, the greater the difficulty and bitterness, yet in the end there will be a time of attainment and satisfaction. Otherwise, if one begins diligently but ends laxly, speaking and acting without regard, vainly imagining hearing the Way, it will be difficult indeed.
