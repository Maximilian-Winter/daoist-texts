# The Gate of Ornament and Adornment

The Tao and its Virtue say: The fields are very overgrown; the granaries are very empty; men wear embroidered robes and gird themselves with sharp swords; they are disgusted with food and drink, and have wealth and goods in abundance. Is this the Tao, or is it not? The Classic of Nanhua says: All that is heavy without is clumsy within. Mencius says: To be widely praised and to make it known on oneself is to disregard the embroidered and adorned of others. All these speak of those who cultivate the Tao: they must by no means labour for the outside and lose the within, nor abandon the real and follow the false. 

For the study of nature and life is the business of what is true, real, and practical. Not a bit of falsity or affectation may enter; not the least touch of artifice may be applied. If there be the least admixture of falsity and artifice, not only can nature and life not be cultivated, but there will be cause to ruin the mind and ground. Therefore, from ancient times the perfect men who cultivate the true have regarded nature and life as the chief things, wearing but a single robe and carrying a single gourd, with dishevelled hair and barefooted, passing their days according to circumstances, caring not for splendour or finery, and having no ornamentation at all. Great wisdom seems like folly; great skill seems clumsy; they harmonize their light and mingle with the dust, associating with the common and vulgar, so that common eyes cannot recognize them. 

In times past the great sage Hui Neng hid himself among the hunters of Sihui; the Chan Master Daoguang abandoned his monkhood and returned to secular life, thus accomplishing the great matter; Emperor Zhongyang lodged in the tomb of the living dead; the great Changchun arose amid dust and toil; Ziqing grasped a thatched roof for a hat; Sanfeng wore torn clothes and worn shoes. All these were matters of great concern to nature and life, setting the coloured body aside and not adorning or beautifying it. 

Again, consider Zhang the Mad Immortal of Xianyang who concealed himself among farmers; Zhang the Sleeping Immortal of Nie dwelt beside the icy beach; the Immortal of Baishi Bridge carried water and ferried passengers to mingle with the vulgar; my teacher Liuxiansheng carried wood by the riverbank to train himself. All these true ones, openly undergoing hardship and secretly practising diligently, how have they ever adorned their bodies or decorated their appearance? Only because they placed what was important within, and what was light without, did they care for the real and reject the false.

The confused scholars of the world place importance on the outside and slight the within. They recognize the false and abandon the true, doing everything contrary to the ancients. Some fear being laughed at, and must wear splendid scarves and robes; some dread the cold and must pile on many garments; some adorn themselves with elaborate coiffures and copper hoops; some wear strange fillets and swagger haughtily; some dazzle men's eyes and ears to beguile and be supported; some sit in circles, shutting themselves away, buying fame and seeking praise. Acting and hiding thus, they only work at false matters, and never apply their hearts and minds to nature and life. Recognizing the false and pursuing it, they vainly hope to obtain the true. It is like fishing for the moon in the sea, or plucking flowers in a mirror—at last they fall into emptiness.

I exhort the sincere and true-hearted who study the Tao to quickly break open the gate of ornament and adornment. Gather splendour and seek reality; wear coarse clothes and torn garments, keep to the proper and fitting; be plain and indifferent; regard nature and life as chief; esteem Tao and Virtue as precious; turn from evil to right; in all things be real and solid—then there will be progress and benefit. Otherwise, taking the non-existent for the existent, and the false for the real, labouring for the outside and losing the inside, abandoning the true and following the false, vainly imagining that one understands the Tao—this is difficult indeed!
