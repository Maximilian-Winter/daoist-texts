# The Gate of False Knowledge

The Most Sacred said: To know that one knows, and to know that one does not know, that is knowledge. The Old Ancestor said: To know that one does not know is highest; not to know that one knows is sickness. The Perfected One of Purple Yang said: Even though one may recognise cinnabar and black lead, if one does not know the timing of the fire, it is as if idle. In great measure it all depends on the power of cultivation and practice; a hair’s breadth of difference will fail to form the elixir.

The Master Yuan Duzi said: The disciple of the Way, who obtains the true essence of the internal and external medicines, and the entire action of the two phases, and combines them with the great creation, then receives the transmission. If there be even a hair’s breadth of difference, the heavens and earth will remain asunder. This all means to say that in learning the Way it is necessary to have true knowledge and clear insight, and it is not permissible to take not knowing as knowing; to err in so great a matter is fatal.

The learner who seeks a teacher and visits friends does so because of his ignorance and desires to acquire knowledge. To seek knowledge it is necessary to know what is nature, what is destiny, what is yin and yang, what are the five phases, what is prior to heaven, what is after heaven, what is activity, what is rest, what is doing, what is non-doing, what is refining, what is nourishing, what is connecting with destiny, what is completing nature. From beginning to end, with great penetration and great enlightenment, without the slightest doubt, then one is said to be thorough in all directions, with true knowledge and clear insight, and in conduct there is no error.

If one knows nature but not destiny, knows destiny but not nature, knows yin and yang but not the five phases, knows after heaven but not prior to heaven, knows activity but not rest, knows doing but not non-doing, knows refining but not nourishing, knows connecting with destiny but not completing nature, altogether one cannot be said to know the Way. Not knowing the Way, how can one act in the Way? For in the study of nature and destiny, one part of knowledge is matched by one part of practice, ten parts knowledge by ten parts practice. There has never been one who did not know and yet could act.

Hence the cultivator of the Way values first and foremost to seek knowledge. But to seek knowledge one must first know that one has both knowledge and ignorance, and truly know this one fact, then one may say that one knows. If there be the least doubt, seeming so and yet not so, that is not knowledge. One must again seek the wise to enlighten one, that the heart and earth may be made clear, that doubts be wholly dispelled, then it may be called knowledge. By no means should one take not knowing to be knowing, thereby delaying oneself.

In the world, confused learners know not what nature and destiny are, nor what cultivation is. They study this and that side door, contrive crooked paths, muddled and confused, and fancy themselves to know the Way. Rashly they begin, not only without benefit but to their own injury. There is an even worse sort of wicked man, who takes non-being as being, and emptiness as fullness, who cannot distinguish right from wrong, nor investigate truth and falsity, and make falsehood truth. He injures himself, knowing well his error, yet feigns as a superior man, and further misleads others down the wrong road, making their error yet more grievous and pernicious.

There are also those who approach a bright master, hear a few words of a phrase, not tasting the flavour in detail, and regard remembering the phrase as knowing, and thus display themselves before men. Or having read a few volumes of alchemical scriptures, following a few strokes of ink, guessing at random without head or tail, they also say they have knowledge. Even with a bright master before them, they seek no verification. Such as these are all those who take not knowing for knowing — this is called false knowledge, not true knowledge. From ancient times to the present, learners who have fallen into this snare are countless.

Alas! What is the matter of nature and destiny that it should be so confused, deceiving oneself and others? Little do they know that only with thorough knowledge can one act thoroughly. One must exert all effort in careful discrimination, diligently pursuing, yet still fearing that knowledge is not attained and action is not accomplished, and therefore one must seek a teacher. How much more so those who, not knowing, pretend to know!

I exhort the true-hearted learner of the Way to swiftly break through the gate of false knowledge, to sweep away the heart of self-conceit. The ignorant should urgently seek knowledge, and those who know should press on to deeper knowledge. The matter of nature and destiny is great, the supreme Way subtle. One must probe to the utmost, the more one knows the deeper one enters. One must reach the point where water is exhausted and mountains are at their end, and only then see the ultimate ground and cease. If one falsely pretends to be wise, treating nature and destiny as a childish game, the ignorant will never know, and those with some knowledge will find it hard to deepen it; vainly imagining they understand the Way, how difficult it is!
