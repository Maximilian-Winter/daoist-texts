# The Gate of Greedy Drinking

Mencius said: Yu detested strong wine but loved words of goodness. LÃ¼zu said: Wine, lust, wealth, and anger are four enclosing walls, within which every man hides. If one leaps beyond these walls, that is the method of long life and immortality. These all teach men not to be greedy for wine and thus ruin right affairs. For wine is the chief of four harms. When one is greedy for wine, drunkenness blinds the nature; lustful thoughts arise therefrom; covetous desires spring thence; and rash temper bursts forth. Wealth, lust, and anger all start from wine; loss of virtue and ruinous conduct are also caused by wine. Indeed, men give free rein to their passions and act disorderly, treading upon water and fire without knowledge, falling into sword and spear without awareness. Since ancient times, how many wise and good men, heroes and great ones, have often suffered this calamity, and perished by their own hands. Yet there are those whose nature is good and disposition firm, who though greedy for wine do not go astray, and lust, wealth, and anger cannot taint them. Though they do not go astray nor are tainted, their spirits are dimmed and their breath hurried; damp heat steams them; their fluids dry up and blood and qi are injured; no benefit but harm results. Therefore the Buddhists hold wine as the foremost precept to beware of, because its harm is greatest.
In the world, foolish students, borrowing the words of the Ancestor Masters about wine and meat penetrating the intestines and residing in the heart, yet without shunning the foulness and dizziness and endless talk about wine, become greedy for wine without limit. Day by day they dwell in the land of drunkenness, dull and heavy, staggering and tumbling, letting their natures roam at will. Sometimes drunk, they lose their words and wound others; sometimes drunk, they cherish grudges and make disturbances; sometimes drunk, they seize knives and wield clubs; sometimes drunk, naked and exposed, they speak confusedly; sometimes drunk, they fall in streets and alleys, abandoning shame and modesty; sometimes drunk, they vomit and injure their qi, their spirits restless. So long continued, sickness is created; food is refused; and to death they do not desist. There are also those who single-heartedly long for the Dao, and can rid themselves of many partial ailments, but yet cannot abstain from this dregs and dregs of taste. Alas! The cultivators of the true way must strive to uproot the dust accumulated through many kalpas, the seed of transmigration. Wine is but a taste of the mouth, an external thing; it is not the root brought down from many kalpas. In this little ailment they cannot rid themselves during their whole life; how then can they uproot the seed of transmigration? Such persons do they not bring great harm from small things, and seek their own death? Moreover, the one thing wine is not like is food and drink; if food and drink are not taken for several days, though hunger may ruin the body, yet if wine is never used throughout life, what harm is there? If it be said it quenches thirst, water and soup are very convenient; why must wine be used? In the end it is the deep disease of greed for wine, unwilling to be cured. I exhort those sincerely learning the Way to quickly break open the gateway of greedy drinking, and turn the good wine of their thoughts to the utmost labour of investigation and diligent study. Let not the crooked demon disturb and vex them. Though wine be a minor matter, it can ruin great affairs; vigorously cast it away, and the benefit is very great. Otherwise, greedy for wine without limit, living a life of drunken dreams and death, they dwell daily in the land of confusion, ever caught in the net of dulness, vainly imagining themselves to comprehend the Way; how difficult will it be!
