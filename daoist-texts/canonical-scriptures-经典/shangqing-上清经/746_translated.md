# The Gate of Fear toward Hardship

The Doctrine of the Mean says: If a man can do a thing once, I will do it a hundred times; if a man can do it ten times, I will do it a thousand times. If one can indeed follow this way, though foolish he will be enlightened, though soft he will be strong. In the Great Antiquity it was said: A moment's sleep is a moment's death; a day's sleep is a day's death; if without sleep one labours daily, after a thousand days the task is completed. A proverb says: 'Those who do not descend into the bitterest of bitterness, find it hard to be above men.' All these speak of matters greatly to be desired, which must be accomplished only by diligence and hardship.

The greatest matters under Heaven require the greatest exertion of hardship, and only after long time do they come to completion. Hardship is great, and so is accomplishment thereby. Much more so with the great matter of life and destiny: is there any that can be accomplished without hardship? The word 'hardship' is the good medicine for the sick in the way of cultivation. Only by enduring hardship can the body and mind be tempered; only thus can great diseases be cured. Therefore one must accumulate merit by outward exertion, and inwardly refine thoughts and intentions; one must weary the sinews and bones, starve the body and skin, empty the person of all superfluity; in all places practise effort, in all matters labour diligently.

To mend bridges and repair roads, to diminish self and benefit others; to bear insult and endure disgrace; to follow the convenience of circumstances. When men praise me, I do not praise myself; when men love me, I do not love them; when men suffer difficulty, I endure it; when men pass through hardship, I pass through it. All that has been learned and tainted since birth, all worldly things, are to be utterly cast away—this is another form of hardship. Inwardly to arrange the spirit, to strengthen the will; to remove desires, to sweep away false thoughts; all vexations, all ignorance—cut them down with force. When they cannot be removed, yet one will remove them; when they cannot be cast out, yet one will cast them out—this is the true heart seeking the Way, never forsaken for an instant; all else is rejected. This is the inner hardship.

When hardship without and within are made one, this is the true hardship, and only thus can great diseases be cured. Formerly Shakyamuni practised on snowy mountains; the Sixth Patriarch and the Four Assemblies laboured diligently; the Patriarch Qiu at Panxi ground his nature. Like these sages and worthies, all were endowed by Heaven, yet still had to pass through great hardship. How much more so the later disciples, who are of middling or lower rank! Is there any that can succeed without hardship?

Among worldly men, foolish learners know not the joy born of hardship, nor the treasure of freedom, nor how to become at ease and attain the Way. When they hear of descending into hardship, they at once feel dismay; when they hear of labour and exertion, they at once find difficulty. By day they spare their strength to fatten, eating full and idle; by night they lie in soft quilts and thick blankets, taking long sleep. They do no small deeds to benefit others, nor exert themselves in any part. Countless faults remain uncorrected. Some read a few alchemical books, some ponder over a few volumes of scripture, and feign having the Way; some wander and beg, fed and clothed warmly, and think this to be their achievement; some dwell in temples and hermitages, with the abbot performing incense and austerities, accepting neither hunger nor cold, deeming this to be the avoidance of worldly affairs. Such persons never think to abandon father and mother, or to cast away wife and child. If taking up the monastic life is but for food and clothing, how differ they from worldly men? Why then burden themselves with debts in ten directions? Is it not needless?

I exhort the true-hearted learner of the Way to swiftly open the gate of fear toward hardship; to establish a resolve to endure hardship unto death, never to turn back; to place life and destiny upon the forehead, and be watchful at every moment. In all matters profitable, exert all effort; in all matters unprofitable, exert all effort to abandon. Except for the austerities of self-discipline, obey the teacher's instructions one by one as if they were commands; do not let laziness arise; labour day and night without ceasing, and in time true benefit will be attained. Otherwise, if one fears hardship, hesitates and does not act, prolonging life in vain hopes to hear the Way, success will be difficult indeed.
