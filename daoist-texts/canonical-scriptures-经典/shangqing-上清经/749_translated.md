# Gate of Swift Effect

The Great Learning says: "When things are investigated, knowledge becomes complete; when knowledge is complete, the mind becomes sincere; when the mind is sincere, the heart is rectified; when the heart is rectified, the person is cultivated." The Tao Te Ching says: "Great vessels are late in completion." Shang Yangzi said: "The great cultivator puts away altogether the hearts of sorrow, thought, and hardship of ordinary times; he casts off clinging and loving thoughts; he is serene and detached, without the least entanglement or care. Truly, his form is like a withered tree, and his heart like dead ashes." The ancient immortals say: "If speech is not understood, they are not relatives; if the effort is not made, nothing will be perfect." Again it is said: "The returning elixir comes in a single moment; to refine oneself requires ten months." These all declare that the cultivation of the Way must proceed in order, advancing step by step, applying effort gradually, and only after long time can it be attained. One must not leap ranks to seek sudden results or be eager to see effect.

The study of nature and life is the way of long life and prolonged vision. Long life and prolonged vision must have the thought of enduring time, the practice of enduring actions; as years deepen and days lengthen, only when power and perseverance are not wasted can success be attained. It is not the work of one morning or one evening. For since the beginningless kalpas, men have accumulated sins like mountains and offenses as deep as the sea. The present world brings with it the root dust of kalpa after kalpa, the seeds of transmigration; with these are received the partial qi of the five elements of post-heaven, acquired defilements of dust and dirt, a thousand demons and myriad monsters, disorderly and confused. They bewilder my original spirit, consume my original qi, and steal my original essence. They cause the innate true substance to be digested and worn away, leaving the body purely yin. What remains is but a trace of yang, hidden and not manifest. If one desires to uproot all the root dust seeds of transmigration through kalpas, to transform and dispel the partial qi of the post-heaven five elements, and to remove accumulated habits and old stains, without patient years and bitter exertion, no effect can be seen.

For as long as one particle of yang qi is not exhausted, death will not come; as long as one particle of yin qi is not exhausted, immortality will not be attained. Therefore the ancestral masters established the way of return, instructing students to work on the solid ground. Step by step they exert strength, constantly practising, gradually applying effort, until surely the yin qi is exhausted and the yang qi is pure and complete. The so-called yin qi is the root dust, partial qi, and habitual stains of yin; the so-called yang qi is the original spirit, original qi, and original essence of yang. Consider this: to remove this yin and return this yang, is it an easy matter to dispel, or an ordinary matter to restore? This Way is not only difficult to practise and maintain, but also difficult to distinguish the yang and yin clearly. Those confused scholars of the world, when first entering the gate, immediately think of secret formulas; before learning the work, they imagine to become adepts. Without scrutinizing the scriptures or practising merit and virtue, even when meeting a clear master, they dream of taking treasure easily. They do not know that a city wall of a thousand chariots is not easily obtained; the pearl of mother and child is most difficult to seek. The path of true cultivation is like the wall and the pearl; it requires earnest exertion and patience through the years before effect can be seen. How can it be obtained by chance? There are those who obtain it by chance; they are not of the orthodox path, but of crooked ways. The crooked ways and side doors that yield effect easily but success with difficulty will in time surely bring harm.

But the genuine great Way cultivates the formless qi of the innate; effect is difficult to see but success is easy; over time benefit will surely be gained. Moreover, those who hear the Way are lesser sages; those who accomplish the Way are great sages. To become a sage one must have great virtue in ancestors, merit and practice in former kalpas, early encounter with a clear master in this life, and gain hearing of the great Way. If ancestors lack virtue, and oneâ€™s own practice is scanty, how can one hear the Way of the sages, or obtain the position of the sage? Yet, since one is a student, one must first exhaust human effort, with sincere will and bitter labour, and truly listen and learn. Each step taken has its benefit; each ten steps have their benefits. Even if in this life and world one is not clear in great matters, if the roots have been planted, the next life may be hoped for.

I exhort those who sincerely seek the Way to quickly open the gate of swift effect. Establish a will that endures without ceasing; upon hearing a good word or seeing a good deed, immediately attend and take it. Practice the alchemical scriptures, keep close to a clear master, and apply effort at the present moment and self. Even if one cannot complete the great Way, one will be an extraordinary person, no longer making a living in the sea of suffering. Otherwise, if one does not establish enduring resolve, does not hold eternal intention, is eager for quick results, and despises weariness, one desires to ascend to heaven but falls into a pit; to dream of the clear Way is difficult indeed.
