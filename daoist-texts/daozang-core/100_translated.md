# Precious Decree of the Ingenious Saintly Immortal Master

With devoted heart I bow and submit myself. His divine workmanship and spirit-like craft, uniquely endowed with the artificer's mind. He sets up the rules and measures the round and the square; he fixes the standard and gauges the straight and the level. He devised the saw and the plane, and greatly promoted earth and wood works; with skill he carves and polishes, raising lofty buildings with projecting eaves. His art excels in all under Heaven, his ingenuity surpasses the work of Heaven itself. The great axle and the mallet, his achievements outshine antiquity and the present. Supreme in wisdom and understanding, consummate in skill and spirit. The Ingenious Saintly Immortal Master, the Great Teacher who assists the realm, the Ancestor Master Lu Ban.
