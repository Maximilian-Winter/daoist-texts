# The Precious Edict of Marshal Zhao

With heartfelt mind I turn and bow in reverence.  
Spirit communicating and vastly unfolded,  
Holy virtue manifest and illustrious,  
Condensed into form at the primal beginning of the Great Brahma,  
Revealed and transformed throughout the boundless ages.  
Holding the whip and tether,  
Subduing tigers and casting down demons,  
Flying through the three realms, the ghosts and spirits are struck with awe;  
At a single breath, heaven and earth are shaken.  
His mighty radiance is clear and shining; none who hold wishes but obey.  
The profound mirror, spirit-bright, responds to all requests.  
He rescues living beings from their suffering and disease,  
Secures the peace and tranquillity of families and states,  
Praises the Dao and its law as endless,  
Truly restrains the mysterious wind through eternal kalpas,  
Of great compassion and great vow, great saint and great mercy,  
Supporting heaven, the vast saint, the Ruyi Harmonious Great Divine Lord.
