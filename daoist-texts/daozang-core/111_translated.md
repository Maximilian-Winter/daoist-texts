# The Precious Edict of Lord Pang of Heaven

With reverent heart I bow and submit my life in homage.  
Exalted above the spirits of the skies, the True King of Jade Purity.  
The Sovereign of the Primordial Chaos of the Supreme Purity,  
The Swift and Flying Heavenly King of the Jade Palace.  
He reports affairs and seizes the messengers of demons and devils,  
The Godly Lord who punishes evil and enacts retribution.  
He commands the Great God of Thunder and Lightning,  
A great officer known throughout the three realms.  
He governs the Grand Generals of the Thunder Division,  
The Vice Marshal of the Heavenly Decree of Thunder and Lightning.  
He aids the Mystery in the Nine Heavens,  
The Revered Celestial of Thunderâ€™s voice and manifest transformation.
