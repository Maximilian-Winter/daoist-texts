# The Precious Edict of the Marshal of the Three Fields

With devoted heart I bow and offer reverence.  
Delighting in extending the Three Divisions, lofty and erect as ten lotuses.  
Marking the pitch and tone, the red plum blossoms burst forth;  
Performing the ritual melodies, the varicoloured phoenix soars aloft.  
Dwelling in samādhi amid play, subduing the demon spirits;  
Turning the seven refuges to heal the affliction, removing calamities and burdens.  
The jade statutes and golden laws, the records of the Dharma,  
The two principles and eight trigrams display the command banners.  
Serving as envoy to patrol before the Jade Emperor’s Hall, receiving honoured mandate,  
Upholding authority in rewarding and punishing, within the Purple Mist Palace extolling meritorious deeds.  
Penetrating upright Qi to the clouds above,  
Returning the primal spirit to the constellation of Wings.  
The Dharma-name is the Great Sage of Song and Dance,  
The Dao-title is the Most Honoured of Harmonious Joy.  
In charge of a million young ones,  
Among the sacred host united in the Dipper,  
Great compassion and great vow transform the noble and the heroic,  
The Inspector of the Nine Heavens,  
Commander of the illustrious marquis,  
Marshal of the Three Fields of the Court of Wind and Fire.
