# Chapter the Third: The Trial of the Mind on the Way; The Special Setting of the Welcoming Dragon Gate; The Mortal Body Cast into the Bosom of a Filial Maiden

It is said that the Fire Dragon Zhenren took with him that divine dragon formed from strips of bamboo cord, and bade it, according to former instructions, to transform its dharma body into something exceedingly fine and subtle, so as to pass through the gate prepared beforehand. If it could pass through, then indeed its cultivation of the Way was deemed successful; but if it failed, not only would all its efforts be lost, but it would send a life to an undeserved death under the sharp point. This was a matter of utmost peril. Some say this was but the means by which the Fire Dragon Zhenren tested the courage of those who cultivate the Way, always encouraging them to diligence and effort.

In truth, this gate has never harmed the lives of those sincere in their cultivation of the Way; but for the band of demons beneath the waters, who have forged evil arts and seek to come ashore to do harm, they must pass through this gate. When the gate-sharp is closed, life is not preserved. Since the establishment of this gate, it is said many evil spirits have been eliminated. Later, these demons, knowing the fierceness of the gate-sharp, and that they must pass through this gate to leave the waters, ceased their evil thoughts and secretly cultivated the true fruit. All this was the功 (merit) of the Fire Dragon Zhenren in setting the gate.

Now the dragon formed of bamboo cord, its cultivation complete, at that moment passed through in a single dive without the slightest injury. Truly its magic power was vast, and its courage and heart firm. Even if its skill were incomplete, how could the Zhenren bear to cast it into death’s place? Though this is but an ideal saying, it seems reasonable. Hence there is another saying: this gate is not only no instrument for dragon-slaying, but is indeed a ladder for welcoming dragons to heaven. So all call this gate the Welcoming Dragon Gate. The mouth of the Welcoming Dragon Gate is simply called the gate-mouth. This gate-mouth and the Welcoming Dragon Gate originally lay within the Seven-Li Channel; later generations, through errors and misreports, said it was at the mouth of the Qiantang River. How this misreport came to be, is beyond verification.

Now it is told that the Fire Dragon Zhenren stood upon the clouds, seeing the bamboo dragon pass through the gate, he greatly rejoiced in his heart, and hastily stretched out his hand to beckon; the dragon then leapt upward. The Zhenren commanded, “You have laboured diligently for several hundred years, your功 (merit) has reached eight or nine parts of completion; now you must take on a human form for a time, that you may ascend to heaven and receive the imperial commission, and be enrolled among the ranks of immortals.” The dragon ceased not to kowtow in gratitude. The Zhenren, with both hands, bound the dragon’s head, pressed it upon his forehead, exploring the dragon pearl in his hand; then, with a flourish of his robe-sleeve, he pushed this clumsy body straight into his old abode, the伏龍潭 (Hidden Dragon Pool). He chanted the spell of moving mountains, and brought forth a great mountain, pressing the dragon’s body into muddy powder. Henceforth, this伏龍潭, deep to myriad fathoms, was transformed into a high mountain. Through the years and months, the mountain inclined and extended into the river; the sands and stones from the mountain flew into the river, and the near-mountain area became a shoal. This is what is nowadays called the Seven-Li Channel. Even now the local people can recount the lore of this valley and mountain. But as time is long, the traditions differ, and all speak variously.

Turning to the dragon’s body compressed beneath the mountain, its spirit yet opened wide its mouth, coiling about the Zhenren’s body, who held the dragon pearl in his hand. The Zhenren, hand holding the pearl, body bound to the great dragon, was evidently the banner that led the dragon’s soul. Seeing the dragon’s body pressed beneath the mountain, he suddenly smiled and clapped his hands; stooping down, he saw the dragon’s soul still turning its head towards the deep pool. The Zhenren immediately stretched out his hand, struck the dragon’s泥丸 (brain-pellet), and sternly said, “Are you still reluctant to part with that ugly, mouldy, bamboo cord?” The dragon’s soul, hearing this, hastily submitted to the Zhenren, and with its mouth bit the jewel on the Zhenren’s palm; winding and winding, it vaguely wandered for more than three hundred li, until dawn began to break.

The country folk rose early. The Zhenren descended from the clouds, and pointed to a girl washing clothes on the riverbank, saying, “Wicked beast, do you not see that river-side maiden? This maiden is of marriageable age, and is here a filial daughter. I now place you within her womb, so that she may conceive through sympathy, and be reborn in the manner of the Jade Maiden who incarnated the Patriarch. First, this will not soil your dharma body; second, it will show that your origin is different from all others. Consider this the fortunate time of your diligent cultivation, and I shall again ordain you from this degree. Go well!” Saying this, he raised the dragon pearl and cast it towards the girl. Suddenly, in mid-air there was a clap of thunder, a flash of golden light shooting straight into the girl’s mouth. The girl was greatly alarmed, and gave a cry, fainting by the riverside.

The Zhenren approached her side, and whispered in her ear, “Hu Xiuchun, listen well: in consideration of your pure filial piety, I deliver this divine dragon as your daughter. Nourish it well, and in future it will bring you benefit.” Xiuchun heard the order in her daze, nodded and awoke. Upon waking, the sun shone bright before her eyes; many villagers assembled by the riverbank, all discussing the strange thunderclap. Seeing Xiugu holding her clothes and sitting dazed, they hurried to ask, “Did you hear the thunder?” Xiuchun was full of confusion, and could not reply. The people seeing her altered expression said, “Unusual indeed! Surely this thunder startled her! Let us take her home quickly!” Several women came forward to support and guide Xiuchun, pulling and tugging, and sent her back home.

Her father, old Hu, and her mother, Madam Shen, were just discussing going to the river to look for her, having heard the sudden thunder and fearing she had been frightened. Now seeing her brought back, they were both alarmed and perplexed. When Xiuchun arrived at her door, her senses returned. Fearing to alarm her parents, she feigned composure, and thanked the people. She told her parents, “Just now, the thunder clapped once, as if ten thousand strands of golden light rushed into my womb; I was so frightened I fainted. Thanks to my sisters who brought me home, I have now calmed. Father and mother, do not worry.” The old couple, seeing she spoke well and was as usual, laid down their burden of anxiety. They invited the villagers inside, and offered seats and tea. The people again discoursed on the strange thunder, saying such portents always foretell something, and then departed.

Yet Xiuchun dared not reveal the words of the immortal to her parents, but from that day onward, she often felt trembling within her belly, as if something were placed inside. Her heart was troubled, and she thought the immortal’s words surely were true. “My father and mother long for a child; therefore I vow not to marry, and to be a daughter instead of a son. This is but to comfort the family.” Yet how can a daughter continue the family line? If at life’s end my parents’ bloodline dies with me, it is not proper. According to the immortal’s words, perhaps without marriage one could conceive. This time is unfortunate; though the child is a girl, when she grows and marries a good son-in-law, the family line will continue, and the ancestors’ bloodline not be cut off. Is this not a matter of twofold benefit? Only others do not know the truth, and I cannot explain it to them. When the child is born, the neighbors will gossip much, and then my many words will fail to persuade. How shameful that will be!” So she pondered daily, nearly breaking her tender heart to bits.

Five or six months passed; her belly grew large day by day. Xiuchun was distressed and at a loss, caught between going and staying. Already her worry had become illness: she would not eat, her face was yellow and thin, limbs weak; the symptoms were much like those of a pregnant woman. The old couple began to suspect something, but as Xiuchun worked at home by day and slept with her mother at night, there could be no scandal. The couple suspected she had some swelling disease; Madam Shen often privately questioned her, but Xiuchun only said the trouble had begun since the thunderclap, and dared not mention the immortal’s words. When the tenth month was full and her belly was distended, all concluded it was a joyous sign. Except for her parents who believed her innocent, the neighbors’ talk was unkind. Xiuchun heard these and was so ashamed she would not cross her own doorstep.

As the time of delivery approached, Xiuchun knew she could no longer conceal the matter, and at last told Madam Shen all the immortal’s instructions in detail. Madam Shen was both astonished and delighted, and hastened to inform old Hu. Old Hu was a scholar and knew the tale of the Patriarch being born from the Jade Maiden; he nodded saying, “Strange things abound in the world. If what Xiuchun says is true, this child is indeed someone of great root; the Jade Maiden’s birth was from the side; if my child is likewise, where shall we find such a midwife?” Madam Shen also rejoiced, “If the birth is from an immortal, surely an immortal will attend; what fear is there? But my daughter is young and shy, bearing a child without a husband is rare. No matter how you tell it, who will believe us? How shall Xiuchun face the world?” Old Hu replied, “There is no remedy for this. We may as well first explain the matter to those who know us. Our family has enemies with no proof; they cannot damage Xiuchun’s reputation.” Madam Shen agreed. So the old couple confided the matter to others. Within a few days, it spread throughout the village. Some believed, some not. As it did not concern them, no one took pains to investigate. Even those who doubted Xiuchun dared not name a lover, and refrained from gross slander. Yet in their hearts was always this suspicion.

On the day Xiuchun was to give birth, the common labour pain is felt as something descending; yet for Xiuchun the pain was upwards, as if something pressing from her belly towards her chest. Old Hu and Madam Shen summoned some experienced old midwives of the village, asking about this upward pressing. The midwives could give no explanation, only saying, “The young lady bears an immortal fetus; perhaps it is different from ordinary.” Old Hu was sensible enough to think that if the midwife did not understand the reason for this strange birth, she was unfit to deliver. If the birth truly came from the side, where should they find so large a hole?

He told Madam Shen, who grew more anxious. Xiuchun’s pains increased from morning to noon, the pressure rising beyond her chest unceasingly. She suffered greatly, gnashing her teeth, her eyes dimming, almost fainting. The old couple prayed earnestly, setting fragrant incense to heaven, sincerely beseeching the immortal who had sent the child to hasten to save her life. As the tumult grew, suddenly there was a knocking outside, and a voice cried out, “Specialist in difficult births, collector of strange fetuses.” Old Hu rejoiced, “My daughter suffers a strange fetus; this person claims to collect such — is this not a wonder! Surely my daughter’s filial heart has struck heaven, and heaven sends an immortal to save her!” Madam Shen hurried to see; it was a lame and dark-skinned old Daoist nun, knocking and calling, already some tens of steps away. Madam Shen ran after her, pleading, “Immortal aunt, save my daughter’s life!” The Daoist nun asked, “Is it a usual difficult birth, or a strange fetus? If the birth is usual, such as breech or lotus birth, or something unclean, I am an outsider and will not undertake it; if a strange fetus, I can assist!” Madam Shen said hastily, “It is a strange fetus! Very strange and unusual! Master, come quickly; if delayed, she will die!” The nun laughed, “Whether boy or girl, when the melon is ripe the stem falls off; why be in such haste? Very well, today I just came from downriver, and have not yet done a delivery; it is chance to meet your strange fetus. We are fated. I will go with you.” So she hobbled back. Madam Shen feared she could not walk far; she intended to support her, but though the nun’s pace was slow, Madam Shen could not keep up, always several steps behind. Reaching the door, the nun, without direction, strode proudly inside. Madam Shen followed, realizing the nun was indeed an extraordinary person. About to tell her of Xiuchun’s long pain, she was not much liked, and said only, “Let me see your daughter!” Madam Shen led her into the room, and just at the door heard Xiuchun cry out, “The pain is killing me!” Hearing this, Madam Shen’s heart broke; she neglected the nun and rushed in, holding Xiuchun to see: her eyes were turned up, legs stiffened straight, a faint spirit already slipping from the body. Madam Shen could not but weep and wail, crying, “Xiuchun, my child, how could you leave us! Ah, my child, you died so miserably!” As she wailed, old Hu and several relatives and neighbors entered, crowding forward and pushing the nun behind, preventing her approach. Old Hu grieved, but suddenly saw the nun only coldly smiling at Xiuchun’s corpse.

Old Hu angrily said, “You nun have no heart; they have lost a loved one and mourn, and you mock here; have you any kindness?” The nun coldly laughed, “You called me here but asked nothing, leaving me neglected, while you bawl over your dead; is not this laughable?” Old Hu said nothing. Madam Shen suddenly realized, threw down Xiuchun, parted the crowd, and knelt straight before the nun, bowing and crying without word. Old Hu seeing this also came forward to entreat. The nun laughed, “Rise, rise, no need for ceremony! Since I have come here, as I said, I am fated with the young lady. Now her life hangs but a moment, how could I stand aside?” She ordered a bowl of pure water, and sprinkled it upon Xiuchun’s corpse, saying, “Come, stubborn dragon, why delay your birth?” Before the word was done, Xiuchun’s eyes moved, mouth opened, hands and feet stirred. Old Hu and wife cried, “Our daughter is saved!” All present called this a marvel. But Xiuchun sat up, and with a retch spat out a fleshy ball, which fell to the ground, its sound clear and ringing as of gold. At first the ball was about the size of a pellet; the nun then sprayed a mouthful of water on it, swelling it tenfold. As they marveled, there came a tremendous crash like heaven and earth breaking. In an instant the ball burst into two, and out leapt a girl with red lips, white teeth, and delicate features, holding in her mouth a tiny pearl like a mustard seed, shining with radiance. The nun hastened forward, took the pearl, placed it in her own mouth, and swallowing it, threw back her head. Old Hu and wife and all looked on in amazement. Amidst the commotion, the woman on the bed called out loudly, “I am hungry; bring me food quickly!”

Madam Shen was overjoyed, nearly forgetting Xiuchun. Hearing this, she went forward to ask, “Do you feel any discomfort?” Xiuchun shook her head, “Not at all; only I am very hungry. Mother, bring me food quickly.” Madam Shen said, “After birth you are weak; how can you eat now?” Xiuchun answered nothing. The nun called, “No matter! No matter! When hungry one must eat to be full. Not only the young lady, but I myself also crave a drink of celebratory wine.” Madam Shen, hearing the nun, was reassured. She sent for food and began to prepare to care for the split fleshy ball. The nun stopped her, “You must not touch this; let me find a place to keep it!” She looked to the rice tub beside the bed, ordered the rice emptied, then took up the two halves of the ball, clasped them in her hands, and it again became a round object, the seam perfect, no trace visible. From her mouth she spat out a golden needle three inches long, pierced the ball seven times, making seven holes, then threw it into the wooden tub, smiling, “This will be of great use in the future. Whatever is needed, the child can take it immediately; it must be well preserved.” Saying this, she watched Madam Shen wrap the child and lay it by Xiuchun’s pillow, then all went out to sit.

Old Hu asked, “Where is the nun’s temple? What is her dharma name?” The nun laughed, “Monks call oxen and horses, all from people. Originally, no name is needed. Whatever the benefactor calls me, that is my name. Whether fated or unfated, a stranger or a close friend, it matters not. As for where I live, there is no fixed place. If I had a fixed abode, I would be like you, taking refuge at home, not running about east and west.” Old Hu, seeing the profundity in her words, felt respect, and asked, “My daughter conceived without husband, the child from the mouth, and is oviparous; is this auspicious or not? Please explain.” The nun laughed, “I am not an immortal; how can I know such reasonings? But if the benefactor’s mind is long and sincere, and the young lady is a pure and filial daughter, how could heaven be so cruel as to send a bad thing to ruin your wealth and family?” Old Hu thanked her.

Soon Madam Shen invited help, set forth a table of vegetarian wine, asking the nun to partake freely. The nun was unceremonious, drinking and eating with great appetite; when done, she thanked all and hurried away. Old Hu and wife hurried to see her off. Once outside the door, she vanished, and no one knew whither she went. Madam Shen blamed her husband, “This nun surely was an immortal; why did you not keep her longer, so I could ask her more?” Old Hu laughed, “How could an immortal stay long in our house? You saw how, once she passed the door, she vanished at once. She was urgent to go. I think this child of ours, though a daughter, has true destiny, stronger even than boys. Hence the strange origin. With the immortal attending the birth, we must heed her instructions and raise the child well, then blessings will be boundless. Why entangle with the immortal?” Madam Shen said no more.

The old couple and Xiuchun cherished the child as a pearl in the palm. The child was remarkable; one month after birth she could speak. Old Hu named her “Flying Dragon”, and personally taught her to read and write. Before ten years old, she had learned a chestful of knowledge. Old Hu, being old himself, sent her to a private school in the village to study under a master. There were seven or eight classmates, boys and girls about seven or eight years old; not only was she far superior in talent, but also in character and disposition, excelling in all respects. Envy arose in their hearts. Moreover, the master praised Flying Dragon’s morals and learning as far beyond others, increasing their jealousy. They often conspired to bully Flying Dragon. She, adhering firmly to her mother’s teachings, focused on her studies, and in other matters bore with others. Thus for several years all was peaceful.

One day, as was fated, Flying Dragon had finished her lessons and sat quietly at her desk, waiting for the master to dismiss class. Suddenly a classmate, not understanding a question, begged her to help with a few lines. Flying Dragon, fearing the master’s knowledge, dared not consent. The student, seeing her weakness, first insulted Flying Dragon herself; when Flying Dragon kept silent, he openly insulted her mother Xiuchun, saying Flying Dragon had a mother but no father, that her mother was unmarried and pregnant, manifestly an illegitimate child, unworthy to attend the school! Flying Dragon was a most filial and respectful person; how could she allow her own affairs to bring shame to her mother? Though she made no reply then, at dismissal she wept and told the master she could not continue her studies. The master was astonished and asked why. Flying Dragon remained silent.

At home, before grandparents and mother, she said no word, but wept bitterly. The old couple feared and doubted, and asked, “Child, who has wronged you? Tell us! We will surely avenge you.” Flying Dragon shook her head, “You need not doubt; this is a matter not to speak of. Even if your granddaughter died, she would not say. But from now on, I will go no more to that school.” Old Hu, unable to extract the truth, was perplexed. Just then the master came and inquired. They were all as in a fog. Since Flying Dragon resolved no longer to attend, they allowed it for the time. Months later, the story leaked from classmates, telling what had happened. The classmate who defamed Flying Dragon, seeing her absent, slandered more, saying Xiuchun had an affair, inventing names of Zhang San and Li Si as her lovers, claiming Flying Dragon was their child. Because of the leak, mother and daughter were ashamed to face people, so she ceased to attend school. Such idle talk gained some believers. Soon it reached old Hu and wife. Madam Shen told Xiuchun, who silently wept.

What followed is unknown; we look to the next chapter for resolution.
