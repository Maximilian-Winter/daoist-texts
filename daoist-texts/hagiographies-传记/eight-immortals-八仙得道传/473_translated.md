# Chapter 5: The Dragon's Sojourn at Qiantang River, Relating Ancient Traces; The Disciples of the Eastern Sea Seek their Master

It is said that the Fire Dragon Perfected Man was the foremost disciple of the Venerable Lord Lao, one among the highest of the Great Luo Golden Immortals in the upper realms. On this occasion he came solely to propagate teachings and to redeem old karmic ties among dragons. Therefore, unlike the previous descents to the world, wherein he came alone and single, sometimes revealing his true form, sometimes taking on human shape, coming and going at leisure without leaving a trace, this time he brought attendants—immortal officers summoned lions, elephants, tigers, and leopards, and local mountain gods and earth spirits were appointed as guards. The household’s kitchen god and gate gods served as messengers. Truly the scene was solemn and majestic; the divine countenances dignified and earnest. At first he made clear the origins of the flying dragon; then at midnight, the hour of the rat, he began to impart many Taoist arts to the flying dragon, commanding her to seek vengeance, allowing only harm to the body but forbidding the taking of life.

When the affairs were accomplished, he went to the Eastern Sea to practice immortal arts, awaiting the arrival of the old dragon from the west, that together they might respond to the summons of Heaven. The Perfected Man tarried until the fifth watch was ended, then stepped lightly upon a lotus, ascending amid drifting clouds and celestial music, attended by immortal officers and clerks, all proceeding together into mid-air. Behind them followed a great dragon, baring fangs and brandishing claws, shaking its tail and tossing its head, closely trailing as if in respectful escort. Until the Perfected Man’s divine carriage vanished and the clouds dispersed, did the dragon then return to the Hu household. This was the original form manifested by Hu Flying Dragon. Since swallowing her own elixir, Flying Dragon had not only become exceedingly strong, but could transform at will between dragon and human, as immortal or as deity. From this occasion onward, having escorted the Perfected Man, she appeared several times in her original form, so that the local folk were accustomed to and well acquainted with it, all knowing it to be the true form of the Hu family’s daughter. Therefore, at the place where the Hu family resided, the name Dragon Sojourn (Longyou) was given. To this day it is called Longyou County, this being the origin of the name.

Having received the immortal arts from the Perfected Man, Flying Dragon, originally endowed with excellent roots and supreme intelligence, had already comprehended all the teachings, and memorized clearly every incantation and formula. After the Perfected Man departed, fearing forgetfulness with the passage of time, she quietly recited them for several days at home, confident she would not forget. Then she prepared to attend to unfinished worldly matters. First was the matter of her birth mother, who, owing to the insult of a frivolous schoolmate, had taken her own life to make a statement. This grievance must be avenged; since the immortal had permitted injury to the body, this matter could be handled first. Know then that by this time Flying Dragon was no longer the weak child of three days before. Not to speak of the few martial men guarding the gate, even if ten thousand troops were summoned, they would be beneath her notice. Yet she would not commit deeds to terrify the world; still in the form of a child, she went to that household to demand redress. Two armed men were struck by her in three punches and two kicks, their noses crushed and mouths awry, unable to rise. As she prepared to break in further, many household members came forward, variously bearing sticks, knives, and spears, surrounding Flying Dragon at the core.

Flying Dragon laughed aloud. She saw her schoolmate following timidly behind a Taoist, shrinking and shivering. Recently they had learned of the Hu family’s descent of an immortal, greatly feared that Flying Dragon might learn the arts and come seeking him, a matter beyond mere strength to resist. So they had engaged a friend to hire a Taoist within the city. This Taoist was said to be a carefree wandering immortal, calling himself the Unfoolish Taoist. Many common folk, seeing his strange manifestations, worshipped him devoutly and called him a Great Immortal. This Great Immortal accepted the employment, reasoning that the Hu family were but ordinary folk, unable to summon a heavenly immortal. He did not believe the Hu child truly to be the incarnation of a true dragon, but rather some demon or sprite masquerading as an immortal to deceive the rustic populace. Therefore he came without hesitation to exorcise demons and banish spirits. When Flying Dragon felled the two guards, he arrived just then. The whole household was delighted and invited him to come first to see whether this Flying Dragon was indeed the true incarnation of a dragon. The Taoist willingly consented and led Flying Dragon’s schoolmate into the front hall. There they saw a finely featured, gentle and refined girl, displaying her prowess and commanding presence, her bare fists driving the family into desperation, crying aloud in pain and distress. The Taoist frowned somewhat upon seeing her, gauging that she had some skill. He thought to strike first, muttering incantations and shouting sharply. Suddenly in midair appeared a bolt of swift thunder, and seven or eight little dragons darted directly at Flying Dragon. Having never fought before or used any Taoist arts, and caught unawares by the Taoist’s treacherous assault, Flying Dragon was indeed unprepared. She could not employ even the escape arts taught by her master in time, and was felled by the seven or eight little dragons. The Taoist rejoiced, then brought forth a pellet from his hand, shouting: “Treasure, strike her head!” As the words ended, a black light flew straight at Flying Dragon’s head. Too slow to speak, and yet swifter than thought! Though Flying Dragon fell to the ground, her mind remained clear. Seeing the black light approach, her heart quickened, and suddenly the elixir within leapt forth, a dragon’s elixir pouring from her mouth straight upward.

At once the sky darkened and the earth grew black; thunder roared and wind howled. In the darkness appeared ten thousand rays of golden light, dazzling to the eyes. The truth was that her true form had been drawn forth by the dragon elixir, so that wind and thunder arrived, and heaven and earth darkened. Those dazzling golden lights were the shining scales on her body. Her true form appeared; not only did a small black cloud dissolve into a wisp of blue smoke, but even the seven or eight little dragons were terrified and revealed their true natures: they were but rotten grass ropes. At this moment Flying Dragon’s heart was fully clear, and her countenance even more composed. Seeing those ropes of grass, she laughed until her dragon body trembled, thinking to herself: “The Taoists have their chiefs, and the dragons their patriarchs; yet they do not reckon that rotten grass ropes have disciples and descendants as well. He brings these things to frighten me, a humble dragon; truly he knows not his measure!” Little did she know that this laughter and trembling would bring about a great calamity.

Her spiritual body was originally vast in size; though her divine powers could expand or contract it, her unfamiliarity with the arts caused her in haste to display her entire dragon form. Even if the house were larger, it would not suffice for her to make a single movement. Fortunately she was in an open courtyard and could leap most of her body upward without much harm. Yet when she laughed and her whole body trembled and danced, disaster ensued. With a crash and rattle, dozens of cottages were smashed flat; as she withdrew her tail with a roar and rumble, a hundred or so houses of her enemy’s family were likewise reduced to rubble. Trees in front and behind the houses, within and without the village, were also shaken down in great numbers. As for the people crushed under the collapsed houses, one may well imagine: a great throng was pressed as if into meat paste, losing all form. Flying Dragon then realized she had caused a great calamity. Hastily she withdrew the dragon elixir and changed back to her child form. Looking back to the ground, she saw it was wet and damp. Without knowing when, it had become a vast pool of water, flowing slowly eastward.

Flying Dragon promptly leaped into the air and employed divine sight to survey all around, and found that the water had flowed into the Qiantang River, forming a small river bay. Later the local folk called this place the Noisy Dragon Harbor.

At that time Flying Dragon had no leisure to consider these things further, and hurriedly left the pool, returning to her own home. Her spirit was restless, her heart shaken, and reflecting she suddenly knelt before her mother’s coffin and wailed bitterly. She thought that meeting the immortal master might bring hope, but who would have known that a small moment’s neglect would bring such great calamity and involve many innocent people? Her master was a Great Luo Golden Immortal, capable of foreseeing all things; if he came to punish her, how could she bear it? After weeping, she turned her thoughts to this: the enemy had been avenged, the calamity incurred, and the punishment fixed. Repenting and lamenting was useless. The second great matter was her mother’s burial. This calamity was all because of her mother. Could she bear to let her mother’s coffin remain here forever, bringing disaster upon herself? Who would then bury her? Thinking thus, she sighed: “The life of the unfortunate is hard to remedy. Since affairs stand thus, I will not meddle with them further. Let me bury my mother properly, then follow my master’s command to go to the Eastern Sea and await judgment.” So she knelt again before the coffin, weeping and worshipping. She did not trouble others, but made incantations to summon many heavenly soldiers and spirits, who bore the coffin to a lofty mountain. Since she must go to the Eastern Sea, she laid the coffin facing east. She further requested the help of the local earth spirits, and within less than an hour a very high tomb was raised. From elsewhere were brought a hundred or so pine and cypress branches, surrounding the tomb densely, the terrain being most flourishing. To this day there is a lofty ridge northwest of Longyou, called Feilong (Flying Dragon), named for the burial place of Xiuchun.

Again, Flying Dragon’s thoughts turned to the great matter at hand; resolved to obey her master’s command and go to the Eastern Sea, yet mindful of the great calamity she had caused. Though it was unintentional, recalling that since attaining the Tao from the basket weaver, through two lives, she had never caused such a calamity, such loss of lives. As she pondered the dangers ahead, she could not but bid a temporary farewell to her mother’s grave, her heart full of sorrow. Suddenly she thought that the Eastern Sea was but a few hundred li away, and recalling the earth-walking arts taught by her master, she resolved that thereafter, when assuming dragon form, she would not traverse the air at will, lest calamities befall fields and houses, inviting heavenly punishment. Rather she would travel beneath the earth to the sea, opening a subterranean channel behind her path, so that when people wished to pay respects to the tomb, they might come and go through the earth, unknown to man or ghost, without startling the world or bringing harm to herself or others. Was this not a wonderful thing? Thinking thus, she was greatly pleased and tried to penetrate the earth. Yet then she reconsidered—she knew the water’s domain well, but the earth was under the care of various local spirits. To invade their territory without prior communication might cause further trouble. She therefore formed seals and chanted incantations to summon the mountain earth spirits and informed them of her intent. The spirits looked at each other, all seeming to find difficulty.

Flying Dragon angrily said: “I but open a single path, and hinder nothing; how can you be so heartless?” The earth spirits, seeing her anger, hastened to say: “Great Deity, do not misunderstand us. It is because each place and region differs in the thickness of its air, the strength of its essences, the fertility or barrenness of its soil, the looseness or hardness of its substance—all as decreed by Heaven. The fortunate receive good land, the unfortunate only inferior soil. How can the Great Deity pierce through the earth and blend the good and bad lands into one? Afterwards there would be no means to distinguish high from low. This would not only be unfortunate but would also disorder the rewards and punishments, good and evil, calamities and blessings of the world, contravening Heaven’s impartial justice and the principle of retribution. If later questioned, we lowly spirits, charged with small offices, how could we bear the blame?” Flying Dragon listened and knew their words were reasonable and true. Yet she was eager to reach her mother’s tomb. Having devised this plan, she thought it perfect and without flaw, and could think of no better method. After hesitation she said to the spirits: “What you say is true, but as I consider it, the good receive blessings and the wicked suffer misfortune; that is the principle of retribution and cannot be overturned by my meddling. Even if the earth veins were connected by my divine body, there would be hidden springs, making it easier for the people to draw water. Would not this count as making merit to offset sin? My mind is fixed. If you can assist, let us all exert some effort and help. If not, I shall proceed alone. I think in less than a day the path will be open to the sea.” The earth spirits again sought to dissuade her.

Flying Dragon would not heed them, waving them aside and striving with all her might to pierce the earth. Indeed, divine arts are no common things. She assumed a form neither great nor small, and entering the earth from the hilltop where her mother’s grave lay, proceeded chanting seals as she advanced. At first downward from the height, then west to east, in truth in less than a day she had opened a subterranean channel reaching the Eastern Ocean. Flying Dragon was overjoyed, and thenceforth concealed herself in the Eastern Sea to cultivate talismans and incantations. Whenever she thought of her deceased mother, she would enter by the sea’s mouth, and along the channel she had opened, in no time reach the tomb. Later generations called this channel the Dragon Vein, as it had been opened by Flying Dragon. Though the channel was still sealed by the Perfected Man Xu, the story was passed down and became a classic. In the present day, those who study geomancy often speak of dragon veins and dragon heads, deriving from this event. But in truth, the facts do not correspond; it is but a fanciful tale.

Returning to Flying Dragon concealed in the Eastern Sea, cultivating and awaiting judgment, more than ten years passed without the arrival of her master or any word of punishment. Her heart was half anxious, half glad. Since entering the sea, steadfast to the Fire Dragon Perfected Man’s instructions, she devoted herself to practice and did not meddle in external affairs. The sea was home to many sentient animals and spirits; some envied her and sought in secret to harm her, but owing to their inferior skill, several were overturned by Flying Dragon. Some were sincere admirers who wished to become her disciples and learn the Tao, but Flying Dragon always said her own arts were not high, and without her master’s permission dared not accept followers. Thus the people knew her to be difficult to approach and did not dare to pester her. Flying Dragon lived quietly, at peace in spirit, refining her profound arts. Because she was so devoted and diligent, her progress was swift. In just over ten years, having practiced thoroughly the great Tao and various arts given by the Fire Dragon Perfected Man, she became flawless in skill. At this time her powers were such that only the golden immortals of Heaven might contest with her. As for the earth immortals, wandering immortals, demons, and ghosts of various places and mountains, the highest could at best keep pace with her. She also forged two long dragon whiskers into twin precious swords, usually hidden within her nostrils, which could lengthen or shorten at will, taking human or demon life from thousands of li away. She further tempered the dragon elixir with the Samadhi True Fire, able to emit fire and absorb water, swallow mist and raise clouds, and seize the treasures of others. Crystalline light and wondrous jewels, whatever rare and precious things, were drawn to her as iron to a magnet. Proud of her two treasures, she remembered her master’s words that her senior uncle, the Perfected Man Piaomiao, also taught the old dragon in the west. That dragon was male, and according to her master, she and he were like husband and wife; upon meeting, who would be superior or inferior was uncertain. Having cultivated Tao and forged precious treasures, she trusted she would not disgrace her master. Yet she wondered why her master had not yet come. Had he known she disobeyed orders and caused calamity, and therefore rejected her? If so, then no matter how many centuries of toil she gave, she would not enter the ranks of immortals nor receive imperial command. She would have wasted her efforts while the western old dragon boasted before the heavens, proud for a time. How shameful, how mortifying! Such thoughts troubled her for some time, and she grew greatly anxious again. She thought to take a human form and go to her master’s cave to inquire, but as her master had not summoned her, if she went and he came, would not he be angry?

Flying Dragon pondered, helpless. On a sullen day, she suddenly thought: why not take the form of a Taoist maiden and walk on shore? Perhaps she might learn news of her master and the western old dragon, better than being mired in the sea with no prospect of release. Having resolved upon this, she leapt ashore and became a youthful Taoist maiden, carrying a whisk and a precious sword on her shoulder, swaying as she walked into a bustling market place. She saw the throng of people as merchants and country farmers buying and selling goods. Flying Dragon, having been accustomed to Dragon Sojourn, paid little heed. Without noticing, she came to the outskirts. It was the late spring season; the mountain flowers blazed red as fire, set against soft green grass and verdant pines and cypresses. The scenery was truly delightful.

Flying Dragon ascended the mountain and sat upon a great rock, admiring the natural scene for a while. Suddenly she saw two travelers below, one old and one young, walking one before the other, their attire seeming otherworldly. Flying Dragon could not help but fix her gaze. Her ears and eyes, having been refined to great acuity, soon clearly discerned that the old and young Taoists shone with divine light and moved with grace, not ordinary worldly ways. She was filled with astonishment. After a while, she heard the old Taoist command: “Disciple, you have already reached Huaicheng; wait there for me. I will go to meet your senior uncle and then come to find you. Your temper is not good; you must endure all things and not display your rude and violent nature. Should you cause another great calamity, I shall have no face left to plead for you. Moreover, the more calamities you cause, the deeper the tribulations; in future repeated trials, it is yourself who suffers, and no one else can help you. Do you understand?” The young one showed a very humble demeanor, saying: “Master, rest assured and go; I shall no longer cause trouble.” The old Taoist then smiled. Flying Dragon wished to see where he went, but in the blink of an eye, only the young Taoist remained; the old Taoist’s figure was gone. Flying Dragon was greatly astonished and said: “This old Taoist’s mastery of the Way is no less than my master’s. Having met him by fate, I must go up and make acquaintance; perhaps they know news of my master.” Thinking thus, she hastened and used the shrinking earth method, and in three steps was before the young Taoist. The young Taoist, seeing her thus, was not surprised but asked: “Whence come you, that I have not seen you before?” Flying Dragon smiled and said: “What is there to marvel at? Just now I saw your master, truly a person of great Taoist skill. I greatly admire him and came specially to inquire, and also to ask your noble name and from which place you come.” Having thus spoken courteously, she thought surely the young Taoist would agree to befriend her. Yet he did not answer, only scanning her up and down without ceasing. This made Flying Dragon laugh and inadvertently say: “You, little sir, it seems you seldom go out to make friends, and so do not understand the ways of social intercourse.”

These words greatly angered the young Taoist, who shouted: “From where do you come, little demon sprite! Have you no regard for my age, which is ten, nay a hundred times greater than your great-grandmother and ancestors? How dare you call me little sir! I have upheld my master’s precepts and endured much, not wishing to quarrel with you, yet you hazard your life and insult me face to face! Let us see which of us is right and which is wrong!” Flying Dragon laughed aloud until she fell over.

What caused such laughter? This will be explained in the next chapter.
