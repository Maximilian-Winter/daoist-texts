# Chapter 10: The Widower Amazed by a Beauty, The Field-Snail Repays Kindness

Now it happened that Sun Jie beheld such a fair woman, who, without any cause, every day cooked his meals and brewed his tea; in his heart he was exceedingly amazed. Standing upon the ladder, he could not help but utter an exclamation, "Eh!" This cry, though slight, was quickly perceived by the lady within the chamber; she was instantly startled, and forthwith vanished as if a shadow. Sun Jie descended from the ladder, opened the door, and entered the room. There was a pot of rice, yet it was half uncooked. The day before, he had seen that there was only enough rice in the house to last three or four days; but now, suddenly, the rice tub was found full to the brim with white rice. Moreover, there were added some salted meats, chicken, and fish, all placed together within the cupboard. Sun Jie had no choice but to cook the rice thoroughly and eat until he was full.

As both victuals and rice were in abundance, he asked leave from his master for two days, remaining indoors without going abroad, ever awaiting the coming of the fair lady.

Yet, the lady, knowing that he no longer went to work, ceased to prepare his evening meals; only in the early morning, when he lay in deep slumber, did she prepare a meal for him, bringing with it many fresh small dishes, cooked most deliciously. Sun Jie several times arose early, waiting for the lady; but these days, he still saw her not. Yet one matter gave him even greater joy: the lady, knowing he no longer laboured, fearing he might lack money, had procured for him a great store of silver, enough to suffice for many years.

Sun Jie was exceedingly overjoyed, and resolved to open a small shop, that he might be free from the life of a hired servant. Having fixed his purpose, he went to resign from his master’s house. The master, an old man of more than sixty years, with a kind heart, asked him the cause of his leaving. Sun Jie, a man of honest simplicity, could not lie, and so told the true story. The master said: "What you have encountered is perhaps some celestial being; surely you have performed some good deed, saved her life, and she has come to repay you." Sun Jie replied: "I am a poor man, almost dead for want; how could I have done any good deed!" The master laughed and said: "Good deeds do not require wealth. If you cannot remember, then do not trouble yourself. But the beings above, the immortals, may not be the benefactors; perhaps it is the spirit of flowers, trees, birds, or beasts, whom you once saved and who now comes to repay kindness. If that be so, you should prepare a piece of hard burnt dough, roll it into a small ball, and when she next comes, suddenly embrace her and force the dough into her mouth, forcing her to swallow it. Then she will be like a mortal, and you may question her, marry her, and the benefits will be without limit."

Sun Jie took the lesson to heart, and so waited the whole night, feigning sleep until dawn. At daybreak, he stealthily entered the kitchen, and beheld the lady standing with her back turned, cutting vegetables. Sun Jie, following the master's instructions, suddenly approached and embraced her strongly, while with his right hand he thrust the prepared dough into her mouth. When she gave a sudden gulp, swallowing it down, he was about to let go, when he heard her speak: "My lord, pray release me; I have received the fire of cooking, and can no longer flee. Allow me to slowly explain myself to you." Sun Jie knew that she did not speak falsely, and so released his hold. The lady turned her face towards him, full of shame and blushes, and respectfully saluted Sun Jie. Sun Jie bowed in return, feeling somewhat embarrassed, and so began to speak: "Pray, lady, we are strangers; I am but a poor man, and have no benefit to offer you, why then such mistaken love? My heart is truly disturbed. Now, lucky to see your noble presence, I beseech you to clearly reveal the matter." The lady smiled and said: "I have my bitter secret, and greatly wish not that you should know. I know not who has spoken to you so maliciously, teaching you such evil stratagems; but what you desire to know, and what I dare not tell, I fear that if you know not my affairs, you will question me bitterly; and if you know, you will fear me as a scorpion and dare not meet me. In the end, this will prevent me from repaying the great kindness, and perhaps even bring suspicion and fear upon you, turning good into evil. What then shall be done?"

Sun Jie heard her and responded earnestly: "Lady, you speak too gravely. I am but a poor countryman, yet I think myself to have some courage and loyalty. You treat me so, surely because at some time I have done you some slight service. I truly cannot recall it! If you will not speak, I will suspect you of misrecognising some other, and thus waste your efforts in vain, so that the true benefactor receives no return. My fate is poor, and I receive reward without merit; not only no benefit, but surely a shortening of my days. If a man born to live sixty years is reduced to less than fifty, it is doom. Lady, consider, dare I continue to accept your kindness?"

The lady, hearing this, smiled and said: "You always say you are honest and sincere; yet from your words I see you are also a playful friend. I will not conceal from you: in my heart I have long wished to explain to you, but because our paths are so different and obscure, I feared gossip, and feared your misunderstanding of my purpose, and so concealed it, hoping to serve you for years, that you might know that I am no harm to you, and then I could tell you all, that you might be enlightened. Unexpectedly, before a month had passed, you caught me. Are we truly bound by fate?"

Speaking these words, her face flushed a little. Sun Jie was delighted, his brows opening as if in spring, and he opened wide his mouth, unable to close it; then he spoke gravely: "Lady, do not be so suspicious. As I said before, though poor, I have courage and loyalty. Speak freely: even if you are a demon or sprite, since you say I have done some slight good, and you come to repay it, though I cannot claim such merit, I can be sure you do not come to harm me. I, Sun Jie, am no clod or wooden idol; can I not distinguish good intent from evil?"

The lady, hearing this, lowered her fair neck and hesitated a moment, then raised her head and smiled: "My lord, do you see me as man or ghost, or what demon or spirit, mountain demon or tree sprite?" Sun Jie, without hesitation, laughed and replied: "Lady, you are of heaven and earth; if not an immortal, then surely above mortals. As for those demons and sprites, they surely exist, but dare not assume your talent, nor have your mercy." The lady smiled and said: "My lord truly knows how to speak; others say you are not eloquent, which is strange!" Sun Jie laughed: "Perhaps that is what is called fortune coming to quick wit." The lady smiled again: "To tell you the truth, I am indeed not human; immortals are too lofty, I dare not pretend; demons are too fierce, I do not meddle with them. Lord, please recall: when your revered wife was alive, did you ever save any being’s life? And at her death, was there any regretful word? Think carefully, and guess; if you guess wrongly, I will tell you." Sun Jie thought for a while, and only remembered that Lady Liu had lamented her childlessness; as for saving a life, he could not recall.

The lady nodded and sighed: "Just so; this shows your noble family’s great virtue and benevolence, a true gentleman who bestows kindness without hope of return. My surname is Luo, my name Yuan, and I dwell by the Huai River. At a great flood, I was swept by the great waves to your house, and when the waters receded, I was unable to leave. Your revered lady cherished and nurtured me as if I were her own flesh and blood. Later, when your mother fell ill and was near death, I was almost lost too. Yet I was saved by your lady’s careful design, who found a place for me to hide, preserving my fragile life. Later, your virtuous couple sent me forth from the house, so that I might live on. This kindness I can never repay. Your lady was so virtuous, yet not long-lived. When I heard it, I resolved to repay your kindness. Being non-human, and ashamed to reveal myself, I first took the role of woman, gradually gaining your trust over years, intending later to reveal all. But, before a month passed, I was caught by you. Is this not great fortune? Now that events have reached this point, I hope you will not disdain me for being of another kind, but allow me to serve you, tending your household tasks. Though I am unworthy, I will not burden your life, nor cause you harm; please bear with my small devotion." 

Sun Jie, hearing her story, understood that she was the field snail he had set free. At first he was somewhat startled, but hearing her clear words, her gentle affection, and recalling her diligent care, his heart was full only of gratitude without doubt. Rising, he bowed his thanks, saying: "Lady of heaven and earth, need not be so formal. The past was all without intent, and counts for nothing. Now that you have such a heart, I will not speak further; only I fear my own poverty and coarseness, unworthy of your natural beauty. Though you say I need make no provision, I feel only shame and helplessness." Luo Yuan smiled: "Since you accept my love without suspicion, we are kin now, and need not be formal. But there is one thing I must ask." Sun Jie quickly replied: "We are husband and wife, one body; what should I not agree to?" Luo Yuan blushed and said: "It is nothing great; my spiritual attainment is shallow. Though I can change my form, I cannot yet cast off my earthly shell; in twenty years, having received much the fire of cooking and your vital blood, I will gradually discard this stubborn husk, and become truly human. At midnight tomorrow, come to the west river, bring my husk in your hands, place it in a large jar filled with clear water, change the water monthly, and keep it in a secret place. It must not be known by others; this is most important. Can you promise me this?"

Sun Jie laughed heartily: "Is this such a great matter? Now I understand, and will gladly do so." Luo Yuan laughed as well. That day, having done all she needed for Sun Jie, she returned home. At night, fearing lest he err, Sun Jie waited until midnight, then hastened to the river’s west shore, and found the large field snail he and Lady Liu had released, still at the shore. Joyfully he took it back and arranged everything as she had instructed, then went to sleep. At dawn he heard voices in the kitchen, and suspicious, he rose to see Luo Yuan had brought two young maidservants, busily directing them in making tea and water, cooking rice and dishes. Seeing Sun Jie rise, Luo Yuan first thanked him for his care, then bade the two maids pay respects, saying: "These two children are young, but capable." The two maids bowed together to Sun Jie, who was even more pleased.

From that time Luo Yuan dwelt constantly in Sun’s house, becoming his wife. Originally Sun Jie had nothing; now his fortunes grew. Not only were rice, firewood, and clothes sufficient, but all daily needs were comfortable beyond measure, more luxurious than many wealthy households. Sun Jie ceased to be a servant, and opened a rice and flour shop in the market. Management, planning, and transactions were all entrusted to Luo Yuan; often businesses which others had failed, under her hand prospered. Within two years, he became a wealthy man.

Sun Jie was by nature kind and generous, delighting to give, whether to known or unknown, helping all in urgent need. Thanks to Luo Yuan’s great powers, silver was continually brought in to aid the poor; without this, even his household fortune would have quickly vanished. At this time, near and far, towns and villages all knew of Sun Jie and his wife; they called him Sun the Good Man, and Luo Yuan the Living Guanyin. The couple lived very happily, save for one sorrow that troubled their hearts. Lady Liu, at her death, had cared much for Sun Jie’s bloodline; now Luo Yuan had repaid kindness and become his wife, promising to bear sons and carry on the incense of the family. Yet, after many years, this matter remained unresolved. More than ten years had passed with no news; Sun Jie was anxious and distressed, often furrowing his brows, sighing deeply, and saying to Luo: "I know I have no evil heart, helping those in need, yet I dare not claim merit; why then does Heaven deny me a son? What fault in my virtue has brought me to such an end?" Luo Yuan repeatedly comforted him, saying he was not old, his vigor not yet spent; that the birth of a son was but a destiny to be fulfilled in time. "Set your heart on goodness, and Heaven will surely bless you. How can it be that you will have no offspring?" Sun Jie, hearing this, could only hope from year to year, waiting on the morrow.

Surely, the way of Heaven does not err in its rewards; how could a man so benevolent as Sun Jie have no heir? The Old One of Fate had long prepared a fine son for him, and when the time came, celestial officers would escort him to his side. To the readers, you may ask: which son has Heaven prepared for Sun Jie? And what is the time appointed? The author is reluctant to reveal this now; we shall await the next chapter to explain.
