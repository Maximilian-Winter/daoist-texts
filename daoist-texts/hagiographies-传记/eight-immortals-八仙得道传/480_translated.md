# Chapter 12: Wenmei's Incarnation Drives Away the Demon; the Immortal Grants Entrance to the Imperial Garden

Now it happened that Master Ding took up a mirror to look upon himself, and beheld within the glass a black-faced, red-eyed figure. He never dreamed that it was his own illusory form, and forthwith exclaimed, “Ah! This demon spirit yet lurks within the mirror!” This one word made all the people burst into loud laughter. Yet Bo Gao, being a man of honest and kindly nature, fearing that he might lose face, hastened to check the servants, bidding them quickly fetch water to wash the Master's face. But who could have thought that the blackness was like raw lacquer, glued fast upon the skin, and could not be peeled off by any means. A sharp-mouthed servant standing by sneered coldly, saying, “This is the demon spirit attending upon Master Ding! Otherwise, when the Master suffers such disgrace, would not the white flesh beneath the skin show some red? Bo Gao hastened to command, ‘No nonsense. Go quickly to the lady of the house, take ten taels of silver, and send the Master home!’ Master Ding, indeed much troubled by this black face, took heart and hardened his countenance; when the silver was brought to hand, he staggered in thanks and departed.

This matter being thus delayed, Bo Gao saw that the Master could not subdue the demon, and his heart became yet more vexed; besides, he feared that others might learn of it and the news reach the ears of Sun Jie and his son, whereby he would lose face. Being sorely perplexed, one day as he returned from court and passed through a bustling market street, he saw a great crowd gathered about a certain Daoist, who was loudly talking and showing wonders. Bo Gao’s heart was stirred, and he bid the carriage halt, walking on foot he pressed into the throng and observed awhile. He found that this Daoist was adept at transforming living things and reversing the seasons. He planted a great peach seed in the earth; in a moment it took root, sent forth branches, blossomed, and bore fruit, producing many peaches. Though it was already early winter, these peaches appeared from nowhere, and one by one he plucked and distributed them to the spectators, all declaring them remarkably fresh and delicious.

He next took a sheaf of straw and planted it, causing it to blossom into an orchid, fragrant and elegant. Then, from a single leaf of vegetable, he caused a peony to bloom, rich and splendid. All these flowers and fruits were real, not some illusion to deceive the eyes. Bo Gao was entranced and gazed in wonder. When the Daoist had finished his marvels, the evening was drawing near, and the people cast silver coins to him at random. The Daoist smiled and with a wave of his hand caused the coins to rise from the ground and fall into his palm. He then addressed the crowd, saying, “Thanks to your kindness in bestowing so much silver, but alas, as a man of the cloth I have long renounced worldly ties, and these are of no use to me. I will therefore do some good, taking these coins to distribute among the poor.”

Then raising his eyes, he saw many ragged folk, with faces like crows and vultures. “You all are doubtless poor people; I will give each one a share.” The crowd wished to see how he would distribute, but when he finished speaking and prepared to depart without handing out a coin, all laughed, thinking him a liar.

The Daoist smiled and said, “Please all of you search your own purses.” The poor folk, hearing this, scrambled to their pockets and sure enough, each produced a silver coin. Everyone recognized that it was the very money given to the Daoist, but by some means he had caused it to return to each person.

Only then did all know this man was indeed an immortal descended to the world. Among these, Bo Gao paid the closest attention; when the Daoist departed, he closely followed him for three or four li. When they entered a lonely wilderness, the Daoist suddenly turned his head and smiled, saying, “Noble sir, it is no easy matter to follow afoot so far — I am sorry. Now the sky is dark; your carriage waits back there — why not return at once?”

Bo Gao, seeing this, hastened to bow and said, “Great Immortal, how is it that you know me? I have some small matters I dared not speak; that is why I followed your divine carriage, hoping to discern the immortal habitation and cave abode, and to pay my true respects in due time. I did not expect you had already discerned my actions and hiding-place; how could I dare conceal more? I humbly pray you to pause your flight and hear my account.”

The Daoist smiled, waving his hand, saying, “No need to speak; I know all. You have a demon recently come to your household, who makes mischief especially against your daughter, is it not so?” Bo Gao, amazed, bowed deeply and said, “Indeed, Immortal, your wisdom is far-reaching. May I ask, I have never done evil or deceived heaven and earth, nor offended the gods; how then has this demon come to be? What is this demon? Is there a way to subdue it? I beg Immortal to instruct me fully.” The Daoist laughed and said, “Has he not already confessed all to you? His statements are all true, no falsehoods. That creature is originally a flood-dragon spirit, but he pretends to be a divine dragon. Moreover, the Transcendent Piao-miao, by the command of Laozi the Ancestor, together with Erlang Shen, was charged with removing mountains and filling seas. With such virtue, how could he not know where the old dragon is imprisoned? How could he be so easily escaped? The truth is, this beast’s time of death is not yet come, and he ought not to be suppressed by the old dragon; thus he was allowed to escape. His tale of slinking away by surprise is all nonsense.”

Bo Gao, hearing this as though the Daoist had seen it with his own eyes, felt ever greater admiration, and involuntarily knelt down, striking his head to the ground, saying, “Truly the Immortal’s vision extends ten thousand li! This demon has thrown my family into disarray; since the Immortal knows all in such detail, surely there is affinity between you and my household. I beg you, Immortal, to take my cause in hand and expel this demon. My family will be eternally grateful; I also beseech you to grant me an immortal name, Xianxiang.”

The Daoist smiled and said, “You seem honest and sincere, yet you know how to speak with a playful tongue. How can you be sure I have affinity with you? Well, well! He who speaks of right and wrong is himself a man of right and wrong. Having said so much, perhaps this is the affinity you speak of. I cannot but see to your matter.” Bo Gao was greatly pleased and again asked the Immortal’s surname and place of residence. The Daoist laughed, saying, “The demon is so powerful, and knows my strengths and weaknesses. If I could not overcome him, why should I give my name and lose face?” Bo Gao hastily laughed, “Immortal is too modest; though I am but a fool, how could I not distinguish between right and wrong?” The Daoist declined to say more, so Bo Gao desisted.

The Daoist turned back and returned with Bo Gao to the place whence they had come. Most strange indeed; Bo Gao had thought they had walked three or four li, and much time had passed. Now, following the Daoist back, in the blink of an eye they were returned to the starting point. Knowing this to be the Immortal art of contracting the earth, he dared not ask further. The Daoist refused to be led, and seeing Bo Gao dismiss the coachman, the two linked hands and strode forward a few paces; thence to Bo Gao’s house was nearer and swifter, and in a moment they had arrived.

Bo Gao respectfully invited the Daoist to rest for a time in the study, and hurried in to inform the ladies of the house. The lady was alarmed and said, “My lord, this time be careful; do not again cause offense like Master Ding, or you will have trouble!” Bo Gao only replied, “This one is truly a genuine Immortal from Heaven; surely no mistake will be made!”

Before he had finished speaking, suddenly Huigu burst in fiercely, pointing at Bo Gao and the lady, and shouted a scolding, “Very well, you are good at making mischief. Just now you brought a certain Master of the Law, making my heart unhappy! Only when I pitied you and spared you; how dare you again be rude and bring forth some Immortal? I would see what sort of thing that Immortal is made of. What price would he fetch? How does his power compare with that Master Ding? Now let me test my skill on you!”

As she spoke, she breathed forth, and suddenly the room was filled with smoke and mist, so that no one could be seen across it. Bo Gao and his wife could hear her say, “You base wretches, each of you deserves to die in a great flood.” Before they could reply, water rose from the floor, from a few inches to a foot, two feet, three feet; in a moment it was knee-deep. Within the water were many fish-spirits and shrimp-monsters, hideous and grimacing, striving to seize men. Instantly the noise within and without was tumultuous, with fowls and dogs in confusion. Bo Gao and his wife sat upon the bed, helpless and awaiting death.

When all seemed most perilous, suddenly there came a sound like thunder rolling through the heavens. Where the thunder passed, the smoke vanished, and light doubled in brightness. Bo Gao opened his eyes and rejoiced, “The Immortal has saved us; my family is saved!” The lady saw as well a Daoist standing on the water’s surface, holding a whisk, his robe and shoes dry, as if standing on the ground. The Daoist muttered words and waved his hand; the waters instantly receded, going faster than they came, and the ugly demons vanished without trace. The Daoist smiled at Bo Gao and said, “The demon has fled; the young lady can be at ease. The demon’s hatred is chiefly for your son-in-law. He surely will go to the Sun family to wreak havoc. I cannot stay here; I must hasten to rescue him.” Bo Gao and wife knelt in gratitude. Suddenly a flash of golden light arose, and the Daoist’s form vanished. The couple were greatly amazed.

The Daoist took leave of Bo Gao and soared by cloud to Sun Jie’s house. Just as he was about to alight, seeing no demon aura, he knew the demon had not yet arrived. He thought, “If I descend like this, will I not first arouse suspicion?” So after pondering a moment, he looked up and saw in the east a large flower garden where a black vapour seemed to linger. Hastening thither, he saw a woman and an official sitting in discourse within a vacant courtyard at the garden’s eastern end. The Daoist’s clairvoyance revealed the woman to be the flood-dragon spirit, and the official to be Sun Xianci, a bat reincarnation. Yet he knew not what place this was, nor why Xianci was here. How could the demon know of Xianci’s presence and arrive before him to confront him?

Clever Daoist, he then transformed himself into a tiny ant and entered the midst of the house. He saw that Sun Xianci seemed bewitched, held in the arms of the demon, kissing and fondling him with loathsome contortions. The demon said, “Good brother, come with me to cultivate the Way! If we delay, your enemy will soon seek you out!” Xianci said nothing, only smiled foolishly. The demon looked about, seeing no one, and thought to carry off Xianci.

But though no humans were near, the ant suddenly leapt up and changed instantly into a Daoist form. Smiling, he blocked the way and said, “Slow! Slow! If you would go, let us go together. Such a fine place, how can you go alone? I will come along to play.” The demon, seeing the Daoist, dropped Xianci and fled at full speed. The Daoist did not pursue, but stood at the door and cried, “Hear me, flood demon! You are a being of some foundation; quickly turn back, the great Way awaits you. Should you persist in error, though I break not my precepts, others will deal with you! When thunder and lightning fall, repentance will be too late!” Having spoken, he saw the flood demon mounting black clouds and fleeing toward the Eastern Sea. Sun Xianci, now restored to his true nature, stood dazed inside, recalling the strange events, as if in dream or trance, uncertain what had happened.

In deep perplexity, he saw the Daoist enter. Prostrating himself, he said, “I was just now bewitched by some demon, my body no longer mine, my mind unclear. Perhaps the Immortal foresaw my trouble and came to save me? I humbly beg you to grant me an immortal name and explain what has passed. I am deeply grateful.” The Daoist sat down, sighed, and said, “No long time ago you failed to recognize even your own master — lost in worldly dust and desires, so pitiable and sad! Listen well. I am your former master Wenmei Zhenren. You are a little bat bird, now newly incarnate as man. Your root nature is unlike the common. Alas, your birth is lowly; though you may attain the Way in time, you must endure many hardships and dangers. As to this day’s encounter, it is the grudge of your past life, this and that affair. This demon should not die by my hand; his evil is not yet full, and the heavenly laws have not yet reached him; therefore he was allowed to escape. In future he may yet oppose you; you must early resolve your mind, see your true nature and illuminate your heart, so as not to be constrained by worldly affairs or enticed by externals. If in future there be urgent trouble, I will send help to rescue you; you need not fear before time, nor let it hinder your cultivation. My words are finished; now I must depart.”

Sun Xianci, receiving this instruction, understood his past life and that the one who had awakened and saved him was indeed his former master. He knelt, tears flowing, saying, “I owe my master heaven and earth’s great kindness; how dare I neglect my practice and fail my teachings? From now I will part from you, return home to farewell kin, resign office and withdraw to remote mountains and valleys to cultivate. I humbly pray you first impart the initial steps and secret formulas, so that I may advance daily and not go astray.” Wenmei Zhenren nodded, “You still have worldly ties unresolved; in a short time you will become a monk, but may not manage it easily. When the time comes, the pressure will compel you to go. For now no haste is needed; when you resolve your intention and courageously advance, it is highly commendable. I will now impart some methods and formulas; with diligent practice for three years, you can sever worldly ties, strengthen your sinews, and this will be of great benefit to your future cultivation.”

Sun Xianci rose and bowed again. The master imparted methods and formulas, saying, “We shall meet again; strive upward!” Then he transformed into golden light and vanished in an instant. Xianci bowed again and waited for the light to fade before rising. He did not yet know where he was, for no one had entered during that time; moreover, the house was exquisite and richly furnished, unlike an ordinary dwelling.

Just as he prepared to leave, he saw outside a vast garden. Deep in the woods, there were some red walls and yellow tiles, majestic and solemn palaces. Now Xianci understood that the demon had seized him to the imperial garden within the capital. Xianci was struck dumb with fright. At this time Yushun had long grown weary and yielded the throne to Xia Yu. Although Yu also came from the common people, he bore no thought of establishing a hereditary dynasty. Yet for an official to run about the imperial garden without reason was a matter of great scandal. If inquiry were made, Xianci, as a doctor, could not excuse having brought a demon there with a mere tale of disappearance. Now Xianci was truly at a loss, cursing his master for saving him from the demon’s hands but not taking him out of the garden. After much thought, he knew that remaining here was not a long-term plan; better to find a way out and slip away. If no one met him, the matter would be ended; if someone did appear, then he would deal with it in due time. Having resolved this, he dared not hesitate and set off at once.

Alas, though the garden was not very large, it covered tens of li in extent, with unclear directions and unknown paths.

After wandering long, he returned to the depths of the garden. Looking at the evening sky, the guards were all returning to their quarters and entering the garden. Xianci grew more anxious. Just then he saw ahead a woman beckoning to him from behind a rockery, and calling, “Doctor Sun, are you lost?” Xianci, seeing that she knew his surname and office, and that they were indeed in the imperial garden, did not know who this person was, nor if her intentions were kind or evil. He was at a loss whether to answer or not, and was accordingly much troubled.

What manner of person this woman was, will be told in the next chapter.
