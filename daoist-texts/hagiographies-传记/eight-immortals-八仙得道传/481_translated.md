# Chapter Thirteen: Testing the Heart of the Youth; The Third Sister of the Entire Filial Way Speaks Well

It is told that the maiden, upon seeing Xian Ci, was somewhat timid and shrinking, and dared not advance; yet she smiled, and stepped forward a few paces to meet him, saying, "Young sir, you are thus timid—do you take this weak woman for some tiger, wolf, or demon?" Xian Ci, beholding her gentle mien and fair countenance, judged that she was no evil person. So he also returned her smile and related his troubles, entreating her to point out a way of escape. The maiden smiled and said, "I too am not of this place; but the old man who tends the flowers and trees is my grandfather, and he often takes me into this garden to roam. I am well acquainted with the paths of ingress and egress therein. Seeing you pacing at this crossroad, your countenance full of hesitation, I know for certain you have lost your way and cannot find your way out. I once dwelt near your lordship; I see you every day going out of and coming into your mansion, so I know you well. Since we meet as acquaintances, how could I not give you some guidance? Yet you do not recognise me, but suspect me to be some villain with evil intent; is this not laughable?"

Xian Ci, hearing her thus speak, was struck with sudden understanding, and said, "So it is, lady, that you are indeed my neighbour. Forgive my poor eyesight, which failed to recognise you by face—how laughable and shameful! Now, I pray you point out a path by which I may early escape the garden and return home; I shall be forever grateful!" The maiden laughed, saying, "You are indeed a good man, hearing that I am an old neighbour, and so seek my counsel. Yet you did not ask my surname—whether I am named Zhang or Li. Your bearing as a noble official is not small, after all." Xian Ci was greatly abashed, hastening to smile and say, "Indeed so, I have not yet asked your honoured surname. In my haste, I forgot to inquire; truly, I have offended." The maiden nodded smilingly, "That is more like it. My surname is Hu; all call me Third Sister Hu. I have no other name. If you please, you may simply call me Third Sister."

Xian Ci heard this, and silently repeated "Third Sister Hu" in his heart, yet doubted, thinking that a good family lady would not be so shameless or unrestrained. He thought surely this woman was no good. Yet he said within himself, "Let it be so! In any case, I only seek her to point out a clear path, that I may pass this garden gate. Why waste thought on such matters?"

Just as he was about to speak, the maiden smiled again, saying, "Young sir, what thoughts do you turn? I have guessed your intent—that you are thinking me a woman straightforward and frank, free and easy, unlike the ladies of official families. But truly, sir, you are one unversed in the ways of the world. Few in the world are officials; besides official families, those who till the fields, labour, trade, and buy and sell, are not so refined in their observance of rites and decorum as you are. To speak plainly, I am not a lady of official family. Yet if I were to be as punctilious as your household, so strict in ceremony, then not only would you not be able to escape this garden gate today, but even if you wished to see this old neighbour of yours, that too would be impossible. Just because I am of humble origin, and speak plainly without concern for empty forms, I have been able to know your honoured person; and now, by chance meeting, I can point you the way."

Xian Ci, being a man who could not speak falsehood, could only assent with repeated "yes, yes." At this time the maiden had already given him a long route through the mountains. Xian Ci stood to take his leave, saying, "As I said before, I only beg your guidance in a single word; I will find my way from there, and not trouble you to see me on my way."

Third Sister Hu laughed heartily: "You officials are all of such style, which I find disagreeable. Yet I will walk a few steps with you. Many use polite speech, but I will tell you plainly: the paths of this garden are not extremely intricate, but for a stranger, relying on a few words of guidance, it is impossible to walk out smoothly. You see before you two forked paths, each leading outside. But the distance and difficulty differ greatly; bends within bends, forks outside forks; without step-by-step accompaniment, it cannot be clearly explained. There are places even I myself cannot describe! Only when you have passed there will you understand. Shall I not see you out?"

Hearing this, Xian Ci hesitated. For it was late, and a young woman and a solitary man walking together in a place so little frequented might appear improper. Should palace people see them, it would be a grievous reproach upon the woman. Reflecting thus, he felt the matter most perilous, and fear increased. Yet he saw the maiden hold her head high and chest forth, striding swiftly before him, her bearing more like a gallant youth than a lady of the inner chamber. In his heart he feared her somewhat. He could only summon courage, bow his head, and follow closely behind, walking swiftly and no longer daring to speak, lest he alarm the snakes and draw suspicion. Yet Third Sister Hu paid no heed to his scruples. Having walked some way, she would turn and speak a few words. Xian Ci was greatly at a loss, and could not say what words to speak to avoid suspicion, answering only what was asked, and no more.

At length they came forth from the garden gate, and along the road they met not a soul. Xian Ci's heart was at last settled, and he was exceedingly grateful to the maiden. He was about to speak thanks, but Third Sister Hu anticipated his thought and smiled, saying, "Sir, having passed the great gate, you think you no longer need me, nor will you invite me to your mansion to sit, drink tea, or eat something? Such little expense would show your household to be one full of propriety and courtesy!"

Xian Ci did not expect such strange words. In his heart, he was glad to invite her to accompany him a little to express thanks. But he must yet pass through a street market, where many would see them; a man and woman walking together, what would be thought? Yet he was a man of sincerity and could not lightly deceive. To invent a lie troubled him; and the maiden, being familiar with the way, went before him honestly and calmly, guiding him. Happily, she spoke no more, so passers-by suspected not that they were companions; Xian Ci’s heart was somewhat at ease.

Soon they reached the mansion gate. Xian Ci's parents, having been greatly anxious that he had not returned all night, were beside themselves. Now they saw their beloved son return, accompanied by a strange woman; they were both joyful and amazed, doubtful and suspicious. Xian Ci could only briefly relate the past events, and pointing to Third Sister said, "Thanks to this Third Sister’s rescue, I today could not have escaped the garden; who knows what great trouble it might have caused!" Sun Jie and his wife then understood the whole matter, and hastened to invite the third sister in, both twice offering thanks. Only then did Third Sister bow before the two elders. The household laughed and rejoiced greatly.

From that time forth, Xian Ci wholly regarded fame, wealth, family, and children as light as mist and cloud, devoting himself wholly to escaping the mundane world and early ascending to the celestial realm. Sometimes he would speak of this meaning to his parents. Luo Yuan was a person of rooted capacity, and knowing that Xian Ci was a gift of the immortals, naturally did not expect him to linger long in the mortal realm, only praying he might soon attain the way, which would be a great benefit to his parents.

Therefore, hearing this, they did not much oppose. Only Sun Jie thought otherwise. Formerly, having no son, he was frantic, seeking heaven and earth, praying to gods and Buddhas; by chance he obtained this fine son. By the ordinary view, he naturally wished his son to continue the family line, to glorify the ancestral line. Who expected that before establishing a household, such thoughts of transcendence would arise? Thus the couple’s twenty years of ardent hope and full joy was all cast away like flowing water. With such a mind, Sun Jie could not at all accept Xian Ci’s proposal. Father and son were thus somewhat estranged. Xian Ci’s resolve was firm; no matter how his father pressed him, he could not alter his original purpose. Sun Jie resolved that unless he died, he would hold control of affairs, and not allow his son freedom to act in such transgressing ways. The first great matter of contention between them was Xian Ci’s marriage. One side resolutely refused to wed; the other pressed eagerly to hasten it. The greatest difficulty, naturally, was the lady Luo Yuan. Further, from this problem arose a little amusing episode:

It was that Third Sister Hu, who had saved Xian Ci, after returning him and gaining the favour of his parents, was invited often to visit. From then on she came daily to the Sun household, speaking with Xian Ci with great intimacy. Third Sister was not only fair but also clever; whatever matters there were, without waiting for Xian Ci to speak, she had handled them most suitably; she did not avoid suspicion nor shy from toil. No matter what concerned Xian Ci, there was nothing she did not do, nothing she did not manage perfectly. Xian Ci was a straightforward and sincere man, and moved by her former kindness, naturally treated her well. Yet from the viewpoint of Sun Jie and his wife, each had their own opinion. Sun Jie saw that Xian Ci was unwilling to marry, but pleased to speak with Third Sister, thinking he disliked marrying the daughter of Bo Gao, and wished to wed Third Sister, using cultivation of the way as a pretext. Though they could say nothing against the Bo Gao family, this at least could stop him from taking monastic vows, and thus, in misfortune, was regarded as a great blessing.

Holding this thought, he did not resent Third Sister’s levity, but sought to promote their affection, often teasing her with ambiguous words. Third Sister seemed half to understand and half not, responding only evasively. Yet Luo Yuan saw through her son was no lecher; and that Third Sister sought glory and wealth, intending to serve as a matchmaker, so she held her in disdain, mocking and reproaching her, hoping she would withdraw. But Third Sister was thick-skinned, enduring all scorn, coming daily and entangling with Xian Ci. He remained neither close nor distant with her. This perplexed Sun Jie greatly.

One day, unable to bear it, Sun Jie secretly invited Third Sister and asked if she would be willing to be his daughter-in-law. Third Sister agreed at once. Sun Jie rejoiced. Xian Ci had repeatedly wished to become a monk, and lately shut himself indoors to practice breathing exercises. The old man had but this one son, and indeed did not wish him to lose present wealth and rank to seek the way and immortality. Therefore he entrusted Third Sister to counsel him well. Seeing their deep affection, and that Xian Ci heeded Third Sister most, if she consented to be their daughter-in-law, that would be best. If henceforth Xian Ci could be turned, the old man could arrange with Bo’s family to break the engagement, and would not wrong Third Sister.

Third Sister heard this, but showed no blush nor tremor, calmly saying, "I admire your talents, sir, and that you do not reject me; I am willing to be your handmaid, to counsel you. But as the betrothal with the lady Bo was prior, how can it be broken? Let me first win your heart, and then marriage is not too late." Sun Jie heard this and grew even more pleased, secretly watching their actions.

Day by day, seeing no change, and Xian Ci continuing his breathing exercises, he marveled. About to urge Third Sister, pondering what words to use, he paced in the corridor for an hour. By the lamplight, he saw Third Sister enter Xian Ci’s chamber. Sun Jie, seeing her come at night, did not consider by what means she entered; he thought perhaps this night would bring success, and was much comforted. He stealthily stood near the window to listen.

After a while, no sound; he licked the paper window with his tongue and peered in, laughing and angry. Xian Ci sat on a cushion, eyes closed, quietly practicing. Third Sister stood beside him, making various playful gestures—bending and bowing, leaping about, never leaving close to him. Amusingly, Xian Ci at first saw nothing, absorbed in his practice. When finished, he opened his eyes and saw Third Sister squatting before him, imitating a child worshipping Guan Yin, looking up and smiling with bewitching and alluring expression.

Outside, Sun Jie nodded and murmured, "This is more to the point," his eyes fixed on how Xian Ci would respond. Xian Ci opened his eyes wide, showed no alarm, and slowly asked, "Why have you come again, Third Sister?" She, smiling, shifted her body closer by a finger’s breadth, her charming and coquettish face nearly touching his waist, and answered with a laugh, "Then do you say I should not come?" Xian Ci shook his head solemnly, saying, "It is right for you to come, but wrong at this hour. Third Sister, you are clever and prudent; do you not know how to avoid suspicion of improper conduct between man and woman?" Third Sister, hearing this, twisted her body soft and limber, uttering a voice that stirred the heart, saying, "Sir, why do you speak such foolish words? Life is but to seek joy; a hundred years pass in a moment. If not to seek some pleasure in youth, then in old age when such spirit is gone, one is but as grass and wood decaying. Who will talk of propriety? Good sir, cease your folly; know that sweet nights are rare, and good things difficult to meet! You and I, strangers crossing paths, grown intimate, is no accident; surely some predestined bond lies within. You so constrained, do you not wrong my good will?"

Xian Ci heard this, neither angry nor alarmed, and still sat on his cushion as if nothing, shaking his head: "Third Sister, your kindness I understand, but the more I accept it, the more I dare not harm your reputation as an unchaste and unclean woman. Each has his own will; one cannot force another. The hour grows late; your lingering is useless. Should others inside know, your dignity would suffer."

Having spoken thus, he lowered his head in silence. Outside, Sun Jie was anxious beyond measure, wishing to enter and command his son: "This is what I wish her to do; you must not disobey me!" After a while, again he was angry, then looking inside, he saw Third Sister sigh, then suddenly, using women’s secret arts, tears flowed from her eyes; wailing mournfully, she said, "I am no base woman; today’s matters are not from lewd intent. You threaten me with scandal, but I too am but carrying out a trust, coming by command; even to see the old master, no fault is found. Do not mention this again. Pray teach me, sir, how are these words ‘each has his own will’ to be understood?" Xian Ci smiled and said, "Third Sister, do not argue with me. You are so clever; surely you know that I have even rejected my betrothed wife. All for what? How could there be any improper dealings with you?"

Third Sister laughed heartily: "So you speak of seeking immortality and the way? That is most laughable. Not to say there may be no true immortals in the world; even if there are, with such a delicate body and tender frame as yours, how could you endure the hardships of cultivation? This is of yourself I speak; and your parents, since having you, have spent much care in nurture, hoping you would marry early and beget heirs, that they might enjoy the joy of grandchildren soon. What ardent and sincere affection! Should you truly become a monk, it must be after your parents’ passing, after you have children, so that the family incense may endure. Then you may with a clear conscience rejoice in heaven and earth, roam the eight wilds and four seas, become a god or immortal, free and unrestrained, all by your own will; then what sister would deny you? But as things stand, your thoughts and your parents’ stand in complete opposition. I have heard that if you determine to take monastic vows, your father will fight you to the death. Tell me, sir, could you bear to do this, killing your father?" On these words she paused, looking at Xian Ci. His expression changed slightly, as if troubled.

Outside, Sun Jie was almost shouting for joy. Third Sister pressed further: "Sir, why no reply? Do you not believe my plain words?" Xian Ci’s face regained its usual calm, and he laughed aloud: "This is what is called each having his own will!" Third Sister was struck silent for a long moment, then said, "You still say this! It shows no turning of heart. Sir, I tell you again, if you truly have great root, you also know that my Third Sister Hu’s present attainment is sufficient to be your master! Ha! Before an immortal you will not bow; instead, you say you will enter the mountains and woods, abandon your parents, and seek an uncertain immortality far away! Truly, this is the extreme of folly." Xian Ci, hearing this, was suddenly startled, and lifted his head to gaze at her.

Third Sister laughed: "I know you do not believe I have attainment, but this is no matter to be spoken lightly of. You may test me as you will, but after trial, if you recognise I am an immortal, you should bow to me as master, and obey all my commands. Can you do so?" Xian Ci replied gravely, "Third Sister, do not jest. If you are truly an immortal, surely you have famous mountains and caves, and many things to do. Why have time daily to linger with a mortal like me?" Third Sister laughed and rejoiced: "You are truly the foolishest of the wise. To speak plainly, I have come for your future! Generally, those who become immortals value their childhood form, but there are some who marry and beget children, and yet do not harm their cultivation. Those only who selfishly forget their parents’ deep grace are most hated by the immortals; even with ten generations of childhood form and a thousand years of practice, they come to nothing. You see reason best, and though well read, have you ever heard of an immortal unfilial to parents?"

Outside, Sun Jie’s feet ached from standing. Hearing these words, he felt great understanding and joy, forgetting his weariness, and watching intently. Xian Ci opened his eyes and gazed at Third Sister for a long time, then closed them again without a word. Third Sister, seeing his firm resolve, nodded unconsciously. Suddenly her countenance changed to anger; regardless of right or wrong, she stepped forward and seized him, lifting Xian Ci from the cushion like an eagle snatching a chick. Xian Ci did not resist. No one expected that the usually meeting Third Sister was a woman of martial strength, a heroine. Alarmed, he said, "Third Sister, do not lay hands on me. I, Sun Xian Ci, am not one to be easily tempted or threatened to betrayal! Kill me if you will, yet I shall have no regrets." Third Sister then called out, and from her mouth appeared a small sword, which she waved to great length, shining cold and making one shudder. Holding the hilt, she pointed the blade at Xian Ci, and said, "Words will not do; only force remains. I give you one moment to answer me. If you are wise, marry me at once, and I shall teach you all the immortal arts of my lifelong practice, that you may become an immortal. If not, this blade will not recognise you as noble sir!"

Seeing her skill, Xian Ci knew Third Sister was a first-rate swordswoman; yet how was she so base? His heart was much troubled. Outside, Sun Jie trembled with fear, first intending to enter and speak for his son, but seeing Third Sister’s ultimatum, he wished to see one last answer. Knowing her care for Xian Ci, he was emboldened. Then Xian Ci said resolutely, "So Third Sister is truly a sword immortal; your disciple was remiss! But I have sworn before my master, and been instructed; this life I dare not approach women. Were I to do so, my master’s sword-light would be fiercer than yours. At even the faintest news, no matter how far, the sword-light would come and slay me in an instant. I would rather preserve this precious body, endure your sword, and meet my master in the netherworld. Perhaps he, seeing my steadfast heart, will find a way to deliver me! Then I would not dare complain of you, Third Sister."

Third Sister, seeing his firmness, changed anger to joy. Stepping back three paces, she sheathed her sword, and lightly smiled: "You truly are a strange man. To confess, all that before was a test of your heart. You are young, your power in the way shallow, yet you have such courage and resolution; your future is truly boundless. I have been remiss." Xian Ci felt as if a great stone fell, and smilingly bowed in thanks: "Third Sister is indeed a high immortal; your disciple is ignorant and rude, having offended too much in speech; I beg your forgiveness." Third Sister laughed: "Though so, your marriage to Miss Bo is ordained by heaven, and cannot be avoided. If you trust me, the sooner this worldly bond is ended the better." Xian Ci made no answer. Outside, Sun Jie was lost in a fog of confusion.

What Third Sister’s final thoughts were is left to the next chapter.
