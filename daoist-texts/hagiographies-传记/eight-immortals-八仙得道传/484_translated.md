# Chapter Sixteen: The Filial Son Descends to the Sea to Seek the Snail Spirit; The Fox Immortal Enters the Palace to Visit the Dragon King

It is said that Xian Ci saw Hu Sanjie arrive, and hastily rose to welcome her. Sanjie smiled and said, "You are always speaking of repaying the恩 of one's parents; now your mother has been drowned in the Huai River by your younger brother, and your father, in anger with that same younger brother, died last year. Have you not thought to return and take a look?"

Xian Ci answered, tears streaming down his cheeks: "The disciple, having received the master's precepts, keeps the six senses pure and undefiled by myriad dusts. Sometimes, in the midst of stillness, a single thought may arise concerning my two parents at home. Yet I firmly observe Sanjie's injunctions, and follow the master's teachings: apart from concentrating with one heart on refining the Qi and purifying the mind, I entertain no other thoughts. Nor do I dare to leave the place of cultivation without leave, lest I summon outward demons and obstacles. The situation here and the feelings within my heart are well known to master and Sanjie alike. Now, in obedience to Sanjie's instructions, my family suffers this grievous calamity, my parents both struck by misfortune. I am not moved by attachment to the dust of the world, and have no thought of abandoning my household. Only concerning the suffering of my parents do I feel the anguish of not being able to spread wings and fly to see them, so that my heart may find peace!"

Sanjie smiled and said, "That flood-dragon who has taken human form is bent solely upon opposing you. Since your departure, he has joined an evil cult, learning sorcery, and is often able to transform his original form to raise demons and cause mischief. Your mother was no stranger to the Way, yet she could not withstand a single curse of his: 'Whence did you come? Return whence you came.' Alas, after decades as a mortal, she is still but a field snail, and is unjustly bound by the spell, unable to come or go freely. Though you have studied the Way many years and know some arts, to resist him is as if you strike a stone with an egg—defeat is certain. Were you to go, you must first have a means to conquer the flood-dragon spirit."

Xian Ci made no reply to this, but first wished to know how his parents were harmed. Sanjie said, "Between Heaven and Earth, the forces of right and wrong exist with corresponding might; the righteous have their sects, the wicked have their factions. By common reasoning, evil cannot overcome good; yet when misfortune comes, even the upright cannot preserve themselves, and the evil take advantage to overthrow the good. This flood-dragon spirit, though acting unjustly, having joined that sect, has his own band of followers—turtles and tortoises and the like—who at any moment can guide and support him, preventing his losing his true nature and keeping him on the demonic path. Moreover, their intent is to cultivate sorcery, not the Great Way. Sorcery is easy, the Way is hard; the Way is the root, sorcery the branch. Cultivators of the Way need not speak of sorcery, though sorcery embraces all. Yet true success is great, and cultivation difficult. Those who learn sorcery may master it, but remain far from the Way; when meeting one of the Way, sorcery is always defeated. But at present, in cultivation, compared with those who use sorcery, one is often subject to sorcery, not that the Way is inferior to sorcery. This is because sorcery can be learned in fragments, while the Way must be cultivated whole and reverently. Without accomplishment in the Way, it is as if not learning at all; how can those unlearned resist demonic sorcery? Now, what you and I study is the true Golden Elixir Way of the immortals, whose inner secrets are far beyond the dreams of reckless little demons. Yet before cultivation is complete, one cannot but fear somewhat the power of sorcery."

Xian Ci suddenly understood and said, "I perceive it now: that flood-dragon must have received guidance and support from that band of comrades, thus able to use sorcery, so that my mother could not resist and was instead bound by spells. As for my father, being utterly without the Way, he was no match for him."

Sanjie nodded and said, "Your father, because the flood-dragon liked to consort with bandits and do evil, when reproved once or twice, was pushed down by him. The aged cannot withstand such injuries; in less than a day, he died of his wounds. This happened last winter. After your father's death, your mother, having a body suited to sorcery and still youthful in appearance, was coveted by the demon spirit, who sought to commit unnatural acts. Your mother bit his finger, and the mother-child affection was broken. The flood-dragon learned some sorcery from somewhere, took out your mother's stubborn shell, placed it in the main hall, and waited for her to emerge. Reciting a few words of incantation: 'Knock, knock, knock; old mother snail shell, enter, enter, enter; old mother snail spirit. Old snail, old snail, show your true form quickly; if not revealed, descend to the underworld by the sword.' Upon finishing these words, marvelously your mother suddenly vanished, having been taken into the snail shell, to live again as her snail self. Cruel indeed was this evil flood-dragon, who kept the snail in the pond, intending to cook and eat it. But Heaven, truly responsive, sent a sudden heavy rain that washed the snail out of the pond and into the Huai River. This frightened the flood-dragon, who dared not again entertain thoughts of cooking it. Using spells, he sank her into the river, forbidding her to emerge for a thousand years. Now your mother still suffers greatly!"

Xian Ci wept bitterly and said, "What sin had my parents committed to suffer such cruel retribution? Pray, Sanjie, can I still meet with my parents?" Sanjie answered gravely, "How could you not? To be frank with you, it is by the master's decree that I bring you to the Huai River to see your mother. Otherwise, why would I come to speak at such length?"

Xian Ci further asked, "After seeing my mother, relying on the master's divine power and Sanjie's magic, can she surely be saved from danger?" Sanjie shook her head and said, "It is not so easy. The master has said that your mother sinned greatly in the past and must now bear this retribution. Fortunately, she has you, her son, to aid her much. The master instructed me to transmit to your mother a method of cultivation, by which she must refine her stubborn body to become great and small at will—great enough to transform the snail shell into a cavernous sea abode, capable of accommodating a thousand practitioners, befriending the Dragon King of the sea; then her Way would be complete, and she would escape the animal path. This is the blessing born of misfortune. But the master also said she and the snail spirit have no connection, so this aid is all for you. After you achieve the Way, you must travel the world, accomplish three thousand merits, and repay Heaven's grace on your mother's behalf! Yet you must delay ascending to the heavenly realms for a thousand years, and must reenter reincarnation as a mortal. But the deeper the foundation, the easier the ascent. Can you agree? Only then can the great technique be transmitted to your mother; otherwise, the master would not trouble himself over a demon spirit unrelated to her. What say you?"

Xian Ci, tears streaming, kowtowed and said, "So long as my mother be saved, I, Xian Ci, am willing to remain forever a wandering immortal who saves and aids men. I would not complain at never ascending! Moreover, only a thousand years! But there is one more thing: my father now dwells in the underworld; may Sanjie take me there to see him?"

Sanjie nodded and said, "Your father was benevolent in heart, did no great evil in this life; his untimely death was surely the debt of sin from a previous life. That debt discharged, he will be reborn in a blessed place, enjoying great reward. You need not trouble yourself further."

Xian Ci said, "Though so, my heart ever desires to see my deceased father once more, that I may be at peace."

Sanjie pondered and said, "Very well! The master only sent me to bring you to your mother, not to take you on the path of the underworld. But I will make for you a most excellent plan, for I heard the master say that your father, though good, has no immortal fate, and must be born fifteen times in prosperous, kind families. When your thousand years are complete, I shall seek from the master that he be reborn as his son once more, so that after a thousand years you will still be father and son—a story for the ages! And you may rest your heart. What say you?" Xian Ci was greatly pleased and thanked her.

He asked how the flood-dragon fared. Sanjie shook her head: "This fellow is a demon seed, already in an evil cult; his sins will fill the world, and others will deal with him. Why should we trouble ourselves?" Xian Ci said, "One who kills brothers and fathers and curses his own mother, is this not a great and heinous crime? If such a one is not punished and left in the world to harm others, is not the Heavenly Way too lenient?" Sanjie said, "That too is a long discourse on the Great Way. Now I can speak briefly with you. As I said before, the decreed misfortune is not only beyond human power to change, but even Heaven cannot alter it. Just as Heaven has four seasons, and day and night have their climates of cold and heat, wind and rain, mankind would wish for sun without rain, mild without cold or heat, long days without endless nights. Yet birth and death, growth and decay, all have fixed destinies; even the Jade Emperor, the Primordial Lord of Heaven, the Old Master, and the Buddha of the West cannot force these. How much less can the humble man mix yin and yang at will? The calamity spoken of is of this nature. Just as in the mortal world there are matters of order and disorder, and the world cannot be always in order without disorder, so too the Heavenly Way cannot be all good without evil. Now the flood-dragon spirit you see is so cruel and savage that killing him seems righteous; yet countless evil demons and monsters exist between Heaven and Earth, born of their calamity, and their actions have their cause and effect. As for your mother’s matter, neither side can be called truly righteous. They oppose and overthrow each other as barbarians do in tribal disputes; victory and defeat, survival and destruction, have no reason beyond themselves. Because of you, the master has been troubled so much; otherwise, who would have the leisure to attend to such things?"

Xian Ci, hearing this, felt both shame and gratitude, and followed Sanjie out of the cave. Sanjie pointed with her hand, and two white clouds flew down from the air, slowly settling before them. Smiling, Sanjie pointed to one and said, "You may ascend upon this." She herself mounted the other cloud. Looking back, she saw Xian Ci standing on the cloud, seeming somewhat timid and trembling; she laughed and said, "You always long for ascension to Heaven; can Heaven be ascended without riding the clouds? How comes it, that once on the clouds, you feel uneasy?" Xian Ci laughed and said, "Sanjie, your cultivation is profound; the coming and going of clouds and mist is but a small matter. I, who have long desired it but never obtained it, am overwhelmed with joy now that I have it." Sanjie laughed heartily, and together they rose.

Along the way, Xian Ci asked her to teach him the method of cloud-riding. Sanjie laughed and said, "Your studies lie in the Way; when the Way is accomplished, all methods are accomplished; they are but minor arts. We, however, are as mountains of accumulated evil, with no merits; though we have now abandoned evil and returned to the right, we can only perform slight arts akin to conjuring tricks, learning small skills for self-defense. When you achieve accomplishment, you will surpass us all. These are no empty words; the master has said the same. Among our sect there is none who can match you."

Xian Ci, hearing this, was much disturbed, saying, "Why does Sanjie so highly praise me, putting me to great embarrassment?" Sanjie smiled without reply, saying, "This cloud-riding art seems of little significance, but in truth there is a great difference. As your studies become refined, you will inevitably face intrusion by demons and devils. These ordinary arts you should first master; but until the Great Way is achieved and the body refined, this crude and heavy body cannot rise on the clouds without a spell. When you succeed, your heart will be beyond the clouds, your person upon the clouds; wherever you wish to go, lucky clouds will rise beneath your feet; you will not need to beckon as I just did, much less recite incantations." Xian Ci understood and agreed. On the cloud Sanjie taught him the secret of halting and steering the cloud, which Xian Ci comprehended. He then smiled and asked, "Does this spell allow anyone to rise swiftly to Heaven?" Sanjie laughed, "Nonsense again! The path of immortals is distant from mortals; true immortals do not lightly pass secret spells to common folk. There is only one evil cult, whose disciples are many but resources few; all their members are demons and ghosts, straying from the right path. They also have a cloud-riding spell, but unlike ours; those I knew before following the master were all of this kind. So they learned their cloud-riding spells and other arts of transformation and escape. Whatever the right Way possesses, the evil cult has none it cannot imitate. Yet in the application of these methods, not one is quite the same. Thus the evil cult has its own origins and foundation; do not lightly despise them!"

Xian Ci nodded with due respect, and said, "Surely there is nothing swifter in the world than cloud-riding?" Sanjie said, "Cloud-riding is also of varying speed. For today's journey, since it is your first time on the clouds, to avoid dizziness and for ease of conversation, we travel slowly; yet compared to mortal walking, it is millions of times swifter. But cloud-riding cannot yet be called the swiftest; the supreme swiftness is to traverse the four seas and nine continents in a single day. Formerly the Lady Xuan forged the Five-Colored Sword, uniting it with spirit; wherever the spirit went, the sword followed. The sword is not like the iron tools used by men for killing, but is refined to shed light, even to the stage of having light without sword. Where the light reaches, there the sword reaches; in an instant it can fly from the far south to the far north. Its use, besides slaying evil and subduing demons, is to transmit messages; with heart and sword united, the sword's light can display thoughts, or convey written words, sent thousands of li afar. When the sword light reaches this degree it is called Great Accomplishment. The wielder becomes an immortal through the sword; the sword endures ten thousand calamities without decay, and the man remains through ten thousand generations. Now in the world remain four sects—Red, White, Blue, and Black—each with its own patriarch and disciples, whose renown and power rival ours in the immortal world. Unfortunately, the Blue and Black sects have fallen into the hands of mere beasts, led by two monkeys who vex the Red and White sects. Happily, the sword arts of the Red and White are deeper, so no great harm results. This too is like the two sects of good and evil, coexisting as Yin and Yang, neither to be discarded. In sum, such is the way of things!"

Xian Ci, hearing this, was long amazed and exclaimed, "You say cloud-riding is the fastest, yet there are things swifter still! Pray, Sanjie, the Sword Immortal has such wondrous skill; can my school not rival theirs?" Sanjie laughed and said, "Impossible! Our school is the orthodox immortal technique; our patriarchs have profound Way, vast Heaven and Earth, victorious everywhere. In all worldly affairs, before events manifest, they have foreseen them for hundreds of years. Even if by speed alone, considering the vastness of the nine provinces, the heights of the five sacred mountains, and the depths of the four seas, with the patriarch's mind encompassing all, what need have they of sword light? Such is the use of the Great Way, surpassing all other powers. Yet by power alone, sword light must be fastest. I also heard the master say that in five thousand years hence, mankind will advance, and many immortal arts will be transmitted to men. Then the patriarchs will request Lady Xuan to transform the sword light into electricity, that a thousand li apart, messages and letters may be transmitted in an instant. This the patriarchs told the masters. If we have the destiny, we may cultivate an unblemished body. Five thousand years pass in a blink; you and I surely shall not fail to witness it!" Xian Ci nodded in understanding.

While thus engaged in lively discourse, Sanjie suddenly tapped him on the shoulder: "We have reached the Huai River. We came flying from the South Sea, traveling more than a thousand li. Try now to recite the Cloud-Halting Formula and see what happens." Xian Ci silently repeated the formula, and indeed the cloud lowered, descending upon the riverbank.

Overjoyed, Xian Ci thought of his mother suffering there, and tears fell again. Sanjie paid no heed, but pointed with her hand into the water, where amidst surging waves appeared a broad and smooth path. Sanjie led Xian Ci along it.

After half an hour, Sanjie said, "Ahead stands a palace resplendent with gold and jade; this is the Crystal Palace where your old friend dwells. We must first pay him a visit, that he may undertake all matters for us." Xian Ci knew she spoke of a past life; the old friend was the Dragon King of Peace spoken of by the master. Smiling, he said, "Since he is an old friend, he should be visited, especially as we seek his aid." Sanjie went ahead a few steps to the palace gate. Already the sea patrol Yakshas stood to block the way. Sanjie explained their purpose and pointed to Xian Ci, saying, "This is the great king's old friend." The Yakshas, hearing this, dared not neglect them, and respectfully bowed, then struck the great announcement bell at the palace gate. The bell sounded thrice, and many aquatic officials, such as the Mandarin Gui and the strategist Carp, came out to verify their names and invite them into the guest chambers. After a short while, word came: "The Great King requests to see his two old friends!" Sanjie led Xian Ci, and with several solemn aquatic officers, they ascended.

The Dragon King of Peace already knew Xian Ci as the bat turned mortal, and courteously took his seat to receive them. Sanjie and Xian Ci prepared to make great obeisance, but the king laughed and said, "We were old friends in former days, and now are not of one order; dare we accept such great ceremony? Your politeness but makes us strangers." They therefore made a modest bow. The Dragon King retired to the inner palace and ordered a feast and wine prepared to entertain the guests. Truly the Dragon Palace was rich beyond mortal comparison. In an instant, the dishes were arrayed, the delicacies displayed. The Dragon King came down to accompany them, and inquired into Xian Ci’s affairs since their last meeting. Xian Ci related in order of the insult by the old flood-dragon, the transformation by the virtuous immortal Wenmei, the dragon’s reincarnations and renewed persecutions. The noble and brave Dragon King, his beard bristling, his crown aflame, smote the table with his fist, shouting fiercely. He immediately sent forth orders to dispatch one hundred thousand aquatic soldiers to scour all water palaces for the old flood-dragon, to punish him severely and avenge his old friend.

Hu Sanjie hastily rose, smiling and checked him: "Great King, please temper your anger. This little demon is of small consequence; when his sins fill the world, Heaven’s punishment will come. But now is not the time; to stir the hosts may be vain, and capture uncertain. I beg your Majesty to restrain your thunderous wrath." The Dragon King said angrily, "If that be true, do these demon men have no fixed lifespan?" Sanjie spoke with seriousness: "Though demons need not have fixed fates, Heaven yet has fixed destinies. The tyrants and rebels of the world, and the demons and ghosts beyond, are all born in their appointed time; while their fate is unfulfilled, human power cannot control them; when their fate is fulfilled, they perish without battle. Why should Your Majesty trouble yourself?"

The Dragon King heard this but was displeased. Xian Ci repeated his entreaties and earnestly persuaded. The Dragon King stroked his long beard, and sighed with a smile: "Very well! Since you both say so, I need not seek quarrel with him. Yet as my old friend, now seeing him oppressed, I feel uneasy being unable to aid him." They then spoke many kind words and pacified the Dragon King’s anger, and drank with great merriment. Sanjie then related to him the purpose of Xian Ci’s coming to seek his mother.

The Dragon King quickly said, "That is easy. Why must you go in person? I will send men to seek her and rescue her from danger so that mother and son may meet here; what could be better?" Sanjie smiled: "Your Majesty’s kindness overwhelms us, but the snail spirit is bound by the flood-dragon’s sorcery and cannot be free. Moreover, her calamities are many, and this trial must be borne. The master said she must cultivate her dharma body through a thousand years of tribulation, and that within her stubborn shell a great Daoist ritual of seven days and nights must be enacted by adepts, that she may escape disaster. Though suffering now, it is a fortunate opportunity for cultivation; and our master’s immortal secret may bring her great future accomplishment. To rescue her now would hinder her practice; to love her is to harm her. Yet under Your Majesty’s rule, this millennium is perilous, and demons may intrude and distract her cultivation. This is cause for concern. Therefore, I have brought this young master to visit Your Majesty, that you may instruct the river deity to protect her at all times. The young master is most grateful!"

The Dragon King heartily agreed, saying, "Such small matters need no special command." He immediately summoned his two ministers to meet them, and before them gave orders to manage the matter well. He specially appointed Mandarin Gui to lead eight patrolling Yakshas to escort the two on their journey. Deeply moved, the two bowed thanks. The Dragon King laughed and said, "You two are too polite! I, a man grown in the wilds, am rough and simple, and have no such ceremony!" All laughed together. After the feast ended, the two took leave of the Dragon King and followed Mandarin Gui and four Yakshas away from the Dragon Palace, toward the mouth of the Huai River.

How the meeting of mother and son fared, we shall see in the next chapter.
