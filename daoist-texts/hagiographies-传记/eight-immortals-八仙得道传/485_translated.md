# Chapter Seventeen: Immortal Sun Bestows Meeting with Mother Under the Sea – Zhang Guolao Reborn to Attain the Elixir

It is related that Hu Sanjie, accompanied by Immortal Sun and together with the fish doctor Gui and the sea-patrolling Yaksha attendants sent by the Dragon King, arrived at the border where the Huai and the sea meet. The Yakshas reported: "This place is called Huaihai Village in the water domain. On the east side it is governed by the Huai deity; on this western side it is all great ocean, now under the jurisdiction of the sea god newly appointed by our great king. Pray, may we ask on which side dwells the friend whom the great immortal wishes to visit?" Upon hearing this, Sanjie quickly gave a signal to Immortal Sun, and said to the Yakshas: "We accept the great king’s generous kindness in entrusting you to escort us hither. Now that we have arrived at the place, it is a small district and it is inconvenient to trouble you further. We will proceed ourselves to seek our friend. Pray return and report to your lord." The Yakshas were more than glad at this, and all together asked the fish doctor, "What say you?" The fish doctor likewise was reluctant to go further, and so after some polite hesitation they took their leave.

Hereupon Sanjie smiled at Immortal Sun and said: "Those little fellows only thought us come to pay respects to some great guest; they knew not that it was a field snail held captive! All these creatures are bent on self-interest; why should we provoke their laughter?" Immortal Sun assented.

The two then employed the art of dividing waters to find the bottom of the Huai River. There was seen a great field snail buried in the earth, with only a small aperture from which it could just slightly extend its head, breathing faintly, awaiting the passing little worms to catch and eat. Immortal Sun, knowing in his heart this was his birth mother, was struck with sorrow and could not but weep aloud. Sanjie hastened to say: "Weep not! Weep not! I will announce to her on your behalf, and also make your mother recognise you as her son."

Immortal Sun, according to her words, bent down and lifted the snail shell floating on the mud surface. Sanjie then called out: "Luo Yuan! Luo Yuan! Your rebellious son Immortal Sun has come seeking you!" The snail stretched out its neck a great length, and looked towards the water surface. From the look of it, it seemed to understand the matter. Presently the snail’s neck touched Immortal Sun’s head, seeming to cling fast, motionless for a long while, unwilling to depart. Such a scene plainly showed great intimacy. Immortal Sun likewise pressed his neck and face against the snail’s flesh and wept bitterly.

After a long while, Sanjie explained to her the past events, and conveyed the master’s intention, urging her to endure this thousand-year calamity, by which she might cultivate herself and establish her life, thus attaining an imperishable body. She further said: "All this is because in your former life you committed many sins; now you must suffer cruel retribution. Yet because of your son, you may become upright in your path; this is indeed misfortune mingled with good fortune. Now I will transmit to you the secret formula of cultivation. It seems you are naturally intelligent; so long as you apply yourself day and night, in no more than three hundred years you will be able to leave behind your stubborn shell; the power of spells and talismans will not be able to bind you. Yet you cannot leave the water’s depths; you must endure a further five hundred years, and when your merit is eight or nine parts complete, not to speak of devils and heretics who cannot harm you, you may dwell in the ocean’s bottom, using your stubborn shell as your cavern dwelling. After a thousand years, when your merit is perfected, then you may meet your son again. Moreover, you shall invite accomplished and virtuous men to hold a great Daoist ritual, to deliver the many spirits who have suffered from your poison; thus your karmic debts may be cleared, your future smooth, and no more misfortunes will arise."

The snail spirit listened and nodded vigorously, as a sign of thanks. Sanjie then imparted the incantations to her. When all was completed, Sanjie said: "This place is not fit for lingering; let us return!" Immortal Sun had no choice but to obey. After again showing affection to the snail and speaking many words of encouragement, he turned back with Sanjie, and emerged from the water. Sanjie said: "Your great matter is now accomplished; quickly return to Tiantai to pursue your own cultivation." Immortal Sun answered: "So be it." Sanjie bade him recite his cloud-riding spell, and both rose to mid-air, hastening southward. In a short while they had already arrived at Tiantai, returning to their dwelling. Sanjie took leave and departed.

At parting she solemnly admonished: "Young master, henceforth your responsibility is ever greater. Having resolved to save your mother, you must rescue her from the sea to complete your great task; yet this is all your merit work. Though in this life you suffer hardship, in the next you shall receive considerable reward. For five hundred years you must devote yourself to your cultivation; after five hundred years, though you may not become an immortal, you will have considerable magical power, and should then go forth wandering the world, relieving the suffering of those in distress, aiding those in difficulty, fulfilling the allotted merit. Your master will then send you to be reincarnated among mortals; after that rebirth, so long as your original heart is not obscured, in several decades you will ascend to immortality and attain the Way."

Immortal Sun accepted these promises one by one, and asked: "When merit is fulfilled, may one no longer fall into the mortal realm?" Sanjie replied: "Far from it! Have you not heard that formerly the Heavenly Emperor, for a single lustful thought, sent a soul to descend to the mortal tribulations? When merit was nearly complete, he could have ascended at once; but out of one thought of compassion, unable to bear to leave his son, he reincarnated once more. In later lives, owing to impurity of the six senses, his merit failed just before completion, until at the last rebirth, with a hundred meditations turned to dust, his spirit became clear and untroubled, without any lingering attachments, then only did he ascend again to the celestial realm, and was enfeoffed as the Great Emperor Zhenwu. Even with the supreme honour of the Jade Emperor, so profound a foundation, he could not allow the slightest mortal thought; much less ordinary men, much less us born in the beastly realms and newly entered the human world! According to ordinary rules, at a mere glimpse of mortal aspiration like yours, you would immediately turn back. At that time your Way-heart is unsteady and your cultivation not deep; even after one more life, you would not escape the mortal net. Ten more lives in the human world might not assure a good end. Though there will be eventual success, human desires are easily caught, the danger is great; better to suffer some hardship now, till your merit be perfected, then pass through one cycle of rebirth, so that nothing can easily afflict you, and you will avoid much danger. Is this not to do one labour for lasting ease? Young master, know that this is no chance matter, but your master’s deep thought, prudence, and thorough arrangement, that such concessions are made!"

Hearing this, Immortal Sun was yet more deeply grateful, utterly devoted, and could not but weep aloud, saying: "My master is so concerned for me; I know not how I can repay in the future!" Sanjie comforted him: "Since you understand your master’s care, you should know her earnest wishes. We disciples, so long as we do not disappoint our master’s hopes, have done right by her. Could your master need repayment from us?" Immortal Sun tearfully agreed, and asked Sanjie: "Where now shall I go?" Sanjie laughed: "For the present, to Mount Xiqi to see the master and receive further instructions; probably your affairs are not yet finished, and my assistance may yet be needed." Immortal Sun said: "That is natural. I am the one whom Sanjie has raised and looked after; so long as my merit is not complete, her concern is not ended; this is certain." Sanjie laughed: "Not so! I know not about other matters, but it is certain that after a thousand years I must find a Daoist friend for you, to serve as priest for your mother’s ritual. This I already know!" Immortal Sun asked no more, and saw her out of the cave. For she was sent by the master to instruct him and could not be treated as an ordinary fellow disciple; he therefore accompanied her with respect and knelt to see her out of sight before returning to his cave.

Sanjie arrived at Xiqi and presented herself before Master Wenmei. The master was pleased with her careful management and from that day received her as a disciple, giving her the Dharma name “Tonghui” (Penetrating Wisdom). Tonghui expressed thanks and continued at the master’s side to serve. The master instructed her to go once every few decades to Tiantai to inspect Immortal Sun’s cultivation.

After five hundred years, the master personally descended to Tiantai, teaching Immortal Sun the great Dao of refining qi and burning elixirs, and bestowed two celestial scrolls containing the five elements’ evasion methods and all transformations and applications, summoning generals and dispatching spirits, subduing demons and monsters. After a hundred years’ practice, the master ordered him to tour the various places and widely establish merit, to lay the foundations for his present life and form good karmic connections for the next. After several hundred more years, his Dao was complete. The master, with wise heart quietly working, already knew that Sun Jie had been incarnated more than ten times, and after more than a thousand years, passing through the Xia and Shang dynasties, was now born into a wealthy Zhang family in Luoyang, aged forty and without offspring. He therefore ordered Immortal Sun to descend as his son, to fulfill a long-cherished vow from a thousand years past.

This man surnamed Zhang was called Tiancheng; he begot one son, simply named Guo. That Zhang Guo was the former Sun Immortal Sun. Owing to deep karmic roots, he was born able to speak and unusually intelligent. At about ten years old, he was sent a female Daoist crowned by Master Wenmei and Tonghui for guidance. Zhang Guo was immediately awakened. Zhang Tiancheng was a lifetime lover of goodness, enjoying unbroken blessings for ten or more lives. His joy in having Zhang Guo as son was full. Tonghui feared that he might obstruct Zhang Guo’s cultivation in the future, and also thought that having cultivated merit for a thousand years without turning back, he might grow ever lower and finally fall into the sea of suffering. So in instructing Zhang Guo she brought a few admonitions.

Zhang Tiancheng understood the cause and effect of former lives, and seeing Tonghui’s movements like clouds and mist, and her boundless magical power, deeply believed in the existence of true immortals. Immortals were also made by mortals; he greatly rejoiced that his son was born with immortal roots, and thinking of himself, feared that when his blessings were fulfilled he might suffer in reincarnation. He therefore resolved to cultivate the Way, often speaking this intention to Tonghui. Tonghui joyfully said: "A layman blessed with an immortal son had a former immortal affinity; if he also believes in the Way himself, his accomplishment will certainly be considerable." She also imparted some secret formulas of cultivation to him. Father and son, united in purpose, jointly fostered the Daoist thought. Tiancheng also distributed part of his family wealth to the poor; after his wife, the birth mother of Zhang Guo, had passed, Zhang Guo received Tonghui’s instructions to meet with Tiancheng and proceed to the Huai waters, to settle the great case of the snail spirit.

Though young in years, Zhang Guo’s cultivation of former lives was like a child who had already read the books; growing up he needed only slight review to apply it. Unlike his father, who was a beginner in immortal formulas and had no merit, relying entirely on instruction. The father and son and Tonghui agreed to meet in Huaihai Village. Tonghui also went to thank the Dragon King for his thousand-year protection. In the last five hundred years, Luo Yuan’s power had grown; she often went out into the sea. Seeing water creatures in danger, she strove to assist them. Once, on the Huai River, a band of merchants going abroad encountered a sudden gale just outside the sea mouth; the ship with twenty or so aboard nearly capsized. Luo Yuan happened to be out roaming, and seeing this, hastened to use her snail shell to prop up the bottom of the ship, bearing its weight and saving more than twenty lives. Yet owing to this exposure, she was noticed by fellow evil dragons, and a steel whip was fiercely used to pursue her. Luo Yuan, seeing the pursuer close, was struck upon by the steel whip; though slow to strike, swift to arrive was a sea god who came to her aid, wielding a mixed-gold cudgel to block the blow. After a bloody battle, the fiend was driven off, and Luo Yuan returned to the sea bottom.

Later Luo Yuan’s cultivation was near completion; she made her stubborn shell into an undersea cavern dwelling. For hundreds of li around, brilliant multicoloured light shone forth. Many demons thought a great treasure had appeared in the sea, and came to attack. Fortunately, the Dragon King had beforehand warned her and sent three thousand divine soldiers to guard the entrance to Huaihai Village, so all was safe. Such old friendships were indeed rare.

At this time Tonghui arrived at the Crystal Palace and presented herself before the Dragon King. The Dragon King already knew her purpose and hastened to express thanks for her labors. Tonghui smiled and said: "I am but a humble Daoist come specially to thank the Dragon King’s old friend; how is it that the King first thanks me for my toil?" The Dragon King laughed: "We mutually aid old friends; how can there be thanks? I have heard that Luo Yuan, following the master’s instructions, has erected a Daoist altar in her newly built cavern dwelling; pray who is the presiding master?" Tonghui answered: "This matter was long ago settled by my master five hundred years since; it is to be led by a lame-footed Daoist surnamed Li. This man and the King’s noble old friend have some direct and indirect karmic ties. The lame immortal’s former life was a fragrant officer at the Jade Emperor’s court; owing to careless speech, he told a joke to a flower attendant at the banquet of longevity, and both were punished to descend through ten cycles of reincarnation. That flower immortal was first born as the wife of the King’s old friend Immortal Sun, also the present Luo Yuan’s daughter-in-law, now erecting the altar. These two exiled immortals have passed through ten cycles of reincarnation. Now that their term is fulfilled, if they remain true to their nature and attain the upright fruit, they may return to the celestial bureau, receiving new honours, not merely their original posts. The Heavenly Heart is most compassionate; the former punishment was by Heaven’s law, beyond remedy. Seeing their ten lives as mortals, all loyal, kind, and filial, the holy heart is greatly moved. Therefore it is expected their accomplishment will surpass that of the present fairy born in Jiangnan surnamed He, recently born. The fragrant officer now is born in Henan, surname Li, said to be a descendant of the Patriarch Laozi’s clan. The Patriarch, since Pangu, often reincarnates among men. In the past hundred years he was reborn in Kuxian, taking Master Wenshi as disciple. It happened that the fragrant officer was born the tenth incarnation; the Patriarch sent Wenshi to instruct and care for him. Thus this Li immortal’s attainment was swift, a marvel unknown to other cultivators. The Patriarch has taken him as disciple, keeping him in his own school. This man’s future is truly boundless! The indirect immortal affinity of Zhang Guo and Immortal Sun comes from Immortal Sun’s wife, the flower immortal."

The Dragon King nodded and smiled: "Indeed! I know well the flower immortal’s nine reincarnations, and have rendered some slight service to her!" Tonghui had no time to inquire further, but continued: "Though this is of little account, in immortal regulations any small relation between two parties is called affinity. Therefore the lame immortal and the present Zhang Guo may be said to have some slight prior affinity." The Dragon King laughed and agreed. He added: "To make a Daoist altar inside a snail shell is indeed a marvel unprecedented through the ages. After all, the immortal arts have wondrous uses, differing from all else. Such a grand occasion, I suppose Master Wenmei and many immortal officials will attend. I too must personally come to join this rare and precious festival! But I wonder if the date is fixed?" Tonghui said: "The date is not yet determined; probably when their own people have agreed, I shall invite the priest to come, and then the ceremony will open. Then, though the King may be busy, we will certainly come to make a strong invitation." Thereupon all laughed together.

When Tonghui had finished speaking, she parted from the Dragon King and hastened to Huaihai Village. There she saw the village changed greatly. Formerly it was a desolate place where fish and shrimp would not come; now, because the snail shell shone forth, all water creatures with some slight cultivation came from countless thousands of li to see the marvel. At the same time waterborne merchants accustomed to trade came to set up a marketplace. In less than ten years, the once desolate Huaihai Village was transformed into a bustling sea market. Tonghui, seeing this, could not help nodding in approval. Presently she arrived at the cavern dwelling made from Luo Yuan’s stubborn shell. The cave house was built in the shape of the original snail shell, its entrance a large round gate leading inside with winding and twisting passages, leading to a small rear door. The gates were also round. The cavern was very spacious, able to accommodate several thousand occupants. Luo Yuan had fully become human in form, and lived in a central room. The house was divided into three chambers, with corridors on either side connecting front and back. As for utensils and furnishings inside, though not very rich, they were elegant and distinctive. Tonghui thought: according to this arrangement, it is quite suitable for inviting many immortals.

While inspecting the place here and there, the attendants in the cave had already noticed her and swiftly reported. Inside, Luo Yuan herself went forth first, followed by Tiancheng and son, all welcoming her together. Gentle reader may wish to know how a Daoist altar is made inside a snail shell, who the lame immortal is, and what his relation to Patriarch Laozi might be; but as these matters are very strange and the story too long, they cannot be told in one or two short intervals. It will be necessary to lay aside this table and begin anew, that the story may be orderly and clear. Gentle readers, please be patient, and refrain from rash blame on the writer for withholding the secrets!
