# Chapter Nineteen: Enduring Perils in the Quest for Immortality; Seeking the Way but Meeting Demons

Now it happened that Li Xuan was borne forth beyond the city walls by the Golden Star of Tai Bai, conveyed by a flash of golden light to a certain place. His body had but just touched the ground when he opened his eyes and beheld, "Ah! This is a place I have never before visited." The Golden Star of Tai Bai had already vanished to some unknown direction, leaving him alone standing in the midst of a bustling thoroughfare thronged with people. Collecting his thoughts, he knew that Tai Bai’s bringing him hither must needs have some purpose. Though the scene before his eyes was vague and without clear refuge, he trusted that hereafter a resting-place would be found. So he took heart, enlarged his courage, and with steady step went forward. Asking a question or two, he learned that he had arrived at the northern side of Mount Hua, some several hundred li distant from his home in Luoyang. Li Xuan knew this to be a subtle device of the immortals, and marvelled exceedingly. He rejoiced, for from childhood he had heard of the venerated immortal master Li Laojun of Mount Hua, who likewise had a grotto abode there. Now that the immortal had brought him to this place, it must be to point out the path to the immortals, sparing him from wandering blindly abroad. Reflecting thus, he looked upward, placing his hand on his brow, as a token of thanks.

Presently he felt a flush throughout his body, hot sweat soaking him; in his heart he was much perplexed. Could it be that the climate here was hotter than in the Central Plain? Moreover, he had but newly left Luoyang, where at home he had not required more than cotton garments for warmth; and Huayin was not far distant—how could the season change so suddenly? While pondering thus, a certain old man appeared before him, scanning him from head to foot, and smilingly asked, "Young sir, in such sultry summer weather you yet wear cotton garments—are you not ill at ease in your body? You see, this old man is several times older than you, and yet wears but a single layer; compared with you, the difference is great indeed."

Then Li Xuan understood: it was at the time of Great Heat. It need not be said that the Golden Star of Tai Bai, not only possessed the art of shrinking space, but was also able to abolish time—this, indeed, was the wondrous way of the immortals, who could wrest from heaven and earth the powers of creation. He sighed in admiration. Then again he reflected that the changes of seasons, though marked by months and quarters, cold and heat, winter and summer, were in truth but moments on moments; that a human life, even if extended to a hundred years, was but a fleeting instant when recalled from childhood to old age. Deeply pondering thus, he could not but heave a sigh. Not wishing to reveal the cause of his thoughts to others, he gave only vague and evasive replies, and hurriedly took leave of the old man. Fearing that his clothing was ill suited to the season and might attract attention, and also feeling the heat oppressive, he dared not walk again in the busy street, but chose some secluded and shady path. His foremost thought was to prepare a set of summer clothes, that he might move without hindrance. Fortunately, he felt no hunger, and so went on towards the wilderness.

Having walked some distance and left the market far behind, he took off the cotton outer garment and carried it in his hand, feeling lighter and less burdened as he went. The sunlight grew dim, evening smoke arose, and he wished to find a lodging for the night, that he might also inquire about the path over Mount Hua; yet no dwellings appeared.

In his perplexity, he suddenly saw a young herdsman boy, holding a short flute and riding a cow, singing and playing as he went towards the deep forest of the mountain. Li Xuan rejoiced, saying, "Where there is a herdsman boy, there must be a village near. Let me ask." So he advanced respectfully and addressed the boy as "Brother Herdsman." The boy did not dismount, but smiled and asked, "Whither go you, young sir? From whence do you come? What questions have you to ask me?" Li Xuan explained his purpose and asked where he might find lodging. The boy laughed and said, "See now, all around are hills and wilds, no village to be found. But my home lies behind the mountain; I watch over the forest for my family. My father also tends this cow, and every day sends me out to feed it a little grass. If you have no place to go, come with me and stay the night; to start fresh in the morning is easy enough." Li Xuan was glad, saying, "I would not have guessed, Brother Herdsman, that you were so kind." The boy leapt down from the cow, holding the reins with both hands, and said, "Come along, young sir!" Li Xuan thanked him repeatedly and followed, passing round the mountain and through the woods, winding their way. On the way he asked the boy’s surname. The boy said, "My name is Wang, and all call me Wang Xiao’er. My father is Wang Daguan. He is now old and seldom goes out; but when travellers come to lodge, he is always glad." Li Xuan was the more pleased.

Before long they reached behind the mountain. There stood a small thatched hut by a stream, and from afar Li Xuan saw a middle-aged man leaning on the door. The herdsman said, "That is my father." Li Xuan hastened forward and saluted, "I greet you!" The boy spoke for him, explaining the purpose of his lodging. Wang Daguan rejoiced, saying, "You are a noble gentleman, rare indeed to come this way, a true honoured guest!" He bade the boy quickly tether the cow and take the gentleman’s clothes, while he himself took Li Xuan’s hand into the grass hut, ordering his son to prepare tea.

Wang Xiao’er smiled, holding the clothes, and said, "No wonder my father said he was a gentleman. See how exquisite these clothes are! Do even the wealthiest households in the village dress so finely?" Li Xuan understood the reason they called him 'gentleman,' and laughed, saying, "Much obliged to you, old sir and young sir, for your concern! If you like these clothes, I will gladly present them to you." Wang Daguan hastened to refuse, "That cannot be; do not speak of receiving gifts without merit. I have dwelt here for decades and never used such finery. Small households living too comfortably not only lose blessings but invite misfortune. Xiao’er, quickly put these clothes away and keep them clean; go make tea and cook the meal, and do not stand here talking so much!" Xiao’er was first pleased, but when his father spoke thus, he puckered his lips and laughed softly, "I knew your old temper; you would never accept gifts." Saying this, he laughed and departed.

Li Xuan, hearing these words, both smiled and was surprised—surprised that a mountain-dwelling elder should hold such views, and amused by the child’s simple innocence. As he pondered, Wang Daguan asked about his journey. Seeing the man honest and unwilling to conceal, Li Xuan truthfully told him all, and inquired of the path to Mount Hua.

Wang Daguan, hearing this, showed no surprise, but nodded and smiled, saying, "This is indeed joyful; young sir, though so young, you have great resolve. Were it not for some foundation in a former life, how could you have reached such a stage? As for Mount Hua, it stretches more than three thousand li, with eighty-one peaks and thirty-six grottoes; tradition holds that every grotto has its immortal. The highest peak to the north is the Peak of Observing the Sun; to the south lies the Purple Mist Cave, where the venerable Old Lord once refined his elixirs. Even now, he often visits; we woodcutters in the mountains often encounter an old Daoist who talks with them of past and present. He speaks of affairs of former and later dynasties, yet asks about recent happenings. Sometimes, after long discourse, he shares pears, dates, peaches, and apricots with them. Those who eat these find their steps lighter by tenfold when descending the mountain, and suffer no illness throughout life, living longer than others. Therefore, it is said, 'He is an immortal.' Others say, 'He is the primordial Immortal Lord Laojun.' This tale has been told for over a hundred years. Since then, those who believe in immortality and seek the Way come from afar to visit the mountain. Some go and never return; some go and come back. Those who never return are said to have met Laojun who guided them beyond the world. Some disbelieve in such easy attainment of immortality, and say they were devoured by tigers, wolves, or poisonous insects—these are unsupported tales. Who is truth and who is false, none can say. Those who return, needless to say, find no path through the high mountains, or meet dangers and turn back in fear; this is no wonder. Speaking of no other place, my own humble abode here lies in a remote part of the mountain, and few travellers come this way. Yet in twenty years, I have met two or three who sought the immortals—some returned, some did not. My place lies on the main road to upper Mount Hua; all who ascend the mountain must pass here, so such travellers are often seen. Now, young sir, you have left home to travel afar, and have been led by a true immortal; surely you have affinity with the immortals, and will meet the venerable master. I myself once met a strange man who gave me ten golden pills, said to resist hunger and cold and guard against poison and evil spirits. Since then, I have not encountered noxious things in the mountains and forests; this is the benefit of the pills. I have given many away, and have but two left. Since you are going up the mountain, you must guard against such harm. Take these two!"

Li Xuan was overjoyed, hastening to bow down, and said, "If these elixirs possess such great efficacy, I accept one to protect myself. But it is not right to take all; I would leave one for you, old sir, to aid the world and save men." Wang Daguan, hearing this, was delighted, and said, "Those to whom I have given pills always want more, as if they could satisfy hunger and endure cold by them. Though a small matter, it shows that where there is self, there is no charity; greed never dies. Such men have no affinity with immortality. But hearing your noble words, I see your benevolent heart; you will surely succeed. I shall await your good tidings below the mountain."

Thus he gave one pill to Li Xuan. Li Xuan took it hastily, scrutinizing it carefully; the pill was golden in colour, lustrous as cinnabar, as small as a mustard seed, yet harder than steel—a rare and precious treasure. His face lit with joy as he thanked him many times, and treasured it for the future. Xiao’er brought tea, and Li Xuan drank a mouthful, then asked again about the path up the mountain. Wang Daguan said, "The ascent is easy, but the immortal path is hard to find. For one with your affinity, the way is open; you need not trouble yourself." Li Xuan bowed again to acknowledge his teaching. Wang Daguan laughed, "You are too courteous, young sir! I am but a simple mountain man; there is no need for thanks." Li Xuan replied earnestly, "Though penniless, I esteem uprightness. Every word you have spoken is a statute for me; I will engrave it on my heart and never forget it. One word of thanks cannot suffice." Wang Daguan was pleased.

Li Xuan stayed a night at their home. Early the next morning he rose, and asked Wang Daguan to exchange his clothes for money, that he might buy a single garment and prepare much dry food. All arranged, evening was near, and Li Xuan wished to set forth. The father and son urged him to stay another night, saying the journey would be easier starting at dawn. Li Xuan smiled and said, "The true immortal is above, and I should go to pay respect. The mountain journey is no one or two days’ matter; there will be nights when I must lodge outside. What need to linger over this night?" Seeing his resolve, they gave way, and sent Xiao’er to escort him a little way, showing him the path into the mountain before returning.

Li Xuan’s heart was resolute in seeking the Way, and he proceeded according to the path. At first the way was level, but grew increasingly steep. Each day he travelled from dawn till nightfall. When he found a cave, he would lodge there; when hungry, he ate dry food; when thirsty, he drank from mountain springs. At times he encountered mountain spirits and wild beasts, which he avoided beforehand. Sometimes he came to lofty peaks and sheer cliffs, but he climbed and surmounted them. The journey was not completed in a day; the deeper he entered the mountain, the more towering the peaks. Looking back down, nothing was visible; looking up, the heights pierced the clouds, and he knew not where they led. His dry food was but enough for a few days, but he cared little, encouraging himself onward without hesitation.

At dusk one day, he came to a place of tangled ridges and hills, and lost his way, uncertain how to proceed. While hesitating, he suddenly perceived a foul stench, so rank as to make one sick. As the wind blew, from behind the woods emerged a Daoist, white-bearded and white-haired, with a solemn mien. Li Xuan was greatly startled, saying, "On the road hitherto, for many days I have not seen a soul; how comes this Daoist? I have heard the elder say, ‘The venerable Old Lord often transforms into a mortal and talks with woodcutters.’ Now seeing this man, lofty and full of immortal spirit, here in these deep mountains, no mortal could come; he must be an immortal—no doubt."

He straightened his clothes and advanced with measured steps, bowing to the Daoist and tearfully saying, "Disciple Li Xuan, from home in Luoyang, by the guidance of an immortal master, has come from south to north, ascending the mountain to seek the master. Along the way I have not feared wind or dust, nor spared hardship. Now fortunate to meet the immortal master, my humble heart is not in vain. I earnestly pray the master to show compassion and receive me, that I may attain the true fruit of the Way, soon escape the net of the world, and am full of trembling gratitude!" The Daoist, hearing these words and seeing his state, laughed heartily and said, "Are you Li Xuan? I have waited for you long! Since you have such sincerity and come undaunted by peril, you must be one with great affinity for the Way. I may receive you as disciple and transmit to you the great Way of the Golden Elixir." Li Xuan was overjoyed, prostrated himself several times, and rose. The Daoist commanded, "Come with me now to the grotto! I will teach you the method of cultivation."

Li Xuan answered "Yes" many times, and reverently followed the Daoist. They passed around a hillock, crossed a mountain slope, and came to a forest blocking the way. The Daoist pointed, saying, "Beyond this forest lies a flat place, below which are three grotto chambers—this is where I cultivate the truth." Li Xuan looked up and indeed saw at the forest’s end a broad open space. The Daoist hastened forward a few steps, came out of the woods, crossed the flat, and went down the slope, revealing a scene of surpassing beauty. Pine and bamboo branches interlaced, strange flowers covered the ground, and a fragrant breeze stirred the senses.

The Daoist led Li Xuan into the grotto and sat down in the centre. Li Xuan entered and bowed eight times. The Daoist called aloud, "Where are you, little demons?" At once many hairy, shaggy, half-human, half-beast creatures, numbering seven or eight score, came into the cave and bowed. Li Xuan looked on in wonder.

The Daoist, smiling broadly, said, "Since you seek the Way and desire to ascend to heaven, though you have affinity, you have not yet shed your mortal form. Such a body, sullied with dust and filth, is unfit to ascend, unworthy to see the Emperor; even to ride clouds and drive mist is a thousand-fold difficulty." Li Xuan wept and bowed, saying, "Disciple knows his root and conduct are shallow; therefore he braves danger, enduring cold and hunger, to seek the master. Fortunate to meet the teacher’s pity and rescue, so as not to betray my sincere heart. I earnestly pray the master to show the way and remove my confusion; I would be most blessed." The Daoist laughed, saying, "To shed the mortal body and change the bones—that is no easy matter. If you meet an incompetent immortal, even if he teaches you a thousand years, you remain but Li Xuan. Now you have met this poor Daoist; this is your good fortune. I have here a clever and simple method; with but half a day’s work, I can cleanse your mortal body and bone completely. Are you willing?"

Li Xuan, hearing this, was both surprised and glad, and hastened to plead, "Disciple came for this; to obtain the Way would be great fortune; how could I refuse?" The Daoist said, "Now that it is so, little demons, prepare a pot quickly; take this newly arrived brother and wash him clean, put him in the pot to steam until soft, add scallion, garlic, and spices. I will consume him, and when he excretes his excrement, that is his soul; add cultivation and he will become the Great Way."

The little demons, hearing this, hurried to seize Li Xuan. At this he was so terrified that it seemed as if Buddha himself had been born. He cried out, "Master, what mean these words?" The Daoist shouted, "If you would shed the mortal body and change the bones, how else but thus?" Li Xuan tried to plead, but the little demons would not hear, and rushed him forth, carrying him like a hog to the rear of the cave. There was a vast kitchen, from whose walls hung many human legs and heads, beast tails and bird bodies. Beside it was a great stove. The little demons stripped Li Xuan naked, one fetched water, another kindled fire, and several guarded him to prevent escape.

Here Li Xuan repented having been so deceived, thinking, "What lofty purity has an immortal grotto, that so many strange and improper creatures dwell therein? Even the Daoist’s speech and conduct are coarse and base, not like one who has attained the Dao. Before meeting this Daoist, I clearly smelt a strange stench, which came from him! I was careless to mistake him for an immortal master, and so cast myself into a trap; truly, I seek death for myself! Pity my sincere heart, enduring many dangers, only to give my body as a delicacy to demons." Reflecting thus, tears fell. The little demons, seeing him weep, gathered round, clapping hands and stamping feet in joy.

Li Xuan was deeply grieved, but suddenly changed his mind: "Those who seek the Way, when first apprenticed, must undergo trials, to test if they are fit for immortality. Now that I have come to Mount Hua, the immortal master is in sight, the immortal realm not far off, how could demons dare to appear and cause mischief? Perhaps some immortal teacher has set this trap to test my courage and perseverance in seeking the Way. If so, I need not show weakness or fear for a little danger. Besides, now that things have come to this, even if misfortune befalls, could my tears turn the hearts of these demons? No. With this thought, I clench my teeth, close my eyes and smile, and stand firm to await being put in the pot."

Presently he heard the little demons cry, "The water boils! Quickly put this thing into the pot!" Seven or eight little demons clamoured and lifted Li Xuan. Now he resolved to die in earnest, to show his sincerity. Not fearing, he even wished to be put in the pot at once, to escape the mortal world. If the immortals looked upon him kindly, they would surely know his heart, and if he might be reborn a man, then cultivation would be easier. To face peril might be but a help to his next life. Therefore, with a smile he let them carry him.

At the boiling cauldron, the little demons were short of stature and strained to lift Li Xuan to the brim, but could not put him in. Li Xuan laughed, "You foolish creatures! Can you not manage this small matter? You have wasted many human bodies; is that not unjust?" The demons were greatly amazed, saying, "This man was just now so frightened; now he speaks such arrogant words. In a moment, his courage has grown so great—this is a rare thing." One little demon said, "You cannot escape our great king’s mouth. Since you speak thus, you must have some clever means to save us some trouble. Why not lend a hand and save us difficulty? You might then soon return to heaven, and be spared fright—that would be two gains at once." Li Xuan laughed, "Little devils, you are pert. Very well, I do wish to return to heaven soon, so it will save you trouble." Turning to the demons, he said, "Set me down; I will crawl up the pot’s edge and jump in myself." The demons thought he could not escape, and all smiled brightly, saying, "This gentleman is both clever and brave; a fine fellow indeed." Li Xuan paid them no heed, stripped off, leapt to the pot’s edge, and jumped down.

Then was heard a humming sound, and boiling water splashed around. How fared the life of Li Xuan? That we shall relate in the next chapter.
