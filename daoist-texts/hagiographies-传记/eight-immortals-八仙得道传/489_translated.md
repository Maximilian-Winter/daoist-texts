# Chapter 21: At Sun-Watching Peak, the Demons Taken as Servants; The Female Monster of Purple Mist Cave Seizes the Scripture

Now it came to pass that the Old Master beheld Li Xuan, whose spirit was graceful and noble, his brows and eyes bright and clear; and in his heart he was glad. He bade him sit down and asked, “Li Xuan, though thou knowest the matters of thy former life, yet perchance thou hast not a clear remembrance of them.” Li Xuan replied, “Your disciple is dull and ignorant, not yet understanding this present life; how could I know the former one? I earnestly implore the Patriarch to instruct me!” The Old Master nodded assent, and bade his boy bring a bowl of pure water. With his own hand he traced a talisman, and bade Li Xuan take it and look upon it. Li Xuan held it in his hands and looked long; anon he saw the Heavenly Palace above, where all the immortals were gathered in order, partaking of drink; the officials of incense and the fairy-maidens of flowers, by their laughter and play incurred fault; the Jade Emperor came down with punishment; the ten times of descent to the mortal world, all were shown to him, and his heart became instantly clear. He returned the bowl of water and bowed his thanks to the Old Master.

The Old Master smiled and said, “Now thou mayest know that in thy former life thou hadst this foundation; in this life thy enlightenment is early, and thou art guided by the Golden Star. In a moment thou hast come to my gate. Those who have attained the Way have not been so swift before. One reason is that thy good fortune is not shallow; another is that thou wast once an immortal official, though in a low place, yet thy root and capacity were indeed unlike others; and though ten lives as a mortal thou hast had no fault, and hast alone won the pity of Heaven’s heart; thirdly, though thy body has fallen into the net of dust, thou hast not been sullied by a speck, verily thou hast an ancient root, not by chance. But the work of cultivating the Way is as vast as the smoke upon the sea, and one knows not where it ends. Thou hast now but taken the first step into the gate, entered the hall and chamber; the path is still far off, and henceforth thy merit and conduct depend wholly upon thyself. Though thou hast fortune and destiny, thou canst not succeed by a single bound.”

Li Xuan bowed again to receive instruction, and said, “Your disciple is but a rustic and humble man of the wilds and springs. Since in my former life I have incurred fault, how dare I neglect self-effort in this life? Moreover, by the grace of the Patriarch who opened Heaven and Earth and pointed the way to awakening, I dare not be self-conceited. Having such good fortune, I ought to strive with care and self-restraint; how could I again act negligently, and so mislead my future, while also bearing the debt of Master Yin’s cultivation and the favour of the Golden Star’s guidance?” The Old Master nodded and then imparted instruction, saying, “The essence of the Supreme Way is deep and dark; the utmost of the Supreme Way is dim and silent. Without the Way there is nothing; embrace the spirit and be tranquil. When the form is adjusted of itself, it is certain to be pure and clear. Do not weary thy form; do not scatter thy essence; do not be intimate with thy nature; cease anxieties and cares; thus mayst thou attain longevity.” Li Xuan knelt to receive the doctrine, and his heart blossomed as flowers, the dust of worldly feeling melting away. The Old Master then spoke: “Those who cultivate the Way must often wander among mountains and waters, to cleanse the heart and breast; must do many good deeds to strengthen good fruit. Now first I confer the secret methods of breathing and swallowing; the arts of guiding and drawing; and the three volumes of the Daoist scriptures — the upper and middle volumes can call wind and rain, drive clouds and mist, summon divine troops, and bring down thunder and lightning; the lower volume can exhaust the marvels of transformation and discern the matters to come. From this time forth, thou mayest go alone to Mount Hua. There is my abode of cultivation, at Sun-Watching Peak, called Purple Mist Cave. But now there are many demons and devils; I entrust to thee a precious sword. When used, it lengthens; rolled up it is as fine as a thread; released it may reach ten thousand li; gathered back it is close at hand. Except for the true immortals of the upper realm, none can withstand the edge of this sword. With it thou canst expel demons and protect thyself from disaster.” Thereupon he gave Li Xuan the incantation for wielding the sword, and the three volumes of the scriptures, handing them over together.

Li Xuan knelt on the ground, and took careful note of all. The Old Master ordered the boy to fetch a Taoist robe from the inner cave, a Taoist cap, and silk ribbons, shoes, socks, and such like — all complete — and bade Li Xuan put them on at once. When Li Xuan had dressed, his spirit appeared more and more ethereal. The Old Master smiled and said, “Now thou art truly like a scattered immortal; go thy way! I will cause thy senior brother, Wen Shi, to escort thee back to the cave. After three years, when thy功夫 is completed, thou mayest come again to see me.” Thereupon Li Xuan bowed his head in obedience. Wen Shi took him out of the cave, and bore him on clouds to the Purple Mist Cave on Mount Hua.

At parting Wen Shi, Li Xuan knelt and besought further instruction. Wen Shi said, “The essential Way has already been fully pointed out by the Patriarch; thou art clever and hast already apprehended it; all other immortal arts are contained in the scriptures; laboriously seek and obtain them. Thy humble elder brother can only offer thee some small trifles, as a token of congratulation upon thy entering the cave.” He thereupon took out a small mirror and said, “Hang this at the gate, and it shall be crystal clear, no different in dark night than in daylight; and demons and ghosts will not easily approach.” He also imparted the method of freezing the body in place. Should demons assail thee, and thou hast no great skill, employ this freezing method, and thou wilt be immobilized. Li Xuan greatly rejoiced and received it with reverence. Wen Shi further said, “Thou art newly come into the mountains; all thy movements still depend on the help of others. Thy humble elder brother will send two servants for thee, to be at thy command.”

Li Xuan wondered, “Where shall we find men in this wild mountain?” Wen Shi laughed and said, “Look about this place; can ordinary mortals ascend here? The reason why thou art as usual is twofold: first, thy root and capacity differ, thou hast immortal bones; second, when thou didst ascend the mountain, the great official Wang presented thee with a golden pill, and so thou couldst endure hunger and cold without feeling fatigue. This pill was made by immortals, through the aid of official Wang to help the Daoist path; it is not like ordinary medicine. If thou dost not believe, thou hast been in the mountains many days, and hast come and gone on Kunlun for many years in the mortal world, how hast thou not felt hunger or cold? This is the effect of the pill! Yet its power is limited, and after so many days it will soon be gone. Thou canst not yet wholly leave behind the mortal world. I have sought among the nearby mountain demons for those who have some immortal fate, and have summoned two to serve thee. They will attend thee, and can somewhat obey thy commands. If thou hast need, within a thousand li or so about Mount Hua, they themselves can fetch what is required.” Li Xuan, still not free from mortal ties, feared hunger and hardship in guarding the ancient cave; hearing this, he was exceedingly glad.

Wen Shi led Li Xuan out of the cave, and by a finger-seal summoned the local earth god, and asked, “Is there any demon near this place?” The old earth god bowed and answered, “Since the time of the Old Lord Patriarch’s departure, this mountain and its fore and back ranges have been disturbed by a band of demons. The most fierce are a rabbit spirit and a pheasant monster. The rabbit spirit often takes the form of a man, descending the mountain to beguile women and suck out their essence; the pheasant spirit often takes the form of a woman, descending the mountain to entice men and seize their vital yang. In these years many have been harmed.” Wen Shi was angry and said, “This is my Patriarch’s place of cultivation; how can such beasts be suffered to make mischief?” The earth god wept and said, “Not only the mortals below the mountain, but even the earth gods here are disturbed by them!” Wen Shi gently admonished, “I will now seize this pheasant and rabbit demons, and place them in service to my junior brother. As for all other demons, with my brother here they will soon be gradually rooted out. He has newly come to this place with a resolute mind to cultivate the Way; if any accident or mischance befalls him, you all must unite to support and protect him. When his功行 is complete, ye shall have merit also.” The earth gods bowed and withdrew.

Li Xuan looked on with great admiration. Wen Shi smiled and said, “Those who cultivate the Way act for Heaven’s purpose. The immortals of the three realms all have the duty to save men and aid the world. If their hearts be upright and great, and their actions bright, really beneficial to men and harmless to principle, they will obey commands respectfully; at the call of talisman and incantation they will come promptly — this is nothing strange. If a private thought be fixed, or any improper act done, it is not easy to summon them. Even if they come by law, if their hearts be unwilling, and they meet a master of great power, they may repel the sword; even if they escape, their evil will be full, and they cannot escape Heaven’s punishment.” Li Xuan was solemnly instructed. Wen Shi laughed and said, “All these secret arts are contained in the Patriarch’s scriptures. Thou art clever beyond others; in less than a month thou canst learn many kinds. Since thou art now so admiring, I will first teach thee the secret of summoning spirits, which may also help to defend thyself and guard the Way.” Li Xuan greatly rejoiced and received, resolving it in his heart. Wen Shi further admonished, “Summoning spirits and dispatching generals is no child’s play; it must not be lightly used except in utmost emergency. When spirits and generals come, thou must be humble, reverent, and serious; a slight disrespect will anger Heaven, and thou must know that we and the spirits alike act for Heaven’s purpose, to save the world and aid men. They come when summoned, not because our rank is higher than theirs, but because each performs his duty and fulfills his task. If thou contemnest them lightly, Heaven’s anger will fall upon thee, and next time thou wilt not be able to summon them again.” Li Xuan said gravely, “Brother, thy golden words I engrave on my heart.” Wen Shi laughed, “That is well. Let us go to subdue the demons!” Li Xuan asked, “I regret not asking the earth god where those demons dwell.” Wen Shi laughed, “What matter is that? Why do we cultivate the wisdom eye? When thou wast in the Old Ox Cauldron, who called me there?” As they went forth from the cave, Wen Shi pointed ahead to a place among bamboo and trees and fallen withered leaves on the ground, and said, “It will be well to settle those two fellows! Only then will this be a true immortal cave of cultivation. In such disorder and filth, what sort of place is this?” Li Xuan was deeply moved.

Wen Shi and Li Xuan ascended the mountain peak; Wen Shi opened his wisdom eye and looked around. He pointed to the northeast and said, “Brother, dost thou see? There is a half-black, half-blue atmosphere; that must be where the demons hide.” Li Xuan could not see clearly, but having it explained, he thought the place’s air was indeed somewhat different. Wen Shi bade him, “Take good hold of the precious sword, and follow close behind me.” The two mounted clouds and rose. In a moment they were where the demonic aura was. They alighted on the cloud-head, and found themselves in a great mountain hollow. Behind it was a large cave, outside which many little demons tumbled and played. Seeing the two, they were greatly startled; some stared blankly; some fled into the cave to report to the demon leaders. Wen Shi pointed and said, “Presently the demons will come forth!”

No sooner had he spoken than a man and a woman arrived, leading many little demons, shouting and clamouring as they came out of the cave. When the two demons saw Wen Shi and his brother, the male demon said, “Respected sister, congratulations; here is thy food for mouth!” The female demon joyfully stepped forward and saluted, saying, “From whence come the two Daoist priests?” Wen Shi laughed and said, “We have specially come to save you!” The two demons laughed aloud and said, “This Daoist speaks so arrogantly. Since they have come here, they cannot even save themselves; how talk they of saving us?”

The male demon suddenly raised his head; seeing Li Xuan’s sword flashing, he shivered involuntarily, and whispered something to the female demon, who nodded. At a word they gave a signal, and instantly a thousand little demons swarmed upon the two and surrounded them. Wen Shi laughed loudly, and with Li Xuan each drew a precious sword and waved their hands. Strange indeed! Where the sword light arose, these thousand little demons instantly had their heads broken and bones shattered, one by one falling to the ground. The two demons were filled with anger, drew their weapons, and came to battle the two. Wen Shi bade Li Xuan step back one pace, and himself with sword advanced alone, battling the two demons. How could the two withstand him? They fled westward defeated. Wen Shi mounted clouds in pursuit. The two demons quickly opened their mouths and spewed forth a gush of blue smoke, so dense that neither could see the other, and with a strange foul stench that made Li Xuan faint and fall to the ground.

Wen Shi was greatly angered and shouted, “How can demons be so rude!” Opening his mouth he called out, and the blue smoke dispersed, and the stench vanished utterly. Wen Shi intoned incantations, and with a loud cry suddenly summoned a clear thunderclap. At once the thunder god and lightning goddess appeared in mid-air, bowing and entreating command. Wen Shi raised his hand and said, “Here are two demons, the rabbit and the pheasant, who trouble this place; I beseech the august gods to exert their power and cause them to reveal their true forms. But do not harm their lives; I have use for them elsewhere.” The thunder and lightning gods replied, “We obey the law!” Then a great thunderclap was struck upon the heads of the two demons. The demons felt the roar of thunder circling about their heads, but unable to descend, they were terrified and fainted, lying on the ground, crying, “Great Immortal, spare our lives!” Wen Shi shouted, “Wicked beasts, reveal your true forms and obey my commands!” The two demons rolled on the ground, one changed into a white rabbit; the other into a pheasant. Wen Shi asked, “Do ye, demons, accept my command?” They wailed and wept, “We only beg for mercy; we are willing to follow the Great Immortal, to hold whip and stirrup; if we rebel, may earth and heaven destroy us!”

Wen Shi withdrew the thunder and lightning, and commanded, “I now order you to serve my junior brother in the Purple Mist Cave at Sun-Watching Peak. Ye must be cautious and respectful and obey punctiliously. My junior brother is a heavenly immortal descended to the mortal world; now he receives the Patriarch’s precepts and cultivates here; soon he will attain perfect fruit. Then ye also will have fate and功行 not shallow.” The two demons joyfully bowed thanks. Wen Shi bade them assume human form again, and come forward to watch over Li Xuan. Li Xuan, much poisoned, was still unconscious. Wen Shi blew upon him and shouted, “Brother, arise! Thy humble elder brother has already secured two supervisors for thee.” Li Xuan was greatly glad and bowed thanks. Wen Shi said, “Thou mayest give them names, and call them as thou wilt.” Li Xuan said, “I pray thee, brother, bestow names.” Wen Shi pondered and said, “This pheasant spirit can fly in mid-air and soar over the sea — name him ‘Fei Fei’er’ (Flying Fellow). This rabbit spirit can climb hills and descend slopes, ascend trees and mount peaks — name him ‘Dian Dian’er’ (Tumbling Fellow).” Li Xuan and the two demons both thanked Wen Shi. Wen Shi sent them back to the cave, and instructed the two demons, “Serve faithfully; if ye change heart, I on Kunlun Mountain shall know at once, and smite thee with the Palm Thunder; thy bones shall turn to ashes immediately.” The two demons trembled and obeyed.

Wen Shi exhorted Li Xuan a few more words, saying, “We shall meet on Kunlun after three years!” With a kick of his legs, he vanished with a golden light, ascending to heaven; in a moment he was gone. The two demons prostrated themselves and said, “Today we are fortunate to meet a Golden Immortal!” Li Xuan said, “Henceforth ye must cleanse your hearts and follow me in cultivation. I shall also choose from the secret methods granted by the Patriarch some of the Way’s arts to teach you from time to time. When I succeed, I shall not forget your kindness!” Fei Fei’er and Dian Dian’er were all the more glad.

From that time on, Li Xuan diligently practiced day and night in the cave. The two demons fetched things from below the mountain, cooked meals, swept and cleaned the cave, and obeyed commands without the least neglect. Yet who knew that when Li Xuan recited the mysterious scriptures, at night they emitted strange light, shining far and wide, so that many demons suspected a great treasure and thought to attack and seize it.

One day, as Li Xuan was practicing, a woman came walking into the cave. She wore plain clothes, tears streaming down her face, crying aloud, “Master of the Way, save me!” Li Xuan fixed his mind and looked, but could not recognize her path or sect. He thought, “Ordinary folk cannot reach such deep mountains; surely this is a demon’s disguise.” Yet he considered, “Demons must have special circumstances. This woman is so delicate and fair, and I cannot lightly suspect her.” So he asked, “Young lady, whence comest thou? What grievance hast thou? Why dost thou not go to officials or magistrates, but come to this wild mountain seeking this poor Daoist? What good will that do?” The woman wept and said, “I am from the Wang family in the eastern village behind the mountain; my husband died more than a hundred days ago, and I cannot bear to remarry. But my in-laws are poor, and have sold me to a wealthy family. On the wedding night I refused to comply; the master of that family would have me put to death; I was forced to flee in the dead of night. Alas, the region behind the mountain is all under the power of the wealthy; I dared not escape there, so I fled up the mountain. Unwittingly I came higher and higher, and found myself here. Now I can neither go forward nor back, and fear the hungry tigers and wolves; I am utterly helpless. Happily I have met the Master of the Way cultivating here; if thou wilt not abandon me and take me to thy cave, to be a servant woman, it will be my utmost fortune.”

Li Xuan was greatly astonished: “How sayest thou such words! I, this poor Daoist, have passed through a world of suffering, and dwell in a place harsh for mortals to live. Though I still take food, it will not be long before I cut off all worldly ties. How can I provide for thee? Moreover, my little affairs here are handled by two disciples; where need is there for a mortal servant? Quickly go down the mountain, and trouble me no more!” The woman wept bitterly and said, “Cultivators of the Way prize benevolence and righteousness most; I also prize my reputation, and have thus met misfortune. If the Master will not save me, I can do naught but die. Better to die before the Master than in the hands of evil men.” Hearing this, Li Xuan’s heart was moved; he thought, “This woman’s sorrow is so piercing; surely her chastity is true. If I do not save her, shall I indeed sit by and see her die? If I save her, I must consult with Fei Fei and the others, send her beyond the mountain, many hundreds of li from her home, so that the evil men may not find her.”

Having thought thus, he said, “Arise, young lady. I cultivate here to establish body and destiny; I fear I have no time for worldly affairs. But seeing that thou truly art pure and praiseworthy, and thy case so pitiable, I cannot let thee go; by a special exception, I will let my disciples send thee down the mountain. Thou shalt seek a good family to serve, and so obtain some livelihood. What sayest thou?” The woman was glad and said, “If this be so, Master, thou art truly my life’s saviour!” Saying so, she would have bowed. Li Xuan hurriedly drew back and said, “Young lady, do not be so polite, or thou wilt make me uneasy. I will at once order men to send thee.” The woman said anxiously, “The night is late; the mountain path is rough; tigers, leopards, and poisonous creatures are everywhere. If harm should befall me, it would not be Master saving but Master harming me!” Li Xuan shook his head and said, “What wouldst thou have me do?” The woman said, “I have no other thought than to stay one night; if I depart early on the morrow, I shall be deeply grateful.” Li Xuan said quickly, “This cannot be! There is no place here for female guests; moreover, in this wild mountain and ancient cave, a lonely woman and a solitary man living together would cause suspicion! This is also to preserve thy reputation from harm. If one night’s lodging causes harm to thy good name, it will not be well for thee.” The woman said again, “Never mind; the Master said there are two disciples? Let them give up their rooms for me to sit the night; we shall be separated by room and door; what suspicion can there be? Heaven and the gods are witnesses; what fear of slander?”

Hearing her say this, Li Xuan was more troubled, and said, “Indeed! I have taken up another anxiety! These disciples of mine are not humans; they are the pheasant and rabbit spirits, cultivated into human form. The pheasant spirit is female; the rabbit spirit is male. I rely on the Patriarch’s power; they are newly taken into the school; I know not whether their wild nature can be tamed. Should they see the young lady’s youthful beauty, and do aught improper, I shall be more than unable to bear it! Young lady, do not doubt; I will at once command the pheasant disciple to send thee down the mountain. Though the young disciple is a strange being, he also has some magic; ordinary beasts will not dare approach thee. With her protection, what hast thou to fear?”

The woman saw Li Xuan resolute and unwilling; she stood motionless, but then used her bewitching arts to entice him, smiling sweetly, manifesting all manner of allure, and pressed close to Li Xuan, saying, “Master, art thou truly so cruel, to let thy slave venture by night through these long mountain paths?” This frightened Li Xuan with no place to hide; he shouted, “Fei Fei, Dian Dian, where are ye? Come quickly and save me!”

No sooner had he spoken than the woman flared up with rage and said, “Good! Li Xuan, thou art truly an ungrateful fool! I have shown thee kindness, and thou criest for help to capture me! Well then! I will not make trouble with thee; I will take away thy mysterious scriptures. If thou changest thy mind, I will be thy wife for ever; else I will burn thy scriptures first. I dwell in the White Jade Cave behind the mountain; I am the Lady of White Jade. If thou wouldst seek me, come thither!” Saying so, she snatched the scriptures from the stone table with one hand, pushed Li Xuan with the other, and with a gust of demon wind departed from the cave. By the time Fei Fei and Dian Dian arrived and went out with Li Xuan in pursuit, the traces were already all lost.

Whether the scriptures might be returned, we must look to the next chapter to know.
