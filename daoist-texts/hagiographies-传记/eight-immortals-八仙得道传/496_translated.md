# Chapter 28: The Snail Immortal Receives Mandate to Establish the Daoist Altar; The Clam Spirit Opens Its Belly to Entertain the Assembly of Demons

It is said that Master Iron Crutch, accompanied by Hui Tong, Dian, and Fei, four in all, waited until the four others at the rear arrived; the company then halted their cloud-step. But looking behind, they saw the four others arrayed in diverse robes of uneven length, their countenances fierce and their bodies large and formidable; at a glance it was clear they were not true Daoist immortals. Master Iron Crutch first raised his hand in salute towards them, and the four men, smiling faintly, returned the salute and asked the Master’s Daoist name and place of origin.

Master Iron Crutch spoke, then inquired of the four. The one in the centre, clad in a red Daoist robe and appearing as their leader, replied: “We poor Daoists are all from beyond the seas, refining Qi since the days of Yao and Shun until now; for the sake of leisure, we have not ascended to the Celestial Bureau. I am named ‘Lingxuzi’.” He then pointed to the man in green robe at the right, naming him ‘Tongxuánzi’, and then at the two in purple and blue robes behind, naming them ‘Mingmingzi’ and ‘Kōngkōngzi’. He said he had heard from the disciple of Wenmei Zhenren of Huaipai Village that a Snail Spirit had attained the Dharma Body and was about to establish a Daoist altar within his snail shell; this was to be a grand gathering of the sea, a rare occasion in a thousand ages, and thus he had specially invited his fellows to witness it.

Hui Tong, upon hearing this, signalled quietly with his eyes to Master Iron Crutch, who feigned ignorance and introduced the matter to Hui Tong and the others, omitting that Hui Tong was a disciple of Wenmei, only saying they had heard of the fame of the altar within the snail shell and had come to participate. The eight then united as one, parted the cloud road, and hastened onward. In but a short time they had reached the bank of the Huai River.

Master Iron Crutch, uncertain of the four’s magic power, bade them advance first. Lingxuzi, looking down on Iron Crutch for his unsightly appearance, nodded arrogantly and said to the other three: “We will go ahead by a step.” Thereupon he grasped the water-avoidance art and opened a broad path through the mighty billows.

The four others made no reply to Iron Crutch and company, but strode forth without looking back. Hui Tong and Fei Fei were enraged, saying: “These Daoists have no manners. We have been humble, yet they dare to treat us with disdain and arrogance. Since they are of an evil sect, surely no good will come of this. Rather than later suffer their treachery, why not take advantage now and overtake them, and with our Master’s flying sword slay them? Would that not be simpler and better?”

Master Iron Crutch laughed heartily: “My worthy brothers, though you have studied the Dao many years, still you are so impatient as to be no different from their arrogance and discourtesy. I now go by the directive of our Patriarch to preside over the Daoist altar; the responsibility is great. Against such heterodox demons we must devise measures of defence. Even in the extremity, the Patriarch and many elder brothers will come to aid — why resort to such ignoble pre-emptive strikes? Even if victorious, it would bring no honour; if defeated, how dare we face the Patriarch and friends abroad? Should the contest be equal, it would waste time and invite the Patriarch’s rebuke. The ancients said, ‘If small matters are not borne, great calamities will ensue.’ Remember well these words. In future, when facing adversity, never act rashly; carefully examine the circumstances. Fight if you may; if not, withdraw thrice the distance. Better to endure now and act with wisdom to preserve life. One may hope that in a hundred or a thousand years, the shame may be wiped away. But if one in a moment of anger risks life rashly, that is mere foolhardiness and not the way of the cultivator.”

Hui Tong, hearing this, was greatly impressed and thanked him repeatedly. Dian and Fei, however, still felt their Master had been too forbearing, and their anger was not yet quelled. Hui Tong smiled and comforted them on Iron Crutch’s behalf.

Master Iron Crutch said: “Those two are of strong character and quick to act in righteousness; they are indeed endowed with a chivalrous spirit from Heaven. I cherish them for this very reason, as they are the easiest for the Dao to approach. But excess of strength leads to injury; unless they exert themselves in such places, their years of Qi cultivation will be in vain. Sister, do not try to dissuade them; their learning and cultivation have not yet reached that point. Persuasion is fruitless. In a few years, they will surely have quelled their fiery temper, and then, without my saying, they will understand the delight of patience.” Hearing this, Fei and Dian’s spirits calmed; they laughed and said: “Our Master is always so considerate; we have often felt some resentment on his behalf. Now with his clear instruction, we must return and redouble our efforts to regulate our tempers; that will save much trouble.” Master Iron Crutch rejoiced greatly: “If you can say thus and harbour such intentions, it shows your current knowledge is not as before. What I have just said might seem shallow now.” The three laughed heartily.

Master Iron Crutch cast no incantations nor formed any hand seals; merely pointing his iron staff, there appeared before their eyes a shining, smooth, and level great road, extending from the riverbank directly to the head gate of Juexian Cavern in Huaipai Village. Master Iron Crutch led, and the three followed along this road. Most wondrous was that the road stretched on without end; in the time taken to eat a meal, they arrived at the cave’s entrance. Looking back, the road was nowhere to be seen. Hui Tong was full of admiration; Dian and Fei danced with delight. Iron Crutch then said to Hui Tong: “Do you know that those four Daoist fellows are so arrogant? I fear they are still on the way; it will be some time ere they arrive here.” Hui Tong nodded: “That is natural; though the Water Division art is not heterodox, how can it compare to the Master’s grand Dao?” Iron Crutch laughed: “There is an art of water flight even swifter than this, but Dian and Fei cannot follow.” Hui Tong agreed, and, being well versed, took the lead. When they reached the second tier, Zhang Guo and his son, as well as Juexian himself, all came forth to greet them. At sight of Iron Crutch, all prostrated themselves, and Iron Crutch bowed in return.

Then Hui Tong requested all to meet Fei and Dian, and all took seats with mutual courtesy. Juexian deeply thanked Master Iron Crutch for his arduous journey. The Master smiled: “We are all fated by destiny, and being of one school and the same Dao, these small matters are unworthy of mention.” Zhang Guo, beholding Iron Crutch’s immortal bearing, though his visage was dark and ugly, yet a pure and righteous aura shone forth, greatly admired him and sat by his side, asking about cultivation and the grand Dao of preserving the heart. Iron Crutch, knowing this man to be the future associate of himself as foretold by the Patriarch, showed great respect. He imparted all his knowledge and experience, doing his utmost to guide Zhang Guo’s understanding. Zhang Guo, being of the same generation with Wenmei Zhenren as a fellow disciple, addressed him as Uncle Master, and the two felt especially close. After some discourse, the host Juexian ordered the serving of rare fruits and delicacies of mountain and sea, along with his own brewed hundred-flower fine wine, to entertain Iron Crutch, seating him in the place of honour. Iron Crutch politely accepted and ceased to refuse. Hui Tong, Zhang Guo and his son likewise took seats according to rank; Fei and Dian sat beside Iron Crutch’s shoulders.

During the feast, Fei Fei spoke of the four figures seen on the cloud road, certain they were not upright men and would sooner or later cause trouble; caution was needed. Juexian then said: “It is heard that the old flood dragon has thrown himself into the South Sea and recently joined the Jie Sect; he has taken many disciples. Knowing that Zhang Guo and I are here, he has resolved to come and disrupt our Daoist gathering. But I have many powerful friends to aid me, including the Dragon Kings of the Crystal Palace and their consort, Princes Ao Guang and Ao Shun, all valiant fighters with wondrous skills. If the evil dragon causes mischief, they will surely rise in arms to help. With so many immortals, can they not overcome a band of beastly demons?” At these words he laughed heartily. Master Iron Crutch spoke sternly: “Brother Daoist, you should not be so overconfident. Where in the four seas and five lakes is there not a worthy man? We have but lately begun cultivation and have limited skill; how dare we lightly measure all the people of the world? Even our Patriarch, lord of the Daoist religion and leader of the immortals of the three realms, will not speak boastfully; how much less you or I, with our slight attainments, should we disparage others with arrogant words? As fellow Daoists, I beg you to consider this.”

Hui Tong and Zhang Guo said hurriedly: “Your words, Uncle Master, are as firm as metal and stone. None but the highly learned and accomplished would refuse to speak thus. We have learned a lesson.” Juexian, feeling ashamed at his rash words, promptly rose to thank them. Master Iron Crutch, seeing how all were obedient and corrected, rejoiced greatly and raised his cup in congratulation, saying: “Our sect’s aim is to benefit the world and not self-interest; to be genuine and not given to boasting. Since ancient times, no immortal has deceived the world with empty words; true immortals do not vaunt their magic nor disdain their fellow Daoists. My learning is shallow and my merit slight; what I have said is merely mutual encouragement and admonition. I am humbled by your praise and feel unworthy.” All said: “Uncle Master is too modest; to us juniors this is not necessary.” Iron Crutch modestly demurred and then said to Fei Fei: “Were those the four you mentioned? I have taken their measure; they are all beast demons. I do not know their purpose in coming, what skill they have, nor where they reside. When free, you may go and inquire; report to me what you learn. If they have designs on harm, it is best to be forewarned early.” Fei and Dian bowed and promised. The feast then ended.

Juexian prepared a fine cloud chamber for Iron Crutch and his disciples, situated in the innermost room. Hui Tong led them in. Iron Crutch saw the chamber was exquisitely furnished and felt uneasy, saying: “A man of the cloth, living in mountains, forests, caves and wilderness, finds his home everywhere; how can he dwell in such comfort? It is too much trouble for the host.” Hui Tong smiled: “Uncle Master is always so self-restrained; you are a man of the Dao and differ from us. How many immortals dwell in the heavens, who do not inhabit noble caverns? Yet you still endure hardship.” Iron Crutch hastened: “I, Li by name, know but a little of magic; the true grand Dao is only barely known to me - how can I compare to the Golden Immortals above? I beg you, brother, do not say such things, for they increase my shame.” Hui Tong would say no more, and after discourse departed. Iron Crutch sat alone to exercise his profound art. Fei and Dian were sent forth by command to investigate the four demon Daoists.

As the sky brightened, Fei and Dian had not yet returned. The Master suddenly felt a stirring in his heart and blood; he suddenly realized: “Alas! Fei and Dian have been captured by the demons.” He did not speak to others, but paced a few steps and resolved upon a plan. He pointed behind the chamber; there was a layer of grey-blue wall, the last layer of the snail shell. At his touch, suddenly a great gate appeared. Master Iron Crutch, staff in hand, gourd hanging from it, slowly stepped forth. Then came the sound of a click as the twin doors closed behind him, leaving no trace. He followed the water’s course downstream from Huaipai Village, where he saw a vast, round house; its two great doors were a pair of clam shells, half open, half shut. It was the residence of a great clam spirit of the Jie Sect, who had attained demonhood. His skill was no less than Juexian’s; he could use his hard shell as palace chambers. Entering, there was a great plaza, and behind it hundreds of houses in rows. The demons had heard of the grand gathering in the snail shell; having heard the old flood dragon’s words, and that many disciples of Lao Jun’s sect boasted they were human cultivators and looked down on the Jie Sect, and that the clam spirit and Zhang Guo, a bat, were attached to them and even mocked the Jie Sect as all beasts, the demons’ anger was roused. They gathered countless demons and fiends to Huaipai Village, preparing to show the immortals there their prowess and to settle superiority. The clam spirit, originally living in the sea, volunteered his shell as lodging for the assembly, and proposed to set up an arena therein, awaiting the immortals from Juexian’s side for a contest of magic.

That day Hui Tong invited Master Iron Crutch and his disciples to the snail shell; the four demons Lingxuzi and others, at the old flood dragon’s behest, also arrived at the clam’s inner belly. The old flood dragon had come earlier, and on that day the clam spirit as host held a welcoming assembly, serving only delicacies from the nearby sea. Lingxuzi laughed amid wine, saying, “The host entertains us with creatures of his own house; today’s banquet may be called a sea feast.” The assembly applauded. Tongxuánzi also laughed: “Today the clam master, as host, fulfils his duty fully, using the kin of his own kin; truly this is putting righteousness above kinship. We feel deep gratitude, yet fear that if there be trouble in the mountains, and we invite the clam lord to visit, there will be no such kindred to enjoy; that would indeed be shameful.”

The old flood dragon came with many other fiends, including Houkong the Recluse, Dujiao the Master, Niumo the Venerable, and the Divine Lion King, all fierce beasts of mountain and forest, such as tigers, leopards, oxen, and eagles; like Lingxuzi and Tongxuánzi, a bear and an elephant among beasts, naturally savage. Now having learned some magic, they grew even more unrestrained in evil deeds. The Lion King and Niumo laughed and said: “How modest are Lords Ling and Tong! Our mountains produce the most beasts, matching the sea clans; are we then less worthy than the clam lord?” Tongxuánzi smiled: “That is not so. Though the mountain kin be many, have you not heard: ‘When the hare dies, the fox laments; things suffer for their kind.’ When the mountain leaders come to the sea to accept the clam lord’s hospitality, they feel deep unease; how much more to harm their own kind to satisfy outsiders! Such things even the lowest beasts of the mountains know are utterly wrong; how much less us?” The demons applauded even more, but the host clam lowered his head silently, troubled.

Fearing the clam bore resentment, the old flood dragon hastened to divert the talk. Tongxuánzi also regretted his rash words and hastened to apologize to the clam lord, who was silent with anger.

As they were in difficulty, a small demon suddenly reported: “Two mortals, a man and a woman, are spying outside the gate. Seeing us, they fled, but soon returned. We fear spies, and dare not conceal it.” Before he finished, the old flood dragon sprang up and shouted: “Bring me my spear!” Lingxuzi and Tongxuánzi, growing bored, wished to avoid trouble, and quickly restrained the old dragon, smiling: “We are newcomers and without merit; these small demons are likely of little skill; no need for you to act personally. Let us two take the first credit.” The old dragon yielded.

Two demons seized weapons and rushed out the door; the assembled demons, mindful of the fight, also took up arms to support the line. Lingxuzi and Tongxuánzi, emerging at the gate, saw the two mortals peering out—the very two met in the clouds, Fei Fei and Dian Dian.

The two demons laughed: “So it is you two dog-heads come to die! No wonder you looked so desperate in the clouds, as if impatient to find the road to the netherworld. Good! Courageous ones come quickly! If you do not come, we shall take you as offerings.” Speaking, one wielded a spear, the other a blade, and they charged at Fei and Dian. The two, seeing the demons closing in, were furious and used their weapons to meet them, battling over a hundred rounds without victor.

Meanwhile, the old flood dragon and clam lord stood at the front lines; seeing Ling and Tong could not overcome Fei and Dian, Tongxuánzi said: “Allow me to offer them a treasure.” He took from his bosom a small bottle, mouth aimed at the enemy, and chanted “Mo Lei Hu Lu Che”. Fei and Dian shivered, their two souls simultaneously departing their bodies and flying into Tongxuánzi’s bottle; their bodies alone were carried by small demons into a small chamber and cast therein. The assembly then congratulated the three demons on their success, who laughed: “The lame one has great skill; had he been here, he too would have been trapped in the soul-capturing bottle.”

The old flood dragon suddenly realized: “That lame man has some background. His secular name is Li Xuan; he is indeed skilled. Lao Jun is pleased and has newly received him as a disciple. If he comes, all must be cautious.” The two demons Unicorn and Niumo, hearing this, angrily said: “Why such fear? Not yet encountering a great foe, and already timid? Is this not encouraging the enemy and destroying our own prestige?” The old flood dragon blushed and said: “I only say this to warn you to be alert and avoid ambush; not out of fear. If I were so timid, I would remain cultivating in the South Sea and not have come all this way to stir trouble.”

As the demons prepared to argue, Tongxuánzi laughed: “Do not quarrel. My treasure bottle holds souls; once inside one is stuporous as if dead. After an hour the soul will dissipate and be unable to commune with the body, becoming not even a ghost. How is it then that these two demons we captured, though confined long, seem yet to be discussing inside? Could their souls be different, unusually strong and durable?” Hearing this, the demons marvelled. Tongxuánzi placed the bottle to his ear and bid all be silent; listening a while, he laughed heartily: “Strange, strange! These two demons have skill indeed; though near death, they still sing mountain songs and play. ” The demons burst into laughter and asked what songs they sang. Tongxuánzi smiled a while and then recited the songs.

What fate befell Fei and Dian is yet unknown; we await the next chapter for their account.
