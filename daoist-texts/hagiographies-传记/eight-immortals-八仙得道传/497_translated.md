# Chapter 029: The Soul-Capturing Bottle Struggles to Contain the Immortal Body; The Gourd Cave is Used to Trick the Demons

Now it is told that Fei-fei and Dian-dian were both taken captive in the soul-capturing bottle by Tong Xuanzi. That Tong Xuanzi was originally the short-lived insect of the autumn woods, the cold cicada, commonly called the "Zhi-liao." The common cicada’s life is the shortest, but this particular cicada, by some unknown cause, lived on for two full years. Generally, the nature of beings is never content; the cicada’s usual lifespan is but a few months, and none expect it to live beyond that. Only this cicada, endowed with a particularly strong virtue, broke through the barrier of short life and lived two years without dying, and so it concluded that the cicada might increase life and prolong years; having lived two years, it must surely live to twenty, or two hundred, even to two thousand or twenty thousand years, and live forever without death. Surely this was not impossible, only limited by its shallow knowledge and humble status; unable to seek immortals or the Way, nor to ask for teaching or aid. Thinking that having survived the year, it might at most survive another, who would hope it might live three or five years? Since it must die sooner or later, it was little different from the cicadas who died in the autumn. Thinking thus caused it great sorrow, and it sat daily on a tree-top, weeping day and night in pain. Cicadas are indeed the cheapest of creatures, nourished by the wind and dew. This cicada, feeling the difficulty of eternal life, and recalling the bitterness of short life, gave up even the hope of living three or five years. So it cried bitterly each day, until it could no longer draw in the wind and dew; after many days of weeping, it seemed near death.

But it was destined to have this destiny of long life. When it mourned on the day of its passing, just then an immortal passed beneath, hearing the cries and lamentations, and moved with compassion, called it down. The cicada was on its last breath and could not speak. The immortal was greatly moved, and immediately spat forth a stream of law-water into the cicada’s belly. The cicada received this immortal water, and instantly felt its whole body’s spirit within and without renewed beyond measure. Opening its eyes it saw an old immortal smiling, holding it in the palm and speaking. Its nature was naturally extraordinary, and having lived so long, its worldly knowledge was tenfold that of the common autumn cicada. Knowing well that the old immortal had saved its life, how could it not be grateful? It jumped about in his palm, bowing its head and touching the palm several times.

I am not of the same kind as these creatures, and though I know not whether this action is like the salutation of men bowing, yet from the circumstances it is clear it is the expression of thanks by the cicada to the immortal. The immortal laughed and nodded, saying, “It is remarkable that such a small creature should have some knowledge, and I pity your resolve to ascend, yet with no means to seek instruction; therefore I impart to you the method of drawing in the essence of the sun and gathering the moonlight, and also teach you a few transformations, one by one. If you truly have aspiration and fortune, then diligently practise, and you shall surely progress from twenty years to a hundred, and even to ten thousand years, living as long as heaven, earth, and the mountains. But I fear that once you have gained a human form, if you advance even an inch and begin to meddle with trivial matters and strive vainly for reputation, even your cheap nature will be worn away. Then your powers will only serve to bring misfortune upon you, and though you live three or five hundred years, you will still return to death. After death, you may even be condemned to hell for punishment; this is clear. Success and failure depend entirely on your cultivation; I cannot protect you forever.” The cicada nodded its head and accepted the immortal’s great teaching.

From that time forward, the cicada indeed grew better, and as the immortal said, it labored diligently in cultivation. Living over a hundred years, it no longer knew of the fate of short-lived cicadas, and could transform into beasts and birds, soaring beyond the heavens and flying swiftly through the mountains and forests. After a hundred and fifty years, the immortal came again and said it could transform into a human form after another century and a half, and only then could it turn fully human and begin anew on the great Way. By then the cicada could already speak human speech, and its progress was even swifter. Indeed, after three hundred years it changed once more into a human form.

When the time came for Juexian to perform his ritual, the cicada was drawn in by the old Jiaolong (ancient dragon) into the Jie Sect, and accompanied many demons to Huaihai Village, thinking that defeating the snail demon was a great merit in cultivating immortality, and was very pleased with itself. At its first battle it used the soul-capturing bottle it had refined to seize the souls of Fei-fei and Dian-dian. This bottle had originally been made when it was a cicada in the countryside, using a small gourd and its own essence, and was about the size of the middle finger. It was said that it could receive the souls of ten million lives, which was indeed very formidable. The gourd’s material was very thin, so it could also hear voices inside.

At once Tong Xuanzi listened for a time, and heard Fei-fei and Dian-dian speaking inside: “We do not know what strange thing this is, to have hidden both our souls away. Nothing else matters, but we fear being stifled to death.” After a while they conferred: “Fear not, our master is foreseeing; seeing that we do not return in time, he must know we have fallen into harm. Now that he has come, do those demons still have life?” As they spoke thus, they grew cheerful and sang a few mountain songs to relieve their boredom, unaware that Tong Xuanzi heard every word.

Tong Xuanzi relayed these words to the demons, and all laughed heartily. Just at the height of their joy, Tong Xuanzi’s face was suddenly smitten with a slap, a sharp sound echoing clearly. His face reddened on one side, and he was in great pain, standing up hurriedly and searching in all directions. The demons likewise formed a crowd, not knowing whence came that slap. A moment of confusion, and Tong Xuanzi found that his treasured bottle was gone; he hurried to check Fei-fei and Dian-dian, but did not know when they had departed. This left Tong Xuanzi aghast, and the old Jiaolong was enraged, eyes bloodshot.

Ming Mingzi laughed and said, “There is no one else; it must be that lame-footed thief who came invisibly, delivering a slap to Brother Tong Xuan, and while we were in confusion, stole the bottle and those two things away.” The old Jiaolong sighed, “That lame ghost indeed has some little skill; we must not take him lightly.” He ordered his followers, “You must beware of that one’s many transformations and invisible form. Let us not suffer another slap here; it is not worth it.” The demons all trembled at these words. The old Jiaolong angrily said, “If he can vanish, can I not transform also? Tomorrow, I shall go to his snail shell and make a great disturbance, to vent today’s grievance.” The demons encouraged him, “If the great king with such power suffers humiliation from a lame one-footed Taoist, it would be a shame for our sect’s face; tomorrow’s action must not be delayed.” The old Jiaolong readily agreed.

Then Tong Xuanzi pondered, “Never mind other things, but the greatest grievance is that he stole my treasured magic. How can I recover it?” Ming Mingzi and Ling Xuzi laughed and said, “We have heard that this bottle cannot be opened except by the chanting of a secret spell by Brother Dao himself, so the lame one’s theft is useless. If he puts it in the snail shell, there will surely be a way to retrieve it; there is no need to be anxious.” Tong Xuanzi stamped his foot and said, “Dao brothers only know that none but I can open this bottle, but do not know that the lame demon, having rescued the two captured demons, released their souls from the bottle, and so they escaped by returning to their demon bodies. Otherwise, how could both demons have vanished at once? Since he can release the souls from the bottle, he must have a way to open it; even if he cannot open it, he might have a way to shatter it, which would ruin my magic treasure cultivated for many years — how painful and regrettable that would be!” Saying this, he burst into loud lamentation. The demons quickly tried to comfort him.

Ling Xu and Kong Kong declared angrily, “This lame thief used theft the first time he met us; he is clearly not of the right path. If he is unrighteous, so are we. Fear not, Dao friend; tonight the two of us shall each take a magic treasure and go to the snail shell to observe the lame one’s movements and whether the two demons have returned to their souls. If possible, we shall take action and avenge you, preventing them from holding any grand assembly or ritual; then our sect’s divine powers will be manifest, not to be resisted by mere youngsters.” The demons rejoiced greatly hearing this. The old Jiaolong hastily poured two cups of wine to honor the two demons, wishing them success. The two demons drank at once, rose cheerfully, took their leave, emerged from the clam shell, and directly entered the snail shell.

The two demons could also transform. Ling Xu turned into a mosquito, Tong Xuan into an ant, secretly and quietly entering Juexian’s cave. In the innermost chamber they saw Master Tieguai sitting on a large reed cushion, but Fei-fei and Dian-dian were nowhere to be seen. Ling Xu consulted Kong Kong in low voices: “From the looks of it, the two demons have not yet returned to their souls. Though the lame thief has the bottle and the two corpses, he cannot yet rescue them.” Kong Kong laughed, “We Dao friend Tong Xuanzi may now breathe easy; this lame thief is merely injuring others and not himself.” Ling Xu laughed again, “What time is this to be sour? How is this different from the two demons inside the bottle singing mountain songs?” Kong Kong laughed: “How can it be compared? They are captured prisoners, while we are free beings; why should that be a cause for complaint?” Ling Xu said, “Enough, stop the quarrel. See, red light now appears above the lame one’s head; he must be a man of great virtue. If we were to fight him, none of us would be his match. Better to stab him secretly with your plum-blossom poison needle and kill him; that would save much trouble.” Tong Xuanzi nodded, “I think so too. Look, here comes my treasure.”

Before he finished speaking, a voice spoke at his ear: “So you demons have some treasure too. Why not produce it so we may all admire it?” The two demons heard this and hastily opened wide their eyes, looking about, but saw no one.

Ling Xu panicked: “This is bad; this fellow has real skill. I fear I cannot cope with him. Let us return.” No sooner had he spoken than a laugh was heard: “Too polite. If you two want to return to the clam shell, you must leave one of your treasures here to keep company with the soul-capturing bottle, is that not good?” The two demons were greatly terrified. Looking again at Master Tieguai, he still sat unmoved in the same place. Ling Xu said, “Dao brother, this time we have come wrong. That fellow must be hiding there, following us with a body outside the body skill, not on you or me, but perhaps under my belly. If he should make mischief, we cannot see him, but he sees us; that would be our loss.” Kong Kong said, “I, this ant, move slowly and walk on the ground; perhaps he cannot attach to me, and is rather on you, the mosquito.” Ling Xu said, “No, I fly about, moving constantly; it is not certain he can attach to me.”

While the two were debating, another voice said, “Foolish insects, though you have become small, do you not know there are things smaller than you? Can they not attach to you?” The two demons were yet more terrified. Ling Xu asked Kong Kong, “What have you transformed into? Where are you now?” He answered, “I dare not say; I have become two midges, one on Brother Dao’s body, one under Tong Xuan Dao friend’s belly.” Hearing this, the two demons were struck with terror, losing their souls, and instantly changed into human form and fled. After running some steps, they turned to look at Master Tieguai, who still sat unmoved in his place.

The two demons ran a long way, and thought they had escaped the snail shell and congratulated themselves. One said, “Dao brother, today was fortunate; we almost did not escape that blasted snail shell.” The other said, “This is an open space; I do not know where it is, but when we came in, there was no such large place.” One said, “Never mind; we can find a way anyway. Let us return quickly.” As they spoke, they suddenly heard a voice call, “You two really know nothing, running about but never having left my gourd’s mouth. You have given me a headache.” Hearing this, the two demons were greatly alarmed, and begged earnestly, “Great Immortal, you have teased us enough; please be merciful and let us go.” The voice said, “That is not difficult; just leave one of your treasures here, and I will let you go.” The two demons begged repeatedly, which only enraged the voice, which said sharply, “I have good will to let you go, and you dare to be greedy, valuing your tiny trinket so highly? Now I will put you to death and see if you still cherish your treasures.”

The two demons heard this and knelt, bowing their heads and worshipping bitterly for a long time. After much entreaty, suddenly their eyes brightened; opening them, they saw before them a monument, upon which was written a line in large characters: “The tomb of Ling Xuzi and Kong Kongzi of the Jie Sect.” The two demons were so frightened that they could not speak. Looking behind the monument, there was indeed a large tomb; the gates were open, and two yakshas, each holding weapons, beckoned to the demons. Terrified beyond measure, the two demons embraced and wept.

Fortunately Ling Xuzi was clever, and first prayed to Heaven, willing to leave his magic treasures — the soul-summoning banner, the five-coloured stones, and a sword forged of refined iron called the Immortal-Slaying Sword — all as offerings, beseeching for mercy and life. Tong Xuanzi likewise offered his plum-blossom needle and lotus-leaf handkerchief. The two demons, with sorrowful brows, handed over their treasures to the yakshas. The yakshas then forced them to explain the use of each, and to test each before they would release them. The two demons told everything clearly, and all was tested. Then suddenly a great thunderclap sounded in mid-air, frightening the two demons to embrace and weep aloud: “Since the Great Immortal has granted mercy, why strike us with thunder and fire?”

But the thunder was loud yet distant; in a moment the monument, tomb, and yakshas vanished, replaced by a boundary stone, on which was carved in small characters: “From here eastward lies a land route to the clam shell, a journey of 105,000 li; going south by water is only 3,000 li, but one must pass the Demon-Slaying Locks, Demon-Rolling Dam, Demon-Breaking Shoals, and Demon-Falling Bridge.” The two demons saw this and grew greatly alarmed, looking up and crying to Heaven: “The Great Immortal has kindly pardoned us, but if we take this route, the land way will take many years, and the water way is full of countless dangers. Our powers are shallow; how can we pass these barriers? Death is sure either way. Better to die near the Great Immortal than suffer hunger, hardship, and danger on the road.”

Having spoken, they knelt and kowtowed, until blood flowed from their heads and faces. Then the voice said again, “You little demons are also pitiable; since you have begged thus, I will not be excessive. Open your eyes quickly and see where you are.” The two demons were overjoyed, and opening their eyes saw, to their surprise, a wide square; no monument was present — they had come to their destination. This joy was unlike many of their previous sentiments.

What place they had truly reached, we shall see in the next chapter.
