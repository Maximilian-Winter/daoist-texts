# Chapter Thirty-Three: The Great House Indeed Is Mocked by a Demon; The Earth God Relates the Tale of the Haunted Maze

It is related that since the departure of Li Tieguai, the immortal maiden He had dwelt alone in a stone chamber upon Mount Heng, cultivating her art for more than a hundred years. The Mysterious Lady, having heard of her single-minded diligence and earnest cultivation, descended herself and imparted to her the Great Way. The immortal maiden receiving this instruction felt her knowledge advance, and her progress grew more swift.

When the Mysterious Lady took her leave, she furthermore taught her the method of summoning spirits and dispatching generals; should any peril or urgent trial arise, she might send them forth for protection. Yet, the Earth God of this mountain, an aged female deity, seeing that the immortal maiden was of rare beauty and diligent in her cultivation, and being herself a woman, grew more intimate and oftentimes visited the stone chamber to converse with the immortal maiden. They exchanged tales of the celestial and infernal realms, of the profound principles of the elixir and the marvelous Way. Whenever the Earth God encountered points not understood, the immortal maiden would select those fit to receive instruction and impart to them, so that the Earth God became filled with admiration, casting herself down in reverence. Being a woman, and dwelling deep within the mountains, the immortal maiden took no disciples. Many male and female demons of the nearby caves would come to trouble her, but all were expelled by her magic; some, convinced of her Taoist attainments, would offer themselves as retainers, and she would kindly dismiss them. After becoming acquainted with the Earth God, two ghostly attendants were assigned to attend her private and public affairs. Whenever the immortal maiden was engaged in matters, the Earth God would dispatch these two ghosts to run errands, for which the immortal maiden was greatly grateful.

One evening, after completing her evening devotions, the immortal maiden went forth from the cave to enjoy the moonlight, standing alone upon a great rock on the mountain peak, raising her head and looking about, her mind clear and spirit refreshed. Suddenly there came a gust from behind the mountain; in an instant the sky darkened, the earth dimmed, and the moon’s light was extinguished. The immortal maiden was greatly startled and said: “This wind is like a fierce tiger; can it be some new arrival from without? If not, why had I not heard it before, nor heard the Earth God speak of it?” She drew her sword and looked about the mountain front and rear, but saw no stir. Her heart was full of suspicion. Being careful by nature, and having doubt, she would not desist; moreover, being determined to save others, she feared lest a ferocious beast might attack the villagers below. How could one who sought the Way and immortality see danger and not rescue? Thus she went step by step down the hill to trace the source of the sound. As she searched along, she had not gone half a li when again she heard a wailing voice behind her. She stopped and listened, but the strange sound ceased; only to hear a voice say: “Great Aunt, what are you doing here? Is it about that wicked beast?” The immortal maiden was greatly alarmed, turned, and saw none other than her friend, the Earth Mother. She smiled and said: “Good Earth, what is your office? There is such a creature in the mountain, yet you do not think quickly to dispatch it and remove the harm. Why leave it here to injure people?”

The Earth Mother laughed and said: “Ah, Great Aunt, you do not yet understand this matter. Do you know what sort of beast it is? Is it like the common tiger, leopard, jackal, or wolf? Though I am a minor deity charged with guarding, I have no skill to exorcise demons, so I cannot manage it. Even for you, though your learning and practice comprise three parts of the immortal arts, and your virtue is profound, yet to extirpate this monster you would still lack three to five hundred years of the right climate!” Saying this, she bowed repeatedly and laughed: “I speak but in jest; please do not take offence.”

The immortal maiden laughed in reply: “You old woman are hard to please. What is monstrous or not? We are all men beyond the world, all bearing hearts to save the world. Whoever has ability should exert it; if unable, let all consult together and do what may be. To sit idly by and let the wicked beast harm people, and all feign ignorance — what responsibility is this? To see or not see the monster, that is mere jesting. Put aside such talk for now, we may laugh together later. But first, I would ask you, Earth Mother: what sort of creature is this wicked beast? How has it such power? If as you say it is no mere beast, but a demon of potent magic, why have you not before spoken of it?”

The Earth Mother, seeing her zeal, was moved to respect, and took her hand, leading her to the Earth Temple in the mountain hollow. The ghostly attendants came forward to offer tea, and the two sat down. The immortal maiden again inquired of the matter. The Earth Mother sighed and said: “How could the immortal maiden know? Within a thousand li around this mountain were only some harmless wild beasts — foxes, badgers, wolves, rabbits; even tigers and leopards were rarely seen, much less demons. Yet, within three days past, suddenly arrived a Divine Ox, of azure hue and shining horns, skilled in transformations, whose call was as loud as a tiger’s roar; the mountains shook and the birds fled at its sound. From the evening before last it came to this mountain; yesterday it was not seen returning; this afternoon, the Wu family of the great household came to the temple to burn incense and seek oracles, saying that the lady of the household had suddenly been entranced by a demon, and the master of the house had been seized by a demon wind, his life uncertain. I sent the ghostly attendants to investigate; they returned and reported that the night the master held a grand feast with his wife and concubines, suddenly a strange wind blew and the lights were extinguished. The family and womenfolk, scared, fled to the rear chambers. The master, being a man of some courage, ordered the servants to relight the lamps and tidy the utensils. But as the lamps were lit, suddenly in the courtyard two figures, each resembling the master and dressed alike, were wrestling; one said this was a demon in disguise, urging the family to drive it away; the other said the same, that it was a demon assuming his countenance to do mischief, and bade the family to chase and beat it. Alas, the family were frightened and speechless, staring wide-eyed, unable to discern which was the true master and which the demon’s illusion. The real and the false fought until both declared themselves weary and retired to rest. This worsened matters, for though the master had many concubines and a wife, no one wished to sleep with the demon. The family agreed to make no choice between true and false, refusing all company for the time, to preserve their chastity. But when this word was spoken, another gust of strange wind blew and all lamps were again extinguished. In the darkness they heard the demon shout: ‘Ladies, fear not; I am not wont to sleep with women; tonight I will go, leaving your master to amuse you; tomorrow I shall come again to find him.’ The family were greatly pleased, thinking the demon had magical power and would not lust; when it said it would return, they believed it; the master left in the house was surely the true one. When the wind eased, lamps were lit again, and indeed only one master was left, looking downcast and thoroughly wearied, sitting in a room. The family asked if he felt unwell; he only shook his head and said ‘tired, tired,’ then wished to sleep; no more was said. Many saw his altered manner and some doubted, suspecting this master was false and the true master seized by the demon, his life uncertain. Yet most believed this man was the true master, and his changed looks were from hardship. Those who doubted dared not speak their suspicions; those who believed needed no words. They helped him to the wife’s chamber to sleep. The master’s wife was a woman of loyalty and trust, having no doubts, and cared for him. At midnight, alas, the master’s lust was excessive. Of these matters, I cannot speak before Great Aunt; suffice it to say many of the concubines had suffered much from the master, who in usual days was not so. Thus they perceived the flaw. All say this master must be a demon; the family suffered but kept silence. Most urgent was to learn where the true master had been taken by the demon arts, and whether his life was in peril. So during his midday rest, they held a weeping assembly, and then sent for me to the temple, beseeching me to act as judge, to investigate their master’s whereabouts and the demon’s origin and how to drive it away. Poor I, as a minor deity of this mountain, knowing only to observe the law and perform my office, had little skill in subduing demons.

Having received their entreaty, I could not refuse, lest I cause them sorrow; so I gave them a general oracle slip, and sent the ghostly attendants to investigate. When they returned they spoke of a thousand-person pit behind the mountain, a place where villagers cast corpses, and found a man lying beneath a tree, drunk or stupefied. That place was full of lonely ghosts and heavy yin energy, rarely trod by men. Yet my ghostly attendants were clever, and thought: ‘How can one rest here at will? And his apparel is fine, unlike a country laborer.’ They concluded this must be the true master Wu, seized by the demon.

They found a wild ghost and inquired. The ghost said: ‘When this man came here was after the second gust of strange wind last night; he has been here half a day. He looks alive but cannot speak nor move; though a newcomer to our way, his yang qi is not extinguished. Within a hundred steps of him is warm energy; we cannot approach. He must be a nobleman of great rank and power; if a commoner, even vigorous and fully awake, he would not have such strong aura.’ From this it was clear he was indeed the true master Wu. For he was known as benevolent; over a hundred hamlets revered him as their chief; any village matter unsolved by others was settled by his word, which none could gainsay. His rank was like that of a petty king — a veritable nobleman. Among these farming villages, who else but master Wu could be called ‘nobleman’? Thus the ghostly attendants were sure he was master Wu, and I was convinced too. Just as I was about to send a dream sign to the master’s wife and concubines, I received an edict from the City God of this district, saying: ‘A divine ox has come from the west, known as the steed of a great immortal; shortly an immortal will come to subdue it. This beast’s six senses are impure, wild and untamed; having come to the mortal realm it will harm the people. I charge the hundred Earth Gods of this mountain to keep watch; wherever the divine ox goes, notify the locals to guard carefully, that they may avoid injury and death.’ Receiving this edict, I was greatly amazed; yet I wondered, if the City God can know the ox’s mischief, why not know the immortal master who rides it, nor his dwelling? Could it be that even he has some taboo and cannot speak openly?’

The immortal maiden said: ‘The City God is righteous and appointed as deity, but, like other honored deities, is charged with guarding the land and people, and has no skill in subduing demons. As for foretelling the future and discerning changes, that is the Great Way of the Golden Immortals above; ordinary immortals may not possess this skill. Besides, there are many gods in heaven, and to investigate them all is no easy matter. In my view, the City God’s knowledge is remarkable already. As for you and I, we cannot even judge these small matters clearly!’ The Earth Mother nodded: ‘Quite so! I had settled purpose, and following the edict, I went personally from the temple, assembling all the Earth Gods of the mountain to discuss a plan to notify the people. After the meeting, I went to master Wu’s house and showed him a dream. Then I went specially to the pit to see the true master Wu. He still lay insensible, leaning against a tree root, as if sleeping soundly. Fearing wild beasts might harm him, I left a ghostly attendant there for protection. Since he was so inert, I need not worry about hunger or cold. By early morning, when the whole family’s dreams coincide, they will surely come to fetch him; then my duty will be done and my conscience clear.’ The immortal maiden pondered and said: ‘Ghostly attendants fear no beasts, yet beasts cannot see ghostly attendants. The netherworld and other realms differ; how can they protect this man?’ The Earth Mother laughed: ‘You have thought well. I saw this too, so I sent a ghostly attendant to guard him. Being a ghost himself, and among many fox, rabbit, wild, and resentful ghosts of the pit, all of the same path, when danger comes and they cannot resist beasts, they unite their craft and magic, and together blind the beast’s eyes, so that its mind is confused and it runs about in vain, unable to reach master Wu or leave the ghostly realm. This is called the haunted maze.’ They laughed heartily. The immortal maiden smiled broadly and said: ‘So the tale of the haunted maze is true, though I did not know how the maze was wrought. Now I understand from your words. I have heard that those caught in the haunted maze are those weighed down by yin and weak in yang, with the corpse barely clinging to breath, the corpse dwelling on remaining qi. If a strong and vigorous person meets it, it has no power; and if an adept bites through his tongue and spits blood upon the ghostly body, it burns like fire and causes great pain, even destroying the ghostly form and dispersing the spirit. Is this true?’ The Earth Mother said: ‘How could it be untrue? Did you not hear the ghostly attendants say the wild ghosts dare not approach master Wu because they fear his strong aura? But that is of men; beasts, whose spirits and qi are far less, are not feared by ghosts no matter how strong. Moreover, the ghostly attendant I sent has served in my temple many years, like a man working in a government office. His knowledge and skill are greater than ordinary; with him there directing and commanding, though unable to resist demons, he can protect master Wu’s body sufficiently; there is no need to worry. What puzzles me is that the City God said an immortal would come soon to subdue the demon, yet two days have passed without appearance. Leaving that aside, master Wu’s family already suffers greatly from this creature. If no immortal descends today, when master Wu returns home tomorrow, surely one life will be lost to the demon. This I fear. I was just about to go to your cave to discuss a plan, and behold, you have come. Since you are resolved to save those in peril, and this matter lies within my domain, you ought to assist, so your compassion and righteousness may be seen!’ The immortal maiden smiled: ‘Though you say this divine ox is formidable, I fear the tale is somewhat exaggerated. Before master Wu returns home, I will go with you to see, and if we can expel this thing, we will; if it be truly powerful and we cannot overcome it, we may retreat without harm. What say you, honored deity?’ The Earth Mother cheerfully replied: ‘I shall accompany you.’ The immortal maiden said: ‘To save a person is like putting out a fire; the sooner the better. Since we go, let us depart at once, without delay.’

The Earth Mother followed the immortal maiden. Together they rode the clouds and in a moment arrived at master Wu’s house. The Earth Mother pointed and said: ‘Below is thick black mist and a foul stench; this is master Wu’s residence, where the old ox is making mischief!’ The immortal maiden looked down and saw indeed a thick black vapour enveloping a large mansion. A foul smell assailed her nostrils, nearly causing retching. She took from her side a vial of medicine and poured some out. Together with the Earth Mother, she inhaled it, and the stench faded. The immortal maiden said: ‘You remain here to watch; I will go and investigate.’ The Earth Mother cautioned: ‘Be careful.’ The immortal maiden answered: ‘I know,’ and leapt down into the courtyard. From within came sounds of music and merriment, mingled with men and women laughing and cavorting. The immortal maiden knew the old ox was here feasting; her anger flared. Boldly brandishing her treasured sword, she entered the courtyard. There she saw a false master Wu holding two naked women in each arm, drinking and playing, in a most lewd manner. About ten other women, also naked, came and went attending; though appearing to smile, their faces clearly showed sorrow and anger.

Seeing this, the immortal maiden’s wrath was like a flame. She prepared to strike the demon with her sword unawares, but the false master Wu had already seen her. Suddenly he laughed heartily, pushed the women aside, and naked pursued her, calling: ‘Fair lady, whence come you? Come join me for a drink!’ The immortal maiden blushed and flew a sword at him without time to regard his life or death, then turned to flee. But this thing was indeed powerful; it evaded the sword’s light and spat forth a plume of blue smoke. The immortal maiden just leapt into the air and was struck by the smoke, feeling a fishy stench; she was overcome and fell headlong to the ground. The false master Wu laughed loudly and called for help to carry the immortal maiden inside, saying: ‘I shall have a merry time with her!’

The fate of the immortal maiden is yet unknown; we await the next chapter for its solution.
