# Chapter 38: A Skillful Hand Subdues the Fierce Beast; True功夫 Awakens the Divine Child

Now it happened that the Fairy Lady, seeing the person pursuing the great leopard, perceived him to be a child not yet ten years old. She was greatly astonished, and at first intended to hurry up the mountain to aid him with her sword, so as to save his life from needless peril. But unexpectedly, the leopard, seeing the child coming close, gave a loud roar and ran down the mountain. The Fairy Lady then perceived that this matter was indeed extraordinary. This child was not a deity or immortal in disguise, but must be a person of some great origin. Since this was so, the leopard could by no means harm him in the least. So she boldly went forward to meet it, standing before the leopard and with her sword aimed at its throat. 

The leopard, in its flight, was dazed and unprepared for a barrier ahead. Raising its head, it was filled with wrath, and leapt upon the Fairy Lady. She, quick of body and keen of sight, hastily bowed her head and stooped low, slipping beneath the leopard's belly. She sought to pierce its abdomen; but the leopard, as if understanding her purpose, suddenly bounded upward, soaring more than ten feet into the air, thus avoiding her sword. In that fleeting moment, the child came up behind, and taking advantage of the leopard’s leap, stretched out a small hand and caught one of its legs in mid-air.

At first, the leopard was not greatly daunted by the Fairy Lady’s sword; but when the child so seized it, it appeared to be in excruciating pain and roared again, turning its head to swallow the child. The leopard’s mouth was large and the child’s head small. The Fairy Lady could not help but exclaim, “Ah!” As she was about to come forward and rescue him, the child did not avoid it; on the contrary, he went with the motion and thrust his little head into the leopard’s mouth. The distance between them was but a few inches, which made the Fairy Lady the more anxious. She hastily raised her sword to pierce the leopard’s eye; but the child’s movements were swifter than her sword-thrust. As her sword neared the leopard’s eye, the beast drew back somewhat; at the same time the child leapt over the leopard’s head, turning over, and performed a reversed dragonfly posture upon the leopard’s back. His feet were towards the sky, but his hands gripped the leopard’s back so tightly that the beast lay still, motionless as a great mountain pressing upon it. Its breath came with a whistling sound, showing great exhaustion.

The Fairy Lady then understood that this child truly possessed the power to subdue fierce beasts. Though she held a treasured sword and struck repeatedly, she had not managed to wound it; she, a cultivator of the Way, felt ashamed. She hastened to sheath her sword and prepared to speak to the child. But the child, turning over and riding upon the leopard’s back, pointed at her and laughed, saying, “Sister, you have a kind heart indeed, but alas, you wield your treasured sword in vain; you cannot even cut a single hair from this great beast. Such a weapon is only fit to kill cats and dogs, to cut fish and turtles; or at most to shave strips of bamboo, or cut grass and weeds—that is all there is to it. If you were to try to handle such a great beast, I fear even your slender body would be swallowed up by it. I dare say the beast would not even frown or rub its belly in displeasure!”

The Fairy Lady saw the child’s light words, and inwardly felt ashamed, yet she could not rebuke him openly. She pitied the child’s genius, thinking that if she did not take this opportunity to warn him, he would grow more arrogant and insolent, becoming a ruffian guilty of every evil. Not only would such a fine material be wasted, but he would become a scourge to the people. This was indeed a matter both lamentable and alarming. Thinking thus, she knit her brows and smiled, saying to the child, “Young sir, your strength is indeed not small; yet one cannot depend solely upon brute force. Were it not for that slight strength, you would long ago have been the prey of this great beast, and by now turned to the beast’s excrement. So from my humble view, your skill is not yet altogether extraordinary.”

The child was roused to anger by this, sitting astride the leopard’s back, and with his two little fingers scolded, “What great skill can you have, you base woman, to utter such wild words? Those who strike beasts always rely upon strength. Strength as great as mine, bare-handed, is a hundred times more formidable than your sword. How then can you say it is not skill? But you, wielding your treasured sword, cannot even cut a hair from the leopard. Is that skill indeed?” The Fairy Lady smiled and replied, “It is not as you say. I mean that if one uses only strength to strike beasts, one may kill a beast by courage alone; but if a large pack of beasts comes, even your great strength might be insufficient, and you would be sure to lose your life to them, beyond remedy. In my poor judgment, it is inconvenient to rely upon sword or strength; better still is to use neither bare hands nor weapons, but to make hundreds of fierce beasts bow their heads and obey your commands. When you order them not to move, they shall not so much as breathe; when you bid them move, they cannot stay their feet. Would not this be safer and more reliable than force? And you could also employ them to carry burdens and substitute for your legs.”

The child laughed aloud, nearly falling off the leopard’s back, and cried, “I first took you to be a living person, so spoke to you with due respect and called you ‘Sister.’ Now it seems you are no living being, but rather a ghost who only utters nonsense.” The Fairy Lady smiled, “How do you see that I am a ghost?” The child laughed again, “If you were a living person, how could you be such a mischief-maker? You think me a child, but I am clever and will not heed your nonsense.” The Fairy Lady smiled, “How do you know I speak nonsense?” The child laughed, “If you will perform your art before me, then I shall believe your words are true; but I fear your methods untried, and that your life will be buried in a living grave. Would that not be courting misery, and making me laugh at you?” The Fairy Lady laughed, “You are a naughty child, speaking without reason. What living grave? What courting misery? So young and yet your speech is not sincere.” The child was angered again and shouted, “Nonsense! I mean well; why say I am not sincere? If you cannot hold the leopard, it will swallow you, and your body will be buried in its belly. The leopard may not burst from eating your slender body; it may instead grow fat and strong. Then would not your burial place be a living tomb? More than that, the leopard is well subdued by me; what concern is it of yours? Yet you contrive such tricks to provoke it. This is like seizing food from a tiger’s mouth, or grasping a tiger’s whiskers with bare hands—do you think you shall live? This is indeed courting misery. You seem clever, yet your words lack sense. If you keep on with such nonsense, do not blame me if I treat you as I treat the leopard; then do not complain of rudeness!”

He laughed loudly, tossing his body like a willow in the wind. In the life of man, laughter and tears are never absent, but in matters of bodily health, they are often inversely related. The physicians and healers assert that too much crying harms and destroys the body, while laughter dispels sorrow and refreshes the spirit. Thus laughter and tears relate closely to our being. Yet all things must have their proper bounds. Since we cannot avoid laughter and tears altogether, neither should we laugh all day or forbid sorrowful tears; else the body would be greatly discomforted. Thus laughter and tears are like ordinary matters, each with reasonable limits. To cry beyond measure is not necessarily harmful; but excessive laughter may also bring ill effects. This is a manifest truth requiring no explanation.

As for the child battling the leopard, his strength was indeed great; yet still, he was but a child and somewhat lacking in experience. The ancients say that to tread on a tiger’s tail or wade in spring waters is to court great danger. Much more so with a leopard, fiercer than a tiger. Having ridden upon its back, how could he not be vigilant and cautious, lest the beast make a sudden move? Yet the child, engaged in verbal sparring with the Fairy Lady, relaxed his spirit in laughter, loosening his joints, falling into the saying that a light-boned man is not far from harm—laughter, ill-timed, can be worse than tears.

It was just as the child deserved danger. As he laughed, his joints relaxed, and the once oppressed leopard, sensing its burden lessened tenfold, found its opportunity to escape. It put forth all its strength, heaving upward and flinging the child to the ground. The child, who had been most watchful before, now slackened and could not recover his power at once. Moreover, having been thrown and dropped, he was frightened and hurt, and his mind was in confusion. His struggles were thus slower than usual. Meanwhile, the leopard, having reversed defeat into victory, was invigorated. Seeing the child cast down, it dared not be negligent; swift as a hawk, it turned and leapt upon him. Though not yet urgent, its speed was now a hundredfold greater. Before the child could struggle to rise, the leopard’s forepaws pinned him as if using his own method to suppress him, so that he could not escape anywhere. Then it opened its wide mouth and slowly tasted him.

Gentle readers, do not say that the writer is no leopard and cannot know the leopard’s mind. In all things of the world, it is common to see one and know two; to judge reason by circumstance. From the leopard’s conduct towards the child at that time, it surely seemed to harbor such thoughts. Yet the writer is always humble, and in all things dares not to affirm what is doubtful. Therefore, before declaring the leopard’s mind, I prefix the words “as if,” indicating that my observation rests still in doubt and I do not assert certainty.

Alas! I have spoken at length, and though my reasons are sufficient, some readers will say I am mischievous, imitating the petty tricks of novelists by inserting such irrelevant talk at a most urgent moment. Whether this affects my reputation or not, I will end here and proceed with the story of the leopard’s struggle.

Now the leopard was above and the child below, like a device that might open or shut with a “click” at either side. Once locked together, the fate of man and beast in battle was decided with no chance of rescue. The leopard’s body was heavy, the child small. The child held the leopard down by natural strength; but the leopard, to press the child, need only lie upon him casually, not even opening its mouth to devour; this would surely crush the child’s body to pieces.

Indeed, the situation had reached this extremity. In that instant, there was a strange cry, “Ah, ah, ah!” The poor child, born with great strength and surpassing cleverness, with a small body, was pressed near the leopard’s belly, head and stomach touching. No matter how brave his spirit, he could not but cry out in terror, losing heart and courage. Unconsciously, he flung himself forward, face downward, back toward the leopard’s belly and fell to the ground. The leopard, putting forth all its strength, lay down hard and pressed its four feet close, so the child could not escape. At this moment, even ten lives would not save the child from entering a living tomb.

In this utmost peril, not only did all readers hold their breath for the child, but even the writer, writing here, bore a hundred and twenty points of care. Yet the writer has more assurance than readers, for the child is an important character in this book. No matter the danger, he will not perish soon. When death seems near, there will be an unexpected savior to turn the evil fortune. Take, for example, the Fairy Lady; though she has not yet become an immortal, she does possess the Way’s arts. If she thought to assist the child but thereby harmed him, how could she excuse herself? Gentle readers should remember this well.

From the moment the child was thrown from the leopard’s back to being pressed under its belly was but an instant. At this instant, the Fairy Lady who spoke to him had never left his side. Seeing him cast down, her fright was greater than the child’s. Yet she recovered quickly, knowing that force was inferior to art. She muttered an incantation, making a gesture of immobilization, and shouted, “Wicked beast, let him go!” From her voice issued a mighty call. The leopard was thus bound by her spell; though it held the child fast, it could not move. Seeing the leopard still, the child thought his chance to escape and take revenge had come. He climbed from under the leopard’s belly and seized the front leg that the beast had planted firmly. Once outside, he could turn defeat to victory. His courage and strength revived, he thought to break the leg as a means of victory.

But the leopard, bound by the Fairy Lady’s spell, was as hard as steel in flesh and bone. The child exerted all his strength and only moved the leg a little. The leopard seemed not to feel it, nor utter a cry of pain. The child emerged and looked over the leopard’s body. The beast lay still, eyes flashing like lightning, staring blankly at the Fairy Lady, as if a tamed dog. The child was somewhat amazed, and scolded the Fairy Lady sharply, “Is it you who taught this beast to play dead?” The Fairy Lady smiled and nodded, “If I had not made it play dead, would you still be alive? At this moment, you would have been already buried in its living tomb.” The child, not angered by this taunt, suddenly came to her side and asked with a smile, “Sister, if you truly have such skill, I will invite you to my home. I have a large house and a great garden, very pleasant indeed. I will make you my master and ask you to instruct me in the art of subduing leopards and tigers. How about that?”

The Fairy Lady heard this and nodded inwardly: this child was reasonable and a talent to be cultivated. She smiled and said, “Do you not yet believe? With but one finger I can command this beast to crouch on the ground as your steed and carry you home. What say you?” The child was delighted, “Good master, please command it at once to crouch.” The Fairy Lady said nothing, but pointed her index finger and called, “Quick!” The leopard indeed crouched down. The child was overjoyed and leapt up, riding the leopard’s back. He then raised his little fists and struck the leopard’s body more than ten times, scolding, “You evil beast, you nearly cost me my life.” The leopard endured the blows as if feeling nothing. The Fairy Lady laughed, “This beast is still bound by my spell; its soul is not in its body. Were you to kill its head, it would feel no pain at all.”

The child ceased and asked, “Master, will you not come back with me?” The Fairy Lady smiled, “Where is your home? Who are your family? You must tell me clearly before I agree to go.” The child hastened, “Sister, there is no need to ask much. My home is nearest, just behind the mountain at the back of the lake. My surname is Zhongli, given name Quan. My father is called Zhongli Jun; he is very old now and cannot hunt beasts. When he goes far, I must help him walk. I have a grandmother too, older than my father.” At this the Fairy Lady could not help laughing.

What more the child said, and whether the Fairy Lady went with him, will be told in the next chapter.
