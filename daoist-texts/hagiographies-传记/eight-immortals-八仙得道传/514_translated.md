# Chapter 46: The Clay Ball Pierces Forth a Head; the Obstinate Immortal Conceals Himself Within the Ear

It is related that Master Tieguai, with a single gesture of his hand, gathered a large mass of earth and clay, rolling it into a round, perfect ball, like a great sphere; and from the top of this sphere suddenly crawled forth a small black and hairy orb.

All who beheld it were greatly amazed and startled; they pressed forward to take a nearer view, and then perceived it to be a man, whose head grew upon the clay ball, while from the neck downwards he was all concealed within the earth. On closer scrutiny, they recognized him as that old Taoist, who had aided in evil and wrought mischief. Thereupon the crowd burst into loud laughter. Yet the old man still knew Zhongli Quan, and with a supplicating voice entreated him to plead with Master Tieguai for mercy, to pardon his death, promising never again to act wickedly, nor to assist the Qin Emperor; and he further vowed to intercede for the release of Zhang Guo, who was about to be captured by General Meng, as an atonement for his crimes. Zhongli Quan laughed and rebuked, saying: ‘Thou villain, guilty of manifold wickedness and extreme arrogance, now is the time when thy guilt is full, and heaven must inflict punishment. Should my Master pardon thee, would it not be to contravene the will of Heaven, and bring ruin upon himself? As for Zhang Guo, my Master has his own means to summon him back at once; why should we heed thy petty entreaties? We will not accept thy favour.’ The old man, perceiving that all hope of life was gone, involuntarily sighed long towards the heavens, and cried aloud: ‘All my life I have wrought manifold evils, and know well that Heaven will not endure me. Therefore I abandoned my home to cultivate the Way, suffering hardship and bitterness, and have attained but a small measure of Taoist skill. Yet I was misled into a heretical path, and made use of by the demonic sect; now I do more harm than when I was a thief. If thus I were to attain to immortality, the heavenly order would indeed perish. Well! Well! Since you say you punish in the name of Heaven, I die without complaint; but I pray you swiftly slay me; in five hundred years, if fate permits, we may meet again, and then I shall ask for your instruction.’

Master Tieguai sighed and said: ‘When a man is at the point of death, his words are gentle. I have heard this man’s speech, and my heart was almost softened. But what A Quan said has greatly enlightened me; these beings are naturally fierce and stubborn, and having once renounced the world, yet lose their true nature—clearly they are beyond hope of repentance. If you heed not his words, in five hundred years he will come back to seek revenge upon me. This very speech proves him so fierce and unreasonable; I may well conclude that when he is reincarnated in five hundred years, he will be discontented and restless still. Since he himself begs for death, I cannot bear to give him further suffering in fragments; I will grant his wish.’ Saying so, he again pointed with his hand; the great ball of clay rolled a while upon the ground, and when it settled, the human head was no longer visible, but only the smooth and perfect clay ball remained. Master Tieguai sighed to the assembly: ‘This is the end of the wicked man who persists in evil and refuses to repent. To rely on magic to harm others is that which Heaven most abhors, and such one is abandoned by the Way Outside, and it is said that all men have the right to slay him. Let us regard this matter as a mirror for our own conduct.’ All present shuddered and assented.

Master Tieguai then laughed to Zhongli Quan: ‘Have you seen? This little clay ball of mine has buried alive so great a Taoist within it. Yet a single Taoist is not worth such a burial. With the scope and power of this clay ball of mine, to contain thousands of troops and horses would be no difficulty at all!’ Zhongli Quan, much pleased, laughed aloud, saying: ‘Master, might you bestow this clay ball upon your disciple to play with?’

Master Tieguai smiled and said: ‘What kind of plaything is this? As for you, now your chief concern is to diligently cultivate the Great Way; there is no need for such a murderous weapon. When you have attained success in the Tao, such treasures can be personally refined at any time; there is no need for gifts from others. Moreover, these things of mine are not like those obtained by the demon folk through their cultivation; they are derived from this gourd, beautiful and perfect, containing all things. These things seem to have a mother-and-child relationship with the gourd; the child separated from the mother, though effective for a time, in the long run is useless. If you take them, what good will it be?’ Zhongli Quan was silent, but inwardly could not let go of the thought. The Immortal Maiden smiled and said: ‘You are impatient, younger brother! Brother, hear my word: the younger brother is but a child, and desires some magic treasure; it is no great loss of purpose; better that the elder brother bestow upon him the sword case left by that demon, and so satisfy him.’ Master Tieguai smiled again, and gave the sword case to Zhongli Quan, earnestly charging him: ‘A treasure is not a treasure; it is a weapon of ill; if improperly used, it will injure others and harm yourself. You must remember the state of the original owner’s death and the cause thereof; not only must you not use this treasure rashly, but you must not regard it as a treasure at all.’ Zhongli Quan bowed and accepted.

Then Master Tieguai said to Immortal Maiden: ‘Go quickly and fetch Zhang Guo out; also settle the affairs concerning Lady Meng Jiang; we must separate and travel our several ways; what is left to linger here for?’

The Immortal Maiden readily consented: ‘This little sister came here with no merits; let me attend to these small matters.’ Master Tieguai laughed: ‘Sister, you are too courteous; your labours are already sufficient; I suppose you intend to entrust many affairs to you alone, that you may have merit?’ The words drew laughter from all. Master Tieguai then said: ‘At present, there are still a few insignificant little demons in General Meng’s camp; such beings, when cultivated, do more harm than good. If they resist stubbornly, there is no harm in again proclaiming a killing edict, and utterly cleansing them, so as to avoid future trouble; if they flee before the difficulty, there is no need for further violence, lest people mistake our sect for one given to boasting and harshness.’ The Immortal Maiden replied, ‘I obey.’

By this time she had newly learned the art of shrinking the earth; the distance was not great to begin with, and by this art, in no time she arrived within General Meng’s camp. It was just past midnight, and throughout the camp the sounds of quarrelling and dispute were incessant. The Immortal Maiden knew that Zhang Guo was confined within a wooden shed in the rear camp, locked by the old Taoist with magic and sealed with incantations; Zhang Guo’s Taoist skill was shallow, and he was naturally unable to free himself. When she reached the shed, just as she was about to recite the spell to remove the seal, she suddenly saw several whirlwinds circle about her feet, rolling and tumbling, making a noise and refusing to disperse. Looking elsewhere, there was not a trace of smoke or dust; at once she understood these to be the little demons her brother had spoken of. Although they were no good, she was pure-hearted and kindly, and disliked opening the killing edict again. She looked down and recognized these black winds as two or three pig spirits, a small ox, and a creature neither bear nor bear, neither wolf nor wolf. The Immortal Maiden could not help both laughing and being vexed, and felt some pity for them. She promptly drew her sword and stood firm, crying out: ‘Beasts, behave yourselves! I bear the decree of the Golden Immortal of the Upper World, come to rescue Zhang Guo. Your Patriarch and two masters resisted stubbornly and have already lost their lives; what power have you lowly demons to defy the order? I have no need to waste words; a single stroke of my sword will end the lives of a thousand pigs and cattle; therefore I speak kindly in the hope of preserving your lives. If you understand your place, depart quickly, enter the mountains deep and the forests dense, cultivate devotedly, and do not harm the people; in time you shall have your day of emergence. If not, my sword’s edge knows no mercy, and though you may have many years of cultivation, once your lives are taken, will it not be a pity?’

The Immortal Maiden’s words were full of pity, but when these beasts heard her call them swine and cattle, and that she cursed their Patriarch and masters without reserve, they, being brutish and ignorant, were angered beyond reason, and no longer could be reasoned with. After she had spoken, she awaited their acceptance of her advice and passage, but none was given; instead, without warning, many hard and sharp objects attacked her from all sides. Luckily she was quick and agile; as they struck, she leapt up and stood in midair, looking down upon them. She saw that the beasts had changed their forms; each was now a half-man, half-beast. Some had human heads upon beastly bodies; some had beast heads upon human bodies; others had beast hooves behind and human hands before, wielding weapons to act the part of beasts. On their heads were twin horns, human or beast alike, all shining brilliantly, keen beyond compare; any ordinary man encountering them would be pierced through chest and head by a single butt. Though of Taoist body, she felt a dull pain from their touch. At first she did not know the cause, but now perceived their horns had been forged; she was somewhat frightened, and stuck out her tongue, crying, ‘Fortunate am I that I escaped swiftly today; otherwise my body would have suffered, and how could I face my brother and A Quan, these children?’ Reflecting further, she heard below a chattering of voices. These beings had cultivated for many years, and had been trained and nurtured by demon Taoists; besides some power of transformation, they had learned human speech, but being too dull, after decades of practice could only chatter imperfectly.

Now the Immortal Maiden both laughed and was angry, with no thought to pity. For curiosity’s sake, she did not strike at once, but turned her clever ear and listened quietly for a while, then rendered their words; only then did she understand somewhat. They were discussing the news the Immortal Maiden had spoken of. One said: ‘With the masters’ prowess, where could any ghostly immortals come from to capture all in a net and slay them?’ Another said: ‘Though so said, I have seen our Patriarch’s recent countenance is poor, somewhat dim; I fear he may not achieve much.’ Another said: ‘If all our masters are gone, we should each escape and find another place, seek a few fine women and enjoy our days; then our cultivation would not be in vain.’ Another said: ‘That woman before us, whether human or demon, having endured our assault and vanished in a cloud of mist, must have great skill; how can we fight her? Best to flee.’

The Immortal Maiden thought: ‘So these dull demons do not see me standing here; no wonder people say dull oxen and stupid pigs are the most ignorant of beasts. Yet they know to seek women and enjoy themselves; truly they learn evil before good. They are beyond pardon. No wonder my brother has never seen them, and is sure they are no good.’ Having settled her mind, she said: ‘Though these beasts have little power, there are seven or eight of them; if I descend and fight, first it will weary my hands and feet; second, it will soil my precious sword; third, I fear they will scatter; better to pierce out their eyes with golden needles, pierce their heads; would this not be simpler and quicker?’ So she took out golden needles and cast them down; instantly golden light flashed and the ground was bright. A chorus of cries ensued; the Immortal Maiden, moved with pity, said: ‘Though they be no good, why should I be intent on taking their lives?’ She then withdrew the needles, covered her face, and hastily descended. Returning to the shed, she removed the seal with the unlocking spell, and saw within a Taoist lying there. She hastened to ask: ‘Are you Brother Zhang? I am He Lanxian, sent by Brother Li to rescue you.’ She repeated this twice, but he made no answer. Though she did not know Zhang Guo, she judged no mistake had occurred. Approaching closer, she employed her spiritual sight to peer into the darkness, and found that he had been bewitched by the old demon to lose his true nature, and she had no means to free him. She then untied a sash about his waist, bound him to herself, and leapt out of the shed.

Just as she was about to go forth, she met two night-watchmen, carrying clappers and lanterns, and behind them an officer with four soldiers on night duty, each armed. Seeing the Immortal Maiden carrying a man, they shouted and surrounded her. She, carrying Zhang Guo, had no mind for conflict, and sought means to escape. Suddenly the group seemed possessed by evil spirits; they dropped their weapons and began to quarrel and fight among themselves, leaving the Immortal Maiden untouched and unnoticed. She was perplexed, but eager to escape and unwilling to watch their tumult, so she made her way to an open space, lightly leapt, and was already soaring in midair. When she alighted, she was more than ten li from the camp.

Carrying Zhang Guo, she smiled to herself: ‘I am a virgin Taoist nun; in saving lives and aiding the world, I need not fear suspicion; yet to carry him thus will surely provoke gossip. Better that I leave him at the gate, and summon my brother to rescue him, then have him taken inside, and so be done with it.’ While pondering, she heard a voice in her ear: ‘If you wish to avoid suspicion, why then rescue him? If you rescue him, you cannot care for suspicion or no suspicion.’

Hearing this, yet seeing no one, her heart was startled, and she almost cast Zhang Guo to the ground; she planted her feet firmly and looked around, but saw no trace of any form. She spat and said: ‘What ghost or spirit dares to mock me? It must be my own mind confused, and my ears playing tricks. No matter; I will follow my own way.’ As she prepared to go, laughter rang in her ear: ‘Pardon me, your skill is such that spirits dare not jest with you; do you know I am a spirit unlike ordinary spirits?’

The more she listened, the clearer the voice, and the more she was at a loss where to hide. She thought: ‘This is extraordinary; what is this thing with such great power? And I carry this dull fellow; there is nowhere for me to hide.’ Then the laughter said wildly in her ear: ‘I hide in your ear first; where then can you hide? You cannot cut off your ear and leave it outside!’

The Immortal Maiden was both anxious and angry; in her vexation she cast Zhang Guo upon a thick and dense meadow, then stood firm, hands on hips, and sternly asked: ‘What demon art thou that dares such mockery? I have urgent business to save a man’s life; if you delay and trifle, will you not hinder my great task? If you are a fellow Taoist brother seeking amusement, then be frank and let me consult with you.’ The voice replied: ‘You are unreasonable! You want to meet me, yet you recklessly cast the man you rescued upon the ground; if he were hurt, would that not be your fault?’ The Immortal Maiden was at a loss, and entreated: ‘Good friend, cease your sport! If you persist in this, that Brother Zhang will not die by casting, but by illness.’ At this, the voice laughed loudly and appeared—a female Taoist standing before the Immortal Maiden, saying: ‘He Taoist friend, you do not know me? I accompany you to see your Master Tieguai.’

What path this person follows is yet to be revealed; we await the next chapter.
