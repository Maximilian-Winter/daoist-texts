# Chapter 47: The Fairy Fox Teases He Xiangu; The Brutal Soldiers Mangle Lady Meng Jiang

Now it happened that He Xiangu was so perplexed and bewildered by that female Daoist that she knew not what was the matter, nor did she discern who the woman might be. Smiling, she asked, “Fellow Daoist, you surely must have seen me somewhere before; if not, how could you today play such a jest upon me?” The female Daoist laughed and replied, “You should take this fellow disciple Zhang Guo upon your back as before; we shall walk and talk all the way, and when we arrive at Senior Brother Li’s place, our words can be fully spoken, and you may then know who I am, so that you need no longer suspect me as some demon or spirit.”

Hearing this, Xiangu felt greatly ashamed, and so she complied, taking Zhang Guo upon her back and letting the Daoist woman go before, with herself following behind. The Daoist was not particular, but accustomed to the way, turning and twisting along the path with ease. She then told He Xiangu that she and Zhang Guo both came under the teaching of the Perfected Wenmei, and that her name was Tonghui. She further said that she had once had some relations with the Senior Brother Tieguai, and so they were well acquainted. Xiangu, hearing this, was suddenly enlightened and smiled, saying, “Since you also come from the school of Perfected Wenmei, what rank are you to Senior Brother Li?” Tonghui smiled, sticking out her tongue, and said, “You take me for a simple-hearted person, but your tongue is too sharp. You say that Tieguai is my senior uncle, that even you are a generation above me, and yet I should not be so rude as to jest before you. Is that so?” Xiangu had no such intention, but her words made her feel very embarrassed, so she hastened to laugh and said, “Do not take it so much to heart, brother Daoist. I have no such cunning designs. You possess great spiritual power and can peer into the human heart. How can you not see the meaning behind my laughter? Why then do you choose to wrong me?”

Tonghui laughed again, saying, “Enough, enough! For our first meeting I have played with you sufficiently. To speak plainly, among my master’s disciples the most proper and mature is Zhang Guo upon your back; the most cunning, playful, and unsettled is this old fox spirit here. If I like a man, I do not keep courteous with him, but, meeting him, seek to have my fun and tease him. Though I have never seen you before, I already know your history well; and now that I have met you, I love you exceedingly, fearing you may prefer politeness and fall into the vulgar customs of the world. It is better to play with you a little first, so that we need not be strangers and awkward when we meet. Do you not think I deserve a good scolding and punishment?”

Heavenly Maiden Xiangu had always been reserved, her company always the modest and refined; she had indeed never met so wild and peculiar a friend, one given to constant mischief. But seeing her dignified form and graceful mien, and noting that, amid the jocularity, there was no levity, she grew fond of Tonghui’s natural vivacity, and deeply admired her extraordinary cultivation. She smiled and said, “The immortals differ from the Western Buddhists and the Eastern Confucians; they do not care for surface proprieties, nor do they affect the world’s many ceremonies and affectations. Alas, I am by nature clumsy and unable to leap beyond the sphere of worldly trifles. Now seeing you so free and unrestrained, worthy of the true way of immortals, if henceforth you will not reject me, I shall humbly accept your teaching, and learn some of your free and playful arts. If I may, brother Daoist, will you take me, a dull and awkward disciple, under your care?”

These words made Tonghui laugh so heartily that she held her sides and cried out, “Ah! How is it? Am I doomed by fate to suffer a life of bondage, so that I may not even be allowed a little liveliness without rebuke?” Tonghui replied, “What nonsense are these vulgar words? Truly, if you would be my disciple, you must first cast off such worthless vulgarities, and throw them into the Eastern Ocean, entrusting them to the old friend of Zhang Daoist, the Dragon King, to keep in the Crystal Palace as an antique toy. Only then can I have a method for your making progress. If you are loath to part with these petty customs, you cannot enter my gate, and must go follow the Western Buddhists or the Eastern Confucians and be a sage outside the world.”

Xiangu laughed again and said, “Brother Daoist, do not speak so bitterly. Though I cannot be as free and unworldly as you, I firmly believe that your manner is most fitting to perfect my true nature, and accords with my heavenly bent, not to be fettered by any worldly net. Therefore I resolve to cultivate the way of immortality, and deem the character and conduct of you, brother Daoist, to be most suitable. Pray tell me, are my words no longer vulgar, so that I may be spared from being sent to the Crystal Palace?”

Tonghui laughed heartily once more, neither affirming nor denying, but said, “I am sent by Perfected Wenmei himself to rescue Zhang Guo; the Perfected knew that Zhang Guo must have aid, but did not foresee it would be Senior Uncle Tieguai and yourself. I was only charged to act as opportunity arose, to save Zhang Guo, and then seek another important person. I hastened here and learnt that you were all in this place, and that the three demons were slain. I prepared to rescue Zhang Guo and then converse with you. But I was a little late, and you had already accomplished the merit by your own hand. When I came to the camp, I beheld you beset by a band of soldiers; I cast a slight spell to amuse them for a while so that you might escape safely.”

Hearing this, Xiangu was enlightened, and laughed, pointing at Tonghui: “I knew that some immortal must have come to aid me. So it was your trickery.” Tonghui replied, “If I had not told you, I had almost forgotten to withdraw my spell; I fear they are all exhausted by now.” Saying this, she turned, faced the direction whence the soldiers came, raised her hand, and waved, saying, “Spare yourselves now.” Xiangu asked, “These men fought so fiercely; will they not suffer mortal peril?” Tonghui laughed and answered, “That too is under my command. When I desire them to die, it will be when you have left and they scatter like mice and oxen. They will then have reached the gates of the nether world; what need is there for your compassion? I only consider them to be good folk, forced into service, already bitterly oppressed; how could I bear to harm them more? I only ask that they do not hinder me or delay my business, and so I was especially lenient in the casting of spells. Did you not see how each threw down his weapon and fought empty-handed?”

Xiangu nodded in admiration, and then spoke of the matter of Meng Jiang and her husband. Suddenly Tonghui sighed, and said, “I was about to tell you, yet you ask of it again. As women born, we cannot help but desire to protect all virtuous women in the world, that they may be free from calamity and may live out their days in peace. How could we sit by and see Meng Jiang suffer without aid? Yet my master, though he told me of this matter, warned me strictly not to concern myself with such idle affairs, lest I bring ruin upon myself. I asked again and again, why good people should not be rescued. To save others is our heavenly duty; how then is it an idle matter that brings sin? My master said that they were all doomed to die, and that death was a blessing; the sooner the better. This matter is to be handled by Senior Uncle Tieguai. When you meet him, you will understand. Brother Daoist, though you have but newly met me, you have surely perceived my nature: I am ever quick and frank, and dislike living in a closed gourd. My master is a good man in all things, but when it comes to important matters, the more eager I am to know, the more slowly and partially he tells me, which vexes me exceedingly. Yet before you I can only speak thus foolishly; how dare I question my master? He once said only briefly, ‘My master wishes me to rescue my senior brother, yet commands me not to meddle in others’ affairs.’ No sooner had he said this than his face changed, and he rebuked me, saying, ‘You go too far in meddling; your senior brother brought this disaster on himself by his interference. Do you also desire to taste the flavour of prison?’ This frightened me from speaking further. I only hope to reach Senior Uncle Li soon, that I may learn the true cause of this matter. When I knew that Senior Uncle had reached here first, how gladly my heart leapt — greater than even rescuing Meng Jiang! Now tell me, brother Daoist, have you heard Senior Uncle Tieguai speak of the cause and effect of Meng Jiang and her husband?”

Xiangu, hearing this, could not help but say, “Since we have only heard from Senior Brother that the two are doomed to die, without knowing the cause and effect, we ought indeed to ask him further; yet I know not how these two husband and wife fare now.”

Tonghui, sorrowful, said, “That I know fully, and can foretell. I do not fear speaking freely, and since you are a kindred spirit, what harm in conversing? Since accompanying her husband hither, Meng Jiang has scarcely known a day without heart-wrenching tears; this is but natural. Did you not know that the mad emperor desired Meng Jiang, and devised a cruel stratagem, employing Fan Qiliang as the guardian of the Great Wall’s land, imprisoning him within the city embankment? This you likely know.” Xiangu nodded and said, “I have heard from Senior Brother’s disciple Zhongli Quan that your Senior Brother Zhang Guo, seeing injustice, rescued Fan Qiliang, causing this calamity.”

Tonghui nodded, saying, “Indeed. But according to the master and senior brothers, is there not some destiny in this? If not, how is it that so many immortals assist and watch over, yet cannot save their lives? Now Fan Qiliang has been buried alive by Meng Tian in the city embankment. At the time of the burial, Meng Jiang wept so that it seemed the heavens would fall; she begged Meng Tian to allow her one last meeting with her husband; if not, she vowed to die with him and never return to Xianyang. Meng Tian, finding no other way, commanded workers to raise Fan Qiliang’s head from the earth. By then he was faint and pale as death, unable to speak. As Meng Jiang saw her husband, she cried out and vomited fresh blood, fainting to the ground. Meng Tian feared she might revive and cause disturbance, so he commanded her to be taken care of, while he hurriedly razed the city wall. A poor youth, who for the sake of a beautiful wife had never known the joys of the bridal chamber, had his life taken within the city embankment. Under such a cruel tyrant, the plight of the common people is indeed most pitiable.”

Hearing this, Xiangu’s brows became erect as moths’ wings, her fair face turned pale; for a long while she could not utter a word. Tonghui then said, “Meng Jiang remains yet in Meng Tian’s camp. By my reckoning, she will soon follow her husband to the underworld. By our skill, even if the demons remained, one of us would suffice to deal with them; with your help, we could surely rescue her. Yet the guardians now are but a troop of worthless men. To rescue her would be no more effort than blowing away dust. But my master has repeatedly forbidden me to meddle in this idle matter; it truly makes me anxious and resentful.”

Xiangu said, “Since the master so commands, and Senior Uncle Tieguai has also spoken thus, and since it is said this ill-fated pair may find blessing only in death, then perhaps we should let them endure this momentary suffering, that they may enjoy eternal happiness. Were we to act rashly with our little skills, we would not only harm ourselves but perhaps harm others; prudence is needed.” Tonghui sighed and said no more.

It was now that they arrived at Tieguai’s dwelling, where Tieguai himself, Fei Changfang, and Zhongli Quan had come forth to welcome them, laughing and saying, “It is no easy matter for old friends to travel far; truly a fortunate meeting.” Tonghui hastened forward, saluted him as master uncle, and conveyed the greetings of her teacher, Perfected Wenmei. Tieguai returned the salute with a smile, saying, “All things have their destiny. Zhang Guo is your senior brother; is it not strange that he should be rescued by the young lady?”

As they spoke, all entered and took their places according to rank. Tonghui laughed to Xiangu, “You are the elder, and Zhang Guo is my senior brother; it should be for me to carry him. But as this matter is your achievement, we are newly acquainted and it is awkward to divide the merit; so I have borne the burden all along. Forgive me.” These words made Tieguai and Xiangu laugh heartily. Tieguai said, “I know you are only lazy, and have no such pettiness; if you did, you would not be Tonghui.” Tonghui laughed likewise, and then met with Fei Changfang and others, speaking casually of Daoist matters, while Tieguai alone fetched a cup of cold water and sprinkled it upon Zhang Guo’s face. He said, “Zhang Guo has been poisoned by a most venomous herb from the sea. I can easily awaken him, but as his stubborn body has not yet shaken off the poison, it might reach his heart and bring him harm. Therefore I use this most careful method, which both clears the poison and invigorates the spirit. In about half an hour he will awaken and join your talk.” All agreed.

Tieguai smiled to Tonghui, saying, “Congratulations on your great progress, that you can gauge the heart and deceive our sister disciple almost to death.” Tonghui laughed heartily; Fei Changfang and the others did not understand, but Xiangu told them the story, and the two laughed as well. Tieguai said, “This is no marvel; all immortals can know past and future. The past is easy to perceive; the future is hard to know, and knowledge of the future varies with the length of time. Like myself and Perfected Wenmei, we can foresee centuries ahead. But to perceive at a glance, or to sense intuitively, is limited to the present. The future must be reckoned and calculated. As with your senior brother Tonghui, she can discern the thoughts of others with unerring accuracy, and can transform objects great and small. Our sister disciple is simple-hearted, and naturally was deceived by her.”

This made Xiangu and Tonghui smile again. Tieguai was about to continue when Zhang Guo suddenly shouted, “Fie, this is stifling!” and awoke. He rose, opened his eyes, and seeing Tieguai and Tonghui, doubted, thinking he was still dreaming. Tonghui hastened to comfort him, and told him in detail of the order to rescue him, and that He Xiangu had first saved him. Zhang Guo then thanked them, and turned to salute Tieguai. Tieguai stayed his hand, and all remained seated. Tieguai asked Tonghui, “Did the master ever reproach Zhang Guo for his rashness?” Tonghui laughed and replied, “I was just about to ask senior uncle about this matter; the master said that when he saw you, he would understand, and that he wished for your guidance.”

Tieguai sighed and said, “The spiritual power of the immortals can perceive the past and future; if words slip carelessly from the mouth, and are uttered rashly, is it not to contravene destiny and bring sin upon oneself? You who are beginners always accuse your teachers of withholding the future; how can you know that there is much difference and subtlety, and that one cannot speak carelessly? Some things may be spoken today but not yesterday; some things all know, yet I may speak and another may not; even those who hear may be able to hear some things but not others. All depends on fate and destiny; the principle is fine and the boundary strict. But there is no time to explain now; we must first go and rescue the soul of Meng Jiang, and also bring back her husband’s soul. A moment’s delay will cause them much added suffering; this is not the mind of a benevolent man.”

Having said this, he told Tonghui and Xiangu, “You two go with me and have a look.” They rejoiced greatly and followed him. With a single leap of the art of shrinking the earth, they arrived at a place where a high mountain stood before them, and behind was a great river. Upon the mountain was a great troop of men tying a beautiful woman, and scraping off piece by piece of her white tender flesh with sharp blades, casting the pieces into the water. The woman was already dead and so felt no pain, yet the onlookers closed their eyes, unwilling to watch; some could not hold back their tears and burst into loud lamentation. One first began to weep, then the multitude joined in, and in a moment the whole valley echoed with weeping and the mountain shook. The generals on the mountain were enraged, and ordered the soldiers to descend and kill them. This caused the crowd to flee in disarray. The soldiers pursued fiercely, capturing dozens. Tonghui, no longer able to endure, regardless of consequences, turned and blew a breath upon the ground. Immediately the sky darkened, the earth grew dim, the sun lost its light, sand and stones flew and rolled, striking fiercely at the soldiers’ heads. The soldiers were frightened and fled howling. The stones seemed to know their targets; suddenly the largest struck a general upon the head, breaking his brow and drawing blood. He clutched his head and knelt, crying out, “Heaven, have mercy!” Those captured seized the chance to escape.

Tieguai nodded and sighed, saying, “These petty villains are so cruel and venomous; to make them suffer a little is not improper, but it ought not be too much.” Then he made a seal and pointed, and the wind ceased, the sun rose, and all was silent. Only the flesh of Meng Jiang remained floating upon the water, not blown away. Tieguai, Tonghui, and Xiangu marveled in secret. Tieguai said, “First we will transform these fragments into a thing, so that they may remain forever in the world.” He extended his finger and drew a talisman, uttering the incantation, “Swift!” The fragments immediately gathered in one place, as though united. Tieguai then traced the sword around the mass dozens of times; each circle caused one circle of flesh to scatter and transform into countless pure white little fish, delicate as jade or snow, which swam forth in all directions. When at last all the meat was dispersed, the river was full of these little fish, swimming and darting about, most beautiful. Tieguai raised his sword and shouted, and suddenly the myriad little fish all bowed their heads thrice in unison, then dispersed. Tieguai’s hand seemed to clutch at something; he hurriedly opened a gourd and put it inside.

What this thing might be, we shall see in the next chapter.
