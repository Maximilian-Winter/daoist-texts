# Chapter 051: The City Filled and Vows Sealed Find Their Fulfilment at Last; New Bonds of Affection and Good Deeds End in Emptiness

Now it came to pass that the Master Iron Crutch spoke to Zhongli Quan, saying: “Once again you have guessed aright. Since you delight so much in guessing, I will try you once more. Tell me, do you think that Hou Yi, having offended the same as she, is indeed the former incarnation of Fan Qiliang, and that the two were relegated together to the mortal world?” Zhongli Quan, without much thought, laughed and replied: “According to my humble understanding, Hou Yi is certainly not the former self of Fan Qiliang, much less did he descend with Chang’e together. How can this be so? That Hou Yi was guilty of great crimes, having been sentenced by the Jade Emperor, doomed to confinement for five thousand years, after which he would return to his appointed place among the stars. His fate has been settled by Heaven’s decree, how could it be reversed? Moreover, the couple Meng Jiangnu and her husband, having already received the Master’s grace, were sent to the Netherworld, then transmigrated to the mortal realm. The Master has prepared for their transcendence; it is apparent that the future of this couple is exceedingly bright. If Hou Yi were such a demon, how could he have such a different destiny? It follows that Meng Jiangnu is indeed Chang’e descended to earth, but Fan Qiliang is another altogether. As to this person’s origin, or why he and Meng Jiangnu should be husband and wife for two lifetimes, this is beyond my knowledge. There is yet another clear proof. For hundreds and thousands of years until now, we can still behold the great Sal tree in the moonlight, the rice basket hanging upon it, and one crouching beneath the tree. This is plainly the story of Hou Yi as told by the Master. It further shows that since his banishment, Hou Yi has never left the tree beneath the Moon Palace. As the Master said, the Jade Emperor, in sentencing him, showed leniency. Having already been lenient, how could it be reduced further? I fear that before five thousand years have passed, the Black Tiger Star official will have no hope of returning to his place. Yet all those living within the five thousand years can surely behold Hou Yi beneath the Sal tree of the Moon Palace, suffering the punishment of sawing the tree. This is his own doing; except for the Jade Emperor’s great pardon, who else could alleviate his sentence by sending him to earth, and by the Master’s special grace rescue him to become a true immortal ascending from the world?”

As Zhongli Quan spoke these words, the Immortal Maiden and the other three laughed aloud. Master Iron Crutch nodded and smiled, saying: “This child is truly clever. It is remarkable that without reflection he should have such insight, which accords exactly with the facts, without the slightest error. Is not this the highest wisdom? At that time, Chang’e, moved by affection for Hou Yi, was deluded day by day; how could the Star Lord not have heard? When he became aware, he was naturally exceedingly angered, and immediately summoned her, severely reprimanding her and sentencing her to fall to the mortal world. Chang’e, knowing the gravity of her offense, dared not plead forgiveness, but fell prostrate weeping in silence. Yet the Star Lord’s heart was somewhat moved; secretly employing his divine mechanism, he calculated her fate, furrowing his brow with sorrow. He bade Chang’e rise and stand aside to await the decree. Then he sent for the Moon Elder, who entered the hall and was asked personally about matters of human marriage. If a good match were impossible, the bond of husband and wife could be dispensed with. The Moon Elder reported: ‘All things hold their fixed destiny. Where the number is to unite, even force cannot sever it; where it is fixed in destiny, there is only nominal relationship without real connubial tie. Such nominal bond was settled five hundred years ago, and cannot be evaded.’ The Moon Elder added: ‘May I ask, Star Lord, does this decree pertain to Chang’e’s case?’ The Star Lord nodded slightly. The Moon Elder said: ‘The matter was long ago determined by fate. Chang’e’s destiny is yet to join in marriage with a mortal for two lifetimes, thus establishing the foundation and attaining the immortal rank. Star Lord, you need not grieve on her behalf.’

The Star Lord heard this and nodded, bidding the Moon Elder to withdraw. He then turned to Chang’e saying: ‘Though you are banished to the mortal realm, this is your own fault. Who gave you leave to let affection bud privately, to disturb the pure Moon Palace and break the solemn order? Were it not for my prior punishment, you would certainly meet heavier penalties from Heaven. At that time you would descend to the nine dark hells. Even if your former master, the Queen Mother, should take pity, she could not save you. Better that I deal with you first; so long as you live on earth as a chaste and virtuous woman, and perform good deeds, you may atone for your sins and return again to the immortal ranks. This is a way to lighten the burden by avoiding the heavier. If you are sensible and understanding, you should comprehend this truth. Go down and live well, that you may have a good outcome and bright future, then you will know I meant well by you. You should also visit the Jade Pool to see your former master and report the cause of this affair. I fear you may be ashamed to speak, so I will send someone to accompany you. When you arrive, your former master will know all, and it will not be necessary for you to declare it yourself. Take good care of yourself. Since matters are thus, you cannot stay here long; depart the hall quickly.’

Chang’e received the order and knelt to kowtow several times, then went out of the court, shamefaced and tearful. Female immortals under the Star Lord’s command, supervising two attendants, escorted her out of the boundary. When they reached the Jade Pool, Chang’e made obeisance before the Queen Mother. The Queen Mother would not blame her much, but gave orders to the escort: ‘Return and say to the Princess that Chang’e is to transmigrate to the mortal world; this matter will be arranged by us here, so the Princess need not trouble herself.’ The messenger bowed in thanks and departed. The Queen Mother then commanded the clerks to ascertain where Chang’e should be reborn. The clerks reported that the Meng couple were faithful people and deserved a good daughter. The Queen Mother ordered Chang’e to incarnate into the Meng family. Chang’e thanked and parted, following the escort, slowly journeying toward the Central Plain. Along the cloud road, suddenly they saw a pale blue-white cloud, bearing a handsome child who came forward from a side and walked alongside Chang’e. Chang’e saw the child’s countenance was fair and lovely, and thought him exceedingly charming. Unconsciously she glanced at him several times. Unexpectedly the child, very obedient, noticed her gaze and smiled, asking: ‘Sister, are you the Chang’e of the Moon Palace?’ Chang’e laughed and said: ‘Child, how do you know my name?’ The child joyfully answered: ‘Sister, don’t think me small; my years are many times greater than yours.’ Chang’e laughed and scolded: ‘Nonsense, how can you so small a person claim to be older than I?’ The child smiled and said: ‘If I produce my proof, you must allow me to be your husband. If I cannot produce proof, you may beat and scold me as you please, and I will not resist or reply. Is that well?’ Chang’e, hearing this, blushed and spat a few times, thinking that since he was but a child and spoke in jest, there could be no firm reason. Moreover, she found him so adorable and wished to play with him, so she laughed and said: ‘What a shameless naughty child! At such a young age to want a wife! You say you can prove it, and yet are not ashamed.’ The child laughed and said: ‘Since sister says so, you have allowed my request. Sister, we are both immortals of Heaven; what we say is as firm as a mountain, no joking.’ Chang’e laughed and chided: ‘Your glib tongue is beyond measure; have you no parents or teachers to discipline you?’ The child stretched out a little arm and tightly clasped Chang’e’s jade arm, refusing to let go; he raised his head and smiled, saying: ‘Sister, you say all is bad of me, but you have not forbidden me to be your husband. This clearly means you consent a thousand times over. Now I will tell you the proof that I am older than you.’

Master Iron Crutch, telling this, caused all listeners to laugh loudly. Zhongli Quan found it most amusing, clapping his hands and stamping his feet, saying: ‘Master, see, even immortals have naughty children. How is it that you all call me naughty and annoying?’ Tonghui laughed and said: ‘This one’s naughtiness is even greater than yours; when you become an immortal you should go and pay him homage as a naughty teacher, and so take a fairy for your wife. Is not naughtiness sometimes a good thing? From now on we will no longer blame you for your naughtiness.’ Master Iron Crutch laughed also and said: ‘This child later became Fan Qiliang. For the sake of a wife he suffered such great loss, and you still praise him!’ Then he added: ‘At that time the thing that most aroused Chang’e’s suspicion was that when this child twisted that arm of hers, it was as if something golden had locked it fast; not even a motion could be made. She was frightened and said: “Child, how can you have such great strength? Let go quickly, or if you pull further, my arm will be broken.” The child would not comply, but laughed foolishly and said: “Good sister, dear sister, do you admit that what I say is true? Just nod once and I will let go. If not, I am sorry, but I will have to exert force.”’

Chang’e laughed with him, not foreseeing the future trouble. Yet fearing he might be really violent and she suffer pain to no avail, she thought, what harm is there in nodding once? So she smiled and nodded, saying: ‘Child, is this not already a concession? Now tell me your proof. If you cannot prove it, then be on your guard; I will punish you doubly to warn you against future nonsense and lies.’ The child, seeing she had nodded, let go. Chang’e was ashamed, her face red, and turned away to hasten her journey, no longer heeding him. The child hurried after her and tried again to take her hand. Chang’e, fearing his strength, stood firm and said: ‘You are a cheat! You say not a word of proof, but only seek to gain advantage. How unreasonable!’ The child then told her that he was the younger brother of the Barefoot Immortal, the Dishevelled Immortal. By nature mischievous, he was not favoured by his elder brother, though the brother himself was also a rogue. Many Taoist friends feared his antics. Yet he forbade his younger brothers any naughtiness, so they were not much inclined to obey him. Hearing this, Chang’e could not help laughing.

Master Iron Crutch, recounting this, smiled to himself. The Immortal Maiden and Zhongli Quan could not but laugh heartily. Master Iron Crutch said: ‘At that time Chang’e spoke truly. She said: “You are greatly mistaken. Your brother always loves you and wishes you well. How can he be naughty himself and forbid his brothers to be mischievous? Perhaps because he sees you unwilling to apply yourself, though in the immortal ranks your foundation is not yet secure, you should strive diligently. He himself has long since attained an indestructible body, enduring as Heaven and Earth, and so he may jest lightly without harm. How can you compare yourself with him, and wrongly blame him?”’ 

A few words so spoken made the Dishevelled Immortal shake his head; his hair, scattered on his shoulders, rose one by one as the wind blew, making a more amusing sight. Chang’e, smiling, reached out to tidy his dishevelled hair, but he laughed and said: ‘Sister, what you say is not without reason, but I do not quite believe it. How can it be that children are forbidden to joke and laugh, whereas grown-ups may mock others at will? This is a way I do not understand. Later, when I accompanied my brother to the Peachtree Banquet, I disliked the small peaches and suspected the Queen Mother of slighting me. So I transformed into a worm and stole peaches from her garden. Unexpectedly, the Queen Mother’s power is great; she discovered me and swiftly sent men to catch me. I was frightened and leapt to the ground, also kicking the Queen Mother’s favourite attendant, who returned weeping with the complaint. I was more afraid and tried to escape the garden. But my brother Barefoot Immortal, with his great bare feet, led many to capture me. When I saw my brother, I dared to defy him, not confessing guilt but insulting him. This made the calamity worse. I heard the Queen Mother’s decree: “Stealing peaches is mere mischief, pardonable; kicking the attendant was unintentional, also excusable; but insulting one’s brother is a great breach of propriety. Among the immortals, such misconduct is intolerable.” She severely reprimanded my brother for poor discipline, and degraded me to the mortal world. Should I fail to repent, I shall be cast into the animal realm, never to rise again.” Sister, you must consider, is this matter angering or not? Now I am to see my brother again, then proceed to the mortal world. Sister, by chance we met on the cloud road, and you granted me marriage; having such a romance, my going to earth is not a great loss.’

Chang’e laughed and said: ‘Nonsense! Marriage is a serious matter; how can it be taken so lightly? You are always mischievous, always joking, thus causing trouble repeatedly. Having suffered severe punishment and banishment to the mortal world, you should repent and reform. On the journey, whether you know me or not, if you speak carelessly, you will surely suffer in the future!’ The Dishevelled Immortal, hearing this, stiffened his face and said loudly: ‘Hey, hey, hey! How can you presume to slander another’s marriage? Did I not tell you that immortals do not joke? Much less such great matters are to be spoken lightly. Once spoken, it is a lifelong vow not to be revoked. Even mortals do not lightly break vows; how much less should immortals? With that, he clenched his fist and flexed his arm, ready to quarrel. Chang’e was somewhat afraid, yet recalling the Moon Elder’s words that marriage was fixed five hundred years ago, and all right and wrong had its destiny, not to be decided by childish jokes, she smiled and replied: ‘If you say so, you are determined to have me?’ The Dishevelled Immortal, in a serious voice, answered: ‘How could it be otherwise? Frankly, I care not whether you consent or not, nor if others contend for you; I will have you for sure.’

As they spoke, they passed a city. The Dishevelled Immortal laughed and pointed to the city, saying: ‘Speak plainly, even if for your sake I were seized and imprisoned within this city, buried alive, my restless soul would still not relinquish you.’ Chang’e, hearing him speak thus, half in jest but with earnestness, and seeing his noble bearing and lively wit, was moved. Though he was a child, she had long admired the Barefoot and Dishevelled Immortals as brothers, esteemed and enviable in rank and status, and now her respect grew. Seeing him make this proposal openly and with sincerity, she was deeply touched.

While silently moved and pondering, the Dishevelled Immortal firmly grasped one of her jade hands and gently asked: ‘Sister, having said all this, do you still doubt my sincerity? Honestly, after you descend to earth, as a woman, how can you avoid marrying a man? Since you must marry, why not take me as your fated match?’ Chang’e, shyly, replied: ‘To be frank, I was once a palace attendant in the Moon, among the immortals, living carefree. But one compassionate thought for my tyrannical former husband caused me to break Heaven’s law, and I should have been sent to the Netherworld; yet the Star Lord, out of great mercy, decreed my banishment to earth. This is the present matter, not yet resolved. Now, meeting you on the cloud road and by your few words contracting marriage — though marriage was recorded clearly in the Moon Elder’s register five hundred years ago — I do not know who my husband is. If it be you, that would be ideal. But if there be another, would it not cause further trouble and calamity? Old sins not yet expiated, new sins already sown. You must consider what should be done.’

The Dishevelled Immortal laughed loudly: ‘Though you have long been among the immortals, you do not understand the meaning of fate and marriage. Know this: fate is fate. Those with fate may be bound by a red thread across a thousand li. Those without fate find even face-to-face meetings fraught with difficulties. Now you and I, by chance meeting on the cloud road, speaking aptly, is this not former fate? Having former fate, there is marriage. To me, this is a match made by Heaven and Earth. Otherwise, why would one be at the extreme East and the other at the extreme West, yet both be banished at the same time and meet midway? Tell me, are there many such marvels in mortal marriage? Good sister, if you still refuse me, I dare say, when you go to earth you will not lack others of our rank; but to lightly pass up such a good match is as great a crime as your former offense against Heaven’s law.’

Chang’e, hearing this, could not help but spit and laugh: ‘What a glib tongue! If it is a good match, how could it be passed over? This is no idle talk. Well, well, since you are so sincere, I also consent.’ The Dishevelled Immortal was overjoyed and asked: ‘Sister, can I trust these words? Will you not change your mind?’ Chang’e laughed: ‘Having promised you, how could I change my mind?’ They had just crossed a great river, with mountains on the left; Chang’e pointed to the mountains and river and said: ‘Since you love me thus, I will marry you no matter what. Even if someone should throw me from the mountain into the water, I will not break my vow!’ Having made this agreement, they parted ways to incarnate.

According to reason, such marriage could be accounted a fated coincidence. But both bore sins and were banished, and such laws of Heaven cannot be escaped. Having already undergone punishment, a day’s debt of sin is paid. If husband and wife were truly harmonious, white-haired and respectful, that would not be coming to suffer, but rather to enjoy blessings on earth. Therefore, though the marriage of Fan and Meng be accomplished, it is but an unattainable hope, a mere empty name.”

When Master Iron Crutch finished recounting this tragic history of Fan and Meng, Tonghui asked: “If their marriage is but a phantom flower and moonlit water, why must they still suffer such grievous punishments?” Master Iron Crutch sighed and said: “This need not be explained. In brief, it was their lack of self-examination that caused their misfortune, and they soon forgot their suffering. Meeting midway, they first contracted marriage without speaking a serious word. This was a great offense provoking Heaven’s anger. The Way of Heaven is most subtle; it applies to them the punishment they have consented to bear, exactly fulfilling their oath. This is a method both subtle and just.” All present were struck with awe.

Then the Immortal Maiden asked: “The First Emperor of Qin was so cruel; why has he not yet received retribution?” Master Iron Crutch laughed heartily: “Though only a few days have passed in the mountains, many years have elapsed in the world. You dwell in hidden caverns and cannot know the great changes of the world. Now Ying Zheng has been taken to the Netherworld and is under interrogation. His son Huhai has succeeded him as the Second Emperor. My prophecy that ‘Qin would perish by Hu’ will soon be fulfilled.” Hearing this, all were suddenly enlightened: “So ‘the Hu who destroys Qin’ refers to Huhai. We ourselves could not guess this; how much less could the First Emperor have foreseen it in his son?” Master Iron Crutch smiled and asked the Immortal Maiden: “Do you know how the First Emperor of Qin died?” All were astonished and said: “We would fain ask you.” As Master Iron Crutch was about to reply, there came a sudden gust of wind outside the stone chamber, then silence again. Master Iron Crutch laughed and said: “Fly out to see—Brother Yang has arrived.”

Who the visitor is, we shall see in the next chapter.
