# Chapter Fifty-Four: Fei Changfang Charged with the Governance of Spirits; Xianzhuzi Entrusted with the Defense Against the Jiaolong

It is said that Fei Changfang obtained charge over the spirits and ghosts, and thereupon vowed that he would no longer err or fail in his duties, but would earnestly apply himself to the work, hoping thereby to merit merit and atone for his sins. The Master Iron Crutch, hearing this, smiled faintly and nodded, saying: "So it must be! So it must be!" From his sleeve he produced a scroll of talismanic incantations for subduing spirits, and handed it to Fei Changfang, saying: "This is the shallowest of the three volumes of the Mysterious Scripture. Though shallow, it is not one that all men may learn, nor may it be handled carelessly. But you, being bright and outstanding, will find the study not very difficult. Yet you must not lightly transmit it to others, lest you incur Heaven’s punishment. At the end of the scroll is another treatise concerning the weapons for controlling demons and monsters. You may by the prescribed method forge a peachwood sword, to be used in slaying evil spirits and in awe-inspiring rebellious monsters." Fei Changfang bowed again and accepted.

Master Iron Crutch further spoke: "I knew from the first that you had no destiny to become an immortal; but because of your repeated entreaties I greatly hoped to reverse your fate and polish you to success. Yet human effort cannot overcome Heaven, and the end is as it is. Now I assign you this office so that you may take this opportunity to turn merit against sin. When your sins are done away and your merits are great, this is also a method for recovering your destiny. Moreover, because you have slain ten persons, and their deaths were fraught with many grievances, the spirits of those wronged dead do not disperse their energies. Your Taoist power is weak, insufficient to awe and subdue them. Should they unite to seek vengeance upon you, you would be unable to resist. With this authority, however, all are under your governance, and they cannot again indulge thoughts of revenge. But the work of immortals and gods must be fair and just; how can it rest upon force to oppress others? On the other hand, you must still exert the heart of husband and wife, and help these spirits to transcend, thereby conferring some benefit upon them; this is the most important." The two heard this and bowed their heads in compliance.

Master Iron Crutch added: "Changfang, this is your last chance to establish merit. Though you vow day by day, I still fear that with time your feelings may change, and that a slight carelessness will again bring forth great calamity. I hope you will always be cautious, and not forget these words of today." Having spoken, he paused, and then said: "By my prediction, if you keep your Taoist heart pure and unwavering throughout, even if you fail in this life, in the next there will be hope. Within several hundred years you will achieve little; but after a thousand years you will surely transcend to the Heavenly Mansion, and rank among the Golden Immortals. Mortals who cultivate the Way have, after accumulating merit for ten thousand years, yet not penetrated its depths; some cultivate their bodies according to patterns of things, others seek immortality starting from the human body, passing through countless years. Among your generation in this present life, Zhang Guo is such a man. If you can succeed after a thousand years, though not swiftly, you cannot say it will be difficult. It seems Heaven has a care for you, not out of pity for my shallow Taoist power, which is but little known. As for the real state and detailed circumstances, only the Primeval Lord and the Queen Mother of the Western Pond can know. We cannot reach their knowledge. Yet though the exact details are unknown, this general prophecy can be confidently made. Unless you change your mind halfway, or commit some great evil, losing your office and bringing misfortune upon yourself, there must be no error. You may therefore rest assured and strive diligently to advance. You need not give way to grievance or sorrow, nor to discouragement or despondency."

Fei Changfang prostrated himself, saying: "Your disciple is resolved to act according to your golden instructions. As to the years before success, not to mention more than a thousand, even if it takes over twenty thousand as with Senior Brother Zhang, your disciple will neither grow weary nor lose heart, but will unyieldingly persevere until fully accomplished, never ceasing. I also beg the master’s great kindness to continue instructing and admonishing me. The days of my life are all those granted by the master." Master Iron Crutch nodded assent.

Madam Bai, seeing her husband had finished speaking, also came forward to inquire about her future. Master Iron Crutch smiled and said: "Your former life was not unknown; you were a princess consort in the Warring States period, reincarnated as a human. Soon you will complete your punishment and return whence you came. In the next life you may be reborn as a man, with a great future; this is cause for congratulations. This is also the good fruit of your own austere conduct, and not a matter of fate." Having said this, he further commanded: "You two must now seek an heir. This person has already repented. Before I arrived, I had your Master Uncle go to show some spiritual response to him, guiding him to good. In about a day or two, he will surely return bearing a cangue and ask your forgiveness. Thereafter, your family will be reunited, and you may all live together in harmony. I take my leave."

Having spoken, a flash of golden light filled the chamber with fragrant air. Master Iron Crutch had already slipped away from the Wang household. Arriving at an open space, he ascended into the sky. By chance he met the God Erlang. The two immortals raised their hands in salute. Master Iron Crutch thanked him for his kindness in dealing with Fei Changfang. Erlang laughed heartily: "You and I are alike in wishing to cultivate the younger generation and encourage virtue. Your disciple is my disciple also; what need is there for thanks? When the three days are over, he will come to see me again. I must surely exhort him once more. I fear his hot temper will not be extinguished, lest in the future he be led astray by ghosts; that would be a great misfortune indeed."

It was that though Erlang held a high office, in Taoist arts he was far inferior to Master Iron Crutch. He reckoned the future events would not extend beyond several decades, beyond which all would be vague and unclear. Master Iron Crutch laughed and replied: "Those who govern spirits are often deceived by them; this is to be expected. But I see this lad still has some fortune; if he can diligently persevere, though he may die once after seven hundred years, and cultivate for five hundred more, he shall be reborn in a noble family, and so transcend to the sacred."

Erlang said: "That is well. I have heard that the true lord Liu Bang, wandering drunkenly in the mountains, was possessed by the soul of the former Qin emperor, who inhabited the body of a great serpent intending to devour him. Luckily a Taoist came to help, secretly employing his power to weaken the serpent’s body, so it could not move. Thus Liu Bang was able to slay it with a sword. I also heard this Taoist is named Zhang Guo. I have never heard this name among your ranks. Could he be one who lately attained the Tao? How then was he given such a heavy responsibility and achieved such great merit?" Master Iron Crutch then briefly related Zhang Guo’s birth, his commission to slay the serpent, and his relation in seniority.

Erlang clapped his hands and said: "So Zhang Guo’s former life was that of the bat at Guankou. That being so, he is indeed an official under my charge. As to this fellow’s disposition, it is very good. But somehow he came to know the Old Dragon of Guankou, and had troubles with a certain Jiaolong, stirring up great calamity, causing me to run to the Heavenly Court several times, and once leading troops down below. The matter was unrelated to him, but truly arose from him. Unexpectedly, he has greatly improved, and has now obtained your true transmission, which shows his fortune is not small."

Master Iron Crutch laughed also: "Does Erlang still not forget those old affairs? When speaking of them, he seems yet somewhat resentful. It is said the True Gods have great tolerance, but by Erlang’s present demeanor, his tolerance is indeed very small. I fear before long he will be laughed at by Zhang Guo." They laughed heartily. Erlang then inquired where Master Iron Crutch was going.

Master Iron Crutch was about to reply when suddenly from the north came swiftly a cluster of purple auspicious clouds. Erlang saw them and beckoned with his hand, and the purple clouds paused beside him. Within stood an immortal officer, fair as jade, with a spirit like autumn waters. Erlang greeted him, and smilingly said to Master Iron Crutch: "You both come from the same native place. This is Xianzhuzi, now serving as secretary in the Palace of Supreme Heaven. You have probably not met him, but should have heard of him." Erlang then related the origin of Master Iron Crutch to Xianzhuzi. The two immortals exchanged courteous words of admiration. Erlang laughed: "Immortals have no formalities. We both like to see the ways of mortals; what reason is there otherwise?" Both laughed, and asked Erlang: "Erlang, are you still of the same frank disposition as ever?" Erlang replied: "Born with such a temper, how can I change it? Pray tell, Xianzhu, whence do you come and whither go you? So hastening on your way, yet not spreading your great wings, but choosing to move slowly on these cloud roads."

Xianzhuzi, hearing Erlang disclose his true nature before Master Iron Crutch, felt somewhat embarrassed, and quickly laughed: "Erlang, speak not thus. I am commissioned to investigate the demon energy in the Qiantang River. It is said that a great Jiaolong escaped from the Western Sea, hiding at the estuary, and will soon bring disaster to the world. I have been specially and briefly sent to look into this, and to build a shrine and garrison in the Haining region. If the Jiaolong calamity may be checked, and the disaster somewhat lessened, it would be a blessing to the people." Erlang laughed: "So you are newly honored with a commission to take up your post; congratulations indeed." Xianzhuzi hastened to thank him, and said: "I dare not claim merit. But I must ask your instruction. As a newcomer to external office, I know nothing and fear to err in my duties, to the harm of millions of living beings. Happily meeting Erlang, I earnestly beg you to be generous in your guidance, that I may avoid missteps and disasters; that would be my great happiness."

Erlang, hearing this, grasped Xianzhuzi with one hand and held Master Iron Crutch with the other, laughing heartily: "I am but a soldier, knowing little of human affairs, though many years below. How can I, leaving such a learned and talented Master Iron Crutch here, neglect to consult him, and come to ask a blind man?" Master Iron Crutch, not expecting Erlang’s jest, blushed, and smilingly replied with modesty: "Do not heed Erlang’s nonsense. He has long held a high office and yet claims ignorance of men’s affairs; that is mild modesty, and he even praises me, a novice just entering the Taoist gate, who has yet to penetrate its mysteries. This shows he wishes to tease both me and you. Truly it is most unreasonable." Xianzhuzi, believing Erlang’s words, also laughed: "Do not be so modest, my friend. Erlang is our old and close comrade. I know his nature well; though often playful, he is serious in important matters, and would not jest without reason. As for himself, long acquainted with the people and the world, his experience is rich. Though far away in the Western Heaven, to us he is but half a day’s journey. In future, if difficulties arise, I may well have to trouble him two or three days hence in Guankou. When that time comes, if he remains cold and harsh, I shall invite old friends of the Three Realms to hold a tribunal, and tear down his old nest in Guankou; that will be no small feat. But now he is busy in public affairs, and I dare not detain him. If tomorrow he makes a mistake, he would surely not admit fault, but shift the blame to me, saying: 'It was Xianzhuzi who caused me to fail in my duties.' I cannot risk that."

These words caused Erlang and Master Iron Crutch to laugh heartily. Erlang pointed at Xianzhuzi, laughing and scolding: "Well now, you are sharp in reproach, yet say he is cold and harsh to you. Very well. Since you say I err in my office, I shall pray daily in the small temple at Guankou, entreating Heaven and Earth to let misfortune seek you out, so you may do a few mistaken acts to satisfy my ill humour." Though jesting, Master Iron Crutch’s face suddenly changed; he thought secretly: "Words reveal the heart; these two immortals are true gods with great office, yet why choose not other topics for jesting, but wager their errors against one another? This jest is too unreasonable." As he thought, he silently reckoned the futures of the two immortals, seeing that Erlang would soon lose face by his words, and that Xianzhuzi would suffer great calamity. Yet because these matters concern Heaven’s secrets, he could not speak openly. He hastened to counsel them: "It is rare we meet thus. My wish is to invite you both to ascend Mount Hua. There my young disciples guard the caves. Though the place is small, it is serene. Let me gather the local fruits and show the hospitality of a host. What say you?" The two immortals laughingly declined: "We are busy in official duties, and dare not neglect them. When your public business is done and you return to Heaven, we shall surely visit the Sacred Mountain and pay our respects."

Master Iron Crutch was a warm-hearted immortal; hearing their ill omens, he much desired to take them to Mount Hua, that he might then admonish them. Though Heaven’s decree cannot be escaped, a warning might reduce the calamity, and thus fulfill his friendship. Seeing the two immortals unwilling to go, and their excuse of official business to be true, he could only desist. Then Xianzhuzi said to Master Iron Crutch: "Brother, do not be ceremonious; I have not yet finished. I said Erlang is too busy; I plan to wait until he errs, so when disaster comes I may seek his help. But now I do not need him. As for your learning and virtue, though this is our first meeting, I have long admired you. At Master Li’s place I learned that of the three volumes of the Supreme Mysterious Scripture, only a dozen or so great Golden Immortals may peruse them. You were born latest, yet have the greatest destiny and the Taoist talent to receive this scripture; this shows you are a god of great talent and virtue. I hear Erlang’s modesty is not sincere, and that is the way of one who professes himself a master. Moreover, I have indeed been a layman suddenly called to duty, and in this time of the toxic Jiaolong’s havoc, I fear I cannot fulfill the office without true learning and virtue. From the outset I have been apprehensive, and have petitioned to resign several times, but Heaven’s favour is strong and I cannot decline. I must boldly try, though my heart is anxious, not knowing whether it be fortune or calamity, and earnestly hope for the guidance of a true immortal. Now by chance I meet you, a gentleman, and my heart is at rest. I earnestly hope you will remember the millions of lives in Zhejiang, and the Taoist kinship between us, and do not judge me harshly from this first meeting, but freely instruct me. I will sincerely accept and faithfully obey."

Erlang laughed: "Master Iron Crutch, hearing such earnestness, what manner of politeness can you still keep with him? I cannot wait for you two to exchange such courteous salutations; nor can I endure such delicate refinement; I do not know how your negotiations will end. Excuse me, I must take my leave first. When Brother Xianzhu has taken up his new office, then you may go to the Taoist Court." Saying this, he waved his hand, instantly transforming into a white crane, and soared into the sky. As he flew, he stretched his crane’s neck and nodded a salute to the two immortals. They laughed as they looked at one another: "This man is truly frank and lovable."

Master Iron Crutch now understood that Xianzhuzi was the white crane immortal who had long been charged with Heaven’s duties under the Primeval Lord. Erlang’s earlier jest about why he did not spread his wings to fly, and now his transformation into a crane and soaring away, were both intended to tease him. Master Iron Crutch thought Erlang’s joke too unreasonable. Though jocular, it portended ill. Noticing a slight unease on Xianzhuzi’s face, and his secret sighing, and seeing Erlang’s crane cry as he flew westward and vanished, he said to Xianzhuzi: "You are so modest as to be unashamed to ask below; if I know aught, I shall earnestly tell you, and dare not speak of alienation. Luckily I am a wanderer myself. When you take up your post, I shall surely come to congratulate you. Then we may discuss the local situation and the calamities wrought by the Jiaolong, so as to provide counsel for you to choose from."

Xianzhuzi was greatly pleased: "Since you consent to my intrusion, I shall be at your service always." Master Iron Crutch nodded, smiling: "In this, rest assured; I am never faithless. Moreover, as to the toxic Jiaolong you mention, I seem to know somewhat. If it should appear to disturb the land, I shall carefully inform you of its history and the methods to deal with it, so you shall not be troubled." Xianzhuzi was comforted, and smiling again said: "I have indeed newly taken external office, and much fear to err and harm the people and myself. Now that you promise help, I can be at ease."

Master Iron Crutch, seeing him speak such ill-omened words, was greatly uneasy, and smilingly comforted: "Indeed, such great matters require consultation with several immortals of profound Taoist learning. I have little talent or knowledge, and if you do not refuse me, I shall invite some senior Taoist masters in future to aid us. Only I hope you will be cautious and careful in your dealings, not relying on confidence to breed recklessness, nor shrinking from difficulty through fear. If you can do this long, the anxieties and dangers you foresee will not come to pass." Thus was it spoken.

What further words Xianzhuzi had are unknown; the sequel will be given in the next chapter.
