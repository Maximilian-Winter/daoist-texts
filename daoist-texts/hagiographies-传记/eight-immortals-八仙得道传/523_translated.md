# Chapter 55: Guarding Against Future Perils and Gathering the Zhejiang Tide; Realizing Former Lives and Probing the Dream of Mortal Existence

Now it happened that Xuan Zhuzi, having received the teachings of Master Iron Crutch, went forth to the East Sea to assume his new post. It was so that the Old Flood Dragon of Guankou, after his defeat at Huaihai, had once come to the sea-mouth with intent to break through the Yinglong Sluice, to seize the Qiantang estuary, and to establish himself as king. But his plans were not secret, and the patrol officials of the East Sea learned of the tidings and hastened to inform the Dragon King. The Old Flood Dragon had many followers, and moreover, his cause was aided by the leader of a demonic cult; therefore the Dragon King and his consort took the matter with great gravity, especially since the Queen's maternal tomb was thereabouts. Should the Old Flood Dragon succeed, he would assuredly seek revenge for Guankou and Huaihai, first to inundate and destroy the Queen's maternal resting-place. Thus the Queen herself petitioned for one hundred thousand divine warriors of the sea-folk, who were led by the four princes and their respective great generals, to guard the sea-mouth.

The Old Flood Dragon, seeing the Dragon King's strict vigilance, knew that his scheme could not succeed, and with a sweep of his tail towards the shore, he sent forth waves of ten-thousand fathoms, drowning countless fields, houses, cattle, horses, and people, venting his frustration in this manner. This accords with the common saying, "When the belly aches, one blames the kitchen god." Afterward, the Dragon King reported the matter to the Heavenly Court. The Jade Emperor issued an edict, sending Xuan Zhuzi to the mortal realm to investigate and clarify. In the region of Haining, the local earth deity showed the people a dream, leading to the establishment of a temple in reverence of the Taming Flood and Pacifying Sea Immortal Lord.

After Xuan Zhuzi took office, he twice went to the sea and conferred with the Dragon King and his consort and sons on the strategy to safeguard the Zhejiang sea. Besides petitioning the Heavenly Court to dispatch troops stationed at the temple, and the Dragon King assigning the sea soldiers to defend the straits, there was the matter of the Zhejiang tides, called the Haolong. This was because two mountains stood facing the sea-mouth like a blockade. The upper reaches of the Qiantang River, contrary to the lower, were lofty and surrounded on nearly all sides, thus forming a great tidal current. Before Xuan Zhuzi guarded Haining, high tides were common everywhere. To prevent the Old Flood Dragon from floating tides and sneaking in, he conferred again with the Dragon King and petitioned the great Immortal Lords of sun, moon, and stars to jointly cast spells to draw all the high tides to one place in Haining. Furthermore, the annual tides of Haining, aside from the monthly greater and lesser tides, were all collected after the Zhongyuan Festival. At that time, the raging billows surged and were regarded as a marvel, commonly called the Lonely Soul Tide, known for its power to overwhelm and drown men. Thus the famous Zhejiang tides, from the Qin and Han dynasties to the present, are greatest at Haining. The highest tides occur after the Mid-autumn Festival in the eighth lunar month for this reason.

Since this method was put into effect, the ebb and flow of tides have been guarded at all times by divine soldiers dispatched by Xuan Zhuzi, standing in the air watching near and far. Whenever sea demons cause mischief, they are first seen alone and immediately subdued. Even though the Old Flood Dragon can change his form, sometimes large, sometimes small, his original form is coarse and large. No matter how he changes size or shape, or transforms into other things, unless one has attained the highest degree of the Dao, the transformation is never as comfortable or free as the original body. Those with the lowest cultivation can only sustain a change for a short time; after a while they feel exhausted and immobile. Ordinary beasts, untrained, such as tigers, leopards, jackals, wolves, dogs, horses, hawks, and falcons, can easily kill him. If too long in transformation, the soul cannot return to the original form, and even without enemies, life cannot be preserved. Unlike the highly cultivated and proper immortals, whose bodies exist between being and non-being, and souls between reality and unreality, change or no change is the same. Whether fixed or changing for hundreds or thousands of years, it is no different. In sum, body, mind, and soul have no fixed abode, so there is no possibility of harm. Therefore, except for such true immortals, none dare lightly transform. When forced by circumstances to change form, they are always vigilant, and if the body shows discomfort, they quickly revert to the original form to rest before changing again. This is a necessary practice for cultivators of transformation, a natural hierarchy.

As for the Old Flood Dragon, although he has cultivated many years, he is mostly evil and lazy in his practice, spending tens of thousands of years scheming and contending, which has wasted his time. Thus, in the first thousand years, he progressed swiftly and could shape-change at will; but for the thousand years until now, his skill has not increased, only maintained without decline, which is already rare. At present, he can change one thing, enlarging or shrinking, sustaining it for one or two months. After a day or two, he must revert to his original form to rest before changing again. Compared to the natural, untroubled transformations of the highest celestial immortals, the difference is great. To sustain a change for one or two months is rare indeed. The Old Flood Dragon, associating with lower demons and claiming dominion among them, has grown proud, thinking none can surpass him. Since the great uproar at Huaihai Village and the defeat at the Pearl Palace, he has hidden beneath the sea for a thousand years. Now old habits revive and ambition grows, hence his plan to seize the Qiantang and establish a small independent court. Though the river mouth’s water volume is not great, with many shallows, his large body cannot reside there comfortably. He relies on the great tides of the river, which once surged everywhere, to raise the waters and increase volume, allowing him to appear and vanish. Now, with Xuan Zhuzi and the Dragon King drawing the tides together and guarding the gathering place with divine soldiers, it is difficult for him to enter; even if he sneaks through, the upstream waters are shallow and tides gentle, not suitable for a lurking dragon.

Therefore, the Old Flood Dragon’s ambition pauses, and he dares not think of southern dominion. But his hatred for Xuan Zhuzi is fiercer than for any enemy. Besides going to Lingjiu Mountain to beseech the Tongtian Master for troops to avenge him, he lurks under the sea, waiting for any slight neglect to rise again. Even if he cannot become sovereign, he will make Xuan Zhuzi’s life miserable and prevent him from peace and honor. Such is the venom in the Old Flood Dragon’s heart. Though concealed, he is like King Goujian of Yue, lying on firewood and tasting gall. Xuan Zhuzi naturally guesses the Old Flood Dragon remains; he will not rest and there he daily plans to subdue him, so as to clear him root and branch. The evil and the righteous stand opposed, awaiting the outcome, which shall be told in other chapters.

Meanwhile, turning to Lan Caihe, who has now reached ten years of age since his birth. Betrothed in childhood to Miss Yueying of the River King’s household, the parents of both families are now intimate and friendly; especially Lan Caihe’s father, Lan Wen, and Yueying’s father, Wang Guang, are both generous and untroubled by trifles. Seeing their children grown and for convenience of instruction, Lan Wen engaged a teacher surnamed Mao to teach at home. Wang Guang wished also to hire a teacher but, though respected, his circumstances were not prosperous enough to afford one; furthermore, rural areas seldom have renowned teachers, and for a girl it is especially necessary to choose wisely. While searching, Lan Wen was about to open his school. He held a grand feast to welcome the teacher and invited several respectable local gentlemen as guests. Wang Guang, as father-in-law and friend, was naturally among the invitees.

At the banquet, Wang Guang saw the teacher Mao, whose white hair and beard marked him as an elder; his demeanor was one of propriety and restraint, evidently a man of high virtue and upright conduct. Wang Guang was greatly respectful and impressed with his learning. Suddenly a thought occurred and he smilingly said to Lan Wen: "Your blessings are indeed great to invite such a good teacher. I hold him in highest esteem. My daughter and your son are of the same age; this year I intend for her to study several years. Though it is not necessary for a girl to be learned, given our families’ circumstances, it would be unseemly if she is illiterate. Moreover, she is betrothed to your son and will become a Lan household daughter-in-law. Your family has a literary tradition, and your ladies have been skilled in poetry and prose. If my daughter lacks some basic learning, after marriage she will bring little honor among the sisters-in-law. I wish to cultivate her for three to five years, not expecting much, but so she can understand literature and philosophy, and recognize the great principles of the sages; that would suffice. This thought I have long held, but being in a remote village I cannot find a good teacher, which vexes me. Now seeing your teacher’s virtue and learning, I regret that we have no occasion to become acquainted. I have made up my mind to ask your generous consent."

Lan Wen quickly replied: "We are close friends; what could be refused? But pray state your wishes, and I shall comply with all respect." Wang Guang said: "I wish to send my daughter to your household school. This will save me the trouble of further seeking a teacher; also, my daughter is not dull and may study and discuss together with your son. Though betrothed, custom forbids the young couple to meet; but in families like ours, why be bound by such customs? Besides, the children are yet young, and no suspicion need be feared. After a year or two, if I find a good teacher, we can reconsider. May I ask if you can agree?" Lan Wen laughed: "That is the best of plans; how could I refuse? But I fear your wife will be reluctant to part with your daughter." Wang Guang laughed: "If you agree, my wife will have no objection. Our ladies already visit each other like old relatives, and the two homes are not far apart. Should my wife miss the girl, she can cross the river at any time to visit; I doubt she will make trouble." Lan Wen laughed: "That is excellent. Tomorrow school starts too late; the day after I will send a carriage and horse to ferry the young lady across the river to your home." Wang Guang was delighted and added: "I must consult my wife to choose an auspicious day, then send her without ceremony." Lan Wen agreed.

Returning home, Wang Guang told his wife Niushi. She at first disapproved: "This is our only daughter, already promised to another. When grown, she must marry out. Now so young, it is good to keep her company a while longer; why send her away to study, trusting others to care for her? I have also heard that the Lan family matron, Madam Hu, is a sharp and difficult woman. My daughter is innocent and naïve. If she offends Madam Hu and they bear grudges, after marriage she will suffer all her life. Is this worth the risk?"

Wang Guang felt some misgivings, but he cared for face. Having spoken, and requested the favor, to withdraw would invite ridicule. He therefore spoke sternly to Niushi: "These are your womanly fears. The families are close, and even after marriage they can visit daily; why must you cling to constant companionship to show maternal affection?" Niushi, fearing her husband’s resolve, knew there was no use in opposing him. To quarrel would only hurt their marriage. After some thought, she reluctantly consented and chose an auspicious day three days hence to send Yueying across the river to study at the Lan home.

Though a girl, Yueying was generous and courteous since childhood. From age seven, her father had sent her to school, and she had filled her mind with many classics and poems. Yet her favourite study was not these writings but the teachings beyond the world, especially the Taoist canon of Laozi’s Dao De Jing. By eight or nine years old she had mastered it thoroughly. Now at ten, her knowledge was still fuller, able to grasp the meaning beyond words, often burning incense and reciting silently, pondering with sudden insight. As to other Daoist scriptures, she studied them without weariness, seeking to understand truth. Her heart was clear and serene, with thoughts of transcendence. Reflecting on former lives, she saw that many cruel affairs had sprung from marriage. Now the first barrier was the two words 'husband and wife', which must be broken. But she knew not whether Lan Caihe, her companion through the same calamity and birth, would, after years of indulgence in wealth and luxury, remain free from desire and false thoughts. If his heart changed, he would surely use marital ties to press her. Then except for earnest admonition, if she failed to turn back, she would have to preserve herself alone, journey far to Mount Taihua, and seek her former master. She thought her master’s virtue was great and would surely find a way to save him; then she could be at ease. These thoughts often filled her mind, but she dared not speak a word before her parents.

Sometimes sitting with her sisters and friends, each expressed a wish, some for wealthy husbands, others for talented men; only she sat silent, her eyes closed, absent from their talk. They laughed, saying: "You have a good husband already; your heart is clearly settled, no need to worry." Yueying coldly laughed and said: "Each heart is different. My aims are quite opposite; how could I join your talk?" They asked: "What then are your aims?" She smiled: "There are many talented men as numerous as mountains, yet none live a hundred years, decaying like plants; wealthy men have riches like seas, but after sixty or seventy years, when spirit declines, money is useless. Moreover, the world is uncertain; wealth often brings calamity; thus it is the most unreliable and useless thing. Yet men fail to see this and waste their limited years on fame, pleasure, and gain. When uncertainty suddenly arrives, all is lost. Their struggles and ambitions cannot be carried away beyond death. Therefore, sisters, the things you hope for please me not." Hearing this, they laughed and said: "You do not tell us your aims, only criticize ours; what is the use?" Yueying sighed and said: "You take my words as idle criticism; so I will not explain further, nor need I." They laughed and let it go.

Seeing her companions born with talent and beauty, yet bound by fame and gain, with no autonomy, Yueying felt deeply that the words 'fame and gain' were invisible shackles, axes that cut nature itself, most fearful indeed. She feared that her Lan husband might be similarly ensnared by such trifles, losing clarity of mind. Then, this incarnation would lose hope of the Dao, adding demonic obstacles and great calamities, and betray the good intentions of Master Iron Crutch, forever losing the chance to enter the Way. Such thoughts filled her with worry for him. But already married, she could not meet him before the wedding, and though she wished to warn him, she had no opportunity. She was a woman of deep feeling and loyalty, connected by life and death to Lan Caihe, their bond arranged by the immortal master; she could not forsake him and seek the Way alone. Alas, her quiet heart was troubled by others’ futures, never at peace.

While pondering thus, she overheard her father in her mother’s chamber speaking of Lan Gongzi: "Young and handsome, diligent and talented, likened to great ministers of old, expected to reach high office before twenty; a man of ambition. Yueying’s future is assured." Madam Liu, loving her daughter, hearing her prospective son-in-law’s promise, could not but be pleased. Turning, she saw Yueying standing quietly, deep in thought.

Madam smiled and said to her husband: "See, our Yue’er hears your words but says nothing. What means this?" Wang Guang laughed: "A girl who knows modesty like this is good." Madam Liu embraced Yueying, caressing her face and smiling: "My child, did you not hear how ambitious and talented the young man is? So young and already planning to surpass many and become a great official! When he becomes great, won’t you be a fine lady?"

Hearing her father’s words, Yueying’s heart was troubled. She had not expected the issues she pondered to become reality, which distressed her greatly; nor that her mother would speak thus, disregarding her heart and uttering such unpalatable and insincere words. How could she endure? Her cheeks flushed, tears quickly rolled down her face, startling her parents who asked in alarm: "Dear child, what troubles you?"

How Yueying answered is to be unfolded in the next chapter.
