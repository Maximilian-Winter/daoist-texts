# Chapter Fifty-Six: Miss Wang Advises her Husband to Cultivate the Way; Uncle Hu Aids his Sister in Conspiracy

It is said that Yueying was reincarnated as a mortal, her spirit unclouded; though she dwelt amid silks and brocades, her thoughts ever turned to cultivating the Way. Yet her cultivation was unlike that of others: while others sought only personal perfection, she found herself bound in life and death with Lan Caihe. Caihe could not ascend to immortality, and Yueying could not attain the Way alone. This was not because of any real obstacle, but because the ties between them had been long and deep; they felt that to be born and to die together, to pass through mortal flesh in concert, and to enter the immortal realm as one, was a natural principle and an inevitable condition. If one failed to attain the Way, the other could not abandon him and proceed alone. The readers, having learned of their former life's affection, may well believe this without doubt. The immortals, though they seem most unfeeling, are also most affectionate; precisely because of their affection, they must base themselves upon detachment. It is only thus that their passionate sorrow and depth of feeling become manifest.

Yueying was originally of immortal stock, and was guided by celestial immortals to transcend her errors and show her the true path. At this moment of entering the world and preparing to depart from it, she could see through all else, except for this one word, *feeling*; in other matters, she could for a time cast them aside, but regarding her deep relation with Lan Caihe, she could by no means bear to abandon him and journey separate ways.

According to modern speech, this would be called a matter of conscience. Among all the affairs of the world, none are more difficult to resolve than the two words 'conscience.' A robber may boldly carry arms and plunder his victims; disobedient children may strike and scold their parents. Yet at the moment of death, their conscience awakens in every case. The awakening of conscience is tenfold more severe than the punishment of the law. Such is the matter of conscience. The evil man does evil without fear of heaven or earth, but he dreads the awakening of conscience. Much less would an immortal cultivating the Way disregard conscience and act selfishly. In general, the use of conscience is what has been called human feeling above; and the substance of human feeling is conscience. What conscience and feeling forbid, even the most foolish disciple of the Way would firmly reject.

For example, Yueying’s delicate heart, having resolved to leave the world, was originally very calm and steady; yet the matter of her future husband agitated her inmost thoughts. She was near to losing sleep and appetite, all because her conscience was stirred, and her feelings awakened; she could not abandon Caihe, nor pursue personal perfection alone. She felt that such a course was not only irrational, but against her own conscience she was utterly unwilling to take it. Her daily worry was chiefly that Caihe was ensnared by worldly desires; hearing that Caihe was so captivated by fame and gain, she perceived that all her previous anxieties were now realized. Her parents, wishing for their daughter's happiness, were naturally joyful to have found such a suitable son-in-law; they thought their daughter must be more content than themselves. But Yueying harboured other feelings, and upon hearing of this contrary to her own resolve and increasing her suffering, her heart was suddenly seized with anguish; she could not restrain her tears, which fell in two streams. This left Wang Guang and his wife perplexed; they could not fathom their daughter's thoughts or intentions, nor what feelings moved her. Both husband and wife could not help but ask in unison, ‘My beloved child, what ails you? Is there still dissatisfaction with this excellent fiancé?’

Though Yueying’s heart was troubled, in ancient times a maiden was wont to be reserved on matters of marriage or her betrothed; she was bound to keep her thoughts unspoken. Moreover, Yueying was of a very gentle nature; having not forgotten the affection of her past life, how could she be displeased with her present parents? She well knew they loved Caihe deeply, and Caihe in youth had set his resolve, of whom no ill word could be said. How could Yueying speak frankly that she pitied him for being blinded by worldly feelings and desires, fearing he could not cultivate the Way? Since she could not speak thus, and her parents pressed her in sorrowful inquiry, she was forced to utter a lie, saying she was somewhat unwell and could not endure it, thus troubling her parents. Now she was better, and begged them to rest assured. Having said this, she forced a smile, whereupon the elderly couple exchanged looks and smiled; Wang Guang said, ‘A young girl, hearing of her fiancé, should be shy; that is the way of a lady of our family.’ His wife agreed. They knew well Yueying’s words were excuses, but mistook them for modesty. These few words unwittingly cleared Yueying’s difficulty.

From that day forth, Yueying’s heart was filled with many vexations and bitter discontent, which she could only conceal within; before her parents, she still forced smiles to avoid their worry. At night, when all was still and she sat alone in her fragrant chamber, her thoughts would wander and she would pace by her couch, restless and uneasy. Her only hope then was to depart the family soon, to meet with Caihe, and daily admonish him, telling him the causes and effects, the various matters of their past. Caihe had the wisdom and immortal affinity of former times; such momentary confusions were but later temptations, not beyond understanding. If he could awaken, the two could both become disciples, seek the immortal masters, quickly end their sins, attain the Way, and ascend to Heaven; the time would not be far. If Caihe’s confusion was too deep and unyielding, she would guard her vital Yang and cultivate the mysteries alone; when she reached a certain degree, she would leave home and seek the master, endeavoring to enlighten Caihe. In any case, as long as Caihe did not awaken, she dared not leave the mortal world. This was her newly borne sorrow. She only lamented that their youth was too young, and marriage must await time. During this long interval, Caihe daily approached worldly snares, and she feared that with each day his thoughts grew heavier, perhaps beyond remedy; or that by guarding her own Way she might harm their conjugal affection, which was more painful still.

This one thought of Yueying robbed her of sleep and appetite, so that she was near to sickness; yet Heaven granted her wish. Wang Guang suddenly cast aside custom, and suggested that the young couple study together. Yueying heard this and thought the time to admonish Caihe had come; her heart rejoiced and her spirit soared. She smiled and spoke freely, changed in manner; this drew the sisters to tease her, saying that at her age she hoped to be with her husband, how unshy she was! These words made Yueying feel very wronged; yet she could only smile and say nothing. At the appointed auspicious day, Wang Guang and his wife accompanied Yueying across the river. There Lan’s father and son also came at the appointed hour with sedan and horses to meet her at the river mouth.

The young couple met for the first time, seeming old acquaintances; they soon forgot bashfulness and showed mutual affection. On the road they spoke little; but on arrival at home, Caihe was as one mad with joy, leading Yueying in to pay respects to elders and meet brothers and sisters of the same generation. These were young and fond of amusement, and could not refrain from jesting about Caihe; he smiled throughout and made no reply. Caihe’s mother, Madam Wu, seeing her future daughter-in-law, loved her dearly, her eyes narrowed with smiles, and held her in her arms, calling her ‘treasure’ and ‘darling’ ceaselessly. Yueying was truly obedient and conformed to their ways, calling her ‘mother’ and ‘father’ as if she were Lan Wen’s own daughter. Madam Wu ordered Yueying to sleep in the same room as herself, that she might personally tend her, and moved the beloved son Caihe to a rear suite. Yueying rejoiced in her respected aunt’s favour.

This aside, it may be said that Caihe had never forgotten his former life. At five he began schooling, at seven he could compose poetry and prose. His aspirations were as Yueying’s, to cultivate immortality and the Way, not to seek worldly fame or gain. Yet because the Lan family had been officials for generations, their friends and kin were also officials. From childhood the children studied with the hope of becoming magistrates and governors. The elders exhorted the children to aspire to official rank and glorify their ancestors. Being but young, Caihe daily dwelt among these influences and without knowing it exchanged his innate will for theirs, intent upon continuing his forebears’ mission, feeling there was no alternative. Lan Wen and his wife were naturally pleased. Madam Wu told Yueying of Caihe’s resolve and diligence; Yueying dared not speak ill, but followed custom, praising him. Madam Wu was even more pleased.

On the day Yueying went to school, the young couple sat facing each other in the study. Master Mao was indeed a learned gentleman, instructing these pupils with such skill that they could read much at a glance and understand much on a single reading. Every day he sat in his study without absenting himself. Thus their studies progressed swiftly. Yet Yueying had another plan: in spare moments she would place several Taoist books she had read before upon the desk, and read them aloud to Caihe.

At first Caihe suspected her of showing off her learning, and paid little attention. But as days passed and their affection grew, all reserve vanished. Caihe then asked, ‘Sister, why do you love to read such Taoist books?’ Yueying was eager for this question, smiled, and replied, ‘Brother, have you forgotten? These are the very books that we ought to read.’ Caihe laughed heartily, ‘So it is! Sister wishes to explain our former lives. A husband and wife of one lifetime who suffered such bitter fate, recalling it brings sorrow and despair. Fortunate that now, reborn and reunited, aided by immortal masters, matched as husband and wife to renew our bond, it is surely right to live joyfully this life, to compensate for past wrongs. Why then seek life in the Way? Whether we attain the Way is uncertain; but to devote a lifetime of happiness to the Eastern Sea is too great a loss. I confess, brother, that I once thought to cultivate the Way; but reflecting on the brevity of life, I deemed it not worth the hardship. Endurance is one matter, but the Way is so remote and uncertain, success doubtful. Not to speak of others, many have sought the Way since ancient times; why then do we know so few who have attained it? Thus I resolved to abandon former aims, and instead study the sages’ teachings, preparing to enter service in the royal court, that I may share with you the wealth and honour of the world. What say you?’ Yueying quickly replied, ‘Brother, your words err. Those who cultivate immortality do so because the years of mortal life pass swiftly; even a hundred years are but fleeting clouds. Of that hundred years, cutting off the ends to live a life of great wealth and honour, how long can such pleasures last? How compare with immortals beyond the world, free and untrammelled, sharing the longevity of Heaven and Earth, the permanence of sun and moon? Though cultivation involves hardship and peril, these are but for a short while; the losses are small, but the gains infinite. How can this be deemed unprofitable? As for the difficulty of attainment, it is indeed true; yet Heaven does not disappoint the diligent. Those without affinity for the Way cannot succeed; but those who are resolute may yet attain. Moreover, we have the predestined ties of former lives, and now are guided and helped by immortals; if no former bond existed, why would the immortal masters care so? Thus what is difficult for others may be easy for us; we must not abandon ourselves. You say the number who have attained immortality is few. As I know, there are not a few among the ten continents beyond the sea, in the upper and middle worlds, golden immortals, celestial immortals, earthly immortals, spirit immortals. Compared with all the living of past and present, it is indeed rare to attain; but the rarity is the value of the Way’s attainment. Were all able to cultivate, and all become immortals, the Way would be common, and immortals unworthy of mention. I advise you always to remember our former lives, and turn early, to not disappoint the immortal masters’ kindness and the Lord of the Underworld’s care. Moreover, once ascended, endless joy awaits, far beyond mortal wealth and honour. Besides, your wish to serve the royal court and enjoy glory is itself uncertain; do you truly hope for it?’

Caihe laughed heartily, ‘Sister, you are indeed bewitched! Since we are born in the world, whether to cultivate or not, we should strive mightily, that future generations may know of Lan Caihe, and that my life be not in vain. If then success and fame come, and our immortal affinity endures, we may strive again with you for success. If not, at least by then I will be old and near death, so not much will be lost. What say you?’ Yueying perceived his delusion was deep; mere words could not save him. She kept her thoughts, waiting for opportunity to admonish again.

Meanwhile Yueying had been at the Lan household studying for half a year, where Lan Wen and his wife cherished her as if she were a treasure, sometimes more tenderly than their own son Caihe.

Lan Wen’s wife, Madam Hu, had a son and a daughter, but both were thick-headed and dull-witted. The old couple showed little favour towards them. Madam Hu resented this, saying that since all children were born of the master, how could there be favouritism? Her husband heard but would not argue, and allowed her to make a fuss for a time, then let it pass. Now that an incoming daughter-in-law arrived, who was so beloved, even Lan Wen regarded her as a jewel in the palm. Yet towards Madam Hu’s children there was no change, no increase of kindness on account of Yueying.

From Madam Hu’s eyes it was clear that Lan Wen and his wife, having Yueying, cherished their own children with yet greater jealousy and envy; how could she endure? At first she murmured discontent in private and public; later, seeing Lan Wen and his wife paid no heed, she grew bolder. Yet Yueying was young, devoted to the Way, and knew little of the treacheries of the world or the deceit of human hearts; living secluded in her chamber, she cared not to concern herself with common affairs. Since coming to the Lan household, apart from daily study and mutual discussions with Caihe, she only accompanied Madam Wu in needlework. To others she showed little courtesy; yet since none bore ill will, though they noted her aloofness, they thought her shy and taciturn, seeing no harm. Only Madam Hu, bearing a grudge, took Yueying’s every act as contemptuous. She thought: ‘This child is still young, and here only an attendant student; yet she is already so proud as to brook no contradiction. When grown and married here, becoming our mistress, she will surely rule us harshly. I can barely endure now; how shall my two children live?’

Harbouring such thoughts, Madam Hu grew to view Yueying as a thorn in her eye. Caihe’s constant defence of Yueying further inflamed her hatred and fear, leaving her at a loss. She had a brother, Hu Qian, a scheming, troublesome knave, with a desolate home. Depending on his sister, he had a small gambling fund, frequenting gambling houses daily to eke out a living. Though professing loyalty and devotion, he sought only advantage and avoidance of disaster. Since he lived by his sister’s support, how could he fail to help her? Moreover, as he often came and went at the Lan residence, and Lan Wen and his wife despised him, he felt the future of his sister and nephew was perilous. Relying on them for support, he had no other way to live. Thus Madam Hu enlisted him as a partner in their troubles. He loyally offered schemes, their best hope being to cause the young couple, master and mistress, both to perish, so that Madam Hu might seize power in the household. Though Madam Hu was the lawful wife, to lose her son was like an official losing his seal; she need not fear a successor taking charge. Hu Qian would then be the acting uncle, and by his aid and counsel, would command a third of the Lan estate. The siblings thus conspired, but lacked opportunity. Unknown to them, Heaven favours the wicked; the Lan family was destined for disaster. In little time, they would find their chance to resolve matters fundamentally.

What that chance might be, let us leave to the next chapter’s unfolding.
