# Chapter 57: The House is Stricken, the Parents Return to the Land of Bliss; Bewildered by Fame and Gain, the Husband Clings to the Red Dust

Now it happened that the siblings of the Hu family were secretly plotting how to deal with the affairs of Cai and He, the husband and wife. It so befell that in that summer a grievous pestilence prevailed. The lady of the house was the first to be infected; within less than half a year, she passed away, and was no longer able to tend to her beloved children, the heart and soul of her son and daughter-in-law. At this time Lan Wen had reached his sixth year. He was a man of loyal and honest character, and naturally had no wish to take a new wife to continue the line, so as not to mar the happiness of the girl. Yet the household affairs, both within and without, could not be managed without a helper. Thus the great authority of the family silently passed into the hands of Madam Hu. Madam Hu could never have dreamed of such a future blessing.

While she was rejoicing in her success, the newly appointed great uncle by marriage, Hu Qian, contrived another good plan. He said: “Sister, although you have gained some authority at present, it is but for a time. Moreover, it is not a legitimate office, but only like an old clerk in a shop. When the manager is absent and there is no one to act for him, temporarily one of the old clerks familiar with the circumstances is put in his place. If all goes well, no one will speak against it. But if a little mishap befalls, think what criticisms will be heard from outside. When criticism is adverse, the master of the shop can at any moment revoke your acting authority, and immediately employ another manager. At such a time, will this clerk have face enough to manage affairs in the shop? Even if he be greedy for his position, his fellow clerks and their wives will both dislike him: first, they will bear ill will against the authority he wielded as agent; second, they will laugh at his brief glory and say he has fallen back among them. How can such a life be endured? To speak plainly, sister, your position as the little lady of the house is really but a little higher than that of the male and female servants. Now that you stand on the stage, who is not afraid of you? Who does not respect you? They all show you three points more deference, and seek to please you. But if you make a misstep and the master perceives a wrong course, he will say, ‘A man in a low position is only fit to be low, and cannot mount the stage.’ And if any of your relatives or friends casually warn him, or even if a flatterer act as go-between, then, humph, sister, you must consider whether you have any means to prevent him from taking a new wife. If you cannot prevent his remarriage, then may I ask you, as one who has been acting lady, what face will you have to deal with such relatives, especially the servants? And that is not all. Your two little enemies, now placed under your hand, are already full of resentment. They only regret that they have no power to drag back their dead old mother to the living. When there is a new mother, they will seek to win her favour, and they will vent their long-repressed grievances. They will surely contrive all manner of ways to deal with you, the fallen and helpless little lady. Sister, I think it is really more perilous and fearful than when you were only a little lady!”

Madam Hu was originally a woman of great ambition; hearing these words of warning, she felt a greater dread. She suddenly exclaimed: “It is so! I understand now. I must make the old man take a firm resolution and decide at once to raise me to the status of principal wife. Then, with power and influence, and a rightful status, not only will outsiders not dare to breathe a word, but even the two little brats in the house will not dare disobey my commands.” Hu Qian laughed and said: “A good-hearted person indeed! You are content merely to be a great lady, having the power to command a pair of little things? Have you considered how clever and cunning these two children are, and how much they are favoured by the old man? In ordinary times, when you are strong, you are but a servant under their hands; now, suddenly, you must be their stepmother. Will they willingly listen to you and obey your commands? They will not be content, and you will not yield your authority as stepmother; from then on, mother and children will be estranged and never reconciled. The old man is closer to them than to you. Reflecting on this, you will see that being a stepmother alone cannot ensure peace. You must...”

At the word “must,” he glanced about to see that no one else was present; then he bit his lip slightly, smiled, and said: “I will say no more. Such matters of offence and guilt, I do not wish to urge you to act upon. You are wise enough and well fed; when you have leisure, close your eyes and quietly consider whether you can become the head of the family forever, free from future troubles, and how you might ensure that those two little ones will not dare to resist you in any way before you have established your position; and even if they resist, they will have no means of complaint. To reach this point, this great family property will truly be yours. As to such methods, to speak of them is worth nothing. But you know our proverb here: ‘No poison, no true man; to hate the small, not a gentleman.’ Your future, whether fortunate or ill, depends upon this one move, the most critical moment. Certainly you understand all this yourself, and need no more words from me.”

Madam Hu hesitated greatly on hearing this, but kept repeating the proverb of Hu Qian over and over, seventeen or eighteen times. Suddenly she stood still, clenched her teeth, and, pointing at her own two children, spoke fiercely: “I know. I also know that unless I take the most ruthless step, I shall never prevail over these two little brats. But I do this also for the descendants of the Lan family, and so it is right to be cruel. After all, who bade them beget such foolishly beloved and unfair children?” Hu Qian laughed and said: “You understand now, that is well. The old man has been ill lately, taking medicine every day. This is your good chance. You must be careful and quickly seek his support to raise you to principal wife and settle your status. He is old and feeble and must be set in a high place before relatives and friends, to receive the grand ceremony of kowtowing from those two little ones and from Yueying. Do not slight these vulgar rites; they have certain subtle import. Once these kowtows are performed, their hearts will ever dread you three points whenever they see you; this is quite reasonable. When you are raised to principal wife, you will need no more...”

At this the latter part of his sentence he drew back into his mouth and smiled faintly, saying: “The rest is a good play for you to perform yourself. Truly, as you said, for the sake of the Lan descendants, you must take a ruthless heart. Without doing so, you will only gain the reputation of a virtuous woman, and in the sight of the ancestors, still be branded with the guilt of damaging children. Merit and fault, good and bad, will all come to nothing in the end.” Madam Hu, hearing these words, as one burning with fever taking a cooling medicine, was suddenly delighted and continually praised the wise plan. The siblings then closed the door and quietly discussed many schemes. Hu Qian hastened away. Soon after, he returned and took from his sleeve a small packet of something, which he secretly handed to Madam Hu. She hurriedly took it and hid it in the wardrobe.

From that day forth, Madam Hu treated the couple Cai and He with special civility. She tended Lan Wen, who was ill, with particular care. By some means or other, within three days Lan Wen was seen to leave his sickbed and summon many relatives and friends, and even publicly announced the elevation of Madam Hu to the status of second wife, commanding a group of children and Yueying to kowtow and pay respects to her.

Madam Hu, confident in her plans, immediately assumed the airs of a principal wife, sitting upright and solemnly receiving their great ceremony before once more attending to the assembly of relatives and friends. Some among them, who understood the matter, thought it came too suddenly and unnaturally, and were deeply troubled on behalf of Cai and He. Yet Cai and Yueying remained innocent and simple-hearted; having never shown the slightest disrespect to Madam Hu before, they now, with her as their lawful stepmother, sincerely fulfilled their duties of filial piety. This was unquestioned.

But alas, their stars of disaster shone brightly. Suddenly Yueying’s home was set ablaze by enemies, and in one night it was utterly consumed. Yueying’s mother perished in the flames. Her father, Wang Guang, seeing his family destroyed, vomited blood and died. The couple passed away on the same day, only hours apart. Yueying learned the news in the morning and hastened home at noon, just in time to attend her father’s funeral.

Before his death, Wang Guang bade her: “I have lived a good life, but knew not that such a cruel reward awaited me. Yet a man’s hundred years come at last to death. Fortunately, I have no son, only you, my daughter, who already has a husband. Though your mother-in-law is dead, your father-in-law still lives. Your husband is a young and promising man, and I hear he treats you well. I may rest in peace, with no lingering attachment. As for my family’s affairs, though poor, the funeral need be simple, and the expenses not great. Only one thing to tell you: your father-in-law has just raised the little wife to principal wife; this person is a...” But here he could speak no more, and took this half sentence with him to the underworld. Yueying’s grief and distress at this time were beyond words. A young girl, newly stricken with great loss, was inexperienced in rites and customs. She had to send for her husband to come and help. Herself she wept like one mad, utterly helpless.

Fortunately, Cai He fully understood Yueying’s ignorance of such matters. Besides seeking her father’s help and bringing some money to purchase clothing and coffin, he also invited several elder uncles from the clan to come and manage all affairs. Cai He had to arrange the funeral for the Wang family and counsel Yueying to restrain her grief; he was at his wit’s end, enduring his most bitter and busy days ever. At last the funeral was completed, and Yueying, needless to say, had only to return with Cai He; there was no other way. To Yueying, this matter seemed of little importance, for she had always believed deeply in the Great Way; now, having suddenly suffered such calamities and great losses, she felt the fleetingness of the world’s time more than ever without any attachment. Originally disheartened by the world’s affairs, she now regarded the world as dead ash, utterly without any lingering sentiment. It was strange that Cai He, of a similar origin and ordinary intelligence, was still confused and unawakened, seeing no chance of entering the Way.

When she returned to the Lan household, Lan Wen’s condition had improved. He summoned her into his chamber, inquired about the deaths of her parents, and repeatedly comforted her. Yueying thanked him, then went to pay respects to Madam Hu. That day Madam Hu treated her with unusual warmth: calling her “heart and soul,” “flesh and blood,” touching her slender waist with many words of pity. Although Yueying was innocent, she could not but feel a little overwhelmed by this new favour, and was at a loss how to respond; she could not remain seated, spoke a few words, and hastily took leave.

By chance Cai He, fearing Yueying’s sorrow, sought her everywhere and invited her to fish in the garden to lighten her spirits. Yueying was in no mood for amusement but could not refuse his kindness, so she agreed, and they walked together to the large garden behind the house. The garden covered more than twenty acres, with artificial hills and ponds, stocked with many swimming fish. After entering the garden, Cai He smiled and said: “Sister, today you saw your stepmother; did she say anything to you?” Yueying shook her head: “No, I did not hear anything. Only I felt that my stepmother treated me better than usual, perhaps because she saw I was pitiful without parents or a home, and so cared for me the more.”

Cai He mused: “Sister, you and I are sincere people; how can we know the deceitfulness of human hearts? The stepmother is now the senior, and we, as daughters-in-law, how can we suspect her of ill will? But there is one person who chills my heart most, and that is the great uncle. That day I heard him speak to the stepmother; if she would forever remove future trouble, she must take a ruthless and bitter heart. First, the old man, she must not let him do this or that. The rest I could not hear clearly, nor dare to guess. Surely it is nothing good. Sister, think: if they have such hearts, how can two children like us resist them? And our father is now under the stepmother’s spell, his old life in their hands. How can we sit idly by and see him in such danger, without planning beforehand to guard against it? If we told the old man first, he would never believe us. If the stepmother knew, danger would fall on us at once, with no way to escape. Sister, consider what is to be done.”

Yueying, still burdened by her father’s last half-spoken words, which seemed to mean the same as what Cai He heard, though unfinished, was troubled beyond measure. She could not ask Lan Wen or his father, and was tormented. Luckily, seeing through worldly affairs, she decided to leave it for a few days. Now hearing Cai He speak thus, her whole heart was laid bare, and she said: “Brother, this cannot be spoken lightly. Even if great uncle said this, we do not know whether the stepmother will follow his plans. Even if they do, we must always be extra cautious and must not reveal their secret. That would be of no help and would only hasten their action. This must never be done.”

Cai He agreed. Then he revealed various suspicious points of collusion between Hu Qian and the stepmother to Yueying, and said: “While our mother lived, our days were truly happy, without fear of harm. No one dared to bully us. But since mother died, many troubles have arisen. If this continues, our days will be very hard indeed.” Yueying then had a sudden thought and asked: “Brother, do you still wish to be an official?” Cai He was surprised: “How can a man be without ambition? We study the sages’ books for what? To stand in the court and do some service for the royal house. Why should I not wish to be an official?”

Yueying answered sadly: “Brother, truly it is to seek a small gain for a moment and lose a great blessing for ten thousand years! Since our family troubles, my heart is like dead wood and ashes. Not only is worldly glory powerless to move my heart, but even the stepmother’s hatred and great uncle’s mischief do not touch me. After all, all must part, so why care for small gains and losses? To put it plainly, I have long sought to escape the world. Before, I had several difficulties. First, the natural order of kinship: I am my parents’ only child, and they depend on me; I could not bear to leave them and go my own way. Second, from the history of affection, I have one brother, bound by fate through three lifetimes, deeply connected; we should share hardship and not part ways. Thus I delayed and did not dare lightly to renounce the world. Now that my parents are dead, though grief is great, I feel that leaving the world should be sooner and cultivation faster. If I delay, time may not favor me. I could have stayed away from the household, but I must come because the future depends on you alone. Though you are lost, I am sure you will one day awaken and emerge from suffering. Today, having been summoned here, though I love mountains and waters, in this great sorrow I have no heart for them. I only wish to use this quiet place to have a deep talk with you again; I earnestly hope you will understand my simple purpose. Reflecting on past events, do not let the immortal teachers or the rulers of the underworld laugh at your fickleness and easy attachment. Even you yourself will not fall again into suffering and great calamity. I hope you will think carefully again.”

Cai He listened to her steadfast and earnest words, and could not help shedding some tears. He said sadly: “Sister, by your words, you will surely cultivate the Way. Whether you will succeed, your foolish brother dares not say. But, but...” He uttered three or four “buts,” his face flushed red, and he could say no more.

Seeing this, Yueying understood well and inwardly greatly resented: “So you are not only greedy for fame and gain, but also have such lustful desires. Is this not yet another obstacle?” Seeing he could not speak, she frankly spoke for him: “What is there to be ashamed of? Is it not said that man and woman together are the great order of humanity? This may be spoken of among ordinary men but not beyond, to immortals or spirits. Brother, you have not drunk the potion of madness, and probably still remember the matters of former lives. The end of marriage is just so. In former lives, we had the mercy of immortal teachers to guide us and bring us salvation. As for this life, if we do not strive to improve ourselves, a single misstep will cast us into the nine abyss, and there will be no immortal to rescue us again. Brother, although bold and desirous, I dare not accompany you. In sum, as long as I live I will seek to awaken you. Should the last day come with no chance of your awakening, I must look to my own future. When cultivation is complete, I shall meet you again; but I fear then I will be free and joyous beyond the world, enjoying the quiet and long life, while you will have become a hunchbacked old man, with all ties severed, or else have some accident that I cannot bear to speak of. Then I will not abandon you, but will not ascend alone; I must hold you by the hand to accompany me. Yet your obstacles are deep, and your cultivation difficult. Even if accomplished, you may not reach the highest place. Is this not to have wasted many decades of my human life, suffering much needless worldly experience? Should it not be stopped?”

Cai He said nothing, expressionless. Yueying guessed his mind was not yet changed, and he had not tasted the world’s ways, so awakening was hard. She smiled and said: “Brother, since you will not heed me, I have one request: in marriage, I shall only keep the name; if you force me to perform the rites of husband and wife, I will leave at once. Unless we succeed in the Way of the Highest, when you fall deep into calamity, I will never see you again.” Cai He remained silent, naturally displeased.

While the young couple were secretly meeting, the household servants hurried in, shouting: “Young masters, come quickly! The master’s illness is very grave. He is about to...” At the word “about to,” Cai He’s soul seemed to leave his body. Yueying held him and whispered a word in his ear. He nodded and rushed in. Yueying followed.

Why Lan Wen was suddenly gravely ill is to be revealed in the next chapter.
