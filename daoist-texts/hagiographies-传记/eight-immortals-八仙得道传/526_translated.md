# Chapter 58: The Cruel-hearted Wife Deals a Fierce Blow; The Righteous Servant Upholds Justice

It is told that ever since Wang Guang and his wife both passed beyond, Hu Qian hastened in great haste to the Lan family, to consult with his elder sister concerning plans of advancement. When he arrived, he found Madam Hu with her brows tightly knit, as if burdened with some great weight upon her mind. On seeing Hu Qian, she struck her hand once and said, "You have come at a fitting time. Do you know that that vile woman has suffered a great misfortune?" Hu Qian replied, "How could I not know? Seeing you so troubled, it is plain enough. Was it not enough that you endured that wretched creature’s coldness? Now you would bear her grievance on her behalf, because you see she has met her retribution?"

Madam Hu spat and laughed, saying, "Do you take me for such a fool? I would wish that wretched woman had perished in the flames, so that my heart might be at ease. How then could I bear her grievance?" Hu Qian laughed and said, "Then why this melancholy? Is it not as they say, to rejoice and yet to grieve?"

Madam Hu spat again and said, "If there be no grief, what joy remains? You must know that of late the old man’s expenses have been great, and the outgoings do not balance the incomings. Now the Wang family is broken and bereft, and since that vile woman was his beloved daughter-in-law, the dowry she brought, together with the current expenses of the funeral, will all be borne by my household. This is not all. It was said that the wretched woman, being now grown in years, would after this year or the next return whence she came. But now, homeless and bereft, would the old man drive her out? Having in the house a little enemy, I am already worn to the bone. If that vile woman should take up permanent residence here, would she not become a thorn in my eye? Though once she was but a child and knew little, and though she was rebellious, there was nothing great about it. Now she grows year by year, her heart grows larger, and with a large heart come many matters. The two of them, secret and subtle, united hand in hand, do they not make my position all the more difficult?"

Hearing this, Hu Qian could not help but emit a snort from his nose and said, "I truly do not understand you, elder sister, this great queen among women. Do you truly aspire to become a Buddha or an immortal, a holy woman? Or is it all but eighteen painted masks, a display of false learning to deceive your own brother? To speak plainly, if you had truly such a kind heart, the heavens would not suffer you to remain a mortal; you would long ago have been summoned by the Golden Boy and Jade Maiden to take your place as a great celestial immortal. But if you lack such conscience, yet persist in speaking such mawkish words of benevolence and righteousness, you either deceive me, Hu Laoqian, or else deceive yourself. If not, then you are but a man in the midst of confusion, blinded for the moment." Madam Hu, taken aback by this sharpness, flushed and sneered coldly, "You are a good man indeed, yet you do not think to devise a perfect plan for others, but come first to mock me; what is that worth?" Hu Qian sighed, "So it seems, sister, that your mind is truly blurred by lust for wealth. Such plain truths, such easy opportunities, you cannot see, and yet I thought you a clever woman." As he spoke he stepped forward and whispered a few words in her ear.

At first Madam Hu dared not assent. But when Hu Qian struck his breast and took full responsibility, she reluctantly nodded, and with trembling voice said, "Men, after all, are braver. Though my heart be so cruel, I doubt I could wield such a fierce hand. Did you not tell me once, then, that I should steel my courage, that the next harsh blow would be a stroke of fortune for life? Yet when the time came, both my hands trembled first. It seems I am a useless vessel. Since you fully agree to undertake it, then I lay this great matter upon your shoulders. When it is done, the rewards will be yours, of course. You know that as your elder sister, I am no ungrateful villain. I shall not treat you wrongly, and that will be all. Yet one matter is most important: it must be agreed beforehand, that if in time the matter is revealed and great trouble arises, I will not bear the blame, but must cast it upon you. You who do such evil deeds will but die for it. Beyond striving to help you manage affairs, I shall not accompany you to court or prison. If you regard the memory of our ancestors and the bond between siblings, do not bring me into it. Can you promise this?"

Hearing this, Hu Qian found it exceedingly comical, thinking how she spoke of power with such grandiloquence, raising herself so high. But as to responsibility, she took it lightly, and spoke of ancestors’ faces and sibling ties. Truly she was a woman without regard for others. But no matter, for now it was not the time to discuss these things. When the first step was done and the money gained, the world was wide; whither could one not go? Why await death here, bearing risk and blame with her? Since she was so clever, he was not a fool. In all, he consented.

Laughing heartily he said, "Sister, you are a careful thinker. Such small matters merit so many warnings and consideration. Yet you are a woman, and it is not strange that your courage is less. Since I have made these plans for you, I must take full charge; be at ease, be at ease. You shall sacrifice but one old man; for all else – catching the villain, prison, torture, death – all shall be borne by me, your brother. You remain at home, enjoying your blessings like heaven, without a single hurt. Is that not well?"

Madam Hu was greatly pleased and gave thanks. The siblings arranged their plans well. It was intended to act that very night, but Hu Qian went out to procure a certain medicine much needed, and was delayed several days. Not until Yueying had returned with Caihe did Hu Qian bring the medicine from the outer district and hand it to Madam Hu. She lamented his delay, for that pair of little beasts had already returned; did it not add two more pairs of eyes? Hu Qian said, "What is there to fear? Those two little things, together not even twenty-five years old, what knowledge have they? Must we fear such things and be unable to undertake great deeds?" Madam Hu said no more.

At this time Lan Wen’s old illness was somewhat better, though he still took medicine daily. The doctor advised rest after taking it. Soon Madam Hu prepared the medicine for him. Hu Qian entered with the drugs, mixing them into the bowl. Trembling, Madam Hu took it into the room and tended Lan Wen as he swallowed it.

Those wise and discerning knew well what Hu Qian had brought. What was the effect of the medicine delivered into Lan Wen’s belly? Could one fail to guess? Indeed, in but a few hours, the Lan household was in uproar, proclaiming that the master had died. With Lan Wen dead, Madam Hu became mistress of the entire family. Hu Qian became a founder of the new order, holding great power and full of arrogance. Hu Qian privately instructed his sister to take this opportunity to give Caihe and Yueying a stern warning. First, to frighten them so they would not harbour suspicion; second, to cause them to be forever subdued under authority, never daring to show resistance. Madam Hu obeyed in all things, making the pair of young couple wretched, neither able to laugh nor cry, ill at ease in any place, truly driven to desperation, life and death both difficult. They knew well their father had died in mysterious circumstances.

But Hu Qian was careful and meticulous in his deeds; not only were his hands and feet clean at the moment of action, but even in disposing of the corpse no trace was left. Not to mention Yueying and Caihe, who were but children and knew little of these matters, even many servants of the Lan household, though suspecting foul play in their master’s death, were careful to examine every feature and limb of the body. In whispered talk they all admired this pair of siblings as cunning murderers, for so swiftly and thoroughly to leave no trace was no common skill. Hu Qian was indeed a most crafty fellow. Presumably hearing some rumors, he specially conferred with Madam Hu and drew forth a large sum of silver, giving it to a band of servants. Ostensibly it was a reward for their hard work in the funeral, but in truth it was to buy their silence.

Though all felt indignation for their master, none had the courage to seek justice, nor perhaps the heart of chivalry. Having received Madam Hu’s rich reward, though reluctant to take bribes to cover misdeeds, they had no choice but to accept cautiously. They agreed to say no more, to avoid bringing ruin upon themselves.

Thus the siblings ventured ever further, emboldened. According to Hu Qian’s plan: "If you do not act decisively, the grass once cut will sprout again. The matter having come to this, having borne the guilt of one knife, it is better to make the most of the opportunity and slay both the little pests together, and all will be settled." But Madam Hu was resolute in refusal, having her own grave counsel.

She said, "Though the head of a household be dead, few will give heed. But if the old man and the two children, the main actors, die as well, not only will the servants find no excuse, but neighbours and kin will be utterly disbelieving that all have died natural deaths. Should some busybody speak ill of it, word will spread and reach the magistrate’s ears, and then chaos will arise. Better to leave them for the present. I am now their rightful mother-in-law and mistress of the house; what resistance could they offer? I have my methods to make each suffer beyond endurance, so that without killing them, they will themselves hasten to the halls of Yama. Is that not most excellent?"

Hu Qian, hearing this, found it reasonable and left the management to her. When the funeral was complete, Madam Hu’s first plan was to announce the household’s financial difficulty. Even when the master was alive, income barely covered outgoings. Now with this funeral, two others held for the Wang relatives, and many unforeseen expenses for Miss Wang, half the family’s fortune had disappeared within a month. To augment income and reduce expenditure, she first dismissed Teacher Mao, who was aged and ill and no longer able to teach, saving much expense. Second, Caihe was appointed to tend the cattle and sheep and gather firewood. Third, Yueying was assigned to weave, wash clothes, and prepare meals. All other servants were sent to farm. Madam Hu took the role of overseer, with Hu Qian as accountant. Their two children were still young; when grown, one would assist the brother in affairs, the other help the sister-in-law with labour, equally sharing without favour.

Though Caihe’s heart was full of bitterness and sorrow, he had no choice but obey her orders. Yueying, however, felt no humiliation and smiled, saying to Caihe, "From now on we cannot even read; what use is there in thinking of official rank?" Caihe replied, "Dear sister, do you mock me? We are in the same boat. Having suffered, could you stand aloof?" Yueying hastened to say, "I mean no such thing. I had no plan to remain long in the mortal world, good days or bad; I told you long ago. This is only a passing hardship for your sake. Sooner or later we must go. Why quarrel over a few hard days? It is better than you devoting yourself to fame and rank, only to suffer setbacks; surely that is a hard trial ahead."

Caihe was silent. Meanwhile Madam Hu gave Caihe the tools for herding—sickles, yokes, whips—and sent Yueying to work elsewhere, separating the two so that not a day passed without them apart. Yueying, not come for love, was untroubled, but Caihe was utterly unable to bear it. Though he toiled hard to the utmost of his strength, for this matter he could not help but voice some complaints. The household had all accepted Madam Hu’s kindness and sided with her. Caihe, though silent, schemed excuses to ingratiate himself with Hu Qian. Hearing these complaints, Hu Qian sneered and said to Madam Hu, "Hear that? You preach morality and righteousness, but see how they secretly plot against us. If you do not act, the future may bring worse troubles."

Madam Hu, hearing this, reconsidered and felt she had been too lenient with these former daughter-in-law and wife. In anger she said, "I am their mother-in-law; if they despise me, they despise not only me but the dead master; they are no true daughters-in-law of the Lan family. Uncle Tài, please devise a plan to drive these pests from my doors at once. If they refuse to go, bind them with a rope and at once send them to the magistrate to charge them with great crimes of disobedience and unfiliality."

Hu Qian clapped his hands and said, "Good, good! You have been too soft; you must have someone to keep watch over you and urge you, lest you suffer losses. Since you entrust me fully, I will bear the blood debt and ensure the matter is done neat and complete, to justify your trust." Saying this, he left in high spirits.

At that moment, an aged butler, Lan Xiu’s son named Lan Zhen, overheard the talk. It was near dusk. Lan Zhen, having returned home because his mother was ill and slept daily, now, hearing these words, told his father. Lan Xiu was filled with anger, pointing toward the Lan family home, he shouted, "What a pair of lawless, heartless wretches! The master has just died under mysterious circumstances, and all say it was the work of you siblings. Only because your hands are clever and leave no trace, though all know the master died unjustly, none can do aught against you. But know this: the law of men may be deceived, but the way of Heaven cannot. And now, while the master’s bones are yet warm, you seek to lay hands upon his daughter-in-law. I cannot understand what mortal hatred you bear the Lan family to wish to destroy the whole house! Hah, if I were Lan Xiu, I would not let you act freely."

The old man grew more furious and louder, so much so that his wife Wang rushed out in alarm and covered his mouth. Wang, though ill, was so frightened that the illness seemed to flee three leagues away, and she reproached him, "Old man, you have drunk your bitter potion and now meddle in others’ affairs. Think well: your son now works in that house; the new mistress is harsh; after all, she is your son’s lady, and his fate lies in her hands. Why should you, without cause, offend her over another’s matters? Tomorrow if your son loses his work, your strength fails with age; where will you find silver to support us then?" So saying, she and Lan Zhen together forced him inside, laid him on his bed, drew the curtains, and he lay there grumbling his complaints.

Whether the lives of Caihe and his wife might be preserved, or what further acts Lan Xiu would undertake, we shall see in the next chapter.
