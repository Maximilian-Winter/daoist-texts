# Chapter Sixty: The Thunder and Lightning Display Power to Punish the Evil Slave, The Immortals Employ Their Arts to Save the Worthy Disciples

Now it was told that Hu Qian led a band of evil slaves, driving the two young masters to leap into the water. They saw them cast themselves into the river for a long time, yet heard not the usual plash-plash of two sounds; nor did they behold in the midst of the river a splash of water as large as a palm. Behold the riverbank, steep and sheer as a wall, and without reeds or the like to conceal a body. Where then had these two children gone to? Curiosity being strong upon them, the multitude hastened in unison to the river's edge, and many eyes turned all at once downstream.

Suddenly, a burst of golden light rose from the riverbed and struck the eyes of the crowd, as if pricked by needles; each one was pained exceedingly, hastening to close their eyes and crying out in their agony. Only Lan Xiu and the young servant felt especially clear and bright, plainly beholding within the golden light a red lotus slowly ascending. Upon the red lotus stood two men and two women; besides Cai and his wife, the other pair were clad as from beyond the world, bearing the semblance of immortals.

Lan Xiu and the young servant, taking advantage of the crowd's closed eyes, quickly loosed the ropes and knelt, bowing their heads without ceasing: "Immortal Lords, save our masters and bear them to Heaven." This one cry startled the band of cruel masters and slaves, making them raise their heads and look upward. Verily, they beheld the golden light in waves, supporting the red lotus. Upon the red lotus stood four immortals. And their two young masters were as if within it; the band of evil slaves, terrified, also fell to their knees and bowed. Only Hu Qian, though fearful in his heart, spoke stubbornly, saying that these were demons who had possessed the children, likely to take them into some cave to be eaten as delicacies.

Before he had finished speaking, there came a loud cry from the air: "Lan Xiu, listen well. Thy master was originally of immortal stock, yet by a single error was banished to the mortal world. Thy male master was too heavy in desire, involving the female master; both suffer this calamity. Now they shall be taken to a famous mountain to cultivate the Way. Thou and thy cousin, loyal and sincere, are highly commendable. I command the local earth deity to escort thee home, bestowing a single immortal pill to prolong life to a hundred years, together with a hundred taels of gold, which shall soon be granted and shared with thy cousin. Hu Qian, cruel and malicious, is beyond pardon. Behold, I dispatch the thunder and lightning generals to execute immediate punishment."

At this, Hu Qian was greatly terrified, prostrate and trembling, loudly begging the exalted immortals for mercy, promising never again to do evil. Yet his crimes being full, instantly a thunderclap arose in midair. All beheld within the golden light two fierce-faced generals, a man and a woman, who saluted the two immortals. At that moment, black clouds arose, the moonlight was obscured, and the flashing golden light shone as bright as midday. Suddenly the clouds dipped low, and all heard the two generals say: "We report to the Master of Rites that by decree we are to smite Hu Qian with thunder. But now is the late winter and early spring; the energies of heaven and earth are not yet in accord. If thunder is to be sent, we must first report clearly to the Supreme Emperor, that the punishment be specially authorized, then we may proceed with the arts." The immortal then commanded: "Prepare forthwith to execute the arts. I shall personally ascend and report immediately; no errors may be suffered." The generals bowed, saying, "With the Master of Rites to report, we shall certainly comply."

When these words were spoken, they bowed once more and withdrew. In a moment, even the golden light vanished, but the thunder roared and the valleys shook, though no lightning was seen. Hu Qian and the others wished to flee, but their feet were heavy as if nailed to the ground, unable to move. Though a villainous man, at this moment Hu Qian felt all evil thoughts vanish, his soul dissipate. At first he cried out and begged for mercy, but the thunder was so mighty that it drowned his pleas ten thousand fold. Pitiable was his dying entreaty, yet it could not reach the ears of Heaven. The thunderclaps seemed to whirl above his head, hesitating to descend, making all most uncomfortable. Meanwhile, the band of evil slaves suffered the same torment and fear. Only Lan Xiu and the others appeared wholly untroubled, standing afar to watch how they endured the thunder and lightning punishment.

After some time thus, suddenly golden light arose again in the air. Within the golden light the immortals loudly called: "Thunder Lord and Thunder Lady, hear this! The jade command has arrived; proceed swiftly with the punishment." Each word pierced Hu Qian’s ears. He felt a tremendous boom at the crown of his head; three souls fled, two gone already, one remaining. Then thunder sounded anew, but unlike before, lightning flashed forth where the thunder began. A loud crack like a great clap broke the open sky, filling the air with the smell of sulfur. Hu Qian, evil and utterly lost in conscience, cried out once, then was struck to charcoal, like a scorched and blackened log, certainly no longer alive. Several of his slaves escaped the thunder's execution but were greatly frightened; upon returning home some fell ill of fright, others were blinded by the golden light, never to recover.

Lan Xiu and the young servant hid aside until Hu Qian was struck dead. Then they knelt again and bowed. Suddenly a voice spoke in their ears: "The immortals have gone; no need for further ceremony. Come with me back home, and enjoy your clear blessings." They heard the voice but saw no figure. Knowing it was the earth deity sent by the immortals, they gave repeated thanks and followed home. Upon arriving, morning was breaking. Lan Xiu heard again: "Old friend, farewell, farewell. An immortal pill is placed in thy ear; take it out and swallow it." Lan Xiu quickly bowed to the air in thanks, feeling as if something was lodged in his ear. With his small finger he dug, and indeed drew out a crystal, round and lustrous immortal pill. He swallowed it at once. Later, Lan Xiu and his cousin, tending a vegetable garden, dug up a jar of gold, and knew the immortals truly did not deceive. They divided it equally and enjoyed their blessings. Lan Xiu lived to a full hundred years before returning to Heaven. These are later tales, not to be told fully here.

Now to speak only of Cai and Yueying, who since being saved from peril by the two immortals had witnessed Hu Qian’s execution by thunder and lightning. Though comforted, their hearts were also moved with pity. At that time they dared not speak, but followed the two immortals as they soared on clouds like swift winds. After some time, just as they were about to cook their meal, the immortals said: "We have arrived; now descend." The clouds dipped swiftly, and in the blink of an eye they stood before a stone house upon a high mountain. The two immortals stood firm and smiled faintly at Cai and Yueying. Yueying then recognized the man as her former master, Master Iron Crutch. The woman seemed familiar but her memory was unclear. Cai was equally vague.

At once Yueying called the master’s name and bowed to the ground. Cai likewise knelt, and the two bowed in unison. Master Iron Crutch bade them first pay respects to the female immortal: "This is thy senior uncle." They both bowed again. Master Iron Crutch led them into the stone chamber, where a young Taoist came forth to receive them, saying: "Master and senior uncle above, disciple Yang Ren bows." Iron Crutch waved for him to rise, and with Fairy He entered within. Yang Ren followed behind, calling Yueying and Cai inside. They saw the two immortals seated above, and all three bowed once more. Iron Crutch comforted Yang Ren with some words, praised Yueying, and then sighed to Cai: "Because of thee, this child, Yueying’s path to immortality was delayed years. She earnestly tried to persuade thee, but thou didst make excuses, bewitched and unawakened. With thy foolish nature, thou shouldst have been cast out long ago to suffer torments and calamities without return. None would plead for thee in the nine hells’ eighteen layers. Now, for thy wife’s sake, rescue is given thee once. Thou shalt forthwith go to Mount Wangwu, sit in quiet cultivation for three years, and see if thy resolve changes. Then may the great Way be taught thee. If thou findest thou cannot endure the solitude, hunger, cold, and beasts of the mountain, I shall not force thee to the Way; better to descend quickly and pursue thy worldly honours, enjoying thy grand halls and fair wives."

When Cai heard this, he could not hold back tears, saying: "I have now suddenly awakened. I see well my previous folly. Not only did I cause Yueying to lose her immortal fate, but I myself have sought suffering. Now my studies remain unfinished, my parents grieved, my stepmother cruel and violent. Had not the immortal master aided me, I would long since have been drowned in a fish’s belly. Moreover, I was not without foundation; now having seen the immortal examples in this world, I know my previous vain words were truly the worst folly. If I should still cling to worldly desires, lacking self-respect, I am worse than beasts, no better than grass and trees. Master, I beg thee to trust me; no matter what task thou dost assign, even to walk through fire and water or to pass between life and death, I will not refuse. Please send me on at once."

Master Iron Crutch laughed, saying: "Thy words are fair to hear, but canst thou accomplish them? Thou sayest thou wilt face fire and water without refusal. So thou thinkest to speak boldly. Know then, that seeking the Way and immortality is the hardest task in all the world. When the critical moment comes, do not say that passing through fire and water is unavoidable; there are even more fierce, dangerous things with death certain. None may be shunned; not only that, not a trace of fear must be harboured. I ask if thou canst truly endure?" Cai bowed, saying: "The greatest fear in man is unwillingness to die. I now treat myself as dead, and though dangers be ten thousandfold, it cannot be worse than death. I do not dare call myself a man of resolute will, but I must encourage myself at this time." Iron Crutch laughed and nodded: "Very good; no blame for the past. The future trial, success or failure, depends on this journey. I shall not send thee; there is no idle person here to send. All who cultivate the Way must suffer hardships; travel in mountains and waters, especially the happiness found in suffering. Thou shalt go slowly alone."

Yueying stood by, listening to their talk. Now seeing Iron Crutch send Cai alone to Mount Wangwu, though not knowing the distance, she knew the master’s intent: to torture his body and train his sinews. Moreover, the admonition that danger must not be avoided, and fear must not arise, showed that hardships would surely be encountered. Cai was a gentleman by birth, often crossing a river with many servants about him, never leaving his side. Now he was to travel this perilous and long road alone. Though the immortal master surely had reason and would not harm, just thinking of it made Yueying anxious.

At this moment, Iron Crutch suddenly turned and shouted loudly at Yueying. To others it was a simple voice without meaning, but to Yueying it was as if a sudden thunderclap burst over her head. Though just come from the thunder and lightning, she had not thought the sound so terrible; now this shout made her heart pound wildly. She could not keep her composure, almost shedding tears. All present knew not Iron Crutch’s intent, nor why Yueying was so frightened. Even Yueying herself knew not why she was thus dismayed. Iron Crutch then scolded: "Immortals often show heartlessness as greatest affection. Thou art foolish in heart and unyielding in spirit. Thou art the wisest and most steadfast of all; how canst thou bind thyself with such worldly love? Though thy affection differs from common husbands and wives, know that if love’s root be not removed, thou canst fall into demons. The deeper the demon’s path, the more the right path fades. The gentleman is cautious in the small and in solitude; this is the reason."

Hearing this, Yueying’s heart suddenly brightened, all thoughts disappeared. Not only towards all in the world, but even towards Cai’s heart, all was released. At this moment her mind was truly clear and bright; unlike before when she fancied herself dead and withered, now she was as a different person. Unconsciously joyous and uplifted, she reverently bowed again to Iron Crutch, and bit his Taoist sandal with her cherry lips, lingering long to show her respect. Iron Crutch laughed heartily, nodding repeatedly, and said to Yang Ren: "This child is teachable; truly a seed of immortals. Much better than Cai, her future is beyond measure." To Cai he said: "Thou and Yueying are of the same birth and root. Only because she kept true and pure, her path is near and immortality easy. Probably within thirty years she shall be somewhat accomplished. Thou sufferest for desire; though diligent, thou shalt lag ten years behind Yueying. But in any event, as those with former roots, ye have much advantage. Even if delayed some decades, it is easier for you than for others."

As he spoke, he pointed to Yang Ren. Yang Ren laughed: "Master, heed well thy instructions of this day; be single-hearted, fear not hardship, cold not danger, nor loneliness. After a few years’ practice, thou shalt equal us who have laboured decades. Decades hence, we shall seek instruction from thee." Cai thanked him for his teaching, and said: "Brother, be not too humble. We are all one family, and must regard each other as kin. By the Master’s order, I must take leave at once. Though by nature stubborn, I shall carefully follow Master’s commands and strive forward. If I falter, I hope Brother will remember our fellowship and supervise me; that would be a great blessing."

Iron Crutch bade Yang Ren bring a package of small silver, several robes, and all travelling necessities, delivering them to Cai, commanding him to descend the mountain at once. Cai’s heart was reluctant, seeming unwilling to go quickly. Iron Crutch scolded: "Confucius said: ‘To hear the Way in the morning, to die in the evening, is acceptable. To study and not attain is still to fear losing it.’ Since thou hast resolved to seek the Way, speak no of a day or two’s time to waste; not a moment may be neglected. The sooner thou goest, the sooner shalt thou attain the Way. Enough words; why linger here?"

Cai had no choice but to bid farewell one by one as the others returned his greeting. At Yueying’s side he said: "Sister, thy heart towards me is most true and complete. In past years, thou wast delayed by my hand; in future years, look to me as brother, even if I die in the mountains, I shall not again disappoint thee. Pray cherish thy Way-body; when I make some progress, I shall yet seek thy great teaching." Yueying was no longer so sorrowful, and answered with encouragement. She and Yang Ren personally escorted him down the mountain. When he had gone far, they returned to the cave.

Iron Crutch laughed to Fairy He: "Sister, what thinkest thou of Cai’s journey; will it bear fruit or not?" Fairy He smiled: "His heart is kind indeed. Alas, the worldly feelings are deep; I fear his Way-heart is unsteady, hindering the future. To me, he is far behind Yueying." Iron Crutch laughed: "Yueying is naturally better, but his cleverness is not less. Having passed this great trial, he views worldly feelings more lightly. Today’s firm words have made him very silent. This is the foundation of entering the Way. Going to Wangwu, adding three years of still cultivation, surely none will fail. Yet he must be thoroughly awakened and prevented from new distractions; this must be done, so his Way-heart be single and advance without limit, and success come swiftly. We have no business here; we might take Yueying down the mountain to follow Cai secretly, and see the sights; that would not be amiss." Fairy He joyfully agreed.

Iron Crutch then inquired into Yang Ren’s recent studies. Yang Ren reported that the morrow was the anniversary of his late mother’s death, and he must go to the grave to clean and offer sacrifices. Iron Crutch nodded: "That is proper. Thy mother has no immortal fate; save to deliver her as a ghost-immortal, I can do nothing further. Meet her, and entreat her to do many meritorious deeds. When thou hast attained fruition, she may be delivered as an earth immortal." Yang Ren bowed, saying: "I shall exhort my late mother to widely practice merits for her future blessings."

Iron Crutch nodded, then took leave of Yang Ren, riding the clouds back to Lan Caihe’s house. On the way he said to Yueying: "Knowest thou why I go to Lan’s family?" Yueying answered: "My father-in-law died under strange circumstances; the whole village knows, but the chief suspect is the woman who was elevated from concubine to wife. Cai and I know the truth but have no proof; who can speak falsehood? Now the Master goes himself to Lan’s family, doubtless to seek justice for the dead. I, as the youngest, dare not speak rashly. As for the hardships my husband and I suffered, all was through Hu Qian alone. Since he is punished, our resentment is ended; we seek no revenge from elders. We know the Master would not trouble himself for us."

Iron Crutch praised her fitting words, then laughed: "Thy father-in-law died at the hands of the Hu siblings. The act was joint, but the chief instigator was Hu Qian alone, whose sin is greatest. Though he is smitten by thunder, guilt cannot be hidden; now in the underworld he suffers torments of swords and mountains. As for thy aunt, a concubine newly made wife, she repaid not her loyalty but hearkened to the evil brother, plotting thy husband’s death and to harm thee both. Her heart is as bad as Hu Qian’s save for a little. Yet there is difficulty: thy father-in-law was a good man, leaving a son and daughter born of the Hu family, still young and needing their birth mother’s care. Were the Hu family to perish by punishment, these children would suffer grievously. Therefore, for the Hu family, severe punishment must be delayed; let her nurture the children well, and not harbour further malice. Though guilt cannot be offset, it may be somewhat lessened. We shall go and teach her this. Moreover, there is another matter to detain us a day or two, till these affairs are settled, then we may hasten back to Henan to track Cai and watch his progress." They were pleased to hear this.

As the master and disciples spoke with interest, suddenly from the northeast corner a streak of black cloud flew swiftly. Iron Crutch cried out in alarm: "Evil creature! Evil creature! Having suffered many setbacks yet unrepentant, daring again to harm others. Alas! Who knows how many innocent souls shall fall by his hand this time?"

What this matter is, and how it shall prove so mighty, shall be unfolded in the next chapter.
