# Chapter Sixty-Four: Wang Yueying’s Scheme to Explore the Mortar, and Dongfang Shuo’s Cunning Theft of the Peaches of Immortality

Now it happened that Caihe, upon awakening from a dream, found it already noon. In his ears he heard a woman’s voice; the door was pushed open, and his heart was greatly startled, so that he suddenly became fully awake, and hastily sat up. The woman came close beside the bed and drew aside the curtain. Caihe then recognised her to be the young lady who had spoken with him that very morning; recalling her words, he was the more discomposed, and paid her no heed. But the young lady, with great composure, asked: ‘Sir, you are awake; would you have some refreshments before you sleep again?’ Caihe was about to rise from the bed, but the woman pressed one hand upon him, and smiling awkwardly said: ‘Why should you so completely avoid me? We are but strangers who have met by chance. Since the ancestors have shown this dream, and Heaven has fixed a good destiny, why be so obstinate? Have you not heard that even immortals form families?’ Caihe hastened to wave his hand: ‘Pray do not mention this further, lest I feel unbearable shame. You are a celestial being, surely there are noble sons and talented heroes to be your lifelong mates. How could you entangle with a poor Daoist like me?’

The woman heard this, and her face flushed like a peach blossom, her countenance shyly modest; then she said: ‘Sir, do not misapprehend me and think me a lowly lewd woman. My father is a renowned minister in court, and my mother also comes of a distinguished family. Though I am humble, in my youth I have received instruction at home, and in all things of poetry, literature, and needlework I am well versed. How could I imitate base women, disregarding suspicion, and offer myself to a strange man? It is because the dreams of my late father were most clear, and can stand as the decree of my parents. And since you are about to depart today, a fine match once missed is hard to reunite. Therefore, disregarding suspicion, forgetting shame, I have come while the temple is empty to see you, earnestly hoping you will graciously consent to arrange this marriage, so that I may have a fixed place for life, and so may comfort my late parents beneath the earth. Might you, sir, pity my sorrow and grant this favour?’ While Caihe heard her speak, he attentively observed her countenance and gestures, and found nothing frivolous; yet the more he doubted. Bound by her persistent entreaties, and unable to rise from the bed, he closed his eyes tightly, sat with composed countenance, and made no reply to her demands.

The woman, feeling no delight, sighed and withdrew quietly. Still, he heard her bolt the door. Caihe knew that shouting would be unheeded, so he lay down again to sleep. Yet his heart was in confusion, and he could no longer dream. No matter how he tried to restrain himself, it was in vain. Unwittingly, he grew angry, gnashing his teeth with a strange noise. He loudly said: ‘Lan Caihe, Lan Caihe, before your master you boasted great words; now, having not yet attained the first step in cultivation, you are beset by such evil tribulations. If I secretly move my heart, not only will I fail to see my master, my wife, and fellow disciples, but I may fall into hell, never to rise again. Now, at this crucial moment, however it be, I must stake my life.’ After speaking for a while, he seemed to hear a woman’s laughter in the room, which made him greatly suspicious. Looking around, there was no one there. He thought he must have heard wrongly, and let it pass.

He then again exercised his vital energy, and sat up in meditation. After some time, he settled his mind. Suddenly he heard clamour outside. Listening closely, he was greatly amazed, for he heard a voice as if it were his wife Wang Yueying. He pricked up his ears and listened again; indeed it was Wang Yueying quarrelling with the woman who had sought to match herself. Caihe was much astonished, thinking: in this remote village, how could Yueying come hither? Could it be that my master, knowing my plight, has specially sent her to aid me? Thinking thus, he wished to break open the door and meet Yueying. Approaching the door, he found it not large, yet very solid; he shook it with his hand, but it did not move at all, and he was struck with stupor. Listening outside, they grew louder still, their voices clear and distinct. He heard Yueying scold the woman as a shameless wretch, how dare she seduce another’s husband? The woman would not yield, but contended with her in folly. After some time, Yueying grew angry and with many blows drove the woman away. Then he heard the Daoist nun plead with Yueying, who also drove her off. Caihe hoped Yueying would open the door, and that husband and wife might meet. But after long waiting, there was no sound outside. He grew anxious, exerted all his strength to push the door, and shouted Yueying’s name hoarsely. Yet after some clamour, there was no effect; Caihe was alarmed and distressed. In vexation, he sat upon the bed, no longer willing to struggle.

After a while, as evening approached, his stomach was somewhat uneasy. Looking back, he saw on the table by the bed a large cake and a pot of water. Without further thought, he took the cake hastily, ate some, and drank a few mouthfuls of water. Outside was still and silent. Caihe knew that shouting was useless, so resolved to sleep through the night. If no one came by morning, he would think of a way to break out through the window. Having eaten the cake, he sat meditating awhile. The sky grew dark, and upon lying down, he at once fell asleep. Awakening at dawn, he seemed to hear a voice saying: ‘Sir, take care. The master bids me test your resolve on the Way. Luckily you have firm determination, and I have words to report to the master. We need not meet, lest we disturb your heart. Go well; we shall meet again soon.’ Caihe clearly recognised the voice as that of his wife Yueying, yet he searched everywhere and found no one. Smiling unexpectedly, he said: ‘Surely my master has taught her some invisibility art, and she comes to tease me.’ He got up and found the door wide open; seeking elsewhere, he found no one. Caihe knew that the master could at any time inspect his heart and aspiration, and everywhere sent some protection. Henceforth his resolve was firmer, and he boldly advanced.

In not long a while, Caihe reached Wangwu Mountain. Along the way he passed many hardships and dangers, yet passed safely. Arriving at the mountain, he sought a shelter, and quietly practiced his cultivation. At first his provisions were not exhausted, but he worried that the mountain was high and the road far, and food hard to obtain. Yet each morning, in his stone cave there was set a portion of dry food and fruit, just enough for one day’s sustenance. After half a year, this gradually diminished, but was always enough to satisfy him.

Until two years later, when he wholly ceased fire and food, feeling his spirit better and his courage stronger. He was able to find some fruits to allay hunger. Even without eating, he felt no hunger or thirst. Henceforth, every three years, Master Tieguai sent several disciples to Wangwu to inspect his cultivation, and impart some Taoist arts.

At that time, Zhongli Quan of Mount Taihua had completed reading the three volumes of the Profound Scripture. Following the old ancestor’s command, he transmitted them to Caihe. Soon after, several hundred years passed, from the Western to the Eastern Han. On Wudang Mountain, Zhang Guo, at the request of the Perfected Wenmei, obtained from the Primordial Lord a book of the Great Jade Emptiness.

He Xiangu was summoned by the Mysterious Lady, and taught the essential Tao of the Primordial Gate, also entrusted with the Heavenly Escape Sword Art. These immortals had attained about eight or nine parts of the Way. At that time, the world was in the era of the Eastern Han Emperor Ming. Ming himself was a reincarnated disciple of Buddhism, and first revered the Buddhist teaching. Hence officials and people alike abandoned Confucian and Taoist teachings, all resorting to Buddhism. The Primordial Lord, to prevent disciples from contending with others about superiority, summoned all chief disciples, various emperors and star officials, all golden immortals with rank, and all unranked wandering immortals, gathering at the Eight Scenes Palace. He declared the principle of the three teachings having a common origin. Although worldly powers wax and wane in influence, this is decreed by destiny, and it is best to uphold the principle of benefiting others. Since others bear burdens, why strive for merit oneself? In these centuries, disciples who voluntarily came and went in the world could only secretly aid Buddhism, sharing merit together. Those who preferred stillness and disliked disturbance might cultivate on the mountains, without lightly engaging with the world. All disciples accepted this command, and admonished their own disciples to observe it jointly. So from the Eastern Han onward, the Confucians and Buddhists were often seen mutually attacking and opposing, like fire and water, with many entering and withdrawing from power. Only Taoists remained uninvolved, issuing a command through two great patriarchs.

Now let us speak of Dongfang Shuo. Also called Manqian, he was the reincarnation of the star Jupiter. As a child, he was taught by a fellow Taoist immortal descended to earth, imparting various arts. When grown, he acquired great skill, able to enter the unseen and the netherworld, foretelling events before they occurred. The Emperor Wu, fond of Taoism, hearing his fame, summoned and appointed him Grand Minister of the Court. Dongfang Shuo was by nature humorous; although in court, he did not strictly observe court etiquette. Sometimes meeting the emperor, he would speak freely, or laugh at will, often causing the solemn emperor to smile and be glad. The emperor, weary of court restraint, found such a jester companion delightful. Thus the emperor did not reprimand him, but found him straightforward and lovable, bestowing great favour.

It was said that the Queen Mother of the West, moved by the emperor’s earnest seeking of immortality, descended to the Han palace and discoursed on the Supreme Way for three days before departing. In truth this was all a stratagem of Dongfang Shuo alone. Emperor Wu, given to wars and heavy taxation, had long incurred Heaven’s wrath and the people’s hatred. Though he spoke devotion to Taoism, he could not move the trust of the immortals. Moreover, the Queen Mother, as leader of the female immortals, could not so lightly descend to earth and linger three days in his palace. Such conduct is no different from mortals. The true facts were otherwise. Knowing Dongfang Shuo’s ability to invite immortals, the emperor repeatedly urged him to summon the Queen Mother. Dongfang Shuo, aware of the difficulty, was repeatedly importunate. Fully refusing was impossible, for officer and subject; yet reporting the matter would be unhelpful, and might incur the Queen Mother’s rebuke. Helpless, he devised a method, inviting several fellow immortals to impersonate the Queen Mother and her maids, complete with imperial carriage and ritual celestial chariots, descending on clouds to the air, discoursing on the great law with the emperor for three days.

Though wholly a counterfeit, they contributed many words of wisdom. If Emperor Wu could follow one or two teachings, he might invite Heavenly Harmony and receive boundless blessings, becoming a worthy ruler of his age. Even his own merit would not be small. Alas, his yearning for Taoism was but politeness, without sincere intent. Though words were earnest, the listener was drowsy and inattentive. Under such conditions, it is needless to say the genuine Queen Mother found it distasteful; even the counterfeit Queen Mother felt this man confused beyond cure. She reluctantly stayed three days in the palace. In truth, the emperor’s heart long ceased to hold such thoughts. Being exceedingly astute, he could understand ordinary doctrines without inquiry, and comprehend without learning. He had expected the Queen Mother’s descent to bring remarkable new discussions to expand his knowledge and open his mind. Yet the discourse was not quite apt. To put it simply, his sole hope was for a single pill of immortal medicine that would grant him longevity as ruler for millions of years. Though the Queen Mother was invited and immortals seen, within three days he only heard the most common and dull doctrines, lacking any fresh, special, or moving words. This was already enough to vex him. Moreover, the Queen Mother, lacking discernment, seeing his lack of interest, reverted to the main topic, saying the Supreme Way is simply ‘ordinary’. Because it is ordinary, it is near the heart. If it were strange or fantastic, it would become a deviation. To one who truly cultivates earnestly and calmly, this was a profound doctrine of infinite meaning, well worth pondering. But Emperor Wu only felt more bored. Being so clever, he suspected the Queen Mother was not genuine, but a trick of Dongfang Shuo. Perhaps, unable to summon the Queen Mother, fearing the emperor’s anger, he sent a celestial in her stead. Emperor Wu was among the greatest rulers in Chinese history; he would not be so easily deceived. Thinking thus, he grew furious, and commanded the palace eunuchs to summon Dongfang Shuo. Dongfang Shuo was at home refining a pill when suddenly summoned, sensing something unusual. Calculating the situation, he knew the truth, and was troubled. Yet the imperial command was strict; he could not delay, and so set out for the palace with a firm resolve.

Arriving, Emperor Wu was not angry, but smiled as usual and said: ‘You have invited the Queen Mother, and for days imparted scriptures and health secrets, which I have understood. But I have heard that in the Queen Mother’s garden, the peaches of immortality bloom but once in five thousand years, and fruit only after another five thousand. Fortunately, at each fruiting, the Queen Mother keeps many for gifts. There are some peaches unplucked for ten thousand years, yet preserving long. If a man can eat one, all disease vanishes and life is prolonged. Since I first met the Queen Mother, I have not dared to ask her directly. Can you seek for me, and present me with several?’ Dongfang Shuo had not expected the emperor to pose such a difficult question, designed to test the Queen Mother’s reality. If he refused, or failed to obtain any, it would prove the Queen Mother false, and he would be guilty of deceiving the sovereign. Only by consenting could he proceed. He answered that the Queen Mother descended for three days, and must return west today. He would accompany her to the Jade Pool, and beg for several, to present to His Majesty. The emperor, seeing his acceptance, was uncertain of his truth. For the sake of the peaches, he treated him the more favourably.

That evening, Dongfang Shuo had audience with the Queen Mother, and truly followed the ritual carriage ascending to the sky. They came to a mountain of immortals over the sea, many wandering immortals being his companions. The counterfeit Queen Mother was among them. They debated how to obtain the peaches. Some said: ‘An earthly emperor’s face is no trifle; to ask the Queen Mother for a few peaches is no great matter. It is best to ask straightforwardly.’ Others said: ‘The Han emperor is licentious and violent, no less than Qin’s rule. Though ancestral virtue prevents death and ruin, the Queen Mother is kindhearted and dislikes such men. If we ask and fail, how could we demand? Moreover, the counterfeit Queen Mother’s affair is not open and aboveboard. If we are implicated over the peaches, would it not alarm the grass and startle the snake, making trouble for ourselves?’ Hearing this, all the immortals were anxious for Dongfang Shuo. Yet he was clever and humorous, and after reflection contrived a most perfect method.

But he did not announce it then. Parting from the immortals, he left the mountain and came straight to the Jade Pool. Readers, try to guess his method! Haha, perhaps other matters are hard to guess, but Dongfang Shuo’s theft of the peaches is an ancient proverb known even to three-year-old children in the countryside. Yet matters are mysterious; no accurate record exists in history, and popular tales vary widely. What is the true story? Even the countryside children, without offence to you, may not fully comprehend.

At this point, you have probably understood that Dongfang Shuo came to the Jade Pool under imperial command to obtain peaches. Though the name was grand, the method was cunning. By chance, at this time, the Western Buddha was about to transmit doctrine to the Eastern lands, first expounding Buddhist mysteries. Apart from the immortal and mortal audience, other senior immortals had been invited early. The Queen Mother, naturally concerned as head of the female immortals, went with the Primordial Lord, chief emperors, and golden immortals to the West, leaving the Jade Pool quiet and its garden gates not strictly guarded. Only one great guardian deity and several immortal children stood watch. The Queen Mother was kindly and lenient with her attendants. Now that the master was away, these children had reason to be joyful and seek their own pleasures. The guardian deity was an elderly, cautious gentleman. Fortunately, the Queen Mother’s peaches had never been stolen. To be able to steal them requires great skill, surely that of a true immortal of the upper realm. Each Peach Banquet is attended by great guests; how could one be greedy enough to be both guest and thief? That would bring shame. Such things are inconceivable. Thus, although the guardian deity’s title is ‘Guardian’, there is little need to guard. Day and night the garden gates remain wide open; people come and go; never a petal or flower is missing. This duty is considered the most idle and free of the upper realm, a privilege without obligation. Yet matters of the world are full of the unexpected and unimaginable. At this very age, the great immortal of Jupiter, Dongfang the Great Immortal, has caused this trouble in the mortal world, and now comes to the Jade Pool to steal peaches. For the writer, such an impossible matter is surely beyond the Queen Mother herself in the West, to say nothing of the guardian deity and the immortal children.

If you would know how Dongfang Shuo stole the peaches, and whether danger followed, see the next chapter explained.
