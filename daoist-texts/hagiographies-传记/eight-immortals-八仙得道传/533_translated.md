# Chapter 65: The Star of Jupiter Plots a Cunning Scheme to Invite the Lord into a Jar — The Gatekeeper Boasts and Confesses Without Being Struck

Now it happened that Dongfang Shuo came to the Jade Pool, and he heard the news that the Queen Mother had departed to the Buddhist land. Rejoicing in his heart, he said, "This truly is heaven's aid to my success. Since the Queen Mother is not here, those celestial attendants under her command need not be visited, lest a single trace be left behind to mark a thief." He was well acquainted with the affairs of the garden. So he assumed the guise of a little maid, holding a flower hoe in one hand and a flower basket in the other, adorned in full cap and robe, and straightway entered by the main gate.

As fortune would have it, the guardian deity of the garden, since his mistress was absent, found himself free from business, the long days feeling as years, and without amusement. He had arranged with several fellow deities to gamble and amuse themselves in a small flower hall by the garden gate. Dongfang Shuo inwardly smiled: "What profit has the Queen Mother in guarding her garden with such as these? Had I known this before, even without the imperial edict of the Han emperor, I, old Shuo, would long ago have come to steal a few peaches and relish them - how excellent that would be!"

As he mused thus, he suddenly heard within loud shouting and clamour, with a great throng of men and women laughing and jesting, so noisy as to make the ears reel. Dongfang Shuo smiled and slowly advanced, approaching the place and strolling in to take a look. These people paid him no heed, engrossed in their gambling. Dongfang Shuo said, "You play all day long, and with no one to guard the garden, do you not fear that some wretched thief will enter and steal the Peaches of Immortality? When the Queen Mother returns tomorrow and makes inquiry, can you bear the charge?"

Hearing this, all turned to look. It was but a little girl, and they could not help but spit and laugh, saying, "What thief? Even if one had the courage of a leopard's gall and a tiger's heart, none would dare steal peaches from here." Another said, "Truly this is the seat of the Celestial Sovereign. Since the time there was grain and earth, everywhere one may see a thief or scoundrel or two, but here, these matters, the penalties and curses do not believe in detection."

While they spoke, all praised and extolled the place for a while. The guardian deity could not help wiping his beard, opening his mouth wide in laughter, and said, "What do you say? There are gentlemen everywhere, and scoundrels at every hour. In so vast a Jade Pool, is there no unruly scoundrel? Moreover, this place is the chief seat of myriad immortals. The immortals and gods of the four seas and nine continents, the five sacred mountains and eight wilds, even the spirits and monsters of the water and land realms, come to pay homage once every few decades. Are there none among them who are unworthy knaves mingling among them? To speak plainly, those who are thieves, unless they have no greed at all, once greed arises, they heed not personal harm or profit. Yet, those scoundrels of various realms, when they hear of the guardian deity's ten-thousand-year fame, their courage fails and not even the tip of a toe dares to touch the ground at the garden gate, much less enter to steal anything." Then loudly to all he said, "Friends, this is not mere boasting of your humble servant. Since I took charge, has there ever been the slightest stir in the Queen Mother's great garden? No barking of dogs, no crowing of cocks? Hence the Queen Mother has praised me highly, saying I have not failed in my duty."

All joined in the flattery, yet still kept up their gambling and shouting. Dongfang Shuo smiled to himself, saying, "See this state of affairs! This guardian deity plainly uses the Peach Garden as his place for taking commissions on gambling. This is indeed a good place. Except when the Jade Emperor himself or the two great patriarchs, Laozi and Yuanshi, come in person, no one else dares enter to search this garden — such a thing is unheard of in all ages. A benevolent and lenient Queen Mother, who does not appoint sentries here, but simply makes this bungling deity her shield to protect gambling." Thinking thus, he could not help laughing aloud. But having important business, he was unwilling to attend further to them. Yet as he was of a playful disposition, he went forth with a smile, quietly muttering, "I have not heard that this guardian deity ever had any trouble before guarding the garden. It is his own disorderly ways that will surely bring several thefts before long."

His words entered the guardian deity's ear, who instantly grew furious, shouting, "What girl is this, so rude and unregulated, daring to offend this deity? Order the ghost soldiers to seize her for me." Dongfang Shuo, alarmed, did not wait for their move, but quickened his steps and sprang away with leaps and bounds until he vanished without trace. His ears were keen, and even half a li away he could hear the speech of men. Seeing no pursuit, he stopped and listened; the guardian deity, though lazy by nature, was proud and was there beating his chest and stamping his feet, abusing her with foul epithets. Many others were there entreating and jesting to pacify him.

Again the guardian deity, in great anger, spoke spitefully: "Who knows whence this girl comes? I have been in this garden so long, every seventy or eighty years I examine these children, but I do not recall such a wretched creature. Could she be some friend's child playing here with her parents? Since she worries about the garden, saying a theft will soon occur, I shall be the more vigilant. From now on I will keep the main gate open day and night for three days, yet send no one to watch, to see who dares to offend the lord of this place. Unless this wretch's parents and siblings are greedy and short-sighted, and since they have never qualified for the peach feast, they might take this opportunity to steal a few to taste the difference. This child knows not her danger and speaks without discretion; it is only reasonable that she should be so. Know then that though the Queen Mother's peaches abound through the seasons, and endure a hundred years always fresh, they are not objects for those without blessing or ability to covet. Tomorrow, when the gods make their inspection, should they find the peaches missing, the guardian general will give the thief a sound whipping and drive them from the mountain, forbidding entry to the Jade Pool. Then I shall make this wretch and her kin know the dignity and power of this deity."

The guardian deity grew more and more angry as he scolded. Though many tried to persuade him, he was but a minor deity, accustomed to such flattery from this gambling cohort, and fond of blowing his own horn. Knowing him to be vain, who would dare pierce his paper window? Let him bluster as he would. But today, before so many, a mere child’s light word had stripped away his glory and made him furious. The more he raged, the more the bystanders urged moderation. Dongfang Shuo listened to his furious tirade and was three parts annoyed, seven parts amused; he spat and laughed, saying, "He may curse his little girl, his wretched wench, but what concern is that of mine? I am come to steal my peaches."

He passed through flower clusters and willow paths as he journeyed on. He met several young celestial maidens, some with famous flowers in their hair, some holding tender leaves, others carrying flower baskets ready to take back to their chambers, laughing and chatting in groups, coming and going as if butterflies dancing amid flowers. Yet all were innocent and unspoiled maidens, naturally graceful and beyond artifice. Being a man fond of amusement, Dongfang Shuo put aside his serious business and pondered how best to sport with these maidens.

While thus hesitating, suddenly a girl in red, holding a small flower hoe, was whispering with a green-clad maiden beneath a willow shade, their talk full of interest. Seeing few about, Dongfang Shuo, emboldened, stepped forward and smilingly said, "What are you two sisters doing here? Why do you not go yonder to play?"

The girl in red looked him over and asked, "Who are you? Though you have been in the garden so long, I have never seen you before." The green-clad girl nodded, "Indeed so; none like you are known here. Whence came you, whither go you? What do you do in this garden?"

Dongfang Shuo quickly smiled and made reply, "Indeed, you two sisters do not know me. I am the guardian deity’s young daughter, seldom entering the garden. Hence many sisters here have scarcely made my acquaintance." The girl in red laughed, "Oh, so you are the guardian deity’s little daughter. One would not have thought this lord so aged — now five or six hundred years old — could have such a young sister." They both laughed together.

Dongfang Shuo smiled at their ignorance of human affairs. Hearing their words was most amusing. About to reply, the girl in red again asked, "Why do you seldom come in, and why have you come today?"

Dongfang Shuo answered, "Formerly, there were no servants at home; I had to care for my younger brothers and sisters, so had no time to come in and play." The two women were more amazed and said, "Indeed? You have younger brothers and sisters too?" Dongfang Shuo laughed, "Why not? Several of them. My father’s matters are little regarded; he is addicted to gambling and yet manages to sire children. Above me there are already twenty-seven or twenty-eight older brothers and sisters. Now I have four or five younger than myself."

This talk made them click their tongues and laugh unceasingly. Dongfang Shuo said, "I was not meant to come today. My elder brothers and sisters often come to the garden, and are well known, so it is difficult for them to come and play." Hearing this they were astonished, "What can this mean? How can being known make it harder to come and play? You, a stranger, may roam the garden freely. What is the reason for this?"

Seeing their question, Dongfang Shuo glanced about and, seeing no one near, whispered with a smile, "I tell you, sisters, do not speak of this to others. If word gets out, my father will be guilty and may beat me to death." The two women regarded this as great news and said, "There is no outsider here; tell us quickly. We will not betray you. Speak boldly."

Dongfang Shuo then hesitated but told them, "My father, growing old and weak, must eat one peach each year to keep from sickness and pain. Since he took charge of this garden, each year at this time he sends my elder brothers and sisters into the garden to steal one or two peaches unseen; this keeps them healthier and stronger than when young. This year he planned to send my twenty-eighth brother. But since the Queen Mother went to the Buddhist land, the mountain guardian often patrols outside the garden. Father fears trouble, so sent me to steal instead. First, I am a stranger unknown here, so if peaches go missing, no one will suspect my family. Second, I am young; even if seen, it will be said a child is greedy and careless, not a great crime. Thus I was sent. Because there are many attendants in the garden and father fears I may fail, he has invited many to gamble in the room by the gate, drawing them away. The rest are sisters about my age, so easier to manage."

These words left the two women silent, exchanging glances. Dongfang Shuo smiled and turned into the woods, disappearing in a flash. They stood a moment then said, "No wonder the plague deity has grown so fond of gambling — now we see the cause. This is keeping watch and stealing oneself!" The girl in red sneered, "That old fellow was never a good thing. Always acting imperious and aloof to us. Last year, I lost a silk handkerchief in the pavilion and tried to retrieve it. But at the gate he scowled and said the garden was closed for the night, no one could enter. I was angry and gave up. Since he is so strict and law-abiding, how could he do what others dare not, will not, or cannot do — boldly sending a champion thief each year? The Queen Mother herself tastes the peaches yearly, yet he, a mere garden official, claims such might — how intolerable!" The green-clad girl laughed, "Sister, if you did not recall past events, it would be well. We have all suffered from that old man. Seeing his age and authority, we endured. These were minor matters. But now this is a great case. The garden’s old and new peaches are numbered. Every thousand years the Queen Mother sends agents to inspect. Another inspection nears, and many peaches are missing. He is the guardian; who would suspect him? It must be one of us taking the blame. If he sets himself up proud and treats us all as thieves, how can we endure such grievance?"

As they talked, a group of girls came hand in hand, and the two forgot their vow to keep Dongfang Shuo’s secret. Annoyed, they called over the newcomers and told all they had learned. Before fully explained, more girls arrived preparing to leave the garden for the palace, as this was the only route. Soon nearly all the maidens were gathered. The girl in red repeated carefully all she had heard. The group grew angry to the point of speechlessness.

These women all hated the guardian deity for his frequent abuse of power and oppression; nursing resentment without redress, now fearing that when the inspection came, they might bear his punishment unjustly. Fearing this, they resolved to strike first to clear their innocence. They held a meeting on the grass, and among the eldest sisters, Su E and Han Ying, both eloquent and persuasive, were chosen to go quickly to the mountain guardian deity to explain the matter. They sought to ensure the old and new peaches were unharmed, and that rewards and punishments be made clear, so they might avoid blame.

The mountain guardian deity was a wise, upright, and unyielding god, wholly unlike the lazy, gambling, negligent garden guardian. Upon receiving the report, he resolved to enter the garden and seize the gamblers. The gamblers, seeing him come, hastily hid their cards, though many were found scattered on the ground. The deity signaled some soldiers who entered with him. The soldiers laughed, "Guardian deity, how came you to lose so many cards on the ground? Let us pick them up for you." As they collected, some cards were slyly pocketed. The guardian deity was ashamed and said nothing. The chief deity smiled, "Though idle here, playing with trifles is not forbidden. But have you lately kept watch for any scoundrels sneaking in to steal peaches? That is your sole duty."

Hearing this, the guardian deity brightened and answered, "How dare your servant neglect his duty? Since I took this post, I have laboured day and night without slackening. Thanks to your blessing, in two hundred years no theft has occurred." The chief deity laughed, "That is commendable." Then rising, he said, "There are some matters to inspect in the garden. Please go ahead; I need not accompany you." This speech again filled the guardian deity with fear and dismay.

Whether the chief deity discovered anything, or whether Dongfang Shuo succeeded in stealing peaches, shall be told in the next chapter.
