# Chapter 66: The Holy Mother Returns to the Mountain to Redress the Wrong; The Ghost Official Favors and Borrows a Chaste Soul

Now it happened that the general deity who guards the Yaochi Mountain received a report from the many fairy maidens, saying: "The guardian spirit of the garden has committed various irregular acts, especially the theft of the Peaches of Immortality, which is the most serious matter." The chief officer, leading the divine soldiers, came to the garden, and the first thing he observed was the guardian spirit gambling. Knowing well that his misdeeds were real, he yet refrained from anger, but proceeded with his soldiers into the garden, and specified the number of old and new peaches. According to the records kept over many years, he inspected each tree and place, and indeed found that more than ten peaches were missing. Therefore he issued an order to detain the guardian spirit, awaiting the Queen Mother’s return to pass judgment. Meanwhile, the chief deity selected and appointed a suitable and meticulous divine official to take over the duty of guarding the garden. 

The peaches in the Queen Mother’s garden were indeed many, but it had been handed down through the ages that only Eastern Shuo was known to have stolen peaches. Beyond Eastern Shuo, there was no report of a second or third thief of peaches. Moreover, the sacred land of the Yaochi was guarded by many immortals and spirits. The Queen Mother, revered above all immortals, had her possessions in the garden—who would dare to come to steal? Even Eastern Shuo's theft was compelled by the earthly emperor’s command, and he could do nothing else but try it once. Fortuitously, he encountered the Queen Mother journeying in the west, and the garden spirit being negligent, he succeeded and returned with the peaches. Without such an opportunity, it would hardly be so easy. 

As for the allegation that the guardian spirit stole from his own keeping, this came from the mouth of Eastern Shuo himself—he was a humorous character, and having suffered a loss at the hand of the guardian spirit, he played a trick to implicate him falsely, which was his intention. 

The reader, considering thus, would know that all the missing peaches were obtained by Eastern Shuo alone. He thought, either do not do it at all, or do not stop until done; since he had once become a thief, he cared not for guilt; thus he stole more than ten peaches. This caused the guardian spirit to be wrongfully accused without defense, losing his post, and fearing future punishment. This might also be called a retribution for neglecting his duty and careless speech. When the Queen Mother returned to Yaochi, her wisdom illuminated all, subtle and minute; the truth was naturally clear at a glance. She summoned the guardian deity, and told him of Eastern Shuo’s theft and the false accusation upon the garden spirit. 

As for Eastern Shuo, since he was naturally playful and not intentionally evil, and having served the Han dynasty with merit for the people, he might have been pardoned. But fearing others might imitate, and unable to neglect punishment, it was decreed that he suffer slight fear and trembling in the mortal realm, and his crime be mitigated. The garden spirit, though not a thief, had neglected duty and erred, and was accordingly punished to sweep the garden for three years. After the three years, if he could rouse his spirit and perform merit, he might be transferred to another post. The matter was thus settled, and all reverently praised the holy virtue. Though the garden spirit was demoted, his name was cleared, and he was grateful. Only Eastern Shuo stole the peaches, and returned them to Emperor Wu. The emperor was greatly pleased, and henceforth treated him with special favour. 

Years passed, and Emperor Wu, doubting the slow methods of the Queen Mother’s teachings, disbelieved the words “immortal cultivation.” Hearing from ministers of a certain Taoist Li Shaojun who knew the path of life and death, and possessed the elixir of immortality, he specially dispatched high officials to invite him. Shaojun was a disciple of a demonic school, and upon seeing the emperor, boasted that cultivation was easy and ascending to heaven was as simple as turning one’s hand. The emperor, weary of the Queen Mother’s difficult path, was pleased to hear this, and favoured Shaojun above Eastern Shuo. 

At this time, having recently lost his favoured consort Lady Li, the emperor was deeply grieved and could not take his mind off her. Shaojun perceived the emperor’s heart, and claimed he could cause the soul of the deceased consort to meet the emperor. The emperor ordered a clean chamber in the palace to be prepared for a trial. After leaving the palace, Shaojun sought out his friend Wang Yizhi, and proposed to borrow the soul of a female ghost under his command, to substitute for the consort’s soul and meet the emperor. 

At this time, Yizhi was old and more confused in mind, spending his days drinking in the company of friends, drunken to neglect of affairs. His disciple Fei Changfang, deeply attached, often remonstrated sternly, but Yizhi, thinking he had failed in cultivation and was old, wished only to enjoy his remaining days, and would not be troubled with worldly matters. Changfang’s counsel was in vain. 

Now Shaojun asked to borrow a ghost soul, and Yizhi, with bleary drunken eyes, laughed: “That is easy, but you must give me ten jars of good wine. I will choose the most beautiful ghost, fat or thin, tall or short, as you desire, to take and use.” Shaojun laughed and said: “You only grow more fond of drink with age. Why pour such yellow wine down your throat? If you get drunk and err, and the ghosts attack you tomorrow, can you escape?” Yizhi laughed and retorted: “Nonsense, I am the leader of millions of ghosts in the world. What evil ghost dares to oppose me?” Shaojun said: “Only joking; why get so angry? You want ten jars of good wine? That is very easy. I will send them immediately, and also a feast of fine dishes for your drinking. Is that well?” 

With these words Yizhi was greatly pleased, laughing and thanking him. He took a recent register of female ghosts, saying: “Tonight, bring the wine and feast. We shall drink ourselves fully drunk. I will then summon the ghosts, and you can choose one yourself. I will teach you a secret to bring that ghost to the palace; if you wish to keep her, keep her; if not, release her at once. Brother, if I do this for you, these ten jars of wine and the feast are not wasted, are they?” Shaojun was delighted, parted from Yizhi, and at once sent the ten jars of wine, and arranged a sumptuous feast in a famous tavern to be delivered. At night he went to Yizhi’s home, and the old friends drank with great enthusiasm. By midnight both were quite drunk. Shaojun, anxious, called for Yizhi to summon a group of female ghosts for a sight. Yizhi, in high spirits, led him into a dark chamber. Yizhi waved his hand slightly, and a dark vapor rose from the floor.

Shaojun shuddered involuntarily, and looked closely to see a shaggy-haired, bare-chested, bare-footed male ghost who folded his hands before Yizhi, asking: “What commands has the master?” Yizhi ordered: “Summon the newly arrived female ghosts to come all at once before me.” The ghost howled, black wind blew, and all vanished in a moment. Yizhi said: “This is the ghost attendant awaiting orders.” Shaojun asked: “In such darkness, even with fair women, how can one see them?” Yizhi laughed: “Why worry? In the mortal world, when ghosts gather, the Yin energy grows strong, even extinguishing lights. Strong ghosts come and go with whirlwinds; though a hundred paces away they can blow out a great light. To meet ghosts, one must prepare a bright lamp with a horned cover, to avoid being extinguished or overcome by Yin energy. Today many ghosts are summoned, the Yin energy is great; a bright lamp may not suffice. I have prepared a kind of electric fire, the most potent fire in the world. Actually, ‘in the world’ is but a phrase; where else but in Heaven could such fire be found? Simply put, it is the electric fire of thunder and lightning. Thunder has Lord Thunder, lightning Lady Lightning. Though thunder and lightning are natural, Lord and Lady have authority and duty to govern them. I borrowed this electric fire from Lady Lightning because many fierce ghosts form groups and disobey orders, hiding and troubling you in the dark. Even with weapons to kill ghosts, one may be at a loss. Therefore I requested Master Iron-Crutch Li to ask Lady Lightning to lend some electric power.”

He then took from his bag two plates neither copper nor iron, and said: “These are precious treasures tempered in my master’s gourd, called electric plates. When rubbed, they draw electricity from the air into the room. My master also says: ‘Two thousand years hence, the world’s morals will grow thin, human hearts like ghosts. Lights used in the world will be inadequate. Then Lady Lightning’s responsibility will be greater, for all fire depends on her electric power for great illumination, lighting the world.’” Shaojun laughed: “That sounds like jest. Will people two thousand years hence be able to borrow electricity from Lady Lightning as you do?” Yizhi sneered: “You do not understand. As said, electricity is a natural thing of Heaven and Earth, not Lady Lightning’s private property, nor made by her; she only manages and governs it.

Moreover, all things under Heaven are for all people’s use. In the future, since light depends on electricity, the world will certainly harness electric light. The method will be as common as farming and weaving are today, with no marvel. But the right to send electricity will remain with Lady Lightning. Just as electricity known now is not Lady Lightning’s own, but under her management and control.” As Yizhi spoke, he cast a spell, drawing the electric light in. In a moment, the room was bright as daylight, but the light was pure, like moonlight, not as fierce or red as sunlight. Shaojun, standing aside, felt heat and discomfort, and asked: “When will the ghosts arrive?”

Yizhi made a gesture and drew a talisman, suddenly showing anger, and shouted into the air: “How can you be so unruly and not come after so long?” Before he finished, a whirlwind appeared, stirring the dust on the floor, and stopped near the electric light. Many female ghosts then noisily stood before them, all saluting Yizhi, who smiled proudly and did not return the greeting. Shaojun looked carefully and saw some with dishevelled hair, bleeding from orifices; others were well-dressed, fair of countenance, lips red and teeth white, like living persons; some fat as pigs and dull as oxen; some over ten feet tall, others scarcely three feet. Shaojun, having heard from palace attendants that the late consort was a slender, graceful beauty, boldly searched for a ghost fitting that description.

After much searching, they found one, barely over twenty years old, resembling the description in seven or eight points. Shaojun examined her carefully, noting her peach-like cheeks, apricot eyes, cherry mouth, and willow waist—a peerless beauty. What was puzzling was that the other ghosts showed anger or illness, but this ghost was cold, severe, neither angry nor sorrowful, and showed no levity. Shaojun said: “Brother Wang, please trouble this lady to accompany us.” Wang nodded: “Very well, you may take her.” 

Before he could speak, the ghost solemnly asked: “May I ask, Master, where I am to go with this official? I lived with unwillingness to be easily compromised, and so came to this dead end. Having become an underworld spirit, am I not free to keep my resolve, and must go with a strange man somewhere? Though cut off from the living world, no one knows, my temper is to prefer solitude and not live among the living. Please tell your friend to choose another.” 

Wang, naturally irritable and drunk, seeing a ghost dare to be so stubborn, fearing Shaojun’s ridicule, shouted: “How dare you disobey orders! Hear this: this official is the most honoured person before the emperor. He takes you to see the emperor; you can gain some benefit. This is what many seek but cannot obtain, yet you refuse—are you truly ungrateful?” Having said this, he would not let her speak more, and asked Shaojun to make a charm. A fragrant breeze slowly entered his sleeve. Wang said: “This ghost is now by your side. You may do as you please with her, but do not commit adultery with her; that is a grave crime. Not only you, but I too would be ground to dust!” After this, he withdrew the electric light, waved his hand, and a whirlwind dispersed the ghosts. The two came out of the chamber and resumed drinking.

After drinking, Shaojun laughed and asked: “Just now we did not think of the imperial consort—is it really impossible to summon her?” Wang shook his head: “That is difficult. You must know, a woman who became imperial consort is no ordinary woman, either descended from stars, or a demoted immortal. After death, some return to their ranks; some who sinned are further punished and demoted; some are cast into hell with no release; some with merit are promoted. These are beyond my jurisdiction, and I cannot summon them. Otherwise, I could find this consort’s soul to meet the emperor again, which would be better than this trickery. Why trouble with substitution?” Shaojun asked: “Why is this ghost so stubborn? You are their chief commander, yet she fears you not. How is this?”

Wang said: “Do not underestimate this ghost. She was a girl from a scholarly family, surnamed Wang, called Yingying. Betrothed in infancy to a family named Liu, both families prosperous at the time, a suitable match. But the Liu child was unlucky. Since birth, the family suffered deaths, floods, and fire in turn, leaving them destitute. When the child grew, though learned, the family was broken and perished, and he was sent to his father-in-law’s by an old family retainer with money and effort, hoping for support. But Yingying’s parents were no good people; hearing Liu’s plight, they planned to marry her elsewhere.

Yingying was a famous beauty, full of learning, from a local official family—many young men wished to wed her. Her father sought a second husband, based on power. He said: ‘Though broken, with power one can recover; without power, though comfortable now, one cannot endure misfortune.’ Therefore he favored a prime minister’s son, thinking to rely on his position for security and promotion. He explained this to his daughter. But Yingying was a woman of integrity. Hearing this, she nearly died from grief, saying: ‘A woman cannot have two husbands. Even if married to swine and dogs, I will follow them, and let people mock me as a beast, I have no shame. But to crave power and hate poverty, and remarry, even to a prince, is a loss of chastity and eternal disgrace. For temporary comfort to bear endless scorn is never worth it.’ Her father was furious, locked her in a room with her mother and beat her. She yielded under punishment.

At night she secretly hanged herself, but a servant saved her. Since then, relations with her parents grew bitter. By ill fate, the Liu child came to seek his father-in-law. Yingying’s father, unwelcoming and fearful she would learn, hastily sent him fifty taels of silver, ordering him to return to study, and forbidding further visits if he failed to obtain office in two years. The Liu child, resentful, threw the silver in the doorway and cursed loudly. This became known to Yingying, who sent her maid secretly to explain her loyal resolve, and to promise to return with him.

But the maid’s loose tongue revealed this, and Yingying was confined in a room, allowed food and drink only, no one to open the door; her parents falsely said she had attempted suicide. The trouble all began with the Liu child. Attempts were made to scare him away, but he laughed, saying: ‘If the lady guards her chastity for me, I die content. Whatever my father-in-law does, I care not. Even if not opposed, I will accompany the lady in death.’

The affair became known throughout the city, and people accused old Wang of greed and cruelty, driving away a son-in-law. The prime minister forbade his son to marry Yingying. This maddened old Wang, who could only speak with her. Since confinement, Yingying had resolved to die for Liu, though her husband remained unaware. Bearing great sorrow, she barely survived, but was again beaten by her father.

Old Wang spread rumors that the Liu child was dead, and servants lamented his sad death. Yingying, in anger, unthinkingly hanged herself at night. After death, her resentful spirit haunted the house, causing disturbances. Her father, driven to despair, called me to take her back. Such a chaste and righteous soul was not like ordinary ghosts, and could not be restrained long in the underworld. When her case was settled, she would be reborn into a good family.

I could only hold her for a month or two; other ghosts might stay longer, but not her. When affairs were done, you must return her to me at once. One more thing: you must know that to use her to substitute for Lady Li, she is a maiden who never left the country, very chaste, and may not consent to impersonate a wife or claim a husband. If at meeting she should quarrel, all would be awkward. It is best to keep her far from the emperor, so they may see but not approach; their speech is unintelligible, and any flaw easily concealed. This is very important.”

Shaojun thanked him repeatedly, took Yingying’s ghost straight to the palace, and reported to Emperor Wu: “I have, by command, brought Lady Li’s living soul, but she may meet only at midnight. As Your Majesty is the exalted ruler of all under Heaven, majestic and formidable, it is feared that ghosts cannot approach. At meeting, they can only look from afar, and may not converse. Please be cautious.” The emperor sought only to see Lady Li; speech was secondary. Hearing this, he consented. At midnight, Shaojun arranged everything, and invited the emperor to the meeting.

What befell when the emperor met Yingying will be related in the next chapter.
