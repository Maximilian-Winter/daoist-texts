# Chapter Seventy-Four: The Confused Woman Overcome and Restrained, The Immortal Zhang’s Compassion Bestows the Water Light

Now it befell that Chunying gathered a small pail of water, which yet contained the volume of half the Eastern Sea, prepared to inundate all the temples and houses within and without Hangzhou, destroying lives and property. But in mid-mountain she met a little girl, to whom she courteously and earnestly spoke for a long while. At last, the girl drank in one draught the vast water of half the sea that was in the pail, gulping it clean and dry, leaving not a drop. This caused Chunying to be so frightened that she fell fainting to the ground, motionless for a long time. The girl, seeing her plight, hastened to help her up, saying, “I thought Mother was unwilling that I should finish your water. It is not for this little water that you look so distressed. Now that the water is all drunk, to speak honestly, I have but a single sincere thought, that I may never forget Mother’s mind. As for my drinking capacity, Mother, do not look upon my small body and narrow belly; if I drink to my utmost, even if you were to grant me ten or eight more pails like this, it would not relieve my thirst.”

Chunying, supported by her, sat upon a stone, and again fixed her eyes upon the girl with intense earnestness, then burst forth into loud weeping, saying, “Well, I know you. You are not truly a girl. You are Zhongli Quan, sent by the Elder of the Eastern Flower to kill my husband and children. Now knowing I seek vengeance for my husband, you specially come to seize me. I had intended that today’s act should cause both my body and all the spirits and living things to perish together; I have already let you in upon this purpose. If you do not believe me, I have here also a keen blade. See, what is it for? To speak honestly, I have told you all my words. Revenge or no revenge, it no longer concerns myself. If I revenge, I die; if I do not, I also die. In any case, by this one action, my conscience after death may be without reproach to Heaven and Earth, and I may behold my late husband and four children below the ground. Now that I have met you, it is as if my foe has come. I have cultivated for many years, and by the legacy of my late husband’s spirit and his dying instructions, I have learned some little arts. To gather one pail of sea water has cost me ten years’ toil, and the peril of gathering the sea water is so great, how could it be that by one light draught of yours it is all swallowed without a drop remaining? This shows how much your power surpasses mine by countless degrees. Thus, the issue between us is already decided. Even if I were to overestimate myself and contend with you fiercely once more, would the result be otherwise? Then why need the superfluous exertion?”

Zhongli Quan, hearing her reveal her course of action, no longer concealed himself. With a wave of the tablet in his hand, he immediately transformed again into a young Daoist of fair complexion and red lips, as before when they last met. Because she spoke so pitifully and was so sincere and grievous, his heart was indeed moved to pity and he could not bear to harm her. Therefore, reasoning with her on principles and feelings, he repeatedly exhorted her, and explained to her that her mother had indeed been crushed to death by the old flood-dragon. He urged her to cast off the old flood-dragon, to hasten repentance and self-cultivation of the true way, saying, “In the future, the fruit of accomplishment may be expected, and boundless blessings await. Why give over your life’s happiness wholly into the hands of your mother’s murderous enemy? Even if today you had not met me, your vengeance for the slain husband would yet be fulfilled utterly and clearly. But the judgment of the world and future generations upon you, I fear, will not be that your filial courage for your husband and children outweighs the guilt of unfilial conduct. The issues of right and wrong, gain and loss, are very clear and need no explanation or reflection. How can one so supremely wise as yourself fail to understand?”

Zhongli Quan’s words were brief and to the point, reason clear and language flowing. As he said, the matters of gain and loss, right and wrong, are indeed very clear. One who is somewhat capable of adapting to circumstances, hearing these words, would surely be enlightened, change his mind at once, and immediately turn from the way of error to seek a new life. Is it not better to lose something at the east and yet recover it at the mulberry and elm? But alas, Chunying was by nature stubborn and obstinate; once she had believed in a person, she never doubted him again. If anyone pointed out her faults, even with evidence, she would not alter her mind; if she had once settled on a course of action, she would not turn from it, but would strive to the utmost, life or death, regardless of success or failure. In truth, such a person is the most respectable, admirable, and hopeful in the world. But such a character is also attended by a great danger, namely error in observation and mistaken judgment. For their perseverance is strongest and their faith most absolute; with those they trust, this faith and steadfastness is fitting and proper. But if they encounter a false person or a mistaken matter, they will believe and adhere to it all the same, raising that person to full stature and exerting themselves to the utmost, sacrificing themselves and striving with all their might for that erroneous thing. Thus they go wrong from head to foot, from life to death’s path, even unto the verge of death, yet still disbelieve that those who harm them are evil, and that the things done are wrong. This accords with the ancient saying of a great error forged by the nine provinces of iron. Is there in the world anything more dangerous and fearful than this?

The gentlemen who have read the foregoing chapters may roughly understand Chunying’s character, which is of this very kind. Alas, she also met with fearful and terrible matters. First, she firmly believed that her husband was truly an immortal, a seed of affection; and those who fought him and slew him were demons and spirits of the evil way. Next, she was wedded to such an affectionate and virtuous husband, and had once before him spoken words of vengeance in his stead. If she could speak them, how could she not accomplish them? Knowing her own power was limited, and that she would act regardless of success or failure, only following the peace of her heart. Such great spirit and tenacity are rare among men; how much more from a widow without strength or courage! How could she fail to command respect and sympathy? Yet the person she encountered was a deceitful demon, and the murderer of her mother; thus what she deemed her utmost duty, to devote herself to with life or death, was but a meaningless and reasonless act. Her stubborn nature could it be persuaded? The more Zhongli Quan declared the old flood-dragon worthless, the more Chunying grew to hate him with biting heart and teeth, and the more resolute was her unyielding resolve while life yet remained. This matter, due to Chunying’s stubbornness and self-harm, may yet have a certain fate within it. Hence the Emperor of the Eastern Flower, before dispatching Zhongli Quan, had already foreseen that Chunying could not be persuaded to submit. Zhongli Quan, having cultivated for centuries and read all the secret scriptures of the Jade Void, could guess these matters. Knowing it was of no avail, he yet did not hesitate to expend words, seeking earnestly to do good.

Leaving such discourse, we return to Chunying, who hearing Zhongli Quan’s exhortations, took them as the autumn wind passing her ear, paying no heed, but only demanded that Zhongli Quan grant her death. Zhongli Quan at first was unwilling to strike, but later hearing her say, “You are my enemy; if you do not kill me, I cannot but take your life. Should you flee elsewhere, I will still go to every sea to gather water and flood the city, and wait rather for you to come to drink my water, then give you my life,” he knew the Master’s foresight was no error. It appeared that this woman’s stubbornness was inborn, beyond human persuasion or rescue. Rather than leaving her alive to harm others, it was better to confine her for a time. Perhaps after many years her nature might soften, and then exhortation might be effective. Yet to see such a chaste woman suffer at his hands, how could he be at peace? He could not but shed two tears of pity, and said to her mournfully, “Madam, this is my last exhortation. The old flood-dragon is indeed your mother’s murderer. As custom ordains, a father and mother’s enemy is not to be tolerated under one heaven. Madam, you only think to avenge your husband, but know not that the one you seek to avenge him upon is your own implacable foe. Before, you were deceived by him, thinking him a loving husband. Now that I have proved it, if you do not believe, you are truly the most foolish and obstinate and unfilial person in the world. I pity you suffering undeservedly, respect your pure honor and loyal nature, and so have asked the Master to repeatedly enlighten you. I hope you will desist at the cliff, turn back to the shore. As you duly cultivate your heart and nature, return into the Dao, I, though unworthy, may yet be entrusted to guide you. When in future your life is clear and you attain the highest Dao, shedding the dust of the world and ascending to the abode of immortals, to dwell with sun and moon and endure with Heaven and Earth, is this not the greatest joy in the world? Madam, your wisdom is beyond men’s; I entreat you to consider well and act accordingly.”

Zhongli Quan spoke with all his heart, but Chunying only heard the words “return into the Dao,” and coldly said, “That need not be said. I have heard from my late husband that your sects are divided, mostly masters and slaves, each setting up their party and opposing dissenters. My late husband was slain because he would not conform to your sect; even my four children were sent to death by your hands. This hatred is as if not to be endured under the same sky. I only know you are unfaithful to your husband, unkind to your children; vengeance without courage is nothing; flattering one’s enemy is shameful. Such unfaithful, unkind, cowardly, and shameful persons, it were shame enough for them to remain in the world. If you have true benevolence, lend me your sword and quickly kill me; thus satisfying my will, I may have my jest. As for your baseless and unfounded words, your hypocritical benevolence and righteousness, in my ignorance I am not taken by them.” Having said this, she stretched out her neck and called, “Use your punishment!” Zhongli Quan, seeing her so obstinate, felt vexed, then stepped back three paces and cried sternly, “Madam, listen. Since you are resolved in your obstinacy, I must carry out Heaven’s punishment, according to the law. But my precious sword is unwilling to slay the innocent. I will now confine you beneath this mountain, and grant you a fasting pill; when hungry you may swallow it, and you will never know hunger or thirst. If you can repent and change your mind, there may yet be a day of deliverance. Also, Heaven’s decree has appointed another to rescue you hereafter. Be patient and endure.”

So saying, he covered his face, cast down a red pill, then raised his hand and pressed upon Chunying’s body. There was a great rumbling, and half of City God Mountain was overturned. Chunying was sealed in a stone cave within the mountain. Soon she transformed into a female flood-dragon, crouching within. At first she endured hunger and thirst, hating life so sorely that she wished to die. But unable to bear it, she swallowed the pill. The celestial medicine was potent; henceforth she knew no hunger or thirst. Yet confined deep in the mountain, unable to move. Zhongli Quan hoped she would repent and cultivate the Way, but Chunying’s hatred only grew, bitter and biting. Her existence in this limbo was more grievous than death. Fortunately the cave, moved by Zhongli Quan’s art, was not narrow. Dwelling there long, she gradually adapted and found peace, though she saw no daylight and knew not night from day. The heart of man is like the dragon’s body; without water it is uneasy. Though there were mountain waters, there was no space to move, nor knowledge when she might emerge. When she thought upon it, she felt great distress.

Until the Southern Song period, when Xu Jingyang attained the Great Way and was granted rank of Perfected One, wandering he came here, fond of the beauty of the mountains and waters, lingering long. Suddenly he saw from the hilltop faint traces of resentment wandering about. Counting on his fingers, he knew the cause. Then he exerted great power, sending his voice to inquire if she had words to say. The female flood-dragon, confined so long, hearing human voice, was more pleased than hearing footsteps echoing in an empty valley. She cried aloud, pleading to be moved to a place with water and to see daylight. Xu Jingyang’s heart was moved, and he used his power to transfer her to a source of water. Drawing a talisman, he dug a great hole, admitting daylight.

By chance the people of the place wished to dig a great well; now the flat earth burst open a hole. The crowd, amazed, made tests and found deep spring water below. They rejoiced greatly, deeming it a celestial gift, and enclosed the original hole with stone railings, forming a great well. Hence the female flood-dragon, though underground, had water to swim and light to see. The Perfected One, fearing her escape, sealed her with a talisman so she could not get out, and taught her many methods of heart-cultivation and breathing exercises, bidding her practice well and not waste her days underground. The flood-dragon gratefully accepted these commands, and asked when she might emerge. The Perfected One said, “The realm is made by the mind; with right mind the realm is wide. To know when you may emerge, ask yourself when you can see your nature and enlighten your heart.” The flood-dragon then related her life’s grievances and woes.

The Perfected One laughed, saying, “You are originally innocent, but have brought this calamity upon yourself. I know all your past, so need not speak further. ‘To cultivate the true Way and learn the Dao, dwelling in mountains or caves, is all the same. If you can apply your mind to cultivation, whether you become Buddha or immortal, this may be the starting place. When your great work is complete, do not say the humble talisman is gone; perhaps a heavenly spirit will descend to welcome you to ascend to Heaven. Why rush to emerge? Wandering in the mundane world, only entangles the mind, what profit is there? As for your years of cultivation, if you truly advance without change, about three thousand years hence you may succeed. If your nature is pure and your desires few, the progress will be easier than usual. I promise you three thousand years because your affections are deep. Though these are rightful feelings, they are not fitting for the Way. For this reason I have decreed that only when you reach such a degree may your power and Way dispel your husband’s offences. You yourself may become a heavenly immortal, your husband may share your light, escaping hell to become immortal. Know that the three thousand years’ cultivation is not for you alone!”

The flood-dragon wept, saying, “If what the Master says is so, must my husband, who died so cruelly, still suffer the tortures of hell?” The Perfected One laughed heartily, “The crimes your husband committed are beyond telling. All that Zhongli Xian said to you before was true, but you would not believe. By his deeds and the harm he wrought upon people and creatures, his deserved punishment is to dwell in the eighteen levels of hell for ten million years, and this is no exaggeration. Do you speak so lightly and calmly? Even what I said of three thousand years hence that he may share your light is only to say that this may be possible; I have not said that upon your becoming a heavenly immortal you may rescue him immediately from prison and become an incorruptible body. In truth, it depends upon whether he can repent and cultivate diligently. To speak plainly, it is only through your merit that he may be pulled out of hell and gain the qualification to cultivate the Way. If wives becoming enlightened could bring all evil husbands to heaven, would not the world be full of favoritism and injustice?”

The flood-dragon was silent. The Perfected One comforted her, saying, “Do not be impatient or resentful. As the saying goes, ‘To endure the bitterness of bitterness, one becomes a man above men.’ As I have said, cultivators eat no delicacies and lodge in no fine places. You now have water, light, and a cave abode, a peaceful dwelling without beasts or demons to trouble you. Compared with ordinary cultivators, you are already much favored. You must regard your present circumstances as a blessing, not a disaster. With mind and breath at peace, the condition becomes joyful. When your great work is finished, a great bright realm will appear before your eyes; that will be your day of emergence, and your day of ascension. Strive diligently and do well. I go now.” With a stamp of his feet he vanished, leaving the flood-dragon kneeling in the cave to see him off.

From then on she kept the Perfected One’s instructions ever in her heart. After several years, her mind was wholly calm, her resentments released, and she quietly and peacefully began cultivation underground. But because the Perfected One had said, “When you have succeeded in the Way, great light shall appear before your eyes,” the people of Hangzhou transmitted this into a laughable rumor.

What rumor it was remains to be revealed in the next chapter.
