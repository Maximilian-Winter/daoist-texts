# Chapter 79: The Spirit Bewitches Zhang the Celestial Master's Hand-Seal and Fails; The Bewildered Ghost Wakes up to the Spirit of the Lost Arrow

It is said that those who have dealt with ghosts and spirits in former times have mostly been mocked and deceived by them. Since Zhong Kui relinquished his post, the office remained long vacant, and none dared to assume so grave a charge. Only in the time of the Great Tang did the planet Venus, together with the assembled star-officials, present a memorial to the Jade Emperor, reporting that the number of fierce ghosts in the world had increased, and that they often appeared among the people, troubling the masses. They earnestly requested that a careful inquiry be made, and that a capable person be appointed to take sole charge of the matter of governing spirits. The Jade Emperor approved the memorial, and asked, “Who is fit to undertake this office?” Venus then recounted the previous incidents of failure by various officials, and recommended Zhang the Perfected of Dragon and Tiger Mountain as fit to hold this post. For he was born with a seal upon his hand, which could govern spirits, goblins, and demons. If he were appointed to the office, he would certainly be able to discharge his duties. The Jade Emperor gave assent, and ordered Venus to personally deliver the imperial edict.

Venus came to Dragon and Tiger Mountain, and Zhang the Celestial Master, having received the report from the day-duty official, went forth to meet him at the cave mouth. The guests and host courteously entered, and Venus first read aloud the Jade Emperor’s decree. The Master knelt to receive it. When the reading was finished, they each performed the rites and took their seats, then talked of matters celestial and terrestrial. The Master inquired, “I lately heard that the Great Emperor of Eastern Flower descended to the mortal realm by command—is this so?” Venus replied, “This is indeed true. The Emperor often said, ‘It is better to have an additional divine man in heaven than an additional immortal in the world.’ Also, once before, in the presence of his disciple Zhongli Quan, he spoke a careless word: ‘In the future I will save you as my master.’ This idle speech unexpectedly became a prophecy. The Emperor, hearing that there are too many evil men on earth and that men’s hearts grow daily worse, resolved to select among the stars and immortals those who are talented and virtuous, and deeply accomplished in merit and conduct, to descend to the mortal realm, often manifesting the Dharma-body, to guide the lost and open wide the path of enlightenment; yet such men are rare. It was said that the Emperor wished to descend, but since his disciple Zhongli Quan had not yet attained the Way and could not save him from the world, the ancient promise was delayed. Now Zhongli Quan, having been taught the Profound Classic by Li Xuan, has long attained the Great Way, and is fit to be the Emperor’s saviour of the world. Last year he spoke of this to the Supreme Lord Laozi, who said: ‘The Emperor’s nature is upright, and his conduct graceful, truly the demeanour of an immortal. Since there is an ancient promise, he should descend to the mortal realm and thus show the sage’s words are not idle; also to aid Your Majesty in converting the people and turning from evil to right is indeed a great good deed. Without the Emperor’s virtue and merit, he could not bear such a heavy trust.’ When the Jade Emperor received this memorial, he was greatly pleased. At the time of the Emperor’s entrance to court, he gave special instructions. The Emperor was eager to obey the command and to descend at once. He has now been born in the family of Lü in the River region, named Dongbin. At this time, after parting from the Perfected, he must first visit Mount Hua to notify Zhongli Quan to go early and perform the salvation, lest he be detained long in the mortal dust and suffer great calamity. Should difficulty arise, the Perfected and I will both do our utmost to guide him; this will also be a great merit and fruit.” The Perfected heard and nodded assent. When Venus departed, the Celestial Master summoned the officials of the Mansion—officials of spirits, judges, functionaries, and clerks—and announced the words of the newly received imperial command. From that day forth, within the four seas, all spirits and ghosts were under the Master’s governance. It is said that until the end of the Qing dynasty, there was no change in this arrangement.

Yet there is one small curious matter, long a riddle to the world, to wit: it is said that Zhang the Celestial Master was once bewitched by ghosts. This shows that even one of the Master’s rank and magical power once fell into the same errors as Fei and Zhong. This further proves that the governance of ghosts is truly a difficult matter. From what the author knows, since the Master took charge of the ghosts, a minor disturbance occurred. But the main cause of the trouble was not the Master, but one of his subordinate judges. Such judges were chosen from among those in the Complete Perfection sect who had attained the Way and possessed magical power, and they were ranked as upper, middle, or lower according to their degree of Taoist attainment.

At the end of the Tang dynasty, there was a new judge in the Master’s Mansion, sharing the same surname as the Master, young and handsome, much favoured by him. When he first came, he was only a lower-grade judge. Within half a year, he was promoted to a middle-grade judge. This man was originally the son of a poor family in Jiangxi. In childhood, he followed his parents begging for a living. People saw he was of fair countenance and upright character, and though among beggars, he had the air of a gentleman. Therefore, all took pity on him. Whenever he arrived at a place, before he spoke, people would double their aid to him, by which his parents were sustained. This judge was also filial to his parents, offering the food he begged first to them, then eating the remainder himself. When the weather was very cold, he would arrange for his parents to stay in an old temple, while he alone went out to beg; when he acquired food, he still offered it first to his parents. Later, his father fell ill but there was no money to call a doctor. He wrote a petition setting forth their hardship and begged for aid. The petition was well composed, and people were moved to pity him the more. Within half a day he collected ten taels of silver and joyfully brought it back to the old temple. But his father had not the fortune to enjoy it, and was already at death’s door. The judge was distressed, and cutting a portion of flesh from his own thigh, he first cooked it to give his father as medicine. After one bowl, the illness began to turn. The next morning he went into town and found a doctor whom he knew, hoping to get him to visit the temple so as to avoid more hardship for his dying father. But the father’s time had come and nothing could save him. By the time the doctor was brought, the father was dead.

The judge’s sorrow was beyond words. He wept and wailed as he buried his father, having just used up the ten taels of silver. The mother and son lived by each other’s support, begging from here and there for many days. That year there was famine and poor harvests, and bandits like hair. Those who had any property fled to distant places. The few remaining farmers suffered as much as the judge and his mother. The judge was at a loss, with no begging left and nothing to do. He was young and strong, and could endure hunger, but how could he support the old mother? Returning day by day from begging, seeing her advanced in years and yet suffering such hardships, his heart was like being pierced with a knife. He secretly wept in the street, not daring to let his mother know, lest she be grieved. At that time, poor Zhang the judge had come to the very end of his resources.

But the good deeds of men are known to Heaven, which does not suffer one to perish utterly. Zhang the Great Immortal heard of his plight and took the form of a Taoist, using alchemy to turn stone into gold, giving him fifty taels of silver and teaching him many methods of healing and saving the world. Thereafter, the judge rented a house with this money, practising sorcery to cure diseases, many cases proving effective, and his house soon flourished. After three years, his mother became strong and healthy again. Zhang the Great Immortal came again and said, “The methods I taught you are half for saving the world, half to support your household. But this cannot last long. Better follow me to Dragon and Tiger Mountain. I will recommend you to Zhang the Celestial Master as a judge. How say you?” The judge closed his shop, giving all his savings except what he shared with poor relatives and friends to his mother. He then followed Zhang the Immortal to Dragon and Tiger Mountain, becoming a judge.

This judge was a man of extraordinary talent. Whenever the Master performed rituals, wrote talismans, or chanted incantations, he stood at one side observing attentively, and secretly learned many talismanic arts. One day the Master was invited by a Taoist friend to play chess, and he entrusted the care of the cave to the judge. The judge, finding leisure and having nothing to do, thought to test the spirit-summoning method he had learned. He made talismanic signs with his finger and struck the Master’s golden plaque. In a moment the room was filled with countless ghosts—some with broken feet or arms, some with burnt faces, some with their tongues hanging out, some with eyes staring from their sockets, and many strange and terrifying ghosts, all gathered in disorder. Seeing that the one who summoned them was not Zhang the Master but a stranger, the ghosts were somewhat astonished.

Moreover, as the judge was not entitled to govern them, and felt somewhat resentful, seven or eight of them surrounded him, asking why he had summoned them. The judge was at once terrified and confused, unable to answer. The room was packed with ghosts, and outside the door more ghosts came in troops. Seeing his timidity, the ghosts despised him all the more. Some shouted insults, some mocked coldly, some said they would kill this wild Taoist, some vowed to drag him out and throw him into the dung pit. Others said, “There is a great ritual being held elsewhere. We were just about to enjoy a good meal, but he summoned us with talismans. We came and found no business, so lost a meal for nothing. He must compensate us.” Such a dispute frightened the judge so that he forgot the incantations for banishing ghosts. The ghosts caused greater uproar, lifting him upside down for a long time. Then they put him down, stuffed his mouth with horse dung and cow urine, and tried to drag him out to the dung pit.

Fortunately the Master returned and, seeing the scene, understood at once. He quickly chanted the banishing incantations and drove away the ghosts. The ghosts disputed among themselves, saying the judge should not have played such pranks on them, and must be punished. The Master found it hard to refuse the public will, and soothed them kindly, promising to admonish the judge. Yet the ghosts would not disperse and insisted the Master punish him before them all. The Master grew angry, made hand seals with his left hand, showed the seal in his right, and shouted, “Little ghosts, how dare you thus disobey the agreements! Cease your insolence! When I unite this hand seal with my incantations, I can turn you into blood and water in a moment!”

The Master is like other men, only that Heaven has assigned him the office to govern ghosts and punish demons, and he was born with a seal on his hand. Talismans and incantations have power only when combined with this seal. It is the tradition of the Masters to choose among their sons those born with the seal to succeed to the office, so there is no contest. According to ancient books, those born with writings on the hand are not the same person, but the Master’s birth with a seal is of the same principle. His seal and talismans may warn unlawful immortals, control spirits and monsters; much more should ghosts and spirits fear it. Seeing the Master angry, they feared he would strike, and their ghostly bodies could not endure it; all at once with a whistle they fled clean away.

When the Master came to look at the judge, he was speechless, his body bruised and swollen, and in great pain. The Master, seeing this, both laughed and was angry. Because the judge had suffered greatly, and was usually the Master’s favourite, he could not bear to blame him much, but used talismans to heal his wounds. Then he admonished him: “Talismans are most efficacious and also most terrible. If used improperly, they can slay the user. How much more if they are misused idly, as a game! This only adds guilt. Luckily you only summoned a band of wild ghosts and lost souls. If you had called down the star-gods of Heaven or the spirit officials of this Mansion without proper business, your body would long since have been shattered. Could you then still stand here before me? Once in this Mansion there was a judge named Wang, who, needing paper but having none while attending to nature’s needs, made a hand seal and summoned a duty spirit official to bring paper. He was beaten by the Yellow Spirit Official with a steel whip and hurled down a deep cliff, not a bone of him left. Such things even I cannot save. Do you think that is not fearful?” These words made the judge break out in cold sweat, and for a long while he dared not speak.

Yet these ghosts, though lacking the majesty of divine generals or the rank of spirit officials, were very stubborn. Hearing the Master would not punish the judge, they grew indignant. In the wilderness they held a great assembly of ghosts to punish the judge. Among them was a fox spirit whom the Master had struck dead with the Five Thunders. Because he had many dealings with mortals and drew on their vitality, he remained among the ghosts. Though not human, he was cunning and cruel, full of sly plots. He proposed: “Those who have been our ghost-masters, ghost-officials, and ghost-heads, even such as Fei Changfang and Zhong the Scholar, could not withstand our united disturbance. Now the Master relies only on one seal; talismans are not to be feared without it. We only need to pretend to beg and creep close to him. If he allows us in, and immediately dismisses and severely punishes the judge before all the people, we can say no more and withdraw. But then the Master will take us seriously. If he still stubbornly resists, we will seize the hand with the seal so that he cannot raise it, then gather round and bewilder him with the ghostly maze, leaving him without way out or entrance. Then we shall have him in our power, and he will lose all his prestige and never dare to shout at us with arrogance.”

The ghosts all approved. Some among them thought that when Zhang the Master went out at night, they should rise in troops and block the road, first making gentle requests. The Master, seeing their constant threats, was displeased and scolded them. The ghosts chose some strong and fierce ones, pretending to plead, and crept close. At the sound of the Master’s scolding, the mob sprang up and pressed down his sealed hand. The Master saw the ghosts would not disperse, and, before his attending spirit officials, could not lose face. He was filled with anger, made hand seals, and raised the sealed hand. But it was as heavy as a thousand pounds, and he could not lift it. He knew they had caught his trick, and his mind was panic-stricken and blocked. The workings of the Tao depend on the spirit. When the spirit is blocked, one is like any ordinary man. He opened his eyes and found his attendant spirit officials all vanished. The more he was dismayed, the less he could control himself, and he was driven away by a band of wild ghosts, shouting and laughing.

The Master’s mind was at this point very confused. He saw on the east a sheer cliff, on the west a great body of water. At length he found a path, but after a few steps another barrier blocked his way, nearly bruising his face. Most painful was the sealed hand, extremely heavy, pressed and aching sorely. He heard voices: “Zhang the Perfected, why not surrender?” “Zhang the Celestial Master, abdicate quickly!” Others said, “Do you still dare to be stubborn? Still despise us? Quickly hand over that Zhang!” Such words left the Master unable to perform his magic, unable to answer or refuse. This was the strange scene of Zhang the Celestial Master’s bewitchment said by the world.

The Master, pressed by the ghosts and unable to exercise his power, thought, “I must wait for dawn; when the yang energy is strong, the ghosts will disperse. Then I will deal with them.” But the sealed hand, nearly broken, was most difficult to bear. He sat down and rested that hand on a large stone, hoping the stone’s support would relieve the pressure. But the ghosts, knowing his intent, brought many fierce ghosts to increase the pressure tenfold. The Master’s arm, pressed between stone below and weight above, was almost crushed.

Looking up to Heaven, the Master sighed: “Never did I expect that as Celestial Master, bearing the title of Perfected, I should be so bewitched by ghosts, my life hanging by a thread. O Heaven, why do you not aid me? Why did you set me this task? I care not for my death; but I fear that henceforth none will dare to bear the office of governing ghosts, and even the seat of Celestial Master may be left vacant.” While his sigh was yet unended, a great shout came from the clouds: “How can the Perfected, Celestial Master, know not even the tricks of these petty ghosts who bewilder with walls?” Hearing this, the Master was suddenly awakened and exclaimed, “Ah! I was truly dazed. How could I forget such petty arts?” Struggling to his feet, he pulled down his trousers and urinated a great hot stream, turning about to sprinkle it on all sides. Before he had finished, ghostly cries came from all directions. Suddenly his sight cleared as if a veil were lifted; the sealed hand was lightened and felt as if freed from a heavy burden. The Master looked to the heavens, raised his hands in thanks to the Immortal who had reminded him, and finding the path, walked slowly home.

What punishment the Master dealt to the ghosts thereafter, and who was the Immortal that called out from the clouds? This will be explained in the next chapter.
