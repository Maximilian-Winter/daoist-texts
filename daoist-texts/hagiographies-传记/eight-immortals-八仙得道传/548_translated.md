# Chapter 80: Prophecy Declared, Zhang the Celestial Master Deposed; The Promise Fulfilled, Lü Chunyang is Born

It was previously related how Zhang the Celestial Master was beguiled by ghosts, as explained in the last chapter. The Master, with but a single discharge of urine, dispersed the throng of ghosts. This saying may seem jocose, but in truth it contains profound verity. The Master was born to his office, the seal impressing his hand. His vital spirit was naturally unlike that of ordinary men, much more so as he was a Celestial Master. Though the Master is but a man, he is ever in close converse with immortals, spirits, and demons, and constantly employs spiritual talismans and incantations; thus he cannot but engage in the cultivation of the Way. Therefore his yang energy is stronger and more robust than that of common men. Though his single discharge of urine appears powerless, once it touches a ghostly form, it is as if fire scalds oil, too fierce to endure. This is why the Master could with one urination drive away the host of ghosts. Nowadays, men who travel by night in mountain valleys sometimes find themselves bewildered and benumbed by ghosts who strike the walls or confound their senses, leaving them at a loss what to do. If one’s vital spirit be strong and of a warm, vigorous nature, urine may be used to repel them. But if the body be weak and of cold, yin constitution, then the method of spitting blood must be employed. The source of this blood is best from biting one’s tongue, and spitting forth on all sides; its efficacy equals that of a yang body’s urine. Should the bewildered be female, then regardless of constitution, blood must be used as the cure. Whether these traditions are reliable or not, the author has never seen ghosts in his life, and dares not risk misleading others with ghostly tales. He can but insert this one statement: the matter is hearsay, and responsibility is not assumed. Yet what is said of the Celestial Master is true and credible. If the reader has doubts, he may go to Mount Longhu and investigate; truth and falsehood will then be fully manifest.

Leaving these idle words, let us return to the Master, who after suffering this secret injury, returned to his mansion. Presently, two spiritual officers and attendants who had accompanied him forth came to greet and pay respects. The Master recounted the whole affair to them, withholding not a word. This greatly stirred the anger of officers Wang and Huang, who forthwith drew their steel whips, shouting, ‘The demon things have insulted the Celestial Master! We are no longer in their eyes. Let the Master summon all the ghosts at once, that each may receive a lash. If in future the ghostly winds grow boisterous, and the ghostly forces flourish, will it then be possible to govern them?’ Saying this, they awaited orders with wrathful countenance.

The Master smiled and comforted them: ‘Do I not know how detestable the ghosts are? But thinking that they are ghosts, and mostly unoffered to and neglected, their plight is pitiable and to be pitied. The Judge Zhang was unreasonable and rash in applying the Dao, and deserved his punishment. Though I chastised strictly, it was not the ghosts who saw it. They, hating Judge Zhang deeply, have involved me in their difficulties. The matter is hateful, but the feeling may yet be pardoned. As my person suffered no loss, it is better to show grace and forgive them, which will also display our magnanimity and benevolence. I hope you will let your anger go, open your hearts, and not take this to heart too much.’

Hearing this, the two officers could not but calm their spirits. Officer Wang first sheathed his steel whip and spoke composedly: ‘Though it be so, the Master may show mercy, but the celestial laws permit no lenience. The ghosts are indeed pitiable, yet among them are those who lead and conspire to break the law. These evil ghosts must never be forgiven. If all were let off, not only would they not see the Master’s magnanimity, but suspect that he is timid and fearful. We who neglect our duties and fail the law, if some trifling matters displease them in future, may at any moment muster hostilities, or devise countless ghostly stratagems and secret devices, and never-ending ghostly tricks. There may be things far worse than ghostly walls or ghostly hands pressing down. Though the Master and we possess the Dao and magic, our defences may not suffice. Should a great calamity arise, we will suffer the punishment of heaven’s laws. The Master’s mercy today will become the cause of crime tomorrow. More fearful still, the vast land of the Divine State will see ghosts feeding on men. Men will not overcome ghosts, and men will even learn to become ghosts. What then will become of the world?’ The Master heard this and was moved with a start.

As he pondered his reply, suddenly a crane’s cry sounded in the void, and an immortal descended. The Master hastened, accompanied by the two officers and four celestial attendants, to welcome him. It was none other than Zhang Guo the Great Immortal who had recommended Judge Zhang. Zhang Guo, upon seeing the Master, hurriedly clasped his hands and said, ‘Most shamefully to the Perfected One. Because of the person I recommended, indeed the Perfected One was trapped by demons. Were it not that I chanced to pass by and gave timely warning, the Perfected One would have suffered their torment. How could this not be my fault?’ The Perfected One then knew that the voice which had awakened him from above was Zhang Guo, and expressed thanks without end. They all courteously entered and took their seats.

Zhang Guo first smiled to the two officers and said: ‘Just now in the air I heard your wise words. You say the ghostly forces will become overwhelming, and men will learn to be ghosts. These words are startling, but in truth such a day will come, only after a thousand years. Generally, the two paths of good and evil are distinguished by yin and yang. In the beginning of chaos, all men were formless. Formless men have no craft or deceit; no craft or deceit means they are good men. Descending to later ages, the wind of craft and deceit increases day by day; therefore the ways of the world and the hearts of men grow thinner day by day. When they have reached their thinnest, that is when yang energy is exhausted and yin force is great. The ghostly forces you speak of will then be at their height. Ghosts belong to utmost yin; the difference between men and ghosts is but a trace of yang energy. When men lose all yang energy, what difference is there between them and ghosts? It is not that ghosts subdue men, nor that ghosts seek men to become ghosts. But then ghosts will remain ghosts, and men will be of the same kind as ghosts. Thus all the affairs of the world will be base, sordid, treacherous, and deceitful in nature. In office men care not for the public good but only for bribes, which are openly taken; the night need not be dark for this. This is the way ghosts seize their share of food and drink. Among the common people, filial piety may be abolished, and licentiousness promoted. All seek their own gain, caring not for shame or propriety. Like ghostly beings without heart, they recklessly cause mischief, with no regard for the difficulty of men. Such ghostly hearts and minds, plots and schemes, will surely be passed on to the living. Thus men and ghosts will be no different, and the vast universe will indeed become a world of ghosts — but this is all to come. From my humble point of view, this is about a thousand five hundred years from now. To speak of it now is premature.’

The Master laughed and said, ‘An old friend from afar, it seems, has come to vent his grievances.’ This one phrase caused Zhang Guo to laugh also. He added, ‘Though you hear these words today and may say I overstate, this is no jest; indeed such a day will surely come. The way of Heaven and Earth is nothing but yin and yang. When yang flourishes, yin wanes; when yin flourishes, yang ceases. The ancients said that the world’s life is long, and that order and disorder alternate — this is the principle. In reality, first there is sword and spear, life and death, wide and far battle, named great disorder; yet this is not true disorder. For such disorder disturbs only affairs. Though affairs be disturbed, men remain men. Only when men’s hearts all die, and men become ghosts, is there true great disorder. The common saying, “Men’s hearts deceive, Heaven’s way reverses,” is just a comment on disorder. Such true great disorder corresponds to the age of formless men in chaos; then formless men represent perfect yang government, and the ghost realm perfect yin government. Thus from yang to yin gradually, many thousands or tens of thousands of years may pass. At the peak of great disorder, the final result is a mingling into one. But this mingling differs absolutely from ancient chaos. One is yang at its extreme, with governance peaceful and majestic, bustling without distinctions of self and other, full of ineffable joy. The other is yin at its extreme, with disorder topsy-turvy, confused, without distinction, a smoke and mist that cannot be described. When men’s hearts reach this state, it may be called utmost disorder. Disorder lies in the heart, not the affairs. It is fundamental disorder, not small local disturbances. Only when combined with the ancient era of formless men can it be called order and disorder. From then on, Heaven and Earth must reunite. Another period of opening and transformation will occur, returning to the era of formless men, as a new beginning of governance. Such is the way of Heaven, beyond all control. Though there be great sages and holy ones, like the Jade Emperor, the Lord of Primordial Beginning, the Queen Mother, the Buddha of the West, and Eastern Shuo, they cannot reverse this change.’

The Master and the officers sighed deeply on hearing this. The Master added, ‘When that time comes, we descendants know not how matters will stand.’ Zhang Guo laughed and said, ‘Here is a matter of difficulty, duration, and ease. Perfected One, do not be angry. I may prophesy briefly thus: should the Perfected One be born and attain the Dao, and be ennobled as Celestial Master, his blessings will be great, but so too will be his sufferings. As for me, a humble Taoist who began as a mere animal and attained my present place — though lowly, it was no easy gain. In the ghost world I remain a minor immortal of low rank. But the Celestial Master’s descendants will inevitably suffer losses, and even the title of Celestial Master is destined then to end; if restored, it must be after the second opening and transformation.’

The Perfected One heard this with some displeasure in his heart. Yet as a man of cultivation, he could not show it, but laughed heartily, saying, ‘As you say, even the Jade Emperor and the Buddha and other holy ancestors cannot reverse fate; how much less we? Besides, matters so far ahead, fifteen hundred years hence, concern us little. It is fortunate that by then your virtue and fame will have accumulated deeply. With you high in the Heavenly Palace, my descendants will not lack care. Foregoing the title of Celestial Master, and losing this seal of office, what matters is there?’ Having said this, he laughed again.

Zhang Guo, fearing he had spoken too freely, hastened to divert the talk. Gradually he came back to Judge Zhang. The Celestial Master called Zhang the Judge forth. Zhang the Judge, seeing Zhang Guo, was full of remorse. Zhang Guo smiled and said, ‘Young men often act without regard to gains and losses, not knowing when to advance or retreat. Most men are thus, not only you. But my coming today is especially to settle this grave matter. First, as the spiritual officers say, the Master can be merciful, but the heavenly officers cannot be lax. At least those leading the ghosts must be punished.’

Here he drew forth a list and handed it to the Master, saying, ‘I have investigated this matter for the Master. These few evil ghosts are the ringleaders and chief conspirators. If not punished, the ghost realm will not be peaceful. Secondly, concerning the affairs of Judge Zhang. Though not a great uproar, it is no trifle. But he was only playful for a time, and used his learning to make small experiments to aid the Master in future. There is no ill intent in him. Therefore his matter may yet be pardoned somewhat. But now he cannot remain here. If he did, it would show the Master to be too lenient, and make it hard to command respect. Also, among ghosts there are many incomprehensible things. After the Master punishes the ringleaders, their hatred towards you will deepen. How can you resist them without ability? Better to leave here and return home to care for your mother. When your mother dies, seek some noted mountain cave as a place of retirement. If you apply yourself diligently, you may yet hope to become an earth immortal.’

Judge Zhang thanked the Master. Then, following Zhang Guo, he bade farewell to the Master and his colleagues. Zhang Guo mounted the clouds and took him back to his native place to see his mother. Before leaving, Zhang Guo gave him a piece of silver as capital, bidding him to labour and earn his living, to help others when he may, thus increasing his merit and foundation. ‘I tell you,’ said he, ‘your former life was as a disciple of Immortal Zhongli before he attained the Dao, whom he took in from the mountains and named Mountain Moonchild. Later, the Immortal was rebuked by his own master, the Emperor Donghua, who said he had not yet attained the Dao and should not take disciples. Therefore he dared not seek you again. But immortals do not speak in jest; having permitted your nurture and benefited from you, unless you do evil, he will not forsake you, but will strive to accomplish your advancement. After attaining the Dao, he sent you to the Underworld Office to be reborn here, to test your character. Since you know filial piety and are loyal and kind, he was confident to promote you to fulfill your ancient wish. Now, because the Emperor Donghua will soon descend to earth and choose you as disciple, he has incarnated as your teacher to instruct you at all times and places. Being unable to be present in person, he has entrusted me to manage your affairs. Your mother is ill, and her yang life is but a short span. As you leave the Master’s mansion, you may stay home to care for your mother, fulfilling your human duty. When she dies, you may go to White Wind Rock under Mount Wudang in Fujian for cultivation. When opportunity comes, I will return to instruct your practice.’ Having said this, he raised his sleeve and vanished. Judge Zhang quickly knelt in farewell.

From then on, he followed orders, chose a wife and auspicious days, explained fate and fortune, earning money to support his mother, while beginning his practice of nourishing qi. After five years, his mother died, and he left home for Mount Wudang in Fujian. There was indeed a White Wind Rock with a cave beneath, where he practiced. Fifty years later, Zhang Guo personally inspected his progress and taught him many Daoist arts. Three hundred years later, he became an earth immortal. This is a later tale, to be told another time.

Now again we turn to Zhongli Quan in the house of Lü Dongbin, to whom he had taught for five years. This was after the reign of the Empress Wu in the Tang dynasty, when the family had been officials for generations. Naturally, Lü’s parents hoped their son would continue the official career. Yet Lü was of a different nature. For all the complex, profound classical learning, whenever it passed before his eyes, he found it shallow and coarse, unworthy of reading. His father was vexed and tested him before his teacher. Yet Lü remembered all he read, word for word. At eight years old, he could compose essays and poems, rough yet wonderful, and even his father could not but admire him. He even sought the hardest problems in ancient books to test him, and Lü answered promptly, expounding many principles not previously set forth, proving himself a comrade of the ancients.

His father was at a loss to confound him, nodding with a sigh: ‘Truly a steed from our thousand li home. But a mere boy, who lightly disparages the ancients’ books, is somewhat arrogant. Does he not know that besides the sages’ classics, what other books are there to read?’ Lü answered: ‘The learning of Confucius is the way of the world, plain and close to human feeling, to serve as a model to men. If all were so, the world might be temporarily peaceful, but not permanently ordered. The transcendent truths lie in the Laozi’s Dao De Jing, which if all studied, would bring eternal order and no disorder. This truth should command our hearts, but modern men neglect it and call it heresy. There are also many profound doctrines and authentic Daoist arts, the highest learning for men. Yet those who style themselves enlightened despise these and do not speak of them. This is the reason the great Way does not prosper, and the world remains ever troubled.’ These words both surprised and vexed his father.

What happened next is unknown; we shall see in the next chapter.
