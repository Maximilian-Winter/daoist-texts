# Chapter 81: Lüzu's Lofty Discourse Startles His Aged Father; Zhongxian's Verses Warn the Worthy Disciples

It is related that Lü Dongbin spoke to his father with a lofty discourse concerning the transcendence from the world, so that his father was struck dumb and staring. He forthwith exclaimed, "You, a mere stripling with but slight knowledge, recall only a few ancient sayings of the sages; how dare you, not a sage yourself, slander the Way, and rashly compose strange theories! Our China, the Middle Kingdom, has always been governed by the doctrines of Yao, Shun, Wen, Wu, Zhou, and Confucius, handed down for thousands of years without substitution. In the hands of our present dynasty, every sage sovereign has devoted himself to the exaltation of righteousness and the banishment of evil. Many a learned Confucian, well versed in letters, would not dare utter a word of dissent; and you, a mere child, what great insight can you have, that you dare utter such lawless and outrageous words?" Saying this, he made a respectful salutation to the Master, and added, "This foolish dog thus makes a disturbance; I pray you, kind Sir, to condescend to correct him, to lead him aright; if thereby the sons of humble families do not forsake the fragrance of the books, and perpetuate ancestral occupations, your humble servant will be forever grateful." Having spoken, he strode angrily indoors and departed.

Zhongli Quan laughed and said to Dongbin, "Because of your few wild words, I too have drawn an unpleasant consequence." Dongbin, upon hearing this, straightened his body and opened his eyes wide, saying, "Master, do not speak thus. Your disciple, having received your instructions, already knows that within heaven and earth, and beyond heaven and earth, there is only this one Way. Outside the Way there is no other way; within the Way there is no other way. Though young, your disciple already knows the path to save the world, and it is only this Way. Were Heaven not to give me birth, so be it; but having born me, I swear to lead all living creatures into the Great Way. Should there be one who does not attain the Way, I will not alone enter it. I also firmly believe in the teachings of Confucius concerning the Five Bonds and the principles of filial piety. Though my father does not permit me to cultivate the Way, I will gradually move and persuade him to enter the Way. Moreover, I privately believe that to admonish the world and save men, one must begin with one's kin, extending from the near to the far. If even one's own flesh and blood are not convinced, how can one hope to move others? Master, your disciple's work of saving the world must begin at home. Now, my father's wish is that I study, gain fame, pass the middle and highest examinations, hold high office, beget sons and daughters, and continue the ancestral incense. To move him, I shall in all things first obey his commands, and show him by example, to win his favor, that I may turn his heart back. Master, what do you think of my plan?"

Zhongli Quan, upon hearing this, highly praised him, saying, "Though the Three Teachings differ in their outward paths, their principles are one. The Confucian instructs men, placing greatest weight on loyalty and filial piety. Since we are to cultivate the Way, we especially should keep loyalty and filial piety ever in our hearts; if you can, as you say, fulfill the duties of life, then retire to the mountains to cultivate yourself, that is the best of all. But I fear that when worldly affairs become heavy, thoughts of the Way will be lightened; then not only will the grand vow to universally save all living beings be difficult to accomplish, but you yourself will rot with the grass and trees, producing no fruit at all; is not this fearful?" Dongbin laughed and said, "Master, you think too lightly of your disciple. Before I was born, my mother twice dreamed of heavenly portents, that many celestial officials, in full procession, escorted me to be born. When I was born, the room was filled with fragrance, and outside the courtyard one heard celestial music floating on the air; it lasted some time before it ceased. Therefore my father often said that I must be a person of destiny. This is not so strange; but most strange of all is that I often dream of a star official with white hair and beard, calling himself Li Chang-geng. I have long heard that in the Jade Emperor's court there is a Grand Star Lord, named Li Chang-geng, which is probably this very one. In my dreams he often instructs me in many of the mysteries of the Daoist gate, and bids me always remember: 'Better one immortal in heaven than one saint on earth.' He further said these two phrases were spoken by myself. In dreams I seem to remember having said these words, but when or to whom I spoke, I cannot recall. Upon waking my spirit chamber is very clear, and I often imprint these two sentences upon my heart; thus I have the great vow to save all living men. Master, my words are not spoken in a moment of excitement or at random; I always bear this thought in my mind."

Zhongli Quan laughed and said, "Since this is so, do you remember from where you first saw me?" Dongbin laughed and said, "That I do not quite remember. But I have already told you, Master, that upon first seeing you, it was as if we were greatly familiar. It seems these things are matters of former lives." Zhongli Quan, upon hearing this, twirled his beard and laughed heartily. When his laughter ceased, he nodded gently, but said no more. Dongbin paid little heed, and proceeded, "Though I say these things, in my heart I yet bear a great matter." Zhongli Quan nodded and laughed, "I know it, I know it. But it is of no great consequence." Dongbin asked in surprise, "Master, can you guess my thoughts?" Zhongli Quan laughed, "I suppose your zeal to cultivate the Way is great, and to save all men you must first move your parents. The fame and wealth you desire are yours for the choosing; in ten years you can accomplish all. Only begetting sons and daughters cannot be avoided; you fear that this will break your spiritual body, hindering your cultivation. Is not this your worry? Know that your body is pure yang; though you break the precepts of chastity, the vital spirit alone may conceive sons and daughters, without disturbing the essence of your blood. This is because your root is thick, and your yang vigorous; this is your great advantage. For others, breaking the precepts means a delay of a thousand years in cultivation, or even the loss of all merit, making them no different from ordinary men. This is the first danger indeed!"

Dongbin, hearing this, was greatly pleased, saying, "What I feared is this very matter; now, receiving your instruction, this worry is removed. Yet, Master, I would ask whether you are man or immortal, that you know so many things about me? Moreover, you teach the profound Way daily; though I am ignorant, I know such mysteries are not to be revealed by any but a Great Luo Golden Immortal, or one with a thousand years’ merit. It is clear that you are no common man. I also recall when you first came to my house, many strange circumstances occurred; even now my family often speak of them as wonders."

Before he could finish, Zhongli Quan laughed and asked, "What do they say of me?" Dongbin laughed and said, "They say when you first came, you yourself sought audience with my father. My father, seeing you clad in tatters, thought you came to seek aid. At first he wished not to see you; but later, peering secretly, he saw your eyes radiant, your countenance full of pure qi, and said you were no seeker of help, and hastened to receive you with courtesy. When he heard your learned words and clear eloquence, a few sentences so astonished him that he was utterly subdued. He then respectfully asked your purpose. You gravely said you came to take me as your disciple. At that time my father, troubled by my cleverness and mischievousness, was sorely seeking a good teacher; since one so talented as you offered himself, how could he be displeased? Yet he retains some doubts, for many years have passed, and you have never disclosed your place of origin or your family; no one knows whence you came, what you have done; you have never returned home nor written letters; nor have any friends called on you. This is their cause for suspicion."

Hearing this, Zhongli Quan laughed heartily. Dongbin continued, "Indeed I am but five years old. My father has said from my birth I have been especially wise. At four years I had completed the Classics and Histories; at five, I terrified two teachers, who left ashamed. Now, having the honour of your instruction, Master, matters are exceedingly good; yet I fear my talents may make me look down upon you—therefore I first implore to pay respects to you. But upon seeing you, as if Heaven had sent a good master, I could not but be filled with joy and submission. Before instruction, my heart was already won. So I said, 'This is truly my Master!'” Zhongli Quan nodded and said, "Perhaps this is some prior affinity between us." Lü Dongbin eagerly said, "Master, our affinity is indeed ancient, but I think you must be a celestial immortal, perhaps appointed in a previous life to descend and instruct me, to lead me into the gate of the Way. Master, now at leisure, might you relate to me the matters of that former life?"

Upon hearing this, Zhongli Quan’s countenance changed, and he shouted, "How can there be immortals in the world of men? How could immortals descend to the mortal realm to teach men? You child, you talk nonsense! No wonder your father calls you arrogant!" Lü Dongbin, not afraid of the rebuke, laughed and said, "Master, you jest to tease me. I knew you were a celestial immortal; if you say immortals cannot descend, how then are there many true traces of immortals in the world? Usually the true men do not reveal themselves lightly; if revealed, trouble follows. So they conceal themselves deeply. Since you will not admit it, I dare not presume to fathom your depths. At any rate, when the time comes, you will reveal it to me." So saying, he ceased inquiry and returned to his place of study.

Lü Dongbin, gifted and well instructed by a famous teacher, naturally became a peerless talent. At this time, it was the era of Tang’s Zhenguan reign. At twelve years of age, Lü Dongbin went with friends and family to the imperial examination. With one attempt he succeeded, taking first place among the Jinshi, and was called the Little Talent of Hezhong. At once the great families with daughters all wished to take him as son-in-law. Lü Dongbin, following his Master’s teaching and parents’ wishes, at fifteen married the daughter of the prefect of his district. Their conjugal affection was most sincere. After two years, a son was born. Dongbin also by his talents was appointed to office; for over ten years he served, with Zhongli Quan ever beside him.

One day, the Master, disciples, and father were drinking wine in the yamen, idly speaking of politics and the people’s livelihood. Suddenly an officer came in with congratulations, bringing news of promotion. The father and son showed joy, but Zhongli Quan alone smiled faintly, made no sound, and did not congratulate. Lü Dongbin’s father said, "Sir, a lofty scholar, should not be concerned with fame and fortune. My son is but barely grown; his career is too smooth. Men who succeed too early often become arrogant. Arrogance hinders progress; presumption invites contempt. Many envy him, but I fear it will not bring him good fortune. Only your continuous care and oversight have kept him safe; Lü family is fortunate." Hearing this, Zhongli Quan laughed heartily, looking up to heaven, and said, "How can any in the world be entangled with fame and profit and yet advance in the Way? The old man only fears his arrogance is no blessing, and speaks but lightly!" These words made father and son silent.

Zhongli Quan rose, staggering as he left the seat; after a few steps he murmured a verse:

"Instructing the Way, true immortals are rare to meet;  
When shall I return and follow thee complete?  
He says his dwelling is by the boundless sea,  
A different peak of Penglai’s highest tree."

He then chanted another:

"Do not tire of laughter and frequent joy,  
Easy to think of parting and confusion’s ploy.  
Idle, counting fingers from the start,  
How many find true peace in heart?"

Having finished, he laughed loudly, saying, "Amazing! Today I am drunk by the worthy Qiaozi. Excuse me." Saying this, he hastened away. Lü Dongbin and his father wondered at his strange words and manner, and thought him truly drunk. Lü Dongbin, who respected his Master most, seeing him thus, hurriedly informed his father and followed after him to Zhongli Quan’s chamber. The Master muttered to himself as he walked, and upon entering immediately vomited in disorder, the stench grievous. He paid no heed to those following, but went straight to bed and lay down in his clothes. Lü Dongbin, fearing he might catch cold, tried to cover him with a quilt, softly calling, "Master, please sleep well; to lie thus will bring cold." Zhongli Quan opened his heavy drunken eyes and chuckled, "One drunkenness in life is as ascending the heavenly palace. Can thy disciple journey with me to the heavens?" Dongbin laughed, "Master, you jest. How can this mortal body ascend to the heavenly court? Were it possible, I would seek it eagerly, and not refuse." Zhongli Quan loudly said, "Nonsense! Born in heaven, yet burrowing into hell; and you say you would ascend?" Then laughing heartily, he shook his head, "This circle is fearful! This circle is fearful!" So saying, he fell into a deep snore and dream.

Since his examination, Lü Dongbin’s fame was smooth and daily he engaged in vexing affairs. Though in his prime and with great talent, whether unjust cases or difficulties, once in his hands all were swiftly and properly resolved. His reputation grew daily. He himself began to find pleasure in these things, and was much absorbed in fame. Madam He was of admirable talent and beauty; since his service she had also bought two concubines, both elegant and wise. Lü Dongbin could not but show affection, often praising to his Master the virtue and beauty of his wife and concubines. Zhongli Quan merely smiled and nodded, neither dissuading nor speaking discouraging words. Yet thereafter, whenever Lü Dongbin spoke to him, he refused to discourse deeply, only uttering a few words to spare his face. Sometimes Lü Dongbin, moved, would say, "Master, do you doubt my worth? Having entered office, have I forgotten my true nature, that you abandon me as if I were lost?" Zhongli Quan laughed, "No, no! Cultivation is not in many words; the Way values non-action. When you begin to explain, it is no longer the true Way. What kind of discourse would please you?" Lü Dongbin dared say no more, yet in his heart was ever vigilant against carelessness, fearing to be swayed by worldly allurements. Yet, unaware, desire subtly influences men. Given Dongbin’s root and wisdom, and high aspiration, with the guidance and supervision of his immortal Master daily, by all reason he should advance smoothly on the Great Way. Yet though this be reason, actual fact may differ. Even Lü Chunyang of that time showed some signs of being gradually confused by worldly affairs. Zhongli Quan, being his Master, and formerly his disciple, bore the responsibility for Dongbin’s cultivation alone, and could not cast it off lightly. He sought opportunity to enlighten him, and to advise him to abandon office and return to the forest, to sever all lusts, thereby to attain the supreme Way, and fulfill their two-lives’ pledge. Thus on this day’s banquet, feigning drunkenness and retiring to his chamber, he provoked Dongbin to come and inquire, and under the guise of drunkenness he first cast subtle rebukes.

Sure enough, Dongbin, being of the thickest root, felt as if struck by a rod, and as if awakened from a dream by the midnight bell. Staring blankly at his Master asleep, snoring harshly, smelling strongly of wine and vomit, he was unmoved. Despite the stench that would make any man recoil, Dongbin, as a young gentleman and official, seemed deaf and blind, and showed no sign of discomfort. He stood with hands respectfully raised by the bedside, neither moving away nor calling, standing thus for over three hours. Many servants passed in and out, seeing the young lord dazed by the bedside of the Master, felt amazement but dared not ask.

Among them was an old steward, the chief of the Lü household servants, who could speak freely before the old lord, and wielded considerable power in the young master’s presence. Receiving reports, he feared some secret concern affecting the young master’s future. Acting on conscience, he resolved to uncover the matter. He feared the young master might suffer from standing too long, unable to attend to official duties. He knew well the Master loved the young master more than his own parents. Why again this affectation, exhausting the Master so devotedly? If indeed the young master had caused grievance to the Master, the steward must apologize on his behalf. With these three thoughts, he resolutely entered, and quietly pulled the youth’s robe, startling him awake as from a dream, who hurriedly asked, "Who is so rude?" Seeing the steward, he quickly saluted and asked, "What brings you, old sir?" The steward quietly conveyed his suspicions, and Dongbin was left without answer.

Indeed his conduct invited suspicion; yet he had done no wrong to his Master, nor sought anything of him. To sum, he had some very weighty matter in mind, awaiting the Master’s awakening to instruct him. But such matters were not expressed in a few words or brief time; perhaps the main issue could not be told to the steward. Upon questioning, he could only smile and say, "Old sir, do not guess wildly. I wish to consult the Master on some learning; seeing him drunk and asleep, I dare not disturb him. I plan to stand by his bedside, that when he awakes he may know my sincerity and surely guide me. I did not mean to trouble you. Since you have come, it is well. Pray bid the servants set up a bed here. I desire to discuss some scholarly matters with the Master. Also, if the old lord, the matron, or Madam ask about me, do not tell them of this scene, lest all worry over me." Hearing this, the steward was comforted, nodded, and said, "I understand, young master. You should soon retire and pay respects to the old lord, the matron, and Madam." Dongbin agreed. The steward left cheerfully. Meanwhile the servants had cleaned the Master’s vomit and set a bed; all was prepared. Dongbin ordered them out, to enter only if summoned.

When Dongbin again looked upon the Master, his snoring was deeper, and sleep profound. Calling softly, no response. Dongbin sighed, "Master is truly a true immortal; how could he be drunk at once, so drunk as to be insensible and sleep so deeply? Surely he loves me deeply and hopes for me. Probably seeing me lately too close to wife and concubines, fearing I be ensnared by lust and hinder my cultivation, he feigns deep sleep to test my sincerity, then will instruct me with right words. If I slight him, he will deem me unworthy, and leave. Whence shall I find such a Master again?"

So thinking, he once more stood reverently by the bed. Seeing night late, the steward brought supper to the chamber. Dongbin ate alone in haste, then resumed his usual duties, looking at Zhongli Quan who had turned inward, breathing deeply, without sign of waking. Resolving not to neglect, he still stood with hands raised. After an hour or so, when Dongbin should have slept, the steward, fearing his overexertion and noting the Master’s deep sleep, suspected the young master’s words untrue, that some other cause existed. Thus he entered again, urging Dongbin to rest.

The master and servant argued when Zhongli Quan turned over, crying loudly, "Alas, alas, once I go down, there is no life." Before the words ended, Dongbin was struck with cold sweat.

Why Zhongli Quan uttered these startling words, we shall see in the next chapter.
