# Chapter 84: Entrusted by a Friend, Chang'e Sends the Blue Bird; Under Imperial Mandate, the Star Lord Oversees the Colonization of the Moon

It is recorded that when Lü Dongbin first took up the Way, he was bestowed by Zhongli Quan with the Hunyuan Bagua Taoist robe, which he donned upon his person. This robe was originally proof against water and fire, and unfearing of swords and spears. Yet, by chance, the very first adversary he encountered was Erlang Shen’s Howling Celestial Dog. This dog was no ordinary beast; from ancient times it had diligently cultivated and laboured, and though it had not attained the immortal Way, it had become a body impervious to ten thousand calamities. Its teeth, having undergone a thousand grindings and temperings, had earned great merits alongside its master, slaying many demons and spirits. Naturally, the force of its bite was more than tenfold mightier than common swords, spears, water, or fire. Moreover, at that moment Lü Dongbin’s mind was singularly fixed on goodness, harbouring only the thought of saving it; how could he guard against it as it circled him in a drawing, when he was already dizzy and confused, and his heart filled with hatred for his foe? The dog could not imagine that the unfolding of the drawing was meant to save its life; it only thought that those of that sect were all its enemies, and how could there be a saviour emerging so inexplicably? Therefore, taking advantage of the momentum of the drawing’s unfolding, it neither questioned how the drawing could be opened, nor cared who held it. For the sake of revenge, and to save its own life, it was compelled to bite at him with all its might. As narrated above, Lü Dongbin’s Taoist robe could withstand ordinary water, fire, swords, and spears, but could not resist the teeth of this Howling Celestial Dog. Unwittingly, the dog’s sudden bite caught him on the calf; naturally he could not endure the pain, uttered a loud cry, and fell senseless to the ground. This was the very scene that gave rise to the common saying, ‘The dog bites Lü Dongbin, and knows not the heart of a good man.’

This tale has been handed down for a thousand years, yet none know its origin. There have been men with keen minds and lofty thoughts who have criticized the story as baseless, reasoning that Lü Dongbin is a golden immortal of the heavens, the most ambitious among immortals, and most willing to relieve the sufferings of men; that the dog must be most unworthy, and how could it bite such a man? Even if there were an unreasonable wild dog, would Lü Dongbin be one to fear its bite? Therefore, they regard the story as a later distortion, a falsehood without foundation. Such reasoning is by no means without merit; but, alas, these gentlemen know only how to argue and not how to investigate the origins of the matter. Thus they come to no good result. This cannot truly be blamed upon them.

Putting aside such words, again: Lü Dongbin’s Taoist robe was no match for the teeth of the Howling Celestial Dog; therefore, when bitten, he fell unconscious. The reason is that at this time he was still a flesh-and-blood body, and how could he endure pains that beasts could not? Yet, for all the fierceness of the dog, many demons had perished beneath its teeth; Lü Dongbin alone was injured and fell, but preserved his life; this must be credited to the protection afforded by the Taoist robe. Presently the Howling Celestial Dog broke free from the drawing and fled. Thereupon Monk Zhiyuan and Mr. Wang, the gentleman of the household, and his wife arose and rescued Lü Dongbin. Zhiyuan took great offence with Lü Dongbin, saying: ‘You have developed a madness of the mind. We had barely succeeded in restraining that evil dog, imprisoning it in the drawing with no further trouble. Yet through your release, its resentment grows deeper. If it returns tomorrow to seek mischief, I will not have the leisure to guard against it again. This disaster you have brought upon us, and you must take care of it. As for your wounds, they are your own doing, and no blame attaches to others.’ Having said this, he went away in a huff.

At this time Lü Dongbin was in pain and remorse, and reproached by him thus, felt speechless. Meanwhile, Mr. Wang and his wife sighed in turn, fearing that the dog-spirit would return and that the lives of the whole family would truly be at the mercy of its jaws. Upon hearing this, Lü Dongbin felt more distressed than from the dog’s bite. He forced a calm countenance and said to Mr. Wang: ‘Please rest assured, sir; since this dog was released by me, I shall contrive to drive it away and make it dare never again approach this place. If this matter is not settled today, I vow to remain in the mansion forever and fight it to the death.’

Before he could finish, Zhiyuan sneered and said: ‘Very well! Had I known you possessed such cleverness, why did Mr. Wang have to come so far and hire me? Now there is this great immortal to settle your household and guard your halls; I fancy there will be no demons or spirits daring to seek trouble here. As for a mere dog, my efforts have been ineffective, and my magic limited; I cannot continually struggle against beasts. Pardon me, but I must take my leave.’ Having said this, he went out in anger. Mr. Wang stopped him repeatedly, saying: ‘Master, you have come from afar and had great toil; the day is late, and the third drum is about to sound. Tonight you must stay, and tomorrow morning you may return.’ Hearing this, Zhiyuan consented and stayed the night.

The next morning as he was about to go out, suddenly another monk arrived, colliding with him. Zhiyuan saw it was the temple’s own monk Zhijue, and stood still to ask the reason for his coming. Zhijue drew him back, smiling, saying: ‘Master, I knew yesterday you could not subdue the demon or capture the spirit.’ Before he could finish, Zhiyuan sprang up, exclaiming: ‘What talk is this? How many places have we gone, how many demons subdued? How can a mere dog be our match? Could it be we have failed at its hand?’ Then pointing to Lü Dongbin said: ‘You ask him. I know not whence this wild Taoist comes, what skill he possesses; yet our Master actually believes him so much as to take him as a disciple of the Chan sect. Hmph! A man like him is fit only to drift in his own Taoist school, deceiving others for food and clothing. If he really came into the Chan sect, ha ha, our monks’ reputation would be lost altogether.’

Zhijue saw him so angry, yet also saw Lü Dongbin sitting composed, showing no shame nor disputing. He nodded and smiled: ‘Brother Zhiyuan, no need to be impatient. Our Master does not say your skill is wanting; the failure to subdue the demon is due to predestined number. This dog was not destined to die at your hand. Moreover, it must not die, and cannot be killed by any man. How then did he command you to come? Why did you disregard this and seek to slay it? What reason is there in this?’ Zhiyuan was put to silence and stood dazed. Zhijue laughed and said: ‘Our Master’s acts are never at fault. He foresaw your fiery temper and the magic treasure in your hand; the power is plainly yours, life and death at your convenience, yet you would not lightly spare it. As for this Lü Daoist, you may not know his origin; it is needless to speak further. Suffice it to say that when trouble comes, immortals and spirits will help him. You should entrust this matter to him, and see if he will not save you from shame.’

Hearing this, Zhiyuan was displeased: ‘If that be so, the old monk should have sent him forth long ago. Now all is quiet, why should we meddle in such trifles? And to trouble your presence to come so far, is it not needless?’ Zhijue laughed again: ‘Do not act so hot-headed. Have you not heard our Master’s teaching on two truths of predestined fate? Men have fixed affinities, events have fixed numbers; even Heaven cannot alter them, how much less man? Frankly, our Master sent you because the treasure is in your hand. In the past when subduing the Bull Demon and capturing the Snake Spirit, it was you alone who did it, far more expert than we. That is one reason. Also, this Lü Daoist, our Master says his future is boundless; at present he has no magic, and is surely no match for this dog. So he sent you, and also him. That is the reason.’

Zhiyuan’s face brightened at Zhijue’s words, and his countenance became more peaceful. He smiled and said: ‘If the Old Gentleman has so great a mind, I will not resist his scheme.’ Zhijue added: ‘There is more to say, but do not interrupt. Our Master foresaw your character; with great power you are unwilling to spare. So he sent Lü Daoist to come, to be a relief force for this dog.’ Zhiyuan could not help but laugh and murmur: ‘Relief force, relief force — only to have the dog bite Dongbin.’ This made all laugh aloud. Zhijue smiled: ‘Do not say so; all things are foreseen by our Master. Lü Daoist must save the dog-spirit, and the dog-spirit must bite Lü Daoist; this too was foreseen. If you do not believe, come and see what this is.’ All looked at a small white pill in his hand, saying: ‘Lü Daoist, come; this is the medicine our Master has prepared for your wound. He says, if that bite had hit another, life would have been ended long since; but as it is you, and with this protective robe, only the leg was hurt. Though you suffer pain, be glad the robe was not broken.’ Hearing this, all took notice and marvelled, for the robe covered the lower leg, and the dog’s teeth plainly passed through the robe to bite the flesh; though the flesh was wounded, the robe was unscathed. Truly it was a treasure of heaven and earth. Zhiyuan praised it vehemently.

Lü Dongbin thanked the old monk and then expressed his gratitude to Zhijue. Zhijue dissolved the pill and applied it to the wound. In a moment, skin and flesh were as new, and the pain vanished. Zhijue smiled and said: ‘Lü Daoist, the matter is predestined. This dog-spirit should be driven off by your hand; interference by others is of no avail. Our Master knew Brother Zhiyuan would not spare lightly, and purposely explained in your presence why the dog should not die. Since you knew the dog belongs to Erlang Shen, your senior in the Way, you harboured a saving heart; at the Master’s word you dared save it. Because you once mistakenly killed a dog in your youth, you cherish a great vow to save all beings, and cannot bear that an innocent creature should suffer wrong on your account. Now, this bite of the Howling Celestial Dog vents the resentment of that wronged dog. Our Master’s saying that he has helped you to settle a karmic case refers to this.’

Lü Dongbin considered this and indeed recalled that when he was three years old, he had been wandering with a group of brothers in the fields playing a stone-throwing game. Being weak, a stone he cast struck a sleeping dog’s eye. The dog, roused by pain, was half-blinded; it rolled and fell into a nearby river and drowned. At the time, efforts were made to save it, but the children were at most six or seven years old, and could do nothing. Though young, Lü Dongbin knew this weighed on his conscience; as he grew older, he remembered and felt troubled. Now, enlightened by the old monk’s words, he was suddenly clear.

Zhijue added: ‘Our Master says, in the future when you reach the foot of the City God Mountain at Hangzhou, there will be a scabby little dog who, having been saved by you and ascended to heaven, is the dog you wronged. Keep this in mind.’ Lü Dongbin heard and again bowed to the heavens in gratitude for the old monk’s grace. He then related how, upon taking up the Way, Zhongli Quan had warned him of troubles by speech; he had thought it a matter of verbal disputes or quarrels with others, but had not imagined it would be within the mouth of the dog-spirit.

All heard this tale of cause and effect and sighed deeply, each resolved not to harm others. Zhijue finished speaking and smiled at Zhiyuan: ‘Our Master bids me invite you to return to the temple with me; there is no need to linger here. With Lü Daoist alone, the matter can be concluded.’ Zhiyuan said: ‘Did we not just say Lü Daoist has no merit and cannot resist this beast?’ Zhijue smiled: ‘Good men have Heaven’s protection; why trouble yourself with such matters? Go, go, no more words.’

Zhiyuan seemed reluctant to return, hesitating and saying: ‘If good men have Heaven’s protection and Lü Daoist alone suffices, why must we attend to this matter?’ Zhijue spat and said: ‘You, a high monk of the Buddhist school, should know such simple truths. I have spoken so plainly that my tongue is worn, yet you still argue. Let me say this plainly: even if Lü Daoist alone can settle this case, it was Mr. Wang who invited the monks of our temple. As monks, we must follow fate. Having accepted the invitation, how can we shift responsibility? In sum, it is all predestined. Now I have said enough; you should set off quickly.’

Zhijue took Zhiyuan by the hand and said: ‘Let us go!’ Zhiyuan had no choice but to accompany him. Mr. Wang and Lü Dongbin saw them off at the door, hearing Zhiyuan say to Zhijue: ‘There is still one matter; I must go to the western market first. Brother, you return to the temple; I shall follow shortly. If the old fellow asks, say I have returned. You have laboured; rest a while, then come on.’ Zhijue would not comply, saying: ‘Our Master bids you return immediately; there must be a reason. How can we act without his knowledge? I dare not lie for you.’ Zhiyuan laughed: ‘You have no brotherly spirit. Such a small matter causes such difficulty. Very well, I will return with you; after seeing the old gentleman, I can still come out.’ Zhijue led him away, nodded to all, and departed.

Mr. Wang and Lü Dongbin returned to the inner hall. Lü Dongbin apologized to Mr. Wang, saying: ‘Do not worry, sir. Though I have little attainment, in desperate times I will call upon my Master for help. My Master is Zhongli Quan, the great golden immortal, styled Master Yunfang. He has powers to penetrate heaven and earth, to overturn rivers and seas, and is an old acquaintance of Erlang Shen, the master of the Howling Celestial Dog. He knows I am handling this matter here; if I cannot manage it, he will surely know. When he comes, whether by civil or martial means, all will be well arranged. What need is there to fear?’

Mr. Wang bowed in thanks: ‘With the blessing of the immortal, how can I fail to feel assured? Yet I know not when this demon will return; as long as it remains, we cannot rest easy. Since the immortal has such magic, it would be best to send him to Heaven to inform Erlang Shen to take back the dog. Then all would be settled; my family could live in peace and go about our affairs without troubling the immortal or delaying your search for the Way.’

Lü Dongbin heard this and felt truly hesitant. Though he had studied under his Master for many years and knew many magics, he had not applied them seriously, having been engaged in worldly honours and affairs. His home was peaceful and he had had no opportunity to test his magic or to know its efficacy. To say no more, even to go back to entreat his Master would require at least ten to fifteen days’ journey on foot. After returning home, he could hardly leave freely; how could this not harm himself? Thinking thus, he felt melancholy. Upon Mr. Wang’s repeated entreaties, he told him his inner troubles.

‘I truly have a golden immortal Master in heaven. He sent a white crane to carry me here. He foreknew all trivial matters and sufferings I would encounter. Would he be ignorant of future events? Since he has not told me to return for instructions, it follows that he has foreseen that at the critical time a great one will come to aid. Please rest assured, sir; we who cultivate the Way must not boast or lie. If you doubt, look upon my free and easy state, and ask why I willingly endure hardship and wait here for the demon.’

Mr. Wang heard this and was half in doubt, half believing, but accepted his sincerity and with his wife prepared a neat dwelling for Lü Dongbin. Lü Dongbin dwelt there three days with no news, and grew truly anxious. At the stillness of night, he stepped out, strolling under the moon with hands behind his back, pondering how to resolve this matter. Finding no way, he sighed deeply. Before the sigh was finished, suddenly he heard a woman’s laughter in mid-air. Lü Dongbin was startled and looked up to see a colourful cloud, suspended beneath dark clouds in the sky. In the midst of the cloud stood a fair lady, adorned in palace dress, holding a dust whisk; she beckoned Lü Dongbin with a smile: ‘What troubles has this monk, sighing thus? Since your heart is so burdened, why not return home swiftly and enjoy the blessings of the world?’ Lü Dongbin, amazed and ashamed, knelt without rising, and bowed, saying: ‘I beseech the Immortal Lady to descend and instruct your servant.’

Before a word was spoken, the cloud vanished, and in its place stood the Immortal Maiden, who lightly waved her whisk at Lü Dongbin, saying: ‘Arise, arise, you do me too much honour.’ Lü Dongbin arose and bowed four times. The Immortal Maiden respectfully returned his salutes, and said: ‘I am Chang'e of the Moon. By former cause I was stained with worldly passion and was banished by the Star Lord of the Moon to the mortal world. Fortunately, I was rescued by the Iron Crutch Immortal, who sent me back to the Moon Palace. The Star Lord, moved by pity, has shown me more favour than before. Now, by the command of the Star Lord under the Emperor’s mandate, because mankind multiplies daily and the population grows vast, the one full moon can only move about the earth. If one would illumine the worlds beyond the earth, it is utterly insufficient. Therefore, the Star Lord devised a plan to add to the moon’s satellites. The Star Lord summoned us to deliberate on means of extension. The plan was to borrow several great stars surrounding the earth to accompany the original great stars, circling the sun and reflecting its light, thus producing moonlight to illuminate the universe. The original moon would then illuminate the earth alone, its radiance becoming more splendid. The plan was settled, and we were ordered to appoint the Star Lord the chief star lord of the Moon Palace, with subordinate stars under his jurisdiction. The Star Lord was to select from the original serving immortal maidens those of superior talent and virtue, to serve as star officials. I myself was given a seat, and assigned charge of the original moon. I am now investigating the distribution of moonlight in various places; having planned to return to the moon to prepare all. On the way I passed Mount Lu, where I met the Great Immortal He, who invited me to converse for half a day. She said: "By order of Master Xuan Nu, I await in the mountain one with affinity to transmit to him the Heavenly Escaping Sword Technique." I asked what sort of person she awaited. She said: "He is the disciple of Yunfang, Lü Dongbin."’

Lü Dongbin heard this and was both joyful and astonished. He said: ‘I report to the Immortal Maiden, I am Lü Dongbin. My Master, Zhongli Quan, has indeed ordered me to Mount Lu to be taught the Heavenly Escaping Sword Technique by some great immortal. This is truly my great fortune. Yet upon arriving, I was detained by a trifling matter, making my progress difficult. Therefore, I sighed long at the moon, not expecting to be seen by the Immortal Maiden, and feel much ashamed.’

Chang'e smiled: ‘I know something of your difficulties. It was not told me by the Immortal Maiden, nor do I possess foreknowledge; rather, passing the foot of Mount Jin, I met the Great Immortal Zhang Guo. He was then returning from Dragon-Tiger Mountain after saving a man. Upon seeing me he told of your matter. It seems that the man he saved was also by order of your Master, deputed to deal with this affair. Now the matter is settled, he is returning to his mountain and has asked me to send a message to Erlang Shen, urging him to take back the Howling Celestial Dog swiftly, so that you may not linger in the mortal world and delay your proper task.’

Lü Dongbin was greatly alarmed and profuse in thanks. Chang'e pursed her lips and smiled faintly: ‘You, sir, are greatly courteous. I am not practiced in such politeness.’ Lü Dongbin blushed and was at a loss for words. Chang'e added: ‘You are a novice in the Way, your skin is tender. I will not tease you. I will tell you plainly: you know that Erlang and I have no connection; why then did the Great Immortal Zhang entrust me with the message?’ Lü Dongbin hastened: ‘I also do not understand this, and was about to ask you.’

But the writer of this book, having come thus far, foresees that the reader will surely ask: ‘Chang'e and Erlang, being so unrelated, how comes she to bear the message?’ The writer answers: in this matter there is indeed reason.

If thou wouldst know the reason, look to the next chapter for explanation.
