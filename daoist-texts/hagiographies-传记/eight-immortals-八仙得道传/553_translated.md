# Chapter 85: Rebuke of the Younger Sister—Er Lang’s Anger Arises; Repaying the Debt of Affection—The Holy Mother Meets Disaster

Now it came to pass that Chang’e spoke to Lü Dongbin, saying: “Friend Lü, pray tell, why did the Immortal Zhang Guo entrust me, a person wholly unrelated, with the letter to Er Lang? This matter is too long to tell all at once. Let me slowly relate it to you.”

It was originally so that Er Lang had a younger sister who, at the end of the Zhou dynasty, attained the Great Way, and by imperial edict of the Jade Emperor was appointed as Lady Yuan Zhen. In the world it is commonly and erroneously said that the Holy Mother is this very Lady. It is said that although this Lady had already attained the Way and received her appointment, she still owed a debt of marriage to someone. For in the mortal realm, from infancy, she had been betrothed by her parents to a youth of deep affection. This youth was himself a noble scion, endowed with both talent and beauty, and of peerless bearing. Ever since the marriage was fixed, upon learning that the young lady possessed all four virtues, and was as fair as a celestial being, his heart was greatly rejoiced. Yet this young lady, from the moment of birth, neither ate flesh nor fish, nor wore brocade and silk; possessed little knowledge, and was devoted wholly to cultivating the Way. Neither parents could restrain her, nor sisters persuade her. When she reached the age of fifteen, she finally forsook her home and departed. The youth, upon hearing this news, wept bitterly, vomited blood, and died. After the young lady attained the Way, she was appointed to the office of Lady.

But because her husband died for her sake, every thought of it brought her melancholy. She often said: “Though I am an immortal, I can give no benefit to others, yet have caused harm first to my devoted husband—what a grievous matter this is!” Er Lang, hearing these words, often laughed and reproved her, saying she ought not to retain such worldly feelings. If she still held such thoughts, why not return to the mortal realm? Why ascend to Heaven? The Lady, hearing this, replied soberly: “What my sister says is the utmost sincerity and reason. Even mortals cannot disdain affection and abandon reason; how much less immortals and Buddhas?” Er Lang angrily said: “One who is as covetous of desire as you are will hardly avoid being cast down to the mortal dust. Pitiable is the cultivation of many years suddenly undone; you will sink ever deeper and become more bewildered, falling into the wheel of retribution. Then who will save you?” The Lady said: “What I speak of is only the words ‘affection’ and ‘reason’; never did I truly intend to descend. Brother’s words are so severe, yet also laughable.” Er Lang sighed and said: “Your words are mistaken. The difference between mortal and immortal lies in a single seed of the heart. Once mortal thoughts arise, the immortal is no different from mortals. I fear that your present words have already planted the root of transmigration through kalpas. You are unaware of this, and bitterly contend with your brother—is this not both laughable and pitiable?”

The Lady took his words as an attempt to frighten her, and coldly replied: “I only know that the words ‘affection’ and ‘reason’ are universal through all realms. Whether in the three teachings of Heaven, none can escape this circle. The Venerable Lao, ancestor of the Way and immortal, descended to the mortal realm many times—what for? The Tathāgata of the West is willing to enter Hell itself to admonish the world—what for? Though I dare not presumptuously compare myself to these two great ancestors of the Way, neither do I refuse to count myself within affection and reason, so as not to have men say I am an unfeeling immortal. To speak more plainly, if by my causing harm to others I must be demoted again to the mortal world to repay this karmic debt, I shall not refuse. As for seeing one’s nature clearly, self-vigilance, turning back from the brink, and returning to one’s true original nature, all these depend on one’s own resolve and cultivation. I have not seen that any who descend have all fallen into the wheel of retribution and are beyond recovery.”

Er Lang, hearing these words, was indignant and exclaimed: “I have warned you time and again, yet you remain so deluded and foolish. It shows you are unworthy to be an immortal, unworthy of the imperial appointment, and no different from a mortal worldling. As your elder brother, having spoken to you at such length, I have been both generous and reasonable, giving every consideration to both affection and reason. But since you persist in your obstinacy without any turning of the heart, I can only let you be. Go your own way—be the Venerable Lao or the Tathāgata if you will. I have not the great merit nor fortune. I shall only keep myself carefully, be a Great Luo immortal, and dare not harbour any fanciful hopes. Henceforth you and I, brother and sister, shall each take our own path—farewell.”

The Lady, seeing Er Lang thus press her, was also displeased and said angrily: “Brother, why do you press me so? What I say is only my own understanding, that in Heaven and Earth, within and beyond the seas, public and private affairs must all be founded on affection and reason. I was betrothed by my parents. The man died for me. Although I cannot repay him, am I not allowed to hold a little remorse in my heart? Having become an immortal, should I have no conscience? May I then be without affection and reason, harming others for my own benefit? I know brother’s heart will not approve of this. Since you think such conduct is wrong, then before the debt is repaid, you should harbour remorse, so that when opportunity comes, you may strive to repay it. This is but my sincere thought, not a secret desire to entertain mortal thoughts or to seek marriage with men! Moreover, if I truly had such mortal thoughts, why did I not obey my parents’ command, nor hearken to my sisters’ advice, and yet painfully seek the Way to become immortal? Even so, having laboured in cultivation, how could I ascend and be appointed like you, a fellow Golden Immortal?”

Er Lang was originally a fiery and strong-willed deity, most proud and competitive, unwilling to accept any wrongs. Now confounded by his sister’s retorts, he could no longer reply, and leapt about in anger, pointing at the Lady and loudly rebuking: “Well, well! What great merit and profound cultivation have you, to dare dispute right and wrong with me? Since you are so bold, it is clear that you have no regard for me as your elder brother. I no longer acknowledge you as my sister who disgraces our family. From now on, truly let us each go our own way, and have no dealings one with another. So I shall not worry about you.”

The Lady, hearing the words ‘disgrace the family’, was so angered she burst into tears, clutching Er Lang and seeking to accompany him to the Jade Emperor’s court to plead her grievance. But Er Lang would not suffer her to detain him; he pushed her forcefully down to the ground, and strode out in fury. After a few steps he turned his head and shouted: “One more thing I must tell you. Mark well: if you marry, or take a man secretly, you must leave the Immortal Realm and return to the mortal world, and for your whole life you may never utter my name. I will reckon you as though dead, and never inquire further. Should you make mischief in Heaven, or falsely claim my name to commit evil, I will press you beneath Mount Tai, and you shall never see the light of day. Consider well. Farewell.” Saying this, he turned without looking back and went away in wrath.

Who could have known that as an immortal one must neither jest nor owe debts? That Lady Yuan Zhen, having owed a debt of affection to her unwed husband, and having spoken of willingness to repay this debt before Er Lang, unwittingly revealed a secret. There are spirits that roam day and night throughout yin and yang, heaven and earth, who record all words, deeds, and thoughts. Once recorded and reported to the Supreme Deity and Ancestor, it becomes a fixed destiny. No matter how high your virtue, nor how deep your cultivation, you cannot escape nor turn back. This is called the unalterable decree of fate. As the Lady said, concerning marriage, beyond the sanction of the high authorities, there is also in the Moon Palace a certain Elder of the Moon, who presides over all marriages throughout the worlds. He holds a ledger, on which are inscribed the times and reasons for all unions of men and women. This ledger is truly wondrous; it is not written with a pen. Wherever in Heaven or Earth there is such a pair as destined mates, when their marriage is to be set in motion, their names and causes appear therein. Not only lawful matches, but also fleeting unions or momentary pleasures cannot escape its record. Who it is that writes these down is unknown. When the couple unite, the Moon Elder commands clerks in his office to tie together the two names with a red thread. Once tied, this red thread seems born with the record itself, neither to be torn nor removed, until one of the pair dies, or the marriage is dissolved. Then the red thread fades away silently and leaves no trace.

Now this Lady Yuan Zhen, inadvertently letting slip this secret, just at this time her unwed husband had been reincarnated as a human being, born in Yangqu of Shanxi, surnamed Wang and named Chang, barely of age to take the Imperial examinations in the capital. Passing by the Lady’s temple, commonly called the Holy Mother’s temple, there occurred a great rainstorm. Wang Chang took shelter within the temple, and seeing the image of the Holy Mother exquisitely beautiful, this young man, without thought of consequences, in a sudden mood of mischief, carved a couple of crooked poems upon the plastered walls. The Lady was then engaged in a mission to the Qiantang to observe the tide, and upon returning saw the crooked poems, and was greatly angered in her heart. She immediately commanded the temple’s guardian soldiers, and a gust of wind turned back Wang Chang who was walking away halfway. The Lady intended to report him to the Heavenly Court, punish him in the Underworld, and inflict heavy penalty. But Wang Chang, blown dizzy by the divine wind, lost his wits and lay asleep beneath the corridor. Before the Lady could interrogate him, the Moon Elder arrived. The Lady was greatly startled, thinking: “As an immortal, what concern have I with the Moon Elder, and why does he come?” Since he had arrived, she received him with due ceremony. Upon meeting, the Moon Elder congratulated her. The Lady was both surprised and angered, suspecting the Moon Elder’s words to be mockery. After the Moon Elder took out the ledger and showed it to her, she knew that the prisoner before her was none other than her future husband. This case must now be resolved. The Lady then wept bitterly, deeply regretting not heeding her brother’s words, which had brought about this immortal-mortal marriage. At the repeated urging of the Moon Elder, saying: “Since there is a mortal bond, sooner or later it must end; better to conclude it early so that your immortal career may be secure, and you may avoid the ridicule of your peers by harboring mortal thoughts,” the Lady, seeing matters had come to this pass, could do nothing but consent to marry Wang Chang. To prevent her brother’s knowledge and the stirring of trouble, the Moon Elder presided over the marriage that very day, awakening Wang Chang and agreeing terms face to face. The Lady secretly observed Wang Chang, who was truly handsome and dignified, worthy indeed to be her husband, and her heart was comforted.

After marriage, the Lady, as an appointed Golden Immortal, naturally could not descend to the mortal realm. Wang Chang, however, had to proceed to the capital to take the examination.

At parting, the Moon Elder came again, saying Wang Chang must surely succeed. Yet in the marriage ledger there was another lady, Miss Niu, daughter of the present Minister Niu, tied by the red thread to Wang Chang. The Lady Yuan Zhen said: “Since my husband is an official in the mortal world, he should have a mortal wife to support his household, which is only proper. But may he obtain merit and early escape the sea of calamity. Since I am now his lawful consort, this ancient bond may be considered settled, so as to owe no more debt of affection. Should he become accomplished and famous, and retire in due time, if he still remembers me, he may come to the temple and see me. I shall then present him with the true secrets of cultivation, by which longevity may be attained and the Golden Elixir perfected. But if he be lost in lust and desire for fame, then when we meet again it will be at a day beyond remedy. Soon he shall be enclosed in a coffin, rotting with grass and worms and fish, without any fruit or result, and all my present efforts to admonish him will be in vain.” Wang Chang assented tearfully and took his leave.

After he left, the Lady was already one month with child. She sought a quiet place in the temple, secretly gave birth, and sent the child to Wang Chang. Thus the karmic bond was concluded, and she could serve her office with peace, no longer troubled by any entanglement. Yet immortal and mortal marriage violates heavenly law; since Wang Chang had previously died for the Lady’s sake, though she had repaid by surrendering her body, the penalty was not yet fully extinguished. She must suffer another trial before the debt could be wiped clean.

At that time Er Lang was serving by imperial command as the Chief Inspector of the Three Realms, charged with investigating all good and evil deeds, merits and faults, throughout the higher, middle, and lower realms of immortals and mortals, and reporting for reward or punishment. Though a stern and upright god, he also loved to jest. One day, at a banquet invited by Iron Crutch Elder, he met He Xiangu, the chief disciple of the Mysterious Lady, who was then going to Mount Lu and other places to teach swordsmanship. After the wine flowed freely, in the gladness of the company, He Xiangu casually mentioned her former life and her course of cultivation. Er Lang clapped his hands and laughed heartily: “No wonder everyone says He Xiangu has a husband; now you have yourself told the story. You see, no one has wronged you!” He Xiangu, embarrassed by his jesting, blushed deeply. In haste, she retorted: “Er Lang, do not falsely accuse others; your own sister has taken a mortal as husband. You, the Chief Inspector of the Three Realms, cannot even investigate your own family affairs?”

At these words the assembly was greatly startled. He Xiangu deeply regretted her slip, cheeks burning, face paling. Er Lang, a god most keen, is familiar with all matters of the Three Realms, from the great affairs of state and people down to petty family affairs; not one thing can escape his ears and eyes. Yet concerning his sister and Wang Chang’s matter, firstly Er Lang was too self-confident, believing there was no breach in his own family; secondly, since this matter concerned his own household and his own face, all might know but none would speak to him, which was human nature. If such matters concerning heavenly discipline, though small, must eventually be disclosed; how could they remain secret forever? Only by He Xiangu’s words was it discovered so early. This caused her great regret and unceasing repentance. Upon hearing this, Er Lang at once recalled bitterly the words of quarrel with his sister long ago. Knowing that He Xiangu’s words were not without cause, he was a man obsessed with face. Now, having laughed at others, he had his own family shame exposed. Moreover, as an inspector, to have missed his sister’s private matter seemed like deliberate shielding. This was a humiliation unknown since his attainment of the Way.

He looked pale and sullen, eyes red, and for a long time said nothing. He Xiangu knew she had caused trouble. The other immortals privately blamed her. She was so anxious she nearly fled the gathering. Then, recalling Er Lang’s rash frankness might yet be disguised, she rose and apologized repeatedly, solemnly declaring: “It was only a jest, not a true matter. Pray forgive my fault.” Unknown to her, Er Lang also had his own views: as an inspector, if he himself is not upright, how can he set others right? Since such talk was abroad, true or false, it should be publicly investigated. He bore He Xiangu no grudge, but thanked her for her reminder.

Suddenly he approached He Xiangu, bowed deeply, and said: “Fair Immortal, do not take offence; think me not a narrow, selfish, evil deity or demon. Whatever office I hold, how could I be suspicious and yet correct others? I have long suffered from my fellow Daoists mistaking secrecy in this matter as preserving my face, so that I had no clue. But face is but vanity; office is reality. Personal face is private; heavenly rules are public. How can private matters be mistaken for public, and reality abandoned for vanity? This is all due to my fellow Daoists’ ignorance of the greater principle, seeking to mislead my future and ruin my reputation. What you said was jest, but greatly beneficial, and counts you as a true friend in the Way. I here express my heartfelt gratitude. After finishing my duties, I shall come to your abode to pay respects. I hope that many here will henceforth treat me as you have, loving me with virtue, so our friendship be not in vain, and worthy of our intercourse as immortals of the higher realm, a model for the lower and middle realms, for immortals and mortals alike. Friends who care only for face and not for principle are no different from the debauched fellowship of the lower world. I, Er Lang, am most unwilling to see such.”

Having spoken, he bowed again to He Xiangu, nodded to the assembled immortals, and strode out of the cave. The immortals said: “Er Lang will surely handle Lady Yuan Zhen’s case again. What course shall it take?” He Xiangu was deeply regretful, tears flowing. Iron Crutch Elder laughed and said: “You are truly a set of foolish folk, unknowing of reason. Such a matter of heavenly discipline, even if He Xiangu had not spoken, the heavens differ from the mortal world; which of the Great Luo immortals does not possess the power of foreknowledge? Even Er Lang himself, from overconfidence and never turning to his own family, was temporarily blinded; but the truth will be known in time. Just now he lamented that none told him the matter. Pray, what office does he hold? What are his duties? Such a matter close to himself, yet he cannot understand it, and wants others to inform him. But the others have no grudge against his sister, are not his assistants, nor have they been entrusted by him to help. Who then should aid him in this overstepping of duty? As for his office, whether his sister or not, if such a matter exists, how can he turn a deaf ear and be negligent? It is right and proper that he now rushes to investigate. If not today, the day will surely come. This has little to do with what He Xiangu said, and we need not worry for Lady Yuan. As for our usual friendship, we may await Er Lang’s conclusion and see how he disposes it. Here we many immortals are present; each according to his own heart may share the burden and help her avoid suffering. When her star of disaster is fulfilled, we may jointly petition the higher powers to absolve her. If Er Lang persists stubbornly, we still have means to wrestle with him; what fear is there?”

All the immortals applauded and praised this. Lan Caihe laughed and said to He Xiangu: “By this reasoning, your words today have rather helped Lady Yuan.” He Xiangu smiled: “That may not be so.” Lan Caihe said: “How so not? Think: Lady Yuan breaks heavenly law and must suffer; Er Lang has office to judge; but since the case arose from you, everyone feels some guilt and will care for her in future. Is this not a benefit to you?” This caused all to laugh. Yet He Xiangu’s heart was not at ease, and she urged all to remain, awaiting news. The immortals agreed.

After a long while, Iron Crutch Elder, working his divine device, already knew the matter, and laughed: “Behold, Er Lang is no fool; he has pressed his own sister beneath Mount Tai.” The immortals were greatly alarmed. He Xiangu was more distressed, her face changed, and tears fell like rain. She pressed Iron Crutch Elder for a plan to rescue Lady Yuan.

Chang’e, having related thus far, made even the uninvolved Lü Dongbin anxious, who scratched his head and asked: “Amazing! This Er Lang god is indeed too fierce. Though his sister transgressed heavenly discipline, it was the Moon Elder who presided at the marriage, and the debt of affection was thus settled. Though the offense should be punished strictly, in regard to affection it might be pardoned. To be pressed beneath the mountain as punishment is surely excessive. I wonder, O great immortals, if indeed she may yet be saved?” Chang’e laughed and said: “Your own affairs are not yet settled, and you hasten to worry for the ancients. With so many heavenly immortals, is it not possible to save a single one?” As for the method of salvation, not only you but also the readers would desire to know eagerly. Alas, this book has already grown too long, and so must be left to the next chapter for explanation.
