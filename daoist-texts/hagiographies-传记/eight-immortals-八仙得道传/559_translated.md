# The Ninety-First Chapter: Meeting the Master at the Crying Crane Peak; A Visit to the Fox Immortal on Mount Tianping

Now it is said that the Xiang River lies to the south of Dongting Lake, and that it, together with the Gui River on the south, has the same source but parts its course differently. The place where these two waters jointly arise is the renowned Crying Crane Peak from ancient times. The peak rises ten thousand ren in height; as few woodcutters and gatherers come there, many wild beasts and birds often resort to this place to hide themselves, avoiding the peril of traps.

Upon the highest pointed summit of Crying Crane Peak stands a great maple tree, towering into the clouds. Upon this maple tree dwells a white crane of spiritual intelligence, which has made its nest in the branches. The natives say that this crane and its nest have a history of several hundred years. Whenever the wind is clear and the moon bright, in the deep stillness of night, within a radius of three hundred li, the cry of the crane may be heard from the mountain’s summit. Its voice is piercing and sorrowful, capable of stirring the longing for home, and awakening the feelings of the departing traveller. Some say, “The crane is an immortal crane, and its cry is not an ordinary sound. Hence, from ancient times, the peak has been called Crying Crane Peak. Truly, it is because of this crane that the name was given.” This saying is common among those who live within several hundred li beneath Crying Crane Peak. Whenever they hear the crane’s cry, they all can relate the cause thereof.

But the crane has not reached a thousand years, and its crying has ceased. By the beginning of the Kaiyuan era of the Great Tang, the people of this region could no longer hear the crane’s voice. There were some stout-hearted men, eager to investigate the matter, who specially gathered companions and climbed to the highest peak. Under that great maple tree they looked around, and found indeed the crane’s nest fallen to ruin, and no trace of the crane. It seemed that the crane’s tribulation was ended, and that its soul had returned to Heaven. So far as the writer knows, this tale is true. Readers who see the condition of this crane may perhaps recall how the mysterious Zhenzi guarded Zhejiang Chao and was unjustly exiled afar, and also remember the pledge which Zhongli Yunfang made to his disciple Lü Dongbin. Bringing these circumstances together, one may know the origin and reason for the coming and going of the crane.

One day, as the weather turned cool with the coming of autumn, after accumulated rains there came sudden clearing. At night, a bright moon hung over the summit. The crane flew out from its nest and played awhile in various places. Meeting with several fellow birds, they gathered in the deep forest and told each other their life stories. Among these birds were some who in previous lives had been men of improper conduct, and were punished to be birds in this life; some in this life had been insincere in the practice of the Way, and were punished with wings, ranked among birds, suffering much hardship from wind and frost. In their natures and origins, all were far beneath that crane, yet their trials and tribulations were generally similar. That crane dared not complain of Heaven nor of Earth. But recalling its life, cherishing loyal rectitude, though it had not great merit, it would not harbour evil thoughts. Yet, by the ravages of poisonous dragons, due to a moment’s neglect of vigilance, it had nearly brought a calamity upon itself, a tragedy of transmigration. Reflecting on a thousand years of cultivation, it found itself still transformed into a bird’s body. At that thought, hatred and tears flowed together. Usually, it hid upon the treetop. Though it had built a dwelling, it dared not indulge itself. Even every night before sleep, it must stand on one foot upon the trunk, drawing up the other foot. Though it did not bear the hatred of King Yue Xin Dan, it had the resolve of Su Qin pricking his thigh. One purpose was to use hardship as a means of vigilance; the days ahead were long, and the future still remote, hoping to avoid disaster and return to its rightful place, to prevent repeating former mistakes. Another was that, being in exile, its heart longed for the Immortal Realm, and it dared not abandon its studies even for a moment, but rested standing, so as to be easily awakened and thereby double the strength of its learning. All learners, without hardship, find it difficult to advance deeply in their studies. This is alike for the three teachings, whether human or bird. This crane was able, in its exile, to strive thus, and this was also a great cause for the Heaven Court to be moved, to pardon sins and return to truth. Later, all cranes, admiring this crane’s strenuous resolve to become immortal, would look to it and undertake austerities accordingly. Even now, cranes always sleep on one foot; the source of this practice lies in this crane.

The crane conversed awhile with many fellow travellers on the Way, but perceiving their great disparity in wisdom and difference in nature, found little interest in conversation. Its own sorrow and bitterness remained known only to itself, never to be told to other birds. After some talk, it took leave and withdrew. Seeing the moon in mid-heaven, bright and lovely, it watched alone awhile. Unconsciously a wave of sorrow arose, and it began the customary exercise of its daily task, facing the bright moon, uttering long cries. This startled the other birds, who lost heart and colour, saying, “Brother Crane has fallen into his absent-mindedness again.” They could not remain still, and with a noise all returned to their nests to rest. Only this crane laughed and wept together, singing and crying inconstant alone. This stirred the immortals of the Moon Palace to sympathy; all of them complained on its behalf, yet finding it dull and joyless. Just then a strong wind blew, bringing a mass of dark clouds. They took the bright moon and hid within the clouds, not looking back again to see this pitiable crane. The crane also understood the moon’s intent, nodding and sighing, saying, “My fellow brothers of the Way, perhaps you cannot bear to see me suffer this change, and do not wish to behold my forlorn state, thus you hide in the clouds, unwilling to come again to see me. Alas! This is indeed most touching.”

Before the words were finished, suddenly there was a voice in its ear, saying, “In the world there is order and disorder; in fate there is rise and fall; men differ in good and evil; numbers change in their ups and downs. Since you do not forget your origin and deeply understand your spiritual nature, you should accept adverse fortune with submission, and be altogether broad-minded. How is it that because of a little hardship you are so petulant and discontented?” The voice was soft and clear, like a woman’s tone. The crane was greatly startled, thinking that having been banished hither, and after so short a time, it had never before heard a woman’s voice in the deep night. If not an immortal, it must be a mountain demon. How could a demon know such wisdom? It must be an immortal without doubt. Hastily it bent the knees and knelt down, striking its head on the ground, bewailing itself and begging for a sight of the immortal’s countenance. Then it heard the immortal laugh, saying, “We are all fellow travellers on the Way; do not offer such great ceremony. I am Chang’e of the Moon. Just now, I met the Immortal Tieguai, who entrusted me with a letter for you, saying that having endured exile and maintaining your noble resolve, and diligently cultivating, you have moved Heaven to hear. At this year’s Mid-Autumn Festival you shall escape your calamity; then there will be exalted persons to rescue you. You may wait at the crossroads of Shen and You hours, in a mountain hollow halfway up the hill. When you see two Immortals, one old and one young, coming, they will be your masters; you may immediately bow and request to be taught. They have their own methods to guide you back into the world.”

The crane quickly said, “Your disciple has committed crimes and was exiled, but has cherished a devoted resolve and cultivated sincerely. I feared falling into the mortal world and unable to help myself. Now to have the aid of Immortal Masters, returning to the mortal realm, it would be better not to return.” Chang’e laughed and said, “You are after all an exalted immortal of many years’ rank, yet you speak like one just beginning the Way. You are a guilty being, long transformed into a bird; if you do not take a walk in the human world, how can you regain a human body? Even if your crane form can become immortal, after becoming immortal you are still an alien. Moreover, the difficulty for an alien to cultivate immortality compared to a man is vastly different; how far apart they are, you do not know. You only know that once you enter the world you become a common mortal. Do you not know that common mortals surpass beasts by far? Besides, your original nature is not destroyed, and you have attained near success; with such immortal form, though you enter the human world, you will not be obliterated. Further, the Immortal Masters will protect and lead you; your transformation into a mortal world body will be but a moment, and you will immediately become a true immortal. This is Tieguai Immortal’s kindness to you as an old friend; why do you utter such unskilled words?”

Hearing this, the crane bowed and gave thanks. Chang’e said no more, revealed her true form, rode a cloud and ascended into the sky, and in a moment blew away the dark clouds, leaving again a bright moon, more splendid than before. The crane hastened to bow again. From that night forth it ceased its lamentation and no longer wandered idly in the mountain. With a vacant yet diligent gaze, it watched anxiously until the fifteenth day of the eighth month. At dusk it hurried to the place Chang’e had indicated, hurried down the mountain, flew about the mountain hollow, walked about awhile, then looked to heaven and earth, all around. At last after the Shen hour, it thought, “Surely now they should come.” Then it dared not fly or walk about, but crouched on a high spot, both to look upward and overlook, waiting to receive the Immortal Masters with respect. But after waiting long, and seeing the Wei hour almost gone, it saw no sign of any person. The crane’s heart was filled with dread; could it be that Chang’e had misstated the time? Perhaps it was the Shen and Wei hours of the morning, and it had failed to be present to welcome them. Therefore the two Immortal Masters blamed it for insincerity and refused to meet with it?”

Thinking thus, it fell into despair and doubt, wondering if it had misheard Chang’e’s words. The blame for negligence lay with itself. Deeply regretting why it had not looked out during Shen hour that morning, and thus lightly missed a thousand-year opportunity, how lamentable and pitiful! At such thought it almost leapt from the cliff, willing to lose even its life. While hesitating in sorrow, suddenly it heard a laugh in its ear, saying, “Why do men always delight in shedding tears? Such whining ways, are they not shameful and laughable?” Hearing a human voice, the crane knew that there was hope. Regardless of who it was or what was said, it quickly folded its long legs, lay upon a stone, and struck its head with a sound, crying aloud, “Immortal Masters save me! Immortal Masters save me!” Then it heard laughter again, “You are too honest. Having spoken thus to you, I will naturally return your two Immortal Masters. Do not be anxious. Your two Immortal Masters are a master and disciple. The teacher is the former student, and the present student is the former teacher. They are mutually master and disciple, which is a rare and wonderful story since the beginning of immortals. The teacher is called Zhongli Quan, styled Yunfang; the student is Lü Yan, styled Dongbin, newly ordained, having just come from Lushan to learn the Heaven-escaping sword technique from He Xiangu. The master and disciple made an appointment here three years ago to meet. Both ought to be your masters, hence they are called the two Immortal Masters.” Hearing this, the crane realized the speaker was Chang’e, and was greatly comforted.

Chang’e then related the former relationship between Immortals Zhongli and Lü. At last she spoke of the two Immortals’ intended arrival at this time. As Lü Immortal had completed his sword training but lacked a good sword to use, his master took him first to Gu Xu. The fellow traveller Zhang Guo was wandering in Wu and Yue, and saw in Gu Xu a faint sword aura. He sought out many famous mountains, searching for the origin of this aura, and found it in Mount Tianping outside the city, guarded by a demon who would not let it leave the world. Yet the demon himself could not wield the sword. Zhang Immortal had consulted with him repeatedly, yet found no way, and then informed Zhong Immortal.

Zhong Immortal already knew that this sword should belong to Lü Immortal. Indeed, there was more than one sword; they could be used as male and female swords. It was said that these were forged by Gan Jiang and Mo Ye, husband and wife, in the Wu and Yue times. Originally two swords, later scattered among the people, found in the late Han dynasty by a fox demon who obtained Gan Jiang’s sword. Then searching everywhere for Mo Ye’s sword, it was finally found and the two swords united in one hand. One night there were voices of a man and woman in the chamber, followed by the clashing of swords and flashing lights. By morning, the two swords had become one. The fox demon, greatly afraid, thinking it a divine object, hid it beneath Tianping Mountain and found a cave to guard it himself. This was the demon Zhang Immortal spoke of. Zhang Immortal also knew Lü Immortal’s origin, and hearing that his sword training was complete, was willing to accompany them to retrieve the sword. So they came here but feared to be a moment late. Lü Immortal had planned to come here first, to settle your affairs before getting the sword, so you need not wait anxiously. But Zhang Immortal had another ancestral mandate to attend to in the capital, a more important responsibility, so he had to go first to get the sword. He could enter the capital early, but you must wait a little longer. Just now I also stood on the clouds, anxious for you. Later Tieguai Immortal sent word to me to come again and inform you. They should arrive here no later than dawn.”

Before the words were finished, a tiger’s roar was heard in midair. Chang’e laughed, “They are coming! This tiger was subdued by Zhongli as a child, and Tieguai Immortal raised it in Shaoshi Mountain; now it is being returned to him as a mount. Among the immortals, he alone rides a tiger. If it is not he who arrives, then who else?” As she spoke, she appeared. Meanwhile, five-coloured auspicious clouds flew down from Heaven to surround him. He took the crane by the neck, standing waiting. Indeed the tiger’s roar drew near, and a mass of black clouds was dispersed. Beneath the bright moonlight appeared two Immortals, riding a spotted and fierce tiger. The two Immortals first saluted Chang’e; Lü Immortal tied the fierce tiger to a tree. Chang’e led the crane to bow before the two. Zhongli smiled, stroking the crane’s neck, saying, “You have suffered banishment for several hundred years yet have not lost your true nature; your future is immeasurable.” The crane was moved and sorrowful, relating its exile experience. Both Immortals said, “Your past we already know and need not hear again. Now we will take you to visit the human world; are you willing?” The crane bowed, saying, “How could your disciple be unwilling, when so nurtured by the Immortal Masters?” The two Immortals nodded assent.

Chang’e asked about the sword, and Lü Dongbin showed her the treasured sword. Chang’e took it, and as it passed from one to the other, ten thousand rays of cold light flashed and darted. A noble spirit soared to the heavens, even Chang’e’s moonlight flickered and swayed. Zhongli hastily stretched out a hand and brushed the sword’s tip once, and the light calmed, the atmosphere settled, and the moonlight returned to its usual serenity. Chang’e laughed, “Amazing! With this sword you could easily destroy my Moon Palace; that would be intolerable.” This saying made the two Immortals and the crane laugh. Chang’e asked, “Has the sword always been so potent? Why have I never heard of it before?” Zhongli laughed, “Ordinary weapons wear out with use. There are certain treasured swords forged by immortals from the essence of five metals. The longer they exist, the brighter they shine. As for this sword, though not made by immortals, the metal was mined from ancient times, forged from the essence of iron from the nine provinces, surpassing common ore. It was strengthened with human blood and spirit. From the day it came forth, it could fly and strike men. Afterwards Gan Jiang sacrificed himself; the spirit and blood of the husband and wife were concentrated in these two swords. After death their heroic souls remained in the swords. Later, an enlightened old fox collected them, united the two as one, and cultivated with the mountains, waters, sun, and moon for centuries. Thus the sword now shines forth, capable of overpowering sun and moon and melting the universe. When immersed in water it is divided; when meeting fire it is extinguished. The sword itself has become immortal. Now it falls into the hands of Immortals; this is truly a wonder of past and present, a rare opportunity. Do you think it is mighty or not?”

Chang’e, hearing this, could not help but exclaim in admiration. Zhongli looked at Lü Dongbin and said, “This sword is a secret of Heaven and Earth, a marvel of the universe. Not only are ordinary men unlikely to encounter it, even among the great immortals of the Ten Regions and Three Islands beyond the Great Luo, few have seen it. As for the fortune to wield it, that is beyond dreams. All rare treasures should not be flaunted; their display causes greedy men to covet and fierce warriors to contend, bringing forth war and calamity. Those who obtain such things do not lightly show them to others, not out of stinginess but for good reason. How much less should such a peerless treasure of Heaven and Earth be shown to men? If in future comrades ask to see it, one may impart the secret with diminished brilliance and subdued spirit, then it may be shown. As you have just displayed it, it is sure to bring great disaster and later regrets. That would be most improper.”

Lü Dongbin obediently took back the treasured sword and carefully preserved it as before. Chang’e then inquired about Zhang Guo. Zhongli laughed, “That gentleman is truly amusing. He does not care much for the pleasures of the red dust, yet this time he has received a prestigious commission. Soon the present emperor will pass away. The successor is a worthy ruler, but is burdened by the legacy of his ancestors, and fears grievous disaster, so that the Tang dynasty declines and the imperial carriage moves. Yet the state will not be destroyed. Zhang Guo’s mission is to bring about the calamity by imperial decree. Coincidentally, for my disciple’s sword, he went with the old fox. The old fox said: ‘I have no fortune to use this sword. Its weight is unmatched. Therefore I hid it at the mountain’s base. But because I myself expended much effort for this sword, after obtaining it I have guarded it for centuries, unwilling to part with it. Moreover, I heard from an immortal that this sword can only be wielded by a first-class Golden Immortal of Heaven. Unable to enjoy the sword, I have accompanied it for a thousand years, and by absorbing the sword’s spirit and the sword’s essence, plus my own cultivation, I can at least become a sword immortal.’ Hence he would not yield the sword lightly.

Later Zhang Guo contrived a plan, saying: ‘We are now to find one destined for calamity who will obtain the sword. If he is willing to relinquish it, I can guarantee his great achievement. Provided he lives uprightly and keeps within bounds without evil or disorderly deeds, when his fate comes he may attain true success.’ The old fox was glad and immediately yielded the sword peacefully. He himself was then sent by us to the Underworld to be reborn as a northern barbarian boy. Because of this festival, we were delayed an hour. Otherwise, we could have arrived on time.” Chang’e asked, “How is the situation of the calamity? May we speak of it first?”

Zhongli nodded, “Although the secrets of Heaven are hard to reveal, we are not like ordinary men. Broadly speaking, after the fox’s departure there will be internal strife in the Chinese court. The strife is connected to the imperial harem. The women will spread licentiousness within, and barbarians rebel without; then inside and outside will join in concert to create this great calamity. That is roughly the state of things. But in my view, the fox is suspicious; although fated to depart in calamity, it still guards against our trickery, lest other complications arise. That is its own sin, to be punished again in this life and suffer transmigration. In short, the response to fate and calamity is fixed; calamity is always more difficult than fate. Since ancient times it is not easy. There are often special star officials sent to earth to bring calamity, but once in power they go astray, so their work is incomplete and they suffer disaster instead. People often wonder why those fated to calamity, sent by Heaven’s command, should suffer failure. They do not know that beyond their commission’s scope they may overreach. Even when a decree applies to but one region, the harm may be nationwide; a disaster may fall at one time but leave poison lasting forever. How can this be called Heaven’s forgiveness? Special envoys are so; how much more difficult is calamity? And for a fox demon whose human body is not yet formed and whose Dao mind is not firm, it is all the more difficult.”

Chang’e sighed upon hearing this, then asked, “Just now you said that the new ruler will suffer calamity, yet it is due to the burden of previous emperors. What is the meaning of this?” Zhongli answered, “There have been many wise emperors in our dynasty, but alas, they have often lacked in filial duty, and licentiousness flourishes. Even now there are many unresolved cases in the underworld. But this is merely the Li family’s domestic affairs. The greatest cause is that the former emperor waged war overseas against the Wa. Those blessed descendants ruled there for centuries, but were held in control by demons of the heretical sect in politics. Now their national teacher is a rhinoceros demon, who, hearing of the arrival of Chinese forces, raised magic, gathering winds from all directions into a hurricane—meaning a wind from all quarters—which scatters the Tang warships, causing countless deaths. Fortunately Wang Chang’s son Wang Tai, enlightened by He Xiangu and cultivating Penglai, learned many immortal arts to prepare to rescue his mother by splitting the mountain. Though young, he is mighty in skill. Seeing Chinese soldiers perish under the hurricane, he was both angry and sorrowful, and used techniques to roll up the sea and pound the mountains, suppressing the hurricane; then he set fire to all the great mountains of Wa, causing great earth tremors and many deaths, and laid the foundation of these volcanoes. If the dwarfs again offend the superior state with cruelty and injustice, at any time and place, with a single spell the whole region of prosperity may be blasted to ruins within twelve hours. In my view, the people of that land delight in war and lust, are cunning and strange; future harms to China will be endless. If they provoke this young master, there may be more great earthquakes to come. These are matters of the future and need not be spoken of now. As to the present great war, the demons are cruel and deserving of death; the emperor has issued orders to punish them justly. The chief cause of this calamity consists of over two hundred thousand aggrieved ghosts from both sides, all blaming the present emperor alone. This is the great cause of the disaster bequeathed to his successors.” At this point Lü Immortal inquired about Wang Chang.

How Zhongli replied is yet to be told. See the next chapter for continuation.
