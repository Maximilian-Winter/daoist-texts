# Chapter One Hundred: The Eight Immortals Cross the Sea; a Naval Battle Erupts upon the Waters — The Two Dragons Return to Heaven’s Palace to Celebrate the Peace

Now it is told that the Dragon King had two grandsons, Mo’ang and Mo’rùn, who, contending with the two Immortals Lan and He over a flower basket, were by the two Immortals’ flying swords cleft in twain and slain. The few Yakshas who bore them were sorely wounded and fled back to the Dragon Palace, where they related the matter to the Dragon King and Queen, weeping and lamenting. The Dragon King and Queen, upon hearing the news, cried aloud, “My wrath is beyond bearing!” and forthwith commanded that ten thousand divine soldiers of the near sea be raised. The Dragon King himself led them forth to pursue and attack the two Immortals.

The two Immortals, having slain the brothers Mo’ang, knowing then that the two were sons of the Dragon King, hastened to report to the assembly of Immortals. Iron Crutch, Zhongli, and Pure Yang, hearing this, were greatly alarmed, saying, “This trouble that the two Immortals have brought upon themselves is no small matter. The Dragon King and Queen have four sons and four grandsons; now two of their grandsons have been slain by you—how could they be content to quit so? ” The two Immortals answered, “The mischief was first stirred up by themselves. If our possessions be taken from us, should we not seek them back?” The assembly replied, “Though this be so, the Dragon King and Queen are not easily dealt with. Moreover, among us there are those who have close ties with them; to meet them would be indeed an embarrassment.” The two Immortals said, “Let us see how they come. If all be reasonable, we shall confess to the fault of unintentional injury. Truly, we did not know these two were grandsons of the Dragon King; our repentance comes too late. But if they be of such noble birth, why then do they commit such deeds? Again, if they had but declared their origin, how could we have been unfeeling? We would have returned and conferred with you to devise a plan of action; this misfortune would not have occurred. Let us convey this meaning to the Dragon King, and see if he might spare us. But if he come without hearing our cause, and come to battle, then we will not be taken unresisting; we will strike a blow or two, and see how the victory fares, then reason further. What say you all?” 

At this time, the Immortals Lü, Li, and Zhong already knew that this matter was as fate had ordained, and that the Dragon King and Queen must suffer this calamity. They therefore made no blame of the two Immortals, but said, “The Dragon King and Queen are both proud and fiery of spirit, and seeing their beloved sons slain, how could they end it peaceably? There must be a great battle prepared. You two may rest assured; since we are fellow practitioners, we will share fortune and misfortune together, and not leave you alone to bear the blame.” The two Immortals rejoiced and thanked them.

Before a word was finished, the sea surged and roared, and gleams of gold shone brightly. In a moment, there issued forth thousands upon thousands of troops and horses. The Dragon King Pinghe, together with his valiant generals, with wrath mounting to the heavens, charged into the air. The Immortals hastened to advance Iron Crutch to parley with him. Iron Crutch, seeing the Dragon King, raised his hand in salute. The Dragon King, on beholding Iron Crutch and others, recognized some half of them, and recalled much kindness received; yet his anger blazed uncontrollably, and he pointed at Iron Crutch, shouting, “It is you fellows who have hurt my two beloved grandsons. Since you are old friends of mine, I have not dealt poorly with you. Now, passing through my domain, you neither landed to pay a visit to old friends, but wreak havoc upon my seas, killing my two grandsons. How shall this grudge be avenged? To make matters short and plain, I give you but a moment to surrender the guilty man and woman, to be dealt with at my pleasure; let all else be dropped, and you shall pass unscathed. Should there be a single word of evasion—hmpf!—do not say that you insignificant fellows cannot be overcome, even if a million heavenly soldiers come. My wife and I once made havoc in the Heavenly Court, and never lost face; much less shall I bear insult from you knaves.”

Master Iron Crutch, hearing his unreasonable words and rude railing, could not help laughing, saying, “So many thousands of years have passed, yet thou, old Dragon, art still of such blunt temper! Alas! I pity thee who enjoyest thy throne and abundant blessings, yet at length cannot escape a great calamity. I would fain calculate for thee how to escape this doom and return to be Dragon King for a few years more, but thy fate is fulfilled, and there is no remedy. Look at thee roaring thus, how dost thou resemble a Dragon King? Thy words are so lawless that even beasts of evil are better than thee. Thou art a great officer of the Supreme Emperor, with a royal title, yet thou thinkest not to show gratitude nor repay kindness, and dost boast of thy rough deeds in making havoc in the Heavenly Court. Knowest thou not that all things under heaven have cause and effect? Sow what seed, reap what fruit. Heaven’s justice is clear and exact. Dost thou think that because thou madest havoc in the Heavenly Court, the Supreme Emperor would not punish thee, but instead grant thee rank and title, so that in heaven and earth there is none like thee in power? Know that these are but decrees of fate. Thou didst earn thy meritorious exploits in governing the sea, and the Emperor’s favour could not resist the decree; thus thou hast been leniently spared thus far. Yet the matter of havoc in the Heavenly Palace, in any case, must have its due retribution. I have already reckoned for thee; now is the time for thy due punishment. This retribution is as thou shouldst bear as Dragon King. Before thou wast compelled to be king, so now thou must needs show retribution. Since thou and I have had long acquaintance, we have conferred and appointed me to meet with thee to discuss how to pass this ordeal. Though escape be impossible, perhaps some partial redemption may be made, so that not all thy clan perish together. Yet, on meeting me, thou hast poured out vituperation and even laid blame upon former foul deeds, to oppress me. It shows that thy fate is fully run, and cannot be forced. I lament that my good will is cast away in the vast sea, leaving not a trace.”

This laughter and scolding was a shame and humiliation never before suffered by the Dragon King in all his life. But he roared aloud, and led forth his troops to charge. The Eight Immortals each drew weapons and met him on all sides. The fight raged so furiously that heaven and earth changed colour; the sun and moon hid themselves; from noon until evening they fought. The Dragon King spat forth a luminous pearl that hung in the sky, shining brighter than day, and pressed on in fierce battle. Among the Eight Immortals, Lü Pure Yang drew forth a pearl no larger than a yellow bean, held it aloft and tossed it upwards; suddenly it gave forth ten thousand fathoms of brilliance, greater and brighter than the night pearl, making the latter pale by comparison. Lü Ancestor laughed, saying, “That wicked dragon, now that we fight by night, we do not need to borrow your light. See how my treasure compares with your dragon’s pearl?”

Yet the Dragon King’s soldiers, already bewildered by the Immortals’ weapons and treasures, were made dizzy by Lü Ancestor’s pearl. Unable to see one another, Li Tiegui opened his gourd, whistling with a blast of wind, and they were all sucked therein. Upon the surface of the sea there remained but the Dragon King alone, who revealed his true form and gave a great roar, opening his enormous jaws to swallow the Eight Immortals. Zhongli laughed, saying, “This is the old trick I used to use when killing flood dragons, growing my body longer than a dragon’s, stronger still.” He grasped the dragon’s barb and pulled with all his might, drawing forth blood from the old Dragon’s head. Then all the Immortals came up together, each stretching their bodies to great length and size, pressing upon the Dragon’s body. The Dragon King was hard pressed, when, luckily, the Dragon Queen, having learned of his plight, sent forth the troops of the entire sea, herself with two princes leading, to aid the battle. By this time the day had fully dawned. Lü Ancestor retracted his pearl. The Dragon King also sought to reclaim the night pearl, but the pearl, like a child following its parent, flew after Lü Ancestor’s pearl. The Dragon Queen hastened to the chase, but with a great crash, the two pearls, great and small, both entered Lü Ancestor’s palm. The Dragon King, having lost the pearl, as if his three souls lost one, became confused and faint. Further, he was bitten upon the neck by the fierce tiger ridden by Zhongli, and was sorely defeated and fled. Zhongli pursued into the sea. The Dragon King was forced to transform into a small loach and fled into the Crystal Palace.

Meanwhile, the Immortals Caihe and Xiangzi, taking advantage of the fierce conflict, had already infiltrated the Dragon Palace, breaking open the great gates, and setting fire in many places, burning the palace. The Dragon King was unable to advance nor retreat. Being proud and unyielding by nature, he could not bear such humiliation. He gave a mighty roar, struck his head against the palace, shattering his skull and brain, and died a violent death. Caihe and Xiangzi burnt several palaces, then withdrew to the sea to aid Iron Crutch and the others against the Dragon Queen. At this time, the brothers Ao Guang and others, sons of the Four Seas Dragon King Ao Guang, hearing of their father’s distress, led their divine soldiers to join the battle. Ao Guang was the Dragon King’s eldest son, famed for his wide strategy and great magic. When he brought his troops, he had arranged with his three brothers to each bring half the sea waters under their control. At the height of battle, each would release their waters, immersing the eight Immortals in mighty waves. The water and sky met, sky and water mingled, forming a great and immense waterfall. Although the Eight Immortals knew arts to avoid water, fighting in the water was less convenient than for their foes.

Now the Eight Immortals gritted their teeth and raged. Each soared to a higher heaven, looking down to see the Dragon Queen and several sons and grandsons, proud and haughty, pushing waves and seeking their enemies. The Immortals sighed, saying, “The retribution upon the wicked dragons has come, yet they dare to display their power. How many men and beasts will be drowned this time? How many houses and fields submerged?” Lü Ancestor then said, “Since this fellow is so ruthless, by Imperial edict we patrol the three realms, removing harm from the people; caring not for profit or loss, we must use the method of pushing earth and damming water to fill up this sea, and thus subdue these wicked beasts.” The Immortals asked, “Where shall we find so much earth?” Lü Ancestor smiled and pointed to Mount Tai, saying, “If we bring this mountain into the sea, though we cannot fill it all, at least we can bury these wicked creatures therein.” The Immortals clapped hands in approval. Lü Immortal then displayed the art of moving mountains, reached out and scooped up Mount Tai entire in his hand, and cast it down upon the place where the Dragon Queen and her sons and grandsons were. Many shrimp soldiers and crab generals were crushed and died. Though Mount Tai was later returned to its original place, much earth remained in the sea, forming a cluster of small islands. The place before had but a few islands, very low in terrain; these deposits covered them and became many high grounds connected to new islands. Later generations say these are the Ryukyu Islands. Whether this be true, none can say, but as there are many islands there, it cannot be determined. This is mere idle talk.

Now the book draws to a close and no more is told. The Dragon clan suffered this great calamity, and only Ao Guang escaped with life, coming before the Jade Emperor to weep and relate his grievance. The Eight Immortals restored Mount Tai to its place. The ancients say that climbing Mount Tai is like surveying all under heaven. Thus in old times Mount Tai was esteemed the highest mountain under heaven. Yet, in these days, those versed in geography know it is not so very lofty. Leaving aside the world beyond, within China there are many mountains higher than Mount Tai. It is not that the ancients measured the sky from the bottom of a well and spoke folly, but because when the Eight Immortals scooped up the mountain to fill the sea, much earth was scattered and left in the sea as islands. The islands formed from the earth of Mount Tai, thus since the Eight Immortals crossed the sea, Mount Tai has become much lower. This is the reason for the difference in Mount Tai through the ages.

After completing the slaying of the dragon, the Eight Immortals together went to the Jade Pool to offer felicitations. The Jade Emperor and several Immortal Patriarchs had already arrived. The Eight Immortals reported on the dragon-slaying. The Jade Emperor, most benevolent, bore no grudge for past offenses and had long since forgotten the previous sins of the two dragons. Hearing the recital, his holy heart was somewhat displeased, seeming to reproach the Eight Immortals for taking up arms and killing office-holding Immortals. Then the Primordial Lord, with his chief disciples the Fire Dragon and the two Perfected Ones Piaomiao, explained the great disturbance caused by the two dragons in the Heavenly Court and the severing of the earth’s veins, deserving of due retribution. When the Supreme Emperor sought worthy aides, this matter was the origin. Now the dragon clan suffered great calamity at the hands of the Eight Immortals, all as ordained by fate, and not to be blamed.

The Jade Emperor suddenly understood, and said, “Though the two dragons have former sins, yet in the management of waters have meritorious deeds. In many years of sea governance, they committed no serious misdeeds. Now, though this grievous retribution is their own doing and hard to avoid, my heart is not at rest.” He further commanded the Fire Dragon and Piaomiao Perfected Ones to reincarnate the two dragons and their descendants as good, wealthy, and noble mortals upon the earth. Since the eldest son Pinghe Ao Guang had escaped harm, and was known for wisdom and magic, and had many years’ experience in sea governance, he was to inherit his father’s office, to repay his parents’ years of service and show the utmost justice in reward and punishment.

The Immortal Patriarchs and Queen Mother heard this and all praised the holy virtue. Then Ao Guang hastened from the Lingxiao Palace to the Jade Pool, knelt before the Jade Emperor, and wept as he told his grievance. The Jade Emperor comforted him and made known the cause and effect of the matter. He then proclaimed various merits and wishes. Ao Guang was moved and grateful, and gave thanks for the imperial grace. The Jade Emperor then summoned the Eight Immortals to meet with him and dispatched the Fire Dragon and Piaomiao Perfected Ones to explain the causes and principles to both parties, warning that no further enmity should be fostered; if disobeyed, heavenly laws would bring deserved punishment. The Eight Immortals and Ao Guang together bowed in thanks before the Jade Emperor, the Queen Mother, and the Immortal Patriarchs.

From that time the heavenly court was peaceful, the sea and sky serene. With no further matter to record, the book comes to an end.
