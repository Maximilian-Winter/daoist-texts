# Chapter Sixteen: The Three Elders of Dawei Village Speak of Past Affairs - A Word from Jin’an Bridge Points the Way from Error

A thousand turns the body as a boat unmoved,  
The wind rolls waves surging hard to quell.  
Steadily holding the rudder by the river’s flow,  
A light sail journeys to the riverbank’s end.

It is related that Qiu Changchun, with his elder fellow disciples, arrived at Dawei Village in Xianyang. There they saw houses ruined, the village desolate; three old men were sitting at the gate of a temple. Changchun advanced and made a deep obeisance. He then inquired after the residence of Wang Xiaolian. An elderly man with white hair and beard said: “You ask for the abode of Wang Xiaolian—may I ask whether you have some connection?” Qiu Changchun answered: “He is our master, who taught the Way in Shandong, and has passed beyond to immortality; a few of us conveyed his coffin home, and yesterday interred him beneath the southern hills; today we wish to return to Shandong, and therefore inquire after his family and kin. Are they safe and well?”

The old man sighed and said: “Your master was my clan elder brother; I rank third, and am called Old Third Wang. Since my elder brother left home, Sister-in-law Zhou grieved herself sick, and died of illness; her son Qiulang went to live with his maternal grandfather, returning but once or twice in a year and a half; now his house has no one.” Changchun asked again: “How came the village thus ruined?” Old Third Wang sighed again: “Since my elder brother’s departure, there is no one to take charge here; all look to their own affairs, and when troubles arise, none steps forward to manage them. They meddle in one another’s business, and so it grows worse and worse; the better they might be, the poorer they become, and thus the village has fallen into ruin. Later it was said that Xiaolian became an immortal; all say he drew away the wind veins, and gently laid this blame upon himself.” Changchun asked further: “How is it known that he became an immortal?” Old Third Wang pointed to the temple: “This temple was built by several villages north and south to honour him; enter and see for yourselves.” Changchun and the elder brothers entered the temple, and indeed saw upon the altar a statue of their master, lifelike in appearance. They all advanced and worshipped. On the tablet was inscribed four characters, ‘The Lofty Hero,’ and on the left and right couplets read:  
“Manifest the art of the Way in Xianyang,  
Blowing wine to extinguish fire;  
Bestow grace and light upon his native village,  
Employing talismans to drive away plague.”

Qiu, Liu and the others, having read these, knew not the meaning, and asked the three elders how he drove away pestilence and extinguished fire. The elders said: “In that year a plague spread in our region, a grievous contagion; all were struck with terror. Suddenly a Taoist in yellow robes appeared, writing talismanic characters in vermilion, spreading them through every village, asking no fee. Those who affixed these talismans upon their doors were immediately freed from the plague. It was also said that in Xianyang city a fire broke out, consuming houses and defying extinguishment; a Taoist was seen, also clad in yellow, who came forth from a tavern holding half a cup of wine; he drank a sip, then blew upon the fire, which was forthwith put out. The townsfolk, grateful for his fire-quelling deed, sought his name. He said: ‘Three horizontals followed by a straight line is the surname; three soldiers with open mouths form the given name.’ Saying this, he vanished like a vapor, nowhere to be seen. Later some deciphered this riddle: ‘Three horizontals and a straight line’ is Wang; ‘three soldiers with mouths’ is Ji—so his name was surely Wang Ji. When this tale reached our village, we knew he had become an immortal. We have a clan sister, called Mother Yu, who upon dying also said: ‘Uncle Xiaolian, clad in yellow, came to fetch me away.’

Therefore, several villages north and south, moved by his protection and favour, proposed to build this temple in his honour. Upon the left wall hangs a wooden tablet recording these matters, which you may read and understand.” Liu, Qiu and the others approached the tablet and read upwards:  
“It is said that those who labour diligently for the state are honoured, and those who confer merit upon the people are commemorated. In our village, Wang Gong, named Ji, was an extraordinary man. In his youth he pursued learning, in manhood he studied martial arts; after taking up the office of Xiaolian, he feigned illness and stroke, and did not speak. None could perceive his state; he nursed his sickness for twelve years, seldom venturing beyond the door to gaze afar; one day he vanished, whither none knew. Search was made far and wide, but no trace was found. Afterwards the plague arose; Gong deployed talismans to rescue and preserve many lives; the villagers were all beneficiaries. Also in Xianyang city he blew on wine to put out fire, leaving his name in riddles. On the passing of our widow sister, he ascended to heaven, protecting the villagers with great blessings. Gong did not forget his native place, and how could the villagers fail him? In consideration of his merits in driving away plague and quenching fire, the people commemorate him. Therefore they convened the villagers in public meeting, proposed to build a hall and install a statue to honour him; yearly sacrifices are made to repay his labour—thus it is said.”

Qiu, Liu and the others, having read, sighed: “The Master’s divine stratagem is unfathomable, his transformations without limit—beyond our understanding!” They saw Old Third Wang whispering into the ear of a young servant, who nodded and went away; in a short while a rustic came bearing a basket containing flour and food, inviting the Daoist brothers to partake. Liu and Qiu offered thanks, but the elder said: “You have come to escort our clan elder brother’s coffin home, and to inquire after his family; no great hospitality is due—only simple fare, not worthy of thanks.” Seeing this, Qiu and Liu sat down to eat. That night they rested in the temple. Many came to visit and keep them company. At dawn next day, seven or eight households brought food offerings. The Daoist brothers could not eat much; they took a little from each household as a token of thanks.

Liu Changsheng and the Daoist brothers conferred, and took the surplus money from the funds given by Master Ma Danyang, over ten taels, and presented it to the three elders for the upkeep of the Master’s temple. The Daoist brothers praised this, and handed the silver to the elders, explaining their purpose. Wang Third Elder accepted the silver and Qiu, Liu and the others took leave and set out.

They left Dawei Village and travelled more than ten li, until beneath a great tree they sat down to rest. Tan Changzhen said: “We have escorted our Master on his westward journey; the great matter is accomplished. If we go again to Shandong, it will be only to feed Brother Ma and spend some money. There is a saying: ‘There is no feast that does not break up.’ Also: ‘The Way does not cling to affection; to cling is not the Way.’ Travelling long together, have we not heard that three gather to form a group, five to form a clique, bringing gossip and great inconvenience? Better that each go his separate way and enjoy freedom.” Wang, Hao and the others said: “Brother’s words are right.” Thus Liu Changsheng went southeast; Wang Yuyang southwest; Tan Changzhen southwards; Hao Taigu eastwards. Qiu Changchun, seeing all paths taken, found no way to go, and resolved to remain in Shaanxi to seek alms and practise cultivation.

This story is set aside; to speak instead of Hao Taigu’s travels northward to Jin territory. There he saw a stone bridge with eight or nine arches; beneath it solid rock formed the foundation. In autumn and winter when the river dried and water was low, many refugees and starving folk lodged under the bridge. Hao Taigu saw the place was clean, in the time of drought he sat beneath the bridge in meditation. At first none noticed, and it was quiet; but gradually his fame spread, and neighbours brought him cakes and bread. He could not eat all, and left the rest piled before him; ravens and crows pecked at the crumbs, tearing pieces off, flying in the air or dropping into the water or upon the road. Children seeing this gathered the crumbs to eat, and came playing under the bridge before Taigu. Seeing him sit unmoving as if carved from wood or clay, the children, grown familiar, took him for a Bodhisattva and wished to build him a shrine. They gathered stones and tiles, built walls on either side; broke branches to make beams, and laid grass upon them for a roof. Every day after their meals they came down to the bridge, kowtowed and bowed to Hao Taigu, laughing and making merry without ceasing. Hao Taigu, a man of cultivation, did not mind; he regarded their noise and play as peace within tumult, not without profit.

One day, on the village’s Guanyin Lotus Lantern Festival, the children went to see it and the place was quiet. Hao Taigu saw a man beneath the bridge grinding bricks; after a while he raised one to his face to look at it, then ground again, and repeated this many times, wearing the brick away to powder. He then took two bricks to grind, and Hao Taigu, seeing he was wasting his labour and wished to warn him, asked: “What vessel do you wish to make by grinding these bricks?” The man answered: “Indeed I wish to make a vessel.” Hao Taigu said: “If you would make a vessel, you must first fix your purpose; either scrape it high and smooth it flat, or apply force to shape it round, guided by rules and standards; only then will you succeed. As you grind blindly, how can success be attained? Pray, what vessel is it in truth?” The man answered: “I would grind the bricks bright and smooth to make a mirror, so I may look at my face morning and evening.” Hao Taigu laughed and said: “Brick and tile are neither copper nor iron; how could they be ground bright? Is it not wasted labour?” The man laughed heartily: “If you say I cannot make a mirror from bricks, how then can your sitting in meditation make you an immortal? Your dry sitting is no different from my grinding bricks.” Hao Taigu was struck with a sudden shock, hastily rose and stepped forward to ask more, but the man vanished as a vapor and could not be spoken to. Hao Taigu knew this was an extraordinary person come to point out the futility of dry sitting; he packed his things and departed from Jin’an Bridge, heading to You and Yan, sighing thus:  

Grinding bricks wastes effort in vain,  
Both endeavours are labours in vain.  
Sitting alone in stillness, breath dries and withers,  
One word’s awakening breaks the lost path.

Leaving aside Hao Taigu’s northern travels, let us speak of Changzhen journeying south. One day arriving in Suizhou, as evening approached, there was neither old temple nor cool pavilion, nor any inns for travellers. He saw by the roadside a great manor, with many houses; he intended to seek lodging and a humble meal. As he approached the gate, a man came forth who seemed the steward; his surname was Gu, given name Zucheng, styled Yufeng, once a man of the Way. But having been cheated several times by rogue Daoist pretenders, he distrusted all Daoists, like one who strikes the sand ahead and frightens those behind. Gu Yufeng saw Tan Changzhen approaching and shouted aloud: “Daoist, do not come here; monks and Daoists have no affinity.” Tan Changzhen glanced at him, intending to enlighten him, but whether he would receive instruction remained to be seen. Let us wait for the next chapter to unfold.
