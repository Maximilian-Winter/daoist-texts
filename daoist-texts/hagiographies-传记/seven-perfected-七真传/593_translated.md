# Chapter Twenty-Five: True Yang Suffices to Dispel the Hostile Yin — The Wickedness Full, the Whole Household Perishes

Beneath Mount Beimang lie rows of tombs, clear and bright;  
Wild grass grows thickly, strange birds call in mournful cries.  

Long lying at the spring terrace, the man wakes not;  
Peach blossoms fall and plum flowers fade beyond the festival of Pure Brightness.  

It is told that Qiu Changchun, sitting in meditation within the Fanxi Temple, was engaged in diligent practice. When in a state of emptiness and silence, suddenly two boys appeared, guiding a white crane before him, saying: ‘By the command of the Supreme Emperor, we request the True Man to mount the crane and ascend.’ Changchun pondered thus: the words of the Three Officials and Great Emperor, the seven years completion of the truth when it should arise — how could there be a present day flight to the heavens? Could it be that these are but illusions born of the Yin demons attacking his mind, fabricating such phantasms to undermine his true Way? At this moment of awakening, the two boys vanished, and there was no white crane; he sat alone upon half a mat. Outside the window, star and moon shone together, all sounds were silent. Truly, many strange and uncanny things arose without cause. Had not his thoughts been firmly held, he might have erred by a hair’s breadth and lost by a thousand li. He blamed himself for having rashly indulged a moment’s fancy, thus inviting many Yin demons. If the Yin qi were not refined away, how could Yang be pure? He then conceived that only by means of this method of mingling with demons could the host of Yin be thoroughly reduced, leaving no opening to be taken — this was the best plan.  

Thus he left Fanxi and came to a hill of earth. Below the slope lay a round stone, weighing a hundred catties, solitary and remote. He made a bed of grass as a base and sat in meditation there. Whenever the Yin demons discovered him, they would quickly come, carry the round stone up the slope, then let it fall, after which Changchun would sit quietly once more. Such a scene was repeated again and again; he made use of the stone in confusion, and so for three years the Yin demons completely retreated, his whole body became pure Yang, all visions of man’s eyes vanished, spirit and brightness appeared, and the heavenly mysteries responded. He knew there was a certain matter, but the heavenly secrets must not be revealed; he must awaken others. If he could cause them to awaken, they might avoid perdition, not lose the heavens’ benevolence in preserving life, and open the gates of salvation. At that time he left the hill to carry out this purpose.  

Meanwhile, in the land of Kanlong, there was a wealthy family surnamed Wang, given the name Yun. The household was rich and grand, and the people called him Lord Wang, a man of great wealth. Dwelling by the mountain and water, enjoying the scenery embraced by hills and streams, outside the gate flowed a creek. Though Wang Yun had such a large estate, his heart was mean and harsh. He was accustomed to using large scales and small measures, weighing heavily on others and lightly on himself, always bullying the poor and weak, seizing fields and lands. His servants, taking advantage of his power, were like foxes assuming the tiger’s might, dogs relying on their master's influence, cheating the simple villagers, doing all manner of evil, and causing their master to wield terrifying power, yet remained unaware of their crimes. At the gate of his house stood a great stone over a zhang high and several chi wide, its head large and tail small, like a lion, and so it was called the Stone Lion. Many labourers worked outside; at mealtimes, the gatekeepers would lie upon the lion’s back and, with a wooden clapper, strike so that all around heard and returned to eat — this was the usual custom. Not far off was a slope on which a Guanyin temple was built, constructed by Wang Yun’s ancestors. They had donated the land and secured a custodian. Yet when Wang Yun took charge, he drove away the custodian and reclaimed the land, though he did not demolish the temple nor damage the deity’s image, showing that he had some shred of kindness. Though the temple remained, it became a cold and deserted place.  

Qiu Changchun came from Baoji and took shelter in this temple, hearing the clapper’s sound daily. He went many times to seek alms, but no one cared for him; he could not even obtain a mouthful of water. Only one girl named Chunhua, seeing him come empty-handed and go empty-handed several times, felt pity and secretly hid some sweets, which she threw into his sleeve, saying: ‘Old master, quickly go; this is no good place.’ Two days later, Changchun came again to seek alms and met Wang Yun standing at the gate. Changchun’s original purpose was to awaken him; seeing him there, he spoke four words to move him, saying:

> Greed for fame and profit turns back not;  
> Though gold and silver you wear, you cannot take it with you.  
> One day the impermanence ceases all affairs;  
> Leaving only tears that flow long.  

When Changchun had finished speaking, Wang Yun suddenly grew angry and said: ‘You wild Taoist, do not speak nonsense here! I have never believed in Buddha’s teaching. You had better go away quickly lest you suffer disgrace.’ Changchun replied: ‘Poor Taoist comes specially to your noble house to seek alms, hoping for your generosity.’ Outside the gate was a container for horse dung, with a shovel beside it. Wang Yun took the shovel and scooped a load of dung, then came before Changchun and said: ‘If you ask me for alms, then I will give this to you.’ Changchun, wishing to test his mind, saw this was a jest, and so pushed forward a gourd ladle, whereupon Wang Yun truly poured a scoop of dung into it. Changchun said: ‘What use have I for this horse dung?’ Wang Yun replied: ‘This dung was all gathered by hired labour. Today I give it to you, and that is my alms.’  

Hearing this, Changchun praised him, saying ‘Well said! Well said!’ Wang Yun and his servants laughed loudly together. The entire household, young and old, heard this and burst into laughter, but Chunhua’s heart was otherwise. One day, seeing the servants go up the slope to work, she secretly hid some distilled liquor in her sleeve and stepped outside just as Changchun stood at the gate. She wished to give it to him, but Changchun said: ‘I am not come for liquor but have an important word to say to you, which you must remember well. When you see the eyes of the Stone Lion at the gate turn red, then hasten to the Guanyin temple on the hill to hide for three quarters of an hour, and then you shall be safe and without worry.’ Saying this, he floated away, and was no more seen.  

Chunhua kept this in mind and came out twice daily to watch the Stone Lion. Months passed thus, until a boy tending cattle saw her and asked: ‘Sister Chunhua, why do you come daily to look at the Stone Lion?’ Chunhua told him: ‘That day the alms-seeking master told me when the eyes of the Stone Lion turn red, I must hasten to the Guanyin temple to escape disaster.’ The boy, hearing this, was much amused and wished to play a trick. Secretly he found some red earth, and in the afternoon, after bringing the cattle home, climbed the Stone Lion and painted two round circles on its face like eyes. Having done so, he slipped away to watch her reaction.  

At evening, Chunhua suddenly felt fright and unrest, her heart beating fast. She thought: could it be that the Stone Lion’s eyes had turned red? She hurried outside, disregarding her master’s shouts and abuse, and saw indeed the Stone Lion’s eyes glowing red. Greatly frightened, she fled to the Guanyin temple. The boy followed after her. Upon entering the temple, just as he was about to question her, there was a sudden clap of thunder, shaking the earth and sky. Soon a fierce wind rose, black clouds covered the heavens, and in an instant a great rain poured down as if a single bucket were overturned, continuing until midnight. Then the rain ceased. Chunhua and the boy lay beneath the shrine table, hearing the thundering sounds like a thousand men beating drums, or ten thousand horses galloping.  

At dawn, they dared to come out and look. Had they not looked, it would have been less to fear, but seeing it, their souls fled. It was found that Wang Yun’s estate had been washed away by the flood. No one knew at what time, but a dragon had passed that way, seeing the finely built house, had gone on to the Crystal Palace, leaving only the Stone Lion unwilling to depart, now overturned and lying in the river.  

Chunhua, seeing Wang Yun’s household destroyed by water, was moved to tears. Soon people of all ages from far and near came to gaze, all saying the heavens had eyes and retribution is sure. Seeing Chunhua weeping, they asked: ‘Your master’s whole family is destroyed; how did you escape alive?’ Chunhua told them the words the Daoist had spoken. The villagers all debated, saying Wang Yun’s evil was full, and the heavenly flood descended. The Daoist must have been a divine immortal, sent to warn him, but he would not repent, so was swept away. Though a maid, Chunhua had a root of goodness, hence was saved, and so was the boy who tended cattle. It showed that between heaven and earth, one must do good; when great disaster comes, only then is there a saviour. They asked Chunhua what she now intended to do. She said: ‘This temple was built by my late master long ago, and the land around is dedicated to it. Now I shall stay here and cultivate, giving up the worldly flowered world and the red dust’s allure.’ The villagers replied: ‘That is well. We shall gather some funds to help you for a time until the autumn harvest, so you lack not.’ Having said so, they collected some money and grain to give to Chunhua, and found an old woman to keep her company. Chunhua thanked them all and thereafter devoted herself earnestly to cultivation. After some years, Qiu Zhenren, resting in Longmen Cave, knowing her true heart towards the Way, came to save her; she then bowed to him as her master and afterwards attained the true fruit.  

Again, after instructing Chunhua, Qiu Changchun entered the mountains of Longzhou, where he found a stone cliff with a cave. It was from the late Qin and early Han times, when Master Lou Jing fixed the places of sun and moon. Below was a creek and river. The hanging rock cliff faced the water, which bent and twisted; from afar the cliff seemed to span the creek, and the cave like a gate. At that time, scholars prized the imperial examinations, and seeing the cave like a gate, named it Dragon Gate, taking the meaning of the carp leaping the dragon gate. Changchun came here, and understood the words of the dragon flying on the gate were to be fulfilled here. He therefore nurtured his nature and cultivated truth within the cave.  

Within two years, Longzhou suffered drought. The prefect led the people in prayers, but the rain did not fall. The crops withered, and all the people were in distress. Qiu Changchun went to the prefecture and declared he could pray three days for sweet rain to save all. The prefect was glad and invited him to ascend the altar. Changchun dressed properly, bowed his head in the altar court, and with a single thought cast his sincerity upwards to the Supreme Emperor. Indeed, torrents poured down for three days and nights, the fields became abundant, and the people were safe. The next year, the northern regions suffered great drought. The emperor and officials prayed, but no rain came. The reigning emperor, Yuanshun, issued an edict, posting proclamations seeking men of the Way who could pray for rain. Those who could bring down rain would be rewarded with high office and noble rank. The imperial proclamation was posted, and each province knew it. The prefect of Longzhou recommended a certain man who was able to pray for rain, but none knew who he was. Let us see what follows.  

Formerly famine weighed heavily; now the emperor moves.
