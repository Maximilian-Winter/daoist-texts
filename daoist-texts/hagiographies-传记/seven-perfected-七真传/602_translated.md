# Chapter the Third: Yue Pengju Risks Life to Aid the Revival; Wang Shixiong is Deposed Amidst Vain Worldly Affairs

The Poem says:

Men of the world hold firm their resolves,  
To aid the state and secure the realm, they study sages and worthies.  
With a heart sincere, they uphold the altars and lands;  
Before their deep affections unfold, the noble spirit surges to heaven, clear and manifest.  
Embracing innate will and vigour entire,  
Now casting worldly affairs all aside,  
They lay down mortal attachments and seek the true elixir.  
—In the Right Tune, “Chasing Clouds Flying”  

Now it is the winter of the Yiyi year. The Jin troops invade by several routes; the Song Emperor summons General Zhong Shidao as Commander over the Two Rivers, accompanied by Yao Pingzhong, both proceeding to Bianjing. The Emperor, seeing the Jin forces drawing near daily, flees eastward to avoid them. Li Gang petitions to borrow the title of Crown Prince to protect the realm; the Emperor yields the throne. The Crown Prince Huan ascends as Emperor Qinzong, honouring his father as the Retired Emperor, and establishes the Zhu family as Empress. In the spring of the Bingwu year, the era name is changed to Jingkang.

In the twelfth month, the army is routed at Liyang; the Jin cross the river. Li Gang is appointed Governor of Dongjing to oversee the armies in reinforcement. The Jin besiege Bianjing; Li Gang fights bravely, repeatedly repelling them. The Jin propose peace, sending Prince Kang as hostage.

Zhong and Yao’s forces arrive, and by night assault the Jin camp. The Jin general Hou Li perceives it and sallies forth, engaging in battle; the Jin troops are early alarmed on all fronts and press a fierce attack. Zhong Shidao, commanding from the rear, seeing the Jin forces mighty, dares not fight in disorder; he draws back while fighting, and gradually retreats. Yao Pingzhong’s troops are at the front, deeply encircled; twenty thousand elite soldiers are surrounded. Yao Pingzhong, a man of unmatched valour, now with the Jin forces overwhelming, breaks through right and left, carving a bloody path. Riding a blue mule, he travels seven hundred and fifty li in a day and night, reaching Dengzhou to find sustenance. Later entering the Great Mianshan, he unburdens the mule and seats himself on a stone, suddenly feeling his heart and mind cool and clear. He sees a figure ascending the mountain, who says: “Thou dost contend for this little fame, endangering twenty thousand lives; thy guilt is not small.” Pingzhong falls prostrate and begs for pardon. The figure says: “I am Zhongli Quan of the Han, and come by likeness of deeds to save thee.” He imparts the Supreme Way, bidding him repose in the mountain cave and cultivate himself in stillness; when the Way is perfected, he shall surely accumulate merit and practice. Pingzhong bows to accept the repose. No more is recorded.

This winter, the Jin capture the counties east of the river, and then seize the Western Capital. An edict is issued for Prince Kang to go to the Jin; at Cizhou the defender Zong Ze receives him, advising him not to go.

In former times, at Tangyin county in Xiangzhou, Yue He, a man of the immortal line of Xu Lin five generations on, dwelt. His wife, Lady Yao, while with child, dreamed of an iron-armoured man who said: “The Han’s Zhang Yide is to abide here.” Upon waking she gave birth to a son, upon whose roof flew a great bird like a swan, crying aloud; so he was named Fei, styled Pengju. It was the second day of the second month in the Guiwei year of Chongning. Soon after birth, floods swelled; the mother held Fei in a large urn, floating with the water. Reaching shore, mother and child were unharmed. From youth he bore integrity and vigour, was grave and taciturn. Though poor, he diligently studied and had strange powers. He first learned archery under Zhou Tong, never missing. Upon Zhou Tong’s death, he visited his tomb at every new and full moon. At his father’s passing, he observed all funeral rites. He married Lady Li to serve his mother. Again he studied under Wei Zhong of Ximou Mountain — Wei Boyang the immortal — receiving the battle bell. At that time local folk were many thieves; his mother tattooed the words “Utmost loyalty to repay the realm” on Fei’s back to admonish him. When Liu Shixuan pacified Zhending and recruited brave warriors, Fei joined, repeatedly capturing fierce bandits; Prince Kang appointed Fei as Chengxin Lang.

At that time Prince Kang was at Cizhou, visiting the shrine of Cui Jue, resting briefly within, waiting for dusk to slip away. In half-sleep he heard a voice: “Rise quickly, pursuing troops are near!” The Prince awoke alarmed, seeing under starshine a horse, mounted and urged on, leaping over waters. At dawn, soldiers of Xiangzhou came to escort him; his horse stood stiffly, and on inspection was found to be the earthen horse from Cui’s shrine.

The Jin besieged the capital, demanding the Emperor surrender. They sent a decree to Xiangzhou, ordering Prince Kang to be Grand Marshal of Hebei, to lead troops in defence. The army was defeated, and the Emperor entered the Jin camp to negotiate peace.

In the spring of the Dingwei year, the Emperor was captured in the Jin camp; the Jin commander pressed him to change clothes. Minister Li Ruoshui cursed the enemy and was slain. Liu Shi hanged himself, and after eighty days was buried, his colour as if alive. In the second month the Jin seized the Empress, Crown Prince, and royal kin; only Empress Meng, deposed, escaped. The Jin set the minor official Zhang Bangchang as Emperor of Chu. That summer the Jin led north the two Emperors and three thousand captives; Empress Meng submitted a letter, commanding Prince Kang to succeed the throne. The ministers petitioned to restore the rightful ruler, so Gaozong took the throne at Yingtian Prefecture, establishing the Southern Song, changing the era to Jianyan, honouring Empress Meng as Empress Dowager Yuanyou. Zong Ze was made Governor of the Capital, ordering Yue Fei to defeat the Jin, promoting him to Commander.

In spring of the Wushen year, Jin Wuzhu invaded Bianjing; Zong Ze was defeated. Memorials were submitted but suppressed by Huang and Wang; Zong Ze’s back ulcerated and he died. Du Chong succeeded him, but betrayed Zong Ze and was defeated.

In the year Jiyou, the Emperor fled to Zhenjiang, defended by Lü Yihao. The Emperor then went to Jiangning, renaming it Jiankang. The Crown Prince was appointed, but soon died. Hong Hao was sent as envoy to Jin to seek news of the two Emperors, but was detained at Lengshan. In July, Wuzhu invaded Bianjing; Du Chong abandoned it and fled. The Emperor fled to Hangzhou, renaming it Lin’an. That winter Du Chong rebelled and surrendered to Jin; all armies routed. Wuzhu invaded the south; the Emperor fled to Mingzhou. Wuzhu seized Lin’an; the Emperor took to sea.

In spring of the Gengxu year, the Jin pursued the Emperor; commander Zhang Gongyu of Haizhou defeated them. The Emperor went to Wenzhou, anchoring beneath Jin’ao Island. While touring, the Emperor saw an inscribed poem on a steep rock:

A boat lies crosswise at Weitou oyster-bed,  
Sunset wanes as the tide awaits to rise.  
With thee I will keep our promise to ascend,  
And journey forth upon Jin’ao’s back.

—Inscribed by Master Xu

The Emperor marvelled, saying to his attendants: “When I was newly born, Master Xu presented this poem to the Retired Emperor and departed; who would have thought it would come to pass today!” The Emperor returned to Yuezhou. At that time Han Shizhong had greatly defeated Wuzhu at the river; Wuzhu sought to march on Jiankang. Yue Fei ambushed at Niutoushan; his eldest son Yue Yun, aged twelve, wielded twin hammers cutting through battle; Wuzhu was again routed and withdrew. Han Shizhong blocked Jin forces at Jinshan; Wuzhu employed fire attack and fled. The two Emperors were moved to Wuguo City. Jin set Liu Yu as Emperor of Qi.

In the Xinhai year, Song changed its era to Shaoxing; Zhang Jun was made Commander for Jianghuai, Yue Fei his deputy. Zhang Jun sent his son Zhang Xian under Yue Fei’s command. Fei led Zhang Xian, Niu Gao, Wang Gui, Yue Yun and others to pacify Jianghuai, all subdued. Empress Dowager Meng died. Qin Hui and Lü Yihao became Left and Right Vice Ministers; Hu Anguo was deposed as overseer of Xiandu Temple; Zhang Jun was summoned to manage Xihe. That summer Yue Fei defeated Qianzhou; the Emperor wrote the four characters “Jing Zhong Yue Fei” [“Utmost Loyalty Yue Fei”] and bestowed a banner.

In spring of the Yimao year, the Jin ruler Sheng died; his nephew Bingbing succeeded as Emperor Xizong, continuing the Great Jin. The Emperor appointed Zhao Ding and Zhang Jun as Left and Right Vice Ministers. Zhang Jun wished to recommend his friend Su Yunqing to succeed him, but Su Yunqing withdrew, sending a poem by messenger, which read:

Many years apart, each a household’s way,  
Who would have thought a trivial name reached the wise?  
Fools of the age covet wealth and rank,  
Spreading filth to soil the noble Su Gong.

Zhang Jun sighed deeply. Later Su Yunqing was seen at Yixing, growing younger in appearance, then vanished. That summer Yue Fei received command, raised to Marquis of E, to fight Yang Mo. The Emperor summoned Zhang Jun back; Fei said: “Pray leave me eight days, and I will capture Yang Mo.” In truth, in eight days Yang Mo was slain. Zhang Jun sighed: “The Marquis Yue is a divine strategist.”

In summer of the Bingchen year, Yue Fei took leave from office for mourning his mother; an edict recalled him. Fei petitioned to recover the Central Plains, but the Emperor refused, so he returned.

In the Dingyi year, He Xian returned from Jin, hearing first of the deaths of the Retired Emperor and Empress Dowager; the Emperor donned mourning robes. An edict ordered Yue Fei to station at Jiangzhou.

In the Wuwu spring, Jin changed era to Tianjuan. The Emperor fixed his capital at Lin’an, appointing Qin Hui as Chancellor. Wang Lun came with Jin envoys to negotiate peace and return territory; Qin Hui advocated it strongly. Yue Fei remonstrated: “The Chancellor’s plans are not good for the realm.” Qin Hui bore a deep grudge. Wang Lun was detained by Jin at Hejian Prefecture and hanged himself.

In the Gengshen year, Wuzhu again seized provinces of Henan and Shaanxi; Wu Lin was defeated at Fufeng. Wuzhu used iron towers but was broken by Liu Xi. Yue Fei advanced to recover the Western Capital, leaving his main army at Yingchang. Wuzhu sent a lame horseman to battle; Fei ordered his men to bind hemp blades to cut the horses’ legs. Wuzhu increased his forces to fight; Yue Yun routed them. Wuzhu’s forces defeated, he sought to return north. Qin Hui wished to negotiate peace, urging the Emperor to order generals to withdraw and summoned Yue Fei back with a Jin-lettered edict. Fei wept in anger, withdrawing to E. Wuzhu again seized Henan counties. Qin Hui accused Zhang Jiucheng and six others, all demoted. Jiucheng called himself Wugouzi, an incarnation of Wenchang, versed in Buddhist and Daoist scriptures; demoted to magistrate of Shaozhou, later living as a recluse and writing books. No further record.

In the Xinyou year, Jin changed era to Huangtong. Wuzhu seized Shouchun. Zhang Jun and Liu Fu were ordered to relieve it; Jin troops fled. An edict ordered withdrawal; Han Shizhong and Zhang Jun made Privy Councillors, Yue Fei deputy. Qin Hui slandered Fei, deposing him as overseer of Wanshou Temple. Qin Hui forged an edict to imprison Fei. Peace talks concluded, and tribute was paid to Jin. On New Year’s Eve, Qin Hui forced Fei to hang himself in prison; Zhang Xian and Yue Yun were beheaded and their heads displayed in the market. On that day the sky darkened. Yue Fei had once dreamed of two dogs quarrelling; while crossing the river he heard Jin monks and Daoists in Jinshan predicting the future. He went to inquire, telling his dream. Daoist Yue said: “The quarrel of two dogs is the character for prison. I advise the general to conceal himself and flee, to avoid the calamity of Fengbo.” Fei laughed and did not believe, till he met his end under the pavilion of Fengbo. Qin Hui usurped Fei’s family assets, exiling them to Lingnan. Fei’s daughter Yinping drowned herself. Han Shizhong was dismissed as overseer of Liquan Temple, thereafter closing his door and retiring with wine to amuse himself.

In the Renshu year, Jin returned the remains of Empress Dowager Huizong. Empress Wei arrived. Qin Hui was made Grand Preceptor and Duke of Wei. At that time Xie Shi travelled to Lin’an, and by the character for Chancellor named himself; the Emperor met him, striking his staff on the ground and inscribing the character for Chancellor. Shi said: “Adding one stroke atop earth makes the character for king. Pray add another character.” The Emperor added another character “Wen” with the staff. Shi was startled: “The two sides are Lord and Sovereign.” The Emperor said: “Say no more; tomorrow I shall summon thee.” The next day he was summoned; the Emperor wrote the character “Spring” and appointed him Chancellor. Shi said: “Qin’s head is too heavy, pressing down the sun so there is no light.” The Emperor was silent, granted rewards and dismissed him. Qin Hui heard this and secretly plotted against Shi, banishing him to Lingnan. No further record.

Meanwhile Wang Shixiong had served as Commander of Chang’an for three years. When Jin forces passed the passes, he joined with Deputy Commander Wu Lin at Tongzhou, defeating Jin at Fufeng, and recovered the city of Shaanxi, maintaining order. Later he was promoted as Chief of the Western Route, guarding Tongguan. No further record.

Now at the west gate outside Ninghai Prefecture of Dengzhou, Shandong, five li from the city, dwelt a wealthy family surnamed Ma, with a son named Yifu. When his mother was first pregnant, she dreamed of the goddess Ma Gu bestowing a red pill, which she swallowed and then conceived. He was born on the twentieth of the fifth month in the Guimao year of the Jin Tianhui era. From youth he showed wisdom; as a child he often recited poems of riding clouds and cranes. Li Wumeng saw him and said: “This boy is a genuine immortal genius.” The family was immensely wealthy, also called Ma Banzhou. He married the daughter of the villager Sun Xianzhong. Lady Sun was born on the fifth day of the first month in the Jihai year of Song Huizong’s Xuanhe era; her mother dreamed of a white crane carrying her auspiciously, and then conceived. She was beautiful of brow and eye, naturally wise and bright, possessing a countenance that made fish sink and birds alight, and a demeanour that shamed the moon and hid the flowers; fond of calligraphy, and especially of composing poetry. Married to Ma Yifu, they often wrote linked verses, rivaling the young Su. But her parents died early; the couple, blessed with a talented son and lovely daughter, enjoyed morning and evening happiness, yet could not escape the burdens of household management. Fortunately, their wealth sufficed to employ servants. When the Jin invaded, fearing chaos, they were born in a remote place, and did not suffer calamity. No further record.

Now in autumn of the Yichou year, a comet appeared; Zhang Jun was demoted to Lianzhou due to his political views.

In the Bingyin year, Liu Ziyu died. At first, official Zhu Song of the Ministry of Personnel was ill, entrusting his family affairs to Ziyu, who taught his son Zhu Jia. Later he was established by righteousness. No further record.

In the Wuchen year, Jin Grand Tutor Wuzhu died; Wanyan Liang became Chancellor.

In the Jiyi winter, Wanyan Liang was upright and self-assertive, changing the era to Tiande. He massacred royal clansmen and was licentious beyond measure. He moved the capital to Yanjing. Song ministers wished to attack Jin, but Qin Hui opposed.

In the Gengwu summer, Shi Quan attempted to assassinate Qin Hui on the road but failed. In the Xinyou year, King Han Shizhong died.

In the Jiaxu year, the Western Liao ruler Yilie died; his wife took the regency as Empress Cheng Tian, changing era to Chongfu.

In the Yihai autumn, Qin Hui conspired treason, framing Zhang Jun and other worthies; suddenly fell ill and could not speak. He was granted the title Prince of Jiankang and ordered to retire, dying that night. The Emperor then perceived Qin Hui’s treachery, ordering the prosecution of his faction; all were banished to remote provinces. Zhang Jun, Hu Yin, Zhang Jiucheng and others were restored to office.

In the Bingzi summer, Jin changed era to Zhenglong. Emperor Qinzong died in Jin custody.

In the Yimao spring, Zhang Jiucheng took charge of Taiping Temple in Jiangzhou, recommending that Jin would break the peace treaty; therefore endorsing Chen Kangbo and Zhu Jia. In June Jiucheng was visited by a heavenly spirit and died seated. That autumn, Zhu Jia was summoned but did not come; Chen Kangbo was appointed Right Vice Minister.

In the Gengchen winter, envoy Yu Yunwen was sent to Jin to congratulate the new year. The Jin ruler said: “I shall go see the flowers at Luoyang.” Yunwen returned report. Kangbo requested use of Wu Lin, Liu Yi, and Wang Gangzhong to defend.

In the Xinsi autumn, the Jin launched a great invasion of Jianghuai; Wang Gangzhong and Wu Lin defeated them. The Jin were defeated and crossed the Huai River; Liu Yi and Zhang’s troops followed at Huaiyin. The Song Emperor personally led the campaign. Kangbo requested Yunwen’s counsel for strategy. Wanyan Liang reached Yangzhou, besieged Caishi; Yunwen sallied forth and routed the Jin, Wanyan Liang dying in battle. Yunwen and others requested the Emperor withdraw. In winter, tenth month, Jin enthroned Wulu at Liaoyang, renaming him Yong, as Jin Shizong, changing era to Dading.

In May of the Renwu year, the Song Emperor passed the throne to Crown Prince Ge, who became Emperor Xiaozong, honouring Gaozong as Retired Emperor. Zhang Jun was summoned to pacify Jianghuai and to restore Yue Fei’s rank, who was given a ceremonial burial at West Lake. At that time Wei Sheng of Suqian raised troops and recaptured Haizhou. Sheng was skilled with large blades; the Jin fled in fear. Sheng had been friends with Wang Shixiong in youth, both sworn to serve the realm.

Before, Wang Shixiong had guarded the narrow passes, and seeing repeated Jin defeats, resolved to avenge the two Sages. Qin Hui reversed policy, advocating peace and submission to Jin; Wang bore deep resentment, composing “Spring Official” to allegorize his dissent. Thus when the imperial sanction came, he was dismissed.

Shixiong was deposed, returning to Xianyang, aged forty-seven. Singing and sighing, he said: “Confucius was not perplexed at forty, Mencius unmoved at forty; I have passed that, yet still swallow carrion and peck at rot; purple and gold about my heart, is this not folly?” He spoke with his wife Lady He on the Way: “I see that to bow to high office and be enfeoffed is like fleeting clouds and purple mists; to gird gold and jade — how unlike those who are free of the world! Now happily deposed, I shall not grow old trapped in official life; if I do not rouse myself and withdraw quickly, I fear sinking deep in the sea of bitterness.” His wife said: “The saying is: ‘To serve the king is like serving a tiger; to eat a salary is like swallowing a hook.’ Now you have been dismissed; what matter? Moreover, we are at the age of knowing fate, blessed with two sons Jinbao and Jinyu, surely not lacking heirs; and with food and clothing sufficient, why seek elsewhere?” Shixiong replied: “Though your words are reasonable, how can one contend with the tangled affairs of the world? Time flies swiftly, not pausing for a breath; fate is not mine to hold. I wish to emulate Han’s former Marquis Liu, Yue’s Fan He, Jin’s Ge Hong, and Tang’s Jia Dan — all having fulfilled merit and fame, attained the Way and ascended the immortals, living as long as Heaven and Earth, shining as the sun and moon; some ride cranes across the three Isles, others mount dragons and tigers to the Ninth Heaven. When that time comes, how joyous it will be! Though so I say, I know not if Heaven will follow man’s wish.” His wife said: “When man has such wish, Heaven surely will grant it. Your words as you speak make me, like one awakening from a drunken dream, suddenly feel the world vain and fleeting; may you soon meet a bright master who teaches the wondrous method of self-cultivation, that we may practice together and ascend the Immortal World as husband and wife — would it not be beautiful?” Shixiong laughed: “If there be a day of attaining the Way, should we meet on the road, I will teach you; much more so, being husband and wife! I shall now set forth to seek and inquire; if Heaven should pity us, and we have inborn immortal roots, surely a true master will appear and hand down the Supreme Way.” As the saying goes:

A bond long sown brings meeting in this life,  
From now all ties of red string are cut.  
Had not the youthful bird descended then,  
How could a single finger cause it to soar?

If thou would know how Wang Shixiong and his wife seek the Way, listen to the next chapter’s unfolding.
