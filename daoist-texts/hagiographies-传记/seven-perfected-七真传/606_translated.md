# Chapter Seven: Qiu Qi Seeks the Way and Finds the True Master — Hao Tianran Pursues the Profound and Attains the Great Way

Verses say:

With true resolve one seeks the Way,  
A steadfast heart endures hardship,  
Not retreating is strength indeed.  
Cold and indifferent to worldly ties,  
Casting down fame and gain,  
Not entering the field of right and wrong.  
A thousand demons and myriad trials all past,  
Naturally the whole body exhales a fragrant grace.  
When功 is perfected and the Way complete,  
Untroubled and joyous,  
One fully drinks this nectar rare.  
(From the tune "Young Wanderer")

It is told that in the place of Bindu in Qixia County, Dengzhou Prefecture, there dwelt a good man named Qiu Deshu. His father was Wenjie, his mother Lady Yang; their ancestral home was in Yanjing. Because of the troubles in the world, they migrated to Shandong. His parents died early. He married a wife of the Ou family, and their household was wealthy and abundant. The couple practiced goodness and delighted in the Way. They begot three sons and two daughters: the eldest son Qiu Qichong, the second Qiu Qishu, the third Qiu Qifa; the eldest daughter was named Yulan, the second Lanying. Only the third son, Qiu Qifa, was born on the nineteenth day of the first month in the year Wuchen, the eighth year of the reign of Emperor Xizong of Jin—corresponding to the eighteenth year of Shaoxing of Song Gaozong. At his birth, a rainbow and halo pierced the chamber, and colored mist filled the sky. Deshu said, "This child surely will not be an ordinary vessel."

Qifa, from youth, delighted in the Way, was quick-witted and had a strong memory, endowed with an exceptional nature. He did not envy splendor, but was devoted to quietude. At sixteen he abandoned home to pursue the Way, seeking instruction at the Three Officials Hall on Mount Yu, took vows and became a monk, changing his name to Fatong. After three years, now nineteen years old, still innocent and earnest in learning, he perceived that his master was false externally but inwardly spurious, lacking true virtue and morality. Suddenly he heard that at Quanzhen Monastery in Ninghai there was a Master Chongyang, whose virtue was lofty and who could foreknow the future. So he went to seek him.

Arriving at Quanzhen Monastery, he sat in the guest hall and saw a Daoist friend, hair tied in three coils, three strands of slight beard, clad in black robe, holding a deer-tail whisk, who entered the guest hall. Fatong hastened to bow, and Danyang also returned the bow, then invited him to sit and called for tea.

After drinking, Danyang saw this Daoist friend was under twenty years old, appearance pure and bones delicate; he was no fool. He asked, "Whence, Dao-friend, is your immortal homeland? Where is your immortal temple?" Fatong answered, "I am a native of Qixia County, now ordained at the Three Officials Hall on Mount Yu." Danyang said, "Pray tell your master’s name." Fatong answered, "My master’s surname is Zhang, who has attained the Way and passed it on." Danyang again asked, "What surname and Dao name have you yourself?" Fatong replied, "My surname is Qiu, my courtesy name Fatong. May I respectfully ask your surname and Dao name?" Danyang replied, "My common surname is Ma, my courtesy name Danyang. May I ask what brings you here?" Fatong said, "Yesterday I heard that at the Treasure Monastery there is a Master Chongyang, whose virtue is noble and great, whose learning is vast and profound, and who foreknows the future. He is a living immortal of this world. I, being ignorant, wish to seek salvation for the world, humbly beseeching to enter under his instruction, awaiting teachings day and night. I know not whether he will accept me; I beg Master Ma to introduce me to him. What is your honored opinion?" Danyang said, "If so, cultivate here and learn the Way; if fate joins us, I will accompany you to see the master." Fatong said, "Thank you, Master Ma."

The two went to the alchemical chamber of Chongyang. Fatong stepped forward and knelt, saying, "I have come expressly to seek instruction, humbly imploring my master’s great mercy to save me; I shall never forget my master’s grace in all my life." Chongyang opened his enlightened eyes to gaze upon him, observing the deep roots of his previous lives, and thought, "This child will surely become a great vessel; we are all inferior. I must exert myself to train him." Thereupon he closed his eyes again, and chanted:

Fine golden scales sport in the green stream,  
Able to seek fragrant bait and swallow the hook.  
Slowly I draw in the fishing line,  
Pulling into Penglai to gain free roaming.

Having finished the chant, he closed his mouth as if a curtain fell. Master Danyang, knowing the meaning of the poem, naturally understood the import of salvation, yet wondered why the master closed his eyes and paid no heed, the reason unknown. Fatong knelt for a long while, his feet numb, knees aching, tears flowing from his eyes. At this Danyang felt some pity and plaintively entreated the master, "This Dao-friend Qiu has knelt too long; I pray master open your heart with compassion and take him in." Chongyang said, "You take him, I will not," and again closed his eyes and said nothing. Fatong earnestly entreated with bitter words, but still no word was spoken.

Danyang said, "Can it be that my master has no fate with you? You may return and seek another master who has the Way. Since he does not accept you, to die kneeling here is in vain." Fatong rose, grief-stricken and weeping, saying to Danyang, "It is not that I have no fate with master; it is only that my roots are shallow and my blessings thin. Now having met a true master, yet cannot be saved — what use is such thin blessing in this world? It were better to seek a path of death."

At this, Danyang and Changzhen and others heard his words with sorrow beyond endurance, and said to Fatong, "Stay here for a while; we will slowly persuade master, and perhaps he may accept you." Fatong kowtowed to Changzhen and Danyang, saying, "Now I am overwhelmed by your great mercy and pity; such grace is hard to repay." Danyang said to Changzhen, "At first hearing the meaning of master’s poem, I thought he would accept him. Why then did he refuse?" 

After several days, Danyang again spoke to master, "I see Dao-friend Qiu is sincere in seeking the Way; I beg master to take him in." Chongyang said, "My thoughts are not yours to know. Since you pity him, you may take him in." Danyang was at a loss but again consulted with Changzhen and others. Changzhen said, "Master absolutely refuses to receive him; there must be some reason we cannot fathom. Why not have the senior brother take him in for master? Would it not be the same? He can then take you as his introducer master; would that not be well?" Danyang said, "Your words are right. Pray explain this to Fatong." Changzhen then said to Fatong, "Master absolutely refuses you; I shall take you in for master. You may take Ma Danyang, senior brother, as your introducer master." Fatong, hearing Changzhen’s words, then bowed to Ma Danyang as his introducer master, bowing four times, and then paid respects to the senior brothers.

Danyang said to Fatong, "Since master will not accept you, now listen to senior brother Changzhen’s words: I will temporarily take you in on master’s behalf. I now change your name to Chujī, courtesy name Tongmi, Dao name Fuyang. From now on you must strictly observe purity and manifest diligence in your cultivation; before master you must serve attentively, disobeying no command. If in time master and disciple find accord, the great Way may be heard." Chujī bowed to Danyang, saying, "I respectfully obey Master Ma’s command, and dare not disobey." Danyang said, "You are mistaken. We are brothers in the Way; do not call me master." Chujī said, "All owing to your pity, how could I forget your grace!" Danyang said, "For now we are brothers; no need for ceremony. Only may your heart be brave and strong, your resolve firm and unyielding, that you may become a great immortal of the Great Luo Heaven, and my heart shall be glad."

After some days, Chongyang and the other Dao friends discoursed on the profound and the subtle. When Chujī approached, the master closed his mouth and was silent—not once but often so. All said the master had no fate with Chujī. Chujī served master day and night, attentively without slackening, but without expression.

It is told that in the autumn of the year Dinghai, the seventh month, there was great drought in Jianghuai and Shandong, and all the people were terrified. Officials in prefectures and counties set up altars to pray for rain, commanding monks and Daoists to hold ceremonies and fasts, but no response came. The common people of Ninghai knew that Master Ma had brought a certain immortal who could foreknow the future. The crowd said, "Why not go to Quanzhen Monastery to pray for rain? If it responds, the people will rejoice; we cannot say for sure." So they gathered seven or eight notable elders and came to Quanzhen Monastery. Danyang came out, asked the reason for their coming, and learned it was for praying for rain. The crowd saw Ma Yuanwai in Daoist robes, hair tied in three coils, and all praised him. The people said, "It has not rained for a long time, and the people are anxious. The local magistrate called monks and Daoists to perform ritual fasting and incantations, but all to no effect. We heard that at the Treasure Monastery there is an immortal who can foreknow the future. We have come specially to pray. Pray direct us, that we may petition rightly. If there is response, all the people will be grateful." Danyang said, "Praying for rain is a great matter; I do not know if my master can respond. I will lead you in to ask."

Danyang went first, the crowd followed, and they reached the alchemical chamber of Chongyang. The crowd knelt and earnestly petitioned, describing the drought and praying for rain. Chongyang lowered his head in silence, sat a while, then spoke, "At noon tomorrow, there will be great rain." The crowd all kowtowed and departed. Some believed the immortal’s words would surely come true; some disbelieved, saying they merely asked him for words to satisfy the crowd and avoid their annoyance. The people’s words were confused and discordant.

The next morning the sun rose red and bright. Until near noon suddenly thunder roared and lightning flashed, and heavy rain poured for half a day. Truly:

After long sunshine comes sweet rain,  
All things revived and born anew.

All in the prefecture praised this, each rejoicing, saying truly an immortal had descended. All admired him. No more is told.

It is told that in Wendeng County of this prefecture there was an elder named Hao Lin, courtesy name Bu’ao, Dao sobriquet Tianran, born in the year Gengshen of the reign of Emperor Xizong of Jin, on the third day of the tenth month. From youth he delighted in the Way, wisdom innate. He had a younger brother named Jin. His parents passed on in succession. His family was rich and honored, hereditary commanders. He delighted in reading the Book of Changes and skilled in divination. At that time he held command in the city, led troops to pursue bandits, and fought a battle at Haikou losing many soldiers. Hao Lin fled alone in disorder. The pursuing bandits pressed close, when suddenly a black mist arose, veiling all forms before him, so that he escaped back in safety. Returning to camp, he reflected, "This time it was Heaven’s pity that raised this black mist; how else could I have returned alive?" Seeing the dangers of official life and the vanity of the dusty world, riches and honours like a dream of the southern branch; princes and ministers like bubbles floating on water. Seeing through worldly ties, he resigned and handed family affairs to his brother Jin. At twenty-five he abandoned home to seek the Way, carrying two hundred taels of silver, bidding his brother farewell, and hid in the forest of divination.

He sought everywhere for three years but met no clear master. At last he came to Ninghai city, sat in a teahouse, and suddenly heard one and all praising, "A true immortal has descended!" Hao Lin asked the reason, and learned the story of Master Chongyang. He thought, "I have sought for three years without finding a true master; now here is such a great man. If I do not seek him, would I not miss my chance?" He left the teahouse and came to Quanzhen Monastery. Entering the monastery, he looked up and saw a fine great temple. He went to the guest hall and sat, where a young Daoist boy brought tea. Tianran asked, "Who is the head here?" The boy answered, "Master Ma is in charge." Tianran said, "Please ask Master Ma to come out and see me." The boy soon returned with a Daoist, hair tied in three coils, wearing a crane cloak, three strands of slight beard, about forty years old, evidently the head, who hastened to rise.

Ma Danyang came into the guest hall and saw a man under thirty, with clear brows and bright eyes, a kindly countenance. He thought, "This man surely comes to seek the Way." He stepped forward and saluted, "Sir, from what place do you hail? Your surname and great name?" Tianran quickly returned the bow, saying, "I am a humble man from Wendeng County, surname Hao, given name Lin, courtesy Bu’ao, sobriquet Tianran. May I ask your surname and Dao name?" Danyang said, "I am Ma, courtesy Danyang. May I ask your purpose in coming to this humble monastery?" Tianran answered, "Not to hide from Master Ma, I have delighted in the Way from youth and loved the cinnabar scriptures. Now feeling the vanity of worldly ties, I have abandoned home to seek the Way, seeking a true master for three years without meeting one. What I have seen are all false externally and inwardly, men of fame and gain, or wayward pretenders, none worthy of the Way. Now in Ninghai city I have heard that at the Treasure Monastery there is a Master Chongyang, whose virtue is high and who can foreknow the future. I have come specially to seek an audience. I wonder if I may be allowed to see him?" Danyang said, "My master has always disliked noise and clamor. Now seeing you come from far away seeking the Way, how could he refuse to see you? I will accompany you to see master."

The two went to the alchemical chamber of Chongyang. Danyang pointed, "This is the one." Tianran looked up and saw this old Daoist had a broad forehead and brows, a proud nose and square mouth, a full black beard, a majestic bearing like Mount Tai, a body like an aged pine, lips like vermilion, eyes with a divine light. "This man is surely not a mere Pengdao immortal, but a celestial guest of the Ten Continents. I have sought for three years and never met such an immortal bearing the Way. Now to meet him is a blessing of three lives, a good fate long prepared. If I do not take mastership, then when?" Turning to Danyang he said, "I have come to seek mastership and ordination, not for idle wandering. I hope you will be my introducer, and explain to master." Danyang said, "If so, do not stand long; I will enter and report to master."

He went before master and bowed, "I report, Master: a gentleman from Wen county, named Hao Lin, courtesy Bu’ao, has come to seek mastership and ordination. I beg your great mercy to decide." Chongyang said, "Call him in." Danyang turned and called, "Master Hao, my master bids you enter." Tianran obeyed and entered the alchemical chamber, knelt, and said, "I truly have abandoned home to seek the Way, seeking a clear master. For three years I have not met one. Today to see your honored presence is my good fortune of three lives. I humbly beseech master’s great mercy to save me, and I shall never forget master’s grace."

Chongyang looked upon him and indeed saw some immortal bones: this man in time would become a true immortal. He then spoke, "Cultivating the Way is indeed a bitter road; without true resolve, it is not easily travelled. I see you are a man of official rank, accustomed to luxury and wealth — riding high carriages and fine horses, eating rare delicacies, wearing silks and brocades, dwelling in red chambers and warm pavilions. The life of a monk is a thousand kinds of hardship, a hundred trials and demons; it is not easy. I think you cannot endure such suffering. Return home to enjoy your wealth and honor; practice expediently to accumulate hidden merit, and cultivate the causes and effects of future lives. That is a path of cultivating cause. Why must you take ordination and suffer these vexations? What benefit is there?"

Tianran said, "If I were to love wealth and honor and refuse to leave office and home, I would not have sought mastership and ordination after three years’ pursuit. Now having come to ordination, I desire the great Way of longevity and seeing long life, the formula for the golden elixir — I fear no hardship or suffering, I am willing." Chongyang said, "If you are determined to take ordination and suffer hardship, you must establish a great, strong resolve, and never slacken your heart from beginning to end; you must not violate the master’s purity regulations, but carefully observe the highest laws, watchful and diligent, never departing from your mind. Be clear and pure, and know the original true nature. Do not weary your form, do not shake your essence, do not let your thoughts busy themselves with schemes; only so can you attain longevity. To seek longevity, one must first take the three refuges, then keep the five precepts, and only then can the Way be heard. I shall change your name to Datong, courtesy Taigu, sobriquet Guangning. On an auspicious day you shall change your appearance, donning the robes and style of a Daoist disciple." As the saying goes:

To cultivate the person one must rely on external practice;  
Internal and external both refined, the Way may be hoped for.  
When the mind is refined to hold no single thing,  
The moonlight will shine all day on Mount Sumeru.
