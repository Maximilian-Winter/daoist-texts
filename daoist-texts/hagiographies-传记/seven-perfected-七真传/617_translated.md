# Chapter Eighteen: Liu Changsheng Abandons Illusory Appearances at Fuzhou — Master Changchun Returns from the Snowy Mountains

A Poem:

Once recalled in years of old, the herb-gathering elder sought the profound and pursued the Way, awakening to the true void.  
His transformations pierced through all contrivances, his restless mind settled; the subtle principles perfectly harmonized, his wayward thoughts calmed.  
He consumed the dark demons, transcending the world of men; refined the yang essence, escaping the cage.  
From henceforth he breaks the net of Heaven, joyful and free, soaring astride the crane on high.

It is said that the Perfected One Qiu Changchun, having taken leave of the multitude of disciples at the Palace of Supreme Fortune, arrived at the territory of Muzhou, where he met Song Piyun and Li Lingyang. The three encountered one another. Though unacquainted by sight, each knew the other was a man of the Way; they exchanged names and learned that Lingyang was a friend of Zhongyang, and Piyun a disciple of Danyang. Li Lingyang had himself, together with Tong He Yushan and Wang Zhongyang, formed a hermitage to cultivate together; having perfected the elixir, each went forth to establish merit, wandering far and wide. Unexpectedly, here they met Changchun and Piyun, and the three showed mutual respect. Song Piyun, knowing Changchun to be his senior uncle, in the manner of a disciple, bowed and said, “I have long heard your words, and the name of my senior uncle is inscribed upon the Purple Register; your virtue surpasses Heaven and Man. At last I am able to behold you.” Changchun hastened to detain him, asking, “Your master Danyang, together with Buer, ascended on cranes in Luoyang, Henan. I have heard you have all received his true instructions; indeed, your Way will be perfected.” Piyun replied, “My master transmitted the Way to Li Dacheng, Zhao Penglai, Han Qingfu, and others who have not yet accomplished it. Only through my diligent cultivation and bitter refining for twelve years was I able to transcend the body, to spirit transformation. I owe firstly my master’s great grace, secondly the protection of my senior uncle. I have heard that at Longchuan there is one Lanqiao, who having failed the imperial examinations, retired to Mount Huo, where he played the iron flute and met a wild singer, who was borne on high.” Changchun said, “Envy not the merits of others; accumulate your own功 and deeds, and await the heavenly talisman. When功 is completed and行 fulfilled, you will be many times more excellent. Now Liu Changsheng has perfected功 and returned to the void; I intend to journey to Fuzhou for a visit.”  

Lingyang and Piyun also gladly accompanied him. We forbear to relate further.

In the year of Gengshen, the Song Emperor issued an edict to retain the Chief Junior Protector, who then retired and passed away. In the third month, the former compiler of the Secret Pavilion, Zhu Xi, died at the age of seventy-one. On that day great winds uprooted trees and floods caused landslides. Zhu Xi explained the Four Books and compiled the Outline and Details of the Comprehensive Mirror. In the eighth month, the Retired Emperor passed away. In winter, Empress Han died.

In the year of Xinyou, the Song changed its reign title to Jiatai. A great fire in Lin’an lasted four days before being extinguished. At that time Zhang Daoqing in Western Shu received the Way from Master Tan, who then went forth wandering, while Zhang remained, cultivating ten years in the Nine Palaces Mountain; his Way accomplished, his spiritual manifestations were unfathomable. The Song Emperor, suffering illness, repeatedly summoned him; by talisman water he was healed immediately and was granted the title Zhenjun. At this time he reported, “This autumn a great drought, laws must be relaxed to return to Heaven.” He also said, “The Yelü clan will perish; this is due to their wild folly, take heed.” At this time the Western Liao Zhilu tribe went hunting; the barbarian king lay in ambush and suddenly captured them. Liao was extinguished.

In the spring of the year Renshu, the court minister Jing died. Tao Zhou was promoted to Grand Preceptor; hearing that Liu Chuxuan lectured on Scripture at Fuzhou, he wished to inquire of his Way. The Perfected Liu on the sixth day of the second month sounded the drum and summoned the multitude, declaring, “Hanzi Tao Zhou’s murderous plot is raging; he seeks the Way. Can such a man be heard? I intend to attend the Immortal Master’s appointment; you all must not slacken your true cultivation. I am about to depart!” At that time Changchun, Piyun, and Lingyang were approaching; Perfected Liu, seeing them, clasped hands and bade farewell, saying, “Your功 is complete and your Way perfect; your ascension day is near. This morning I take leave; we shall meet again.” Then he bent his arm swiftly and dissolved. He left behind works entitled Immortal Music, Great Void, Pan Yang, Common Dust, Leisure, and Cultivation of the True, in six volumes, as well as a poem of forty characters for posterity, called the Mountain Faction:

To think on the Way reveals benevolent virtue,  
Restores the perfected nature to its constant state.  
Eminent in harmony, propriety, and righteousness,  
Succession of faithfulness, guarding loyalty and goodness.  
Broad humility favours the virtuous and the peaceful,  
Clan and friends flourish with auspiciousness.  
Great benefit seeks sincerity and simplicity,  
Profound origin flourishes through the ages.

The disciples, having prepared the body of their master, three days later opened the coffin to bury him. The coffin was as light as if empty. When the lid was lifted, only garments, caps, and hairpins remained. Changchun said: “Elder brother Liu has already shed his corpse; we should bury these garments and such, as a proof of the immortal’s trace.” After burial, the disciples dispersed to their conversions. Officials reported to the Song Emperor: Liu Chuxuan has transformed and departed, and was granted the title Assistant Transformation Perfected. At that time Tao Zhou petitioned to posthumously ennoble Yue Fei as King of E.

In the year Yichou, the Song changed its reign title to Kaixi.

In summer of the year Bingyin, Wu Xi, the military governor of Xingzhou, rebelled and offered lands of four prefectures to the Jin. At that time in the Xia state, Li Anquan deposed the ruler Chunyou and established himself as King Xiangzong. In the tenth month, the Jin established Wu Xi as King of Shu. That winter, the Mongol Qiwo Wen Temüjin proclaimed himself Emperor Genghis Khan and established the reign title Shengwu. It is said that the Mongols had formerly a daughter named Ri Alan, widowed in the northern desert, who was often illuminated by heavenly light upon her belly, bearing three sons in succession: the eldest Bo Wan Hedaji, the next Bo Jisachi, and the third Bo Duan Cha’er. Only Cha’er was remarkable in appearance, heavy and taciturn; people called him a fool, but his mother said, “This son is no fool; his descendants will surely be greatly noble.” Their tribe paid tribute to Liao and Jin, yet were under the command of the Tatars. Nine generations later, Su Gai attacked the Tatars, escorted their chief back to Tieliwen Panduo Mountain, and there begat a son named Qiwo Wen Temüjin. Su Gai died; Temüjin was young, and many followers joined the Taichiwu tribe. When Temüjin grew in wisdom and stratagem, he and his mother Yuelun gathered their followers and fought the Taichiwu tribe, winning a great victory. He then attacked the Naiman, and the Sun Khagan was defeated and slain; all his followers submitted to Temüjin. The tribes, seeing his intelligence and bravery, all came under his command. They held a great assembly on the plain of the Onan River, and he ascended the throne declaring himself emperor.

In the spring of the year Dingmao, the Jin generals considered attacking the Song, while the Song executed Wu Xi. That winter, Shi Miyuan killed Tao Zhou and presented his head to the Jin. On the day Wuchen, the Song changed its reign title to Jiading. Shi Miyuan was made Right Chancellor. That year the Jin ruler Jing died, and King Weiyongji ascended, changing the reign title to Da’an. In the fourth year of Shengwu of the Mongols, Temüjin conquered the tribes and greatly invaded Jin territory.

In the year Xinwei, the Xia ruler Anquan died, and his kinsman Zunxu succeeded as King Shenzong, changing the reign title to Guangding.

Now it happened that Perfected Qiu Changchun, having returned from Fuzhou, took up residence again at the Chongfu Palace. The Song and Jin repeatedly sent envoys to summon him, but he did not respond. Changchun said to the disciples, “If I stay here, the Song envoys may come again, which is inconvenient. I observe purple light shooting from the East; I intend to journey eastward.” So he took several disciples and went east. All the fellows in the palace wept and knelt in farewell, begging the master to return soon. Seeing their sincere sorrow, Changchun said, “You must not grieve; in three years I shall return. All must carefully guard the pure rules, advance in virtue, and not disobey my instructions. I now go.” They accompanied him for ten li and then returned.

The master and his disciples came to the provincial city of Shandong, where there was an ancient temple called the Palace of Primeval Beginning. The Perfected dwelt there. After three years, by the protection of the natural Dharma Guardian, the temple was restored and renamed the Heavenly Longevity Sanctuary. Suddenly the Jin envoys came also with tribute and summons; the master knew the Jin state was about to end and refused their summons, returning to the Chongfu Palace in Henan. The disciples welcomed him joyfully. Zhao Xujing said, “Master, after you went east, the Song envoys came twice again; we each used the excuse of wandering beyond the world.” Changchun said, “I was at the Heavenly Longevity Sanctuary; the Jin envoys likewise came with tribute; how could I consent?”

While the master and disciples were conversing on matters of state, suddenly a Tibetan monk came to pay respects. Changchun questioned his purpose, and it was the envoy of the Chan Master of Snowy Mountain White Clouds. The Tibetan presented a letter; Changchun opened it and read that, on account of his own old age and weakness, he could not come to the Immortal’s presence to seek the Way. Perfected Changchun read it, detained the envoy some days, and then wrote a reply for him to take back to Snowy Mountain, stating:

I have secretly heard that Shijia came east to seek the Way, and that Xizhu became perfected; Kasyapa crossed the Ganges to teach men, arriving at the garden to hear the Dharma. All proceeded by austere practice through the human gate, thoroughly accomplishing non-action and right understanding. The Golden Elixir and relics are indeed the same in essence, differing only in name; the making of a Buddha and the becoming an Immortal are differently spoken but the Way is the same. The Lotus Sutra records the arts of the Three Vehicles passing the barrier, for careful study; and in the Zhou Yi’s meaning is revealed the mechanism of the nine and two to see the dragon, its principles likewise clear and distinct. Even in my Journey to the West, the waxing and waning of yin and yang, the return of water men, the mingling of lead and mercury, and the furnace’s fire times are all fully recorded. Now your nature is skillful in accomplishment, your fate somewhat heard; you are able to exhaust the alchemical scriptures and also cultivate virtue and deeds. When功 is perfect and the Way complete, you may know that supreme bliss is not far; when nature is clear and heart bright, then you’ll know that the mountain retreat is near. Reflect, reflect.

On the outside was written “Letter of Master Changchun.” Thus the Tibetan was sent back to his country. We forbear to relate further.

Now, the Perfected Chen Cuixu, after parting with Bai Yuchan, journeyed north to Jiangyin. There was a peasant family named Sha, who for generations delighted in giving alms and doing good deeds, accumulating dark功. Cuixu feigned to be a mendicant and entered their house, seeing one there engaged in盘栊, and composed a verse:

All day round and round, ever turning,  
A middle road leads to the mud pellet.  
Grinding again and again—how many times?  
Within, no axe, chisel, or drill.

When the song was done, a youth ran out from the door, hastened forward, and prostrated, saying, “I am dull and ignorant, but have long sought the Way with a humble heart. Today to meet the Immortal Master here is my fortune of three lifetimes. I beg the true master to save me; I shall never forget the grace of my master.” Cuixu said, “How dost thou know this?” The youth said, “The Immortal Master’s words are each full of subtle meaning; his spirit is clear and fresh, his eyes shining with insight. He is not the Perfected of Pengying, but surely an immortal of the Jade Palace. How could he be concealed?” Cuixu knew him to be a vessel of the Way, retained him for two months, naming him Zhexu. At first, he transmitted to him the Way of Return to Origin and Completion of Destiny, then instructed him in the principle of the Golden Elixir and Return to the Elixir. When about to part, he said, “The Jin will perish; the Song will return to the undifferentiated qi. Only then may you go forth and walk the Way.” Zhexu begged for a date of meeting again; Chen said, “When your elixir is perfected, you may go south; then we will meet at Mount Luofu. I shall enter the Zhang River and dissolve.” Zhexu bowed farewell and after five li returned to his home, diligently cultivating the supreme Way, unwavering in resolve. After five years of refining, he naturally obtained the union of lead and mercury. We forbear to relate further.

In the summer of the year Guiyou, the Jin changed its reign title to Zhineng. Yelü Liugo took the Liaodong prefectures, styling himself King of Liao. In May, the Mongols defeated the Jin army at Mount Jin. That autumn, Jin general Hushu Hu assassinated King Yongji and enthroned Prince Sheng, brother of Zhangzong, who became Emperor Xuanzong, changing the reign title to Zhenyou.

Now it is told that Perfected Tan Changzhen, after manifesting divine transformations in Western Shu, travelled everywhere to accumulate功. At this time he journeyed to Lin’an, where he saw a great fire raging half a day; the Perfected, moved with compassion, exerted great wisdom-power to rescue the fire and reverse the winds. Seeing the fate of the Song was near, he turned to wander in the south. Hearing that Qiu Changchun was teaching the Way in Henan and greatly propagating the sect’s spirit, and that his virtue and fame were heard throughout the countries, with both Song and Jin sending envoys several times who were all refused, he knew the southward fortune would decline and so did not respond to the summons; truly a man who knew the moment, one worthy to be a master for all ages. He desired to meet in the Central Plains, and so went to the Palace of Supreme Fortune.

Changchun was already aware of Changzhen’s coming and urgently sent disciples five li out to welcome him. Changzhen, knowing Changchun’s Way was already lofty, went with the crowd to the Palace of Supreme Fortune. Changchun came out of the palace to greet him and led him into the main hall. After mutual greetings, all came to pay respects. Changchun said, “I have heard that elder brother long ago accomplished the Way and became a celestial immortal. Now your immortal carriage has arrived, truly a rare occurrence.” Tan Changzhen then related how he became perfected in Western Shu, travelled the world, accumulated功, and awaited summons. “Now hearing that brother Changchun’s virtue is lofty and his name renowned throughout the countries, I cannot contain my joy, and therefore have come specially to meet.” Changchun said, “Brother’s功 is complete and Way perfect; your ascension day is near. As for myself, my virtue is thin and my sins deep; I have done no success in the Way and fear I cannot escape the suffering of rebirth.” Changzhen laughed, saying, “Brother’s功 is high at the Purple Mansion; your virtue crowns Heaven and Man. You transform the various Hu in the west, all call you the living Buddha of Zhendan; you expound to Jin and Song in the east, all call you Perfected of Complete Virtue. Great vessels mature late; how can such功 and行 be compared with small功 and small行?” Changchun said, “I am honoured by your praise, but how dare I bear it? I suppose your outward行 is all complete, and inwardly truly perfect; you need not labor yourself but may stay here and await summons for ascension. What think you?” Changzhen said, “I desire to go to Zhongnan to gather master friends; I cannot stay long here. When brother’s功 is perfected and fruition complete, we shall meet again. From now, farewell.” Changchun said, “Brother but newly arrived, how can you depart so soon? Stay here a few days more; moreover, we have parted many years and much important discourse remains to be exchanged.” So Tan Changzhen rested several days at the Palace of Supreme Fortune.

Changzhen took leave; Changchun desired to detain him but could not, saying, “Brother, on your journey you will surely meet our master and elder brothers; please convey my many bows. Moreover, on your way you will pass the Western Peak; I have a disciple Yin Qinghe residing at Mount Shaohua in Huazhou; I trouble you to bring a letter and entrust some words to him.” Tan Changzhen took the letter and bade farewell, heading west to Qin Chuan. Changchun and company escorted him for three li before returning.

We forbear to relate how Tan Changzhen left Changchun and went west.

Now Yin Qinghe was a man of Longxi, who in his home studied the classics. One day he awoke to the illusions of the dust and the vanity of the world’s affairs; he resolved to abandon home and seek the Way with a bitter heart. He sought out Dragon Gate Cave; at that time Master Changchun was returning from the west, and Qinghe sought transmission, slightly receiving the profound secret. He then journeyed east to Chang’an, and reaching the territory of Huazhou, saw Mount Shaohua, clear and secluded, and built a hut there to cultivate diligently, his nature and ground becoming quite bright. One day, at leisure, while wandering, he saw a Way-fellow float down. Seeing his Daoist bearing and immortal spirit, his spirit and aura lofty and strange, he thought, “This man is not a fairy of the Three Isles, but surely a divine man of Pengying.” He hastened forward and kowtowed, saying, “I have long beheld the Perfected coming down to the wild mountain; I am late to meet you; I beg the master’s forgiveness.”

Tan Changzhen, seeing this Way-fellow clear and bright in spirit, with some immortal bone, asked, “Are you not Yin Qinghe?” Qinghe answered, “At once on meeting, you know my name; master is truly a Golden Immortal!” He hastily bowed down, saying, “How fortunate I am, today to meet the Perfected descending. I beseech you, Perfected, open your heart of universal salvation and save me from my sea of suffering. I wish the master to point out a single thread of mystery, to advance me on the path of truth; if one day the great Way is perfected, I shall never forget the grace of my master.”

Changzhen stepped forward and helped him up, saying, “You have already received the instructions of Changchun; though you have not yet accomplished the Way, the elixir is in sight. Yesterday I passed Mount Song’s Palace of Supreme Fortune and met your master, who entrusted me with a letter to bring to you. You should open and read it; it will surely benefit you. If some mystery is lacking, later you may seek the master’s instruction. Do not worry; your accomplishment of the Way has a fixed time.” Then he took the letter from his bosom and gave it to Qinghe, saying, “I should stay here to converse with you and discuss the profound功, but I must go to Zhongnan on business and cannot tarry. You must diligently cultivate, accumulate功 and merits. From now, farewell; we shall meet again.” Then he floated away.

Qinghe wished to detain him but could not; he bowed and saw him off for three li, then silently turned back to his hut, lost in sorrow. As the saying goes:

If resolve is not firm, cease discussing the Way;  
If the dust-laden heart is not pure, do not speak of profundity.  
If fame and profit are taken as reality,  
How can one ascend to fly in the nine heavens?

If you desire to know what became of Yin Qinghe, listen to the next chapter unfold.
