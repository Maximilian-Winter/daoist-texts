# Chapter Nineteen: The Mongol Emperor Issues an Edict Seeking the Way and Virtue; Qiu Changchun Expounds the Mystery before the Court

The Poem saith:

In times when men forsake the world, and learn to seek the Mystery,  
It is meet that within its depths they fix their purpose and apply themselves.  
Set not thy heart on things without, but seek to hold the lead within the water.  
The man of merit without the Way is but a dust-bound guest;  
The man of Way without merit is but an earth-bound immortal.  
If then thou dost refine the elixir and also accumulate virtue,  
What fear is there lest thou shalt not ascend to the Great Luo Heaven?

Now it came to pass that Yin Qinghe, after seeing the Immortal Tan depart, returned to his humble cottage, as if in a dream or intoxication. After a while, he opened the letter left by his master and read therein:

“Generally speaking, to cultivate the person and discern the Way, there must be dependence upon the accumulation of practice and the piling up of merit.  
If the mind be not resolute and steadfast, it is difficult to transcend the common and the sage.  
Some apply themselves in the school, stirring much worldly trouble;  
Some begin from the heart, casting away all worldly affairs.  
But if one can restrain self and preserve the mind in the Way, this is the foundation of the attainment of blessing.

Yet the Way encompasses Heaven and Earth; its greatness is hard to measure.  
Small virtues and small merits, in the end, are hard to show effect.  
Therefore, to attain the Way in a moment, one must rely on long ages of refining and polishing;  
To suddenly enlighten the one mind, one must depend upon perfect cultivation of myriad practices.  
The present world’s attainment of the Way is but the fruit of merits of former lives.  
But not knowing the cause in former lives, men see only the long years and bitter effort, but no success; thinking the mysterious功 (gong) vain and false, they forthwith lose heart — this is indeed to be lamented.  
Little do they know that in walking, standing, sitting, and lying down, preserving the mind in the Way, though not manifesting momentary enlightenment, it is all because the accumulation of功 and the piling up of practice are insufficient.  
Thus the incompleteness of the Way is like a man possessing a great precious bright pearl, valued by millions, which I wish to buy, but my money is insufficient;  
I must by day and night endeavour, be frugal and diligent, gather money, accumulate little by little.  
Though reaching thirty or fifty thousand, the money is still lacking; the pearl cannot be obtained until the sum reach a million.  
The gathering of money is for present use only.  
As compared to a poor household, there is a gulf as wide as cloud and mud.  
So too with the accumulation of功 and practice.  
Though the Way be not yet attained, the roots of goodness are deep and weighty; whether in this life or the next, there will be sages to assist, and naturally the day will come when the Way is perfected.  
Without roots of goodness and affinity from former lives, seeking it is but afar.  
Only when encountering hardship does one lose heart; when meeting wealth and honour, does one kindle greed.  
Though one be an immortal, he cannot save thee.  
But if with bitter resolve and diligent cultivation, without losing heart or becoming lax, steadfast and unshaken in mind,  
Though not attaining it in this life, surely in the next and subsequent lives, by accumulations of practice, there will be immortals to assist, and ultimately thou shalt arrive at full understanding.

I myself have no such affinity in past lives; though meeting a wise master, enduring myriad hardships, even now I have not attained.  
Dan-yang’s Chang-zhen and others all possess such affinity, and within ten or five years, fly freely beyond Heaven.  
Though I have not attained, the hardships I undergo are also unlike those of common men.  
The Patriarch said: ‘Whosoever pursues the Way must first leave his family, then his own body.  
When功 is not reached, sickness teaches sickness;  
When道業 (career in the Way) is incomplete, death teaches death.  
At last, at the moment of death, embrace the Way and depart, leaving all to Heaven’s decision, unable to strengthen self.’  
This is the highest truth, for students to ponder.

When Qinghe finished reading, he sighed without end; from that time he increased his thoughts of the Way, accumulating功 and merit, diligently cultivating day and night, seeking the proof of the mysterious功; ever mindful, watching over the cauldron and furnace for refining medicines.  
He took in disciples singly and in groups, gathering many men of worth;  
Gathered herbs to aid the world, benefiting the sick.  
Going to the busy markets and rising from the mountains and forests, he kept only the mind to benefit men and things, fearing not labour or hardship;  
Only with the will to cook lead and refine mercury, he pondered the vanity of the dusty world.  
Thus he practised for more than ten years, never taking a seat at his side nor tasting sweet delicacies.  
Later he met the Immortal Lady Geng, who seeing his austere practice, imparted the supreme Way; he sat motionless three years and attained to see his original nature.  
Thus the Way of the Elixir was consummated, and he travelled wide to convert others. This is not here set forth.

Now the Mongol Temüjin, in the autumn of the year guiyou, advanced his troops to Yanjing, took Zhuozhou, and stationed his army at Yan.  
Having long heard the name of Qiu Chuji, he desired to summon him to inquire after the Way.  
After seven days of fasting and purification, he sent forth an edict as follows:

‘The decree saith: Heaven is displeased with Central China; the proud and arrogant nature of the Supreme Ultimate.  
I dwell in the Northern wilds, cherishing the feeling of unarisen desire;  
Returning to simplicity and honesty, abandoning luxury and following frugality,  
Each garment and each meal I share with ox-herds and horse-keepers alike.  
I look upon the people as infants, nurture the soldiers as brothers.  
I plan for lasting peace, and think to gather in unity.  
I train the multitude, leading by my own example; facing a hundred battles, I think not of self.  
Within seven years the great work will be accomplished, and within the six directions all will be unified.  
If this be not by my own virtue, then the government of gold is unstable.  
Therefore I accept Heaven’s aid, and assume this exalted position.  
To the south lie the Man and Song, to the north the Huihe, to the east the Xia, to the west the barbarians, all bow in submission.  
I think of the State of the Chanyu; in a thousand generations there has been none such as I.

Yet to entrust great offices, and keep peace, I fear there are still gaps.  
As the man who carves a boat to cross a river, and seeks worthy men for assistants to secure the realm.  
Since I assumed the throne, I have laboured diligently on state affairs, yet among the three Nine ranks, none is fit.  
I have heard of Master Qiu, who embodies the True and walks the Rule, is versed in many things and wide in hearing, explores the profound and exhausts the principle;  
His Way is pure and his virtue manifest; he bears the stern manner of the ancient sages, the elegant conduct of the True Man; long dwelling in the mountains and valleys, hiding voice and form, expounding the Patriarch’s bequest;  
Sitting he gathers men of the Way; the path of the immortals is thronged beyond count.  
Since the wars, I have known the Master to still be hidden in the old regions of Shandong.  
My heart longs for him without end.  
Is it not said of the Wei River and the three visits to the thatched cottage?  
Alas, the mountains and rivers are vast; I have failed in the ceremony of personal greeting.  
I but humble myself, avoid my place, and purify by fasting and bathing; I select the attendant Liu Zhonglu, prepare light horse and plain carriage, and come many thousands of li, respectfully inviting the Master, asking him to bend his immortal steps, not caring for the distance of desert and wilderness, either out of concern for the world’s present troubles, or out of care for my own preservation.  
I myself shall attend upon the Immortal Seat, earnestly hoping that after a cough or a word from the Master, he will grant but a single word, and this shall suffice.

Now I send this faint intention in writing, hoping that the Master, having shown the beginning of the great Way, will respond generously and not deny the small wishes of all beings.  
Therefore I send this edict for information and careful consideration.

Fifth month, first day.’

When the edict was complete, Liu Zhonglu was ordered to bear it and depart. The road dust is not told.

Now Master Qiu was at the Chongfu Palace, where the mysterious influence daily grew and the religion flourished.  
One day, ascending the hall, he discoursed on the Way and Virtue, showing to the multitudes: ‘Life in the world is as a fish swimming in water, at ease and carefree;  
But seeking fame and profit is like the fish swallowing the hook, not knowing the illusion.  
Once caught on the hook, in the hour of the knife and the boiling pot, regret will be too late!  
If one does not quickly turn and examine oneself, time passes swiftly, and all is change.  
Now I see that you who have left the world, yet will not cultivate功 or repair the Way, sitting idle in faith and almsgiving, but not speaking of accomplishment in this world, in the next life the debtors will be hard to repay.  
There is yet another class who believe not in cause and effect of sin and blessing; having left the world, they add guilt;  
Fall into sickness and madness, yet do not repent, but slander others, their guilt is the heaviest.  
Such will die and fall into hell, with no escape.  
He who cultivates the person must first be broad in learning and then restrain reason; first gather the heart and then release the heart.  
Broad learning is to see widely, knowing the Way of human relations and worldly affairs;  
Restraining reason is to expel selfishness, and comprehend the source of nature and creation.  
Gathering the heart is to cut off passion and desire, to cleanse away杂念, so that thinking does not arise;  
Releasing the heart is to fear no mind fall into phantom emptiness, lest it be bound and caught by the demon of attachment; therefore let it enter the realm of Great Void and await the work of creation.  
The saying is to exhaust reason and nature to the utmost and so reach life; then one can nourish life, preserve the body, roam and feast in the Jade Capital and Golden Gates, and ride with the Void Emperor.  
Now men do not understand the Way of human relations and worldly affairs, yet seek the Heavenly Way; this is like the blind who do not use a staff, the deaf who hear no tones, seeking to catch rabbits in water or fish on mountain — how can they attain it?  
The Way of human relations is no more than what Huang Shigong said:  
“The Way, Virtue, Benevolence, Righteousness, and Propriety are one body.”  
The Way is what man treads, whereby all things know not their origin.  
Virtue is what man obtains, whereby all things get their desire.  
Benevolence is what man esteems, having the heart of kindness and compassion to promote their growth.  
Righteousness is what man should do, rewarding good and punishing evil to establish功 and事.  
Propriety is what man follows, rising early and sleeping late, to complete the order of human relations.  
If one would be the foundation of man, one cannot lack any of these.  
The wise and noble understand the Way of rise and fall, the numbers of success and failure, the forces of peace and disorder, the principle of coming and going; therefore they dwell concealed and hold the Way, awaiting the time.  
If the time come and they act, they can reach the height of ministerial rank;  
If the opportunity arise and they move, they can achieve peerless功.  
If not met, they die in obscurity.  
Therefore their Way is lofty and their name honoured by posterity.  
Thus the Way of human relations is understood.  
Once the Way of human relations is clear, the Heavenly Way is not far.’

Whilst Changchun was discoursing, suddenly a report came from outside: ‘An envoy from the Mongols has arrived.’  
The Master rose and went out to receive him.  
Liu Zhonglu, seeing the Master’s noble bearing, hastened forward with respect; both entered the guest hall, seating host and guest apart.  
Changchun asked: ‘Pray, whence cometh the noble envoy? What important matter brings him to the old capital?’  
Liu Zhonglu answered: ‘Your servant’s name is Liu Zhonglu. Now I bear the imperial edict of our lord Genghis Khan, summoning Master Qiu to go north.  
My lord sincerely seeks the Way and worthy men, having long heard that Master Qiu’s virtue is lofty; therefore specially dispatches me with this edict.  
I humbly entreat the Master to graciously consent, so as not to disappoint my lord’s sincere intention.’  
Then he presented the imperial edict.

Master Qiu took it and, opening it, read it through; then said to Liu Zhonglu: ‘I am but a rustic man of the mountains and fields.  
Now honoured by the lord, I am truly ashamed; how can I bear this?’  
Liu Zhonglu said: ‘Master’s Way surpasses the three powers, virtue excels nine ranks; your fame spreads through the lands,功 shines among the multitudes.  
Your servant has long looked up with hope, and now sees the immortal countenance; why should the Master modestly refuse?’  
Changchun said: ‘My fame, though spread throughout the realm, is but empty; I am indeed ashamed.  
Formerly gold was offered thrice, the Song five times; all refused.  
Now seeing the lord’s sincerity, and your honour’s distant descent, I cannot disobey the command.  
Pray remain three days in the open palace, I will attend the edict and go with you to Yanjing.’  
Liu Zhonglu rejoiced greatly at the Master’s consent, and lodged at Chongfu Palace awaiting the Master’s departure. This is not further told.

Master Qiu arranged all the public affairs of his residence with exact care; three days passed unawares.  
Liu Zhonglu urged the Master to set out.  
Qiu said that formerly gold was offered thrice and the Song five times, but all had lain quiet; when disciples asked the Master the reason, he said: ‘My coming and going is Heaven’s doing, not for you to know; another day there will be a time when the one who stays cannot remain.’  
Now he answered the edict and journeyed north; all disciples wept, escorting him ten li before returning.  
The summer heat was intense, and the road dusty. This is not further told.

It was now the sixth month; the Jurchen and Mongols, Temüjin’s troops, returned to the desert and left Yanjing.  
Master Qiu travelled with Liu Zhonglu, arriving at Yanjing in the seventh month.  
Suddenly news came that the lord had retired north; Master Qiu and Liu Zhonglu consulted: ‘I see that the lord has already returned north; the journey is long and he cannot be reached for days.  
Moreover the heat is great, and I am old and weak, unable to travel.  
If we remain at Yanjing to await the autumn cool, then go north, what think you, sir?’  
Liu Zhonglu said: ‘My lord thirsts for worthy men, how can he wait?’  
Qiu said: ‘Since you do not consent, I cannot go; I must write a memorial myself.’  
So he composed a memorial, gave it to two eunuchs, and set off north.  
Liu Zhonglu saw Master Qiu submit the memorial and dared not hinder or urge him, but lodged at Yanjing awaiting reply. This is not further told.

Meanwhile, Genghis Khan, having consented to peace with the Jurchen, retired to the Xilingol League, stationing troops and tending horses.  
One day two attendants brought to the emperor Master Qiu’s memorial.  
The emperor opened and read, saying:

‘Emperor Genghis’ Heartfelt Intent:  
Qiu Chuji of Zhidao, Qixia County, reverently receives the imperial command; from afar I issue the edict, but the island-dwelling folk are all confused.  
Chuji reflects that his plans for life are too clumsy; his study of the Way has not succeeded; bitter difficulties without number, old but not dead.  
Though his name is spread across the kingdoms, the Way has not increased among the people.  
He inwardly laments, who can fathom his heart?  
Formerly, Nanjing and the Song repeatedly summoned him without success; now the Dragon Court calls and he comes at once — why is this?

We hear that the emperor is Heaven-given in courage and wisdom, peerless from ancient till now;  
The Way accords with awe-inspiring power; Hua and Yi all submit.  
Therefore he wishes to flee mountains and seas, unwilling to go against this.  
Often braving snow and frost, hoping to appear once more; he also heard that the imperial carriage was but north of Huan-fu.  
But upon arriving at Yanjing, he heard that the carriage had returned; far away by thousands of li of dust and wind, and with the sky yellow and old and weak unable to endure, fearing he might not reach in time, he entrusted the military and state affairs to the emperor, beyond his own ability.  
The heart of Way and Virtue enjoins restraint of desire, all is difficult.  
Therefore consulting with Liu Zhonglu, they agreed it best to stay awhile at Yanjing and other places, waiting and resting, first sending word ahead.  
Liu Zhonglu did not consent; hence the memorial was sent by Master Qiu himself.  
Thinking that Chuji has falsely gained fame, looking wan and haggard, he prays for the holy decision.

The emperor, having read the memorial, knew that Qiu Chuji had come to Yanjing but was delayed by the heat from going north.  
Therefore he issued another edict, sending attendant Gu Yuan-kai with it to Yanjing.  
Gu first saw Master Qiu and presented the reply.  
Qiu opened and read, and the edict said:

‘Emperor Genghis Khan’s Decree to Master Qiu:  
All that thou hast memorialized and the command to come are noted.  
Thou art a master of the Way surpassing the three powers, thy virtue weighty and manifold.  
I have commanded my ministers to send forth thy mysterious radiance to seek thee through the seas afar.  
When thy will accords, Heaven does not oppose.  
Twice before I sent summons, and thou didst not go; but now at one call thou risest.  
I say that it is Heaven’s revelation that thou shouldst come, not fearing exposure to wind or frost, willingly journeying the desert.  
Thy memorial comforts me greatly!  
Military and state affairs are not my concern; the heart of Way and Virtue indeed may be esteemed.  
I considered the rude chieftains unworthy and employed generals instead; the army advanced and the border was pacified.  
Coming and going was by strength and command; after long ease and brief toil, I hope for their submission.  
Thus I display my might and virtue, and briefly halt with my train.  
I remember the cloud pavilion set forth from Penglai, and the crane carriage may roam to Tianzhu.  
Bodhidharma went east, transmitting the law by mind; Laozi went west, perhaps transforming the Hu and attaining the Way.  
Though the route is wide, holding the staff is not far.  
Love thy reply, so as to show my intent.  
In autumn heat, may the Master be safe in Beiping; more need not be said.  
Eighth month, fourteenth day.’

Master Qiu, having read, said to Gu Yuan-kai: ‘Now it is the festival of Chungyang, the heat abated; we may no longer delay lest the autumn wind come suddenly.  
I choose the full moon day of the ninth month to set out; prithee inform Liu Zhonglu.’  
So Yuan-kai took leave of Master Qiu and went to see Liu Zhonglu, agreeing on the date to travel north together.  
They travelled by dawn and rested by night, and in the early winter they entered the capital.  
Liu Zhonglu first went to report and lodged the Master in the guesthouse.  
It was as the verse saith:

The Way is lofty, all under Heaven look up in reverence;  
Virtue weighty, all the myriad people enjoy peace.  
To the west it converts the Hu, to the east it unfolds teaching;  
From this the mysterious influence stirs the great capital.

If thou wouldst know what befell Master Qiu thereafter, listen to the next chapter unfold.
