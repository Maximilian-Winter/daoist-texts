# Chapter Twenty: Master Sun Geng of Mount Gezao Refines the Elixir; Baisha of Chongxu Abbey Escorts Ni

A Poem:

The scholar of the Dao, profound and more profound;  
Attains the utmost Way, refining quicksilver and lead.  
Emperors oft inquire of the secret to longevity,  
Endless is the breathing, ceaseless the air.  
The inner and outer elixirs ascend the Nine Heavens,  
When perfected, all repair to the feast of Fan and Tao.  
From thence the assembly of Peng-ling’s immortals gather,  
Naturally leaping forth beyond the Three Thousand.  
(To the tune of "Mountain Tiger Descends")

It is said that Master Qiu Zhenren rested in his quarters; when the full moon appeared, the Emperor sent forth summons that he appear at the travelling palace. The Emperor, wearied, said: “Master, having come from afar, have you any medicine of longevity with which to benefit me?” The master replied: “I possess no medicine of longevity, but only the Way of preserving health.” The Emperor praised his sincerity, and appointed to inquire further on the eighth day of the twelfth month. Qiu returned to his quarters.  

At this time the Emperor desired to set forth in person against the mountain brigands.  

On the day of the full moon in the first month, the Emperor held a feast in the side hall, placing a vacant seat before the Master’s chair. The Emperor descended the steps in person, bowed, and asked concerning the Way of preserving health. The Master requested the Emperor to resume his seat and listen attentively. Qiu said:  

“The Great Way gives birth to Heaven and nurtures Earth; the Sun, Moon, stars, spirits, and men all arise from the Way. Heaven is Yang; Earth is Yin. Man dwells between them, carrying Yin and embracing Yang. Therefore, the student of the Dao departs from luxury, frugality, and desire, firmly concentrates essence and calms the spirit. As Yin diminishes and Yang is preserved, he ascends to Heaven and becomes an immortal. The foolish hold falsehood as truth, drinking liquor as nectar, indulging their desires, exhausting essence and spirit, Yang declining and Yin prevailing. When they die, they sink to Earth and become ghosts.  

The cultivator of truth is like one rolling a stone up a mountain; the higher the mountain, the harder the advance. With every small step, he stumbles and falls, his former progress undone. Because of this difficulty, the whole world does not undertake it. Originally, the true nature is still as water at rest; but when the eye delights in colour, the ear in sound, the tongue craves taste, the mind clings to affairs, the distractions arise in multitudes, like waves driven by a strong wind. The Daoist cultivates his mind, practicing diligently that nothing attaches; he reduces it again and again until reaching non-action, resembling the still water of the Great Void.  

The Daoist’s body is but the vessel; controlling the mind is difficult. Heaven rules the four seas, the sun steers myriad matters; how easy is it to govern the mind? The ancients, upon establishing heirs and taking wives, then warned to guard against desire. For when a man reaches forty years and above, his blood and qi gradually decline; therefore he should guard against excess. Now Your Majesty is advanced in years; you should cultivate virtue and preserve your body, to prolong your years. Taking medicine is not as good as retiring alone. Medicines are herbs and trees; their essence is like bones and marrow. To wither bone and marrow and then add herbs is like keeping gold in a bag but exchanging it for iron; in time the gold is gone, leaving only iron — what benefit is there in that?  

In food and drink, in rising and resting, in precious playthings and goods, one must observe moderation and not exceed it. The most beautiful lands under Heaven are all Yours; yet warfare continues, scattering the people without gathering them. Select the pure officials to govern, plan accordingly, remit taxes, so that the military and state have sufficient silk for use; let the people recover and rest — one stroke brings two gains. This is the great principle of praying for blessings and long life.”  

The Emperor was greatly pleased, commanded his attendants to write the words down, thanked the Master with ceremony, and withdrew.  

The next day, he inquired about thunder and the shaking of the earth. The Master replied: “I have heard that among the three thousand transgressions none is greater than unfilialness; Heaven warns us by this. Now hearing that many in the realm are unfilial, Your Majesty, wielding your majesty and virtue, can warn the multitudes.” The Emperor was pleased, and caused the Master’s words to be proclaimed and made known to the people.  

On the seventh day of the second month, Master Qiu took leave; the Emperor said: “Pray wait here a few days. Before, the words of your Way I have not fully understood; when my enlightenment comes, I may then permit your departure.” In this month, the Emperor went hunting on the Eastern Mountain, shot a great boar, lost control of his horse’s hoof. The boar stood nearby but dared not advance; attendants brought forward a horse, and after the hunt he returned. Master Qiu heard of this and remonstrated: “Heaven’s Way values life. Now the sage’s longevity is already high, he should hunt less. Your fall from the horse is a warning from Heaven; the boar’s hesitance to advance is Heaven’s protection.” The Emperor said: “I have deeply reflected.” He then addressed his attendants: “But the words of immortals and sages to me, I will follow henceforth.” From then on, he ceased to hunt.  

---

Meanwhile, Master Changchun’s mind was settled; on the seventh day of the third month, he took leave again. The Emperor said: “Your mind is not yet at rest; I dare not detain you forcibly. But the principles of cultivating the person and governing the state are not yet clear to me. Pray indicate a word or two. If one cultivates oneself, the whole body is free from disease and suffering; if the state is well governed, the people enjoy peaceful felicity. Heaven’s heart is in accord; all things prosper. When the people are at peace and the produce abundant, then the realm is tranquil; when heart and body are at ease, the spirits are content. How is it to be governed? This shall suffice.”  

Master Qiu replied: “To cultivate the person is to prolong life by nourishing qi; to attain spiritual communication is to nourish the spirit. Without nourishing primordial qi, longevity is not possible; without nourishing primordial spirit, spiritual communication cannot be attained. One who would cultivate his person must preserve his essence, nourish his qi, and contain his spirit; only then can his essence be sufficient without lust, his qi be sufficient without hunger, his spirit be sufficient without sleep. When the Three Treasures are complete, wind, cold, heat, and dampness cannot enter the body; pestilence, evil, and malevolent spirits cannot harm it. With heart and body at ease, illness does not arise; when spirit and qi intertwine, disasters do not invade. Having deep roots and firm foundations, one attains the way of longevity and prolonged vision.  

So it is with governing the state: no more than this. Regard spirit as ruler, qi as minister, essence as the people, and one body as the realm. If the ruler clearly follows Heaven’s heart, the ministers are upright and the people at peace. When the people are at peace, the realm is rich; when ministers are virtuous, the realm is strong. There is nothing beyond this in governing the state and cultivating the person.  

Now Your Majesty dwells in the seat of ten thousand chariots, ever placing your own person first, exposing yourself to arrows and stones, thus your person is light throughout the realm. This is called preserving the person by not abiding in place. You must be careful.”  

The Emperor was greatly pleased, saying: “The words of the Master are all gold and jade. I deeply reflect.” He offered abundant gifts, which Master Qiu refused to accept. The Emperor commanded Ali Xian to escort the Master eastward; those who saw him off wept in farewell.

On the way back, the Master passed through Juyong and met a host of bandits swarming forth. Ali Xian wished to draw his sword to meet them, but the Master stopped him, saying: “No need for arms; fear of injuring life. I shall transform them by words, that will suffice.” Sitting upon his carriage, the Master clasped hands and addressed the bandits:  

“I am a Daoist from the South, sent by imperial edict into Mongolia, now returning South, bearing no gold, silver, or treasures, only escorting officials. They desired to ride forth for battle, yet feared to harm life; I stopped them. I have heard that those who are bandits must have all seven virtues of the Way, Virtue, Benevolence, Righteousness, Propriety, Wisdom, and Trust, complete; only then can one be called a great bandit. Lacking even one, one is not called a bandit. Without the Dao to establish oneself, the body is not long. Acting contrary to virtue, spirits and men alike hate. Spirits hate those who turn their backs; Heaven’s heart is displeased, and life is hard to preserve. Why bandit so?  

The great bandit establishes himself by the Way, follows Heaven’s heart above, cultivates the people by virtue, his heart not turning back. He harms no innocent, but regards all things and beings as babes — this is benevolence. He rescues each other in hardship; different surnames yet same kin — this is righteousness. He rewards and punishes clearly, sustaining chastity and human relations — this is propriety. He faces the many with the few, winning in peril — this is wisdom. His words fly like arrows, keeping appointments punctually, once promised he does not break them, once given he does not repent — this is trust.  

All who are bandits bear these seven words; with them they preserve themselves and establish a name; careful from beginning to end, there will be no defeat. Robbing the rich to give to the poor, one accumulates merit; striking down the violent and aiding the needy, one cultivates virtue. Living without a foul name, dying as a just spirit. All respect him, all gaze upon him, his fragrant name lasting ten thousand generations — is this not joyful? You men should emulate this; why should you not?”  

The bandits heard the Master’s words, bowed their heads and praised the Way: “This is a man of the Way, words like gold and jade; all should believe them.” They thanked him and departed. Master Qiu rested at Yan, then journeyed south to reside at Tianchang Abbey in Qizhou, Shandong, returning Ali Xian north with his edict. No further record.

Meanwhile, Ma Danyang together with Sun Bu’er and Immortal Geng at Zhongnan parted company with Master Lü. Danyang used thirteen needles to heal people’s diseases, restoring youth and saving the living, performing merits everywhere, upholding the doctrine accordingly. No record here.  

Immortal Geng frequently went to the mountains with Sun Bu’er to gather herbs and aid the world. At that time they toured Mount Heng of the Southern Peaks, gathering herbs at Huiyan Peak, where they met Lady Wei, who led them into the Great Void Cavern Heaven, where they paid homage to Leisurely Ritual Sovereign Guardian Immortal Wei. The Sovereign ordered Fu’e Prefect Cui Yu to host a banquet, inviting Immortal Consort Zhu Ling and Lady Ding Shuying to accompany the Sovereign, commanding the fairy maids to perform music.  

Immortals Sun and Geng advanced and bowed, saying: “We are foolish and inferior, newly entered into the immortal ranks. We are honoured by Lady Wei’s introduction to the Immortal Mansion and to see the Highest Truth, deeply grateful. Moreover, to be granted a grand feast and seats, we dare not accept!”  

Guardian Wei said: “Though ye have newly entered the holy stream, ye shall surely become leaders among the female immortals. Your inner elixirs are already complete, but your external practices are insufficient and must be assisted by external elixirs; only then will your elixirs be perfected to aid the world, your merits fulfilled, and ye able to respond to summons and ascend.”  

The two immortals bowed and requested the principles of the external elixir. Guardian Wei pointed and said: “The workings of the external elixir and its furnace are like those of the internal elixir; they must correspond within and without, only the medicines and weights for refining differ. For those whose internal elixir is not complete, cultivation is difficult. Now that you have completed your internal elixirs, the cooking of the external elixir is easy.”  

Thus they were taught the medicines, weights, additions, and the method of refining. Sun and Geng thanked Guardian Wei, Lady Ding, Lady Wei, and others, who escorted them out of the cavern; the two awaited the completion of the elixir to meet again.  

Sun and Geng bade farewell to Lady Wei, and gathered herbs on Mount Heng. Descending the mountain, they cast their furnace and cauldron. Upon reaching the border of Linjiang Prefecture, they saw Mount Gezao, clear and graceful, the thirty-fourth blessed place under Heaven, the immortal capital of the nine provinces, where the illustrious and mysterious True Lord Xu Xun resides.  

Sun and Geng ascended the mountain, chose a day of pure Yang and proper fire, installed the furnace and set the cauldron, arranging medicines and weights according to the order and position of the Eight Trigrams, kindled the fire and refined. They regulated the fire, refining for forty-nine days until the elixir was made. After taking it, the two immortals felt their inner and outer selves fully opened; they stored the remaining elixir in a jar, descended the mountain, practiced merits everywhere, and again met Lady Wei at Xiangzhou.  

The two immortals saw her and advanced to greet her. Lady Wei said to Sun Bu’er: “You may accumulate merits and await summons. Immortal Geng may accompany me as companion to journey to Mount Jiuyi.” Sun Bu’er bowed in farewell. Lady Wei said: “You will meet Danyang and others at Zhongnan, gather the seven golden lotuses, and follow the Master to report. In future you shall meet at the Jade Pool.” Thus they parted. Immortal Bu’er saw Lady Wei and Geng depart for Jiuyi, and then journeyed east to cultivate merits. No further record.

Meanwhile, Bai Yuchan, having received four hundred characters from Master Ziyang, went to practice cultivation on Mount Wuyi. When the Way was accomplished, he roamed about in the clouds, accumulating merits for several years, and now returned once more to Mount Wuyi. The common folk on this mountain knew nothing of Bai, Zi, and Qing’s attainment of the Way; only Zhan Yanfu of the southern mountain knew, and he rebuilt the Zhi Zhi Hermitage, wishing him to reside. The Master composed an inscription for him, excusing his departure as his travels were unfinished, and promised to return within five years.  

At first, when Master Bai entered Wuyi, none guarded or accompanied him. Suddenly there was a good man, Peng Lü, styled Jiyi, a native of the Three Mountains. From youth he was bright and eager for Dao books. At thirty-two he was selected as a jinshi scholar, then abandoned his household to seek the Dao, diligently studying the mysteries, disliking the court’s petty distinctions and formalities, loving only clarity, emptiness, leisure, and ease. Traveling to Wuyi, seeing the Master’s Way, he served him for several years. After Bai’s elixir was perfected, he transmitted the Way to Peng Lü. After receiving his master’s transmission, he left and dwelt at Crane Forest Daoist Monastery, renaming himself Crane Forest. Cultivating for several years, he attained the Way, and transmitted the elixir Way to Xiao Tingzhi, styled Tianlai, a native of Minzhong; having obtained the Way of Crane Forest, he styled himself Zixu. Thereafter Peng Crane Forest manifested marvels everywhere, his divine power unfathomable. Later, weary of the world, Xiao Zixu escorted his master to Fuzhou where he passed away. This is another story, not recorded here.

In the year of the Jiaxu, the Jin lord moved the capital to Bianjing, seeking tribute from the Song. The Song minister Liu Shan advised refusal of the golden tribute. That year Yue Ke wrote the "History of Cheng," "Collection of Refutations," and "Records of Heaven’s Determinations," presenting them to the Song Emperor. Yue Ke was the grandson of Yue Fei, son of Yue Lin.  

In the year of Yihai in summer, the Mongol Temüjin again entered Yanjing. The Song appointed De Xiu as deputy transport commissioner of Jiangdong; he was a native of Pucheng. His eldest son named Jingyuan was fond of the Dao from youth, built a hut on the western mountain of Jiahe, dreamt of visiting the Purple Mansion, paid homage to the Celestial Lord of Taiwei, and received a record of merits and faults. Upon awakening, he recorded it, styling himself Youxuanzi, his hut Hui Zhen, his hall Wuyouxuan. Later he authored "Explications of the Great Learning," which circulated in the world.  

On the day Dingchou, Jin changed its era name to Xingding.  

On the day Wuyin, Jin raised armies to attack Song. The Song generals Meng Zongzheng, Hu Zaixing, and Xu Guo joined battle; the Jin army was greatly routed. The Jin feared Meng Zongzheng’s renown, calling him “Grandfather Meng.”  

On the day Jiǎmǎo, Song emissary Zhao Fang divided forces with Meng Zongzheng, Hu Zaixing, Xu Guo to attack Jin. Facing the Mongol commander Muhuali, who was ordered to seize Shandong, Shanxi, and other places.  

On the day Gengchen, Mongols appointed Shi Tianni as acting commander of Hebei’s western army. Shi Tianni had studied under Qiu Changchun, retaining a heart of love for people. Meeting Muhuali, he said: “In these past few years, wars and bandits have succeeded each other; the people have nowhere to dwell. Now the central plains are roughly pacified, yet the great army is also plundering; this is not the king’s duty to eliminate violence and rescue the people. The general should carefully consider this.” Muhuali, hearing Shi’s words, felt shame, and issued an order forbidding plundering; violators were to be executed on the spot, and captives old and young sent home. The armies marched forth everywhere; all prefectures, commanderies, and counties surrendered. All this through the Dao transformation of Master Changchun.  

---

Meanwhile, the Mongol lord sought out the Way, searching for virtuous talent. He obtained the son of Yelü Lüzhi, a Liao man named Chucun, and placed him nearby for consultations. Yelü Chucun was versed in arts and numbers, especially skilled in the study of the heavens and calendars, having composed the Gengwu era calendar. He often said: “The qi and fortune of Song are reverently bestowed by Heaven’s mandate; virtue will shine and it will prosper later.” He also said: “The northern and southern worthy generals and rulers of Xia and Jin will suffer disaster.” This was fulfilled.  

On the day Xinyi, Song generals Zhao Fang and An Bing died.  

On the day Renwu, the Mongol lord personally campaigned against the Western Xia Huihui, destroying their state. The army reached the country of Xindu, broke Tiemen Pass; the guards saw a beast, shaped like a deer with a horse’s tail, green in colour with a single horn, speaking human words: “Why do you not return early!” After speaking, it vanished like the wind. The Emperor was astonished and asked Chucai, who said: “This beast’s horn tip travels 108,000 li a day; it can understand the languages of the four barbarians. Its speech portends a killing omen; Heaven sends this beast to warn Your Majesty. You should pardon the lives of these few nations, that you may accumulate boundless blessings.” The Emperor heard this and immediately withdrew his army.  

On the day Guwei, Mongol commander Muhuali died. The Xia lord Shenzong abdicated in favour of crown prince Dewang, who became Emperor Xianzong, and changed the era name to Qianding. That year the Jin lord died; his son Shouxu succeeded as Emperor Aizong.  

On the day Jiashen in spring, Jin changed the era name to Zhengda. The Song heard of Jin’s loss of their lord; generals deliberated on attacking Jin during the mourning. The Minister of Rites Cui Yuzhi advised: “Now the southern transport is not good; attack may bring ill fortune.” They ceased. Cui Yuzhi knew the Emperor was near death, so he resigned and returned to Guangzhou to conceal himself.

Meanwhile, Chen Niwan Zhenren travelled north and returned to reside on Mount Luofu in Huizhou. One day, he sighed: “Emperors and ministers, all have their end. I have dwelt long in the world; what profit is there?” At that time Bai Yuchan and Sha Zhexu came together to pay respects; Niwan joyfully said: “You two also know me?” Bai Sha said: “Since Master has completed his journey and ascended, the two disciples have come unbidden to pay farewell.” Niwan said: “You two have high immortal rank; soon you shall meet in Pengling.” After speaking, he invited the two to ascend the mountain to watch the sun. At midnight, a golden radiance and rosy clouds appeared; the sun revolved forth, a grand spectacle. Returning to the pavilion, Cui Xu sat serene and composed, chanting a hymn to the sun:  

“Thunder roars atop the summit,  
The primal chaos falls to earth without trace.  
This morning I find the Way and depart,  
Riding a hornless fiery dragon.”  

Having finished, he transformed away. In the void, musical sounds issued forth; the procession appeared in splendour and ascended to Heaven. All bowed and sent them off. The next day, the mortal body was not seen, transformed into twelve pellets of Niwan. People dared not bury them; later, those who were ill scraped and took them, all recovering immediately. The Master’s writings, “Collected Writings on Awakening to the Way,” circulated in the world.  

---

Meanwhile, Bai Yuchan and Zhexu saw the Master transform and depart, the marvels unfathomable; the two then took leave and descended the mountain. Zhexu bade farewell to Bai Yuchan and journeyed west to Emei and Qingcheng, renaming himself Daozhao, performing merits to aid the world.  

Thus it is said:  

The ascent to Heaven in broad daylight is not difficult,  
I urge you to hasten and refine the golden elixir.  
With steadfast heart and diligent will, study earnestly,  
And keep your true nature well in mind.  

If you desire to know what happens next,  
Attend the next chapter for its unfolding.
