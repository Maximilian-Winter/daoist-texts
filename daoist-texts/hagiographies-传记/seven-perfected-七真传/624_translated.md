# Preface

I have often reflected that the Origin of the Way proceeds from a true and orthodox vein; all the myriad laws do not issue beyond the One Mind. Extending and expanding it, the Way and its Virtue are contained in five thousand words; but to condense and narrate it, the tradition is handed down in sixteen characters. All that is divided into various branches and separate schools is, for the most part, but diverse paths leading to the same goal. Yet those of the world who admire the Way merely journey to Kongtong to seek it, shaving the hair and washing the marrow, wishing to exchange their mortal frame yet without the elixir; they establish their life and seek the true, speak of profound mysteries and enigmas, yet fail to comprehend. They are wholly unaware that the principle values a devoted mind, the method seeks a single thread; the essential point lies in the fundamental purport, which depends altogether on the transmission of instruction.

In my leisure hours, having aspired to the Way many years, I have always held fast to the one classic of the True Man Wang of the beginning of our dynasty, founder of the White Cloud Temple, entitled "The Dragon Gate Heart Method." Morning and evening I have exhausted myself in its substance and function, and dimly have I obtained some slight illumination. Later, in the company of my trusted friends, Zhang Gengyun, the abbot of the White Cloud Temple, and the alchemist Qin Yunqiao, three of us fellow-practitioners, we spoke of how this manuscript is regrettably but a copy, and does not circulate among the world. Yet the two gentlemen said, 'The True Man’s name is recorded in the Purple Mansion and honored in the Divine Capital. Since this original remains, if learners desire to study deeply, they can proceed with firm footing. Truly, the benevolent will see it as benevolence, the wise will recognize it as wisdom.'

Now that the altar is opened and the precepts transmitted, the brave seekers of the Way from all under Heaven gather here. It may be publicly promulgated, and then printed and spread abroad. I therefore gladly, without hesitation, bestow it without concealment, and as a resident devotee contribute funds, wishing that it be engraved and handed down. Reflecting back from the beginning of the reign of Shunzhi to the start of Tongzhi, the True Man’s quiet virtue accumulated long and deep; now at last his secret radiance is elucidated, and I cannot express my joy. I only wish that those who are divine and clear need not seek the wondrous medicines of Penglai or the pot of Heaven, nor aspire to the brilliance of feathered wheels or precious trees, and so my private felicity may be thus fulfilled. This I offer as a preface.

Respectfully composed by Jingwen on the first day of the fifth month in the summer of the tenth year of Tongzhi of the Great Qing.
