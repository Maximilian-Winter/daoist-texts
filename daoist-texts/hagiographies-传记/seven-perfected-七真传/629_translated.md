# Renouncing and Severing Attachments of Affection

The multitude have already known that hindrances are obstacles and causes of harm. Yet the harm of attachments of affection is even more fierce than that of hindrances. How is this known? The mind of hindrance arises only upon encountering conditions; when the conditions pass away, the mind is empty; its harm comes and goes in turn. But as for the two characters “attachments of affection,” they are the karmic roots sown from aeons without beginning down to this present life. Therefore the sages, the immortals, and the Buddhas only exhort living beings not to cling to forms, not to be bound, not to be covetous; the three teachings all advise the world’s later generations not to be entangled by attachments of affection. This attachment of affection is the ancestor of all demons, the root of myriad harms. Repeatedly sinking into delusion through many kalpas, born and falling in countless lives, it is always because of attachments of affection. The failure to find the way of liberation, the ignorance of the principle of true emptiness, are all due to attachments of affection. Life afflicted with the penalties of officials, death sinking into hell, are all because of attachments of affection; flood and fire, violent death, swords and weapons, are all because of attachments of affection. The overthrow of one’s lineage and the cutting off of posterity, the breaking of precepts and violation of rules, are all because of attachments of affection. The calamities suffered by nine ancestors, the decline of incense and offerings, are all because of attachments of affection. Birth, old age, sickness, and death, the perversity of nature and mind, the weakness of the body, the difficulty in progressing on the Way, are all because of attachments of affection. The impurity of the six roots, the rampant six thieves, the discriminations of the six consciousnesses, the rounds of birth and death in the six paths, are all because of attachments of affection. Within heaven and earth, amid the five phases, the growth and withering of myriad things, the arising and ceasing of myriad forms, are all because of attachments of affection. If one desires to leave the world, to transcend birth and death, if one does not seek to cut off and sever, to renounce and abandon attachments of affection, and yet can be clear and bright, pure and tranquil, liberated and free, there has not yet been such a one.

I will first take the attachments of affection among the worldly relationships of sovereign and minister, father and son, husband and wife, elder and younger brothers, friends, as the ancient sages have spoken of the five existences, the five cessations, the five deviations, as well as the moderation of all excesses, the esteem of kin and worthies, and so on. All these depend upon what is inherently contained within this subtle and empty inner nature, and are measured and shaped accordingly; rectifying one’s nature and destiny is to preserve and embrace the universe in perfect harmony. The original chaotic primal energy no longer requires the severing of attachments of affection; purely by the way of nature, calmness, and liberation, we will slowly discourse again.

Now I speak singly of those who have left the home-life, namely, you disciples and devotees here today, who also should eliminate extraneous attachments of affection. All that within one’s proper sphere which is lovable need not be loved; like conditions which have their limits, each one should be examined and measured, and past attachments regulated and put aside. The multitude, attachments of affection cause bewilderment, of which you are altogether ignorant. How so? The thoughts of men, swift and joyous, call this attachments of affection. All things great and small, fine and coarse; all kith and kin, near and far; all matters of inner and outer, right and wrong; all the doctrines of sages and worthies, of the three teachings, Confucianism, Buddhism, and Daoism; all scriptures, writings, documents, and musical scores; all the mysteries of heaven and earth, yin and yang, creation and transformation; all miracles and wonders, illusions and magic arts; all the pure subtle spirit-treasures and the way of the Perfected; even the famous mountains and caves, heavenly palaces and sacred realms; even the seven treasures and eight delicacies, the river charts and turtle omens; together with one’s own body and mind, five viscera and six entrails, teeth, tongue, essence and breath, mountains, rivers, earth, grass, trees, birds, beasts, and insects — wherever the thought is covetous, wherever the mind is fixed, wherever the heart intends, wherever the spirit and breath flow, wherever the affections cling, wherever the nature delights, wherever the mouth desires, wherever the body rejoices, wherever the dream wanders — all are bound to attachments of affection. Whenever there is one moment’s remembrance, one is thereby entangled and cannot attain the way of clear and tranquil liberation, but remains an enmeshed disciple of delusion and sorrow.

The multitude, when deluded and attached, attachments of affection arise; when awakened and enlightened, attachments of affection cease. It is necessary to be ever mindful, to bear it constantly; if the heart clings to one whit of any beloved thing, one must immediately renounce and sever it, not allowing conditions to arise again. He who loves sleep should sit; he who loves sitting should walk; he who loves relinquishing finds his mind and spirit naturally lively; he who loves having nothing finds his spiritual nature naturally empty. Not a thread attached, no myriad conditions arise. The awakened mind then produces brightness, unmoved by conditions, unstirred by things, untroubled by affairs. After long continuance, there are wondrous effects without cause; the primal orifices are opened and unobstructed. But if today you do not cut off, and tomorrow you do not break away; if you abandon and yet do not sever, still entangled as before, then your robes, your alms-bowl, and your meditation cushion all become nets; your coarse sandals and bamboo staff are all cords of bondage; the famous mountains and sacred realms become prisons; your fellow disciples and companions become enemies. Even your incantations and true words must change to arsenic and poison; your true heart and nature end up transformed into the merit and retribution of the fierce Asuras. Can you not be cautious? Can you not mourn? Can you not bear to abandon and sever them?

In former times there was a Daoist who sat long in meditation. He saw above his head a radiance, five-coloured and bright, like clouds or brocade. Within that light appeared mountains, rivers, earth, and all things. The Daoist’s heart rejoiced, thinking he had attained the great unhindered light of the Supreme Emperor. Day and night he sat upright, thinking of the light; but the light did not appear again. The Daoist did not realize the illusory nature of the vision, and with intention meditated, all thoughts forgotten, thinking only of the brightness. The longer he fixed his thought, the more he became like a fool or madman, his form and body becoming like clay and wood; others thought he had entered the supreme way. The Daoist sat thus for six years; his spirit concentrated, his form changed, but he was unaware. One day, his breath was rough and hurried; his companions watched over him, hoping he would open his quietude and thereby seek the way. Among them was one cultivator who knew he was possessed by demons. At midnight, the meditator suddenly stretched out his hands like wings. The crowd offered lights, incense, flowers, and worship. The man then expired, and from his mouth flew a moth which fluttered towards the flame of the lamp and died. The cultivator took it and said to the assembly of Daoists and the multitude: “This body of one who stored up the thought of brightness is like the moth — attachment to brightness is the same as the moth, for attachment brings transformation of form and transmigration into other kinds. If attachments are not removed, they are all of this kind. Can you not be sorrowful? Can you not sever them?” The multitude, wherever the heart has attachment, that is condition; condition arises from attachment, attachment arises from condition; condition and attachment are entangled, never attaining cessation or clarity. Fathers turn to sons, ancestors to grandsons, men to women; faces are changed and forms exchanged; names are altered and surnames changed; the common man is reversed and confounded, thinking this to be real; terrible and pitiable! The multitude, know this.
