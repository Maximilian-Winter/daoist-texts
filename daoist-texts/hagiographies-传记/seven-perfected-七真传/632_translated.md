# Eight: Purifying Body and Mind

The multitudes, having already taken the precepts and sought refuge, should forthwith apply themselves with singleness to seek the world beyond, to transcend birth and death. Yet the transcenders of birth and death and the world beyond are men of the highest rank, who possess the supreme vehicle of the Way without death and without birth. This Way is the turning of the world’s method upon itself; originally it has no method. The worldly method and the method beyond the world are but one mind; their operations differ in contrary and in accord, but in truth they are but one method; the method is not only the use of accord and contrary. The use of the contrary within the accord is the method of non-action to which all things return; the spirits and demons cannot fathom its working. The use of accord within the contrary, one method scattered into myriad methods; yin and yang do not escape its computation. It is not by the operation of a conscious mind that this works, nor by the effort of thought in inquiry. It is the lucid wisdom of the spirit and intelligence; the principle and reason are originally so; there is no other method beyond the world. Yet, who is it that transcends the world? And yet it is necessary to send this man beyond the world to the world outside; that alone is transcendence. But this again is not so.

Now I say to exhort men to take this body beyond the world; the heaven and earth are vast, the universe is wide—how can that be called outside the world? The multitudes, listen carefully: the world outside is that which is beyond the worldly method. To discern the worldly method as not true, the illusory feelings as false—all things produced by effort are but a dream; each thing is without substance, each event is not real. Only by making this mind pure and tranquil can one go forth beyond the world. The multitudes, how do you know that this mind can go beyond the world? Now the heavens have their changes of cloud and sunshine, but they cannot transcend the world; now the earth has its cracking and collapsing, but it cannot transcend the world; the sun and moon wax and wane, but they cannot transcend the world; the stars fall afar, but they cannot transcend the world; the winds, clouds, thunder, rain, frost, snow, mist, and dew all have their fixed limits, but they cannot transcend the world; the mountains crumble and stones are split, waters dry and springs cease, grasses wither and trees decay, metals melt and jades break—none can transcend the world; men have birth and death, but cannot transcend the world; things have strength and old age, but cannot transcend the world; feelings have thickness and thinness, but cannot transcend the world; breath has inhalation and exhalation, but cannot transcend the world; the mind has motion and stillness, but cannot transcend the world; essence has leakage, but cannot transcend the world; spirit has confusion and dispersion, but cannot transcend the world; power has waxing and waning, but cannot transcend the world; profit has increase and decrease, but cannot transcend the world. All things produced by effort are bound up in arising, abiding, emptying, and perishing—birth, old age, sickness, and death—how can they possibly lead one beyond the world? The multitudes, you must in the worldly method awaken to the method beyond the world; only then is it good. This method beyond the world is not in many words, but only that this mind return. When it is known that heaven and earth and all things, human feelings and worldly affairs are altogether not the method beyond the world, then you know that these heaven and earth and all things, human feelings and worldly affairs, are all within the snare, within the world. If you can in your heart awaken to this one point, and break through the impermanency of all heaven and earth and all things, the worldly method and human feelings are all illusions—what then is the true spirit? This true spirit is without form or appearance, without odor or sound; it is said to be within, yet it is not confined within; said to be without, yet it does not come from without. Every man possesses it, every thing corresponds; it is indeed the King of Methods that can transcend the world.

The multitudes, this King of Methods of the true spirit, in the universe ancient and modern, there is nothing without it, no time when it is not so; it is not a thing of small importance. In Buddhism it is called the marvelous clear true heart; in Confucianism it is called bright virtue and supreme goodness; in Taoism it is called the perfect clear Tao-mother, also called the ancestral qi. Many other names there are, which cannot be enumerated. That which can know heaven and earth and all things, human feelings and worldly methods—where is it to be sought? It is found in the opening words of the Great Learning: "Illuminate your bright virtue, and rest in supreme goodness." This bright virtue and supreme goodness is hidden in arising, abiding, emptying, and perishing, birth, old age, sickness and death: the true spirit without sickness and death. From ancient times to now it ever abides without darkness. It penetrates heaven and earth, passes into the depths and the obscure. It is unproduced and unchanging, neither more nor less. It is without deficiency and without excess, without coming and going. It can move yin and yang, yet is not confined by yin and yang. It can control spirits and demons, yet is not oppressed by them. It can use all things, yet is not opposed by them. It can transform human feelings, yet is not stirred by them. It can respond to worldly methods, yet is not drowned by them. It can transcend outside the world, and abide within the world. It traverses the three realms freely, coming and going at will without restraint; it governs myriad spirits, changes mysteriously and is unfathomable. Above heaven and under earth, only this is called revered, none is equal to it. None other than this point of true spirit does every man possess; yet each finds it hard to understand. The myriad methods and thousand gates, the three vehicles and one canon, all proceed from this. Every subtle aperture, every secret hinge, to awaken to it is immediately before you; to be confused is to fall beneath the sea.

The multitudes, know that to transcend the world in practice is not to go beyond the two words body and mind. The body is false, the mind true; the mind is false, the nature true. You must awaken to borrow the false to cultivate the true. The outward is false, the inward true; the outward form is color, the inward is emptiness. Without borrowing the outward color-body produced by effort, it is difficult to cultivate the inward method-body of non-action. Without depending on the body subject to birth, old age, sickness and death, it is difficult to understand the inward serene and perfect mind. Without borrowing the empty and lively mind, it is difficult to transcend and realize the vast boundless nature. Yet this nature comes from the mandate of heaven; at the beginning of life it is without pollution, of one substance with the great void, equal in measure with the great void. It is hollow and empty, having nothing. All-encompassing and entire, there is nothing that is not included.

The multitudes, now if you seek to go beyond the world, you must first have all men clear and purify body and mind. What is the effort of purifying body and mind? Attachments to the body arise from blood and qi, which are not incorruptible but are the root of birth and death, the origin of calamity and misfortune. They involve my mind, and injure my nature. Love of color and lust arise only for the body's pleasure. Striving for fame and profit is only for the body's enjoyment. Breaking the law and inviting punishment, producing calamity and disease, all arise from this body. The Supreme One said: "Man's affliction is because he has a body; when I have no body, what affliction is there?" The ancients said: "If one is not entangled by the form, then what is before the eye is the Great Luo Immortal." Thus it is seen that this body is no small misfortune. Now you must see through the skin-bag as a false thing, compounded of earth, water, and wind. If you do not speak of thorough cultivation, but only exhort men to filial piety, you would say the body, skin, hair, and members are received from parents and must not be damaged. The essence of father and blood of mother, in the proportion of two to five, possess the fine qi of heaven and earth, and receive the divine power of yin and yang. The head is round and models heaven, the feet square and follow earth; positioned between heaven and earth, together they are the three powers. Among all things, man is first; above, he may correspond with heaven and earth; below, he may praise spirits and demons. Learning may aspire to sages and worthy men; cultivation may perfect immortals and Buddhas. How can one regard this most precious and rich body as filthy earth full of stench? The precept disciples are only required not to fall away, nor be confused by worldly waves. Do not seek comfort for the color body, but return the true nature to the true constant. The will and qi desire to govern yin and yang; the form and spirit desire to adorn the dharma realm. Should the dharma body have flaw, then form and spirit cannot both be perfect and united with the Way and truth.

The multitudes, now I explain to you the effort of purity. If you would have this body pure, first cast away the worldly things, break off dusty feelings, be distant and utterly separate from all worldly methods. Taste bland and be glad in leisure; abandon rich and sweet and avoid noise and turmoil. Take refuge in the Three Treasures, and strictly guard the One Truth. Nurture your nature and feelings in peace; keep your hands and feet upright and decorous; your eyes and ears must not be perverse; your thoughts must not be scattered; the heart must not retain contemplations or attachments; the mouth must not shout loudly. Collect the spirit-light of the two eyes, inwardly illuminate without darkness the spiritual platform; return the essence apertures of the two ears, inwardly listen and always hear the heavenly sounds. Rarely speak and open to silence; return to nature and do not move. Expect no regrets or grudges; thoughts do not wander; the spirit is without vexation; heavenly mechanisms are clear and smooth; profound principles are perfectly communicated. The mouth ceases from meats of the five pungents and greases, secretly consuming the many births of killing and hardship. The body observes the precepts, closely practicing the solemn demeanour of the four great elements. The feet walk not in confusion, the heart is not flurried; the hands do not move at random, the heart is not agitated. Sitting is upright and balanced, not allowing deviation or leaning; lying down is alert and clear, avoiding much drowsiness; eating is bland and reduces flavour, and the five viscera are calm and even; speech is careful and composed, and the voice harmonious and flowing. This is called the coarse practice of purifying the body. As for the fine subtle effort, you are required to ponder and seek the two words purity and stillness; I fear you cannot enter the heart and penetrate to practice it, not that you fail in endeavor and do not attain the Way.

The multitudes, a mind without two thoughts is called pure; thoughts without contradiction and confusion is called still. The mind not fixed on form is called pure; thoughts not halting is called still. Every thought perfectly clear is called pure; bright and unimpeded is called still. Not stained by a single speck of dust is called pure; all cares empty is called still. All things cannot escape its form is called pure; spirits and demons cannot fathom its workings is called still. The mind is like flowing water is called pure; nature like the bright moon is called still. Since beginningless time crimes have been destroyed is called pure; the causes of many kalpas have been fully exhausted is called still. Inwardly viewing the mind and finding no mind is called pure; outwardly viewing things and finding no thing is called still. The three having been awakened to is called pure; only seen in emptiness is called still. Viewing emptiness also as empty is called pure; emptiness without what is emptied is called still. The thing emptied being nothing, nothing also non-existent is called pure; perfectly tranquil and always still, still without what is stilled is called still. The true constant responding to things is called pure; constantly responding and constantly still is called still. Thoroughly lucid and unclouded is called pure; entering the myriad subtle gates is called still. Transcending the three realms is called pure; freeing from the five elements is called still. The void broken to pieces is called pure; breaking the void to pieces is called still. Light encompassing all the heavens is called pure; universally ferrying all beings is called still.

The multitudes, I have opened and instructed you, and briefly spoken in outline. The three vehicles’ sages, the great canon of scriptures; the myriad methods and thousand gates, the heavenly wondrous marks; the thirty-six thousand ways, the eighty-four thousand dharma gates; the sands of the Ganges number of bodhisattvas, countless hosts of golden immortals—all cannot transcend the wondrous method of purity, stillness, concentration, wisdom, and non-action. The multitudes, the highest and unsurpassed great vehicle, the supreme true wondrous Way, all heaven-born, earth-born, man-born, and creature-born, all come from purity and stillness. The Supreme One said: "If man can always be pure and still, all heaven and earth will return (to him)." He also said: "If pure and still, then all under heaven is correct." Thus it is seen that purifying body and mind is speedily to be sought for awakening. The multitudes, from this day you must cast away all the lead and mercury, dragon and tiger, yin and yang, burning and refining, all manner of similes which you have been confused by. Only by the method gate of purity and stillness extinguish the deluded mind, cease evil thoughts, be steady and stable, proceed the great road of the Middle Way, never fear. This is called delay but not error; if there be a way, do not board the ship. If I speak falsely and deceive, may I fall to hell! At that time, the lawyer recited this verse: "Thoughts confused, the mind is not still; dust many, the body not pure. Without purity it is hard to see nature; without stillness how can there be feeling? Inwardly reflect on the body as illusion; return the light, the mind is also empty. In emptiness the spirit sees itself; concentration and wisdom are the true school. Observe sun and moon; in the ordinary, be diligent in practice. Opposite conduct holds the dipper; purity and stillness accord with the mind of heaven."
