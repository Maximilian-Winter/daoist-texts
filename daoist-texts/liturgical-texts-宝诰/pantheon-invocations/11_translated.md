# The Precious Admonition for Deliverance from Suffering

With a sincere heart I take refuge and make obeisance.  
In the Azure Radiance of the Everlasting Joy Realm,  
At the Eastern Extreme, the Palace of Wondrous Purity.  
There is the Forest of Seven Treasures and Fragrant Blossoms,  
Upon the Lotus Seat of Nine Colours.  
Within the encircling hosts of myriad spirits,  
Amid the hundred billion auspicious lights.  
The Revered One of the Supreme Clarity and Spiritual Treasure,  
Manifested in response to the Mysterious Origin and Beginning.  
In the great kalpa, extending mercy to save,  
At the Door of Sweet Dew in the boundless world.  
The Wonderful Wayâ€™s True Body,  
Marked with the purple-gold auspicious tokens.  
Ready to respond to those who call,  
With vows without limit.  
The Great Sage of Great Compassion,  
Great Mercy and Great Vows,  
The Names of Transformation in all Ten Directions,  
Universally Delivering Living Beings.  
Through countless kalpas, saving immeasurably,  
Hearing the voices and responding,  
He is the Most High Heavenly Worthy of Taiyi Deliverance from Suffering,  
The Azure Mysterious Supreme Emperor.
