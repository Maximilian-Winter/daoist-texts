# The Precious Edict of the Western Queen Mother

With sincere heart I take refuge and make obeisance.  
The Heavenly Pool opens in grand prosperity; the Infinite Holy Mother,  
At the Dragon-Flower Great Assembly holds feast in the Jasper Pool.  
Commander of myriad spirits, she imparts the mandate of teaching.  
All the immortals bring offerings of longevity, the arrayed saints raise their cups in praise.  
Heaven’s majesty is near at hand; her功 is high and 德 is weighty.  
She intercedes for the realm with perfect balance; Immortal Mistress, Dao’s Venerable Ancestress.  
Three thousand attendant maidens perform the celestial music of sheng and reed-pipes.  
The hundred-year peaches ripen in the golden and blue spirit garden.  
She rescues the suffering multitudes, sprinkling sweet dew upon the mortal world.  
Great compassion and great vow, great saint and great mercy—  
The Infinite Jasper Pool’s Great Saint, the Western Queen Mother, Golden Mother Heavenly Worthy.

With sincere heart I take refuge and make obeisance.  
White jade reveals her trace.  
The Turtle Terrace refines the true.  
She adorns the primal true waters.  
For countless ages she is a spirit.  
Mother of the universe’s spirit.  
The Supreme Origin Lord.  
She conceives Heaven and Earth,  
All things transform and come to birth.  
Master of Primal Yang.  
The Jasper Pool is her palace.  
She richly cultivates virtue and Dao.  
To the utmost she brings perfect peace.  
Merciful vessel of universal salvation,  
She guides and leads through perplexity’s ford.  
At the Dragon-Flower Great Assembly,  
She bestows the curled peaches to the multitudes.  
Great virtue, utmost benevolence,  
She saves the returning primal spirits.  
In the ledger sea all is unified.  
The Dao continues from the Heavenly Worthy.  
Infinite Jasper Pool,  
The Great Saint Western Queen Golden Mother Heavenly Worthy.
