# Precious Declaration of the Supreme Emperor, Heavenly Official of the Primordial Origin

With reverent heart I bow and submit my life in worship.  
In the Mysterious Capital of the Primordial Yang, within the Purple Tenuity Palace,  
Are marshalled thirty-six Departments, together with nine hundred million multitudes.  
They examine the Great Thousand Worlds within,  
And record in registers the lands of the Ten Directions.  
Blessings extend to myriad spirits, presiding over the registers of good and evil of all living beings.  
Their grace pervades the Three Realms,  
Executing the offices of ascent and descent of the Immortals.  
They remove calamities without cause, and resolve lingering misfortunes.  
Delivering from the cycle of birth and death, rescuing from secret torments.  
All living creatures rely on them, all sentient beings are made secure.  
Great compassion and great vow, great sage and great mercy.  
The Heavenly Official of the Primordial Nine Energies grants blessings,  
The resplendent Spirit of Primordial Yang, the Great Emperor, the Purple Tenuity Sovereign.
