# Precious Edict of the Sun Star Lord

With devoted heart and reverent mind I bow and surrender myself in homage. Above, in the Great Luo Heaven, within the Vermilion Bright Palace, He is enthroned in the loftiest height of the Ten Extremes, His body and spirit issuing forth to govern; His station is above the Three Powers rightly established, presiding with virtue and wielding authority. The cold and austere, the heat and fire, all harmonize the Six Qi and bring universal peace to myriad states; at dawn and at night’s dark veil, He rides the six dragons to rule the Ten Radiances. He holds the sceptre of bestowing reward and punishment for good and evil, shining forth in resplendent brightness; He settles the marks of merit and fault, minute and manifest, His response clear and evident. His commands are like thunder and lightning, swiftly banishing evil and calamity. Great is His compassion, great His vow; most holy, most merciful is He. The Sun Palace’s Sun Emperor, the Lord Yu Yi, His awe-inspiring radiance spreads virtue, His merciful splendour the Vermilion Sun Heaven’s Honourable One.
