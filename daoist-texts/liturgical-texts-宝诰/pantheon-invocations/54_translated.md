# Precious Edict of the Empress Nuwa

With earnest heart and reverent mind I bow and take refuge. She moulded men from the earth, and by transformation gave birth to myriad things;  
She established rites for marriage, and thus propagated the human race;  
She created the sheng and the reed-pipe, to entertain the multitudes of living beings.  
She refined the five-coloured stones with the supreme Way and its law to mend the heavens;  
She broke off the legs of the divine tortoise to prop up the four quarters;  
She quelled the great floods and slew the fierce beasts;  
She widely bestowed grace and beneficence upon all creatures.  
A great sage, of great compassion, of great pity, of great vow, the root and origin of the human ancestors;  
Entrusted to the Old Mother of Heaven, the Empress Nuwa, the Holy Mother, the Heavenly Worthy.
