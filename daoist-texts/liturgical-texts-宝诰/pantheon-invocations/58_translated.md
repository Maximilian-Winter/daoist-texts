# General Exhortation of the Five Great Mountains

With reverent heart I bow and submit my vow.  
The master of myriad mountains, the august spirit of the nine earths.  
Blue, yellow, red, white, and black each govern their heavens;  
East, west, south, north, and centre all obey their lands.  
Great life, broad life, and all-encompassing life, the multitudes depend upon their protection.  
Divine responses and mutual influences correspond in kind, without overstepping their bounds.  
The seventy-nine thousand and fifty-three breaths all return to the one primal origin.  
Myriads of officials are all subject to the authority of the Five Great Mountains.  
The rites of Feng and Shan have been carried down through successive generations,  
Their jurisdiction recorded in the Jade Purity Register.  
Great compassion, great vows, great sage, great mercy.  
The Five Great Mountains, named mountains and great emperors,  
Their majesty and spirit radiant, the Celestial Lords revered.
