# The Precious Admonition of the Compassionate Navigator True Man

With a devoted heart I submit myself and take refuge. I pay homage to Mount Putuo above, before the southern shore of the Sea of the South, where myriad transformations are wrought. Broadly seeking the功 of sounding forth rescue from suffering, possessing the samadhi and the six penetrations, attesting to the fruit of purity and naturalness. The blue lotus is steeped in dew, the green willows condense auspiciousness, the leaves bring blessings to transmit the ancestral line. The unicorn’s footprint responds to the embrace and sending forth of the white-robed ones, aiding men and benefiting things. The vast grace shines like the lightnings of violet brightness, transcending the five sufferings and delivering from birth after birth to awakening. Great compassion and great vow, great saint and great mercy — the Guanyin Great Worthy, the lord of the Five Thunders, the Yellow Jiya Heavenly Emperor of Zhuluo, the Perfectly Penetrating and Free Heavenly Venerable.
