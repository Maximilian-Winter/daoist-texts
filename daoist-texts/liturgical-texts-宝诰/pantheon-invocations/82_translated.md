# The Precious Inscription of the Venerable Huang

With sincere heart I make obeisance and submit myself.  
Jinhua attained the Way,  
As a child he cultivated the method and perfected the True.  
Receiving the guidance of the Immortal Ge, he was ferried across,  
Underwent austere practice for forty years.  
Poria sustained his hunger,  
He refined the Way and attained the True.  
He dispensed the Law in the dusty world,  
Universally ferrying all living beings across.  
His Law manifested clear and efficacious,  
A man of heroic excellence and gifted talent.  
He possessed the marvel of commanding stones to change into sheep,  
Removing obstinate maladies and recovering with suddenness.  
He toured the three realms,  
Delivering from calamities and dissolving tribulations.  
He expounded the five paths,  
Filial piety, brotherly respect, loyalty, faith, benevolence, righteousness, propriety, kindness, honesty, and chastity.  
Great compassion, great vows,  
Great sage, great mercy.  
By imperial edict he was enfeoffed as the Profound and Mysterious Universal Transformation and Nourishing of Purity and Rectitude Emperor Lord, the Red Pine Immortal Elder.
