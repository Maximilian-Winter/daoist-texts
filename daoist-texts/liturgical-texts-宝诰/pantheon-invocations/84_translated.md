# Precious Declaration of the Immortal Elder of Hongya

With devoted heart I bow and surrender my life in reverence. One Breath divides the True; the Five Agents nurture the substance. In the earliest antiquity He wrought, the Master and exemplar of Shennong; Receiving the Two Forms, the Spirit-Treasure’s true mechanism. Ever manifest in Jin and Tang, His light continually sheds on present and past. He strides the snowy essence upon the Western Mountains, and utters long cries at Kaiyuan. His voice moves the imperial canopy, pure and surpassing in the Palace of Deep Dew; His law is transmitted through his humble garment, spreading the glory of the vast Dao’s daily brightness. His beneficence reaches the four quarters; His grace is universal and all-encompassing. Great Compassion, Great Vow, Great Filial Piety, Great Benevolence; Mr. Hongya, Immortal Elder of Qingcheng, Pure and Bright Scripture Master, the Responsive and Manifest True Lord.
