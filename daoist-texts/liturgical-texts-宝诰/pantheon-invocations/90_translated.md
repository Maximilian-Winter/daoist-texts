## Commentary on the Precious Edict of Master Xu Jing the Celestial Teacher

The Zhang Patriarch’s Precious Edict, that is, the Precious Edict of Master Xu Jing Zhang Jixian, the Patriarch.

Master Xu Jing was the Thirtieth Generation Celestial Master of the Celestial Masters’ Way; he once entered Sichuan to put in order the eleven administrations; a renowned Daoist of the Northern Song, styled Jiawen, also styled Daozheng, with the sobriquet Xiaoranzi; four times was he summoned to the Eastern Capital to perform jiao ceremonies in the imperial court; he was granted the title Master Xu Jing, with rank equivalent to Zhongsan Daifu, and was bestowed the imperial jade seal of the Yangping Administration—he was the great patriarch of the Orthodox Unity Celestial Masters of the Qingwei sect.

### White snow and cinnabar in the firmament. Yellow sprouts curve and accumulate.

In the seventh year of Yuanyou, Northern Song, on the twentieth day of the tenth month of the year of Ren-shen, Master Xu Jing was born at the Menggu Hermitage on Mount Longhu. At five years old he had not yet spoken; one day he heard the crowing of a cock and suddenly laughed, composing a poem: “The spiritual parrot has five virtues, its crown and beak ever close to the body. At the fifth watch it opens wide its mouth, calling to awaken those in dreams.” The next day, he sat at a banquet upon a blue lotus flower; all marveled and called him a true immortal.

In the third year of Yuanfu, Xu Jing at nine years old succeeded the teaching. He was four times summoned to the Eastern Capital to perform jiao ceremonies in the imperial court. Master Xu Jing never married and left no heirs; his aspiration was to live in simplicity, delighting in the open wilds of the mountains, cultivating quietude and the Way. He erected a hermitage behind the Palace of Supreme Clarity, a place of fasting of the heart and forgetting the self. Emperor Huizong of Song personally inscribed the name “Tranquil Passage Hermitage” for it, and there was a pavilion named “Xiaoran.” He also built the three halls of Lingbao, Yunjin, and Zhenyi, and transformed the Patriarch’s temple into the Teaching Hall.

Master Xu Jing foretold by the misfortune of the red sheep and red horse the national calamity of “the Jingkang Shame.” He entrusted his disciple Wang Daojian to convey to Emperor Huizong the admonition to “cultivate virtue and quell disaster.” In the “Recorded Sayings of Master Xu Jing” there are forty-eight poems on the Golden Elixir, speaking of the interplay of Kan and Li, white snow and yellow sprouts, the tiger and dragon, lead and mercury, all being metaphors for internal alchemical practice, which were applied to thunder magic.

The white snow, cinnabar, yellow sprouts, and ancient achievements mentioned in the Zhang Patriarch’s Precious Edict are the arts of yellow and white, being allegories in the classic of cinnabar. The “Recorded Sayings of Master Xu Jing” states: “Kan and Li intermingle, the self becomes tranquil; only then is their union seen as husband and wife. White snow refined long enough equalizes sun and moon; yellow sprouts taken long bring forth heaven and earth. The tiger and dragon are the steed to ascend to heaven; lead and mercury form the vessel for departure.”

Master Xu Jing developed the Celestial Masters’ tradition, studying thoroughly the art of life and nature to master thunder secrets, founding the Orthodox Unity thunder method of Mount Longhu, an exemplar for later thunder method Daoist sects.

The “three and five flying steps” is the Orthodox Unity regulation; the “nine spirits flying steps” pertains to the practice of the Dongxuan division. The “three and five flying steps” are the essential arts of commanding spirits and ghosts by the spirit of the cave. If one cultivates the heart, naturally the official mansions (of the spirit) will be open and peaceful, with spirits harmonized and Qi flowing freely; all is by means of the Orthodox Unity’s matter. The Orthodox Unity cutting of evil, the three and five flying steps, the copper talismans, iron orders, sacred scriptures of the golden elixir, secret spirit writings, and twenty-four ranks of registers were handed down from Lord Lao to the Ancestor Celestial Master, and from him again to Master Xu Jing.

### The literary stars and constellations bestowed by the Venerable Lord Lao. The secret mystery of the three and five flying steps. The jade bureau’s registers and talismans handed down from the Han progenitor. The secret principle of the Orthodox Unity’s cutting of evil.

According to the “Recorded Sayings of Master Xu Jing,” the Master held that: “Our family’s registers and talismans can move heaven and earth above, shake mountains and rivers below, clearly serve to command the tiger and dragon, and mysteriously gather ghosts and spirits; by their power they can raise the decayed bones, by their cultivation escape life and death; in great matters they can guard the nation, in minor matters repel disaster. Yet to obtain them is by cultivation; to lose them is by falling away.”

Master Xu was once taught by his master the copper talismans, iron orders, golden elixir scriptures, the Orthodox Unity cutting of evil, three and five flying steps technique, and the various ranks’ secrets to control myriad spirits. He once came forth from a well in Tanzhou, brandishing a sword to pursue a dragon, emerging from that well.

The “Complete Book of Pure Clarity, Loyalty, and Filiality” states: “Limitless Clear Emptiness is called Pure Brightness; the Way within is called Central Yellow. The method spreads in all directions as the Eight Poles; it gathers the Four Symbols; it faces the Three Heavens and is called the three and five flying steps. Correct the inner; govern the outer; this is called the Orthodox Unity cutting of evil. If the law desires to govern the outer, first it corrects the inner. To correct the inner, first remove desire. Without desire, the heart naturally is Orthodox Unity; with the heart correct, the Way and method are complete.”

### Solely the One ascends in name to the Purple Palace; as One it holds sway over thunder and lightning.

The methods passed down by Master Xu Jing, such as the “Summoning and Commanding of Temple Spirits,” the “Chapter of Master Xu Jing’s Dispelling of Falsehood” (namely the “Song of the Great Way”), the “Great Method of the Supreme Unity’s Secret Communication and Heavenly Star Striking,” the “Great Method of the Supreme Unity’s Fire Rhinoceros Thunder Bureau and General Zhu,” the “Great Method of Earthly Deity Marshal Wen,” the “Special Method of Marshal Zhang of Dongping to Command Summoning,” the “Secret Method of Marshal Guan of Demon Beheading,” and the “Secret Method of Marshal Lang of Fengdu,” all honor Master Xu Jing as the principal patriarch.

His lawful successors, Patriarchs Sa Shoujian, Zhu Meijing, Lu Yanghao, Chen Xiwei, and others of the Shenxiao sect were active during the Southern Song. In the Yuan dynasty, the Thirty-Sixth Generation Celestial Master Zhang Zongyan inherited his legacy, obtaining the “Emperor’s Commanded Precious Pearl Five Thunder Supplication Great Method,” issuing orders in all the heavens, summoning thunder over the three realms, employing the primordial unity Qi and the later Eight Trigrams to form talismans, named Precious Pearls.

Summoned by the Yuan Shizu, he was given the title “Spiritual Response and Harmonious True Man of the Way of Unfolding,” granted a second rank silver seal, and charged with overseeing Daoist affairs in Jiangnan. His imperial inscription read: “Thirty-Sixth Generation Celestial Master Zhang Zongyan, your heart transmits the law’s succession, embodying the quintessence of true spirit, broadly practicing the methods of the Great Cavern of the Yellow Court, holding the talisman of the Orthodox Unity alliance power, thus pure and thus tranquil, with faith and sincerity. Three feet of azure serpent, commanding ghosts and spirits in the dark wastes; one cup of clear water, cleansing demons near and far. Having widely opened the work of salvation, you deserve the title of honor.”

The eleven administrations in Sichuan had fallen into ruin since the Tang; in Song times, the Thirtieth Generation Celestial Master entered Sichuan to restore them. Especially at Mount Qingcheng, the weapons were silenced, diseases did not invade, and the Orthodox Unity Celestial Masters’ Way was revived. At present, in the Celestial Master’s Cave of Mount Qingcheng, there is a statue of Master Xu Jing, and every year pilgrims come in great numbers to pay their respects.

In the second year of Chongning of the Northern Song, the salt pond water in Xiezhou overflowed. Emperor Huizong inquired of the Daoist Xu Shenweng. Xu Shenweng recommended Master Xu Jing. In the third year of Chongning, Master Xu Jing was summoned to the court; an iron talisman was immediately issued, and his disciple Zhu Yongyou, together with an imperial eunuch, cast it at the collapsed bank of the pond. After a moment, thunder and lightning darkened the day; a dragon demon was torn apart at the water’s edge.

Emperor Huizong asked Master Xu Jing: “With what shall the dragon be subdued? And can it be seen?” Master Xu Jing said: “Marshal Guan shall be summoned to act.” He immediately grasped his sword and summoned him at the left of the hall; Marshal Guan appeared accordingly. Emperor Huizong then conferred upon him the title “True Lord of Chongning.” Marshal Guan is worshipped in Daoism and bestowed the title “True Lord of Chongning” because of Master Xu Jing’s summoning of him to slay the dragon in the salt pond. Since then, he has received successive imperial titles.

### It measures the Great Ultimate and ascends to the Purple Tenuity. It gathers the Three Blossoms and pays homage to the Five Qi.

In the second year of Jingkang of the Northern Song, Master Xu Jing passed away, aged thirty-six, and was buried at the Tianqing Temple in Anhui. In the eleventh year of Shaoxing of the Southern Song, Patriarch Sa Shoujian of the Western River, journeying to Mount Qingcheng, encountered Master Xu Jing at the gorge’s mouth, who bestowed talismanic methods, a water-tune song, a written letter, and a single shoe to transmit the succession of Celestial Masters. Upon arriving at Mount Longhu, the succeeding Celestial Master found the letter strange, and upon opening the coffin found only the red shoe remaining, thus realizing Master Xu Jing’s body had been liberated and he had ascended.

After his transcendence, Daoist companions often saw him in Luofu and western Shu, appearing and disappearing unpredictably. It is said that on the way to the summons he deeply understood the gravity of the times, that none could restore the heavens, and so entered embryonic breath and feigned death to preserve himself. Subsequently, he lived in deep seclusion in the mountains and forests, cultivating the Way between western Shu and Min and Yue, transmitting the teaching and instructing disciples, composing writings and setting forth doctrines.

The great Daoist Bai Yuchan of the Southern Song was noted for talismanic manifestations. Wherever he went, there were occasional wondrous responses; many desired to study with him but could not converse with him; he came and went alone, traveling two or three hundred li a day; people who saw his leaping and bounding often suspected him to be Master Xu Jing himself. “Gathering the Three Blossoms and paying homage to the Five Qi,” that is, “Three Flowers gathered at the crown, Five Qi paying homage to the origin,” indicating Master Xu Jing’s Daoist realization of the primordial heaven.

### Adaptively it confronts things; it sets aside evil and reverently follows. Great compassion and great vow; great sage and great mercy.

Master Xu Jing once aided a fox spirit mother and child struck by thunder calamity, helping them cultivate and transcend their tribulation. Thereafter is the story of the threefold repayment of kindness by the fox spirit mother and child. In the ancient Four Great Novels’ opening chapter of “Water Margin” entitled “Celestial Master Zhang Prays to Avert the Plague; Instructor Hong Mistakenly Drives Away the Demons,” the Celestial Master Zhang mentioned is none other than Master Xu Jing.

### The Patriarch, the Lord of Earthly Deities and Instruction, the Thirtieth Generation Celestial Master.

In the era of Xuanhe, Master Xu Jing journeyed to Mount Tai, and Lord Bingling ceremoniously welcomed the Celestial Master. Master Xu Jing said to Marshal Wen: “The people of Wenzhou earnestly petitioned the Heavenly Court, saying you have the功 to relieve drought. You do not take pride in temple offerings or national fiefs, but have the will to return to the orthodox Way and support the Patriarch. Before the Emperor of the Mountains I make you the Earthly Deity in charge of one office, the method of orthodox law, talismans, and incantations.”

“You transformed on the fifteenth day of the third month at the hour of Yin; this is the season of the Old Wood and First Fire, when wood generates fire, and fire flourishes in Bing and Ding. Ghosts are the spirits of all things; therefore this seal is your true form and suffices. Master Xu Jing made your talisman with the characters Bing Ding Sheng Gui (Born Ghost), corresponding to your time and becoming the true seal. Also with cloud script he wrote and painted various talismans. Thus began the method of Earthly Deities.”

Master Xu Jing pointed out: “The Earthly Deity spirits, by command of Jade Purity, are the officers attending and escorting the Lingbao. Hence in the Scripture on Delivering People there is restraint over Earthly Deities, attending and escorting. He also said to disciples: ‘The division of law is most spiritual, none surpasses Wenqiong.’ This means the source of Earthly Deity methods truly arose from teaching by Master Xu Jing. Therefore, the Celestial Master is honored as Lord of Earthly Deity Instruction.”

The “Daoist Canon Compendium · Zhang Collection · Daoist Duties” records: “The Earthly Deity methods and various talismans, such as the Bing Ding Born Ghost talisman, the urgent capture talisman, and the healing talisman, were all transmitted by Master Xu Jing.”

### Xu Jing, the profoundly awakened to the wondrous Way, Master Zhang the Perfected. The Mysterious Wind unfolding transformation, the Heavenly Venerable.

“Daoist Canon Compendium · Zhang Collection · Daoist Duties” records: The Patriarch, the Lord of Earthly Deity Instruction, the Thirtieth Generation Celestial Master. Xu Jing, the profoundly awakened to the wondrous Way, Master Zhang the Perfected, Minister within the Heavenly Palace, the Boundless Cultural True Man, the Heavenly Venerable who unfolds teaching in the Azure Firmament.

In the fourth year of Chongning, Emperor Huizong conferred upon him the title Master Xu Jing. In the first year of Zhida, Yuan Wuzong decreed the title Xu Jing Xuantong Hongwu True Man. In the thirteenth year of Zhizheng, Yuan Shundi posthumously conferred the title Xu Jing Xuantong Hongwu True Man.
