# The Declaration of the Perfected One Haiqiong to Patriarch Bao

With a heart devoted, I bow and submit my life in reverence.  
In the vigor of my youth I sought the truth, journeying to the south seas to inquire after the Way.  
With a mind indifferent to gold, jade, and brocades,  
I vowed to cultivate myself by feasting on snow and reclining upon ice.  
Barefoot and with hair unkempt, everywhere I refused to follow the fashions of the world.  
Consuming the rosy clouds and nourishing the breath, I constantly endured hardships to accumulate steadfast cultivation.  
I painted plum blossoms and bamboo for my own delight;  
Drinking and chanting without weariness.  
Free and easy in bearing, the Way and its methods are boundless.  
Great is my compassion and great my vow;  
Great is the sage and great his mercy.  
From the Purple Purity Hall lineage,  
The True Lord Fu of the Divine Firmament,  
The Heavenly Venerable who unfolds the Law of the Five Thunders.
