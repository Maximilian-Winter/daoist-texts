# The Monk of Taizhou Who Falsified the Taoist Scriptures and Met Retribution

In the tenth month of the year 2016, there was a certain monk of the name Shiyuanhui at a temple in Sanmen County, Taizhou, Zhejiang. He made a livelihood by holding fasting ceremonies, offering sacrifices, and reciting repentance scriptures, and was a disciple in the line of the Tiantai Mountain teachings. Seeing Taoist priests performing the ritual of worshipping the Dipper and venerating the Tai Sui (Grand Duke Jupiter), he thought within himself, ‘If Taoist priests may worship the Tai Sui, then we monks may also do likewise.’ Accordingly, he sought out the *Precious Repentance of the Tai Sui Spirit Hua* and the *Scripture of the Northern Dipper*, and proceeded to alter the words therein.

He changed the titles of the Star Lords into Bodhisattvas, and the Heavenly Lords into Buddhas, and invited a company of monks to worship the Tai Sui, claiming that he had received this transmission from a certain high monk.

The faithful, discerning not truth from falsehood, all came to entreat Shiyuanhui to perform the rites for their removing the Tai Sui’s ill influence.

At that time, a monk expressed his doubt, saying, ‘Is it not improper for us to alter and falsify Taoist scriptures? After all, the Buddha has not transmitted such things.’

Shiyuanhui replied, ‘This is but the divine way establishing teaching. Moreover, all dharmas are Buddha-dharma; the Star Lords of Taoism are but Bodhisattvas of Buddhism. The Great Lord Lao is still a disciple of the Tathāgata Buddha — can he be greater than the Buddha? Have no fear.’ Thus he opened the ritual altar and recited the scriptures, imitating the Taoist manner, and set up a Star Altar, upon which was inscribed, “Venerating this year’s Tai Sui Bodhisattva such and such.”

When Shiyuanhui opened the altar, the Biluo hat fell from his head, but he took no heed.

During the course of the ritual repentance, it seemed as if a General clad in golden armour descended from Heaven, and with a stern voice rebuked them, saying, ‘Ye Sangmen* monks, how dare ye falsify the precious scriptures of the Supreme Lord, and pilfer the profound mysteries of our sect! A monkey wearing a hat! Your guilt is unpardonable!’ Having spoken thus, he raised a golden whip and struck the monks, and Shiyuanhui fainted.

When he came to himself, he was already stricken with paralysis on one side, his mouth continually crying out, ‘Immortals, have mercy upon me!’ Within less than a month, he passed away.

*Note: “Sangmen” is a term referring to Buddhist monks.
