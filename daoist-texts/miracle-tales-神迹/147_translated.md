# The Verified Power of the Compassion-Saving Heavenly Venerable by Chen Wei of Hebei

Chen Wei was a man from Cangzhou in Hebei. In his youth he lost his mother, and at an early age he went abroad to labour. During his time working outside, he came into contact with certain Taoist teachings, and he also taught himself the practice of sitting in meditation and recited the Taoist scriptures. In the year of Xinmao he returned home, and found that his native place had changed greatly; his heart was much rejoiced. That very night Chen Wei drank somewhat with his father, and, drowsy and confused, lay down to sleep.

In a state of bewilderment and deep obscurity, Chen Wei felt that having not come home for many years, he should go forth and see the changes in his old home; so he stepped out of the room. Beneath the moonlight the village appeared tranquil and serene; from the nearby highway there came occasionally the sound of a vehicle’s horn.

As Chen Wei walked he thought to himself, "Life is a phantasm and ever changing. I still remember this ditch, where I in former days with Chen Juan and others caught fish and bathed, ha ha." Just then a voice called out, "Chen Wei, what dost thou here? Come and sit at my house awhile." Chen Wei looked up, and behold, it was his youthful companion Chen Zijun. Chen Wei was much surprised, and said, "How is it thou art at home?" Chen Zijun said, "Ha ha, I also returned a few days ago; I did not expect to meet an old schoolfellow here. Come, come, let us go to my house and sit a while." Chen Wei asked, "Where is thy house?" Chen Zijun pointed to a two-storied building not far off, and said, "There, there it is, very near." Chen Wei looked at the two-storied building, brightly lit; he felt somewhat strange, and said, "So late, thy father and mother should surely be asleep; better it be tomorrow." At this moment Chen Zijun’s countenance suddenly changed; he insisted that Chen Wei must come to his house. Chen Wei was greatly alarmed, and said, "Thou art not Ergou (Ergou being Chen Zijun’s familiar name), who art thou?" In his haste he struck the other a blow, and the head was struck off. Straightway he sought to flee; but fearfully, the headless Chen Zijun pursued him still. Chen Wei felt his feet as if filled with lead, running very slowly; his heart was sorely troubled.

Then he silently repeated the sacred name "Taiyi Compassion-Saving Heavenly Venerable"; repeating it again and again, his feet began to move. When he awoke, he found himself lying in bed, covered with a cold sweat. Chen Wei deemed it strange, and the next day he followed the dream to seek the place. He found that the old home of Chen Zijun had been removed, and the original site had become a scenic lake. At the lake’s edge, a household was burning paper money; Chen Wei went over and saw that it was the mother of Chen Zijun. Upon inquiry he learned that Chen Zijun had been dead for a year.

The Daoist Master Tieguan said, "Here we have a saying, that the souls of those drowned are trapped in the water, and unless a substitute be found, they cannot be released. Could it be that what Chen Wei saw was the phantom of a drowned ghost seeking a substitute? Had he not timely reacted and chanted the sacred name of the Heavenly Venerable, the auspiciousness or misfortune would have been beyond reckoning. The Heavenly Venerable appears according to opportunity; one should call upon him with compassion, to save and ferry all living beings. He is the ferry over the bitter sea of suffering, the compassionate ship of the human world."
