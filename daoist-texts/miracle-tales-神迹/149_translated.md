# Laughter in Free and Easy Wandering and the Temple of the Yellow Emperor

In Jinyun County, Lishui, Zhejiang, there is a good stream, which is the mother river of Jinyun County. Yet it often overflows with great floods. In the year 1996, Taiwanese devotees contributed funds to build the Temple of the Yellow Emperor, which was completed two years later. In the year 1998, when great floods frequently occurred in the south, Jinyun County remained unharmed; the elders all believed it was the illustrious power of the Yellow Emperor that offered protection.

In the year 2012, the county government, in order to enhance the renown of the Xiandu scenic area, consented to the shooting of the new version of "Laughter in Free and Easy Wandering" at the Temple of the Yellow Emperor; without authority they removed the plaques inscribed "Xuanyuan Hall" and "The First Temple under Heaven," replacing them with the signboard of the Huashan Sect. This television drama commenced filming in the third month of the Western calendar. In the fifth month, heavy rains descended, ceaseless and pouring; the waters of the good stream rose, and bridges were submerged. The calamity reached the county town; many streets and buildings were overwhelmed by the floodwaters. Those who understood all considered it a profanation of the deity, a calamity sent from Heaven.

A praise says:  
Lo! The lofty altar and temple restrain Xiandu; its power to quell waters and transform malign influences has its reason.  
Yet when the spirit temple is changed into a theatre, the once good stream becomes an enemy.
