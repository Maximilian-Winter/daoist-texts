# Liao Mingyuan of Jiujiang Tests the "Treatise on Response and Retribution"

Liao Mingyuan was a native of Xiushui in Jiujiang. In the twelfth year of the Republic, at the Immortal's Cave on Mount Lu, he met a Daoist priest, who examined his fate and birth-chart. It was found that he was afflicted by solitary stars and lonely constellations; that he would suffer bereavement of father and mother, and his six close kin; that offspring would come with difficulty; and that his lot was one of poverty, lowliness, loneliness, and coldness. At that time Liao Mingyuan was already thirty years of age, yet still unmarried; his heart was as if on fire with anxiety, and he knelt to entreat a method of deliverance. The Daoist priest took out a copy of the Taishang "Treatise on Response and Retribution" and gave it to Liao, saying, "This is the precious teaching of the Most High, a chapter on response and retribution. If a man can hold to it and receive it, his blessings and happiness will be strengthened and multiplied. The blessings and happiness of man are originally appointed together by the Six Officers of the Southern Dipper in the nether world: chiefly according to the merits and demerits of the ancestors in the nether world, and also according to the good or evil deeds of the man's former life. This is what is called 'bearing the burden.' If one wishes to explain the duty of bearing this burden, he must do many good deeds, so as to dissolve the spirit of resentment and hatred. There are spirits three feet above the head; if you can accumulate good deeds, and be filled with kindly spirit, the spirit of good fortune will issue from you, and you are a lucky man; but if you are full of fierce spirit, and the spirit of cruelty and evil issues from you, then you are a man of evil fortune. Misfortune and fortune have no fixed door; it is man alone who summons them. I hope you will follow the words of the Treatise on Response and Retribution, and on the ninth day of the first month of every year, the birthday of the Jade Emperor, burn incense and pray to the Heaven above; if you do this long, perhaps there will be good fortune." Liao Mingyuan obeyed and practised accordingly; he honoured and supported his parents; repaired bridges and mended roads; showed pity and relief to the lonely and widowed; accumulated merit and did good deeds; restored the Xuantan temple and palace; and so on. In the fifteenth year of the Republic, he married, and soon begot two sons.

All these are perfect deeds of goodness, and the spirits descend with auspiciousness; though it be said that it is Heaven that bestows it, is it not man that makes it? In Daoism it is often said, "My fate is in my own hands and not in Heaven's." When the human heart generates a thought of goodness, though the good be not yet done, the auspicious spirits already support him; if the heart be filled with evil thoughts, though the evil be not yet committed, the evil spirits follow him. Knowing this single thought, one may command ghosts and spirits; one may wrest creation and change destiny! We, disciples of the Mysterious Gate, how should we not strive to practise it?
