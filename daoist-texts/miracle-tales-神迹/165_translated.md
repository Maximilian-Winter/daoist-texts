# The Taoist Zhang Renbiao’s False Words Bring on Karmic Retribution; Illness Lasts for Months without Cure

The Taoist Zhang Renbiao, learned and versatile, skilled in expounding the Way and delivering discourses, frequently held forth in palaces and temples, explaining the principles and meaning of the Taoist doctrines. One day, his speech was frivolous and extravagant, departing from the true import of the Way; the audience dispersed one after another, and many cast blame upon him. Afterwards, he fell ill and took medicine, but his sickness did not abate for several months.

One night he dreamed that the officers and foot soldiers of the Department of Life’s Destiny came to seize him at his dwelling, as if arresting a criminal in the world. On the road they passed over a wide plain covered with thorns and brambles; he was dragged and drawn along swiftly as if flying, his clothes caught upon the trees and bushes, the thorns piercing his body with unbearable pain. After travelling some thirty li, he saw at a distance a black city, from which smoke and flames rose; drawing near, he perceived it to be a city of iron. The guards at the gates were beings with the bodies of men but heads of beasts; some had four mouths and eight eyes, others ten arms and nine heads; their teeth were like frost and snow, their fangs like sharp swords; truly the scene was as if the hells portrayed in the temples of the Way. Entering the city gates, there were palaces of pearl and jade, towers of jade, and halls of gold; such sights as ordinary men cannot behold. This place differed from the Underworld’s Pass; after walking four or five li within, there was nothing to be seen. Zhang Renbiao slowly asked his captors, ‘What place is this? How is it different from what we saw outside the gates?’ The mounted officer replied, ‘This is the Palace of the Most High Lord Taiyi; beyond this palace lies my own department.’ When Renbiao heard the name of the Palace of Lord Taiyi, he suddenly recalled that he frequently exhorted others to recite the hallowed name “Taiyi the Lord who Saves from Suffering,” which can relieve all difficulties and bring blessings and auspiciousness.

At that moment, a light struck upon his spirit; he thought, ‘Now that I have come to the Palace of the Most High Lord Taiyi, why not recite the sacred name of Lord Taiyi more earnestly?’ So he loudly chanted more than ten times the phrase “Answering the Voice’s Call, Taiyi the Lord who Saves from Suffering.”

The officer who held him laughed aloud, saying, ‘You come to draw water only when you are athirst; it is like biting your own navel—how can it avail now?’ At once he heard the laughter of many around him; yet he again loudly recited more than ten times the sacred name “Answering the Voice’s Call, Taiyi the Lord who Saves from Suffering,” his tone full of lamentation, his voice mournful and piercing; tears fell and soaked his garments.

Suddenly, a beam of red light shone upon Renbiao on all sides; the mounted officers at once departed, leaving Renbiao alone in the brightness. Looking back upon the surrounding four quarters, the mountains and rivers were bright and beautiful, the clouds and things serene.

Presently, the Lord who Saves from Suffering appeared before him with more than a thousand attendants. Renbiao bowed in reverence to the Lord, wept and sobbed, confessing his lifetime’s errors, praying that the Lord who Saves from Suffering would pardon him. The Lord sat upon a lotus of five colours; around His seat blazed fire, like tongues of flame encircling the Lord; within the fire were nine-coloured divine lights. The Lord’s whole body and crown glowed with blazing rays, shooting forth like myriad spears and swords, covered by a canopy of the seven precious jewels. Behind were blossoming trees of precious wood, illuminating the eight directions; true men of strength, diamond kings, jade maidens, and golden youths crowded the attendants. The Yin and Yang Taiyi, and forty-six gods, led their ranks and attended on either side; cloud-chariots and feathered canopies filled all the sky.

The Lord who Saves from Suffering said to Renbiao, ‘Men in the world must be greatly careful of the threefold karma and the ten evil deeds; among the three karmas, the transgression of the mouth is chief. One who speaks falsely causes ten thousand to act falsely. The man who speaks falsely is foremost in guilt. Your threefold karma is guarded by me; it is by my saving care that you have escaped the pain of the nether world. Your lifespan is ended; you should not have been returned. Now I pardon you again for seven years, to lead and transform you in the world of the living. By means of my image being widely displayed among men, I open the door to progress and make clear the essentials of the path to goodness. It is my hope you will exert yourself to practice it.’

When he had ended, He ordered a boy to guide Renbiao back to his place of residence. Afterwards, his illness was suddenly cured. A few days later, Renbiao went out of the city by the Spring Bright Gate for some matter, and saw among the wormwood and brambles the traces of his former footsteps. Observing carefully, he saw on the ends of the thorns snags of purple threads of his clothes, and slight traces of blood upon the thorns; truly these were the roads he had passed that night while being pursued.

Later, Renbiao used his own money to paint the image of the Lord who Saves from Suffering in the Temple of Solemn Clarity, and also outside the East Luo Pass he made many copies of the sacred image, awakening the confused masses and leading them to worship the true faith. Zhang Renbiao died seven years thereafter.
