# The Daoist of Xichang and the Practice of Planchette

Li Xuande, a Daoist of the Guangcheng Altar, was a native of Xichang in Sichuan. In his early years he entered the Dao, and was versed without exception in such arts as Qimen, astronomy, and the rites of prayer and exorcism. Yet by nature he was a man of gaiety and refinement, and was wont to say, "To be unworldly is to bear the bone of an immortal; to be affectionate is to have the heart of the Dao." He had likewise studied the ancient zither and poetry, and the feelings of spring and autumn he often committed to verse.

In the spring of the gengyin year, Li Xuande spoke with his companions and friends: "Now the spring light is bright and fair, the flowers shine and the willows are shaded, the orioles sing and the swallows chatter. Yet within the study there is naught but boredom; why not try the planchette and amuse ourselves?" All agreed, so they burned incense and invited the spirits. After a time, the rice sieve trembled, and a celestial spirit descended. Li Xuande asked, "Pray tell, whence cometh the spirit that is here?" The answer came, "I am the poor Daoist Zhao Lanqing, once a priestess of the Great Ming, at the Court of Heaven. In the disorder of the jiashen year, I died for my country, and cast myself into a well; now three hundred years have passed." In the interchange of words, the priestess spoke with refined and gentle diction, her literary grace shining forth. From that time onward, whenever Li Xuande had leisure, he would employ the planchette, and converse with this priestess.

Li said: "To be graced by your presence at the true altar is surely a matter of fate! Can you manifest yourself, that I may behold the form of an immortal?" The immortal lady demurred again and again, but at length consented. He beheld a priestess, her complexion fair and comely, her bearing like the orchid. Attired in a robe of feathers white as snow, her shoulders veiled with clouds and her mantle like rosy clouds, her feet shod with embroidered shoes bearing floral patterns, her girdle and pendants tinkling and radiant. Speaking of the affairs of the Ming dynasty, all were vividly before her eyes; the grievous events of that time caused her to sigh with regret. Li asked, "You have died for your country these many years; why do you not seek rebirth among men?" She replied, "I died with a heart loyal and steadfast to my sovereign, and my love for the state remains unforgotten. Therefore my spirit is undying, and I have dwelt many years in this cavernous abode, cultivating myself. Were I to be reborn, all would be renewed. Better to choose a place of quietude, and continue my practice, that when my merit is complete, the imperial summons shall come to lead me forth."

Li Xuande saw Lanqing, her grace surpassing, her breath like the orchid; he desired sincerity and truth, but dared not speak directly, and so entrusted his thoughts to a poem: "The mysterious court is deep and lonely; alone I sit and pity the fair spring. I think afar the inner chamber of orchids, and wonder if there the lovesickness is deep?" Lanqing saw this poem and said, "The cavern dwelling is long and pure; unused to converse with men and women. After the peach blossoms of the third month, surely the azure phoenix will come to watch." From that time she no longer descended. Li Xuande repented the rashness of his former ways.

In the autumn of the gengyin year, Li Xuande at the Green Phoenix Teahouse in Jinli, Chengdu, met a fair lady; her voice, countenance, and bearing were like those of Zhao Lanqing. The poor Daoist had once heard that man has three souls and seven spirits; might what Li Xuande saw be but one soul?
