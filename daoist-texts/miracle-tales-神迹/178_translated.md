# The Story of Daoist Liu Yongning of Mount Qingcheng

Daoist Liu Yongning was a native of Luling in Jiangyou. Born into a family that revered the Way, from childhood he was imbued with the teachings of the Dao. During the Cultural Revolution he was publicly denounced, and his wife and family were scattered. After his rehabilitation, he resolved to retire to Mount Qingcheng to pursue reclusion and cultivation. There he closed himself off for three years, never descending the mountain.

In the year 1996, he suddenly came to dwell at Qingyang Palace as a guest. The temple arranged for him to keep watch in the Eight Trigrams Pavilion. When Daoist Liu kept watch, he merely sat upright with eyes closed. Pilgrims burned incense and bowed, but he was indifferent to them. The temple authorities were much dissatisfied with this. Daoist Liu said, "Do not be angry; in the evening I will watch over your parking grounds." The head of the temple replied, "Then we are much obliged to the venerable cultivator."

Accordingly, Daoist Liu went at night to guard the parking lot, sitting cross-legged and silent, wrapped only in a thin woollen blanket, even in the depths of winter.

Daoist Liu did not eat the five grains, but long made use of such herbs as poria, pine needles, wolfberries, and chrysanthemums; when thirsty, he drank cold water. Sometimes he would go days without food, yet his spirit did not wane. In climbing the mountains, even the young could not keep pace with him. He was skilled in incantations and charms.

Once, while wandering on Mount Qingcheng, a visitor slipped and fell, his hand bleeding profusely. At that moment Daoist Liu happened by, and the visitor sought his aid. The Daoist said, "It is nothing, it is nothing." With the jade seal in his left hand and the sword sign in his right, he traced a few characters in the air over the bleeding wound, and the blood soon ceased flowing.

Again, a lay devotee, afflicted with ulcers and sores, came seeking healing out of respect for him. Daoist Liu traced some secret characters, and presently the pus flowed forth of itself. Sometimes he used incense to draw the figures, sometimes burnt yellow paper, and at other times merely rubbed some dust upon the patient. In these various ways, diseases often yielded to his hand.

Hence many in the Chengdu region and from afar came seeking his healing. Some offered gifts in gratitude. But Daoist Liu accepted not a single coin, saying, "The old Daoist desires no money, desires no money." At times, he accepted money, only to give it away at once to the poor by the roadside. When prosperous families came asking for treatment and brought many gifts, he would neither accept their money nor heal them, saying he did not possess the skill, or feigning madness by singing and chanting, or sitting quietly without rising.

Some asked, "Why do you not treat them?" Daoist Liu replied, "There are diseases in this world which are due to entanglements of past karma, and cannot be cured by methods or spells."

For over three years he dwelt in Qingyang Palace, when suddenly he told the community of cultivators, "My work is now complete, and I may return." In the year 1999, on the third day of the third month, he passed away in meditation.

About the month of May, a fellow Daoist came from Mount Hua to Qingyang Palace and said, "A venerable cultivator named Liu Yongning came to Yuquan Monastery, having come from your Qingyang Palace. He stayed a few days and then returned. I wonder where he keeps watch?" The resident cultivators all replied, "Daoist Liu passed away in meditation on the third day of the third month this year."

It was then understood that what had appeared was but a phantom to signify his corpse's dissolution; in truth he had already ascended to the Purple Palace, taken his place among the celestial host, and wandered the Five Sacred Mountains.
