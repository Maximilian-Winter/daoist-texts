# Cao Yongchun's Exploration of the Five Elders' Cave

Cao Yongchun, a Daoist of Jianfu Palace on Mount Qingcheng, was a man of eccentric conduct; his fellow Daoists accounted him as one mad. In the year 1992, he suddenly told his comrades at Jianfu Palace, “Yesterday I dreamed of the Green Snake; she invited me to visit the Five Elders’ Cave.” For Mount Qingcheng was originally the place where Bai Suzhen and the Green Snake cultivated; the Green Snake and the White Snake had also practiced in the Five Elders’ Cave on Mount Emei. Mount Emei was a Daoist grotto of the heavens; tradition said that the Five Elders’ Cave was the path leading to the immortal realms, but none had ever ventured therein. The fellow Daoists regarded Cao Yongchun’s words as the ravings of madness, and took no heed thereof. Shi Puming of Wenshu Monastery in Chengdu was well acquainted with Master Cao, and upon hearing that Master Cao intended to go to the Five Elders’ Cave on Mount Emei, readily requested to accompany him.

Master Cao and Monk Puming arrived at the mouth of the Five Elders’ Cave on Mount Emei; at the entrance they set out offerings of fruit, lit three incense sticks, and burned some paper money. They prayed, saying, “Mountain spirits and earth deities, this humble Daoist is come at invitation; I pray you grant us safe passage.” After prayer, they took a flashlight and proceeded into the cave.

The mouth of the cave grew narrower, admitting only one man to crawl through. After about five minutes, the cave opened wide; within was cold and damp, from time to time bats flew forth, while venomous snakes coiled beneath their feet. Monk Puming said, “May we suffer from lack of air if we go further?” Master Cao answered, “No matter; since they have summoned me, there is surely no danger.” So they continued onward, though the cave branched many times, with now and then deep pools and marshes. After about an hour, Master Cao said, “See, ahead there is light; we should soon arrive.” They walked towards the shining place, but the light shifted to another spot. They moved again towards the gleam; again it fled elsewhere. Thus repeated thrice, when faint warmth was perceived. After walking a further distance, the two found themselves outside the cave. Meeting two tourists, Monk Puming hastened to inquire, “Amitabha, may I ask where this is?” The tourists replied, “Master, this is Xianfeng Temple on Mount Emei!” Only then did the two realise they were no longer within the cave.

Cao Yongchun was filled with anger, saying, “That Green Snake has deceived this old Daoist! It enrages me!” At that moment, a voice came from Xianfeng Rock, saying, “The secrets of the immortals lie in concealment. I had intended to invite you to the fairyland; but who bade you bring a monk with you? Were it not for the respect this monk shows to the Dao and its laws, my disciples and followers would have bitten you to death long since in the Five Elders’ Cave. And you still say I have deceived you?” At this, Master Cao was full of regret.
