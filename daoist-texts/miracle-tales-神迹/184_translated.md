# The Legendary Story of the Veneration of the Portrait of Celestial Master Zhang

In Pengcheng (now Xuzhou), when Liu Cunxi was but a child, he wandered to the Tangxing Temple, where he beheld the portrait of the Celestial Master. His heart was filled with profound reverence, and he traced the image upon silk, preserving it to offer continual veneration. For he had heard that whosoever devotedly worshipped Celestial Master Zhang with single-heartedness would receive his protection.

Afterwards, when Liu Cun had grown to be an official, whithersoever he was appointed, he ever carried with him this portrait, and the incense and offerings were never wanting for a single day. In a certain year, when rebel armies advanced and the city was taken, he fled with many others, taking nothing with him save this portrait of the Celestial Master. Along the road, more than thirty companions were slain by brigands, but he alone emerged unscathed.

One day, he came to a place where a great multitude of refugees had gathered, their voices clamorous; yet he discerned among them the voice of his lost wife. Filled with surprise and joy, he hastened to call to her, and they went forth together. The husband and wife came to the forested mountains of Dayan Rock in Yangzhou, where the place seemed yet to be tranquil. There they built a humble hut, and dwelt together. As they had no children, their life was not unduly hard. They resolved to retire from public office, no longer to pursue fame and profit. The local people were very kind to them, and seeing that they lacked means of livelihood, often brought them oil, salt, firewood, and rice. Each day, idle and at ease, they would ascend the mountain and gather cypress seeds, which they burned in offering before the portrait of the Celestial Master.

But it came to pass that peace was restored; his friend, Governor Song, rose to high office, and prepared official robes, earnestly inviting him to return. Though he declined many times, he was compelled to accept and take up his post. Yet war broke out anew, and he was forced again to flee, this time to a mountain in Shazhou. Having dwelt there but four months, the rebels came searching the hills. Seeing that the place was no longer secure, he prepared to journey on to Pinglu, and with his wife resumed the road.

On a certain night, they encountered more than ten brigands, who were escorting several captives. Unable to escape and sore afraid, they thought that surely now they must fall into the hands of the robbers. Yet, to their wonder, these enemies passed by them as if they were invisible, and they arrived safely at their destination.

Later, he was ordered to transfer to Sichuan, and there he continued with single-hearted devotion to venerate the portrait of the Celestial Master. Wherever he went, he recounted how the Celestial Master had protected him, and thus this tale became a cherished narrative.
