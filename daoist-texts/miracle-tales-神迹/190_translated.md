# The Custom of Ascending Heights to Avoid Pestilence on the Double Ninth Festival

It is related that in the time of the Later Han, there was a pestilential demon in the River Ru, which, whenever it appeared, caused sickness in every household, and even daily carried off lives. The people of that region suffered grievously from the ravages of this demon, their misery was beyond description.

At that time in Runan county there was a young man named Heng Jing; in one year the pestilence took away his parents, and he himself narrowly escaped death. After his recovery, Heng Jing bade farewell to his beloved wife and the elders and villagers of his home, resolved to go forth in search of immortals and to learn arts whereby he might rid the people of their calamities. Enduring hardships and perils, he at length found in an ancient mountain a celestial being of boundless power. The immortal, moved by Heng Jing's tireless spirit and his resolve to deliver the people from harm, consented to receive him as a disciple, giving him a precious sword for subduing demons, and secretly imparted to him the art of the demon-subduing sword. Heng Jing neglected neither rest nor food, and practised day and night until he attained extraordinary skill.

One day the immortal called Heng Jing to him, and said: ‘Tomorrow is the ninth day of the ninth month; the pestilential demon is about to arise and do evil once more. Now that you have completed your training, you should return to rid the people of this scourge!’ Then the immortal gave Heng Jing a packet of cornel leaves, a flask of chrysanthemum wine, and taught him secrets for avoiding evil spirits, bidding him forthwith to mount a celestial crane and hasten home.

Heng Jing returned to his native place, and on the morning of the ninth day of the ninth month, led the villagers to a nearby mountain, distributing to each a cornel leaf and a cup of chrysanthemum wine according to the immortal’s instructions. At midday, a fierce wind arose, a north wind blowing up suddenly; the sky and earth grew dark; with several piercing howls, the pestilential demon burst forth from the River Ru and rushed to the foot of the mountain.

But at that moment the demon suddenly smelled the strange fragrance of the cornel leaves and the mellow scent of the chrysanthemum wine, and its face changed colour; it trembled and dared not advance. In the twinkling of an eye, Heng Jing, brandishing the demon-subduing sword, rushed down the mountain. After several fierce encounters, Heng Jing pierced the pestilential demon to death, and the plague was thus dispelled.

From that time forth, every year on the ninth day of the ninth month according to the lunar calendar, the custom of ascending heights to avoid pestilence has been handed down from generation to generation.
