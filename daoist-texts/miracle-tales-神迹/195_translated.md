# The Daoist Luan Ba Slays the Demonic Spirit of the Temple

In the region of Sichuan there was a Daoist named Luan Ba. From his youth he began to study the Way, and afterwards his fame spread abroad. He was summoned from the mountains and made the officer of public affairs; after several years he was promoted to the prefect of Yuzhang (now Jiangxi), wherein lies Mount Lu. There was a certain temple there, of which it was said that the temple spirit was very efficacious, able to converse with outsiders behind the curtains; and when drinking wine, a more wondrous thing was seen, the cup flying in the air to and fro; at the moment of drinking, it would pause in mid-air; when the cup was empty it would descend and be refilled.

Travellers from afar often came to the temple to offer sacrifices and make vows; when the spirit was pleased, it ensured that the boats on the rivers passed smoothly and without hazard. When Luan Ba took office, it was his custom to visit the temple and pay homage to the spirit. But when he went thither, the temple spirit had disappeared to some unknown place, and Luan Ba immediately understood that there was some secret matter afoot.

After a thorough investigation, he declared: ‘The one dwelling in this temple is a demonic spirit. It has assumed the guise of a heavenly officer, wielding power and grace, and for many years has done harm to the people. It must be severely dealt with.’ Having entrusted his official duties to his deputy, he himself went to pursue the demon. Were it not timely captured, it might wander the world at large, causing men to set up temples for it and offer sacrifices of beasts, and it might bring forth diseases, compelling the people to entreat it with costly rites.

Luan Ba followed it in pursuit, arriving at a certain place, where he summoned the local mountain god, the earth god, and the river god, and questioned them about the demon’s whereabouts. Pressed hard, the demon was forced to flee from Yuzhang Prefecture, and came to Qi Prefecture (now the eastern part of Shandong), many thousands of li distant from Mount Lu. There it changed its form and became a handsome scholar, discoursing fluently upon the Book of Changes, the Book of Songs, the Book of Documents, the Rites, and the Spring and Autumn Annals. The prefect of Qi, seeing him, took great liking, and gave his daughter in marriage to him.

Luan Ba had long sought the demon, and at last learned that the fiend had fled to Qi Prefecture, and was now the son-in-law of the prefect. He accordingly petitioned the court, resigning his post as prefect of Yuzhang, and journeyed with great haste to Qi. Upon arriving, he called upon the prefect. The scholar dared not come forth, but fled to the back yard. Luan Ba said to the prefect: ‘Your son-in-law is not a man, but an aged demon. He once assumed the temple spirit’s guise at Mount Lu, and fled here when I pressed him hard. Today I have come expressly to capture him.’

The prefect was doubtful and uncertain, and sent word for his son-in-law to come forth. Luan Ba said: ‘To call him out will be easy.’ He borrowed pen, ink, and desk from the prefect, and drew a talisman. When finished, he gave a long shout. Suddenly, as if unseen hands took the talisman away. When it reached the back hall, the scholar said to his wife: ‘This time it is death certain.’ While speaking, tears ran down his face. Having no choice, he took up the talisman and carried it forth. Upon entering the great hall, he saw Luan Ba and shrank back, not daring to advance. Luan Ba cried out: ‘Old demon, show thy true form!’ The scholar at once changed to his original shape, which was a great wildcat, and beating his head earnestly begged for life. Luan Ba commanded: ‘Behead him!’ A sword flew down from the air, and the wildcat’s head rolled off. The prefect’s daughter, who had borne a son by the scholar, was also transformed into a wildcat, and so was killed together with the demon.

Luan Ba’s fame for pursuing and capturing demonic spirits spread far and wide, and ghosts and goblins feared him. Yuzhang had long been plagued by such demons, especially the one-legged kind, which were most violent. After Luan Ba returned from Qi Prefecture, still residing at Yuzhang, all ghosts and spirits therein held their peace and ceased their mischief.
