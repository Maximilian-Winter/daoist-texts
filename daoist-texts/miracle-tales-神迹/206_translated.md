# The Daoist of the Southern Mountain Playing the Xiao to Summon a Fox

Yesterday I saw in the space a set of pictures, wherein a Daoist priest was playing the dongxiao upon the grassland, and thereby summoned a fox. The fox even approached the Daoist with familiar intimacy; I was greatly amazed. For the fox is a creature of much spirit, and animals are very sensitive to men, fearing to approach them, being able to perceive the dangers of mankind.

There is a story in the Liezi: A man of the sea delighted in the Ou birds. Every morning on the sea he would go to the Ou birds; when the Ou birds came, they would perch a hundred times but not alight. His father said, 'I have heard that all Ou birds follow you; bring one to me, that I may delight in it.' The next day on the sea, the Ou birds fluttered but would not alight.

If you harbour no thought of harming animals, they are glad to dwell with you; if once such thought arises, the animals keep far from you. Therefore, if these two Daoist priests were not of excellent cultivation, broad-hearted and compassionate, with no thought of harming living beings in their hearts, the fox would not have approached them. Another possibility is, this was a fox in cultivation, coming to form a karmic bond with the Daoist. Indeed, there are many stories of foxes in cultivation, and many legends of foxes becoming immortals. Howsoever it be, this is indeed a most wondrous thing.

The Daoist priest on the left, who plays the xiao, I met in 2009 at Chisong Palace in Jinhua. At that time he came from the Southern Mountain, assigned to watch the San Sheng Hall; when idle, he liked to play the xiao, and his appearance was not ignoble. Then my mind was proud and arrogant; I took no account of this old Daoist, thinking that he could neither recite scriptures nor perform high rites, nor had he read many books. He did not stay long at Chisong, but left Jinhua and went to Mount Putuo in Ningbo, to bow before Guanyin Bodhisattva. My senior brother Liu of Ningbo also saw him; then he played the xiao at Mount Putuo, attracting a crowd of tourists who laughed and said, "Here comes a Daoist to spoil the place," ha ha. But afterwards no more news of him was heard.

The Daoist of the Iron Crown said: In general, those who cultivate the Way have within them the Tao and virtue, and without manifest simplicity. "They do not desire to be bustling as jade, or noisy as stone." The more a man cultivates, the more the splendour falls away, and he appears like an ordinary man. As it is said, "Only great heroes can preserve their true colours; the true men of distinction manifest their natural grace." When immortals appear, they often show themselves with the guise of ordinary appearance, sometimes as beggars in the street, sometimes drunken and singing wildly, sometimes in tattered garments, sometimes mad and frantic. They sport in the world, passing with the course of fate to edify others. Guan Yinzi said: "The sage has words, actions, and thoughts, and so he is like men. He never has no words, no actions, no thoughts; and so he is unlike men." Ordinary men, with their vulgar eyes, admire vanity. They see true immortals but cannot revere them; they meet perfect men but take them as common. This is because their mind and nature have not yet arrived, and therefore they cannot meet true teachers and cultivate the supreme Way.
