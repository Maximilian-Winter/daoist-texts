# The Child of Danjiangkou Who Disrespected the Spirits and Was Stricken with a Strange Illness

Li Sanrong, a man of Danjiangkou, was an inheritor of the orthodox Daoist tradition, skilled in the Daoist arts, and renowned throughout his native village.

One day there came to Li the Daoist a sister-in-law of a three-year-old boy of Danjiangkou city. She said, “In our household there is a child who sleeps by day, but by night must be held in his grandmother’s arms; if she lets him go, he weeps. He has been in the hospital for twenty days, and we have spent more than six thousand (coins); yet no doctor can find what ails him. At the hospital they were at their wit’s end, so they sent us to the emergency ward of Taihe Hospital in Shiyan; there also no cause could be discovered. But the child is still unwell.”

The Daoist asked to see a picture of the child. He beheld that the child’s brows and space between were blackened, a countenance full of dark and evil qi. Then he cast the lots and computed the hexagram of Qimen Dunjia. The star Tian Rui was above, and the Teng She (Soaring Snake) was in attendance; this was the cause of ghosts and spirits. The place was southeast, corresponding to the Earth branch Chen, which is a water reservoir. The Chen being Earth presides over the third month. There was the star Tian Chong, the proper spirit. The Daoist then told the family, “Your child, in the third month of this year, played by the water reservoir or riverbank, and so offended the spirits. Hence this strange illness.”

The Daoist said the child was struck by evil; but the family would not believe it. The Daoist did not insist further. After they returned home and at midday the child’s grandmother dreamed that the Earth God came to her. He said he was the Earth God of Liangshui River in Danjiangkou City; by the river there was no Earth Temple, and the Earth God sat upon a great stone there. In the third month of the lunar year, this child and a company of other children were playing by the river. To show how strong he was, the child pushed a great red stone from the riverbank into the river. Because the child pushed the stone, naturally he fell ill. The Earth God bade the family to attend to that place properly, lest the child should linger in hospital and lose his life.

Then the old woman awoke suddenly. Thinking on what the Daoist had said in the morning, she hastened to Li Sanrong’s house to entreat him to help resolve the matter. The Daoist said, “The relief is not difficult. First you must prepare the three sacrifices and the five offerings, burn much spirit-money, and apologize to the Earth God, confessing your offence. Then clear away the heap of stones, and enshrine the Earth God.” The family hastened to assent, promising to comply. The stone which held the Earth God’s spirit was cleared away in less than twenty minutes. The child then vomited much black and filthy matter. The family, alarmed, wanted to take him to Wuhan for emergency aid; but the Daoist said, “It is nothing; to vomit is to be relieved.” After vomiting, the child said he felt drowsy; the grandmother held him and he fell asleep. She tried to set him down on the bed, but he did not weep; he slept soundly until two in the night. Then the child sat up, saying, “Just now a white-bearded old gentleman came and touched my head, telling me to rise. Grandmother, I am hungry.” At this the grandmother wept. There was no food in the hospital, so she gave the child some biscuits; the child then slept peacefully the whole night, and early the next morning was discharged and returned home.

The Iron-Crowned Daoist said: In the Zhuangzi there is mention of the village spirit whose spirit is lodged in a tree. Even now there remain Earth Gods whose spirits dwell in stones. The Earth God is the officer of the spirit realm nearest to men, who can communicate between heaven and earth, enter the nether world, and pass through darkness and mystery. They are the grassroots officials of the divine realm, charged with securing the peace of their district. Therefore we all should bow respectfully and fear to offend. If one should transgress, it is urgent to offer sacrifice and confess.

Yet in the ten directions and the three worlds, in the void of space, where is there not a spirit? Above your head, three feet high, is a spirit. In the mystery there is a fixed order. Some do evil secretly, thinking that none knows; but in truth the ghosts and spirits judge, the Three Officials examine, and good and evil are clearly distinguished. The good naturally gather blessing; the evil sooner or later suffer calamity. Do not think to escape by secret deeds; cherish no such wishful thinking.
