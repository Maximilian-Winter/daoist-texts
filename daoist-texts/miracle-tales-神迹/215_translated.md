# On Cultivating Purity and Practising the Way without Seeking Response or Reward

Some time ago, a lay disciple came to ask me: "Daoist Master, I often recite the sacred titles of the Heavenly Worthy, print scriptures and make images, donate money to repair temples; yet why is my fortune still ever adverse? Today, while driving, I met with another accident and suffered great loss. Where lies the fault? I pray you, Daoist Master, have mercy and instruct me."

The Iron-Crowned Daoist thought: This condition doubtless other Daoist brethren have encountered also.

Firstly, to practise goodness without attachment to goodness.

The Tao Te Ching says: "The highest virtue is not virtuous; the lower virtue clings to virtue." The Scripture of Purity and Tranquillity says: "He who clings is not called virtuous." When we do good works and practise kindness, in our hearts we think: "This is a good deed, it accumulates merit, and there will be blessings as the reward." This indeed is also a kind of fixation, selfish in nature; to help others with a real purpose to "benefit oneself," and therefore cannot be called genuine "goodness." For in doing this deed, one expects reward. It may be called a "transaction," or an "investment." Therefore the Scripture of Purity and Tranquillity says: "He who clings is not called virtuous." Such cannot be called true "virtue."

Some, setting out to seek blessing and reward, after long time fail to attain blessings, and so grow doubtful and repentant, turning these into demonic hindrances. The ancients say: "To confer kindness without seeking return, and to deal with others without repentance."

The cultivator of the Way does good not with the thought that thereby he shall obtain some reward; but because doing the deed accords with the great Way, and peace comes to his heart. Only thus is goodness truly practised. The merchant invests expecting return; but the cultivator of the Way does good beyond profit and the world, caring not for return.

Secondly, in cultivating purity and following the Way one must not hope for spiritual response.

Some lay disciples go to the temple to conduct Daoist rituals, hoping for efficacious results. Even some masters of high Taoist arts proclaim the efficacy and wondrous effects of their rituals. Little do they know that yin and yang interdepend; where there is efficacy, there is also inefficacy. Thus the ancestral masters, when performing rituals, never dared to say their works were efficacious.

In the Record of the Words of the Perfected White of the Sea Jade, there is this passage of dialogue.

The Master of Deliverance, speaking with Zi Shu concerning talismanic water, said: "Those who seek it are not all sincere believers; some seek it only to try it, and when I have tried to give it to them, often it does not work."

The Ancestral Master heard and said: "You must not take their doubt as false and your reception as true; whether it works or not is another matter."

The Ancestral Master further said: "Do not ask if it is efficacious or not; do not ask if it is true or not; take the hand and go; do not raise any thought."

A disciple asked the White Ancestral Master: "Some who come to seek talismanic water have no faith. I have tried to give them the water, sometimes it works, sometimes not." The White Jade Cicada Ancestral Master said: "Your attitude is wrong; they come with doubt (falsehood), you receive with sincerity (truth); whether it works or not is their affair."

Thus it is in cultivation of purity and following the Way. Some come to the temple to perform rituals and ask: "Does this ritual have effect? Will my fortune improve? When will the results appear?" As ritual masters, to have such questions is already to have lost the heart of faith. To hold doubt towards the ritual, how can one hope to connect with the spirits?

Some burn incense and offer to spirits, yet summon evil spirits. Why so? Because their hearts harbour desires; thus the ghosts and monsters assume the shapes they desire. In truth, these are but reflections of their own inner world. The cultivator who desires nothing leaves the spirits helpless.

The Ancestral Masters established the ritual of purity with the original intent to consider the worldly people, whose body and mind are scattered and impure. Therefore the ritual of purity is set to purify the body by vegetarian fare and bathing. By precepts, solemn demeanour, chanting hymns, meditative thought, reciting scriptures, and incantations, the heart is purified and made steadfast. Through confession, the heart is uplifted and comforted. The establishment of divine teaching and the Way are all expedients, methods for setting forth the teachings, to lead us to discover the self within the heart, and not for any external or utilitarian end.

We sincerely take refuge in the Heavenly Worthy and the Great Way, and worship the Highest Saints and Perfected Ones. This is to remind us not to forget the "Way." The Great Way has no beginning nor end, yet brings forth all things. The Highest Saints and Perfected Ones are the condensation of the Tao Qi, the embodiment of the Great Way. We must learn from the Ancestral Masters, not forget their teachings, and hope that through continual cultivation we may attain the realm of union with the true Way, and thereby realize long life and enduring vision.
