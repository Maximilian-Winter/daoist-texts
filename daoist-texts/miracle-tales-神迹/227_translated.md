# Zhang He’s Return and the Efficacy of the Celestial Office’s Silver

The wife of Zhang He of Chengdu had been deceased for three years; he himself had raised troops in Western Sichuan — in the time of the Three Kingdoms, Western Sichuan comprised what is now the eastern part of Sichuan Province and the entirety of Chongqing Municipality, centred on the Chengdu Plain, bounded on the north by Hanzhong, on the east by the Three Gorges, on the south by Yibin, and on the west by the Longmen Mountains — to prosecute war against Huang Chao. He encamped at Xingping (present-day Guanzhong, Shaanxi).

At that time the Feng family, father and son, neighbours of his, before setting out for the front, had left thirty thousand qian of coin in the keeping of Zhang He’s wife. Later, the Feng father and son fell in battle, and these coins were sought out and expended by Zhang He’s wife. Not long thereafter she also died. Unexpectedly, a dispute arose in the netherworld; the soul of Zhang He’s wife was pursued by the Feng father and son, demanding the repayment of the money.

Six years had passed since Zhang He’s wife had made use of the silver. Only recently did the Celestial Office issue a judgment, declaring that Zhang He’s wife had no malicious intent in not returning the money, but had known of the Feng father and son’s deaths in battle and was compelled to appropriate the funds for lack of opportunity to repay. It was adjudged that Zhang He’s wife must compensate the Feng father and son with three thousand guan of coin, and thus the matter was settled. Zhang He’s wife informed Zhang He that after the twenty-fifth day of the twelfth lunar month the various bureaus and offices of the netherworld would undergo their year-end transfer of duties, and the offices would close for the new year celebrations. Therefore, the money must be repaid before the twenty-fifth day of the twelfth month, by burning paper money at the Celestial Office treasury bell in the Northern Emperor’s Temple of the Jade Bureau (now north of Chengdu city), with one sheet of paper counted as one guan of coin.

Other officials of the bureaus concerned with this case must also be served in turn, just as in the world of men. On the twenty-third day of the twelfth month, in the third year of Guanghua, Zhang He went to the Northern Emperor’s Temple and performed all that his wife had instructed; the debts were thus fully discharged. That night, in a dream, Zhang He’s wife came to express thanks, and then departed peacefully.
