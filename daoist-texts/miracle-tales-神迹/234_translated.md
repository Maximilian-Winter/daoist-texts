# The Result of Deceitful Learning of the Methods: Sudden Death by Violence

In the year 2019, there was a devout believer who said that he had been possessed by an evil spirit. Truly, every year we meet with many such cases. After conversing with him, it became known that this believer gathered the manuals of methods from many places, and practiced the secret talismanic inscriptions by himself upon paper; yet after drawing them he could not properly keep them. Once in a dream he had a warning, but it was only that once, and he took no heed. In truth, the original heart of seeking the Dao and cultivating the Way is in all men; but when one has attained a certain stage, many gradually lose themselves.

This believer was such a one. After mastering many methods of drawing talismans and some Daoist arts, he donned the ritual vestments, and began to call himself a high master. Such men have we seen many. When adding friends, he was yet an ordinary devout believer and donor; even in conversation, his knowledge of Daoist matters was but superficial. A year later he had become the head of some sect or could read characters for divination, cast lots, do geomantic repairs of storehouses, and others suddenly became great masters of family traditions or some particular school.

This believer had no transmission at all; according to the manuals he wrote a talisman for warding off evil for the family involved. The result was that not only was it ineffective, but the evil spirit came upon him. Even during the face-to-face discussion, the evil spirit suddenly appeared and bit his head; at that moment the believer was seized with headache and dizziness. After the spirit was driven away, the conversation had to be stopped, and the believer was sent to rest.

Later, in examining his offences, they were found to be very grave. He was taught to repent by worship and confession; but alas, that year he still followed his own will. At the end of 2019, he suddenly died by violence.

Whether it be Daoist methods or secret talismanic inscriptions and charms, they require a transmission and an oath sworn before Heaven and Earth, dividing the rings and sealing the tickets, the petitions to the Three Officials, and a series of complex procedures before they can be properly learned. How can a Daoist without transmission have the power to marshal troops and direct the thunder officials? To obtain the Daoist methods without following the orthodox path is itself an unrighteous act, and hard to obtain divine aid. When a Daoist practices the secret inscriptions, the mind, the spell, and the drawing must be united; and the drawing must be done on the surface of water, not on paper. One must respect the secret inscriptions; do not think the talisman to be merely a piece of paper. It is a token of command, a document of official rank. It contains secret inscriptions, the divine breath, a point of spiritual radiance, and true breath that endures to uphold. One must reverence the secret inscriptions, and not lightly despise them.
