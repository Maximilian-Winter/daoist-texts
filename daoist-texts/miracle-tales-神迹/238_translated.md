# A Youth's Attachment to Talismans and Charms Leads Him to be Summoned by the Netherworld

In the period of the Republic, when famine was widespread throughout the land, there was a youth surnamed Zeng, idle and short of means to procure food. He therefore went up the mountain to pay respects to a Daoist master, hoping thereby to secure a livelihood and learn from the old master certain talismans and incantations whereby he might make a living.

At first, the old master did not teach him much, which caused some impatience in his heart.

One day after midday meal, when he entered his master’s chamber to pay respects, he saw the table spread with yellow talismans stamped with the seal of the Three Treasures, bearing the words "to expel evil and guard the dwelling." He thought within himself: This must be my master's talisman to protect the house and ward off evil.

Having finished his salutation, and while his master was unmindful, he took some of the talismans by stealth.

Returning to his room, young Zeng took out the talismans and examined them carefully; he then traced their forms in the air with his hand, and finally practiced drawing them himself until the talismans he drew were exactly like those of his master.

One day, in order to test whether the talismans were efficacious, he took occasion, while going down the mountain to visit friends, to offer his services at a household troubled by ghosts, volunteering to expel the spirits.

Arriving at the house, young Zeng produced the master’s talisman, muttered a few incantations at random, burned the talisman and scattered its ashes in a bowl of water as a purification. From that time forward, the household was free from trouble.

The news of young Zeng’s ghost-banishing spread quickly; he frequently went down the mountain to draw talismans for the protection of dwellings, even privately carving the seal of the Three Treasures, stamping the talismans in imitation of his master, presenting himself as a Daoist of considerable experience.

Yet the good times were short-lived; when the talismans written by his master were used up, his tricks gradually lost their power.

He began to feel unwell but knew not the cause.

One night in his sleep, he dreamed that he came to a gloomy and fearful place. Looking up, he saw the King of Hell sitting in the hall, with ghostly captains, Ox-Head and Horse-Face, stationed on either side. He asked the King why he had been summoned to the netherworld.

The King of Hell laughed heartily and said: "For the sake of money, in this year of famine when people suffer grievously, you have dared to charge exorbitant fees to profit from their misfortune. Your greed exceeds your kindness. Moreover, you did not obtain your master’s permission to carve the seal, and you misused the incantations; how then can the ghosts fear you? You are idle, covetous, and lacking in virtue; even if you had truly received your master’s teachings, the talismans you draw would not be effective. Today we take you as a warning: if you continue to act recklessly, you will assuredly not escape punishment. Since you have already taken refuge in the Daoist path, you ought to cultivate virtue first; hasten back and repent your past."

Young Zeng awoke suddenly from the dream, drenched in sweat, gasping for breath.

At dawn the next day, dragging his weary body, he hastened up the mountain. Upon reaching the temple, he saw his master already waiting in the Hall of the Three Pure Ones.

When he appeared, the master said: "Kneel quickly and sincerely repent before the Patriarch, confessing all your crimes; otherwise you will not be spared. Should you offend again, I shall expel you from the order, severing the bond between master and disciple."

Young Zeng was struck with terror: "Master, how do you know of my affairs?"

The master replied: "Having entered the mysteries of the Dao, how can a master not be aware of his disciple’s conduct?"

With these words, the master commanded young Zeng to kneel before the incense for five hours to complete his penance.

Thereafter, young Zeng earnestly reformed, cultivating goodness with devotion, becoming a true cultivator of the Dao.

Whether the talismans and incantations of Daoism are efficacious depends not only on the transmission of the lineage and the master’s skill and Taoist cultivation, but more importantly on the master’s moral character.

Long engagement with ghosts and spirits necessarily brings harm; firstly, by accumulating too many grudges and thereby inviting retaliation from spirits; and frequent contact with ghosts also damages one’s own body. Secondly, if one’s own cultivation is insufficient, or if one resorts to deceit and falsehood in handling ghost matters, not only will one incur karmic retribution, but one is also liable to retaliation from spirits and ghosts, and so must proceed with great caution.

Once a Daoist brother who often helped others expel evil spirits was finally surrounded and attacked by fierce ghosts and died in a carriage accident; another Daoist, having learned only a little and not yet fully trained, went to a graveyard to perform rites for a benefactor, and afterward fell ill with a strange disease, lying at home for more than three months; yet another, before formally taking refuge and seeking a master, purchased talismanic implements such as a whisk and a peach-wood sword, then set up an altar and drew talismans to perform rites and consecrations for others, only to suffer repeated misfortunes. Such cases are manifold.

Those of high virtue are listened to respectfully by ghosts and spirits, who obey their commands; otherwise, the spirits whisper and mock their pretensions, thereby increasing the offenders’ sins.

Daoists perform rites chiefly to exhort and pacify, thereby dissolving resentment and malice, so that grudges may be let go. The saying "Enemies should be reconciled, not multiplied" expresses this principle. Of course, all things in the world follow cause and effect: if one does not summon misfortune, none will come; if one does not invite calamity, none will befall. Among all methods, cultivation of virtue is paramount. "When the Dao is exalted, dragons and tigers submit; when virtue is weighty, ghosts and spirits revere." Otherwise, to provoke the laughter of ghosts and spirits, and to bring calamity upon oneself, is most unworthy.
