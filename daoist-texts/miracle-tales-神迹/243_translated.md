# The Old Woman Who Spoke Evil and Became Blind in Her Later Years

There was an old woman surnamed Qi, whom all called Granny Qi. In her youth she was not blind; it was only in her old age that she lost her sight, and the manner of her blindness was very strange. One day in her later years, her eyes began to grow dim, and as the days passed the dimness increased until at last she could see nothing clearly, and both her eyes were utterly blind.

At that time her eldest son carried her about seeking doctors. The physicians were perplexed; there was no sign beforehand, no cause could be found, and no conclusion was given. They tried every prescription, visited every temple both great and small, but there was no cure or effect. In the end she passed away blind. When the villagers spoke of Granny Qi’s blindness, they cast blame upon her for having bullied her eldest daughter-in-law in her youth; they said all men meet with retribution, and behold, this was the end of one who oppressed an honest and meek daughter-in-law.

In her younger days, Granny Qi was a fierce character. Though she had four sons, who together owned a three-roomed house, she lived carefree and untroubled.

Her habitual saying was, “Sons and grandsons have their own fortunes; I will not be a beast of burden for them.” She lived a life envied by others, playing cards daily with great zeal; when she won she smiled cheerfully, and when she lost she railed fiercely, cursing as if at some enemy, though no one knew whom she scolded. She gave vent to her anger until it passed away.

Her eldest son was called Da Ming. At that time he had just returned from the army, and with some money earned there, he bought two donkeys and every day led them about pulling carts for others.

Her second son, Er Ming, learned a trade in a neighbouring village, living and eating at another’s home, seldom returning. The third and fourth sons worked away from home, returning only during the hottest days and the New Year.

The four sons jointly owned a tile-roofed house. Since Granny Qi’s husband had died early, it was difficult in the countryside to find wives, for the family was poor and Granny Qi’s reputation ill-favoured. The only commendation was that her four sons were diligent, hardworking, and not indolent like their mother.

Da Ming was nearly thirty, handsome and steady, but poverty barred him from finding a wife. Once, while pulling a cart in another town, he chanced to be noticed by a maiden six years his junior. She was fair and comely, kind and virtuous, but had eyes that were perhaps congenitally short-sighted; she had to look closely at everything. At that time spectacles were not common, and so she simply drew near to see; it did not much interfere with life, and her family did not mind, thus they made no provision for glasses.

Da Ming also liked the maiden, and as young hearts agreed, the matter was settled simply. The girl did not disdain Da Ming’s poverty, and the marriage was quietly arranged.

One would suppose Granny Qi ought to have been glad to have chosen such a virtuous daughter-in-law, and that the young couple would be fond of one another. Yet Granny Qi’s pleasure lasted scarcely three days. After that, she found fault with the daughter-in-law in every way, thinking her unworthy of her son, because she always had to look closely at things. The manner in which the daughter-in-law peered and looked was intolerable to Granny Qi, who began to call her a blind woman behind her back, then openly, and at last she called her “blind woman” to her face. “Blind woman, go tend the garden,” “Blind woman, go fetch firewood” …

The daughter-in-law disliked being so called. The nickname rang through the house and beyond, and the young people could not bear it. First Granny Qi called her blind, then the lecherous men of the village took it up, as if for sport.

Da Ming would not call her so; he knew she disliked it, and respected his wife. When she told him to ask his mother to stop the name-calling, for to expose others’ faults is to become such a person oneself, Da Ming replied with a curl of the lip, “She is an old woman; let her be. Do not mind old women.”

One month into the marriage, the daughter-in-law became pregnant. Her mother advised secrecy for the first three months, lest the child be endangered. The daughter-in-law heeded this, appearing as if not with child, attending to house and field work. Her mother also warned her to let Da Ming do the heavy work, to avoid harming the child.

Granny Qi did not know of the pregnancy, or perhaps she knew but feigned ignorance. At least Da Ming knew. Granny Qi thought her daughter-in-law lazy, saying Da Ming toiled all day pulling carts, his feet blistered and calloused, yet at home he was denied rest, still made to fetch water and firewood. She constantly grumbled that the daughter-in-law was unfeeling, caring only for herself, and to make matters worse, always added that, “No matter how precious she is, she is still blind.”

Such harsh words bring a chill even in June; each word was a wound to the daughter-in-law’s heart. The daughter-in-law was kind and never retorted, swallowing tears and grievances alike. She dared not tell Da Ming, fearing he might be troubled, and fearing that if he spoke to Granny Qi, she would grow more bitter and cruel towards her when he was absent. Thus she endured in silence.

One day, when the water jar was filled for dinner, Granny Qi returned from cards to see the daughter-in-law lying on the bed mending shoes. The way she peered closely at her work angered Granny Qi; she thought the daughter-in-law half disabled. Having lost at cards and with no outlet for her rage, she believed the daughter-in-law feigned laziness under the pretense of mending shoes, and ordered her to fetch water.

The daughter-in-law hesitated, wishing to say that Da Ming would fetch the water when he returned, but this unspoken hint enraged Granny Qi, who stood before the daughter-in-law’s room, scolding her with accusations of laziness and cruelty toward her husband.

The daughter-in-law, still young, could not bear the scolding, and with tears went to fetch water. Even when she filled the jar, Granny Qi’s anger was not appeased, and she commanded her to fill every basin and pot in the house.

The well was one or two li distant from Granny Qi’s home. The daughter-in-law, exhausted and panting, was pitied by others who urged her to rest, but none forbade her from carrying water. Her frail body could not bear Granny Qi’s harsh commands; the load was heavy, her body weary, and at last she collapsed, losing the child.

Da Ming, when he learned of this, grieved deeply and blamed Granny Qi for overworking his wife. Now the child was lost. Granny Qi, however, was disdainful, and venomously said, “Back when I bore you four, I did all manner of work; fetching water was light labour. People of delicate constitution are different—they even killed my grandchild.”

Only Da Ming knew the truth. Since he could remember, his mother had done nothing but play cards, day and night engrossed, impatient even when cooking meals. He himself, at six or seven years old, cooked for the whole family. His father was like a beast of burden, working from dawn to dusk, silently toiling for the family until he died in the fields.

Now with the miscarriage and her weakened body, the daughter-in-law could rise no more and had to lie in bed. Cooking became Granny Qi’s task. Used to having meals served to her, Granny Qi this time took charge of the kitchen. On the day after the miscarriage, the daughter-in-law’s mother arrived, angry and distressed, and before Da Ming insisted that his wife rest in bed for several days and not do heavy work for at least a month.

Perhaps Granny Qi sensed her fault and softened her manner; she entered the kitchen and even brought food to the daughter-in-law, who was somewhat surprised at this favour.

Yet a wolf is a wolf, even if disguised as a sheep; she was a wolf clad in sheep’s clothing. Knowing the daughter-in-law’s poor eyesight, she served only leftover and cold dishes, and when placing the food down, she angrily spat into the bowl, to express her resentment of the daughter-in-law’s mother’s orders. In Granny Qi’s eyes, the mother-in-law’s kindness was but a threat to consolidate her daughter’s place in the household.

Unbeknownst to her, this was seen by her card-playing friend Granny Chen, who found it incredible and thought it must be a mistake. She watched carefully, and at dinner, under the pretense of inviting Granny Qi to play cards, sought to uncover the truth, only to be left aghast.

Even if one does not love one’s daughter-in-law, or treat her kindly, one does not stoop to cruelly spitting into her bowl and playing such deliberate tricks.

Granny Chen wasted no time and spread the word in the village like a fairy scattering flowers, all without Granny Qi’s knowledge.

On the second day after the miscarriage, the daughter-in-law’s mother brought several pounds of meat, two chickens, and one hundred eggs to see her daughter. Da Ming asked Granny Qi to prepare the food for his wife to restore her health. Granny Qi cooked the meat, but only for the family to eat at dinner; the two chickens she said were taken by a weasel, which Da Ming doubted but grieved over. The villagers whispered that Granny Qi had secretly slaughtered the chickens for herself. As for the eggs, out of one hundred, ninety were given away—ostensibly as gifts from visitors to the daughter-in-law, but in truth to pay off debts from lost card games.

All this Da Ming did not know. His wife hid the troubles, enduring all so as not to bring him distress.

In the countryside, scandal spreads by word of mouth. These foul deeds of Granny Qi became well known, and those who disapproved discreetly cautioned her to treat her daughter-in-law better. But Granny Qi persisted in her ways. The meddlesome women, who feared no trouble, said if she would not listen, they would tell the daughter-in-law’s mother and let her come to set Granny Qi right.

By chance, when the daughter-in-law’s mother came again some ten days later, these busybodies gathered and poured out their grievances with no reserve.

The mother heard and was outraged. Seeing her daughter had lost much weight, she was deeply troubled. How could she let her cherished daughter endure such suffering? She confronted Granny Qi, who blushed and stammered excuses. The mother, convinced by Granny Qi’s manner, angrily took her daughter home. Da Ming was away then, and Granny Qi did not try to stop them, thinking it a relief not to have to manage young people, that they should care for themselves.

When Da Ming returned, Granny Qi added poison to the tale, telling him that the daughter-in-law’s mother had come to quarrel, to threaten, and forcibly take her daughter away, accusing Granny Qi of neglect. She insisted that the matter be not indulged, that at the slightest trouble the daughter-in-law would return home, and to ignore it, for how she went away so would she return.

Da Ming was displeased. Though he saw Granny Qi serve meat to his wife, he was vexed by her trouble-making. He meant to visit his wife, but anger and his mother’s instigations kept him away, and he blamed his wife for speaking falsely before his mother, acting overly sentimental.

Now matters were worse. Because of Granny Qi’s duplicity, the daughter-in-law’s mother, angered by taking her daughter home and seeing no one come to fetch her, forbade her daughter’s return.

One party threatened, “If you do not come to fetch her, she will not return to her husband.” The other replied, “If your people do not let her come home, I will not fetch her; let her stay with you as long as she likes. I will not have my son bow his head. If need be, he will remain single. Where will you go, blind and twice married?”

Da Ming, timid, though he longed for his wife, did not dare go to fetch her without his mother’s consent.

After a cold war of a year, and without a marriage certificate, the match was broken. Later the daughter-in-law married into a kind family she knew well, and Da Ming remained a bachelor, living with Granny Qi.

Later Er Ming, San Ming, and Si Ming married, but each wife was formidable, especially Er Ming’s, who often exchanged harsh words with Granny Qi. When she heard of Granny Qi’s treatment of the first daughter-in-law, she feared not Granny Qi, and boldly said, “So, you drove away the blind daughter-in-law, your son is single, and now you want to drive me away? Is your second son single?”

This silenced Granny Qi utterly. Encouraged, the second daughter-in-law’s influence grew, followed by the third and fourth wives. The sons dared not speak or defend their mother, knowing that though their wives were fierce, they cared for the family and worked hard, unlike their mother who was idle and indulgent.

Granny Qi, seeing that none of her daughters-in-law could be trifled with, sometimes spoke with villagers, lamenting the absence of the first daughter-in-law, saying only before her had she the unquestioned authority of a mother-in-law; these others were not tamed as the first had been. The villagers remained silent, thinking that had she treated the first daughter-in-law kindly, her eldest son would not have remained single.

Later, to find peace and avoid reproach, Granny Qi took her eldest son to live in the village commune. It was then heard that Granny Qi was bedridden and thereafter that she was blind, her blindness very strange indeed.

Men should not act in excess. As it is said, “Man acts and Heaven watches.” Do not twist the honest by your own spite, lest all evils return upon yourself.
