# The Verification of the Bell at Pengshan in Meizhou

In Meizhou of Sichuan there is an abandoned Daoist temple called the Temple of Pengshan in the City of Pengshan, within which there hangs an ancient bell weighing several thousand catties. The temple is situated more than twenty li from the city. Whenever the bell is struck, its deep and far-sounding tone can be heard reaching even the city walls. 

After a year or more, the monks of Meizhou grew covetous. They addressed memorials to the officials, falsely declaring that the Temple of Pengshan had no Daoists remaining, that it was overgrown with weeds, and that the copper bell ought to be removed. The official in charge at that time, lacking true knowledge and right discernment, rashly approved the matter.

The copper bell was brought to a monastery within the city. But as soon as it was suspended there, an accident befell, injuring the foot of a craftsman. That monastery faced directly towards the city gate; yet when the bell was struck, its sound could not even penetrate the city gate, let alone reach the outer city walls. The monks then understood that the bell was manifesting its spirit.

Therefore, they cast a new bell. Yet they did not return the old bell, but sold it to a monastery in Jiazhou.

When the old bell was taken down from the bell tower, another misfortune occurred: two artisans broke their feet and bent their waists. The bell was transported by water, and as it was loaded onto the boat and set out from shore, people were again injured. Alas, the ignorant vulgar folk were numb and insensible, and failed to perceive that it was the old bell displaying its spirit.

From that time onward, the copper bell of the Temple of Pengshan was scattered abroad, and to this day it has not been returned; it is indeed a matter to be lamented and mourned.
