# The Verification of Spirit Incantations and Fasting by Wang Zhaoshang of Suzhou

Wang Zhaoshang, an officer of the Wang family in the Iron Courtyard of Suzhou, was a man exceedingly wealthy. The treasures and goods of his household were piled up like mountains; he lacked no food or drink, yet he suffered deeply from disease lingering in his body for many years. He had once established fasting offerings to the spirit images, widely employing the talismans and incantations of sorcerers and physicians—he had tried them all—but could not cure his sickness.

The Taoist Chen Daoming of the Jade Zhi Temple was a man devoted and diligent in the cultivation of the Taoist arts, and when he held Taoist assemblies, there were often divine efficacies. Yet Wang Zhaoshang had never believed in the Tao; when hearing others discourse on the mysterious and the Way, he was wont to look down upon them with disdain. Thinking that he had expended tens of thousands of treasures and goods in healing himself, yet his body daily decayed, awaiting death only, his kinsfolk and friends advised him to invite Taoist Chen Daoming to set up an altar and conduct the great ritual. Wang Zhaoshang, having no alternative, sent for Chen Daoming.

Master Daoming set up the altar and arranged the array in his house, preparing to perform the spirit incantations to dispel calamity. Because Wang Zhaoshang’s illness became ever more grievous and life was at the verge of extinction, his family urged the Master to begin the ritual without delay. Just as the assembly commenced, Wang Zhaoshang suddenly closed his eyes; his family were greatly alarmed, supposing that he could not be saved. After Master Chen performed the Taoist rites, holding the ritual sword in hand and lifting the ritual water, he passed through every chamber of the house, sprinkling water with his mouth, to dispel the noxious disease.

Wang Zhaoshang then spoke: ‘Master, pray sprinkle some water here as well.’ Master Daoming also sprinkled water in his bedchamber. Suddenly Wang Zhaoshang sat up by himself, bowing his head to the ground and saying: ‘I am exceedingly grateful for your divine skill; my illness now has hope for cure.’ Rising, he sat upright with joy, saying: ‘I have all my life devoted my mind amiss, not knowing of the Great Way. Today I have witnessed the might of the Heavenly Soldiers.’

He slowly spoke with his wife and family: ‘At first my body was no longer under my control, trapped in darkness, thinking that today I was to die. Even when Master Chen opened the ritual, I did not awaken. I only heard a voice in the air saying, “The Great Emperor descends, leading the Heavenly Soldiers to punish the rebels.” Then shone a yellow radiance like the sun, instantaneously illuminating all the space. I beheld a multitude of thousands upon thousands of mounted Heavenly Soldiers and generals surrounding this house; many ghosts and evil spirits were all seized and bound. Then the Great Emperor and the Supreme One God came riding in a chariot of seven treasures, like worldly emperors, attended by guards, making their inspection. At that time I was summoned before the Supreme One God; the deity commanded water to be sprinkled upon my face, and a coolness penetrated my heart. I instantly felt no pain in my body, though my strength was yet somewhat weak.

At that moment I heard that the Primordial Heavenly Worthy was about to descend to the human world; hastening forward, I bowed before him, and saw his retinue increase a hundredfold beyond before. Then the Primordial Heavenly Worthy emitted a beam of light upon me, and my strength increased greatly.’

Wang Zhaoshang informed his kinsfolk: ‘Hasten to prepare my washing utensils, that I may cleanse myself and go to the altar to bow.’ His friends and family feared that he had newly recovered from grave illness and that his body could not endure it; they advised him to wait until some days had passed, to restore his health before bowing. But Wang Zhaoshang did not heed them; he insisted upon washing and changing his garments. At first he leaned upon a crutch, standing long; then he cast away the crutch, and went straight to the altar, swiftly and earnestly bowing. When his family came to support him, he pushed them away. Afterwards he sat apart to watch the ritual, appearing as though he had never been ill; eating and living as before the sickness. Thus, during the three days of the Taoist assembly, he devoutly offered incense and bowed, requiring no aid from others.

Thereafter, he expended funds to repair the Jade Zhi Temple, the lecture hall, the great hall, the gate towers and covered corridors, the dining hall and alchemical chambers, even the moat before the temple and the street, extending over some forty paces or more (one pace being five feet). Whether trees or earth, spirit images, houses, beds, pillows, vessels, clothing, or storehouses, whatever could be procured with money was all completed within two years. From that time onward, his spirit was clear and vigorous, his mind bright and quick; he then resigned from office, cultivated the Tao, and attained contentment.
