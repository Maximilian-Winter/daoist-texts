# Paper Money May Not Be Burned for the Most High and Lofty Perfected Ones

The burning of paper money is an important method among our people for praying for blessings and communicating with ghosts and spirits. Whenever the Three Originals or the Five Year-ends come, in the worship of ancestors and deities, paper money is burned. But do you know that paper money may not be burned for the Most High and Lofty Perfected Ones?

The *Jade Code of the Heavenly Altar* says: "At the great offerings, before the Celestial True Ones of the sun, moon, stars, and heaven, paper money must not be burned, lest one offend the Perfected Ones above. Only the ghosts and spirits of the middle and lower realms, and the ancestral and local earth spirits, may be offered paper money. In ancient times there was no such custom; it was only from the Han Celestial Masters that the method of incantations to transform (paper money) was introduced, as set forth in the Dongshen Register." Do you see? Only the ghosts and spirits of the middle and lower realms, and ancestors and land, use paper money. If it be the Most High and Lofty Perfected Ones—such as the Three Purities, the Four Sovereigns, the Thunder Voice Universal Illumination Heavenly Lord, the Four Great Celestial Masters, and other exalted Perfected Ones of the upper realms—paper money is not used. Not only does it not bring blessings, it even incurs sin.

The *Crane Forest Dharma Sayings* states: "In all instances of setting up offerings, paper money must not be presented to the Perfected Ones above; this is a great profanation. In ancient times, although there were underworld utensils, there were no paper monies. It was only by the end of the Han that paper money came into use, to offer to ghosts and spirits of the middle and lower realms, and this is permissible. To offer it to the Celestial True Ones, is it fitting? The greedy and covetous of this world, even though they undergo the Taiyin regimen, still retain a single thought (of desire). As the *Ten Thousand Lights Repentance* says, what is lacking and deficient are worldly treasures and riches; therefore the transformation of paper money aims to break their desires!" Patriarch Bai Yuchan, in the *Crane Forest Dharma Sayings*, warns his disciples not to use paper money to offer to the Lofty Perfected Ones.

Because paper money belongs to underworld utensils, it is burned for the departed ghosts. The gods of the lower realms and the Earth Lords may be given paper money. But the Most High and Lofty Perfected Ones dwell in the realm of pure Yang, and do not require such things. In antiquity there were underworld utensils, but no paper money. Only by the end of the Han dynasty did paper money appear.

According to the *Wanli Miscellaneous Records*, "For example, during the reign of Emperor Shizong of the Zhou, paper made of bark was fashioned into gold and silver ingots; the yellow ones were called 'Treasure of the Spring Altar above,' the white ones 'Second-rate Treasure of the Underworld Journey,' which was already laughable. By the time of Emperor Gaozong of Song, when the imperial coffin was taken to the Daoist temple, the officials' offerings of paper money were many and trifling; Emperor Xiaozong was displeased, and remonstrants said, 'Paper money is a device used by the Buddhists to exceed their relatives in the netherworld; it is not suitable for a sage ruler.' Xiaozong said, 'What sort of man was Shao Yaofu? He always used paper money to sacrifice to his ancestors. Is it possible for a living man in the world, such as you, to go a single day without using money?' Thus this too became a handed-down custom." In the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period, Emperor Shizong already used paper money; during the Song dynasty emperors also used paper money to sacrifice to their ancestors. According to Emperor Xiaozong of Song, Shao Kangjie also did so.

According to Patriarch Bai Yuchan, the people of the Han dynasty used paper money to sacrifice to ancestors to break the covetousness of the departed souls. Why?

Because although the departed souls are dead, their attachments remain. Most men in the world lack money (this is the truth). Because of this attachment, they cannot be reborn. How then can such attachments be broken? The best method is to give them much money (how reasonable! possessing it removes attachment; the best method to make the poor not covet wealth is to give them inexhaustible money). Therefore, during the ritual refinement, burning paper money is actually to break the covetousness of the departed. It is not necessarily that the departed need these things.

Hence it is easy to understand why burning paper money for the Most High and Lofty Perfected Ones is a transgression.

For the implicit meaning is "You still have covetousness," and this is improper. The Most High and Lofty Perfected Ones are complete and perfect, and do not need these things. Yet sometimes, when conducting a Daoist altar, some paper money is still burned; these paper monies are for the guardian deities, not for the Most High and Lofty Perfected Ones.

Lin Boqian said: "What is the proper ritual for offerings?" The answer was: "In ancient times, the path of communication first required sincerity and reverence; later, when sincerity and reverence were insufficient, one prepared objects as ritual. If sincerity were present, and objects were prepared, that might be acceptable. But if the objects are not prepared, this is the greatest profanation. The Scripture says: 'Water and flowers may be offered; why seek anything else?' The Scripture also says: 'Embody the dignity of the world.' Therefore, all offerings nowadays, if they are without shame, suffice. Otherwise, all are liable to profanation; should we not beware?" What then is good for offerings to the spirits? The *Northern Dipper Scripture* says: "According to the dignity of the world," with sincerity and reverence foremost. Build merit according to your own ability. Incense, flowers, lamps, fruits, tea, water, jewels, and vestments—these are the ten offerings. The Scripture says: "Incense, lamps, tea, and wine are offered to the great and lofty immortals. The good believers now offer incense, lamps, tea, and wine, wishing to seek blessings and long life without boundary." Generally, the high Perfected Ones are offered according to the rites of the world, but abstaining from meat and fish.

The Scripture says: "Daoist incense, virtue incense, effortless incense; effortless, pure, and natural incense." A heart pure, compassionate, sincere, and reverent is the best offering. Some people, due to economic conditions, cannot afford much, but as long as they have a pure and compassionate heart, sincerely revering the spirits, they too may receive blessings.
