# The Illness of the Layman Chen of Shanghai

The Analects record: The Master was ill, and Zilu requested to pray. The Master said, ‘Is there such a thing?’ Zilu replied, ‘There is. The ancient text says, “Pray to the gods above and below.”’ The Master said, ‘I have long been praying.’

Thus it is told that Confucius fell ill, and Zilu sought to offer prayer. Confucius said, ‘Is there really such a practice?’ Zilu answered, ‘The ancient writings say one should pray to the gods above and below.’ Confucius said, ‘I too have long prayed.’ This shows that among our people it is customary, whenever illness comes, to have recourse to ghosts and spirits.

It is told of a layman named Chen in Shanghai, who some years ago was beset with lingering disease. He consulted both Chinese and Western physicians, but to no avail. His heart was heavy with sorrow, his feelings oppressed, even verging on melancholia.

Later, the doctor felt his pulse, and discovered it to be “sometimes large, sometimes small; sometimes long, sometimes short,” much resembling the "ghost pulse" recorded in ancient books. Moreover, during this year’s Qingming festival, due to the epidemic, he was unable to visit the ancestral graves to perform rites. At night he often dreamed of his deceased parents seeking him; his soul and dreams were confused, greatly disturbing his work and life. Thus he sought out on the internet a “master,” to ask for help. The “master” received from him eight thousand eight hundred yuan, and performed rituals in an apartment all day. Yet the effect remained poor.

By chance, the doctor was also a man who loved Daoist culture. Seeing the state of matters, he could endure it no longer, and so introduced him to a small temple. When I heard his story, I understood his anxious heart. Yet fearing his expectations might be too great, and that should there be no effect, what then? After all, matters of ghosts and spirits are subtle beyond subtle, not within our control. Therefore I told him, ‘We only undertake to act according to the canonical prescriptions and transmissions; whether it shall have effect we do not undertake to guarantee.’ He expressed understanding.

By chance, the next day there was a rite for the deliverance of the dead; so I wrote him a petition to be used at the rite. With the clanging of bells and gongs, the ceremony proceeded as appointed. Having just completed the initial prayers and preparing to recite the Sutra of Deliverance, the layman Chen sent me a message by WeChat, saying, ‘Thanks, Master; I feel my body is already healed.’ The next day he returned for consultation; after the doctor examined him, he sent me word, saying, ‘Your method is remarkable; today, upon feeling his ghost pulse, it is already two-thirds restored.’

The famous physician Zheng Qinan says in his True Transmission of Medical Principles: ‘Among all households, the most unavoidable are disease and illness. If the affliction be light, medicine may cure it. But if it be heavy, and for three years or two, medicine avails nothing, such disease is either due to entanglements of sins and grievances from a former life, or arises from failure in this life to restrain oneself, accumulating faults and offences. For those who are fathers, sons, younger brothers, elder brothers, or husbands, it is urgent to turn back and cultivate virtue, to perform many good deeds. Perhaps for life one abstains from eating ox and dog; or the whole family keeps a fast in reverence to the Nine Emperors; or buys fish and releases them alive; or bestows coffins and builds roads, doing what is convenient at the time; thus accruing abundant merit in the unseen world. With fasting and sincerity cleansing the heart, reverently preparing repentance and prayer for grace, writing petitions to relieve calamities and dispel disaster, first addressed to the central palace, next to the city god, next to the Eastern Peak, and burning them in the air, danger may be turned into safety. I have often taught men by this method, and it has frequently been verified; it may also supplement the deficiencies of medicine.’
