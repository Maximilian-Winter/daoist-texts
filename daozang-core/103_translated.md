# The Precious Edict of Commander Yin

With devoted heart I bow and surrender myself. He who dwells reverently at the Dipper's mouth, charged with dispelling evil. He is the True Official of the Heavenly Cycle of Sixty Jiazi, and the Sovereign Lord of the Earthly Twelve-Year Spirits. With raging malignant qi ascending on high to the five clouds; with august and awe-inspiring dignity pervading the Three Realms. When the golden bells ring, all the goblins and spectres flee into hiding; when the precious halberd whirls, pestilence, plague, and pestilential diseases all vanish afar. He commands the various departments of prohibition and taboo, spirits and malign influences, his might subduing Heaven and Earth; exercising the supreme divine powers of the Dharma Body, his merit pervades the universe. He surveys the reverence of myriad lands, comprehends the balance of the Five Virtues. What disaster is not extinguished? What calamity is not removed? Most heroic and fierce, supremely august and efficacious. The Earthly Office for Dispelling Evil, Chief of Thunder and Execution, Commander-in-Chief, the Great Heavenly Lord Yin.
