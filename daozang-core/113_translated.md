# Precious Declaration of the Venerable Lord Wen

With devoted heart I bow and submit myself in reverence. He is the Commander above in the Heavenly Court, the righteous deity in the Earthly Tribunal. In the mysterious Way he is united with men; in the village of Banzhu he bestows beneficence. His virtue is exalted, renouncing self; within the Golden Palace he grants a gracious tide of favour. Wearing a crown of jade blossoms, he passes through the Gate of Heaven; holding in his hand a ringed mace, the vast firmament knows no restraint. He presides over the nine underworlds, swiftly summoning the records of men; he bears the place of chief general among the divine hosts of the Five Sacred Mountains. His pure breath shines bright, his awe-inspiring spirit is illustrious. Great is his heroism, great his splendour; great his virtue, great his benevolence. Before the Hall of the Jade Emperor stands the Golden Kang to the left; he supports the spirits, declares valour, the warm and commanding General of the Capital.
