# Treasure Ordinance of Marshal Yue

With devoted heart I humbly offer reverence and submission. Three peaks stand upright and towering; in hand he holds the spirit-spear of dripping springs; five ranks level with the eyebrows, his body clad in silver armour like falling snow. Before the throne he is the marshal, within the palace the general. Above him rules the mighty host of heavenly warriors and divine generals of the nine heavens; beneath his command are the five prisons, and the guilty ghosts and lost spirits. In the three realms, all who make petition receive manifest response; the commands throughout the myriad regions are all executed. Loyalty shines like the sun, the rule of ministers for ten thousand generations; filial conduct is like the wind, the teaching for children through the ages. He displays his divine power in the city of Jinling, enduring through a thousand autumns without alteration; he inscribes his merit at Zhuxian Town, lasting through a hundred generations. At his seat are thirty-two generals who break bandits and remove traitors; with five hundred young men following him, they seize demons and catch monsters. All living beings bear virtue, and the myriad families revere and honour him. Most firm and most brave, most filial and most benevolent, the ancestral master of a well-governed age, the supreme general who subdues demons. The loyal and valiant King Wu Mu, great and courageous chief inspector. He rescues the people with uprightness and is honoured as Junior Protector; he guards the nation without selfishness and is called the King of E. Of great compassion and great vow, of great saint and great mercy, before the Jade Emperor's hall, concurrently managing the Right Minister Dao De Yuan Jun, the Boundless Universal Aid and Wonderful Dharma Great Celestial Venerable.
