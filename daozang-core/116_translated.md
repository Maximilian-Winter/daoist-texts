# The Precious Decree of Marshal Kang

With devoted heart I bow and submit my life in reverence.  
The Heavenly Venerable under the True Martial Emperor Lord,  
Marshal Kang the Great.  
His face is red, his lips vermilion; his brows divided into eight colours.  
His majestic bearing is earnest and solemn; five dragons adorn his long beard.  
Valiant and vigorous beyond the common,  
his divine radiance and noble spirit shine forth.  
He roams and patrols through Heaven and Earth,  
his hand grasping the golden mace.  
He searches and seizes evil vapours,  
governs demons and captures monsters.  
He watches over human relations,  
protects and aids the virtuous.  
By law he aids the Emperor Lord, upright and without partiality.  
He only protects the gate of goodness,  
great in compassion and great in vow,  
great sage and great mercy.  
The Northern Pole Mysterious Heaven Supreme Emperor,  
Marshal Kang of the Left Division,  
the illustrious Heavenly Venerable.
