# Sacred Edict of the Holy Mother of Vision and Light

With reverent heart I bow and take refuge, paying homage. In the Great Luo Heaven above, there dwells the Primordial Heavenly Goddess. Her wondrous form is majestic, her golden body full of marvel. She ascends amid clouds and rosy mists, the auspicious clouds rising gently. Her radiant countenance shines like the full moon, the immortal appearance serene and pure. In tranquil emptiness she manifests among men. Her virtue balances Yin and Yang, her blessings nurture Heaven, Earth, and the Three Realms. She is the pivot of myriad spirits of the human world, opening the divine brilliance of earthly prosperity. In the clear and tranquil universe, she descends to bestow blessings and dispel calamities. The Three Realms acclaim her praise, free from greed and partiality. She rescues the suffering and those in peril, universally aiding and ferrying across. Great compassion and great vow, great saint and great mercy, she abides in the Eastern Peak Heavenly Palace, the Radiant Sovereign of the Two Poles.
