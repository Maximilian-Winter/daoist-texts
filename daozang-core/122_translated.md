# The Precious Announcement of the Four Attendant Officers

With devoted heart I bow and submit my homage. They are the transmitters of the written commands, the interpreters of the mandates, the presenters of affairs to the heroes. In the Three Realms they manifest virtue; in the Four Palaces they supervise功. Clad in golden helmets and silver armour, in their hands they bear white swords with azure blades. Mounted on steeds, at times descending to the Netherworld; treading on clouds and stepping through mist, at times ascending to the Celestial Court. When rites of offering and periods of fasting are instituted, in all places they rely on their steeds to observe and examine. Recording merits and noting faults, in every case they depend on the spirits to communicate and make clear. Throughout the twelve months of the year, month by month they labour their spirits; through the twelve hours of the day, hour by hour they diligently perform功. They send down new scriptures and restrain the degenerate customs; they face the mortal world to rescue it from the declining winds. They repel evil and uphold what is right; they bring fortune and transform calamity. Great is their compassion, great their vow; great their spirit, great their response. These are the Four Attendant Officers, the messengers who transmit the written commands.
