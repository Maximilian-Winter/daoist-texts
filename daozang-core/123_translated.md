# The Sacred Edict of the Dragon King

With devoted heart I bow and submit myself in reverence.  
The sea irrigates the palace, the jade isles adjoin blessings.  
Descendants of the Heavenly Stream, the august and boundless decree,  
Charged with the three heavens, issuing commands to govern the myriad spirits;  
Their mind united with the Heavenly Mother, compassion and benevolence embracing all creatures.  
The waves are tranquil and calm, forbidding overflow into rivers and streams;  
The scaly and shelled dwellers sink deep, not allowing the surge to rage and bring destruction.  
Vastly they receive the carriage of the Southern Guide, profoundly they bestow the marsh of righteous peace.  
Their divine power is universal, their mighty virtue far-spreading.  
Great compassion and great vows, great sages and great mercy.  
All the heroes of the nine seas, noble scions and divine kings,  
The Heaven-honoured, who achieve thorough and unobstructed passage.
