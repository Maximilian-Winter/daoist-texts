# Precious Decree of the Immortal Master Yue Lao

With devoted heart I turn in reverence and homage. Beneath the full moon reunited, under the tree of longing, the contract is made within the hall of betrothal. He who holds the marriage registers throughout all under Heaven, and binds the ties of union over a thousand li. With compassionate brow and kindly glance, lovers at last become attached companions. With a single pull of the red thread, they cannot escape the predestined bond of three lifetimes. Leaning on his staff and bearing his cloth pouch, he journeys amid the mists and clouds and rosy clouds. His face like a child’s, his hair like the crane’s, he transcends love and hatred, affection and enmity. Great saint, great mercy; great benevolence, great vow. He draws the bonds and leads the threads—the elder beneath the moon. He unites marriages and joins unions, the honoured spirit of true destiny.
