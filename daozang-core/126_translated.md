# Precious Admonition of the Two Immortals of Harmony and Union

With devoted heart I take refuge and pay reverent homage. On clouded steps in the Pearly Garden, stands the Palace of the Immortals of Harmony and Union. Free and easy, joyous and tranquil, with the pure heart of a child of the holy Way. They laugh and sport amidst the scattering affairs of the world, holding in their hands a lotus casket to aid reunion. Their divine powers are vast and extend through the Three Worlds; they harmonize all matters throughout the ten directions. Their precious names are proclaimed, that men and women in wedlock may be all fulfilled and happy. The Mysterious Altar is raised and built, seeking gain and success that may please the heart. Bowing with head to the ground and worshipping, those parted and divided in hairpins are able to reunite their ornaments. Burning incense in offering, the broken mirror, though scattered, may be made whole again. When the household is harmonious, all affairs prosper; when men are in concord, all things go smoothly. Great compassion, great vows; great saint, great mercy. Embracing the Way and cherishing virtue, the Heavenly Venerated One harmonizes all matters.
