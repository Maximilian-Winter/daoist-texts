# Precious Edict of the Righteous Deity of Blessings and Virtue

With devoted heart I bow and submit myself in reverence.  
In every region of soil and grain, the deity of blessings for ten thousand families.  
He holds fast to loyalty, righteousness, and ardour, aiding the state and guarding the people.  
Receiving the simple mandate, he rules one district and the multitude look up to him in awe.  
He directs the office of merits, in charge of transmissions, his earnest zeal reaching on high.  
His justice pervades the nine heavens; good and evil shine forth clearly and respond accordingly.  
His spirit communicates through the three realms; merits and faults are examined and distinguished with clarity.  
He fortifies the golden rampart, establishes tranquillity for altar and land.  
Great loyalty and great filial piety, most illustrious and most efficacious.  
He protects the state and blesses the people, with great joy and great liberality.  
The Righteous Deity of Blessings and Virtue, exalted by the Most High in conferment.  
The honoured deity of soil and grain, enjoined by the Jade Emperor to be worshipped.  
He presides over the altar and guards the palace; the bright sovereign of the land, the Righteous Deity of Blessings and Virtue.
