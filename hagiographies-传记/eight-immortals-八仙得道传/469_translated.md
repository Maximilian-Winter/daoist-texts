# Chapter the First: The Immortal of the Dragon Elixir Aids a Filial Son; A Covetous Official Seeks the Spirit Pearl

The Master, hearing this, remarked, "The immortals were originally men; only it is feared that men's hearts are not steadfast." Hence it appears that the paths of the immortal and the mortal come from one source. Since there are mortals, how can it be that none have attained to immortality? The Master was incredulous, and bade the author produce some proof for all to consider and study. From ancient times there have been many immortals, but among them the most generally known and admired by the world are none other than the Eight Immortals of the Eight Caverns. To-day they are commonly called the Eight Immortals.

The author, loving the Way from youth, has read many secret books of the Heavenly Court seldom seen in the world, and many nameless tales from the sea-shore. In his bosom he truly treasures many stories of immortals. Yet, being unskilled in human affairs, when he speaks of them, it may not necessarily move men's faith. Therefore he will select to relate the origins and deeds of the Eight Immortals, with various true occurrences and manifest signs. Such stories are familiar to women and children, and some ancient monuments may be relied upon.

It is clear the author is not telling mere falsehoods to deceive the people!

To speak of the cultivation and attainment of the Eight Immortals: when it began, through what ages it has passed, with what circumstances, it is like a book of the Twenty-Four Histories, and it is hard to know where to begin. The author laboured earnestly to find a small thread of clue. Have you ever heard, gentlemen, of the ancient and modern legend of the Two Dragons controlling the waters? This matter seems plain and unremarkable; yet, upon careful examination by the author, it has a slight connection with the history of the Eight Immortals. Following the rule of proceeding step by step, to speak of the affairs of the Eight Immortals, one must needs invoke these two Dragon Lords as a beginning and introduction.

These two dragons dwell, one in the west of Heaven, the other in the south of the sea. In the ancient times, the western region of the southern Jambudvipa was a great marshy land. This region was called Guan Kou, and was the domain bestowed upon Erlang Shen, nephew of the Jade Emperor, whence he is called Erlang of Guan Kou. Even now in Sichuan there is a county named Guan, derived from this source. At that time Erlang Shen guarded the region of Guan Kou, and often manifested his spirit and wonders. The nearby inhabitants of land and water all devoutly worshipped him, and incense burned abundantly in his shrines. Yet in those waters dwelt an old dragon, who, fearing Erlang’s power, dared not show himself the whole year round, but remained hidden in the sea, cultivating himself. Having attained a thousand years of life, he had become an imperishable being. Erlang Shen’s divine powers were vast; with but his keen eyes he could perceive all undersea and surface affairs, nothing escaped his notice. The dragon, having laboured long, dared not come forth to harm men, nor would he contend with Erlang; therefore he feigned indifference and neglected him.

One day, it happened that on the shore there was a filial son, surnamed Ping, given name He. From childhood he had lost his father, and was reared by a widowed mother, Lady Wang, who kept her chastity and nurtured the orphan, so that he grew a strong and brave youth. But Lady Wang had worn herself out with work, and had lost her sight. Ping He tried every means, praying to gods and Buddhas to cure his mother’s eyes, but all to no avail. At last in great anger he exclaimed, "My mother is such a good woman, why must she suffer this cruel fate? It shows that Heaven’s way is unreliable! The gods and Buddhas are without power!" Thus was a once good son stirred to a temper of resentment and impatience. Yet the disease was hard to cure, and his vexation availed nothing. Ping He, though troubled, had no other recourse but to toil diligently, earn money, and care for his loving mother. Though blind, Lady Wang was comforted in heart by her son’s filial affection. Often she heard her son complain of Heaven and men, and earnestly admonished him. Ping He accordingly restrained himself, and every day, except for work and caring for his mother, he dared not stray or speak more. Lady Wang was pleased, and said to Ping He, "My son, though blind, with a son like you, I need not go out to earn money; without sight I am not harmed." Ping He replied, "Mother, say not so. Filial duty to parents is a matter of course. You have been loyal and chaste all your life, yet suffer this ailment which is not deserved! If I could ascend to Heaven and delve into earth, I would find out the cause and procure some immortal medicine to cure your eyes, and then I would rest content!" Lady Wang took it as a child’s idle talk and smiled. But Ping He, working hard by day, still sought everywhere for a cure to blindness.

One day, having run out of firewood at home, he went early into the mountain, cut some dry branches, and slowly returned down the hill. Midway he saw a Daoist, whose countenance was strange and pure, his bearing ethereal, and about him was a radiance of auspicious light. Ping He, suspecting the man was no common person, hastily laid down his load and saluted, and asked, "Whence comes the Immortal?" The man smiled and said, "I am no immortal; I can but cure diseases, and reckon myself a wandering doctor." Hearing this, Ping He was moved, and asked, "Can the immortal doctor cure blindness of many years’ standing?" The man replied, "All diseases I cure, but not blindness." Ping He spat and took up his firewood to leave.

The Daoist laughed, "You child, why so impatient?" Ping He said, "My mother is all I have; her body is well but her eyes are blind. You say you cure all diseases but not blindness: it seems as if you mean to oppose me; why should I speak with you?" The Daoist laughed again, "Though I do not cure blindness, I know of a certain master who does. If I do not tell you, where else will you seek him?"

Hearing of such a doctor, Ping He laid down his firewood again and bowed, saying, "I have been out long, fearing my mother’s longing; I spoke hastily, forgive me, Daoist. You who have taken vows of mercy, since there is such a doctor, I beg you tell me, that I may go to him. If my mother be healed, it will be your merit and mine both." The Daoist nodded and smiled, "You are a poor man, always toiling to support your mother, and cannot afford much; why speak of thanks? But it is true that the vow of mercy is real. Well then! We meet here by some fate. Your filial piety I respect, and will point out your destination. Thirty-five li from this mountain, in a great river, dwells a wicked dragon, long cultivating. At the hours of noon and midnight, he certainly raises his head above the water and absorbs the essence of sun and moon, and from his mouth he spits forth a red pearl. This pearl shines upon the water, sparkling and bright; it is a refined elixir. You may go and wait by the water; when he spits the pearl, recite the charm 'An li hong li hong', and beckon with your hand. The pearl will fly into your hand. Quickly conceal it and carry it home, and hang it before your room. Whatever you desire, speak silently to the pearl, and it will answer your wishes. As for your mother’s eyes, but a touch of the pearl’s light will restore her sight, and she shall never lose it again." Knowing this man must be an immortal, Ping He bowed to the ground. The Daoist helped him up, saying, "No courtesy; remember the charm, and you shall succeed. The old dragon will try to seize the pearl when he sees you holding it; I will be secretly helping you, so fear not. Go boldly!"

Having spoken, a wind arose, and the Daoist vanished in a golden light. Ping He was greatly astonished, and bowed in thanks to the empty air. Bearing his firewood home, fearing to alarm his timid mother, he said nothing. When the night had deepened to the third watch, he went alone out the back door and swiftly hastened to the place the Daoist had told him of. Finding a cluster of reeds, he crouched there, holding his breath, and stared at the water until the hour of midnight. Suddenly a red light arose from the water’s bottom, passing through to the surface, frightening the fishes and shrimps, which fled in confusion. The red light rose above the water more than ten feet, rising and falling, advancing and retreating beneath the moonlight. About it was a mist, white as silver and pale as smoke. Ping He had no leisure to look for the dragon’s body below the water; seeing the red pearl, he was so delighted he nearly leapt up. He quickly calmed himself and recited "An li hong li hong," stretching out his hand and beckoning the pearl. In an instant, the red light flew straight toward his eyes, so dazzling he could scarcely keep them open. Regardless of life or death, he stretched out both hands to grasp the light and seize the pearl. As the light diminished and grew faint, he felt something in his hand; looking closely, it was indeed the sparkling, radiant red pearl. His joy was beyond measure. As he rose to leave, a fierce wind suddenly swept through the reeds.

In a moment, the sky darkened and the earth grew dim; the moonlight vanished, and thunder roared about his head like the voice of heaven. Afraid, Ping He clasped the pearl and bowed his head, crying, "Immortal, save me! Immortal, save me!" Suddenly a voice was heard from on high, "Wicked dragon, be not rude! Hear my command: I am the Transcendent of the Ninth Heaven, you have cultivated many years but achieved no true fruit. Yet, remembering Ping He’s filial heart that moves Heaven, I borrow your elixir to save his mother and establish merit to help all the world. After you lose the pearl, your body shall be insecure, but your soul may remain here; do not leave this place. In three years you will meet disaster. Then your soul shall enter his body, and you two shall be as one, achieving great merit. Ping He and you shall each find your place; this is a double gain. Do not be foes at this time!" Having spoken, the wind ceased and the thunder was still. The bright moon hung in the sky, shining on the vast smoky waves. Where the pearl had appeared, the water showed the head of an old dragon, nodding thrice to the sky, then diving out of sight, without a sound or trace. Ping He, hastily and reverently, bowed several times, rose from the reeds, and took the pearl home.

At dawn, the red sun rising, his mother was groping on the bed to dress. Fearful to startle her, Ping He entered as usual and softly called to her. She suddenly opened her eyes and said, "Child, what is that you hold? So red and bright; truly a fine sight." Seeing his mother could now see, Ping He was overjoyed, but told her not the cause. He first showed her the pearl, and she sprang up, exclaiming, "My son, whence came you this treasure? I see it, and my eyes are bright, even clearer than in youth!" She reached for the pearl, but Ping He said, "Mother, be patient; this treasure must not be handled thus. I will find a way to hang it up, so you may look upon it always; I promise your eyes shall remain clear and never suffer again." She followed him to the hall, where he tied the pearl with a string and hung it in the centre, and a red glow illuminated the room. From that time on, not only did Lady Wang’s blindness vanish, but both mother and son felt vigorous and happy. Moreover, the pearl was truly a gem of fulfilment; whatever was needed, a silent prayer to it would bring it forth into the house, an inexhaustible treasure. With so powerful a support, the mother and son had no cause for fear in food or clothing. Yet Ping He was peculiar; though he had the treasure, he would not idle a day, but laboured as before, never resting through wind, rain, cold, or heat.

One day Lady Wang said, "Son, now we are blessed by Heaven, with food and clothing sufficient. Your years are not few; you should seek a worthy and comely maiden, and early settle marriage, that I may have one great wish fulfilled." Ping He answered, "Mother’s kind command, I will obey. Yet since the immortal gave me the pearl and cured your blindness, I vowed to perform five hundred merits before thinking of marriage. Now more than a month has passed, and though I have gone about seeking, no opportunity has come for me to show my skill. What then?" Lady Wang was suddenly awakened, saying, "Son, that is not hard. The treasures of the immortals are for the benefit of the world. Since you have it, you should share it with others, that not only you but the immortal and old dragon may gain merit." Before she finished, Ping He leapt for joy, "Mother’s wisdom is clear; how came I not to think of this! I will become a wandering doctor; for those with incurable diseases, I will shine the red pearl, curing all ailments and prolonging life; and for poor families, I will silently pray to the pearl to send silver and rice. In less than a year, I may have done thousands of good deeds." Lady Wang said, "Good! You must not be negligent. Since you have thought of it, begin at once and see if it will work." Ping He laughed, "The treasure is not mine to command; if it cured my mother, it can cure others. It may care for my mother and save others’ distress." Lady Wang laughed, "That will indeed be good!" So Ping He ceased working and every day carried the red pearl, going about healing the sick. Where he shone its light, the patients were all cured.

At first he served the nearby villagers, then word spread, and even those from afar came seeking his cure. Ping He’s heart was set on helping others; he took no money, and gifts sent he distributed among the poor; if honest and upright persons fell on hard times, he prayed to the pearl to send them silver and rice. Thus, in less than three years, the fame of Ping He the great benefactor was known far and wide. He was frank and never lied. Asked whence he had such power, he said it was all by the red pearl, and he knew nothing else. Asked whence he got the pearl, he told honestly, without concealment. Thus he attracted the attention of a certain man, the official of Guan Kou, surnamed Mao, named Hu. Hearing of this marvel in his jurisdiction, he resolved to send for Ping He and, if the pearl were real, to use his official power to demand it. Having made his plan, he consulted with his wife Hu Shi. She said, "If this treasure be real, have him cure our daughter’s disease first; pay him well for it. If you press him too hard, the people will gossip." Mao Hu agreed and sent two messengers to summon Ping He. When Ping He asked the reason, the messengers said, "Our lady suffers from madness; hearing of the magical pearl in your power, we beg you to come and cure her, and you shall be richly rewarded." Ping He bade farewell to his mother and set out. Lady Wang frowned, "Son, official matters are fraught with danger; be careful!" He promised, "I know," and followed the messengers to the yamen.

Mao Hu, hearing the doctor had come with the divine pearl, was glad, and received him with courtesy, questioning the origin and power of the pearl. Ping He told the truth. Mao Hu listened half believing, then bade him enter to cure his daughter. Ping He followed. The girl’s face was pale as paper, eyes fixed and dazed, obviously possessed by a demon. Ping He took out the red pearl and waved it before her. The pearl was a spirit object; how could the mountain demons and wild goblins withstand its radiance?

With a cry she fell backward. Ping He withdrew the pearl, and she instantly rose, seeing her parents, and burst into tears, "Father, mother, I have suffered so!" Mao Hu and wife were speechless with joy and thanked Ping He. The girl said, "In spring while playing in the back garden, a sudden foul wind struck my nose, and I fainted. Since then I have had no control over my actions, and know naught of reason." Ping He said, "You need not say more; it is a demon that possessed your body to enjoy earthly blessings." Mao Hu invited Ping He to the outer hall and feasted him. During the meal, he asked if Ping He would sell the pearl. Ping He laughed, "Though I have the pearl, it is not mine to keep. When the time is up, the immortal will reclaim it and give it back to the old dragon. I dare not sell it. Even if you take it, it will not stay long. Why make trouble?" Mao Hu thought he was refusing, and pleaded repeatedly.

Ping He, still a child in heart, grew angry and said, "I got the pearl to cure my mother’s blindness. Afterwards I helped others and gained some merit, but never took any reward. If it were kept in your house, you would have no leisure to cure others, and the pearl would be wasted. You, a great noble, with all your comforts, would only keep it as a treasure, which would be useless and hinder my merit. Such a thing that harms others and profits not yourself— I advise you to abandon it!" Mao Hu was angered and ordered his men to seize Ping He, confiscate the pearl, and prevent him from spreading heresies or causing trouble. Seeing the men advance, Ping He was furious, sprang up, and with a kick struck one down; with a punch felled another. The men shouted and drew weapons, rushing upon him.

Fearful of harm, Ping He clutched the pearl and cried, "My lord, do not be angry! Gentlemen, let there be no fighting; hear me!" Mao Hu thought he meant to offer the pearl and bade them hold back to hear him. Ping He spoke calmly, "My lord is a great officer; I dare not disobey. But the pearl is not mine to keep. If I give it to you, the immortals will reproach me, the dragon demand it back, and death is sure, along with the guilt of negligence. If I obey your wish, I cannot leave the yamen alive; I would rather die within your hall, and even after death, may seek forgiveness from the immortals. If you doubt me, see, I will swallow the pearl at once. Though I cannot live, and though you strike me, I shall bear no complaint." Saying this, he opened his mouth and swallowed the pearl, as large as a plum and red as rosy clouds, with a gulp. Mao Hu commanded the men to seize him, but it was too late. Ping He’s face changed, his complexion like golden paper, eyes like copper bells, and he walked straight out. Mao Hu dared not stop him.

Ping He hastened home and, seeing his mother, fell to the ground weeping, "My poor mother, I can serve you no longer!" Lady Wang was alarmed and asked why. He only said, "The pearl is within me!" Before he could finish, she was ashen-faced and cried, "Alas! The pearl is the dragon elixir; if taken within the body, you will become a dragon!" Suddenly a fierce wind blew, dark clouds gathered.

Lady Wang saw ten thousand rays of golden light and was dizzy; in mid-air she heard a dragon’s cry. Looking fixedly, she saw a golden dragon winding up and down. Looking again for Ping He, he was gone.

What strange things befell Ping He after his transformation into a dragon, we shall see in the next chapter.
