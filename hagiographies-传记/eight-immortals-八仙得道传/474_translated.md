# Chapter 6: The Two Dragons Contend for the Pearl of Spirit and Qi — Uproar in the Upper Realm as the Jade Emperor Seeks Worthy Ones

Now it happened that the flying dragon, seeing that the Daoist boy was but some ten years of age, called out to him, "Young Brother," deeming this the height of courtesy. But unexpectedly this provoked the boy’s anger, who retorted that the dragon’s assertion of his age was as if he were the ancestor of the flying dragon himself. This so startled the dragon that he paused a moment, then suddenly laughed aloud, saying, "Young Brother, your words are indeed on my behalf, and truly they are not without reason. Do you not reckon me worthy to be your ancestor's elder? Ha ha, this is indeed most laughable!" The dragon had intended to say that from the time he was first formed from rush ropes into a human body, and thence transformed into a dragon form, at least two thousand years had passed, which, compared to ordinary men, was indeed seventeen or eighteen generations more, not to be deemed excessive. Yet the boy was greatly displeased, laughing boisterously as well, saying, “In all the world, there are truly such presumptuous maidens who know not age nor propriety! Do not go! Take this spear, and test the treasure of your old ancestor!” So saying, he already drew his spear and thrust it directly at the flying dragon. The flying dragon seeing the boy's attack, could no longer yield, and drew his sword to meet the assault.

The two engaged beside the road at the foot of the mountain. At their first clash, each felt the other’s weapon had weight, and both were greatly astonished, fearing to slight the other. Each put forth all his strength, fiercely thrusting. For twenty or so rounds they contended, until the boy, filled with zeal, leapt into the air and cried, “Behold, impish fiend, see the treasure of your ancestor approach!” The flying dragon looked and saw a red pearl rolling swiftly in the air.

In a moment, ten thousand rays of red light darted toward the flying dragon, enveloping him wholly within that red glow. The flying dragon felt his whole body as if burning with fire. The heat grew ever fiercer and overwhelming, and in anger he shouted, “Good fellow, how dare you seek to please your ancestress! You have your treasure; do others have none?” As he spoke, he spat forth from his mouth a pearl of golden light, which filled the sky, contesting the red light in a fierce struggle, so that the air was full of flashing gold and red, darting to and fro.

Though it was high noon, the strong sunlight was entirely obscured by the two lights. Many of the common folk were terrified and bewildered, shutting their doors and hiding indoors, fearing to appear. The fighting between the flying dragon and the boy lasted for an hour or so, neither gaining the advantage. The flying dragon wondered what this red pearl could be, that it possessed power equal to his own dragon elixir. Thinking thus, he resolved to employ a spell to seize it. Firstly, to eliminate the boy; secondly, to obtain a matching dragon pearl for himself, which would be most delightful. So he secretly uttered the sacred incantation, stretching out his hand to beckon the red pearl. As he hoped, the pearl obeyed the charm, falling into his hand, and the red glow gradually dispersed. The flying dragon rejoiced, but suddenly perceived that the golden light he had emitted likewise faded to a wisp, vanishing from sight. Alarmed, he looked up and saw that his dragon elixir had been taken by the boy. It was as though they had exchanged pearls. Though no victor had emerged, each held the other’s treasure, which none could wield. For these treasures were fashioned from one’s vital essence and soul—each was the man, and the man was the pearl; size and shape changed as commanded. Exchanged thus, their power was lost. Both were filled with regret.

Then the boy first lost his temper. He transformed himself into a great dragon, its length over thirty li from head to tail, its eyes black and fierce, its mouth wide as a blood basin, and suddenly lunged at the flying dragon. The flying dragon then perceived the boy to be of his own kind, and twisted his body to slip past him and burrow into the ground. He too was a great true dragon. The two dragons met and circled each other, turning the vast blue sky alternately bright and dark, dispersing the mists and clouds. The lower beings were terrified, each household closing doors, burning incense, and bowing in worship. This fierce combat, in which each lost his cultivated great elixir, became known throughout the world as the tale of the Two Dragons Contending for the Pearl.

The two dragons fought fiercely for a whole day, stubbornly refusing to yield. Without notice, their battle ascended beyond the middle realm toward heaven. At that moment the Jade Emperor was ascending the throne in the Lingxiao Palace, conversing with many celestial officials on heavenly affairs. Suddenly the golden and red lights shot upward into the sky, arousing his wonder. Soon the lights dispersed, but a foul stench wafted to the palace, troubling the senses. He asked the assembled immortals, “What is this portent? Why is there such a foul smell? I am lord of heaven, presiding over the true immortals of the three realms; how can such demonic vapour rise to the precious hall? You must swiftly investigate, report promptly, that I may dispatch generals to slay these fiends.” The celestial official Li Chang Geng, called the Venus Star, stepped forth, bowing and declaring his willingness to inquire, and so he proceeded to report.

Li Chang Geng obeyed the imperial edict, passing through the Southern Heavenly Gate. Looking down, he saw the two evil dragons locked in bitter combat, their scales flying, armor shattered, heads broken and bleeding. They appeared near fainting, yet refused to descend, instead rising higher and higher, reaching outside the Southern Heavenly Gate. Li Chang Geng hastily grasped his sword, calling out loudly, “Wicked beasts, be not insolent! Look up and see where you are! How dare you rampage thus! Withdraw at once!” The two dragons, hearing this, were startled and ceased their assault. Looking up, they saw an old Daoist standing upon the clouds, loudly reproving them. The dragons, who had never been to heaven, though seeing splendid jade towers among the mists, had thought them the abodes of earthly kings and were not greatly afraid. Hearing Li Chang Geng’s rude speech, they became furious, saying, “Old slave, how dare you speak so disrespectfully! We fight among ourselves; what concern is that of yours? Why meddle in these trifles? Since you speak wildly, we will first deal with you, and then resume our contest!”

Without waiting for reply, the two dragons flew furiously towards the Southern Heavenly Gate. Li Chang Geng was frightened and fled, hastening to the palace to report, “Two demonic dragons in the lower realm rebel and have come to assault the precious hall! May Your Majesty dispatch troops to defend it!” The Jade Emperor was greatly alarmed, “What dragons are these? None have reported them before. Who shall be sent to exterminate these demons?” Before he finished, a gust of wind sounded at the palace front, and two reckless dragons actually rushed in, crying, “Hand over the old man, and we shall spare your kingdom! If not, we will summon our magic and drown your whole realm within moments!” The Jade Emperor, distraught, said, “The demons are here! Dispatch all guards at the heavenly gates to block the passes! Summon my nephew Erlang, commanding heavenly troops, to suppress the demons!” Li Chang Geng hastened forthwith to summon Erlang. There were four generals—Deng, Xin, Zhang, and Tao—each wielding weapons to attack the dragons. Enraged, the dragons exerted their full strength, butting the palace with their heads, striking the gates with their tails, twisting their bodies to hurl the four generals thousands of li away. Alarmed, the Jade Emperor and many immortals retreated to the rear hall. With a crash like heaven and earth collapsing, the dragons struck down a corner of the palace roof. Many precious utensils were smashed to pieces. Yet the dragons still demanded the old man be delivered forth to meet death.

The Jade Emperor’s face darkened with wrath, saying, “I am lord of the heavens, ruler of the myriad immortals of the three realms. Now these demon dragons rebel and dare to assault the precious hall, destroying the palace. Yet no one shares my burden or aids me; is this not shameful to death?” The attendant immortals hung their heads, speechless. Outside, the dragons grew more violent, attempting to enter the rear hall. Eight great immortals near the Jade Emperor came out to the front hall, shouting, “You two dragons, whence do you come? How did you attain the Way? For what cause do you rebel in the heavenly court? Declare each cause clearly! Know that this is the Tongming Hall, abode of the Jade Emperor; here you may not act thus rashly. The Jade Emperor has decreed that if you repent and submit, your offences may be pardoned. But if you persist in arrogance and error, when the heavenly troops arrive your bones shall be ashes, and all your thousand years of cultivation lost!”

Hearing this, the two dragons understood that this was the celestial administration. Their mischief was no small matter. They reluctantly spoke with human speech, telling how their quarrel had arisen, how they had fought, and how, resenting their elder brother’s unjust reproach, they were united in capturing the old Daoist and drowning him in the Eastern Sea to feed the fishes and shrimps. Unaware that this was the Jade Emperor’s palace, they now recognized their guilt and dared not act rashly again, seeking the great immortals to intercede for mercy on account of their ignorance and to forgive their great sins. Yet they refused to reveal their origin, cultivation time, or secret place of practice. The immortals relaxed, returning to report to the Jade Emperor. The Jade Emperor said, “Those who cultivate the Way must have masters. Who are these two beasts’ masters? Go question once more! I shall summon their masters to deal with their deserved punishment.” When the eight immortals returned with this message, the two dragons, knowing they had offended heaven, dared not stay and had already fled to the lower realm.

The Jade Emperor came forth again, summoning all ranks of immortals to deliberate on aftermath and suppression. Just then, Li Chang Geng brought Erlang from Guankou, leading all troops to await orders, and reported, “Under my charge there is also an old dragon who has become demon. Recently he used magic to move a hill and cover the sea at Guankou, turning water to land, seizing the work of heaven and earth. We planned to dispatch troops to capture him, but he escaped. Now we have a clear decree to arrest the demon dragon. I wonder if this is the same demon of Guankou?” The Jade Emperor was comforted and ordered the heavenly troops to proceed to the lower realm to quell rebellion. Erlang obeyed the command.

The Jade Emperor, seeing the collapsed palace corner and crooked pillars, and many treasure utensils of the Nine Provinces and Four Seas ruined, was displeased. He asked Li Chang Geng, “I am lord of the heavens and leader of myriad immortals. Among the heavenly court are many eminent men of talent and profound magic. How could these two demons rampage so unrestrained, as if no one were there? Has no celestial officer been able to pursue two little demons? If so, in future the beasts of the lower realm with any skill will act as they please, lawless and reckless. Even my Tongming Hall might one day be destroyed by demons and devils, leaving not a tile standing. What would become of the three realms then? I would be a mere name, a powerless Jade Emperor. What means have you to protect the heavenly mansions and maintain peace in the heavens? Speak freely without reserve.”

Li Chang Geng stepped forward and said, “Long rule brings disorder, disorder brings calamity; governance, chaos, safety, and danger are all fixed in destiny. I formerly served in the Eight Scenic Palace, where I heard Lao Jun and Yuan Shi discuss calamity. They said that this year in Tongming Hall there would be a slight disaster. I thought this could not affect the Emperor who leads myriad immortals and controls the fate of calamity. I smiled at the words of the two immortals as vain, not caring to consider. But now this demon dragon disaster has occurred, confirming their speech. Thus the principle of calamity is seen: even the Great Sage Immortals know the reason, yet cannot avoid it. I have also heard Lao Jun predict that soon there will be great floods in the lower realm, drowning creatures by the hundreds of millions. Fortunately, a Sage of the Fate has appeared in the world, who will receive the mandate of the lower realm and serve as chief minister to govern the waters. Then the boundaries of water and land will be renewed. The affairs on land will be governed by human rulers; for the waters, two dragons skilled and talented must be appointed to manage them. I have sent his great disciples, the Fire Dragon and the Mysterious True Immortal, to receive and train these two true dragons, hidden beneath the waters awaiting the summons.” He continued, “The two dragons, one male and one female, have a destined union, to be matched as husband and wife, to bear dragon offspring, serving as masters of the seas of east, south, west, and north, great and small, inner and outer, assisting the human sovereign, receiving heaven’s command to ensure peace in the four seas. Demons hide, and fishes and insects live out their lives. This matter is most important; is it not these two monsters alone who possess such power? Dragons of the world may not even attain middle or upper realms, much less such deeds. I think to understand this matter, one should consult Patriarch Lao Jun; he will surely explain it.” The Jade Emperor said, “Though so, since the two dragons have been received and subdued by Lao Jun’s disciples and are to serve in the water governance, they should be cautious and prepared to obey the summons. How dare they act so rashly? Though calamity be predestined, these two dragons bear great guilt. How can they again be appointed? Will it not make the celestial immortals laugh at my lack of discernment?” Li Chang Geng replied, “Lao Jun is ancestor of the immortals; the Fire Dragon and Mysterious True Immortal are Golden Immortals of the upper realm; they surely know the cause and effect. I will go at once to inquire and report again.”

The Jade Emperor commanded swift action. He added, “Though governance, chaos, and safety concern calamity, the selection of worthy men is the duty of the emperor. I see that many of my ministers lack talent to respond to change. Henceforth I will nurture and appoint virtuous men. You shall ask Lao Jun if there be such worthy immortals, to recommend them to me, that they may serve as pillars of defense. If none be found at present, you shall inquire how to cultivate and train them, and report fully.” Li Chang Geng took his commission, left the palace, and descended on the clouds to the Eight Scenic Palace. There he beheld the palace differing from Tongming Hall, quiet and solemn beyond compare. Around the palace were strange flowers and herbs, wondrous birds and colourful fowls innumerable. Yet, mindful of his imperial mission, he advanced step by step, hastening toward the gate. At the gate, a white crane boy greeted him with a smile, saying, “The Patriarch knew you would surely come, old Daoist!”

Li Chang Geng scolded, “Wicked beast! Be not rude! Go and announce that I seek audience with the Patriarch!” The boy, hearing this, turned and laughed, “You shameless old fellow, you have called me a wicked beast and suffer great loss. You run hither and thither, nearly troubling the Jade Emperor and causing unrest. Now that you have leisure, you dare come here to insult me! Very well! You have face enough; enter yourself to see the Patriarch. I need not announce you!” Saying this, he sulked and sat upon a rock, calling out to birds. At his call, a hundred birds of red, green, black, white, big and small, male and female, flew down in a great flock, surrounding the boy in a large ring. When the boy moved, the birds followed. The boy amused himself and no longer minded Li Chang Geng.

Li Chang Geng watched for a time, then laughed, “See, this child is so unreasonable! Now that I need him, I must pay him a courtesy. Returning, I will see the Patriarch and speak with him.” So he stepped forward, smiling with apology, saying, “Young brother, joking aside, I come on serious business. Know you why I am here? The Jade Emperor has commanded me to consult the Patriarch. If I delay, not only shall I suffer, but the Patriarch’s face will be lost. Good brother, please announce me; do not tease me further.” The boy spat and said, “Don’t frighten me with your Jade Emperor. Here I know only the Patriarch. No matter how great your face may be, if you want to see the Patriarch, you must first win my favour. If I do not announce you, even the Jade Emperor cannot see him, much less you, old man.” Li Chang Geng smiled, “Child, you speak nonsense. If you are slow, and the Patriarch knows, will he not punish you? But now that I seek your favour, I have no time to dispute. I beg your pardon.” He bowed sincerely. The boy laughed heartily, saying, “I have not seen such a useless creature, frightened so easily. Since you pity me, I will announce you.” Rising, he waved his hand, dispersing the birds, and leaped inside.

After a while, he came out and beckoned Li Chang Geng, saying, “Old man, come! The Patriarch bids you enter!” Li Chang Geng tidied his clothes, and respectfully followed the boy inside. He saw Lao Jun and bowed deeply. Lao Jun bade him rise, smiling, saying, “You come to inquire about the two demon dragons, do you not?” Li Chang Geng bowed and delivered the Jade Emperor’s decree. Lao Jun smiled again, saying, “As for these two demon dragons, it was I who sent men to receive and subdue them. When they first gained human form, they entered the ranks of immortals by my special grace. But their wild nature remained untamed; they did not learn propriety, and had not entered the heavenly mansions. They knew not the Tongming Precious Hall. By chance your words provoked their anger, causing this great mischief. Though so, all is predestined. The Jade Emperor must suffer some vexation and a false alarm at this time. The matter is past and needs no further mention. Now is the time to use them to achieve merit; for the moment let it be. As for their sins, they shall not escape retribution in time to come. It is not proper now to foresee that. You may return and report to the Jade Emperor.”

Li Chang Geng further asked the Jade Emperor, troubled that none among the celestial immortals could subdue the two dragons, and whether the Patriarch might send virtuous immortals to assist in protecting the heavenly administration. Lao Jun laughed and said, “My disciples each have their duties, and are unrelated to the Jade Emperor’s affairs; they cannot serve as his ministers. Yet the Jade Emperor’s court lacks men of virtue and talent. I have long foreseen that within three thousand years, I shall receive eight Golden Immortals. Some have already appeared but are not yet human-formed. In time I will send men to receive them and perfect their true fruits. You must always obey my commands, whether in the heavenly court or the mortal world, to aid them until they attain the Way. This will be your greatest merit.” Li Chang Geng bowed in thanks, took leave of Lao Jun, and returned to the heavenly palace to report.

How the matter proceeded will be told in the next chapter.
