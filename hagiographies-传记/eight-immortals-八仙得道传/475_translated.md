# Chapter VII: On Claiming Merit and Renowned Masters Rescuing Worthy Disciples — Recounting Old Affairs of a Rat Transformed into a Bat

Now it so happened that the Erlang God led forth many celestial soldiers and generals, in pursuit of two dragons. Passing through the upper and middle Heavens, they pressed on until they reached the lower Heaven. Fixing his gaze upon the clouds, he opened his eye of wisdom and looked downwards. He saw that the two dragons had already entered the Eastern Sea and were about to hide beneath the water. Erlang God quickly made a Water-Calming Spell, and with a finger pointed downwards, the waters closed like sea ice, as if cast in bronze and iron. The two dragons could not descend; looking up, they perceived that it was the magic power exerted by that divine general. Both dragons were greatly enraged; each revealed their human form, brandished their treasured swords, and sprang aloft to attack Erlang. Erlang God was unperturbed; he unfolded his painted halberd and strove against the two dragons with all his might. The battle lasted for twenty exchanges, and the dragons gradually began to falter. The flying dragon first resumed its original form and fled eastward; the other dragon followed in flight.

But Erlang was not willing to give up. Leading his troops, he pursued bitterly, seeing that they were not far ahead. Erlang drew two divine bullets from his sleeve, holding one in each hand, and cast them at the two dragons. With a cry of “Strike!”, two beams of golden light fell upon the dragons’ heads; then there was a tremendous explosion as both dragon heads were struck. The attack caused sparks to fly, their minds to ache, and they almost fell from the clouds.

Erlang was amazed and said, “My divine bullets, whether striking demons or men, when they hit, none survive. How is it that these two dragons can endure my shot? They must have cultivated long and possess some Taoist skill, so I shall now simply use the flying sword to sever them; let us see how they can resist.” So he opened his mouth, and suddenly a beam of white light shot forth toward the two dragons’ heads; a chill wind blew, cold and piercing. At the onset of the light, the two dragons shuddered, as if unable to endure this blow. But before speech could be made, swifter than ten thousand times, the sword light approached the dragons, when suddenly there was a great rumble; a layer of red light arose in the sky, forcing Erlang’s sword light to retreat more than twenty li. Then a voice was heard amid the red light: “Erlang, hold back; these two beasts have offended Heaven’s law and shall receive their due retribution in time. Now they have their uses. Erlang, please cease your toil.” Before the words were finished, two immortals already stood before Erlang.

Erlang hastily withdrew his sword light, raised his hand in salute, and said, “Fire Dragon and Miao-miao, where do you come from? How is it that you see these two beasts should not perish today?” Fire Dragon the immortal smiled and said, “To speak of right and wrong is to be a man of right and wrong. Erlang, do you not yet know that we two have a great affinity with these two beasts? Brother Miao-miao has gone back and forth many times to your jurisdiction at Guan-kou on their behalf.” Erlang suddenly understood and said, “Oh! These beasts are the demon dragons from your jurisdiction at Guan-kou? I have heard that some immortal once delivered them from the world; I did not know it was Brother Miao-miao. You two are too fond of meddling. Do you know of the mountain-moving and sea-covering deeds these dragons wrought in our jurisdiction? Do you know how they made great disturbance in Heaven and moved the Jade Emperor? Now the Jade Emperor is greatly angered and has sent me to capture and punish them. How then can you plead for them?”

Miao-miao and Fire Dragon both laughed and said, “Though these two beasts are bold, they have never ascended to the Heavenly Court, and know not the way of clear illumination. We know of this matter; it was Li Chang-geng who brought about this disaster! Originally the sanctity of the spirit mansion was not to suffer such insolence from beasts. One thing is that it is fate decreed; another is that retribution will come in due time. There is no need to speak further now. In any case, all is under the mastership of our revered Patriarch; even the Jade Emperor’s countenance is explained for by him, so that he will not place the gods in difficulty.”

Erlang said again, “There is also the matter of our jurisdiction’s sea waters being filled in and made level; this water concerns the people’s food and is used for regulation and supervision. Now that more than half has been lost, many people have suffered.” Miao-miao the immortal laughed and said, “That is easier still: soon there will be a great flood in the lower world; the sage who controls waters has already been born. I will surely invite him to find a means to deepen the remaining sea water twofold, to deepen the narrow parts, so that the quantity of water will not be lessened. The filled-in land can become fields for the people, which is also not without benefit.” Erlang smiled and said, “If so, I will then withdraw my troops and return to Heaven to report. Brothers, you and our Patriarch must not speak falsely, lest I suffer unjustly!” The two immortals laughed and said, “A jest! A jest! Would our Patriarch regard us disciples as so unreliable?” Erlang laughed heartily and withdrew his troops.

The two immortals descended upon the clouds and smiled at one another, saying, “With these two monsters, we have indeed taken on an added responsibility.”

Fire Dragon the immortal said, “My disciple is not so bad; his temper is not excessively violent. After all, the female kind is somewhat better than the male. But I ask you: since you brought your disciple to the Eastern Sea, you should have quietly awaited my arrival, matched their yin and yang, and sent them into the sea; why did you cast him at the sea’s edge, causing the two beasts not to recognize one another and making such a great disturbance? Brother, this is your responsibility!”

Miao-miao the immortal laughed and said, “Brother, you are the unfeeling one; I only went kindly to see you and to inform you of your disciple’s unruly conduct in the Qiantang River, contrary to the master’s instructions. Why do you turn and blame me?”

Fire Dragon again laughed and said, “Well said! Well said! You cannot even govern your own disciple, who has caused such great trouble in our jurisdiction at Guan-tian, and yet you have leisure to mind these matters for me!”

Miao-miao sighed and said, “Speaking of this matter, it is indeed pitiful. My disciple is a mixture of human spirit and dragon essence, with a very upright nature and great filial piety. Once we two met in the clouds of the west, at which time I had confined her beneath the sea and ordered her to cultivate her功行. Yet her filial piety was not extinguished; each year on her mother’s birthday she would transform into human form to pay respects. After her mother died, she went to mourn and buried her mother’s body at the southwest foot of a mountain at Guan-kou, returning at festivals to honor the tomb. This was her filial heart. I knew she left the water quietly and did not chide her. Yet not long after, she caused a great disaster. Brother, you spoke of my disciple causing trouble at Guan-kou; you must surely know the details of this matter?”

Fire Dragon shook his head and laughed, saying, “I have only heard of this; the full particulars are not clear to me. What can you tell me?”

Miao-miao sighed again and said, “By the decree of Heaven, my disciple’s incident at Guan-kou, and your disciple’s in the Qiantang River, were both preordained. Since the numbers are fixed beforehand, even the Jade Emperor cannot control the idle airs of these two beasts! How much less you and I, or others! Brother, did you not hear our Patriarch say that within three thousand years, eight great golden immortals would successively be born and attain the Tao, to assist the Jade Emperor as ministers? Among them is one already born but not yet matured, a certain rat. We do not know why this rat is unlike common rats: since its birth, it has never damaged human property, but rather worships the Big Dipper and the stars, diligently cultivating and refining itself. Though a small creature, it has attained an imperishable body, living four or five thousand years, during the era of the Three Sovereigns when floods plagued the land, causing people and livestock, fields and homes to be swept away in countless numbers. This rat was carried from the Central Plains to the western lands, now the port area. Because it had cultivated long, its dharma body was firm; though adrift amid vast waves for three or four thousand li, it survived with life intact. Guan-kou was originally a low piece of land, but after that flood, water gathered to form an islet, an inland sea spread for a thousand li. When the flood first came, a village of some two thousand people, old and young, fled to higher ground. Passing a place with heights on both sides and a river over three zhang wide, usually deep with water, now impassable, all could not cross except by a small lone wooden bridge. But the crowd was great and the bridge decayed; all struggled to cross, exerting much force, when with a crack the bridge broke in two, many rushing into the water and swept away by the current, whereabouts unknown. The water’s force was great and the danger severe; those on the bank were caught in a dilemma, their cries shaking Heaven and Earth. The rat was among the people, hoping to escape with the multitude. Seeing the broken bridge and weeping people, the scene was grim indeed. But his good roots were deep, and he forgot his own danger, thinking only how to save many from crossing the river. After some thought, he suddenly devised a method. He flew to the broken bridge and looked along the break; seeing the bridge not entirely fallen, some parts remained connected but submerged, so uncrossable. The rat, possessing great strength, examined carefully and then boldly swam, climbing up the half bridge on the other side; in an instant he reached the opposite bank. He turned back and called to the crowd, as if to comfort them not to despair, for he would find a way to save them. The people, seeing this great rat crossing the broken bridge, wondered much; but they were desperate and did not heed. Later, hearing his repeated calls, they were somewhat amazed. A wise man shouted across the river, ‘Brother Rat, congratulations on your escape! Pity us many, unable to cross. You are on the other bank; do you know a way to save us? If we can cross and live, we will build you a shrine to worship you and repay your great kindness!’ Though speaking thus, the man thought it mere fancy, hardly expecting success. Yet the rat heard and nodded repeatedly, showing full understanding. The crowd was further amazed and said: ‘See this great rat, he truly has some Taoist skill. Since we are doomed, let us stand and see what he will do.’ The rat nodded and flew off. They did not know where he went, but soon he returned dragging a long tree trunk in his teeth, which he placed in the water along the broken bridge. The people knew he truly came to save them, and their cheers echoed through the valley. But one tree limb was insufficient. The rat nodded again to the crowd, swam back across, and called out several times as before, then flew off again. After a moment, he returned with another trunk about the same length, which he dragged across the river as before. The people now knew his design. All joined in effort to aid him, holding the two trunks and fastening them to the original bridge piles. The rat, on the far bank, worked his magic; biting into the earth with his mouth, he made two great holes to insert the ends of the trunks. Thus a bridge of two logs was formed. People, helping each other, crossed one by one, taking several hours to complete. Just then, a great flood surged upstream; several great waves rolled, striking the rat and sweeping him away hundreds of li downstream. The good-hearted rat gasped for breath, exhausted from repeated hardships; as a small creature, his strength was spent. He caught hold of a large branch and struggled upward, but was dizzy and could not stand, rolling into the water again, falling into a pool a hundred zhang deep. The rat lost consciousness, seeming dead. After some time, he found himself lying on a great rock, beside which stood a Taoist boy who smiled and said: ‘Beast, you have awakened! Come and pay your respects to your master.’ The rat knew in his heart that only some immortal had saved him from the deep water to the high mountain. Hearing the boy’s words, he understood more and hastened to rise, bowing repeatedly to the boy. The boy beckoned and smiled, saying: ‘Come with me to see your master!’ The rat followed him and after a short distance arrived at a mountain cave, within which dwelt an old immortal cultivating Tao. The rat and boy entered and paid respects to the old immortal, and the rat was deeply grateful. Tears suddenly flowed from his two rat eyes. The old immortal comforted him, saying: ‘Though you are a strange creature, you have Heaven’s favour and good roots, and have cultivated great功行. Therefore I sent a strongman to save you up the mountain. It has been one hundred twenty-five days since you nearly drowned in the river.’ The rat, hearing this, stuck out his tongue. The old immortal said: ‘I pity your cultivation of thousands of years without attaining true fruit, nor even human form; this is because you are of such low origin and have no chance to see true immortals. Now you need no longer live the life of a burrowing animal; remain in my cave as a guarding youth, and slowly you shall receive true teachings and some spells, by which you may change your body and be born anew, first becoming human. In a thousand or two thousand years, you may transform into an immortal body.’ The rat accepted, bowing a thousand and one times. The old immortal laughed and said: ‘Since you serve here, you must also change your original form, lest the senior disciples despise you. You have been long in the water and must be hungry; boy, take him to the newly ripened peaches on the peach tree behind the mountain, pick two for his hunger, and then bring him to me.’ The boy obeyed and led him behind the mountain. There were many fruit trees, among which a large peach tree bore many fruits. The boy laughed and said: ‘You are light and agile; climb yourself and pick two of the reddest peaches to eat, then come down. Do not be greedy and eat too much, lest you fall ill tomorrow and I bear no responsibility.’ The rat obeyed, climbed to the treetop, selected two red, fat peaches, and ate them. Suddenly he felt itching in his ribs and scratched with his forepaws; the more he scratched, the more it itched, unbearably so. He also felt as if something was about to emerge from within. The rat panicked and tried to climb down to ask the boy. Suddenly two wings stretched forth from the itching place, flapping lightly with great ease; all his strength seemed gathered in the wings. The rat, clever as he was, understood his master’s intention to change his form and rejoiced greatly. He tried to spread his wings, which caught the air and floated him lightly to the ground, startling the boy. The boy laughed and said: ‘Rat, how have you changed to look like this?’ Then he took him back to the cave. The immortal, seeing the rat transformed into a flying insect, laughed heartily and renamed him ‘Bat’.

Miao-miao the immortal told the story to this point, and Fire Dragon nodded and smiled, saying, “I know something of this matter. Even now, among the rat clan there are those who have transformed into bats, descended from his line.” Miao-miao laughed and said, “So you know something too. Since then this bat followed that old immortal, listening to the Tao and receiving instruction with devotion. After six or seven hundred years, it could even speak human language and transform into various flying insects and beasts, though it could not yet transform into human form. Brother, do you know who that immortal is?” Fire Dragon nodded and said, “I have heard that Immortal Wenmei took a certain rat as disciple; it must be him.” Miao-miao laughed and said, “Who else could it be? He was a chief disciple of the Primordial Lord, who loved to take such strange creatures as disciples. He had often caused much trouble because of this, and was admonished by our Patriarch many times, but has since become more cautious.”

Fire Dragon laughed and said, “Just now we spoke of your disciple causing trouble, and now you bring in rats and bats. Could these also be connected to your disciple?” Miao-miao said, “Certainly so; how else would I be caught up in this without reason? This is what the saying means: ‘Affairs arise from following footsteps’.” Fire Dragon again said, “You also said this small bat will have a great fate in the future. What is this about? I know nothing.”

Miao-miao said, “Though we can know past and future events, our scope is but a hundred years. Beyond a hundred years, our foresight is uncertain. Only our Patriarch and the Primordial Heavenly Worthy can discern the unforeseeable future and the infinite past. He said that eight great immortals will assist the Jade Emperor in time, and our band is only responsible for guiding them into the world and helping them attain immortality. None of us will ascend to the Heavenly Mansion or be listed in the court. He also said the earliest born is a little rat, whose lifespan exceeds ours. Yet his attainment of the immortal path will take three to five thousand years. If this is so, is it not that very bat? This has been long known among the immortals, understood by many, yet you alone remain ignorant; this is truly strange.”

What further words Fire Dragon might have spoken is unknown; we await the next chapter to unfold.
