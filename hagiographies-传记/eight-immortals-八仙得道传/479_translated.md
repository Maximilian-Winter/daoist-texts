# Chapter 11: The Dragon's Misdirected Wrath and the Master's Humiliation in Capturing the Demon

It is related that in the preceding chapters the Immortal Piao Miao had spoken to the Fire Dragon Immortal concerning a certain mouse that had transformed into a bat, and who guarded the cave-residence of the Immortal Wenmei on the Western Qi Mountain. Later, because of his merit among the people of Guankou, he was appointed to receive incense offerings there. The Immortal had calculated that the period of these offerings would be near a thousand years. Yet, before the thousand years were completed, a certain flood-dragon caused upheaval and destroyed his temple. The bat, originally loyal and humble, seeing the incense offerings near their end, no longer fostered vain hopes, and returned to the mountain to pay respects to his master, the Immortal Wenmei, recounting all that had happened.

The Immortal, silently turning his divine devices, after a long while sighed and said: “Though thy origin be of a strange kind, and among beasts the lowest and most base, yet thou hast attained such accomplishment, which might cause men to suppose that thy cultivation had been for a long time. This degree of attainment is not altogether rare; but since the beginning of the Way, to have left the smallest of animals and attained the Dao as a man, and to have a vast future, I fear there is none second to thee. It seems that Heaven hath not dealt harshly with thee. Wherefore do I utter these words? Because thy lowly origin and thy great future are most unusual; and as to things obtained beyond due measure, many unforeseen trials must arise. The deeper the trial, the greater the success, and the more precious the success. If it were easy to read a few Daoist books and cultivate for a few years to become immortal, all living beings in the world would learn to be immortals, and each would easily attain immortality! What difference then between immortal and man? If the worth of immortals be not seen, and immortals are no better, why should we toil so painfully in cultivation?”

The bat bowed and said: “Your disciple understands. Though born of strange kind, and among beasts the lowest and meanest, yet by the master's acceptance and by receiving incense offerings for a thousand years, I may not say how far I have attained, but I have gained some measure of humanity. Henceforth I shall pass from the beastly path into the human path. Others are born as men, their roots and conduct good, and cultivation easier; I dare not arrogate to myself the rank of men. Whatever hardships and trials life may bring, I am willing to endure. If I endure, it is the master's virtue that accomplishes it, and my unworthy honour! If I cannot endure, I must blame fate and lament the wasted cultivation of ten thousand years; but I will never harbour resentment. Though foolish and simple, I only know to obey Heaven and revere my master, cultivating quietly — nothing else do I ask. I hope my master will pity and teach me.”

The Immortal, hearing this, could not help but smile and raise his brows: “It is unexpected that thou hast such resolution and perseverance; truly thou art an exceptional talent among creatures, a strange thing indeed. All who are strange do not perish but become great. As to thy talent and destiny, the two words ‘perish’ and ‘defeat’ will assuredly not come to thee. Thy future success is beyond measure! Now is the critical juncture between beast and man; I will forthwith draw up the dispatch to the Court of Reincarnation in the Underworld, requesting they send thee to be reborn in the human world, choosing a good and kind family for thy incarnation. Thou must fix thy purpose, clarify thy mind and see thy nature; be not seduced by profit and desire, nor deluded by wealth and beauty; see what is right and act upon it; regard evil as an enemy; perform all good deeds with diligence, and avoid all evil. If thou dost this without slackening, when the time comes, another will help thee to be delivered from the world. Even if affairs entangle thee and setbacks occur, these are decreed by fate; thou must not lose heart or abandon thy past efforts. Know that the trials of cultivation are not true suffering, but the path that must be traveled, the stages that must be passed through. The more trials endured, the greater the future success. In short, none of this is labour without fruit. Remember well my words, forget them not! Among all my disciples, I hope only thou wilt be most fortunate.”

The bat, receiving the command, wept with gratitude and said: “Your disciple understands all. As I have said, to cultivate in harmony with fate, regardless of success or failure — moreover your clear instructions, what further fortune is required?” The Immortal was greatly pleased, immediately composing the dispatch and preparing to send it to the Underworld. But the bat knelt again and said: “One more word, may I ask, master, at first you said, ‘When the opportunity comes, another will come to deliver thee.’ Does it not follow that thou thyself may not be the one to save me? I have received thine instruction and care, like the earth’s kindness; must I then seek another master? This deeply puzzles me!”

Immortal Wenmei, hearing these words, sighed and said: “Brother, our meeting is due to fate; when the fate is fulfilled, we part. This is the natural order and need not be minded. Our relation will not end here. But the one who delivers thee is indeed not me, yet is no different from myself, for we are brothers, from the same school. I lose nothing thereby, but thou gainest a master of great virtue. Know that this too is a blessing beyond the common.”

The bat, with mingled joy and sorrow, saw the Immortal complete the dispatch and send a strongman to deliver it to the Underworld. When the King of Shades examined the records, he said: “One Sun Jie of Henan has accumulated virtue by saving countless lives. Though without offspring, let the bat be sent to be reborn in his family.” At once the judge prepared the reply, and sent it back by the strongman. The Immortal further ordered the strongman to accompany the bat, and by the King of Shades’ Bureau of Reincarnation the bat was sent to the mortal world.

By chance, Sun Jie’s wife, Lady Luo, after ten months’ pregnancy, dreamed one night of an official who brought a black flying creature, saying: “Thou and thy husband have long done good deeds, touching Heaven’s heart. The King of Shades has sent this immortal bird to be thy son. This being is of immortal seed, with vast future — not to be lightly esteemed. Take good care of him.” Having spoken, he released the bird, which flew into her arms, and she awoke with a start. Soon she felt sharp pains in her womb, and within half an hour gave birth to a fair boy, with white face, red lips, clear eyebrows and bright eyes. The couple’s joy was great indeed; the dream and the boy’s appearance showed he was no ordinary child, but one of exceptional root and talent, comforting their hearts. As he was a gift of the immortals, they named him Xiansi (Immortal Gift).

Time passed swiftly; when Xiansi was ten years old, Sun Jie and wife engaged a reputable teacher to instruct him in letters. Xiansi was endowed with heavenly intelligence, reading several lines at a glance, and understanding tenfold what he heard. By fourteen, he had filled his mind with histories and classics, ancient and modern, and many famous works. Rumours spread far and wide, and even nearby places knew that Sun Jie’s child was born of immortal seed, a wonder of talent. Presently the prefect Feng came to invite him. Sun Jie, seeing Xiansi still a child, would not consent, and repeatedly excused himself before the prefect. But when the prefect spoke with Xiansi, he knew the youth’s talent was true, and was determined to have him assist, saying to Sun Jie with a smile: “Old sir, do you still regard your son as a child? Though young, his learning is profound; he is not to be compared with ordinary grown men. He will aid me in managing records and documents, and will surely benefit the people. In a year or two I shall recommend him to court, that he may display his rare talents.” With no choice, Sun Jie and wife agreed, and Xiansi went to serve the prefect.

The prefect was greatly pleased, consulting Xiansi in all important matters of state before action. Xiansi, grateful for the trust, served diligently and spoke plainly. In less than a year, the prefecture was renewed; the people rejoiced and praised him, and the prefect was delighted. Later, Xiansi was promoted to the office of junior magistrate. Not yet twenty, handsome and accomplished, he was praised in court and countryside alike. Many noble families with daughters sought marriage alliances, and sent matchmakers. Xiansi, mature beyond his years and devoted to state affairs, did not take this to heart, replying that he must consult his parents.

One senior magistrate, Bo Gao, deeply fond of Xiansi, resolved to marry his second daughter, Hui’er, to him. Xiansi still deferred to his parents. Bo Gao came in person to plead with Sun Jie and his wife, who having heard of the daughters’ talents and virtues, consented at once. Xiansi dared not refuse. The match was arranged, and the wedding set for mid-third month of the following year.

But in that winter, Hui’er was in the garden watching servants gather winter plum blossoms, when suddenly she saw, beyond the fence, a young man gazing inward through a lattice gap. Feeling displeased, she turned to return indoors. Just as she stepped forward, a sudden blue light dazzled her eyes, and she lost consciousness, falling to the ground. Servant maids rushed to support her, crying out, but Hui’er seemed mad, crying to look outside the garden, and resisting all efforts to restrain her. The commotion alarmed all indoors. Bo Gao, just returning from court, hearing the strange news, hastened with his wife Gu and eldest daughter Ju, accompanied by all servants, to the garden. There they saw Hui’er and the others glaring fiercely, the maids exhausted, and Hui’er’s clothes torn, hair dishevelled, a wild appearance. Her eyes stared, mouth foaming, babbling incoherently. Seeing her parents she did not feel shame, but struggled to escape the garden.

Gu was heartbroken, rushing forward to embrace Hui’er, weeping and crying: “My child, what has befallen thee? Will thou not spare thy mother’s life?” Bo Gao, knowing this to be a demon possession, did not inquire further, but struck her ears with his hand, shouting: “What demon dares to work mischief here? Know that my family are loyal and upright, innocent of offense, reverent of Heaven. The celestial immortals have never slighted me. How should a low demon be so insolent? Depart at once, or I shall call upon the emperors of the mortal and immortal worlds to punish thee severely! Then thou shalt repent too late!” At these words Hui’er ceased her wildness, fell silent, and walked away.

The group followed her into the house. She went straight to her chamber, sat upright without a word, her countenance still possessed. Bo Gao and wife, helpless, summoned many famous physicians. Some diagnosed demon possession of the heart, fearing madness; others said phlegm clouding the mind, curable when cleared. Some agreed broadly; others differed completely. Bo Gao had each prepare a prescription, medicines partly similar, partly differing; no one knew who was right. Hui’er merely sneered in silence.

Gu proposed prayers to Heaven and Earth, laying out the prescriptions, asking Bo Gao to devoutly pray. After prayers, a prescription was drawn at random as an omen. Bo Gao, seeing no better plan, followed this, buying the herbs and preparing the medicine for Hui’er. She accepted it, laughing loudly, suddenly assuming a male voice: “You are all fools! The prescriptions of these quacks cannot cure me, no matter how many doses! Besides, I am well and have no illness. If you doubt, bring a pulse diagnosis expert. See if my pulse shows sickness! Ridiculous that you have hired only drunkards and gluttons, fit only to cheat and kill for money.”

She poured the steaming medicine into a basin beside her. Strange to see, a small bowlful became a full basin when poured out, towering like a pagoda. All were amazed. Bo Gao, angry beyond measure, muttered: “Though I have no great merits, I have no great faults; why should such a demon plague me?” Tears fell unawares.

Gu wept bitterly. Then Hui’er, still in the male voice, laughed: “Old folks, do not grieve. I am displeased to speak further with Bo Gao’s wild words. Now seeing your pity, I must tell you the truth. I am the Dragon God of the Western Sea. Due to sudden anger at Guankou, where the disciple of Immortal Wenmei — a certain bat insect — is honoured with incense, I, being friendly with the old dragon there, was slighted and out of temper destroyed his temple. Yet he should not have drawn the old dragon to oppose me, and pressed me beneath the sea, unable to emerge. Later the old dragon assumed my title, accepted the Heavenly Emperor’s decree, and was made Dragon King of the Four Seas. Being pressed beneath the sea, I could not oppose him. Now, the old dragon’s master, Immortal Piao Miao, by order of the Grand Ancestor, came to Guankou, with Erlang Shen, to deal with the old dragon’s moving mountains and filling seas, changing the sea into a great salt well. Beside it was a fire well for boiling salt for all beings. Beneath that fire well is where I was imprisoned. When work began, by slight negligence I escaped. I learned that the bat is now reborn as Sun Jie’s son, and is also your son-in-law, holding office as junior magistrate. I sought revenge, passing by your garden, and saw your daughter. I knew she must be Sun Jie’s wife, marveling at her beauty, yet my enemy enjoys blessing. My anger rose, so I played this trick on your daughter. If you are wise, you will break off this match at once, and I will go after the boy, my sworn enemy, who must die by my hand. Your daughter, marrying him, will become a widow. Better to part early. My act is half revenge, half for your benefit. Do you understand?”

Bo Gao, angered, said: “Nonsense! You made trouble for the bat, destroyed his temple, yet he did not seek revenge. Your suffering is due to the old dragon, not the bat, and what has this to do with my daughter? Though strange, and able to transform, you have Daoist arts and reason. Consider well — such bullying is not worthy of revenge or satisfaction!”

Hui’er struck a cabinet and cried: “Young man, I meant well; you dare accuse me of fearing the strong and oppressing the weak! The old dragon and the bat will be repaid in time; if you live a hundred years, you will see it. Now no need to speak further. As for your daughter, if she marries Sun’s son, better she wed me, the old dragon. As to status, he is a mere minor official; I am a divine dragon. As to power in Daoist arts, he is a mortal child, no match for my ten-thousand-year cultivated body. As to future benefit, marry me, and I will guide her to immortality. Even your in-laws will profit! For example, the few pills of the immortality elixir are reliable. What can your son do? You and your wife are wise; reconsider lest you ruin your daughter’s life and your own fate!”

Bo Gao retorted: “If thou art a divine dragon, should dragons act without law? Canst thou force a married woman? I suspect thou art a sea creature transformed into a demon, come to confuse and harm men. Such lawlessness cannot be allowed by Heaven! Though I on earth cannot control thy magic, are not many celestial beings above to restrain thy arrogance and evil?”

The demon, exposed, grew furious, beating tables and stools, wielding knives and staves, making a great uproar, frightening all in Bo’s household. Gu first entreated him, but failing, summoned a magistrate surnamed Ding, called Ding Dequan, to exorcise the demon.

Master Ding, holding a seven-star sword, clad in the eight-trigram Daoist robe, bearing the countenance of an immortal, ascended the altar, issuing talismans, tracing figures east and west, making great tumult. Suddenly he struck the token thrice, muttering spells, and shouting: “Great Supreme Lord Lao Tzu, hasten as the law commands!” Before finishing, a black vapour rushed toward him. Ding, terrified, dropped the token, wildly brandishing his sword like a madman. Those below thought him bravely battling the demon, admiring his skill. Yet after some time, not only had the black vapour not dispersed, but his immortal face turned pitch-black, frightful as a ghost.

The crowd below laughed and feared: “Why has Magistrate Ding become black?” Ding, deaf to them, danced madly, sweating profusely. He struggled and grew exhausted, unable to speak a word, not even the spell “Hasten as the law commands.” All then knew he was not exorcising the demon, but was overwhelmed by it.

Bo Gao, a man of virtue, was greatly distressed, and with Gu earnestly entreated. The demon, still possessing Hui’er, forced the couple to call him “High Immortal,” promising henceforth not to offend or allow witches to be summoned. Only then did Ding shout: “High Immortal, spare me! I know my guilt!”

With that, he fell faint on the altar. The people hurried to see him; he lay stiff as dead, breathing faintly and irregularly. Bo Gao grieved beyond words, ordered the altar taken down, and Ding carried outside, given hot water to drink. Ding was not ill, but had exerted himself too much, exhausting his energy and strength, hence the collapse. After rest, he could sit. Seeing Bo Gao, he shed tears and said: “Sir, I tried hard to exorcise the demon for you, but that demon is strong beyond measure. Luckily my Daoist arts are not shallow, and by your great blessing I have severed his feet. I intended to slay him, but recalling ‘Heaven and Earth cherish life,’ and by my master’s order, I dared not slay lightly, so I let him go. But he must not trouble you again. You may now rest assured. Alas, I suffered much for you, and shall be unable to perform rites for months!”

While speaking, his blackened face wrinkled, his two half-red half-white eyes glittered fearfully. Bo Gao, honest and kind, seeing him so exhausted, could not bear to expose his weakness. Yet the servants, hearing his words and seeing his face, burst out laughing. Ding then showed a faint blush amid the blackness. A servant fetched a small round mirror, joking: “Magistrate Ding, take care to look at thyself before claiming credit.” Ding, not knowing his face was blackened, looked and was terrified, jumping up and shouting: “Everyone come! The demon hides in the mirror!” This made Bo Gao laugh till bent double, pointing at the servant, speechless.

What Ding shouted next is yet to be told.
