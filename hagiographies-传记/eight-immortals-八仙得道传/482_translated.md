# Chapter XIV: Husband and Wife Cultivate the Dao Together; Kinsfolk Breed Strange Thoughts

It is told that Hu Sanjie, by some method unknown, once again persuaded Sun Xianci; and indeed she so prevailed that Xianci himself consented to take a wife. The husband and wife, Sun Jie and his spouse, knew well that this was the work of Sanjie’s persuasion, and naturally they were grateful to her. Sun Jie had long been anxious about the succession; he could not bear to have his son enter the monastic life. Now that Xianci agreed to delay so doing, it was unexpected that Madam Luo Yuan, like an old oyster producing pearls anew, bore another son. On the night before her delivery, she dreamed of a thing neither dragon nor dragon, neither flood-dragon nor flood-dragon, rushing into her womb; upon waking she cried out that her belly ached. Sun Jie had already beforehand engaged a midwife to reside constantly in the mansion, awaiting the birth. The midwife, knowing the lady’s time was at hand, used a little artifice, and in a moment, as a melon ripens and falls from its stalk, it was another son, a male. The husband and wife rejoiced at length, needless to say, and especially the one who had vowed to become a recluse, Sun Xianci, who upon receiving the news of a younger brother was even more joyful than his parents. 

That night Sanjie came again, and Xianci gladly told her of the new brother. Sanjie smiled and said, “This is indeed a matter for rejoicing, but do not rejoice prematurely. Know you that your brother may be as filial and loyal as yourself?” Xianci said, “Sister Sanjie, you jest too much. How do you prove that my brother is not a good man?” Sanjie only smiled and said no more.

The following year Xianci brought home to wed the elder Miss Bo. On the wedding night, the young couple talked the whole night through. Afterwards they mutually respected and loved each other, affectionate and close as if they were siblings of one womb, never showing any familiar or improper conduct. Sun Jie and his wife could not but watch them with special care. Since that day when Sanjie exhibited her strange sign, Luo Yuan knew she was no ordinary person, and so entrusted her to urge Xianci again to early enjoy the delights of fish and water, to embrace the joys of progeny. Sanjie laughed and said, “Before, you only wished that the eldest son would not enter the monastic life; now that there is a second son, you wish the eldest to have a son quickly. Is not this an injustice of the heart?” The husband and wife laughed and replied, “The second son is yet young; who knows when he will make a family? Now that the eldest has a wife, how can we not hope he will flourish and bear fruit!” Sanjie laughed, “This is your inner chamber’s business; others may not speak on it. Since you have entrusted me, I shall come again and talk more when the time is fit. If the eldest son consents to listen, that is best. But if he will not listen, do not blame me.” Saying this, she smiled and departed.

At the hall door, Xianci came proudly forward. Seeing Sanjie, he stretched out his hand to stop her, and invited her into his chamber to sit. Sanjie, seeing that young Miss Bo was not present, asked, “Where is your new lady?” Xianci said, “She has probably gone upstairs. Sister Sanjie, where are you hastening to?” Sanjie laughed and said, “I have come specially to pay respects to you and your wife!” Then she related the commission entrusted to her by Luo Yuan and her husband, and laughed, “I advise you, young master, better to content yourself, and be a happy man among mortals. Why must you needs leave your homeland, endure hardships and hardships, to seek that which is not to be had—the immortality of the gods? Moreover, now that you have taken this new lady, she is in her prime; would you have her share with you this lonely and sorrowful life? You are too hard-hearted.” Xianci laughed heartily and said, “Sister Sanjie tries again to test me! If I desired the wealth and honours of this world, why would I contend so with my father? Even the marriage was brought about by your repeated persuasion, and you said that Miss Bo was no vulgar woman, nor one who lusted for sensual pleasures! Though now she is your wife, she may become your companion in the Way hereafter. Because I trusted your words, knowing you are a true immortal and would not deceive, I boldly took her to wife.”

Before he had finished speaking, Sanjie laughed and said, “Having taken her, what then? Has the young lady forced anything upon you? Has she ever required you to enact those conjugal acts?” Hearing this, Xianci’s face reddened slightly, and he laughed, “I said, Sister Sanjie, that you would not deceive me; therefore I dared to trust you in all things!” Sanjie laughed and said, “Then you should obey all my counsels. Now I require you quickly to beget a little child with your new lady, so that I may go and report to your parents that the matter is settled. Can you promise me this?” Xianci laughed heartily, “Sister Sanjie, you are indeed a merry one, ever seeking to amuse me. To say such things now—do not say your disciple would not dare to obey, but my wife surely would not consent. If you do not believe me, you females may ask her and see how she answers. Shall we try?” Sanjie laughed, “You are indeed cunning, knowing that you and your new wife have vowed to be immortals in heaven, not lovers on earth. Though I may expose your words, your lips can but cut off my tongue. You are indeed formidable.” Xianci nodded, “What you say is true. Miss Bo is indeed a woman of great foundation. Since hearing my disciple’s counsel, she has become clear of mind. Lately she follows me diligently morning and evening. Not to say your words just now were but a jest; even if you were to plead with my parents for me, you would only strike a wall of resistance. I am sure that nothing would avail.”

Sanjie laughed and said, “That is well. I have reckoned that your brother is a great tribulation to your fate. But without passing through this tribulation, you would be too confident in the Way, and would not easily escape this family circle. For your father will never permit you to enter the monastic life; if you disobey him, you would bring danger to your life. Even if you become an immortal, how can you bear the guilt of unfilial conduct? Moreover, from ancient times to now, no immortal has ever been heard of as unfilial! In this matter you will need your younger brother to create an opportunity for you, that you may both honour your parents above and satisfy yourself below. This brother has no good heart, but you do obtain real benefit from him. This is a secret of heaven, not to be lightly spoken. I now tell you the general truth; keep it in your heart, and you shall see it fulfilled. This is not a matter for us to speak of; but since I judge you will not change your mind, I speak thus casually. You need not tell your wife.” Xianci nodded assent.

A few days later, Sun Jie saw Sanjie and again raised this matter. Sanjie replied briefly and dismissed it. From then on Xianci continued his official duties; returning home he loved and cared for his parents and wife, cherishing his younger brother, and so devoted himself to the joys of the family. Yet who knew that this brother, the flood-dragon, was different in temperament and character; in a moment he had reached twelve years, and his wit was extraordinary. If called foolish, he was crafty in all things; he could pick fault before his parents, so that the elder brother and sister-in-law were brought low; yet in every word and deed he showed great sincerity, so that none could but believe he was a simple man. If called wise, he did not know good or evil, right or wrong. Though the elder brother and sister-in-law treated him with great kindness, he set himself resolutely against them.

At this time Hu Sanjie seldom visited the Sun household; at most three or five times a year she came, imparting some incantations to the couple, testing their progress. Xianci was a loyal and filial gentleman; Miss Bo was a gentle and virtuous daughter, and though suffering great injury from her brother-in-law, and receiving no kind word from the elders, with evident difference in treatment between the two brothers, they bore no complaint. Only the teacher Wen Mei, who had promised to send guidance from time to time, was silent without news. Xianci repeatedly asked Sanjie, who only said, “Immortals never deceive; you must diligently cultivate and quietly await. Why be so impatient?” Xianci had no choice but to desist.

One day, on the occasion of Luo Yuan’s birthday, Xianci knew his mother’s origin and specially bought many field snails to release. Unexpectedly, the flood-dragon saw this and also bought some snails, having them cooked and sent to Luo Yuan, saying, “Big brother, because it is mother’s birthday, has specially prepared these snails for her longevity.” This one phrase struck at the heart of Luo Yuan’s grievance, so that she was nearly unable to speak. The flood-dragon, fearing that she would scold Xianci openly and reveal all, quickly said, “Mother, restrain your anger. I have heard that the sister-in-law has another wicked scheme to make you ashamed. I am now investigating how she seeks to contrive this; I have some clue. When I have found proof, I will accuse her of insubordination; then she will not be able to deny it.”

The Luo couple had long been ensnared by the flood-dragon’s intrigues and had come to detest Xianci and his wife. Therefore they believed every word he said. Seeing this, they readily agreed. Poor Xianci and his wife could never have dreamed that their own parents and kinsfolk, their very own in blood, could suspect them so. What was more, while the flood-dragon schemed to sow discord, he also forbade his parents from speaking, so that Xianci and his wife could not utter a word in defence. The couple could only look at each other in sorrow.

Though young, the flood-dragon had made friends with many adepts of the arts outside the world, learning several methods of nightmare demons. At this time elder Bo was ill, and Xianci and his wife went to visit, staying three days. The elder was nearing death, so they remained a few days more. The flood-dragon took this opportunity to make many nightmare charms, inscribing the birth dates of the parents, pricking them with silver needles. Opening the door to his sister-in-law’s room, he placed these things under the bed, under mats, and in various filthy places. Then he performed his rites. This made Sun Jie and Luo Yuan suffer headaches and vomiting of blood. The flood-dragon said, “Surely someone is using an illusion to harm our parents.” At first Sun Jie did not believe, but engaged a Taoist to inspect, who also said they were bewitched. Sun Jie angrily said, “My wife and I have always been kind; we never harboured ill will against others. Who would be so cruel?” The flood-dragon feigned doubt and said, “True; our family are honest and kind. If there were enemies, they would name themselves! Only the elder brother and sister-in-law, whom our parents do not much love and often bear resentment, yet why would they go to such lengths? But to work nightmare magic requires the person’s birth date and hour; how could outsiders know? Even servants may not understand fully!”

This speech moved Luo Yuan deeply. Women are most credulous in such matters. Taking the flood-dragon, she went to search the couple’s room. They found many evidences of evil arts. Luo Yuan’s anger was greater than before, and since the evidence was conclusive, Sun Jie also believed that the evil was wrought by Xianci and his wife, and immediately burnt the charms; then their ailments were cured.

In great anger, Sun Jie sent the flood-dragon to elder Bo’s house to summon Xianci, to charge him with the crime of disobedience and unfilial conduct. The flood-dragon hastened to stop him, saying, “Father, if you accuse him of rebellion, you ought not destroy the evidence. Without proof, mere words are vain. Besides, he is now a doctor, protected by officials; surely you would lose this case. Rather feign ignorance, and keep them at home. If they learn the plot is discovered, they will be uneasy and contrive another evil plan, which we cannot guard against. Better to send something to big brother, saying it is from someone else, and that mother remembers big brother and specially sent it for him to eat, but it contains poison, to kill him first. Sister-in-law is but a woman; what great power can she have? When she returns home, we shall find means to deal with her; would that not be better?”

Sun Jie and his wife were so wrathful that they did not reflect, but ordered flood-dragon to deliver a package of cakes to Xianci. Xianci wished to share some with his father-in-law, mother-in-law, and cousins. The flood-dragon said, “Mother only gave these to big brother to eat. To share with others would be insufficient. If big brother does not eat, it would be to waste mother’s affection.” Xianci thought this reasonable and carelessly ate some, leaving the rest with flood-dragon.

That night, Xianci was suddenly seized with a heartache as if it would break; he vomited blood wildly, tossed and turned, crying out in great distress. Elder Bo and his household were in great fear. Elder Bo, already near death, now said farewell and with a final effort passed away. Miss Bo having sent off her father’s spirit, saw Xianci’s countenance change, and his life was but a fleeting moment; she had to abandon her deceased father and take her dying husband home. The two families were more than ten li apart; in a quarter of an hour’s journey, halfway along, they heard Xianci cry out once more and his soul followed his father-in-law’s toward the gates of the nether world. Miss Bo, grieving for her father and husband, was overwhelmed and vomited blood, and fainted insensible. Woe is the pair of husband and wife, who, without attaining the great Way, together hastened to the realm of shades.

What strange events befell the two after death, we shall see in the next chapter.
