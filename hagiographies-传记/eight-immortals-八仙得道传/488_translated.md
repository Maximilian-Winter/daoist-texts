# Chapter 20: The Venerable Ancestor Descends to Save the World — Li Xuan Escapes Peril and Becomes an Immortal

Now it is told that the Supreme Elder Lord, the Primordial Master, is the essence of Heaven and the spirit of Earth, the progenitor of the mountains, whom the common world calls Laozi. From the time when Chaos was first opened, he perfected an indestructible body, and, to complete his merit and virtue, and to save those predestined, he descended repeatedly to the human realm. At the juncture of the Xia and Shang dynasties, having dispatched his two great disciples, Piaomiao and Huo Long, to settle the matter of the Dragon King of the Sea, he then divided his immortal spirit and breath, and, taking refuge in the wondrous Jade Maiden, was born in Ku County of Chu, in Lai village, Qu Ren li; issuing from his mother's left armpit, he was born beneath the Great Li Forest, with a white head at birth, and his face slightly tinged with yellowish white; on his forehead was the pattern of the celestial tree; born able to speak, he pointed to the Li Forest and said to the Jade Maiden, "Mother, I am born here; let this be my surname." The Jade Maiden joyfully consented. He was further named Er, styled Boyang, and also called Laodan. The Elder Lord’s divine spirit did not grow dim; as his Way deepened, he often descended to exorcise demons and dispel monsters, to relieve suffering and succour those in hardship. At the beginning of the Zhou dynasty, he took office as a guardian official of the pillars. When King Wu unified the realm, he was entrusted as the keeper of the pillar records. In the time of King Cheng, he retained his post, and roamed to the Western extremities and the lands of Tianzhu. At the time of King Kang, he returned to Zhou. Towards the end of King Kang’s reign, he suddenly said to his household, "Since before Pangu, from the beginning of Chaos, I have combined Heaven’s essence and Earth’s spirit to become a living man; thereafter, taking many births, all to save the world. In recent centuries, because of the misgovernment of Shang Zhou, and the rise of the Zhou house, immortals have been beset by calamity. I have withdrawn to the mountains and forests, avoiding worldly affairs. Now, considering that five hundred years have nearly passed in the human realm, there is one in the West awaiting my transcendence; I shall forthwith leave seclusion and, having delivered this person, ascend to Heaven." When he had thus spoken, he closed his eyes and sat in silent meditation. His family approached and caressed him, but his breath was gone, his body cold; they could only bury him.

Yet Laozi was not truly dead. On the day his family buried him, Laozi himself rode forth on his ox from seclusion. He came to Hangu Pass, where he met an official with more than ten attendants, who bowed to the left of the road, calling himself Guan Yinxi, and respectfully welcomed the sacred carriage. Laozi dismounted, smiling and asking, "Sir, what matter causes this reverence?" Yinxi replied, "It is long known that you, Master, are a Heaven-born Sage. I, Yinxi, am unworthy, but somewhat versed in divination of qi. Recently I divined the weather and knew that your carriage would pass this very hour; therefore I come to greet you, earnestly hoping you will not disdain the humble carriage, and enroll me among your disciples, to my exceeding joy." Laozi smiled, saying, "You are indeed a man of destiny. Rise, and I will follow you; I will impart to you the secret of longevity and the gate of the Way."

Yinxi was greatly pleased, and with all due reverence welcomed Laozi within the Pass. They sat together in the midst, and he again bowed to him. Laozi sighed, "In five hundred years among men, I have never seen one so earnest in the Way as you. Now I entrust to you the great Dao; cultivate and hold fast; your future is beyond measure!" Then from his sleeve he drew forth the Dao De Jing, five thousand words, and handed it to Yinxi, enjoining, "In cultivating elixirs and refining qi, there are methods; but the fundamental learning lies in the clear vision of the mind’s nature, in screening out desires and severing attachments. This is the source of the immortal’s life. All find it in this scripture. Do not lightly neglect it, lest you bring fault and error upon yourself." Yinxi knelt thrice and accepted the charge. Laozi further said, "I cannot long remain here; soon I will go to Mount Kunlun to cultivate and inspect the cavern dwelling." Yinxi wept, saying, "Having just seen your kindly countenance, how can I bear to see you depart?" Laozi said, "The foremost precept of the cultivator is to control the passion; if you can truly cultivate the truth, it is as if you are always by my side; why need you see me daily?" Yinxi said, "I would abandon home and follow you, through fire and water, encountering all dangers!" Laozi said, "I roam on the surface of Heaven and Earth; I do not have a fixed abode like ordinary men. Between the obscure and the mysterious, I have no dwelling like mortals. I go in and out of the four cardinal points, traverse the eight extremities; the vast and boundless is without limit. Your days in the Way are short; you cannot yet penetrate the divine; how can a body of flesh and blood follow me closely?" Yinxi asked, "When shall we meet again?" Laozi said, "First I will go to Kunlun, then to the Sea; there is still a worldly bond to be fulfilled, to the Western regions. In Shu there is a green sheep shop; years ago when I was there, I saw that the master was most benevolent, yet childless; my heart was moved, and I said jestingly that if he accumulated five hundred merits more, I would send him a son. Now the master and his wife are over one hundred and twenty years old, their spirit undiminished, and have accumulated four hundred and eighty merits; I shall personally transmigrate as their son. About twenty years hence, this old couple should have a son; five years thereafter, you may personally visit me in Shu."

Having thus spoken, he pointed outside, and a multicoloured cloud descended gently and attached to Laozi’s feet. Laozi mounted it; the ox he rode stood upon the cloud. His face shone with the Five Brights; his body was enveloped in golden radiance, illuminating the ten directions; ascending gently into the cinnabar void, five-coloured auspicious light shone forth, illuminating near and far. Yinxi prostrated himself and sent him off, watching until the clouds were lost, weeping. Thereafter he reverently recited the Dao De Jing, pondering its meaning; he also mastered the art of government, which lies in keeping the people quiet and undisturbed, so that men know not good or evil, and desire not rise or fall; in this way non-action is attained, and after several years the effect was great. According to what he saw and heard, he compiled the Thirty-six Chapters of the Western Ascension Record. Within three years he cultivated the Golden Elixir, and further compiled the Book of Guan Yinzi. When the book was finished and the elixir completed, twenty-five years had passed exactly.

Yinxi remembered Laozi’s instructions, gave up his office and residence, and personally journeyed to Western Shu to seek the green sheep shop. None knew of this. For many days he received no news. Yinxi firmly believed Laozi had not spoken in jest, and so patiently awaited.

One day, while walking in the countryside, he suddenly saw a little boy leading a green sheep. Yinxi rejoiced greatly, saying, "The immortal’s message is always full of mystery; now that there is the green sheep, surely a sign is at hand." Approaching, he saluted, "Pray tell, boy, whence this sheep? Where is it to be taken?" The boy laughed, "How strange! My lord and lady, over one hundred and twenty years old, have had a son, now five years old, who dearly loves this green sheep. Several days ago the sheep disappeared; the young master was greatly displeased. Thus the lord sent men to search everywhere, and now it has been found and led home, to prevent the young master’s sorrow." Hearing this, Yinxi saw it accorded exactly with Laozi’s farewell instructions, and was exceedingly glad. He said quickly, "Pray have the boy deliver a letter to the young master, saying that an old friend, Yinxi, seeks to see him!" The boy looked the man over and laughed, "My young master is only five years old; how could he have such an old acquaintance?" Yinxi laughed, "Not only an old friend, but indeed his master. I am but a disciple of your young master. If you do not believe me, you may go to him and say, 'Yinxi requests an audience,' and see what he says; then you may return to me." The boy half believed, half doubted, and led Yinxi back to the house, where he handed the green sheep to the young master. The young master was overjoyed. The boy told how he had met Yinxi, who claimed to be the young master’s student coming to seek him, which made all the household laugh.

Who would have thought! As soon as the young master heard this, he immediately straightened his robes and arose. To the household he said, "No mistake, he is indeed such a person; quickly summon him in to see me!" The family was much confused by this scene. The young master repeatedly urged the boy to hasten. The boy came out and said to Yinxi, "The young master bids you enter! His temper is strange; do not provoke him, lest we suffer for it!" Yinxi smiled, "I understand." He stepped forward, bowing at every step, and entered the inner court. The young master, upon seeing Yinxi, immediately manifested lotus feet, and was wrapped in coloured clouds, transforming into a golden figure ten zhang high, radiating light like the sun, fragrant on all sides; the whole household was greatly amazed. Yinxi, seeing this, prostrated himself at his feet, saying, "Your disciple kowtows before the master!" The young master gently bade him rise, and on turning saw the astonishment of his parents and household; he smiled and said, "I am the Elder Lord. Taiwei is my abode, True Unity my body. Because fifty years ago I promised to be born, I have come to fulfill this old bond. Now the worldly ties are ended; my parents, sisters, and all household may ascend with me to Heaven, and never perish through countless kalpas!"

The household heard this and fell to the ground in obeisance. Laozi bade Yinxi assist his parents to their seats, and after all had paid respects, he spoke to Yinxi, "Last time you wished to travel the world with me; but because your cultivation was still unsteady, your worldly ties not ended, and you had but recently received the scripture and could not yet succeed, if you had followed hastily, your flesh and blood could not bear it, and I feared it would divide your mind and body and hinder your studies. Now I see your qi cultivation and body preservation have reached true subtlety; your face shines with the spirit, your heart is bound with purple threads, your outer gold name is on the mysterious chart, your jade tablet is in the firewood chamber; your qi penetrates Taiwei; your form is resolved and united with truth; this fully proves your diligence and earnestness in the Way. I shall again let my Dao De Jing and two books you have composed circulate among men, which is also meritorious. Today, meeting here, I shall petition the Jade Emperor to grant you a title and appoint your heavenly duty." Yinxi knocked his head, making a sound.

Laozi commanded him to rise and stand aside. Then by incantation he summoned the multitudes of the Three Realms, the sovereigns of the heavens, the kings of the ten directions, and the gods of each cave and mountain, both immortal and scattered. Presently, the immortals all arrived on coloured clouds and divine beasts, each bearing incense and flowers, bowing and worshipping. Clouds of incense and showers of blossoms filled the air, as if a celestial assembly had opened. Laozi sat upon a lotus throne, facing the Five Elders Supreme Emperors and the Four Extremities Supervisors, and bestowed upon Yinxi a jade register inscribed in golden script, granting him the title of Master Wenshi, with the rank of Supreme Perfected One, dwelling above the Twenty-four Heavens, commanding eighty thousand true immortals, soaring through the void, and partaking in the Dragon Chariot. Yinxi humbly knelt to receive the commission. Laozi warmly thanked him, and the immortals gradually dispersed. Laozi, accompanied by Yinxi and his whole family, ascended by day and all attained immortal forms. Laozi and Yinxi returned to the Eight Sceneries Palace on Mount Kunlun. Laozi, having taken Master Wenshi as his disciple, seemed to have added an arm to his own body, entrusting him with all mortal and immortal affairs.

One day, while in the palace playing the game of weiqi with Master Wenshi, Laozi suddenly stopped placing stones, his gaze fixed in thought. Wenshi asked the cause. Laozi smiled, "Do you know where my mount has gone?" Wenshi laughed, "Indeed, I have not seen him for days." Laozi sighed, "The doom of kalpa is such that even the power of immortals cannot avert it. This wicked beast descended to the mortal realm many years ago, and has now been there for several years. At Mount Hua it devours men and beasts, injuring countless people. Soon, one of my disciples will suffer this calamity. This person will achieve great success under my tutelage, comparable to yourself. Tomorrow at noon, you must go down and seek to save this person, and bring him to the palace." Wenshi asked, "What is his name?" Laozi said, "He is surnamed Li, named Xuan, an official of the celestial incense bureau. He offended and was cast to earth, degraded ten times. Now his term is complete; fortunately his spirit remains unclouded. The planet Venus will guide him from the household, and he is to go to Mount Hua to endure hardship and danger. When you reach there you will understand."

Wenshi took the order and prepared to go; Laozi instructed, "Take the ox-tending boy with you; he may aid you. When you have secured him, have him mount and ride back first."

Wenshi went to summon the ox-tending boy, who was none other than the same child sought in Shu for the green sheep, now assigned to tend Laozi’s beast. Laozi, seeing the boy, rebuked him, "What kind of care is this? How careless you are, letting him escape and harm men and beasts! Now there is one who should attain the Way, suffering from his venom. If he falls under his hand, how will you answer for your guilt?" The boy dared not reply, but prostrated and begged forgiveness. Wenshi pleaded for him, and Laozi commanded, "Arise and follow the Perfected One to descend to the mortal world, capture this wicked beast, and merit shall offset guilt!" The boy thanked Wenshi and followed him; mounting the cloud, they descended to Mount Hua.

Wenshi’s keen gaze scanned the southwest, where thin mists lay; through them shone a thread of red dust reaching the heavens. He said to the boy, "Come with me to exorcise; be cautious and not careless!" The boy answered repeatedly, "I will!" They rode the clouds to the cave where Li Xuan suffered. Just as they prepared to descend, Wenshi first used his clairvoyance and saw many small demons surrounding Li Xuan atop a pot. Li Xuan leaped into the pot; at that critical moment, Wenshi quickly waved his hand, and a huge block of ice came from the Northern Sea and was pushed into the pot. It reached before Li Xuan’s body, and the boiling water touched the ice; the ice melted and the water cooled, so that Li Xuan, immersed in the pot, was neither hot nor cold, fitting for washing. Li Xuan was amazed, but increasingly believed that immortals were testing him thus. Content, he hid in the pot and planned for escape.

Meanwhile, Wenshi and the boy descended before the cave and entered. The demon who was waiting to cook Li Xuan for the banquet, seeing Wenshi and the boy enter, was alarmed and sought to flee. Wenshi drew from his sleeve Laozi’s ox-whip, struck the demon, and shouted, "Wicked beast! Will you not reveal your true form? When then?" The demon rolled on the ground, transforming back into the green ox, but reared his horns to attack Wenshi. Wenshi pointed his hand, and, like Mount Tai pressing down, the ox was unable to breathe or move, and had to lie down weeping. Wenshi laughed, "This wicked beast dares such boldness; know that your master is angry! Boy, lead him back. His body cannot endure such pressure; if he is injured, he will not face his master again!"

The boy was rebuked and greatly angered; he approached and fiercely kicked the ox several times, cursing, "You reckless beast, you are heedless here, nearly causing me punishment." Wenshi laughed and counselled, "Enough, he has been subdued enough; be merciful." The boy then put a ring in the ox’s nose, took the reins in hand, gave a shout, and rose. Wenshi gathered his powers and let him lead out of the cave, mounting the clouds first. Wenshi sheathed his sword and patrolled the cave’s front and back, dispersing all small demons. Then he entered the great kitchen and drove away the small demons managing the fire and water, and thus rescued Li Xuan.

Li Xuan emerged from the pot, and seeing Wenshi’s radiant countenance, majestic as a golden immortal from Heaven, so unlike the demon, knew him to be the true immortal testing him, and prostrated himself, bowing without ceasing. Wenshi laughed, "You are my junior brother; no need for such ceremony. Quickly go and put on your clothes, and come with me to Kunlun!" Li Xuan obeyed, left the murderous kitchen, donned clothes, and again knelt to thank Wenshi, asking, "What is the immortal’s title?" Wenshi then revealed his rank, origin, and the mission in saving him. Li Xuan then knew that the demon was Laozi’s green ox playing tricks, and was overjoyed that his Daoist heart had moved the Ancestor to take him as disciple; he was filled with gratitude, bowing again toward Heaven. He asked Wenshi, "How far is Kunlun?" Wenshi laughed, "If a mortal walked, it would take fifty or sixty years to run!" Li Xuan stuck out his tongue and said nothing.

Wenshi said, "Let us go!" and gestured; two red clouds flew in, and he took Li Xuan by the hand to mount. Li Xuan, first time riding clouds, was trembling with fear. Wenshi said, "You have run far to Mount Hua and braved the demon’s boiling pot; why fear this journey?" Li Xuan smiled and lost his fear. Soon they rose on the clouds, the wind whistling; looking down, the scenes below seemed to fly backward: countless high mountains and steep ridges; many great rivers; hundreds of bustling markets; and thousands of deep forests. While admiring the view, Wenshi cautioned, "Do not gaze downward too much; your mortal body cannot bear dizziness. Be careful, or when you meet the Ancestor you will be unable to salute properly!" Li Xuan was greatly afraid and hastily closed his eyes, letting the clouds and wind bear him.

In the time it takes to cook a meal, he heard Wenshi shout, "Stop!" and opened his eyes. They had landed upon a lofty mountain, a place of clear and tranquil beauty. Wenshi smiled, "Junior brother, this is the highest peak of Kunlun. The Ancestor’s cave lies ahead. See there? Two boys come to meet us; the Ancestor has sent them to greet you and me." Li Xuan followed Wenshi’s gaze, adjusted his robes, and walked with measured steps to meet them. Indeed, two boys came hand in hand, smiling, "Eldest Brother returns! The Ancestor bade us wait here for you." Wenshi smiled, "Please, junior brothers, go in and inform him that I have brought Li Xuan to wait." The boys soon went out and beckoned, "The Ancestor commands you enter." Wenshi led Li Xuan hastily into the palace.

Li Xuan now was filled with reverence, his eyes fixed ahead, and knowing not how many jade towers and halls, golden palaces and silver steps he passed, he arrived at the Ancestor’s great hall. Wenshi bade Li Xuan wait at the door, and first went in to report the capture of the green ox demon and the bringing of Li Xuan to pay respects. Laozi smiled warmly and bade that Li Xuan be admitted. Wenshi returned and led Li Xuan inside. Li Xuan prostrated at the steps, saying, "Your disciple Li Xuan greets you, and wishes the Ancestor boundless longevity!" Laozi bade him sit. Li Xuan arose after bowing, but dared not sit. Wenshi laughed, "The Ancestor bids you sit; you should not be over modest!" Li Xuan therefore sat. Laozi looked upon him with joy in his heart.

What joy it was, no man yet knows. It will be told in the next chapter.
