# Chapter 22: Success in Attaining the Dao and Paying Homage to One’s Parents

Now it happened that Li Xuan was quietly exerting his primal energy within his chamber, when a certain woman, by guile, seized the sacred scrolls. He was so startled that he stood aghast, unable to utter a word; and forthwith, he, together with Fei Fei and others, issued forth from the cave to look about, but no trace of her could be found.

Li Xuan stamped his foot and sighed deeply, tears falling like rain. Dizzy asked, “The demon has gone; it is now vain to be anxious. It is better to devise means quickly to recover the scrolls, which is the proper course.” This reminded Li Xuan, who hastened to say, “True indeed! When she departed, she said she dwelt behind the mountain, in the White Jade Cave; she is the so-called Lady White Jade. Have you, who have dwelt here for many years, ever heard of such a demon cavern? Such a demon?” Fei Fei shook his head and said, “The mountain’s caves are countless in size; though the lesser ones have long dwelt here, yet they know not the particulars.”

Suddenly Li Xuan remembered, and said, “My senior brother once taught me the method of summoning spirits; why not call the local earth god of this mountain and inquire of him, and so gain knowledge of the matter?” Fei Fei and Dizzy both urged him to summon the deity quickly. Li Xuan complied and made the requisite gestures. Presently the old earth god stood before him, smiling broadly and first thanking Li Xuan for the service rendered in capturing the two demons. Fei Fei and the others stood aside, their faces flushing red. The earth god looked up and seeing the two, was somewhat embarrassed. Li Xuan said, “That was then, and this is now. Let bygones be bygones! We are all of one family today; let us first consult about recovering the scriptures, which is urgent.” Then he inquired of the earth god, “Knowest thou of a White Jade Cave within the mountain?” The earth god replied, “The White Jade Cave is indeed near here, yet it is not under the jurisdiction of this humble god; therefore I know not the details. Now I hear that a demon dwells there who does mischief, devouring travellers, and is of the same kind as these two.” Fei Fei, hearing this, struck the bald pate of the earth god twice, laughing and scolding, “Old fellow, thou art a trickster indeed! Here stands my master, and thou dost presume to jest with us? Tomorrow, if I take to demonry again, I’ll thrash thee in thy hole; then thou shalt see if I be a hero or no.” The earth god was scared and stammered, “This poor god was but jesting; dare I offend you two?” Li Xuan rebuked, “Having entered the right path, how can one harbour evil thoughts? Art thou not afraid to break thy oath? See, my senior brother’s thunderbolt shall smite thee!” Fei Fei laughed, “It is but sport with this old fellow; no need to be so serious.” Li Xuan said, “Though it be sport, there must be a measure; such words that transgress rules and proprieties are not to be spoken.” Fei Fei had to promise compliance.

Li Xuan thanked the earth god and dismissed him. He then took the two and went to the rear mountain, where he summoned the earth god of that place and questioned him. There he found the earth god, withered and worn, his form and spirit wasted, much as was the case with the first earth god. Li Xuan asked about the demon of the White Jade Cave. The earth god reported, “Thirty li hence is a mountain cave, behind which is a source of white jade, whence it takes its name. In that cave is a demon who insults the gods and devours men, committing many evil deeds. It was born of the union of the Blue Ox of the Old Lord Ancient Master and a wild ox of this mountain. Born without food, it sought a tender white jade substance behind the cave as its nourishment. Having consumed much jade, and being endowed with intelligence, it was able to assume a human form. Its colour is pure white, its skin delicate; throughout, it is of a jade hue, and even the garments it wears are pure white, without any mixture of colour. It calls itself Lady White Jade. Often it goes down the mountain to beguile beautiful youths, bringing them back to its cave to draw their primal essence. When their essence is exhausted, and their bodies decline, it devours them. This has caused the travellers below the mountain to become scarce, and the residents to avoid the place; the incense and offerings to the local gods have ceased; all are in great distress. Now, having received the decree of the law, it is doubtless that a heavenly envoy has come to subdue this demon. This is not only a blessing for the people, but also a great protection to the local gods.”

Dizzy whispered to Fei Fei, “I did not expect this demon to be of our kind; no wonder the earth god mocked us.” Fei Fei scolded, “If that be so, thou shouldst make acquaintance with it as kin.” Li Xuan, vexed in his heart, hearing their banter thus, sharply rebuked them, “Enough of this nonsense! The demon has stolen the scriptures; all three of us share the guilt. Should we not hasten to devise means to recover them? Yet here you are, mocking each other; it befits not the manner of immortals, nor the rules of the Dao!” Hearing this, they dared not speak further.

Li Xuan again asked the earth god, “What powers hath this demon?” The earth god said, “Its powers are not very great; it can ride clouds and summon rain, and capture persons. It also wields a three-pointed, two-edged blade with great skill; ordinary men cannot hope to overcome it. Beyond this, nothing else is apparent.” Li Xuan thanked the earth god and dismissed him. He then said to the two, “This demon is a kind of ox spirit. You two have skills in battle formations; go forth and confront her. I will remain on this high peak, watching from afar. If you cannot overcome her, I will aid you with my flying sword.” Fei Fei said, “If so, Master, then just let the sword finish her at once! Why waste any more trouble.” Li Xuan said, “Know I not? It is because this creature has cultivated for many years to attain these degrees of power. My treasured sword was bestowed by the Ancient Master himself; when it flies forth, even gods and immortals find it hard to withstand. How can this demon oppose it? Were I to injure her life, it would be a waste of her thousand years of effort! My wish is to recover the scriptures and then, by kind words, transform her; to spare her life and make her attain the fruit of the Dao for all her days—that would be best. Should she be stubborn and disobedient, and we must contend bitterly, then it is her own seeking death. I shall then open the way to slay, and rid this mountain of a scourge. I reckon that Heaven and Earth have the virtue of cherishing life, and that the arts of immortality and weapons are not used without necessity. You two by nature are fierce and cruel, having committed many crimes; since you have entered my gate, you should ever keep this thought in your hearts, to atone for past transgressions, so that your achievements shall be beyond measure.” Hearing this, the two were greatly moved, and joyfully obeyed.

They came before the White Jade Cave, calling aloud, “Lady White Jade, come forth and meet us!” The Lady White Jade, having obtained the treasure book, was rejoicing. Suddenly, a subordinate demon reported that a man and a woman outside were shouting, naming the Lady and requesting an audience. The Lady laughed, “Surely those are Li Xuan’s two disciples. I will go out and meet them.” So with the matter ended, she took her three-pointed, two-edged blade and went outside, shouting, “Are you two the disciples of that poor Daoist?” They answered, “We are. Since you know us, then kindly return the scriptures, and all shall be well; but if you hesitate in a single word, do not blame us for ruthlessness.” The Lady laughed loudly, “Merely a rabbit and a pheasant! What great skill have you to speak thus boldly!” The two grew angry in turn, “Do not mock us! Look in the mirror yourself; have you not shed your ox shape?” At this the Lady’s anger was kindled, and she charged the two with her blade. The two took up arms to resist, and the battle lasted fifty rounds; yet the two were no match for her. When they were about to retreat defeated, Li Xuan, standing on the mountain top, had already espied the scene; hastily drawing his sword, he chanted spells, and as golden light appeared, the sword flew forth from his hand.

Li Xuan’s heart wished to spare her life, and he thought thus: “It is best to strike her in a place not fatal.” But the sword was a spirit of intelligence; as the heart willed, so the sword followed. Before Li Xuan’s thought was complete, the sword circled about the demon’s feet and severed one ox leg; the demon’s true form appeared—a pure white flawless ox, lying on the ground, wailing in sorrow. Li Xuan first went into the cave and recovered the sacred scrolls, then returned to the front and asked the white ox, “Dost thou know that I have no wish to slay thee?” The ox only kowtowed. Li Xuan’s heart was filled with pity, and he said, “By thy acts, thou hast deserved death in full measure! Yet I now consider that thou hast cultivated a thousand years, which is no easy matter. By my treasured sword, there is no chance of death; I have only severed a leg to preserve thy life. If thou canst repent, come with me back to the cave, and work with my two disciples in fetching firewood and drawing water, doing small tasks. Since thou lovest my scriptures, thou art fated; I shall treat thee as my two disciples and instruct thee from time to time. But if thou art stubborn and unrepentant, behold my immortal sword in hand; I shall at once take thy life as easily as turning over my hand.” The white ox wailed and obeyed; rolling on the ground, it transformed into a beautiful woman with a lame leg, and followed Li Xuan back, joined by Fei Fei and Dizzy, to the Purple Mist Cave.

From that time forth, Li Xuan practiced with increasing diligence, and took greater precautions. He ordered the three to stand guard in shifts by day and night at the cave entrance; no person or demon, not bearing the lawful decree, might enter. After several months, the smoke and fire were quite cut off. Each day the three gathered some fruit in the mountain to satisfy hunger; their forms and spirits grew clear and lean. Within a year, having completed reading two scrolls, Li Xuan could summon wind and rain, ride clouds and call forth mist at will, all according to his wishes. At this time, more demons came to the mountain; those who came were subdued or slain, thereby removing many great scourges from the mountain. When he finished reading the second scroll, he could enter the nether regions and the darkness, change forms endlessly, and know the matters of past and future; he had attained the power of transcending the ordinary and entering the sacred, such that even the Great Luo Golden Immortals of Heaven might not surpass him.

When the three years’ term was ended, he instructed Fei Fei and the others to remain guarding the cave, and himself rode the clouds to Kunlun Mountain’s Eight Scenery Palace to pay homage to the Old Lord. The Old Lord had long known of this, and there awaited him the Master Wenshi leading ten generations of disciples to greet him. Li Xuan advanced to meet them; all the immortals congratulated him on his success. Li Xuan was overwhelmed with humility. The immortals then led him to see the Old Lord, who kindly bestowed further rewards. Li Xuan asked for more instruction, and the Old Lord said, “To follow the Dao is to diminish, to diminish yet more, until one reaches non-action; the heart wanders and desires grow faint; the vast breath inclines to goodness, and is without partiality towards things as they are.” Li Xuan bowed and accepted his teaching. The Old Lord further commanded, “All immortals chiefly nourish their nature and guard their heart, and secondarily use the arts; by guarding heart and nature they perfect an indestructible body, and by cultivating the arts they serve to aid and deliver others. Though you have attained cultivation, your merit and practice are still insufficient. Three years ago I bade you roam the mountains and waters; now is the time to do this work, and also to perform some meritorious deeds. Should you meet those fated, do not hesitate to receive them as disciples; all will be for your benefit. After ten more years, again come to see me here.” 

Li Xuan received the decree and withdrew, conversing at length with his senior brothers—such as Master Wenshi, Guangchengzi, Chijingzi, the Lamp-Bearing Daoist, and others. The immortals made a feast on the rear mountain to celebrate. At the banquet, there was no end to the celestial wine and delicacies, nor to the rare and exquisite fare. Moreover, as Li Xuan had just completed his cultivation, the host and guest alike rejoiced to the utmost. Master Wenshi smiled first and said to Li Xuan, “Virtuous younger brother, one so easily attaining the Dao as thou may indeed be reckoned the easiest since the time of the immortals! Consider, from the day thou left the world, how few days have passed, and yet such achievement! Compared with us, there is truly difficulty in distinguishing which is slow or fast, easy or hard.” The Lamp-Bearing Daoist and Guangchengzi both said, “This is the result of each man’s fate and blessings; it cannot be forced.” Chijingzi laughed, “Indeed, we few who have attained immortality count ourselves fast; never thought Brother Li Xuan would surpass us tenfold, truly to be envied.” Li Xuan, modest by nature, seeing such praise from his senior brothers, was uneasy and hastened to thank them repeatedly, saying, “All is the grace of the Ancient Master and the teaching of my brothers.” Wenshi then said, “The Ancient Master once said that my younger brother was in a previous life a celestial maiden, who, having set his heart on the ascent, moved the Jade Emperor to grant this life. Being pure in spirit, he entered the Dao from youth, hence his blessings were great and success not difficult. In these three years, thy exertion and diligence were great, hence this unexpected success. What merit have we?” Li Xuan hastened to say, “Had it not been for the two attendants you bestowed on me, I should long since have perished of cold and hunger, and not attained my present position.” At these words, all the immortals laughed.

After three days, Li Xuan took leave of the Old Lord and his senior brothers, and returned to the Purple Mist Cave. He commanded the three youths to guard the cave carefully and to cultivate diligently; the three bowed and accepted his command. Only now did Li Xuan feel at ease, and he descended to the mortal realm. This time was unlike before; he was a man who had attained the Dao, and all things were convenient. He thought that before becoming a recluse, he had promised his parents that once he attained success, he would return home to pay them a visit. Now was the opportunity; one was to cultivate filial respect, the other to see the state of his homeland.

Riding the clouds, in less than half a day he arrived at the city of Luoyang, and walked home. His father, Li Qi, and mother, Lady You, were aged and feeble, continually ill at home, seldom venturing forth. Suddenly, the household reported a Daoist seeking an audience. Li Qi, having lost his son for many years, could not think that his own child had returned. But seeing a true immortal, he dared not disdain a stranger. Whenever a distant Daoist sought audience, he always treated him with courtesy. Though ill, he retained a single heart of reverence and ordered the guest to be admitted. Li Xuan, seeing his father so aged, was filled with sorrow and hastened forward, embracing his father’s legs, kneeling and bowing, “Your unfilial son Li Xuan pays homage to his father.” Li Qi, taken by surprise, was greatly amazed; hastily he helped him up and asked, “Art thou truly my son Li Xuan? How camest thou to return?” Looking closely at Li Xuan, he saw his noble and free appearance, more comely than before, and then fully recognized his beloved son. His heart was filled with joy beyond measure; he had no time for further questions, but drew him up and cried, “Quick, call the lady! The son who became a recluse has returned!”

Hearing this, the lady also was moved to tears and snot, and came forth without aid, quick on her feet to the front hall. Li Xuan fell upon her, crying, “Mother, your unfilial son pays homage.” The lady said nothing but looked at Li Xuan and then at Li Qi, and asked, “Sir, what is this talk? Are we both dreaming?” Li Qi laughed, “Nonsense. It is broad daylight; what dream could there be?” Li Xuan also laughed, “Mother, do not doubt; it is I, your son, who has returned!” The lady wept again bitterly. Many of the household came to pay their respects to the young master, congratulating the master and mistress.

The lady and Li Qi both eagerly questioned Li Xuan about past events, and he gave a general account. The old couple rejoiced greatly, saying, “So it is that our son’s ambition was fulfilled, and he became an immortal. We have long thought of him since he left, and nearly fell ill with longing. Now, as we grow older and weaker, believing life would not see him again, to be reunited today is the greatest joy and a blessing to the family.” Li Xuan replied, “Since departing from you, my heart has ever been mindful. Because my will to learn the Dao was firm, I durst not lessen my resolve, nor disobey my master’s commands to visit secretly. Now, fortune having favoured me, I may again behold your kind faces, and in my heart am greatly comforted.” Seeing his parents so weak, he hastened to take from his side two elixirs, saying, “These pills were made by me on Mount Hua according to the Ancient Master’s scriptures; they have the power to restore life and revert old age.” He bade them bring a basin of pure water, and bade the two elders each take a pill. Li Qi and his wife were greatly pleased; they took the pills with the water, and indeed the miraculous effect of the celestial medicine was extraordinary. Their eyes felt refreshed, their bodies light and vigorous; in a moment, their grey hair turned black, and all ailments vanished. Both rejoiced, saying, “Thanks to thy resolve to become a recluse, and the attainment of the great way, even we the old have benefited.” Li Xuan said, “This is nothing. Formerly the Ancient Master ascended to heaven and became immortal; I have but just attained the immortal way, my merit and practice not one ten-thousandth of his. This time I have been bidden to descend to the world and accomplish great merit, hoping soon to attain perfect fruit and be appointed a Golden Immortal. Then I shall be able to escort my parents to ascend with me to heaven.”

The old couple were still more joyful. Lady You, being a woman, wished to keep her son at home for a year or half a year before permitting him to depart again. Li Xuan repeatedly explained that he could not disobey the Ancient Master’s decree, but that now having attained immortal power, he might often return, and she need not detain him. The lady would not consent. After a night, she rose early and ordered that the young master be called to breakfast. But when she went to the study, Li Xuan was nowhere to be seen; only a letter was found, the ink flowing thick and shining with golden light. Li Qi opened it and read how Li Xuan lamented that he must depart, and promised a future reunion, fearing that his mother would be reluctant, so he had borrowed the art of earth flight to leave the mansion, and entreated his parents to eat heartily in the meantime. Li Qi explained this to his wife, who reluctantly gave up.

Li Xuan left the mansion, and hearing that the scenery of Mount Lu in Jiangnan was serene and the waters and mountains of West Lake in Qiantang were splendid, he wished to travel for a time. First he rode the clouds to Mount Lu. That was in the late Zhou and Warring States period, when the south of the Yangtze was considered a barbarous land. On arriving at Mount Lu, seeing the unique situation, unlike the northern mountains, he could not help but nod and sigh, “Surely a great change is to come in the earth’s spirit. Though the north has many heroes, its people’s knowledge is surely inferior to the south.” After many days of wandering, he came to West Lake, with its clear mountains and pure waters surpassing even Mount Kuanglu. Lingering many days, he suddenly met by the lake a child weeping, as if about to throw himself into the water. Li Xuan hastened to observe how he acted. The child wept once more, then cried aloud, “Heaven above, heaven above! I, Yang Rensheng, am a man, yet cannot save my aged mother; better to end life than live in vain beneath Heaven and Earth!” Saying this, he leapt into the lake.

Li Xuan perceived him to be a filial son. Seeing him plunge, Li Xuan was already prepared; pointing with his hand into the lake, the clear water instantly changed its appearance. Whether the water changed or whether the child survived, shall be told in the next chapter.
