# Chapter 23: The Filial Son Cast into the Clear Stream to Succour His Kind Mother — The Great Daoist Master Li Rescues Them from Peril

It is said that Li Xuan, seeing the child who called himself Yang Ren, and knowing that he could not save his mother, cast himself into the clear stream. Hastily he pointed with his hand, and the waters of the lake all congealed. Yang Ren leapt into the lake, and it was as if he trod on level ground; not only was he not drowned, but his clothes and shoes remained not the least wet. Yang Ren was greatly amazed; casting his eyes about on every side, he beheld a man standing before him, smiling at him without ceasing. Yang Ren’s heart knew that this was no common man; but as he was resolved upon death, he made no ceremony, and shouted aloud: ‘Is it you, Daoist, who play these tricks of mystery? Most hateful are you! I had no wish to live in this world, and now that I have come to this last road, what have I to do with you, a man of the religious order? You play these tricks to vex a poor man!’ Saying this, he cried aloud, lamenting to heaven and weeping sorely without ceasing. Li Xuan laughed merrily and approached him, pulling at Yang Ren’s clothes. Yang Ren was startled, saying, ‘Why do you pull at me thus?’ Before he had finished speaking, Li Xuan laughed and said: ‘Open your eyes again and see where you are.’

Yang Ren obeyed and opened wide his eyes, looking about him. Ah! How strange it was! Though he had been by the lake seeking death, in a moment he found himself in a place he had never before known. The vermilion gates and jade tiles, the bright windows and clean tables, all resembled the dwelling of a king. Looking round, there was no one else but himself and Li Xuan. Li Xuan still smiled at him with earnest simplicity! Yang Ren then knew that Li Xuan was indeed a true immortal, and hastily bowed down, crying out, ‘Master, save my life! Master, save my life!’ Li Xuan laughed and said: ‘You are an unruly man. In the world, a man must have some purpose. But just now you strained every nerve to throw yourself into the lake; I, a poor Daoist, out of pity saved your life; and yet you blame me for meddling. How now do you beg me for your life? Is this not self-contradiction?’

Yang Ren prostrated himself on the ground, bitterly weeping, and said: ‘Just now, because I could not save my mother, my mind was dark and I could not see a way; I was forced to take my life. Though I have had instruction from the immortal master, I could not make it clear to myself. Now I see that you are indeed a true immortal of the upper world, and you must be able to save my mother. If my mother is saved, I may live; therefore my thoughts have changed. I earnestly beseech you, master, to have mercy!’ Li Xuan laughed and said: ‘You are truly persistent. You save your own life and want me to save your mother; what concern have I with such worldly matters?’ Yang Ren wept aloud: ‘If master will not save my mother, why save me? It would be better to let me die in the lake, that it may be clean!’ Li Xuan laughed heartily: ‘If you die, how can I save your mother?’ This one remark left Yang Ren speechless.

After some thought, he bowed down and said: ‘I know that the immortal master surely has the skill to save my mother. I only entreat your great compassion to hasten aid. Life and death are of no moment to me; I only ask that my aged mother be rescued from danger. Though my body be torn to pieces and scattered in dust, I am content.’ Li Xuan rejoiced and said: ‘Are you sincere?’ Yang Ren swore an oath: ‘If there be even the least falsehood in my words, may Heaven and Earth punish me, and may I never be born again!’ Li Xuan laughed: ‘That is well! To save your mother you lack but one kind of medicine to serve as a guide.’ Yang Ren said: ‘Pray, master, my mother is not sick, why then must medicine be used? And if this medicine be a guide, where must it be gathered?’ Li Xuan laughed: ‘Whether sick or not, since you seek my aid, this medicine-guide is indispensable. If you should go to the market to buy it, it would cost a thousand taels of gold, and no one would be willing to sell. But with your one grain of sincerity, it costs not a penny and you shall have it!’

Yang Ren was clever and thought a moment, then said: ‘I will propose a riddle for master to guess.’ Li Xuan said: ‘Excellent! Pray tell me.’ Yang Ren said: ‘Master, this medicine-guide cannot be sought abroad, yet it is far a thousand li, and yet it is close at hand!’ Li Xuan laughed: ‘A wise man indeed! This riddle you have surely guessed yourself. Come, let us set out to save your mother!’ Yang Ren was astonished: ‘Master, do you already know my family name?’ Li Xuan laughed: ‘Look again! Where are we now?’ Yang Ren raised his eyes and was struck dumb with amazement; he bowed down crying: ‘Master, you surely are a heavenly spirit.’

Li Xuan laughed and helped him to his feet, saying: ‘Make no ceremony! Since you know I am no ordinary man, why do you not inquire my name or title? Where in the world is there such a rustic as you! You ask for help but know not who I am!’ Hearing this, Yang Ren raised his little fists and struck his forehead twice, saying: ‘Master, you see how foolish I am! Time and again I have sought to ask your Dao name and title, but you never tell me; truly I have become the wild man you say!’ Li Xuan laughed: ‘No need to lament; it is not too late now. I will tell you: my family name is Li, and my common name Xuan; the Supreme Elder Lord Li Er is my ancestor. Seeing your filial heart and your resolve to save yourself from peril, I have come to your aid. After you are delivered from peril, I will also guide you to leave this world; are you willing?’

As Li Xuan spoke, he watched Yang Ren’s countenance. At first joy shone forth, but gradually it changed to sorrow. Li Xuan rebuked: ‘I have done all this for you, and you are still not content? Are you not better than to be a drowned ghost unknown to men and spirits in the lake?’ Yang Ren, eyes full of tears, replied: ‘I do not hide anything from master; you surely understand my family affairs. In youth I studied the classics and learned propriety and righteousness, knowing that of all human duties filial piety stands first. Just now, because my mother was seized, and power was lacking, I knew no way but to end my life. But if my mother be saved and I follow master and become a disciple, for my own sake, I cannot tell by what fate this may be. Yet to leave my aged mother in the country, on the one hand she is in danger, on the other she lacks sweet nourishment and may starve or freeze. This is why I dare not save myself, and why my heart is troubled. If I offend master, I deserve a thousand deaths. I beg master to open the great road of mercy, that I may do both and be truly blessed.’

Li Xuan laughed: ‘Men say, “The heart of man is never satisfied”; this is indeed so! But I ask you, if just now you had died in the lake, and your vow had been fulfilled so that only by being ground to dust could your mother be saved, then when your mother is saved who would care for you?’ Yang Ren was silent, tears flowing, and for a long time could say nothing. Li Xuan spat and laughed: ‘Enough of this whining! Come with me to see your mother!’ Yang Ren then understood that all his former words had been tests from Li Xuan. He rose and asked: ‘Master, where now? I have seen the tablet above the door, and know this is the mansion of the Prince of Zhongshan, the very place where my mother has been seized! The steward Niu Jing dwells in the rear of the mansion; he is the man who forcibly took my mother! Strange indeed, how could master bring me inside? Now that we are here, master, what will you do, and where will you take your disciple?’

Li Xuan cried out: ‘Ask no more! Close your eyes; I have a wondrous method.’ Yang Ren obeyed, shutting his eyes. Presently Li Xuan exclaimed: ‘Open!’ Yang Ren opened and looked about, and found himself changed to another place. Before him was bound a middle-aged woman lying on the ground, crying hoarsely: ‘My son Yang Ren, how could you know your mother suffers here!’ Yang Ren heard these words and was seized with anguish; heedless of Li Xuan’s injunction, he wept and cried aloud, embracing his mother. The mother and son seemed to meet in a dream. Yang Ren steadied himself and found Li Xuan no longer there; he was alarmed and asked: ‘Where is master gone?’ His mother asked: ‘My son, how did you come in? When did you get a master?’ Yang Ren then recounted all that had passed.

His mother rejoiced, saying: ‘An immortal would not deceive. Since he has promised to save us, he surely will not fail. No wonder those sentries just now looked as if they had seen a ghost and fell from the gate. It was all the immortal master’s magic!’ She then raised her hands to heaven: ‘I humbly beseech the immortal master’s grace!’ Yang Ren knelt and bowed his head like a mortar pestle, crying out: ‘Master, come quickly! Master, come quickly!’ No sooner had he spoken than Li Xuan reappeared before them. Smiling, he said: ‘Why such haste? It has been promised to save you, but that Niu Jing is most wicked; I must teach him a lesson. Since your mother is a woman, it is not fitting she remain long in such bondage; she may go first. You, however, stay here to be my medicine-guide. Do as I command, and do not disobey my law; can you do this?’

Yang Ren did not answer. His mother first knelt and said: ‘The immortal master’s mercy in saving us is a grace beyond measure. My son, you must obey the immortal master; do as he bids. To disobey his command is to betray my life; you cannot be my filial son!’ Yang Ren’s face was grave: ‘How dare I disobey? But I would know, master, where will you place my mother when you have saved her?’ Li Xuan waved his hand: ‘Ask no more; soon you shall be reunited with your mother.’

So saying, he brushed his hand over her, and the ropes that bound her fell away. Another sweep healed all her wounds and scars, leaving not a mark. Li Xuan summoned the Yellow Turban warriors: ‘Come quickly and bear this lady to a Daoist temple deep in West Lake, that she be placed in safety without error!’ The warriors bowed and obeyed, carrying her away in a gust of wind, leaving no trace. Li Xuan instructed Yang Ren: ‘In danger, I shall be by your side in invisible form, protecting you, never letting you suffer loss!’

Yang Ren, seeing his mother safe, grew bold and gave his promises one by one. Li Xuan raised his hand and pointed, transforming Yang Ren into a figure like his mother’s, bound on the ground. Soon the sentries returned, each amazed and speaking as if in a dream. Some said: ‘Just now, what demon wind blew that made us dizzy?’ Others said: ‘This place is full of dead, no doubt spirits of the wronged. Tomorrow we will report to the steward and summon a Taoist to cleanse it.’ They talked confusedly. Yang Ren listened and laughed quietly to himself. Presently, one said: ‘The old lady is here again to persuade this fair lady?’ Soon a middle-aged woman staggered in, asking: ‘Where is the new beauty? The steward is a man of great passion, and loves her extremely. Though he punished her just now, he is now full of regret! Look, did he not send me with pills to ease her pain, to serve her?’ She came to where Yang Ren lay bound.

Yang Ren pretended to moan and groan, unable to speak. The old woman, seeing him tied up like a shuttle, scolded the others: ‘How can you be so unreasonable, tying up the lady at such a time? Are you not afraid of breaking her body? If the steward hears of this tomorrow, who can bear the punishment?’ They all hastened to untie Yang Ren’s bonds. The old woman put on a coquettish air and humoured Yang Ren. She personally gave him the pills, which he swallowed, and then spoke eloquently of the steward’s love and affection. Yang Ren was silent at first, then said: ‘If I am to comply, there must be good persuasion. Why strike me so at the least disagreement? Since you say the steward repents, I accept his sincerity and will obey him. But tell him, though I be a widow of low estate, I come from a good family; if he would marry me, he must offer sacrifice to Heaven and Earth, and have the prince officiate; if he should forsake me afterwards, I may seek the prince’s protection.’ The old woman assented eagerly: ‘This can surely be arranged. Though the prince and steward differ in rank, they are like brothers. The prince never contradicts the steward; and in such a small matter, would he refuse to show favour? Madam, rest assured, all is entrusted to me.’ Saying this, she departed joyfully. Turning back, she loudly warned the others: ‘Take good care of the lady; by tomorrow she will be our mistress. Who dares to slight her? If the steward learns of it, no one will have a second head!’ So saying, she went off, stepping high and low.

After the meal-time, the old woman returned with news: ‘The prince, moved by the steward’s entreaty, will come to the ceremony. Today is an auspicious day, and the wedding shall be held this evening.’ Yang Ren remained silent. Then the old woman arranged matters herself, leading a band of women to clothe Yang Ren in cap and gown. All laughed joyfully, awaiting the auspicious hour to escort Yang Ren forth to wed the steward. Yang Ren, confident and without care, was borne along lightly, his feet not touching the ground, like a whirlwind to the great hall. Stealing a glance, he saw twin phoenix candles, red lanterns and green decorations; the hall was full of people coming and going, all joyous, preparing the wedding candles; all were ready to drink the steward’s wedding wine. At that moment, the steward came forth with the Prince of Zhongshan and a company of guests, standing beside Yang Ren on the red carpet, as if to play some trick. The master of ceremonies sang loudly: ‘The auspicious hour has come. The new lord and bride please pay respects to Heaven and Earth!’

At that cry, Li Xuan, hidden beside Yang Ren, gave a tap on his head and shouted: ‘The time has come; do not bear your mother’s ill name! Now strike quickly!’ At this tap, Yang Ren felt his courage grow tenfold. He spread his arms and barred the guests and family on either side, knocking them all down. They could not stand, and retreated. Most pitiable was the steward, flushed with wine and lust, standing beside Yang Ren; he bore the brunt of the push, and when Yang Ren’s hand touched him, it was as if Mount Tai pressed down; he reeled backward and fell, spitting blood and unable to move. The crowd seeing the steward stir wildly cried out and rushed up, brandishing sticks to surround him, shouting: ‘Do not let the she-devil escape!’ Yang Ren shouted aloud and revealed his true form — a boy of some ten years, bare-handed and bravely resisting the crowd. No weapon could touch him without damage. His fists struck others who could neither endure the blows nor keep their footing. Yang Ren glanced and saw the Prince of Zhongshan still standing at the head, shouting: ‘Strange! Strange! Rebellion! Rebellion!’ Li Xuan secretly gave order to disperse the attackers. Yang Ren leapt up and seized the prince, clutching him like a chick, and dashed him to the ground, causing him to lose consciousness one hundred and twenty times. The prince cried out: ‘It is not my doing! It is not my doing!’ Yang Ren lifted him again and counted: ‘You, a ruler of a state, permit your servants to seize chaste widows; you even stand as matchmaker for them. Is this not a great crime?’ The prince hastened: ‘I knew nothing of this; I only knew he took a woman as concubine, not that he committed such crimes. Now please, strong man, release me and let me question and punish him for his great crimes.’ Yang Ren laughed: ‘Then you may trouble yourself.’

Li Xuan revealed himself, waving his robe-sleeve; the hall was filled with golden light, and all was obscured. He and Yang Ren seized the opportunity to mount the clouds, crying aloud: ‘Prince of Zhongshan, hear me! I am a true immortal of the upper world, sent to the mortal realm to observe good and evil. Since you acknowledge your fault, I forgive you. But Niu Jing will not escape! You must punish him severely. Investigate his property; compensate those he has harmed. This will be your merit. If you conceal the truth, be not surprised at my ruthlessness. I shall await your reply in the air for three days.’ Saying this, he ascended on the clouds. The prince hastily led the people in prostrate homage, saying: ‘Truly a true immortal has descended to punish Niu Jing. This man cannot be pardoned; to pardon him would bring Heaven’s punishment upon me.’ Presently the captain was summoned to imprison Niu Jing, expose his crimes, behead him in the market, and issue a proclamation that those harmed might come forth to state their case, and that Niu Jing’s ill-gotten wealth be distributed to them, thus settling this great case.

Meanwhile, Li Xuan took Yang Ren to the Daoist temple where his mother was. The mother and son met, and Yang’s mother wept as if reunited after death. Yang Ren, being of tender heart, recalled the punishment of Niu Jing, and clapped his hands and laughed aloud. Yang’s mother was angry: ‘How rude you are, like a beast! We rely on the immortal’s power and have escaped the tiger’s mouth. Now, in sorrow, I weep here, and you laugh thus; what manner of conduct is this? Moreover, the master is here, and you do not bow to thank him, but make a fool of yourself; you deserve to be beaten to death!’ Yang Ren was reproved, and hastily prostrated himself, saying: ‘How dare I make sport? Thinking of the master’s punishment of those villains was so amusing I could not help laughing.’ Yang’s mother scolded: ‘What is there to laugh at? Go and bow to thank the immortal master!’ Yang Ren hurriedly rose and followed his mother, kneeling with her before Li Xuan. Li Xuan hurriedly turned aside to avoid them. Yang’s mother wept: ‘If not for the immortal master’s rescue, we would now be at the gates of death; how could we remain alive? One bow cannot repay but a thousandth part of your grace. When we return, we shall surely establish an altar to the immortal master and pay homage morning and evening, thus showing our filial sincerity.’

Li Xuan, blush upon his face, stammered: ‘Madam, pray do not take it thus. A man of the religious order, when he meets hardship, must save; when he sees good, must give. This day’s matter is but the filial heart of your son; I, a poor Daoist, dare not claim merit. Only a word I would say: I told your son before that seeing his filial heart at so young an age, I knew his root was not bad; and now seeing his immortal bones, free of dust and defilement, such a man is unfit for official rank. Better that he become my disciple; in less than twenty years, he will achieve much. Whether you live to see it or not, it will be well. Your son’s words were willing, but his heart is with you. The immortal way is founded on loyalty and filial piety; it never severs mother and son. Even for your daily life, I have ways to assist, so you shall not suffer hardship. Madam, this is but my humble care; do you consent to part from your son for the present?’

Madam pondered long and spoke at length. What she said is told in the following chapter.
